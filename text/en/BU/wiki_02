<doc id="585905" wikidata="Q16821205" url="?curid=585905" title="Jamaican cuisine">
<text>Jamaican cuisine includes a mixture of cooking techniques, flavours and spices influenced by Amerindian, West African, Irish, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Indian, Chinese and Middle Eastern people who have inhabited the island. It is also influenced by indigenous crops, as well as, crops and livestock introduced to the island from Mesoamerica, Europe, tropical West Africa and Southeast Asia— which are now grown locally. A wide variety of seafood, tropical fruits and meats are available.

Some Jamaican dishes are variations of cuisines brought to the island from elsewhere, which are often modified to incorporate local produce and spices. Many others are novel or Creole dishes, created from a fusion of dishes, techniques and ingredients from different cultures— which have developed locally over time. Popular Jamaican dishes include curry goat, fried dumplings, &quot;brown stew&quot; oxtail, ackee and saltfish and jerk.
Jamaican patties along with various pastries, breads and beverages are also popular.

Jamaican cuisine has spread with migration, between the mid-17th and 20th centuries. Contingents of Jamaican merchants and labourers, who settled in coastal Latin America, to establish businesses, and work in agriculture and the construction of railroads, ports and the Panama Canal, contributed Jamaican dishes to the region. Also, Jamaicans who have sought economic opportunities in other parts of the world, have spread their culture and culinary practices.

==History==
===Development of the cuisine===
====Taíno / Arawak influences====

The indigenous inhabitants of Jamaica, the Taínos, developed dishes such as jerk meats, roasted fish, bammy, cassava bread and pepperpot (made with callaloo and scotch bonnet pepper). Taíno influence can also be found in dishes like &quot;turned cornmeal&quot;, duckunoo, Jamaican hominy corn porridge and &quot;Saturday beef soup&quot;. They are believed to have kept a stock pot in which meat, fish and vegetables were collected for soup. The Taínos also made intoxicating drinks from cassava and maize, as well as, a tree-bark based drink known for its health benefits, called mauby, which was also made with &quot;mâ’bi&quot;, the Arawak word for sweet potato.

Many native crops and local staples, like peppers (scotch bonnet, cayenne and other cultivars) and beans (like kidney beans) were taken to Jamaica in canoes from Mesoamerica— along with corn, sweet potato, cacao and cassava. They also cultivated chayote (cho cho), coco, squash, pumpkin, yam, peanut, guava, potato, pineapple, starapple, papaya, and other local ingredients. According to historian, James Delbourgo, the brewing of cocoa beans which led to the recipe for chocolate milk and traditional Jamaican chocolate tea, was being done by the Taínos, as far back as 1494. He also mentioned the Spanish and Africans&#x27; use of cacao on the island.

Cooking techniques like jerking, grilling, roasting, smoking and barbecuing, as well as, the use of earth ovens, charcoal, pimento wood, plantain or banana leaves and corn husks to cook, can be traced back to them. Food colouring with annatto was inherited from the Taínos, as well as, tools which were used to grind cocoa beans, corn, and cassava for flour and bammy the traditional way— these include stone and wooden mortars, pestles, grinders and graters called metate, mano and &quot;guaio /guayo&quot;, a long funnel-shaped basket called a &quot;matapi&quot; (for extracting cassava juice), and a flat earthenware griddle (burén) used for baking cassava breads.

====Spanish and Portuguese influences====

The Spanish, the first European arrivals to Jamaica, contributed many dishes and introduced a variety of crops and ingredients to the island— such as Asian rice, sugar cane, citrus like sweet orange, sour orange (&quot;Seville and Valencia&quot;), lime and lemon, tamarind, cacao, coconut, tomato, avocado, banana, grape, pomegranate, plantain, lettuce, carrot, fig and many other fruits and vegetables. They also brought cattle, goat, pig and other livestock that are eaten on the island, as well as, rum, herbs and spices such as rosemary, thyme, garlic, onion, oregano, ginger and others.

Many beans / peas dishes, stews, fish and rice dishes that are Jamaican staples, originated in Spain. Spanish culinary contributions include the vinegary escovitch / &quot;escoveitch&quot; fish (Spanish escabeche), Creole dishes like rice and peas, Jamaican Spanish rice, stews like &quot;brown stew&quot; meats (chicken, pork, cow foot, oxtail etc.), stew peas and red peas soup with cured meats, as well as, the soaking of fruits in wine for desserts like Jamaican wedding and Christmas cakes. Spanish and Portuguese Jews
who had escaped the inquisition in the 1500s, also introduced coconut macaroons, gizzada, steamed and fried fish, and salted codfish which is used in breakfast dishes and Jamaica&#x27;s national dish— ackee and saltfish. It has become a staple from the time it was eaten by enslaved Africans as a long-lasting source of affordable protein. The Jamaican patty, a pasty or empanada-styled turnover filled with spiced meat may have been influenced by the Spanish and Cornish. Sweets like &quot;peanut drops / cake&quot;, coconut drops, &quot;peanut brittle&quot; and grater cake have Portuguese and Spanish influences, as well as, African and Middle Eastern influences.

Cooking and preservation techniques which include stewing, frying, brining, pickling and curing meats were also influenced by the Spaniards.
====African influences====

African cuisine developed on the island as a result of waves of slavery and indentureship, such as callaloo from the Angolan dish &quot;calulu&quot;, okra and taro. Along with the Europeans and Indians, Africans contributed to the cultivation of rice, cow peas and pigeon peas (known as &quot;gungo&quot; locally) in the Americas, which are key ingredients in some local dishes. Their knowledge of cultivating and using crops that were introduced by the Europeans, from Africa and other regions, helped to shape cuisines in the Americas including Jamaica&#x27;s. African influences can be seen in one-pot dishes like &quot;seasoned rice, callaloo rice&quot;, ackee and saltfish and &quot;turned cornmeal&quot;. Dishes prepared with offals like tripe and bean, cow foot stew, &quot;cow skin&quot; or &quot;cow cod soup&quot; and mannish water (&quot;goat head soup&quot;), were also influenced by them. They adopted and added the use of certain spices and ground provisions to variations of dishes from other cultures, as well as, Creole dishes that were created on the island during the colonial era. Jamaican sweets such as &quot;Bustamante backbone&quot; or &quot;stagga back&quot; and asham can be traced back to the Africans, along with the names of foods like &quot;duckunoo&quot; and &quot;gungo&quot;.

In the past, tools like the wooden mortar and pestle were used to grind dried and roasted coffee and cocoa beans, as well as, clay pots called &quot;‘yabba’&quot;, were used for mixing cakes or puddings and seasoning or salting meats—both of which have African origins.

====English, Irish and Scottish influences====

Baked goods like puddings, rock cake, sponge cakes, fruit cakes, muffins, breads, pies, biscuits and spiced bun were influenced by the British— who ruled the island until its independence, as well as, indentured labourers from England, Scotland and Ireland who arrived on the island after the abolition of slavery to replace slaves. As such, Jamaican Easter bun and cheese, jams, other sweet treats like confectioneries and gelatin desserts, teas, macaroni and cheese, and some colonial era Creole dishes have British influences. Sunday roast variations which include pot roast meats, potato and vegetables, as well as, breakfast dishes which include baked beans (adopted from Native Americans by the British), are made in Jamaica. British influences can be seen in the way Jamaicans prepare dinners for holidays and Sundays. Irish moss and porridges were influenced by the Irish and Scottish respectively.
Also, deep frying, a cooking technique used to prepare dishes like Jamaican fried chicken, fried dumpling and festival may have been influenced by the Scots, along with the Spanish and Portuguese.

Staple crops like breadfruit, Otaheite apple, various mangoes, rose apple, coffee, rice (&quot;Gold Seede&quot;), ackee and black pepper were introduced to the island by the British. They also contributed to the distillation of rum, which they exported and traded along with molasses for flour, pork and pickled fish. Additionally, the introduction and development of beers like stout, porter and ale can be traced back to the British. Their influence can be found in Jamaica&#x27;s toffee-like sweet, &quot;Bustamante backbone&quot;.

Due to the migration of British settlers, enslaved and emancipated Afro-Jamaicans and Creole Jamaicans to coastal Central America, between the 17th and 20th centuries, Jamaican dishes some of which were influenced by the British, have been contributed to Belize and the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Honduras, Guatemala and San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina.

====Indian influences====

During the period of indentureship other labourers migrated to Jamaica from India, China, Germany and the Azores in Portugal. Consequently, East Indian influences can be found in Jamaican cuisine like roti, lentil dishes like dhal, callaloo, and a variety of ginger and curried dishes. The Indians brought curry and turmeric to Jamaica,
which have been modified to create &quot;Jamaican curry&quot; powder, a key ingredient in dishes such as curried goat / mutton, chicken and seafood (shrimp, lobster, crab, fish and conch). Indian influences can also be found in eggplant dishes, pelau, pickled unripe mango (with salt and pepper), roasted saltfish &quot;choka&quot;, &quot;takari&quot; dishes (with potato, mango and pumpkin), pholourie and sweets which have been modified like gulgula and khurma. Along with spices, they brought jackfruit, plums, tamarind, banyan, neem and bilimbi (also called &quot;kamranga&quot; locally)— which is pickled and served as a relish. While Indian influences are present in some Jamaican Creole or fusion dishes, and vegetarian dishes in ital cuisine (prepared by Jamaican Rastafarians), some of the aforementioned (like the sweets and relish) and the cooking of unripe jackfruit and bamboo shoots (which have become popular vegetarian dishes internationally), are not widely prepared by all locals. Also, Indian restaurants are operated on the island by more recent Indian migrants (not Indo-Jamaicans), which offer flavours from India that differ from Indo-Jamaican cuisine.

A flat iron griddle called tawah, which is used to make flatbreads, was adopted from the Indians. The karahi pot, also used by Chinese Jamaicans, originated in India. The Indians were the first to manage growing rice in Jamaica, establishing the island&#x27;s first successful rice mill in the 1890s, and they dominated the island&#x27;s vegetable production until well into the 1940s.

====Chinese influences====
Chinese labourers, mostly Hakka, who arrived during indentureship also contributed to Jamaican cuisine. Chinese (especially Cantonese) influences can be found in dishes with pak choy, mushroom and mustard. Upon arrival many of the original ingredients used in China were not available, and they were imported later, so the Chinese had to improvise and adapt in order to recreate their dishes— as such, &quot;Jamaican Chinese food&quot; emerged. In the 1940s, Jamaican tamarind was substituted for Chinese sour plums, key ingredients in the preparation of a popular Chinese duck dish. Their most notable culinary contributions are hard dough bread and the use of soy sauce, ginger and escallion on meats, particularly in Jamaican &quot;brown stew&quot; and fricassee dishes. They also influenced other Jamaican fusion dishes, and contributed stir-fry, chow mein, chop suey, fried rice, sweet and sour meats / seafood, pineapple chicken and others— which can be found on the menus of non-Chinese local restaurants. In Jamaica, many Chinese restaurants have their own variations of Chinese dishes, modified with a local twist, like &quot;Jamaicanized&quot; fried rice with saltfish. Commonly prepared local Chinese dishes include &quot;Jamaican malah&quot; chicken, pork with &quot;muknee&quot; or &quot;hamchoy&quot;, &quot;hot pepper&quot; chicken (pork, beef and shrimp), Chinese five-spice roast meats, &quot;sui / suey mein&quot;, lo mein, &quot;2 or 3 meat choy fan&quot; (which includes a combination of dishes), Chinese-style curry chicken, meats cooked in black bean sauce, &quot;shrimp, chicken or beef broccoli&quot; and others. They have also contributed condiments like oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, sweet and sour sauce, satay sauce and &quot;scotch bonnet-infused soy sauce&quot;, sesame oil and various noodles. Jamaican twist donut (a variation of mahua) and moon cake are of Chinese origin.

A cast iron pot called &quot;‘Chinese karahi’&quot; (a Cantonese-style wok) was also introduced by the Chinese, along with the pow wok and technique of stir-frying. Chinese Jamaican families who owned most of the island&#x27;s bakeries, also perfected making Jamaican patties, which they commercialized locally in the 1960s and 70s— contributing to the dish&#x27;s popularity and demand.

====French influences====
The French, possibly those who fled from Haiti during different periods, or French Jews who went to Jamaica during the inquisition, along with the Spanish, may have influenced dishes like Jamaican fricassee chicken, lobster thermidor, casseroles and pelau made with chicken or shrimp. French and English influences can be found in the use of bouillon or stock cubes, and Jamaican smoked herring pâté called Solomon Gundy. Many Jamaican gourmet dishes, desserts and pastries like tarts, gâteaux and macarons, were adopted from the French. Local variations of French dishes like crêpe, bisque and fries are prepared in Jamaica, often incorporating local ingredients.
A variety of French cooking techniques have also been adopted by Jamaicans— including cutting techniques such as batonnet and julienne used for vegetables in escoveitch and stir-fry dishes, as well as, &quot;rondelle&quot;. Bouquet garni (made with escallion, thyme and other herbs) is used in local stews and soups, and béchamel sauce or roux are used in macaroni and cheese, stews and sauces. Other French cooking techniques which have been adopted include sautéing, blanching, braising, rotisserie and flambéing with rum. A traditional cooking tool used for Jamaican beef and pork pot roasts, called a &quot;‘Jesta pot’&quot; (Digester pot) is of French origin.

Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee and the introduction of coffea arabica to Jamaica can be traced back to one of three coffee plants sent to Martinique by King Louis XV of France— gifted to the Governor of Jamaica from the Governor of Martinique, in the 1700s.
The French who fled to Jamaica during the Haitian Revolution, partly helped with the rapid expansion of the local coffee industry— French masters and their slaves brought their experience and expertise in coffee production.

====Other European influences====
During the 17th century, Dutch traders settled in Jamaica and they brought sugarcane from Brazil. Also, before and during the Holocaust, Dutch Jews and Polish Jews sought refuge on the island.
Between the late 1700s and 20th century, German Jews, Jews from Curacao, Brazil, British Guiana and Suriname also settled in Jamaica. As such, influences from other Europeans can be found in Jamaican cuisine. Jamaica&#x27;s must-have cooking tool, the Dutch pot or &quot;Dutchie&quot;, was imported from the Netherlands by Dutch traders. It is typically used to cook meat, stew, and pot roast dishes, as well as, to bake bammies and puddings. The coal stove, another important cooking tool used for preparing a wide range of foods like roast breadfruit (especially outdoors), was introduced by Dutch traders during the colonial era. Dishes which have been adopted with Dutch and other European influences include coleslaw, donuts, &quot;coconut rolls&quot;, cinnamon rolls, ginger biscuits, Black Forest cake, raisin bread and marble cakes.

====Middle Eastern influences====
Middle Eastern contributions to Jamaica&#x27;s culinary repertoire began when Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian people, mostly Christians and some Jews, fled to Jamaica in the late 19th century, due to religious persecution under Ottoman rule. Jews from other places such as Egypt also settled on the island. Contingents of Syrian / Lebanese merchants settled in Jamaica and established businesses— as such, Middle Eastern influences can be found in some dishes. Variations of kebabs, wraps, meatballs, pelau, &quot;stuffed grape leaf&quot; rolls (known as &quot;‘mehshi’&quot;) which are made with cabbage as a substitute, hummus, kibbeh, &quot;laban&quot;, tabbouleh and &quot;Syrian bread&quot; have been adopted. Though some of these dishes are not widely prepared by all locals, their influences can be seen in some fusion dishes, and Syrian, Lebanese and kosher restaurants can be found across the island. Jamaican &quot;peanut drops / cake&quot; and &quot;peanut brittle&quot; have Middle Eastern and other influences. Simmering, a popular cooking style in Jewish cuisine is also used for Jamaican stews, and the use of garlic as a primary seasoning is a culinary tradition inherited from the Jews. Local variations of kosher food with a Jamaican twist can be found in Jamaica, and some kosher dishes have been modified by Rastafarians to create ital dishes.

==Jamaican Rastafari cuisine==

Jamaican Rastafari have a holistic vegan approach to preparing food, cooking, and eating, and they have introduced a host of unique vegetarian dishes to Jamaican cuisine. Rastafari dishes are referred to as ital, meaning &quot;natural&quot;, derived from the English word &quot;vital&quot;. Their diet is based on maintaining a balanced life, good health and longevity by consuming fresh, organic and locally-sourced ingredients. Popular ital foods include ackee, lentil, tofu, okra and bean / peas dishes, pumpkin rice, callaloo and other vegetables. Some Rastas adhere to a pescatarian diet, and have adopted kosher dishes. Modern Rastas are blending global plant-based trends with ital roots, creating new fusion dishes such as &quot;jerk hummus&quot;.

==Jamaican food abroad==
Jamaican cuisine is available throughout North America, the United Kingdom, and other places with a sizeable Jamaican population or descendants, such as coastal Central America and the Caribbean. Jamaican food can be found in other regions, and popular dishes often appear on the menus of non-Jamaican restaurants.
In the United States, numerous restaurants are located throughout New York&#x27;s boroughs, Atlanta, West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and other metropolitan areas. In Canada, Jamaican restaurants can be found in the Toronto metropolitan area, as well as Vancouver, Montreal, and Ottawa.

Golden Krust Caribbean Bakery &amp; Grill is a chain of about 120 franchised restaurants found throughout the U.S., which sells Jamaican patties, buns, breads, and other popular Jamaican dishes. They also supply food to several institutions in New York. Juicy Patties, one of Jamaica&#x27;s first patty companies to be established, has also expanded to other regions.

==Other cuisines in Jamaica==

International cuisines have been introduced and blended with Jamaican cuisine,
due to waves of migration from other parts of the world, tourism, the growth of the restaurant and hotel industries, the establishment of businesses (including eateries) by foreigners in Jamaica, and the exposure of locals and the diaspora, particularly Jamaican chefs, to international gastronomy and culinary practices. As such, other cuisines like Latin, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Italian, Greek, French, Spanish, Mediterranean and American cuisines can be found in Jamaica. It is common to find fusion restaurants across the island offering blends of Jamaican foods and beverages with dishes from other cuisines. An array of fusion dishes are created on the island, especially in eateries and hotels, like Jamaican-style tacos, tapas, soul food, pastas, pizzas, calzone (called &quot;pizza patty&quot;), tostadas, paninis, burgers, quesadillas, salads, crêpes, waffles, frittatas, cocktails, desserts and a variety of international epicurean dishes.

<text>Stanley Wellington Finch (July 20, 1872 – 22 November 1951) was the first director of the Bureau of Investigation (1908–1912), which would eventually become the FBI.

== Life ==
Finch was born in Monticello, New York, in 1872. He became a clerk in the United States Department of Justice, where he worked off and on for almost 40 years. Finch rose from the position of clerk to that of chief examiner between 1893 and 1908. While working in the Justice Department, Finch earned his LL.B degree (1908), followed by an LL.M degree (1909) from what is now The George Washington University Law School. He was admitted to the Washington, DC bar in 1911.
Previously, when the Justice Department needed to investigate a crime, it would borrow Secret Service personnel from the Treasury Department. As chief examiner, Finch advocated setting up a squad of detectives within the Justice Department.

Attorney General Charles Joseph Bonaparte created a Special Agent force and gave oversight of the force, later named the Bureau of Investigation (BOI), to Finch. Thus, he created what would become the FBI.

From 1913 to the 1930s, Finch alternated between private employment—primarily in the novelty manufacturing business—and positions in the Justice Department. He finally retired from the Justice Department in 1940.

<text>Kristján Þór Júlíusson (15 July 1957 in Dalvík) is an Icelandic politician, a member of Alþingi and former Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture. He completed degrees in Icelandic, literature and teaching at the University of Iceland but most of his education has been concerned with seamanship. He is a certified steersman and captain and worked in that field for several years. He is married to Guðbjörg Ringsted and they have four children; María, Júlíus, Gunnar and Þorsteinn.

In 1986 he became the mayor of Dalvík for the Independence Party and remained in office until 1994 when he moved to Ísafjörður and took on the job of mayor there until 1997. In the 1998 municipal elections he ran for office in Akureyri and has since been credited for the increased support for the Independence Party in Akureyri at the expense of the Progressive Party, which had been the most powerful in Akureyri for decades. From 1998 to 2006 Kristján was head of a coalition between the Independence Party and the Progressive Party but in the current term the Independence Party forms a coalition with the Social Democratic Alliance.
In January 2007 he stepped down as mayor of Akureyri to run for a seat on Alþingi, which he won.

<doc id="585929" wikidata="Q6570184" url="?curid=585929" title="List of English words of Hindi or Urdu origin">
<text>This is a list of English-language words of Hindi and Urdu origin, two distinguished registers of the Hindustani language (Hindi-Urdu). Many of the Hindi and Urdu equivalents have originated from Sanskrit; see List of English words of Sanskrit origin. Many loanwords are of Persian origin; see List of English words of Persian origin, with some of the latter being in turn of Arabic or Turkic origin. In some cases words have entered the English language by multiple routes - occasionally ending up with different meanings, spellings, or pronunciations, just as with words with European etymologies. Many entered English during the British Raj in colonial India. These borrowings, dating back to the colonial period, are often labeled as &quot;Anglo-Indian&quot;.

<doc id="585950" wikidata="Q309345" url="?curid=585950" title="Maymana">
<text>Maymana (Persian/Uzbek/Pashto: ) is the capital city of Faryab Province in northwestern Afghanistan, near the Afghanistan–Turkmenistan border. It is approximately northwest of the country&#x27;s capital Kabul, and is located on the Maymana River, which is a tributary of the Murghab River. The population of Maymana was 149,040 in 2015, making it one of the largest cities of northwestern Afghanistan.

On 18 March 2014, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives near the entrance to a busy market in Maymana, killing 15 people including women and children and injuring 27 others. The attack came ahead of the presidential elections on 5 April.

On 14 August 2021, Maymana was seized by Taliban fighters, becoming the twenty-second provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban in the wider 2021 Taliban offensive. As of January 2022, however, clashes between Taliban and resistance fighters and protests have been reported in the city.

==Location==
Maymana is located at the northern foot of the Torkestan Range at an elevation of on the old terrace of the Qeysar or Maymana River, which is a right tributary of the Murghab River. The Maymana River branches off of the Band-e Turkistan River 50 km south of the city. The highlands of the Maymana region generally possess a very rich topsoil which supports the seasonal agricultural activities.

==Land use==

Maymana is a trading and transit hub in northern Afghanistan. Just over half of the land in Maymana is non built-up (57%) consisting largely of agriculture. The central districts (2-5) have higher dwelling density and clear road grids. The outer districts (1, 7-10) are characterized by more agricultural land.

==Population==

During the 19th century, the population of the settlement was estimated at 15,000–18,000 families (or roughly 75,000-95,000 individuals) and was assumed to be a dominantly Uzbek city due to the market language which was mostly Chagatai language Uzbek and Pashtun. However, documents show it was a city of different a minority of ethnicities and people such as Turkmens ,Tajiks. In 1958, the population was estimated to be 30,000. By 1979 this had risen to 38,250, and by 1982 to 56,973. Since there was never an official population census, those previous data should not be taken seriously. In 2004, it was estimated that Maymana has a population of 75,900 but was not backed by any evidence. In 2015, the population was estimated to be 149,040 by UN supported observers. Maymana has 10 districts and a total land area of 3,461 hectares. The total number of dwellings in this city are 16,560.

The town is of ancient origin. It seems clear that Maymana citadel dates back to the early Iron Age. Ceramic materials in a nearby cave at Bilchiragh are from the Paleolithic and late Neolithic-Bronze Age. Between 800 B.C and 700 A.D it was part of Median and Persian Empire, as well of Kushanian and Hephtalite, before being subjugated by Arabs during the Islamic Conquest who used local Iranian vassals to rule the region. In the 7th and 8th century it was the residence of the Malik of Guzganan, last Kushanian remnants, which was then under the control of the Farighunid, a native dynasty. From the 9th to 11th century the region was ruled by several rulers and dynasties (Saffarid, Mihrabanid, Nasrid...) from Sistan and then being subjugated by the Iranian Samanid and the Irano-Turkic Ghaznavid and Khwarizm rulers. 

In the 12th and 13th century the region was devastated by nomadic Turks and invading Mongols. It took long for the region, nearly 200 years, to recover from the damage the nomadic and invading Turko-Mongol foreigners from northern Central Asia had caused. The area&#x27;s population remained thin and the commercial trade was very weak but enough for the survivors to develop new agricultural and rebuild old structures. While the city was garrisoned and hosted Iranians and some Arabs, the villages as well owned by Iranians and settled remnants of Arabs, the deserts and steppe were home of wandering nomads of Turko-Mongolian and Iranian stocks (Aymaq). 
In the 16th century, the Turkic Uzbek influence came to Maymana with the invasions of Turkistan and Herat by Muhammad Shaibani. For the region it was again a complicated time. However, Shaibani was defeated by the Iranian Saffavids but the Uzbek elements remained dominant from then up to day in the region until in the 18th and 19th centuries.

During that time the city became the center of the Maimana Khanate and an important centre for commerce, as well as being the gateway to Turkistan from Herat and Iran. It served as an important cultural and trade centre for the whole region and served to connect various different states and peoples. Under the Uzbek rule, the city experienced a sudden renaissance, starting from the conquest of the area by Muhammad Shaibani and lasting all the way down to the Pashtun subjugation of the region. In 1876, under Sher Ali Khan, the city fell to the kingdom of Kabul and was viciosly put in ruins. As result, only ten percent of the population remained alive while a large part either died or left the city for other regions after the horrific slaughter.

In the 20th century, the city was once strongly walled with thick walls and towers and surrounded by a moat, but in the 20th century all this has been reduced to an anonymous mound. In 1934, the rebuilding of the city started, and in 1949 the northern parts of the old city were renewed, the old city citadel changed to a park. Maymana was the administrative center of Meymaneh Province until the disintegration of the province.

As part of the International Security Assistance Force operation in Afghanistan, a Provincial Reconstruction Team led by Norway formerly operated in the province. The team also included Latvian troops.

==Transportation==
Maymana is served by Maymana Airport which had direct flights to Herat as of May 2014.

==Economy==
The town serves an agricultural area irrigated from the Qeysar River and also handles the trade in Karakul sheep with nomads. Maymana is an important livestock centre in Afghanistan. In the 1970s, the wool and cotton processing industry was booming in the city. Maymana is a market for leather goods, silk, carpets, wheat, barley, melons and grapes.

There is also an airport located 2 miles (3.2 km) west of Maymana in a valley surrounded by hills and a range of mountains with some peaks reaching 12,000 ft.; 24 miles (39 km) southeast of the Turkmenistan border; and 64 miles (103 km) south of Andkhoy. The runway is with gravel surface.
Maymana is, after Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif, Jalalabad, Kunduz, and Ghazni, the eighth-largest Afghan town with an independent women-managed radio station, Radio Quyaash, established in February 2005.

==Climate==
Maymana has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.

<doc id="585956" wikidata="Q840430" url="?curid=585956" title="Decoupage">
<text>Decoupage or découpage (; ) is the art of decorating an object by gluing colored paper cutouts onto it in combination with special paint effects, gold leaf, and other decorative elements. Commonly, an object like a small box or an item of furniture is covered by cutouts from magazines or from purpose-manufactured papers. Each layer is sealed with varnishes (often multiple coats) until the &quot;stuck on&quot; appearance disappears and the result looks like painting or inlay work. The traditional technique used 30 to 40 layers of varnish which were then sanded to a polished finish.

Three dimensional &quot;decoupage&quot; (sometimes also referred to simply as decoupage) is the art of creating a three-dimensional (3D) image by cutting out elements of varying sizes from a series of identical images and layering them on top of each other, usually with adhesive foam spacers between each layer to give the image more depth. Pyramid decoupage (also called pyramage) is a process similar to 3D decoupage. In pyramid decoupage, a series of identical images are cut into progressively smaller, identical shapes which are layered and fixed with adhesive foam spacers to create a 3D &quot;pyramid&quot; effect.

A person who does decoupage is known as a decoupeur, or &quot;cutter&quot;.

== Origins ==
The word decoupage comes from Middle French , meaning to cut out or cut from something. The origin of decoupage is thought to be East Siberian tomb art. Nomadic tribes used cut-out felts to decorate the tombs of their deceased. From Siberia, the practice came to China, and by the 12th century, cut out paper was being used to decorate lanterns, windows, boxes and other objects. In the 17th century, Italy, especially Venice, was at the forefront of trade with the Far East and it is generally thought that it is through these trade links that the cut out paper decorations made their way into Europe.

== Florentine decoupage ==

Artisans in Florence, Italy, have produced decorative objects using decoupage techniques since the 18th century. They combined decoupage with other decorative techniques already popular in Florence, such as gilt with gold leaf and carved wood designs. These older techniques were already used to produce articles such as furniture, frames for paintings, and even tooled leather book covers. Known as Florentine style crafts, these items are now highly collectible antiques. Florentine artisans made use of decoupage by adding it to the space within a carved gilt frame, or by adding the decoupage to a wooden plaque. Artisans used pasted reproductions of famous artworks, nearly always religious depictions. Florentine triptychs using decoupage images of such Biblical scenes as the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ are a common motif. As society became more secular in the early 20th century, and non–Roman Catholic tourists began buying more crafts from Florentine artisans, decoupage images became less religious in orientation and more reflective of famous Italian artworks in general.

== Notable decoupeurs ==
* Mary Delany achieved fame at the court of George III and Charlotte during the 18th-century craze for decoupage. At the age of 71 in 1771, Delany began to create cut-out paper artworks of exceptionally-detailed and botanically-accurate depictions of plants, produced using tissue paper and hand-colouration. Delany created 1,700 decoupage pieces, which she called her &quot;Paper &quot;, between the ages of 71 and 88, when her eyesight failed. Her work can be seen in the Enlightenment Gallery at the British Museum.
* Jay (Terry) Jones, a notable decoupeur from Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, holds multiple Guinness World Records for his extensive decoupage collection.
* Richard Basile, a well known New York art collector and entrepreneur, achieved fame as a decoupeur when his intricate floral decorative work was displayed at the festival in Paris in 2014. Basile had developed his collective works over more than a decade while working in the basement study of his parents&#x27; New England home.

* Liz Barker, highly regarded decoupeur known for her distinctive visual style and use of texture. Her work came to prominence during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic with her use of swabs and PPE.

<doc id="585966" wikidata="Q292044" url="?curid=585966" title="AFI Life Achievement Award">
<text>The AFI Life Achievement Award was established by the board of directors of the American Film Institute on February 26, 1973, to honor a single individual for their lifetime contribution to enriching American culture through motion pictures and television. The recipient is selected and honored at an annual ceremony, with the award presented by a master of ceremonies and, recently, the prior year&#x27;s recipient.

The AFI&#x27;s trustees initially specified that &quot;The recipient must be one who fundamentally advanced the art of film and whose achievements had been acknowledge by film scholars, critics, their individual peers and the general public&quot;. The trustees also specified &quot;That the work of the recipient must have withstood the test of time&quot;.

== History of the award ==
Director John Ford was the unanimous choice of the board of trustees for the first award as he &quot;clearly stands preeminent in the history of motion pictures.&quot;
President Richard Nixon attended the gala dinner at which Ford was presented the award on March 31, 1973.

The board of trustees later amended the &quot;test of time&quot; requirement to enable the AFI Life Achievement Award to be presented to individuals with active careers, such as Steven Spielberg.

== Trivia and firsts==
Lillian Gish was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1984, aged 90, becoming the oldest recipient of the prize; Mel Brooks was the oldest male recipient, awarded at age 86 in 2013. Tom Hanks was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2002, becoming the youngest recipient of the prize at age 46 and Meryl Streep was the youngest female, awarded at age 54 in 2004.

Of the 49 honorees eleven have been women: Bette Davis (the first female recipient), Lillian Gish, Barbara Stanwyck, Elizabeth Taylor, Barbra Streisand, Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine, Jane Fonda, Diane Keaton, Julie Andrews, and Nicole Kidman.

Composer John Williams was the first recipient of the award to not be an actor or director.

Three sets of family members have received the award: father and son Kirk and Michael Douglas, father and daughter Henry and Jane Fonda, and siblings Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine.

Julie Andrews&#x27; award event was originally scheduled for April 25, 2020, with a broadcast on May 7 on TNT, but the event was postponed to 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This marks the first time an AFI Life Achievement Award event was delayed. The event was rescheduled for November 11, 2021, before it was postponed a second time on October 4, 2021.

Nicole Kidman’s ceremony was originally scheduled for June 10, 2023, but was postponed due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. Kidman is also the first Australian actress to receive the award, and the third non-American actress to be honored after British stars Elizabeth Taylor and Julie Andrews.

== Televised broadcast ==
All Life Achievement Award ceremonies have been televised on major TV networks and cable channels: CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, USA, TV Land, TNT and TBS. Agreeing to appear at the televised ceremony apparently is part of the AFI&#x27;s criteria for selecting the award. The televised ceremony generates income for the AFI, which is no longer funded by the US government.

== Recipients ==
The American Film Institute has awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award to one person each year since 1973. The 50th Award will be presented to Francis Ford Coppola in Los Angeles on April 26th, 2025.

<doc id="585984" wikidata="Q117467" url="?curid=585984" title="Royal Society of Edinburgh">
<text>The Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE) is Scotland&#x27;s national academy of science and letters. It is a registered charity that operates on a wholly independent and non-partisan basis and provides public benefit throughout Scotland. It was established in 1783. , there are around 1,800 Fellows.

The Society covers a broader range of fields than the Royal Society of London, including literature and history. The Fellowship includes people from a wide range of disciplines: science and technology, arts, humanities, medicine, social science, business, and public service.

==History==

At the start of the 18th century, Edinburgh&#x27;s intellectual climate fostered many clubs and societies (see Scottish Enlightenment). Though there were several that treated the arts, sciences and medicine, the most prestigious was the Society for the Improvement of Medical Knowledge, commonly referred to as the Medical Society of Edinburgh, co-founded by the mathematician Colin Maclaurin in 1731.

Maclaurin was unhappy with the specialist nature of the Medical Society, and in 1737 a new, broader society, the Edinburgh Society for Improving Arts and Sciences and particularly Natural Knowledge, was split from the specialist medical organisation, which then went on to become the Royal Medical Society.

The cumbersome name was changed the following year to the Edinburgh Philosophical Society. With the help of University of Edinburgh professors like Joseph Black, William Cullen and John Walker, this society transformed itself into the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783, and in 1788 it issued the first volume of its new journal &quot;Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh&quot;.

Towards the end of the century, the younger members such as James Hall embraced Lavoisier&#x27;s new nomenclature and the members split over the practical and theoretical objectives of the society. This resulted in the founding of the Wernerian Society (1808–58), a parallel organisation that focused more upon natural history and scientific research that could be used to improve Scotland&#x27;s weak agricultural and industrial base. Under the leadership of Prof. Robert Jameson, the Wernerians first founded &quot;Memoirs of the Wernerian Natural History Society&quot; (1808–21) and then the &quot;Edinburgh Philosophical Journal&quot; (1822, &quot;Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal&quot; from late 1826), thereby diverting the output of the Royal Society&#x27;s &quot;Transactions&quot;. Thus, for the first four decades of the 19th century, the RSE&#x27;s members published articles in two different journals. By the 1850s, the society once again unified its membership under one journal.

During the 19th century, the society contained many scientists whose ideas laid the foundation of the modern sciences. From the 20th century onward, the society functioned not only as a focal point for Scotland&#x27;s eminent scientists but also for the arts and humanities. It still exists today and continues to promote original research in Scotland.

In February 2014, Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell was announced as the society&#x27;s first female president, taking up her position in October.

===The Young Academy of Scotland===
The Young Academy of Scotland was founded by the RSE in 2011. It aims to bring together young professionals (aged mid-20s to 40s) from the widest range of disciplines and regions in Scotland to provide ideas and direction for challenges facing Scotland. The members are roughly equal numbers of women and men, serve for five years and are selected from applicants every two years. In 2021 there were 134 members.

===Location===

The Royal Society has been housed in a succession of locations:
* 1783–1807: College Library, University of Edinburgh
* 1807–1810: Physicians&#x27; Hall, George Street; the home of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh
* 1810–1826: 40–42 George Street; shared with the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland from 1813
* 1826–1908: the Royal Institution (now called the Royal Scottish Academy Building) on the Mound; shared, at first, with the Board of Manufactures (the owners), the Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland
* 1908–1909: University premises at High School Yards
* 1909–present: 22–24 George Street, purchased from the Edinburgh Life Assurance Company with the assistance of a grant of £25,000 from the Scottish Office

==Awards and medals==

===Lord Kelvin Medal===
The Lord Kelvin Medal is the Senior Prize for physical, engineering, and informatics sciences. It is awarded annually to a person who has achieved distinction nationally and internationally, and who has contributed to wider society by the accessible dissemination of research and scholarship. Winners receive a silver medal and are required to deliver a public lecture in Scotland. The award is named after William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin (1824–1907), who was a famous mathematical physicist and engineer, and professor of natural philosophy at the University of Glasgow. Senior Prize-winners are required to have a Scottish connection but can be based anywhere in the world.

===Keith Medal===

The Keith Medal was historically awarded every four years for a scientific paper published in the society&#x27;s scientific journals, preference being given to a paper containing a discovery. It was awarded alternately for papers on mathematics and those on earth and environmental sciences. The medal was founded in 1827 as a result of a bequest by Alexander Keith of Dunnottar, the first treasurer of the Society.

===Lady Margaret Moir Medal (formerly the Makdougall Brisbane Prize)===

The Lady Margaret Moir Medal recognises exceptional achievements in physical, engineering and informatic sciences (including mathematics) by an early career researcher. Awardees are required to have a Scottish connection but can be based anywhere in the world. The prize was founded in 1855 by Thomas Makdougall Brisbane, the long-serving fourth president of the Society. The medal was renamed in 2022 to reflect Margaret Moir&#x27;s contribution to science in Scotland.

===Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize===

The Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize Lectureship is a quadrennial award to recognise original work done by scientists resident in or connected with Scotland. The award was founded in 1887 by Robert Halliday Gunning, a Scottish surgeon, entrepreneur and philanthropist who spent much of his life in Brazil.

==Bruce-Preller Lectures==

This biennial lecture given at the Society was begun in 1931 at the bequest of Charles Preller and named after himself and his late wife, Rachel Steuart Bruce. It is usually (but not invariably) given by a Fellow either of the Royal Society of Edinburgh or the Royal Society of London.

<doc id="585987" wikidata="Q367581" url="?curid=585987" title="McDonnell Douglas DC-X">
<text>The DC-X, short for Delta Clipper or Delta Clipper Experimental, was an uncrewed prototype of a reusable single-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle built by McDonnell Douglas in conjunction with the United States Department of Defense&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) from 1991 to 1993. Starting 1994 until 1995, testing continued through funding of the US civil space agency NASA. In 1996, the DC-X technology was completely transferred to NASA, which upgraded the design for improved performance to create the DC-XA. After a test flight of DC-XA in 1996 resulted in a fire, the project was canceled. Despite its cancellation, the program inspired later reusable launch systems. Michael D. Griffin has since praised the program as &quot;government R&amp;D at its finest.&quot;

==Background==
According to writer Jerry Pournelle: &quot;DC-X was conceived in my living room and sold to National Space Council Chairman Dan Quayle by General Graham, Max Hunter and me.&quot; According to Max Hunter, however, he had tried hard to convince Lockheed Martin of the concept&#x27;s value for several years before he retired. Hunter had written a paper in 1985 entitled &quot;The Opportunity&quot;, detailing the concept of a Single-Stage-To-Orbit spacecraft built with low-cost &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; commercial parts and then available technology, but Lockheed Martin was not interested enough to fund such a program themselves.

On February 15, 1989, Pournelle, Graham and Hunter were able to procure a meeting with Vice-President Dan Quayle. They successfully &quot;sold&quot; the idea to SDIO by noting that any space-based weapons system would need to be serviced by a spacecraft that was far more reliable than the Space Shuttle, and offer lower launch costs and have much better turnaround times.

Given the uncertainties of the design, the basic plan was to produce a deliberately simple test vehicle and to &quot;fly a little, break a little&quot; in order to gain experience with fully reusable quick-turnaround spacecraft. As experience was gained with the vehicle, a larger prototype would be built first for sub-orbital and then orbital tests. Finally a commercially acceptable vehicle would be developed from these prototypes. In keeping with general aircraft terminology, they proposed the small prototype should be called the DC-X, &quot;X&quot; being the US Air Force designation for &quot;experimental&quot;. This would be followed by the &quot;DC-Y&quot;, with &quot;Y&quot; being the USAF designation for pre-production test aircraft and prototypes (e.g. YF-16). Finally the production version would be known as the &quot;DC-1&quot;. The name &quot;Delta Clipper&quot; was chosen to result in the acronym &quot;DC&quot; to draw a connection with the Douglas &quot;DC Series&quot; of airliners, beginning with the Douglas DC-1.

The vehicle is inspired by the designs of McDonnell Douglas engineer Philip Bono, who saw single stage to orbit VTOL lifters as the future of space travel. The Delta Clipper was very similar to Bono&#x27;s SASSTO vehicle from 1967. Bono died less than three months before the DC-X&#x27;s first test flight.

==SDIO requirement==
SDIO wanted a &quot;suborbital, recoverable rocket (SRR) capable of lifting up to 3,000 pounds (1361 kg) of payload to an altitude of 1.5 million feet (457 km); returning to the launch site for a precise soft landing; with the capability to launch for another mission within three to seven days&quot;.

==Design==
Built as a one-third-size scale prototype, the DC-X was never designed to achieve orbital altitudes or velocity, but instead to demonstrate the concept of vertical take off and landing. The vertical take off and landing concept was popular in science fiction films from the 1950s (&quot;Rocketship X-M&quot;, &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, and others), but not seen in real world designs of space vehicles. It would take off vertically like standard rockets, but also land vertically with the nose up. This design used attitude control thrusters and retro rockets to control the descent, allowing the craft to begin atmospheric entry nose-first, but then roll around and touch down on landing struts at its base. The craft could be refueled where it landed, and take off again from exactly the same position — a trait that allowed unprecedented turnaround times.

In theory a base-first re-entry profile would be easier to arrange. The base of the craft would already need some level of heat protection to survive the engine exhaust, so adding more protection would be easy enough. More importantly, the base of the craft is much larger than the nose area, leading to lower peak temperatures as the heat load is spread out over a larger area. Finally, this profile would not require the spacecraft to &quot;flip around&quot; for landing.

The military role made this infeasible, however. One desired safety requirement for any spacecraft is the ability to &quot;abort once around&quot;, that is, to return for a landing after a single orbit. Since a typical low Earth orbit takes about 90 to 120 minutes, the Earth will rotate to the east about 20 to 30 degrees in that time; or for a launch from the southern United States, about . If the spacecraft is launched to the east this does not present a problem, but for the polar orbits required of military spacecraft, when the orbit is complete the spacecraft overflies a point far to the west of the launch site. In order to land back at the launch site, the craft needs to have considerable cross-range maneuverability, something that is difficult to arrange with a large smooth surface. The Delta Clipper design thus used a nose-first re-entry with flat sides on the fuselage and large control flaps to provide the needed cross range capability. Experiments with the control of such a re-entry profile had never been tried, and were a major focus of the project.

Another focus of the DC-X project was minimized maintenance and ground support. To this end, the craft was highly automated and required only three people in its control center (two for flight operations and one for ground support).

==Flight testing==

Construction of the DC-X started in 1991 at McDonnell Douglas&#x27; Huntington Beach facility. The aeroshell was custom-constructed by Scaled Composites, but the majority of the spacecraft was built from commercial off-the-shelf parts, including the engines and flight control systems.

The DC-X first flew, for 59 seconds, on 18 August 1993; it was claimed that it was the first time a rocket had landed vertically on Earth. It flew two more flights 11 September and 30 September, when funding ran out as a side effect of the winding down of the SDIO program; in addition the program was considered far-fetched by detractors. Apollo astronaut Pete Conrad was at the ground-based controls for some flights. These tests were conducted at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.

However, further funding was provided by NASA and the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). The test program restarted on 20 June 1994 with a 136-second flight. The next flight, 27 June 1994, suffered a minor inflight explosion, but the craft successfully executed an abort and autoland. Testing restarted after this damage was fixed, and three more flights were carried out on 16 May 1995, 12 June, and 7 July. On the last flight a hard landing cracked the aeroshell. By this point funding for the program had already been cut, and there were no funds for the needed repairs. The altitude record for the DC-X was 2,500 m, set during its last flight before being upgrading to the DC-XA, on 7 July 1995.

=== DC-XA ===
NASA agreed to take on the program after the last DC-X flight in 1995. In contrast to the original concept of the DC-X demonstrator, NASA applied a series of major upgrades to test new technologies. In particular, the oxygen tank was replaced by a lightweight (alloy 1460 equivalent of alloy 2219) aluminium-lithium alloy tank from Russia, and the hydrogen tank by a graphite-epoxy composite design. The control system was likewise improved. The upgraded vehicle was called the DC-XA, renamed the Clipper Advanced/Clipper Graham, and resumed flight in 1996.

The first flight of the DC-XA test vehicle was made on 18 May 1996 and resulted in a minor fire when the deliberate &quot;slow landing&quot; resulted in overheating of the aeroshell. The damage was quickly repaired and the vehicle flew two more times on 7 and 8 June, a 26-hour turnaround. On the second of these flights the vehicle set its altitude and duration records, and 142 seconds of flight time. Also, during the 8 June flight, the vehicle executed the first planned rotation maneuver for a rocket, where it transitioned from nose first forward flight to controlled backwards flight. At the apex of this rotation maneuver, DC-XA slowed itself by rotating to a backwards orientation, and flew backwards, base first, with its nose 10 degrees below the horizon, under control of the main engines. It then exercised a controlled rotation to a nose up attitude, and executed a powered soft landing. This maneuver showed that a single stage to orbit vehicle could efficiently return from orbit using aerodynamic braking in a forward attitude, and then rotate to a base first powered landing at a spaceport.

Its next flight, on 31 July 1996, proved to be its last. The launch and flight portion of this mission was flawless, however, after slowing to a perfect touchdown, only 3 of the 4 landing struts extended. The vehicle could not balance on 3 struts, and slowly fell sideways on the landing pad. When the side of the vehicle struck the concrete pad, the main liquid oxygen tank cracked open and leaked LOX onto the pad. This LOX contacted a small amount of glowing material on the base heat shield, and started a fire. Post flight inspection of the landing struts revealed that the pneumatic nitrogen actuation line to the failed strut was disconnected. This line was normally disconnected from the strut during pre-flight testing, when each strut was extended and retracted by a ground cart. Normally the structural damage from such a fall would constitute only a setback, but the LOX from the leaking tank fed a fire which severely burned the DC-XA, causing such extensive damage that repairs were impractical.

In a post-accident report, NASA&#x27;s Brand Commission blamed the accident on a burnt-out field crew who had been operating under on-again/off-again funding and constant threats of outright cancellation. The crew, many of them originally from the SDIO program, were also highly critical of NASA&#x27;s &quot;chilling&quot; effect on the program, and the masses of paperwork NASA demanded as part of the testing regimen.

NASA had taken on the project grudgingly after having been &quot;shamed&quot; by its very public success under the direction of the SDIO. Its continued success was cause for considerable political in-fighting within NASA due to it competing with their &quot;home grown&quot; Lockheed Martin X-33/VentureStar project. Pete Conrad priced a new DC-X at $50 million, cheap by NASA standards, but NASA decided not to rebuild the craft in light of budget constraints. Instead, NASA focused development on the Lockheed Martin VentureStar which it felt answered some criticisms of the DC-X, specifically the airplane-like landing of the VentureStar, which many NASA engineers preferred over the vertical landing of the DC-X. Just a few years later, the repeated failure of the Venturestar project, especially the composite LH2 (liquid hydrogen) tank, led to program cancellation.

==Program cost==
The original DC-X was built in 21 months for a cost of $60 million. This is equivalent to $ in present-day terms.

==Legacy==
Several engineers who worked on the DC-X were hired by Blue Origin, and their New Shepard vehicle was inspired by the DC-X design. The DC-X provided inspiration for many elements of Armadillo Aerospace&#x27;s, Masten Space Systems&#x27;s, and TGV Rockets&#x27;s spacecraft designs. Elon Musk stated that the SpaceX Falcon 9 development was &quot;... continuing the great work of the DC-X project.&quot; 

Some NASA engineers have noted that the DC-X could provide a solution for a crewed Mars lander. Had a DC-type craft been developed that operated as an SSTO in Earth&#x27;s gravity well, even if with only a minimum 4–6 crew capacity, variants of it might prove extremely capable for both Mars and Moon missions. Such a variant&#x27;s basic operation would have to be &quot;reversed&quot;; from taking off and then landing, to landing first then taking off. Yet, if this could be accomplished on Earth, the weaker gravity found at both Mars and the Moon would make for dramatically greater payload capabilities, particularly at the latter destination.

Some people proposed design changes include using an oxidizer/fuel combination that does not require the relatively extensive ground support required for the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen that DC-X utilized, and adding a fifth leg for increased stability during and after landing.

<doc id="585993" wikidata="Q1754804" url="?curid=585993" title="Blue Valentine (album)">
<text>Blue Valentine is the sixth studio album by singer and songwriter Tom Waits, released on September 5, 1978, on Asylum Records. It was recorded over the course of six sessions from July to August 1978 with producer Bones Howe. Rickie Lee Jones is pictured with Waits on the back cover.

==Production==
&quot;Blue Valentine&quot; was recorded in six sessions from July 24 to August 26, 1978, at Filmways/Heider Recording, Hollywood, California. Production was by Bones Howe, with second engineers Geoff Howe and Ralph Osborne. Disc mastering was by Terry Dunavan.

All the songs were written by Tom Waits apart from the opening track, &quot;Somewhere&quot;, from the Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
Don Shewey of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found that &quot;Blue Valentine&quot; &quot;is as solid a record as Waits has made&quot;, and that its best songs &quot;rank high among the sentimental sagas that contain Tom Waits&#x27; strongest writing.&quot; Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote that &quot;Waits keeps getting weirder and good for him. As sheer sendup, his &#x27;Somewhere&#x27; beats Sid Vicious&#x27;s &#x27;My Way&#x27; his way. But I&#x27;m not always sure he understands his gift—these lyrics should be funnier. And &#x27;Romeo Is Bleeding,&#x27; easily my favorite among his Chandleroid sagas of tragedy outside the law, is more effective on the jacket than when he underlines its emotional resonance in song. That&#x27;s not weird at all.&quot;

<text>Jacques Bernard Hombron (1798–1852) was a French naval surgeon and naturalist.

Hombron served on the French voyage of the &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and &quot;Zélée&quot; between 1837 and 1840 to investigate the perimeter of Antarctica. He described a number of plants and animals with Honoré Jacquinot. Hombron served as surgeon and botanist on the &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and Honoré Jacquinot was a junior surgeon on the &quot;Zélée&quot;. A botanical account of the expedition was published in: &quot;&quot;Voyage au Pôle Sud et dans l&#x27;Océanie sur les corvettes l&#x27;Astrolabe et la Zélée ... Botanique / par MM. Hombron et Jacquinot&quot;; (2 volumes 1845–1853).

In 1847 Hombron published a two-volume work on his personal and other explorers&#x27; adventures, titled: &quot;Aventures les plus curieuses des voyageurs : coup d&#x27;oeil autour du monde&quot;&quot;. In 1841 Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupré named the plant genus &quot;Hombronia&quot; in his honor.

<doc id="586011" wikidata="Q1754807" url="?curid=586011" title="Small Change (Tom Waits album)">
<text>Small Change is the fourth studio album by singer and songwriter Tom Waits, released on September 21, 1976, on Asylum Records. It was recorded in July at Wally Heider&#x27;s Studio 3 in Hollywood. It was successful commercially and outsold his previous albums. This resulted in Waits putting together a touring band - The Nocturnal Emissions, which consisted of Frank Vicari on tenor saxophone, FitzGerald Jenkins on bass guitar and Chip White on drums and vibraphone. The Nocturnal Emissions toured Europe and the United States extensively from October 1976 till May 1977.

==Production==

&quot;Small Change&quot; was recorded, direct to 2-track stereo tape, July 15, 19–21 and 29, 1976, at Wally Heider&#x27;s Studio 3 in Hollywood under the production of Bones Howe. A multi-track recording was made as back up, and used when a reference Waits made to actress Jayne Meadows had to be changed. Howe recounted: &quot;We set up at Heider&#x27;s for that record the same way I used to make jazz records in the 1950s. I wanted to take Tom back to that direction of making records, with an orchestra and Tom in the same room, all playing and singing together. I was never afraid of making a record where the musicians all breathed the same air. Leakage is not a problem. In fact, it&#x27;s a good thing — it holds a record together... He was always surrounded by the music and the records sound like it. We never used headphones. Never.&quot;

===Music===
The album featured famed drummer Shelly Manne, and was, like Waits&#x27; previous albums, heavily jazz-influenced, with a lyrical style that owed influence to Raymond Chandler and Charles Bukowski as well as a vocal delivery influenced by Louis Armstrong, Dr. John and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. The music, for the most part, consists of Waits&#x27; gravelly, rough voice, set against a backdrop of piano, upright bass, drums and saxophone. Some tracks have a string section, whose sweet timbre is starkly contrasted to Waits&#x27; voice.

&quot;Tom Traubert&#x27;s Blues&quot; opens the album. Jay S. Jacobs has described the song as a &quot;stunning opener [which] sets the tone for what follows.&quot; The refrain is based almost word by word on the 1890 Australian song, &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; by A.B. &quot;Banjo&quot; Paterson, although the tune is slightly different.

The origin of the song is somewhat ambiguous. The sub-title, &quot;Four Sheets to the Wind in Copenhagen&quot;, seems to indicate that it is about a time that Waits spent in Copenhagen in 1976 while on a tour. There, he apparently met Danish singer Mathilde Bondo. Indeed, in a 1998 radio interview, she confirmed that she met Waits and that they spent a night on the town together. Waits himself described the song&#x27;s subject during a concert in Sydney, Australia in March 1979: &quot;Uh, well I met this girl named Matilda. And uh, I had a little too much to drink that night. This is about throwing up in a foreign country.&quot; In an interview on NPR&#x27;s &quot;World Cafe&quot;, aired December 15, 2006, Waits said that Tom Traubert was a &quot;friend of a friend&quot; who died in prison.

Bones Howe, the album&#x27;s producer, recalls when Waits first came to him with the song:

 He said the most wonderful thing about writing that song. He went down and hung around on skid row in L.A. because he wanted to get stimulated for writing this material. He called me up and said, &quot;I went down to skid row ... I bought a pint of rye. In a brown paper bag.&quot; I said, &quot;Oh really?&quot; &quot;Yeah - hunkered down, drank the pint of rye, went home, threw up, and wrote &#x27;Tom Traubert&#x27;s Blues&#x27; [...] Every guy down there ... everyone I spoke to, a woman put him there.&quot;

Howe was amazed when he first heard the song, and he&#x27;s still astonished by it. &quot;I do a lot of seminars,&quot; he says. &quot;Occasionally I&#x27;ll do something for songwriters. They all say the same thing to me. &#x27;All the great lyrics are done.&#x27; And I say, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to give you a lyric that you never heard before. Howe offers the following to his aspiring songwriters: &quot;A battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace / And a wound that will never heal.&quot; This particular Tom Waits lyric Howe considers to be &quot;brilliant.&quot; It&#x27;s &quot;the work of an extremely talented lyricist, poet, whatever you want to say. That is brilliant, brilliant work. And he never mentions the person, but you see the person.&quot;

The song has been recorded by Rod Stewart on two 1993 albums, &quot;Lead Vocalist&quot; and &quot;Unplugged...and Seated&quot; under the title &quot;Tom Traubert&#x27;s Blues (Waltzing Matilda)&quot;.

The album&#x27;s closing song, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Wait to Get Off Work (And See My Baby on Montgomery Avenue)&quot;, has a simple musical arrangement, boasting only Waits&#x27; voice and piano, with bass by Jim Hughart. The lyrics are about Waits&#x27; first job at Napoleone Pizza House in San Diego, which he began in 1965, at the age of 16.

An excerpt of the opening saxophone solo from &quot;Small Change (Got Rained On with His Own .38)&quot; was used for the opening of BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Moviedrome&quot; in 1988, its first season of screening cult films introduced by Alex Cox.

===Themes===

At the time of the recording of &quot;Small Change&quot; Waits was drinking more and more heavily, and life on the road was starting to take its toll on him. Waits, looking back at the period said:I was sick through that whole period [...] It was starting to wear on me, all the touring. I&#x27;d been travelling quite a bit, living in hotels, eating bad food, drinking a lot - too much. There&#x27;s a lifestyle that&#x27;s there before you arrive and you&#x27;re introduced to it. It&#x27;s unavoidable.

Waits recorded the album in reaction to these hardships. This is evident in the pessimism and cynicism that pervade the record, with many songs, such as &quot;The Piano Has Been Drinking&quot; and &quot;Bad Liver and a Broken Heart&quot; presenting a bare and honest portrayal of alcoholism, while also cementing Waits&#x27; hard-living reputation in the eyes of many fans. The album&#x27;s themes include those of desolation, deprivation, and, above all else, alcoholism. The cast of characters, which includes hookers, strippers and small-time losers, are, for the most part, night-owls and drunks; people lost in a cold, urban world.

With the album Waits asserted that he &quot;tried to resolve a few things as far as this cocktail-lounge, maudlin, crying-in-your-beer image that I have. There ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; funny about a drunk [...] I was really starting to believe that there was something amusing and wonderfully American about being a drunk. I ended up telling myself to cut that shit out.&quot;

Beyond the serious themes with which the album deals, the lyrics are often also noted for their humour; with songs such as &quot;The Piano Has Been Drinking&quot; and &quot;Bad Liver And A Broken Heart&quot; including puns and jokes in their treatment of alcoholism, with the added humour in Waits&#x27; drunken diction.

===Cover===
The cover art features Waits sitting in a go-go dancer&#x27;s dressing room, with a topless go-go dancer standing nearby. It was alleged that the go-go dancer pictured is Cassandra Peterson, who portrayed the iconic Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. Peterson, however, says she&#x27;s not sure of the authenticity of this claim, stating, &quot;I can’t say it’s completely not me—I can’t say it’s not true—but I have absolutely no recollection of doing it, if it is true...I do not remember the ’70s, for who-knows-what-all reasons. But anyway, it could be me. There is a possibility. But I just look and look and look at it and go, “It doesn’t look exactly like me.” I don’t know. Maybe it is.&quot; Peterson now asserts it is not her on the cover. Apparently is was an LA showgirl who went by the name of Jinx, who worked at Jumbo&#x27;s Clown Room.

==Reception==
&quot;Small Change&quot; received critical reviews equal to or better than Waits&#x27; previous albums, and was at first a surprise commercial success, rising to No. 89 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart within two weeks of its release. Three weeks later, the album fell off the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200, and Waits was not to better its position until 1999&#x27;s &quot;Mule Variations&quot;.

When asked in an interview with &quot;Mojo&quot; in 1999 if he shared many fans&#x27; view that &quot;Small Change&quot; was the crowning moment of his &quot;beatnik-glory-meets-Hollywood-noir period&quot; (i.e. from 1973 to 1980), Waits replied: Well, gee. I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s probably more songs off that record that I continued to play on the road, and that endured. Some songs you may write and record but you never sing them again. Others you sing em every night and try and figure out what they mean. &quot;Tom Traubert&#x27;s Blues&quot; was certainly one of those songs I continued to sing, and in fact, close my show with.

In 2000, &quot;Small Change&quot; was voted number 958 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

<text>Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited ( ), commonly referred to as Deloitte, is a British multinational professional services network based in London, England. Deloitte is the largest professional services network by revenue and number of employees in the world and is one of the Big Four accounting firms, along with EY, KPMG, and PwC.

The firm was founded by William Welch Deloitte in London, England in 1845 and expanded into the United States in 1890. It merged with Haskins &amp; Sells to form Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells in 1972 and with Touche Ross in the US to form Deloitte &amp; Touche in 1989. In 1993, the international firm was renamed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, later abbreviated to Deloitte. In 2002, Arthur Andersen&#x27;s practice in the UK as well as several of that firm&#x27;s practices in Europe and North and South America agreed to merge with Deloitte. Subsequent acquisitions have included Monitor Group, a large strategy consulting business, in January 2013. The international firm is a UK private company, limited by guarantee, supported by a network of independent legal entities.

Deloitte provides audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk advisory, tax, and legal services with approximately 457,000 employees globally, and operates in over 150 countries. In FY 2023, the network earned revenues of US$64.9 billion in aggregate. The firm has sponsored a number of activities and events including the 2012 Summer Olympics.

There have been a number of controversies surrounding the firm, including Deloitte&#x27;s involvement in a &quot;potentially misleading&quot; report on illicit tobacco trading in Australia. The company suffered a major cyberattack in September 2017, causing a breach in client confidentiality and publicizing a significant amount of employee information. Deloitte has also been subject to litigation regarding several of its audits.

==History==
===Early history===
In 1845, William Welch Deloitte opened an office in London, England. Deloitte was the first person to be appointed an independent auditor of a public company, namely the Great Western Railway. He went on to open an office in New York in 1880.

In 1890, Deloitte opened a branch office on Wall Street headed by Edward Adams and P.D. Griffiths as branch managers. This was Deloitte&#x27;s first overseas venture. Other branches were soon opened in Chicago and Buenos Aires. In 1898 P.D. Griffiths returned from New York and became a partner in the London office.

In 1896, Charles Waldo Haskins and Elijah Watt Sells formed Haskins &amp; Sells in New York. It was later described as &quot;the first major auditing firm to be established in the country by American rather than British accountants&quot;.

In 1898, George Touche established an office in London and then, in 1900, joined John Ballantine Niven in establishing the firm of Touche Niven in the Johnston Building at 30 Broad Street in New York.

On 1 March 1933, Colonel Arthur Hazelton Carter, President of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants and managing partner of Haskins &amp; Sells, testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking and Currency. Carter helped convince Congress that independent audits should be mandatory for public companies.

In 1947, Detroit accountant George Bailey, then president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, launched his own organization. The new entity enjoyed such a positive start that in less than a year, the partners merged with Touche Niven and A. R. Smart to form Touche, Niven, Bailey &amp; Smart. Headed by Bailey, the organization grew rapidly, in part by creating a dedicated management consulting function. It also forged closer links with organizations established by the co-founder of Touche Niven, George Touche: the Canadian organization Ross and the British organization George A. Touche. In 1960, the firm was renamed Touche, Ross, Bailey &amp; Smart, becoming Touche Ross in 1969. In 1968 Nobuzo Tohmatsu formed Tohmatsu Aoki &amp; Co, a firm based in Japan that was to become part of the Touche Ross network in 1975. In 1972 Robert Trueblood, Chairman of Touche Ross, led the committee responsible for recommending the establishment of the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

In 1972, Deloitte&#x27;s firm (by then known as Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths &amp; Co.) merged with Haskins &amp; Sells to form Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells.

In 1989, Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells merged with Touche Ross in the US to form Deloitte &amp; Touche. The merged firm was led jointly by J. Michael Cook and Edward A. Kangas. Led by the UK partnership, a smaller number of Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells member firms rejected the merger with Touche Ross and shortly thereafter merged with Coopers &amp; Lybrand to form Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte (later to merge with Price Waterhouse to become PwC). Some member firms of Touche Ross also rejected the merger with Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells and merged with other firms. In the UK, Touche Ross merged with Spicer &amp; Oppenheim in 1990.

===Recent history===
At the time of the US-led mergers to form Deloitte &amp; Touche, the name of the firm was a problem, because there was no worldwide exclusive access to the names &quot;Deloitte&quot; or &quot;Touche Ross&quot; – key member firms such as Deloitte in the UK and Touche Ross in Australia had not joined the merger. The name DRT International was therefore chosen, referring to Deloitte, Ross and Tohmatsu. In 1993, the international firm was renamed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.

In 1995, the partners of Deloitte &amp; Touche decided to create Deloitte &amp; Touche Consulting Group (now known as Deloitte Consulting).

==Name and branding==
In 1989, Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells merged in most countries with Touche Ross, forming Deloitte &amp; Touche. However, in the United Kingdom, the local firm of Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells merged instead with Coopers &amp; Lybrand (now part of PwC).

While the full name of the UK private company is Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, in 1989, it initially branded itself as DTT International. In 2003, the rebranding campaign was commissioned by William G. Parrett, the then-CEO of DTT, and led by Jerry Leamon, the global Clients and Markets leader.

According to the company website, Deloitte now refers to the brand under which independent firms throughout the world collaborate to provide audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk management, and tax services to selected clients.

In 2008, Deloitte adopted its new &quot;Always One Step Ahead&quot; (AOSA) brand positioning platform to support the existing Deloitte vision: &quot;To be the Standard of Excellence&quot;. AOSA represents the global organization&#x27;s value proposition and is never used as a tagline. The recent launch of the Green Dot ad campaign also aligns with Deloitte&#x27;s brand strategy and positioning framework.

In June 2016, Deloitte changed its branding and adopted a new logo, with Deloitte written in black color instead of the earlier blue.

In India, Deloitte operates under several brand names, including A.F.Ferguson &amp;Co., A.F.Ferguson Associates, S.B.Billimoria, C.C.Choksi &amp; Co., P.C.Hansotia, Fraser &amp; Ross and Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells (India).

==Legal structure==
For many years, the organization and its network of member firms were legally organized as a Swiss (the equivalent of an unincorporated association). As of 31 July 2010, members of the &quot;Verein&quot; became part of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (DTTL), a UK private company limited by guarantee without share capital. Each member firm in its global network remains a separate and independent legal entity, subject to the laws and professional regulations of the particular country or countries in which it operates.

This structure is similar to other professional services networks which seek to limit vicarious liability for acts of other members. As separate and legal entities, DTTL and its member firms cannot obligate each other. Professional services continue to be provided by member firms only and not DTTL. With this structure, the members should not be liable for the negligence of other independent members. This structure also allows them to be members of the IFAC Forum of Firms.

In 2019, the U.K. partners in the firm received average pay of £882,000. In 2023, the average income of Deloitte partners in the U.K. topped £1,000,000 for the third year in a row.

==Services==
Deloitte member firms offer services in the following functions, with country-specific variations on their legal implementation (i.e., all operating within a single company or through separate legal entities operating as subsidiaries of an umbrella legal entity for the country).

===Audit===
Audit provides the organization&#x27;s traditional accounting and audit services, as well as internal auditing, IT control assurance and Media &amp; Advertising Assurance.

Investors in Guangdong Kelon Electrical Holdings Company Limited have claimed that there was a failure to alert them to the company&#x27;s poor financial position. Deloitte claims it did a good job on the project. Deloitte&#x27;s global CEO defended the firm&#x27;s work on the Kelon matter. The firm was the auditor for thirty months from 2002 to 2004. It qualified its opinion in 2004 as to company sales, returns, and allowances. The firm resigned from the Kelon account after completing the 2004 audit. Deloitte said it resigned from the account because management at the client was not committed to best practices in finance.

===Consulting===
Consulting assists clients by providing services in the offering areas of strategy, analytics and M&amp;A, customer and marketing, core business operations, human capital, and enterprise technology and performance. Consulting is Deloitte&#x27;s largest business, bringing over 40% of total revenues in 2021.

In &quot;An American Sickness&quot; (2017), Dr. Elisabeth Rosenthal attributed to Deloitte a key role in counseling the adoption of &quot;strategic billing&quot; as a way of increasing revenues from hospital business. She dates this development from 2005, when Deloitte hired Tommy Thompson, former secretary of health and human services, as chairman of its global healthcare practice. In 2011, Deloitte was ranked No. 1 by revenue in all areas of healthcare consulting—life sciences, payer, provider, and government health.

The firm implemented the SAP HR system for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) for $95 million and because of faults in the system, some teachers were underpaid, overpaid, or not paid at all. As of 31 December 2007, LAUSD had incurred a total of $140 million in payments to Deloitte to get the system working properly. In 2008, there was some evidence that the payroll issues had started to stabilize with errors below 1% according to LAUSD&#x27;s chief operating officer.

The firm worked on a statewide case management system for the California Judicial Council which originally had a budget of around $260 million. Almost $500 million had been spent and costs were at one time projected to potentially run as high as $2 billion. No single court became fully operational. California&#x27;s Judicial Council terminated the project in 2012 citing actual deployment costs associated with the project and California&#x27;s budget concerns.

===Financial advisory===
Financial advisory provides corporate finance services to clients, including dispute, personal and commercial bankruptcy, forensics, e-discovery, document review, advisory, mergers &amp; acquisitions, capital projects consulting and valuation services.

===Tax and legal===
Tax and legal helps clients increase their net asset value, undertake the transfer pricing and international tax activities of multinational companies, minimize their tax liabilities, implement tax computer systems, and provides advisory of tax implications of various business decisions.

In November 2013, the international development charity ActionAid accused Deloitte of advising large businesses on how they could use Mauritius to avoid potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of tax in some of the poorest countries in Africa. Deloitte responded by saying that, in the absence of the double-taxation treaties, they advise their clients to avail themselves of arrangements that could result in less taxes being paid to the countries in question. Deloitte also said it was wrong to say it is tax avoidance to make use of provisions in double tax treaties and that without such treaties investment might be reduced.

===GovLab===
GovLab is the internal think tank of Deloitte Consulting LLP&#x27;s Federal Government consulting practice, focused on innovation and government reform. Created in 2010, GovLab is based at New York University in New York, New York, and typically undertakes eight or nine research topics per year, focusing on how future trends, technologies, and business models will affect government.

==Offices==
Deloitte operates across the world in more than 700 locations and over 150 countries, with nearly 457,000 employees as of 2023.

===Operations in India===
In the late 1990s, Deloitte commenced operations in India, at the same time as another large auditing firm KPMG. In India, ICAI regulations do not permit foreign firms to carry out audits in India. Hence Deloitte carries out audits in India under the name of C.C.Chokshi &amp; Co., an existing auditing firm that it arranged an agreement with in 1998. In 1992, after India was forced to liberalise under one of the conditions of the World Bank and IMF sponsored bail out, Deloitte was granted a license to operate in India. In 2004, A. F. Ferguson &amp; Co., which has been in India for 110 years, joined Deloitte, following CC Chokshi &amp; Company, Fraser &amp; Ross, PC Hansotia &amp; Company and SB Billimoria &amp; Company.

In India, Deloitte has two entities: Deloitte India and Deloitte US-India (USI), which is a region within the Deloitte US organization. Deloitte India caters to clients within India, while Deloitte USI is an entity of Deloitte US that is geographically located in India and caters to clients of the US member firm.

Deloitte Partners who led the audit were accused of failing to correct false and misleading information filed with the FRRP, and otherwise failing to act with objectivity during the course of the audit. The FRC&#x27;s action followed legal proceedings in the US that found former Autonomy executive Sushovan Hussain guilty of fraud earlier that month.

The ruling was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal in January 2016, but in December 2017, the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;Deloitte &amp; Touche v Livent Inc (Receiver of)&quot; allowed an appeal in part, declaring that liability existed only in respect of Deloitte&#x27;s negligence in conducting the audit for Livent&#x27;s 1997 fiscal year, and accordingly reduced the amount of damages awarded to $40,425,000.

=== Mitie plc ===

=== SIG plc ===

In August 2012, Deloitte Financial Advisory Services (DFAS) publicly denied that as the official internal auditors for Standard Chartered, it helped the bank cover up money laundering operations related to Iran which were earning the bank significant profits by &quot;intentionally omitting critical information&quot;. DFAS paid the state of New York a $10 million settlement, was required not to take on new business for one year from designated New York banks, and was required to implement reforms in order to prevent similar problems in the future. The state regulator stated that there was no evidence DFAS intentionally helped Standard Chartered launder money.

=== Steinhoff International ===
In June 2018, Dutch investors&#x27; organisation VEB instituted class action legal proceedings against Deloitte&#x27;s Dutch affiliate on behalf of shareholders who suffered losses as a result of the fraud committed by Steinhoff International. VEB claimed that Deloitte was liable for deficiencies in the audit of Steinhoff.

In October 2020, VEB withdrew its case after the Dutch and South African Deloitte firms agreed to contribute a combined €70 million towards a combined settlement offered by Steinhoff to settle all claims against Steinhoff as a result of the fraud.

==Litigation and regulatory action - consulting and oversight==
===Canadian Bar Association===
In September 2003, Deloitte reported to the Canadian Bar Association (CBA) that motor vehicle accident insurance claims for bodily injury had been declining since 1999 adjusted for inflation. This contradicted the government&#x27;s and industry&#x27;s argument that general damages for soft-tissue injury had to be capped at $4,000. Within hours of release, a member of Deloitte was communicating with Insurance Bureau of Canada without the knowledge of CBA (their client) and providing confidential information. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Alberta found Deloitte guilty of unprofessional conduct and fined the firm $40,000.

=== Eskom ===
In October 2019, South African power utility Eskom announced that it was suing Deloitte&#x27;s South African affiliate, Deloitte Consulting, in order to recover R207 million paid for two consulting contracts that were improperly-awarded in 2016. According to the court affidavit filed in the Johannesburg High Court by Eskom chairperson Jabu Mabuza, in one of the contracts awarded to Deloitte, Deloitte bid R88.8-million while the bids from other consulting firms were R14.6-million and R13.3-million. In the second contract, Deloitte bid R79.1-million, and the competing bids were R16-million and R9.1-million.

In an interview with AmaBhungane, Deloitte Consulting&#x27;s managing director for Africa, Thiru Pillay, claimed that Eskom was trying to bully Deloitte into a settlement, He further stated that Deloitte had not conceded to being “complicit with irregular procurement” and denied &quot;any undertone of corruption&quot; with regards to the Eskom contracts.

On 21 March 2020, Eskom announced that Deloitte and Eskom had reached an out of court settlement in which Deloitte agreed to pay back R150 million of the R207 million originally sought by Eskom. In a joint statement released by Eskom and Deloitte, the parties agreed that there was no evidence of corruption in the deal, and that there were &quot;technical irregularities&quot; in the procurement process.

In April 2020, Deloitte told AmaBhungane that two directors, Pillay, as well as lead consultant on the Eskom contracts, Shamal Sivasanker, had resigned from the firm effective 31 March 2020.

In November 2021, Eskom announced that Deloitte had been selected as Eskom&#x27;s new external auditor, after the expiration of its contract with Grant Thornton.

Deloitte-China, also known as Deloitte Hua Yong, self-reported the deficiencies found in 12 fiscal year 2018 audits. Auditors asked clients to prepare their own paperwork to show that Deloitte-China had completed audits in at least 21 instances, creating the illusion that it followed relevant requirements when there was no evidence of it doing so. For nine clients with operations in China, Deloitte&#x27;s US office also outsourced its audit work to Deloitte China.

==Controversies==
===Australian tobacco industry===
In 2011, Deloitte was commissioned by the tobacco industry to compile a report on illicit tobacco. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service officials called the report &quot;potentially misleading&quot;, and raised concerns about the &quot;reliability and accuracy&quot; of the data. When a second Deloitte report focusing on counterfeit cigarettes was released, Home Affairs Minister Brendan O&#x27;Connor described the second report as &quot;baseless and deceptive&quot; and &quot;bogus&quot;. Public health officials criticised Deloitte&#x27;s decision to conduct the research, as it added credibility to the tobacco industry&#x27;s effort to undermine the Australian Government&#x27;s plain cigarette packaging legislation.

===COVID-19 vaccine website and patent infringement===
Deloitte was awarded a $44 million no-bid contract by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States to build a website to manage scheduling, inventory, and reporting for COVID-19 vaccination. However, the website functioned poorly, leading very few states to adopt it for their vaccination management.

In August 2020, a patent attorney for Tiffany Tate, the executive director of the Multi-State Partnership for Prevention (MSPP), issued a cease and desist letter accusing Deloitte and the CDC of stealing Tate&#x27;s intellectual property for a mass vaccination tracker for use in tracking vaccinations for COVID-19. Tate had earlier demonstrated software to the CDC that would help automate key aspects of delivering mass vaccinations. Deloitte was present during that presentation and was identified by the CDC as a consultant. Under the Trump administration, the CDC awarded a no bid contract to Deloitte to build a vaccine administration management system, even though MSPP had offered such a system at a lower price. Later, the CDC awarded a second contract to Deloitte, with both contracts totaling 43.9 million. Tate&#x27;s attorney said that Deloitte&#x27;s system &quot;has the identical structure, mirrors the functionality, and duplicates the same features&quot; as MSPP&#x27;s system. The attorney also commented that Deloitte tried to hire Ms. Tate to work on the project.

===E-mail hack===
In September 2017, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Deloitte suffered a cyberattack that breached the confidentiality of its clients and 244,000 staff, allowing the attackers to access &quot;usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information&quot;. Reportedly, Deloitte had stored the affected data in Microsoft&#x27;s Azure cloud hosting service, without two-step verification. The attackers were thought to possibly have had access from as early as October 2016. Brian Krebs reported that the breach affected all of Deloitte&#x27;s email and administrative user accounts. A later report by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; repeated Deloitte&#x27;s statement that only a few clients were affected. Deloitte said that neither its services nor its clients&#x27; businesses were disrupted. Deloitte reportedly first noticed suspicious activity in April 2017. Deloitte said that no sensitive information was compromised and that its investigators were eventually able to read every email obtained by the hackers.

In October 2017, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that client accounts compromised in the breach included, but were not limited to, the US Department of Defense, the US Department of Homeland Security, the US State Department, the US Department of Energy, mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the US Postal Service. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issued statements saying they were not affected by the attack and denied that any of their data was compromised.

Deloitte said that it immediately contacted legal authorities and six clients. Deloitte also increased security measures on the advice of both internal and external experts. As of October 2017, the New York attorney general&#x27;s office was investigating the hack.

===Carillion===
Deloitte had acted as internal auditor at construction and services giant Carillion before it went into liquidation in January 2018. The &quot;excoriating&quot; and &quot;damning&quot; (&quot;The Guardian&quot;) final report of the Parliamentary inquiry into Carillion&#x27;s collapse was published on 16 May 2018, and criticised Deloitte for its involvement in the company&#x27;s financial reporting practices:
The select committee chairs (Frank Field and Rachel Reeves) called for a complete overhaul of Britain&#x27;s corporate governance regime, accusing the big four accounting firms of operating as a &quot;cosy club&quot;. Deloitte said it was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the committees&#x27; conclusions regarding its role as internal auditors, but would take on board any lessons that could be learned from Carillion&#x27;s collapse.

=== US unemployment portals ===
Deloitte Consulting has been heavily involved in building unemployment insurance web portals across various US states, including Ohio, Colorado and Illinois. In May 2020, following a wave of applications resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, it was revealed that major security weaknesses existed in the web portals of these states. Personal information of unemployed applicants, including addresses and Social Security numbers, was exposed and viewable by the public. Following the revelation, proposed class actions were filed against the company.

The controversy follows similar short-fallings in Florida&#x27;s unemployment portal. The CONNECT site, designed by Deloitte, was described as a &quot;colossal failure&quot; as it was created over-budget, delivered late, and did not work. Again, individuals laid off during the COVID pandemic were particularly vulnerable as they were out of jobs and unable to receive unemployment assistance. In May 2020, an investigation was ordered by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, finding that Deloitte ran insufficient stress testing.

=== Tingo ===
A Deloitte network firm named Brightman Almagor Zohar &amp; Co., sometimes known as Deloitte Israel, gave an unqualified audit opinion on the accounts of Tingo Group, Inc for 2022. This became controversial when a report by Hindenburg Research identified &quot;obvious errors&quot; in Tingo&#x27;s financials, making Hindenburg &quot;suspect Deloitte Israel missed or rushed through procedures that would have uncovered important findings&quot;, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Tingo Group and others of a fraud of &quot;staggering&quot; scope.

In May 2017, Deloitte entered into a partnership with McLaren Applied Technologies (MAT) to combine Deloitte&#x27;s experience in delivering large consulting projects and MAT&#x27;s experience of engineering, sensors, simulation and analytical analysis. Prior to this, MAT had entered into a similar partnership with competitor KPMG in a ten-year deal in 2014 but it was terminated by KPMG in 2017. The partnership was later extended to MAT sister company McLaren Racing in June 2020 where Deloitte will work with McLaren to enhance the performance of the team and its cars. In May 2023, Deloitte and McLaren Racing signed a multi-year partnership extension.

In May 2022, Deloitte signed a three-year sponsorship deal worth more than USD300,000 with the Football Association of Singapore to be the first title sponsor of the Singapore Women’s Premier League as the Deloitte Women&#x27;s Premier League.

<doc id="586017" wikidata="Q214949" url="?curid=586017" title="Heinrich von Brühl">
<text>Heinrich, Count von Brühl (, 13 August 170028 October 1763), was a Polish-Saxon statesman at the court of Saxony and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and a member of the powerful German von Brühl family. The incumbency of this ambitious politician coincided with the decline of both states. Brühl was a skillful diplomat and cunning strategist, who managed to attain control over Saxony and Poland, partly by controlling its king, Augustus III, who ultimately could only be accessed through Brühl himself.

Polish historian and writer Józef Ignacy Kraszewski wrote a novel under the title &quot;Count Brühl&quot;, in which he described Heinrich as an oppressive and stubborn dictator, who, with greed, but also great determination, unsuccessfully attempted to gain control of the entire nation.

It is widely believed that Brühl had Europe&#x27;s largest collection of watches and military vests; attributed to him was also a vast collection of ceremonial wigs, hats and the largest collection of Meissen porcelain in the world. He had also one of the biggest collection of kabbala books in Europe.

==Career==

Brühl was born in Gangloffsömmern the son of Johann Moritz von Brühl, a noble who held the office of the &quot;Oberhofmarschall&quot; at the court of Saxe-Weissenfels (ruled by a cadet branch of the Albertine House of Wettin), by his first wife Erdmuth Sophie v. d. Heide. His father was ruined and compelled to part with his family estate, which passed into the hands of the prince. Under Duke Christian of Saxe-Weissenfels von Brühl was first placed as page with the dowager duchess, and was then received at her recommendation into the court of the Electorate of Saxony at Dresden as a &quot;Silberpage&quot; on 16 April 1719. He rapidly acquired the favour of the Elector Frederick Augustus I of Wettin, surnamed the Strong, who, in 1697, had been elected King of Poland (as Augustus II). Brühl was largely employed in procuring money for his extravagant master. He became Chief Receiver of Taxes and Minister of the Interior of Saxony in 1731.

He was at Warsaw when his master died in 1733, and obtained the confidence of the Prince-Elector Frederick Augustus II, who was at Dresden at the time, by acquiring the papers and jewels of his late father and bringing them promptly to his successor. Von Brühl raised money to secure the election of Frederick Augustus II as Polish king (Augustus III the Saxon), who in the following War of the Polish Succession prevailed against his rival Stanisław I.

During most of the thirty years of the ineffective reign of August III the Saxon, he was the major confidant of the king and the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Saxon court. Reichsgraf since 27 November 1737, he had to acquiesce to the influence of old servants of the electoral house for a time, but after 1738 he was in effect sole minister, a position for which he actually had neither the skills nor the knowledge. The title of a Prime Minister was created for him in 1746, but as a classic court favourite his power extended beyond that office. Besides securing huge grants of land for himself, he acquired numerous titles, and he drew the combined salaries of these offices. He also worked closely with Bishop Kajetan Sołtyk of Kraków.

Brühl had cunning and skill sufficient to govern his master and get rid of his rivals and succeeded in keeping everybody at a distance from the king. No servant entered the king&#x27;s service without the consent of Brühl, and even when the king went to the chapel all approach to him was prevented. A typical interaction of the king with Brühl has the king loitering about smoking, and asking, without looking at his favorite, &quot;Brühl, have I any money?&quot; &quot;Yes, sire,&quot; was the continual answer, and to satisfy the king&#x27;s demands, Brühl exhausted the state, plunged the country into debts and greatly reduced the army.

Brühl kept 200 domestics; his guards were better paid than those of the king himself, and his table more sumptuous. Frederick II said of him, &quot;Brühl had more garments, watches, laces, boots, shoes and slippers, than any man of the age. Caesar would have counted him among those curled and perfumed heads which he did not fear.&quot;

==Politics==

Brühl was a capable diplomat, who played a vital role in the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756 and the convergence of Habsburgs and France. However he was wholly responsible for a ruinous fiscal policy which decisively weakened the position of Saxony within the Holy Roman Empire between 1733 and 1763; for the mistaken ambition which led Frederick Augustus II to become a candidate for the throne of Poland, which led to a civil war and did sustainable damage to the Polish sovereignty; for the engagements into which he entered in order to secure the support of Emperor Charles VI of Habsburg; for the shameless and ill-timed tergiversations of Saxony during the War of the Austrian Succession; for the intrigues which entangled the Electorate in the alliance against King Frederick II of Prussia, which led to the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War; and for the waste and want of foresight which left the bankrupt country utterly unprepared to resist the immediate attack of the Prussian king.

At the beginning of the Seven Years&#x27; War the Saxon army comprised but 17,000 men. After a few weeks, the decimated army, under Frederick Augustus Rutowsky, was compelled to surrender at Pirna from want of the necessary supplies. The army was dissolved, while Saxony remained a war theatre.

Brühl was not only without political or military capacity, but was so garrulous that he could not keep a secret. His indiscretion was repeatedly responsible for the king of Prussia&#x27;s discoveries of the plans laid against him. Nothing could shake the confidence of his master, which survived the ignominious flight into Bohemia, into which he was trapped by Brühl at the time of the Battle of Kesselsdorf, and all the miseries of the Seven Years&#x27; War. They fled with the pictures and the china, but the archives of the state were left to the victor.

The favourite abused the confidence of his master shamelessly. Not content with the 67,000 &quot;talers&quot; a month which he drew as salary for his innumerable offices, he was found when an inquiry was held in the next reign to have abstracted more than five million &quot;talers&quot; of public money for his private use. He left the work of the government offices to be done by his lackeys, whom he did not even supervise.

==Legacy==

Brühl died at Dresden on 28 October 1763, having survived his master only for a few weeks. The new elector, Frederick Christian caused an inquiry to be held into his administration. His fortune including large palaces at Pförten (present-day Brody), Oberlichtenau and Wachau-Seifersdorf was found to amount to a million and a half &quot;talers&quot;, and was sequestered but afterwards restored to his family. The inquiry showed that Brühl owed his immense fortune to the prodigality of the king rather than to unlawful means of accumulation.

His profusion was often beneficial to the arts and sciences. The famous Meissen porcelain Swan Service was made for him, with over 2,200 pieces, now dispersed to collections around the world. In 1736 the architect Johann Christoph Knöffel had begun to build a city palace and terrace for the count on the bank of the Elbe in the heart of Dresden. This was originally called &quot;Brühl&#x27;s Garden&quot; and is today known as Brühl&#x27;s Terrace. The Brühl Palace at Warsaw was rebuilt according to the designs by Joachim Daniel von Jauch from 1754 to 1759.
Brühl was a dedicated collector and protector of the arts - Francesco Algarotti called him a Maecenas. He owned a large gallery of pictures, which was bought by Empress Catherine II of Russia in 1768, and his library of 70,000 volumes was one of the biggest private libraries in the Holy Roman Empire.

Brühl was portrayed by Johannes Riemann in the 1941 film &quot;Friedemann Bach&quot;.

==Family==
He married countess Franziska von Kolowrat-Krakowska on 29 April 1734. She was born into one of the most powerful noble houses of Bohemian origin and was a favourite of the wife of Frederick Augustus. Four sons and a daughter survived him. His eldest son, Alois Friedrich von Brühl, was also a Saxon politician, and a soldier and dramatist as well. His daughter Maria Amalia married Polish count, Jerzy August Mniszech of Dukla. His youngest son, Hans Moritz von Brühl (1746–1811), was before the Revolution of 1789 a colonel in the French service, and afterwards general inspector of roads in Brandenburg and Pomerania. By his wife Margarethe Schleierweber, the daughter of a French corporal, and renowned for her beauty and intellectual gifts, he was the father of Carl von Brühl who as intendant-general of the Prussian royal theatres was of some importance in the history of the development of drama in Germany. Another granddaughter was Marie von Brühl, who married Carl von Clausewitz.

Heinrich von Brühl also had a nephew named Hans Moritz von Brühl, the same as that of his youngest son. The nephew was a diplomat and astronomer, and lived much of his life in England.

<text>Vidovdan (, ) is a Serbian national and religious holiday, a &quot;slava&quot; (feast day) celebrated on 28 June (Gregorian calendar), or 15 June according to the Julian calendar. The Serbian Church designates it as the memorial day to &quot;Saint Prince Lazar and the Serbian holy martyrs&quot; who fell during the Battle of Kosovo against the Ottoman Empire on 15 June 1389 (according to the Julian calendar). It is an important part of Serb ethnic and Serbian national identity.

==History==
The day became highly regarded by Serbs after the fourteenth century when the Battle of Kosovo took place on Saint Vitus Day in 1389. A Serb-led Christian coalition by Prince Lazar fought the Ottoman army on the Kosovo field. Although the battle itself was inconclusive, and both Sultan Murad and Prince Lazar were slain, it led to the Ottoman conquest of Serbian principalities. After the Great Migrations of the Serbs in 1690, Vidovdan became a day to honor those who fought in the battle and fell &quot;for their faith and homeland&quot;. The holiday was institutionalized by the church in 1849 and politically and publicly first celebrated in 1851 as a representation of the struggle for Serbian freedom from Ottoman subjection. It slowly achieved popularity with the growth of national identities in Europe in the nineteenth century and came to be known as a day of remembrance. After 1918, the Yugoslav government designated Vidovdan as a day of remembrance to honor all those who died in war, particularly those of the Balkan Wars and World War I.

There are significant events which coincidentally or intentionally occurred on Vidovdan:

* Serbian declaration of war against the Ottoman Empire in 1876 (from 1800 to 1899, Vidovdan was celebrated on 15 June Julian = 27 June Gregorian)
* Signing of the Austro–Serbian Alliance of 1881 (this occurred on 16 June Julian = 28 June Gregorian, the day after Vidovdan)
* Assassination of the Austro-Hungarian crown prince, Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip in 1914 which triggered the First World War (from 1900 to 2099, Vidovdan is celebrated on 15 June Julian = 28 June Gregorian)
* Signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919
* The Serbian King Alexander I&#x27;s proclamation of the new 1921 Constitution of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, known thereafter as the Vidovdan Constitution (&quot;Vidovdanski ustav&quot;).
* The Cominform Resolution calling for regime change in Yugoslavia is published in 1948 on Soviet initiative.
* On the 600th anniversary of the battle of Kosovo (1989), Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević delivered the Gazimestan speech on the site of the battle. This was the first public celebration of Vidovdan since the Yugoslav communist era.
* During Operation Corridor 92, the VRS took back Modriča on 28 June 1992.

Beginning in the late 19th century, Serbian publications began to appear in Serbian literature promoting the idea that the holiday originated from the Slavic god Svetovit. The first to put forth such a view was Natko Nodilo, who attributed the cult of Svetovit to all Slavs, whose worship in Serbia was later deliberately replaced by that of a saint with a similar name. This view was supported by some later researchers. However, it is generally believed that the cult of Svetovit existed only among the Polabian Slavs and that Vidovdan has nothing to do with this god, and that linking the deity to the holiday is a creation of romanticism.

<text>Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines or How I Flew from London to Paris in 25 Hours and 11 Minutes is a 1965 British epic period comedy film that satirises the early years of aviation. Directed and co-written by Ken Annakin, the film stars an international ensemble cast, including Stuart Whitman, Sarah Miles, Robert Morley, Terry-Thomas, James Fox, Red Skelton, Benny Hill, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Gert Fröbe and Alberto Sordi.

Set in the year 1910, the film follows a fictitious air race from London to Paris, with a £10,000 () prize, intended to prove that Britain is &quot;number one in the air&quot;. The film is noted for its spectacular flying scenes, featuring dozens of period accurate, life-size working aeroplanes. It was shot in 65mm Todd-AO by cinematographer Christopher Challis, and features a film score composed by Ron Goodwin.

Released in the United Kingdom by 20th Century Fox on 16 June 1965, the film was both a widespread critical and commercial success. It was nominated for three BAFTA Awards, winning for Best British Costume Design – Colour, as well as an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. The film also received three Golden Globe Award nomination, including for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.

==Plot==

A brief narration outlines man&#x27;s first attempts to fly since the Stone Age inspired by a bird&#x27;s flight, seen with footage from the silent film era, and man being represented by a &quot;test pilot&quot; encountering periodic misfortune in his attempts.

In 1910, pompous British newspaper magnate Lord Rawnsley forbids his would-be aviatrix daughter, ardent suffragette Patricia, to fly. Aviator Richard Mays, a young army officer, and Patricia&#x27;s fiancé conceives the idea of an air race from London to Paris to advance the cause of British aviation and his career. With Patricia&#x27;s support, he persuades Lord Rawnsley to sponsor the race as a publicity stunt for his newspaper.

Rawnsley, who takes full credit for the idea, announces the event to the press, and invitations are sent to leading aviators all over the world. Dozens of participants arrive at the airfield at the &quot;Brookley&quot; Motor Racing Track, where the fliers make practice runs in the days before the race. During this time, a wildly mixed international assembly of aviators begins rubbing shoulders with each other, most of them conforming to national stereotypes: The by-the-book, Prussian officer Colonel Manfred von Holstein, who becomes the victim of Frenchman Pierre Dubois&#x27; various pranks; the impetuous Italian Count Emilio Ponticelli, who buys various aircraft from designer Harry Popperwell and wrecks them in test flights; the unscrupulous British baronet Sir Percy Ware-Armitage, aided by his bullied servant, Courtney; and the rugged American cowboy Orvil Newton.

As the teams test their aircraft in the days before the race, Newton gets caught in the rigging of Sir Percy&#x27;s plane, which crashes in the nearby sewage farm. Newton later stops the German aircraft after its tail breaks off and runs out of control. This leads to Patricia falling for him even more and Mays becomes more jealous, creating a love triangle between Newton and Mays. At a celebration in Dover, Mays confronts Newton, sparking a fierce rivalry between them for Patricia&#x27;s hand, just before Japan&#x27;s official contestant, naval officer Yamamoto, arrives at the airfield.

Patricia convinces Newton to take her flying and they race back to the airfield, followed by Mays and her father, who are intent on stopping them. Not long after taking off, one of the struts on Newton&#x27;s plane breaks, and Patricia has to fly the plane while Newton repairs it with his belt. When Newton lands, Lord Rawnsley throws him out of the race. Patricia apologises to Newton, and Rawnsley gives in after she threatens to start an international incident. Meanwhile, insulted by the French team&#x27;s mockery, Holstein challenges Dubois to a duel. Dubois agrees and opts for gas balloons and blunderbusses as his weapons of choice. Both balloons and their pilots end up in the filthy waters of the adjacent sewage farm.

At the party the night before the race, Sir Percy sabotages Yamamoto and Newton&#x27;s planes, and Rumpelstrosse, the German pilot, is incapacitated by a laxative meant for Yamamoto. After the competitors take off the next day, with Holstein standing in for Rumpelstrosse, Sir Percy&#x27;s sabotage, fuel blockages, and other technical mishaps hamper the fliers until most of them safely arrive at Dover, their checkpoint before the final flight across the English Channel.

Sir Percy cheats by having his aircraft taken across by boat at night, but is delayed by excited locals when he arrives. The other contestants fly across the Channel in the morning, but most of them, including Holstein, fall into the sea. Sir Percy gets his comeuppance when he becomes disoriented by the smoke from a locomotive between Calais and Paris, causing him to jam his landing gear between two of the train cars. As he runs along the top trying to get the driver&#x27;s attention, the train passes through a tunnel, wrecking his aircraft.

Coming into Paris, Ponticelli&#x27;s plane catches fire, and Newton detours to rescue him as Mays is landing, winning for Britain. Mays recognises Newton&#x27;s heroism and shares the glory and the prize with him, while Ponticelli agrees to give up flying for his family. The only other successful aviator is Dubois, completing his race for France. Patricia finally chooses Newton, breaking the love triangle. Their kiss is interrupted by a strange noise: they and the others at the field look up to see a flyover by six English Electric Lightning jet fighters, as the period leaps forward to the &quot;present&quot; (1965).

Outlined are the still-persisting hazards of modern flying despite today&#x27;s advanced technology, as a night-time civilian flight across the English Channel is cancelled owing to heavy fog. One of the delayed passengers gets the idea of learning to fly under his power, perpetuating man&#x27;s pioneering spirit.

==Production==

===Origins===
Director Ken Annakin had been interested in aviation from his early years when pioneering aviator Sir Alan Cobham took him up in a flight in a biplane. Later in the Second World War, Annakin had served in the RAF when he had begun his career in film documentaries. In 1963, with co-writer Jack Davies, Annakin had been working on an adventure film about transatlantic flights when the producer&#x27;s bankruptcy aborted the production. Fresh from his role as director of the British exterior segments in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), Annakin suggested an event from early aviation to Darryl F. Zanuck, his producer on &quot;The Longest Day&quot;.

Zanuck financed an epic faithful to the era, with a £100,000 stake, deciding on the name, &quot;Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&quot; after Elmo Williams, managing director of 20th Century Fox in Europe, told him his wife Lorraine Williams had written an opening for a song that Annakin complained would &quot;seal the fate of the movie&quot;:Those magnificent men in their flying machines,They go up, Tiddley up, up,They go down, Tiddley down, down. After being put to music by Ron Goodwin, the &quot;Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&quot; song was released as a single in 1965 on the Stateside label (SS 422), together with an accompanying soundtrack album (SL 10136).

An international cast plays the array of contestants with the film opening with a brief, comic prologue on the history of flight, narrated by James Robertson Justice and featuring American comedian Red Skelton. In a series of silent blackout vignettes that incorporate stock footage of unsuccessful attempts at early aircraft, Skelton depicted a recurring character whose adventures span the centuries. The early aviation history sequence that begins the film is followed by a whimsical animated opening credit sequence drawn by caricaturist Ronald Searle, accompanied by the title song.

&quot;Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines ...&quot; concludes with an epilogue in a fogbound 1960s London airport when cancellation of flights to Paris is announced. The narrator remarks that today a jet makes the trip in seven minutes, but &quot;it &quot;can&quot; take longer&quot;. One frustrated passenger (Skelton, again) starts wing-flapping motions with his arms, and the scene morphs into the animation from the title sequence for the closing credits. This was Skelton&#x27;s final feature film appearance; he was in Europe filming the 1964–65 season of his television series, &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;.

One of the features of the film was British and international character actors who enlivened the foibles of each contestant&#x27;s nationality. The entertainment comes from the dialogue and characterisations and the aerial stunts, with heroism and gentlemanly conduct. British comedy actors of the day, Benny Hill, Eric Sykes, Terry-Thomas and Tony Hancock, among others, provided madcap misadventures. While Terry-Thomas had a substantial leading role as a &quot;bounder&quot;, Hill, Sykes and Hancock played lesser cameos. Although Hancock had broken his leg off-set, two days into filming, Annakin wrote his infirmity into the story, and his leg bound in a cast figured in a number of scenes.

In a recurring gag suggested by Zanuck, Irina Demick plays a series of flirts who are all pursued by the French pilot. First, she is Brigitte (French), then Ingrid (Swedish), Marlene (German), Françoise (Belgian), Yvette (Bulgarian), and finally, Betty (British).

Another aspect was the fluid writing and directing with Annakin and Davies feeding off each other. They had worked together on &quot;Very Important Person&quot; (1961), &quot;The Fast Lady&quot; (1962) and &quot;Crooks Anonymous&quot; (1962). Annakin and Davies continued to develop the script with zany interpretations. When the German character played by Gert Fröbe contemplates piloting his country&#x27;s entry, he climbs into the cockpit and retrieves a manual. Annakin and Davies devised a quip on the spot, having him read out: &quot;No. 1. Sit down.&quot; Although a comedy, elements of Annakin&#x27;s documentary background were evident with authentic sets, props and costumes. More than 2,000 extras out in authentic costumes were in the climactic race launch which was combined with entrants in the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run being invited on set as part of their 1964 annual run, an unexpected coup in gaining numerous period vehicles to dress the set.

A troublesome on-set distraction occurred when the two lead actors, Stuart Whitman and Sarah Miles, fell out early in the production. Director Ken Annakin commented that it began with an ill-timed pass by Whitman. (Whitman was married at the time, although he would divorce in 1966.) Miles &quot;hated his guts&quot; and rarely deigned to speak to him afterward unless the interaction was required by the script. Annakin employed a variety of manipulations to ensure the production still proceeded smoothly. The stars made peace with each other after on-set filming concluded; their interactions were civil during final re-takes of scenes and voice-overs.

The film played in cinemas as the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union hit a new gear. For its first audiences the film&#x27;s depiction of an international flight competition taking place in an earlier, lower-tech era offered a fun-house mirror reflection of contemporary adventures by Space Age pioneers.

=== Casting ===
Stuart Whitman, the American lead, was selected over the first choice, Dick Van Dyke, whose agents never contacted him about the offer. Irina Demick was rumoured to be romantically involved with Darryl F. Zanuck, who had campaigned for her casting.

Jean-Pierre Cassel was cast as the French pilot Pierre Dubois, his first role in an English-language film.

Character actor Michael Trubshawe and David Niven served together in the Highland Light Infantry during the Second World War; they made it a point to refer to uncredited characters in their films as &quot;Trubshawe&quot; or &quot;Niven&quot; as an inside joke.

Japanese actor Yūjirō Ishihara was dubbed by James Villiers due to his accent.

===Locations===
The film used period accurate, life-size working aeroplane models and replicas to create an early 20th century airfield, the &#x27;Brookley Motor Racing Track&#x27; (fashioned after Brooklands where early automotive racing and aviators shared the facilities for testing). All Brookley&#x27;s associated trappings of structures, aircraft and vehicles (including a rare 1907 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, subsequently estimated to be worth 50 million dollars) were part of the exterior set at Booker Airfield, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England.

The completed set featured a windmill as a lookout tower as well as serving as a restaurant (the &quot;Old Mill Cafe&quot;). A circular, banked track was also built and featured in a runaway motorcycle sequence in the film. In addition, the field adjacent to the windmill was used as the location for a number of aerial close-up shots of the pilots. Hangars were constructed in rows, bearing the names of real and fictional manufacturers: A.V. Roe &amp; Co., Bristol: The British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, Humber, three Sopwith hangars, Vickers and Ware-Armitage Manufacturing Co (a British in-joke, as Armitage Ware was the UK&#x27;s largest manufacturer of toilets and urinals). A grandstand was added for spectators.

When the production was unable to obtain rights to film main sequences over Paris, models of the aircraft and a miniature Parisian set played a prominent role in sequences depicting Paris. A mock-up of Calais was also constructed. Interior and studio sets at Pinewood Studios were used for bluescreen and special effects while exterior and interior footage of Rawnsley&#x27;s Manor House were shot at Pinewood Studios in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Other principal photography used location shooting in Kent at Dover Castle, along with The White Cliffs of Dover and Dover beach. In the scene where the aircraft start near Dover to pursue the race, modern ferries were visible in one harbour.

The location where Sir Percy&#x27;s aircraft lands on a train is the now closed line from Bedford to Hitchin. The tunnel into which they fly is the Old Warden Tunnel near the village of the same name in Bedfordshire; the tunnel had only recently been closed, and in the panning shot through the railway cutting, the cooling towers of the now-demolished Goldington Power Station can be seen. The locomotive is former Highland Railway Jones Goods Class No 103. About 1910, French Railways built duplicates of a Highland Railway Class &quot;The Castles&quot; which were a passenger version of the Jones Goods.

The Royal Air Force base at the village of Henlow, RAF Henlow, was another Bedfordshire location used for filming. The opening shot of the film is of The Long Walk leading to Windsor Castle filmed in Windsor, Berkshire, England. Don Sharp shot second unit with flying and stunts.

===Principal photography===
The film was photographed in 65 mm Todd-AO (which produces a 70 mm print once the sound tracks are added) by Christopher Challis. The head technical consultant during planning was Air Commodore Allen H. Wheeler from the Royal Air Force. Wheeler had previously restored a 1910-era Blériot with his son, and provided invaluable assistance in the restoration and recreation of period aircraft for the film.

The camera platforms included a modified Citroën sedan, camera trucks, helicopters and a flying rig constructed by Dick Parker. Parker had built it for model sequences in &quot;Strategic Air Command&quot; (1955). The rig consisted of two construction cranes and a hydraulically operated device to tilt and position a model, along with 200 ft (61 m) of cables. Parker&#x27;s rig allowed actors to sit inside full-scale models suspended 50 ft (15 m) above the ground, yet provide safety and realism for staged flying sequences, with the sky realistically in the background. A further hydraulic platform did away with matte shots of aircraft in flight. The platform was large enough to mount an aircraft and Parker or stunt pilots could manipulate its controls for realistic bluescreen sequences. Composite photography was used when scenes called for difficult shots; these were completed at Pinewood Studios. Some shots were created with rudimentary cockpits and noses grafted to an Alouette helicopter. One scene over Paris was staged with small models when Paris refused an overflight. However, for the majority of flying scenes, full-scale flying aircraft were employed.

=== Title ===
At 85 characters, &quot;Those Magnificent Men ...&quot; was the longest-titled film to be nominated for an Academy Award until the 2021 nominations of &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot;. Most cinemas abbreviated the full title, and it was eventually re-released with the shorter title.

==Aircraft==
The film includes reproductions of 1910-era aircraft, including a triplane, monoplanes, biplanes and also Horatio Phillips&#x27;s 20-winged multiplane from 1904. Wheeler insisted on authentic materials but allowed the use of modern engines and modifications necessary to ensure safety. Of 20 types built in 1964 at £5,000 each, six could fly, flown by six stunt pilots and maintained by 14 mechanics. The race take-off scene where seven aircraft are in the air at once included a composite addition of one aircraft. Flying conditions were monitored carefully, with aerial scenes filmed before 10 am or in early evening when the air was least turbulent, as the replicas, true to the originals, were flimsy, and control, especially in the lateral plane, tended to be marginal. When weather conditions were poor, interiors or other incidental sequences were shot instead. Wheeler eventually served not only as the technical adviser but also as the aerial supervisor throughout the production, and, later wrote a comprehensive background account of the film and the replicas that were constructed to portray period aircraft.

The following competitors were listed (as seen in the list onscreen 1 hour and 31 minutes in):
# Richard Mays: Antoinette IV (Aircraft number 8: flying replica)
# Sir Percy Ware-Armitage: Avro Triplane IV (Aircraft number 12: flying replica)
# Orvil Newton: Bristol Boxkite, nicknamed &quot;The Phoenix Flyer&quot; and inaccurately referred to as a Curtiss (Aircraft number 7: flying replica)
# Lieutenant Parsons: Picat Dubreuil nicknamed &quot;HMS Victory&quot; (Aircraft number 4)
# Harry Popperwell: Dixon Nipper &quot;Little Fiddler&quot; (Aircraft number 5)
# Colonel Manfred von Holstein and Captain Rumpelstrosse: Eardley Billing Tractor Biplane (Aircraft number 11: flying replica)
# Mr Wallace: Edwards Rhomboidal (Aircraft number 14) 
# Charles Wade: (Aircraft number unknown)
# Mr Yamamoto: Japanese Eardley Billing Tractor Biplane (Aircraft number 1: duplicate flying replica)
# Count Emilio Ponticelli: Philips Multiplane, Passat Ornithopter, Lee-Richards Annular Biplane and Vickers 22 Monoplane (Aircraft number 2: flying replica)
# Henri Monteux: (Aircraft number unknown)
# Pierre Dubois: Santos-Dumont Demoiselle (Aircraft number 9: flying replica)
# Mr Mac Dougall: Blackburn Monoplane nicknamed &quot;Wake up Scotland&quot; (Aircraft number 6: original vintage aircraft)
# Harry Walton (Aircraft number unknown).
While each aircraft was an accurate reproduction, some &quot;impersonated&quot; other types. For instance, &quot;The Phoenix Flyer&quot; was a Bristol Boxkite built by F.G. Miles Engineering Co. at Ford, Sussex, representing a Curtiss biplane of 1910 vintage. Annakin had apparently expressed a desire to have a Wright Flyer in the film. The Bristol (a British derivative of the French 1909 Farman biplane) was chosen instead, because it shared a common general layout with a Wright or Curtiss pusher biplane of the era, and had an excellent reputation for tractability. For the impersonation, the replica had &quot;The Phoenix Flyer&quot; painted on its outer rudder surfaces and was also called a &quot;Gruber-Newton Flyer&quot; adding the name of its primary backer to the nomenclature; although the American pilot character, Orvil Newton inaccurately describes his aircraft to Patricia Rawnsley as a &quot;Curtiss with an Anzani engine.&quot;

F. G. Miles, chiefly responsible for its design and manufacture, built the replica Bristol Boxkite with the original standard twin rudder installation and powered the replica with a Rolls-Royce-manufactured version of the 65 hp Continental A65. In the course of testing, Wheeler had a third rudder inserted between the other two (some original Boxkites also had this fitting) to improve directional control, and substituted a more powerful 90 hp Rolls-Royce C90 that still barely delivered the power of the original 50 hp Gnome rotary at the power settings used for the Boxkite. The replica achieved a 45 mph top speed. The Boxkite was tractable, however, and the scene in the film when the aircraft loses a pair of main wheels just after take off but lands smoothly, was repeated 20 times for the cameras. In the penultimate flying scene, a stuntman was carried in the Boxkite&#x27;s undercarriage and carried out a fall and roll (the stunt had to be repeated to match the principal actor&#x27;s roll and revival). Slapstick stunts on the ground and in the air were a major element and often the directors requested repeated stunts; the stuntmen were more than accommodating; it meant more pay.

The Eardley Billing Tractor Biplane replica flown by David Watson appeared in two guises, in more or less authentic form, impersonating an early German tractor biplane, and also as the Japanese pilot&#x27;s mount, modified with boxkite-like side curtains over the interplane struts, a covered fuselage, and colourful &quot;oriental&quot; decorations.
In addition to the flying aircraft, several unsuccessful aircraft of the period were represented by non-flying replicas, including contraptions such as an ornithopter (the Passat Ornithopter) flown by the Italian contender, the Edwards Rhomboidal, Picat Dubreuil, Philips Multiplane and the Little Fiddler (a canard, or tail-first design). Several of the &quot;non-flying&quot; types flew with the help of &quot;movie magic&quot;. The Lee Richards Annular Biplane with circular wings (built by Denton Partners on Woodley Aerodrome, near Reading) was &quot;flown on wires&quot; during the filming.

The flying replicas were specifically chosen to be different enough that an ordinary audience member could distinguish them. They were all types reputed to have flown well, in or about 1910. In most cases this worked well, but there were a few surprises, adding to an accurate historical reassessment of the aircraft concerned. For example, in its early form, the replica of the Santos-Dumont Demoiselle, a forerunner of today&#x27;s ultralight aircraft, was unable to leave the ground except in short hops. Extending the wingspan and fitting a more powerful Ardem 50 hp engine produced only marginal improvement. When Doug Bianchi and the Personal Planes production staff who constructed the replica consulted with Allen Wheeler, he recalled that the Demoiselle&#x27;s designer and first pilot, Alberto Santos-Dumont was a very short, slightly built man. A suitably small pilot, Joan Hughes, a wartime member of the Air Transport Auxiliary who was the Airways Flying Club chief instructor, was hired. With the reduced payload, the diminutive Demoiselle flew very well, and Hughes proved a consummate stunt flyer, able to undertake exacting manoeuvres.
In 1960, Bianchi had created a one-off Vickers 22 (Blériot type) Monoplane, using Vickers Company drawings intended for the Vickers Flying Club in 1910. 20th Century Fox purchased the completed replica, although it required a new engine and modifications, including replacing the wooden fuselage structure with welded steel tubing as well as incorporating ailerons instead of wing-warping. The Vickers 22 became the final type used by the Italian contestant. Sometime after the film wrapped, the Vickers was sold to a buyer in New Zealand. It is believed to have flown once, at Wellington Airport in the hands of Keith Trillo, a test pilot involved in a number of aircraft certification programmes, and is now at the Southward Car Museum, Otaihanga, New Zealand.

Peter Hillwood of Hampshire Aero Club constructed an Avro Triplane Mk IV, using drawings provided by Geoffrey Verdon Roe, son of A.V. Roe, the designer. The construction of the triplane followed A.V. Roe&#x27;s specifications and was the only replica that utilised wing-warping successfully. With a more powerful 90 hp Cirrus II replacing the 35 hp Green engine that was in the original design, the Avro Triplane proved to be a lively performer, even with a stuntman dangling from the fuselage.
The Antoinette IV film model closely replicated the slim, graceful monoplane that was very nearly the first aircraft to fly the English Channel, in the hands of Hubert Latham, and won several prizes in early competitions. When the Hants and Sussex Aviation Company from Portsmouth Aerodrome undertook its construction, the company followed the original structural specifications carefully, although an out-of-period de Havilland Gypsy I engine was used. The Antoinette&#x27;s wing structure proved, however, to be dangerously flexible, and lateral control was very poor, even after the wing bracing was reinforced with extra wires, and the original wing-warping was replaced with ailerons (hinged on the rear spar rather than from the trailing edge, as in the original Antoinette). Nonetheless, even in its final configuration the Antoinette was marginal in terms of stability and lateral control and great care had to be taken during its flying sequences, most flights being straight &quot;hops&quot;.

The realism and the attention to detail in the replicas of vintage machines are a major contributor to the enjoyment of the film, and although a few of the &quot;flying&quot; stunts were achieved through the use of models and cleverly disguised wires, most aerial scenes featured actual flying aircraft. The few genuine vintage aircraft used included a Deperdussin used as set dressing, and the flyable 1912 Blackburn Monoplane &quot;D&quot; (the oldest genuine British aircraft still flying), belonged to the Shuttleworth Trust based at Old Warden, Bedfordshire. When the filming was completed, the &quot;1910 Bristol Boxkite&quot; and the &quot;1911 Roe IV Triplane&quot; were retained in the Shuttleworth Collection, Both replicas are still in flyable condition, albeit flying with different engines. For his role in promoting the film, the non-flying &quot;Passat Ornithopter&quot; was given to aircraft restorer and preservationist, Cole Palen who displayed it at his Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome, New York, where it is still on display.

Despite the reliance on flying stunts and their inherent danger, the one near-tragedy occurred on the ground when a stunt went wrong. Stuntman Ken Buckle inadvertently turned the throttle to full on a runaway motorbike and sidecar, launching himself through the retaining wall on the sloped Brookley racing track and crashing into the adjoining cesspool, off-camera. Thinking quickly, the special effects man on the other side of the wall saw the motorbike hurtling towards him and set off the accompanying explosion, creating a realistic waterspout. Lucky to escape with only facial bruises and a dislocated collarbone, as he struggled to his feet, Buckle apologised for having messed up, but the shot &quot;was in the can&quot;.

During the promotional junkets accompanying the film in 1965, a number of the vintage aircraft and film replicas used in the production were flown in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The pilots who had been part of the aerial team readily agreed to accompany the promotional tour to have a chance to fly these aircraft again.

==Reception==
===Critical===
&quot;Those Magnificent Men In their Flying Machines ...&quot; had its Royal World Premiere on 3 June 1965 at the Astoria Theatre in the West End of London in the presence of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Contemporary reviews judged &quot;Those Magnificent Men In their Flying Machines ...&quot; as &quot;good fun.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther thought it &quot;a funny picture, highly colorful, and it does move&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; felt similarly: &quot;As fanciful and nostalgic a piece of clever picture-making as has hit the screen in recent years, this backward look into the pioneer days of aviation, when most planes were built with spit and bailing wire, is a warming entertainment experience.&quot; When the film turned up on television for the first time in 1969, &quot;TV Guide&quot; summed up most critical reviews: &quot;Good, clean fun, with fast and furious action, good cinematography, crisp dialogue, wonderful planes, and a host of some of the funniest people in movies in the cast.&quot;

===Box office===
At over two hours, &quot;Those Magnificent Men In their Flying Machines ...&quot; was treated as a major production, one of three full-length 70 mm Todd-AO Fox releases in 1965 with an intermission and musical interlude part of the original screenings. The film was initially an exclusive roadshow presentation where customers needed reserved seats purchased ahead of time. It was an immediate box-office success, out-grossing the similar car-race comedy &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1965). It stood up well against the slightly earlier &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963).

According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $15,300,000 in worldwide rentals to break even and made $29,950,000. In the United States, the film earned $14,000,000 in rentals, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 1965. By September 1970, it had earned Fox an estimated profit of $10,683,000.

===Awards and nominations===
==Pseudo-sequel==
The success of the film prompted Annakin to write (again with Jack Davies) and direct another race film, &quot;Monte Carlo or Bust!&quot; (1969), this time involving vintage cars, with the story set around the Monte Carlo Rally. Ron Goodwin composed the music for both films.

<text>Blood Money is the fifteenth studio album by Tom Waits, released in 2002 on the ANTI- label. It consists of songs Waits and Kathleen Brennan wrote for Robert Wilson&#x27;s opera &quot;Woyzeck&quot;. Waits had worked with Wilson on two previous plays: &quot;The Black Rider&quot; and &quot;Alice&quot;. &quot;Alice&quot; was released with &quot;Blood Money&quot; simultaneously in 2002. 

==Background==
The album contains most of the songs written by Waits and Brennan for Wilson&#x27;s production of &quot;Woyzeck&quot; (2000). Wilson&#x27;s opera was based on the play of the same name by Georg Büchner, which had also inspired Alban Berg&#x27;s opera &quot;Wozzeck&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Woyzeck&quot; premiered at the Betty Nansen Theatre in Copenhagen in November 2000. Asked about releasing two albums at the same time, Waits said &quot;Well, thing is, people get upset when you haven&#x27;t had a record out in seven years--then they get upset when you put out two at the same time. It&#x27;s like, &#x27;Where are my eggs?&#x27; then &#x27;I didn&#x27;t order this!&#x27; My feeling is that if it turns out to be a success, then it was my idea, and if it&#x27;s not, then I blame it on someone else.&quot; The score is the same as Wilson&#x27;s play, but Waits explains &quot;I just changed the title. I didn&#x27;t think anybody would know who Woyzeck is.&quot; 
Per Dan Cohen, &quot;Nineteenth-century German poet Georg Buchner&#x27;s story &quot;Woyzeck,&quot; about a soldier driven mad by bizarre army experiments and infidelity, incurs music Waits calls &#x27;flesh and blood, earthbound; carnal ... Tin Pan Alley meets the Weimar Republic.&#x27;

Like all Waits&#x27; efforts since &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; (&#x27;83), it&#x27;s stylistically varied, with an overall production &#x27;patina&#x27;--in this case a dry, raspy shibui (the Japanese word for dilapidation) sound personified by the pod (a 4-foot-long Indonesian bean shaker), marimbas and a 57-whistle pneumatic calliope that reverberated for five miles in the Sonoma shack where the CDs were recorded.&quot;

Waits said of the calliope, &quot;playing a calliope is an &quot;experience.&quot; There&#x27;s an old expression, &#x27;Never let your daughter marry a calliope player.&#x27; Because they&#x27;re all out of their &quot;minds.&quot; Because the calliope is so flaming &quot;loud.&quot; Louder than a bagpipe. In the old days, they used them to announce the arrival of the circus because you could literally hear it three miles away. Imagine something you could hear three miles away, and now you&#x27;re right in front of it, in a studio...playing it like a piano, and your face is red, your hair is sticking up, you&#x27;re sweating. You could scream and nobody could hear you. It&#x27;s probably the most visceral music experience I&#x27;ve ever had. And when you&#x27;re done, you feel like you should probably should go to the doctor. Just check me over, Doc, I did a couple of numbers on the calliope and I want you to take me through the paces.&quot;

The song &quot;Shiny Things&quot; appears in Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot; but not on &quot;Blood Money&quot;; it was later released on Waits&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2006).

==Reception==
Maddy Costa writes of &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Blood Money&quot;: &quot;Bearing in mind that both albums were recorded in the same sessions, share the same musicians and use much the same instrumentation, the similarities are hardly surprising. Looking back, it is clear that Waits was peculiarly suited to both projects. His songs have long been preoccupied with society&#x27;s outsiders, with murder and desire... the best songs on &quot;Blood Money&quot; merrily rework the skewed rhythms and whirling textures that are Waits&#x27;s trademark...Waits and Brennan dive into the corrupt, merciless world of Woyzeck with relish; their lyrics are perkily savage, cheerfully nihilistic. &#x27;I&#x27;d sell your heart to the junkman baby, for a buck,&#x27; snipes &#x27;God&#x27;s Away on Business&#x27;, while &#x27;Starving in the Belly of a Whale&#x27; warns: &#x27;If you live in hope you&#x27;re dancing to a terrible tune.&#x27; Best of all is &#x27;Misery Is the River of the World&#x27;, a sinister twist of marimba and blurting bass clarinet, wheezes from an ancient calliope and bubbles of percussion from an Indonesian pod, over which Waits gleefully puffs: &#x27;Misery&#x27;s the river of the world - everybody row!&#x27;&quot;

Cohen writes that &quot;This skeletal army of instruments tends to overshadow the vocals on the edgy tracks (more restrained than on &quot;Bone Machine&quot;), but the potent &#x27;Knife Chase&#x27; (a Peter Gunnish instrumental featuring Waits&#x27; son Casey on drums) is a standout. The bluesy &#x27;Another Man&#x27;s Vine,&#x27; the ballad &#x27;Lullaby&#x27; and the extraordinary &#x27;The Part You Throw Away&#x27; that&#x27;s like the pizzicato string backing in James Brown&#x27;s &#x27;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World&#x27; set in the Ukraine, are my other picks.&quot;

Robert Christgau praised &quot;Blood Money&quot;, writing &quot;Waits has the bases covered. He&#x27;s a genius; when he doesn&#x27;t make masterpieces, he comes close.&quot; He preferred it to &quot;Alice&quot;, calling &quot;Blood Money&quot; &quot;a more consistent record, albeit unbalanced by arbitrary thematic commitments. &#x27;Lullaby&#x27; goes someplace new with its quiet &#x27;If I die before you wake/Don&#x27;t you cry; don&#x27;t you weep,&#x27; and the perfidy-of-woman fable &#x27;Another Man&#x27;s Vine&#x27; approaches tragedy by rejecting contempt. But rather than building off each other, the four life-sucks songs, only &#x27;Everything Goes to Hell&#x27; less than inspired, protest too much... Maybe the reason his bandleading stands out so is that, for all his joy in language, it best articulates his deepest compulsion, which is to reject a corrupt present without wallowing in a romanticized past. He forges into the future on old instruments nobody&#x27;s ever heard of because they were rejects, just like the losers and monsters whose stories he tells. This is honorable, difficult work.&quot;

Elizabeth Gilbert wrote of the two albums: &quot;The good people at Waits&#x27;s label, Anti, struck a bit of genius when they decided to release these two albums simultaneously. Because the contrasts of &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Blood Money&quot; perfectly highlight the two aspects of Waits&#x27;s musical character that have been colliding in his work for decades. On one hand, the man has an unmatched instinct for melody. Nobody can write a more heartbreaking ballad than Waits. On the other hand, he has shown a lifelong desire to unbuckle those pretty melodies... here, on &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Blood Money&quot;, you can see it all together, side-by-side. All that Tom Waits is capable of. All the beauty and all the perversity. All the talent and all the discord. All that he wants to honor and all that he wants to dismantle. All of it gorgeous, all of it transporting.&quot;

The album ranked at #18 in Metacritic&#x27;s Top 30 albums of 2002.
As of 2003, &quot;Blood Money&quot; has sold 143,000 copies in the US, according to Nielsen Soundscan.

The song &quot;God&#x27;s Away on Business&quot; was featured in &quot;&quot; (2005). &quot;All the World is Green&quot; was featured in &quot;The Secret Life of Words&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot;&#x27; (2007). &quot;Misery is the River of the World&quot; was featured in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Babylon&quot;, which aired on February 16, 2016. &quot;Starving in the Belly of a Whale&quot; was featured in &quot;Buster&#x27;s Mal Heart&quot; (2016) as the opening song.

<text>2685 Masursky, provisional designation , is a stony Eunomian asteroid from the central regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 3 May 1981, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at the Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, and named after American planetary geologist Harold Masursky. In January 2000, the Cassini space probe observed the S-type asteroid from afar during its coast to Saturn.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Masursky&quot; is a member of the Eunomia family (), a prominent family of stony asteroids and the largest one in the intermediate main belt with more than 5,000 members.

It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.3–2.9 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,505 days; semi-major axis of 2.57 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as at McDonald Observatory in November 1950. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its observation as at Cerro El Roble Observatory in August 1973, nearly 8 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.

== Cassini–Huygens flyby ==

Little was known about &quot;Masursky&quot; until the Cassini–Huygens space probe, en route to Jupiter and Saturn, flew past it on 23 January 2000. Because &quot;Cassini&quot; passed the asteroid at a distance of 1.6 million kilometers (approximately 4 lunar distances), the images it returned showed nothing more than a dot.

== Physical characteristics ==

Cassini&#x27;s observations had cast some doubt on its composition, but later ground-based spectroscopy has confirmed its stony S-type spectrum, which is also the Eunomia family&#x27;s overall spectral type.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

During its flyby in January 2000, Cassini–Huygens estimated a mean diameter of approximately 15–20 kilometers, based on an angular diameter of 0.81–1.08 arcseconds just hours before its closest approach. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Masursky&quot; measures 10.744 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.114.

=== Rotation period ===

As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of &quot;Masursky&quot; has been obtained from photometric observations. The body&#x27;s rotation period, spin-axis and shape remain unknown.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after Harold Masursky (1922–1990), a planetary geologist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center of the U.S. Geological Survey, in Flagstaff, Arizona. Masursky worked on numerous space missions and programs including Ranger, Surveyor, Lunar Orbiter, Apollo, Mariner 9, Viking, Pioneer Venus, Voyager, as well as on the &quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;Magellan&quot; spacecraft. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 4 August 1982 ().

<text>Silver Side Up is the third studio album by Canadian rock band Nickelback, released on September 11, 2001. According to AllMusic, &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; continued Nickelback&#x27;s tradition of &quot;dark high-octane rock&quot; from the band&#x27;s first two albums. It reached number one in Canada, Austria, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The album was certified 8× Platinum in Canada, 6× Platinum in the US, and 3× Platinum in the UK.

Nickelback toured the world in support of the album, which included their first UK arena tour. After returning from the tour, the band began work on &quot;The Long Road&quot;.

==Background==
By 2000, Nickelback had begun to receive commercial success through performing their 1998 album &quot;The State&quot; and its lead single &quot;Leader of Men&quot;. In early 2001, &quot;The State&quot; was certified Gold in Canada and had almost reached the same certification in America. At this time, Nickelback was planning to enter the studio to begin recording their third studio album. In March 2001, the band won their first Juno Award for Best New Group of the Year. In April 2001, they returned to the studio where &quot;The State&quot; was made, to begin recording &quot;Silver Side Up&quot;. Many of the songs from &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; were written before &quot;The State&quot; was released; some of them, including &quot;Hangnail&quot; and &quot;Hollywood,&quot; had been played live and many fans already knew them before &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; was released. &quot;Just For&quot; was originally released on &quot;Curb&quot; as &quot;Just Four&quot; in 1996. According to Chad Kroeger during a Vegas concert in 2018, &quot;Where Do I Hide?&quot; is about a friend of his who would bust out of prison all the time and go back to Nickelback&#x27;s hometown of Hanna, Alberta.

Nickelback took their time recording &quot;Silver Side Up&quot;, and eventually hired Rick Parashar to help them produce the album. By June 2001, the band had completed the record; they announced the lead single would be &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;. Mike Kroeger, the bass player, wanted to release &quot;Never Again&quot;, but the record label and bandmates decided &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; would be more appropriate. In July 2001, Nickelback sent &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; to rock radio stations. In August that year, Nickelback played their first German tour. In early September, the band set out to tour with their friends 3 Doors Down. While on tour, &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; reached number one on both the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and the Modern Rock Tracks chart before &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; was officially released. The success of the album&#x27;s lead single catapulted their previous album &quot;The State&quot; back onto the Billboard charts.

==Release and chart performance==
&quot;Silver Side Up&quot; was released on September 11, 2001. It debuted at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, behind Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;The Blueprint&quot;, selling 178,000 copies in the first week. The album debuted at number 1 in the Canadian Albums Chart, becoming Nickelback&#x27;s first record to both enter and top the chart. The band decided to tour with Default and others in late 2001. &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; received Platinum status from the RIAA one month after its release, becoming Nickelback&#x27;s first album to garner that distinction. In Canada, it also reached Platinum status, surpassing &quot;The State&quot;, which went Gold in January 2001.

In December 2001, &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; peaked at number one in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it remained for four weeks. The song stayed in the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for 20 consecutive weeks. By the end of 2001, &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; had been awarded Double Platinum status by the RIAA for selling two million copies in the United States. Follow-up singles were &quot;Too Bad&quot; and &quot;Never Again&quot;, both of which reached number one on the rock charts, but failed to achieve the same success as &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;.

In 2002, Nickelback toured worldwide to support &quot;Silver Side Up&quot;; they filmed a concert in their home province of Alberta, which the band released on DVD as &quot;Live at Home&quot;. The band won many Juno Awards and several Billboard Music Awards. &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; became the number one song of the Hot 100 of the year for 2002. By early 2003, the band was nominated for the American Music Awards. Nickelback also played at the American Music Awards. &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; was certified 6× Platinum by the RIAA and 8× Platinum by Music Canada.

In the United Kingdom, the album has sold over 1,117,000 copies as of June 2017.

==Reception==
As of December 22, 2010, the album had sold 5,666,000 copies in the U.S. According to IFPI, over 2,000,000 copies were sold in Europe and over 8,000,000 were sold worldwide by 2002. It was ranked 47th on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s 200 Albums of the Decade.

The album received mixed reviews from critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Matt Diehl gave the album two out of five stars, stating, &quot;Nearly every song seems trapped in the amber of early-Nineties Seattle aesthetics, the sonic equivalent of too many unfortunate goatees.&quot;

<text>The College Board, styled as CollegeBoard, is an American not-for-profit organization that was formed in December 1899 as the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) to expand access to higher education. While the College Board is not an association of colleges, it runs a membership association of institutions, including over 6,000 schools, colleges, universities, and other educational organizations.

The College Board develops and administers standardized tests and curricula used by K–12 and post-secondary education institutions to promote college-readiness and as part of the college admissions process. The College Board is headquartered in New York City. David Coleman has been the CEO of the College Board since October 2012. He replaced Gaston Caperton, former governor of West Virginia, who had held this position since 1999. The current president of the College Board is Jeremy Singer.

In addition to managing assessments for which it charges fees, the College Board provides resources, tools, and services to students, parents, colleges, and universities in college planning, recruitment and admissions, financial aid, and retention.

==History==

The College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) was founded at Columbia University on December 22, 1899, by representatives of 12 universities and three high school preparatory academies. These were:
* Columbia University
* Colgate University
* University of Pennsylvania
* New York University
* Barnard College
* Union College
* Rutgers University
* Vassar College
* Bryn Mawr College
* Women&#x27;s College of Baltimore (now Goucher College)
* Princeton University
* Cornell University
* Newark Academy
* Mixed High School, New York
* Collegiate Institute, New York

The organization&#x27;s intent was to &quot;adopt and publish a statement of the ground which should be covered and of the aims which should be sought by secondary school teaching in each of the following subjects (and in such others as may be desirable), and a plan of examination suitable as a test for admission to college: Botany, Chemistry, English, French, German, Greek, History, Latin, Mathematics, Physics, Zoology&quot;. According to the board&#x27;s plan of organization, the exam fee was $5, around $155 in 2020.

==CEEB code==
The College Board maintains a numbered registry of countries, college majors, colleges, scholarship programs, test centers, and high schools. In the United States, this registry is borrowed by other institutions as a means of unambiguous identification; thus, a student might give his or her guidance department a college&#x27;s name and address and its CEEB code to ensure that his or her transcript is sent correctly. There exists a similar set of ACT codes for colleges and scholarships, centers, and high schools; however, these codes are less widely used outside ACT, Inc.

==Tests and programs==

===SAT and SAT Subject Tests===
The SAT is a fee-based digital standardized test for college admissions in the United States, first administered in 1926. The College Board decides how the SAT is constructed, administered, and used in the United States. Educational Testing Service (ETS) develops, administers, publishes, and scores the SAT. The SAT covers writing, reading, and mathematics. SAT scores range from 400 to 1600, with each of the two sections—&quot;Reading and Writing&quot; and &quot;Math&quot;—both worth up to 800 points. The digital SAT is an adaptive test, made up of 2 reading and writing modules and 2 math modules. If the test taker does well on the first module of a section, then the second module of the section will be harder, and if the test taker does poorly on the first module, the second module will be easier. Most students take the test during their junior or senior year of high school. The SAT competes with the ACT, another standardized college admissions test.

Currently, the base test is $68. Various fees can accumulate—registering beyond the registration deadline results in a $30 late fee and changing a test date, center, or test type results in a $25 fee. The waitlist testing fee is $53, the first 4 score reports are free and $14 for each additional score report. Additionally, students sitting the test in regions outside the United States pay an additional &#x27;Non-U.S. Regional Fee&#x27; of between $43 and $53. As a result, student testing fees may run up to $200 or more for a single test. However, fee waivers and reductions are available for some low-income students.

On March 5, 2014, the College Board announced that a redesigned version of the SAT would be administered for the first time in 2016. The exam reverted to the 1600-point scale, and the essay became optional. The testing process was changed to give students three hours to take the exam plus 50 additional minutes to complete the essay. In the same announcement, the College Board also said they would be partnering with Khan Academy to make available, from spring 2015, free test preparation materials for the redesigned SAT. This included a preparation application to help students practice and identify areas of improvement. Practice problems and videos demonstrating step-by-step solutions were also made available.

The SAT Subject Tests were standardized tests intended to measure student performance in specific areas, such as mathematics, science, and history. On January 19, 2021, the College Board discontinued Subject Tests. This was effective immediately in the United States. The following summer, the tests were to be phased out for international students. CollegeBoard has discontinued the optional essay section of the SAT after June 2021.

On May 13, 2015, the College Board announced the release of a new credential initiative to get students more interested in careers focused in STEM with a Project Lead the Way partnership.

In March 2020, College Board announced the cancellation of several test dates during the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result many colleges went test optional or test blind admissions.

On January 25, 2022, College Board announced that the SAT will be delivered digitally in an attempt to change the format of test itself. Vice President of the College Readiness Assessment at College Board, Priscilla Rodriguez, states &quot;The digital SAT will be easier to take, easier to give and more relevant&quot;. Some new features of this digital version of the SAT include: a 2 hours testing period instead of the 3 hours period that has been used for the current SAT, more relevant topics that cover material that is given in college courses, and calculators will be allowed the entirety of the Math portion of the exam. Digital versions of the exam gives College Board the opportunity to address inequities that are associated with student accessibility to technology by providing students who don&#x27;t have computers on testing days. This new change was brought forth by College Board following disruptions in testing that were COVID related. The 2021 SAT Suite of Assessment Program results showed that 1.5 million high school students took compared to the 2.2 million students in 2020 who participated taking this test. 

In spring of 2024, all SATs have been transitioned to be taken on the Bluebook exam application.

===PSAT/NMSQT===

The PSAT/NMSQT is a fee-based standardized test that provides firsthand practice for the SAT for a cost of $18. However, the cost may vary based on state, district, or school. The test also functions as a qualifying test for the National Merit Scholarship Corporation&#x27;s scholarship programs. There are also other forms of the PSAT, including the PSAT 10 and the PSAT 8/9.&lt;ref name=&quot;Compare the PSAT/NMSQT and PSAT 10&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that the PSAT 10 and the PSAT 8/9 do not qualify a student for the National Merit Scholarship.

In spring of 2024, all PSATs have been transitioned to be taken on the Bluebook exam application.

===Advanced Placement Program===

The College Board&#x27;s Advanced Placement Program is an extensive program that offers high school students the chance to participate in what the College Board describes as college-level classes, reportedly broadening students&#x27; intellectual horizons and preparing them for college work. It also plays a large part in the college admissions process, showing students&#x27; intellectual capacity and genuine interest in learning. The program allows many students to gain college credit for high performance on the AP exams, which cost $97 each, much in the same manner as the CLEP. Granting credit, however, is at the discretion of the college. 290 colleges grant credit or advanced standing. Critics of the Advanced Placement Program charge that courses and exams emphasize the breadth of content coverage instead of depth.

In May 2020, glitches prevented some students from submitting their AP exams, forcing those students to re-take them in June.

In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, College Board began to roll out digital AP testing via the BlueBook app. College Board is working to transition all AP exams to digital exams.

===College Level Examination Program===

The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) provides students of any age, including high schoolers, college students, homeschooled students, adults, senior citizens, children, and exceptional toddlers, with the opportunity to demonstrate college-level achievement through a program of exams in undergraduate college courses. Two thousand nine hundred colleges grant credit for passing CLEP exams.

===Accuplacer===
The College Board&#x27;s Accuplacer test is a computer-based placement test that assesses reading, writing, and math skills. The Accuplacer test includes reading comprehension, sentence skills, arithmetic, elementary algebra, college-level mathematics, and the writing test, Writeplacer. The Accuplacer test is used primarily by more than 1,000 high schools and colleges to determine a student&#x27;s needed placement. Often community colleges have specific guidelines for students requiring the Accuplacer test. The Accuplacer Companion paper-and-pencil tests allow students with disabilities (specifically students with an Individualized Education Program or 504 Plan) to take the test through its braille, large print, and audio tests. The biggest benefit of the Accuplacer and Accuplacer Companion tests is their ability to be scored immediately through an online scoring system and taken in remote locations. While there are normally no fees for taking the test, some institutions may charge a fee to retake the test. Note that if a testing institution is not local, an examinee may be required to arrange a proctor for the test. If so, a local library may be willing to serve as a proctor as there are not many other options for individuals in this case. Most schools will only test their own admissions candidates.

===SpringBoard===
SpringBoard is a pre-Advanced Placement program created by the College Board to prepare students who intend to take AP courses or college-level courses in their scholastic careers. Based on Wiggins and McTighe&#x27;s &quot;Understanding by Design&quot; model, the SpringBoard program attempts to map knowledge into scholastic skill sets in preparation for Advanced Placement testing and college success. Units of instruction are titrated to students within and across all school grades, providing a vertically articulated curriculum framework that scaffolds learning skills and subject test knowledge. Implicit in the course curriculum, the program embeds pre-AP and AP teaching and learning strategies across grade school levels and classwork.

The curriculum applies to grades 6 through 12. Teachers are provided with formative assessments, professional training, and various teaching tools to track student progress. The instructional framework is integrated into the curriculum content and subject materials. SpringBoard also provides other Web 2.0 resources aimed at making the program more community-oriented.

=== Truinfadores ===
On June 23, 2020, The College Board and NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises launched a joint public campaign Truinfadores in order to help guide primarily Spanish-speaking families through their child&#x27;s college planning process. This campaign will offer funding to scholarships that are included in the College Board Opportunity Scholarship program that encourages students to apply for a chance to earn $40,000 towards their college tuition. These scholarships are open to any student, regardless of their citizenship status and are strictly reserved for students whose household income is less than $60,000.

=== BigFuture ===
BigFuture is a free online resource that helps students plan for college, pay for college, and explore careers. BigFuture&#x27;s National Recognition Program awards honors to underrepresented students, including African American students, Hispanic students, Indigenous students, and students who live in rural areas or small towns. 

=== Bluebook ===
Bluebook is a secure testing application for Windows, MacOS, iPadOS, and ChromeOS. Bluebook is used to take digital College Board exams, such as the SAT, PSAT, and certain AP exams. All SAT and PSATs have transitioned to digital only in spring 2024. Some AP exams are digital only while others are hybrid or paper only. College Board is transitioning all AP paper exams to digital exams.

==CSS Profile==
The College Board also offers the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE, a financial aid application service that many institutions use in determining family contribution and financial assistance packages. Students also must pay a $25 fee to apply and another $16 for each additional school to which they submit the profile.

==Criticism and controversies==
Criticism of the Board and its exams goes back to at least 1922, with a &quot;Harvard Alumni Bulletin&quot; article from prep school teacher Morgan Barnes. Barnes took ten different examinations &quot;&quot;in cognito&quot; qua candidate&quot;, requested the graded booklets of his exams, and attempted to confront some readers who scored them. Among Barnes&#x27;s grievances were general incompetence in grading, excessive focus on exam preparation in classrooms, and overreliance on exam scores in the college admissions process.

Since the late 1970s, the College Board has been subject to criticism from students, educators, and consumer rights activists. The College Board owns the SAT, and many students must take SAT exams for admission to competitive colleges. Some colleges also require students to submit a College Board CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE when applying for financial aid. As there are no broadly accepted alternatives to College Board products such as AP, SAT Subject Tests, and CSS/Financial Aid, the company is often criticized as exploiting its monopoly on these products.

FairTest, an organization that advocates against over-dependence on standardized tests in school admissions, maintains that the SAT often underestimates the aptitude of African-American students and others. FairTest maintains a list of more than 1000 SAT-optional colleges on its website.

The consumer rights organization Americans for Educational Testing Reform (AETR) has criticized the College Board for violating its non-profit status through excessive profits and exorbitant executive compensation; nineteen of its executives make more than $300,000 per year, with CEO Gaston Caperton earning $1.3 million in 2009 (including deferred compensation). AETR also claims that College Board is acting unethically by selling test preparation materials, directly lobbying legislators and government officials, and refusing to acknowledge test-taker rights.

===Exam fees===
The SAT Reasoning Test with essay cost $64.50 ($93.50 if late) , the AP exams cost US$97 ($137 if late) , and taking AP exams is often a requirement for students taking AP classes. The SAT Subject Tests cost a baseline of $26 with a $22 fee for each test. Other services can be added to the basic costs, including late registration, score verification services, and various answering available services. SAT score reports cost $12 per college for 1–2-week electronic delivery or 2–4-week paper or disk delivery. The College Board allows high school administrators to authorize fee waivers for some services to students from low-income families, generally those meeting National School Lunch Act criteria. In addition, because of the competitive nature of the test, many students take preparatory courses or have SAT tutoring, which can increase costs. The College Board&#x27;s College Scholarship Service Profile (CSS), a college financial aid application meant to help students pay for college, also requires a fee.

In 2017, the College Board had a $140 million surplus. Budget surpluses persist despite market-leading compensation packages for the College Board&#x27;s executives – in 2009, the College Board paid out a $1.3 million/year package for CEO Caperton, more than the head of the American Red Cross or Harvard University. It paid 19 executives more than $300,000 each per year.

===Correlation between essay length and score===
In 2005, MIT Writing Director Les Perelman plotted essay length versus essay score on the new SAT from released essays and found a high correlation between them. After studying 23 graded essays, he found that the longer the essay was, the higher its score. Perelman found that he could accurately determine the score of an essay without even reading the essay. In his study, he discovered that several of these essays were full of factual inaccuracies. The College Board does not claim to grade for factual accuracy.

Perelman, along with the National Council of Teachers of English, also criticized the 25-minute writing section of the test for damaging standards of writing taught in the classroom. They say that writing teachers training their students for the SAT will not instill revision, depth, and accuracy but will instead guide them to produce long, formulaic, and wordy pieces. &quot;You&#x27;re getting teachers to train students to be bad writers&quot;, concluded Perelman.

===Advanced Placement classes===
Some teachers have criticized AP classes as restrictive in the nature of their curriculum and yet indispensable due to the importance of AP classes in the college admissions process. The College Board can effectively control every aspect of AP classes directly or indirectly. The $97 fee, which is noted critically above, results only in a score report with the test name and grade. No details are given on how this scoring was reached nor are individuals given access to this information from College Board.

Additionally, starting with a pilot program in 2018 and officially rolling out to all schools in 2019, the College Board required students to sign up for AP tests during the fall before early-round college decisions are out. While the College Board stated that this was to ensure students commit to learning the material at the beginning of the year, the move drew criticism from students, stating that because they do not know whether or not the college they end up attending will grant credit for the test, the new, early registration deadline forces students to pay for tests that they will receive no benefit from. The College Board also charges $40 if a student does not sit for a test that they signed up for, meaning that many students who signed up for tests that would not grant them any credit still have to sit for those tests or pay the $40 fee.

Traditionally, AP exams are given in a school setting and last two to four hours. However, in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the College Board created an alternate form of AP testing for that year. Students were to take exams at home in a shortened 45-minute, open-book format. During the exams, there were reports of disruptions in the process, such as students being unable to submit their answers, general confusion about the test process, and more.

===Reporting errors===
In March 2006, it was discovered that the College Board had incorrectly scored several thousand tests taken in October 2005. Although the Board was aware of the error as early as December, it waited months to respond, and in late March, schools still did not have the correct details. Within days of the first announcement, the Board corrected the number of affected students upward.

Many colleges use the SAT score to decide acceptance and scholarships. The late reporting of errors upset many high-profile colleges. The dean of admissions at Pomona College commented, &quot;Everybody appears to be telling half-truths, and that erodes confidence in the College Board...It looks like they hired the people who used to do the books for Enron&quot;.

===Sale of student data===
, the College Board charges $0.50 per name for access to student information. An investigation by the New York Civil Liberties Union revealed that one of the College Board&#x27;s customers was JAMRS, a military recruitment program run by the United States Department of Defense. The College Board and ACT have been sued over the use of this information. In addition, there is criticism that students are not sufficiently made aware that their data is being sold, or that disclosure of certain data is optional. The College Board has received substantial backlash for these practices.

===Recycling SAT exams===
On August 25, 2018, the SAT given in America was a recycled October 2017 international SAT given in China. The leaked PDF file was on the internet before the August 25, 2018 exam.

=== Relationship with Hanban ===
In 2004, Hanban and the College Board developed the &quot;AP Chinese Language and Culture Course and Exam&quot; program.

In October 2020, the College Board announced its intention to terminate financial ties with Hanban, in place since 2006, following a letter from U.S. senators critical of the relationship due to its affiliation with the Chinese government.

<text>Saunders-Roe Limited, also known as Saro, was a British aerospace and marine-engineering company based at Columbine Works, East Cowes, Isle of Wight.

==History==

The name was adopted in 1929 after Alliott Verdon Roe (see Avro) and John Lord took a controlling interest in the aircraft and boat-builders S. E. Saunders. Prior to this (excepting for the Sopwith/Saunders Bat Boat) the products were Saunders, the A4 Medina for example dating from 1926. Sam Saunders, the founder, developed the Consuta material used in marine and aviation craft.

The Saunders-Roe interest in aviation didn’t prevent the firm from continuing with the boatbuilding activities associated with S. E. Saunders Ltd.

Saunders Roe concentrated on producing flying-boats, but none were produced in very large quantities – the longest run being 31 Londons. They also produced hulls for the Blackburn Bluebird. During the Second World War, Saro manufactured Supermarine Walrus and Supermarine Sea Otters. Their works at Beaumaris, Anglesey, modified and serviced Catalinas for the Royal Air Force.

In January 1931 &quot;Flight&quot; magazine revealed that Whitehall Securities Corporation Limited acquired a substantial holding in Saunders Roe. Whitehall Securities was already a large shareholder in Spartan Aircraft Ltd, of Southampton, and arising out of this investment Spartan was effectively merged into Saunders Roe.

In 1938 Saunders-Roe undertook a re-organisation of the commercial and administrative sides of its business. First, the marine section, consisting of the shipyard and boat-building business, was transferred to a new company, Saunders Shipyard Ltd., all of the shares of which were owned by Saunders-Roe Ltd. Mr. C. Inglis was appointed shipyard manager. Secondly, the plywood section of the business carried on at the factory on the River Medina was transferred to a new company, Saro Laminated Wood Products Ltd., in consideration for a majority of the shares therein. Laminated Wood Products Ltd., which had marketed most of the plywood output, also merged its interests into the new company. Major Darwin, managing director, left the company. On the aircraft side of the business Mr. Broadsmith continued as director and general manager. All other senior posts in the executive staff remain unchanged.

In 1947 they flew the SR.A/1 fighter prototype, one of the world&#x27;s first jet-powered flying boats, and in 1952 they flew the prototype Princess airliner, but the age of the flying-boat was over and the two further Princess examples to be completed were never flown. No further new seaplanes were produced here. Modification work on Short-built flying boats continued at Cowes until 1955. 
The last fixed-wing aircraft they built was the experimental SR53 mixed-power interceptor.

In 1951 Saunders-Roe took over the interests of the Cierva Autogiro Company at Eastleigh including the Skeeter helicopter project. 
In September 1952 the company comprised:
* Saunders-Roe Ltd. with a Head Office in Osborne, East Cowes, Isle of Wight (I.O.W.) with works at Columbine I.O.W. and Southampton Airport.
There was a branch design office in London, during the 1950s. It was situated in Queens Square, overlooking the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children
* Saunders-Roe (Anglesey) Ltd, Friars Works, Beaumaris, North Wales
* Saro Laminated Wood Products Ltd., Folly Works, Whippingham, I.O.W.
* Princess Air Transport Co. Ltd of Osborne I.O.W. with an office in London at 45 Parliament St. SW1.

In 1959 it demonstrated the first practical hovercraft built under contract to the National Research Development Corporation to Christopher Cockerell&#x27;s design, the SR.N1.

In the same year Saro&#x27;s helicopter and hovercraft interests were taken over by Westland Aircraft which continued the Skeeter family with the Scout and Wasp. In 1964 all the hovercraft businesses under Westland were merged with Vickers-Armstrongs to form the British Hovercraft Corporation. This, in turn, was taken over by Westland and was renamed Westland Aerospace in 1985, and hovercraft production was reduced to nearly nothing until the advent of the AP1-88. The company produced sub contract work for Britten-Norman, produced composites and component parts for the aircraft industry, especially engine nacelles for many aircraft including the De Havilland Canada &quot;Dash 8&quot;, the Lockheed Hercules, the British Aerospace Jetstream and parts for the McDonnell-Douglas MD-11. By the mid-1990s, over 60% of the world&#x27;s production of turboprop nacelles took place in the East Cowes works.

In the late 1960s/early 1970s the Saunders-Roe Folly Works, by then owned by Hawker Siddeley was merged with the Gloster works to form Gloster-Saro utilising both companies&#x27; expertise in aluminium forming to produce fire appliances and tankers in the Gloster factory at Hucclecote, mostly based on Reynolds-Boughton chassis. In 1984 Gloster Saro acquired the fire tender business of the Chubb group with the company merging in 1987 with Simon Engineering to form Simon Gloster Saro.

In 1994 Westland was taken over by GKN, and when GKN sold off its shares of Westland to form Agusta-Westland, it retained the East Cowes works, where it continues aircraft component design and production.

Laird (Anglesey) Ltd was formed in 1968 and incorporated the Beaumaris and Llangefni factories of Saunders-Roe and the engineering business of Birkenhead shipbuilders Cammell Laird. Laird developed the Centaur, which was half Land Rover and half light tank. The company is now known as FAUN Municipal Vehicles Ltd.having been taken over yet again. Today, FAUN manufactures portable aluminium roadways and runways at Llangefni under its TRACKWAY brand.
In 2015, the East Cowes Columbine Hangar, which later became notable for its large Union Jack painted on its doors, was leased from the Homes &amp; Communities Agency to Shemara Refit, now known as Wight Shipyard Co. Ltd, to refit MY Shemara. They also constructed the catamaran ferry Red Jet 6 inside the hangar for Red Funnel Ferries, with the next in the series, &quot;Red Jet 7&quot;, also built there. The GKN North site had been sold in 2002 for £8m to the South East England Development Agency (an English regional development agency closed by the UK government in 2012) for the regeneration of East Cowes. This stalled with the financial crash in 2008 and is set never to achieve the site&#x27;s full potential as a deep water Prime Tier 1 Marine Industrial Site.

The docks at the Columbine Hangar have also been used by Red Funnel as berths for their &quot;Red Jet&quot; catamaran ferries when not in use; for example, &quot;Red Jet 6&quot; was berthed at the Columbine while undergoing system tests, while &quot;Red Jet 3&quot; was docked there while on sale awaiting a buyer during 2018.

The Rocket Development Division was formed in 1956 and the Rocket Test site at Highdown started functioning exactly one year later. The division was headquartered at Yeovil. It was this division, in conjunction with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, that was responsible for the design, manufacture and static testing of the Black Knight Rocket, the first of which was successfully fired at Woomera, South Australia, on 7 September 1958.

===Military canoes, assault boats and load carriers (World War II)===
Designed by Fred Goatley# Marine designer
Mark 2 Canoe – 1941–1942 (used on the Cockleshell Heroes &quot;Frankton Raid&quot;)
Mk 2** Canoe – 1943 ( used in Leros – various, incl. Sunbeam Raids )
12-man Assault craft c. 1940–1942
8 ton load carrier. c. 1942–1943

==Electronics==
The Electronics Division was formed in 1948. Its progress was rapid and the division also designed and manufactured such diverse specialist equipment as Analogue Computers, Control Simulators and a variety of Electronic Equipment and Electronic Test sets associated with Guided Weapons. When using strain gauges of the normal wire type in the dynamic testing of helicopter components, notably rotor blades, Saunders-Roe found that such a high proportion of the gauges were failing that development was considerably retarded. The Electronics Division was therefore asked to devise an improved gauge and, in collaboration with Messrs. Technograph Printed Circuits Ltd., produced the foil strain gauge.

== Hydrofoil ==
* R-103– a 17-ton hydrofoil for Royal Canadian Navy, known as &quot;Bras d&#x27;Or&quot;. Built in 1956 by Saunders-Roe (Anglesey) Ltd. (This should not be confused with HMCS &quot;Bras d&#x27;Or&quot;, a 240 tonne hydrofoil patrol vessel, which was the result of the tests performed by the R-103.)

==Illuminated signs==
Early in aviation, it was difficult – if not impossible – to supply uninterrupted power in aircraft. Saunders-Roe solved this problem by putting an ionising gas (tritium; 3H) in small tubes. Tritium was discovered in 1934 by Lord Rutherford. The tubes (&quot;Betalights&quot;) are made of borosilicate glass. The inside of the tubes is coated with a fluorescent powder, which glows as a result of the ionizing radiation of the tritium gas. Such a tube emits light for 15 years. Betalights were used to illuminate the flight instruments, exit signs and corridors of the aircraft produced by Saunders-Roe. When Saunders-Roe was acquired by Westland Helicopters production continued via Saunders-Roe Developments Ltd of North Hyde Road, Hayes, Middlesex (the former Fairey Aviation Head office). Betalight production was made independent under the name SRBT (Saunders-Roe Betalight Technology). A factory was established in Pembroke, Ontario, Canada, where tritium supplies are readily available. Today betalights are used in self luminous escape-route signs, under the product name Betalux.

==Mark 3 airborne lifeboat==
In early 1953, Saunders-Roe at Anglesey completed the Mark 3 airborne lifeboat to be fitted underneath the Avro Shackleton maritime reconnaissance aircraft. This model was made entirely of aluminium, previous marks being made of timber. Parachuted at a rate of 20 feet per second into the rescue zone, the craft was powered by a Vincent motorcycles HRD T5 15 hp engine; sails and a fishing kit were also provided. The Mark 3 measured from bow to stern and across the beam and held enough to supply 10 people with food and water for 14 days.

==Road vehicles==
During World War II, Saunders-Roe opened a factory at Fryars in Llanfaes, Anglesey, converting and maintaining Catalina flying boats. In the late 1940s and 1950s the Beaumaris factory began making bus bodies under the names Saunders, SEAS (Saunders Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding) and SARO. When AEC took over Crossley Motors, many of the design staff left and joined SARO. In pre-Atlantean days when Leyland began looking at low floor vehicles, the &quot;Low Loader&quot; (STF 90) bodied by SARO was similar in certain respects to the Crossley chassisless bus designs. Bodies were manufactured at Beaumaris for installing on &quot;Leyland Royal Tiger&quot; and &quot;Leyland Tiger Cub&quot; chassis; SARO bodied 250 RTs for London Transport between 1948 and 1950 (RT 1152–1401), which were almost indistinguishable from the standard Weymann/Park Royal products; and some double-deck buses for Liverpool Corporation. 620 prefabricated Rivalloy (the brand name comes from rivetted (aluminium) alloy) single deck buses components for local assembly were sold to Autobuses Modernos SA, Cuba which later became Omnibus Metropolitanos, S.A. Another large customer was Auckland Regional Transport in New Zealand who took the Rivalloy body on 90 Daimler Freeline chassis. In 1948 the only double deck bodies to be exported were 20 ordered by South African operator Durban Motor Transport which were mounted on AEC Regent Mark III chassis.
In the UK large numbers of SARO bodies were specified by the British Electric Traction group on Leyland Tiger Cub chassis, operators including Trent, East Midland, Ribble, Yorkshire Traction and the Northern General Group. An integral version of the body design powered by a Gardner 5HLW engine was bought by Maidstone &amp; District.

The factory later passed to Cammell Laird who mainly used it for producing refuse-collection vehicles, but when Metro Cammell Weymann had a production backlog, they completed a batch of MCW-style double deck forward-entrance highbridge bodies on Leyland Titan PD3 for Brighton Corporation, these were numbered 31–5, registered LUF131-5F and delivered in June and July 1968, they were unusual as front engined half-cab buses built to be driver operated.

<text>Invision Community is a brand of forum software developed in 2002 and originally marketed as Invision Power Board. The current version of the software was written in PHP and uses MySQL for database storage. 

Invision Power Services (IPS) was created in 2002 by Charles Warner and Matt Mecham after they left Jarvis Entertainment Group, which had bought the forum software Ikonboard from Mecham. Their first product sold by IPS was the forum software Invision Power Board, which quickly gathered a community of former Ikonboard users.

The software has been marketed for over twenty years and has been updated and changed over that timeframe. 

== Version 1.x.x ==
Early releases of Invision Power Board were available as a download free of charge under a proprietary license. 
== Version 2.x.x ==

In 2004 Invision Power Board ended its free releases for non-commercial uses. 

After the 2.0.1 update, the free downloads were replaced with a free demo with restrictions of 5000 posts, 1000 threads, 200 members and other restrictions, thus ending its claims that Invision Power Board would be free forever thereby upsetting many users. In version 2.3, the product shipped with 2 skins, the classic light blue skin and a new default darker skin. 

== Version 3.x.x ==

Version 3.0 was initially released on Tuesday, June 23, 2009. 

== Version 4.x.x ==

In May of 2012, Version 4.0 represented a ground-up rewrite of Invision Power Board and related offerings. 

With the release of IP.Suite 4.0, IPS has decided to no longer honor the perpetual lifetime licenses they have sold earlier. As a compensation for legacy customers, they offered a free transition period to the standard license type before legacy customers would be required to pay their first renewal if they wanted to continue to receive support and future updates.

The first officially supported release was version 4.0.0 on 9 April 2015. IP.Suite 4 was not properly announced as released until 16 June, at which point it had already reached version 4.0.8.

<text>August Ludwig von Schlözer (5 July 1735, in Gaggstatt – 9 September 1809, in Göttingen) was a German historian and pedagogist who laid foundations for the critical study of Russian medieval history. He was a member of the Göttingen school of history.

==Early career==
August Ludwig von Schlözer was born at Gaggstatt, Hohenlohe-Kirchberg (today Kirchberg an der Jagst), Württemberg. His father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all were Protestant clergymen. In 1751, he followed them and began his studies in theology in University of Wittenberg, moving in 1754 to the increasingly renowned University of Göttingen to study history. After his studies, in 1755 he went to work as a tutor in Stockholm, where he spent a year and a half as tutor in the family of the minister of the German congregation, and during 1756/1757 in Uppsala, studying Old Norse and Gothic with the philologist Johan Ihre, then again in Stockholm as secretary of a German merchant. While in Sweden he wrote an &quot;Essay on the General History of Trade and of Seafaring in the Most Ancient Times&quot; (1758, in Swedish) on Phoenicians, which together with a publication on Swedish history made him fairly well known. In 1759, he returned to Göttingen, where he began the study of medicine.

In 1761, he went to St. Petersburg with Gerhardt Friedrich Müller, the Russian historiographer, as Müller&#x27;s literary assistant and as tutor in his family. Here Schlözer learned Russian and devoted himself to the study of Russian history. In 1762, a quarrel with Müller placed him in a position of some difficulty from which he was delivered by an introduction to Count Rasumovski, who procured his appointment as adjunct to the Academy. In 1765, he was appointed by the Empress Catherine an ordinary member of the Academy and professor of Russian history. In 1767, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

==Return to Göttingen==
In 1767, he left Russia on leave and did not return. He settled at Göttingen, where in 1764 he had been made &quot;professor extraordinarius&quot;, and &quot;doctor honoris causa&quot; in 1766, and in 1769 he was promoted to an ordinary professorship. Schlözer was acknowledged a brilliant professor who drew crowds of students, among whom were Arnold Heeren, Karl Friedrich Eichhorn and Johannes von Müller. Schlözer had broad interests. He translated a pedagogical piece by the Frenchman La Chalotais in 1771, as well as a travel book about Jamaica for children and an introductory work on world history (&quot;Vorbereitung zur Weltgeschichte für Kinder&quot;, 1779). Schlözer criticised harshly Johann Bernhard Basedow, a then famous pedagogue, for his education approach using games and for his separation of girls and boys education.

Schlözer&#x27;s activity was enormous, and he exercised great influence by his lectures as well as by his books, bringing historical study into touch with political science generally, and using his vast erudition in an attempt to solve practical questions in the state and in society. Schlözer was interested in politics and statistics. He was a proponent of John Locke and Montesquieu. Statistics were also important to him for their informational value for government. His exchange of ideas about the study of people and society with Adam F. Kollár in Vienna helped Kollár to clarify his own approach, incorporate and broaden some of Schlözer&#x27;s views and eventually coin the term &quot;ethnology&quot; and provide its first definition in 1783.

Between 1776 and 1782, he had his own political periodical: &quot;A.L. Schlözer&#x27;s Briefwechsel meist historischen und politischen Inhalts&quot; (10 vols.); continued between 1782 and 1793 with the name &quot;A.L. Schlözer&#x27;s Staats-Anzeigen&quot; (18 vols.) by which he produced a strong impression. This periodical criticised the German government harshly, and was widely read with up to 4400 subscribers. It was first in German to publish the declaration of human rights in 1791. In 1793, the government prohibited the publication of the &quot;Staats-Anzeigen&quot;.

Schlözer was a versatile historian giving lectures on a range of issues including Oliver Cromwell, the Dutch revolution, banks, the French Revolution (already in 1790), luxury, and the history of Germans in Romania, while continuing publishing on Russian history. His &quot;Allgemeine nordische Geschichte&quot; (General northern history), 2 vols. (Halle, 1772) was long considered a reference work on Russian history. He translated the famous Nestor Chronicle to the year 980, 5 vols. (Göttingen, 1802–1809). In 1769 he started lecturing on general world history, a topic reserved to the most educated in that time. The growing knowledge of other continents and the past posed a challenge to historians. How to compress all this information in history books in an understandable way? And what are the criteria for selecting and sorting information? In other words, scholars sought fundamental threads in history. Hundreds of articles and books addressed this question in the second half of the 18th century, drawing famous intellectuals including Herder and Schiller. Schlözer contributed to these discussions and published his &quot;Vorstellung einer Universalgeschichte&quot; in 1772. He continued to improve this piece in the following decades, until finalising the &quot;Weltgeschichte nach ihren Haupttheilen im Auszug und Zusammenhange&quot; (&quot;Main elements of world history in excerpts and context&quot;), 2 vols (2nd ed., Göttingen, 1792–1801).

==World History==
The &quot;Weltgeschichte&quot; (World History) provides guidance for education. Parts of this piece appear unfinished and it sometimes has a halting style. Some of its ideas are outdated. However, other ideas have more substance, one of which is globally applied until today as we will see in the following. The &quot;Weltgeschichte&quot; offers insight on the state of science at that time. Schlözer tackled three challenges: the scope, the topic and the structure of a global history.

Since Schlözer opposed a strictly European perspective, the scope was the entire mankind. Moreover, he included all classes of society and social and cultural developments. The development of glass by the Phoenicians and the introduction of potatoes in Europe were more important than the names of the Chinese or German emperors.

The central topic was development and the influence of historical events on today. Schlözer identified five fundamental factors for development: &quot;Die Lebensart bestimmt, Klima und Nahrungsart erschafft, der Herrscher zwingt, der Priester lehrt, und das Beispiel reisst fort&quot;. (Schlözer, &quot;Weltgeschichte I&quot;, 66) – &quot;The life-style determines, climate and nutrition creates, the sovereign forces, the priest teaches, and the example inspires.&quot;

Schlözer also developed a structure for a universal history, separating it in six epochs:
*&quot;Urwelt&quot; (primeval world) – from the creation to the Flood
*&quot;Dunkle Welt&quot; (dark world) – from the flood to Moses and the first written sources
*&quot;Vorwelt&quot; (preworld) – up to the Persian Empire
*&quot;Alte Welt&quot; (old world) – up to the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 AD
*&quot;Mittelalter&quot; (Middle Ages) – up to the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492
*&quot;Neue Welt&quot; (the new world) – up to the present

This classification was not new, except for setting the Middle Ages between 476 and 1492, which he as well as his colleague and rival in Göttingen Johann Christoph Gatterer suggested roughly at the same time. These time borders for the Middle Ages are still accepted today.

Schlözer&#x27;s most important innovation, however, was his suggestion to count backwards from the birth of Jesus. An incentive for this was the growing disbelief of the biblical Creation and the then generally acknowledged creation date of 3987 BC. First speculations that the Sun and the Earth were perhaps created tens of thousands of years ago emerged in the 18th century. Schlözer&#x27;s suggestion offered room for further theories about the creation of the Earth. Schlözer mentioned in a footnote that he adopted this idea from foreign historians, but did not reveal them. Whoever they were, Schlözer was the one to introduce this novel chronology into the European history, an act of tremendous importance for it was the fundamental for all ancient history. According to the philosopher Hannah Arendt, this new method enabled man to look back &quot;into an indefinite past to which one can add at will and into which we can inquire further as it stretches ahead&quot;. August Ludwig von Schlözer was instrumental in abandoning Creation beliefs of our collective consciousness, more than anybody else.

In 1804, Schlözer was ennobled by the emperor Alexander I of Russia and made a privy councillor. He retired from active work in 1805. He was much admired by the new Russian historiographer Nikolai Karamzin, while the professors Mikhail Kachenovsky and Mikhail Pogodin proclaimed themselves Schlozer&#x27;s followers.

==Family life==
Schlözer, who in 1769 married Caroline Roederer, daughter of Johann Georg Roederer (1726–1763), professor of medicine at Göttingen and body physician to the king of England, left five children. His daughter Dorothea, born on 10 August 1770, was one of the most beautiful and learned women of her time, and received in 1787 the degree of doctor. She was recognized as an authority on several subjects, especially on Russian coinage. After her marriage with Rodde, a burgomaster of Lübeck, she devoted herself to domestic duties. She died on 12 July 1825 (see Reuter, &quot;Dorothea Schlözer&quot;, Göttingen, 1887). Schlözer&#x27;s son Christian (1774–1831) was a professor at Bonn, and published &quot;Anfangsgründe der Staatswirthschaft&quot; (1804–1806) and his father&#x27;s &quot;Öffentliches und Privat-Leben aus Originalurkunden&quot; (1828). The youngest son, Karl von Schlözer, a merchant and Russian consul-general at Lübeck, was the father of Kurd von Schlözer (1822–1894), the historian and diplomatist, who in 1871 was appointed German ambassador to the United States and in 1882 to the Vatican, when he was instrumental in healing the breach between Germany and the papacy caused by the May Laws.

<text>Ballistic gelatin is a testing medium designed to simulate the effects of bullet wounds in animal muscle tissue. It was developed and improved by Martin Fackler and others in the field of wound ballistics. It is calibrated to match pig muscle, which is ballistically similar to human muscle tissue.

Ballistic gelatin is traditionally a solution of gelatin powder in water. Ballistic gelatin closely simulates the density and viscosity of human and animal muscle tissue, and is used as a standardized medium for testing the terminal performance of firearms ammunition. While ballistic gelatin does not model the tensile strength of muscles or the structures of the body such as skin and bones, it works fairly well as an approximation of tissue and provides similar performance for most ballistics testing; however, its usefulness as a model for very low velocity projectiles can be limited. Ballistic gelatin is used rather than actual muscle tissue due to the ability to carefully control the properties of the gelatin, which allows consistent and reliable comparison of terminal ballistics.

==History==
The FBI introduced its own testing protocol in December 1988 as a response to the 1986 Miami shootout, and it quickly became popular among US law enforcement agencies.

==Preparation==
===Gelatin formula===
The most commonly used formula is an FBI-style 10% ballistic gelatin, which is prepared by dissolving one part 250 bloom type A gelatin into nine parts of warm water (by mass), mixing the water while pouring in the powdered gelatin. It is chilled to . The older NATO formula specifies a 20% solution, chilled to , but that solution costs more to prepare, as it uses twice the amount of the gelatin.

In either case, a 1988 research paper by Martin Fackler recommends that the water should not be heated above , as this can cause a significant change in the ballistic performance. However, this result does not seem to be reproduced in a later study.

===Calibration===
To ensure accurate results, immediately prior to use, the gelatin block is calibrated by firing a standard .177 caliber () steel BB from an air gun over a gun chronograph into the gelatin, and the depth of penetration measured. While the exact calibration methods vary slightly, the calibration method used by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service&#x27;s National Firearms Unit is fairly typical. It requires a velocity of , and a BB penetration between .

In his book &quot;Bullet Penetration&quot;, ballistics expert Duncan MacPherson describes a method that can be used to compensate for ballistic gelatin that gives a BB penetration that is off by several centimeters (up to two inches) in either direction. MacPherson&#x27;s Figure 5-2, Velocity Variation Correction to Measured BB Penetration Depth, can be used to make corrections to BB penetration depth when measured BB velocity is within ±10 m/s of 180 m/s. This method can also be used to compensate for error within the allowed tolerance, and normalize results of different tests, as it is standard practice to record the exact depth of the calibration BB&#x27;s penetration.

===Synthetic alternative===
Ballistic gels made from natural gelatin are typically clear yellow-brown in color, and are generally not re-usable. The more expensive synthetic substitutes are engineered to simulate the ballistic properties of natural gelatin, whilst initially being colorless and clear. Some synthetic gels are also re-usable, since they can be melted and reformed without affecting the ballistic properties of the gels.

===Synthetic formula===
Synthetic ballistic gels are typically made of an oil and a polymer instead of gelatin and water, most commonly used is white mineral oil and a styrene polymer blend, polymers used include: 

# styrene-butadiene-styrene polymers;
# styrene isoprene-styrene polymers;
# styrene-ethylene-butylene styrene polymers;
# styrene-ethylenepropylene polymers;
# styrene-ethylene butylene polymers;
# styrene-butadiene polymers; and
# styrene-isoprene polymers. 

The gel usually includes about 12% to 22% by weight of the polymer, but it depends on what polymers is used.

Heating temperatures vary depending on what polymer and oil is used, but should never go over .

The polymer and oil solution is extremely sensitive to moisture - when moisture comes in contact with the solution, bubbles form when heat is applied.

Polymer should not be added to heated up oil like gelatin is to water; the polymer and oil should be mixed when no heat is present. 

Dwell times are recommended after mixing the polymer and oil to prevent bubbles forming when heat is applied. These &quot;dwell&quot; times can go up to 12 hours if the air is above about 50 °F, or at the very least 24 hours if the air is at cooler temperatures.

These discoveries were made by Darryl D. Amick.

==Uses==
Since ballistic gelatin mimics the properties of muscle tissue reasonably well, it is the preferred medium (over real porcine cadavers) for comparing the terminal performance of different expanding ammunition, such as hollow-point and soft-point bullets. These bullets use the hydraulic pressure of the tissue or gelatin to expand in diameter, limiting penetration and increasing the tissue damage along their path. While the Hague Convention restricts the use of such ammunition in warfare, it is commonly used by police and civilians in defensive weapons, as well as police sniper and hostage-rescue teams, where rapid disabling of the target and minimal risk of overpenetration are required to reduce collateral damage.

Bullets intended for hunting are also commonly tested in ballistic gelatin. A bullet intended for use hunting small vermin, such as prairie dogs, for example, needs to expand very quickly to have an effect before it exits the target, and must perform at higher velocities due to the use of lighter bullets in the cartridges. The same fast-expanding bullet used for prairie dogs would be considered inhumane for use on medium game animals like whitetail deer, where deeper penetration is needed to reach vital organs and assure a quick kill.

In television the &quot;MythBusters&quot; team sometimes used ballistics gel to aid in busting myths, but not necessarily involving bullets, including the exploding implants myth, the deadly card throw, and the ceiling fan decapitation. They sometimes placed real bones (from humans or pigs) or synthetic bones in the gel to simulate bone breaks as well.

The US television program &quot;Forged in Fire&quot; is also known to use ballistics gelatin, often creating entire human torsos and heads complete with simulated bones, blood, organs and intestines that are cast inside the gel. Various bladed weapons are then tested on the gel torso in order to simulate and record the destructive effects the weapons would have on a real human body.

<doc id="586071" wikidata="Q320935" url="?curid=586071" title="Nestor the Chronicler">
<text>Nestor the Chronicler or Nestor the Hagiographer (; 1056 – 1114) was a monk from the Kievan Rus who is known to have written two saints&#x27; lives: the &quot;Life of the Venerable Theodosius of the Kiev Caves&quot; and the &quot;Account about the Life and Martyrdom of the Blessed Passion Bearers Boris and Gleb.&quot; 

Traditional historiography has also attributed to him the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; (PVL), the most revered chronicle of Kievan Rus&#x27;, which earned him the nickname &quot;the Chronicler&quot;. But several modern scholars have concluded he was not the author, because the &quot;Chronicle&quot; and known works of Nestor barely align, and frequently contradict each other in terms of style and contents. Given the authorship controversy, some scholars prefer calling him Nestor &quot;the Hagiographer&quot;, to be identified with the two hagiographies which they do agree that he did write.

== Biography ==

In 1073 AD, Nestor was a monk of the Monastery of the Caves in Kiev. The only other detail of his life that is reliably known is that he was commissioned with two other monks to find the relics of St. Theodosius of Kiev, a mission which he fulfilled successfully.

Nestor died around 1114 and was buried in the Near Caves. He has been glorified (canonized) as a saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church. The body of St. Nestor is among the relics preserved in the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. His feast day is celebrated on October 27. He is also commemorated in common with other saints of the Kiev Caves Lavra on September 28 (Synaxis of the Venerable Fathers of the Kiev Caves) and on the Second Sunday of Great Lent.

<text>Canton Island (also known as Kanton or Abariringa), previously known as Mary Island, Mary Balcout&#x27;s Island or Swallow Island, is the largest, northernmost, and , the sole inhabited island of the Phoenix Islands, in the Republic of Kiribati. It is an atoll located in the South Pacific Ocean roughly halfway between Hawaii and Fiji. The island is a narrow ribbon of land around a lagoon; an area of . Canton&#x27;s closest neighbour is the uninhabited Enderbury Island, west-southwest. The capital of Kiribati, South Tarawa, lies to the west. , the population was 20, down from 61 in 2000. The island&#x27;s sole village, Tebaronga, is located on the northwest point, below the airstrip.

Kiribati declared the Phoenix Islands Protected Area in 2006, with the park being expanded in 2008. The marine reserve contains eight coral atolls, including Canton. Because it is inhabited, management of Canton Island is described in the Canton Resource Use Sustainability Plan (KRUSP), which covers a radius around the atoll. Over 50% of the island and lagoon are protected in a conservation zone.

==Discovery and toponymy of Canton Island==
On 5 August 1824, the whaler &quot;Phœnix&quot; of London (master John Palmer) in the company of whaler &quot;Mary&quot; of London, came to a low and barren island with a spacious lagoon, in latitude 2° 48ʹ S and longitude 172° 10ʹ W, and it was named &quot;&quot;Mary Ballcotts Island&quot;.&quot; H.E. Maude and Niel Gunson both assumed this to be the whaler &quot;Mary,&quot; owned by John Lydekker (1778–1832), and that her captain Edward Reed Lacy had reported the island. The entry for 5 August 1824 of that &quot;Mary&#x27;s&quot; logbook, however, mentions no discovery, nor a ship &quot;Phœnix&quot;. The ship &quot;Mary&quot; truly there that day (her master presumably Abijah Lock) was another whaler from London, owned by &quot;Hill, Boulcott &amp; Hill&quot;, a firm consisting of the two brothers James &amp; Amon Hill and their brother-in-law John Ellerker Boulcott. The latter was married to a Mary Boulcott, née Hill, and it was she for whom this island was named. Ever since it was incorrectly penned down as &quot;Mary Ballcotts Island&quot; in William Dalton&#x27;s journal, it has appeared with deviated spelling in books and on charts as Mary-Bulrock, Mary Balcout, Marie Ballcout, etc.

Modern Canton derives its name from the New Bedford whaler &quot;Canton&quot;, which was wrecked on its outer shore in early March 1854. Captain Andrew Johnson Wing (1820–1897) and his full crew managed to save not only themselves but also four small whaleboats and scanty provisions. In late March, the 31 men tried their luck by putting to sea in the four open boats and made their way northwest for 49 days straight when finally they reached safety in Guam, 2,900 nautical miles from where they had started. Kanton is spelled with a K in the Gilbertese language, which has no letter C. The two versions of the name exist in the Constitution of 1979.

==Geography, flora and fauna==
===Canton&#x27;s flora and fauna===

Canton has been described as being shaped like a large pork chop. From its northwest to southeast points is a distance of , while the land rim varies in width from and in elevation. The southeast corner of the island is known as &quot;Pyramid Point.&quot; The sole entrances to the lagoon are on the west side, with the main channel exhibiting currents of . The lagoon itself is filled with marine life, holding 153 different species of fish, including tuna, sharks, stingrays and eels. An unpaved road runs around the island, though its current state of repair is uncertain. Canton Island Airport (IATA: CIS, ICAO: PCIS) lies at the northwest corner of the island, but it currently lacks any commercial scheduled service. The World Port Index number of Canton Island is 56025.
Much of Canton&#x27;s land surface is bare coral, sparsely covered with herbs and low bunch grass; trees and bushes are found near the village site. According to Edwin H. Bryan&#x27;s &quot;American Polynesia and the Hawaiian Chain&quot;, Canton possessed in 1941 a total of twelve native species of vegetation, including low herbs and bunch grass, a thick stand of &quot;Scaevola&quot; shrubs on the island&#x27;s south side ( high), some &quot;Suriana maritima&quot; shrubs near the lagoon entrance, heliotrope (&quot;Heliotropium foertherianum&quot;) and kou (&quot;Cordia subcordata&quot;) trees, and coconut palms. Geoffrey Buddle of the New Zealand solar eclipse expedition of 1937 reported 23 bird species on Canton, together with Polynesian rats, lizards, hermit crabs and turtles. Two species of spiders were found on the island.
There is no fresh water on Canton except for rainwater caught in cisterns; Pan American World Airways had a large distillation plant on the island when it operated there during the 1940s and 1950s. Rainfall is sparse, averaging between 1938 and 1953, though later reports suggest a wetter climate in recent years.

===Canton&#x27;s reefs===
The 2000 surveys (Obura, et al.) identified that at the entrance to the lagoon very strong tidal flows pass through with extensive coral gardens extending for a radius of approximately from the channel. At about inside of the channel, the lagoon is crossed by four north–south reef ledges, which reduce water flow and suppress coral growth. The coral gardens zone contains &quot;Acropora&quot; tables and &quot;Acroporidae&quot; (staghorn corals), growing over a sandy bottom. Coral communities were more highly developed on the Kanton reefs than on other islands in the Phoenix Group. The high end LCC for some sites was greater than 50% and approaching 100% on some small patch reefs. The average conditions with 30-40% LCC, with a relatively high abundance of coral rubble, sand, with turf and fleshy algae. Coralline algae and &quot;Halimeda&quot; were less abundant than at Nikumaroro or McKean. The most abundant coral species at Kanton included: &quot;Acroporidae&quot; (staghorn corals), &quot;Acropora cytherea&quot;, &quot;Montipora efflorescens&quot;, &quot;Goniastrea stelligera&quot;, &quot;Echinopora lamellosa&quot;, &quot;Leptastrea purpurea&quot;, &quot;Pocillopora verrucosa&quot;, &quot;Millepora platyphylla&quot;, &quot;Pavona explanulata&quot; and &quot;Pavona varians&quot;.

==History==
===British claims===
The British laid claim to Canton Island during the 1850s. The official British claim was formally reasserted on 6 August 1936, and an order in council issued in March 1937 including Canton and other Phoenix Islands in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony, with the British making several visits to the island culminating in the placement of two radio operators on Canton on 31 August 1937.

===Americans arrive===

On 8 June 1937, Canton was the site of a total solar eclipse and the island was occupied briefly by American and New Zealand scientists, members of an expedition organized by the National Geographic Society, and led by the astronomer Samuel Alfred Mitchell. During this time, the American party claimed the island for the United States, erecting a small monument with two American flags. According to one account, the British warship HMS &quot;Wellington&quot; fired a shot across the bow of the USS &quot;Avocet&quot;, when the latter refused to cede the choicest anchorage spot to the British vessel. The American ship allegedly responded in kind, following which both captains agreed to &quot;cease fire&quot; until instructions could be received from their respective governments. Washington and London quickly ordered no further escalation, and both parties observed the solar eclipse together, &quot;though officially a bit cool.&quot;

In response to the British reoccupation of Canton in August 1937, seven Americans from the American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project landed on the island on 7 March 1938. Although the British ambassador to the United States requested removal of markers claiming U.S. sovereignty, President Franklin Roosevelt had formally placed the island under control of the U.S. Interior department on 3 March 1938. Both parties continued to press their competing claims until 6 April 1939, when the U.S. and Britain agreed to hold Canton under joint control for the next fifty years as the Canton and Enderbury Islands condominium. The U.S./U.K. tenure proved cordial and cooperative thereafter, with each party enjoying the other&#x27;s hospitality and working together to ensure smooth operation of island facilities. A United States office was open between 1940 and 1965 and from 1970. Canton Island Post Office opened on 25 January 1941 and closed around February 1968.

===Airplane oasis===
Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) arrived on Canton on 18 May 1939, to build facilities for their planned New Zealand flying boat service. Service commenced on 12 July 1940 with the Boeing 314 Clipper flying boat aircraft. On 4 December 1941, the Pacific Clipper departed Kanton for New Caledonia as the final civilian flight before the United States joined the war.

===World War II===
During World War II the United States Navy built a airstrip at (now known as Canton Island Airport (IATA: CIS, ICAO: PCIS)). Kanton became a stopover point for the Navy Air Transport Service flights to Australia and New Zealand as well as a staging point for attacks on the Gilbert Islands, then held by Japan. The was grounded and abandoned near the island on 14 February 1942 when disembarking troops. It was shelled three times in late 1942 by Japanese submarines, and bombed once on 25 March 1943. Damage was reported as &quot;slight&quot;. The island was defended by approximately 1,200 combat troops and support personnel, but Japanese forces never attempted a landing. It was the site of at least two airplane crashes during the war: on 19 July 1944 and 5 December 1945. After the war moved west, it became the homebase for the Roman Catholic chaplain in this area of the Pacific.

===Post War Administration and international airline service===
In November 1946, Pan Am resumed service to Hawaii, Australia and New Zealand via Canton with Douglas DC-4 aircraft. British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines (BCPA), Australia&#x27;s first trans-Pacific airline, served the island via a cooperative agreement with Australian National Airways (ANA) initially with Douglas DC-4&#x27;s on a routing of Sydney - Auckland - Fiji - Canton Island - Honolulu - San Francisco - Vancouver, with the inaugural flight departing Australia on 15 September 1946. BCPA then began flying luxurious Douglas DC-6Bs on the Sydney to Vancouver route. Qantas took over this service shortly thereafter as BCPA subsequently ceased all operations and went out of business. Canadian Pacific Airlines also used the island as well for its Douglas DC-4 service between Vancouver and the southern hemisphere. A full-scale community was established to support these airline operations, including an electrical power station, a hotel for the airline passengers&#x27; use, a medical dispensary, school for dependent children of station personnel, and other necessary facilities. The island was jointly administered by the United Kingdom and the United States, and the British and American post offices were both operated from a single building. The American administrator, who was an employee of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (predecessor to the FAA) and island manager for that agency, also served as the U.S. resident administrator under the Department of the Interior and as a U.S. special deputy marshal under the Department of Justice. William J. Evans held this position from 1952 to 1956, during which time a crew from &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine visited the island and highlighted it in the magazine&#x27;s January 1955 issue.

Vice-president Richard Nixon and his wife visited the island in October 1953, en route to New Zealand, where they stayed overnight and were interviewed by Fred Carpenter for the local radio station KIBS. By 1956, Pan Am was operating a Boeing 377 Stratocruiser service into the airport from Los Angeles and San Francisco, via a stop in Honolulu, with these flights continuing on to Sydney with a stop at Nadi Airport in Fiji. In 1962, South Pacific Air Lines was offering flag stop service on demand into Canton Island via its scheduled passenger flight between Honolulu and Pago Pago operated with Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation propliners.

Ultimately, the introduction of long-range jet aircraft spelled the end of Canton&#x27;s usefulness as an aircraft refueling station, and all airlines ended their operations there by the late 1950s—except for Pan Am, which continued a monthly service with Douglas DC-7C prop aircraft via Auckland, Nadi, Pago Pago, Kanton, Honolulu and return. This service was conducted using the outbased DC-7C aircraft N743PA and N744PA, which provided feeder service from Auckland to three points on the jet service schedules. The last Pan Am flight was in November 1965 when the final DC-7C returned to Miami after the opening of a new airport in Auckland, enabling New Zealand to be added to Pan Am&#x27;s Boeing 707 jet routes. Canton&#x27;s airport remained operational, however, as an emergency landing field.

===After the airlines===
In 1960 a tracking station for the Mercury program was built on Canton, and used through November 1965. The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Space and Missile Systems Organization continued to use the island for missile-tracking operations through 1976. That year marked the complete end of the American presence; the airfield was abandoned and all U.S. personnel were removed. The British closed their post office, ending their presence on Canton as well. With the independence of Kiribati from Britain in 1979, the Anglo-American condominium was formally terminated, and the island transferred to Kiribati sovereignty. Canton&#x27;s post office was reopened by the Kiribati government, and the island was repopulated with a few people from the more crowded atolls of the Gilbert Islands

Canton is occasionally visited by Republic of Kiribati vessels, the U.S. Coast Guard and various fishing boats. In 2008, Canton and the rest of the Phoenix Islands became the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA), the world&#x27;s largest marine protected area, covering a total area of of land and ocean. In 2007 it was submitted, together with the rest of the PIPA, as a UNESCO World Heritage site. A station of the Global Seismographic Network, IU KNTN, hosted by the Kiribati Weather Service was established in 2007 with current data shown as of August 2016.

In 2010, a British yachtsman and his crew, who were sailing from Hawaii to Australia, stopped at Canton and discovered the 24 islanders (14 adults and 10 children) were dangerously short of food. An expected supply ship had not arrived and the islanders had been living on fish and coconuts for several months. The yacht crew contacted the UK Coastguard, who contacted the U.S. Coast Guard to arrange relief supplies.

<text>Heartattack and Vine is the seventh studio album by Tom Waits, released on September 9, 1980, and his final album to be released on the Asylum label.

&quot;On the Nickel&quot; was recorded for the Ralph Waite film of the same name. It was used as the theme song for the 1985 &quot;The Atlanta Child Murders&quot; miniseries. &quot;Heartattack and Vine&quot; was later recorded by Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins. In 1993 this version was used without Waits&#x27; permission in a Levi&#x27;s commercial, for which Waits took legal action and won a settlement. Jean-Luc Godard used &quot;Ruby&#x27;s Arms&quot; in his 1983 film &quot;First Name: Carmen&quot;. Bruce Springsteen performed &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; live (and was joined onstage by Waits to sing it on August 24, 1981), including it in his retrospective &quot;Live/1975–85&quot;.

==Reception==
Though critical of the album in many respects, including Waits&#x27; vocal delivery and the &quot;morbid pathos&quot; of the ballads, Stephen Holden of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;Tom Waits finds more beauty in the gutter than most people would find in the Garden of Eden,&quot; and referred to him as a &quot;unique and lovable minor talent.&quot;

The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="586079" wikidata="Q3234449" url="?curid=586079" title="Ten Stages Sutra">
<text>The Ten Stages Sutra (Sanskrit: &quot;Daśabhūmika Sūtra&quot;; ; ) also known as the Daśabhūmika Sūtra, is an early, influential Mahayana Buddhist scripture. The sutra also appears as the 26th chapter of the &quot;&quot;. Modern Buddhist studies scholars generally hold that these Mahayana sūtras first began to appear between the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE. They continued being composed, compiled and edited until the decline of Buddhism in India.

==Contents==
In the &quot;Daśabhūmika Sūtra&quot;, the Buddha describes ten stages of development that a bodhisattva must progress through in order to accomplish full Enlightenment and Buddhahood, as well as the subject of Buddha-nature and the awakening of the aspiration for Enlightenment.

==Commentary==
There is a commentary which survives in Chinese called the &quot;Daśabhūmikavibhāṣā&quot;, it is attributed to Nagarjuna.

Another commentary on the &quot;Daśabhūmika Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Dasabhūmikabhāsya&quot;, was written by Vasubandhu in Sanskrit and translated into Chinese by Bodhiruci and others during the 6th century CE.

==Chinese Daśabhūmikā school==
A Daśabhūmikā school said to have existed in China at one time, which centered on this sutra, but was later absorbed by the Huayan school, as the Huayan school&#x27;s principal sutra, the &quot;&quot;, already contains the &quot;Daśabhūmika Sūtra&quot;. The &quot;Daśabhūmika Sūtra&quot; can also be found in modified form in the thirty-ninth chapter as part of the journey of the bodhisattva Sudhana. The Huayan school declined in China after the death of its fifth and best known patriarch, Zongmi (780–841), but they provided major foundational teachings for the Mahayana schools which exist today, such as Zen.

<text>John Malalas (; ;  – 578) was a Byzantine chronicler from Antioch.

==Life==
Of Syrian descent, Malalas was a native speaker of Syriac who learned how to write in Greek later in his life. The name &quot;Malalas&quot; probably derived from the Syriac word ܡܰܠܳܠܰܐ &quot;malolo&quot; &#x27;rhetor, orator&#x27;; it is first applied to him by John of Damascus. The alternative form &quot;Malelas&quot; is later, first appearing in Constantine VII.

Malalas was educated in Antioch, and probably was a jurist there, but moved to Constantinople at some point in Justinian I&#x27;s reign (perhaps after the Persian sack of Antioch in 540); all we know of his travels from his own hand are visits to Thessalonica and Paneas.

==Writing==

He wrote a &quot;Chronographia&quot; () in 18 books, the beginning and the end of which are lost. In its present state it begins with the mythical history of Egypt and ends with the expedition to Roman Africa under the tribune Marcianus, Justinian&#x27;s nephew, in 563 (his editor Thurn believing it originally to end with Justinian&#x27;s death); it is focused largely on Antioch and (in the later books) Constantinople. Except for the history of Justinian and his immediate predecessors, it possesses little historical value; the author, &quot;relying on Eusebius of Caesarea and other compilers, confidently strung together myths, biblical stories, and real history.&quot; The eighteenth book, dealing with Justinian&#x27;s reign, is well acquainted with, and colored by, official propaganda. The writer is a supporter of Church and State, an upholder of monarchical principles. However, the theory identifying him with the patriarch John Scholasticus is almost certainly incorrect.

Malalas cites many sources, including the lost or fragmentary works of Brunichius, Charax of Pergamum, Domninus, Eustathius of Epiphania, Eutropius, Eutychianus, Nestorianus, Philostratus, Priscus, Sisyphus of Kos and Timotheus.

The work is important as the first surviving example of a chronicle written not for the learned but for the instruction of the monks and the common people, and its language shows a compromise with the spoken language of the day, although &quot;it is still very much a written style. In particular, he employs technical terminology and bureaucratic clichés incessantly, and, in a period of transition from Latin to Greek governmental terminology, still uses the Latin loanwords alongside their Greek replacements ... The overall impression created by Malálas&#x27; style is one of simplicity, reflecting a desire for the straightforward communication of information in the written language of everyday business as it had evolved under the influence of spoken Greek.&quot;

It obtained great popularity, and was used by various writers until the ninth century; it was translated into Old Bulgarian probably in the tenth century, and parts of it were used for the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;. It is preserved in an abridged form in a single manuscript now at Oxford (Baroccianus 182) as well as in various fragments. A medieval translation in Georgian also exists.

<text>Only Unity Saves the Serbs (, commonly abbreviated as СССС) is a popular motto and slogan in Serbia and among Serbs, often used as a rallying call during times of national crisis and against foreign domination. The phrase is an interpretation of what is taken to be four Cyrillic letters for &quot;S&quot; (written С) on the Serbian cross. Popular mythology attributes the motto to Saint Sava, the founder and first Archbishop of the Serbian Orthodox Church, however, the true author is Jovan Dragašević, a Serbian military officer and writer.

The motto represents the &quot;idea of betrayal&quot;, one of the main themes in the Kosovo Myth – the antithesis of Miloš Obilić&#x27;s heroism embodied in the figure of Vuk Branković, who legend holds fled the battlefield, the moral of the story being that discord and betrayal among the Serbs had doomed the nation to fall into the hands of the Ottomans.

==History==
According to legend, the origin of the С-shaped Serbian cross lies with Saint Sava, the first Archbishop of the autocephalous Serbian Church and the patron saint of Serbs, who based his design on the Byzantine original. The association of the motto with Saint Sava originates with the 1882 poem &quot;The Death of Saint Sava&quot; () by Milorad Šimić. Saint Sava is said to have uttered it to urge the Serbs to declare national autonomy and resist domination by the Roman Catholic Church.

The popular interpretation of the four С&#x27;s as &quot; on the Serbian coat of arms dates to the 19th century, created due to nationalistic and political reasons. Jovan Sterija Popović in his 1847 dramatic historical allegory &quot;The Dream of Prince Marko&quot; () was the first to state that the firesteels were to be read as four С&#x27;s, which &quot;pious patriotic souls have already took for sure&quot; as said by Đorđe Petrović in the 1881 edition of . Author Biljana Vankovska argues that the first interpretation of the acronym СССС was &quot;Serbia Alone Saved Herself&quot; (), which then changed to &quot;Only Unity Saves the Serbs&quot; (), reflecting the growing national fear of internal enemies. In the 1860 poem &quot;Echoes of gusles&quot; (), Jovan Dragašević wrote &quot;Only concord saves the Serb, so it is written for the Serb on the coat of arms&quot; (). Serbian poet and Orthodox priest Jovan Sundečić in the 1868 edition of used &quot;Only Unity saves Slavdom&quot; (). In the 1869 &quot;Poems and traditions&quot; (), a collection of poetry and traditions collected by Miloš S. Milojević, several interpretations are written. In the introduction of Vladan Đorđević&#x27;s 1919 &quot;Emperor Stefan Dušan: Young ruler&quot; (), he writes &quot;Because only unity saves, not only the Serb, but the Croat and Slovene, Orthodox, Catholics and Muslims&quot;.

The phrase is found in written on towels and engraved on &quot;gusle&quot; dating to the 1880s and 1890s. Allegedly, the motto was acronymed on the Montenegrin cap. 

The phrase was used in songs of the Serbian Sokol movement. 

During World War II, the Main Staff of Chetnik Detachments in Croatian-occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina used it as an appeal in their struggle.

==Contemporary use==

The СССС acronym began appearing in Serbian nationalist graffiti during the 1980s. In 1989, Serbian President Slobodan Milošević delivered his infamous Gazimestan speech before a large, stone Serbian cross bearing the СССС acronym. In the early 1990s, as Yugoslavia began to disintegrate, Milošević&#x27;s propaganda apparatus adopted the phrase. The СССС acronym form of the phrase was featured with the Serbian cross on the insignia of the Serbian Army of Krajina during the Croatian War and on the insignia of the Army of Republika Srpska during the Bosnian War. The Serbian cross with the СССС acronym was also used as a wing and fuselage marking on aircraft used by the Republika Srpska Air Force. The phrase was often scrawled on the walls of abandoned houses in towns captured by Serb forces, usually followed alongside the acronym JNA (for Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army) and the names of individual soldiers. In the immediate aftermath of the Yugoslav Wars, license plates throughout Republika Srpska featured the acronym. These were replaced several years later, following the introduction of nationwide license plates.

Serbian singer-songwriter Bora Đorđević adapted the motto as the title to his song &quot;Samo sloga Srbina spasava&quot;, written during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.

In 2010, on the anniversary of the Battle of Loznica, Patriarch Irinej said that &quot;only unity could save the Serb people, and could ruin it&quot;.

In 2013, Slovene politician and EP member Jelko Kacin congratulated that Kosovo Serb representatives had united despite political differences, in a delegation to the EP, with the words &quot;Bravo, Serbs, only unity saves the Serbs&quot;.

An international conference of Serbian Orthodox youth with the name &quot;Only unity saves Serbs&quot; has been held in 2015 and 2016 in Republika Srpska.

It is traditionally written in acronym form on a česnica, a type of Serbian Christmas bread, as well as in Easter egg decorating.

<doc id="586082" wikidata="Q368418" url="?curid=586082" title="The Heart of Saturday Night">
<text>The Heart of Saturday Night is the second studio album by singer and songwriter Tom Waits, released on October 15, 1974, on Asylum Records. The title song was written as a tribute to Jack Kerouac. The album marks the start of a decade-long collaboration between Waits and Bones Howe, who produced and engineered all Waits&#x27; recordings until the artist left Asylum.

== Cover ==
The album cover is based on &quot;In the Wee Small Hours&quot; by Frank Sinatra. It is an illustration featuring a tired Tom Waits being observed by a blonde woman as he exits a neon-lit cocktail lounge late at night. Cal Schenkel was the art director and the cover art was created by Lynn Lascaro.

== Critical reception ==

In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Janet Maslin regarded the songs as tawdry affectations of &quot;a boozy vertigo&quot; marred by Waits&#x27; vague lyrics and ill-advised puns on an album that is &quot;too self-consciously limited&quot; in mood. &quot;It demands to be listened to after hours&quot;, Maslin wrote, &quot;when that cloud of self-pitying gloom has descended and the vino is close at hand&quot;. Fellow &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was also critical of Waits&#x27; compositions, writing that &quot;there might be as many coverable songs here as there were on his first album if mournful melodies didn&#x27;t merge into neo imagery in the spindrift dirge of the honky-tonk beatnik night. Dig?&quot;

In a retrospective review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Buddy Seigal was more impressed by Waits&#x27; &quot;touchingly, unashamedly sentimental&quot; songs, calling &quot;The Heart of Saturday Night&quot; perhaps the singer&#x27;s most &quot;mature, ingenuous and fully realized&quot; album. It was ranked number 339 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

<text>The Audi RSQ concept vehicle series include:

==Audi RSQ (2004)==
The Audi RSQ is a mid-engined concept car developed by Audi AG for use as a product placement in the 2004 sci-fi film &quot;I, Robot&quot;. It is meant to depict a technologically advanced automobile in the Chicago cityscape from the year 2035.

This sports coupé is a visionary interpretation of Audi&#x27;s typical automobile design. An important challenge presented to the designers was that in order for the car to have successful advertising for Audi as product placement, despite its extreme character, the car still had to be recognised by those audience members familiar with car designs as an Audi. To accommodate this demand, the engineers implemented a current Audi front-end design which includes the trapezoidal &quot;Audi single-frame grille,&quot; the company&#x27;s trademark four overlapping rings, and the Multi Media Interface (MMI) driver-to-car control system. The RSQ also includes special features suggested by film director Alex Proyas. The car uses spheres instead of conventional wheels. Its two reverse butterfly doors are hinged to the C-pillars of the body.

Although this kind of collaboration was a first for Audi, a similar project named the Lexus 2054 was developed by Lexus for use in the 2002 film &quot;Minority Report&quot;.

==Audi RSQ e-tron (2019)==
The Audi RSQ e-tron is a concept car developed by Audi for use in the 2019 animated film &quot;Spies in Disguise&quot;.

According to Audi, the car was designed closely with Blue Sky Studios and features a &quot;visionary design language and futuristic highlights including a hologram speedometer&quot;.

===Marketing===
As part of the Audi RSQ e-tron and Spies in Disguise movie launch, a video named &#x27;Lunchbreak&#x27; was produced.

<text>The &quot;Gearing&quot; class was a series of 98 destroyers built for the U.S. Navy during and shortly after World War II. The &quot;Gearing&quot; design was a minor modification of the , whereby the hull was lengthened by at amidships, which resulted in more fuel storage space and increased the operating range.

The first &quot;Gearings&quot; were not ready for service until mid-1945 and saw little service in World War II. They continued serving, with a series of upgrades, until the 1970s. At that time many were sold to other nations, where they served many more years.

* Nine more unnamed vessels (DD-896 to DD-904) awarded to Bath Iron Works, and another eight (DD-909 to DD-916) awarded to Bethlehem at Staten Island, were all cancelled on 28 March 1945.

==Design==
The first ship was laid down in August 1944, while the last was launched in March 1946. In that time the United States produced 98 &quot;Gearing&quot;-class destroyers. The &quot;Gearing&quot; class was a seemingly minor improvement of the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot; class, built from 1943 until 1945. The main differences were that the &quot;Gearing&quot;s were longer in the midship section, allowing for increased fuel tankage for greater range, an important consideration in Pacific War. More importantly in the long run, the increased size of the &quot;Gearing&quot;s made them much more suitable for upgrades than the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;s, as seen in the wartime radar picket subclass, the 1950s radar picket destroyer (DDR) and escort destroyer (DDE) conversions, and the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) conversions 1960-1965. As designed, the &quot;Gearing&quot; class&#x27;s armament was identical to that on the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot; class. Three twin /38 caliber Mark 38 dual purpose (DP) mounts constituted the main battery. The 5-inch guns were guided by a Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System with a Mark 25 fire control radar linked by a Mark 1A Fire Control Computer stabilized by a Mark 6 8,500 rpm gyro. This fire control system provided effective long-range anti-aircraft (AA) or anti-surface fire. Twelve Bofors guns in two quad and two twin mounts and 11 Oerlikon cannons in single mounts were also equipped. The initial design retained the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot; class&#x27;s heavy torpedo armament of ten torpedo tubes in two quintuple mounts, firing the Mark 15 torpedo. As the threat from &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft mounted in 1945, and with few remaining Japanese warships to use torpedoes on, most of the class had the aft quintuple 21-inch tube mounts replaced by an additional 40 mm quadruple mount (prior to completion on later ships) for 16 total 40 mm guns. Twenty-four ships (DD-742, DD743, 805-808, 829, 831-835, and 874-883) were ordered without torpedo tubes to allow for radar picket equipment; these were redesignated as DDRs in 1948.

===1946–1959 upgrades===
Following World War II most of the class had their AA and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) armament upgraded. The 40 mm and 20 mm guns were replaced by two to six /50 caliber guns in up to two twin and two single mountings. One depth charge rack was removed and two Hedgehog ASW mortar mounts added. The K-guns were retained. Nine additional (for a total of 35) ships were converted to radar picket destroyers (DDR) in the early 1950s; these typically received only one 3-inch twin mount to save weight for radar equipment, as did the wartime radar pickets. Nine ships were converted to escort destroyers (DDE), emphasizing ASW. was the most thorough DDE conversion, with 4 3-inch/70 caliber guns in twin enclosed mounts, two Weapon Alpha launchers, four new 21-inch torpedo tubes for the Mark 37 ASW torpedo, and one depth charge rack.

== FRAM I upgrade ==

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, 79 of the &quot;Gearing&quot;-class destroyers underwent extensive modernization overhauls, known as FRAM I, which were designed under project SCB 206 to convert them from an anti-aircraft destroyer to an anti-submarine warfare platform. FRAM I removed all of the DDR and DDE equipment, and these ships were redesignated as DDs. FRAM I and FRAM II conversions were completed 1960–1965. Eventually all but three &quot;Gearing&quot;s received FRAM conversions.

The FRAM I program was an extensive conversion for the &quot;Gearing&quot;-class destroyers. This upgrade included rebuilding the ship&#x27;s superstructure, electronic systems, radar, sonar, and weapons. The second twin 5-inch gun mount and all previous AA guns and ASW equipment were removed. On several ships the two forward 5-inch mounts remained and the aft 5-inch mount was removed. Upgraded systems included SQS-23 sonar, SPS-10 surface search radar, two triple Mark 32 torpedo tubes, an 8-cell Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC) box launcher, and one QH-50C DASH ASW drone helicopter, with its own landing pad and hangar. Both the Mk 32 torpedo tubes and ASROC launched Mk. 44 homing ASW torpedoes. ASROC could also launch a nuclear depth charge. On 11 May 1962, tested a live nuclear ASROC in the &quot;Swordfish&quot; test.

In Navy slang, the modified destroyers were called &quot;FRAM cans&quot;, &quot;can&quot; being a contraction of &quot;tin can&quot;, the slang term for a destroyer or destroyer escort.

The Gyrodyne QH-50C DASH was an unmanned anti-submarine helicopter, controlled remotely from the ship. The drone could carry two Mark 44 homing ASW torpedoes. During this era the ASROC system had an effective range of only , but the DASH drone allowed the ship to deploy ASW attack to sonar contacts as far as away. However, DASH proved unreliable in shipboard service, with over half of the USN&#x27;s 746 drones lost at sea. This was possibly due to inadequate maintenance support, as other services had few difficulties with DASH. By 1970, DASH had been withdrawn from FRAM I ships, though it was retained into the early 1970s on FRAM II ships, which lacked ASROC. A limitation of drones in ASW was the need to re-acquire the target at ranges beyond the effectiveness of the controlling ship&#x27;s sonar. This led to shift to the LAMPS program of manned helicopters, which the &quot;Gearing&quot; class were too small to accommodate.

An upgraded version of DASH, QH-50D, remained in use by the United States Army until May 2006.

FRAM I &quot;A&quot; Ships: (First 8 conversions) Removal of aft twin 5-inch gun mount (Mount 53). Group A ships also received two MK10/11 Hedgehogs fitted on each side of the bridge at the 01 level and had the MK-32 triple torpedo launchers aft of the second stack. FRAM I &quot;B&quot; Ships (remainder of conversions): Kept their forward 5-inch mount (Mount 51), lost the second mount (Mount 52) and kept their aft 5-inch mount (Mount 53). In place of mount 52, a practice 5-inch reloading machine was installed with the MK-32 triple torpedo launchers aft of the loader. Group B ships also received greater ASROC and torpedo storage areas next to the port side of the DASH hangar.

== FRAM II upgrade ==

The FRAM II program was designed primarily for the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot; class destroyer, but sixteen &quot;Gearing&quot;s were upgraded as well. This upgrade program included life-extension refurbishment, a new radar system, Mark 32 torpedo tubes, DASH ASW drone, and variable depth sonar (VDS). Importantly, it did not include ASROC. FRAM II ships included six DDRs and six DDEs that retained their specialized equipment (1960–1961), as well as four DDRs that were converted to DDs and were nearly identical to the &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot; class FRAM IIs (1962–1963). The FRAM II ships retained all six 5-inch guns, except the DDEs retained four 5-inch guns and a trainable Hedgehog in the No. 2 position. All FRAM IIs retained two Hedgehogs alongside either the No. 2 5-inch mount or the trainable Hedgehog mount. The four DDRs converted to DDs were armed with two new 21-inch torpedo tubes for the Mk. 37 ASW homing torpedo. Photographs of the six retained DDRs show no markings on the DASH landing deck, as well as a much smaller deckhouse than was usually provided for DASH, so they may not have been equipped with DASH.

== Service and disposition ==
Many of the &quot;Gearing&quot;s provided significant gunfire support in the Vietnam War. They also served as escorts for Carrier Battle Groups (carrier strike groups from 2004) and Amphibious Ready Groups (Expeditionary Strike Groups from 2006). DASH was withdrawn from ASW service in 1969, due to poor reliability. Lacking ASROC, the FRAM II ships were disposed of in 1969–1974. With ASROC continuing to provide a standoff ASW capability, the &quot;Gearing&quot; FRAM Is were retained in service for several years, with most being decommissioned and transferred to foreign navies 1973–1980. They were replaced as ASW ships by the s, which were commissioned 1975–1983. These had the same ASW armament as a &quot;Gearing&quot; FRAM destroyer, with the addition of improved sonar and a piloted helicopter, initially the Kaman SH-2 Seasprite, and from 1984, the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk. Some &quot;Gearing&quot;s served in the Naval Reserve Force (NRF) from 1973, remaining in commission with a partial active crew to provide training for Naval reservists. The last &quot;Gearing&quot;-class destroyer in US naval service was , a FRAM I, decommissioned and struck 1 October 1983, and expended as a target 14 July 1999.

== Yang class ==

After the &quot;Gearing&quot;-class ships were retired from USN service, many were sold abroad, including over a dozen to the Republic of China Navy (ROCN) in Taiwan. These ships, along with &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers and &quot;Allen M. Sumner&quot;-class destroyers also acquired then, were upgraded under the Wu Chin () I, II, and III programs and known throughout the ROCN as the Yang-class () destroyers as they were assigned names that all end with the word &quot;Yang&quot;. The last batch of 7 WC-III program vessels, all of them &quot;Gearing&quot; class, were retired in the early 2000s.

Under the most advanced Wu Chin III upgrade program, all World War II vintage weapons were removed and replaced with four Hsiung Feng II surface-to-surface missiles, ten SM-1 (box launchers), one 8-cell ASROC, one Otobreda gun, two Bofors 40 mm AA, one 20 mm Phalanx CIWS and two triple torpedo tubes. The DASH ASW drones were not acquired, but hangar facilities aboard those ships that had them were later used to accommodate of MD 500/ASW helicopters.

After the Yang-class destroyers were decommissioned, the SM-1 launch boxes were moved to &quot;Chi Yang&quot;-class frigates to improve their anti-air capability.

<text>Cannabinoid receptors, located throughout the body, are part of the endocannabinoid system of vertebrates a class of cell membrane receptors in the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. As is typical of G protein-coupled receptors, the cannabinoid receptors contain seven transmembrane spanning domains. Cannabinoid receptors are activated by three major groups of ligands: 

* Endocannabinoids; 
* Phytocannabinoids (plant-derived such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) produced by cannabis); 
* Synthetic cannabinoids (such as HU-210). 

All endocannabinoids and phytocannabinoids are lipophilic.

There are two known subtypes of cannabinoid receptors, termed CB1 and CB2. The CB1 receptor is expressed mainly in the brain (central nervous system or &quot;CNS&quot;), but also in the lungs, liver and kidneys. The CB2 receptor is expressed mainly in the immune system, in hematopoietic cells, and in parts of the brain.

The protein sequences of CB1 and CB2 receptors are about 44% similar. When only the transmembrane regions of the receptors are considered, amino acid similarity between the two receptor subtypes is approximately 68%. In addition, minor variations in each receptor have been identified. Cannabinoids bind reversibly and stereo-selectively to the cannabinoid receptors. Subtype selective cannabinoids have been developed which theoretically may have advantages for treatment of certain diseases such as obesity.

Enzymes involved in biosynthesis/inactivation of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid signaling in general (involving targets other than CB1/2-type receptors) occur throughout the animal kingdom.

== Discovery ==

The existence of cannabinoid receptors in the brain was discovered from in vitro studies in the 1980s, with the receptor designated as the cannabinoid receptor type 1 or CB1. The DNA sequence that encodes a G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor in the human brain was identified and cloned in 1990. These discoveries led to determination in 1993 of a second brain cannabinoid receptor named cannabinoid receptor type 2 or CB2.

A neurotransmitter for a possible endocannabinoid system in the brain and peripheral nervous system, anandamide (from &#x27;ananda&#x27;, Sanskrit for &#x27;bliss&#x27;), was first characterized in 1992, followed by discovery of other fatty acid neurotransmitters that behave as endogenous cannabinoids having a low-to-high range of efficacy for stimulating CB1 receptors in the brain and CB2 receptors in the periphery.

== Types ==

=== CB1 ===
Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) receptors are thought to be one of the most widely expressed Gαi protein-coupled receptors in the brain. One mechanism through which they function is endocannabinoid-mediated depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, a very common form of retrograde signaling, in which the depolarization of a single neuron induces a reduction in GABA-mediated neurotransmission. Endocannabinoids released from the depolarized post-synaptic neuron bind to CB1 receptors in the pre-synaptic neuron and cause a reduction in GABA release due to limited presynaptic calcium ions entry.

They are also found in other parts of the body. For instance, in the liver, activation of the CB1 receptor is known to increase de novo lipogenesis.

=== CB2 ===
CB2 receptors are expressed on T cells of the immune system, on macrophages and B cells, in hematopoietic cells, and in the brain and CNS (2019). They also have a function in keratinocytes. They are also expressed on peripheral nerve terminals. These receptors play a role in antinociception, or the relief of pain. In the brain, they are mainly expressed by microglial cells, where their role remains unclear. While the most likely cellular targets and executors of the CB2 receptor-mediated effects of endocannabinoids or synthetic agonists are the immune and immune-derived cells (e.g. leukocytes, various populations of T and B lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, microglia in the brain, Kupffer cells in the liver, astrocytes, etc.), the number of other potential cellular targets is expanding, now including endothelial and smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts of various origins, cardiomyocytes, and certain neuronal elements of the peripheral or central nervous systems (2011).

=== Other ===
The existence of additional cannabinoid receptors has long been suspected, due to the actions of compounds such as abnormal cannabidiol that produce cannabinoid-like effects on blood pressure and inflammation, yet do not activate either CB1 or CB2. Recent research strongly supports the hypothesis that the &quot;N&quot;-arachidonoyl glycine (NAGly) receptor GPR18 is the molecular identity of the abnormal cannabidiol receptor and additionally suggests that NAGly, the endogenous lipid metabolite of anandamide (also known as arachidonoylethanolamide or AEA), initiates directed microglial migration in the CNS through activation of GPR18. Other molecular biology studies have suggested that the orphan receptor GPR55 should in fact be characterised as a cannabinoid receptor, on the basis of sequence homology at the binding site. Subsequent studies showed that GPR55 does indeed respond to cannabinoid ligands. This profile as a distinct non-CB1/CB2 receptor that responds to a variety of both endogenous and exogenous cannabinoid ligands, has led some groups to suggest GPR55 should be categorized as the CB3 receptor, and this re-classification may follow in time. However this is complicated by the fact that another possible cannabinoid receptor has been discovered in the hippocampus, although its gene has not yet been cloned, suggesting that there may be at least two more cannabinoid receptors to be discovered, in addition to the two that are already known. GPR119 has been suggested as a fifth possible cannabinoid receptor, while the PPAR family of nuclear hormone receptors can also respond to certain types of cannabinoid.

== Signaling ==
Cannabinoid receptors are activated by cannabinoids, generated naturally inside the body (endocannabinoids) or introduced into the body as cannabis or a related synthetic compound. Similar responses are produced when introduced in alternative methods, only in a more concentrated form than what is naturally occurring.

After the receptor is engaged, multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways are activated. At first, it was thought that cannabinoid receptors mainly inhibited the enzyme adenylate cyclase (and thereby the production of the second messenger molecule cyclic AMP), and positively influenced inwardly rectifying potassium channels (=Kir or IRK). However, a much more complex picture has appeared in different cell types, implicating other potassium ion channels, calcium channels, protein kinase A and C, Raf-1, ERK, JNK, p38, c-fos, c-jun and many more. For example, in human primary leukocytes CB2 displays a complex signalling profile, activating adenylate cyclase via stimulatory Gαs alongside the classical Gαi signalling, and induces ERK, p38 and pCREB pathways.

Separation between the therapeutically undesirable psychotropic effects, and the clinically desirable ones, however, has not been reported with agonists that bind to cannabinoid receptors. THC, as well as the two major endogenous compounds identified so far that bind to the cannabinoid receptors —anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG)— produce most of their effects by binding to both the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. While the effects mediated by CB1, mostly in the central nervous system, have been thoroughly investigated, those mediated by CB2 are not equally well defined.

Prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) has been shown to perturb the fetal endogenous cannabinoid signaling system. This perturbation has not been shown to directly affect neurodevelopment nor cause lifelong cognitive, behavioral, or functional abnormalities, but it may predispose offspring to abnormalities in cognition and altered emotionality from post-natal factors. Additionally, PCE may alter the wiring of brain circuitry in foetal development and cause significant molecular modifications to neurodevelopmental programs that may lead to neurophysiological disorders and behavioural abnormalities.

== Cannabinoid treatments ==

Synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is prescribed under the INN &quot;dronabinol&quot; or the brand name &quot;Marinol&quot;, to treat vomiting and for enhancement of appetite, mainly in people with AIDS as well as for refractory nausea and vomiting in people undergoing chemotherapy. Use of synthetic THC is becoming more common as the known benefits become more prominent within the medical industry. THC is also an active ingredient in nabiximols, a specific extract of &quot;Cannabis&quot; that was approved as a botanical drug in the United Kingdom in 2010 as a mouth spray for people with multiple sclerosis to alleviate neuropathic pain, spasticity, overactive bladder, and other symptoms.

<text>The Odawa (also Ottawa or Odaawaa ) are an Indigenous North American people who primarily inhabit land in the Eastern Woodlands region, now in jurisdictions of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. Their territory long preceded the creation of the current border between the two countries in the 18th and 19th centuries. 

Their peoples are federally recognized as Native American tribes in the United States and have numerous recognized First Nations bands in Canada. They are one of the Anishinaabeg, related to but distinct from the Ojibwe and Potawatomi peoples.

After migrating from the East Coast in ancient times, they settled on Manitoulin Island, near the northern shores of Lake Huron, and the Bruce Peninsula in the present-day province of Ontario, Canada. They considered this their original homeland. After the 17th century, they also settled along the Ottawa River, and in what became the present-day states of Michigan and Wisconsin. They also occupied other areas of the Midwest south of the Great Lakes in what became the United States. In the 21st century, there are a total of approximately 15,000 Odawa living in Ontario, Canada, and in Michigan and Oklahoma (former Indian Territory, United States).

The Ottawa dialect is part of the Algonquian language family. This large family is made up of numerous smaller tribal groups or &quot;bands,&quot; which are commonly called a &quot;Tribe&quot; in the United States and &quot;First Nation&quot; in Canada. Their language is considered a divergent dialect of Ojibwe, characterized by frequent syncope.

==Tribe name==
&quot;Odawaa&quot; (syncoped as &quot;Daawaa&quot;, is believed to be derived from the Anishinaabe word &quot;adaawe&quot;, meaning &quot;to trade,&quot; or &quot;to buy and sell&quot;). This term is common to the Cree, Algonquin, Nipissing, Innu, Odawa, and Ojibwe. The Potawatomi spelling of &quot;Odawa&quot; and the English derivative &quot;Ottawa&quot; are also common. The Anishinaabe word for &quot;Those men who trade, or buy and sell&quot; is &quot;Wadaawewinini(wag).&quot; 

Fr. Frederic Baraga, a Catholic missionary in Michigan, transliterated this and recorded it in his &quot;A Dictionary of the Otchipwe Language&quot; as &quot;Watawawininiwok,&quot; noting that it meant &quot;men of the bulrushes&quot;, associated with the many bulrushes in the Ottawa River. But, this recorded meaning is more appropriately associated with the &quot;Matàwackariniwak,&quot; a historical Algonquin band who lived along the Ottawa River. 

The only tribe in the United States that is Odawa are the Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians; the rest are considered Ottawa.

Their neighbors applied the &quot;Trader&quot; name to the Odawa because in early traditional times, and also during the early European contact period, they were noted as intertribal traders and barterers. The Odawa were described as having dealt &quot;chiefly in cornmeal, sunflower oil, furs and skins, rugs and mats, tobacco, and medicinal roots and herbs.&quot;

The Odawa name in its English transcription is the source of the place names of the city of Ottawa, Ontario, and the Ottawa River. The Odawa home territory at the time of early European contact, but not their trading zone, was well to the west of the city and river named after them. 

Ottawa, Ohio, is the county seat of Putnam County, developed at the site of the last Ottawa reservation in Ohio. There is also an Ottawa, Kansas.

==Language==

The Odawa dialect is considered one of several divergent dialects of the Ojibwe language group, noted for its frequent syncope. In the Odawa language, the general language group is known as &quot;Nishnabemwin&quot;, while the Odawa language is called &quot;Daawaamwin&quot;. Of the estimated 5,000 ethnic Odawa and additional 10,000 people with some Odawa ancestry, in the early 21st century an estimated 500 people in Ontario and Michigan speak this language. The Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma has three fluent speakers.

==Early history==

===Oral histories and early recorded histories===
According to Anishinaabeg tradition, and from recordings in Wiigwaasabak (birch bark scrolls), the Odawa people came from the eastern areas of North America, or Turtle Island, and from a region called Dawnland along the East Coast (where there are numerous Algonquian-language peoples). 

Directed by the &quot;miigis&quot; (luminescent) beings, the Anishinaabe peoples moved inland along the Saint Lawrence River. At the &quot;Third Stopping Place&quot; near what is now Detroit, Michigan, the southern group of Anishinaabeg divided into three groups, the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi.

There is archaeological evidence that the Saugeen complex people, a Hopewell-influenced group who were located on the Bruce Peninsula during the Middle Woodland period, may have evolved into the Odawa people. The Hopewell tradition was a widely extended trading network operating from about 200BCE to 500 CE. Some of these peoples constructed earthwork mounds for burials, a practice that ended about 250 CE. The Saugeen mounds have not been excavated.

The Odawa, together with the Ojibwe and Potawatomi, were part of a long-term tribal alliance called the Council of Three Fires. Together they fought the nations of the Iroquois Confederacy (who came from the East) and the Dakota people. 

In 1615 French explorer Samuel de Champlain met 300 men of a nation which, he said, &quot;we call &quot;les cheueux releuez&quot;&quot; (modern French: &quot;cheveux relevés&quot; (hair lifted, raised, rolled up)), near the mouth of the French River. Of these, he said: &quot;Their arms consisted only of a bow and arrows, a buckler of boiled leather and the club. They wore no breech clouts, their bodies were tattooed in many fashions and designs, their faces painted and their noses pierced.&quot; In 1616, Champlain left the Huron villages and visited the &quot;Cheueux releuez,&quot; who lived westward from the lands of the Huron Confederacy.

The &quot;Jesuit Relations&quot; of 1667 reported that three tribes lived in the same town: the Odawa, the Kiskakon Odawa, and the Sinago Odawa. All three tribes spoke the same language.

===Fur trade===
Due to the extensive trade network maintained by the Odawa, many of the North American interior nations became known to Europeans by the names the Odawa used for them, rather than by the nations’ own names (endonyms). For example, these exonyms include &quot;Winnebago&quot; (from &quot;Wiinibiigoo&quot;) for the Ho-Chunk, and Sioux (from &quot;Naadawensiw&quot;) for the Dakota. From the early days of the colony of New France, the Odawa became so important to the French and Canadians in fur trade that before 1670, colonists in Quebec (then called Canada) usually referred to any Algonquian speaker from the Great Lakes region as an Odawa. In their own language, the Odawa (like the Ojibwe) identified as Anishinaabe (&quot;Neshnabek&quot;) meaning &quot;people.&quot;

The mostly highly prized fur was beaver, popular in Europe. Other furs traded included deer, marten, raccoon, fox, otter, and muskrat. In exchange the Odawa received &quot;hatchets, knives, kettles, traps, needles, fish hooks, cloth and blankets, jewelry and decorative items, and later firearms and alcohol.&quot; Up to the time of Nicolas Perrot, the Odawa had a monopoly on all fur trade that came through Green Bay, Wisconsin, or Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. They allegedly did &quot;their best to exploit&quot; the tribes in those areas &quot;who did not use the canoe, by bartering with them bits of iron and steel and worn-out European articles for extravagant quantities of furs.&quot; For example, &quot;the Crees gave the Ottawas &#x27;all their beaver robes for old knives, blunted awls, wretched nets and kettles used until they were past service.&#x27;&quot;

===Wars and refugees===

The Odawa had disputes and warfare with other tribes, particularly over the lucrative fur trade. For example, the tribe once waged war against the Mascouten. In the mid-17th century the Odawa allied with other Algonquian tribes around the Great Lakes against the powerful Mohawk people (of present-day New York) and their Iroquois allies in the Beaver Wars. The European introduction of guns and other weapons to some of their trading partners had disrupted the traditional balance of power in the region and changed economic risks and rewards. All indigenous peoples on both sides were disrupted or decimated; some groups, such as the Iroquoian-speaking Erie, were exterminated as tribes. But by the mid-17th century, the tribes were more severely affected by new infectious diseases than warfare. Lacking acquired immunity to these European diseases, they suffered epidemics with high fatalities.

In 1701 the French colonists built Fort Detroit and established a trading post. Many Odawa moved there from their traditional homeland of Manitoulin Island near the Bruce Peninsula, and Wyandot (Huron) also moved near the post. Some Odawa had already settled across northern Michigan in the Lower Peninsula, and more bands established villages around and south of Detroit. Their area extended into present-day Ohio.

With movements of the tribes in relation to warfare and colonial encroachment, the tribes settled in roughly the following pattern: 
&quot;Sandwiched between the French, in the north and west, and the English, in the south and east, the Miami settled in present-day Indiana and western Ohio; the Ottawa settled in Northwest Ohio along the Maumee, the Auglaize, and the Blanchard rivers; the Wyandot settled in Central Ohio; the Shawnee in Southwest Ohio; and the Delaware (Lenape) in Southeast and Eastern Ohio.&quot;

In the mid-18th century, the Odawa allied with their French trading partners against the British in the Seven Years&#x27; War, known as the French and Indian War in the North American colonies. They made raids against Anglo-American colonists. The Odawa chief Pontiac has historically been reported to have been born at the confluence of the Maumee and Auglaize rivers, where modern Defiance, Ohio, later developed. In 1763, after the British had defeated France, Pontiac led a rebellion against the British, but he was unable to prevent British colonial settlement of the region.

A decade later, Chief Egushawa (also spelled Agushawa), who had a village at the mouth of the Maumee River on Lake Erie (where Toledo later developed) led the Odawa as an ally of the British in the American Revolutionary War. He hoped to build on their support to exclude European-American colonists from his territory in northwest Ohio and southern Michigan. The defeat of the British by the United States had a far-ranging influence on British-allied Native American tribes, as many were forced to cede their land to the United States.

Following the Revolutionary War, in the 1790s, Egushawa, together with numerous members of other regional tribes, including the Wyandot and Council of Three Fires, Shawnee, Lenape, and Mingo, fought the United States in a series of battles and campaigns in what became known as the Northwest Indian War. The Indians hoped to repulse the European-American pioneers coming to settle west of the Appalachian Mountains, but were finally defeated. 

In 1792 President George Washington sent Major Alexander Truman, his servant William Lynch, and guide/interpreter William Smalley on a peace mission to the tribes. Truman and Lynch were killed; Truman was apparently killed prior to April 20, 1792 at Lower Tawa Town, an Ottawa village (Ottawa, Putnam County Ohio). In a campaign during 1794, Anthony Wayne built a string of forts in the upper Maumee River watershed, including Fort Defiance, across the river from the site of Pontiac&#x27;s birth. While the British had encouraged the Native American efforts, they did not want to get drawn into open conflict again with the United States and withdrew from offering direct support to the tribes. Wayne&#x27;s army defeated several hundred members of the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, near the future site of Maumee, Ohio and about 11 miles upriver of present-day Toledo.

====Raid on Pickawillany====

In the winter of 1751–1752, Charles Langlade began assembling an allied war party of Odawa, Potawatomi, and Ojibwe warriors who traveled to Pickawillany. They attacked the village in mid-morning on June 21, 1752, and killed thirteen Miami men and captured five English traders. Down to as few as twenty warriors the Miami tried to negotiate terms of surrender, and Langlade promised to allow the Miami men to return home if they handed over the English. The Miami sent only three of the five Englishmen. When the Englishmen reached Langlade&#x27;s lines, one of his men stabbed one of them to death, scalped the Englishman, and ripped his heart out and ate it in front of the Miami men. Langlade&#x27;s men seized the Miami chief Memeskia. He was killed, boiled and eaten in front of his warriors. Afterward the Odawa released the Miami women and left for Detroit with four captured Englishmen and more than $300,000 worth (in today&#x27;s dollars) of trade goods. 

This French-led victory over the English is believed to have led to the French and Indian War and contributed to the Seven Years&#x27; War on the European continent.

===Treaties and removals===
In 1795, under the Treaty of Greenville, the Odawa and other members of the Western Confederacy ceded all of Ohio to the United States, except the northwest area. This was part of the area controlled by the Detroit Odawa.

In 1807, the Detroit Odawa joined three other tribes, the Ojibwe, Potawatomi and Wyandot people, in signing the Treaty of Detroit under pressure from the United States. The agreement, between the tribes and William Hull, representing the Michigan Territory, gave the United States a large portion of today&#x27;s Southeastern Michigan and a section of northwest Ohio near the Maumee River. 

Many Odawa bands moved away from the European Americans into northern Michigan. The tribes retained communal control of relatively small pockets of land in the territory of the Maumee River. Bands of Odawa-occupied areas known as Roche de Boeuf, and Wolf Rapids on the upper Maumee River.

In 1817, in the first treaty involving land cessions after the War of 1812, the Ohio Odawa ceded their lands, accepting reservations at Blanchard&#x27;s Creek and the Little Auglaize River in Ohio (34 square miles total). These were only reserves, for which they were paid annuities for ten years. Pressure continued to build against the Odawa as European-American settlers moved into the area.

After passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the US government arranged for the Odawa to cede their reserves in 1831. The four following bands eventually all removed to areas of Kansas, then part of Indian Territory: the Blanchard&#x27;s Creek, Little Auglaize, Roche de Boeuf, and Wolf Rapids bands.

==Modern history==
The population of the different Odawa groups has been estimated. In 1906, the Ojibwe and Odawa on Manitoulin and Cockburn Island were 1,497, of whom about half were Odawa. There were 197 Odawa listed as associated with the Seneca School in Oklahoma, where some Odawa had settled after the American Civil War. In 1900 in Michigan there were 5,587 scattered Ojibwe and Odawa, of whom about two-thirds are Odawa.

In the early 21st century, the total number of enrolled members of the federally recognized Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma numbers about 4,700. There are about 10,000 persons who identify as Odawa in the United States, with the majority in Michigan. Another several thousand live in Ontario, Canada.

There has been one major anthropological study of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. Jane Willetts Ettawageshik devoted approximately two years of study in the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians community. Ettawageshik recorded Anishinaabe stories that speak of how the Anishinaabe people related to their land, to their people, and various other means of communicating their values, outlooks and histories in and around Northern Michigan. These stories have been translated into English by Howard Webkamigada and published as the book &quot;Ottawa Stories from the Springs, Anishinaabe dibaadjimowinan wodi gaa binjibaamigak wodi mookodjiwong ezhinikaadek&quot;.

<text>John Edward Wansbrough (February 19, 1928 – June 10, 2002) was an American historian of Islamic origins and Quranic studies and professor who taught at the University of London&#x27;s School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), where he was vice chancellor from 1985 to 1992.

Wansbrough is credited with founding the revisionist school of Islamic studies through his fundamental criticism of the historical credibility of the Quran and other early Islamic texts, especially regarding the classical Islamic narratives concerning the early history of Islam and his attempt to develop an alternative, historically more credible version of Islam&#x27;s beginnings. He argued in general for a methodological skepticism of the authorship of early Islamic sources, and most famously that the Quran was written and collected over a 200-year period, and should be dated not from the 1st-century AH Hijaz of Western Arabia, but from the 2nd/3rd century AH in Abbasid Iraq.

== Life ==

Wansbrough was born in Peoria, Illinois. He completed his studies at Harvard University, and spent the rest of his academic career at SOAS. He died at Montaigu-de-Quercy, France. Among his students were Andrew Rippin, Norman Calder, Gerald R. Hawting, Patricia Crone and Michael Cook.

== Research and thesis ==

Wansbrough work stresses two points—that Muslim literature is late, dating more than a century and a half after the death of Muhammad, and that Islam is a complex phenomenon which must have taken many generations to fully develop.

When Wansbrough began studying early Islamic manuscripts and the Quran, he realized that the early Islamic texts addressed an audience which was familiar with Jewish and Christian texts, and that Jewish and Christian theological problems were discussed. Criticism of &quot;infidels&quot; in this literature he reasoned was addressed not to idolaters and pagans, but to monotheists who did not live monotheism &quot;purely&quot;. 
Those observations did not fit to the Islamic narratives on Islam&#x27;s beginnings, which depicted Islam as coming into being within a polytheistic society. 

Wansbrough also found that early Muslim legal arguments did not refer to the Quran, along with other indication that there was not &quot;a stable scriptural text&quot; in Rashidun and Umayyad eras, suggesting the Quran as a source of law had been backdated.

Wansbrough analyzed the classical Islamic narratives which had been written 150 to 200 years after the Islamic prophet Muhammad died with the historical-critical method, especially literary criticism. Thus, he claimed countless proofs that the texts are not historical accounts but later literary constructions in the sense of the concept of a &quot;salvation history&quot; (&quot;Heilsgeschichte&quot;) of the Old Testament, whose actual historical core is meager and cannot be detected.

On that basis, Wansbrough developed the theory parts of which he qualified as &quot;conjectural &quot;provisional&quot; and &quot;tentative and emphatically provisional&quot;, as it implied (in the words of historian Herbert Berg) that &quot;neither the Quran nor Islam is a product of Muhammad or even Arabia&quot;, nor were the original Arab conquerors of the Umayyad empire actual Muslims. He postulated that Islam did not come into being as a new religion on its own but derived from conflicts of various Jewish-Christian sects and from the need for a (fixed) sacred scripture upon which to base the Abbasid code of law: &quot;The employment of scriptural &quot;Shawahid&quot; in halakhic controversy required a fixed and unambiguous text of revelation ... the result was the Quranic canon.

The Quran was written and collected in a long process over 200 years and thus cannot be attributed to Muhammad, being more recent than traditional accounts date it. The person of Muhammad would be a later invention, or at least, Muhammad cannot be related to the Quran. In later times, Muhammad had only the function to provide an own identity to the new religious movement according to the role model of a Prophet of the Old Testament.

Thus, Wansbrough argued that the Quran &quot;became a source for biography, exegesis, jurisprudence and grammar&quot; around the 2nd/3rd century AH in Abbasid Iraq (not the 1st-century Hijaz, Western Arabia, as traditionally dated and located). Specifically Wansbrough thinks it must have been completed by Ibn Hisham around the time he composed his &quot;Sīra&quot; of Muhammad because of the &quot;preponderance of Quran-based (historicised) narratives therein&quot;. Wansbrough thought evidence for the &quot;seventh-century Hijaz&quot; as the location of the Islam&#x27;s origins was &quot;[b]ereft of archaeological witness and hardly attested in pre-Islamic Arabic or external sources&quot;, but instead owed &quot;its historiographical existence almost entirely to the creative endeavour of Muslim and Orientalist scholarhship&quot;.

Wansbrough argued that variants of Quranic text are so minor that they are not &quot;recollections of ancient texts that differed from the Uthmanic text&quot; but the outcome of exegesis. &quot;Variants&quot; in the form of multiple versions of the same story within the text of the Quran &quot;are present in such quantity&quot; that they rule out the theory of an &quot;Urtext&quot; (original text) or &quot;even that of a composite edition produced by deliberations in committee&quot;.
And also that classical Arabic was developed later than the colloquial forms, &quot;contemporaneously with the codification of the Quran.&quot;

== Reception and critique ==
Wansbrough&#x27;s theories have neither been &quot;widely accepted&quot; nor rejected, according to Gabriel Said Reynolds.
By his fundamental criticism of the historical credibility of the classical Islamic narratives concerning Islam&#x27;s beginnings and his attempt to develop an alternative, historically more credible version of Islam&#x27;s beginnings, Wansbrough founded the so-called &quot;revisionist&quot; school of Islamic Studies. According to historian Andrew Rippin and religious scholar Herbert Berg lack of interest by non-Muslim scholars in Wansbrough&#x27;s ideas can be traced to the fact that Wansbrough strays from the path of least effort and resistance in scholarship by questioning the vast corpus of Islamic literature on the history of Islam, the Quran, and Muhammad; &quot;destroying&quot; what had been historical facts without replacing them with new ones; calling for using the techniques of Biblical criticism, requiring competency in other languages than Arabic, familiarity with &quot;religious frameworks&quot; other than Islam, and locations other &quot;than Arabia on the eve of Islam&quot; and treading on very sacred territory in Islam.

Wansbrough&#x27;s theory about the long process (over 200 years) of writing and collection of the Quran is today considered untenable by many because of the discoveries of Early Quranic manuscripts many of which were tested with radiocarbon analysis (around 2010-2014) and have been dated to the seventh century CE.

<doc id="586109" wikidata="Q2491749" url="?curid=586109" title="Council of Three Fires">
<text>The Council of Three Fires (in , also known as the People of the Three Fires; the Three Fires Confederacy; or the United Nations of Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi Indians) is a long-standing Anishinaabe alliance of the Ojibwe (or Chippewa), Odawa (or Ottawa), and Potawatomi North American Native tribes.

==History==
Originally one people, or a collection of closely related bands, the ethnic identities of Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi developed after the Anishinaabe reached Michilimackinac on their journey westward from the Atlantic coast. Using the Midewiwin scrolls, Potawatomi elder Shup-Shewana dated the formation of the Council of Three Fires to 796 AD at Michilimackinac.

In this council, the Ojibwe were addressed as the &quot;Older Brother,&quot; the Odawa as the &quot;Middle Brother,&quot; and the Potawatomi as the &quot;Younger Brother.&quot; Consequently, whenever the three Anishinaabe nations are mentioned in this specific &quot;and&quot; consecutive order of Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi, it is an indicator implying Council of Three Fires as well. In addition, the Ojibwe are the &quot;keepers of the faith,&quot; the Odawa are the &quot;keepers of trade,&quot; and the Potawatomi are the designated &quot;keepers/maintainers of/for the fire&quot; (&quot;boodawaadam&quot;), which became the basis for their name &quot;Boodewaadamii&quot; (Ojibwe spelling) or &quot;Bodéwadmi&quot; (Potawatomi spelling).

Though the Three Fires had several meeting places, Michilimackinac became the preferred meeting place due to its central location. From this place, the Council met for military and political purposes. From this site, the Council maintained relations with fellow Anishinaabeg nations, the Shawanoe/Shawnoo (Shawnee), the &quot;Ozaagii&quot; (Sac), &quot;Odagaamii&quot; (Meskwaki), &quot;Omanoominii&quot; (Menominee), &quot;Wiinibiigoo&quot; (Ho-Chunk), &quot;Naadawe&quot; (Iroquois Confederacy), &quot;Nii&#x27;inaawi-Naadawe&quot; (Wyandot), and &quot;Naadawensiw&quot; (Sioux). Here, they also maintained relations with the &quot;Wemitigoozhi&quot; (Frenchmen), &quot;Zhaaganaashi&quot; (Englishmen) and the &quot;Gichi-mookomaanag&quot; (the Americans).

Through the totem-system and promotion of trade, the Council generally had a peaceful existence with its neighbours. However, occasional unresolved disputes erupted into wars. Under these conditions, the Council notably fought against the Iroquois Confederacy and the Sioux. During the French and Indian War and Pontiac&#x27;s War, the Council fought against Great Britain; and during the Northwest Indian War and the War of 1812, they fought against the United States. After the formation of the United States of America in 1776, the Council became the core member of the Western Lakes Confederacy (also known as &quot;Great Lakes Confederacy&quot;), joined with the Wyandots, Algonquins, Nipissing, Sacs, Meskwaki and others.

<text>The Molonglo River is a perennial river that is part of the Murrumbidgee catchment within the Murray–Darling basin. It is located in the Monaro and Capital Country regions of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, in Australia.

==Location and features==
The river rises on the western side of the Great Dividing Range, in Tallaganda State Forest at and flows generally from south to north before turning north-west, through Carwoola and the outskirts of Queanbeyan, where it has confluence with its major tributary, the Queanbeyan River, and then continues through Canberra, where it has been dammed by the Scrivener Dam to form Lake Burley Griffin. The river then flows to its confluence with the Murrumbidgee River, near Uriarra Crossing. Over its course, the Molonglo River alternates several times between long broad floodplains and narrow rocky gorges. One of the floodplains is called the Molonglo Plain.

From source to mouth, the river is traversed by the Captains Flat Road at , Briars-Sharrow Road in Carwoola, the Kings Highway between Queanbeyan and , the Yass Road, north of Queanbeyan, the Monaro Highway at , the Commonwealth and Kings Avenues as Lake Burley Griffin between and , Lady Denman Drive at Scrivener Dam, and the Tuggeranong Parkway south of the Glenloch Interchange.

==Etymology==
The river&#x27;s name was recorded as the &quot;Yeal-am-bid-gie&quot; in 1820 by the explorer Charles Throsby. This was probably the collective local Moolinggolah name for the river. (The suffix &quot;bidgee&quot; was common in Aboriginal languages for rivers in the Canberra area and presumably means &quot;water&quot; or &quot;river&quot;.) The Moolinggolah people of the district around Captains Flat probably gave the Molonglo its name. Where the river flowed through what is now Canberra, it was probably known after the Ngambri people, transcribed as &quot;Kembury&quot;, &quot;Canberry&quot;, and other transcription variations. The word &quot;molongolo&quot; is derived from an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;like the sound of thunder&quot;.

==History==

The first name given to the River by Westerners was Limestone River, Subsequently, in the early years of European settlement both the Molonglo and the Queanbeyan were known as the &quot;Fish River&quot; for the abundance of native fish in them. The Molonglo was renowned as a beautiful river with excellent fishing for native Murray cod, Macquarie perch and silver perch. This abundance of native fish did not last. Upon commencement of mining operations at Captains Flat (and contrary to NSW Government assurances), mine tailings continually severely polluted the river, including several mass tailings collapses into the river between the 1930s and 1950s, eradicating all native fish and most other aquatic life downstream from the site. Despite government funded rehabilitation programs in 1976, some toxic leachates still enter the river from the Captain&#x27;s Flat mine site.

Consequently, when Lake Burley Griffin was built upon the Molonglo and filled in 1964, the waters were devoid of native fish. Restocking commenced in the 1970s and continued through 1980s have re-established Murray Cod and Golden Perch in the lake and a short stretch of river upstream. A large stretch of the Molonglo still holds nothing but introduced fish species and is still waiting for the native fish species to be re-established by stockings.

Significant natural restoration work has been undertaken downstream of Scrivener Dam in conjunction with the housing development in the Molonglo Valley during the 2010s. In February 2024, construction began on a 200-metre-long bridge connecting Whitlam with the Molonglo Valley. It is expected to be completed in December 2025.

<doc id="586113" wikidata="Q1759267" url="?curid=586113" title="The Black Rider (album)">
<text>The Black Rider is the twelfth studio album by Tom Waits, released in 1993 on Island Records, featuring studio versions of songs Waits wrote for the play &quot;The Black Rider&quot;, directed by Robert Wilson and co-written by William S. Burroughs. The play is based on the German folktale &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; by Johann August Apel, which had previously been made into an opera by Carl Maria von Weber. It is about a clerk who makes a Faustian bargain for magic bullets, with tragic results. The play premiered on March 31, 1990, at the Thalia Theater in Hamburg, Germany. Its world English-language premiere occurred in 1998 at the Edmonton International Fringe Festival. Per the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;It’s most easily described as a Faustian musical-tragicomedy.&quot; 

Waits would later collaborate with Wilson on &quot;Alice&quot; (1992) and &quot;Woyzeck&quot; (2000); the songs for those were released on the albums &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Blood Money&quot;, respectively. 

==Background==
Per Will Penfeld,&quot;the German genesis of the &quot;Black Rider&quot; project is important, not only because the play – whose full title was &quot;The Black Rider: The Casting of the Magic Bullets&quot; – was based on a German folk tale, but because the album’s sound is distinctly European. A collision of avant-garde classical music, Northern European folk music and the decadent cabaret of Weimar Republic era Germany, the music was matched on stage with a striking visual sense influenced by the German Expressionist theater and cinema of the 1920s. At the same time, 10 years on from &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;, the album takes its cue from that album’s generally very un-rock‘n’roll musical texture; a melange of instruments that falls somewhere between homespun, pawn shop folksiness – banjo, accordion, viola – and actually home-made weirdness – bowed saw, unidentifiable percussion and stomping feet.&quot;

Waits is credited with the lyrics for all of the songs except for &quot;That&#x27;s The Way&quot;, &quot;Flash Pan Hunter&quot; and &quot;Crossroads&quot;, credited to Burroughs, and &quot;T&#x27;Aint No Sin&quot;, a jazz standard by Walter Donaldson and Edgar Leslie and performed by Burroughs on the album. &quot;Crossroads&quot; alludes to Burroughs&#x27;s experiences with addiction: &quot;You think you can take them bullets or leave &#x27;em, do you? Just save a few for your bad days. Well now we all have those bad days when you can&#x27;t hit for shit. The more of them magics you use, the more bad days you have without &#x27;em.&quot; Burroughs said: “I had the idea of comparing the magic bullet in the original German story to heroin. Once you use one, you’ll use another. Tom said, ‘Yeah, and the first one’s always free’ and of course that went right in.”

==Reception==

Lorraine Ari of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album four out of five stars: &quot;Just when it seemed that Los Angeles&#x27; premier bar casualty could not get any weirder, on his 15th album, Tom Waits teams up with beat writer William Burroughs (who turns up one song) to score a 19th century opera...The rich, dizzying tunes incorporate graveyard fright noises, bizarre piano sounds and creepy sci-fi whistles into traditional, orchestrated &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;-style melodies... Although this odd, operatic collaboration with Burroughs and Wilson does not completely fit in with the whiskey-and-bar-stool concept of Waits&#x27; previous albums, it does continue his intriguing expansion into more surreal realms. His dervishlike approach to &quot;The Black Rider&quot; makes you gawk like a freakshow spectator in fear, fascination and delight.&quot; 

Chris Willman of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the album three out of four stars: &quot;The story line is only partially apparent in this score, with Waits taking particular relish in essaying Scratch as another one of his carnival barker characters. Mostly it sounds a lot like the next Tom Waits album, with much the same unholy mixture of calliope-like chamber music, brutally melodic percussion and tortured lyricism as last year’s &quot;Bone Machine&quot;. This isn’t quite as superior a collection of songs as that was--but once again, cut through all the clatter and you’ll find some terrific ballad writing: &#x27;November has tied me / To an old dead tree / Get word to April / To rescue me.&#x27; Most song-crafters would sell their souls to write lines as good as those.&quot;

Will Pinfold writes in &quot;Spectrum Culture&quot;: &quot;The album’s most effective songs are perhaps those that draw on the wilder side of European folk music and meld it with cabaret, such as &#x27;Just the Right Bullets,&#x27; and the full-blooded romance of the stomping instrumental &#x27;Russian Dance,&#x27; but it’s an album full of unnerving and off-kilter delights. William Burroughs was an icon of the 20th century and a great writer, but the aural evidence suggests that, alas, he may have been tone deaf. The comic-macabre old show tune &#x27;’T’Ain’t No Sin,&#x27; with its refrain ‘T’ain’t no sin to take off your skin/ And dance around in your bones,&#x27; is a perfect fit for &quot;The Black Rider&quot;, but there’s a certain amount of irony in hearing Burroughs croak, &#x27;When you hear sweet syncopation/ And the music softly moans,&#x27; out of time and in no musical key recognised by medical science. Still, the song is a queasy treat; Waits must have known how it sounded when he recorded it.

&quot;The Black Rider&quot; has the distinction of being probably the most extreme album in Tom Waits’ entire oeuvre, not so much for its individual songs as for the contrasts between them. Along the way it includes what is undoubtedly – a bold claim, but true – some of Waits’s ugliest music... but alongside those are some of the most hauntingly beautiful ballads he has ever written. &#x27;November&#x27; opens with the unearthly, theremin-like sound of a bowed saw, and the song is essentially a catalogue of morbid, gloomy wintry imagery set to an organic, skeletal soundtrack of plucked banjo, accordion and pleasingly woody bass notes. Waits’ voice is at its expressive, elemental best and some of the lyrics, which conjure a dark, backwoods mysticism, are astoundingly nasty for such a pretty song: &#x27;With my hair slicked back/ With carrion shellac/ And blood from a pheasant/ And the bone from a hare…&#x27; Just as beautiful but less morbid and cold, &#x27;The Briar and the Rose&#x27; is a ballad of almost Victorian sentimentality. Its lyrics sound folkloric or even fairytale-like in their language, as with, &#x27;I fell asleep down by the stream/ And there I had the strangest dream/ Down by Brennan’s Glen there grows/ A briar and a rose.&#x27;”

Classes range from &quot;petite&quot; section (&quot;maternelle&quot;) to &quot;terminale&quot; (S, ES, L)

The school has one canteen, a basketball court and a handball court (which can be transformed in a soccer football court), a gym, and a swimming pool.

==History==

In 2009 some land was given back to the institution, and several people living in the land were evicted. Area residents asked for a delay in the process. Residents chose to celebrate the Cambodian New Year in their residences instead of in their hometowns because they were afraid evictions would happen if they were away. Ten people asked the French embassy in Phnom Penh to assist them. Several students protested in favour of the residents.

==Management==
From a financial, administrative, material and real estate stand point the school is under parental management through its Comité de Gestion. The five parents in the comité are elected by a General Assembly in May of each year.

With respect to teaching, the school is managed by a Proviseur who oversees the operations of the whole school and in particular the teaching needs of the secondary school. The Proviseur, who reports directly to the AEFE, is responsible for certifying that the teachings are in line with that of the French Ministry of Education.

The Directeur du Primaire is responsible for overseeing the operations of the Kindergarten and Primary school. The Directeur 
reports directly to the AEFE.

<text>Grupo Financiero Banorte, S.A.B. de C.V., doing business as Banorte (&quot;Banco Mercantil del Norte&quot;) and as Ixe, is a Mexican banking and financial services holding company with headquarters in Monterrey and Mexico City. It is one of the four largest commercial banks of Mexico by assets and loans, and the largest retirement fund administrator (AFORE).

Grupo Financiero Banorte operates its commercial bank under the brands Banorte and Ixe, offering savings accounts, credit cards, payday loans, mortgages, commercial loans and auto loans. Its performing loan portfolio was of US$35 billion in 2014. It also performs insurance, pension, leasing, and brokerage activities.

Banorte has 1,269 branches and 7,297 ATMs nationwide. It can also receive deposits through more than 5,200 commercial establishments, such as drug stores, convenience stores, and supermarkets.

Grupo Financiero Banorte is listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange and on the Latibex. It is a constituent of the IPC, the main benchmark index of the Mexican Stock Exchange, and of the S&amp;P Latin America 40, which includes leading, blue chip companies from Latin America.

==History==

Banorte was founded in 1992 in the city of Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico and is the primary subsidiary of Grupo Financiero Banorte, one of Mexico&#x27;s largest and oldest financial institutions, which has been present in Mexico since 1899. The &quot;Banorte&quot; trademark is a well-known mark in Mexico. The web domain name &quot;banorte.com&quot; was created in 1998.

It is a Forbes Global 2000 company, with total consolidated assets of approximately $80 billion, more than 30 billion dollars in assets under management, 12,500 employees and 950 branches. It is the only major bank in Mexico not owned by any foreign group. 

It was established in 1889 as Banco Mercantil de Monterrey. In 1985 merged with Banco Regional del Norte to form Banco Mercantil del Norte (Banorte). In 1992, it was purchased from the Mexican Government by a group of investors headed by the Mexican businessman Roberto González Barrera. Over the next decade, Banorte transformed itself from a regional bank, based mainly in the northern Mexico, to one with nationwide coverage. In late 2001, Banorte acquired Bancrecer in US$125 million. Bancrecer had been taken over in 1999 by IPAB. Bancrecer had itself taken over another bank, Banco del Noroeste (Banoro), in 1997.

Banorte expanded their business lines to include leasing (Arrendadora Banorte) in 1990, and to warehousing and factoring services (Almacenadora Banorte and Factor Banorte) in 1991. In order to set up a financial group with full services Banorte wanted a securities company under its control, and Banorte acquired Casa de Bolsa Afin in July 1993. In 1997, Banorte established an alliance with the Italian insurance company Generali to offer insurance, pension funds, and Afore&#x27;s services through their subsidiaries Afore Banorte-Generalli, Seguros Banorte-Generalli and Pensiones Banorte-Generalli.

Banorte has operations in New York (Banorte Securities) and Grand Cayman (Banorte Grand Cayman Branch).

Key numbers for fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 for Grupo Financiero Banorte:

* Total Assets: 1.6 trillion pesos (US$90 billion)&lt;br&gt;Equity: 237 billion pesos (US$11 billion)&lt;br&gt;Return on assets (ROA): 1.6%
* Return on average Equity (ROE): 15.3%

== Money laundering involvement in US Operation Casablanca ==

Operation Casablanca was a three-year U.S. investigation of major Mexican banking institutions for laundering illicit drug profits. Mexican authorities were not informed about the investigation.

This operations led U.S. Customs agents to arrest 22 high-ranking and mid-level bankers from 12 of Mexico&#x27;s largest banks when they traveled to the U.S. in mid-May, expecting to attend a banking conference. The investigation produced 160 indictments, including 3 Mexican banks and 26 Mexican bankers. Banorte was among the banks and bankers implicated in money laundry, according to the Operation Casablanca. From the June to July 1998 issue of &quot;Money Laundering Alert&quot;, Banorte was suspected to have laundered $7,323,103.51, and Banorte faced a civil penalty lawsuit under Title 18, USC Sec. 1956(b) and civil forfeiture action under Title 18, USC Secs. 981 &amp; 984. On July 1, 1999, a U.S. federal judge in Los Angeles dismissed with &quot;extreme prejudice&quot; the forfeiture case against Banorte. No criminal charges were filed and U.S. authorities gave them back $1.4 million seized in the operation. Banorte had implemented anti-money laundering policies and procedures and had detected and closed money laundering accounts prior to Operation Casablanca. These policies and practices assisted Banorte in defending itself against the money laundering charges.

==Banorte&#x27;s entry to the US banking market==

In 2006, Banorte acquired 70% of INB Financial Corp stock for $259 million. INB Financial Corp is the holding company of Texas-based Inter National Bank. Banorte exercised its option to acquire the remaining 30% of INB Financial Corp stock for $146.6 million in 2009. As of March 2013, Inter National Bank has $2.1 billion in assets and is the 19th largest Texas bank.

==Sponsorship==
As of 2020, Banorte has been the sponsor of the Mérida Marathon in Mérida, Mexico, a city in the state of Yucatan.

<doc id="586133" wikidata="Q6171655" url="?curid=586133" title="Death zone">
<text>In mountaineering, the death zone refers to altitudes above which the pressure of oxygen is insufficient to sustain human life for an extended time span. This point is generally agreed as , where atmospheric pressure is less than . The concept was conceived in 1953 by Edouard Wyss-Dunant, a Swiss doctor, who called it the lethal zone. All 14 peaks above 8000 m (the &quot;eight-thousanders&quot;) in the death zone are located in the Himalaya and Karakoram regions of Asia.

Many deaths in high-altitude mountaineering have been caused by the effects of the death zone, either directly by the loss of vital functions or indirectly by poor decisions made under stress (e.g., not turning back in deteriorating conditions, or misreading the climbing route), or physical weakening leading to accidents (e.g., falls). An extended stay above without supplementary oxygen will result in deterioration of bodily functions and death.

== Physiological background ==
The human body has optimal endurance below elevation. The concentration of oxygen (O2) in air is 20.9% so the partial pressure of O2 (PO2) at sea level is about . In healthy
individuals, this saturates hemoglobin, the oxygen-binding red pigment in red blood cells.

Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude while the O2 fraction remains constant to about , so PO2 decreases with altitude as well. It is about half of its sea level value at , the altitude of the Mount Everest base camp, and less than a third at , the summit of Mount Everest. When PO2 drops, the body responds with altitude acclimatization. Additional red blood cells are manufactured; the heart beats faster; non-essential body functions are suppressed, food digestion efficiency declines (as the body suppresses the digestive system in favor of increasing its cardiopulmonary reserves); and one breathes more deeply and more frequently. But acclimatization requires days or even weeks. Failure to acclimatize may result in altitude sickness, including high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or cerebral edema (HACE).

Humans have survived for 2 years at [ of atmospheric pressure], which appears to be near the limit of the permanently tolerable highest altitude. At extreme altitudes, above [ of atmospheric pressure], sleeping becomes very difficult, digesting food is near-impossible, and the risk of HAPE or HACE increases greatly.

In the death zone and higher, no human body can acclimatize. The body uses up its store of oxygen faster than it can be replenished. An extended stay in the zone without supplementary oxygen will result in deterioration of body functions, loss of consciousness, and ultimately, death. Scientists at the High Altitude Pathology Institute in Bolivia dispute the existence of a death zone, based on observation of extreme tolerance to hypoxia in patients with chronic mountain sickness and normal fetuses in-utero, both of which present pO2 levels similar to those at the summit of Mount Everest.

==Supplemental oxygen==

Mountaineers use supplemental oxygen in the death zone to reduce deleterious effects. An open-circuit oxygen apparatus was first tested on the 1922 and 1924 British Mount Everest expeditions; the bottled oxygen taken in 1921 was not used (see George Finch and Noel Odell). In 1953 the first assault party of Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans used closed-circuit oxygen apparatus. The second (successful) party of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay used open-circuit oxygen apparatus; after ten minutes taking photographs on the summit without his oxygen set on, Hillary said he &quot;was becoming rather clumsy-fingered and slow-moving&quot;. 

Physiologist Griffith Pugh was on the 1952 and 1953 expeditions to study the effects of cold and altitude; he recommended acclimatising above for at least 36 days and the use of closed-circuit equipment. He further studied the ability to acclimatise over several months on the 1960–61 Silver Hut expedition to the Himalayas. 

In 1978, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler made the first ascent of Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen.

==Notable disasters==
Several expeditions have encountered disaster in the death zone that led to multiple fatalities, including:
*1996 Mount Everest disaster
*2008 K2 disaster

<doc id="586135" wikidata="Q7817800" url="?curid=586135" title="Tom Terrific">
<text>Tom Terrific is a 1957–1959 animated series on American television, presented as part of the &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; children&#x27;s television show.

Created by Gene Deitch under the Terrytoons studio (which by that time was a subsidiary of CBS, the network that broadcast &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;), &quot;Tom Terrific&quot; was made as twenty-six stories, each split into five episodes, with one five-minute episode broadcast per day. The first thirteen stories were filmed in 1957, with the second set in 1958. &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; continued to rerun the episodes for many years. Starting in 1962, &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; broadcast &quot;Tom Terrific&quot; every other week, alternating with Terrytoons&#x27; &quot;Lariat Sam&quot;.

Drawn in a simple black-and white style reminiscent of children&#x27;s drawings, the show features a gee-whiz boy hero, Tom Terrific, who lives in a treehouse and can transform himself into anything he wants, thanks to his magical funnel-shaped &quot;thinking cap&quot;, which also enhances his intelligence. He has a comic lazybones of a sidekick, Mighty Manfred the Wonder Dog, and an arch-foe named Crabby Appleton, whose motto is, &quot;I&#x27;m rotten to the core!&quot; Other foes include Mr. Instant the Instant Thing King, Captain Kidney Bean, Sweet Tooth Sam the Candy Bandit, and Isotope Feeney the Meany. Some of the dialogue was written by cartoonist Jules Feiffer.

Gene Deitch adapted the feature from his earlier newspaper comic strip, &quot;Terr&#x27;ble Thompson!&quot; distributed during the 1950s by United Features Syndicate. Terr&#x27;ble Thompson was a six-year-old boy who imagined himself to be the &quot;Hero of Hist&#x27;ry&quot; and freely travelled back in time to assist historical figures. An illustrated book reprinting the adventures of this precursor to Tom Terrific was published by Fantagraphics Books.

All the voices were performed by Lionel Wilson (who later voiced Eustace Bagge from the Cartoon Network series &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;).

The character Tom Terrific was ranked #32 by &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine on its 2002 list of &quot;50 Greatest TV Cartoon Characters&quot;.

==Episodes==
Each episode was shown in five installments, one per day, Monday through Friday.
==Home video==
, there has not been an authorized VHS, DVD or Blu-ray release of the series.

<doc id="586138" wikidata="Q333856" url="?curid=586138" title="Vinicius de Moraes">
<text>Marcus Vinícius da Cruz e Mello Moraes (19 October 1913 – 9 July 1980), better known as Vinícius de Moraes () and nicknamed &quot;O Poetinha&quot; (&quot;The Little Poet&quot;), was a Brazilian poet, diplomat, lyricist, essayist, musician, singer, and playwright. With his frequent and diverse musical partners, including Antônio Carlos Jobim, his lyrics and compositions were instrumental in the birth and introduction to the world of bossa nova music. He recorded numerous albums, many in collaboration with noted artists, and also served as a successful Brazilian career diplomat.

== Early life ==

Moraes was born in Gávea, a neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro, to Clodoaldo da Silva Pereira Moraes, a public servant, and Lidia Cruz, a housewife and amateur pianist. In 1916, his family moved to Botafogo, where he attended Afrânio Peixoto Primary School. Fleeing the Copacabana Fort revolt, his parents moved to Governador Island while Moraes remained at his grandfather&#x27;s home in Botafogo to finish school. During visits with his parents on weekends and holidays, he became acquainted with the accomplished composer Ary Barroso.

Beginning in 1924, Moraes attended St. Ignatius, a Jesuit high school, where he sang in the choir and wrote theatrical sketches. Three years later, he became friends with the brothers Paulo and Haroldo Tapajós, with whom he wrote his first musical compositions, which were performed at friends&#x27; parties. In 1929, he completed high school and his family moved back to Gávea. That same year, he was admitted to the Faculty of Law at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). At the &quot;School of Catete&quot;, he became friends with essayist and future novelist Otávio de Faria, an activist integrist Catholic and leader of a group of right-wing Catholics organized around Centro Dom Vital, a think-tank created by Jackson de Figueiredo shortly before his death.

Faria encouraged Moraes&#x27; literary vocation, and tried to recruit him to the conservative cause. Moraes received his college degree in Legal and Social Sciences in 1933. Soon after, he published his first two collections of poetry: &quot;Caminho para a distancia&quot; (&quot;Path into the Distance&quot;) (1933) and &quot;Forma e exegese&quot; (&quot;Form and Exegesis&quot;). Both collections were composed and published under Octavio de Faria&#x27;s informal editorship. The collections were symbolist poetry concerned with Catholic mysticism and the search for redemption of sexual seduction.

In his essay &quot;Two Poets&quot; (1935), Faria compared Moraes&#x27; poetry to that of Augusto Frederico Schmidt. The tension between Faria&#x27;s and Moraes&#x27; shared Catholic activism and Faria&#x27;s unrequited attraction to Moraes strained their friendship. Faria attempted suicide because of this unrequited love. Despite their estrangement, Moraes wrote two sonnets, the first in 1939 (&quot;Sonnet to Octavio de Faria&quot;), the second during the 1960s (&quot;Octavio&quot;) in carefully couched praise of his friend.

In 1936, Moraes became a film censor for the Ministry of Education and Health. Two years later, he won a British Council fellowship to study English language and literature at Magdalen College, Oxford University. He abandoned his use of blank verse and free verse in favor of the sonnet, both the Italian form used in Portuguese poetry (two quatrains, two tercets) and the English form (three quatrains and a couplet). He was considered one of the most prominent of the &quot;Generation of &#x27;45&quot;, a group of Brazilian writers in the 1930s and 1940s who rejected early modernism in favor of traditional forms and vocabulary. If João Cabral de Melo Neto&#x27;s works and technique served the depiction of objective reality, those of Moraes served the depiction of the subjective mood of sexual love. The basic meter in Moraes&#x27; love poetry is the decasyllable, taken mostly from Camões&#x27;s lyric poetry.

During his stay in England, Moraes wrote the verse collection &quot;Novos poemas&quot; (&quot;New Poems&quot;). While there, he married (by proxy) Beatriz Azevedo de Mello, with whom he subsequently had two children: filmmaker Suzana de Moraes and Pedro. In 1941, he returned to Brazil and worked as a film critic for the newspaper &quot;A Manhã&quot; (&quot;The Morning&quot;), as a contributor to the literary journal &quot;Clima&quot; (&quot;Climate&quot;), and at the Banking Employees&#x27; Institute of Social Security, the public pension fund for workers in banking institutions.

During the following year, he failed the admission test for a diplomatic career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MRE). Shortly after, he was hired to accompany American writer Waldo Frank, a literary acquaintance, on tour across northern Brazil. In Moraes&#x27; words, it was contact with both Frank and &quot;appalling poverty&quot; that turned him into &quot;a man of the Left&quot;.

In 1943, Moraes passed the MRE admission test on his second attempt and as his first posting was assigned as vice-consul at the Brazilian Consulate in Los Angeles, California. There, he published a book of poems, &quot;Cinco elegias&quot; (&quot;Five Elegies&quot;), followed by &quot;Poemas, sonetos e baladas&quot; (&quot;Poems, Sonnets, and Ballads&quot;). After his father died in 1950, he went to Brazil, then returned to Los Angeles and published two more books: &quot;Livro de sonetos&quot; (&quot;Book of Sonnets&quot;) and &quot;Novos poemas II&quot; (&quot;New Poems II&quot;). Continuing his diplomatic career, during the 1950s, Moraes worked for the Brazilian consular service in Paris and Rome. In Rome, he often visited historian Sergio Buarque de Holanda (father of the musician Chico Buarque de Holanda), who was teaching in Italy as a visiting scholar.

In 1951, Moraes married his second wife, Lila Maria Esquerdo e Boscoli. He wrote film reviews for Samuel Wainer&#x27;s Vargoist paper &quot;Última Hora&quot;. He was named a delegate to the Punta del Este film festival and was given a commission to study the management of film festivals at Cannes, Berlin, Locarno, and Venice, in view of the forthcoming São Paulo Cinema Festival, which was to be a part of the commemoration of the city&#x27;s 400th anniversary.

In 1953, his third child, Georgiana, was born, and his fourth child with Lila Maria was born in 1956. He went to Paris as the second secretary at the Brazilian embassy in France. He released his first samba, &quot;Quando tu passas por mim&quot; (&quot;When You Pass By&quot;), which was composed with Antônio Maria. During the next year, he wrote lyrics to chamber music pieces by Cláudio Santoro. He became a well-known playwright with the staging of his musical &quot;Orfeu da Conceição&quot; (&quot;Orpheus of the Conception&quot;) in 1956 and for the film made of it called &quot;Black Orpheus&quot;. He met pianist Tom Jobim, who was commissioned to write music for the play. Jobim wrote &quot;Se todos fossem iguais a você&quot; (&quot;If Others Were Like You&quot;), &quot;Um nome de mulher&quot; (&quot;A Woman&#x27;s Name&quot;), and other songs included in the production. The play was staged in 1956 in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, having its text published in a deluxe edition illustrated by Carlos Scliar. At the end of 1956, Moraes returned to France, having been transferred in 1957 from the Brazilian embassy to the Brazilian representation at UNESCO in Paris. In 1958, he was transferred to the Brazilian embassy in Montevideo, returning to Brazil in transit. While in Brazil, he married Maria Lucia Proença.

== Bossa nova ==
Elizete Cardoso&#x27;s &quot;Canção do Amor Demais&quot; -- a seminal album in the development of bossa nova -- consists of compositions by Jobim and Moraes, either working together or solo (&quot;Canção do Amor Demais&quot;, &quot;Luciana&quot;, &quot;Estrada Branca&quot;, &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot;, &quot;Outra Vez&quot;...). The recording also included a relatively unknown João Gilberto on two tracks. With the release of this record, Moraes&#x27;s career in music had begun.

In August 1962, Moraes performed for the first time as a singer with Jobim and Gilberto at the Au Bon Gourmet in Rio. This was the first of his &quot;pocket-shows&quot;, performances made to small audiences where he presented new compositions, some of which became international hits, such as the &quot;Garota de Ipanema&quot; (&quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;), as well as &quot;Samba da Benção&quot;. Moraes introduced promising singers of the time, such as Nara Leão. Moraes wasn&#x27;t a natural singer. He had a flat, nasal baritone voice, but he used background vocalists to sweeten the sound. His first undertaking as entertainer ended in 1963, when he returned to his post in the Brazilian representation at UNESCO, after his marriage to Nelita Abreu Rocha, his fourth wife.

== Cinema recognition and collaborations ==
His play &quot;Orfeu da conceição&quot; (&quot;Orpheus of the Conception&quot;), a reworking of the story of Orpheus and Eurydice set in the carnival of Rio, was adapted into the film &quot;Black Orpheus&quot;, which won an Academy Award in 1959 as Best Foreign Language Film. It was awarded the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; at the Cannes International Film Festival and the 1960 British Academy Award. De Moraes hated the film, however, leaving mid-screening and shouting that his play had been &quot;disfigured&quot;; the film has been criticized in Brazil since release for its exoticism and stereotyping of Brazilians. The film was a co-production among France, Italy, and Brazil and included &quot;A felicidade&quot; (&quot;Happiness&quot;), a song by Jobim and Moraes, which became an international hit. His song &quot;Samba da bênção&quot; (&quot;The Blessing Samba&quot;) was included on the soundtrack of &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot; (&quot;Un homme et une femme&quot;, 1966), another Cannes film festival winner.

== Later life ==
During the 1960s and 1970s, Moraes collaborated with Baden Powell on a series of songs known as the &quot;Afro sambas&quot;. He collaborated with Edu Lobo on the Elis Regina hit song &quot;Arrastão&quot;.

During a purge at the Ministry of Foreign Relations, he was forcibly retired in 1969 at the age of 55. Although taken aback by his forced retirement, he laughed at the case against him. When it was made known that the ministry purge was directed against &quot;homosexuals and drunks&quot;, he jokingly retorted that his alcoholism was public knowledge.

In the 1970s, Moraes collaborated with Antônio Pecci Filho, a guitarist and vocalist nicknamed Toquinho on musical and literary works. He married three women in succession: Cristina Gurjão, with whom he had a daughter, Maria; the actress Gesse Gessy; and the Argentinian Marta Rodrigues Santamaria. He toured Europe with Chico Buarque and Nara Leão, and Argentina with Dorival Caymmi and Oscar Castro-Neves. His most stable musical partnership, however, remained with Toquinho, with whom he released popular albums. Their live performances in Brazil and Europe were often conducted as intimate meetings with the public. Moraes sat onstage at a table with a checked tablecloth and a bottle of whiskey, chatting and telling amusing stories to the audience in French, English, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese.

==Death and legacy==
Moraes was a chain smoker and alcoholic who said, &quot;O uísque é o melhor amigo do homem—é o cão engarrafado&quot; (&quot;Whiskey is man&#x27;s best friend, it&#x27;s the dog in a bottle&quot;), After a long period of poor health, which included several visits to rehabilitation clinics, he died at his home in Rio de Janeiro on 9 July 1980, at the age of 66, in the company of his ninth wife, Gilda de Queirós Mattoso, and the faithful Toquinho. He is buried in Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Cemitério São João Batista.

In 2006, Moraes was posthumously reinstated to the Brazilian diplomatic corps. In February 2010, Brazil&#x27;s lower house, the Camara dos Deputados, approved his posthumous promotion to Ambassador.

In December 2014, following a three-week public vote, the mascot of the 2016 Summer Olympics was named after him.

<doc id="586139" wikidata="Q4962106" url="?curid=586139" title="Brett Butler (baseball)">
<text>Brett Morgan Butler (born June 15, 1957) is an American former center fielder in Major League Baseball and coach. He played for five different teams from 1981 through 1997. A leadoff hitter for the majority of his career, Butler led the league in triples and runs scored twice each and was named a National League All-Star in 1991. He was diagnosed with cancer in May 1996, received treatment and returned to the playing field four months later. He retired in 1997 and began a baseball coaching career. He has coached or managed numerous professional teams. He was the manager of the Reno Aces minor league team from late 2008 through 2013.

==Playing career==
Butler spent his teenaged years in Libertyville, Illinois, where he was a starting outfielder on the Libertyville High School baseball team that finished in the top 16 teams in the state his senior year. Upon graduating, he announced plans to play baseball in college, and his high school coach, Ernie Ritta, scoffed. Butler, who had explored walking on at baseball powerhouse Arizona State, made the team at Southeastern Oklahoma State University. The outfielder led the Savages to championships during all three years at Southeastern including an NAIA national runner-up finish in 1977. He was twice named to the NAIA All-America Baseball Team. Butler was the Savages&#x27; first .400 hitter with a .439 average in 1977. He set career records in home runs (31), runs (209), triples (15), hits (220), walks (162), and career batting average (.394).

After attending Southeastern Oklahoma, Butler was drafted in the 23rd round of the 1979 amateur draft by the Atlanta Braves. The Braves were building a contending team with players like Dale Murphy, Bob Horner, and Glenn Hubbard after years of losing, but they lacked a leadoff hitter with speed. After playing in the minor leagues, he made his major league debut with the Braves on August 20, 1981. Butler helped lead the Braves to a 13–0 start and the National League West Division title in 1982, their first division title since 1969. He had another fine year with the Braves in 1983, but they finished second in the West to the Los Angeles Dodgers.

In October 1983, Butler was sent to the Cleveland Indians (along with Brook Jacoby and Rick Behenna) to complete a deal in which the Braves had acquired Len Barker for cash, toward the end of the 1983 season. In 1984, he became the first batter Roger Clemens would face in the big leagues. He played with the Indians for four seasons, batting a career-high .311 in 1985.

Butler signed with the San Francisco Giants as a free agent after the 1987 season and established himself as one of the premier leadoff hitters in the National League. He helped the Giants to the NL pennant in 1989, as the leadoff hitter in a lineup that included Will Clark, Kevin Mitchell, and Matt Williams.

Following the 1990 season, Butler signed a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. As a member of the Dodgers from 1991 to 1995, Butler reached the prime of his career. In 1991, Butler led the National League in runs scored and walks, earned a roster spot on the National League All-Star team, and finished seventh in MVP voting. During the 1995 season, Butler was signed as a free agent by the New York Mets. In August 1995, Butler rejoined the Dodgers in a trade for Dwight Manees and Scott Hunter. After finishing the season with the Dodgers, he again became a free agent and returned to the Dodgers.

In May 1996, Butler learned that he was suffering from squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsils, a type of cancer which only rarely involves the tonsils. Butler was not a smoker himself, but had grown up in a home where both parents smoked heavily, and thus had significant exposure to second-hand smoke for years, which his doctors speculated was the likely cause of his cancer. Following an operation to remove the tumor, and intensive treatment to combat the disease, he returned to the Dodgers&#x27; lineup in September of the same year—defying the predictions of those who had speculated he would never be able to play again. Butler finished the 1996 season with the Dodgers and played with them for one more year, participating in his final game on September 28, 1997.

In 1996, he was awarded the Branch Rickey Award, which honored his outstanding community service.

Over his career, Butler produced a .290 batting average, 2,375 hits, and 558 stolen bases. Many consider him to be one of the best leadoff hitters of the 1980s and early 1990s, due to his high on-base percentage, speed and dynamic bunting. Butler currently ranks 130th on the list of career hits. Butler finished in the top 25 voting for National League Most Valuable Player five times in his career (1988-1992 and 1994); in 1991, he finished seventh in NL MVP voting and was named an all-star. Butler recorded a .993 fielding percentage at center field in his major league career.

==Coaching career==
Butler began his coaching career in the spring of 1998 as the assistant coach of the Duluth Youth Baseball and Softball Association&#x27;s Minor League Dodgers team, the team on which his son was playing. He was able to secure and provide replica game and practice uniforms for the boys and coaches. Butler helped coach the Dodgers to a second-place finish in the Minor League championship game that season.

Butler was a coach with the Arizona Diamondbacks for the 2005 season. He was hired to manage the Lancaster JetHawks of the Class-A advanced club for the 2006 season. He was hired to manage the Mobile BayBears, a newly acquired Double-AA team for the Arizona Diamondbacks, for the 2007 season.
In October 2008, it was announced that Butler was hired to manage the Reno Aces of the Class-AAA club for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Butler was named as a coach for the 2011 All-Star Futures Game. In 2012, Butler led the Reno Aces to their first ever Pacific Coast League Championship and also led them to the Triple-AAA National Championship in the same year, where they defeated the Pawtucket Red Sox 10-3.

On October 11, 2013, Butler was named the third base/outfield coach for the Miami Marlins.

==Personal life==
Butler is a Christian. Butler&#x27;s wife&#x27;s name is Eveline, and they have four children, Blake, Abbi, Katie, and Stefanie.

On April 24, 2006, Butler was hospitalized with chest pains after a Lancaster JetHawks game he managed. Butler apparently did not have a heart attack, and underwent further tests. Butler returned to his coaching duties &quot;after a week off due to a viral infection.&quot;

On July 29, 2007, Butler was hospitalized again after suffering a mild stroke.

<doc id="586156" wikidata="Q4863373" url="?curid=586156" title="Barren Island, Brooklyn">
<text>Barren Island is a peninsula and former island on the southeast shore of Brooklyn in New York City. Located on Jamaica Bay, it was geographically part of the Outer Barrier island group on the South Shore of Long Island. The island was occupied by the Lenape Native Americans prior to the arrival of Dutch settlers in the 17th century. Its name is a corruption of , the Dutch-language term for &quot;Bears&#x27; Island&quot;.

Barren Island remained sparsely inhabited before the 19th century, mainly because of its relative isolation from the rest of the city. Starting in the 1850s, the island was developed as an industrial complex with fish rendering plants and other industries, and also as an ethnically diverse community of up to 1,500 residents. Between the mid-19th century and 1934, the island housed industrial plants that processed the carcasses of the city&#x27;s dead horses, converting them into a variety of industrial products. This activity led to the still-extant waterbody on the island&#x27;s western shore becoming nicknamed &quot;Dead Horse Bay&quot;. A garbage incinerator, which became the subject of numerous complaints because of its odor, operated on the island from the 1890s to 1921.

The Barren Island community became known as South Flatlands during its final years. By the 1920s, most of the industrial activity had tapered off, and landfill was used to unite the island with the rest of Brooklyn. While most residents were evicted in the late 1920s for the construction of Floyd Bennett Field, some were permitted to stay until 1942, when the airfield was expanded as a wartime base of the United States Navy. No trace remains of the former island&#x27;s industrial use. Since 1972, Floyd Bennett Field has been part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, managed by the National Park Service.

==Geography and ecology==
Barren Island was originally part of an estuary at the mouth of Jamaica Bay and acted as a barrier island for the larger Long Island, located to Barren Island&#x27;s north. The bay, in turn, was created during the end of the Wisconsin glaciation. The edge of the glacier had been in the middle of Long Island, creating a series of hills across the island. The water from the melting glacier ran downhill toward a low-lying delta that adjoined the Atlantic Ocean, which later became Jamaica Bay. A body of water called Rockaway Inlet, located south of the island, connected the bay with the ocean. By the late 17th century, Barren Island had of salt meadows and of uplands, as well as cedar forests. Salt, reed grasses, and hay served as food for early settlers&#x27; livestock.

Barren Island&#x27;s geography was significantly altered by shifting tides and storms in the 19th century. Originally, it was part of the Outer Barrier, a series of barrier islands on Long Island&#x27;s southern shore. Barren Island, the Rockaways, Pelican Beach, and Plumb Beach were separate barrier islands protecting Jamaica Bay. In an 1818 survey of Long Island, Barren Island was described as having dunes and scattered trees. By 1839, Barren Island, Plumb Beach, and Pelican Beach were a single island, separated from Coney Island to the west by Plumb Beach Inlet. By the end of the century, Gerritsen Inlet had formed, separating Barren Island from Plumb and Pelican Beaches.

The neighboring island of Rockaway Beach also had a large impact on Barren Island&#x27;s geography. Originally, Rockaway was located to Barren&#x27;s east, and the two islands&#x27; southern tips were aligned. From the mid-19th century, Rockaway Beach was extended more than to the southwest after several jetties were built to protect manmade developments there. This caused changes to Barren Island&#x27;s ecology, because during the early 20th century, it had contained sand dunes on the coasts and salt marshes inland. As a result of the extension of Rockaway Beach, Barren Island was no longer a barrier island and its beach was washed away.

By the late 1920s, industrial development on Barren Island&#x27;s eastern side had transformed that area, with a small patch of dunes remaining. The western side of the island, containing dunes, woods, and wetlands, was largely untouched. The southern coast contained a tidal creek stretching into the center of the island, where the tidal wetlands remained mostly intact. The wetlands were abutted by the human-made Mill Basin to the north. Tidal creeks also stretched across the island&#x27;s marshes, although one of these creeks was bisected by the construction of Flatbush Avenue in 1925. In addition, the water adjoining the northern and western coasts had become heavily polluted. The entirety of the former island, covering , was converted to a peninsula during the 1920s. It is occupied by Floyd Bennett Field, which in turn is part of the Gateway National Recreation Area.

==Name==

The Barren Island area was originally the homeland of the Canarsee, a group of Lenape Native Americans, who referred to the archipelago of islands near it by a name alternatively transcribed as &quot;Equandito&quot;, &quot;Equendito&quot;, or &quot;Equindito&quot;, which means &quot;Broken Lands&quot;. This name also applied to several smaller islands in the area, such as Mill Island. Throughout its existence, Barren Island has also been referred to as &quot;Broken Lands&quot; in English, as well as &quot;Bearn Island&quot;, &quot;Barn Island&quot;, and &quot;Bear&#x27;s Island&quot;. The name &quot;Barren Island&quot; is a corruption of the Dutch ; it does not relate to the English word describing the geography of the island.

==Settlement==
A State University of New York study stated that the indigenous Canarsee likely used Barren Island to fish. In 1636, as New Netherland was expanding outward from present-day Manhattan, Dutch settlers founded the town of Achtervelt (later Amersfoort) and purchased around Jamaica Bay north of Barren Island. Amersfoort was centered around the present-day intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Flatlands Avenue, approximately northwest of Barren Island. In 1664, New Netherland became the English Province of New York, and Amersfoort was renamed Flatlands. The island, as well as nearby Mill Basin, was sold to John Tilton Jr. and Samuel Spicer that year.

Canarsee leaders had signed 22 land agreements with Dutch settlers by 1684, which handed ownership of much of their historic land, including Barren Island, to the Dutch. Barren Island was one of the first barrier islands to be settled because it was easily accessible. At low tide, people on mainland Brooklyn could walk across a shallow stream, while at high tide, small craft could access the northern coast and larger craft could dock on the southern coast.

Barren Island, as well as nearby Mill Island and Bergen Island, were part of the Town of Flatlands. By the 1670s, all three islands were leased by a settler named Elbert Elbertse. Records from 1679 indicate that Elbertse had complained that other settlers were going to Barren Island to let their horses graze on his land. The settler William Moore started digging sand from the island in the 1740s. Moore characterized the island as &quot;vacant and unoccupied&quot; in 1762, and it remained as such until the end of that century, being used mainly as a grazing field. Even during the first half of the 19th century, the island had few residents. Circa 1800, a man named Nicholas Dooley established an inn and entertainment venue for fishermen and hunters on the east side of Barren Island; the house&#x27;s ownership later passed to the Johnson family. Two more residences were built on the island before 1860, for the Skidmore and Cherry families. Maps from that time do not show any other human-made structures on Barren Island.

The National Park Service states that the pirate Charles Gibbs buried Mexican silver on the island . According to an 1839 account, some of the treasure was later recovered. A handbook from the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; states that a portion of the treasure was retrieved in 1842, while the remainder was never found.

== Fish-oil and fertilizer plants ==

The naturally deep Rockaway Inlet, combined with the remoteness of Barren Island from the rest of the developed city, made the island suitable for industrial uses. An isolated settlement on the island was developed in the late 19th century. From 1859 to 1934, approximately 26 industries had opened facilities on Barren Island, mostly on the eastern and southern coasts. Few industrial sectors were enticed to move to Barren Island, precisely because of its isolation: there were no direct land routes to the rest of the city. Waste management was the sole industry for which Barren Island was an ideal location, and became its main industry.

The island&#x27;s first main industrial use was for fish rendering plants, as well as for fertilizer plants that processed offal products. The fish rendering plants processed schools of menhaden, a type of fish that was caught off the coast of Long Island, and turned them into fish oil or scraps. Meanwhile, the fertilizer plants turned horse bones into glue, as well as fertilizer, buttons, and materials for refining gold and sugar. The plants processed almost 20,000 horse corpses annually at their peak, leading to the nickname &quot;Dead Horse Bay&quot; for the still-extant water body on the island&#x27;s western shore, since the waste processors on the island would simply dump the processed waste into that bay. By the late 1850s, two plants had been built on the island. The plant on the eastern shore was operated by Lefferts R. Cornell and processed animal carcases; after the facility was destroyed by fire in 1859, Cornell moved his factory to Flatbush. The other corpse-processing plant, on the western shore, was operated by William B. Reynolds and ceased operations during the 1860s. These fertilizer factories were the first buildings on Barren Island for which the town of Flatlands imposed property taxes.

Ownership of part of the island passed in 1861 to Francis Swift. No new factories were developed until at least 1868, when Smith &amp; Co. opened a fish-processing factory. Steinfield and Company operated a factory from 1869 to 1873, but its purpose is unknown. A person named Simpson opened a factory on Barren Island in 1870, which closed two years later. Swift and E. P. White also created their own fertilizer factory in 1872, which operated until the 1930s. A factory belonging to the Products Manufacturing Company, located where Flatbush Avenue is now, was reportedly the world&#x27;s largest carcass-processing plant. Through the 1870s, eight more factories opened on the island, of which two operated only briefly. Barren Island&#x27;s factories, which were vulnerable to landslides, fires, or waves from high-tide, typically lasted for fleeting periods of time. White&#x27;s factory burned down in 1878 and was soon rebuilt. By 1883, the island&#x27;s oil factories hired a combined 350 men and collectively used 10 steamships.

The waste-processing factories on Barren Island supported a small but thriving community, which was clustered on the island&#x27;s southeastern coast. In a census conducted by the town of Flatlands in 1870, it was noted than 24 people, all single men who had immigrated from Europe, lived in a single residence and likely worked at an oil factory on Barren Island. A subsequent census in 1880 counted six households that were entirely composed of single men, as well as 17 families, and found that 309 people resided on the island. That same year, it was recorded that the island had three fish oil factories and four fertilizer plants. The development of Barren Island continued in tandem with the population growth: in 1878, there were six large structures on the island&#x27;s southern and eastern coasts, in contrast to the single hotel that had been reported in the 1852 map. By 1884, five hundred people worked on the island. The 1892 New York state census recorded four large &quot;clusters&quot; of laborers, from the same countries as the 1880 census, who resided in the same households on Barren Island.

The Rockaway Park Improvement Company complained in 1891 that the &quot;offensive&quot; smells from Barren Island were ruining the quality of life for vacationers in the Rockaways, located across the Rockaway Inlet from Barren Island. The New York State Health Board composed a report about the status of the industries on Barren Island. Subsequently, New York Governor David B. Hill declared four companies to be &quot;public nuisances&quot;, ordering twice-weekly inspections of their factories to ensure that the companies complied with health regulations.

==Garbage processing==

There had been a steep decline in the number of menhaden off Long Island by the late 1890s, which, combined with the Panic of 1893, resulted in the closure of the fish-oil plants. The carcass-dumping continued: in one five-day span in August 1896, records show that 1,256 horse carcasses had been processed. That year, the city government awarded the New York Sanitary Utilization Company a contract to operate on Barren Island, having unsuccessfully attempted to bury waste in Rikers Island. The company, which collected garbage from hotels around the city, operated a garbage incinerator that turned New York City&#x27;s waste into fertilizer, grease, and soap. Residents of nearby Brooklyn communities opposed the construction of the incinerator, without success. By 1897, the island was home to two garbage plants and four animal-processing plants. The same year, the town of Flatlands was subsumed into the City of Greater New York, becoming part of the city&#x27;s 32nd Ward.

Barren Island soon became known for its use as a garbage dump, receiving waste and animal carcasses from Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx. New York City&#x27;s other two boroughs, Queens and Staten Island, had their own garbage disposal sites. The Sanitary Utilization Company disposed of glass bottles and other non-processable items on the northern coast of Barren Island. Some valuable trash, such as jewelry, ended up on Barren Island. The island&#x27;s residents did not mind the smell of the processed garbage, but the incinerator&#x27;s scents were so noxious that residents of the rest of Brooklyn, away, could not stand the odors. In 1899, state and city lawmakers passed bills to reduce the stench, but these bills did not progress because the governor and mayor opposed these actions. The incinerator was damaged by fire in 1904, and two years later, another major fire caused in damage and burned down 16 buildings. The unstable land along the coast caused numerous landslides from 1890 to 1907, which damaged factories on the island.

By the 1900s, the island was receiving seven or eight garbage scows per day, which collectively delivered of trash. A boat of dead horses, cats, cows, and other animals arrived daily at the island. Workers at the horse processing factories were paid more than those at the garbage incinerator. As of the 1900 census, there were 520 Barren Island residents in 103 households, and all of the large &quot;households&quot; of male laborers had been dispersed. Around this time, there were four main landowners: the Sanitary Utilization Company, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, the government of Brooklyn, and the Products Manufacturing Company.

Barren Island served as a residential community for the families of laborers who worked there, and at its peak in the 1910s, it was home to an estimated 1,500 people. Most of these residents were either African-American laborers or immigrants from Italy, Ireland, or Poland, since few Americans were willing to work with the garbage-related industries; however, some farmers also resided on Barren Island. Despite the racial differences, the island&#x27;s residents coexisted relatively peacefully, as opposed to the high racial strife present elsewhere in the United States. The island had a public school, a church, a post office, a New York City Police Department precinct, hotels and inns, various stores and saloons, and three ferry routes to other Brooklyn neighborhoods. A &quot;Main Street&quot; stretched east–west across Barren Island, lined with buildings that faced south toward Rockaway Inlet. The street grid in the island&#x27;s central section was built haphazardly, based possibly on sand dune patterns. A caste system divided the different types of workers on the island: &quot;rag pickers&quot; were at the bottom of the hierarchy, followed by metal-and-paper scavengers, then bone sorters. The island&#x27;s African-American residents were considered to be part of the lowest caste. Students who lived on Barren Island were dismissed from school early so that they could help their parents scavenge. The island had no running water, sewage treatment, or New York City Fire Department stations. An 1897 article in the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; described pools of sewage around the school buildings and on the island&#x27;s main street, as well as accumulations of trash scattered haphazardly across the island, and noted that &quot;how any person manages to work on the island is a mystery&quot;.

Through the 1910s, as the odors became worse, more complaints were filed with the city government, and real estate developers in adjacent communities such as the Rockaways and Flatlands cajoled the city government to take action. Residents in nearby neighborhoods blamed their illnesses on the smells, and one group from Neponsit, Queens—located in the Rockaways—claimed that 750,000 residents in an radius were subject to the odors emanating from Barren Island. In 1916, New York City Mayor John Purroy Mitchel announced that a new garbage landfill would be built on Staten Island to replace the Barren Island landfill. Because of complaints from Staten Islanders, the location of the landfill was changed several times. The city government eventually decided to build the landfill in Fresh Kills, an isolated plain on Staten Island that was far away from the vast majority of Barren Island&#x27;s residents. It had overruled several injunctions and formal complaints from Staten Island residents who did not want a landfill anywhere in the borough. Politicians from the Democratic Party accused Mitchel, a member of the rival Republican Party, of corruption. Mayoral candidate John Hylan said that if he were elected in the upcoming year&#x27;s mayoral election, he would relocate the landfill off Staten Island. Hylan ultimately won the election against Mitchel, and he threatened to revoke the Fresh Kills landfill operator&#x27;s license. Hylan ultimately restored dumping operations at Barren Island, despite having denied rumors about the resumption of such operations. After political backlash, the city government started paying US$1,000 per day to the Sanitary Utilization Company to dispose of the city&#x27;s trash.

The city government started dumping its trash into the ocean in 1919, and the Sanitary Utilization Company closed its facility two years later. Additionally, the advent of automobile travel reduced horse-drawn travel in New York City, and resulted in fewer horse cadavers being processed on Barren Island. By 1918, the island processed 600 horse carcasses per year; it had once processed the same number of corpses in 12 days. The Thomas F. White Company closed the E. P. White fertilizer factory by around 1921 and started demolishing the Sanitary Utilization Company facility around the same time. The final horse processing plant closed in 1921. The last garbage processing plant on Barren Island, the Products Manufacturing Company, was transferred to city ownership in 1933, and operations ceased two years later.

==Seaport plans and decline of community==
In 1910, developers began dredging ports within Jamaica Bay in an effort to develop a seaport district. Although the city approved the construction of several piers in 1918, only one was built. That pier, which was built to receive landfill for the other proposed piers, stretched northeast and was wide.

By the 1920s, two factories and several residents remained on the island. A municipal ferry service to the Rockaway Peninsula and an extension of Flatbush Avenue were both opened in 1925. The new modes of transportation were part of a proposal to develop Barren Island as a seaport. The creeks along Barren Island&#x27;s coast were to be turned into canals, and the city had bought the western part of the island for use as parkland. The new transport options provided some short-term benefits for the remaining residents, who could go to &quot;mainland&quot; Brooklyn to work and shop. Residents of &quot;mainland&quot; Brooklyn could go to the Rockaway beaches by driving to the end of Barren Island and taking the ferry. Many of the buildings had been abandoned by 1928, though the public school and church remained. Three years later, the city took possession of on the western side of the island, which comprised much of Main Street and the structures on the island&#x27;s southwestern side. That plot was combined with a tract owned by Kings County to create a public space called Marine Park.

During the island community&#x27;s final years, a teacher named Jane F. Shaw (whom the press nicknamed the &quot;Angel of Barren Island&quot; and &quot;Lady Jane&quot;) was hired at the island&#x27;s public school. Shaw later became the principal and lobbied on behalf of the island, persuading Senator Robert F. Wagner to rename the island &quot;South Flatlands&quot; in order to integrate it with the city. After a census in 1930 neglected to count Barren Island, Shaw cajoled the United States Census Bureau into counting the island&#x27;s remaining 416 residents. When New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses ordered the eviction of all residents in early 1936, Shaw persuaded him to move the eviction date to the end of June, so her students could complete their school year.

==Airport and park use==
The pilot Paul Rizzo opened the privately-operated Barren Island Airport in 1927. The next year, the city&#x27;s aeronautic engineer Clarence Chamberlin chose Barren Island as the site for the city&#x27;s new municipal airport, which would become Floyd Bennett Field. The New York City Department of Docks was in charge of constructing the Barren Island Airport. A contract for the airport&#x27;s construction, awarded in May 1928, entailed filling in or leveling of soil across a parcel. Sand from Jamaica Bay was used to connect Barren Island and adjacent islands, as well as raise the site to above the high-tide mark. A subsequent contract involved filling in an extra of land. Floyd Bennett Field was formally completed in 1931, upon which about 400 people still lived on the island.

In 1935, the city acquired , including the entire island west of Flatbush Avenue, for Robert Moses&#x27;s expansion of Marine Park. Early the following year, Moses attempted to evict the remaining Barren Island residents, but they simply moved to a still-occupied portion of the island. At the time, twenty-five people lived on a spit at the southern end of the island. When the Marine Parkway Bridge to the Rockaways and Jacob Riis Park was completed in 1937, Flatbush Avenue was extended across Barren Island to connect with the bridge, and Barren Island was no longer isolated from the rest of the city.

Bennett Field was taken over by the United States Navy in 1941 and converted to Naval Air Station New York. The next year, the Navy expanded the airport&#x27;s facilities to the southern tip of Barren Island, forcing the former island&#x27;s last residents to move out. During its wartime upgrade of Bennett Field, the Navy burned and cleared all remaining structures on Barren Island, and eliminated its original landscape. No trace of the community remains, as Barren Island had been totally subsumed by Bennett Field. In 1972, Bennett Field was turned over to the National Park Service as part of the Gateway National Recreation Area&#x27;s Jamaica Bay Unit.

In the 1950s, Moses expanded the former island, by then a peninsula, to the west using garbage covered by topsoil. The layer of soil later eroded, and by the 2010s, garbage could be seen on the coast during low tide. The coast contains many exposed broken glass bottles and other non-biodegradable material, and as such, the site has been used for beachcombing. In August 2020, the National Park Service announced that Dead Horse Bay would be closed indefinitely because of the presence of radiological contamination. The contamination was identified as having come from two deck markers, though the risk of radiological exposure was considered low.

==Media==
Carol Zoref&#x27;s novel &quot;Barren Island&quot;, about an Eastern European immigrant family&#x27;s experiences on the island, was placed on the 2017 National Book Award for Fiction&#x27;s &quot;longlist&quot; and won the Association of Writers &amp; Writing Programs&#x27; 2015 Award Series as well as a National Jewish Book Award. In addition, in 2019, Miriam Sicherman published &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Barren Island: A Forgotten History&quot;, which described Barren Island&#x27;s history.

<text>Nighthawks at the Diner is the third studio album by singer and songwriter Tom Waits, released on October 21, 1975, on Asylum Records. It was recorded over four sessions in July in the Los Angeles Record Plant studio in front of a small invited audience set up to recreate the atmosphere of a jazz club. The album peaked at 164 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the highest place Waits had held at the time, and was certified silver by the BPI in 2010. It has received critical acclaim for its successful mood-setting, capturing of the jazz-club atmosphere and characterization.

==Background==
The title was inspired by Edward Hopper&#x27;s 1942 painting &quot;Nighthawks&quot;. The album&#x27;s working title had been &quot;Nighthawk Postcards from Easy Street,&quot; but was shortened to &quot;Nighthawks at the Diner&quot;, which is the opening line to &quot;Eggs and Sausage (In a Cadillac with Susan Michelson)&quot;. The cover, designed by Cal Schenkel, evokes the mood of the painting.

==Recording==
The album was recorded at Record Plant Los Angeles on July 30 and 31, 1975. Waits opens the album by calling the venue Raphael&#x27;s Silver Cloud Lounge. Bones Howe recalled:

Howe was mostly responsible for organizing the band for the &quot;live show&quot;, and creating the right atmosphere for the record.

Dewana was an old-time burlesque queen whom Tom had met on one of his jaunts to the Hollywood underworld. Jim Hughart, who played upright bass on the recordings recalled the experience of preparing for and recording the album:

&quot;Preparing for this thing, we had to memorize all this stuff, &#x27;cause Waits had nothing on paper. So ultimately, we spent four or five days in a rehearsal studio going over this stuff. And that was drudgery. But when we did actually get it all prepared and go and record, that was the fastest two days of recording I&#x27;ve ever spent in my life. It was so fun. Some of the tunes were not what you&#x27;d call jazz tunes, but for the most part that was like a jazz record. This was a jazz band. Bill Goodwin was a drummer who was associated with Phil Woods for years. Pete Christlieb is one of the best jazz tenor players who ever lived. And my old friend, Mike Melvoin, played piano. There&#x27;s a good reason why it was accepted as a jazz record.&quot;

During the track &quot;Nighthawk Postcards (From Easy Street)&quot;, Waits ad-libs lines from &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot;, a hit for Frank Sinatra.

==Reception==

&quot;Nighthawks at the Diner&quot; charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it peaked at 164. This was the highest position he had ever held at the time. His next album, &quot;Small Change&quot;, would be his highest charting with Asylum Records, with whom he would part company in 1981. &quot;Nighthawks&quot; is currently certified Silver by the BPI.

The album has been generally well received by critics, and is considered by some to be the best album of his early career. It is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In its accompanying chapter in the book, Peter Watts stated that &quot;although it could be dismissed as an entertaining conceit, the fake nightclub atmosphere of &quot;Nighthawks...&quot; possibly captures the appeal of early Waits even better than the two impressive albums that preceded it.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Mark Deming wrote: &quot;You could call it overdone, but then, this kind of material made its impact through an accumulation of miscellaneous detail, and who&#x27;s to say how much is too much?&quot;. He positively noted Waits&#x27; addition of comedy and acting into the set. On November 18, 2010, Rhapsody named it the album of the day, with staff writer Nate Cavalieri noting that &quot;Waits&#x27; meticulous persona is remarkable.&quot;

<text>Ōbaku Zen or the Ōbaku school () is one of three main schools of Japanese Zen Buddhism, in addition to the Sōtō and Rinzai schools. The school was founded in Japan by the Chinese monk Ingen Ryūki, who immigrated to Japan during the Manchu conquest of China in the 17th century.

It had a strong influence on Japanese Rinzai, which partly adopted Ōbaku practices, and partly reinstored older practices in response to the Ōbaku school.

==History==

The development of the Ōbaku-shū in Japan began somewhere around 1620, a period when Chinese emigrants were coming to Nagasaki due to a decree by the shogunate allowing Chinese traders to conduct business there. The Chinese traders, in turn, began to request that monks from China come to Nagasaki &quot;to serve the religious needs of their community and build monasteries in the late-Ming style with which they were familiar.&quot; The Chinese community was therefore thrilled when the founder of the Ōbaku, a master of the Linji school/sect named Yinyuan Longqi (J. &quot;Ingen Ryūki&quot;), arrived from China in Nagasaki in 1654 with a small group of his Chinese students. Furthermore, Yinyuan himself was happy to get away from China, which was then amidst a terrible war. Yinyuan was there with the explicit purpose of helping three underdeveloped temples founded by Chinese emigrants grow in the city. These Nagasaki temples were known as the three &quot;temples of good fortune,&quot; respectively Kōfuku-ji, Fukusai-ji and Sōfuku-ji. In time many Japanese heard of his teachings and traveled to Nagasaki to see him, while some came to join his community and become students. Having planned to stay in Japan for a short period of time, Yinyuan was persuaded by a group of his Japanese students to remain in Japan; this group secured him governmental permission to relocate to Kyoto, where his student Ryūkai Shōsen wished he would then become abbot of the Rinzai temple Myoshin-ji. Authorities within the Rinzai organization were not keen on this idea, due primarily to a disagreement within the congregation as to whether or not Yinyuan presented a take on Zen that was too distinctly Chinese for Japanese tastes. As a consequence, Yinyuan began construction of the modern day head temple of the Ōbaku known as Ōbaku-san Manpuku-ji in 1661 in Uji of Kyoto prefecture (Ōbaku-san being the mountain name). This marks the emergence of the Ōbaku school/sect of Zen Buddhism in Japan.

Construction was completed in 1669, the architecture done in the Chinese Ming dynasty style. By authorization of the local bakufu leaders (i.e. Tokugawa Tsunayoshi), the Ōbaku-shu emerged to help revitalize Rinzai practice in Japan. The practice at Manpuku-ji was different from that in other Rinzai temples and monasteries of Japan during this period, being much more Chinese in its approach. Yinyuan brought with him aspects of esoteric Buddhism and Pure Land Buddhism. As Heinrich Dumoulin puts it, &quot;For Zen practice in general, seated meditation and the practice of kōan are central, while cultic ceremony is of secondary importance. Insofar as the Ōbaku belonged to the Rinzai tradition, &quot;zazen&quot; and kōan practice were made part of daily life, but ritual was also accorded a place of considerable importance.&quot; Furthermore, Ōbaku monasteries and temples came to be governed by a doctrine known as &quot;Ōbaku shingi&quot;, which both imported Chinese practices such as the recitation (dharani) of nembutsu and &quot;sought to preserve the Chinese character of the group.&quot; The Ōbaku also chanted sutras derived from the Pure Land Buddhist sect set to Chinese music.

After Yinyuan&#x27;s retirement in 1664 and death in 1673, other monks who had come to Japan around the same time as he helped to carry on the tradition of practice at Manpuku-ji. The foremost of his disciples was Mokuan Shōtō, who became 2nd abbot of Manpuku-ji in 1664. During its formative years, Manpuku-ji was very popular in Japan with many adherents coming to the temple for instruction. According to the book &quot;Latter Days of the Law&quot;, &quot;For the next century, Manpuku-ji was headed by Chinese immigrant monks, and they sent their Japanese followers to found other temples. Ōbaku Zen quickly spread through the country.&quot; At least one abbot of Manpuku-ji during this period of early Ōbaku history proved to be controversial. His name was Tu-chan Hsing-jung (Dokutan Shōtei), and he served as 4th abbot of Manpuku-ji. Critics charge that he took his emphasis on nembutsu recitation at Manpuku-ji too far, and he is today derisively nicknamed &quot;Nembutsu Dokutan&quot;.

Perhaps the most important Ōbaku practitioner besides Yinyuan Longqi was Tetsugen Dōkō, a Japanese man who lived from 1630 to 1682. Tetsugen is remembered for having transcribed the entire Ming period Chinese Tripitaka to woodblocks—known as the &quot;Tetsugen-ban&quot; or &quot;Ōbaku-ban&quot; (&quot;ban&quot; meaning edition). Raised as part of the Jōdo Shinshū of Japan, Tetsugen first met Yinyuan in 1655 at Kōfuku-ji in Nagasaki and eventually came to join the Ōbaku. The first Japanese abbot of Manpuku-ji assumed leadership of the Ōbaku in 1740, a man by the name of Ryūtō Gentō. From 1786 on through to the modern-day, the Ōbaku has been run and controlled by exclusively Japanese leadership.

Today Manpuku-ji serves as the Ōbaku&#x27;s head temple, with 420 subtemples spread throughout Japan as of 2006.

==Characteristics and influence==

===Monastic practice===
Monastic practices of the Ōbaku-shū were once largely informed by the &quot;Ōbaku shingi&quot; (or, &quot;Ōbaku codes&quot;), composed in 1672 with ten sections outlining the practice regimen at Manpuku-ji. Steven Heine writes that, &quot;The text reflected a few evolutionary changes that had taken place in Chinese monasteries since the Yuan, but it was squarely in the tradition of classical rules of purity such as the &quot;Chanyuan qingui&quot; and &quot;Chixiu baizhang qingqui&quot;.&quot; The Rinzai branch Myōshin-ji authored their own set of monastic regulations (penned by Mujaku Dōchū) in response to this later in 1685. To be sure, Myoshinji was worried about losing students to the Ōbaku, who were growing in popularity. The Ōbaku&#x27;s &quot;emphasis on the precepts and the strict observance of monastic regulations embodied in &quot;Ōbaku shingi&quot; seem to have stimulated and encouraged certain Japanese masters of similar bent. In the Sōtō sect, for example, the Chinese teachers influenced the monastic codes of reformers like Gesshū Sōko and Manzan Dōhaku who had studied under Ōbaku masters.&quot;

Historically, the Ōbaku-shū has sometimes been referred to as &quot;Nembutsu Zen&quot;—a derogatory characterization intended to describe their use of &quot;Zen and Pure Land practices.&quot; The Ōbaku-shū emphasized the taking of various precepts and also observed the Vinaya of the Dharmaguptaka tradition as well as sutra translation. But perhaps most obvious to the Japanese was their use of &quot;nembutsu&quot; and also their use of the &quot;nembutsu kōan&quot; which entailed the practice of reciting the name of Amitabha while holding in one&#x27;s mind the kōan, &quot;Who is reciting?&quot; While foreign to the Japanese (despite this &quot;dual practice&quot; being introduced in Japan as early as the late 13th century), this was very common in Ming period Ch&#x27;an, where there was no sectarian divide between Pure Land Buddhists and Ch&#x27;an practitioners. 

===Convergence with Rinzai-Zen===
Heine and Wright note that:
As a result of their approach, which caused a stir in Japan, many Rinzai and Sōtō masters undertook reforming and revitalizing their own monastic institutions, such as Rinzai master Ungo Kiyō who even began implementing the use of &quot;nembutsu&quot; into his training regimen at Zuigan-ji. T. Griffith Foulk writes:
Rooted in the lineage (school) of Linji, and therefore sharing a familial relationship with the Rinzai-shū of Japan, the Ōbaku&#x27;s approach to practice is today tinged with a hint of Chinese influence. Helen J. Baroni writes that today, &quot;With a few notable exceptions, such as the style of sutra chanting (which continues to be done in an approximation of Fujian dialect), Ōbaku temples and monasteries appear very like their Rinzai neighbors.&quot; Statistically the smallest school/sect of Zen in modern-day Japan, the Ōbaku is also like the Rinzai-shū in that it is known to be more conservative and intellectually inclined than the Sōtō-shū.

Ōbaku abbots are now all from the Ōtōkan lineage, the same as Rinzai, and thus practices are largely similar, though this was not the case originally. Specifically, starting under the leadership of chief abbot Ryochu Nyoryu 良忠如隆 (1793–1868), Zen practice largely became the same as Rinzai practice, but monastic and cultural differences remain. Additionally, Buddhist sutras in the Ōbaku-shū continue today to be chanted in Tō-on.

=== Culture ===
In addition to their contribution to Zen in Japan, the Ōbaku also &quot;disseminated many aspects of Ming-period culture&quot; in the country. Many of the monks who came from China were accomplished calligraphers, and Obaku&#x27;s founder Yinyuan Longqi and two other Ōbaku masters, Mokuan Shōtō and Sokuhi Nyoitsu, became known as the Ōbaku no Sanpitsu (or, the &quot;Three Brushes of Ōbaku&quot;). Author Steven Heine writes, &quot;Areas where the influence of — or the reaction to — Ōbaku left an imprint on Japanese Buddhism is manifold, and its impact even reached the fields of Japanese cultural techniques, such as printing and painting. Chinese medicine and architecture were also introduced, as was the practice of &quot;spirit writing&quot;, the latter practiced by Ōbaku monks who were said to communicate with Chen Tuan.

The Ōbaku school is also well known for its style of vegetarian cooking known as , its version of Buddhist cuisine (in Japan known as ). This is similar to usual &quot;shōjin ryōri,&quot; but with more Chinese influence. It was introduced by Yinyuan and his group, and served at the main temple of Manpuku-ji, along with various subtemples such as Kanga-an.

The Ōbaku school also introduced Ming dynasty tea culture to Japan, including the steeping of loose-leaf teas (sencha) rather than the powdered matcha used in chanoyu. Ōbaku monks and intellectuals such as Baisao opposed the rigid, elaborate formalism of chanoyu and promoted a carefree, informal approach inspired by ancient Chinese sages. This would later produce a new type of tea ceremony called senchado, and sencha would eventually become the most popular form of tea consumed in Japan.

==Notable temples==

===Head temple===
*Manpuku-ji – Construction began in 1661 and concluded in 1669. Located in Kyoto, Manpuku-ji serves as the head temple of the Ōbaku school. It provides a &quot;rare example&quot; of a temple built in a purely Chinese Ming period architectural style in Japan.

===Subtemples===
*Fukusai-ji – Founded in 1628 in Nagasaki and later destroyed in 1945, Fukusai-ji has since been reconstructed in the shape of a turtle with an 18-metre high aluminum alloy statue of Kannon, the Bodhisattva of compassion. The interior is famous for the 25-metre Foucault Pendulum which swings over the remains of 16,500 Japanese killed during World War II.
*Fukugon-ji (Yanagawa)
*Fukuju-ji (Kitakyushu)
*Kōfuku-ji (Nagasaki)
*Ryūshin-ji

<doc id="586170" wikidata="Q4992254" url="?curid=586170" title="Grammy Award for Best Music Film">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Music Film is an annual accolade for performers, directors, and producers of quality videos or musical programs. It is presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony established in 1958 when it was called the Gramophone Awards. 

==Criteria==
Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;. In order to qualify for this category, concert/performance films or music documentaries must be released theatrically or for sale to the public for the first time or first appearing on television or online during the current eligibility year. Dramatic feature films and biopics are not eligible.

Prior to 2024, films were only considered eligible for this category if they featured a minimum of 51% performance-based material. As of the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, this requirement has been removed entirely.

==Background==
The category was preceded by the Grammy Award for Video of the Year, which was presented in 1982 and 1983, awarding long form videos (or video albums as they were known back then) in the budding music video market. Along with the similar honor Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, this award was first presented in 1984. From 1984 to 1985, the accolade was known as Best Video Album, but in 1986, it was renamed to Best Music Video, Long Form. From 1998 to 2012, it was named Best Long Form Music Video, before changing to Best Music Film since 2013.

In 1988 and 1989, the award criteria were changed and the video accolades were presented under the categories Best Concept Music Video and Best Performance Music Video. The awards were returned to the original format in 1990. Except in 1988 and 1989, the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video recipients included the artists, directors, and producers associated with the winning videos. The Best Music Film category is one of two categories in the Best Music Video/Film Field. The other one is Best Music Video, which recognizes stand-alone videos of one song or performance. In 2024, the Field was abolished and both categories were moved to a Children&#x27;s, Comedy, Audio Book Narration &amp; Storytelling, Visual Media &amp; Music Video/Film Field.

==Multiple wins and nominations==
Singers Madonna and Sting hold the record for the most wins as a performer in this category, with two each, while there have been three films about the Beatles among the winners. However, in two instances, the Beatles were not recognized as individual winners. To date, three directors won the award twice: David Mallet, Jonas Akerlund and Bob Smeaton. Beyoncé holds the record for the most nominations with five. The British pop rock group Eurythmics and Coldplay hold the record for the most nominations as a performer without a win, with three each. Although Beyoncé also held four losing nominations, she won with her fourth nomination with &quot;Homecoming&quot; in 2020.

==Recipients==
In 1984 and 1985, only the artists were presented with an award. In 1986 the award went to the artist(s) and the video director(s). From 1987 onwards, the award has been presented to the artist(s), video director(s) and video producer(s). (Nominations from 1984 to 1986 listed performing artists only).

<doc id="586172" wikidata="Q5539381" url="?curid=586172" title="George Foster (baseball)">
<text>George Arthur Foster (born December 1, 1948) is an American former professional baseball player and scout. He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder from through , most notably as an integral member of the Cincinnati Reds, with whom he won two World Series championships, in and . He also played for the San Francisco Giants, New York Mets and the Chicago White Sox.

A five-time All-Star, Foster was one of the most feared right-handed sluggers of his era, leading the National League in home runs twice (1977 and 1978), and in RBI three times (1976, 1977, and 1978). He won the National League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award in 1977 and a Silver Slugger Award in 1981. In 2003, Foster was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.

==San Francisco Giants==
Born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Foster attended Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, California. After just a single year at El Camino College, Foster was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the third round (55th overall) of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft. After two seasons in their farm system, he debuted with the Giants at the age of 20 on September 10, . He went 2-for-5 with one run batted in (RBI) as a pinch hitter and late inning defensive replacement. That year on September 22, Willie Mays pinch hit for Foster and hit his 600th career home run.

Foster returned to the Giants in September of the following year, hitting his first career home run off the San Diego Padres&#x27; Pat Dobson. He finally made an opening day roster in as a fourth outfielder behind Mays, Bobby Bonds and Ken Henderson, but shortly after the season started, Foster was traded to the Cincinnati Reds shortstop Frank Duffy and pitcher Vern Geishert on May 29.

==Cincinnati Reds==
Foster was immediately inserted into the starting line-up in center field, as starting center fielder Bobby Tolan was lost for the season with a torn Achilles tendon. In 104 games with the Reds, he batted .234 with 10 home runs and 50 RBI. He returned to a back-up role in , platooning in right field with César Gerónimo, and managed just a .200 batting average, two home runs and 12 RBI in 59 games. The nucleus of the &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; began coming together that season, however, and the Reds returned to the post-season playoffs after a disappointing fourth-place finish in 1971. Foster played in the 1972 National League Championship Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates only as a pinch runner for Tony Pérez in Game 5 of the series; he scored the series-winning run on a wild pitch from Bob Moose. Foster appeared in Games 1 and 7 of the World Series against the Oakland Athletics, but did not log an at bat.

Foster spent the majority of the season with the Reds&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians, batting .262 with 15 home runs and 60 RBI in 134 games. and made a September return to the majors when the minor league season ended. He batted .282 with four home runs and 9 RBI in 17 games. He was not part of the Reds&#x27; post-season roster. Tolan had suffered through a poor 1973 season in which he batted just .206, and was traded that winter to the San Diego Padres for pitcher Clay Kirby. Foster, Merv Rettenmund and rookie Ken Griffey all took turns filling the hole the trade created in right field in , with Foster batting .264 with seven home runs and 41 RBI in 106 games.

===The &quot;Big Red Machine&quot;===
Early in the season, Reds manager Sparky Anderson shifted perennial All-Star Pete Rose to third base, and used a platoon of Foster and Dan Driessen in left field. Foster soon won the everyday job with a .300 batting average, 23 home runs and 78 RBI in 134 games. With Foster now in left, the final piece of the &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; was in place. The Reds won 108 games that year, tying the World Series champion Baltimore Orioles for the most regular season wins that decade. They dominated the Pirates in the 1975 National League Championship Series, out-scoring their opponent 19–7 to sweep the series in three games. For his part, Foster batted .364 and scored three runs.

The Boston Red Sox proved a far tougher opponent in the World Series, as the Reds needed seven games to win their first World Series title since . Foster went 2-for-6 and drove in two runs in the classic Game 6 of the World Series at Fenway Park. His most memorable moment was on the field. The game was tied, and with the bases loaded and no outs in the ninth inning, reigning MVP and Rookie of the Year Fred Lynn lifted a ball down the left field line. Foster made the catch near the stands for the first out of the inning. Denny Doyle tagged up on the play, and was out at home on a strong throw from Foster. Rico Petrocelli grounded out to Rose at third for the final out and sent the game to extra innings.

Anderson moved Foster into the clean-up spot in his batting order during a 17-game hitting streak in June when Foster&#x27;s batting average peaked at .343. With 17 home runs and 71 RBI at the All-Star break, he was elected to start his first All-Star Game. He turned in an MVP performance with a two-run home run and third RBI to pace his team to a 7–1 victory over the American League All-Stars. He ended the season batting .306 with 29 home runs and a major league-leading 121 RBI in 144 games. After the season, Foster finished second, behind only teammate Joe Morgan, in National League MVP balloting. Rose and Griffey also finished within the top ten.

The Reds won the National League West by 10 games over the Los Angeles Dodgers. They became the only team to go undefeated in post-season history since the establishment of the Divisional Era in 1969 when they swept the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1976 National League Championship Series and New York Yankees in the World Series. For his part, Foster batted just .167 in the NLCS, but hit key home runs in Games 1 and 3. His average jumped to .429 in the World Series, while driving in four.

===National League MVP===

Foster turned in one of the all-time great seasons in on his way to winning the National League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award. On July 14, Foster clubbed three home runs against the Atlanta Braves. A home run the following day off the Houston Astros&#x27; Gene Pentz brought his season mark to 29 heading into the All-Star break. He started his second consecutive All-Star game, and led the NL charge with a first inning double to drive in Dave Parker with the first run of the game. On September 23, in the ninth inning of the Reds&#x27; 5–1 victory over the Atlanta Braves, Foster hit his fiftieth home run of the season off Buzz Capra, making him the first player since Willie Mays in to hit fifty in a season. The 50 home run mark would not be reached again until Cecil Fielder hit 51 home runs in 1990. Foster was just the 10th player in major league history to reach the mark, and the first ever Cincinnati Reds player. In 158 games, he batted .320 with 52 home runs and 149 RBI, leading the majors in the latter two categories. He finished fourth in the NL in batting, missing the Triple Crown by .018 behind Dave Parker. He also led the NL in slugging percentage (.631), runs scored (124) and total bases (388).

Foster picked up where he left off in , with 18 home runs and 63 RBI in the first half of the season to earn his third consecutive All-Star start. For the season, he played in 158 games and batted .281 while pacing the NL in both home runs and RBIs with 40 and 120, respectively. He was voted onto his fourth consecutive All-Star team in , but needed to be pulled in the second inning after pulling his thigh. The Reds lost Foster for a month, and had been decimated by injuries, but managed to stay in the NL West race during Foster&#x27;s absence. Shortly after his return, the Reds went on an eight-game winning streak that saw them jump into first place by 1.5 games over the Houston Astros. The Reds held off the Astros to win their first division crown since 1976, but were swept by the Pirates in the 1979 National League Championship Series. Foster&#x27;s highlight was a game tying home run in Game 1 of the NLCS.

Following the 1979 season, Joe Morgan headed to the Houston Astros via free agency. With Tony Pérez and Pete Rose already gone, the &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; was beginning to come apart, and the Reds slumped to a third-place finish in . Foster hit .273, and led the club with 25 home runs and 93 RBI in 144 games. A rejuvenated Reds team won a major league best 66 games in the strike shortened season, but managed to miss the playoffs as a result of the split-season format used that season. Foster returned to form, finishing second to Mike Schmidt in the NL&#x27;s RBI race. At this point in his career, when it looked like he would one day rank among the game&#x27;s all-time greats, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;.

==New York Mets==
With one year remaining on his contract, Foster was seeking a new five-year deal with the Reds. Unwilling to meet his contract demands, the Reds traded him to the New York Mets for Greg Harris, Jim Kern and Alex Treviño on February 10, . The next day, Foster agreed with the club on a five-year, $10 million contract.

Whereas the Reds were at or near the top of their division Foster&#x27;s entire time in Cincinnati, the Mets were consistent cellar dwellers in the National League East when Foster joined his new club. The franchise was hoping for a turn around with Foster in tow, but it was not to be, as all of Foster&#x27;s power numbers declined. He hit just .247 with 13 home runs and 70 RBI in 151 games, the lowest numbers he&#x27;d put up since 1974.

The Mets acquired Keith Hernandez and brought up rookie prospect Darryl Strawberry during the season. Given more protection in the line-up, Foster rebounded with a team-best 28 home runs and 90 RBI. When the Mets became a contending team in , Foster batted .269 with 24 home runs and 86 RBI in 146 games.

The season came down to the wire between the Mets and St. Louis Cardinals. On September 10, with the two teams tied atop the NL East, an incident between Foster and Cardinals pitcher Danny Cox caused both benches to clear. The race remained tight, but the Cardinals pulled off a three-game lead as the Mets headed to Busch Stadium for a three-game set on October 1. The first game was a pitchers&#x27; duel between Ron Darling and John Tudor that the Mets won in extra innings. With the Mets now just two games back, 20 game winners Dwight Gooden and Joaquín Andújar faced off in the second game.
With the Mets leading 1–0, Foster led off the second inning by legging out an infield single. Three batters later, he scored the second run of the game on a fielder&#x27;s choice by Gooden. In the seventh, he drove the first pitch from Andújar to deep center field to give the Mets a 4–1 lead. Foster went 3-for-4 to lead the Mets to a 5–2 victory, and pull to within one game of the division lead. The Mets would, however, lose the following day, and the Cardinals went on to win the division.

===Last year in baseball===
Foster was 37 years old and in the final year of his contract when the season began. Although he had been respectable for several years, he had not fully lived up to the expectations that were set for him by the Mets and his age was starting to become a factor as well. He put up respectable power numbers (13 home runs and 38 RBIs), but had a .237 batting average, and had lost considerable range in left field. Meanwhile, the Mets manager Davey Johnson was looking for an everyday position for utilityman Kevin Mitchell. When the Mets headed to Cincinnati for a three-game series on July 21, Foster sat out the series, making just one pinch hit appearance in the second game of the set.

This game was highlighted by a bench-clearing brawl that was ignited when the Reds&#x27; Eric Davis stole third base in the tenth inning. After a hard tag by Mets third baseman Ray Knight, the two men exchanged words, leading to Knight&#x27;s punching Davis in the face. Both benches emptied with the exception of Foster. Foster said that he stayed out of the ruckus because it set a bad example for children. After the series in Cincinnati, the manager Johnson officially announced Mitchell as the everyday left fielder.

Despite Johnson&#x27;s reasoning that Foster&#x27;s lack of performance warranted the benching, Foster complained that his demotion was racially motivated, with &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Mike Downey criticizing him for making that statement considering that Mitchell, who replaced Foster, was black (like Foster). In addition, Met teammates Wally Backman and Mookie Wilson have since said that Foster&#x27;s non-combative personality was a bad fit for the team. He made just 14 plate appearances after that point, walking once, getting one single, and striking out six times. On August 7, the Mets released Foster and replaced him on their major league roster with Lee Mazzilli.

On August 18, Foster signed a contract with the Chicago White Sox, and hit the ground running with his new club. In his first game, he went 2-for-4 with a home run. From there, his game declined, and Foster was released on September 7 after 15 games with his new club. When the Mets won the World Series in , they awarded Foster a World Series ring (the third of his career) and a three-quarters share as a team member for part of the season. He attempted to sign with a new club in , but was unsuccessful.

==Career statistics==
In 1,977 games over 18 seasons, Foster compiled a .274 batting average (1,925-for-7,023) with 986 runs, 307 doubles, 47 triples, 348 home runs, 1,239 runs batted in (RBI), 666 walks, 1,419 strikeouts, a .338 on-base percentage and a .480 slugging percentage. He posted a .984 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions. In 23 post-season games (three appearances in the World Series, four appearances in the NLCS), he hit .289 (22-for-76) with 11 runs, two doubles, three home runs, 12 runs batted in and eight walks.

==Senior Professional Baseball Association==
Afterwards, Foster played from 1989 to 1990 in the Senior Professional Baseball Association. In his first season, he hit .269 with 11 home runs and 52 RBI in 70 games for the St. Lucie Legends. In 1990, he joined the St. Petersburg Pelicans and batted .273 in three games for the club before the league folded during the midseason.

In February 2010, Foster was hired as a scout advisor for the Orix Buffaloes of Nippon Professional Baseball.

==Personal life==
He has two daughters, Shawna and Starr.

Foster began a baseball online radio show, &quot;The George Foster Diamond Report&quot;, in which he speaks about how the development and strength of an athlete can build a strong foundation. Foster spends time instructing youth in baseball techniques, and also works as a motivational speaker. He operates a non-profit organization that supports children of military families and who live in inner city neighborhoods. He also sponsors baseball boot camps for children as well as a Cincinnati select baseball team, Foster&#x27;s Force.

Foster was on the National Baseball Hall of Fame ballot for four years, having his highest total of 6.9% in 1993 before being dropped off after garnering 4.1% of the vote in 1995. He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in , He was a celebrity participant in the Cincinnati Reds/Findlay Market Opening Day Parade and he frequently returns to Cincinnati for the annual Redsfest and other reunion events. He was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.
