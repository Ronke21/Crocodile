<text>In political science, rollback is the strategy of forcing a change in the major policies of a state, usually by replacing its ruling regime. It contrasts with containment, which means preventing the expansion of that state; and with détente, which means developing a working relationship with that state. Most of the discussions of rollback in the scholarly literature deal with United States foreign policy toward communist countries during the Cold War. The rollback strategy was tried and was not successful in Korea in 1950 and in Cuba in 1961, but it was successful in Grenada in 1983. The United States discussed the use of rollback during the East German uprising of 1953 and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, which were ultimately crushed by the Soviet Army, but decided against it to avoid the risk of a major war.

Rollback of governments hostile to the U.S. took place during World War II (against Fascist Italy in 1943, Nazi Germany in 1945, and Imperial Japan in 1945), Afghanistan (against the Taliban in 2001, though this would fail in the long term with the Taliban returning to power in 2021), and Iraq (against Saddam Hussein in 2003). When directed against an established government, rollback is sometimes called &quot;regime change&quot;.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;rollback&quot; was popularized in the 1940s and the 1950s, but the term is much older. Some Britons, opposed to Russian oppression against Poland, proposed in 1835 a coalition that would be &quot;united to roll back into its congenial steppes and deserts the tide of Russian barbarism.&quot; Scottish novelist and military historian John Buchan in 1915 wrote of the American Indian Wars, &quot;I cast back to my memory of the tales of Indian war, and could not believe but that the white man, if warned and armed, would rollback [sic] the Cherokees.&quot; More recently, John Mearsheimer was significant in popularizing the term.

==World War II==
Rollback includes military operations designed to destroy an enemy&#x27;s armed forces and occupy its country, as was done in World War II to Italy, Germany, and Japan.

==Cold War==
The notion of military rollback against the Soviet Union was proposed by strategist James Burnham and other strategists in the late 1940s, and by the Truman Administration against North Korea in the Korean War. Much debated was the question whether the U.S. should pursue a rollback strategy against Soviet-occupier satellite states in Eastern Europe in 1953–1956, which the United States ultimately decided against.

Instead of overt military rollback, the United States focused primarily on long-term psychological warfare and military or clandestine assistance to delegitimize Soviet-dominated communist regimes and help insurgents. These attempts began as early as 1945 in the Soviet Bloc, including efforts to provide weapons to independence fighters in the Baltic states and Ukraine. Another early effort was against Albania in 1949, following the defeat of communist forces in the Greek Civil War that year. The operation had already been betrayed to the Soviets by the British double agent Kim Philby, and led to the immediate capture or killing of the agents.

===Harry Truman===
In the Korean War, the United States and the United Nations officially endorsed a policy of rollback—the protection of South Korea against an invading army of the communist North Korean government—and sent UN forces across the 38th parallel.

===Dwight Eisenhower===
After the 1952 presidential election, Republican spokesman John Foster Dulles took the lead in promoting a rollback policy. The 1952 Republican Party&#x27;s national platform reaffirmed this position, and Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Dulles as Secretary of State. However, Eisenhower ultimately adopted containment instead of rollback in October 1953 through National Security Council document NSC 162/2, effectively abandoning rollback efforts in Europe.

Eisenhower instead relied on clandestine CIA actions to undermine hostile small governments and used economic and military foreign aid to strengthen governments supporting the American position in the Cold War. In August 1953, the United States, in collaboration with the British SIS, conducted Operation Ajax to assist the Iranian military in the restoration of the Shah. Eisenhower adviser Charles Douglas Jackson also coordinated psychological warfare against the Soviet Bloc and the USSR itself. Radio Free Europe, a private agency funded by Congress, broadcast criticisms of communist regimes directed at Soviet satellite states in the Eastern Bloc.

In 1956, Eisenhower decided not to intervene during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, which was subsequently brutally put down by the Soviet Army. The Suez Crisis, which unfolded simultaneously, played an important role in hampering the U.S. response to the crisis in Hungary. The Suez Crisis made the condemnation of Soviet actions difficult. As Vice President Richard Nixon later explained: &quot;We couldn&#x27;t, on one hand, complain about the Soviets intervening in Hungary and, on the other hand, approve of the British and the French picking that particular time to intervene against Gamal Abdel Nasser.&quot;

===Ronald Reagan===
The &quot;rollback&quot; movement gained significant ground in the United States in the 1980s. The Reagan administration, urged on by The Heritage Foundation and other influential conservatives, began to channel weapons to movements such as the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, UNITA in Angola, and the Contras in Nicaragua. The United States launched the successful invasion of Grenada in 1983 to protect American residents and reinstate constitutional government following a coup by what Reagan called &quot;a brutal gang of leftist thugs.&quot; Reagan&#x27;s interventions came to be known as the Reagan Doctrine.

Critics argued that the Reagan Doctrine led to so-called blowback and an unnecessary intensification of Third World conflict. On the other hand, the Soviet Union eventually had to abandon its invasion of Afghanistan. Jessica Martin writes, &quot;Insofar as rollback is concerned, American support for rebels, especially in Afghanistan, at the time helped to drain Soviet coffers and tax its human resources, contributing to that nation&#x27;s overall crisis and eventual disintegration.&quot;

=== George H. W. Bush ===
After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990, a coalition of Western militaries deployed to protect Kuwait and Saudi Arabia from Ba&#x27;athist Iraq. While the Persian Gulf War successfully freed Kuwait, many military leaders and American politicians called for a full invasion of Iraq to replace Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and effectively roll back his regime. However, President Bush ultimately decided against a full invasion of Iraq.

Between 1988 and 1991, the fifteen Soviet republics gradually declared their laws superior to those of the Soviet Union, and the USSR ceased to exist on December 26, 1991.

==War on Terror==

=== George W. Bush ===

Following the September 11 attacks, his administration, along with a NATO coalition, undertook a war in Afghanistan to remove the Taliban government, which it believe had harbored al-Qaeda, the group responsible for the attacks. Bush told Congress:
:The Taliban must act and act immediately. They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate.
While the initial invasion succeeded in removing the Taliban from state power, after twenty years of a US military presence which was extremely unpopular both in Afghanistan and the US and was met with a Taliban insurgency, the Donald Trump and later Joe Biden administrations withdrew all US troops from Afghanistan, and in 2021 the Taliban returned to power.

Similarly, Bush opposed the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, labeling the regime as part of an &quot;axis of evil&quot;, which also included Iran and North Korea. Additionally, the administration falsely claimed to believe Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. As a result, in March 2003, the U.S. military invaded Iraq and overthrew Hussein&#x27;s regime.

<doc id="591517" wikidata="Q430037" url="?curid=591517" title="Peter van de Kamp">
<text>Piet van de Kamp (December 26, 1901 – May 18, 1995), known as Peter van de Kamp in the United States, was a Dutch astronomer who lived in the United States most of his life. He was professor of astronomy at Swarthmore College and director of the college&#x27;s Sproul Observatory from 1937 until 1972. He specialized in astrometry, studying parallax and proper motions of stars. He came to public attention in the 1960s when he announced that Barnard&#x27;s star had a planetary system based on observed &quot;wobbles&quot; in its motion, but this is now known to be false.
On November 14, 2018, the Red Dots project announced that Barnard&#x27;s star hosts an exoplanet at least 3.2 times as massive as Earth, though this does not match either of the planets he had claimed. In 2021, even this planet&#x27;s existence was questioned.

==Life==
Van de Kamp was the son of Lubbertus van de Kamp, who had an administrative job at a cigar factory, and Engelina C.A. van der Wal. His younger brother Jacob van de Kamp was also a successful scientist: an organic chemist, who spent most of his career in the United States. Van de Kamp studied at the University of Utrecht and started his professional career at the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in Groningen working with Pieter Johannes van Rhijn. In 1923 he left for the Leander McCormick Observatory at the University of Virginia for a year&#x27;s residence supported by the Draper Fund of the National Academy of Sciences. There he assisted Samuel Alfred Mitchell with his extensive stellar parallax program and Harold Alden with the lengthy Boss star project.

The following year Van de Kamp went to the Lick Observatory in California as a Kellogg fellow. There he received his PhD from the University of California in Astronomy in June 1925. The next year he also received a PhD from the University of Groningen. Van de Kamp returned to McCormick on October 1, 1925, to take up the position left vacant by Harold Alden, who had just taken up the directorship of the Yale University Observatory Southern Station in Johannesburg, South Africa. In the spring of 1937, Van de Kamp left McCormick Observatory to take over as director of Swarthmore College&#x27;s Sproul Observatory. One of his early pupils in astrometry was Nancy Grace Roman, who went on to become NASA&#x27;s first Chief of Astronomy.

His work consisted of assisting with the parallax program and continuing the proper motion work that he and Alden had begun. Van de Kamp and Alexander N. Vyssotsky spent eight years measuring 18,000 proper motions. He did additional, smaller projects individually, including an investigation for general and selective absorption of light within the Milky Way.

==Barnard&#x27;s Star affair==

While at Sproul Observatory, he made astrometric measurements of Barnard&#x27;s Star and in the 1960s reported a periodic &quot;wobble&quot; in its motion, apparently due to planetary companions. It was not until several decades had passed that a consensus had formed that this had been a spurious detection. In 1973 astronomers George Gatewood of the Allegheny Observatory and Heinrich Eichhorn of the University of Florida, using data obtained with improved equipment on the 30-inch Thaw Refractor telescope, did not detect any planets but instead detected a change in the color-dependent image scale of the images obtained from the 24-inch refractor telescope at the Sproul Observatory used by Van de Kamp in his study. Astronomer John L. Hershey found that this anomaly apparently occurred after each time the objective lens was removed, cleaned, and replaced. Hundreds more stars showed &quot;wobbles&quot; like Barnard&#x27;s Star&#x27;s when photographs before and after cleaning were compared – a virtual impossibility. Wulff Heintz, Van de Kamp&#x27;s successor at Swarthmore and an expert on double stars, questioned his findings and began publishing criticisms from 1976 onwards; the two are reported to have become estranged because of this. Van de Kamp never admitted that his claim was in error and continued to publish papers about a planetary system around Barnard&#x27;s Star into the 1980s, while modern radial velocity curves place a limit on the planets much smaller than claimed by Van de Kamp. A study in 2018 suggested that there was a planet orbiting Barnard&#x27;s Star (Barnard&#x27;s Star b), albeit of much lower mass than Van de Kamp could have detected; however, the existence of this planet too was questioned in 2021.

In August 2024, by using data from ESPRESSO spectrograph of the Very Large Telescope, the existence of an exoplanet with a minimum mass of and orbital period of 3.15 days was confirmed. This constituted the first convincing evidence for a planet orbiting Barnard&#x27;s Star. Additionally, three other candidate low-mass planets were proposed in this study. All of these planets orbit closer to the star than the habitable zone. However, the indicated masses of the planets are again far below those capable of detection by Van de Kamp. 

From the 1940s on Van de Kamp and his staff made similar claims of planetary systems around the nearby stars Lalande 21185, 61 Cygni, and many others, based on the same flawed photographic plates. All of these claims have been refuted. However, with the recent discoveries of numerous planetary systems, the idea that planetary systems are common—of which throughout his life Van de Kamp was a strong promoter—is being gradually proven correct.

==Music==
Van de Kamp was a talented musician, playing piano, viola, and violin, only forgoing a musical career in his youth because he considered this more difficult to achieve than a career in astronomy. He helped to organize an orchestra in Charlottesville, which he conducted and included fellow astronomer Alexander Vyssotsky. He also composed music for orchestra as well as for piano. From 1944 to 1954 he was conductor of the Swarthmore College Symphony Orchestra. He combined his musical gifts with another hobby, movies, by playing silent films on Swarthmore campus and accompanying them on the piano. At Swarthmore Van de Kamp performed with Peter Schickele, and made several films of Schickele&#x27;s student performance, while on the occasion of his 70th birthday Schickele wrote a piano piece for him called &quot;The Easy Goin&#x27; P. v. d. K. Ever Lovin&#x27; Rag&quot;. Van de Kamp said that his fondest musical memory was playing chamber music with Albert Einstein, on the evening before the latter&#x27;s commencement address at Swarthmore College in 1938.

==Later life and death==
In 1972 he retired from Swarthmore and returned to the Netherlands, where he became Fulbright Professor to the University of Amsterdam. He died in suburban Amsterdam May 18, 1995, at the age of 93.

==Awards and honors==
In 1965 he was awarded the Rittenhouse Medal by the Rittenhouse Astronomical Society.
In 1982 he was awarded the Prix Jules Janssen by the Société Astronomique de France. In 2009 a new observatory at Swarthmore College was named for him. Asteroid 1965 van de Kamp is named after him.

<text>Economists use the term representative agent to refer to the typical decision-maker of a certain type (for example, the typical consumer, or the typical firm).

More technically, an economic model is said to have a representative agent if all agents of the same type are identical. Also, economists sometimes say a model has a representative agent when agents differ, but act in such a way that the sum of their choices is mathematically equivalent to the decision of one individual or many identical individuals. This occurs, for example, when preferences are Gorman aggregable. A model that contains many different agents whose choices cannot be aggregated in this way is called a [[heterogeneous agent model]].

The notion of the representative agent can be traced back to the late 19th century. Francis Edgeworth (1881) used the term &quot;representative particular&quot;, while Alfred Marshall (1890) introduced a &quot;representative firm&quot; in his &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;. However, after Robert Lucas, Jr.&#x27;s critique of econometric policy evaluation spurred the development of microfoundations for macroeconomics, the notion of the representative agent became more prominent and more controversial. Many macroeconomic models today are characterized by an explicitly stated optimization problem of the representative agent, which may be either a consumer or a producer (or, frequently, both types of representative agents are present). The derived individual demand or supply curves are then used as the corresponding aggregate demand or supply curves. Since it has been shown that the commonly used demand functions do not aggregate to representative agents, the implications of representative agents models need not, and are unlikely to, hold for individual consumers. 

==Motivation==
When economists study a representative agent, this is because it is usually simpler to consider a single &#x27;typical&#x27; decision maker instead of simultaneously analyzing many different decisions. Of course, economists must abandon the representative agent assumption when differences between individuals are central to the question at hand. For example, a macroeconomist might analyze the impact of a rise of oil prices on a typical &#x27;representative&#x27; consumer; but some analyses of auctions involve heterogeneous agent models because competing potential buyers can value the good differently.

Hartley (1997) discusses the reasons for the prominence of representative agent modelling in contemporary macroeconomics. The Lucas critique (1976) pointed out that policy recommendations based on observed past macroeconomic relationships may neglect subsequent behavioral changes by economic agents, which, when added up, would change the macroeconomic relationships themselves. He argued that this problem would be avoided in models that explicitly described the decision-making situation of the individual agent. In such a model, an economist could analyze a policy change by recalculating the decision problem of each agent under the new policy, then aggregating these decisions to calculate the macroeconomic effects of the change.

Lucas&#x27; influential argument convinced many macroeconomists to build microfounded models of this kind. However, this was technically more difficult than earlier modelling strategies. Therefore, almost all the earliest general equilibrium macroeconomic models were simplified by assuming that consumers and/or firms could be described as a representative agent. General equilibrium models with many heterogeneous agents are much more complex, and are therefore still a relatively new field of economic research.

==Critique==
Hartley, however, finds these reasons for representative agent modelling unconvincing. Kirman too, is critical of the representative agent approach in economics. Because representative agent models simply ignore valid aggregation concerns, they sometimes commit the so-called fallacy of composition. He provides an example in which the representative agent disagrees with all individuals in the economy. Policy recommendations to improve the welfare of the representative agent would be illegitimate in this case. Kirman concludes that the reduction of a group of heterogeneous agents to a representative agent is not just an analytical convenience, but it is &quot;&quot;both unjustified and leads to conclusions which are usually misleading and often wrong.&quot; In his view, the representative agent &quot;deserves a decent burial, as an approach to economic analysis that is not only primitive, but fundamentally erroneous.&quot;&quot;

A possible alternative to the representative agent approach to economics could be agent-based simulation models which are capable of dealing with many heterogeneous agents. Another alternative is to construct dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models with heterogeneous agents, which is difficult, but is becoming more common (Ríos-Rull, 1995; Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante 2009; Canova 2007 section 2.1.2).

Chang, Kim, and Schorfheide (2011) make a point similar to that of Kirman, in the context of a DSGE model where agents are heterogeneous because of uninsured labor income risk. They estimate a representative-agent DSGE model on the basis of the aggregate data implied by their heterogeneous-agent economy, and show that the estimated coefficients are inconsistent with the true parameters of the heterogeneous economy. They point out that

Jackson and Yariv (2017) prove that representative agents for commonly used utility functions do not exist, and thereby typical macroeconomic models are not actually micro-founded.

<text>Judson Taylor (February 25, 1932August 6, 2008) was an American actor, television director, and television producer.

==Early years==
Born in New York City, Taylor graduated from the University of California, Berkeley.

==Career==
Taylor is perhaps best known for his directorial work on 1960s television shows such as &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;. In the early 2000s, he directed several episodes of &quot;Law and Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. Taylor also directed more than 40 made-for-TV movies, including the award-winning &quot;Tail Gunner Joe&quot; and &quot;Foxfire&quot;, and the final film appearances of both Susan Hayward in &quot;Say Goodbye, Maggie Cole&quot; (1972) and David Janssen in &quot;City in Fear&quot; (1980).

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, before becoming an established director, Taylor worked as an actor. He had a recurring role on &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; as &quot;Dr. Gerson&quot;. He appeared in several episodes of &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; playing different characters. Other TV programs in which he had small roles included &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Men of Annapolis&quot;, and &quot;Wagon Train&quot;. He also played the part of Goff, one of three Americans, in the feature film &quot;The Great Escape&quot; and subsequently directed a made-for-TV sequel to the film titled &quot;The Great Escape II: The Untold Story&quot; (1988) starring Christopher Reeve. Two years later, he directed a television miniseries based on Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; (1990 miniseries) starring Anthony Quinn in the role originally portrayed by Spencer Tracy in the earlier theatrical version.

Taylor was vice president of the Directors Guild of America from 1977 to 1981 and president from 1981 to 1983.

He died in New York City in 2008, following a long illness.

<doc id="591527" wikidata="Q7146615" url="?curid=591527" title="Patrick Guerriero">
<text>Patrick Guerriero (born March 3, 1968) is a former Massachusetts state legislator, mayor, and advocate for marriage equality. In 2002, after serving as then-Governor Jane Swift&#x27;s deputy chief of staff, Guerriero became the nation&#x27;s first openly gay candidate for lieutenant governor when he was chosen by Swift to be her running mate.

Guerriero entered politics when he served as president of the Liberty Education Forum and Log Cabin Republicans from January 1, 2003 to September 1, 2006. From 1993 to 2001, Guerriero won five consecutive elections.

==Early life==
Guerriero was born to an Italian immigrant, mason father and a social worker mother. He worked his way through college, spending summers mixing cement and hauling bricks for his family&#x27;s masonry business. Guerriero attended The Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, where he played soccer and graduated Summa cum laude in 1990. The next year, Guerriero attended Boston College&#x27;s Thomas P. O&#x27;Neill Jr. Fellowship in American Government Program. After college, Guerriero moved to Melrose to manage the successful mayoral campaign of Richard Lyons.

==Political career==

===State representative===
In 1993, Guerriero was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives (35th Middlesex District). He went on to twice win re-election. In the House his legislative committee assignments included, Ways and Means, Ethics, Insurance, Health and Human Services, and Long-Term Debt and Capital Expenditures. He supported initiatives related to lower taxes, limited government expenditure, improved public schools, public safety, and welfare reform. Guerriero was a staunch supporter of the 1993 Education Reform Act that required students to pass standardized graduation tests (MCAS). He was also an advocate for gay and lesbian issues, effecting strict anti-hate crimes legislation and increased AIDS awareness funding.

Guerriero was awarded the John F. Kennedy Library&#x27;s Fenn Award for politicians 35 years of age and younger on November 10, 1998.

===Mayor of Melrose, Massachusetts===
In 1998, Guerriero was elected mayor of the city of Melrose, Massachusetts. He served two consecutive terms, and received more than 80% of the vote in both elections. As during his tenure, Moody&#x27;s Investors Service upgraded the city&#x27;s bond rating. During his tenure as mayor, Guerriero created a &quot;Civility Initiative&quot; which encouraged residents to show each other respect and courtesy. For this project he received the City Livability Award at the U.S. Mayor&#x27;s Association 2000 City Livability Awards. In 2001, the Massachusetts Council of Human Service Providers named Guerriero the municipal official of the year.

Guerriero stepped down in May 2001 to accept the position of deputy chief of staff with acting Governor Jane Swift&#x27;s administration.

===Deputy Chief of Staff for the Governor of Massachusetts===
In May 2001, Guerriero accepted the position of deputy chief of staff to acting Massachusetts Governor Jane Swift. On January 3, 2002, Swift named Guerriero her running mate. In March, Swift announced that while she was pulling out of the race for Governor, she openly supported Guerriero&#x27;s continued run as Lieutenant Governor on the Republican ticket.

==Advocacy==
Guerriero is an advocate for LGBT equality, having appeared on major television programs such as &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, and &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;. He has written op-eds for publications including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The Denver Post&quot; and has been profiled in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;The L.A. Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The Advocate&quot;. Guerriero is the recipient of the U.S. Mayor&#x27;s Association 2000 City Livability Award for his nationally-recognized &quot;Civility Initiative&quot; and the 1998 Fenn Award for Political Leadership from the John F. Kennedy Library&#x27;s New Frontier Society.

=== Log Cabin Republicans ===

On January 1, 2003, Guerriero succeeded Rich Tafel as the leader of the Log Cabin Republicans. While at Log Cabin, he praised the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court&#x27;s 2003 decision in the case of &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot; as a conservative ruling supporting stable families, relationships, and society, limited government, individual liberty, and religious freedom. In early 2004, Patrick gained national recognition for successfully challenging President George W. Bush - launching the first national television ad that helped defeat Bush&#x27;s proposed Federal Marriage Amendment. In October 2004, Patrick filed &quot;Log Cabin Republicans v. United States&quot; challenging the constitutionality of the &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; policy. It was not until the White House came under Democratic control, however, that any significant legislative progress toward the repeal of the policy was made. U.S. President Barack Obama signed the legislation repealing &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; in December 2010.

In 2013, Guerriero was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.

===The Gill Action Fund===
On September 1, 2006, Guerriero became the first executive director of the Gill Action Fund, an organization working to advance gay and lesbian equality through the legislative, political, and electoral process. During his tenure, Guerriero oversaw a national network of donors contributing more than $15 million to political campaigns and organizations in dozens of states with the aim of electing equal-rights politicians and advancing or blocking legislation. In 2006, of the 68 campaigns supported by Gill Action, 56 were successful. Gill Action under Guerriero also advocated for passage of state laws on nondiscrimination and relationship recognition in 13 states.

Guerriero served as executive director until June 30, 2011.

=== Civitas Public Affairs Group ===
Guerriero is a founding partner of Civitas Public Affairs Group, a Washington, D.C.–based government affairs firm. Civitas Public Affairs Group provides bipartisan government relations, issue-based donor-giving strategies, and public-policy campaign management to individuals, non-profits, and corporations.

<text>Nazareth are a Scottish hard rock band formed in Dunfermline in 1968 that had many hit singles and albums in Canada, the United Kingdom, and a number of other European countries beginning in the early 1970s. The breadth of their popularity expanded internationally, including in the United States, with their 1975 album &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot;, which featured their hits &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; and a cover of the ballad &quot;Love Hurts&quot;. They have continued to record and tour internationally for more than 50 years.

== Career ==

Nazareth formed in December 1968 in Dunfermline, Scotland, from the remaining members of semi-professional local group the Shadettes (formed in 1961) by vocalist Dan McCafferty, guitarist Manny Charlton, bassist Pete Agnew, and drummer Darrell Sweet. They were inspired by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Nazareth took their name from Nazareth, Pennsylvania, which is cited in the first line of the Band&#x27;s classic song &quot;The Weight&quot; (&quot;I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin&#x27; about half past dead...&quot;).

The band moved to London, England in 1970 and released their self titled debut album in 1971. After getting some attention with their second album &quot;Exercises,&quot; released in 1972, Nazareth supported Deep Purple on tour, and issued the Roger Glover-produced &quot;Razamanaz&quot;, in early 1973. This collection spawned two UK Top Ten hits, &quot;Broken Down Angel&quot; and &quot;Bad Bad Boy&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Loud &#x27;N&#x27; Proud&quot; in late 1973, which contained another hit with a cover of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s song &quot;This Flight Tonight&quot;. Then came another album &quot;Rampant,&quot; in 1974, that was equally successful although its only single, &quot;Shanghai&#x27;d in Shanghai&quot;, narrowly missed the British Top 40. The non-album cover of Tomorrow&#x27;s &quot;My White Bicycle&quot; ( a song inspired by Dutch Provos, an anarchist group in Amsterdam) was a UK Top 20 entry in 1975.

&quot;Hair of the Dog&quot;, released in April 1975, was produced by Manny Charlton, ending Roger Glover&#x27;s association with the band. The title track – popularly, though incorrectly, known as &quot;Son of a Bitch&quot; due to its hook lyric – became a staple of 1970s rock radio. The American version of the album included a song originally recorded by the Everly Brothers: the melodic Boudleaux Bryant-penned ballad &quot;Love Hurts&quot;. This became a hit in the UK and in the US, where it went platinum. The track became the band&#x27;s only US Top Ten hit and was also a top 10 hit in nine other countries, reaching number 1 in six of them. The song was on the Norwegian chart for 60 weeks.

In 1979, second guitarist Zal Cleminson (previously of The Sensational Alex Harvey Band) was added to the line-up, remaining for two albums, &quot;No Mean City&quot; and &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot;, and contributing numerous compositions. &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot; contained the single &quot;Holiday&quot;. In 1981, they contributed the song &quot;Crazy (A Suitable Case for Treatment)&quot; to the soundtrack to the film, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;.

Various Nazareth line-ups continued to make studio albums and tour throughout the 1980s and 1990s, although their popularity had declined such that some albums no longer received either a UK or a US release. They remained popular in Europe, particularly Germany, where &quot;Dream On&quot; became a hit single. In 1991, Billy Rankin returned to replace Manny Charlton on the &quot;No Jive&quot; album, remaining with the band until 1994.

A tribute came in 1993 when Guns N&#x27; Roses covered Nazareth&#x27;s &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; on &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot;; consolation after they turned down Axl Rose&#x27;s request for the group to play at his wedding. &quot;Axl really made me more aware of Nazareth…&quot; recalled GNR guitarist Slash, &quot;because he can sing like that McCafferty guy, and really dug his voice. And so I remember listening to Nazareth a lot at one point.&quot;

Rankin departed again in 1994, but with Jimmy Murrison and keyboard player Ronnie Leahy, Nazareth maintained a live following in Europe and the US.

Nazareth continued touring after Rankin&#x27;s departure, with Jimmy Murrison and keyboard player Ronnie Leahy. While on tour in 1999, original drummer Darrell Sweet died at age 51 of a heart attack. He was replaced by bassist Pete Agnew&#x27;s son Lee for later editions of the band.

On 4 August 2006, John Locke, the former keyboardist of the band, died from cancer at the age of 62.

In February 2008, &quot;The Newz&quot; was released on the Hamburg-based label, Edel Entertainment. The release of the album coincided with Nazareth&#x27;s fortieth anniversary tour, which started on 25 January in Sweden and visited most of Europe, finished on 4 November 2008 in Norway. A follow-up album, &quot;Big Dogz&quot;, was released on 15 April 2011.

Nazareth announced McCafferty&#x27;s retirement from the band due to ill health on 28 August 2013, leaving Pete Agnew as the last remaining original member of the band. On 22 February 2014, it was announced that Scottish singer Linton Osborne was chosen as McCafferty&#x27;s replacement, with the former singer&#x27;s blessing. In December 2014, Nazareth announced the cancellation of several shows, and later postponement of their UK tour, due to Osborne contracting a virus that left him unable to perform. In a post on his Facebook page 16 January 2015, Osborne announced his departure from the band.

On 13 February 2015, the band announced that Carl Sentance, formerly of Persian Risk, Geezer Butler Band, and Krokus, was their new lead vocalist.

In October 2018, the album &quot;Tattooed on My Brain&quot;, was released via Frontiers Records. &#x27;The 50th Anniversary Tour&#x27; followed, spanning 2018 and 2019, along with German hard rock band Formosa as support. Original guitarist Manny Charlton died on 5 July 2022, aged 80.

On 8 November 2022, Dan McCafferty died at the age of 76, thus leaving bassist Pete Agnew as the last surviving original member.

<text>The medium egret (Ardea intermedia), median egret, smaller egret or intermediate egret, is a medium-sized heron. Some taxonomists put the species in the genus &quot;Egretta&quot; or &quot;Mesophoyx&quot;. It is a resident breeder in southern and eastern Asia.

==Taxonomy==
Some authorities classify the intermediate egret species complex in its own monotypic genus, &quot;Mesophoyx&quot;, while others place it with the smaller egrets in &quot;Egretta&quot;.

There were three recognised subspecies, and these are sometimes raised in to species:

* &quot;A. i. brachyrhyncha&quot; &quot;yellow-billed egret&quot; - sub-Saharan Africa
* &quot;A.i. intermedia&quot; &quot;intermediate egret&quot; - Asia from the Russian Far East to Japan to India and the Greater Sundas
* &quot;A. i. plumifera&quot; &quot;plumed egret&quot; - eastern Indonesia, New Guinea and Australia.

&quot;A.(i.) intermedia&quot; differs from &quot;A.(i.) brachyrhyncha&quot; and &quot;A. (i.) plumifera&quot; by having a black bill when in breeding plumage, while &quot;A.(i.) plumifera&quot; has a yellow-and-pink bill and &quot;A. (i.) brachyrhyncha&quot; has much yellower lores and face. A further difference between this species and the &quot;yellow-billed&quot; species is that the intermediate egret has black at the top of the legs compared to reddish in the yellow-billed egret.

The split of intermediate egret into 3 species was accepted by the IOC on 26 September 2023, this form was given the common name medium egret by the IOC.

==Description==
The medium egret, as its scientific name implies, is intermediate in size between the great egret and smaller white egrets like the little egret and cattle egret, though nearer to little than great. It is about long with a wingspan and weighs c. , with all-white plumage, generally dark legs and a thickish yellow bill. Breeding birds may have a reddish or black bill, greenish yellow gape skin, loose filamentous plumes on their breast and back, and dull yellow or pink on their upper legs (regional variations). The sexes are similar.

===Differences from other egrets===

The medium egret has non-breeding colours which are similar to other white egrets, but the intermediate is smaller, with neck length a little less than body length, a slightly domed head, and a shorter, thicker bill. The great egret has a noticeable kink near the middle of its neck, and the top of its longer bill nearly aligns with the flat top of its head. Close up, great egret&#x27;s gape line extends behind the eye, while the intermediate&#x27;s is less pointed and ends below the eye. The intermediate tends to stalk upright with neck extended forward. The great is more patient, often adopting a sideways-leaning &quot;one-eyed&quot; stance.
Little egrets have yellow-soled feet and black bills. They often run after fish in shallow water. Breeding birds have long nuptial plumes on the back of their heads.

==Behaviour==
The medium egret stalks its prey methodically in shallow coastal or fresh water, including flooded fields. It eats fish, frogs, crustaceans and insects. It often nests in colonies with other herons, usually on platforms of sticks in trees or shrubs. The typical clutch size is 2 or 3 eggs but there can be as many as 6 eggs in a clutch, the colour of the eggs is pale green, with a smooth, slightly pitted shell. Both parents incubate the eggs and they hatch after between 24 and 27 days. The eggs hatch asynchronously, after hatching the adults brood the semialtricial young for 12 days, defending the nests from aerial predators during both incubation and brooding, they crouch over the nest and raise their plumes and point their bill towards the threat. The parents regurgitate the food to feed the young, initially onto the floor of the nest but later the chick takes the food from the parent&#x27;s mouth. There may be competition for food within the brood. Pinfeathers may appear on the chicks as early as 4 days old and the young are able to leave the nest at 24 days old, although they return to be fed. Fledging occurs at around 40 days old and they leave the colony after 70 days. In Africa and Australia they are reported to be quite successful breeders with 96% and 88% of nests fledging at least a single chick. Intermediate egret populations are more successful in wet years than in dry years.

<text>was a Japanese aerospace manufacturer which produced several designs for the Imperial Japanese Navy. After the war, the company was reorganized as Aichi Machine Industry Co., Ltd (愛知機械工業) where they made small &quot;kei&quot; cars until 1966 when they were integrated into Nissan and developed the Nissan Sunny and Nissan Vanette.

==History==
===Aichi Watch and Electric Manufacturing===
The company was established in 1898 in Nagoya as Aichi Tokei Denki Seizo Kabushiki Kaisha (Aichi Watch and Electric Manufacturing Co., Ltd.). Aircraft production started in 1920, and the company relied initially on technical assistance from Heinkel, which influenced some of their designs. Later, with the prodding and support of the Imperial Japanese Navy, the company started making seaplanes using technology imported from Short Brothers in the UK.

During the inter-war period, Aichi was the beneficiary of technology transferred from Heinkel of Germany. At the time, a team from the League of Nations occasionally visited German aircraft manufacturers to monitor the ban on military aircraft research and production. A Japanese military attache who was a member of the monitoring team, let Heinkel know, confidentially and in advance, of the planned visits. Heinkel thus succeeded in continuing its design on the aircraft ordered by Aichi Aircraft without being spotted.

In 1943 the aircraft division was spun off as Aichi Kokuki Kabushiki Kaisha (Aichi Aircraft Co., Ltd.).

===Aichi Machine Industry===
After the war, the company was reorganized, manufacturing &quot;kei&quot; cars under the Cony brand name in Japan. Its current descendant, Aichi Kikai Kōgyō Kabushiki Kaisha (Aichi Machine Industry Co., Ltd.), is integrated with the Nissan corporate structure.

<doc id="591540" wikidata="Q618045" url="?curid=591540" title="Margate">
<text>Margate is a seaside town in the Thanet District of Kent, England. It is located on the north coast of Kent and covers an area of long, north-east of Canterbury and includes Cliftonville, Garlinge, Palm Bay and Westbrook. In 2011 it had a population of 61,223.

The town has been a significant maritime port since the Middle Ages, and was associated with Dover as part of the Cinque Ports in the 15th century. It became a popular place for holidaymakers in the 18th century, owing to easy access via the Thames, and later with the arrival of the railways. Popular landmarks include the sandy beaches and the Dreamland amusement park. During the late 20th century, the town went into decline along with other British seaside resorts, but attempts are being made to revitalise the economy.

==History==

Margate was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as lying within the hundred of Thanet and the county of Kent.

Margate was recorded as &quot;Meregate&quot; in 1264 and as &quot;Margate&quot; in 1299, but the spelling continued to vary into modern times. The name is thought to refer to a pool gate or gap in a cliff where pools of water are found, often allowing swimmers to jump in. The cliffs of the Isle of Thanet are composed of chalk, a fossil-bearing rock.

Margate gives its name to the relatively unknown yet influential Battle of Margate, starting on 24 March 1387, it was the last major naval battle of the Caroline War phase of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Despite the battle being named after Margate, very little actually happened near the coastal town - the battle is named after Margate as this was where an English fleet of 51 vessels that was anchored at Margate Roadstead first spotted a Franco-Castilian-Flemish wine fleet of around 250-360 vessels. The English gave chase after the undermanned wine fleet and finally defeated the fleet a day later on 25 March 1387 off the coast of Cadzand, Zeeland, Netherlands.

The town&#x27;s history is tied closely to the sea and it has a proud maritime tradition. Margate was a &quot;limb&quot; of Dover in the ancient confederation of the Cinque ports. It was added to the confederation in the 15th century. Margate has been a leading seaside resort for at least 250 years. Like its neighbour Ramsgate, it has been a traditional holiday destination for Londoners drawn to its sandy beaches. Margate had a Victorian jetty which was largely destroyed by a storm in 1978.

In the late 18th century, the town was chosen by the physician John Coakley Lettsom as the place in which he would build the Royal Sea Bathing Hospital, which was the first of its kind in Britain.

Like Brighton and Southend, Margate was infamous for gang violence between mods and rockers in the 1960s, and mods and skinheads in the 1980s.

The Turner Contemporary art gallery occupies a prominent position next to the harbour, and was constructed there with the specific aim of revitalising the town. The Thanet Offshore Wind Project, completed in 2010, is visible from the seafront.

==Governance==
Margate is an unparished area with charter trustees. In 2021 there was a proposal to convert the unparished area into a civil parish and replace the charter trustees with a town council.

Since 2024, the Member of Parliament for East Thanet has been the Labour MP, Polly Billington. 

Margate was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1857. This was abolished in 1974, since which date Margate has been part of the Thanet district of Kent. The town contains the seven electoral wards of Margate Central, Cliftonville West, Cliftonville East (from 1974 to 2003 the ward of Cliftonville), Westbrook, Garlinge, Dane Valley and Salmestone. These wards have seventeen of the fifty six seats on the Thanet District Council. At the 2007 Local Elections, nine of those seats were held by the Conservatives, seven by Labour and one by an Independent.

==Climate==
Margate experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) similar to much of the United Kingdom. Like almost all of southern Britain, Margate experiences mild temperatures, and is complemented by a high amount of sunshine; a nickname for the town is &quot;Sunny Margate&quot;. Rainfall is quite low, making Margate one of the driest towns in Kent.

==Demography==

At the 2001 UK census:

Margate had a population of 40,386. The urban area had a population of 46,980 at the 2001 census, increasing to 49,709 at the 2011 census (5.8% increase).

Trains from the station generally run to Victoria, via , and to London St Pancras, via Ramsgate, Canterbury West and Ashford International on the High Speed 1 line. Peak hour trains run to St Pancras, via Chatham and Gravesend, and to . The station, and all trains that serve it, are operated by Southeastern.

Most bus services in Margate are operated by Stagecoach South East; with routes linking the town with Canterbury, Herne Bay and Ramsgate and many more. Frequent Loop buses, ensure that travel around the isle is easy. These services leave every 5-7 minutes (day times) from Cecil Square, in both directions; towards Cliftonville and towards Westwood Cross. 

A National Express route, which operates between London Victoria and Ramsgate, calls at Margate seafront, Northdown Park and Cliftonville.

==Tourism==

For at least 250 years, Margate has been a leading seaside resort in the UK, drawing Londoners to its beaches, Margate Sands. The bathing machines in use at Margate were described in 1805 as;

four-wheeled carriages, covered with canvas, and having at one end of them an umbrella of the same materials which is let down to the surface of the water, so that the bather descending from the machine by a few steps is concealed from the public view, whereby the most refined female is enabled to enjoy the advantages of the sea with the strictest delicacy.

The Dreamland Amusement Park is situated in the centre of Margate, operating since 1920, it was closed in 2006, and reopened in 2015 following a lengthy campaign by the &quot;Save Dreamland Campaign&quot; group. Its Scenic Railway roller coaster is the second oldest of its type in the world, and is now Grade II* Listed. It is one of only two early-20th century scenic railways still remaining in the UK; the only other surviving UK scenic railway is in Great Yarmouth and was built in 1932. The Margate roller coaster is an ACE Coaster Classic. 

Cliftonville, next to Margate, had a classic British Arnold Palmer seaside mini golf course. It closed and was illegally converted to a skate park, which was later shut down by the council amid Safety Concerns.
There are two notable theatres, the &quot;Theatre Royal&quot; in Addington Street – the second oldest theatre in the country – and the &quot;Tom Thumb Theatre&quot;, the second smallest in the country, in addition to the Winter Gardens. The Theatre Royal was built in 1787, burned down in 1829 and was remodelled in 1879 giving Margate more national publicity. The exterior is largely from the 19th century. At this current time, both Theatre Royal and Winter Gardens are closed. Theatre Royal closed on 28th April 2022, with the Winter Gardens following suit on 14th August 2022. 

An annual jazz festival takes place on a weekend in June.

In September, an annual car show commences known as &quot;Oh So Retro&quot; featuring classic and retro vehicles, trade stalls and family-friendly entertainment.

Margate Museum in Market Place explores the town&#x27;s seaside heritage in a range of exhibits and displays, and is now opened at weekends by a team of volunteers.

First discovered in 1798, the Margate Caves (also known as the Vortigern Caves) are situated at the bottom of Northdown Road. They reopened in 2019.

The Shell Grotto, which has walls and roof covered in elaborate decorations of over four million shells covering in complex patterns, was rediscovered in 1835, but is of unknown age and origin. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building.

The Walpole Bay Tidal Pool is a Grade 2 listed tidal sea bathing pool built in 1937. The pool covers over four acres and its dimensions are 450 ft long, 300 ft wide at the seaward end and 550 ft long at the landward end. The water in the pool is refreshed by the incoming tide twice a day and fresh water springs rise from the beach within the walls.

==Regeneration==
The former chairman of the Margate Civic Society, John Crofts, had a plan to develop a centre that would explore and show the link that the painter J. M. W. Turner shared with Margate. Turner described the Thanet skies as the &quot;loveliest in all Europe.&quot; In 1994 Crofts became increasingly determined to create such a gallery and in 1998 the Leader of Kent County Council met a number of people from the art world to discuss the idea. They hoped that the centre would regenerate the once-thriving town of Margate and offer an alternative to Margate&#x27;s traditional tourist trade. In the late 1990s, the County Council offered to fund the building of the Turner Gallery. Additional funding was contributed by the Arts Council England and South East England Development Agency. In 2001 the Turner Contemporary was officially established. The view from the gallery is similar to that seen by Turner from his lodging house.

To reduce the cost, Thanet District Council chose a new site inland from the harbour wall. The scheme was supported by the artist Tracey Emin, who was brought up in Margate. The building itself was designed by David Chipperfield Architects after the abandonment of the design by Snøhetta + Spence architects. Building work started in 2008 but the project&#x27;s initiator, John Crofts, died in 2009. The Turner Contemporary Gallery officially opened on 16 April 2011.

Across the road from the gallery in Margate Old Town there is a community of independent shops. Accessed from the seafront via Market Street, Duke Street and King Street this area is clustered around the old Margate Town Hall in the centre of the Market Place. There is also a small museum in the town hall complex which provides information about the history of Margate. In 2012 Margate was chosen as one of the towns to benefit from the Portas Pilot Scheme aimed at regenerating some of Britain&#x27;s high streets.

New businesses started flocking to Margate in the late 2010s. “There’s been a whole bunch of businesses opening up ... Cliffs ... which is a sort of multipurpose space. Coffee, food, yoga, a record store. It does everything,” Dom Bridges of skincare brand Haeckels, told New Statesman in 2017, adding that many were cropping up in Cliftonville, where locals wouldn&#x27;t buy.

==Historic sites==

There is a 16th-century, two-storey timber-framed Tudor house built on a flint plinth in King Street.

Margate&#x27;s Jubilee Clock Tower was built to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 1887, although not completed until 1889. It had a Time Ball mechanism, mounted on a mast atop the tower, which was raised a few minutes before 1pm each day and dropped at precisely 1pm, thereby allowing residents, visitors and ships to know the exact time. This was, of course, in the days before wireless transmission of time signals. The tower was Grade II listed in 1973. The Time Ball fell out of use many years ago, but following a suggestion by Arnold Schwartzman OBE RDI, a former Margate resident, Margate Civic Society raised funds to have the time ball repaired and brought back into use. This was successful, and a civic ceremony celebrated the restoration on 24 May 2014, Queen Victoria&#x27;s birthday and the 125th anniversary of the Clock Tower&#x27;s official opening. This was short lived though and unfortunately, the time ball stopped working again with the pole it is affixed to having been left unrepaired. More recently it has been left leaning at a very precarious 75-degree angle. 

Draper&#x27;s Mill is a smock mill built in 1845 by John Holman. It was working by wind until 1916 and by engine until the late 1930s. It was saved from demolition and is now restored and open to the public.

<text>Corvée () is a form of unpaid forced labour that is intermittent in nature, lasting for limited periods of time, typically only a certain number of days&#x27; work each year. Statute labour is a corvée imposed by a state for the purposes of public works. As such it represents a form of levy (taxation). Unlike other forms of levy, such as a tithe, a corvée does not require the population to have land, crops or cash.

The obligation for tenant farmers to perform corvée work for landlords on private landed estates was widespread throughout history before the Industrial Revolution. The term is most typically used in reference to medieval and early modern Europe, where work was often expected by a feudal landowner of their vassals, or by a monarch of their subjects.

The application of the term is not limited to feudal Europe; corvée has also existed in modern and ancient Egypt, ancient Sumer, ancient Rome, China, Japan, the Incan civilization, Haiti under Henry I and under American occupation (1915–1934), and Portugal&#x27;s African colonies until the mid-1960s. Forms of statute labour officially existed until the early 20th century in Canada and the United States.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;corvée&quot; has its origins in Rome, and reached English via French. In the later Roman Empire the citizens performed in lieu of paying taxes; often it consisted of road and bridge work. Roman landlords could also demand a certain number of days&#x27; labour from their tenants, and from freedmen; in the latter case the work was called . In medieval Europe, the tasks that serfs or villeins were required to perform on a yearly basis for their lords were called . Plowing and harvesting were principal activities to which this applied. In times of need, the lord could demand additional work called (). This term evolved into , then , and finally &quot;corvée&quot;, and the meaning broadened to encompass both the regular and exceptional tasks. The word survives in modern usage, meaning any kind of inevitable or disagreeable chore.

== History ==
=== Egypt ===

From the Egyptian Old Kingdom (, the 4th Dynasty) onward, corvée contributed to government projects. During the times of the Nile River floods, it was used for construction projects such as pyramids, temples, quarries, canals, roads, and other works.

The 1350 BC Amarna letters, mostly addressed to the pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, have one short letter on the topic of corvée. Of the 382 Amarna letters, there is an undamaged letter from Biridiya of Megiddo entitled &quot;Furnishing corvée workers&quot;.

Later, during the Ptolemaic dynasty, Ptolemy V in his Rosetta Stone Decree of 196 BC listed 22 accomplishments to be honored and ten rewards granted to him for the former. One of the shorter accomplishments, near the middle of the list, is:

The statement implies it was a common practice.

Until the late 19th century, many of the Egyptian Public Works, including the Suez Canal, were built using corvée. Legally, the practice ended in Egypt after 1882, when the British Empire took control of the country and opposed forced labour on principle, but its abolition was postponed until Egypt had paid off its foreign debts. During the 19th century corvée had expanded into a national program. It was favoured for short-term projects such as building irrigation works and dams. However, Nile Delta landowners replaced it with cheap temporary labour recruited from Upper Egypt. As a result, it was used only in scattered locales, and even then there was peasant resistance. It began to disappear as Egypt modernized after 1860, and had fully vanished by the 1890s.

=== Europe ===
Medieval agricultural corvée was not entirely unpaid. By custom the workers could expect small payments, often in the form of food and drink consumed on the spot. Corvée sometimes included military conscription, and the term is also occasionally used in a slightly divergent sense to mean forced requisition of military supplies; this most often took the form of &quot;cartage&quot;, a lord&#x27;s right to demand wagons for military transport.

Because agricultural corvée tended to be demanded by the lord at the same time that the peasants needed to tend their own plotse.g. at planting and harvestit was an object of serious resentment. By the 16th century its use in agricultural settings was on the decline and it became increasingly replaced by paid labour. It nevertheless persisted in many areas of Europe until the French Revolution and beyond.

==== Austria, the Holy Roman Empire, and Germany ====
Corvée, specifically socage, was essential to the feudal system of the Habsburg monarchy and later Austrian Empire, and most German states that belonged to the Holy Roman Empire. Farmers and peasants were obliged to do hard agricultural work for their nobility, typically six months of the year. When a cash economy became established, the duty was gradually replaced by the duty to pay taxes.

After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the demand for corvée grew too high and the system became dysfunctional. Its official decline is linked to the abolition of serfdom by Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor and Habsburg ruler, in 1781. It continued to exist however, and was only abolished during the revolutions of 1848, along with the legal inequality between the nobility and common people.

Bohemia (or the Czech lands) was a part of the Holy Roman Empire as well as the Habsburg monarchy, and corvée was called in Czech. In Russian and other Slavic languages denotes any kind of work, but in Czech it specifically refers to unpaid unfree work, corvée or serf labour, or drudgery. The Czech word was imported to part of Germany where corvée was known as , and into Hungarian as . The word was later used by Czech writer Karel Čapek, who after a recommendation by his brother Josef Čapek introduced the word &quot;robot&quot; for (originally anthropomorphic) machines that do unpaid work for their owners in his 1920 play &quot;R.U.R.&quot;

==== France ====
In France corvée existed until 4 August 1789, shortly after the beginning of the French Revolution, when it was abolished along with a number of other feudal privileges of the French landlords. At that time it was usually directed mainly towards improving the roads. It was greatly resented, and contributed to the widespread discontent that preceded the revolution. Counterrevolution revived corvée in France in 1824, 1836, and 1871, under the name . Every able-bodied man had to give three days&#x27; labour or its money equivalent in order to vote. It also continued to exist under the seigneurial system in what had been New France, in British North America.

In 1866, during the French occupation of Mexico, the French Army under Marshal François Achille Bazaine set up a corvée system to provide labour for public works instead of a system of fines.

==== Romanian principalities ====
In Romania, corvée was called . Karl Marx described the corvée system of the Danubian Principalities as a pre-capitalist form of compulsory over-work. The labour the peasants needed for their own maintenance was distinctly separate from the work they supplied to the landowner (the boyar, or in Romanian) as surplus labour. The 14 days of labour due to the landowneras prescribed by the corvée code in the actually amounted to 42 days, because the working day was considered the time required for the production of an average daily product, &quot;and that average daily product is determined in so crafty a way that no Cyclops would be done with it in 24 hours.&quot; The corvée code was supposed to abolish serfdom, but did not achieve anything toward this goal.

A land reform took place in 1864, after the Danubian Principalities unified and formed the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, which abolished corvée and turned the peasants into free proprietors. The former owners were promised compensation, which was to be paid from a fund the peasants had to contribute to for 15 years. Besides the annual fee, the peasants also had to pay for the newly owned land, although at a price below market value. These debts made many peasants return to a life of semi-serfdom.

==== Russian Empire ====

In the Russian Tsardom and the Russian Empire there were a number of permanent corvées called (), which included carriage corvée (), coachman corvée (), and lodging corvée (), among others.

In the context of Russian history, the term &quot;corvée&quot; is also sometimes used to translate the terms () or (), which refer to the obligatory work that the Russian serfs performed for the pomeshchik (Russian landed nobility) on their land. While no official government regulation on the duration of labour existed, a 1797 ukase by Paul I of Russia described a of three days a week as normal and sufficient for the landowner&#x27;s needs.

In the Black Earth Region, 70% to 77% of the serfs performed and the rest paid levies ().

=== Haiti ===
The independent Kingdom of Haiti based at Cap-Haïtien under Henri Christophe imposed a corvée system upon the common citizenry which was used for massive fortifications to protect against French invasion. Plantation owners could pay the government and have labourers work for them instead. This enabled the Kingdom of Haiti to maintain a stronger economic structure than the Republic of Haiti based in Port-au-Prince in the South under Alexandre Pétion which had a system of agrarian reform distributing land to the labourers.

After deploying to Haiti in 1915 as an expression of the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, the U.S. Armed Forces enforced a corvée system in the interest of making improvements to infrastructure.

=== Imperial China ===
Imperial China had a system of conscripting labour from the public, equated to the Western corvée system by many historians. Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor, and following dynasties imposed it for public works like the Great Wall, the Grand Canal, and the system of national roads and highways. However, as the imposition was exorbitant and punishment for failure draconian, Qin Shi Huang was resented by the people and criticized by many historians. Corvée labour was effectively abolished following the Ming dynasty.

=== Inca Empire and modern Peru ===
The Inca Empire levied tribute labour through a system called &quot;Mit&#x27;a&quot; which was perceived as a public service to the empire. At its height of efficiency, some subsistence farmers could be called to as many as 300 days of &quot;mit&#x27;a&quot; per year. The Spanish colonial rulers co-opted this system after the Spanish conquest of Peru to use natives as a source of forced labour on &quot;encomiendas&quot; and in silver mines. The Incan system that focused on public works found a comeback during the 1960s government of Fernando Belaúnde Terry as a federal effort, with positive effects on Peruvian infrastructure.

Remnants of the system are still found today in modern Peru, such as the Mink&#x27;a () communal work that is levied in Quechua communities in the Andes. An example is the campesino village of Ocra close to Cusco, where each adult is required to perform four days of unpaid labour per month on community projects.

=== India ===
Corvée-style labour ( in Sanskrit) existed in ancient India and lasted until the early 20th century. The practice is mentioned in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, where forced labourers are said to accompany the army. Manusmriti says that mechanics and artisans should be made to work for the king one day a month; other writers advocated for one day of work every fortnight (in all Indian lunar calendars, every month is divided into two fortnights, corresponding to the waxing and the waning moons). For poorer citizens, forced labour was seen as a way to pay their taxes since they could not pay ordinary taxes. Citizens, especially skilled workers, were sometimes made to both pay ordinary taxes and work for the state. If called to work, citizens could pay in cash or kind to discharge their obligations in some cases. In the Maurya and post-Maurya time period, forced labour had become a regular source of income for the state. Written evidence shows rulers granting lands and villages with and without the right to forced labour from workers of those lands.

=== Japan ===
A corvée-style system called was found in pre-modern Japan. During the 1930s, it was common practice to import corvée labourers from both China and Korea to work in coal mines. This practice continued until the end of World War II.

=== Madagascar ===
France annexed Madagascar as a colony in the late 19th century. Governor-General Joseph Gallieni implemented a hybrid corvée and poll tax system, partly for revenue, partly for labour resources as the French had just abolished slavery there, and partly to move away from a subsistence economy. The latter involved paying small amounts for the forced labour. This was one attempt by the colonial administration at a solution to the economic tensions that arose under colonialism. The problems were addressed in a way that was typical of colonialism which, along with the contemporary thinking behind it, is demonstrated in a 1938 work by Sonia E. Howe:

=== The Philippines ===
The system of forced labour otherwise known as evolved within the framework of the system, introduced into the South American colonies by the Spanish government. in the Spanish Philippines refers to 40 days&#x27; forced manual labour for men from 16 to 60 years of age; these workers built community structures such as churches. Exemption from was possible via paying the (corruption of the Spanish , meaning &#x27;absence&#x27;), which was a daily fine of one and a half reales. In 1884, the required amount of labour was reduced to 15 days. The system was patterned after the system for forced labour in Spanish America.

=== Portugal&#x27;s African colonies ===
In Portuguese Africa (e.g. Mozambique), the Native Labour Regulations of 1899 stated that all able bodied men must work for six months of every year, and that &quot;[t]hey have full liberty to choose the means through which to comply with this regulation, but if they do not comply in some way, the public authorities will force them to comply.&quot;

Africans engaged in subsistence agriculture on their own small plots were considered unemployed. The forced labour was sometimes paid, but in cases of rule violations it was sometimes notas punishment. The state benefited from the use of the labour for farming and infrastructure, by high income taxes on those who found work with private employers, and by selling corvée labour to South Africa. This system, called , was not abolished in Mozambique until 1962, and continued in some forms until the Carnation Revolution in 1974.

=== North America ===
Corvée was used in several states and provinces in North America especially for road maintenance, and this practice persisted to some degree in the United States and Canada. Its popularity with local governments gradually waned after the American Revolution with the increasing development of the monetary economy. After the American Civil War, some Southern states, with money in short supply, commuted taxing their inhabitants with obligations in the form of labour for public works, or let them pay a fee or tax to avoid it. The system proved unsuccessful because of the poor quality of work. In 1894, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled that corvée violated the state constitution, and in 1913 Alabama became one of the last states to abolish it.

== Modern instances ==
The government of Myanmar is well known for its use of the corvée and has defended the practice in its official newspapers.

In Bhutan, the &quot;&quot; calls for citizens to do work, such as dzong construction, in lieu of part of their tax obligation to the state.

In Rwanda, the centuries-old tradition of &quot;umuganda&quot;, or community labour, still continues, usually in the form of one Saturday a month when citizens are required to perform work.

Vietnam maintained corvée for females (ages 18–35) and males (ages 18–45) of 10 days yearly for public works at the discretion of the authorities. This was termed labour duty (). However, in 2006, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly voided the decree, effectively abolishing corvée in Vietnam.

The British overseas territory of the Pitcairn Islands, which has a population of about 50 and no income or sales tax, has a system of public work whereby all able-bodied people are required to perform, when called upon, jobs such as road maintenance and repairs to public buildings.

Since the mid-late 19th century, most countries have restricted corvée labour to conscription (military or civilian service), or prison labour.

<text>Starr Family Home State Historic Site is a historical site operated by the Texas Historical Commission in downtown Marshall, Texas. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The museum was made a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1986. On January 1, 2008, the site was transferred from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to the Texas Historical Commission.

==Description==

The site encompasses several structures used by the Starr Family, most notably the main house or Starr Home, Maplecroft, and Rosemont Cottage. Rosemont Cottage is the only remaining portion of Rosemont, the antebellum plantation home that used to stand behind Maplecroft.

The site portrays 150 years and four generations of one of the most influential political families in the periods of the Republic of Texas and early statehood. The family donated the site to the State of Texas in 1976 and in 1982 the site was enlarged to include all of the Starr family residences. The Starrs continued to live at the site until 1985; the site was opened to the public in 1986 as a Texas state park.

James Frank Starr commissioned the construction of the main attraction of the park, Maplecroft. The 1871 Starr home is a two-story, frame, modified late Greek Revival structure with some Victorian styling. Craftsmen, such as shipwrights, and building materials were shipped from New Orleans to Marshall.

In 1985, the house and three acres encompassing seven historic buildings was left to the State of Texas upon the death of the last owner, Mrs. Clara Pope Willoughby.

<text>Pomacanthus is a genus of marine angelfish that is usually found around reefs and coral. Some of the notable places one can see these vari-coloured fish includes the Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Sipidan off the southern coast of Sabah, Malaysia. Generally the patterns and colors of these fish undergo a major transformation from juvenile to adult forms. The juveniles may even appear to be a different species.

==Species==
The following 13 species are classified within the genus &quot;Pomacanthus&quot;:

==Systematics== 
The genus &quot;Pomacanthus&quot; was created in 1802 by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède (1756-1825) with the type species being designated as &quot;Chaetodon arcuatus&quot;. The name is a compound of &quot;poma&quot; meaning&quot;lid&quot; and &quot;acanthus&quot; which means &quot;thorn&quot;, a reference to the prominents spine on the rear margin of the operculum, a feature shared by all the marine angelfishes.

Some authorities divide the genus up into the following subgenera:

* &quot;Pomacanthus&quot; 
** &quot;Pomacanthus (Pomacanthus) arcuatus&quot;
** &quot;Pomacanthus (Pomacanthus) paru&quot;
** &quot;Pomacanthus (Pomacanthus) zonipectus&quot; 
* &quot;Acanthochaetodon&quot; 
** &quot;Pomacanthus (Acanthochaetodon) annularis&quot;
** &quot;Pomacanthus (Acanthochaetodon) chrysurus&quot;
** &quot;Pomacanthus (Acanthochaetodon) imperator&quot;
** &quot;Pomacanthus (Acanthochaetodon) rhomboides&quot;
* &quot;Arusetta&quot; 
** &quot;Pomacanthus (Arusetta) asfur&quot;
** &quot;Pomacanthus (Arusetta) maculosus&quot;
** &quot;Pomacanthus (Arusetta) semicirculatus&quot;
* &quot;Euxiphipops&quot; 
** &quot;Pomacanthus (Euxiphipops) navarchus&quot;
** &quot;Pomacanthus (Euxiphipops) sexstriatus&quot;
** &quot;Pomacanthus (Euxiphipops) xanthometopon&quot;

<text>A radome (a portmanteau of &quot;radar&quot; and &quot;dome&quot;) is a structural, weatherproof enclosure that protects a radar antenna. The radome is constructed of material transparent to radio waves. Radomes protect the antenna from weather and conceal antenna electronic equipment from view. They also protect nearby personnel from being accidentally struck by quickly rotating antennas.

Radomes can be constructed in several shapes spherical, geodesic, planar, etc. depending on the particular application, using various construction materials such as fiberglass, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-coated fabric, and others.

In addition to radar protection, radomes on aircraft platforms also act as fairings that streamline the antenna system, thus reducing drag. When found on fixed-wing aircraft with forward-looking radar, as are commonly used for object or weather detection, the nose cones often additionally serve as radomes. On airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft (e.g. the American E-3 Sentry), a discus-shaped rotating radome, often called a &quot;rotodome&quot;, is mounted on the top of the fuselage for 360-degree scanning coverage. Some newer AEW&amp;C configurations instead use three 120-degree phased array modules inside a stationary radome, examples being the Chinese KJ-2000 and Indian DRDO AEW&amp;Cs. On fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft using microwave satellite for beyond-line-of-sight communication, radomes often appear as bulged &quot;blisters&quot; on the fuselage.

The use of radomes dates back as far as 1941.

The air supported radome built by Walter Bird in 1948 at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory is the first pneumatic construction built in history.

==Use==
A radome is often used to prevent ice and freezing rain from accumulating on antennas. In the case of a spinning radar parabolic antenna, the radome also protects the antenna from debris and rotational irregularities due to wind. Its shape is easily identified by its hardshell, which has strong properties against being damaged.

===Stationary antennas===
For stationary antennas, excessive amounts of ice can de-tune the antenna to the point where its impedance at the input frequency rises drastically, causing the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) to rise as well. This reflected power goes back to the transmitter, where it can cause overheating. A foldback circuit can act to prevent this; however, one drawback of its use is that it causes the station&#x27;s output power to drop dramatically, reducing its range. A radome avoids that by covering the antenna&#x27;s exposed parts with a sturdy, weatherproof material, typically fiberglass, keeping debris or ice away from the antenna, thus preventing any serious issues. One of the main driving forces behind the development of fiberglass as a structural material was the need during World War II for radomes. When considering structural load, the use of a radome greatly reduces wind load in both normal and iced conditions. Many tower sites require or prefer the use of radomes for wind loading benefits and for protection from falling ice or debris.

Where radomes might be considered unsightly if near the ground, electric antenna heaters could be used instead. Usually running on direct current, the heaters do not interfere physically or electrically with the alternating current of the radio transmission.

===Radar dishes===
For radar dishes, a single, large, ball-shaped dome also protects the rotational mechanism and the sensitive electronics, and is heated in colder climates to prevent icing.

The RAF Menwith Hill electronic surveillance base, which includes over 30 radomes, is widely believed to regularly intercept satellite communications. At Menwith Hill, the radome enclosures prevent observers from seeing the direction of the antennas, and therefore which satellites are being targeted. Similarly, radomes prevent observation of antennas used in ECHELON facilities.

The United States Air Force Aerospace Defense Command operated and maintained dozens of air defense radar stations in the contiguous United States and Alaska during the Cold War. Most of the radars used at these ground stations were protected by rigid or inflatable radomes. The radomes were typically at least in diameter and the radomes were attached to standardized radar tower buildings that housed the radar transmitter, receiver and antenna. Some of these radomes were very large. The CW-620 was a space frame rigid radome with a maximum diameter of , and a height of . This radome consisted of 590 panels, and was designed for winds up to . The total radome weight was with a surface area of . The CW-620 radome was designed and constructed by Sperry-Rand Corporation for the Columbus Division of North American Aviation. This radome was originally used for the FPS-35 search radar at Baker Air Force Station, Oregon. When Baker AFS was closed the radome was moved to provide a high-school gymnasium in Payette, Idaho. Pictures and documents are available online at radomes.org/museum for Baker AFS/821st Radar Squadron.

===Maritime satellites===
 For maritime satellite communications service, radomes are widely used to protect dish antennas which are continually tracking fixed satellites while the ship experiences pitch, roll and yaw movements. Large cruise ships and oil tankers may have radomes over 3m in diameter covering antennas for broadband transmissions for television, voice, data, and the Internet, while recent developments allow similar services from smaller installations such as the 85 cm motorised dish used in the SES Broadband for Maritime system. Small private yachts may use radomes as small as 26cm in diameter for voice and low-speed data.

==Alternatives==
An active electronically scanned array radar has no moving antenna and so a radome is not necessary. An example of this is the pyramid which replaced the golfball-style radome installations at RAF Fylingdales.

<doc id="591556" wikidata="Q1502037" url="?curid=591556" title="Slowdive">
<text>Slowdive (stylized in lowercase) are an English rock band that formed in Reading, Berkshire, in 1989. The band consists of Rachel Goswell (vocals, guitars, keyboards), Neil Halstead (vocals, guitars), Christian Savill (guitars), Nick Chaplin (bass), and Simon Scott (drums, guitars, electronics), all of whom played on the band&#x27;s early records. Halstead is the band&#x27;s primary songwriter.

After releasing several EPs, the band released debut album &quot;Just for a Day&quot; (1991) and follow up &quot;Souvlaki&quot; (1993), making the band one of the leading figures of the UK shoegaze scene of the early 1990s. The group broke up soon after the release of their third studio album, &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, in 1995, having seen Scott, Savill and Chaplin depart the band prior. The remaining members continued under a more folk and country-influenced direction as Mojave 3. 

Slowdive reunited in 2014 to play the Primavera Sound festival and released a self-titled studio album in 2017, their first in 22 years. The band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Everything Is Alive&quot;, was released in 2023 and became Slowdive&#x27;s first top ten album in any country, doing so in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

==History==
===1989–1991: Formation and early EPs===
Slowdive were formed in Reading, England, by Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell in October 1989. The two sang and played guitar, and had been friends since they were 6 years old. At a Sunday youth group, they began making music in an indie pop band called the Pumpkin Fairies, with bassist Mike Cottle and drummer Adrian Sell. When the Pumpkin Fairies disbanded, Slowdive formed, also including drummer Adrian Sell and Sell&#x27;s friend, bassist Nick Chaplin. A third guitarist named Christian Savill, previously of the band Eternal, joined when he became the only person to answer an advert from the band. The ad called for a female guitarist, but Savill wanted to join so badly he offered to wear a dress. He was subsequently recruited. The name &quot;Slowdive&quot; was inspired by a dream Chaplin experienced, and a conversation he had with Goswell, who mentioned &quot;Slowdive&quot;, the name of a single by one of her favourite bands, Siouxsie and the Banshees. Goswell later said that she was outvoted for the choice of the name in the end.

The band quickly recorded a demo and several months later played a show with the band Five Thirty. Steve Walters, head of A&amp;R at EMI, attended the show. Afterward, he approached Savill and requested one of their demos. Slowdive signed a recording contract with Creation Records shortly after. The average age of the band was 19 at the time. Sell felt things were progressing too fast and left for university after being in the band for about six months.

A self-titled EP was released in November 1990 and received praise from music critics. &quot;Slowdive&quot; was actually their original demo; the band had preferred the older recordings after feeling disillusioned with their studio craft. In a glowing recommendation, &quot;NME&quot; staff member Simon Williams wrote &quot;Slowdive have banished the barrier restricting creativity... When they really relax, Slowdive can make Cocteau Twins sound like Mudhoney&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; awarded the EP its &quot;Single of the Week&quot; award, an accolade the band&#x27;s next two EPs received.

Drummer Neil Carter joined from fellow Reading band the Colour Mary in time to play on the &quot;Morningrise&quot; EP, but left prior to its release in February 1991. Simon Scott took over on drums after his previous group, an alternative rock band called the Charlottes, broke up. The &quot;Holding Our Breath&quot; EP followed in June 1991, reaching No. 52 in the UK Albums Chart, while the single &quot;Catch the Breeze&quot; topped the UK Indie Chart.

===1991–1992: &quot;Just for a Day&quot;===
By mid-1991, Slowdive had been tagged a &quot;shoegazing&quot; band and part of &quot;the scene that celebrates itself&quot; by the British media. The term shoegazer was applied to bands that followed My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s example of abrasive guitars and ethereal vocals, while &quot;the scene&quot; represented these like-minded groups and their social behaviour; shoegazers typically mingled at each other&#x27;s gigs. Slowdive toured with other shoegazing bands through summer 1991. The British music press became increasingly derisive of shoegazing as the Britpop and grunge movements came underway.

Production on Slowdive&#x27;s debut commenced shortly after Halstead convinced Alan McGee, head of Creation Records, that the band had enough songs written for a full-length album, which was not actually true. The group hurriedly wrote songs in the studio. Experimentation with sounds and cannabis occurred during the process. Halstead drew lyrical inspiration from the abstract nature of the music. He recounted, &quot;[We] went into a studio for six weeks and had no songs at the start and at the end we had an album&quot;.

Their debut, &quot;Just for a Day&quot;, was released in September 1991 and placed in the top 10 on the UK Indie Chart. &quot;NME&quot; gave the record a positive review, but most of the press generally disliked the album as a backlash against shoegazing began. As writer Peter Buckley put it, the album was &quot;dismissed as dreary and lacking in ideas&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; writer Paul Lester railed against the debut, calling it a &quot;major fucking letdown&quot;. This backlash worsened when critics reevaluated shoegazing after the release of My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s &quot;Loveless&quot; in November 1991.

A tour of the United Kingdom followed in autumn 1991. Afterward, the group made their first visit to the United States and toured with alternative rock band Blur. A tour of Europe followed in February 1992. Slowdive&#x27;s US label SBK Records planned to release &quot;Just for a Day&quot; at the beginning of the year, but not before initiating a viral marketing campaign. The band&#x27;s name was stenciled outside MTV and radio stations in New York. Fans stencilled their heads when Slowdive played in Manhattan. The campaign caused some controversy when a statue celebrating the end of slavery was unveiled and had the word &quot;Slowdive&quot; stencilled on it. SBK eventually pushed the release date back three months, which hurt the viral campaign.

===1992–1994: &quot;Souvlaki&quot;===

While they toured in early 1992 to support &quot;Blue Day&quot;, a re-release of their early EP material, the band began writing songs for a follow-up album, but the negative coverage Slowdive received in the press affected their songwriting. &quot;[It] did affect us as we were all teenagers at the time&quot;, said Scott in a 2009 interview, &quot;[We] couldn&#x27;t understand why people were so outraged by our sound that they had to tell the &quot;NME&quot; or whoever that they wanted us dead!&quot; Approximately 40 songs were recorded and rerecorded as the group became very self-conscious of their writing and how it might be received. When McGee listened to the new material, he subsequently dismissed it, stating, &quot;They&#x27;re all shit&quot;. The band discarded all the music and started over. In a 2009 interview, Halstead vividly recalled the incident: &quot;I remember going to start the record in a studio in Bath. Spiritualized had just been there and left a huge Scalextric in the live room. I remember thinking this was the height of indulgence! Ironically we scrapped everything we recorded...we had to start the record again back in Oxfordshire. We should have just played with the Scalextric for a month&quot;.

When the band returned to the UK, they wrote a letter to ambient visionary Brian Eno and requested he produce their second studio album. Eno responded and told them he liked their music, but wanted to collaborate, not produce. Halstead later called the recording session &quot;one of the most surreal stoned experiences of [his] life&quot;. &quot;The first thing he did when he walked into the studio was to rip the clock off the wall and put it by the mixing desk&quot;, Halstead remembered. &quot;He then said &#x27;Okay, you&#x27;re going to play the guitar and I&#x27;m going to record it. I don&#x27;t care what you are going to play, just play something. Two songs from the collaboration appeared on the ensuing album: &quot;Sing&quot;, which was co-written with Eno, and &quot;Here She Comes&quot;, where Eno played keyboards.

Creation Records wanted Slowdive to produce a commercial-sounding album. Halstead agreed: &quot;We wanted to make a &#x27;pop&#x27; record but it took a while to record&quot;. At one point, Halstead suddenly left in summer 1992, seeking seclusion in a Welsh cottage. Savill, Chaplin and Scott were left in a recording studio in Weston-super-Mare, and while waiting for Halstead&#x27;s return, recorded some &quot;joke songs&quot;. To their misfortune, McGee acquired them and became despondent, by which time Halstead had arrived with new music, including &quot;Dagger&quot; and &quot;40 Days&quot;. The band named their second studio album &quot;Souvlaki&quot; after a skit performed by the Jerky Boys, an American comedy duo that recorded prank phone calls.

&quot;Souvlaki&quot; was released in May 1993 alongside the EP &quot;Outside Your Room&quot;, a few months after Suede released their popular debut and the Britpop movement began. Critical reaction, as with their previous album, was generally negative. &quot;NME&quot; writer John Mulvey gave an ambivalent review. Despite noting their dated and &quot;unfulfilling&quot; sound, he did call it an &quot;exemplary product&quot;. Dave Simpson, writing for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, declared, &quot;[This] record is a soulless void [...] I would rather drown choking in a bath full of porridge than ever listen to it again&quot;. To make matters worse, Slowdive booked a tour with fellow shoegazers Catherine Wheel for a tour of the United States, only to find SBK had pushed the album&#x27;s US release date back eight months. The band recorded an EP, titled &quot;5 EP&quot;, and started a modest tour through Europe with dream pop band Cranes. Scott was unhappy with the gap between releases and quit the band in 1994.

A marketing campaign was started in early 1994 to promote &quot;Souvlaki&quot; in the United States, which &quot;AllMusic&quot; writer Andy Kellman said would &quot;undoubtedly go down in industry history as one of the laziest ever&quot;; SBK sent fans a release flyer and were told that if they copied and posted 50 flyers around town, they would receive a free copy of &quot;Souvlaki&quot;. Fans who participated had to document their progress with photographs to prove they performed the activity. Halfway through the &quot;Souvlaki&quot; US tour, SBK pulled their funding and left Slowdive to pay the rest themselves. In 1994, the band funded two small tours of the United States using money raised through the sale of a live tape and a tour programme that mocked the record label.

===1994–1995: &quot;Pygmalion&quot;===
Scott was replaced on drums by Ian McCutcheon. By the recording of their third and then-final studio album, &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, Halstead had moved Slowdive away from the dreamy guitar sound and warm yet solemn tone of earlier releases to a newer, more minimalist extreme, similar to heavily ambient bands such as Seefeel, A.R. Kane and Labradford.

Slowdive were dropped by Creation a week after the release of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (as were Swervedriver not long after).

===1995–2014: Post-Slowdive endeavours===
Shortly after being dropped by Creation, Halstead, Goswell and McCutcheon recorded an album of country-influenced songs, and were signed to label 4AD, changing the band name to Mojave 3 to reflect the new musical direction. This group is currently on hiatus.

Drummer Scott went on to form Televise, taking the ambient shoegazing sound and pushing it into electronic fields similar to Fennesz. He joined Lowgold in 1999. Scott later went on to release solo records on the 12k, Miasmah, Sonic Pieces and Kompakt labels, and co-write and perform with Ghostly International-signed Seattle band the Sight Below.

Savill went on to form Monster Movie, a dream pop group that maintained much of the older Slowdive style. They have released four studio albums and an EP to date. Pre-Slowdive, Savill was in a band called Eternal, which also included Monster Movie member Sean Hewson.

Halstead and Goswell have both released solo studio albums on 4AD, and Halstead formed the side project Black Hearted Brother in 2013. Goswell joined the supergroup Minor Victories in 2015.

Halstead also recorded with a side project called Zurich with members of Seefeel and Knives ov Resistance; the trio&#x27;s sole studio album was released in 2009.

===2014–present: Reunion and new albums===

After a Slowdive Twitter account and website were launched in January 2014, it was announced that Slowdive had re-formed to play the 2014 Primavera Sound festival in Barcelona and Porto. A 20-date summer world tour was announced, including performances at the Electric Picnic festival in Stradbally, County Laois; the FYF Fest in Los Angeles; the Fortress Festival in Fort Worth, Texas; the Wave-Gotik-Treffen festival in Leipzig; the Roskilde Festival in Denmark; the Radar Festival in Italy and the Off Festival in Katowice, Poland. A North American tour, also 20 dates, was announced for October and November 2014. Former drummer Simon Scott returned to the band for the reunion. Ian McCutcheon, the band’s final drummer prior to their break-up, who had later joined Halstead and Goswell in Mojave 3, did not return.

In January 2017, Slowdive released &quot;Star Roving&quot;, their first single in 22 years, on Dead Oceans. Their self-titled fourth studio album, &quot;Slowdive&quot;, was released in May 2017, preceded by another single, &quot;Sugar for the Pill&quot;.
In September 2020, Slowdive announced they had begun work on their fifth studio album. In April 2023, the band confirmed on a podcast that they had finished their new album. The lead single, &quot;Kisses&quot;, was released on 20 June 2023, and later that month the band played the Glastonbury Festival for the first time. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Skin in the Game&quot;, was released on 18 July 2023, followed by &quot;The Slab&quot; and &quot;Alife&quot; in August, and the album &quot;Everything Is Alive&quot; was released on 1 September 2023. It became the band&#x27;s first top ten album in any country, doing so in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

==Influences and style==
Music journalist Simon Reynolds wrote that &quot;Halstead was more influenced by Pink Floyd than by the Sex Pistols. Slowdive&#x27;s formative pop experiences involve post-punk groups like the Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees, whose artsy approach was closer to &#x27;70s progressive groups than punk&#x27;s angry minimalism&quot;. Halstead stated that Slowdive wanted &quot;to create something big and beautiful and sort of timeless&quot;. Other names he and Goswell mentioned were David Bowie, the Byrds, the Rolling Stones, Cocteau Twins, My Bloody Valentine and the Jesus and Mary Chain&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Psychocandy&quot; (1985). Bassist Nick Chaplin&#x27;s favorite band is the Cure, which also manifested in Slowdive&#x27;s music.

Their sound has been described as shoegaze, dream pop, and ambient.

== Legacy ==

Slowdive were initially dismissed by the British independent music press. While reviews of the band&#x27;s early extended plays were favorable, Slowdive&#x27;s reputation took a downturn with the release of their debut album, &quot;Just for a Day&quot;, which received middling reviews from publications such as &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Select&quot;. In 1991, Richey Edwards, guitarist and lyricist of Manic Street Preachers, proclaimed: &quot;We will always hate Slowdive more than Hitler.&quot; Upon its release, &quot;Souvlaki&quot; was received similarly negatively; &quot;Melody Maker&quot;&#x27;s Dave Simpson infamously wrote, &quot;I would rather drown choking in a bath full of porridge than ever listen to it again&quot;, three years after the publication praised the band&#x27;s EPs for being &quot;impossible, immaculate and serene&quot;. The band theorised that they came across as too soft and feminine, and were overshadowed by the emergence of Britpop at the same time. Said Goswell of Britpop: &quot;It was very laddy.&quot; About the band&#x27;s initial poor reviews, Goswell said: &quot;Within about a year of being in the industry, I became very disenchanted, because of the treatment that we got from this small amount of UK journalists. Obviously, they held a lot of power in this country at that point.&quot; In 2004, &quot;The Independent&quot; referred to Slowdive as a &quot;long-forgotten indie band&quot;.

The band&#x27;s reputation was mended by critics throughout the 2010s, who acclaimed Slowdive as one of the best shoegaze bands. Upon Slowdive&#x27;s re-formation in 2014, the band began playing to larger crowds than they did during their initial run, and members realized that they were more famous and recognisable than ever before. Music writers noted Slowdive&#x27;s modern popularity as part of shoegaze&#x27;s revival in popularity with younger Millennials and Generation Z.

<doc id="591559" wikidata="Q4743750" url="?curid=591559" title="American Federation of Government Employees">
<text>The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) is an American labor union representing over 750,000 employees of the federal government, about 5,000 employees of the District of Columbia, and a few hundred private sector employees, mostly in and around federal facilities. AFGE is the largest union for civilian, non-postal federal employees and the largest union for District of Columbia employees who report directly to the mayor (&quot;i.e.&quot;, outside D.C. public schools). It is affiliated with the AFL–CIO.

==History==
AFGE was founded on October 17, 1932, by local unions loyal to the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and left the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE) when that union became independent of the AFL (NFFE in 1998 became part of the IAMAW, which is affiliated with the AFL–CIO).

AFGE is a federation of local unions, with each local maintaining autonomy through operating under local constitutions that comply with the AFGE National constitution ratified originally during its founding in 1932.

Federal employees&#x27; right to organize and bargain binding labor contracts was established in law by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which AFGE helped to draft, and which states that collective bargaining in the federal sector is in the public interest while also barring the right to strike.

AFGE has played a crucial role in the struggle for women&#x27;s rights and civil rights in the federal sector, and was one of the first unions to establish a Women&#x27;s Department and a Fair Practices Department, with the officer over those departments holding a seat on the National Executive Committee (NEC) and with Women&#x27;s and Fair Practices Coordinators elected in each AFGE district since the early 1970s.

AFGE&#x27;s December 2009 court suits stopped aspects of the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s &quot;National Security Personnel System&quot; (for DOD) and MAXHR (for DHS), and AFGE also won changes to law that make the contracting out process more balanced in regard to federal employees&#x27; interests. In 2010, the Obama administration issued an executive order for the federal government to focus on insourcing federal jobs rather than outsourcing them overseas or to contractors.

AFGE&#x27;s motto was established as &quot;To Do For All That Which No One Can Do For Oneself&quot;.

AFGE&#x27;s original emblem was a shield with the stars and stripes and the words &quot;Justice, Fraternity, Progress&quot; and the current emblem is three workers supporting a globe with a map of the United States and the words &quot;Proud to Make America Work&quot;.

In June 2011, AFGE also won the historic largest single nationwide consolidated bargaining unit election of over 44,000 employees of the Transportation Security Administration, part of the Department of Homeland Security. AFGE is working for a change in law which will give them the same collective bargaining rights as other federal employees.

In August 2015, AFGE at its national convention decided its official colors are blue and gold. All future insignia will meet as such.

==Organization==
AFGE is led by a National Executive Council, made up of National President Everett Kelley, a National Secretary-Treasurer, and National Vice President, Women&#x27;s and Fair Practices, elected at a triennial National Convention, and 12 National Vice Presidents who oversee geographic districts and are elected at District caucuses.

<doc id="591568" wikidata="Q1969650" url="?curid=591568" title="Trigonometric polynomial">
<text>In the mathematical subfields of numerical analysis and mathematical analysis, a trigonometric polynomial is a finite linear combination of functions sin(&quot;nx&quot;) and cos(&quot;nx&quot;) with &quot;n&quot; taking on the values of one or more natural numbers. The coefficients may be taken as real numbers, for real-valued functions. For complex coefficients, there is no difference between such a function and a finite Fourier series.

Trigonometric polynomials are widely used, for example in trigonometric interpolation applied to the interpolation of periodic functions. They are used also in the discrete Fourier transform.

The term &quot;trigonometric polynomial&quot; for the real-valued case can be seen as using the analogy: the functions sin(&quot;nx&quot;) and cos(&quot;nx&quot;) are similar to the monomial basis for polynomials. In the complex case the trigonometric polynomials are spanned by the positive and negative powers of formula_1, i.e., Laurent polynomials in formula_2 under the change of variables formula_3.

==Definition==
Any function &quot;T&quot; of the form

formula_4

with coefficients formula_5 and at least one of the highest-degree coefficients formula_6 and formula_7 non-zero, is called a &quot;complex trigonometric polynomial&quot; of degree &quot;N&quot;. Using Euler&#x27;s formula the polynomial can be rewritten as 

formula_8
with formula_9.

Analogously, letting coefficients formula_10, and at least one of formula_6 and formula_7 non-zero or, equivalently, formula_13 and formula_14 for all formula_15, then 

formula_16

is called a &quot;real trigonometric polynomial&quot; of degree &quot;N&quot;.

==Properties==
A trigonometric polynomial can be considered a periodic function on the real line, with period some divisor of , or as a function on the unit circle.

Trigonometric polynomials are dense in the space of continuous functions on the unit circle, with the uniform norm; this is a special case of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem. More concretely, for every continuous function and every there exists a trigonometric polynomial such that formula_17 for all . Fejér&#x27;s theorem states that the arithmetic means of the partial sums of the Fourier series of converge uniformly to provided is continuous on the circle; these partial sums can be used to approximate .

A trigonometric polynomial of degree has a maximum of roots in a real interval unless it is the zero function.

== Fejér-Riesz theorem ==
The Fejér-Riesz theorem states that every positive &quot;real&quot; trigonometric polynomial 
formula_18 
satisfying formula_19 for all formula_20,
can be represented as the square of the modulus of another (usually &quot;complex&quot;) trigonometric polynomial formula_21 such that:
formula_22
Or, equivalently, every Laurent polynomial
formula_23
with formula_24 that satisfies formula_25 for all formula_26 can be written as:
formula_27
for some polynomial formula_28.

<text>The roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja) is a gregarious wading bird of the ibis and spoonbill family, Threskiornithidae. It is a resident breeder in both South and North America. The roseate spoonbill&#x27;s pink color is diet-derived, consisting of the carotenoid pigment canthaxanthin, like the American flamingo.

==Taxonomy==
The roseate spoonbill was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name &quot;Platalea ajaja&quot;. Linnaeus largely based his account on the &quot;Aiaia&quot; that been described and illustrated over a century earlier by the German naturalist Georg Marcgrave in his book &quot;Historia Naturalis Brasiliae&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as South America but this is now restricted to Brazil. The genus name &quot;Platalea&quot; is Latin and means &quot;broad&quot;, referring to the distinctive shape of the bill; the specific epithet &quot;ajaja&quot; is from the name for the species in the Tupi language as reported by Marcgrave. The species is treated as monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The roseate spoonbill is sometimes placed in its own genus – &quot;Ajaia&quot;. A 2010 study of mitochondrial DNA of the spoonbills by Chesser and colleagues found that the roseate and yellow-billed spoonbills were each other&#x27;s closest relatives, and the two were descended from an early offshoot from the ancestors of the other four spoonbill species. They felt the genetic evidence meant it was equally valid to consider all six to be classified within the genus &quot;Platalea&quot; or alternatively the two placed in the monotypic genera &quot;Platibis&quot; and &quot;Ajaia&quot;, respectively. However, as the six species were so similar morphologically, keeping them within the one genus made more sense.

==Description==
The roseate spoonbill is long, with a wingspan and a body mass of . The tarsus measures , the culmen measures and the wing measures and thus the legs, bill, neck and spatulate bill all appear elongated. Adults have a bare greenish head (&quot;golden buff&quot; when breeding) and a white neck, back and breast (with a tuft of pink feathers in the center when breeding), and are otherwise a deep pink. The bill is grey. There is no significant sexual dimorphism.

Like the American flamingo, their pink color is diet-derived, consisting of the carotenoid pigment canthaxanthin. Another carotenoid, astaxanthin, can also be found deposited in flight and body feathers. The colors can range from pale pink to bright magenta, depending on age, whether breeding or not, and location. Unlike herons, spoonbills fly with their necks outstretched. They alternate groups of stiff, shallow wingbeats with glides.

==Distribution==
In the United States, the species is locally common in Texas, Florida, and southwest Louisiana. Generally, the species occurs in South America mostly east of the Andes, and in coastal regions of the Caribbean, Central America, Mexico, and the Gulf Coast of the United States, and from central Florida&#x27;s Atlantic coast at Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, adjoined with NASA Kennedy Space Center at least as far north as South Carolina&#x27;s Myrtle Beach.

Plume hunting in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries almost drove the roseate spoonbill to extinction. However, following decades of conservation efforts, and the effects of climate change, the range of the roseate spoonbill has expanded considerably in the 21st century. For instance, the species was recorded breeding in the state of Georgia for the first time in 2011. Moreover, its presence in South Carolina has expanded significantly since the 1970s, as well as a single sighting of the bird in both Michigan and Wisconsin. The last known recorded log of the bird in the state of Wisconsin was of a deceased specimen in 1845 in Rock County. It made an historic reappearance 178 years later when a specimen was sighted by a crew that was doing birding surveys on the restricted-access Cat Island Causeway on July 27, 2023.

In the summer of 2021, sightings of the bird were reported well outside its typical range, including in Washington, D.C., upstate New York, and even New Hampshire. A large flock was spotted in Huntley Meadows Park in Fairfax County, Virginia, drawing a large crowd of spectators.

In Florida Bay, roseate spoonbills are an ecological and scientific indicator species. The number of nests varies with both the amount of fresh water and the depth of seawater there, as wetlands turn into open ocean. The birds are choosing to nest further north and inland in Florida, with sharp changes in nest locations noted in the years 2006–2020.

==Behavior==
Little is known about the roseate spoonbill&#x27;s behavior outside of their foraging habits. This species feeds in shallow fresh or coastal waters by swinging its bill from side to side as it steadily walks through the water, often in groups. Moreover, the spoon-shaped bill allows it to sift easily through mud.

The bird feeds on crustaceans, bits of plant material, aquatic insects, mollusks, frogs, newts and very small fish (such as minnows) ignored by larger waders. In Brazil, researchers found roseate spoonbill diets to consist of fish, insects, crustaceans, mollusks, and seeds, all foraged from limnetic/freshwater habitats. This habitat specialization, combined with the relative plasticity of great egret foraging behavior, allows the two species to minimize competition during the breeding season. Roseate spoonbills must compete for food with other freshwater birds, such as snowy egrets, great egrets, tricolored herons and American white pelicans. Roseate spoonbills are often trailed by egrets when foraging in a commensal &quot;beater-follower&quot; relationship, as the spoonbill&#x27;s disturbance of the sediment makes prey more available to the egret (follower).

===Breeding===
The roseate spoonbill nests in shrubs or trees, often mangroves, laying two to five eggs, which are whitish with brown markings. Immature birds have white, feathered heads, and the pink of the plumage is paler. The bill is yellowish or pinkish. Nestlings are sometimes killed by turkey vultures, bald eagles, raccoons and invasive fire ants.

==Conservation and threats==
Plume hunting in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries almost drove the roseate spoonbill to extinction. However, it is currently considered not threatened. Information about predation on adults is lacking. In 2022, an 18-year-old banded bird was discovered, making it the oldest known wild individual.

<doc id="591571" wikidata="Q2084664" url="?curid=591571" title="Solomon Spalding">
<text>Solomon Spalding (February 20, 1761 – October 20, 1816) was an American author who wrote two related texts: an unfinished manuscript entitled &quot;Manuscript Story – Conneaut Creek&quot;, and an unpublished historical romance about the lost civilization of the mound builders of North America called &quot;Manuscript Found&quot;. Whether these texts are distinct is disputed. As none of his work was ever published, the titles are only working titles and thus not fixed. After Spalding&#x27;s death, a number of individuals suggested that Spalding&#x27;s work was used as a source by Joseph Smith Jr for the Book of Mormon, a scripture in the Latter Day Saint movement.

==Biography==
Spalding was born in Ashford, Connecticut to Josiah Spaulding Sr (1729-1809) and Priscilla Paine Spaulding (1734-1817). He was a member of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. In 1782, he entered Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, graduating with the class of 1785. In October 1787, he became an ordained Congregationalist preacher in Windham, Connecticut.

In 1795, Spalding married Matilda D Sabin (1805-1891) and opened a store with his younger brother Josiah Spaulding Jr (1765-1859) in Cherry Valley, New York. In 1799, they moved the store to Richfield, New York. Around this time, Spalding bought a tract of land in and relocated to Conneaut, Ohio. While in Conneaut, Spalding began writing &quot;Manuscript, Found&quot;. In 1812, due to the disruptions of the War of 1812, Spalding moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1814, he moved to Amity, Pennsylvania, where he died two years later.

==The Oberlin Manuscript==
From 1809 to 1812, Spalding worked on a historical fiction about a Roman discovery of the Americas. An unfinished manuscript copy of this work exists, called &quot;The Oberlin Manuscript&quot; or &quot;Honolulu Manuscript&quot;. It is a historical romance &quot;purporting to have been translated from the Latin, found on 24 rolls of parchment in a cave, on the banks of the Conneaut Creek&quot;. It tells of a Roman ship which discovers America.

The text of the Oberlin Manuscript was published by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) in 1885, and by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1886 and 1910 under the name &quot;Manuscript, Found.&quot; In Eber D. Howe&#x27;s anti-Mormon book &quot;Mormonism Unvailed,&quot; family members and other witnesses claimed that the true title of the Oberlin Manuscript is actually &quot;Manuscript Story – Conneaut Creek&quot;, and that Spalding penned another manuscript titled &quot;Manuscript, Found&quot; which bore no resemblance to the Oberlin Manuscript.

==Other Manuscript==
Around 1812, Spalding allegedly completed a historical romance distinct from the Oberlin Manuscript which &quot;purported to have been a record found buried in the earth&quot;. Spalding moved to Pittsburgh and reportedly took this manuscript to the publisher Patterson &amp; Lambdin, but Spalding died in 1816 before the manuscript could be published.

Unlike the Oberlin Manuscript, there is, to date, no physical evidence of this first manuscript, so the details of this other manuscript are based on testimonies originally published some twenty years later in &quot;Mormonism Unvailed&quot;.

===Alleged contents of second manuscript===
; Plot
According to John Spalding, Solomon&#x27;s brother, the plot of &quot;Manuscript, Found&quot; told &quot;of the first settlers of America, endeavoring to show that the American Indians are the descendants of the Jews, or the lost tribes. &quot;Spaulding’s fiction is about a group of Romans blown off course on a journey to Britain who arrive instead in America. One of the Romans narrates the adventures of the group and the history and culture of the people they find in America.&quot; Cruel and bloody wars ensued, in which great multitudes were slain. They buried their dead in large heaps, which caused the mounds so common in this country.&quot; Spalding gave this as an affidavit to be published in Eber D. Howe&#x27;s anti-Mormon book &quot;Mormonism Unvailed&quot;. 
; Phraseology 
Those who claim to have seen the second manuscript testified that it was written &quot;in scripture style of writing&quot; and recalled its repetitive usage of phrases like &quot;and it came to pass&quot; or &quot;now it came to pass&quot;, as well as the repeated phrase &quot;I Nephi&quot;.

=== Reliability of witness accounts of a second manuscript ===
Some modern scholars question the validity of the eyewitness accounts of this second manuscript. Fawn Brodie, in &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot;, was skeptical of the witness statements.

==Theorized usage of Spalding&#x27;s work in Book of Mormon==
In 1832, Latter Day Saint missionaries Samuel H. Smith and Orson Hyde visited Conneaut, Ohio, and preached from the Book of Mormon. Nehemiah King, a resident of Conneaut who knew Spalding when he lived there, said that the Mormon text resembled the story written by Spalding years before. In 1833, Spalding&#x27;s brother John and seven other residents of Conneaut signed affidavits stating that Spalding had written a manuscript, portions of which were identical to the Book of Mormon. These statements were published in E. D. Howe&#x27;s 1834 book &quot;Mormonism Unvailed&quot;, in which the theory was presented that the Book of Mormon was plagiarized from this manuscript. Several years later, Spalding&#x27;s widow and daughter, other residents of Conneaut, and residents of Amity, Pennsylvania, also signed statements indicating that Spalding had authored a manuscript that was similar to the Book of Mormon.

&quot;I well remember that he wrote in the old style, and commenced about every sentence with &#x27;and it came to pass,&#x27; or &#x27;now it came to pass,&#x27; the same as in the Book of Mormon, and according to the best of my recollection and belief, it is the same as my brother Solomon wrote, with the exception of the religious matter.&quot;

In 1927, Professor Azariah S. Root, who had headed the library at Oberlin College, wrote a letter regarding the origins of the Spalding Manuscript and how it relates to the Book of Mormon. In it he states that the Spalding document to which he had access, The Oberlin Manuscript, &quot;seems pretty clearly not to have been the manuscript from which the Book of Mormon was written&quot;. Since neither Root nor anybody else had possession of Spalding&#x27;s alleged second manuscript, he stated that The Oberlin Manuscript &quot;does not seem to throw very much light&quot; on the question of whether the second manuscript was used as a basis for the Book of Mormon.

== History ==
Raipur district, like the rest of the Chhattisgarh plain, was once known as Dakshina Kosala and considered to be under Maurya Empire. In Arang near Raipur, a Gupta inscription dated to the 6th century CE shows Gupta hegemony over the region. In the 7th century CE, the region was ruled by a Buddhist kingdom in Bhandak in modern-day Maharashtra and was described by Xuanzang. A branch of this family later migrated to Sirpur in present-day Mahasamund district, and later took control of the entirety of Dakshina Kosala. This kingdom&#x27;s prosperity reached its height with Tivaradeva. His son inscribed almost all temples in Sirpur. They were later ousted by the Sharabpuriyas, who took control of the rest of Chhattisgarh and ruled for several centuries.

By the early 9th century the Kalachuris gained control of the region. The Kalachuris of Ratnapura ruled Ratnapur until the 13th century. By the 14th century, the Kalachuris of Raipur branch gained power. One king of the Raipur branch conquered 18 garh, or forts, of the enemy - lending an etymology to Chhattisgarh, the 36 forts. By the 18th century Kalachuris became the overlords of entire Chhattisgarh region.

<text>Lewis A. Swift (February 29, 1820 – January 5, 1913) was an American astronomer who discovered 13 comets and 1,248 previously uncatalogued nebulae. Only William Herschel discovered more nebulae visually.

==Discoveries==
Swift discovered or co-discovered a number of comets, including periodic comets 11P/Tempel-Swift-LINEAR, 64P/Swift-Gehrels, and 109P/Swift-Tuttle (parent body of the Perseids meteor shower). He also discovered comets C/1877 G2, C/1878 N1, C/1879 M1, C/1881 J1, C/1881 W1, C/1892 E1, D/1895 Q1 (also known as D/Swift, whose debris stream Mariner 4 probably encountered on September 15, 1967), C/1896 G1 and C/1899 E1, and co-discovered C/1883 D1 (Brooks-Swift). Note, however, comet 54P/de Vico-Swift-NEAT was discovered by his son Edward D. Swift rather than by him.

He discovered his last comet at the age of 79. He was one of the few people to see Comet Halley at two of its appearances, 76 years apart (see also: External Link).

In 1878 he believed he had observed two Vulcan-type planets (planets within the orbit of Mercury), but he was mistaken.

Apart from comets, he also discovered hundreds of nebulae, such as IC 289, and galaxies, such as NGC 6, NGC 19 and NGC 27. He independently observed NGC 17, leading to its separate listing in the New General Catalogue as NGC 34.

==Life==
According to Swift, he first became interested in astronomy as young boy after observing the Great Comet of 1843 while on his way to school in Clarkson, New York. His teacher initially dismissed his observation, but three days later the &#x27;discovery&#x27; of the comet was announced.

Swift conducted his early observations in Rochester, NY, &#x27;lain out in the snow&#x27; in an alley on Ambrose Street or on the roof of Duffy&#x27;s Cider Mill. Later he gained a patron in the Rochester patent medicine businessman Hulbert Harrington Warner, who financed the building of an observatory for Swift. A fund of $13,000 was raised to purchase a 16-inch telescope for Swift.

Warner went bankrupt in the Panic of 1893, which ended his financial support, and Swift then went to California to become director of Mount Lowe Observatory, taking the 16 inch telescope with him.

He was married twice, first to Lucretia Hunt in 1850 and then to Carrie D. Topping in 1864. Edward D. Swift was his son by the latter wife.

==Honors==
Swift received an honorary Ph.D. from the University of Rochester in 1879.

Swift received more medals than any other astronomer of his time including three made of gold from the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna, four made of bronze from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and the Laplace Medal from the Société astronomique de France (the French Astronomical Society). In 1897 he was the first person awarded the Jackson-Gwilt Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society.

The asteroid 5035 Swift is named in his honour, as is the lunar crater Swift.

<text>Raipur district is a district in the Chhattisgarh state of India. Its administrative headquarters is the city of Raipur. The district is rich in mineral resources and there are many wildlife sanctuaries. With a population of 2 million, it is the most populous district of Chhattisgarh.

==History==

Raipur district, like the rest of the Chhattisgarh plain, was once known as Dakshina Kosala and considered to be under Maurya Empire. In Arang near Raipur, a Gupta inscription dated to the 6th century CE shows Gupta hegemony over the region. In the 7th century CE, the region was ruled by a Buddhist kingdom in Bhandak in modern-day Maharashtra and was described by Xuanzang. A branch of this family later migrated to Sirpur in present-day Mahasamund district, and later took control of the entirety of Dakshina Kosala. This kingdom&#x27;s prosperity reached its height with Tivaradeva. His son inscribed almost all temples in Sirpur. They were later ousted by the Sharabpuriyas, who took control of the rest of Chhattisgarh and ruled for several centuries.

The Haihayas or Kalachuris, who claimed descent from the Chedis, later took control of the region in the early 9th century. The Haihaiya ruled Mughatunga was the first of the dynasty to rule Chhattisgarh, and his grandson set up the capital in Ratanpur, modern Bilaspur district. Their territory included modern Raipur. The Kalachuris controlled the region from Ratanpur the next three centuries, building many temples throughout their kingdom. By the 12th century, many small portions of their realm were given as fiefdoms to minor princes of the family and their power declined. The Haihaiyas of the Raipur branch then began to gain strength: one of their kings conquered 18 , or forts, of the enemy - lending an etymology to &quot;Chhattisgarh&quot;, the 36 forts. They ruled until the reign of Amar Singh Deva in 1741.

In the mid-16th century, Kalyan Singh, current ruler of Raipur, took audience with Akbar and was rewarded with the title of Raja and other high titles. This was the first Muslim influence in Chhattisgarh, which would always remain limited. By the early 18th century, the Kalachuris had become the overlords of a large number of divided petty chiefdoms, but with little authority. The Kalachuri ruler Raghunath Singh was the final independent ruler from Ratanpur, and in 1740 the Maratha general Bhaskar Pant invaded the region. A despondent, heirless Singh did not put up much resistance, and the Marathas took the region with little loss. Raghunath Singh continued ruling as a Maratha vassal. In 1745, Raghunath Singh died and Pant installed Mohan Singh, a loyal Maratha vassal from the dynasty, on the throne, where he ruled until 1758 when his son Bhimbaji took control with Maratha support. Bhimbaji ruled virtually independently of Nagpur, but his brother Venkoji who succeeded him was far less interested in administration than Nagpur court politics. Although a &quot;subah&quot;, a governor, was appointed by Venkoji to administer the region for him, this was resisted and real administration of the region was done by Bhimaji&#x27;s widow Anandi Bai and a council of ministers. After Anandi Bai&#x27;s death in the early 19th century, the region was ruled by a series of governors under a very loose control of Nagpur and often exploited the office to become rich. After the Third Anglo-Maratha war in 1818, a British colonel administered the region. British accounts claim the people were &#x27;oppressed&#x27; by the Marathas, especially their pindari raids. The country returned to rule by subahs from Nagpur in 1830, but Raipur was too remote to have much contact with the government. This continued until the annexation of Nagpur under the Doctrine of Lapse in 1854.

Amar Singh, the ruler of Raipur, continued ruling without Maratha interference until 1750. On his death, the Maratha government confiscated his holdings but later returned it to his son, whose family continued to hold revenue rights until Independence.

<doc id="591584" wikidata="Q344179" url="?curid=591584" title="Panait Istrati">
<text>Panait Istrati (; sometimes rendered as &quot;Panaït Istrati&quot;; (August 10, 1884 – April 16, 1935) was a Romanian working class writer, who wrote in French and Romanian, nicknamed &quot;The Maxim Gorky of the Balkans&quot;. Istrati appears to be the first Romanian author explicitly depicting a homosexual character in his work.

==Early life==

Born in Brăila, Istrati was the son of the laundress Joița Istrate and of the Greek tobacco trader Georgios Valsamis from the village of Faraklata in Kefalonia.

He studied in primary school for six years in Baldovinești, after being held back twice. He then earned his living as an apprentice to a tavern-keeper, then as a pastry cook and peddler. In the meantime, he was a prolific reader.

His first attempts at writing date from around 1907 when he started sending pieces to the socialist periodicals in Romania, debuting with the article, &quot;Hotel Regina&quot; in &quot;România Muncitoare&quot;. Here, he later published his first short stories, &quot;Mântuitorul&quot; (&quot;The Redeemer&quot;), &quot;Calul lui Bălan&quot; (&quot;Bălan&#x27;s Horse&quot;), &quot;Familia noastră&quot; (&quot;Our Family&quot;), &quot;1 Mai&quot; (&quot;May Day&quot;). He also contributed pieces to other leftist newspapers such as &quot;Dimineața&quot;, &quot;Adevărul&quot;, and &quot;Viața Socială&quot;.

In 1910, he was involved in organizing a strike action in Brăila. He went to Bucharest, Istanbul, Cairo, Naples, Paris (1913–1914), and Switzerland (where he settled for a while, trying to cure his tuberculosis). Istrati&#x27;s travels were marked by two successive unhappy marriages, a brief return to Romania in 1915 when he tried to earn his living as a hog farmer, and long periods of vagabondage.

While in the sanatorium, Istrati met Russian Jewish-Swiss Zionist writer Josué Jéhouda, who became his friend and French language tutor.

Living in misery, ill and depressed, he attempted suicide in 1921 on his way to Nice, but his life was rescued in time. Shortly before the attempt, he had written to Romain Rolland, the French writer he admired most and with whom he had long tried to get in touch. Rolland received the letter through the Police and immediately replied. In 1923 Istrati&#x27;s story &quot;Kyra Kyralina&quot; (or &quot;Chira Chiralina&quot;) was published with a preface by Rolland. It became the first in his &quot;Adrien Zograffi&quot; literary cycle. Rolland was fascinated with Istrati&#x27;s adventurous life, urging him to write more and publishing parts of his work in &quot;Clarté&quot;, the magazine that he and Henri Barbusse owned. The next major work by Istrati was the novel &quot;Codine&quot;.

Pamfil Șeicaru named Istrati &quot;poor poet of deflowered arses&quot;. Istrati is the first Romanian author to write a novel – &quot;Chira Chiralina&quot; – in which a character is homosexual.

==Istrati and communism==
Istrati shared the leftist ideals of Rolland, and, as much as his mentor, placed his hopes in the Bolshevik vision. In 1927 he visited the Soviet Union on the anniversary of the October Revolution, accompanied by Christian Rakovsky during the first stage of the journey (Rakovsky was Soviet ambassador to Paris, and by then already falling out of favor with Joseph Stalin). He travelled through large sections of the European part, witnessing celebrations in Moscow and Kiev. He was joined in Moscow by his future close friend, Nikos Kazantzakis; while in the city, Panait Istrati met Victor Serge and expressed his wish to become a citizen of the Soviet Union. He and Kazantzakis wrote Stalin a congratulatory letter that remained unanswered.

In 1928–29, after a tumultuous stay in Greece (where he was engaged in fights with the police and invited to leave the country), he went again to the Soviet Union. Through extended visits in more remote places such as the Moldavian ASSR (where he got in touch with his friend Ecaterina Arbore), Nizhny Novgorod, Baku, and Batumi, Istrati learned the full truth of Stalin&#x27;s communist dictatorship, out of which experience he wrote his famous book, &quot;The Confession of a Loser&quot;, the first in the succession of disenchantments expressed by intellectuals such as Arthur Koestler and André Gide. Istrati dealt with the mounting persecution of Old Bolsheviks and the gradual victimization of whole population groups. His views were also harshly made clear in two letters he sent to the GPU leadership in December 1928.

Thereafter, he suffered a crisis of conscience mainly due to being branded a &quot;Trotskyist&quot; or even a &quot;Fascist&quot; by his former communist friends, the most violent of which proved to be Henri Barbusse. Rolland had praised Istrati&#x27;s letters to the GPU, but he nonetheless chose to stay clear of the controversy. Istrati came back to Romania ill and demoralised, was treated for tuberculosis in Nice, then returned to Bucharest.

==Last years==

The political opinions Istrati expressed after his split with Bolshevism are rather ambiguous. He was still closely watched by the Romanian secret police (&quot;Siguranța Statului&quot;), and he had written an article (dated April 8, 1933) in the French magazine &quot;Les Nouvelles littéraires&quot;, aptly titled &quot;L&#x27;homme qui n&#x27;adhère à rien&quot; (&quot;The man who will adhere to nothing&quot;).

At the same time, Istrati started publishing in &quot;Cruciada Românismului&quot; (&quot;The Crusade of Romanianism&quot;), the voice of a left-leaning splinter group of the ultra-nationalist Iron Guard. As such, Istrati became associated with the group&#x27;s leader Mihai Stelescu, who had been elected as a member of Parliament for the Iron Guard in 1933 and whose dissidence was the reason for his brutal assassination by the Decemviri in 1936; Istrati was himself assaulted several times by the Guard&#x27;s squads.

Isolated and unprotected, Panait Istrati died at Filaret Sanatorium in Bucharest. He was buried in Bellu Cemetery.

==Filmography==
While in the Soviet Union, Istrati wrote a screenplay based on his own work entitled, &quot;The Bandits&quot;, a project that was never completed.

&quot;Kira Kiralina&quot; was filmed in 1927 as a silent film in Soviet Ukraine, produced by VUFKU. The novel was filmed for a second time in 1993, as a Romanian-Hungarian production directed by Gyula Maár. A third production, the Dan Pița-directed &quot;Kira Kiralina&quot;, appeared in 2014. There is also a 1958 Franco–Romanian film, &quot;Ciulinii Bărăganului&quot;, and &quot;Codine&quot; (&quot;Codin&quot;), a Franco–Romanian co-production of 1962.

<doc id="591585" wikidata="Q1066467" url="?curid=591585" title="WCW World Heavyweight Championship">
<text>The WCW World Heavyweight Championship was a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship originally used in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and later, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It was the original world title of the World Championship Wrestling promotion, spun off from the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. It existed in WCW from 1991 to 2001.

Following the acquisition of WCW by the WWF in March 2001, it became one of two world titles in the WWF, with its name being immediately abbreviated to the WCW Championship and finally, the World Championship in November. It continued to complement the then-WWF Championship until the following month, when both titles were unified to create the Undisputed WWF Championship.

Ric Flair was the first holder of the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, with Chris Jericho being the last. The title was the second to be represented by the historic Big Gold Belt, first introduced in 1986.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
In November 1988, Turner Broadcasting purchased Jim Crockett Promotions, which had promoted under the name &quot;NWA World Championship Wrestling&quot;. While the promotion remained a member of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), the use of the NWA name was gradually reduced on televised programming, in favor of the name &quot;World Championship Wrestling&quot;, or &quot;WCW&quot;. On January 11, 1991, Ric Flair defeated Sting to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and was recognized as the WCW World Heavyweight Champion. The new championship was not initially represented by its own title belt, and WCW continued to use the NWA World Heavyweight Championship title belt. Because of this, WCW regularly claimed the NWA World Heavyweight Championship lineage for its own championship.

=== Separate championship ===
On July 1, 1991, a creative disagreement with WCW Executive Vice President Jim Herd led to Flair leaving WCW for Vince McMahon&#x27;s World Wrestling Federation. When Herd refused to return Flair&#x27;s $25,000 deposit (that was left with the NWA), Flair kept the &quot;Big Gold Belt&quot; that had represented the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. A new belt was ordered, but was not ready in time for The Great American Bash on July 14. WCW was forced to use a belt owned by Dusty Rhodes from the defunct Championship Wrestling from Florida with a gold-colored plate tacked on with the words &quot;WCW World Heavyweight Champion&quot;, which was awarded to Lex Luger after he defeated Barry Windham in a cage match for the vacant championship. The new belt appeared shortly after the event.

In 1992, the Big Gold Belt was used for the revived NWA World Heavyweight Championship, a co-promotional gimmick between WCW and New Japan Pro-Wrestling. Masahiro Chono won the G1 Climax in 1992 defeating Rick Rude in the finals while also having a broken neck in the process. Then in 1993 On January 4, The Great Muta won the NWA World Heavyweight title defeating Masahiro Chono, but eventually dropped it to Barry Windham at SuperBrawl III. Then at the &quot;WCW Disney tapings&quot;, it was revealed that WCW had been changing titles around without the NWA agreeing on it, making it a breach of contract. In September 1993, WCW left the NWA for good over a dispute regarding the other NWA members demanding that NWA world champion be available for booking, and due to the use of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on syndicated programming recorded months in advance. By fall 1993, Rick Rude was appearing at the &quot;Disney tapings&quot; as the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, despite the fact that in regards to the storyline, Flair, who had returned to WCW and regained the NWA title, was still champion. After leaving the NWA, WCW kept the Big Gold Belt, and it was renamed the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship.

=== Unification ===
At Starrcade in December 1993, Flair won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, by defeating Vader. WCW decided to unify the WCW World Heavyweight Championship (represented by the new belt) and International Championship (represented by the &quot;Big Gold Belt&quot;), by having Flair wrestle Sting in June 1994. Flair won and unified the WCW World Heavyweight Championship with the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship. The unified championship retained the lineage of the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, while the International Championship was retired. The belt design used from mid-1991 to mid-1994 to represent the WCW World Heavyweight Championship was dropped in favor of keeping the &quot;Big Gold Belt&quot;, which had originally represented the title when it was established in January 1991.

During Hollywood Hogan&#x27;s runs as champion in 1996–1997 and again in 1998–1999 (ie from his second to his fifth reign as champion), as part of the New World Order (nWo) storyline, the title was spray painted each time with the &quot;nWo&quot; initials in black and often announced during Hogan&#x27;s title defenses as the nWo/WCW World Heavyweight Championship, while referred to by nWo members only as the nWo World Heavyweight Championship. Similarly, red paint was used for the nWo Wolfpack.

=== Acquisition by the WWF ===

In March 2001, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) purchased the assets of WCW. Soon after, &quot;The Invasion&quot; took place and four of WCW&#x27;s championships were defended on WWF programming including the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which became known as the &quot;WCW Championship&quot;. The WWF also utilized the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship, WCW Cruiserweight Championship, and the WCW Tag Team Championship.

After the &quot;Invasion&quot; concluded at Survivor Series in 2001, the title was rebranded as the &quot;World Championship&quot;, making The Rock 
the last person to hold the title while it was named as the WCW Championship. The title was then unified with the WWF Championship at Vengeance, where Chris Jericho defeated The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin to win the World Championship and the WWF Championship, respectively. As a result, Jericho was the last holder of the championship title, and he became the first Undisputed WWF Champion. The Big Gold belt itself would be used in tandem with the WWF Championship belt to represent the WWF Championship until a single belt was presented to then champion Triple H by Ric Flair in April 2002.

== Reigns ==
The inaugural champion was Ric Flair, and there were 61 different champions overall. The longest reigning champion was Hulk Hogan who held the title from July 17, 1994, to October 29, 1995, for a total of 469 days. Hogan holds the record for longest combined reigns at 1,177 days. Ric Flair has the shortest title reign, having won it and lost it on the same night on May 29, 2000. The Giant was youngest champion, at the age of 23. The oldest champion was Ric Flair who won at the age of 51. Flair held the title the most times with seven championship reigns. There were twelve vacancies throughout the title&#x27;s history.

Chris Jericho was the final champion in his second reign. He defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin at Vengeance in San Diego, California on December 9, 2001 to unify the WWF and World Championships; thus becoming the first Undisputed WWF Champion. Jericho would lose the undisputed title to Triple H at WrestleMania X8 and the Big Gold Belt continued to appear until the April 1, 2002 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

== Notes ==

In WCW, Flair was recognized as an eight-time champion but WWE only recognizes 6, counting his first reign as one of his 8 NWA title reigns and ignoring a title vacancy that occurred in 1994 and instead viewing that as one continuous reign.

<doc id="591587" wikidata="Q2394548" url="?curid=591587" title="Hurewicz theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Hurewicz theorem is a basic result of algebraic topology, connecting homotopy theory with homology theory via a map known as the Hurewicz homomorphism. The theorem is named after Witold Hurewicz, and generalizes earlier results of Henri Poincaré.

==Statement of the theorems==
The Hurewicz theorems are a key link between homotopy groups and homology groups.

===Absolute version===
For any path-connected space &quot;X&quot; and positive integer &quot;n&quot; there exists a group homomorphism

:formula_1

called the Hurewicz homomorphism, from the &quot;n&quot;-th homotopy group to the &quot;n&quot;-th homology group (with integer coefficients). It is given in the following way: choose a canonical generator formula_2, then a homotopy class of maps formula_3 is taken to formula_4.

The Hurewicz theorem states cases in which the Hurewicz homomorphism is an isomorphism.

* For formula_5, if &quot;X&quot; is formula_6-connected (that is: formula_7 for all formula_8), then formula_9 for all formula_8, and the Hurewicz map formula_11 is an isomorphism. This implies, in particular, that the homological connectivity equals the homotopical connectivity when the latter is at least 1. In addition, the Hurewicz map formula_12 is an epimorphism in this case.
* For formula_13, the Hurewicz homomorphism induces an isomorphism formula_14, between the abelianization of the first homotopy group (the fundamental group) and the first homology group.

===Relative version===
For any pair of spaces formula_15 and integer formula_16 there exists a homomorphism

:formula_17

from relative homotopy groups to relative homology groups. The Relative Hurewicz Theorem states that if both formula_18 and formula_19 are connected and the pair is formula_6-connected then formula_21 for formula_22 and formula_23 is obtained from formula_24 by factoring out the action of formula_25. This is proved in, for example, by induction, proving in turn the absolute version and the Homotopy Addition Lemma.

This relative Hurewicz theorem is reformulated by as a statement about the morphism 

:formula_26

where formula_27 denotes the cone of formula_19. This statement is a special case of a homotopical excision theorem, involving induced modules for formula_29 (crossed modules if formula_30), which itself is deduced from a higher homotopy van Kampen theorem for relative homotopy groups, whose proof requires development of techniques of a cubical higher homotopy groupoid of a filtered space.

===Triadic version===
For any triad of spaces formula_31 (i.e., a space &quot;X&quot; and subspaces &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) and integer formula_32 there exists a homomorphism

:formula_33

from triad homotopy groups to triad homology groups. Note that 

:formula_34

The Triadic Hurewicz Theorem states that if &quot;X&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and formula_35 are connected, the pairs formula_36 and formula_37 are formula_38-connected and formula_39-connected, respectively, and the triad formula_31 is formula_41-connected, then formula_42 for formula_43 is obtained from formula_44 by factoring out the action of formula_45 and the generalised Whitehead products. The proof of this theorem uses a higher homotopy van Kampen type theorem for triadic homotopy groups, which requires a notion of the fundamental formula_46-group of an &quot;n&quot;-cube of spaces.

===Simplicial set version===
The Hurewicz theorem for topological spaces can also be stated for &quot;n&quot;-connected simplicial sets satisfying the Kan condition.

===Rational Hurewicz theorem===

Rational Hurewicz theorem: Let &quot;X&quot; be a simply connected topological space with formula_47 for formula_48. Then the Hurewicz map 

:formula_49

induces an isomorphism for formula_50 and a surjection for formula_51.

<text>Father Francesco de Vico (also known as de Vigo, De Vico and even DeVico; 19 May 1805 in Macerata – 15 November 1848 in London) was an Italian astronomer and a Jesuit priest.

==Biography==
He was educated at the college of Urbino, and became in 1835 assistant superintendent, and in 1839 director of the Vatican Observatory. The Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states cut short his observing career, as he was forced into exile, touring Paris, London, and the United States, where he was received by the President. He was pleased with his reception in the U.S. and wished to settle there at Georgetown College, but first returned to Europe to try to recruit some colleagues to join him and purchase instruments for an observatory to be erected under his direction in New York. Unfortunately, worn out from the travel, he died in London in November of that same year

==Work==
He found a remarkable number of comets in a relatively short time, including periodic comets 54P/de Vico-Swift-NEAT and 122P/de Vico. He also independently discovered the comet (C/1847 T1) that brought fame to Maria Mitchell as &quot;Miss Mitchell&#x27;s Comet&quot;, two days after she did. The news did not reach Europe before Father De Vico announced his observation, so it was initially named for him. He received the award from the Danish king, who had offered a prize for the first comet discovered through a telescope (prior to this time, all comet discoveries were ones that could be seen by the unaided eye). Mitchell was later recognized and awarded a medal as well.

He also made observations of Saturn and the gaps in its rings (he was the first to see the narrow division in the rings of Saturn now known as the Keeler Gap after James Keeler). He was noted for his studies of spots on Venus, and unsuccessfully attempted to determine its rotation period.

He began an ambitious project to compile an atlas of stars down to 11th magnitude.

He was also a composer of church music.

The lunar crater De Vico and the asteroid 20103 de Vico are named after him.

<text>The lira (, plural: liri, ISO 4217 code: &quot;MTL&quot;) or pound (until ca. 1986 in English, code ) was the currency of Malta from 1972 until 31 December 2007. One lira was divided into 100 cents, each of 10 mils. After 1986 the lira was abbreviated as Lm, although the original sign continued to be used unofficially. In English the currency was still frequently called the &quot;pound&quot; even after its official English language name was changed to &quot;lira&quot;.

The euro replaced the lira as the official currency of Malta on 1 January 2008 at the irrevocable fixed exchange rate of €1 per Lm 0.4293, or approximately €2.33 per Lm 1.

==History==
===Sterling===

In 1825, an imperial order-in-council introduced sterling coinage to Malta, replacing a system under which various coinages circulated, including that issued in Malta by the Knights of St John. The pound was valued at 12 &quot;scudi&quot; of the local currency. This exchange rate meant that the smallest Maltese coin, the &quot;grano&quot;, was worth one third of a farthing (1 scudo = 20 tari = 240 grani). Consequently, -farthing (-penny) coins were issued for use in Malta until 1913, alongside the regular sterling coinage. Amongst the British colonies which used sterling coinage, Malta was unique in issuing a -farthing coin.

Between 1914 and 1918, wartime emergency paper money issues were made by the government.

Until 1972, the pound was divided into 20 shillings, each of 12 pence with 4 farthings to the penny; from May 1972 it was decimalised into 100 cents, and each cent into 10 mils.

Pre-decimal sterling coinage continued to circulate in Malta for nearly a year after it was withdrawn in the UK due to decimalisation as Malta did not decimalise until 1972. Although the Maltese pound was initially equal to its sterling counterpart, this parity did not survive long after the floating of sterling on 22 June 1972.

====Banknotes====

Emergency issues between 1914 and 1918 were in denominations of 5 and 10 shillings, £1, £5 and £10. In 1940, notes dated 13 September 1939 in denominations of 2/6, 5/–, 10/– and £1 were issued, followed late in the year by a provisional 1/– note overprinted on old 2/– notes dated 20 November 1918. Note production continued after the Second World War in denominations of 10/- and £1, with £5 notes reintroduced between 1961 and 1963.

After the Central Bank of Malta was established by the Central Bank Act of 1967 and began operating on April 17, 1968, the issuing body named on the banknotes switched from &quot;Government of Malta&quot; to &quot;Central Bank of Malta.&quot; While the designs of the notes remained unchanged, the colors were changed. The Central Bank refers to this series as the &quot;CBM first series&quot;. The CBM second series began with the introduction of lira-denominated notes on January 15, 1973.

===Lira===

Banknotes issued by the Government of Malta and then by the Central Bank of Malta were written in English up to 1972. From 1973 to 1985, they were written in Maltese on the obverse (with the currency identified as &quot;lira&quot;), and in English on the reverse (identifying the currency as &quot;pound&quot;). From 1986 to 2007, Maltese was used on both sides.

Although exclusively using British coins at that time, Malta did not decimalise with the UK in 1971. Instead, decimalisation occurred a year later, on the &quot;pound and mil&quot; system, dividing the pound into 1,000 mils and 100 cents. The Maltese name &quot;lira&quot; and the English name &quot;pound&quot; were used concurrently on banknotes until 1986, when &quot;lira&quot; became the official name of the currency in both languages. Mil denominated coins were removed from circulation in 1994.

On entry into the European Union, Malta agreed to adopt the euro. The lira was replaced by the euro on 1 January 2008, as part of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union.

===Euro changeover===

The Maltese lira was replaced by the euro as the official currency of Malta at the irrevocable fixed exchange rate of Lm 0.429300 per €1.
However, Maltese lira banknotes and coins continued to have legal tender status and were accepted for cash payments until 31 January 2008. Maltese lira were convertible free of charge at all Maltese credit institutions until 30 March 2008.
Maltese coins were convertible at the Central Bank of Malta until 1 February 2010, and banknotes remained convertible until 31 January 2018.

==Exchange rate==

Since the Maltese currency was considered a local issue of sterling rather than an entirely separate currency until 13 December 1971, the two currencies maintained an exact 1:1 equivalence with each other. Afterwards, the Maltese currency was allowed to float, anchored to a basket of reserve currencies. The lira had subsequently been worth around GBP 1.60. After the Kuwaiti dinar, it was the second-highest-valued currency unit in the world, being worth US$3.1596 as of 28 April 2007. After the dollar weakened against other currencies in mid-2006, the lira was worth US$3.35289 as of 16 December 2007.

The currency entered the ERM II on 2 May 2005, by which its value had to be maintained within a 15% band around the central parity rate of Lm 0.429300 per euro. The Central Bank of Malta and Maltese Government unilaterally decided to keep the actual Lm/€ exchange rate equal to the central parity rate (i.e., doing away with the 15% band) throughout the ERM II period.

The irrevocable fixed conversion rate was established by the ECOFIN on 10 July 2007, at Lm 0.4293 to one euro.

==Coins==


Decimal coinage was introduced in 1972 (one year after the United Kingdom) based on the &quot;pound and mil&quot; system proposed in 1855 by Sir William Brown MP in denominations of 2, 3, and 5 mils, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 50 cents. There was no one-mil coin, although, the coins that were provided (2m, 3m, and 5m) allowed goods to be priced (and change given) for any number of mils. In 1975, a 25c coin was introduced.

A new coinage was issued in 1986 in denominations of 1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 25c and 50c and Lm 1. A third series was introduced in 1991 due to the change in Malta&#x27;s coat of arms. The mils were withdrawn in 1994, although for some time only the 5 mils had been seen (and then only rarely).

==Banknotes==

On 15 January 1973, banknotes were introduced, denominated in liri on the obverse and pounds on the reverse, in denominations of £M 1, £M 5 and £M 10. In 1986, £M1 notes were replaced by coins and Lm 2 and Lm 20 notes were introduced.

Banknotes of the fourth series were:

Banknotes in circulation at the time of the introduction of the euro were:

<doc id="591597" wikidata="Q190326" url="?curid=591597" title="Viola tricolor">
<text>Viola tricolor is a common European wild flower, growing as an annual or short-lived perennial. The species is also known as wild pansy, Johnny Jump up (though this name is also applied to similar species such as the yellow pansy), heartsease, heart&#x27;s ease, heart&#x27;s delight, tickle-my-fancy, Jack-jump-up-and-kiss-me, come-and-cuddle-me, three faces in a hood, love-in-idleness, and pink of my john.

It has been introduced into North America, where it has spread. It is the progenitor of the cultivated pansy, and is therefore sometimes called wild pansy; before the cultivated pansies were developed, &quot;pansy&quot; was an alternative name for the wild form. It can produce up to 50 seeds at a time. The flowers can be purple, blue, yellow or white.

==Description==

&quot;Viola tricolor&quot; is a small plant of creeping and ramping habit, reaching at most in height, with flowers about in diameter. Its root is of the rhizome type with fine rootlets. The stem (acoli stem: which remains flush with the soil and from which leave the leaves and the flowering stalk) is hairless, sometimes downy and is branched. The plant has no leaf rosette at the base, unlike some other violets, such as Viola hirta. Leaves are, on the contrary, alternate. They are stalked at limbus oval, oblong or lanceolate and more or less serrated margins. The stipules are often quite developed, at least those of the upper leaves. These stipules are palm-lined or palmatised.

The flowers are solitary and lateral, hoisted on long peduncles. They appear on aerial stems with more or less long internodes. The sepals are never larger than the corolla. It is long. This corolla can be purple, blue, yellow or white. It can most often be two-tone, yellow and purple. The tricolor shape, yellow, white and purple, is the most sought after.

It flowers from April to September (in the Northern Hemisphere). The plants are hermaphroditic and self-fertile, pollinated by bees.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is common almost everywhere on the Eurasian continent, near the sea or inland, at altitudes ranging from 0 to . It grows in open grasslands, wastelands, mainly on acidic or neutral soils and usually in partial shade. It is also found on the banks and in the alluviums.

==Ecology==
In Iceland, &quot;Viola tricolor&quot; is known to be a host for at least two species of plant pathogenic fungi, &quot;Pleospora herbarum&quot; and &quot;Ramularia agrestis&quot;.

==Uses==

As an ornamental and medicinal plant, the wild pansy has been cultivated since the Middle Ages and bred in Britain since 1810. As some of its names imply, &quot;V. tricolor&quot; and other plants in the &quot;Viola&quot; genus (such as &quot;V. odorata&quot;, or sweet violet), have a long history of use in herbalism and folk medicine, particularly Iranian, Greco-Arab, Ayurvedic and Unani traditional health systems. Traditionally, it has been used to treat cardiovascular conditions, epilepsy, skin diseases, burns and eczema, and as an expectorant for respiratory problems such as bronchitis, asthma, and cold symptoms, and modern research has begun to corroborate these traditionally held knowledges and uses. 

Studies have shown &quot;V. tricolor&quot; extract has antinociceptive, immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential treatment for autoimmune disorders. The extract is known to be antimicrobial, sedative, antiepileptic, and diuretic, as well as potentially antiviral and antiprotozoal. &quot;V. tricolor L&quot; extract has shown vasorelaxant, cardio-relaxant, hypotensive, and cardio protective effects. Some studies have discovered potential anti-cancer properties, where the extract (primarily the ethyl acetate component) has been attributed to induced apoptosis and inhibited angiogenesis in cancer cells. The seeds and roots, and to a lesser extent the flowers and stems, are also a known emetic and purgative/laxative, and should be used with caution.

The ancient Chinese used the plant as medicine, and the Celts and Romans made perfumes of them.

The flowers have also been used to make yellow, green and blue-green dyes, while the leaves can be used to indicate acidity.

=== Biochemistry ===
The plant, especially the flowers, contains antioxidants, has low toxicity, and is edible. 

&quot;V tricolor&quot; leaves, stems, roots and flowers have been found to contain antioxidants and flavonoids (including violanthin, violaquercitrin, quercetin, luteolin, and rutin), amino acids, chlorogenic acids, salicylates, as well as alkaloids, volatile oils, mucilage gums, resin, saponins, and vitamins A and C. Various carotenoids have also been isolated from the drug, including violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin and beta-Carotene. 

The fresh plant &quot;Viola declinata&quot; and &quot;V. tricolor&quot; contains approximately: 
*saponins (4.40%), 
*mucilages (10.26%),
*total carotenoids (8.45 mg/100g vegetal product, expressed in β-carotene).

Its 10 percent mucilages consist of glucose, galactose, arabinose and rhamnose, as well as tannins, salicylic acid, and its derivatives.

Anthocyanidins and coumarins, such as umbelliferone, were also detected in Viola tricolor. 

Extracts from the plant are anti-microbial. 

Heartsease contains compounds, including colorless crystalline compounds, proven to be useful in prophylaxis and treatment of some medical conditions (see Traditional and Medicinal Uses section), such as cardiovascular problems, complications of diabetes, inflammations, immune disorders, and liver problems, among other indications.

Heartsease plants contain aglycones apigenin, chrysoeriol, isorhamnetin, kaempferol. &quot;V. tricolor&quot; is one of many viola plant species containing cyclotides. These small peptides have proven to be useful in drug development due to their size and structure giving rise to high stability. Many cyclotides found in &quot;Viola tricolor&quot; are cytotoxic. This feature means it could be used to treat cancers.

==In culture==

According to Roman mythology, the wild pansy turned into the Love-in-idleness as Cupid shot one of his arrows at the imperial votaress, but missed and instead struck it. As Cupid is the god of desire, affection and erotic love, the flower&#x27;s juice received the trait, to act as a love potion. Its name relates to the use of the flower, as it is often used for idleness or vileness acts.

According to Greek mythology, Zeus fell in love with a young woman named Io and provoked jealousy to his wife Hera. He transformed the girl into a heifer and kept her grazing at his feet. For pity on the diet of herbs to which he submitted the beloved, he caused the earth to produce beautiful flowers that he called Io. Another Greek legend has it that the delicate white flowers were worshiped by Eros. To inhibit this worship, Aphrodite colored them, which resulted in tricolor coloration.

No. 1 of &quot;3 Lyrics&quot;, H. 161, written for piano in 1921 by British composer Frank Bridge, is called &quot;Heart&#x27;s Ease&quot;.

=== Literature ===

Long before cultivated pansies were released into the trade in 1839, &quot;V. tricolor&quot; was associated with thought in the &quot;language of flowers&quot;, often by its alternative name of &quot;pansy&quot; (from the French &quot;pensée&quot;, &quot;thought&quot;): hence Ophelia&#x27;s often quoted line in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s pansies, that&#x27;s for thoughts&quot;. (What Shakespeare had in mind was &quot;V. tricolor&quot;, the wild pansy, not a modern garden pansy.)

===&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;===
Shakespeare makes a more direct reference, probably to &quot;V. tricolor&quot; in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Oberon sends Puck to gather &quot;a little western flower that maidens call love-in-idleness&quot;. Oberon&#x27;s account is that he diverted an arrow from Cupid&#x27;s bow aimed at &quot;a fair vestal, throned by the west&quot; (supposedly Queen Elizabeth I) to fall upon the plant &quot;before milk-white, now purple with love&#x27;s wound&quot;. The &quot;imperial vot&#x27;ress&quot; passes on &quot;fancy-free&quot;, destined never to fall in love.

In Act II and III, Oberon&#x27;s and Puck&#x27;s intervention with the magic love potion of the flower, they can control the fates of various characters, but also speed up the process of falling in and out of love, so that the actual romances of the lovers and their love itself appears to become very comical. Shakespeare uses the flower to provide the essential dramatic and comical features for his play. Besides that the love potion gained from the flower, does not only interfere with the lovers&#x27; fates, but also gives the play structure as it affects the lovers&#x27; romances drastically, as it at first upsets the balance of love and creates asymmetrical love among the four Athenian lovers. The fact that this flower introduces magical love to this play creates the potential for many possible outcomes for this play.

The juice of the &quot;heartsease&quot; now, claims Oberon, &quot;on sleeping eyelids laid, Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees.&quot; Equipped with such powers, Oberon and Puck control the fates of various characters in the play to provide Shakespeare&#x27;s essential dramatic and comic structure for the play.
The love-in-idleness was originally a white flower, struck by one of Cupid&#x27;s arrows, which turned it purple and gave it its magic love potion. When dripped onto someone&#x27;s eyelids this love potion causes an individual to fall madly in love with the next person they see. In &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, William Shakespeare uses this flower as a plot device to introduce the comical disturbance and chaos of love, but also to highlight the irrationality of romantic love. Here love is depicted as a sort of benevolent affliction. Shakespeare presents love to be something contradicting to one&#x27;s normal feelings and ideas. However he also depicts the fact that those can lead to foolish and hurtful things and present the idea that love can also end in tragedy. The play shows that love can be a source of comedy as easily as of tragedy and therefore show that the power that the love potion from the Love-in-idleness inherits is beyond the comprehension of the fairies and mortals. In the end, the love-in-idleness nectar is used to restore all romances in the play to their original states (including Demetrius&#x27;s prior affections for Helena before he turned to Hermia.)

The effects of the love-in-idleness can be very dramatic and tragic, no matter if the intentions were right. The play reaches its point at which Demetrius and Lysander are trying to kill one another. Although Hermia and Helena are not trying to kill one another, they are suffering from the rejection of their lovers and from considerable verbal abuse. However, this still happens at a very comical level, for the lovers are not aware of their situation. The more they try to present the dramatic side of love, the hate, jealousy and anger, the less they become serious, and so their anger turns unreal. In the end, love is not denied and the lovers are reunited. Nevertheless, Shakespeare ends the lovers&#x27; story as a comedy, with the inclusion of several tragic and dramatic moments. This is supposed to show that love can be a source of comedy as easily as of tragedy, and therefore show that the power that the love potion from the love-in-idleness inherits is beyond the comprehension of fairies and mortals alike.

===&quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;===
Shakespeare mentions it in his play &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; where Luciento claims he found the effect of love-in-idleness - alluding to its qualities to simulate the effects of love.

===&quot;Balm in Gilead&quot;===
In her poem &quot;Balm in Gilead&quot;, Christina Georgina Rossetti uses heartsease as a metaphor of growing older as her confidence and her vision increases. The heartsease is known as love-lies-bleeding which is a type of the inseparability of the pain of living and the love of Christ. The garden was adorned with the flower which served as the speaker&#x27;s life. The &quot;weed&quot; represents the sins of the speaker&#x27;s life. However at the end, the speaker pleads her pain and waits her judgment.

Heartsease I found, where Love-lies-bleeding

 Empurpled all the ground:

Whatever flowers I missed unheeding,

 Heartsease I found.

 Yet still my garden mound

Stood sore in need of watering, weeding,

 And binding growths unbound.

Ah, when shades fell to light succeeding

 I scarcely dared look round:

&#x27;Love-lies-bleeding&#x27; was all my pleading,

 Heartsease I found.

<doc id="591604" wikidata="Q4743760" url="?curid=591604" title="American Federation of Teachers">
<text>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is the second largest teacher&#x27;s labor union in America (the largest being the National Education Association). The union was founded in Chicago. John Dewey and Margaret Haley were founders.

About 60 percent of AFT&#x27;s membership works directly in education, with the remainder of the union&#x27;s members composed of paraprofessionals and school-related personnel; local, state and federal employees; higher education faculty and staff, and nurses and other healthcare professionals. The AFT has, since its founding, affiliated with trade union federations: until 1955 the American Federation of Labor, and now the AFL–CIO.

==History==
AFT was founded in Chicago, Illinois, on April 15, 1916. Charles Stillman was the first president and Margaret Haley was the national organizer. On May 9, 1916, the American Federation of Labor chartered the AFT. By 1919, AFT had 100 local affiliates and a membership of approximately 11,000 teachers, which amounted to 1.5% of the nation&#x27;s teaching force. In its early days, AFT distinguished itself from the National Education Association (NEA) by its exclusion of school administrators from membership. Facing opposition from politicians and boards of education, membership in AFT declined to 7,000 by 1930. During this period, the organization had little impact on local or national education policy.

AFT membership climbed during the Great Depression, reaching 33,000 by 1939. During the 1930s, AFT, whose members had historically been primary school teachers, saw influential college professors join the union. Also during the 1930s, the Communist Party gained influence within the AFT. In 1941, under pressure from the AFL, the union ejected three local unions in New York City and Philadelphia (including its prominent early member, the New York City Teachers Union, AFT Local 5) for being communist-dominated. The charter revocations represented nearly a third of the union&#x27;s national membership.

The 1940s were marked by a series of teacher strikes, including 57 strikes that occurred from 1946 through 1949. By 1947, AFT had a membership of 42,000. The 1960s and 1970s also saw numerous teacher strikes, including 1,000 strikes involving more than 823,000 teachers between 1960 and 1974.

AFT membership was 59,000 in 1960, 200,000 in 1970, and 550,000 in 1980. In 2017, membership was around 1.6 million, and the union had due income of $35 million.

Since 1977, AFT has published a quarterly magazine for teachers covering various issues about children and education called &quot;American Educator&quot;. In 1998, the membership of the NEA rejected a proposed merger with AFT. The AFT&#x27;s membership is half that of the NEA.

==Presidents of the AFT==
;Albert Shanker
In 1974, Albert Shanker was elected president of AFT. He served in this role until his death on February 22, 1997. For 27 years, Shanker wrote a weekly column entitled &quot;Where We Stand&quot; that ran as an advertisement in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Shanker was an early advocate of charter schools. He also called for a national competency test for teachers, merit pay for teachers, and more rigorous requirements for high school graduation. During his tenure as AFT president, Shanker was jailed twice for leading illegal strikes.

;Sandra Feldman
Sandra Feldman served as AFT&#x27;s president from 1997 to 2004. Feldman helped craft the No Child Left Behind Act.

;Edward J. McElroy
Edward J. McElroy, the AFT&#x27;s secretary-treasurer since 1992, was elected president of the AFT in 2004, replacing Feldman. On February 12, 2008, McElroy announced he would retire at the union&#x27;s regularly scheduled biennial convention in July. On July 14, 2008, Randi Weingarten was elected to succeed him.

;Randi Weingarten
On July 14, 2008, Randi Weingarten, then the president of the United Federation of Teachers, was elected to succeed McElroy as AFT president. In September 2008, she announced the launch of the AFT Innovation Fund, a union-led, private foundation-supported effort to provide grants to AFT unions to develop and implement innovations in education. In 2014, Weingarten announced that AFT was ending a five-year funding relationship between the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the AFT Innovation Fund.

==Political activities==
Since 1980, AFT and the NEA have contributed nearly $57.4 million to federal campaigns, an amount that is about 30 percent higher than any single corporation or other union. About 95 percent of political donations from teachers unions have gone to Democrats.

In 2008, AFT provided a campaign contribution of $1,784,808.59 to Hillary Clinton and $1,997,375.00 to Barack Obama.

In July 2015, AFT endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. Clinton and AFT president Randi Weingarten are longtime friends. AFT&#x27;s official endorsement of Clinton caused controversy among some AFT members who felt that the endorsement came too soon and did not reflect the wishes of rank-and-file AFT members, some of whom supported Bernie Sanders.

Members&#x27; dues underwrite much of AFT&#x27;s political activities. In 2015, four California teachers sued AFT and its California unit, the California Federation of Teachers, over the use of member dues for political activities. The plaintiffs argued that unions were violating their constitutional right to free speech by forcing them to either support union-favored causes and candidates or lose access to important job benefits such as disability and life insurance.

In 2018, the landmark Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Janus v. AFSCME&quot; resolved this matter, concluding that public sector union fees violate the First Amendment, compelling nonmembers to &quot;subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern&quot;. Unions will, subsequently, need to gain the affirmative consent of individual teachers before enrolling them in the union.

==Activities==

===Race relations===
The AFT was one of the first trade unions to allow African-Americans and minorities to become full members of their trade union. In 1918, the AFT called for equal pay for African-American teachers, the election of African Americans to local school boards and compulsory school attendance for African-American children. In 1919, the AFT called for equal educational opportunities for African-American children, and in 1928 called for the social, political, economic, and cultural contributions of African Americans to be taught in the public schools.

In 1951, the union stopped chartering segregated locals. It filed an amicus brief in the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court desegregation case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. In 1957, the AFT expelled all locals that refused to desegregate. This resulted in the loss of over 7,000 members. In 1963, the AFT actively supported the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

===Collective bargaining===
By the late 1940s, AFT was slowly moving toward collective bargaining as an official policy. By the end of the 1970s, collective bargaining agreements covered 72% of public school teachers.

===Active shooter drills===
In 2020, the union along with the National Education Association issued a report expressing opposition to active shooter drills being held in schools, calling on the drills to be revised or eliminated.

=== Share My Lesson ===
In 2012, AFT partnered with Britain&#x27;s TES Connect to create a curriculum sharing website called Share My Lesson. The AFT and TES invested $10 million to develop the site.

==Criticism==
In 2010, four American film documentaries, most notably &quot;Waiting for Superman&quot;, portrayed the AFT as hurting children by opposing charter schools and protecting incompetent teachers.

<text>The Dalit Buddhist movement is a religious as well as a socio-political movement among Dalits in India which was started by B. R. Ambedkar. He re-interpreted Buddhism and created a new school of Buddhism called Navayana. The movement has sought to be a socially and politically engaged form of Buddhism.

The movement was launched in 1956 by Ambedkar when nearly half a million Dalits – formerly untouchables – joined him and converted to Navayana Buddhism. It rejected Hinduism, challenged the caste system in India and promoted the rights of the Dalit community. The movement also rejected the teachings of Mahayana, Theravada and Vajrayana traditions of Buddhism; instead, the movement claims to be a form of engaged Buddhism as taught by Ambedkar.

== History ==
Buddhism originated in ancient India and grew after Ashoka adopted it. By the 2nd century CE, Buddhism was widespread in India and had expanded outside of India into Central Asia, East Asia and parts of Southeast Asia. During the Middle Ages, Buddhism slowly declined in India, while it vanished from Persia and Central Asia as Islam became the state religion.

According to Randall Collins, Buddhism was already declining in India by the 12th century, but with the pillage by Muslim invaders it nearly became extinct in India. In the 13th century, states Craig Lockard, Buddhist monks in India fled to Tibet to escape Islamic persecution, while the monks in western India, states Peter Harvey, escaped persecution by moving to south Indian Hindu kingdoms that were able to resist the Muslim power.

Efforts to revive Buddhism in India began in the 19th century, such as with the efforts of Sri Lankan Buddhist leader Anagarika Dharmapala who founded the Maha Bodhi Society. The Maha Bodhi Society, according to Bhagwan Das, was not a Dalit movement however, because it mainly attracted lower-caste Hindus to Buddhism.

===Northern India===

The two Adi Dharma movements – those that rejected Hinduism in favor of Buddhism – were launched by the Swami Achhutanand Harihar in Uttar Pradesh and Babu Mangu Ram in Punjab.

Born in an untouchable family, Achhutanand joined the Arya Samaj &quot;suddhi&quot; reform movement and worked there for about eight years (1905–1912). He felt Arya Samaj practiced untouchability in subtle ways, and subsequently left it to launch the socio-political Bharitiya Achhut Mahasabha movement. Achhutanand published the Adi-Hindu magazine, wherein he called on Dalits to return to Adi-Dharma as the &quot;original religion of Indians.&quot; Achhutanand formulated his philosophy on the basis of a shared cultural and ethnic identity. He presented it to an audience beyond just Dalits, including tribal societies as well. He opposed Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s non-cooperation movement and fasts as well as the Indian National Congress, stating that Brahmins were &quot;as foreign to India as were the British&quot;, according to Anand Teltumbde.

Babu Mangu Ram was also born in an untouchable family of Punjab with a flourishing leather trade. Mangu Ram arrived in the United States in 1909 at the age of 23 and worked in California. There, he joined the Ghadar Party and smuggled weapons from California to India in order to oppose British rule. In 1925, he shifted his focus onto Dalit freedom, launching the &quot;Ad Dharm&quot; movement as well as a weekly newspaper titled Adi-Danka to spread his ideas. According to Teltumbde, Mandu Ram&#x27;s religious movement failed to materialize, and Mangu Ram later joined the Ambedkarite movement.

In 1914, Prakash was ordained as a Bodhanand Mahastavir in Calcutta, and began preaching Buddhism in Lucknow. He founded the &quot;Bharatiye Buddh Samiti&quot; in 1916, and set up a vihara in 1928.

===Southern India===
In 1898, Pandit Iyothee Thass founded the Sakya Buddhist Society also known as Indian Buddhist Association in Tamil Nadu. He presented Buddhism as a religious alternative to Hinduism for Dalits. Thass&#x27;s efforts led to the creation of a broader movement amongst Tamil Dalits in South India until the 1950s. The first president of the Indian Buddhist Association was Paul Carus. Unlike the Ambedkarite movement, the Indian Buddhist Association adopted the Theravada Buddhism tradition founded in Sri Lanka (where Thass had received his training and initiation in Buddhism).

==B. R. Ambedkar==
Ambedkar was an Indian leader, influential during the colonial era and post-independence period of India. He belonged to a Dalit community, traditionally the most oppressed and marginalized group in Indian society. He was the fourteenth child in an impoverished Maharashtra Dalit family, who studied abroad, returned to India in the 1920s and joined the political movement. His focus was social and political rights of the Dalits.

During 1931–32, the Mahatma Gandhi led Indian independence movement held discussions with the British government over the Round Table Conferences. They sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians. The British side sought reforms that would keep the Indian subcontinent as a colony. The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions. They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as B. R. Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables. Gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that such a constitution would not bring people together but divide them, perpetuate their status and divert the attention from India&#x27;s struggle to end the colonial rule.

After Gandhi returned from Second Round Table conference, he started a new &quot;satyagraha&quot;. He was immediately arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune. While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate. It came to be known as the Communal Award. In protest, Gandhi started fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison. The resulting public outcry forced the government, in consultations with Ambedkar, to replace the Communal Award with a compromise Poona Pact.

Ambedkar accepted the Poona Pact under public pressure, but disagreed with Gandhi and his political methods. He dismissed Gandhi&#x27;s ideas as loved by &quot;blind Hindu devotees&quot;, primitive, influenced by spurious brew of Tolstoy and Ruskin, and &quot;there is always some simpleton to preach them&quot;.

Ambedkar concluded that Dalits must leave Hinduism and convert to another religion, and announced his intent to leave Hinduism in 1935. He considered Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism and Buddhism. Ambedkar was approached by various leaders of different denominations and faiths. On 22 May 1936, an &quot;All Religious Conference&quot; was held at Lucknow. It was attended by prominent Dalit leaders including Jagjivan Ram, though Ambedkar could not attend it. At the conference, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, and Buddhist representatives presented the tenets of their respective religions in an effort to win over Dalits. Ambedkar rejected the other religions and chose Buddhism. However, Ambedkar remained a Hindu for the next 20 years, studied then re-interpreted Buddhism, and adopted Neo-Buddhism or Navayana few weeks before his death.

The Italian Buddhist monk Lokanatha visited Ambedkar&#x27;s residence at Dadar on 10 June 1936. Later in an interview to the press, Lokanatha said that Ambedkar was impressed with Buddhism.

===Navayana Buddhism===

According to Ambedkar, several of the core beliefs and doctrines of traditional Buddhist traditions such as the Four Noble Truths and Anatta were flawed and pessimistic, and may have been inserted into the Buddhist scriptures by wrong-headed Buddhist monks of a later era. These should not be considered as Buddha&#x27;s teachings in Ambedkar&#x27;s view. Other foundational concepts of Buddhism such as Karma and Rebirth were considered by Ambedkar as superstitions.

Navayana as formulated by Ambedkar and at the root of Dalit Buddhist movement abandons mainstream traditional Buddhist practices and precepts such as the institution of monk after renunciation, ideas such as karma, rebirth in afterlife, samsara, meditation, nirvana and Four Noble Truths. Ambedkar&#x27;s new sect of Buddhism rejected these ideas and re-interpreted the Buddha&#x27;s religion in terms of class struggle and social equality.

Ambedkar called his version of Buddhism Navayana or Neo-Buddhism. His book, &quot;The Buddha and His Dhamma&quot;, is the holy book of Navayana or Dalit Buddhists. According to Junghare, for the followers of Navyana, Ambedkar has become a deity and he is worshipped in its practice.

===Ambedkar&#x27;s conversion===

After publishing a series of books and articles arguing that Buddhism was the only way for the Untouchables to gain equality, Ambedkar publicly converted on 14 October 1956, at Deekshabhoomi, Nagpur, over 20 years after he declared his intent to convert. Around 365,000 of his followers converted to Buddhism at the same ceremony. On this occasion, many upper caste Hindus too accepted Buddhism. After Nagpur, on 16 October 1956, Ambedkar again gave Buddhism to more than 300,000 of his followers at Chandrapur, since the place is also known as Deekshabhoomi. Inspired by this Ambedkar&#x27;s conversion, 5,000 Tamils of Myanmar had accepted Buddhism in Rangoon under the leadership of Chan Htoon, the justice of the Supreme Court of the Union of Burma on 28 October 1956.

The conversion ceremony was attended by Medharathi, his main disciple Bhoj Dev Mudit, and Mahastvir Bodhanand&#x27;s Sri Lankan successor, Bhante Pragyanand. Ambedkar asked Dalits not to get entangled in the existing branches of Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana), and called his version Navayana or &#x27;Neo-Buddhism&#x27;. Ambedkar would die less than two months later, just after finishing his definitive work on Buddhism.

Many Dalits employ the term &quot;Ambedkar(ite) Buddhism&quot; to designate the Buddhist movement, which started with Ambedkar&#x27;s conversion. Many converted people call themselves &quot;-Bauddha&quot; i.e. Buddhists.

===Twenty-two vows===
== After Ambedkar&#x27;s death==
The Buddhist movement was somewhat hindered by Ambedkar&#x27;s death so shortly after his conversion. It did not receive the immediate mass support from the Untouchable population that Ambedkar had hoped for. Division and lack of direction among the leaders of the Ambedkarite movement have been an additional impediment. According to the 2011 census, there are currently 8.44 million Buddhists in India, at least 6.5 million of whom are Marathi Buddhists in Maharashtra. This makes Buddhism the fifth-largest religion in India and 6% of the population of Maharashtra, but less than 1% of the overall population of India.

The Buddhist revival remains concentrated in two states: Ambedkar&#x27;s native Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh – the land of Bodhanand Mahastavir, Acharya Medharthi and their associates.

===Developments in Uttar Pradesh===
Acharya Medharthi retired from his Buddhapuri school in 1960, and shifted to an ashram in Haridwar. He turned to the Arya Samaj and conducted Vedic yajnas all over India. After his death, he was cremated according to Arya Samaj rites. His Buddhpuri school became embroiled in property disputes. His follower, Bhoj Dev Mudit, converted to Buddhism in 1968 and set up a school of his own.

Rajendranath Aherwar appeared as an important Dalit leader in Kanpur. He joined the Republican Party of India and converted to Buddhism along with his whole family in 1961. In 1967, he founded the Kanpur branch of &quot;Bharatiya Buddh Mahasabha&quot;. He held regular meetings where he preached Buddhism, officiated at Buddhist weddings and life cycle ceremonies, and organised festivals on Ambedkar&#x27;s Jayanti (birth day), Sambuddhatva jayanthi, Diksha Divas (the day Ambedkar converted), and Ambedkar Paranirvan Divas (the day Ambedkar died).

The Dalit Buddhist movement in Kanpur gained impetus with the arrival of Dipankar, a Chamar bhikkhu, in 1980. Dipankar had come to Kanpur on a Buddhist mission and his first public appearance was scheduled at a mass conversion drive in 1981. The event was organised by Rahulan Ambawadekar, an RPI Dalit leader. In April 1981, Ambawadekar founded the Dalit Panthers (U.P. Branch) inspired by the Maharashtrian Dalit Panthers. The event met with severe criticism and opposition from Vishva Hindu Parishad and was banned.

The number of Buddhists in the Lucknow district increased from 73 in 1951 to 4327 in 2001. According to the 2001 census, almost 70% of the Buddhist population in Uttar Pradesh is from the scheduled castes background.

In 2002, Kanshi Ram, a popular political leader from a Sikh religious background, announced his intention to convert to Buddhism on 14 October 2006, the fiftieth anniversary of Ambedkar&#x27;s conversion. He intended for 20,000,000 of his supporters to convert at the same time. Part of the significance of this plan was that Ram&#x27;s followers include not only Untouchables, but persons from a variety of castes, who could significantly broaden Buddhism&#x27;s support. But, he died 9 October 2006 after a lengthy illness; he was cremated as per Buddhist tradition.

Another popular Dalit leader, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati, has said that she and her followers will embrace Buddhism after the BSP forms a government at the Centre.

===Maharashtra===

Japanese-born Surai Sasai emerged as an important Buddhist leader in India. Sasai came to India in 1966 and met Nichidatsu Fujii, whom he helped with the Peace Pagoda at Rajgir. He fell out with Fuji, however, and started home, but, by his own account, was stopped by a dream in which a figure resembling Nagarjuna appeared and said, &quot;Go to Nagpur&quot;. In Nagpur, he met Wamanrao Godbole, the person who had organised the conversion ceremony for Ambedkar in 1956. Sasai claims that when he saw a photograph of Ambedkar at Godbole&#x27;s home, he realised that it was Ambedkar who had appeared in his dream. At first, Nagpur folk considered Surai Sasai very strange. Then he began to greet them with &quot;Jai Bhim&quot; (victory to Ambedkar) and to build viharas. In 1987 a court case to deport him on the grounds that he had overstayed his visa was dismissed, and he was granted Indian citizenship. Sasai and Bhante Anand Agra are two of main leaders of the campaign to free the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya from Hindu control.

A movement originating in Maharashtra but also active in Uttar Pradesh, and spread out over quite a few other pockets where Neo Buddhists live, is Triratna Bauddha Mahāsaṅgha (formerly called TBMSG for Trailokya Bauddha Mahasangha Sahayaka Gana). It is the Indian wing of the UK-based Triratna Buddhist Community founded by Sangharakshita. Its roots lie in the scattered contacts that Sangharakshita had in the 1950s with Ambedkar. Sangharakshita, then still a bhikshu, participated in the conversion movement from 1956 until his departure to the UK in 1963.

When his new ecumenical movement had gained enough ground in the West, Sangharakshita worked with Ambedkarites in India and the UK to develop Indian Buddhism further. After visits in the late 1970s by Dharmachari Lokamitra from UK, supporters developed a two-pronged approach: social work through the Bahujan Hitaj (also spelled as Bahujan Hitay) trust, mainly sponsored from the general public by the British Buddhist-inspired Karuna Trust (UK), and direct Dharma work. Currently the movement has viharas and groups in at least 20 major areas, a couple of retreat centres, and hundreds of Indian Dharmacharis and Dharmacharinis.

Funding for movement&#x27;s social and dharma work has come from foreign countries, including the Western countries and Taiwan. Some of the foreign-funded organisations include Trailokya Bauddha Mahasangha Sahayaka Gana and Triratna (Europe and India). Triratna has links with the &#x27;Ambedkarite&#x27; Buddhist Romanis in Hungary.

===Organized mass conversions===

Since Ambedkar&#x27;s conversion, several thousand people from different castes have converted to Buddhism in ceremonies including the twenty-two vows.

;1957
:In 1957, Mahastvir Bodhanand&#x27;s Sri Lankan successor, Bhante Pragyanand, held a mass conversion drive for 15,000 people in Lucknow.

;2001
:A prominent Indian Navayana Buddhist leader and political activist, Udit Raj, organised a large mass conversion on 4 November 2001, where he gave the 22 vows, but the event met with active opposition from the government.

;2006, Hyderabad
:A report from the UK daily &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that some Hindus have converted to Buddhism. Buddhist monks from the UK and the U.S. attended the conversion ceremonies in India. Lalit Kumar, who works for a Hindu nationalist welfare association in Andhra Pradesh, asserted that Dalits should concentrate on trying to reduce illiteracy and poverty rather than looking for new religions.

;2006, Gulbarga
:On 14 October 2006, hundreds of people converted from Hinduism to Buddhism in Gulburga (Karnataka).

;2006
:At 50th anniversary celebrations in 2006 of Ambedkar&#x27;s deeksha. Non-partisan sources put the number of attendees (not converts) at 30,000. The move was criticised by Hindu groups as &quot;unhelpful&quot; and has been criticised as a &quot;political stunt.&quot;

;2007, Mumbai
:On 27 May 2007, tens of thousands of Dalits from Maharashtra gathered at the Mahalakshmi racecourse in Mumbai to mark the 50th anniversary of the conversion of Ambedkar. The number of people who converted versus the number of people in attendance was not clear. The event was organised by the Republican Party of India leader Ramdas Athvale.

===Critique===

Prerna Singh Bindra argued a mass-conversion of Hindus to Ambedkarite Buddhism under Udit Raj to be a political stunt.

==Distinctive interpretation==

According to Gail Omvedt, an American-born and naturalised Indian sociologist and human rights activist:

According to Omvedt, Ambedkar and his Buddhist movement deny many of the core doctrines of Buddhism. All the elements of religious modernism, state Christopher Queen and Sallie King, may be found in Ambedkar Buddhism where his &quot;The Buddha and His Dhamma&quot; abandons the traditional precepts and practices, then adopts science, activism and social reforms as a form of Engaged Buddhism. Ambedkar&#x27;s formulation of Buddhism is different from Western modernism, states Skaria, given his synthesis of the ideas of modern Karl Marx into the structure of ideas by the ancient Buddha.

==Criticism of the movement==

Critics have argued that Neo-Buddhism does not have a strong influence, especially after the death of Ambedkar.

Some critics also argue that Neo-Buddhism deviates too much from traditional Buddhism. Even though traditional Buddhism emphasizes equality among people, it does not deny the caste system. In addition, its emphasis on people&#x27;s liberation in the religious sense does not deny social distinctions as the norm of organizations in society, as the Buddha himself was the founder of a monastic order. A number of critics also argue that there is no moral foundation for the political practices that are based on Neo-Buddhist notions, since religion is totally voluntary, and Neo-Buddhism may thus violate democratic principles by restricting its followers to abide to certain non-religious rules.

===Navayana as a political movement===
The mass conversions to Buddhism are also seen as a political stunt rather than a genuine spiritual movement. Politicians such as Udit Raj, Ramdas Athawale, Kanshi Ram and Mayawati have also been involved in staging or planning to stage mass conversions—these politicians are members of either the Bahujan Samaj Party or the Republican Party of India.

According to Janet Contursi, Ambedkar re-interprets Buddhist religion and with Navayana &quot;speaks through Gautama and politicizes the Buddha philosophy as he theologizes his own political views&quot;.

===Ambedkar&#x27;s reinterpretations===
Ambedkar not only rejected Hinduism but also the most popular Buddhist schools. Ambedkar considered all ideas in Theravada, Vajrayana and Mahayana Buddhism that relate to an individual&#x27;s merit and spiritual development as insertions into Buddhism, and something that &quot;cannot be accepted to be the word of the Buddha&quot;. Buddhism, to Ambedkar, must have been a social reform movement. Ambedkar&#x27;s radical reinterpretations of the faith rejected many of the main tenets of mainstream Buddhism such as renunciation, meditation, Samsara, Karma, reincarnation and even the Four Noble Truths, which Ambedkar claims to have been invented by wrong-headed monks.

Ambedkar reinvents the traditional story of The Buddha and the Great Renunciation in order to try and gain mass appeal from Dalits by giving the impression that The Buddha founded Buddhism as a social reform movement rather than a spiritual movement. Virginia Hancock writes about Ambedkar&#x27;s reinterpretations as turning the Buddha into a politician.

Scholars broadly accept that the depictions of the Buddha as a social reformer are inaccurate. Gombrich (2012), states that there is no evidence that the Buddha began or pursued social reforms, rather his aim was at the salvation of those who joined his monastic order. Modernist interpreters of Buddhism, states Gombrich, keep picking up this &quot;mistake from western authors&quot;, a view that initially came into vogue during the colonial era.

Empirical evidence outside of India, such as in the Theravada Buddhist monasteries of the Sinhalese society, suggests that class ideas have been prevalent among the &quot;sangha&quot; monks, and between the Buddhist monks and the laity. In all canonical Buddhist texts, the &quot;khattiyas&quot; (warrior class) are always mentioned first and never other classes such as &quot;brahmans&quot;, &quot;vessas&quot;, &quot;suddas&quot;.

<text>James Wesley Essex, better known by his stage name J-Wess, is an American-Australian hip hop and R&amp;B music producer. J-Wess is currently in the studio working on new music to follow up his most recent single titled &#x27;Get Down&#x27;. He is based out of Los Angeles, California and Melbourne, Victoria. His sole album, &quot;J-Wess Presents Tha LP&quot;, reached the top twenty in Australia in 2005, and included three hit singles.

==Music career==
In the middle of 2003, J-Wess&#x27;s first single, &quot;Bang This&quot;, was released. It garnered airplay on Australian radio and Australian video programs, peaked at No.18 on the ARIA singles charts, and reached the top ten of the Australian urban and dance charts.

The second single, &quot;What Chu Want&quot;, was released in late 2003. It reached the Australian top 10 in February 2004, and went gold.

His album &quot;J-Wess Presents Tha LP&quot; was released on 5 April 2004 and debuted in the Australian top 20 album charts of 12 April 2004, peaking at No.19.

A third single, &quot;Luv Ya&quot;, debuted at No.15 on 7 June, and was written about the encounters J-Wess had with an exotic waitress he met at a suburban Melbourne cafe in 2004.

A fourth single &quot;Fantasy&quot; was planned, with a music video filmed, but due to the &quot;Luv Ya&quot; and &quot;Tha LP&quot; not selling to their expectations, Fantasy was scrapped.

J-Wess had announced his new single &#x27;Anything For You&#x27; from his upcoming album &quot;The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;. The single was released on June 10.

<text>Popol Vuh, later known as Popol Ace, was a 1970s Norwegian progressive rock band from Oslo, that became popular in the 1970s Norwegian rock scene with such songs as &quot;All We Have Is the Past&quot;, &quot;Queen of all Queens&quot; and &quot;Music Box&quot;. The band was originally a larger jazz-rock inspired act that featured a brass section named Arman Sumpe Dur Express. The horn players left the group and they named the new band Popol Vuh.
The band later changed its name to Popol Ace to avoid confusion with the German band Popol Vuh. In 1972 they won Norway&#x27;s Grammy award, the Spellemannprisen, for the Group category. The band&#x27;s downfall came with the lead singer Jahn Teigen leaving the band for a solo career.

In 2017 they were inducted into Norway&#x27;s Rockheim rock music hall of fame.
Grappa Musikkforlag released the 3LP box set &quot;It Was 50 Years Ago Today&quot; on November 11, 2022 featuring live recordings taken from Sveriges Radio and NRK&#x27;s archives. Sven Ohrvik played keyboards on tracks 11-20. In 2023, French progressive rock label Musea Records reissued &quot;Stolen From Time&quot; in a remastered version.

==Last line-up==
*Jahn Teigen – vocals
*Pete Knutsen – guitar, keyboards
*Arne Schulze – guitar
*Terje Methi – bass
*Thor Andreassen – drums and percussion
*Pjokken Eide – flute, trombone

<doc id="591613" wikidata="Q2060108" url="?curid=591613" title="Vexations">
<text>Vexations is a musical work by Erik Satie. Apparently conceived for keyboard (although the single page of manuscript does not specify an instrument), it consists of a short theme in the bass whose four presentations are heard alternatingly unaccompanied and played with chords above. The theme and its accompanying chords are written using enharmonic notation. The piece is undated, but scholars usually assign a date around 1893–1894 on the basis of musical and biographical evidence.

The piece bears the inscription &quot;In order to play the motif 840 times in succession, it would be advisable to prepare oneself beforehand, and in the deepest silence, by serious immobilities.&quot; (&quot;&quot;) From the 1960s onward, this text has mostly been interpreted as an instruction that the page of music should be played 840 times, although this may not have been Satie&#x27;s intention.

== Publication ==

Satie did not publish the work in his lifetime, and is not known ever to have performed or mentioned it. The piece was first printed in 1949 (in facsimile form, by John Cage in &quot;Contrepoints&quot; No. 6). The first American publication of the piece was in &quot;Art News Annual&quot;, vol. 27 (1958), again in facsimile. The first British publication was as an engraved example in an article by Peter Dickinson in &quot;Music Review&quot;, vol. 28 (1967). In 1969 the publisher Éditions Max Eschig produced the first commercial edition of the work, placing it second in a collection of three so-called &quot;Pages mystiques&quot;. Since there is no musicological evidence linking &quot;Vexations&quot; to the other works in the volume, its appearance in that context indicates nothing more than an editor&#x27;s desire to publish Satie&#x27;s uncollected compositions in three-part assemblages such as the &quot;Gymnopédies&quot;, &quot;Gnossiennes&quot;, etc.

== First public performance ==

&quot;Vexations&quot; appears to have had no performance history before the idea gained ground that the piece was required to be played 840 times. The first of the marathon performances of the work in this way was produced by John Cage and Lewis Lloyd at the Pocket Theatre at 100 Third Avenue in Manhattan by the Pocket Theatre Piano Relay Team, organized by Cage. Pianists included John Cage, David Tudor, Christian Wolff, Philip Corner, Viola Farber, Robert Wood, MacRae Cook, John Cale, David Del Tredici, James Tenney, Howard Klein (the &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer, who coincidentally was asked to play in the course of the event) and Joshua Rifkin, with two reserves, on 9 September 1963. Cage set the admission price at $5 and had a time clock installed in the lobby of the theatre. Each patron checked in with the clock and when leaving the concert, checked out again and received a refund of 5¢ for each 20 minutes attended. &quot;In this way&quot;, he told Lloyd, &quot;People will understand that the more art you consume, the less it should cost.&quot; But Cage had underestimated the length of time the concert would take. It lasted over 18 hours. One person, an actor with The Living Theatre, Karl Schenzer, was present for the entire performance.

== Meaning ==

Satie never explained the piece&#x27;s title. Conjectures regarding the meaning of &quot;Vexations&quot; (and its title) were construed long after Satie&#x27;s death and in most cases, supported by little evidence.

* The notation of the chords makes extensive use of enharmonic spellings, making it difficult to read immediately.
* &quot;Vexations&quot; could be interpreted as Satie&#x27;s coming to terms with Wagnerism. In this interpretation, &quot;Vexations&quot; would be Satie&#x27;s ironic act of defiance. He could outdo music as lengthy and intense as Wagner&#x27;s , using only the limited resources available to him; hence Gavin Bryars&#x27; description of it as &#x27;a sort of Ring des Nibelungen des pauvres&#x27; (&quot;poor man&#x27;s &quot;). &quot;Vexations&quot; can also be seen as an attack on – or a parodic emulation of – what in Wagnerian music is known as the &quot;unendliche Melodie&quot; (unending melody), in which melody is supported by a continuously modulating progression of complex chords. In mood and compositional technique this brings &quot;Vexations&quot; near to the – certainly mocking – (&quot;unsavoury Choral&quot;), the first (introductory) piece of , which he composed more than 20 years later, after he had studied conventional counterpoint for several years.
* &quot;Vexations&quot; was written in a period when Satie&#x27;s approach to harmony was related rather to a modal line of thought than to conventional harmony. Harmonically, &quot;Vexations&quot; appears to be an exercise in non-resolving tritones. Maybe Satie&#x27;s intent was nothing more than to prove that any harmonic and rhythmic system was only a matter of habit for the hearer (and not resulting from innate or divine preconception, as his contemporaries would think): so that after listening 840 times to a chordal system that is at odds with any habitual one, and set in an odd metre, one would possibly start to experience this new system to be as natural as any other – an experiment he was likely to have taken seriously, and maybe directly or indirectly influenced Debussy and/or Ravel.
* Although the date of composition is uncertain, &quot;Vexations&quot; appears to have been composed shortly after a brief, but intense, affair with Suzanne Valadon, the nearest Erik Satie ever got to a relationship with a woman, as far as is known. One of the testaments to this relationship is Satie&#x27;s optimistic composition (April 1893), being a nickname for his beloved, and the composition being an echo of how Satie customarily greeted her. it can be conjectured that Satie – being &quot;&quot; (&quot;angry&quot;, or even &quot;spiteful&quot;) about being rejected by his &quot;Biqui&quot;—wanted to disenchant himself from what she had meant to him, by composing a piece that would help him forget all such frivolous feelings.
* It is also possible that Satie was spoofing the Perpetuum mobile genre: many 19th-century composers had composed such – then very popular – separate pieces with an &#x27;indefinite&#x27; number of repeats, mostly leaning on dextrous virtuosity. References like &quot;immobilities&quot;, a definite (but disproportionately high) number of repeats, an unconventional harmony, and a &quot;very slow&quot; tempo, instead of the usual very rapid one of a Perpetuum mobile, all might indicate that Satie was making a parody of this genre, spiting the cheap effects of content-less virtuosity in an uninspired harmonic and rhythmical scheme, that his contemporaries would use to suggest &quot;rapture&quot; to their public.
* The deeply rooted idea (from its first publication on) that &quot;Vexations&quot; might have been intended by Satie as an experiment regarding boredom appears to find little support in the ideas expressed by Satie himself, although he described boredom as &#x27;profound and mysterious&#x27;.
* Other anachronistic explanations involve Dadaism (which was only invented by the end of the 2nd decade of the 20th century); (also not before the end of the 2nd decade of the 20th century, at which time Satie described it as a novelty); conceptual art (not before the 1960s); etc. Satie is often described as a precursor, or in the spirit of Oulipo, an &#x27;anticipatory plagiarist&#x27; of subsequent developments.
* Why Satie chose 840 as the number of repetitions has also been subject to conjecture: there is no conclusive evidence showing why he would have preferred this number to any other. The fact that 840 is the product of the numbers from 4 to 7 does not shed much additional light on the meaning that the number 840 might have had to Satie, though the esoteric sects or cults Satie had been involved in up till the moment that he wrote &quot;Vexations&quot; could be supposed to have some interest in numerology. When Satie started his own sect, the Metropolitan Church of Art of Jesus the Conductor, supposedly around the same time as composing &quot;Vexations&quot;, he appeared sure in his use of numbers (e.g. in the printed pamphlet listing the numbers of each type of adherent the sect was to have acquired, some of these numbers going back to biblical data). An article by Martha Curti (now Mother Felicitas) on the numerology of 840, may shed more light on the subject.

Finally, considering the many questions that remain regarding the composition, it could be seen in a tradition of &quot;riddle music&quot;, somewhere between the riddle canons of Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Musical Offering&quot; and Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;.

== Execution ==

There is no indication that Satie intended the &quot;Vexations&quot; for public performance – the introductory text he wrote, as quoted above, rather indicating it was intended as a one-person experience (e.g. as a restrained way to work off anger, or to get one&#x27;s ears tuned to an unconventional harmonic system and metre). Satie made no effort to get either &quot;Vexations&quot; or &quot;Bonjour Biqui&quot; published during his life, scarcely, or not at all, communicating about their existence (there were more of his compositions sharing this fate).

As to the total duration of the work, and whether it is to be played aloud or silently, it is hard to ascertain what Satie&#x27;s intentions were:
* No metronomical tempo indication: the score mentions &quot;Très lent&quot; (very slow), which could mean anything while the composition has not a melody that could be experienced as falling in one or another &quot;natural&quot; cadence – at least not at first sight: some (e.g. the pianist Armin Fuchs, who executed the work in its entirety several times) argue there is a natural cadence nonetheless (26 quarter-note beats per minute in Fuchs&#x27; case, which extends total execution to 28 hours)
* It is not clear whether Satie intended the bass-line (equal to both halves of the composition) to be repeated in between of half vexation: his precise instruction is &quot;&quot; – &quot;At this sign customarily the theme of the Bass will be presented&quot; (the &quot;sign&quot; occurring in between of every half vexation): not really being an obligation. There is more to be said about this sign: modern executions and editions of the score usually interpret that for every Vexation the is to be played twice, while the original manuscript of Satie indicates the &quot;sign&quot; for playing this theme three times: once preceding (and quite above) the &quot;motif&quot;, and once after every half of the &quot;motif&quot;, which seems to indicate that the has to be played before the &quot;motif&quot; is played the first time (which is usually done), but also that it is the concluding the complete cycle (and not the 840th pass of the second half of the motif, as it is usually interpreted). This would extend the total execution time with about half a minute.
* Even the 840 repeats have been questioned, for several reasons: in a &quot;Mantra&quot; or &quot;habituation&quot; approach there is not much sense in counting exactly how many times one repeats the &quot;motif&quot; to oneself. Also the indication Satie gives does not implicate it is mandatory to repeat 840 times: it is only a remark about the kind of preparation that is needed in the event that one wants to play it 840 times consecutively to oneself. There is no certainty Satie ever played the &quot;Vexations&quot; (or knew them executed), either with or without repeats (probably neither, because in the course of such action it probably would have emerged that the A on the 6th beat of the second half of the motif needs an accidental one way or another: either a pitch-changing accidental, like for the A&#x27;s immediately before – beat 2 – or after – beat 8 – this A, either a natural, to make the middle melody of the second half of the motif identical to the high-pitch melody of the first half). Probably in most performances the imaginary natural is played. Likewise, the bass C on the sixth quarter-note and the bass B on the second half of the ninth quarter-note require (presumably) naturals; the E on the fifth quarter-note is provided with a natural in the inverted version, but not in the original version. The score also presents us with two other fairly fundamental questions: (1) Why is there one diminished fourth (later inverted to an augmented fifth) among the tritones? and (2) Is the tied eighth-note chord at the end intended as a repetition of the previous chord (which requires an inconsistent interpretation of accidentals that would treat the C as a C-sharp) or does the C-sharp revert to a C (in which case the whole thing would end on a C major chord)?
* No indication whatsoever regarding at what volume it has to be played.
* It is not clear whether exactly the same speed and volume for every repetition is advised: in the &quot;vexation&quot;-anger comparison mentioned above, it would not be impossible to imagine moods (expressed by tempo and volume, and additional expression by means of arpeggio, rubato, and the like) swinging from &quot;rage&quot; to &quot;dejection&quot;, and everything in between, all along the same sitting, in a sort of &quot;Etudes d&#x27;execution transcendante&quot;-style – while obviously the standard interpretation, which is a monotonous execution (keeping to the same tempo and volume) throughout, maximally avoiding romantic implication, is more than arguably correct too.
* While the bass-note ending the motif is a major third above the first bass-note of the motif, even an execution with a modulating progression for every repeat would not be unthinkable: Satie nowhere indicates that the &quot;motif&quot; (which is by definition a musical entity &quot;not&quot; tied to a particular key) or the &quot;bass theme&quot; is to be executed at the same pitch every time.
Cage&#x27;s own intervallic analysis made for the first performance is in Lloyd&#x27;s collection at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University along with the performers&#x27; time keeper sheets from that concert.

Although there is no unambiguous indication that the &quot;Vexations&quot; should be played on the piano – an execution on another keyboard instrument, like the then popular harmonium, not being impossible – there is little doubt that this is the intended instrument.

Ornella Volta (from the Archives Erik Satie in Paris) has been preparing a dossier with several studies regarding this work and its executions. This dossier, which has not been published, is intended to contain a full analysis and a facsimile reproduction of the original score.

The musicologist Richard Toop as a young pianist gave the first complete performance by a single pianist in 1967.

Not all attempted performances of this work have been successful. In 1970, Australian pianist Peter Evans decided to abandon a solo performance of the piece after five-hundred and ninety-five repetitions because he felt that &quot;evil thoughts&quot; were overtaking him and observed &quot;strange creatures emerging from the sheet music&quot;.

The team at MakerBot Industries has programmed one of their robots to perform &quot;Vexations&quot;. It was performed for the public for the first time at a 2010 New York City Maker Faire. The performance was based on the one by Armin Fuchs in Dresden in the year 2000.

On 12 December 2012, French pianist Nicolas Horvath performed in the Palais de Tokyo a non-stop solo version lasting 35 hours.

In September 2016, during the three days of the sci-tech Trieste Next festival, the pianist and multimedia artist Adriano Castaldini performed an open-air solo of the entire &quot;Vexations&quot;, conceiving a very new way of interpreting the piece, i.e. making &quot;audible&quot; the psycho-physical experience of vexation by connecting his body to the live electronic processing of the piano sound: during the performance, the pianist wore a sensor system (EEG, EMG, GSR and temperature sensors) not simply for medical feedback, but to process medical data in real time using a software (coded by Castaldini himself) that turned data into control values for the piano sound live processing (the sound was captured by seven microphones inside the piano).

In 2017 Alessandro Deljavan performed the 840 repetitions of the theme, plus one slowed-down final theme, using a digital visual metronome to maintain perfect timing throughout the entire performance. He recorded the entire performance inside the OnClassical recording studio. That resulted in a twelve-albums collection, 14,5+ hours long, 841 tracks, which gained over 10 millions listenings on Spotify.

On 2 December 2017, alt-classical concert series ChamberLab hosted a marathon performance of &quot;Vexations&quot; as a fundraiser for the American Civil Liberties Union, and raised $16,731.85 in pledges and donations. The event was open to all musicians, and 34 participated throughout the day at the Hotel Congress in Tucson, Arizona.

On 30 May 2020, Igor Levit performed all 840 repetitions of &quot;Vexations&quot; at the B-sharp Studio, Berlin. The performance streamed on Periscope, Twitter and other platforms, including on &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s website. Levit said the recital was in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, his reaction to which he characterised as a &quot;silent scream&quot; (&quot;&quot;). The 840 sheets of music were sold individually to assist out-of-work musicians.

From the 29 to 30 January 2021, Bot_pianist.ver, a robot made by ATOD, performed all 840 repetitions of &quot;Vexations&quot; for 19 hours 30 minutes at Platform-L Contemporary Art Center in Seoul. It was a part of Furniture Music in the 4th Industrial Revolution Era: a convergence of an exhibition and performance; a reconstruction of Satie&#x27;s &quot;Vexations&quot; conducted by PyoungRyang Ko. This work was a part of the Art &amp; Tech Project by Arts Council Korea (ARKO) and Hanyang Industry-university Cooperation Foundation. The convergence of the exhibition and the performance was streamed on YouTube.

On 3 February 2021, 12 players and composers performed at the Hall of Halls, the music box museum in Kiyosato at the southern foot of the Yatsugatake Mountains, Japan. The performers were Mana Fukui, Wataru Iwata, Masakazu Yamamoto, KaoLi, Taro Yoshihara, Keitaro Yamaguchi, Kazuya Saegusa, Sachiko Kawano, Mamoru Yamamoto, Satoka Yokoyama, Shunichi Komatsubara, and Ayumi Satake. Instruments used were piano, French horn, trumpet, cello, double bass, key harmonica, voice, organetta (street organ), organite (hand-cranked music box).

On 13 August 2021, American pianist Aaron D. Smith performed a non-stop solo version lasting 36 hours and 22 minutes in Salt Lake City&#x27;s Sugar House neighborhood. It is known to be the longest non-stop solo piano version ever performed. This performance was conducted alongside six dancers in conjunction with the Interdisciplinary Arts Collective.

On 17–18 February 2024, Japanese artist Ai Onoda performed a non-stop solo of &quot;Vexations&quot; at the Yamagoya gallery and shop in Ebisu, Tokyo. Onoda repeated it 840 times according to the score, playing from 11am on 17th to around 7am on 18th. He wore a diaper, and drank water and ate snacks while playing with only his left hand. He prepared 840 copies of the score, and dropped each page on the floor as he finished them. Onoda used Rhodes Mark-II Stage Piano 54 for this performance. Japanese archivist Yosuke Nakagawa recorded and documented it.

<text>Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis (; – ) was a Lithuanian composer, painter, choirmaster, cultural figure, and writer in Polish.

Čiurlionis contributed to symbolism and Art Nouveau, and was representative of the fin de siècle epoch. He has been considered one of the pioneers of abstract art in Europe. During his short life, he composed about 400 pieces of music and created about 300 paintings, as well as many literary works and poems. The majority of his paintings are housed in the M. K. Čiurlionis National Art Museum in Kaunas, Lithuania. His works have had a profound influence on modern Lithuanian culture.

==Biography==
===Childhood and early music studies===
Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis was born in Senoji Varėna, a town in southeastern Lithuania which at the time was part of the Russian Empire. His mother Adelė née Radmanaitė (Radmann) (1854-1919) was descended from a Lutheran family of Bavarian origin, born in Vileikiai village (Lazdijai region). His father Konstantinas Čiurlionis (1851-1914, born in Guobiniai) was an organist and a choirmaster who briefly played the organ in Liškiava, which is where the couple met.

The newly formed family moved to Senoji Varėna, where their eldest child, Mikalojus, was born. There were nine siblings altogether: Mikalojus Konstantinas (1875-1911), Marija (1879-1969), Juzė (1882-1969), Povilas (1884-1945), Stasys (1887-1944), Petras (1890-1924), Jonas (1891-1955), Valerija (1896-1955), and Jadvyga (1898-1992).

Even though Čiurlionis&#x27; family spoke Polish, Mikalojus Konstantinas could understand and read Lithuanian, albeit he was not proficient and would receive assistance from his fiancée from 1907 onwards.

In 1878, his family moved to Druskininkai, away, where his father went on to serve as the town organist. This is where Mikalojus Konstantinas, called Konstantinas or Kastukas by the family, started publicly displaying his musical proficiency - he was a musical prodigy: he could play by ear at the age of five and could sight-read music freely by the age of seven. He would often fill in for his father playing the organ at Mass, while he played piano at home. A family friend, doctor Jozef Markiewicz noticed his natural talent and upon Mikalojus&#x27; graduation from the folk school of Druskininkai, wrote a letter to the Lithuanian noble Michał Mikołaj Ogiński recommending to enroll M. K. Čiurlionis to the Palace Orchestra School in Plungė.
M. K. Čiurlionis studied in the Plungė Palace Orchestra School from 1889 to 1893. Here he played the flute, received his first orchestra uniform and musical theory basics. He would often travel with the orchestra to play concerts in Rietavas, Palanga, Riga. He had a close relationship with M. Ogiński, and so the Duke granted him a scholarship which allowed the composer to study in Warsaw.

=== Life abroad ===
Supported by Prince Ogiński&#x27; scholarship Čiurlionis studied piano and composition at Warsaw Institute of Music from 1894 to 1899. He studied piano with the guidance of , composition with the guidance of the composer Zygmunt Noskowski. Here he met the future Polish composer and director of the Warsaw Conservatory . Together they discussed music and paintings, critiqued each other&#x27;s compositions, went on vacation at Morawski&#x27;s parents&#x27; place in Zakroczym. Here he met his friend&#x27;s sister Maria Morawska. Father, after noticing the love of his young daughter and at the time unknown artist, intervened and married Maria of to a widower. M. K. Čiurlionis buried himself in work: wrote preludes, fugues, canons, variation cycles for the piano. For his graduation, in 1899, he wrote a cantata for mixed chorus and symphonic orchestra titled &quot;De Profundis&quot;, and received the diploma for the composition specialty. He declined the offer to become the orchestra master for Lublin&#x27;s Music Society Choir and continued creating - in 1900 he finished his first symphonic poem &quot;In the Forest&quot;, which was dedicated to E. Morawski.

After receiving the approval and further scholarship from M. Ogiński, in 1901 M. K. Čiurlionis joined the Leipzig Conservatory, where he was taught composition by Carl Reinecke, contrapunto by Salomon Jadassohn. Though he was not proficient in German, he still enrolled in aesthetics, history, psychology classes. It is apparent from letters that M. K. Čiurlionis felt very lonely in Leipzig and he wanted to come back to Druskininkai; he constantly wrote letters to his family and E. Morawski.

As he was in Leipzig, he listened to and studied the works of G. F. Haendel, P. Tchaikovsky, R. Wagner, F. Liszt, H. Berlioz, R. Strauss, created the symphonic overture &quot;Kęstutis&quot;. Since he couldn&#x27;t come back home, he started drawing during his free time. The sudden death of M. Ogiński and disrupted financial support made it harder to finish the Conservatory, but he succeeded in receiving the teacher&#x27;s license from Leipzig&#x27;s Conservatory.

=== Interest in painting ===
M. K. Čiurlionis returned to Warsaw in 1902 and joined the Warsaw Drawing School where he was taught drawing by Jan Kauzik. As he was living in Warsaw, he had to work as a private music tutor to support himself and his brothers who were also studying in Warsaw. With the strong decision to paint, he refused to teach at Warsaw&#x27;s Institute of Music. In 1903, he painted the 7-painting cycle &quot;Funeral Symphony&quot;, but also did not forget music: he started creating his second symphonic poem &quot;The Sea&quot;.

He continued his painting studies in Warsaw School of Fine Arts from 1904 to 1906. His main teacher in Warsaw was symbolist painter Kazimierz Stabrowski, who was also the founder of the first lodges of the Theosophical Society in Poland and passed to Čiurlionis an interest in Theosophy and other esoteric subjects. In the School he was taught drawing by Karol Tichy, Konrad Krzyżanowski, sculpture by Xawery Dunikowski, painting by Ferdynand Ruszczyc, went to the organized plein-airs. In 1904 he showed 19 of his works (stained glass projects, cycle of 6 paintings &quot;The Storm&quot;, book covers) in the private exhibition of the School. In 1905 there was M. K. Čiurlionis exhibition, where he showed the 10-painting cycle &quot;Fantasies&quot;, in the same year he also participated in the first annual exhibition of Warsaw School of Arts.

As he was working as a private music tutor, he acquainted himself with the family of Wolmans, who quickly became his friends. He had an especially warm relationship with Bronisława Wolman, who sponsored M. K. Čiurlionis&#x27; painting. As a thank you, M. K. Čiurlionis gifted her numerous paintings including &quot;Friendship&quot; (1906/1907). In 1905 B. Wolman invited M. K. Čiurlionis with a couple of his friends to the resort town of Anapa, near the Black Sea. Here M. K. Čiurlionis traveled the Caucasus, painted, photographed, and searched for inspiration.

B. Wolman gave M. K. Čiurlionis money for his trip through Europe: he went to Prague, Dresden, Nuremberg, Munich, Vienna; the artist adored the works of Van Dyck, Rembrandt, Böcklin. In 1906 he showed his works in the exhibition of Warsaw&#x27;s School of Fine Arts in Saint Petersburg (the cycles &quot;Creation of the World&quot;, &quot;Day&quot;, &quot;The Storm&quot; and other creations). Articles started appearing in the press about M. K. Čiurlionis, the first Lithuanian article was in &quot;Vilniaus žinios&quot; (no. 123).

=== Dedication to Lithuania ===
In 1906, M. K. Čiurlionis wrote to his brother Povilas: &quot;I am going to dedicate all of my previous and future work to Lithuania&quot;. As he received the invitation to participate in the First Exhibition of Lithuanian Art in 1907 at Vileišis Palace, Vilnius, he sent his paintings (33 paintings shown), and also helped organize it. Soon after this event, the Lithuanian Art Society was founded, and Čiurlionis was one of its 19 founding members.

In 1907 M. K. Čiurlionis moved to Vilnius, where he lived on 11 Savičiaus Street, and actively involved himself in culture: he was elected to the board of Lithuanian Art Society, was the choirmaster of the choir &quot;Vilniaus kanklės&quot;. During his visit to the dress rehearsal of &quot;Blinda&quot; by Gabrielius Landsbergis-Žemkalnis he met the writer Sofija Kymantaitė (1886–1958). Together with her and the Lithuanian Art Society they prepared the Second Exhibition of Lithuanian Art and discussed the creation of &quot;Folk Palace&quot; (art museum).

Together with Sofija (fiancée) they went to Palanga in 1908, and on 1 January 1909 they got married, later visited Sofija&#x27;s parents in Kuliai, Karklėnai, Sofija&#x27;s uncle in Plungė, stayed in Druskininkai.

=== Fight for recognition and death ===
Trying to become more known, M. K. Čiurlionis followed his friends&#x27; advice and left for Saint Petersburg in 1908. Here he met Mstislav Dobuzhinsky, who introduced the Lithuanian artist to the Russian Artist Society. To have enough money, he had to once again become a private music tutor. While in Saint Petersburg, M. K. Čiurlionis did not forget Lithuania: he proposed creating a music section at the Lithuanian Art Society, sent harmonized folk songs to &quot;Vilniaus kanklės&quot; choir, together with Sofija wrote music for their opera &quot;Jūratė&quot;.

In 1909, after the wedding and parent visits, both newlyweds came to Saint Petersburg. Here M. K. Čiurlionis paintings were exhibited in &quot;Salon&quot; exhibition, in the Sixth Exhibition of Russian Artist Society, among them – his newest painting – &quot;Rex&quot; (1909). A few of his paintings he also sent to the First Spring Exhibition of Vilnius Artist Society, to the Thirteenth Art Lover Society &quot;Sztuka&quot; Exhibition in Krakow. In March, 1909, Sofija and M. K. Čiurlionis came back to Lithuania, where they helped organizing the Third Art Exhibition of Lithuanian Art, painted the &quot;Rūta&quot; Society hall curtain, wrote the critique essay book &quot;In Lithuania&quot;. At the end of the year, M. K. Čiurlionis left for Saint Petersburg again.

Constant work without breaks, material deprivations tired out M. K. Čiurlionis - Sofija found him acting strange on Christmas Eve and brought him to a neuropathologist and psychiatrist V. Bechterev, who diagnosed him with burnout. In 1910 both came back to Druskininkai, later M. K. Čiurlionis was hospitalized in a health resort &quot;Czerwony Dwór&quot; (Red Manor) in Marki, Poland, northeast of Warsaw. While he was getting better, his only daughter – Danutė – was born. In 1911, he went for a walk and got pneumonia and died on 10 April 1911 at 35 years of age. He was buried at the Rasos Cemetery in Vilnius. He never saw his daughter Danutė (1910–1995).

Čiurlionis felt that he was a synesthete; that is, he perceived colours and music simultaneously. Many of his paintings bear the names of musical pieces: sonatas, fugues, and preludes.

== M. K. Čiurlionis as a composer ==
M. K. Čiurlionis is the originator of Lithuanian professional music. The precise number of Čiurlionis musical compositions is not known – a substantial part of his manuscripts did not survive, including those that perished in the fire during the war. The ones available for us today include sketches, rough drafts, and fragments of his musical ideas. The nature of the archive determined the fact that Čiurlionis&#x27; works were finally published only a hundred years after the composer&#x27;s death. Today, the archive amounts to almost 400 compositions, the major part of which are works for piano (around 200), but also significant opuses for symphony orchestra (symphonic poems &quot;In the Forest&quot; and &quot;The Sea&quot;, symphonic overture &quot;Kęstutis&quot;, cantata for choir and orchestra &quot;De Profundis&quot;), string quartet, fugue &quot;&quot;Kyrie&quot;,&quot; works like &quot;&quot;Sanctus&quot;, &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s not be sad&quot; (&quot;Neliūskime&quot;),&quot; works for various choirs (original compositions and Lithuanian folk song arrangements (around 40)), as well as works for organ.

In 1909 in Warsaw his collection book of harmonized Lithuanian folk songs &quot;Vieversėlis&quot; was published. M. K. Čiurlionis&#x27; harmonized folk songs like &quot;Dawning dawn&quot; (&quot;Beauštanti aušrelė&quot;), &quot;Oh It Goes, It Goes&quot; (&quot;Oi lekia, lekia&quot;), &quot;Dad Will Dance&quot; (&quot;Šoks tėvelis suktinį&quot;), and &quot;Promised So Far&quot; (&quot;Taip toli žadėta&quot;) were played/sung in Lithuanian song festivals in Chicago (USA) and Toronto (Canada).

Together with Kazimieras Būga, Augustinas Voldemaras, Česlovas Sasnauskas, J. Tallat-Kelpša, M. K.Čiurlionis prepared the Lithuanian music terminology dictionary &quot;Our music terminology&quot; (&quot;Mūsų muzikos terminologija&quot;) in 1909.

== M. K. Čiurlionis as a painter ==
M. K. Čiurlionis started to form late as a painter. Even though it is known that he would paint his surroundings while studying in Plungė in 1893, he started his professional painter path only when he was 27 years old, after he joined Warsaw&#x27;s Drawing School. Later M. K. Čiurlionis said &quot;They did not teach me anything there that I wanted to learn&quot;. Already in the first paintings M. K. Čiurlionis&#x27; inclination was visible towards symbolism and abstraction, the veil of mysticism and secrecy in creating. As the most comfortable art technique for himself, the artist chose the antique painting method with tempera. Another characteristic, showing M. K. Čiurlionis attraction to antique art - compositions of cycles, diptychs, triptychs, most common to the art of the Middle Ages.
In the first M. K. Čiurlionis paintings (from 1903) there is an abundance of fantasy creatures, mystic rulers of the past, traces of Lithuanian pagan culture, elements of cosmogony - Gods, planets, stars, the Sun. These elements accompanied the painter during all of his creative life, receiving more concrete and suggestive forms. From the very beginning, M. K. Čiurlionis felt that the best form to express himself is the cyclical exploration of an idea. And thus such cycles were created like 7-painting cycle &quot;Funeral symphony&quot; (1903), 4-painting cycle &quot;Day&quot; (1904, one painting missing), 5-painting cycle &quot;The Deluge&quot; (1904, one painting missing), triptych &quot;Rex&quot; (1904, not to confuse with the culminative painting &quot;Rex&quot; of 1909), 13-painting cycle &quot;Creation of the World&quot; (1905/6), 3-painting cycle &quot;Sparks&quot; (1906), 12-painting cycle &quot;Zodiac&quot; (1906).

The time between 1907 and 1909 is the most mature and productive for M. K. Čiurlionis as a painter. Paintings have clearer, more stylised forms. His 8-painting cycle &quot;Winter&quot; (1907) and triptych &quot;My Road&quot; (1907) are especially mature, verging on the border of abstraction. There are more traces of musical structure in his painting: the 4-painting cycles, repeating the musical sonata structures with parts &quot;allegro, andante, scherzo, finale.&quot; M. K. Čiurlionis painted 7 sonatas which received their associative names after his death: &quot;Sonata I (Sonata of the Sun)&quot; (1907), &quot;Sonata II (Sonata of the Spring)&quot; (1907), &quot;Sonata no. 3 (Sonata of the Serpent)&quot; (1908), &quot;Sonata no. 4 (Sonata of the Summer)&quot; (1908), &quot;Sonata no. 5 (Sonata of the Sea)&quot; (1908), &quot;Sonata no. 6 (Sonata of the Stars)&quot; (1908), &quot;Sonata no. 7 (Sonata of the Pyramids)&quot; (1909). There are other musical paintings such as diptych &quot;Prelude and Fugue&quot; (1908), &quot;Prelude. Fugue&quot; (1908), as well as triptych&#x27;s &quot;Fantasy&quot; (1908) middle part of &quot;Fugue&quot;.

M. K. Čiurlionis pays a lot of attention to Lithuania&#x27;s past culture and nature of his homeland. Like creating music, when painting he looks for inspiration in folk art and culture. We can see that not only in the landscape triptych &quot;Raigardas&quot; (1907), but also in fairytale motif full paintings &quot;The Prince&#x27;s Jouurney&quot; (1907), triptych &quot;Fairytale&quot; (1907), we can find ethnographic motif in the painting &quot;Fairytale (Fairytale of the Fortress)&quot; (1909).

One of the most famous M. K. Čiurlionis painting is &quot;Rex&quot;, created in 1909. Here the artist&#x27;s experience connects with the research of C. Flammarion, Holy Scripture, Indo-European myths.

Some of the most popular Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis paintings include:
* &quot;Friendship&quot; (1906)
* 8 painting cycle &quot;Winter&quot; (1906–1907)
* 12 painting cycle &quot;The Zodiac&quot; (1907)
* 13 painting cycle &quot;Creation of the World&quot; (1906-1907)
* &quot;Spring&quot; – four paintings (1907–08)
* 3 painting cycle &quot;Summer&quot; (1907–08)
* &quot;Sonata I (Sonata of the Sun)&quot; (1907)
* &quot;Sonata II (Sonata of the Spring)&quot; (1907)
* &quot;Sonata no. 3 (Sonata of the Serpent)&quot; (1908)
* &quot;Sonata no. 4 (Sonata of the Summer&#x27;)&#x27; (1908)
* &quot;Sonata no. 5 (Sonata of the Sea)&quot; (1908)
* &quot;Sonata no. 6 (Sonata of the Stars)&quot; (1908)
* &quot;Sonata no. 7 (Sonata of the Pyramids)&quot; (1908)
* Diptych &quot;Prelude and Fugue&quot; (1908)

* 3 painting cycle &quot;Fairy-Tale&quot; (1909)
* &quot;Rex&quot; (1909)
* &quot;Fairytale of the Kings&quot; (1908-1909)
==Posthumous recognition==

After Čiurlionis&#x27;s death in 1911, the Russian critic (transliterated as Tschoudowsky in English) wrote: Now that he is dead, the authors of the spiritual revival of Lithuania present Ciurlionis &quot;(sic)&quot; as a national artist. It is not for us to judge; however his extraordinary independence of all contemporary art leads one to believe that he was really created by the hidden forces of his people; and it is well for us to be able to believe that this singular genius does not merely represent a chance caprice of fate, but is the precursor of a future sublime Lithuanian art. When I think of him, an idea imposes itself on my mind: the Lithuanian people had no Middle Ages, perhaps it has preserved intact until the 20th century, even better than we Russians, the immense energy of mystic life inherited from the Arians which our Western brothers have so prodigally squandered in their Middle Ages.In 1911, the first posthumous exhibition of Čiurlionis&#x27;s art was held in Vilnius and Kaunas. During the same year, an exhibition of his art was held in Moscow, and in 1912 his works were exhibited in St. Petersburg.

On 13 January 1913, Čiurlionis division was formed next to Lithuanian Art Society and one of its goals was to accumulate the late painter&#x27;s works of art. The necessity to save M. K. Čiurlionis heritage rushed art lovers to take more action in creating the &quot;Folk Palace&quot; - the art museum to house these paintings.

<text>Ngāi Tahu, or Kāi Tahu, is the principal Māori (tribe) of the South Island. Its (tribal area) is the largest in New Zealand, and extends from the White Bluffs / Te Parinui o Whiti (southeast of Blenheim), Mount Mahanga and Kahurangi Point in the north to Stewart Island / Rakiura in the south. The comprises 18 (governance areas) corresponding to traditional settlements. According to the 2018 census an estimated 74,082 people affiliated with the Kāi Tahu iwi.

Ngāi Tahu originated in the Gisborne District of the North Island, along with Ngāti Porou and Ngāti Kahungunu, who all intermarried amongst the local Ngāti Ira. Over time, all but Ngāti Porou would migrate away from the district. Several were already occupying the South Island prior to Ngāi Tahu&#x27;s arrival, with Kāti Māmoe only having arrived about a century earlier from the Hastings District, and already having conquered Waitaha, who themselves were a collection of ancient groups. Other that Ngāi Tahu encountered while migrating through the South Island were Ngāi Tara, Rangitāne, Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri, and Ngāti Wairangi – all of which also migrated from the North Island at varying times. During the 19th century, hundreds of thousands of Europeans – mostly British – migrated to New Zealand. After European arrival, Ngāti Toa (allied with Ngāti Tama) and Ngāti Rārua invaded Ngāi Tahu&#x27;s territory with muskets. Some European settlers intermingled with native populations, and today, most families who descend from Ngāi Tahu also have Ngāti Māmoe and British ancestry.

 translates as &quot;People of Tahu&quot;, referencing the name of the ancestor Tahupōtiki. Alongside the other that Ngāi Tahu absorbed, there are five primary (sub-tribes) of Ngāi Tahu, which are: Ngāti Kurī, Ngāti Irakehu, Kāti Huirapa, Ngāi Tūāhuriri, and Ngāi Te Ruakihikihi. A branch of Ngāi Tūāhuriri and Ngāti Kurī, Kāi Te Rakiāmoa, was one of the latest which the leading chiefs descended from.

== History ==
=== Traditional origins ===

Ngāi Tahu trace their traditional descent from Tahupōtiki (also Te Tuhi-māreikura-ooho-a-tama-wahine), and Tahumatua), the younger brother of Porourangi. The brothers are said to be descended from Paikea as grandsons, great-grandsons, or great-great-grandsons. Either way, Paikea himself is always Chief Uenuku&#x27;s son. Some groups may even trace the brothers as great-grandsons of Uenuku&#x27;s other son Ruatapu as well as with Paikea.

Whatever the case, Tahupōtiki was born in Whāngārā (a place associated with Paikea), around 1450CE. He was given command of the (canoe), and took it down to the South Island where he landed at the Arahura River on the West Coast – or at the Waiau River near Manapōuri. He stayed there for a time before travelling back to Whāngārā in a new canoe upon learning of the death of his brother. As according to ancient protocol, he took Porourangi&#x27;s grieving wife Hamo-te-rangi as his own, by whom he had at least four sons: Ira-a-Tahu, Ira-(apa)-roa, Tahumuri-hape, and Karimoe. Some say his other sons were Ira-manawa-piko, Rakaroa, Rakahurumanu, Tūroto, Tahutīoro, and Ruanuku.

Tahupōtiki, Ira-a-Tahu, Iraroa, and Tahumuri-hape moved south towards Tūranga, then settled at Maraetaha at the northern end of the Wharerātā Range. Karimoe instead moved northwards and settled at the banks of the Mangaheia stream, inwards of Ūawanui-a-Ruamatua. The family later moved to Iwitea, where Tahupōtiki built the Taumatahīnaki . The ancestor Te Matuahanga (descendant of Tūroto and Rakaroa) is still known in the area around there. More were established further inland along the Tukemōkihi block.

=== 16th century ===
Owing to growing tensions between the various inhabiting the surrounding area, many groups began their migration away from Waerenga-a-Hika in the Gisborne District. One of the earliest notable instances of tension was where Rākaihikuroa, grandson of Kahungunu, killed his own twin brothers out of jealousy, and was banished after his own son Tupurupuru was killed in revenge.

Perhaps a more notable instance, is when Rākaihikuroa&#x27;s other son Rākaipaaka was insulted by local Chief Tūtekohi who had invited him to his and then fed the prepared feast to his (dog) Kauerehuanui. The visitors showed no reaction at the time, but after leaving, Whaitiripoto instructed Whakaruru-a-Nuku to go back and eat the dog in revenge. This action resulted in war against the Takutaioterangi and their allies.

A similar engagement occurred with Ngāi Tahu, involving Chief Rakawahakura (great-grandson of Ira-a-Tahu), Whaitiripoto, and Whakaruru-a-Nuku. The fish and birds for this feast were actually cleverly carved chunks of wood, designed to give the impression of those foods being prepared in the storehouse. The later battle came to be known as because of this. The children began playing games, enticing the adults to join in as a distraction while the hosts began to form their attack, even killing the visitors&#x27; dogs. Tūtekohi ultimately won, and so Ngāi Tahu was forced to move further down the North Island. Rakawahakura was later killed near Waikato.

=== 17th century ===
==== Migration to Wellington ====
From Gisborne the had moved down the coast to the Heretaunga. The ancestress Tūhaitara, senior granddaughter of Rakawahakura, insulting her husband Chief Marukore of Ngāti Māmoe, or Te Kāhea, and his ancestry, as well as various other exchanges are the reason for war between their two . Tūhaitara herself had some Ngāti Māmoe heritage, but he was a local viewed as below her status. The pair had 11 children in total, including Tamaraeroa, Huirapa, Tahumatā, Pahirua and Hinehou. Huirapa is the son who Kāti Huirapa descends from.

Tūhaitara&#x27;s cousin through Rakawahakura, Kurī, also lived around this time. Just as Tūhaitara was the senior ancestress of Ngāi Tahu with her own named after her, Ngāi Tūhaitara, Kurī is also the ancestor of the prominent Kāti Kurī .

Tūhaitara instructed Tamaraeroa and Huirapa to kill Marukore at a place called . However, Marukore knew of their plan and defeated them in the Battle of Hūkete after which their sister Hinehou laid them on the floor of her for her grandchildren to see, and left her belongings with them before burning down the building in an incident now known as (&quot;The Laying Down of Fighting Chiefs&quot;). Alternatively, Marukore himself burned their bodies on a funeral pyre. Tamaraeroa&#x27;s wife was killed as well, but they left a son named Te Aohuraki. Huirapa&#x27;s son Marainaka also survived the fighting.

Next the brothers Pahirua and Tahumatā sought out to defeat Marukore. As they were about to take advice from a local chief named Rākaimoari, his daughter Hinewai-a-tapu made a remark about Tahumatā which sparked the Battle of Te Pakiaka (&quot;The Roots&quot;) that lasted for some days. It was named so because Tahumatā caught Hinewai-a-tapu hiding under some tree roots, and made her his wife.

Eventually the Ngāti Māmoe chief Hikaororoa managed to trap Marukore&#x27;s party in a . Hikaororoa asked for the &#x27;chief of the long plume&#x27; to come to the door to be cannibalised. Marukore&#x27;s younger cousin Rokopaekawa took Marukore&#x27;s headdress (his sign of status) and was sacrificed instead. However he did not cook properly, and the headdress&#x27;s plume was still visible in the dirt. This was considered a bad omen and so the body was discarded with the incident being called (&quot;The Long Standing Feather Plumes&quot;).

Marukore and Tūhaitara would both die in the Battle of Tapapanui, at the hands of their son Pahirua who was very angry about the whole situation. In one telling of the series of battles, Hinehou and Pahirua built together, and burnt the bodies of all the slain there. The remaining children of the warring parents would move down to a place called in Wairarapa where Hinehou was already living, and southward to Te Whanganui-a-Tara within a few generations.

==== Migration to the South Island ====

In Wellington Te Aohikuraki, the senior chief, slept with Rākaitekura (a high ranking Ngāi Tahu woman) while her husband Tūmaro was away visiting his family. Of this Te Hikutawatawa (later named ), the ancestor of Ngāi Tūāhuriri, was born illegitimate. Owing to Rākaitekura&#x27;s high rank, Tūmaro was unable to kill her, so instead had her prepare herself for marriage with Te Aohikuraki. The stream where she did up her hair was called . Tūmaro gathered his family and departed for Waimea, near Nelson across the Cook Strait, leaving Rākaitekura and Te Hikutawatawa behind.

Curiosity burning in him since childhood, when the other children would pick fun on him for being illegitimate, Te Hikutawatawa left Kaiwhakawaru seeking out his step-father. Upon his arrival to Waimea, Tūmaro&#x27;s father Kahukura-te-paku, not knowing who he was, had intended to cannibalise him, but later put a stop to the meal preparations when local children heard Te Hikutawatawa muttering of his origins. Kahukura-te-paku then asked Te Hikutawatawa to climb through a window to remove the breach on , where he and Tūmaro greeted him with open arms. Te Hikutawatawa was still outraged at his being defiled by Kahukura-te-paku, so he returned later to destroy the site and kill everyone who lived there. After this he was known as ( meaning &quot;sacred altar&quot;, meaning &quot;to be angry&quot;).

Late in the 17th century the began migrating to the northern part of the South Island under the leadership of the Ngāti Kurī chief Pūrahonui, with his sons Makō-ha-kirikiri and Marukaitātea, establishing the Kaihinu in the Tory Channel / Kura Te Au. After an incident in which a Ngāi Tahu had desecrated the bones of one of Ngāi Tara&#x27;s ancestors, Pūrahonui was murdered in revenge early one morning when he went to relieve himself. This broke out into a series of battles between the two .

In the North Island, Hikaororoa, a prominent tribal member, attacked Te Mata-ki-kaipoinga after Tūāhuriri insulted him. Tūtekawa (Tūāhuriri&#x27;s brother-in-law of senior Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Porou, and Ngāti Māmoe connections) withdrew his men to attack at another angle after his younger relative recognised an insult from Hikaororoa. He sent the same relative to warn Tūāhuriri to escape, which he did into a nearby bush. For unknown reasons, when Tūtekawa entered the , he slew Tūāhuriri&#x27;s wives Hinekaitaki and Tuarāwhati (Whākuku&#x27;s sisters). After the battle, Tūtekawa fled down to Waikākahi on the shores of Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora where he lived amongst his fellow Ngāti Māmoe. Tūtekawa&#x27;s own wife Tūkōrero was a sister to Tūāhuriri&#x27;s other wife Hinetewai (mother of Hāmua, Tūrakautahi, and Moki). He was also a first cousin to both the Ngāti Kurī chief Te Rakiwhakaputa, and to the Ngāti Māmoe leader Tukiauau.

On one occasion when Ngāti Kurī fought with Rangitāne, Chief Tūteurutira had mistaken one of his captives, Hinerongo, as one of the enemy&#x27;s women. She was in fact a member of Ngāti Māmoe who had already been taken captive by Rangitāne, and so he returned her to the Matariki near Waiau Toa. This struck a new alliance between their , after which they successfully attacked Rangitāne in the Wairau Valley. For this Ngāti Māmoe then ceded the east coast regions north of Waiau Toa to Ngāi Tahu, and Tūteurutira and Hinerongo married and settled at the .

In the Battle of Ōpokihi against Ngāti Māmoe, Marukaitātea was rescued by his brothers Makō-ha-kirikiri and Kahupupuni. At the Pariwhakatau near the Conway area, Makō-ha-kirikiri was with his sisters Te Apai and Tokerau, Manawa-i-waho&#x27;s wives, when Tukiauau sneaked in and killed Manawa. The former three were spared by the protection of the guardian, Te Hineumutahi. However, they were forced to leave the through her legs (she would have been a wooden figure or carving suspended in the air).
By the 1690s Ngāi Tahu had settled in Canterbury, including Ngāti Kurī conquering the east coast down to Kaikōura, and Ngāti Irakehu peaceably settling among Banks Peninsula&#x27;s Ngāti Māmoe. The last battle that was fought between the two up to that point was the Battle of Waipapa, before Ngāti Kurī took the Takahanga . Marukaitātea chose to stay here, while other chiefs continued to push south. Around this time, the ariki Tūteāhuka was moving the last of the tribe&#x27;s members to the South Island through the Cook Strait. As a consequence for ignoring Chief Te Aweawe&#x27;s advice to strap two canoes together for a safer passage, Tūāhuriri is said to have been left to drown along with Tūmaro while trying to leave Wellington. It is very likely that Tūāhuriri&#x27;s eldest son Hāmua also drowned, otherwise he might have died in Kaikōura at a young age.

=== 18th century ===
After establishing dominance down to Kaikōura, many of Ngāi Tahu&#x27;s leading chiefs were ready to expand further south into the island. One, Moki, another son of Tūāhuriri, had received reports from Kaiapu and Tamakino (brothers of Mārewa, Moki&#x27;s wife) that his father&#x27;s wife&#x27;s killer, Tūtekawa, was living just further south at Te Waihora. He set off in his canoe, , and attacked various small villages including the Parakākāriki at Ōtanerito. Tūtekawa was ultimately killed by Whākuku instead of Moki, avenging the deaths of his sisters. Tūtekawa&#x27;s son Te Rakitāmau returned to the home, where he found his wife Punahikoia and children unharmed, and the attackers sleeping near the fire. Te Rakitāmau did not avenge Tūtekawa, but instead left a sign that he spared the attackers&#x27; lives, and peace was eventually restored between their descendants.

Chief Te Rakiwhakaputa claimed the area of Whakaraupō, naming the beach . He destroyed Ngāti Māmoe&#x27;s at Mānuka, across the hills at Taitapu, and prior to that also lived at Te Pā-o-Te Rakiwhakaputa on the Cam River / Ruataniwha for a time. His son Manuhiri drove Ngāti Māmoe out of Ōhinetahi and set up his base there, and his other son Te Wheke set up his own base on Avon River / Ōtākaro&#x27;s estuary. Makō-ha-kirikiri was given Little River and Wairewa, and Te Ruahikihiki of Kāti Kurī, ancestor of Ngāi Te Ruakihikihi, son of Manawaiwaho and Te Apai, was given Kaitōrete and Te Waihora. Chief Huikai also established himself at Koukourarata (named after the stream in Wellington where Rākaitekura prepared her hair), and his son Tautahi took Ōtautahi (the site of present-day Christchurch). Tūāhuriri&#x27;s second eldest son Tūrakautahi, the famous chief of Ngāi Tūhaitara born with a club foot, established Te Kōhaka-a-kaikai-a-waro (now the Kaiapoi ) at the Taerutu Lagoon near Woodend, and claimed the area around Banks Peninsula.

With the discovery of Nōti Raureka (Browning Pass) by its namesake Raureka, of the West Coast Ngāti Wairangi, Ngāi Tūhaitara quickly developed an interest in Te Tai Poutini for the pounamu that can be found there. It is said to have been Tūrakautahi&#x27;s decision to learn the genealogies and traditions of Ngāti Wairangi and Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri, the former of which already shared a common ancestry with Ngāi Tahu through the ancestors Tura and Paikea, and the latter being of the like Ngāti Māmoe, Ngāi Tara, and Rangitāne. A similar approach was also taken to learn Waitaha&#x27;s genealogies and stories. Myths that Ngāi Tahu brought to the South Island themselves include those of the Takitimu Mountains (being the ) and the .

Tūrakautahi and one Te-ake narrowly escaped slaughter in Ngāti Wairangi territory after others had been slain for breaking sacred customs. Tūrakautahi&#x27;s brother Tānetiki, and two relatives Tūtaemaro and Tūtepiriraki, had not been so fortunate however. The brothers&#x27; uncle Hikatūtae chopped off their heads and returned to the rest of the family at Kaikōura. Makō-ha-kirikiri of Wairewa and Moki both avenged the deaths near where the bodies were found in the water, on the shores of Lake Mahinapua in the battle called . Moki was later cursed by two tohunga, Iriraki and Tautini, for insulting two women. He is said to be buried at Kaitukutuku, near the Waikūkū flaxmill. After the battle, Makō-ha-kirikiri established the Ōhiri , at Little River. Tūrakautahi further enlisted Te Rakitāmau&#x27;s aid in overcoming Ngāti Wairangi, killing their rangatira Te Uekanuka near Lake Kaniere.

Tūrakautahi&#x27;s son Kaweriri with his father-in-law Te Ruahikihiki had settled Taumutu at the southern end of Te Waihora. Kaweriri later travelled with a south to Lowther where he was slain by the Kāti Māmoe chief Tutemakohu around the year 1725 during the Battle of Waitaramea. Tūrakautahi&#x27;s other son by his wife Te Aowharepapa, Rakiāmoa, would continue the main lines of descent of Ngāi Tahu. Te Ruahikihiki&#x27;s own son Taoka, by his wife Te Aotaurewa, would push further south to Ōtākou, where he engaged in some of the final battles with Ngāti Māmoe.

Over time, marriages were arranged between Ngāi Tahu and Ngāti Māmoe to cement peace. Notably of Raki-ihia (Ngāti Māmoe) and Hinehākiri, the cousin of Ngāi Tahu&#x27;s leading chief Te-hau-tapunui-o-Tū, and of Honekai, son of Te-hau-tapunui-o-Tū, with Raki-ihia&#x27;s daughter Kohuwai. Despite this, occasional skirmishes still continued.

Tūhuru Kokare, a grandson of Tūrakautahi&#x27;s son Waewae (thus chief of Ngāti Waewae), became an active member in the battles against Ngāti Wairangi around the turn of the century. He first defeated them at Lake Brunner, and then began a campaign that moved down from the Karamea district, fighting battles at Whanganui Inlet, Kawatiri, Māwhera, Taramakau, Arahura, Hokitika, Ōkārito, and finally at Makawhio, with the final defeat occurring in Te Paparoa ranges. After their victory, Tūhuru&#x27;s party discussed at Rūnanga whether they should return home or stay in the area. A decision was not reached, so they discussed the matter again near Kaiata and Omotumotu after crossing Māwheranui, and made the decision to construct a at Māwhera. They became known as the .

==== Kaihuānga feud ====
The Kaihuānga feud of the 1820s heavily involved the (paramount chief) Tamaiharanui, whose status was so spiritually superior within the that people of lower ranking would avert their gaze and avoid looking at him directly. If his shadow fell upon food, that food became and had to be destroyed. The Kaihuānga feud is an historical instance that highlights the importance of the &#x27;s spiritual status, and the importance of . The feud sparked when a woman from the Waikakahi at Wairewa named Murihaka wore a dogskin cloak which belonged to Tamaiharanui, thus causing an insult to him. His followers then killed Rerewaka, a slave of one of Murihaka&#x27;s relatives. The relatives then responded by killing another chief, Hape.

Hape&#x27;s wife was a sister to two chiefs from the Taumutu at southern Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora. The people of Taumutu responded to Hape&#x27;s death by attacking Waikakahi, and killing several people. Tamaiharanui led a against Taumutu, and sacking it. The Taumutu then asked the of Otago for assistance, to which Taiaroa and Te Whakataupuka led a , and along with warriors from Kaiapoi, all attacked Waikakahi. They found the empty however, as Taiaroa had warned their people that the attackers would arrive with muskets. It is thought that this was the first instance of firearms in Canterbury.

Since they had killed nobody at Waikakahi, the Kaiapoi warriors feared ridicule. They happened across the nephew of Chief Taununu, of Rīpapa Island, and killed him. In retaliation Taununu overran the Whakaepa , near Coalgate, killing the inhabitants. The Otago attacked Waikakahi again, and although Taiaroa had again warned them, they were pursued and killed. Two of Tamaiharanui&#x27;s close kin, his sisters, were slaughtered. The Otago and Taumutu parties destroyed the Rīpapa before returning to Otago. Many settlements and communities along Banks Peninsula were abandoned in the series of retaliatory attacks.

Tamaiharanui then went to Otago and persuaded the Taumutu people to come back home, assuring that the war was over. He however returned first and lay in wait for the Taumutu people with muskets. According to Hakopa Te Ata-o-Tu, a member of Tamaiharanui&#x27;s party, Tamaiharanui became less enthusiastic about the attack when he realised the refugees had their own muskets. Nonetheless, he was convinced to attack, and the refugees were killed. The final act of the feud was the killing of Taununu, who was tomahawked to death along with his companion, near Ōtokitoki.

==== Wars with Ngāti Toa ====
In 1827–1828 Ngāti Toa, under the leadership of Te Rauparaha and armed with muskets, successfully attacked Kāti Kurī at Kaikōura, who were already expecting the Tū-te-pākihi-rangi of Ngāti Kahungunu as friendly visitors. He named the battle (&quot;Shark&#x27;s Tooth&quot;) after a threat from Rerewaka, a local chief. Ngāti Toa then visited Kaiapoi, ostensibly to trade. When Ngāti Toa attacked their hosts, the well-prepared Ngāi Tahu killed all the leading Ngāti Toa chiefs except Te Rauparaha who subsequently returned to his stronghold at Kapiti Island. During this time Ngati Tumatakokiri continued attacking the Poutini Ngāi Tahu from Kawatiri over land and hunting disputes, with Ngāti Rārua also attacking the Poutini Ngāi Tahu with muskets, seeking pounamu.

In November 1830 Te Rauparaha persuaded Captain John Stewart of the brig &quot;Elizabeth&quot; to carry him and his warriors in secret to Takapūneke near present-day Akaroa, where by subterfuge they captured Tamaiharanui and his wife and daughter. After destroying Takapūneke they embarked for Kapiti with their captives. Tamaiharanui strangled his daughter and threw her overboard to save her from slavery. Ngāti Toa killed the remaining captives. John Stewart, though arrested and sent to trial in Sydney as an accomplice to murder, nevertheless escaped conviction. Another captive, Hōne Tīkao (Ngāi Te Kahukura, Ngāi Tūāhuriri) did survive and would later visit France.

In the summer of 1831–1832 Te Rauparaha attacked the Kaiapoi . After a three-month siege, a fire in the allowed Ngāti Toa to overcome it. Ngāti Toa then attacked Ngāi Tahu on Banks Peninsula and took the at Onawe. In 1832–33 Ngāi Tahu retaliated under the leadership of Tūhawaiki, Taiaroa, Karetai, and Haereroa, attacking Ngāti Toa at Lake Grassmere. Ngāi Tahu prevailed, and killed many Ngāti Toa, although Te Rauparaha again escaped.

In 1834 Chief Iwikau, brother of Te Maiharanui, led a war party into the Marlborough Sounds, though Ngāti Toa had hidden from them and could not be found. The campaign was known as or .

Fighting continued for a year or so, with Ngāi Tahu maintaining the upper hand. In 1836 Chief Te Pūoho of Ngāti Tama, allied to Ngāti Toa, led his from Whanganui Inlet down to the West Coast to the Haast River. From there he crossed the Haast Pass into central Otago and Southland. Tūhawaiki had by now learned of this oncoming attack, and led his own from Ruapuke Island to Tuturau, where he fought and killed Te Pūoho.

Ngāti Toa never again made a major incursion into Ngāi Tahu territory. By 1839 Ngāi Tahu and Ngāti Toa established peace and Te Rauparaha released the Ngāi Tahu captives he held at Kapiti. Formal marriages between the leading families in the two tribes sealed the peace.

==== Treaty of Waitangi ====
In 1840 more than 500 chiefs from all over New Zealand signed the Treaty of Waitangi with representatives of the Crown. Only one sheet was used in the South Island – the Herald (Bunbury) sheet carried with Major Thomas Bunbury aboard which sailed from the Bay of Islands on 28 April. The Cook Strait (Henry Williams) sheet was used at Arapaoa Island and Rangitoto ki te Tonga / D&#x27;Urville Island at the northern end of the South Island, but was not signed by Ngāi Tahu.

The sheet&#x27;s first four signatures came from Coromandel Harbour one week later on 4 May, and the next two were signed aboard HMS &quot;Herald&quot; just off the Mercury Islands on 7 May. These signatures were collectively from the Ngāti Whanaunga, Ngāti Pāoa, and Ngāti Maru.

The first Ngāi Tahu signatory was Chief Iwikau at Akaroa on 30 May, followed by Hone Tīkao signing as John Love. His nephew was Hone Taare Tikao.

The third Ngāi Tahu signatory was Chief Tūhawaiki signing as John Touwaick aboard HMS &quot;Herald&quot; at Ruapuke Island on 10 June, who requested Kaikoura (possibly Kaikōura Whakatau) to sign on the same day, who was then followed by Taiaroa (or Tararoa; possibly Te Matenga Taiaroa).

The last Ngāi Tahu signatures were from Otago Heads on 13 June. The signatories were Hone Karetai (Ngāti Ruahikihiki, Ngāi Te Kahukura, Ngāi Tūāhuriri, Ngāti Hinekura) signing as John Karitai at Ōtākou, and one Korako (Ngāi Tūāhuriri, Ngāti Huirapa) whose identity is not known for certain, but could be either Hōne Wētere Kōrako, Kōrako Karetai, or Hoani Kōrako among others.

The last signatures mostly came from members of Ngāti Toa at Te Koko-o-Kupe / Cloudy Bay (17 June) and Mana Island (19 June) – including Te Rauparaha who had already signed the Cook Strait (Henry Williams) sheet on 14 May – and from three Ngāti Kahungunu members at Hawke&#x27;s Bay on 24 June, amounting to a total of 27 signatures for the sheet.

=== 20th century ===
==== Antarctica connection ====
At the very end of the 19th century a Ngāi Tahu man named William Timaru Joss (1844–1895), a Stewart Island whaler and captain of the mailboat &quot;Ulva&quot;, was a member of the first confirmed landing party of the &quot;Antarctic&quot; on the continent of Antarctica at Cape Adare, along with Captain Kristensen, Bull, Borchgrevink, and Tunzelmann in January 1895, making Joss the first known Māori to get so close to the continent. Timaru William Joss (1905–1955), William Timaru&#x27;s grandson, joined Admiral Richard E. Byrd&#x27;s expedition to Antarctica in 1935.

==== World War era ====

Over 270 individuals of Ngāi Tahu connection served during World War I, including some who fought with the New Zealand (Māori) Pioneer Battalion. A handful of notable servicemen included: Turu Rakerawa Hiroti, Hoani Parata, James William Tepene, and John Charles Tamanuiarangi Tikao, all of whom held the rank of captain. One soldier born of chiefly ranking was Private Hohepa Teihoka of Kaiapoi, who was nearly 19 years old when he arrived in Dardanelles in July 1915.

George Henry West (Kāi Te Rakiāmoa) was the first pilot of Māori-descent to join the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) in 1936. During a training flight on the night of 11 May 1939, his student accidentally undershot a landing exercise. West died of his injuries the following day. John Pohe was otherwise the first full-blooded Māori pilot to join the RNZAF in 1941.

Turu Rakerewa Hiroti and John Charles Tamanuiarangi Tikao would go on to serve during World War II. The former serving as a recruitment officer, and the latter serving as a captain with the Māori Battalion. Timaru William Joss also served with the United States Navy, in charge of a barge during the Normandy landings.

==== Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998 ====

The New Zealand Parliament passed the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act in 1998 to record an apology from the Crown and to settle claims made under the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. One of the Act&#x27;s provisions covered the use of dual English and Māori names for geographical locations in the Ngāi Tahu tribal area. The recognised tribal authority, Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu, is based in Christchurch and in Invercargill.

=== 21st century ===

==== South Island rivers claim ====

In 2021, the iwi began legal proceedings against the New Zealand government, claiming &quot;repeated failures over successive governments to protect the country&#x27;s waterways&quot; and further that &quot;the crown must recognise their &quot;rangatiratanga&quot; — governing authority and self-determination — over waterways stretching across most of the South Island&quot;. Acore contributor to the degradation of water quality has been the growth of intensive dairy farming over three decades which has left many South Island rivers with deficient streamflows and problematic nitratebased eutrophication. Between 1990 and 2020, the number of dairy cattle in the Canterbury region increased from 113,000 to over 1.2 million. Included in that number are Ngāi Tahu&#x27;s own cattle; the business arm of the iwi has a substantial farming investment.

== Dialect ==

In the 19th century many Ngāi Tahu, particularly in the southernmost reaches of the South Island, spoke a distinct dialect of the Māori language, sometimes referred to as &quot;Southern Māori&quot;, which was so different from the northern version of the language that missionary Rev. James Watkin, based at Karitane found materials prepared by North Island missions could not be used in Otago. However, from the 20th century to the early 21st century, the dialect came close to extinction and was officially discouraged.

Southern Māori contains almost all of the same phonemes as other Māori dialects (), along with the same diphthongs but lacks (&quot;ng&quot;), a sound that merged with in prehistoric times: becomes ). The change did not occur in the northern part of the Ngāi Tahu area, and the possible presence of additional phonemes () has been debated. Nonstandard consonants are sometimes identified in the spellings of South Island place names, such as &quot;g&quot; (as distinct from &quot;k&quot;, e.g., Katigi, Otago), &quot;v&quot; (e.g., Mavora), &quot;l&quot; instead of &quot;r&quot; (e.g., Little Akaloa, Kilmog, Waihola, Rakiula), and &quot;w&quot; or &quot;u&quot; instead of &quot;wh&quot; as reflecting dialect difference, but similar spellings and pronunciations also occur in the North Island (e.g. Tolaga Bay).

The apocope, the dropping of the final vowel of words, resulting from pronunciations like &#x27;Wacky-white&#x27; for &quot;Waikouaiti&quot; has been identified with Southern Māori. However, the devoicing, rather than apocope, of final vowels occurs in the speech of native Māori-speakers throughout New Zealand, and the pronunciation of the names of North Island towns by locals often omits final vowels as well, like in the pronunciation of &quot;Paraparam&quot; or &quot;Waiuk&quot;.

== Governance ==
Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu (TRoNT) is the governance entity of Ngāi Tahu, following the Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the and the New Zealand Government under Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998. It is also a mandated organisation under the Māori Fisheries Act 2004, an aquaculture organisation under the Māori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004, an authority under the Resource Management Act 1991 and a Tūhono organisation. It also represents Ngāi Tahu Whānui, the collective of including Waitaha, Ngāti Māmoe, and Ngāi Tahu, including, Ngāti Kurī, Ngāti Irakehu, Ngāti Huirapa, Ngāi Tūāhuriri, and Ngāi Te Ruahikihiki, under Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu Act 1996.

The interests of Ngāi Tahu cover a wide range of regions, including the territories of Tasman District Council, Marlborough District Council, West Coast Regional Council, Environment Canterbury, Otago Regional Council and Environment Southland, and the district councils which make up these regional councils.

/, as constituent areas of Ngāi Tahu, each have an elected board which then elect a representative to Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu. Ngāi Tahu has a very corporate structure, in part due to the death of an important (paramount chief), Te Maiharanui, at the time of the arrival of Europeans in New Zealand. Under the Resource Management Act, both the trust and local should be consulted with about natural resource matters. The 18 representatives of oversee Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu as a charitable trust. The (chairperson) from 2016 was Lisa Tumahai, the chief executive officer is Arihia Bennett, the general counsel is Chris Ford, and the trust is based in Addington, Christchurch. Justin Tipa, a board member, was appointed &quot;kaiwhakahaere&quot; in 2023. In 2024 Bennett stepped down as chief executive after 12 years in the role.

<text>Metrolink is a commuter rail system in Southern California, serving Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura counties, as well as to Oceanside in San Diego County. The system consists of eight lines and 69 stations operating on of track. This includes Arrow, which Metrolink operates under a contract with the San Bernardino County Transportation Authority (SBCTA).

In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

Metrolink connects with Los Angeles County&#x27;s Metro Rail and Metro Busway systems, North County Transit District&#x27;s Coaster commuter rail and Sprinter hybrid rail services, and with Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot;, &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;, &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;, &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;, and &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; inter-city rail services. Metrolink owns several hundred miles of track; however, it also shares track with freight railroads.

The system, founded in 1991 as the Southern California Regional Rail Authority (SCRRA) and adopting &quot;Metrolink&quot; as its moniker, started operation in 1992. Average weekday ridership was 42,928 as of 2017. It is operated by Amtrak under contract with the SCRRA.

== Routes ==
In addition to suburban communities and cities, Metrolink also serves several points of interest such as downtown Los Angeles, downtown San Bernardino, Burbank, Hollywood Burbank Airport, Cal State LA, Angel Stadium, and the San Clemente Pier. Special service has also been extended to the Pomona Fairplex, the Ventura County Fairgrounds, and Auto Club Speedway for certain events.

Weekend service is offered on all routes except the Riverside Line.

The system currently consists of eight lines:
== Fares ==
Metrolink&#x27;s fare structure is based on a flat fee for boarding the train and an additional distance cost with fares calculated in 25-cent increments between stations.

Metrolink tickets are valid fare for most connecting buses and trains; certain Metrolink tickets are valid on certain Amtrak routes.

Fare increases normally occur annually in July, to coincide with increased fuel and labor expenses, and have generally averaged between 3.5% and 5% per year (although restructuring caused a larger jump in rates). The oil price increases since 2003 are partly to blame for consistently increasing fares, as Metrolink trains are powered by diesel fuel.

In late 2018, Metrolink announced that San Bernardino Line ticket prices would be reduced by 25% at least through 2019 in an attempt to increase ridership. Similar discounts have been introduced to other lines since 2016.

In 2023, Metrolink made fares free for students of all ages.

== History ==
===Early organizing===

Inter-city rail service around Los Angeles persisted through the formation of Amtrak in 1971. Rail operations suitable for commuters remained elusive throughout the 1980s. On October 18, 1982, CalTrain, LA&#x27;s first commuter rail service, began on the existing Ventura County Line, but only lasted a few months before termination, on March 1, 1983.

The Orange County Transportation Commission initiated the Amtrak-operated &quot;Orange County Commuter&quot; in early 1990, running between Los Angeles and San Juan Capistrano, but a more comprehensive approach was deemed necessary. Senate Bill 1402 was signed into law on May 25, 1990, which directed local transportation authorities to establish a regional plan for commuter rail by the year&#x27;s end.

In October 1990, the member agencies of the SCRRA had announced the purchase of of track, maintenance yards, and stations and other property from Southern Pacific for $450 million in 1990 ($ adjusted for inflation). The rights to use Los Angeles Union Station were purchased from Union Pacific, the station&#x27;s owner at the time, for $17 million in the same year ($ adjusted for inflation) (Union Station has since been purchased by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority). Freight operations would continue on some corridors under coordination with passenger services. The joint powers authority was formally founded in 1991.

===Initial service and expansion===
Services commenced on October 26, 1992, under contracted operation by Amtrak with the Ventura, Santa Clarita (now the Antelope Valley), and San Bernardino Lines. In 1993, service was expanded to include the Riverside Line and the following year the Orange County Line was conveyed from Amtrak branding to Metrolink. The 1994 Northridge Earthquake saw the closure of Interstate 5 and other regional freeways, bringing widespread attention on Metrolink alternatives. Metrolink experimented with expanded service to Camarillo and Oxnard, and it extended the Antelope Valley line ten years ahead of schedule, rapidly adding six stations in six weeks. The Inland Empire-Orange County Line opened in 1995, and more trains on the Orange County service were funded. The 91 Line (now the 91/Perris Valley Line) opened in 2002.

From July 2004, Metrolink fares were changed from zone based to one based on distance. In 2005, a five-year operational contract was awarded to Connex Railroad/Veolia Transport. That same year, the Orange County Transportation Authority approved a plan to increase frequencies to 76 trains daily on the Orange County and Inland Empire-Orange County Lines by 2009, and funding for increased Metrolink service was included in the renewal of the Measure M sales tax for transportation approved by voters in November 2006. A proposed station in Yorba Linda was canceled after the city rejected it due to local opposition on March 16, 2004.

In July 2008, it was announced that ridership had risen 16% over the previous year. Following the 2008 Chatsworth train collision in which 25 people died and 135 were injured a number of safety measures were taken; in the fall of 2009, inward-facing video cameras were installed in locomotives in order to ensure that staff were complying with regulations, in particular a ban on use of mobile phones. In 2010, the first of 117 energy absorbing passenger carriages (which lessen the toll on passengers in the case of an accident) were received by the operator. Amtrak regained the contract to operate Metrolink beginning in July 2010. Average weekday ridership for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 38,400.

In 2010, to save money in the face of funding cuts, the Metrolink board voted to reduce mid-day service on the Inland Empire–Orange County Line, as well as weekend service on the Orange County, Riverside, and Inland Empire–Orange County lines.

Average weekday ridership was 41,000 during May 2011. A survey found that 90% of users during a typical weekday in 2009 would have previously driven alone or carpooled and that the system replaced an estimated 25,000 vehicle trips. During a weekend closure of Interstate 405 in July 2011, the system recorded its highest-ever weekend ridership of 20,000 boardings which was 50% higher than the same weekend in 2010 and 10% higher than the previous weekend ridership record which occurred during U2 360° Tour in June 2011. Ridership continued to rise in 2012 (up 2%), when average weekday ridership reached 42,265. Although 2013 annual boardings were almost 12.07 million, ridership dropped to 11.74 million by fall 2014 which was contrary to projections. Blaming the decrease on the worst recession since World War II, Metrolink said it found itself caught between cutting service and boosting fares, both of which would likely further decrease ridership.

Metrolink began offering mobile ticketing in early 2016.

The Riverside County Transportation Commission (RCTC) extended the 91 Line (which was renamed the 91/Perris Valley Line) southeast to Perris, using the existing San Jacinto Branch Line, which it purchased in 1993. Initial plans were for construction/renovation of the line to begin in 2012, but these were delayed by a lawsuit filed by homeowners in the affected area, who challenged the RCTC&#x27;s environmental report. The lawsuit was settled in late July 2013. Construction on the $248.3 million extension began in October 2013; service was originally planned to begin in December 2015, and then in February 2016. In mid-February 2016, the extension&#x27;s opening was planned in March of that year. The extension officially opened in June 2016.

When COVID-19 impacted Los Angeles and its communities in March 2020, Metrolink ridership fell by 90%. Metrolink increased cleaning measures, added COVID safety protocols, and reduced service. On March 26, 2020, the agency ran on a temporarily reduced schedule, removing most trains. 

On April 4, 2022, Metrolink restored its 24 trains and added 2 new trains to the schedule. Metrolink and Amtrak also entered into a code-sharing agreement on the Ventura County Line, with Pacific Surfliner trains A761, A770, A777, and A784 accepting valid Metrolink tickets between stations served by the Ventura County Line and Ventura station. Metrolink also announced that Metrolink service to Ventura station on the Ventura County Line is planned. Alstom will begin as the operator for Metrolink on July 1, 2025 for a three year contract period. The operating contract also includes the Arrowline service in San Bernardino county.

===Arrow expansion===
Arrow, formerly the Redlands Passenger Rail Project, opened on October 24, 2022. The eastward rail extension from San Bernardino to Redlands was planned by the San Bernardino Associated Governments (SANBAG). The association considered whether to extend commuter rail along the corridor or to install either bus rapid transit or light rail lines, but in December 2015, SANBAG officials said they planned to extend Metrolink service only to the San Bernardino Transit Center and use diesel multiple units operated by Omnitrans in lieu of Metrolink locomotive-hauled coaches on the rest of the route. In late 2019, Metrolink assumed the operating rights and carried out construction after Omnitrans was dismissed due to restructuring of that organization. Groundbreaking for Arrow&#x27;s construction took place on July 19, 2019. Arrow began operation on October 24, 2022.

218 people were killed in Metrolink train incidents from 1993 to 2008, the majority of these being pedestrians killed on the tracks, while 39 were as a result of three train collisions.

=== Placentia, 2002 ===

Two people died and 22 were seriously injured on April 23, 2002, when a BNSF freight train collided head-on with a Metrolink train in Placentia, near the Atwood Junction, at the intersection of Orangethorpe Avenue and Richfield Road. Both trains were on the same east–west track moving toward one another. The Metrolink had the right-of-way; it was supposed to switch to a southbound track. The BNSF train was supposed to slow and stop just before the switch while the Metrolink passed, but the crew missed a signal back warning them to slow down. By the time the crew saw the red &quot;stop&quot; signal at the switch and the Metrolink train, they were going too fast to avoid a collision. Although there was speculation that the signals alerting the BNSF to slow and stop had malfunctioned, an investigation later concluded that it was human error by the crew that caused the accident.

=== Glendale, 2005 ===

Eleven people were killed (including an off-duty sheriff&#x27;s deputy and a train conductor) and over 100 people were injured, about 40 seriously on January 26, 2005, when a Metrolink passenger train collided with a vehicle parked on the tracks, which then jackknifed and struck a stationary freight locomotive and a Metrolink train moving in the opposite direction. The man who parked the vehicle on the tracks, Juan Manuel Alvarez, was apprehended and charged with 11 counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances, including murder by train wrecking. On June 26, 2008, Alvarez was convicted on the 11 murder counts and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

=== Chatsworth, 2008 ===
Twenty-five people were killed and 135 injured when a Metrolink commuter train carrying 222 persons collided head on with a Union Pacific freight train, toppling one of the passenger cars and the locomotive onto its side in the Chatsworth district of Los Angeles. Of the 135 people who were injured, 81 were transported to local hospitals in serious or critical condition. The velocity of the trains caused the Metrolink locomotive to telescope into the first passenger car.

=== Oxnard, 2015 ===

Thirty people were injured when southbound Metrolink Ventura County Line train 102 (East Ventura to LA Union Station) crashed into a truck that was stopped on the tracks at the Rice Avenue crossing near Oxnard at about 5:40 am on February 24, 2015. One person, the train&#x27;s engineer, later died of his injuries. The driver, who had left the truck before the crash, was located by the police and taken into custody. The train consisted of a Hyundai-Rotem &quot;guardian fleet&quot; cab car in the lead, a Bombardier Bi-level &quot;bike car&quot; coach, two Hyundai-Rotem &quot;guardian fleet&quot; coach cars and an EMD F59PH locomotive. After this accident, Metrolink leased 40 diesel freight locomotives from BNSF, to be placed into service as temporary cab cars while they investigated problems with their Hyundai-Rotem cars. On July 8, 2016, the Metrolink board approved a $1.5 million plan to repair the plows on the Hyundai Rotem cab cars. Once the repairs were completed, the cars returned to service and the leased BNSF locomotives were returned.

== Planned expansions ==

Metrolink has grown in popularity, and there are a number of planned extensions of the system and new stations. Station parking capacity has also been strained.

===Train frequency increases and SCORE===
On April 26, 2018, Metrolink was awarded $1.175 billion from the California State Transportation Agency in order to dramatically increase train service along its existing lines and for the expansion of the Metrolink station in time for the 2028 Summer Olympics. These funds will be used to heavily increase frequency on Metrolink&#x27;s lines, with half-hourly frequencies planned on most routes.

=== High speed rail interface ===
During the initial years of operation of the California High-Speed Rail between Merced and Burbank, projected to commence in 2022 (but since repeatedly delayed to 2033), passengers would use Metrolink for travel between Burbank and Los Angeles. An alternative plan would have track-sharing to Union Station but this would require electrification for that portion of the line. Such an electrification would be similar to the Caltrain Modernization Program, which also involves electrifying a rail line for eventual use by commuter and high-speed trains. This alternate plan would provide a &quot;one-seat ride&quot; at the start of service between the Central Valley and downtown, or even Orange County (via Anaheim).

===Placentia infill station===
A new Metrolink station in Placentia, which will serve the 91/Perris Valley Line&#x27;s north Orange County passengers, has completed its final design phase, save for issues related to the parking needed to accompany the station. Construction on the $24 million Placentia station began in 2018, and was scheduled to open in 2024, but now is on hold pending further negotiations with BNSF.

===Burbank Junction speed improvement project===
On November 9, 2022, Metrolink broke ground on the Burbank Junction speed improvement project. The project will realign and replace the mainline track and siding between Burbank Boulevard and Magnolia Boulevard. The project will shorten trip lengths on the Antelope Valley Line trains, Ventura County Line trains, Pacific Surfliner trains, and Coast Starlight trains by one and a half minutes and will permit trains to operate with 30-minute headways in both directions, massively improving service frequencies along the corridors. The location of the tracks will be slightly realigned in order to accommodate a new pedestrian overcrossing. The project was delayed by almost one year, with the project initially scheduled to break ground in the winter of 2021 and was expected to be completed in the winter of 2022. The current expected completion date is the Summer of 2023.

===Expansion to Temecula and Hemet===
In 2008, lobbyists pushed for a rail line to Temecula in southwestern Riverside County via the 91 Line&#x27;s (now the 91/Perris Valley Line) Riverside–La Sierra station. While this proposed line could follow the route of an abandoned freight line, it would require significant funding, as freight service ceased almost 30 years ago. Despite this, the Riverside County Transportation Commission&#x27;s 2008 Commuter Rail Feasibility Study still lists this route as one possibility being considered. Expansion to Hemet has also been discussed, with two stations planned.

===Expansion to the Coachella Valley/Palm Springs Area===
The cities of the Coachella Valley Palm Springs Area (Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Palm Desert, Indio, and Coachella) have requested commuter rail service from Los Angeles and Orange County, but the Union Pacific Railroad opposes further passenger service on its tracks. Nonetheless, in 1999, the Coachella Valley Association of Governments was investigating the possibility of two daily round trips via the Riverside Line from Los Angeles&#x27;s Union Station through Fullerton and Riverside to stations in Palm Springs and Indio (with a possible stop near Palm Desert), possibly through a partnership with Amtrak. This extension would likewise require significant money for infrastructure improvements: at least $500 million, according to the California State Rail Plan of 2005. Nonetheless, in 2013 Caltrans conducted a feasibility study of a Coachella Valley service and RCTC has resolved to pursue establishing one. By 2020, plans for the Coachella Valley–San Gorgonio Pass Rail Corridor Service had evolved to an Amtrak-operated service.

===Extension to Kern County===
Expansion to Kern County has been discussed in a 2012 Kern County Council of Governments report. The expansion proposed is to extend the Antelope Valley line from Lancaster to Rosamond, along the Rosamond Corridor to service Edwards Air Force Base.

===Service between the cities Ventura and Santa Clarita===
The Santa Paula Branch Line was acquired by the Ventura County Transportation Commission in 1995. The railway, a former portion of the Southern Pacific Coast Line, connects the city of Ventura to Santa Clarita paralleling California State Route 126. Sierra Northern Railway operates the services on the line. Plans exist to rehabilitate tracks for Metrolink service. A study from 1991 estimated a cost between $70 million to $90 million to rebuild the line.

===Service to Santa Barbara County===
The Santa Barbara County Association of Governments (SBCAG) has announced plans for Metrolink service to/from Goleta to begin in fall 2025, starting with one daily trip in each direction.

===Orange County maintenance facility===
As of December 1, 2022, the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) has laid a third track south of the Interstate 5 overpass in Irvine leading into the future site of the Orange County maintenance facility. The facility will serve as an additional site to service Metrolink and Amtrak trains on a parcel of land owned by the Orange County Transportation Authority just north of Irvine station. The project will receive funding from California&#x27;s SCORE Transit Intercity Rail Capital Program. The project also includes an extension to Ridge Valley, a road north of the parcel where the project will occur.

===Zero Emissions Multiple Unit===
Beginning in 2024, Arrow will use at least one hydrail unit, called a Zero Emissions Multiple Unit (ZEMU). Furthermore, the San Bernardino County Transportation Authority (SBCTA) has expressed interest to expand usage of the ZEMU from Arrow to the San Bernardino Line, which would result in them operating all the way to Los Angeles Union Station.

===Orange County Line realignment===
OCTA officials are interested in moving the LOSSAN corridor (Los Angeles-San Diego), which carries the Orange County Line and the &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot;, from its current alignment inland to avoid service disruptions due to coastal erosion along the route.

===LA General Medical Center and Pico Rivera infill stations===
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA Metro) has plans to add the current LA General Medical Center station on the El Monte Busway as an infill station to the San Bernardino Line. This would involve building a second track and center platform. The cost of this project is estimated between $51 million and $110 million. Currently, westbound Metrolink passengers must exit at the Cal State LA station and take any of the westbound buses one stop to the Medical Center.

LA Metro also has plans for an infill station serving Pico Rivera, located on the 91/Perris Valley and Orange County lines between and stations.

== Governance ==
The SCRRA is a joint powers authority governed by five county-level agencies that fund the Metrolink service: the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Orange County Transportation Authority, the Riverside County Transportation Commission, the San Bernardino County Transportation Authority, and the Ventura County Transportation Commission.

Each agency appoints members to the Metrolink board of directors. Los Angeles gets four seats on the board, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties each get two seats, and Ventura County gets one seat. There are also three non-voting, e&quot;x-officio&quot; members from the Southern California Association of Governments, the San Diego Association of Governments, and the state of California.

Metrolink is headquartered at the Wilshire Grand Center alongside the Southern California Association of Governments. Metrolink had previously operated out of the Metro Headquarters Building from 2011 until 2018, when Metro needed more space in their building. Before 2011, Metrolink&#x27;s headquarters were in the MCI Center, where they occupied around of space.

Law enforcement service systemwide is handled by the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department&#x27;s Transit Services Bureau.

== Facilities ==
Metrolink operates several maintenance facilities across its service area. Its Keller Yard Central Maintenance Facility (CMF) is located on the east bank of the Los Angeles River near the intersection of the 5 and 110 Freeways, just south of the location of the former Southern Pacific Taylor Yard. The facility is operated by Metrolink&#x27;s equipment maintenance contractor: Bombardier Transportation. The Eastern Maintenance Facility is located in San Bernardino. Metrolink trains are also serviced at Coaster&#x27;s Stuart Mesa Facility, which is located between San Clemente Pier and Oceanside at the southwest end of Camp Pendleton. This yard is owned by the North County Transit District.

Metrolink&#x27;s operations center is located in Pomona, near Pomona–North station.

== Rolling stock ==

The core Metrolink fleet consists of 60 locomotives, 137 Bombardier BiLevel Coaches (called the “Sentinel Fleet” by Metrolink), and 137 Rotem Commuter Cars (called the “Guardian Fleet”).

Since Arrow’s opening in October 2022, its fleet consists of three Stadler FLIRT self-propelled trainsets.

=== Livery ===
Until recently, most Metrolink-owned units were painted in a white livery with blue stripes that was introduced in the late 1990s as a replacement for a similar scheme that had been in use since the agency&#x27;s launch. Beginning in 2007, the agency began the process of switching to a new blue and green &quot;ribbons&quot; design; the Guardian Fleet and EMD F125 locomotives already arrive from the factory in the new colors. With the introduction of the 2022 rebranding in celebration of the agency&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary that included a new two-toned blue logo, newly-refurbished rolling stock is currently in delivery wearing these colors starting in 2024.

<text>His Last Bow: Some Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes is a 1917 collection of previously published Sherlock Holmes stories by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, including the titular short story, &quot;His Last Bow. The War Service of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1917). The collection&#x27;s first US edition adjusts the anthology&#x27;s subtitle to &quot;Some Later Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

All editions contain a brief preface, by &quot;John H. Watson, M.D.&quot;, that assures readers that as of the date of publication, Holmes is long retired from his profession of detective but is still alive and well, albeit suffering from a touch of rheumatism.

==Publication history==
The book was published in the UK by John Murray in October 1917, and in the US by George H. Doran Co. that same month.

The collection contains &quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot;, which was also included in the first American edition of &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1894) but was dropped from later editions of that book.

Six of the stories were published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; between September 1908 and December 1913. &quot;The Strand&quot; published &quot;The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge&quot; as &quot;A Reminiscence of Sherlock Holmes&quot; and divided it into two parts, called &quot;The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles&quot; and &quot;The Tiger of San Pedro&quot;. Later printings of &quot;His Last Bow&quot; correct &quot;Wistaria&quot; to &quot;Wisteria&quot;.

The final story, &quot;His Last Bow. The War Service of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1917), an epilogue about Holmes&#x27; war service, was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 22 September 1917—one month before the book&#x27;s premiere on 22 October.

<doc id="591632" wikidata="Q152872" url="?curid=591632" title="Ball's Pyramid">
<text>Ball&#x27;s Pyramid is an uninhabited islet in the Pacific Ocean located southeast of Lord Howe Island, between Australia and New Zealand. The steep rocky basalt outcrop is the eroded plug of a shield volcano and caldera that formed 6.4million years ago. It is high, while measuring in length and only across, making it the tallest volcanic stack in the world.

Ball&#x27;s Pyramid, which is part of Australia&#x27;s Lord Howe Island Marine Park, is positioned in the centre of a submarine shelf surrounded by rough seas, which makes any approach difficult.

==History==
===Discovery===
The pyramid is named after Royal Navy Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball, who reported discovering it in 1788. On the same voyage, Ball also discovered Lord Howe Island, Ball&#x27;s Pyramid&#x27;s nearest landmass.

In &quot;The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay with an Account of the Establishment of the Colonies of Port Jackson and Norfolk Island&quot; (1789), Arthur Phillip gives this description of the area around Ball&#x27;s Pyramid before describing Lord Howe Island:

There lies about four miles from the south-west part of the pyramid, a dangerous rock, which shows itself a little above the surface of the water, and appears not to be larger than a boat. Lieutenant Ball had no opportunity of examining whether there is a safe passage between them or not.

===Survey and exploration===

In May 1853, Henry Mangles Denham with and surveyed the area around Lord Howe Island including Ball&#x27;s Pyramid, producing the first chart of the pyramid.

The first recorded person to go ashore is believed to have been Henry Wilkinson, a geologist at the New South Wales Department of Mines, in 1882.

In 1964, a team from Sydney attempted to climb to the summit of the pyramid. However, the climbers were forced to turn back on the fifth day as they ran short of food and water. The expedition was the idea of Australian adventurer Dick Smith, who was a member of Rover Scouts at the time. The expedition also involved other members of the Scouting movement and other people. Smith went on the expedition, but did not attempt the climb due to an unexpected medical operation two weeks before the expedition.

Ball&#x27;s Pyramid was first climbed on 14 February 1965 by Bryden Allen, John Davis, Jack Pettigrew and David Witham of the Sydney Rock Climbing Club. Jack Hill of New Zealand then climbed to the summit with Pettigrew on the following day. Don Willcox and Ben Sandilands were part of the support team.

In 1979, Smith returned to the pyramid, together with climbers John Worrall and Hugh Ward. They successfully reached the summit and unfurled a flag of New South Wales provided to them by Premier Neville Wran.

Climbing was banned in 1982 under amendments to the Lord Howe Island Act, and in 1986, all access to the island was banned by the Lord Howe Island Board. In 1990, the policy was relaxed to allow some climbing under strict conditions, which in recent years has required an application to the relevant state minister.

==Geography==

Like Lord Howe Island and the Lord Howe Seamount Chain, Ball&#x27;s Pyramid is based on the Lord Howe Rise, part of the submerged continent of Zealandia. Ball&#x27;s Pyramid has a few satellite islets. Observatory Rock and Wheatsheaf Islet lie about west-northwest and west-southwest respectively, of the western extremity of Ball&#x27;s Pyramid. Southeast Rock is a pinnacle located about southeast of Ball&#x27;s Pyramid.

The shelf is in length and averages in width and lies under an average depth of of water. It is separated by a submarine canyon from another shelf on which Lord Howe Island is located. The cliffs of the stack continue under the water surface to the level of the shelf.

==Flora and fauna==
===&quot;Melaleuca howeana&quot;===
A &quot;Melaleuca howeana&quot; shrub was found growing on Ball&#x27;s Pyramid. The bush was growing in a small crevice where water was seeping through cracks in the underlying rocks. This moisture supported relatively lush plant growth which had, over time, resulted in a buildup of plant debris several metres deep.

===&quot;Dryococelus australis&quot;===
Ball&#x27;s Pyramid supports the last known wild population of the Lord Howe Island stick insect (&quot;Dryococelus australis&quot;).

Following the last sighting of the Lord Howe Island stick insect on Lord Howe Island in 1920, the species was presumed extinct. Evidence of continued survival on Ball&#x27;s Pyramid was discovered during the 1964 climb when a dead specimen was found and photographed. Throughout the following years, several more dead specimens were discovered, but attempts to find live specimens were unsuccessful.

In 2001, a team of entomologists and conservationists landed on Ball&#x27;s Pyramid to chart its flora and fauna. As they had hoped, they discovered a population of the Lord Howe Island stick insect living in an area of , at a height of above the shoreline, under a single &quot;M. howeana&quot; shrub. The population was extremely small, with only 24 individuals. Two pairs were brought to mainland Australia, and new populations have been successfully bred with the ultimate goal of reintroduction to Lord Howe Island.

In 2014, an unauthorised climbing team sighted live stick insects in an exposed position below the summit of Ball&#x27;s Pyramid in a thicket of sedge plants, suggesting that the insect&#x27;s range on Ball&#x27;s Pyramid is more widespread than previously held, and that its food preferences are not limited to &quot;Melaleuca howeana&quot;.

<text>Svipdagsmál (Old Norse: , &#x27;The Lay of Svipdagr&#x27;) is an Old Norse poem, sometimes included in modern editions of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, comprising two poems, &quot;The Spell of Gróa&quot; and &quot;The Lay of Fjölsviðr&quot;.

The two works are grouped since they have a common narrator, Svipdagr. Moreover, they would appear to have a common origin since they are closely similar in use of language, structure, style and metre (ljóðaháttr). These two poems are found in several 17th-century paper manuscripts. In at least three of these manuscripts, the poems are in reverse order and separated by a third Eddic poem titled &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;. For a long time, the connection between the two poems was not realized, until in 1854 Svend Grundtvig pointed out a connection between the story told in &quot;Grógaldr&quot; and the first part of the medieval Scandinavian ballad of &quot;Ungen Sveidal&quot;/&quot;Herr Svedendal&quot;/&quot;Hertig Silfverdal&quot; (TSB A 45, DgF 70, SMB 18, NMB 22). Then in 1856, Sophus Bugge noticed that the last part of the ballad corresponded to &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;. Bugge wrote about this connection in &quot;Forhandlinger i Videnskabs-Selskabet i Christiania&quot; 1860, calling the two poems together &quot;Svipdagsmál&quot;. Subsequent scholars have accepted this title.

==Poems==
===&quot;Grógaldr&quot;===

In the first poem, the young Svipdagr has been compelled to come to Menglöð by his cruel stepmother. To accomplish this seemingly impossible task, he summons the shade of his mother, Gróa, a völva or witch, to aid him in this task. She casts nine spells (a significant number in Norse mythology).

===&quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;===

In the second poem, Svipdag, having survived the rigours of the journey, is confronted by the eponymous giant watchman, Fjölsviðr. Fjölsviðr is one of the names of the principal of the gods of Asgard, Odin. Fjölsviðr tells him to go away, while asking him his name; Svipdagr wisely conceals his name. A game consisting of question and answer riddles ensues, wherein Svipdagr learns that Menglöð lives in the castle guarded by the Fjölsviðr, and that the castle may not be entered by any save one: Svipdagr. He gives his true name and the gates are opened and Menglöð greets her saviour.

==Theories==
To date, scholarship has reached no consensus on the meaning of the poems, producing a number of competing theories. Jacob Grimm (1835) identified Menglöð (Old Norse &quot;the one who takes pleasure in jewels&quot;) with Freyja. Viktor Rydberg (1889) identified Svipdagr as Freyja&#x27;s husband Óðr, Menglöð herself as Freyja, and Fjölsviðr representing Odin. Hjalmar Falk (1893) is inclined to see the influence of Grail-poems. Jan de Vries (1941) concluded that the author had formed an Eddic poem out of a fairy story of an enchanted princess and her lover, through borrowing and invention. Otto Höfler (1952) and F.R. Schröder (1966) discerned elements of the myth and ritual which treat the reawakening of the earth beneath the rays of the sun each spring. Einar Ólafur Sveinsson (1975) suggests that the substance of the poem comes from the Irish legend of Art mac Cuinn. Lotte Motz (1975) argues that the poem represents the initiation of a young hero into a mother-goddess cult, identifying Svipdagr&#x27;s mother Gróa with his lover, Menglöð, based primarily on a limited interpretation of the word &quot;mögr&quot; in &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot; 47. More recently, John McKinnell (2005) has stated: &quot;There is no need to identify Menglöð with Gróa, and the attempt to see Gróa’s spells as an initiatory ritual distorts the obvious meaning of several of them.&quot;

<text>Sir Malcolm Stanley Bradbury, (7 September 1932 – 27 November 2000) was an English author and academic.

==Life==
Bradbury was born in Sheffield, the son of a railwayman. His family moved to London in 1935, but returned to Sheffield in 1941 with his brother and mother. The family later moved to Nottingham and in 1943 Bradbury attended West Bridgford Grammar School, where he remained until 1950. He read English at University College, Leicester, gaining a first-class degree in 1953. He continued his studies at Queen Mary College, University of London, where he gained his MA in 1955.

Between 1955 and 1958, Bradbury moved between teaching posts with the University of Manchester and Indiana University in the United States. He returned to England in 1958 for a major heart operation; such was his heart condition that he was not expected to live beyond middle age. In 1959, while in hospital, he completed his first novel, &quot;Eating People is Wrong&quot;.

Bradbury married Elizabeth Salt and they had two sons. He took up his first teaching post as an adult-education tutor at the University of Hull. With his study on Evelyn Waugh in 1962 he began his career of writing and editing critical books. From 1961 to 1965 he taught at the University of Birmingham. He completed his PhD in American studies at the University of Manchester in 1962, moving to the University of East Anglia (his second novel, &quot;Stepping Westward&quot;, appeared in 1965), where he became Professor of American Studies in 1970 and launched the MA in Creative Writing course, attended by both Ian McEwan and Kazuo Ishiguro.

He published &quot;Possibilities: Essays on the State of the Novel&quot; in 1973, &quot;The History Man&quot; in 1975, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in 1976, &quot;Rates of Exchange&quot; in 1983 and &quot;Cuts: A Very Short Novel&quot; in 1987. He retired from academic life in 1995.

Bradbury became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1991 for services to literature and was made a Knight Bachelor in the New Year Honours 2000, again for services to literature.

Bradbury died at Priscilla Bacon Lodge, Colman Hospital, Norwich, on 27 November 2000, attended by his wife and their two sons, Matthew and Dominic. He was buried on 4 December 2000 in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s parish church, Tasburgh, near Norwich where the Bradburys owned a second home. Though he was not an orthodox religious believer, he respected the traditions and socio-cultural role of the Church of England and enjoyed visiting churches in the spirit of Philip Larkin&#x27;s poem, &quot;Church Going&quot;.

==Works==
Bradbury was a productive academic writer as well as a successful teacher; an expert on the modern novel, he published books on Evelyn Waugh, Saul Bellow and E. M. Forster, as well as editions of such modern classics as F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, and a number of surveys and handbooks of modern fiction, both British and American. However, he is best known to a wider public as a novelist. Although often compared with his contemporary David Lodge, a friend who has also written campus novels, Bradbury&#x27;s books are consistently darker in mood and less playful both in style and language. In 1986, he wrote a short humorous book titled &quot;Why Come to Slaka?&quot;, a parody of travel books, dealing with Slaka, the fictional Eastern European country that is the setting for his novel &quot;Rates of Exchange&quot;, a 1983 novel that was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.

Bradbury also wrote extensively for television, including scripting series such as &quot;Anything More Would Be Greedy&quot;, &quot;The Gravy Train&quot; (and its sequel, &quot;The Gravy Train Goes East&quot;, which explored life in Bradbury&#x27;s fictional Slaka), and adapting novels such as Tom Sharpe&#x27;s &quot;Blott on the Landscape&quot; and &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot;, Alison Lurie&#x27;s &quot;Imaginary Friends&quot;, Kingsley Amis&#x27;s &quot;The Green Man&quot;, and the penultimate &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; episode &quot;The Wench is Dead&quot;. His last television script was for &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot; series 5, produced by Andy Rowley. The episode &quot;Foreign Bodies&quot; was screened on BBC One on 15 July 2000.

His work was often humorous and ironic, mocking academe, British culture, and communism, usually with a picaresque tone.

<text>The White Rabbit is a fictional and anthropomorphic character in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 1865 book &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. He appears at the very beginning of the book, in chapter one, wearing a waistcoat, and muttering &quot;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!&quot; Alice follows him into Wonderland. Alice encounters him again when he mistakes her for his housemaid Mary Ann and she becomes trapped in his house after growing too large. The Rabbit shows up again in the last few chapters, as a herald-like servant of the King and Queen of Hearts.

==Personality==

In his article &quot;Alice on the Stage&quot;, Carroll wrote, &quot;And the White Rabbit, what of him? Was &quot;he&quot; framed on the &#x27;Alice&#x27; lines, &quot;or&quot; meant as a contrast? As a contrast, distinctly. For &quot;her&quot; &#x27;youth&#x27;, &#x27;audacity&#x27;, &#x27;vigour&#x27;, and &#x27;swift directness of purpose&#x27;, read &#x27;elderly&#x27;, &#x27;timid&#x27;, &#x27;feeble&#x27;, and &#x27;nervously shilly-shallying&#x27;, and you will get something of what I meant him to be. I think the White Rabbit should wear spectacles. I&#x27;m sure his voice should quaver, and his knees quiver and his whole air suggest a total inability to say &#x27;Boo&#x27; to a goose!&quot;

Overall, the White Rabbit seems to shift back and forth between pompous behaviour toward his underlings, such as his servants, and grovelling, obsequious behaviour toward his superiors, such as the Duchess, and the King and Queen of Hearts, in direct contrast to Alice, who is reasonably polite to everyone she meets.

The White Rabbit&#x27;s perennial unpunctuality is a nod to Oxford time, the tradition at Oxford (and especially Christ Church, where Carroll taught) of having events begin five minutes past the scheduled hour.

==Adaptations and in popular culture==

===Disney film===
Disney&#x27;s animated version of the Rabbit is perhaps best known for the little song he sings on his first appearance, &quot;I&#x27;m late! I&#x27;m late! For a very important date! No time to say hello, goodbye! I&#x27;m late! I&#x27;m late! I&#x27;m late!&quot;. His initial panicky behaviour is presumably because he is late for the royal garden party where he is due to act as herald; this would be quite enough for him to lose his head to the touchy Queen.

He is often the straight man for other characters&#x27; zany antics; when he asks the Dodo for help on getting the &quot;monster&quot; (Alice) out of his house, Dodo&#x27;s ultimate solution is to burn the house down, to which the White Rabbit is greatly opposed. At the Mad Tea Party, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare try to &quot;fix&quot; his watch, proclaiming it &quot;exactly two days slow,&quot; and eventually destroy it in their efforts to correct it.

The Rabbit was voiced by Bill Thompson.

The White Rabbit appears at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts as a meetable character.

In &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot;, the Genie was transformed into him.

The White Rabbit made a few appearances on the Disney Channel original show, &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. His most notable appearance was in the episode &quot;Clarabelle&#x27;s Big Secret&quot; when he confessed to Clarabelle Cow that &quot;I&#x27;m not really late, and I don&#x27;t really have a date. I&#x27;m a fraud!&quot;. He is seen being grabbed by the reservation clerk Daisy Duck in the show&#x27;s intro. He was voiced by Corey Burton, who has voiced the Rabbit in all English speaking roles for the character since then until in &quot;&quot;, where his voice was provided by Jeff Bennett.

In the PlayStation 2 action-RPG game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and its Game Boy Advance follow-up, &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot;, the White Rabbit leads Sora, Donald Duck and Goofy to the Queen&#x27;s palace, worried about being late. His Japanese voice actor was Shigeru Ushiyama.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; short &quot;Plusaversary&quot;, Disney&#x27;s White Rabbit made a brief appearance in Moe&#x27;s Tavern.

In the television series &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland Bakery&quot;, his great grandson Fergie is one of the main characters. In the episode &quot;Potato Potahto&quot; is shown a photo of Alice and the White Rabbit where they made the potato dish together in Wonderland.

The White Rabbit has a cameo appearance in the short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot; (2023), as part of the Walt Disney Animation Studios characters who gather to take a group photo.
===Švankmajer film===

The 1988 Czechoslovak film &quot;Alice&quot;, noted for its disturbing interpretation of Carroll&#x27;s story, shows a dark stop-motion version of the character. At the beginning of the film, the White Rabbit starts out as a stuffed rabbit that comes alive in Alice&#x27;s bedroom and breaks out of his glass case; he leaks sawdust through a hole in his chest. During Alice&#x27;s pursuit of the White Rabbit in Wonderland, he physically attacks her with paddles, a hacksaw, and a group of skeletal animals. The White Rabbit is also the Queen of Hearts&#x27; executioner, using scissors to behead the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and other characters. Upon awakening from her dream and finding the White Rabbit missing from his case, Alice finds his scissors and resolves to behead him herself.

===Tim Burton film===
The White Rabbit works for the Red Queen, but is also a secret member of the Underland Underground Resistance, and was sent by the Hatter to search for Alice. Actor Michael Sheen stated, &quot;The White Rabbit is such an iconic character that I didn&#x27;t feel like I should break the mould too much.&quot; In this film adaption, the White Rabbit is given the name Nivens McTwisp.

McTwisp appears in the video game adaptation of Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; as a playable character. He attacks using his watch and can manipulate time.

===Other films===

* In &quot;The Matrix&quot;, there are several metaphysical &quot;waking up&quot; metaphors that reference the Wonderland stories. Early in the film, Neo is told to follow the &quot;White Rabbit&quot; and seconds later, his doorbell rings, and when he opens the door he finds a woman with a tattoo of a white rabbit on her shoulder. Later in the film, Morpheus offers him the &quot;red pill&quot; to &quot;&quot;.

Later in the film, she does this and nearly kills military staff members.
* In &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot;, Genie briefly transforms into the White Rabbit and even quotes his famous line of &quot;I&#x27;m late, I&#x27;m late, for a very important date!&quot; (in context, it was due to Genie being late regarding actually announcing the arrival of the bride and groom for Jasmine and Aladdin&#x27;s wedding upon realizing the guests have already seated).

* In the Syfy &quot;Alice&quot;, The White Rabbit is a secret organisation that works for the Queen of Hearts and abducts people from the real world, so they can gamble in the Queen&#x27;s casino. The actual character is represented by a member of the organisation called Agent White who kidnaps Jack (Alice&#x27;s fiancé, the Jack of Hearts) and tries to retrieve a magic ring called the Stone of Wonderland from Alice. When it is found out that he failed his mission, the Queen has him executed.
* In &quot;Lost&quot;, the White Rabbit has alluded to several times in the series.

When the winged monkeys that worked for the Wicked Witches of the North, South, East, and West pursue him, the White Rabbit is saved by Mamaragan, Eugene Choi, and Pedro Peña. Afterwards, Mamaragan asks where Alice is. The White Rabbit then accompanies them to meet up with Alice and Dorothy Gale. As the group roasts apples and cucumbers at the campfire later that night, the White Rabbit learns of Eugene and Pedro&#x27;s trip through the Funlands and the Gamelands. When everyone meets up in the Wozenderlands after Shazam and Lady Shazam protected Scarecrow and the Munchkins from the Cheshire Cat, White Rabbit gives Scarecrow the axe that belonged to the Tin Man while apologising for what the Queen of Hearts and her Card Soldiers did to him. When Mister Mind has Shazam cast a spell to unite the seven Magiclands, Scarecrow and White Rabbit start to see the effects of it.

However, after absorbing too much of Ariko&#x27;s emotions for years, the White Rabbit has become deranged and murderous. Throughout most of the game, he appears as a mirage to Ariko and is confronted in person after Ariko learns that the White Rabbit has been disguising himself as her female friend &quot;Yukino&quot; in the real world. In his real form, the White Rabbit has a very humanoid body and wears human clothes, which is heavily suggested to resemble Ariko&#x27;s deceased father.
* In &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;, the White Rabbit is responsible for Alice&#x27;s return to Wonderland. He is first seen as Alice&#x27;s soft toy, then becomes something that resembles a shrivelled version of the John Tenniel illustration. When Alice is chasing him in the Village of the Doomed, he shrinks and goes down a hole. Alice follows him by shrinking herself with a hand-made potion. They meet again in the Wonderland Woods, where he tells her to find Caterpillar. Later, he is killed by the Mad Hatter who crushes him under his foot but is revived after Alice defeated the Queen of Hearts. He reappears as a minor character in the sequel &quot;Alice Madness Returns&quot;, first in the opening sequence of the game, and then as a host of some mini-games (along with the Mad Hatter).
* In the Nintendo DS RPG &quot;A Witch&#x27;s Tale&quot;, the White Rabbit forces its way before the main character Liddell. It can be an unlockable plush for fighting too.
* Rockstar&#x27;s game &quot;Manhunt&quot; features a level called &quot;Kill the Rabbit.&quot; In this stage, the player hunts down a man wearing a white rabbit suit, which the game&#x27;s antagonist describes as &quot;Wonderland fun&quot;.
* In the &quot; Eye of the North&quot; expansion of &quot;Guild Wars&quot;, finding the boss &quot;Nulfastu Earthbound&quot; requires the player to follow a white rabbit into a rabbit hole. When the player enters, the boss appears, along with a large amount of other hostile monsters, that easily overwhelms an unprepared group of players.
* There is a reference to the White Rabbit in &quot;&quot;.
* In &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; MIPS the rabbit references the White Rabbit with a few lines, such as &quot;I&#x27;m late for an important date.&quot;
* In &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, one of the NPCs in Hyrule Castle Town&#x27;s square is running in a circle and says &quot;I&#x27;m late, I&#x27;m late, for a very important date.&quot;
* In &quot;Heart no Kuni no Alice&quot;, a dating sim game made for the PC, PSP, and the PS2 with the theme of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, has a man named &quot;Peter White&quot; in which Peter White takes the role of the White Rabbit in Wonderland.
* In &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme Venus Vacation&quot;, the 4.5 anniversary event had Luna play the role of the White Rabbit, including drawing the Owner to Wonderland after fleeing (though in this case in response to a telling off from Misaki).

Her love for the play leads to her refusing to allow them to leave, instead wanting them to stay within her grasp forever.
* He was referenced in &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot; by Homer Simpson where he dreams he was in a world made of candy of all kind, (in which it is the tutorial level of the game). A white rabbit made of white chocolate calls him out to not consume their world. In which Homer tells him he reminds him of the character from the story, (although he thinks it is titled “Snow White in stupid town”) the rabbit then lures him to the top of a giant cake to “have a bite of him” (just a way to make homer follow him to finish the tutorial level) after beating up as many chocolate rabbit enemies he finally catches up to him. Only to be killed by Homer. In which he’s woken up to realize he was dreaming and gets upset about it.
* The White Rabbit takes on the role of narrator, guiding players through the detective quest in Sherlock: Hidden Match-3 Cases, developed by G5 Entertainment in 2020, one of the featured stories is The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

===Other Influences===
A military trench-digging machine developed by the British Royal Navy at the beginning of World War II was originally known as &quot;White Rabbit No. 6&quot;, but the name was changed to &quot;Cultivator No. 6&quot; to conceal its identity.

In the 2010s, the phrase &quot;Follow the White Rabbit&quot; became popular among QAnon adherents, as the initiator of the conspiracy theory often used it to encourage his followers to do their own research about the purported &quot;cabal&quot; running the United States.

<text>Dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, 5α-DHT, androstanolone or stanolone) is an endogenous androgen sex steroid and hormone primarily involved in the growth and repair of the prostate and the penis, as well as the production of sebum and body hair composition.

The enzyme 5α-reductase catalyzes the formation of DHT from testosterone in certain tissues including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, epididymides, skin, hair follicles, liver, and brain. This enzyme mediates reduction of the C4-5 double bond of testosterone. DHT may also be synthesized from progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone via the androgen backdoor pathway in the absence of testosterone. Relative to testosterone, DHT is considerably more potent as an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR).

In addition to its role as a natural hormone, DHT has been used as a medication, for instance in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men; for information on DHT as a medication, see the androstanolone article.

==Biological function==
DHT is biologically important for sexual differentiation of the male genitalia during embryogenesis, maturation of the penis and scrotum at puberty, growth of facial, body, and pubic hair, and development and maintenance of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. It is produced from the less potent testosterone by the enzyme 5α-reductase in select tissues, and is the primary androgen in the genitals, prostate gland, seminal vesicles, skin, and hair follicles.

DHT signals act mainly in an intracrine and paracrine manner in the tissues in which it is produced, playing only a minor role, if any, as a circulating endocrine hormone. Circulating levels of DHT are one-tenth and one-twentieth those of testosterone in terms of total and free concentrations, respectively, whereas local DHT levels may be up to 10 times those of testosterone in tissues with high 5α-reductase expression such as the prostate gland. In addition, unlike testosterone, DHT is inactivated by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) into the very weak androgen 3α-androstanediol in various tissues such as muscle, adipose, and liver among others, and in relation to this, DHT has been reported to be a very poor anabolic agent when administered exogenously as a medication.

In addition to normal biological functions, DHT also plays an important causative role in a number of androgen-dependent conditions including hair conditions like hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth) and pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia or pattern baldness) and prostate diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. 5α-Reductase inhibitors, which prevent DHT synthesis, are effective in the prevention and treatment of these conditions. Androgen deprivation is a therapeutic approach to prostate cancer that can be implemented by castration to eliminate gonadal testosterone as a precursor to DHT, but metastatic tumors may then develop into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Although castration results in 90-95% decrease of serum testosterone, DHT in the prostate is only decreased by 50%, supporting the notion that the prostate expresses necessary enzymes (including 5α-reductase) to produce DHT without testicular testosterone, that outline the importance of 5α-reductase inhibitors.

DHT may play a function in skeletal muscle amino acid transporter recruitment and function.

Metabolites of DHT have been found to act as neurosteroids with their own AR-independent biological activity. 3α-Androstanediol is a potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, while 3β-androstanediol is a potent and selective agonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) subtype ERβ. These metabolites may play important roles in the central effects of DHT and by extension testosterone, including their antidepressant, anxiolytic, rewarding/hedonic, anti-stress, and pro-cognitive effects.

===5α-Reductase 2 deficiency===
Much of the biological role of DHT has been elucidated in studies of individuals with congenital 5α-reductase type 2 deficiency, an intersex condition caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding 5α-reductase type 2, the major enzyme responsible for the production of DHT in the body. It is characterized by a defective and non-functional 5α-reductase type 2 enzyme and a partial but majority loss of DHT production in the body. In the condition, circulating testosterone levels are within or slightly above the normal male range, but DHT levels are low (around 30% of normal), and the ratio of circulating testosterone to DHT is greatly elevated (at about 3.5 to 5 times higher than normal).

Genetic males (46,XY) with 5α-reductase type 2 deficiency are born with undervirilization including pseudohermaphroditism (ambiguous genitalia), pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias, and usually undescended testes. Their external genitalia are female-like, with micropenis (a small, clitoris-like phallus), a partially unfused, labia-like scrotum, and a blind-ending, shallow vaginal pouch. Due to their lack of conspicuous male genitalia, genetic males with the condition are typically raised as girls. At the time of puberty however, they develop striking phenotypically masculine secondary sexual characteristics including partial virilization of the genitals (enlargement of the phallus into a near-functional penis and descent of the testes), voice deepening, typical male musculoskeletal development, and no menstruation, breast development, or other signs of feminization that occur during female puberty. In addition, normal libido and spontaneous erections develop, they usually show a sexual preference for females, and almost all develop a male gender identity.

Nonetheless, males with 5α-reductase type 2 deficiency exhibit signs of continued undervirilization in a number of domains. Facial hair was absent or sparse in a relatively large group of Dominican males with the condition, known as the Güevedoces. However, more facial hair has been observed in patients with the disorder from other parts of the world, although facial hair was still reduced relative to that of other men in the same communities. The divergent findings may reflect racial differences in androgen-dependent hair growth. A female pattern of androgenic hair growth, with terminal hair largely restricted to the axillae and lower pubic triangle, is observed in males with the condition. No temporal recession of the hairline or androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss or baldness) has been observed in any of the cases of 5α-reductase type 2 deficiency that have been reported, whereas this is normally seen to some degree in almost all Caucasian males in their teenage years. Individuals with 5α-reductase type 2 deficiency were initially reported to have no incidence of acne, but subsequent research indicated normal sebum secretion and acne incidence.

In genetic males with 5α-reductase type 2 deficiency, the prostate gland is rudimentary or absent, and if present, remains small, underdeveloped, and unpalpable throughout life. In addition, neither BPH nor prostate cancer have been reported in these individuals. Genetic males with the condition generally show oligozoospermia due to undescended testes, but spermatogenesis is reported to be normal in those with testes that have descended, and there are case instances of men with the condition successfully fathering children.

Unlike males, genetic females with 5α-reductase type 2 deficiency are phenotypically normal. However, similarly to genetic males with the condition, they show reduced body hair growth, including an absence of hair on the arms and legs, slightly decreased axillary hair, and moderately decreased pubic hair. On the other hand, sebum production is normal. This is in accordance with the fact that sebum secretion appears to be entirely under the control of 5α-reductase type 1.

===5α-Reductase inhibitors===
5α-Reductase inhibitors like finasteride and dutasteride inhibit 5α-reductase type 2 and/or other isoforms and are able to decrease circulating DHT levels by 65 to 98% depending on the 5α-reductase inhibitor in question. As such, similarly to the case of 5α-reductase type 2 deficiency, they provide useful insights in the elucidation of the biological functions of DHT. 5α-Reductase inhibitors were developed and are used primarily for the treatment of BPH. The drugs are able to significantly reduce the size of the prostate gland and to alleviate symptoms of the condition. Long-term treatment with 5α-reductase inhibitors is also able to significantly reduce the overall risk of prostate cancer, although a simultaneous small increase in the risk of certain high-grade tumors has been observed. In addition to prostate diseases, 5α-reductase inhibitors have subsequently been developed and introduced for the treatment of pattern hair loss in men. They are able to prevent further progression of hair loss in most men with the condition and to produce some recovery of hair in about two-thirds of men. 5α-Reductase inhibitors seem to be less effective for pattern hair loss in women on the other hand, although they do still show some effectiveness. Aside from pattern hair loss, the drugs are also useful in the treatment of hirsutism and can greatly reduce facial and body hair growth in women with the condition.

5α-Reductase inhibitors are overall well tolerated and show a low incidence of adverse effects. Sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, and reduced ejaculate volume, may occur in 3.4 to 15.8% of men treated with finasteride or dutasteride. A small increase in the risk of affective symptoms including depression, anxiety, and self-harm may be seen. However risk within the affected group can vary very strongly with some patients vividly reporting very strong persistent effects. Both the sexual dysfunction and affective symptoms may be due partially or fully to prevention of the synthesis of neurosteroids like allopregnanolone rather necessarily than due to inhibition of DHT production. A small risk of gynecomastia has been associated with 5α-reductase inhibitors (1.2–3.5%). Based on reports of 5α-reductase type 2 deficiency in males and the effectiveness of 5α-reductase inhibitors for hirsutism in women, reduced body and/or facial hair growth is a likely potential side effect of these drugs in men. There are far fewer studies evaluating the side effects of 5α-reductase inhibitors in women. However, due to the known role of DHT in male sexual differentiation, 5α-reductase inhibitors may cause birth defects such as ambiguous genitalia in the male fetuses of pregnant women. As such, they are not used in women during pregnancy.

MK-386 is a selective 5α-reductase type 1 inhibitor which was never marketed. Whereas 5α-reductase type 2 inhibitors achieve much higher reductions in circulating DHT production, MK-386 decreases circulating DHT levels by 20 to 30%. Conversely, it was found to decrease sebum DHT levels by 55% in men versus a modest reduction of only 15% for finasteride. However, MK-386 failed to show significant effectiveness in a subsequent clinical study for the treatment of acne.

==Biological activity==
DHT is a potent agonist of the AR, and is in fact the most potent known endogenous ligand of the receptor. It has an affinity (Kd) of 0.25 to 0.5 nM for the human AR, which is about 2- to 3-fold higher than that of testosterone (Kd = 0.4 to 1.0 nM) and 15–30 times higher than that of adrenal androgens. In addition, the dissociation rate of DHT from the AR is 5-fold slower than that of testosterone. The EC50 of DHT for activation of the AR is 0.13 nM, which is about 5-fold stronger than that of testosterone (EC50 = 0.66 nM). In bioassays, DHT has been found to be 2.5- to 10-fold more potent than testosterone.

The elimination half-life of DHT in the body (53 minutes) is longer than that of testosterone (34 minutes), and this may account for some of the difference in their potency. A study of transdermal (patches) DHT and testosterone treatment reported terminal half-lives of 2.83 hours and 1.29 hours, respectively.

Unlike other androgens such as testosterone, DHT cannot be converted by the enzyme aromatase into an estrogen like estradiol. Therefore, it is frequently used in research settings to distinguish between the effects of testosterone caused by binding to the AR and those caused by testosterone&#x27;s conversion to estradiol and subsequent binding to and activation of ERs. Although DHT cannot be aromatized, it is still transformed into metabolites with significant ER affinity and activity. These are 3α-androstanediol and 3β-androstanediol, which are predominant agonists of the ERβ.

==Biochemistry==
===Biosynthesis===
DHT is synthesized irreversibly from testosterone by the enzyme 5α-reductase. This occurs in various tissues including the genitals (penis, scrotum, clitoris, labia majora), prostate gland, skin, hair follicles, liver, and brain. Around 5 to 7% of testosterone undergoes 5α-reduction into DHT, and approximately 200 to 300 μg of DHT is synthesized in the body per day. Most DHT is produced in peripheral tissues like the skin and liver, whereas most &quot;circulating&quot; DHT originates specifically from the liver. The testes and prostate gland contribute relatively little to concentrations of DHT in circulation.

There are two major isoforms of 5α-reductase, SRD5A1 (type 1) and SRD5A2 (type 2), with the latter being the most biologically important isoenzyme. There is also third 5α-reductase: SRD5A3. SRD5A2 is most highly expressed in the genitals, prostate gland, epididymides, seminal vesicles, genital skin, facial and chest hair follicles, and liver, while lower expression is observed in certain brain areas, non-genital skin/hair follicles, testes, and kidneys. SRD5A1 is most highly expressed in non-genital skin/hair follicles, the liver, and certain brain areas, while lower levels are present in the prostate, epididymides, seminal vesicles, genital skin, testes, adrenal glands, and kidneys. In the skin, 5α-reductase is expressed in sebaceous glands, sweat glands, epidermal cells, and hair follicles. Both isoenzymes are expressed in scalp hair follicles, although SRD5A2 predominates in these cells. The SRD5A2 subtype is the almost exclusive isoform expressed in the prostate gland.

====Backdoor pathway====
DHT under certain normal and pathological conditions can additionally be produced via a route that does not involve testosterone as an intermediate but instead goes through other intermediates. This route is called the &quot;backdoor pathway&quot;.

The pathway can start from 17α-hydroxyprogesterone or from progesterone and can be outlined as follows (depending on the initial substrate):
* 17α-hydroxyprogesterone → 5α-pregnan-17α-ol-3,20-dione → 5α-pregnane-3α,17α-diol-20-one → androsterone → 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol → DHT.
* progesterone → 5α-dihydroprogesterone → allopregnanolone → 5α-pregnane-3α,17α-diol-20-one → androsterone → 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol → DHT.

This pathway is not always considered in the clinical evaluation of patients with hyperandrogenism, for instance due to rare disorders of sex development like 21α-hydroxylase deficiency. Ignoring this pathway in such instances may lead to diagnostic pitfalls and confusion, when the conventional androgen biosynthetic pathway cannot fully explain the observed consequences.

As with the conventional pathway of DHT synthesis, the backdoor pathway similarly requires 5α-reductase. Whereas 5α-reduction is the last transformation in the classical androgen pathway, it is the first step in the backdoor pathway.

===Distribution===
The plasma protein binding of DHT is more than 99%. In men, approximately 0.88% of DHT is unbound and hence free, while in premenopausal women, about 0.47–0.48% is unbound. In men, DHT is bound 49.7% to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), 39.2% to albumin, and 0.22% to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), while in premenopausal women, DHT is bound 78.1–78.4% to SHBG, 21.0–21.3% to albumin, and 0.12% to CBG. In late pregnancy, only 0.07% of DHT is unbound in women; 97.8% is bound to SHBG while 2.15% is bound to albumin and 0.04% is bound to CBG. DHT has higher affinity for SHBG than does testosterone, estradiol, or any other steroid hormone.

===Metabolism===

DHT is inactivated in the liver and extrahepatic tissues like the skin into 3α-androstanediol and 3β-androstanediol by the enzymes 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, respectively. These metabolites are in turn converted, respectively, into androsterone and epiandrosterone, then conjugated (via glucuronidation and/or sulfation), released into circulation, and excreted in urine.

Unlike testosterone, DHT cannot be aromatized into an estrogen like estradiol, and for this reason, has no propensity for estrogenic effects.

===Excretion===
DHT is excreted in the urine as metabolites, such as conjugates of 3α-androstanediol and androsterone.

===Levels===
Ranges for circulating total DHT levels tested with HPLC–MS/MS and reported by LabCorp are as follows:
* Men: 30–85ng/dL
* Women: 4–22ng/dL
* Prepubertal children: &lt;3ng/dL
* Pubertal boys: 3–65ng/dL (mean at Tanner stage 5: 43ng/dL)
* Pubertal girls: 3–19ng/dL (mean at Tanner stage 5: 9ng/dL)

Ranges for circulating free DHT levels tested with HPLC–MS/MS and equilibrium dialysis and reported by LabCorp are as follows:
* &lt;18 years of age: not established
* Adult males: 2.30–11.60pg/mL (0.54–2.58% free)
* Adult females: 0.09–1.02pg/mL (&lt;1.27% free)

Other studies and labs assessing circulating total DHT levels with LC–MS/MS have reported ranges of 11–95ng/dL (0.38–3.27nmol/L) in adult men, 14–77ng/dL (0.47–2.65nmol/L) for healthy adult men (age 18–59years), 23–102 ng/dL (0.8–3.5 nmol/L) for community-dwelling adult men (age &lt;65years), and 14–92ng/dL (0.49–3.2nmol/L) for healthy older men (age 71–87years). In the case of women, mean circulating DHT levels have been found to be about 9ng/dL (0.3nmol/L) in premenopausal women and 3ng/dL (0.1nmol/L) in postmenopausal women. There was no variation in DHT levels across the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women, which is in contrast to testosterone (which shows a peak at mid-cycle). With immunoassay-based techniques, testosterone levels in premenopausal women have been found to be about 40ng/dL (1.4nmol/L) and DHT levels about 10ng/dL (0.34nmol/L). With radioimmunoassays, the ranges for testosterone and DHT levels in women have been found to be 20 to 70ng/dL and 5 to 30ng/dL, respectively.

Levels of total testosterone, free testosterone, and free DHT, but not total DHT, all measured with LC–MS/MS, are higher in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) than in women without this condition.

Circulating DHT levels in eugonadal men are about 7- to 10-fold lower than those of testosterone, and plasma levels of testosterone and DHT are highly correlated (correlation coefficient of 0.7). In contrast to the circulation however, levels of DHT in the prostate gland are approximately 5- to 10-fold higher than those of testosterone. This is due to a more than 90% conversion of testosterone into DHT in the prostate via locally expressed 5α-reductase. Because of this, and because DHT is much more potent as an androgen receptor agonist than testosterone, DHT is the major androgen in the prostate gland.

==Medical use==
DHT is available in pharmaceutical formulations for medical use as an androgen or anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). It is used mainly in the treatment of male hypogonadism. When used as a medication, dihydrotestosterone is referred to as &quot;androstanolone&quot; () or as &quot;stanolone&quot; (), and is sold under brand names such as &quot;Andractim&quot; among others. The availability of pharmaceutical DHT is limited; it is not available in the United States or Canada, but is available in certain European countries. The available formulations of DHT include buccal or sublingual tablets, topical gels, and, as esters in oil, injectables like androstanolone propionate and androstanolone valerate.

==Performance enhancement==
DHT has been used as a performance enhancing drug, specifically as an alternative to testosterone, as it was once known to be capable of falsifying drug tests.

==Chemistry==
DHT, also known as 5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one, is a naturally occurring androstane steroid with a ketone group at the C3 position and a hydroxyl group at the C17β position. It is the derivative of testosterone in which the double bond between the C4 and C5 positions has been reduced or hydrogenated.

==History==
DHT was first synthesized by Adolf Butenandt and his colleagues in 1935. It was prepared via hydrogenation of testosterone, which had been discovered earlier that year. DHT was introduced for medical use as an AAS in 1953, and was noted to be more potent than testosterone but with reduced androgenicity. It was not elucidated to be an endogenous substance until 1956, when it was shown to be formed from testosterone in rat liver homogenates. In addition, the biological importance of DHT was not realized until the early 1960s, when it was found to be produced by 5α-reductase from circulating testosterone in target tissues like the prostate gland and seminal vesicles and was found to be more potent than testosterone in bioassays. The biological functions of DHT in humans became much more clearly defined upon the discovery and characterization of 5α-reductase type 2 deficiency in 1974. DHT was the last major sex hormone, the others being testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone, to be discovered, and is unique in that it is the only major sex hormone that functions principally as an intracrine and paracrine hormone rather than as an endocrine hormone.

DHT was one of the original &quot;underground&quot; methods used to falsify drug testing in sport, as DHT does not alter the ratio of testosterone to epistestosterone in an athlete&#x27;s urinary steroid profile, a measurement that was once the basis of drug tests used to detect steroid use. However, DHT use can still be detected by other means which are now universal in athletic drug tests, such as metabolite analysis.

In 2004, Richard Auchus, in a review published in Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism coined the term &quot;backdoor pathway&quot; as a metabolic route to DHT that: 1) bypasses conventional intermediates androstenedione and testosterone; 2) involves 5α-reduction of 21-carbon (C21) pregnanes to 19-carbon (C19) androstanes; and 3) involves the 3α-oxidation of 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol to DHT. This newly discovered pathway explained how DHT is produced under certain normal and pathological conditions in humans when the classical androgen pathway (via testosterone) cannot fully explain the observed consequences. This review was based on earlier works (published in 2000–2004) by Shaw et al., Wilson et al., and Mahendroo et al., who studied DHT biosynthesis in tammar wallaby pouch young and mice.

In 2011, Chang et al. demonstrated that yet another metabolic pathway to DHT was dominant and possibly essential in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This pathway can be outlined as androstenedione → 5α-androstane-3,17-dione → DHT. While this pathway was described as the &quot;5α-dione pathway&quot; in a 2012 review, the existence of such a pathway in the prostate was hypothesized in a 2008 review by Luu-The et al.

<text>The Communications Workers of America (CWA) is the largest communications and media labor union in the United States, representing about 700,000 members in both the private and public sectors (also in Canada and Puerto Rico). The union has 27 locals in Canada via CWA-SCA Canada () representing about 8,000 members. CWA has several affiliated subsidiary labor unions bringing total membership to over 700,000. CWA is headquartered in Washington, DC, and affiliated with the AFL–CIO, the Strategic Organizing Center, the Canadian Labour Congress, and UNI Global Union.

==History==
In 1918 telephone operators organized under the Telephone Operators Department of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. While initially successful at organizing, the union was damaged by a 1923 strike and subsequent AT&amp;T lockout. After AT&amp;T installed company-controlled Employees&#x27; Committees, the Telephone Operators Department eventually disbanded. The CWA&#x27;s roots lie in the 1938 reorganization of telephone workers into the National Federation of Telephone Workers after the Wagner Act outlawed such employees&#x27; committees or &quot;company unions&quot;. NFTW was a federation of sovereign local independent unions that lacked authority over the affiliated local unions leaving it at a serious organizational disadvantage. After losing a strike with AT&amp;T in 1947, the federation led by Joseph A. Beirne, reorganized as CWA, a truly national union, which affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1949. The union&#x27;s Canadian members split away in 1972, forming the Communication Workers of Canada.

CWA has continued to expand into areas beyond traditional telephone service. In 1994 the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians merged with the CWA and became The Broadcasting and Cable Television Workers Sector of the CWA, NABET-CWA. Since 1997, it includes The Newspaper Guild (now renamed The NewsGuild-CWA). In 2004, the Association of Flight Attendants merged with CWA, and became formally known as the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, or AFA-CWA. In 2020 CWA launched the Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE-CWA) initiative to unionize tech, video game, and digital workers which has led to CWA becoming a major union for US and Canada tech worker organizing, including organizing all non-management workers at the Hawaii digital wireless carrier Mobi in 2022.

==Composition==
===Membership===

According to CWA&#x27;s Department of Labor records since 2006, when membership classifications were first reported, the total reported membership has varied greatly and unpredictably due to the addition and removal of reported membership categories. As of 2014, around 27%, or a fourth, of the union&#x27;s total membership are classified as &quot;non-dues-paying retirees&quot;, and not eligible to vote in the union. The other, voting eligible, classifications are &quot;active&quot; (65%) and &quot;dues-paying retired&quot; (8%). CWA contracts also cover some non-members, known as agency fee payers, which number comparatively about 7% of the size of the union&#x27;s membership. This accounts for 166,491 &quot;non-dues-paying retirees&quot; and 52,240 &quot;dues-paying retirees&quot;, plus about 43,353 non-members paying agency fees, compared to 404,289 &quot;active&quot; members.

<text>Pierre-Gilles-Antoine-Honoré Flaugergues, usually known as Honoré Flaugergues (16 May 1755 in Viviers, Ardèche – 26 November 1835 or 20 November 1830) was a French astronomer.

==Biography==

Flaugergues was born in Viviers, the son of magistrate Antoine-Dominique Flaugergues, whose family originated from Rouergue. His mother was Jean-Marie-Louise de Ratte, of a family of Montpellier gentry and the sister of mathematician and astronomer Étienne-Hyacinthe de Ratte. He first gained an interest in astronomy at the age of eight through reading Alain Manesson Mallet&#x27;s &quot;Description de l&#x27;Univers&quot;. Under his father&#x27;s guidance he showed early promise as a scientist,
though he was never to study formally or attend university.

Although he published papers on a wide variety of subjects, it is as an amateur astronomer that he is best known. He was a longstanding friend and correspondent of Franz Xaver, Baron von Zach and Jerome Lalande. Though he was offered the post of director of the Toulon observatory in 1797, he refused it, preferring to stay in Viviers where he had become a Justice of the Peace and where he had a private observatory. In 1810 he was offered the directorship of Marseille observatory: he again refused.

Politically, Flaugergues was a supporter of the French Revolution, holding a number of local administrative posts in the 1790s in addition to serving as a magistrate. He was a member of the &quot;Institut de France&quot; and both the Royal Society and the Prussian Academy of Sciences.

His work eventually came to the notice of the government, who awarded him the &quot;Legion d&#x27;honneur&quot; and tried to induce him to come to Paris, but he again refused to leave the Ardeche, saying that Paris would &quot;never give [him] the beautiful sky of Viviers&quot;.

==Scientific work==

He discovered the &quot;Great Comet of 1811&quot; (C/1811 F1), and independently co-discovered the &quot;Great Comet of 1807&quot; (C/1807 R1).

In attempting to measure the rotation period of Mars, he noted inconsistencies in timing of yellow-colored features and concluded he was seeing atmospheric features rather than surface features. Therefore, some credit him with the discovery of dust clouds on Mars, however this is in dispute since his telescope was probably too small to accomplish this.

In addition to astronomy, he was active in medicine and archaeology, studying the maladies suffered by workers in the wool industry and organizing archaeological excavation at Alba-la-Romaine.

A crater on Mars is named after him.

<text>Charles Wright (born May 16, 1961), better known under his ring name The Godfather, is an American professional wrestler. He is best known for his tenure with the World Wrestling Federation throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, and underwent several gimmick changes; the most notable were [[The Godfather (wrestler)#Papa Shango (1992–1993)|Papa Shango]], [[The Godfather (wrestler)#Catch Wrestling Association (1994, 1995)|Kama]], [[The Godfather (wrestler)#Nation of Domination (1997–1998)|Kama Mustafa]], [[The Godfather (wrestler)#The Godfather (1998–2000)|The Godfather]] and The Goodfather.

Among other accolades, Wright is a two-time USWA Unified World Heavyweight Champion, a one-time WWF Intercontinental Champion, and a one-time WWF World Tag Team Champion (with Bull Buchanan). He headlined &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXI&quot; against Bret Hart for the WWF Championship. Wright was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 2, 2016, under the Godfather gimmick.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1989–1991) ===
Wright first entered professional wrestling after being noticed tending to a bar by wrestlers during the filming of the movie &quot;Over the Top&quot;. The wrestlers involved gave him the advice that, with his large body type and unique (tattooed) look, he should try seeking out Larry Sharpe and his Monster Factory to get into the business. Eventually Wright parlayed his training into a job with Jerry Lawler in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) with the gimmick the wrestlers from the bar had given him and took the name &quot;The Soultaker&quot;, taken from one of the tattoos on his arm. Even with his admitted limited skill set, he was given the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship on October 23, 1989, and held it for about two weeks.

In February and March 1990, Wright wrestled for the South Carolina-based promotion South Atlantic Pro Wrestling as &quot;Baron Samedi&quot;.

Throughout 1990, Wright made appearances in Japan with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) as &quot;The Soultaker&quot;. During his appearances with NJPW, he often teamed with Crusher Bam Bam Bigelow. His opponents during his time in NJPW included Masahiro Chono, Masa Saito, and Riki Choshu.

In November 1990, Wright wrestled for the Catch Wrestling Association in Germany as &quot;Rocky Las Vegas&quot;. In August 1991, he appeared with the Dallas, Texas-based Global Wrestling Federation as &quot;The Soultaker&quot;.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1991–1993) ===

==== Sir Charles (1991) ====
In 1991, Wright was brought in to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) at the suggestion of his friend The Undertaker. He made his first appearance on May 28, 1991, at a &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot; taping in Tucson, Arizona. Wright competed there and briefly at house shows as &quot;Sir Charles&quot;, a play on both his real name and the nickname of National Basketball Association player Charles Barkley. The character was hardly used and never developed, and even when talking about it later Wright only remembers wearing robes he purchased from another wrestler to the ring. He made a dark match appearance for the pay-per-view This Tuesday in Texas defeating Dale Wolfe. 

==== Papa Shango (1992–1993) ====
In January 1992, he was repackaged as a heel by the name of &quot;Papa Shango&quot;, a horror-themed voodoo practitioner with an appearance reminiscent of the loa, Baron Samedi, as depicted in the 1973 film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. Full of rituals and an occult, culturally presence, the supernatural character carried a skull to the ring billowing smoke and could control arena lights ( arena lighting control heavily associated with The Undertaker gimmick, according to Wright had its origins with the Papa Shango gimmick), allowing for strange goings-on in the ring, and later could &quot;cast spells&quot; to cause opponents pain and to make them vomit from afar.

The Shango character debuted on the February 8, 1992, edition of &quot;Superstars&quot;, defeating enhancement talent Dale Wolfe. Shango was then thrust into the spotlight almost immediately, running in on the Hulk Hogan vs. Sid Justice main event at WrestleMania VIII. Shango actually missed his cue to run in, hitting the ring late. The finish was supposed to be Sid getting disqualified because of Shango breaking up the pinfall attempt by Hogan after he hit the big leg drop. Because Shango was late, Sid kicked out of the legdrop to save the angle. Sid&#x27;s manager, Harvey Wippleman then jumped on the apron, and the referee signaled for the disqualification at that point as Shango was just getting to the ring. The Ultimate Warrior then returned to the WWF by running to the ring and helping Hogan against Sid and Shango.

After WrestleMania, Sid and the Warrior were scheduled to begin a feud. Sid had previously failed a drug test and was let go by the WWF. The feud was then re-written with Shango instead of Sid, where he would cast voodoo spells on his opponent. The angle went nowhere, as Warrior challenged Randy Savage for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, with the rivalry never culminating. Meanwhile, Shango defeated Tito Santana in a dark match at the event. When Shango was finally set to have a match with Warrior in November 1992, Warrior was released from WWF. Shango received a WWF World Heavyweight Championship shot against Bret Hart on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXI&quot;, but was unsuccessful. Wright&#x27;s final PPV appearance as the Papa Shango character was at the 1993 Royal Rumble (where he was eliminated in under 30 seconds). He would appear in another pay-per-view dark match against Tito Santana at WrestleMania IX, with Santana getting the victory. Shango was seen infrequently on WWF television afterwards, and following a loss to Jim Duggan in a 1993 King of the Ring qualifying match, he made two final televised appearances against enhancement talent in June and July 1993.

Wright&#x27;s Papa Shango character was pilloried by fans, being voted the Worst Gimmick and the Most Embarrassing Wrestler in the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; awards for 1992. Fin Martin of professional wrestling magazine &quot;Power Slam&quot;, in a 2013 article, wrote: &quot;Shango and his curses were a total embarrassment. Fans exhaled loudly each time he appeared on screen. Shango bombed, and deservedly so.&quot; Bret Hart liked the character and Wright&#x27;s in-ring work, but found Shango&#x27;s storyline with the Ultimate Warrior – in which a voodoo curse was placed on the latter – to be perhaps the second-worst creative concept in WWF history (after the introduction of The Gobbledy Gooker). Hart reported that WWF executive Pat Patterson did not like the gimmick and was responsible for its termination.

At the same time as he was wrestling as Papa Shango in the WWF, the WWF had a working agreement with USWA. As part of the agreement, Papa Shango was sent to wrestle in USWA, where he won the Unified World Heavyweight Championship for a second time. Winning the title actually upset him, as he felt it was only done to sell to the predominantly black crowd, and after complaining to management he dropped the belt to Owen Hart. He left the company soon after and returned to bartending.

During the autumn of 1994, there were rumors that the Papa Shango character would be brought back to participate in a storyline involving Bob Backlund, wherein Shango&#x27;s voodoo spells would explain the traditionally good-natured Backlund&#x27;s erratic and villainous behavior. This didn&#x27;t come to fruition.

=== Catch Wrestling Association (1993-1994, 1995) ===
Wright as Shango defeated Ulf Herman for Otto Wanz&#x27; Catch Wrestling Association in Germany in December 1993. As Papa Shango, he wrestled a summer tour in 1994. In July, he had a shot at the CWA World Heavyweight Championship against Rambo, but lost. 

A year later on December 16, 1995, he returned as Kama and defeated Viktor Kruuger.

=== Return to World Wrestling Federation (1995–1996) ===
==== Million Dollar Corporation (1995–1996) ====
Wright returned to the WWF in January 1995 under the antagonistic heel gimmick of Kama (nicknamed &quot;The Supreme Fighting Machine&quot;), a scrappy and competitive shoot wrestler inspired by Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter Kimo Leopoldo. Shortly after his debut, he joined Ted DiBiase&#x27;s Million Dollar Corporation stable. He became an immediate part of the stable&#x27;s feud with The Undertaker, stealing the Undertaker&#x27;s signature urn at April&#x27;s WrestleMania XI then having it melted down and formed into bling, but remained in possession of the bling urn remnants until November 1995 when King Mabel seized it amid a feud with The Undertaker. He was taken off of television in the fall of 1995, and after an appearance in the 1996 Royal Rumble match, Wright left the company again.

=== National Wrestling Conference (1996) ===
Kama made a few appearances for National Wrestling Conference in Las Vegas where he feuded with Sabu. 

=== Proposed WCW Run (1996) ===
Shortly after his departure, Wright had verbally agreed to join World Championship Wrestling to serve as the enforcer for the New World Order (nWo), but chose not to go to WCW after speaking to Ron Simmons. Wright then learned that WCW signed Virgil to be the nWo&#x27;s enforcer by watching &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; at home with his wife, and that they had signed him for less than what they offered Wright.

=== Second Return to World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1997–2002) ===
==== Nation of Domination (1997–1998) ====

Wright was asked to return in 1997, with the original plans being for him to revive the Papa Shango character. Instead he returned as Kama, now billed under his full name, &quot;Kama Mustafa&quot;, joining Faarooq&#x27;s faction the Nation of Domination. On the June 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Mustafa and Faarooq defeated Ahmed Johnson and The Undertaker. Mustafa became increasingly known as &quot;The Godfather&quot; of the Nation, a moniker which was the brainchild of Wright&#x27;s wife and would become his official ring name in mid-1998. He stood with the Nation when Rocky Maivia became the leader shortly after Wrestlemania XIV, standing with Maivia, Mark Henry, D&#x27;Lo Brown, and later Owen Hart after he joined the stable in early May 1998.

In 1998, The Godfather (known to wrestlers as a genuine tough guy) competed in the WWF Brawl for All; which was a strictly boxing / shoot fighting competition, eventually won by Bart Gunn. On a July 27 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Wright debuted his &quot;Hos&quot;, during a tag-match, with Nation member Mark Henry against the Legion of Doom. The Nation lasted until around September 1998 and officially disbanded in October 1998 when Henry attacked the Nation&#x27;s leader The Rock.

==== The Godfather (1998–2000) ====

After The Nation split up, Wright had his most successful run with the company under the hugely popular persona of &quot;The Godfather&quot;. The Godfather character would be constantly surrounded by &quot;hos&quot; – in reality girls from local strip clubs, actresses, or up-and-coming female wrestlers (Victoria and Lita were the best-known wrestlers to play the role, while Ivory was offered the role but was discouraged from accepting by Luna Vachon). He would offer his opponents the right to use these girls for &quot;any purpose&quot; if they would forfeit the match to him. The gimmick was highly popular with audiences, and he defeated Goldust for the WWF Intercontinental Championship on the April 12, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;. He was Owen Hart&#x27;s scheduled opponent for the title at Over the Edge; Hart was fatally injured during a live stunt prior to the match&#x27;s time. The Godfather was scheduled to lose the title to Hart&#x27;s character, &quot;The Blue Blazer,&quot; that night. The Godfather would instead lose the title to Hart&#x27;s tag team partner Jeff Jarrett a week later. On the March 16, 2000, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he picked up the biggest win of his career, when he defeated the WWF Champion Triple H, due to interference from Shane McMahon and Big Show.

==== Right to Censor (2000–2001) ====

On the July 24 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, The Godfather faced Bull Buchanan, member of Steven Richards&#x27; ultra-conservative stable Right To Censor, in which he agreed to give up pimping if he lost. Buchanan defeated The Godfather, who promptly joined the stable and renounced his former ways. He began to dress in a formal white shirt and tie, and became known as &quot;The Goodfather&quot;. At SummerSlam on August 27, Right to Censor defeated Too Cool in a six-man tag team match. On the September 11 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, The Goodfather and Buchanan defeated the Acolytes. After the match, Val Venis attacked the Acolytes, joining the group in the process. At Unforgiven on September 24, Right to Censor defeated the Acolytes and the Dudley Boyz. At No Mercy on October 22, The Goodfather and Buchanan entered into an elimination tag team tables match, which was won by the Dudley Boyz. The next night on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Ivory was announced as the newest member of the group. The Goodfather and Buchanan won the WWF Tag Team Championship from the Hardy Boyz on the November 6 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;. At Survivor Series on November 19, The Goodfather and Buchanan teamed up with Edge and Christian, to face the Hardys and the Dudleys in a losing effort. At Rebellion on December 2, the duo retained the titles against the Hardys. They lost the titles to Edge and Christian at Armageddon on December 10 in a fatal-four-way tag team match also involving K-Kwik and Road Dogg and the Dudley Boyz.

The Goodfather entered the 2001 Royal Rumble match on January 21, 2001, at entry number 14, but was swiftly eliminated by The Rock. At WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1, The Goodfather, Buchanan and Venis were defeated by the APA (formerly the Acolytes) and Tazz. Also at WrestleMania, Ivory lost the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship to Chyna. On the April 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Right to Censor lost to the Brothers of Destruction on a 4-on-2 handicap match, after all other members walked out on Richards mid-match. The Goodfather would continue to team with Buchanan, until the June 17 episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, where they lost to the Dudley Boyz. The last time Wright would be seen on television was where he along with Buchanan and several WWF superstars attacked invading WCW wrestlers Chuck Palumbo and Sean O&#x27;Haire on an episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; For the remainder of the year, The Goodfather was completely absent from WWF programming.

==== Return of The Godfather; departure (2002) ====
The Godfather, under his old gimmick and with his hos, returned at the 2002 Royal Rumble competing in the Rumble match. He was eliminated by Chuck and Christian. During the next six months, Wright competed in several television matches, usually on &quot;Raw&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot;″s sister show &quot;Velocity&quot;. The Godfather wrestled his final match on the June 8 episode of &quot;Velocity&quot;, defeating Hugh Morrus. On the October 7, 2002, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; he made an appearance in a match between Jerry Lawler and his former Right To Censor teammate, Steven Richards in which the winner would get a night with the Godfather&#x27;s hos. This would be his final appearance on WWE programming for the next three years as Wright was released from the WWE in December 2002.

==== Sporadic appearances (2005–present) ====
On July 13, 2007, Wright returned to the ring for the first time in five years after his retirement, where he reunited with D&#x27;Lo Brown to defeat Jeremy and Bubba Blanchard in McMinnville, Oregon.

In 2007, Wright appeared for WWE at the Theodore Long and Kristal Marshall wedding ceremony on the edition of September 21, 2007, of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, where he tried to convince Long and Ron Simmons to go back to the old partying days they had. After they refused, Godfather left the ceremony with his Ho Train, and was accompanied by every male wrestler in attendance and commentator John Bradshaw Layfield, leaving only Mr. McMahon, Jonathan Coachman, Hornswoggle, Gerald Brisco, Pat Patterson, Michael Cole and several Divas behind. Wright reappeared on WWE television during the McMahon family portrait during &quot;Raw&quot;″s 15th Anniversary on December 10, 2007, where he let Hornswoggle join his Ho Train.

In January 2013, Wright made a short appearance with WWE as The Godfather at the 2013 Royal Rumble as entrant #17. He was eliminated immediately by Dolph Ziggler.

On the January 6, 2014 &quot;Old School&quot; edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Wright made an appearance alongside numerous other legends and Hall of Famers.

On February 22, 2016, it was announced that Wright would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2016, under his Godfather persona.

In June 2016, Wright appeared (as Papa Shango) on a season two episode of WWE &quot;Swerved&quot; on the WWE Network along with The Boogeyman, pranking people inside a shopping mall.

He appeared on January 22, 2018, at &quot;Raw&quot;″s 25th anniversary show, in a backstage segment with his former teammate Mark Henry, and his real-life wife. Later that year, Wright reprised both his Godfather and Papa Shango personas on the House Hardy Halloween special airing on the WWE Network on October 28, 2018. Wright appeared at the WWE &quot;Raw Reunion&quot; show on July 22, 2019.

On November 22, 2020, he made an appearance at Survivor Series during The Undertaker&#x27;s retirement ceremony.

On February 1, 2025, he was shown at ringside amongst other legends during the Royal Rumble.

=== Late career (2002–2020, 2024) ===

In late 2009, Wright returned to wrestling to take part in Hulk Hogan&#x27;s &quot;&quot; tour of Australia. On November 21, Wright, using the new ring name &quot;The Pimp Fatha&quot;, teamed with Nick Dinsmore to defeat Rock of Love (Billy Blade and Kadin Anthony) in a tag team match. On November 24, Big Daddy Row Row defeated Pimp Fatha and Sean Morley in a three-way match. Two days later, Pimp Fatha defeated Heidenreich. After the match, he hosted a bikini contest which was won by Lacey von Erich. Two days later, Pimp Fatha wrestled his last match on the tour and was defeated by Sean Morley.

In January 2012, Wright won a battle royal at Pro Wrestling Superstars in Los Angeles.

Wright made a rare in-ring segment along with his longtime friend Val Venis and Dexter Verity in Future Stars of Wrestling, where he promised to bring his hoes if Venis and Verity would have succeeded defending their tag team titles. In September 2013, Wright resumed wrestling on the independent circuit.

In spring of 2014 Wright made two appearances for Preston City Wrestling in England, as Papa Shango working against local star Bubblegum on both nights. In October 2014 at Elite Canadian Championship Wrestling (ECCW) Halloween Hell, Wright teamed with his old partner, Val Venis to face the team of then-ECCW Tag Team Champions Jordie Taylor and Daniel Adonis and the team of Ladies Choice and Eric Locker in a three-way elimination tag team match, but unsuccessful. Wright would step down from wrestling in March 2020 when COVID-19 hit. 

On April 26, 2024, Wright returned as Papa Shango when he defeated This Guy in Burwood East, New South Wales, Australia for Battle Championship Wrestling.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
According to Wright, the Papa Shango character uses paint because Vince McMahon said his face did not match his body. During his last WWE appearances as The Godfather, where he would usually be accompanied by a group of girls referred to as the &quot;Ho Train&quot;, Wright appeared sans girls. According to him, it was done because times had changed and the character was phased out.

== Personal life ==
Wright attended the University of Nevada, Reno where he was an offensive tackle on the football team. After leaving professional wrestling, Wright moved to Las Vegas where he managed the Cheetah&#x27;s strip club. He married his girlfriend Denise in September 2000, they have four children together. His marriage to Denise is his third marriage after two previous marriages.

<doc id="591654" wikidata="Q7271517" url="?curid=591654" title="Question Hour">
<text>Question Hour is the first hour of a sitting session of the Lok Sabha devoted to questions that Members of Parliament raise about any aspect of administrative activity. The concerned Minister is obliged to answer to the Parliament, either orally or in writing, depending on the type of question raised. Questions are one of the ways Parliament can hold the Executive accountable.It is very useful for the Government.

==Types of question==
There are four types of question—Starred, non-starred, short notice question and questions to private members.
1) Starred Questions are those for which an oral answer is expected. The member is allowed to as after the reply is obtained from the Minister concerned. Answer to such question may be followed by supplementary questions by member.

These questions are printed in green colour and are marked with asterisk sign &#x27;*&#x27;, in order to distinguish from other questions.

2) Non-starred questions are those for which a written reply is expected. After the reply has been provided, no supplementary question can be asked. A notice period is to be given to the minister to reply to a question. 

These questions are printed in white colour and not more than 230 questions can be listed for a day in the Lok Sabha.

3) Short notice questions are those which are asked on matters of urgent public importance and thus, can be asked on a shorter notice i.e. less than 10 days. These questions can be answered orally and supplementary questions can be asked.

These questions are printed in light pink colour.

4) Questions to private members are those which are asked to members who are not ministers. These questions are related to private member&#x27;s bills, parliamentary committees, private member resolutions.

These questions are printed in Yellow colour.

However, if a Member seeks to ask a question urgently and cannot wait for the duration of the notice period, then the member can do so provided it is accepted by the Speaker. Such questions are called supplementary questions.

==Recent changes==
The following procedural changes have been in force since the 5th session of the 15th Lok Sabha:
* A 15-day notice period is now to be given to the minister to respond to a question in Parliament (concept of minimum and maximum notice duration has been removed). The notice duration used to be a minimum of 10 days or maximum of 21 days.
* The Speaker now has the authority to direct answers to a starred question asked by a member in case of his or her absence on the day their name was called.
* A member is now required to make a statement in the House correcting the reply given by him or her earlier, irrespective of whether the reply given pertained to a starred or unstarred or a short notice question.
* The maximum questions, starred or unstarred, a member is now entitled to give is 10 per day.

==Question hour in other legislatures==
This sort of a process where elected representatives ask questions that are replied by the Prime Minister or other government ministers is part of parliamentary tradition in many other countries. The Question Hour in the Indian Parliament is similar to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, the First Minister&#x27;s Questions in the Scottish Parliament and Senedd Cymru/Welsh Parliament, and the Question Period in the House of Commons of Canada. 

== Notable Events ==
=== Mundhra scandal ===
India&#x27;s very first major financial scam was brought to light during the 2nd Lok Sabha when Feroze Gandhi questioned the finance ministry regarding government owned Life Insurance Corporation&#x27;s unauthorised investment into Haridas Mundhra&#x27;s companies. It eventually resulted in the resignation of the then finance Minister T. T. Krishnamachari.

=== Puducherry licence scandal ===
In 1974, during the 5th Lok Sabha, a licence scandal was unearthed during question hour. A memorandum allegedly signed by 21 MPs were submitted by traders of Puducherry to the Union Commerce Ministry to grant licenses for importing various items. The signatures were forged on the behest of Indira Gandhi&#x27;s key aide, Lalit Narain Mishra.

<doc id="591657" wikidata="Q132859" url="?curid=591657" title="Saltopus">
<text>Saltopus (&quot;hopping foot&quot;) is a genus of very small bipedal dinosauriform containing the single species Saltopus elginensis from the late Triassic period of Scotland. It is one of the most famous Elgin Reptiles.

==Description==
&quot;Saltopus elginensis&quot; is known only from a single partial skeleton lacking the skull, but including parts of the vertebral column, the forelimbs, the pelvis and the hindlimbs. These have been mainly preserved as impressions or natural casts in the sandstone; very little bone material is present. It was about the size of a domestic cat, and would have been roughly long. It had hollow bones like those of birds and other dinosaurs. It may have weighed around . In 2016, it was estimated to be 50 cm long, 15 cm high at the hips, and 110 g. Most of the length was accounted for by the tail. It had five-fingered hands, with the fourth and fifth finger reduced in size. Contrary to the original description, in 2011 it was established that the sacrum (hip vertebrae) was made up of two vertebrae, the primitive ancestral condition, not four.

==History==
The only known fossil of &quot;Saltopus&quot; was discovered in 1867 by William Taylor in the Lossiemouth West &amp; East Quarries. It was initially named as a specimen of &quot;Telerpeton elginense&quot; (now &quot;Leptopleuron lacertinum&quot;) by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1867, and it was later named and described by Friedrich von Huene in 1910 as the type species &quot;Saltopus elginensis&quot;. 

The generic name is derived from Latin &quot;saltare&quot;, &quot;to jump&quot; and Greek πούς, &quot;pous&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;. The specific name refers to its provenance near Elgin, which yields the Elgin Reptiles. The holotype NHMUK R.3915, was excavated from the Lossiemouth Sandstone Formation dating from the Carnian-Norian stage.

==Classification==
&quot;Saltopus&quot; has been variously identified as a saurischian (lizard-hipped) dinosaur, a more advanced theropod, and a close relative of the herrerasaurs, but its taxonomy has been in dispute because only fragmentary remains have been recovered. Some researchers, such as Gregory S. Paul, have suggested it may represent a juvenile specimen of a coelophysid theropod such as &quot;Coelophysis&quot; or &quot;Procompsognathus&quot;. Rauhut and Hungerbühler in 2000 concluded it is a primitive dinosauriform, not a true dinosaur, closely related to &quot;Lagosuchus&quot;. Michael Benton, continuing the studies of the late Alick Walker redescribing the fossil in 2011, found it to be a dinosauriform more derived than &quot;Lagosuchus&quot;.

A large phylogenetic analysis of early dinosaurs and dinosauromorphs by Matthew Baron, David B. Norman and Paul Barrett (2017) recovered &quot;Saltopus&quot; near the base of the dinosaur lineage, suggesting that it may represent the closest relative of true dinosaurs.

<doc id="591658" wikidata="Q246464" url="?curid=591658" title="Symphony No. 6 (Dvořák)">
<text>Antonín Dvořák composed his Symphony No. 6 in D major, Op. 60, B. 112, in 1880. It was premiered on 25 March 1881. It was originally published as Symphony No. 1 and is dedicated to Hans Richter, who was the conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. With a performance time of approximately 40 minutes, the four-movement piece was one of the first of Dvořák’s large symphonic works to draw international attention. In it, he manages to capture some of the Czech national style within a standard Germanic classical-romantic form.

== Background ==
Dvořák’s Symphony No. 6 was composed for the Vienna Philharmonic. In order to understand the context in which he composed this symphony, the climate and reception of Dvořák’s earlier works in Vienna should be taken into consideration.

In late 1879, Hans Richter conducted the Vienna Philharmonic in a subscription concert that included the &quot;Third Slavonic Rhapsody&quot;. According to Dvořák, in a letter dated 23 November 1879,

I set out last Friday and was present at the performance of my &quot;Third Rhapsody&quot;, which was liked very much, and I had to show myself to the audience. I sat next to Brahms by the organ in the orchestra, and Richter drew me out. I had to appear. I must tell you that I immediately won the sympathy of the whole orchestra and that out of all the new works they tried over, and Richter said there were sixty of them, they liked my &quot;Rhapsody&quot; best of all. Richter kissed me on the spot and told me he was very glad to know me.…
Music historians have made various conclusions regarding what this letter implies about Dvořák’s reception in Vienna. Dvořák scholar John Clapham interprets this letter to say that the audience at the concert responded with a warm ovation, and that Richter was pleased with the work. Yet, according to David Brodbeck, this account probably only describes the dress rehearsal (the Philharmonic’s dress rehearsals were open to a limited audience), arguing that there is no other way to explain the presence of Brahms and Dvořák on stage during a performance. Eduard Hanslick, a music critic in Vienna at this time, reported: “The &quot;Rhapsody&quot; was respectfully but not warmly received. I had expected it to make a livelier effect after the impression of the dress rehearsal.” Even though audience reception at the actual concert may have been less than enthusiastic, Richter saw promise in Dvořák’s work and asked him to write a symphony for the orchestra. He finished the symphony the following year, in October 1880, and traveled to Vienna to play the composition on the piano for Richter, who was very excited about the work.

Dvořák expected to have the Vienna Philharmonic premiere his symphony in December 1880. However, Richter postponed the performance repeatedly, citing family sickness and an over-worked orchestra. Dvořák, suspicious of anti-Czech feelings in Vienna, eventually grew frustrated. He learned later that members of the orchestra objected to performing works by the relatively new Czech composer in two consecutive seasons.

Instead, Adolf Čech conducted the premiere of Symphony No. 6 with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra on 25 March 1881 in Prague. The Scherzo was encored. Richter did eventually conduct the piece in London in 1882. Though he never conducted it in Vienna, he still retained an interest in Dvořák&#x27;s compositions. The Vienna Philharmonic did not perform this symphony until 1942.

Dvořák’s Symphony No. 6 was originally issued as his Symphony No. 1 by Simrock, Dvořák’s German music publisher, as it was his first published work in this genre. Further confusion in numbering Dvořák’s symphonies came from several sources. Dvořák believed that his first symphony was lost, and numbered the remaining symphonies Nos.1 to 8 by date of composition. Simrock continued to order the symphonies by publication date, ignoring the first four symphonies. Therefore, according to Dvořák, this work was his fifth symphony, according to the publisher it was his first, but chronologically (and after the first symphony was recovered) it is now known as his Symphony No. 6. The order of symphonies was first codified by Dvořák scholar Otakar Šourek.

== Compositional context and influences ==
The period of Dvořák&#x27;s life that culminated with his Symphony No. 6 in D major was a time of experimentation and development of his personal compositional style. He developed his basic compositional voice largely from a study of the Germanic classical tradition. There are differing opinions about what influences were in play as he wrote his sixth symphony; it is possible to see the No. 6 as a synthesis of many influences, or as the focus of just a few.

Gerald Abraham writes, &quot;...he had recognizable affinities with all three of the principal musical tendencies of the period, with the conservatism of Brahms and his followers, with the modernism of the Liszt-Wagner school, and with the nationalism that was in almost every country... in Europe.&quot; To be sure, he had personal contact with musical giants from each of these traditions. In 1863, Richard Wagner came to Prague and conducted a program of his own works, in which Dvořák played as a violist. He was very impressed with Wagner&#x27;s compositional style. Dvořák then applied for a stipend from Svatobor, a Prague association for the support of artists, to finance a period of study with Liszt in Weimar. He was not selected for the prize. This turn of events probably greatly affected Dvořák&#x27;s eventual shift to a personal integrative style of composition, as opposed to a complete devotion to the Wagner school. In 1874, Dvořák submitted numerous works to apply for the Austrian State Stipendium, money offered to young poor artists by the Ministry of Education. On the panel of judges that awarded Dvořák the prize was Johannes Brahms, who became a longtime friend and supporter of the young Czech. And in Prague itself was the older and more revered Czech nationalistic composer Bedřich Smetana who eventually supported Dvořák by being among the first to program and conduct concerts that included his compositions. David Beveridge states, &quot;In 1880, with the composition of his Sixth Symphony, Dvořák had at last achieved an optimum balance between his nationalistic-romantic proclivities and the demands of classical form.&quot;

Yet, it may not be quite so simple to categorically say that a mix or balance of these influences culminated in Symphony No. 6. According to David Brodbeck, Dvořák purposely utilized sources from the German tradition in order to cater to a Viennese audience and their cultural values. At that time, Viennese culture elevated German qualities, and not Czech. In keeping with this attitude, Dvořák referenced works by Brahms and Beethoven, as well as a Viennese dance. The orchestral makeup, the key, the mood and the tempo marking of the Finale are all identical to the finale of Brahms&#x27;s Second Symphony.

== Instrumentation and score ==
=== Score ===
The symphony is written in four movements:
=== Instrumentation ===

The score calls for two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, strings.

The piccolo is only used in the third movement. The trombones and tuba are only used in the first and fourth movements.

== Orchestration and style ==

Dvořák&#x27;s melodies are often presented in the woodwinds and horns, as well as the strings. Dvořák frequently converses back and forth between groups of instruments, sometimes finishing one another&#x27;s phrases. The brass are used more as support in tutti passages, only occasionally leading the melody.

===I. &quot;Allegro non tanto&quot; ===

The first movement is written in a traditional sonata form. It is in time and in the key of D major. Dvořák has included extra melodic material with two primary themes, two transitional phrases, and two secondary themes. The initial primary theme has three parts that Dvořák uses in many ways throughout the piece. The first (x) is an ascending fourth, followed by a repeated D with a dotted rhythm (y), and finally descending stepwise motion from the fifth scale degree to the second (z).

The transition begins in measure 78 with an upward stepwise motive that could be seen as filling in the interval of a fourth, which opened the initial primary theme (x), or as an inversion of the downward stepwise motive that closes the same primary theme (z). Either way, a connection can be drawn back to the initial primary theme.

The secondary area begins in measure 108. The initial secondary theme is in B minor and includes rhythmic similarities to the initial primary theme (y and z). In measure 120 the second secondary theme enters in B major. It is a lyrical theme presented in the oboe. This section begins &quot;pianissimo&quot; and gradually crescendos into the closing section in measure 161, which is also in B major.

The score includes a repeat of the exposition; however, this is not usually observed because Dvořák later decided to eliminate it. &quot;He finally wrote in the score now owned by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra: &#x27;once and for all without repetition.&#x27;&quot;

The development begins with the thematic elements of the first primary theme, using each of these fragments in turn, as well as material from the second transitional phrase. It begins very softly and gradually gathers excitement with an increase in orchestration, &quot;fugato&quot; sections, and circle-of-fifths progressions. Shortly before the recapitulation, the strings break into a homophonic &quot;fortissimo&quot; statement of rising quarter notes for eleven measures, marked &quot;pesante&quot; (measures 310–320), before the full orchestra joins in for the retransition into the recapitulation in D major.

The movement ends with a D major coda (measure 480) that reviews the previous themes over pedals emphasizing the dominant and tonic pitches. The same string &quot;pesante&quot; section that preceded the recapitulation returns in measure 512. The piece then builds to a &quot;fortissimo&quot; with a canon of the first primary theme in the trumpets and trombones that is taken up by the whole orchestra. The excitement decays to &quot;pianissimo&quot; for what appears to be a peaceful conclusion, until a unison &quot;fortissimo&quot; statement of the second secondary theme closes the movement.

=== II. &quot;Adagio&quot;===
The Adagio, in B major, is a loose rondo containing variations within the sections. The form can be described as . The Adagio is lightly scored with frequent woodwind solos. Otakar Šourek, an early 20th-century Dvořák scholar, wrote, &quot;the second movement has the quality of a softly yearning nocturne and of an ardently passionate intermezzo.&quot; The main theme, or A section, is built on the interval of an upward fourth, just as the first movement begins (x). Much of the movement is focused on this theme, which returns many times and is varied throughout. Each A section is in B major.

The B sections feature a short falling motive and also incorporate material from the introduction of the movement, measures 1–4. The first B section (measures 35–72) moves to D major and is preceded by a modulatory transition. The B section returns in measure 156.

The C section, measures 104–139, could be considered developmental. It begins in B minor but moves away fairly quickly and is tonally unstable. It uses melodic material from the introduction as well as the main theme. In measures 115–122, the first four notes of the main theme are presented at half the speed, first at the original pitches, and then a major third higher. This material is then returned to the original rhythmic values and passed back and forth between the horn and oboe.

The Adagio closes with a simplified version of the opening of the main theme, which reveals the close relationship between the introductory material and the main theme. The movement ends with &quot;pianissimo&quot; woodwinds and overlapping motives, similar to the opening of the movement.

=== III. &quot;Scherzo (Furiant): Presto&quot;===
The third movement incorporates a Czech dance, the &quot;Furiant&quot;. This is a quick dance in triple meter with hemiolas at the beginning of the phrase. The effect is that the movement appears to alternate between and . The use of a &quot;Furiant&quot; is a nationalistic feature.

The form of the third movement is a ternary scherzo and trio. It is in D minor, moving to D major in the trio (measures 154–288). The opening scherzo has two sections which are both repeated. The melody is characterized by frequent hemiolas and a half-step interval in the first section. The second section is more lyrical and is in F major. The trio is much more relaxed and retains the triple meter feel throughout, with less hemiola interruption. The piccolo is featured in this section, with a lyrical solo over pizzicato strings. The trio winds down with a long D major harmony and the scherzo is ushered in with string section hemiolas. The closing scherzo is almost identical to the opening scherzo, but without repeats.

=== IV. &quot;Finale: Allegro con spirito&quot;===
The Finale is in sonata form and follows the conventions of structure and harmonic motion. The exposition begins in D major with a primary theme that resembles the first primary theme of the first movement, including an upward interval of a fourth (x), a dotted rhythm on a repeated D (y), and stepwise motion.

The secondary theme appears in measure 70 in the dominant, A major, and comprises a descending triplet figure. The development section (measures 139–318) reverses the order of themes, first exploring the secondary theme and then the primary theme, frequently with imitation. The recapitulation is fairly straightforward. The piece concludes with a fiery coda beginning with a fugue section on the main theme and a counterpoint theme in quavers, with several homophonic passages that feature the brass and present the primary theme at half the speed. The symphony closes solidly with a tutti &quot;fortissimo&quot; statement.

== Influences ==

Dvořák&#x27;s Symphony No. 6 has many similarities to symphonies by Brahms and Beethoven, as well as references to Czech folk tunes. These links have been proposed and debated by scholars and music critics.

The most common connection claimed is with Johannes Brahms&#x27; Symphony No. 2, which was written in 1877, three years before Dvořák’s Symphony No. 6. A. Peter Brown writes, &quot;Brahms&#x27;s Symphony no. 2, in the same key, was more than an inspiration to Dvořák; it became a model for the younger composer: the first and final movements of both works have the same scoring, tempo, meter, and key...&quot; He points out similarities in the primary themes of the first and fourth movements, as well as structural and orchestration similarities. David Beveridge also compares the first and fourth movements of Dvořák&#x27;s Symphony no. 6 with Brahms&#x27; Symphony no. 2, noting that both composers relate their fourth movement primary theme back to the primary theme of the first movement, a cyclical feature.

Writing for Dvořák&#x27;s 100th anniversary, Julius Harrison agrees with these comparisons to Brahms&#x27; Symphony No. 2, while also pointing out differences in the two composers:
Brahms takes a D major triad as a kind of thesis in triplicate, from which, by means of the melodies resulting from that triad, he proceeds step by step to a logical conclusion. Dvořák takes an odd bit of sound, a mere dominant-tonic progression ... and then, to our great delight fashions it into a movement, structurally classical, yet thematically having the nature of lovely improvisation.
Robert Layton argues that Dvořák&#x27;s early sketches for the first movement were in D minor and meter, differing from Brahms&#x27; Symphony No. 2. He cites a Czech folk song, &quot;Já mám koně&quot;, as the inspiration for the primary theme of the first movement, with Dvořák later altering the mode and time signature. &quot;It is of course the test of his genius that he should have transformed this idea into the glowing and radiant theme that the definitive score can boast.&quot;

There is another possible source for this same primary theme. David Brodbeck writes, &quot;Dvořák&#x27;s main theme alludes directly to the so-called &quot;Großvater-Tanz&quot;, which traditionally served as the closing dance at Viennese balls.&quot; If this is the case, it would lend support to the idea that Dvořák wrote the symphony specifically for a Vienna audience and lessen the case for Dvořák&#x27;s nationalistic influences.

Nors Josephson proposes similarities in form, key structure, and orchestration of the first movement of Dvořák&#x27;s Symphony No.6 with Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No.3. He compares many of Dvořák&#x27;s themes with passages by Beethoven, as well as similar compositional techniques. &quot;Aside from the Czech folk-song, &quot;Já mám koně&quot;, nearly all the principal motifs of Dvořák&#x27;s sixth Symphony can be traced back to ... compositions by Beethoven and Brahms.&quot; Many of Josephson&#x27;s comparisons involve transitional material, modulatory processes, and orchestration, emphasizing that Dvořák was influenced by Beethoven&#x27;s procedures, not just his melodies. &quot;Dvořák frequently employed Beethovenian techniques as creative stimuli.&quot;

The second movement of Dvořák&#x27;s Symphony No. 6 has often been compared to the third movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 for its melodic shape, use of woodwinds, and the key structure (B major to D major).

Another Czech folksong, &quot;Sedlák, sedlák&quot;, may have been used by Dvořák in the third movement of his Symphony No. 6 to create the &quot;Furiant&quot; melody. John Clapham states that, &quot;the classic model for all true furiants is the folksong ″&quot;Sedlák, sedlák&quot;″, well known to all Czechs.&quot; Dvořák&#x27;s theme is not a literal translation of the folk song, but it does have similarities, including hemiola in the first half of the phrase and neighbor tone relationships.

These examples show that there were many inspirations for Dvořák&#x27;s Symphony No. 6. The myriad of possible references and models by Brahms, Beethoven, and Czech folksongs demonstrate Dvořák&#x27;s synthesis of his nationalistic style with the Viennese symphonic tradition.

== Critical and cultural reception ==

=== In Vienna ===
In Vienna in 1879 (a year before the intended premiere of the symphony), a political shift was happening. The newly elected Austrian parliament allowed regions to conduct education and official government business in the predominant language of each region, thus posing a seeming threat to the German language and German cultural dominance in general.

While a few years earlier Dvořák might have been judged an acculturated German, in 1879 he was increasingly considered a Czech and thus a threat to the established dominant German culture in Vienna. His previous works, such as the &quot;Moravian Duets&quot;, &quot;Slavonic Dances&quot; and &quot;Slavonic Rhapsody&quot;, were popular in many other countries in Europe at least in part for their &quot;exoticism&quot;. But the climate in Vienna was becoming quite unwelcoming of any compositions that issued from non-Germanic roots, especially those works with obvious references to other nationalities (such as the &quot;Furiant&quot; in Symphony no. 6.) &quot;...in Vienna the musical exoticism that had played so well elsewhere ran head-on into the political crisis engendered by the Liberals&#x27; recent loss of power.&quot; It is likely that this was the main reason that the established, elite Vienna Philharmonic did not premiere Dvořák&#x27;s Symphony No. 6. It was first performed in Vienna in 1883 by the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, with Wilhelm Gericke conducting.

=== In Europe ===
The piece was well liked by audiences and critics in much of Europe. “Not long after Simrock published the D major Symphony, performances were taking place in half a dozen different countries, and generally the new work was so well received as to contribute greatly towards establishing Dvořák as one of the foremost composers of his generation.”

English music critic Ebenezer Prout described the symphony in his 1882 review as “(a) work that, notwithstanding some imperfections, must be considered one of the most important of its kind produced for some time. Its performance was characterized by immense spirit, and the audience was unreserved in its token of appreciation.” Dvořák’s Symphony no. 6 was especially popular in England. Dvořák traveled to London in 1884 to conduct a program including his Symphony No. 6 with the Royal Philharmonic Society. His trip was a success and the Royal Philharmonic Society made Dvořák an honorary member a few months later, also commissioning another symphony from him. Joseph Bennett, writing a review of Dvořák’s works for a London musical publication in 1884, had this to say of him: “Dvořák’s success in England affords matter for much congratulation. We have from him that which is new and not mischievous…that which is founded…upon the natural expression of a people’s musical nature. The more of Dvořák the better, therefore, and the indications are that a good deal of him awaits us.&quot;

=== At home ===
The success Dvořák experienced abroad was recognized in his homeland. In 1878 he led a concert consisting entirely of his own works in Prague, which was very well received. While Dvořák was occasionally criticized for not being nationalistic enough by his own countrymen, in April, 1881, a critic for Dalibor, a Czech paper, wrote: “This new Dvořák symphony simply excels over all others of the same type within contemporary musical literature….In truth, the work (Symphony no. 6) has an imminently Czech nature, just as Dvořák continues along the basis of his great and fluent power, the tree of which is decorated by the ever more beautiful fruits of his creation.”

<text>Svipdagr (Old Norse: &quot;sudden day&quot;) is the hero of the two Old Norse Eddaic poems Grógaldr and Fjölsvinnsmál, which are contained within the body of one work; Svipdagsmál. 

==Plot==
Svipdagr is set a task by his stepmother, to meet the goddess Menglöð, who is his &quot;fated bride.&quot; In order to accomplish this seemingly impossible task, he summons by necromancy the shade of his dead mother, Gróa, a völva who also appears in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, to cast nine spells for him. This she does and the first poem abruptly ends.

At the beginning of the second poem, Svipdagr arrives at Menglöð&#x27;s castle, where he is interrogated in a game of riddles by the watchman, from whom he conceals his true name (identifying himself as Vindkald(r) &quot;Wind-Cold&quot; apparently hoping to pass himself off as a frost giant). The watchman is named Fjölsviðr, a name of Odin in Grímnismál 47. He is accompanied by his wolf-hounds Geri and Gifr. After a series of eighteen questions and answers concerning the castle, its inhabitants, and its environment, Svipdagr ultimately learns that the gates will only open to one person: Svipdagr. On his revealing his identity, the gates of the castle open and Menglöð rises to greet her expected lover, welcoming him &quot;back&quot; to her.

==In other material==
A champion by the same name, perhaps the same character, appears in the Prologue to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and in &quot;Gesta Danorum.&quot; A hero named Svipdag is one of the companions of King Hrolfr Kraki.

There is also a &quot;Swæbdæg&quot; in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; among the forefathers of Aella, King of Deira.

==Interpretation==
Since the 19th century, following Jacob Grimm, Menglöð has been identified with the goddess Freyja in most scholarship. In his children&#x27;s book &quot;Our Fathers&#x27; Godsaga&quot;, the Swedish scholar Viktor Rydberg identifies Svipdagr with Freyja&#x27;s husband Óðr/Óttar. His reasons for doing so are outlined in the first volume of his &quot;Undersökningar i germanisk mythologi&quot; (1882). Other scholars who have commented on these poems in detail include Hjalmar Falk (1893), B. Sijmons and Hugo Gering (1903), Olive Bray (1908), Henry Bellows (1923), Otto Höfler (1952), Lee M. Hollander (1962), Lotte Motz (1975), Einar Ólafur Sveinsson (1975), Carolyne Larrington (1999), and John McKinnell (2005).

<text>Saltasaurus (which means &quot;lizard from Salta&quot;) is a genus of saltasaurid dinosaur of the Late Cretaceous period of Argentina. Small among sauropods, though still heavy by the standards of modern creatures, &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; was characterized by a short neck and stubby limbs. It was the first genus of sauropod known to possess armour of bony plates embedded in its skin. Such small bony plates, called osteoderms, have since been found on other titanosaurians.

==Discovery==

The fossils of &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; were excavated by José Bonaparte, Martín Vince and Juan C. Leal between 1975 and 1977 at the Estancia &quot;El Brete&quot;. The find was in 1977 reported in the scientific literature.

&quot;Saltasaurus&quot; was named and described by Bonaparte and Jaime E. Powell in 1980. The type species is &quot;Saltasaurus loricatus&quot;. Its generic name is derived from Salta Province, the region of north-west Argentina where the first fossils were recovered. The specific name means &quot;protected by small armoured plates&quot; in Latin.

The holotype, PVL 4017-92, was found in a layer of the Lecho Formation dating from the early Maastrichtian stage of the Upper Cretaceous period, about seventy million years old. It consists of a sacrum connected to two ilia. Under the inventory number PVL 4017 over two hundred additional fossils have been catalogued. These include rear skull elements, teeth, vertebrae of the neck, back, hip and tail, parts of the shoulder girdle and the pelvis, and limb bones — plus various pieces of armour. These bones represent a minimum of five individuals, two adults and three juveniles or subadults.

Currently the only recognised species of &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; is &quot;S. loricatus&quot;. A &quot;S. robustus&quot; and a &quot;S. australis&quot; have been suggested but these are now considered to belong to a separate genus, &quot;Neuquensaurus&quot;. Earlier, armour plates from the area had been named as &quot;Loricosaurus&quot; by Friedrich von Huene who assumed them to be from an armoured ankylosaurian. It has been suggested these plates were in fact from &quot;Saltasaurus&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Saltasaurus&quot; is very small compared to most other members of the Sauropoda. Powell estimated the adult length at six metres. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated the maximum length at and the weight at 2.5 tonnes (2.8 short tons). Donald Henderson estimated a larger size of long.

The teeth of &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; were cylindrical, with spatulate points. &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; had a relatively short neck with shortened neck vertebrae. The vertebrae from the middle part of its tail had elongated centra. &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; had vertebral lateral fossae, pleurocoels, that resembled shallow depressions. Fossae that similarly resemble shallow depressions are known from &quot;Malawisaurus&quot;, &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;, &quot;Aeolosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Gondwanatitan&quot;. &quot;Venenosaurus&quot; also had depression-like fossae, but its pleurocoels penetrated deeper into the vertebrae, were divided into two chambers, and extend farther into the vertebral columns. In &quot;Saltasaurus&quot;, the vertebral bone was generally cancellous and there were larger air chambers present as well. The limbs were short and stubby with especially short hands and feet. &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; had more robust radii than &quot;Venenosaurus&quot;. The belly was extremely wide.

The osteoderms came in two types. There were larger oval plates with a length of up to twelve centimetres. These were keeled or spiked and perhaps were ordered in longitudinal rows along the back. The second type consists of small ossicles, rounded or pentagonal, about seven millimetres in diameter, that formed a continuous armour between the plates. A study in 2010 concluded that the larger plates had cancellous bone but that the ossicles had a denser bone tissue.

==Phylogeny==
&quot;Saltasaurus&quot; in a cladogram after Navarro &quot;et al&quot;., 2022:

==Palaeobiology==

Like all sauropods, &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; was herbivorous. Because of its barrel-like rump, shaped like a hippopotamus, Powell suggested that &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; was aquatic. Despite its small stature, &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; was still graviportal like other sauropods, meaning it could not run because its hindlimbs had to be held straight at the load-bearing phase of their walking cycle. Powell assumed adult individuals were protected against predators by their body armour, while juveniles were protected by the herd as a whole.

In the Cretaceous Period, sauropods in North America were no longer the dominant group of herbivorous dinosaurs with the exception of &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;, with the ornithopod and ceratopsian dinosaurs, such as &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Triceratops&quot;, becoming the most abundant (this being most evident by the Late Cretaceous epoch). However, on other landmasses such as South America and Africa (which were island continents much like modern Australia) sauropods, in particular the titanosaurs, continued to be the dominant herbivores.

&quot;Saltasaurus&quot; was one such titanosaur sauropod, and lived around 70 million years ago. When it was first discovered, in 1975, it forced palaeontologists to reconsider some assumptions about sauropods as &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; possessed crocodile-like armour (osteoderms) 10 to 12 centimetres (4 to 5 in) in diameter. Previously, it had been assumed that size alone was sufficient defence for the massive sauropods. Since then, palaeontologists have investigated the possibility that other sauropods may also have had armour; for example, &quot;Laplatasaurus&quot;.

A new discovery, from another formation, may shed light on the nesting habits of &quot;Saltasaurus&quot;. A large titanosaurid nesting ground was discovered in Auca Mahuevo, in Patagonia, Argentina (another titanosaur nesting site has reportedly been discovered in Spain). Several hundred female saltasaurines dug holes with their back feet, laid eggs in clutches averaging around 25 eggs each, and buried the nests under dirt and vegetation. The small eggs, about 11–12 cm (4–5 in) in diameter, contained fossilised embryos, complete with skin impressions showing a mosaic armour of small bead-like scales. The armour pattern resembled that of &quot;Saltasaurus&quot;.

<text>The USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship was a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship formed in 1988, which consisted of the WCWA World Heavyweight Championship from World Class Championship Wrestling and the AWA World Heavyweight Championship from the American Wrestling Association. The title was unified on December 13, 1988, when AWA World Champion Jerry Lawler defeated WCWA World Champion Kerry Von Erich in a unification match.

The title was primarily recognized by and defended in the United States Wrestling Association until 1997, when the company ceased operations. However, the AWA withdrew its recognition of the championship shortly after the unification match when Lawler was stripped of the AWA world title. The title was also contested in a non-televised match prior to the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s King of the Ring event in 1993.

<doc id="591665" wikidata="Q5583285" url="?curid=591665" title="Goodbye Horses">
<text>&quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; is a song recorded by American singer Q Lazzarus. It was written by Q Lazzarus&#x27;s bandmate, William Garvey, and released in 1988, with an extended version released three years later. It is a synth-pop, dark wave, and new wave song with lyrics based on &quot;transcendence over those who see the world as only earthly and finite&quot; and androgynous vocals from Q Lazzarus.

After Q Lazzarus played a demo tape for Jonathan Demme while driving him in her taxi, which included a demo of &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot;, he featured the song in his crime comedy film &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; (1988). It then became a cult hit after he used it in a scene of his film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991), which was widely lauded for the usage. Since then, it has been used in various films, television series, and video games, often with references to its use in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, and has been covered by numerous artists.

==Composition and writing==
&quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; was written by songwriter William Garvey and performed by Q Lazzarus, both of whom were bandmates in the band Q Lazzarus and the Resurrection and according to friends of Garvey, had a tumultuous relationship with one another. Q Lazzarus disappeared from the public eye after the band disbanded in 1996, while Garvey died in 2009. 

The song, a &quot;haunting&quot;, &quot;dreamlike&quot; synth-pop, dark wave, new wave, and dance ballad, features Q Lazzarus&#x27;s androgynous vocals, picked guitar, snare drums, and drum pads. Its lyrics were based by Garvey on &quot;transcendence over those who see the world as only earthly and finite&quot;, with the &quot;horses&quot; in the song representing &quot;the five senses from Hindu philosophy&quot;. Evan Sawdey of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote that &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; has a &quot;strangely entrancing thump&quot; and &quot;sad, tragicomic elements&quot; in the lyrics, describing it as &quot;quirky&quot;. It was described by Tracy Moore in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; as a &quot;gothy, somber ode&quot;, and by Tyler Jenke of &quot;Tone Deaf&quot; as &quot;rather creepy&quot;.

==&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; appearance==

In the 1980s, Q Lazzarus worked as a taxi driver in New York City and was unsigned, with record labels allegedly turning her away due to her dreadlocks. One day, in 1985, she picked up director Jonathan Demme and producer Arthur Baker in her taxi during a blizzard after the two finished doing the final mix on Little Steven&#x27;s music video for his song &quot;Sun City&quot;. After dropping off Baker, Q Lazzarus asked Demme if he was in the music business, then proceeded to play her demo tape, which included &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot;. After listening to the tape, Demme was impressed, saying, &quot;Oh my God, what is this and who are you?&quot;

&quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; quickly became a cult hit after Demme used it in a scene from his 1991 film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. In the scene, the film&#x27;s antagonist, serial killer Buffalo Bill (portrayed by Ted Levine) puts on makeup in the mirror and plays with his nipple ring while his victim, Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), attempts to escape from a deep pit. As the song plays, Buffalo Bill says to himself, &quot;Would you fuck me? I&#x27;d fuck me. I&#x27;d fuck me so hard&quot;, and then begins dancing naked into a video camera with his penis and testicles tucked between his legs as Catherine cries in the background. &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; was not in the script, and other songs by David Bowie and Mick Jagger were also considered for the scene. It was originally rehearsed to Bob Seger&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Her Strut&quot;, but &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; was eventually chosen, with Levine saying that it became &quot;a little gentler&quot;, &quot;stranger&quot;, and &quot;more feminine&quot; as a result.

===Reception===
&quot;Under the Radar&quot; and &quot;Time Out&quot; included the use of &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; on their lists of the best usages of songs in films. Lauren Down wrote for &quot;Under the Radar&quot; that it was &quot;nigh on impossible&quot; to separate &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; from the film&#x27;s scene, remarking they become &quot;inextricable&quot; once &quot;he [Buffalo Bill] steps backwards in self-admiration&quot;. Howard Gorman of &quot;NME&quot; included the song on his list of songs that &quot;became inextricably linked to the horror movies they were ultimately featured in&quot;, writing, &quot;Regardless of how great a track this is...not even an &quot;MIB&quot; neuralyser can prevent us from recreating [Buffalo Bill&#x27;s] unsettling mangina-meets-Bon Jovi moment in our heads whenever we hear it.&quot; 

&quot;Bustle&quot;″s Jack O&#x27;Keeffe wrote that Levine&#x27;s performance was &quot;etched into pop culture history through...the song &#x27;Goodbye Horses&#x27; in other media&quot;. &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; was included on &quot;Flavorwire&quot;″s list of the creepiest soundtrack songs, where they wrote that the &quot;infamous &#x27;tuck&#x27; scene&quot; in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is &quot;invariably associated&quot; with the song. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Ron Hart wrote that the inclusion of &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; &quot;immortalized&quot; the song as a &quot;classic&quot;. &quot;Time Out&quot;″s Keith Uhlich labeled the song &quot;enrapturing&quot; and called the scene &quot;a pop-cultural touchstone&quot;. 

For &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Joe Coscarelli wrote that &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; &quot;adds an extra layer of eeriness&quot; to what many consider the &quot;indelible shot&quot; of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Moore wrote that the scene was &quot;played as a moment of dark degeneracy&quot; as Q Lazzarus &quot;warbles on the soundtrack&quot;. Max O&#x27;Connell of &quot;IndieWire&quot; called the use of &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; in the film a &quot;smart choice&quot; due to how it foreshadowed Buffalo Bill&#x27;s eventual failure and how its &quot;melancholy...underscores how pitiful Bill&#x27;s existence is, showing him trying to be something he&#x27;s not just to get away from what he is&quot;.

===Other appearances===
Before using &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, Demme included the song on the soundtrack for his 1988 film &quot;Married to the Mob&quot;. The &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; scene was parodied in an episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot;; Garvey later sued MGM for the show&#x27;s use of the song. The song appeared in a scene from the 2006 film &quot;Clerks II&quot;, in which Jay and Silent Bob (played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, respectively) parody the &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; scene, and it was also used in another parody of the scene from the 2019 film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot;. &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; also appeared in the 2012 slasher film &quot;Maniac&quot;, a remake of the 1980 film of the same name, as a tribute to the &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; scene. The CBS television series &quot;Clarice&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, featured the song in a 2021 episode.

&quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; was also featured in the video games &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; (2008) and &quot;Skate 3&quot; (2010). , the house in Perryopolis, Pennsylvania, used as Buffalo Bill&#x27;s house in the film is a vacation rental, and, when visitors enter the basement, &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; plays as a disco ball lights up.

==Releases and legacy==

&quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; was first released in 1988, and, in 1991, Q Lazzarus released an extended version of the song, with her song &quot;White Lines&quot; as a B-side. In 2021, Ryan Leas wrote for &quot;Stereogum&quot; that the &quot;cult icon status&quot; of the &quot;beloved&quot; &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; &quot;seems to keep strengthening over the years&quot;. Q Lazzarus has been described as a one-hit wonder by &quot;IndieWire&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; due to the success of &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot;.

Electronic band Fan Death released a disco cover of the song in 2009 for their first European tour, which was praised by &quot;The Fader&quot; as a &quot;bang-up cover&quot; with &quot;deep and husky&quot; vocals. In 2011, Kele Okereke of Bloc Party included a cover of &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; on his EP &quot;The Hunter&quot;. In 2012, Psyche&#x27;s cover of &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; was released through Optimo. In 2013, American rock band the Delta Mirror included a cover of the song on their 2013 album &quot;Better Unsung&quot;, which the staff of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described as &quot;appropriately Ian Curtis-y&quot; and Zach Kelly from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; viewed as &quot;more than a little silly&quot;. 

A 25th anniversary re-release of the single, issued by Mon Amie Records in 2013, included a B-side of a minimalist cover of the song by Hayden Thorpe and Jon Hopkins. Their cover was later included on &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, a compilation album released by Mon Amie Records in 2020, with proceeds all going towards the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association.

In 2014, Crosses, the musical side project of Deftones singer Chino Moreno, Far guitarist Shaun Lopez, and bassist Chuck Doom, released a cover of &quot;Goodbye Horses&quot; shortly after releasing their self-titled debut album. In 2021, in anticipation of a new album, the band released a second cover of the song. Ryan Leas of &quot;Stereogum&quot; called the latter cover &quot;a pretty faithful rendition&quot; that was &quot;a little grainer and more haunting&quot; than the original.

<text>&quot;&quot; (&#x27;Song of the Ålander&#x27;) is the official regional anthem of Åland, an autonomous Swedish-speaking province of Finland. Adopted in 1922, the anthem&#x27;s lyrics were written by John Grandell, and the music was composed by Johan Fridolf Hagfors. The song was first performed during the song festival in Mariehamn 1922. In Åland, the song is mostly sung on Midsummer&#x27;s Eve and on Åland&#x27;s Autonomy Day on 9 June. The song originally had four verses, but the third verse has been omitted for a long time when the song is sung and often when it appears in print.

<text>Saponins (Latin &quot;sapon&quot;, soap + &quot;-in&quot;, one of) are bitter-tasting, usually toxic plant-derived secondary metabolites. They are organic chemicals and have a foamy quality when agitated in water and a high molecular weight. They are present in a wide range of plant species throughout the bark, leaves, stems, roots and flowers but particularly in soapwort (genus &quot;Saponaria&quot;), a flowering plant, the soapbark tree (&quot;Quillaja saponaria&quot;), common corn-cockle (&quot;Agrostemma githago&quot; L.), baby&#x27;s breath (&quot;Gypsophila&quot; spp.) and soybeans (&quot;Glycine max&quot; L.). They are used in soaps, medicines (e.g. drug adjuvants), fire extinguishers, dietary supplements, steroid synthesis, and in carbonated beverages (for example, being responsible for maintaining the head on root beer). Saponins are both water and fat soluble, which gives them their useful soap properties. Some examples of these chemicals are glycyrrhizin (licorice flavoring) and quillaia (alt. quillaja), a bark extract used in beverages.

==Classification based on chemical structure==

Structurally, they are glycosides with at least one glycosidic linkage between a sugar chain (glycone) and another non-sugar organic molecule (aglycone).

===Steroid glycosides===

Steroid glycosides are saponins with 27-C atoms. They are modified triterpenoids where their aglycone is a steroid, these compounds typically consist of a steroid aglycone attached to one or more sugar molecules, which can have various biological activities. These compounds are known for their significant cytotoxic, neurotrophic and antibacterial properties. These may also be used for partial synthesis of sex hormones or steroids. 

===Triterpene glycosides===
Triterpene glycosides are natural glycosides present in various plants, herbs and sea cucumbers and possess 30-C atoms. These compounds consist of a triterpene aglycone attached to one or more sugar molecules. Triterpene glycosides exhibit a wide range of biological activities and pharmacological properties, making them valuable in traditional medicine and modern drug discovery.

==Uses==
The saponins are a subclass of terpenoids, the largest class of plant extracts. The amphipathic nature of saponins gives them activity as surfactants with potential ability to interact with cell membrane components, such as cholesterol and phospholipids, possibly making saponins useful for development of cosmetics and drugs. Saponins have also been used as adjuvants in development of vaccines, such as Quil A, an extract from the bark of &quot;Quillaja saponaria&quot;. This makes them of interest for possible use in subunit vaccines and vaccines directed against intracellular pathogens. In their use as adjuvants for manufacturing vaccines, toxicity associated with sterol complexation remains a concern.

Quillaja is toxic when consumed in large amounts, involving possible liver damage, gastric pain, diarrhea, or other adverse effects. The NOAEL of saponins is around 300 mg/kg in rodents, so a dose of 3 mg/kg should be safe with a safety factor (see Therapeutic index) of 100.

Saponins are used for their effects on ammonia emissions in animal feeding. In the United States, researchers are exploring the use of saponins derived from plants to control invasive worm species, including the jumping worm.

==Decoction==
The principal historical use of these plants was boiling down to make soap. &quot;Saponaria officinalis&quot; is most suited for this procedure, but other related species also work. The greatest concentration of saponin occurs during flowering, with the most saponin found in the woody stems and roots, but the leaves also contain some.

==Biological sources==
Saponins have historically been plant-derived, but they have also been isolated from marine organisms such as sea cucumber. They derive their name from the soapwort plant (genus &quot;Saponaria&quot;, family Caryophyllaceae), the root of which was used historically as a soap. In other representatives of this family, e.g. &quot;Agerostemma githago&quot;, &quot;Gypsophila&quot; spp.&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Dianthus&quot; sp., saponins are also present in large quantities. Saponins are also found in the botanical family Sapindaceae, including its defining genus &quot;Sapindus&quot; (soapberry or soapnut) and the horse chestnut, and in the closely related families Aceraceae (maples) and Hippocastanaceae. It is also found heavily in &quot;Gynostemma pentaphyllum&quot; (Cucurbitaceae) in a form called gypenosides, and ginseng or red ginseng (&quot;Panax&quot;, Araliaceae) in a form called ginsenosides. Saponins are also found in the unripe fruit of &quot;Manilkara zapota&quot; (also known as sapodillas), resulting in highly astringent properties. &quot;Nerium oleander&quot; (Apocynaceae), also known as White Oleander, is a source of the potent cardiac toxin oleandrin. Within these families, this class of chemical compounds is found in various parts of the plant: leaves, stems, roots, bulbs, blossom and fruit. Commercial formulations of plant-derived saponins, e.g., from the soap bark tree, &quot;Quillaja saponaria&quot;, and those from other sources are available via controlled manufacturing processes, which make them of use as chemical and biomedical reagents. Soyasaponins are a group of structurally complex oleanane-type triterpenoid saponins that include soyasapogenol (aglycone) and oligosaccharide moieties biosynthesized on soybean tissues. Soyasaponins were previously associated to plant-microbe interactions from root exudates and abiotic stresses, as nutritional deficiency.

== Role in plant ecology and impact on animal foraging ==
In plants, saponins may serve as anti-feedants, and to protect the plant against microbes and fungi. Some plant saponins (e.g., from oat and spinach) may enhance nutrient absorption and aid in animal digestion. However, saponins are often bitter to taste, and so can reduce plant palatability (e.g., in livestock feeds), or even imbue them with life-threatening animal toxicity. Some saponins are toxic to cold-blooded organisms and insects at particular concentrations. Further research is needed to define the roles of these natural products in their host organisms, which have been described as &quot;poorly understood&quot; to date.

==Ethnobotany==
Most saponins, which readily dissolve in water, are poisonous to fish. Therefore, in ethnobotany, they are known for their use by indigenous people in obtaining aquatic food sources. Since prehistoric times, cultures throughout the world have used fish-killing plants, typically containing saponins, for fishing.

Although prohibited by law, fish-poison plants are still widely used by indigenous tribes in Guyana.

On the Indian subcontinent, the Gondi people use poison-plant extracts in fishing.

In 16th century, saponins-rich plant, &quot;Agrostemma githago,&quot; was used to treat ulcers, fistulas, and hemorrhages.

Many of California&#x27;s Native American tribes traditionally used soaproot (genus &quot;Chlorogalum&quot;), and/or the root of various yucca species, which contain saponin, as a fish poison. They would pulverize the roots, mix with water to generate a foam, then put the suds into a stream. This would kill or incapacitate the fish, which could be gathered easily from the surface of the water. Among the tribes using this technique were the Lassik, the Luiseño, and the Mattole.

==Chemical structure==
The vast heterogeneity of structures underlying this class of compounds makes generalizations difficult; they&#x27;re a subclass of terpenoids, oxygenated derivatives of terpene hydrocarbons. Terpenes in turn are formally made up of five-carbon isoprene units (The alternate steroid base is a terpene missing a few carbon atoms). Derivatives are formed by substituting other groups for some of the hydrogen atoms of the base structure. In the case of most saponins, one of these substituents is a sugar, so the compound is a glycoside of the base molecule.

More specifically, the lipophilic base structure of a saponin can be a triterpene, a steroid (such as spirostanol or furostanol) or a steroidal alkaloid (in which nitrogen atoms replace one or more carbon atoms). Alternatively, the base structure may be an acyclic carbon chain rather than the ring structure typical of steroids. One or two (rarely three) hydrophilic monosaccharide (simple sugar) units bind to the base structure via their hydroxyl (OH) groups. In some cases other substituents are present, such as carbon chains bearing hydroxyl or carboxyl groups. Such chain structures may be 1-11 carbon atoms long, but are usually 2–5 carbons long; the carbon chains themselves may be branched or unbranched.

The most commonly encountered sugars are monosaccharides like glucose and galactose, though a wide variety of sugars occurs naturally. Other kinds of molecules such as organic acids may also attach to the base, by forming esters via their carboxyl (COOH) groups. Of particular note among these are sugar acids such as glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid, which are oxidized forms of glucose and galactose.
