<text>The World Chess Championship 1972 was a match for the World Chess Championship between challenger Bobby Fischer of the United States and defending champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union. The match took place in the Laugardalshöll in Reykjavík, Iceland, and has been dubbed the Match of the Century. Fischer became the first American born in the United States to win the world title, and the second American overall (Wilhelm Steinitz, the first world champion, became a naturalized American citizen in 1888). Fischer&#x27;s win also ended, for a short time, 24 years of Soviet domination of the World Championship.

The first game was played on July11, 1972. The last game (the 21st) began on August31, was after 40 moves, and Spassky resigned the next day without resuming play. Fischer won the match 12½–8½, becoming the eleventh undisputed world champion. The match was covered in the United States on ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports and by Shelby Lyman on WNET.

==Background==
The match was played during the Cold War, albeit during a period of increasing détente. The Soviet Chess School had a 24-year monopoly on the world championship title, with Spassky the latest in an uninterrupted chain of Soviet world chess champions, stretching back to the 1948 championship. The surrounding &quot;American versus Russian&quot; narrative within the Cold War context sparked excitement throughout the world, and sparked an unprecedented increase in media coverage for any chess match.

Fischer, an eccentric 29-year-old American, claimed that Soviet players gained an unfair advantage by agreeing to short draws among themselves in tournaments. In 1962, the American magazine &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and the German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; published Fischer&#x27;s article &quot;The Russians Have Fixed World Chess&quot;, in which he expounded this view. Fischer himself rarely agreed to early draws.

Spassky faced enormous political pressure to win the match. While Fischer was often famously critical of his home country (&quot;Americans want to plunk in front of a TV and don&#x27;t want to open a book ...&quot;), he too carried a burden of expectation because of the match&#x27;s political significance. No American had achieved the world championship since the first champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, became a naturalized American citizen in 1888. The unusual public interest and excitement surrounding the match was so great that it was called the &quot;Match of the Century&quot;, even though the same term had been applied to the USSR vs. Rest of the World match just two years before.

Spassky, the champion, had qualified for world championship matches in 1966 and 1969. He lost the world championship match to Tigran Petrosian in 1966. In the 1969 cycle, he won matches against Efim Geller, Bent Larsen, and Viktor Korchnoi to win the right to challenge a second time, then defeated Petrosian 12½–10½ to win the world title. He is often said to have had a &quot;universal style&quot;, &quot;involving an ability to play the most varied types of positions&quot;, but Garry Kasparov notes that &quot;from childhood he clearly had a leaning toward sharp, attacking play, and possessed a splendid feel for the initiative.&quot;

Fischer, the challenger, was in dominant form. In the Candidates matches en route to becoming the challenger in 1972, he had beaten two grandmasters, Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen, by perfect scores of 6–0 each time, a feat not previously achieved in a Candidates match. In the Candidates final against Petrosian, Fischer won the first game, lost the second, drew the next three, then finished with four consecutive wins to win the match 6½–2½. &quot;No bare statement conveys the magnitude and impact of these results. ... Fischer sowed devastation.&quot; From the last seven rounds of the Interzonal until the first game against Petrosian, Fischer won 19 games (plus 1 win on forfeit) without losing once, almost all against top grandmasters.

Fischer also had a much higher Elo rating than Spassky. On the July 1972 FIDE rating list, Fischer&#x27;s 2785 was a record 125 points ahead of the number two player – Spassky, whose rating was 2660. Fischer&#x27;s recent results and record Elo rating made him the pre-match favorite. Other observers, however, noted that Fischer had never won a game against Spassky. Before the match, Fischer had played five games against Spassky, drawing two and losing three.

Spassky&#x27;s for the match were Efim Geller, Nikolai Krogius and Iivo Nei.Fischer&#x27;s was William Lombardy. His entourage also included lawyer Paul Marshall, who played a significant role in the events surrounding the match, and USCF representative Fred Cramer. The match&#x27;s arbiter was Lothar Schmid.

World-class match play (i.e., a series of games between the same two opponents) often involves one or both players preparing one or two openings very deeply, and playing them repeatedly during the match. Preparation for such a match also involves analysis of lines known to be played by the opponent. Fischer had been famous for his unusually narrow opening repertoire: for example, almost invariably playing 1. as White, and almost always playing the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense as Black against 1.e4. He surprised Spassky by repeatedly switching openings, and by playing openings that he had never, or only rarely, played before (such as 1. as White, and Alekhine&#x27;s Defense, the Pirc Defense, and the Paulsen Sicilian as Black). Even in openings that Fischer had played before in the match, he continually deviated from the variations he had previously played, almost never repeating the same line.

==1970 Interzonal tournament==
The Interzonal tournament was held in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, in November and December 1970. The top six players of the interzonal (shown in bold in the table below) qualified for the Candidates matches. Bobby Fischer had not qualified to play in this event, as he had not participated in the 1969 US Championship (Zonal). However, Pal Benko (and the reserve William Lombardy) gave up their spot, and FIDE President Max Euwe controversially allowed Fischer to participate instead. A compensation of USD $1,500 was paid to Benko.

Portisch and Smyslov contested a six-game playoff in Portorož, Yugoslavia, in early 1971 for the reserve position for the Candidates Tournament. The match ended 3–3; Portisch was declared the winner because of a better tie-break score in the main tournament.

==1971 Candidates matches==
Petrosian, as the loser of the last championship match, and Korchnoi, as runner-up of the previous Candidates final, were seeded directly into the Candidates match stage, and were joined by the top six from the Interzonal. In the Petrosian–Hübner quarterfinal in Seville, Hübner withdrew from the match after a loss in the 7th game after several disputes with the organizers. The quarterfinals and semifinals matches were played as the best of 10 games. The final match was the best of 12 games.

Fischer dominated the 1971 Candidates matches; his victories over both Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen were unparalleled at the Candidates level. His loss in game 2 of the Candidates Final versus Tigran Petrosian ended a 20-game winning streak.

The first game of the finals started on September 30th, 1971. Fischer came with Larry Evans and Ed Edmondson, while Petrosian arrived with Alexei Suetin and Yuri Averbakh as his .

Fischer&#x27;s victory earned him the right to challenge reigning champion Spassky for the title.

==1972 World Championship match==
===Prize negotiations and opening ceremony controversy===
For some time, it seemed as though the match might not be played at all. Shortly before the match, Fischer demanded that he and Spassky receive 30% of the box-office receipts, in addition to the agreed-upon prize fund of $125,000 (5/8 to the winner, 3/8 to the loser) and 30% of the proceeds from television and film rights. Fischer agreed to play after British investment banker Jim Slater doubled the prize fund, and after much persuasion, including a phone call from Henry Kissinger (the US National Security Advisor).

Fischer, however, did not arrive in Iceland in time for the opening ceremony on July 1, required to determine the playing colors and FIDE President Max Euwe postponed the match by two days. Spassky, who appeared at the opening ceremony, refused to draw the colors by himself and asked FIDE to subject Fischer to a penalty, Fischer&#x27;s of the first game, and Russian delegation insisted on an apology from both Fischer and FIDE President. FIDE President signed a document condemning the action of the Championship Challenger and admitting that the postponement &quot;violated the FIDE rules&quot; for &quot;special reason&quot;. Fischer, on his part, wrote a letter of apology with his lawyer Paul Marshall. According to Marshall, in the first draft Fischer renounced his share of prize money, but the draft wasn&#x27;t publicly available, since it contained &quot;things damaging to Bobby&quot;. In the letter, Fischer explained that his absence was caused by being &quot;carried away by his petty dispute over money with Icelandic chess organizers&quot;, and asked for a favor to withdraw the forfeit penalty, saying it would put him at &quot;tremendous handicap&quot; and he &quot;didn&#x27;t believe that the world&#x27;s champion desired such an advantage&quot;.

After Spassky received the letter of apology on July 6, the Russian head of the State Sports Committee, Sergei Pavlov, told Spassky that he had every right to refuse to play with Fischer and insisted he should return to Moscow. Spassky &quot;politely and diplomatically&quot; declined to follow the recommendation and said he would see the match through &quot;despite Fischer&#x27;s outrageous&quot; conduct. The match was again postponed until July 11th, now initiated by Spassky as a &quot;face-saving measure&quot; to convince Pavlov that the honor of the Soviet Union had been preserved. Fischer agreed cementing his condition to drop Spassky&#x27;s demand for a forfeit.

Some commentators contended that Fischer &quot;was playing a game of psychological warfare with Spassky, and his demands, his protest, his disappearance—all were calculated to unnerve the supposedly unflappable Russian.&quot;

===Regulations and results===
The match was played as the best of 24 games, with wins counting 1 point and draws counting ½ point, and would end when one of the players scored 12½ points. If the match ended in a 12–12 tie, the defending champion (Spassky) would retain the title. The first time control was 40 moves in 2½ hours. Three games per week were scheduled. Each player was entitled to three postponements for medical reasons during the match. Games were scheduled to start on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday. If a game was adjourned, it was to be continued the next day. Saturday was a rest day. Over the course of the match, they moved their pieces nearly two thousand times.

Fischer insisted that a Staunton chess set from Jaques of London be used. The chessboard had to be remade at Fischer&#x27;s request. The match was covered throughout the world. Fischer became a worldwide celebrity, described as the Einstein of chess. His hotel received dozens of calls each day from women attracted to him, and Fischer enjoyed reading the numerous letters and telegrams that arrived, whether with compliments or criticisms. The day of the first game, Fischer arrived shortly after five o&#x27;clock, the scheduled starting time, due to heavy traffic.

===Games===
====Game 1: Spassky–Fischer, 1–0 (Nimzo-Indian Main) ====
. At the beginning of play, Fischer was not present. Spassky played 1.d4 and pressed the clock, and nine minutes elapsed before Fischer arrived, shook hands with Spassky, and responded 1...Nf6. The opening was a placid Nimzo-Indian Defense, and after 17...Ba4 the game was even (according to analysis by Filip). After a series of piece exchanges it appeared to be a ending, and no one would have been surprised if the players had agreed to a draw here.
Shockingly, Fischer played 29...Bxh2 as shown, a move that few players would consider in light of the obvious 30.g3, trapping the bishop. In exchange for the lost bishop, Black is only able to obtain two pawns (see chess piece relative value). Gligorić, Kasparov and other commentators have suggested that Fischer may have miscalculated, having planned 30...h5 31.Ke2 h4 32.Kf3 h3 33.Kg4 Bg1, but overlooking that 34.Kxh3 Bxf2 35.Bd2 keeps the bishop trapped. Anatoly Karpov suggested that Spassky was afraid of Fischer and wanted to show that he could draw with the white pieces, while Fischer wanted to disprove that as the game headed for a stale draw. Owing to unusual features in the position, Fischer had good drawing chances despite having only two pawns for the bishop. Fischer on move 56.

The game was played in two days. Spassky adjourned the game on his forty-first move, however, they didn&#x27;t reach the official adjournment time of five hours, Spassky took a loss of thirty-five minutes on his clock. The game continued the next day, and &quot;Fischer left the playing table for half an hour to protest the presence of the television cameras. Then he resigned on move 56. He told his second Lombardy that he had played too quickly because the cameras distracted him&quot;.

The first game had 2,300 spectators.

====Game 2: Fischer forfeits ====
After the first game the match organizers removed the &quot;towers&quot; and the backstage camera, and &quot;they&#x27;ve found a great new place for the cameras–completely invisible and inaudible.&quot; Fischer wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the partial changes, saying he wanted &quot;all cameras out&quot; and refused to proceed to the hall. At the starting time of the game, the match chief arbiter Lothar Schmid walked onto the stage and started Fischer&#x27;s clock. The challenger had 60 minutes to make his first move before the game resulted into a forfeit. Fischer didn&#x27;t appear. At that time, Fischer told Icelandic Chess Federation President Gudmundur Thorarinsson that, &quot;they forfeit me that&#x27;s it I&#x27;m taking the next plane back home&quot;. Thirty minutes into the game, Chester Fox agreed to remove cameras for one game, &quot;pending further discussion&quot;. When Fischer heard about it, he demanded to set back the clock to its original time before he would play. Schmid refused. Fridrik Olafsson, Icelandic Grandmaster and Fischer&#x27;s friend, intervened twelve minutes before the forfeit, but Fischer continued insisting on his demands telling Olafsson &quot;talk to me about everything but the match. I lost interest in it six months ago.&quot; Olafsson described his impression of the Fischer on the day as &quot;not very coherent. He was quite upset and he said he thought that there was a conspiracy against him by the Icelandic Chess Federation, which he believed was a communist front.&quot;

At 6 PM, an hour after the start of the game, Schmid stepped up to the playing table and stopped the clock, announcing that Fischer did not appear in the playing hall, according to rule five of the Amsterdam Agreement, lost the game by forfeit. Bobby Fischer formally protested the forfeit, supported by FIDE Delegate Fred Cramer, writing a letter to the Schmid and explaining his absence by the poor conditions in the playing hall (in particular the noise and distraction of the video and photo recording). He admitted to initially agreeing to the recording, aware that the organizers were informed about his conditions and &quot;assured by all parties concerned that modern technology had progressed to such an extent that they could photograph him without the least disturbance&quot;. The letter was delivered by Fischer in the early hours of July 14 to Schmid&#x27;s hotel room, and the match committee overruled Fischer&#x27;s protest, based on FIDE regulations he was required to protest a given game within six hours after that game ended.

Karpov speculated that this forfeited game was actually a masterstroke on Fischer&#x27;s part, a move designed specifically to upset Spassky&#x27;s equanimity.

With the score now 2–0 in Spassky&#x27;s favor, many observers believed that the match was over and Fischer would leave Iceland, and, indeed, Fischer looked to board the next plane out, only to be dissuaded by his second, William Lombardy. His decision to stay in the match was attributed by some to another phone call from Kissinger and a deluge of cablegrams. Sportingly, Spassky agreed to play the third game in a small room backstage, out of sight of the spectators. According to Pal Benko and Burt Hochberg, this concession was a psychological mistake by Spassky.

====Game 3: Spassky–Fischer, 0–1 (Modern Benoni) ====

. This game proved to be the turning point of the match. After 11.Qc2, Fischer demonstrated his understanding of the position with 11...Nh5—a seemingly move allowing White to shatter Black&#x27;s pawn structure, but Fischer&#x27;s assessment that his kingside attack created significant proved correct. Surprised by Fischer&#x27;s , Spassky did not react in the best way. Instead of 15.Bd2, 15.Ne2!? was possible (Zaitsev), or 15.f3 to prevent ...Ng4. In particular, Spassky&#x27;s 18th move, weakening the light squares, was a mistake. The game was , and Spassky resigned the next day upon seeing that Fischer had sealed the best move, 41...Bd3+ It was Fischer&#x27;s first-ever win against Spassky. 
====Game 4: Fischer–Spassky, ½–½ (Sicilian Sozin) ====

. The chief arbiter, ensuring the players would proceed to play the third game, appealed to Spassky &quot;as a sportsman&quot; to agree to play in a backstage room without cameras and audience. Spassky agreed, but only for one game. Fischer already booked all three flights that would take him from Reykjavik back to New York City, but was persuaded to &quot;give it [the match] a trial&quot; with newly established conditions.

Fischer, as White, played the Sozin Attack against Spassky&#x27;s Sicilian Defense. Spassky sacrificed a pawn, and after 17...Bxc5+ had a slight advantage (Nunn). Spassky developed a strong kingside attack, but failed to convert it into a win, the game ending in a draw. 
====Game 5: Spassky–Fischer, 0–1 (Nimzo-Indian Hübner) ====

. Game 5 was another Nimzo-Indian, this time the Hübner Variation: 4.Nf3 c5 5.e3 Nc6 6.Bd3 Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6. Fischer rebuffed Spassky&#x27;s attempt to attack; after 15...0-0 the game was even (Adorján). Fischer obtained a blocked position where Spassky was saddled with weak pawns and his had no prospects. After 26 moves, Spassky blundered with 27.Qc2, and resigned after Fischer&#x27;s 27...Bxa4!, as shown. After 28.Qxa4 Qxe4, Black&#x27;s dual threats of 29...Qxg2 and 29...Qxe1# would decide; alternatively, 28.Qd2 (or 28.Qb1) Bxd1 29.Qxd1 Qxe4 30.Qd2 a4 wins.
 
Thus Fischer had drawn level (the score was now 2½–2½), although FIDE rules stipulated that the champion retained the title if after 24 games the match ended in a tie.

After game 5, Fischer hinted to Lombardy about a surprise he had in store for game 6.
====Game 6: Fischer–Spassky, 1–0 (QGD Tartakower) ====
. Before the match began, the Soviet team that had been training Spassky debated about whether Fischer might play an opening move different from his usual 1.e4.
Fischer played 1.c4 (instead of 1.e4) for the third time in a serious game. With 3.d4 the game transposed into the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, surprising many who had never seen Fischer play the White side of that opening.

Spassky played Tartakower&#x27;s Defense (7...b6), his favorite choice in many tournaments and a line with which he had never lost. After 14.Bb5 (introduced in Furman–Geller, Moscow 1970), Spassky responded with 14...a6. Geller had previously shown Spassky 14...Qb7, the move with which Geller later beat Jan Timman at Hilversum 1973, but Spassky apparently forgot about it. Fischer&#x27;s 20.e4! – &quot;the key move of the game&quot; – struck at Black&#x27;s center and left Spassky with no good alternatives. After Spassky&#x27;s 20...d4, &quot;the pawns have no hope of further advance and the white bishop is unimpeded.&quot; After 21.f4, Fischer had the upper hand (Hort). After 26.f5, White started &quot;steadily gaining momentum&quot;.

After this game, Spassky joined the audience in applauding Fischer&#x27;s win. This astounded Fischer, who called his opponent &quot;a true sportsman&quot;.

&quot;Lombardy was ecstatic: &#x27;Bobby has played a steady, fluent game, and just watched Spassky make horrendous moves. Spassky has not met a player of Bobby&#x27;s genius and caliber before, who fights for every piece on the board; he doesn&#x27;t give in and agree to draws like the Russian grandmasters. This is a shock to Spassky.

According to C.H.O&#x27;D. Alexander: &quot;This game was notable for two things. First, Fischer played the Queen&#x27;s Gambit for the first time in his life in a serious game; second, he played it to perfection, the game indeed casting doubt on Black&#x27;s whole opening system.&quot;

The win gave Fischer the lead (3½–2½) for the first time in the match.
====Game 7: Spassky–Fischer, ½–½ (Sicilian Najdorf) ====

. Spassky played 1.e4 for the first time in the match. Fischer defended aggressively with his favorite Poisoned Pawn Variation of the Najdorf Sicilian, and after 17...Nc6 had the upper hand (Gipslis). He consolidated his extra pawn and reached a winning endgame, but then played carelessly, allowing Spassky to salvage a draw. In the final position, Fischer had two extra pawns but had to execute a draw by perpetual check in order to escape being checkmated by Spassky&#x27;s two rooks and knight. 
====Game 8: Fischer–Spassky, 1–0 (English Symmetrical) ====

. Fischer again played 1.c4 (an English Opening), soon transposing to another opening similar to game 6. After 14...a6 the game was even. Spassky sacrificed an exchange, playing 15...b5 &quot;under dubious conditions&quot; and giving up his rook for White&#x27;s bishop. After Spassky made his 19th move, Nd7, his position further deteriorated—&quot;a terrible mistake which allowed White to win back his pawn, leaving Black with a completely lost position&quot;. Fischer won, putting him ahead 5–3.


====Game 9: Spassky–Fischer, ½–½ (QGD Semi-Tarrasch) ====

. After game 8 Spassky took time off, citing an illness, which delayed game 9 by two days. The opening transposed to the Semi-Tarrasch Defense of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined. Fischer then played a of 9...b5!. After 13...0-0 the game was even (Parma). Several exchanges followed, as the game proceeded to a quiet draw after just 29 moves. 
====Game 10: Fischer–Spassky, 1–0 (Ruy Lopez Breyer) ====

. Fischer played the Ruy Lopez, an opening on which he was considered an expert. After a balanced opening, Spassky&#x27;s 25...Qxa5 gave Fischer the upper hand (25...axb5 26.Rxb5 Ba6 gives Spassky a better chance; Gligorić). Fischer responded by initiating a dangerous attack on Spassky&#x27;s king with 26.Bb3 (Matanović), suddenly placing Black in a critical situation. Spassky sacrificed the exchange for a pawn, reaching a sharp endgame where his two connected passed pawns gave almost sufficient compensation for Fischer&#x27;s small advantage. Spassky then had chances to draw, but played inexactly, and Fischer won the game with precise play. 
====Game 11: Spassky–Fischer, 1–0 (Sicilian Najdorf) ====

. As in game 7, game 11 opened with the Sicilian Najdorf and Fischer played his favorite Poisoned Pawn Variation. Spassky responded with the startling 14.Nb1 (given by many annotators at the time), retreating his knight to its starting position. Although later analysis showed that the game would maintain if Black responded correctly, Fischer was unprepared for the move and did not find the optimal reply. If Fischer had instead played 15...Ne7 then 16.N1d2!? and the game is unclear (Gipslis). After inferior defense by Fischer, Spassky trapped Fischer&#x27;s queen to reach a winning position, at which point Fischer resigned. It was Spassky&#x27;s first win since games 1 and 2; for Fischer it was the only time in his career that he lost using the Poisoned Pawn variation in a competitive game.


====Game 12: Fischer–Spassky, ½–½ (QGD Neo-orthodox) ====

. As in game 6, Fischer&#x27;s opening 1. c4 transposed into the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined. A quiet game followed. After 19.Be4, analysts gave Fischer a slight advantage (Yudovich), but by 24...a5 the game was even again (Polugaevsky). Neither player was able to find an advantage, and after 55 moves they reached an opposite-colored bishops endgame. Although Spassky had an extra pawn (four against Fischer&#x27;s three), they could not make progress, and agreed to a draw.


====Game 13: Spassky–Fischer, 0–1 (Alekhine&#x27;s Defense Modern) ====
. Fischer avoided the Sicilian Defense, with which he had lost game 11, opting for Alekhine&#x27;s Defense. After 8...a5 9.a4 (9.c3 and Black is only slightly better; Gligorić) dxe5 10.dxe5 Na6! 11.0-0 Nc5, Fischer had the upper hand (Bagirov). The game swung one way, then another, and was finally adjourned at move 42 with Fischer having an edge in a sharp position but no clear win. The Soviet team&#x27;s analysis convinced them that the position was drawn. Fischer stayed up until 8 a.m. analyzing it (the resumption being at 2:30 p.m.). He had not found a win either, but managed to win a complicated pawns-versus-rook endgame after Spassky missed a relatively simple draw with 69.Rc3+. Spassky&#x27;s seconds were stunned, and Spassky himself refused to leave the board for a long time after the game was over, unable to believe the result. He remarked, &quot;It is very strange. How can one lose with the opponent&#x27;s only rook locked in completely at g8?&quot;

Lombardy noted the shock that Spassky was in after he resigned:While Fischer dashed for his car, Spassky remained glued to his seat. A sympathetic Lothar Schmid came over, and the two shifted the pieces about with Boris demonstrating his careless mistakes. The two were left wondering how Bobby could have squeezed a win from a position which a night of competent analysis by a renowned Soviet team had showed to be a guaranteed draw.
Former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik said this game made a particularly strong impression on him. He called it &quot;the highest creative achievement of Fischer&quot;. He resolved a opposite-colored bishops endgame by sacrificing his bishop and trapping his own rook. &quot;Then five passed pawns struggled with the white rook. Nothing similar had been seen before in chess&quot;.

David Bronstein said, &quot;Of all the games from the match, the 13th appeals to me most of all. When I play through the game I still cannot grasp the innermost motive behind this or that plan or even individual move. Like an enigma, it still teases my imagination.&quot; 

When Spassky and Fischer shook hands, many in the audience thought they had agreed to a draw, thinking that 75.Rf4 draws. But 75...Rxd4! 76.Rxd4 Ke2 wins; 75.Be5 Rd1 76.Kxb3 Re1 also wins for Black.

The next seven games (games 14 through 20) were drawn. Spassky chose safe lines that Fischer was unable to break, and Fischer was unable to increase his 3-point lead.

The off-the-board antics continued, including a lawsuit against Fischer for damages by Chester Fox, who had filming rights to the match (Fischer had objected to what he said were noticeable camera noises, and the Icelandic hosts had reluctantly – they were to share in film revenues along with the two contestants – removed the television cameras), a Fischer demand to remove the first seven rows of spectators (eventually, three rows were cleared), and Soviet claims that Fischer was using chemicals and electronic devices to &#x27;influence&#x27; Spassky, resulting in an inconclusive Icelandic police sweep of the hall.
====Game 14: Fischer–Spassky, ½–½ (QGD Harrwitz) ====

. The game was postponed at Spassky&#x27;s request. Fischer was again White in a Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined. After 18.Be5 (18.Nxb6 Qxb6 19.Be5 and Fischer keeps a slight advantage; Gligorić) Bxa4 19.Qxa4 Nc6! Spassky had the upper hand (Karpov). Fischer blundered a pawn on move 21. Spassky blundered it back on move 27, however, and the game settled into a 40-move draw. 
====Game 15: Spassky–Fischer, ½–½ (Sicilian Najdorf) ====

. Fischer returned to the Najdorf Sicilian, but played the main line rather than the Poisoned Pawn Variation with which he had lost game 11. At move 13, Fischer sacrificed a pawn for , which Spassky accepted. After 19.c3, Spassky had the upper hand (Gipslis). After 28...Rd7 the game was even, but when Spassky took a second pawn with 29.Qxh5 it allowed Fischer a very strong attack. Spassky, on the brink of disaster, &quot;found miraculous replies while in time pressure&quot; and Fischer was only able to achieve a draw by threefold repetition after 43 moves. Two years later, Yugoslav grandmaster Dragoljub Velimirović improved on Spassky&#x27;s play with the piece sacrifice 13.Bxb5, winning a crushing victory in Velimirović–Al Kazzaz, Nice Olympiad 1974. Black in turn later improved on Fischer&#x27;s 12...0-0-0 with 12...b4. 
====Game 16: Fischer–Spassky, ½–½ (Ruy Lopez Exchange) ====

. Fischer played the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez, a favorite line of his. After 17...Rfe8 the game was equal (Gipslis). Spassky defended well, and after a tactical flurry in the endgame, ended up with the nominal advantage of an extra pawn in a rook ending known to be an easy . Although a draw could have been agreed after move 34, Spassky &quot;used his symbolic advantage for a little psychological torture&quot;, prolonging the game until move 60 before agreeing to a draw. 
====Game 17: Spassky–Fischer, ½–½ (Pirc Defense) ====

. Fischer played the Pirc Defense for the first time in his career. After 18...Qc7 the game was unclear (Parma). The game ended in a draw by the threefold repetition rule. 
====Game 18: Fischer–Spassky, ½–½ (Sicilian Rauzer) ====

. The game opened with a Richter–Rauzer Attack. After 19...Ne5 the game was equal (Matanović, Ugrinović). Like game 17, the game ended in a draw by threefold repetition. 
====Game 19: Spassky–Fischer, ½–½ (Alekhine&#x27;s Defense) ====

. The second Alekhine&#x27;s Defense of the match, the game ended in a draw after 40 moves. After 18...Bg5, Gligorić commented &quot;a queer situation has arisen with many tactical possibilities for both sides.&quot; After 19.Bh5 the position was unclear (Bagirov). After 37...a6, C.H.O&#x27;D. Alexander wrote: &quot;A miracle; after all the excitements – two piece sacrifices by White and the counter-sacrifice of a rook by Black – the players have reached a completely equal endgame with no chances for either side.&quot; 
====Game 20: Fischer–Spassky, ½–½ (Sicilian Rauzer) ====

. Another Richter–Rauzer, after 13...Nxd2 the game was equal (Matanović, Ugrinović), but it promised to be a &quot;keen fight when both kings castled on opposite wings&quot;. Spassky outplayed Fischer and got a better position, and Fischer &quot;eschewed complications, for the first time clearly content to play for a draw with White&quot;. Fischer headed for a endgame but Spassky twice avoided a draw by threefold repetition. After 54 moves, Fischer made an incorrect claim of threefold repetition, but Spassky agreed to a draw anyway. 
====Game 21: Spassky–Fischer, 0–1 (Sicilian Taimanov) ====

. The 21st and the last game of the match. Fischer used a line of the Sicilian that he had never before played as Black, and further surprised Spassky with a on move eight by accepting an isolated pawn and obtaining, as a compensation, &quot;good play for his pieces on the central squares&quot;. After 14...Qxf6 the game was equal (Taimanov). Spassky played badly in the endgame, and the game was adjourned with a big advantage for Fischer. Fischer&#x27;s 40th move was not the best, however; he should have played 40...Kg4 before ...h5 (his actual 40th move). Had Spassky 41.Kh3! (preventing ...Kg4), he would have had drawing chances. Instead he sealed 41.Bd7, which would have permitted Black to win with 41...Kg4 followed by his h-pawn. On September1, the day scheduled for resumption of the game, arbiter Lothar Schmid informed Fischer and the audience that Spassky had resigned the game by telephone, making Fischer the winner of the match. FIDE President Max Euwe expressed disappointment that Spassky did not go to the playing hall to congratulate Fischer. 

The final score was 12½–8½ in favor of Fischer, making him the eleventh world champion. Spassky won three games (including the forfeit in game 2), Fischer won seven games, and there were eleven draws.
==Aftermath==
Fischer&#x27;s crushing victory made him an instant celebrity. Upon his return to New York, a Bobby Fischer Day was held. He was offered numerous product endorsement offers worth millions of dollars, all of which he declined. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; with American Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz. Fischer also made television appearances on a Bob Hope special and &quot;The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson&quot;. But the games in this match proved to be his last public competitive games for two decades.

Fischer had, prior to the match, felt that the first-to-12½-points format was not fair, since it encouraged whoever was leading to play for draws instead of wins. He himself adopted this strategy in the match: after having taken a comfortable lead, he drew games 14–20. With each game, he coasted closer to the title, while Spassky lost a chance to fight back. This style of chess offended Fischer. Instead he demanded the format be changed to that used in the very first World Chess Championship, between Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort, where the winner was the first player to score 10 wins, with draws not counting. In case of a 9–9 score, the champion would retain title, and the prize fund split equally. A FIDE Congress was held in 1974 during the Nice Olympiad. The delegates voted in favor of Fischer&#x27;s 10-win proposal, but rejected the 9–9 clause as well as the possibility of an unlimited match. In response, Fischer refused to defend his title. Anatoly Karpov, who had fought his way through the 1975 candidates tournament, was declared World Champion by forfeit.

Seventeen years later, Fischer entered negotiations with sponsors willing to fund a match under his proposed format, settling on a bid from Yugoslav millionaire Jezdimir Vasiljević. Fischer insisted that since he had not been defeated in a match, he was still the true world champion. He further claimed that all the games in the FIDE-sanctioned World Championship matches, involving Karpov and his challengers Korchnoi and Kasparov, had prearranged outcomes. He then challenged Spassky (tied for 96th–102nd on the FIDE rating list at the time) to a rematch, leading to the 1992 Fischer–Spassky match.

==In popular culture==
* The musical &quot;Chess&quot;, with lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, tells the story of two chess champions, referred to only as &quot;The American&quot; and &quot;The Russian&quot;. The musical is loosely based on the 1972 World Championship match between Fischer and Spassky.
* During the 1972 Fischer–Spassky match, the Soviet bard Vladimir Vysotsky wrote an ironic two-song cycle &quot;Honor of the Chess Crown&quot;. The first song is about a rank-and-file Soviet worker&#x27;s preparation for the match with Fischer; the second is about the game. Many expressions from the songs have become catchphrases in Russian culture.
* The 2011 documentary &quot;Bobby Fischer Against the World&quot; features extensive archival footage from the match.
* The 2014 film &quot;Pawn Sacrifice&quot; tells the story of Fischer&#x27;s attempts to defeat Russian Boris Spassky and become the world champion. The film is directed by Edward Zwick and stars Tobey Maguire as Fischer and Liev Schreiber as Spassky.
* In the sixth episode of season 3 of &quot;Drunk History&quot;, comedian Rich Fulcher recounts the 1972 World Championship match between Fischer and Spassky.

<text>In mathematics, especially in algebraic geometry and the theory of complex manifolds, coherent sheaves are a class of sheaves closely linked to the geometric properties of the underlying space. The definition of coherent sheaves is made with reference to a sheaf of rings that codifies this geometric information.

Coherent sheaves can be seen as a generalization of vector bundles. Unlike vector bundles, they form an abelian category, and so they are closed under operations such as taking kernels, images, and cokernels. The quasi-coherent sheaves are a generalization of coherent sheaves and include the locally free sheaves of infinite rank.

Coherent sheaf cohomology is a powerful technique, in particular for studying the sections of a given coherent sheaf.

== Definitions ==
A quasi-coherent sheaf on a ringed space formula_1 is a sheaf formula_2 of formula_3-modules that has a local presentation, that is, every point in formula_4 has an open neighborhood formula_5 in which there is an exact sequence
:formula_6
for some (possibly infinite) sets formula_7 and formula_8.

A coherent sheaf on a ringed space formula_1 is a sheaf formula_2 of formula_3-modules satisfying the following two properties:
# formula_2 is of &quot;finite type&quot; over formula_3, that is, every point in formula_4 has an open neighborhood formula_5 in formula_4 such that there is a surjective morphism formula_17 for some natural number formula_18;
# for any open set formula_19, any natural number formula_18, and any morphism formula_21 of formula_3-modules, the kernel of formula_23 is of finite type.

Morphisms between (quasi-)coherent sheaves are the same as morphisms of sheaves of formula_3-modules.

=== The case of schemes ===

When formula_4 is a scheme, the general definitions above are equivalent to more explicit ones. A sheaf formula_2 of formula_3-modules is quasi-coherent if and only if over each open affine subscheme formula_28 the restriction formula_29 is isomorphic to the sheaf formula_30 associated to the module formula_31 over formula_32. When formula_4 is a locally Noetherian scheme, formula_2 is coherent if and only if it is quasi-coherent and the modules formula_35 above can be taken to be finitely generated.

On an affine scheme formula_36, there is an equivalence of categories from formula_32-modules to quasi-coherent sheaves, taking a module formula_35 to the associated sheaf formula_30. The inverse equivalence takes a quasi-coherent sheaf formula_2 on formula_5 to the formula_32-module formula_43 of global sections of formula_2.

Here are several further characterizations of quasi-coherent sheaves on a scheme.
== Properties ==
On an arbitrary ringed space, quasi-coherent sheaves do not necessarily form an abelian category. On the other hand, the quasi-coherent sheaves on any scheme form an abelian category, and they are extremely useful in that context.

On any ringed space formula_4, the coherent sheaves form an abelian category, a full subcategory of the category of formula_3-modules. (Analogously, the category of coherent modules over any ring formula_32 is a full abelian subcategory of the category of all formula_32-modules.) So the kernel, image, and cokernel of any map of coherent sheaves are coherent. The direct sum of two coherent sheaves is coherent; more generally, an formula_3-module that is an extension of two coherent sheaves is coherent.

A submodule of a coherent sheaf is coherent if it is of finite type. A coherent sheaf is always an formula_3-module of &quot;finite presentation&quot;, meaning that each point formula_51 in formula_4 has an open neighborhood formula_5 such that the restriction formula_29 of formula_2 to formula_5 is isomorphic to the cokernel of a morphism formula_57 for some natural numbers formula_18 and formula_59. If formula_3 is coherent, then, conversely, every sheaf of finite presentation over formula_3 is coherent.

The sheaf of rings formula_3 is called coherent if it is coherent considered as a sheaf of modules over itself. In particular, the Oka coherence theorem states that the sheaf of holomorphic functions on a complex analytic space formula_4 is a coherent sheaf of rings. The main part of the proof is the case formula_64. Likewise, on a locally Noetherian scheme formula_4, the structure sheaf formula_3 is a coherent sheaf of rings.

==Basic constructions of coherent sheaves==
* An formula_3-module formula_2 on a ringed space formula_4 is called locally free of finite rank, or a vector bundle, if every point in formula_4 has an open neighborhood formula_5 such that the restriction formula_29 is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of formula_73. If formula_2 is free of the same rank formula_18 near every point of formula_4, then the vector bundle formula_2 is said to be of rank formula_18.
:Vector bundles in this sheaf-theoretic sense over a scheme formula_4 are equivalent to vector bundles defined in a more geometric way, as a scheme formula_80 with a morphism formula_81 and with a covering of formula_4 by open sets formula_83 with given isomorphisms formula_84 over formula_83 such that the two isomorphisms over an intersection formula_86 differ by a linear automorphism. (The analogous equivalence also holds for complex analytic spaces.) For example, given a vector bundle formula_80 in this geometric sense, the corresponding sheaf formula_2 is defined by: over an open set formula_5 of formula_4, the formula_91-module formula_43 is the set of sections of the morphism formula_93. The sheaf-theoretic interpretation of vector bundles has the advantage that vector bundles (on a locally Noetherian scheme) are included in the abelian category of coherent sheaves.

*Locally free sheaves come equipped with the standard formula_3-module operations, but these give back locally free sheaves.
*Let formula_95, formula_96 a Noetherian ring. Then vector bundles on formula_4 are exactly the sheaves associated to finitely generated projective modules over formula_96, or (equivalently) to finitely generated flat modules over formula_96.
*Let formula_100, formula_96 a Noetherian formula_102-graded ring, be a projective scheme over a Noetherian ring formula_103. Then each formula_104-graded formula_96-module formula_35 determines a quasi-coherent sheaf formula_2 on formula_4 such that formula_109 is the sheaf associated to the formula_110-module formula_111, where formula_112 is a homogeneous element of formula_96 of positive degree and formula_114 is the locus where formula_112 does not vanish.
*For example, for each integer formula_18, let formula_117 denote the graded formula_96-module given by formula_119. Then each formula_117 determines the quasi-coherent sheaf formula_121 on formula_4. If formula_96 is generated as formula_103-algebra by formula_125, then formula_121 is a line bundle (invertible sheaf) on formula_4 and formula_121 is the formula_18-th tensor power of formula_130. In particular, formula_131 is called the tautological line bundle on the projective formula_18-space.
*A simple example of a coherent sheaf on formula_133 that is not a vector bundle is given by the cokernel in the following sequence
::formula_134
:this is because formula_135 restricted to the vanishing locus of the two polynomials has two-dimensional fibers, and has one-dimensional fibers elsewhere.

* Ideal sheaves: If formula_136 is a closed subscheme of a locally Noetherian scheme formula_4, the sheaf formula_138 of all regular functions vanishing on formula_136 is coherent. Likewise, if formula_136 is a closed analytic subspace of a complex analytic space formula_4, the ideal sheaf formula_138 is coherent.
* The structure sheaf formula_143 of a closed subscheme formula_136 of a locally Noetherian scheme formula_4 can be viewed as a coherent sheaf on formula_4. To be precise, this is the direct image sheaf formula_147, where formula_148 is the inclusion. Likewise for a closed analytic subspace of a complex analytic space. The sheaf formula_147 has fiber (defined below) of dimension zero at points in the open set formula_150, and fiber of dimension 1 at points in formula_136. There is a short exact sequence of coherent sheaves on formula_4:
::formula_153

*Most operations of linear algebra preserve coherent sheaves. In particular, for coherent sheaves formula_2 and formula_155 on a ringed space formula_4, the tensor product sheaf formula_157 and the sheaf of homomorphisms formula_158 are coherent.
*A simple non-example of a quasi-coherent sheaf is given by the extension by zero functor. For example, consider formula_159 for
::formula_160
:Since this sheaf has non-trivial stalks, but zero global sections, this cannot be a quasi-coherent sheaf. This is because quasi-coherent sheaves on an affine scheme are equivalent to the category of modules over the underlying ring, and the adjunction comes from taking global sections.

==Functoriality==
Let formula_161 be a morphism of ringed spaces (for example, a morphism of schemes). If formula_2 is a quasi-coherent sheaf on formula_163, then the inverse image formula_3-module (or pullback) formula_165 is quasi-coherent on formula_4. For a morphism of schemes formula_161 and a coherent sheaf formula_2 on formula_163, the pullback formula_165 is not coherent in full generality (for example, formula_171, which might not be coherent), but pullbacks of coherent sheaves are coherent if formula_4 is locally Noetherian. An important special case is the pullback of a vector bundle, which is a vector bundle.

If formula_161 is a quasi-compact quasi-separated morphism of schemes and formula_2 is a quasi-coherent sheaf on formula_4, then the direct image sheaf (or pushforward) formula_176 is quasi-coherent on formula_163.

The direct image of a coherent sheaf is often not coherent. For example, for a field formula_178, let formula_4 be the affine line over formula_178, and consider the morphism formula_181; then the direct image formula_182 is the sheaf on formula_183 associated to the polynomial ring formula_184, which is not coherent because formula_184 has infinite dimension as a formula_178-vector space. On the other hand, the direct image of a coherent sheaf under a proper morphism is coherent, by results of Grauert and Grothendieck.

==Local behavior of coherent sheaves==
An important feature of coherent sheaves formula_2 is that the properties of formula_2 at a point formula_51 control the behavior of formula_2 in a neighborhood of formula_51, more than would be true for an arbitrary sheaf. For example, Nakayama&#x27;s lemma says (in geometric language) that if formula_2 is a coherent sheaf on a scheme formula_4, then the fiber formula_194 of formula_195 at a point formula_51 (a vector space over the residue field formula_197) is zero if and only if the sheaf formula_2 is zero on some open neighborhood of formula_51. A related fact is that the dimension of the fibers of a coherent sheaf is upper-semicontinuous. Thus a coherent sheaf has constant rank on an open set, while the rank can jump up on a lower-dimensional closed subset.

In the same spirit: a coherent sheaf formula_2 on a scheme formula_4 is a vector bundle if and only if its stalk formula_202 is a free module over the local ring formula_203 for every point formula_51 in formula_4.

On a general scheme, one cannot determine whether a coherent sheaf is a vector bundle just from its fibers (as opposed to its stalks). On a reduced locally Noetherian scheme, however, a coherent sheaf is a vector bundle if and only if its rank is locally constant.

==Examples of vector bundles==
For a morphism of schemes formula_206, let formula_207 be the diagonal morphism, which is a closed immersion if formula_4 is separated over formula_163. Let formula_210 be the ideal sheaf of formula_4 in formula_212. Then the sheaf of differentials formula_213 can be defined as the pullback formula_214 of formula_210 to formula_4. Sections of this sheaf are called 1-forms on formula_4 over formula_163, and they can be written locally on formula_4 as finite sums formula_220 for regular functions formula_221 and formula_222. If formula_4 is locally of finite type over a field formula_178, then formula_225 is a coherent sheaf on formula_4.

If formula_4 is smooth over formula_178, then formula_229 (meaning formula_225) is a vector bundle over formula_4, called the cotangent bundle of formula_4. Then the tangent bundle formula_233 is defined to be the dual bundle formula_234. For formula_4 smooth over formula_178 of dimension formula_18 everywhere, the tangent bundle has rank formula_18.

If formula_163 is a smooth closed subscheme of a smooth scheme formula_4 over formula_178, then there is a short exact sequence of vector bundles on formula_163:
:formula_243
which can be used as a definition of the normal bundle formula_244 to formula_163 in formula_4.

For a smooth scheme formula_4 over a field formula_178 and a natural number formula_249, the vector bundle formula_250 of &quot;i&quot;-forms on formula_4 is defined as the formula_249-th exterior power of the cotangent bundle, formula_253. For a smooth variety formula_4 of dimension formula_18 over formula_178, the canonical bundle formula_257 means the line bundle formula_258. Thus sections of the canonical bundle are algebro-geometric analogs of volume forms on formula_4. For example, a section of the canonical bundle of affine space formula_260 over formula_178
can be written as
:formula_262
where formula_112 is a polynomial with coefficients in formula_178.

Let formula_96 be a commutative ring and formula_18 a natural number. For each integer formula_267, there is an important example of a line bundle on projective space formula_268 over formula_96, called formula_270. To define this, consider the morphism of formula_96-schemes
:formula_272
given in coordinates by formula_273. (That is, thinking of projective space as the space of 1-dimensional linear subspaces of affine space, send a nonzero point in affine space to the line that it spans.) Then a section of formula_270 over an open subset formula_5 of formula_268 is defined to be a regular function formula_112 on formula_278 that is homogeneous of degree formula_267, meaning that
:formula_280
as regular functions on (formula_281. For all integers formula_249 and formula_267, there is an isomorphism formula_284 of line bundles on formula_268.

In particular, every homogeneous polynomial in formula_286 of degree formula_267 over formula_96 can be viewed as a global section of formula_270 over formula_268. Note that every closed subscheme of projective space can be defined as the zero set of some collection of homogeneous polynomials, hence as the zero set of some sections of the line bundles formula_270. This contrasts with the simpler case of affine space, where a closed subscheme is simply the zero set of some collection of regular functions. The regular functions on projective space formula_268 over formula_96 are just the &quot;constants&quot; (the ring formula_96), and so it is essential to work with the line bundles formula_270.

Serre gave an algebraic description of all coherent sheaves on projective space, more subtle than what happens for affine space. Namely, let formula_96 be a Noetherian ring (for example, a field), and consider the polynomial ring formula_297 as a graded ring with each formula_298 having degree 1. Then every finitely generated graded formula_299-module formula_35 has an associated coherent sheaf formula_301 on formula_268 over formula_96. Every coherent sheaf on formula_268 arises in this way from a finitely generated graded formula_299-module formula_35. (For example, the line bundle formula_270 is the sheaf associated to the formula_299-module formula_299 with its grading lowered by formula_267.) But the formula_299-module formula_35 that yields a given coherent sheaf on formula_268 is not unique; it is only unique up to changing formula_35 by graded modules that are nonzero in only finitely many degrees. More precisely, the abelian category of coherent sheaves on formula_268 is the quotient of the category of finitely generated graded formula_299-modules by the Serre subcategory of modules that are nonzero in only finitely many degrees.

The tangent bundle of projective space formula_268 over a field formula_178 can be described in terms of the line bundle formula_319. Namely, there is a short exact sequence, the Euler sequence:
:formula_320
It follows that the canonical bundle formula_321 (the dual of the determinant line bundle of the tangent bundle) is isomorphic to formula_322. This is a fundamental calculation for algebraic geometry. For example, the fact that the canonical bundle is a negative multiple of the ample line bundle formula_319 means that projective space is a Fano variety. Over the complex numbers, this means that projective space has a Kähler metric with positive Ricci curvature.

=== Vector bundles on a hypersurface ===
Consider a smooth degree-formula_324 hypersurface formula_325 defined by the homogeneous polynomial formula_112 of degree formula_324. Then, there is an exact sequence
:formula_328
where the second map is the pullback of differential forms, and the first map sends
:formula_329
Note that this sequence tells us that formula_330 is the conormal sheaf of formula_4 in formula_268. Dualizing this yields the exact sequence
:formula_333
hence formula_334 is the normal bundle of formula_4 in formula_268. If we use the fact that given an exact sequence
:formula_337
of vector bundles with ranks formula_338,formula_339,formula_340, there is an isomorphism
:formula_341
of line bundles, then we see that there is the isomorphism
:formula_342
showing that
:formula_343

== Serre construction and vector bundles ==
One useful technique for constructing rank 2 vector bundles is the Serre constructionpg 3 which establishes a correspondence between rank 2 vector bundles formula_135 on a smooth projective variety formula_4 and codimension 2 subvarieties formula_163 using a certain formula_347-group calculated on formula_4. This is given by a cohomological condition on the line bundle formula_349 (see below).

The correspondence in one direction is given as follows: for a section formula_350 we can associated the vanishing locus formula_351. If formula_352 is a codimension 2 subvariety, then

# It is a local complete intersection, meaning if we take an affine chart formula_353 then formula_354 can be represented as a function formula_355, where formula_356 and formula_357
# The line bundle formula_358 is isomorphic to the canonical bundle formula_359 on formula_352

In the other direction, for a codimension 2 subvariety formula_361 and a line bundle formula_362 such that

# formula_363
# formula_364

there is a canonical isomorphismformula_365,which is functorial with respect to inclusion of codimension formula_366 subvarieties. Moreover, any isomorphism given on the left corresponds to a locally free sheaf in the middle of the extension on the right. That is, for formula_367 that is an isomorphism there is a corresponding locally free sheaf formula_135 of rank 2 that fits into a short exact sequenceformula_369This vector bundle can then be further studied using cohomological invariants to determine if it is stable or not. This forms the basis for studying moduli of stable vector bundles in many specific cases, such as on principally polarized abelian varieties and K3 surfaces.

==Chern classes and algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory==
A vector bundle formula_80 on a smooth variety formula_4 over a field has Chern classes in the Chow ring of formula_4, formula_373 in formula_374 for formula_375. These satisfy the same formal properties as Chern classes in topology. For example, for any short exact sequence
:formula_376
of vector bundles on formula_4, the Chern classes of formula_378 are given by
:formula_379

It follows that the Chern classes of a vector bundle formula_80 depend only on the class of formula_80 in the Grothendieck group formula_382. By definition, for a scheme formula_4, formula_382 is the quotient of the free abelian group on the set of isomorphism classes of vector bundles on formula_4 by the relation that formula_386 for any short exact sequence as above. Although formula_382 is hard to compute in general, algebraic K-theory provides many tools for studying it, including a sequence of related groups formula_388 for integers formula_389.

A variant is the group formula_390 (or formula_391), the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves on formula_4. (In topological terms, &quot;G&quot;-theory has the formal properties of a Borel–Moore homology theory for schemes, while &quot;K&quot;-theory is the corresponding cohomology theory.) The natural homomorphism formula_393 is an isomorphism if formula_4 is a regular separated Noetherian scheme, using that every coherent sheaf has a finite resolution by vector bundles in that case. For example, that gives a definition of the Chern classes of a coherent sheaf on a smooth variety over a field.

More generally, a Noetherian scheme formula_4 is said to have the resolution property if every coherent sheaf on formula_4 has a surjection from some vector bundle on formula_4. For example, every quasi-projective scheme over a Noetherian ring has the resolution property.

=== Applications of resolution property ===
Since the resolution property states that a coherent sheaf formula_398 on a Noetherian scheme is quasi-isomorphic in the derived category to the complex of vector bundles :formula_399
we can compute the total Chern class of formula_398 with
:formula_401

For example, this formula is useful for finding the Chern classes of the sheaf representing a subscheme of formula_4. If we take the projective scheme formula_136 associated to the ideal formula_404, then
:formula_405
since there is the resolution
:formula_406
over formula_407.

== Bundle homomorphism vs. sheaf homomorphism ==
When vector bundles and locally free sheaves of finite constant rank are used interchangeably,
care must be given to distinguish between bundle homomorphisms and sheaf homomorphisms. Specifically, given vector bundles formula_408, by definition, a bundle homomorphism formula_409 is a scheme morphism over formula_4 (i.e., formula_411) such that, for each geometric point formula_51 in formula_4, formula_414 is a linear map of rank independent of formula_51. Thus, it induces the sheaf homomorphism formula_416 of constant rank between the corresponding locally free formula_3-modules (sheaves of dual sections). But there may be an formula_3-module homomorphism that does not arise this way; namely, those not having constant rank.

In particular, a subbundle formula_419 is a subsheaf (i.e., formula_398 is a subsheaf of formula_2). But the converse can fail; for example, for an effective Cartier divisor formula_422 on formula_4, formula_424 is a subsheaf but typically not a subbundle (since any line bundle has only two subbundles).

==The category of quasi-coherent sheaves==
The quasi-coherent sheaves on any fixed scheme form an abelian category. Gabber showed that, in fact, the quasi-coherent sheaves on any scheme form a particularly well-behaved abelian category, a Grothendieck category. A quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme formula_4 (such as an algebraic variety over a field) is determined up to isomorphism by the abelian category of quasi-coherent sheaves on formula_4, by Rosenberg, generalizing a result of Gabriel.

==Coherent cohomology==

The fundamental technical tool in algebraic geometry is the cohomology theory of coherent sheaves. Although it was introduced only in the 1950s, many earlier techniques of algebraic geometry are clarified by the language of sheaf cohomology applied to coherent sheaves. Broadly speaking, coherent sheaf cohomology can be viewed as a tool for producing functions with specified properties; sections of line bundles or of more general sheaves can be viewed as generalized functions. In complex analytic geometry, coherent sheaf cohomology also plays a foundational role.

Among the core results of coherent sheaf cohomology are results on finite-dimensionality of cohomology, results on the vanishing of cohomology in various cases, duality theorems such as Serre duality, relations between topology and algebraic geometry such as Hodge theory, and formulas for Euler characteristics of coherent sheaves such as the Riemann–Roch theorem.

<text>In algebraic geometry, a proper morphism between schemes is an analog of a proper map between complex analytic spaces.

Some authors call a proper variety over a field formula_1 a complete variety. For example, every projective variety over a field formula_1 is proper over formula_1. A scheme formula_4 of finite type over the complex numbers (for example, a variety) is proper over C if and only if the space formula_4(C) of complex points with the classical (Euclidean) topology is compact and Hausdorff.

A closed immersion is proper. A morphism is finite if and only if it is proper and quasi-finite.

== Definition ==

A morphism formula_6 of schemes is called universally closed if for every scheme formula_7 with a morphism formula_8, the projection from the fiber product
:formula_9
is a closed map of the underlying topological spaces. A morphism of schemes is called proper if it is separated, of finite type, and universally closed ([EGA] II, 5.4.1 ). One also says that formula_4 is proper over formula_11. In particular, a variety formula_4 over a field formula_1 is said to be proper over formula_1 if the morphism formula_15 is proper.

== Examples ==
For any natural number &quot;n&quot;, projective space P&quot;n&quot; over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; is proper over &quot;R&quot;. Projective morphisms are proper, but not all proper morphisms are projective. For example, there is a smooth proper complex variety of dimension 3 which is not projective over C. Affine varieties of positive dimension over a field &quot;k&quot; are never proper over &quot;k&quot;. More generally, a proper affine morphism of schemes must be finite. For example, it is not hard to see that the affine line &quot;A&quot;1 over a field &quot;k&quot; is not proper over &quot;k&quot;, because the morphism &quot;A&quot;1 → Spec(&quot;k&quot;) is not universally closed. Indeed, the pulled-back morphism
:formula_16
(given by (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) ↦ &quot;y&quot;) is not closed, because the image of the closed subset &quot;xy&quot; = 1 in &quot;A&quot;1 × &quot;A&quot;1 = &quot;A&quot;2 is &quot;A&quot;1 − 0, which is not closed in &quot;A&quot;1.

==Properties and characterizations of proper morphisms==
In the following, let &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; be a morphism of schemes.
* The composition of two proper morphisms is proper.
* Any base change of a proper morphism &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is proper. That is, if &quot;g&quot;: Z → &quot;Y&quot; is any morphism of schemes, then the resulting morphism &quot;X&quot; ×&quot;Y&quot; &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; is proper. 
* Properness is a local property on the base (in the Zariski topology). That is, if &quot;Y&quot; is covered by some open subschemes &quot;Yi&quot; and the restriction of &quot;f&quot; to all &quot;f−1(Yi)&quot; is proper, then so is &quot;f&quot;.
* More strongly, properness is local on the base in the fpqc topology. For example, if &quot;X&quot; is a scheme over a field &quot;k&quot; and &quot;E&quot; is a field extension of &quot;k&quot;, then &quot;X&quot; is proper over &quot;k&quot; if and only if the base change &quot;X&quot;&quot;E&quot; is proper over &quot;E&quot;.
* Closed immersions are proper.
* More generally, finite morphisms are proper. This is a consequence of the going up theorem. 
* By Deligne, a morphism of schemes is finite if and only if it is proper and quasi-finite. This had been shown by Grothendieck if the morphism &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is locally of finite presentation, which follows from the other assumptions if &quot;Y&quot; is noetherian.
* For &quot;X&quot; proper over a scheme &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;Y&quot; separated over &quot;S&quot;, the image of any morphism &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; over &quot;S&quot; is a closed subset of &quot;Y&quot;. This is analogous to the theorem in topology that the image of a continuous map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a closed subset.
* The Stein factorization theorem states that any proper morphism to a locally noetherian scheme can be factored as &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;, where &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; is proper, surjective, and has geometrically connected fibers, and &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is finite.
* Chow&#x27;s lemma says that proper morphisms are closely related to projective morphisms. One version is: if &quot;X&quot; is proper over a quasi-compact scheme &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;X&quot; has only finitely many irreducible components (which is automatic for &quot;Y&quot; noetherian), then there is a projective surjective morphism &quot;g&quot;: &quot;W&quot; → &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;W&quot; is projective over &quot;Y&quot;. Moreover, one can arrange that &quot;g&quot; is an isomorphism over a dense open subset &quot;U&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, and that &quot;g&quot;−1(&quot;U&quot;) is dense in &quot;W&quot;. One can also arrange that &quot;W&quot; is integral if &quot;X&quot; is integral.
*Nagata&#x27;s compactification theorem, as generalized by Deligne, says that a separated morphism of finite type between quasi-compact and quasi-separated schemes factors as an open immersion followed by a proper morphism.
* Proper morphisms between locally noetherian schemes preserve coherent sheaves, in the sense that the higher direct images &quot;Rif&quot;∗(&quot;F&quot;) (in particular the direct image &quot;f&quot;∗(&quot;F&quot;)) of a coherent sheaf &quot;F&quot; are coherent (EGA III, 3.2.1). (Analogously, for a proper map between complex analytic spaces, Grauert and Remmert showed that the higher direct images preserve coherent analytic sheaves.) As a very special case: the ring of regular functions on a proper scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; has finite dimension as a &quot;k&quot;-vector space. By contrast, the ring of regular functions on the affine line over &quot;k&quot; is the polynomial ring &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;], which does not have finite dimension as a &quot;k&quot;-vector space.
*There is also a slightly stronger statement of this: let formula_17 be a morphism of finite type, &quot;S&quot; locally noetherian and formula_18 a formula_19-module. If the support of &quot;F&quot; is proper over &quot;S&quot;, then for each formula_20 the higher direct image formula_21 is coherent.
*For a scheme &quot;X&quot; of finite type over the complex numbers, the set &quot;X&quot;(C) of complex points is a complex analytic space, using the classical (Euclidean) topology. For &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; separated and of finite type over C, a morphism &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; over C is proper if and only if the continuous map &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot;(C) → &quot;Y&quot;(C) is proper in the sense that the inverse image of every compact set is compact.
* If &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot;→&quot;Y&quot; and &quot;g&quot;: &quot;Y&quot;→&quot;Z&quot; are such that &quot;gf&quot; is proper and &quot;g&quot; is separated, then &quot;f&quot; is proper. This can for example be easily proven using the following criterion.

== Valuative criterion of properness ==
There is a very intuitive criterion for properness which goes back to Chevalley. It is commonly called the valuative criterion of properness. Let &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; be a morphism of finite type of Noetherian schemes. Then &quot;f&quot; is proper if and only if for all discrete valuation rings &quot;R&quot; with fraction field &quot;K&quot; and for any &quot;K&quot;-valued point &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) that maps to a point &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) that is defined over &quot;R&quot;, there is a unique lift of &quot;x&quot; to formula_22. (EGA II, 7.3.8). More generally, a quasi-separated morphism &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; of finite type (note: finite type includes quasi-compact) of &#x27;any&#x27; schemes &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; is proper if and only if for all valuation rings &quot;R&quot; with fraction field &quot;K&quot; and for any &quot;K&quot;-valued point &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) that maps to a point &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) that is defined over &quot;R&quot;, there is a unique lift of &quot;x&quot; to formula_22. (Stacks project Tags 01KF and 01KY). Noting that &quot;Spec K&quot; is the generic point of &quot;Spec R&quot; and discrete valuation rings are precisely the regular local one-dimensional rings, one may rephrase the criterion: given a regular curve on &quot;Y&quot; (corresponding to the morphism &quot;s&quot;: Spec &quot;R&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;) and given a lift of the generic point of this curve to &quot;X&quot;, &quot;f&quot; is proper if and only if there is exactly one way to complete the curve.

Similarly, &quot;f&quot; is separated if and only if in every such diagram, there is at most one lift formula_22.

For example, given the valuative criterion, it becomes easy to check that projective space P&quot;n&quot; is proper over a field (or even over Z). One simply observes that for a discrete valuation ring &quot;R&quot; with fraction field &quot;K&quot;, every &quot;K&quot;-point [&quot;x&quot;0...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;] of projective space comes from an &quot;R&quot;-point, by scaling the coordinates so that all lie in &quot;R&quot; and at least one is a unit in &quot;R&quot;.

=== Geometric interpretation with disks ===
One of the motivating examples for the valuative criterion of properness is the interpretation of formula_25 as an infinitesimal disk, or complex-analytically, as the disk formula_26. This comes from the fact that every power seriesformula_27converges in some disk of radius formula_28 around the origin. Then, using a change of coordinates, this can be expressed as a power series on the unit disk. Then, if we invert formula_29, this is the ring formula_30 which are the power series which may have a pole at the origin. This is represented topologically as the open disk formula_31 with the origin removed. For a morphism of schemes over formula_32, this is given by the commutative diagramformula_33Then, the valuative criterion for properness would be a filling in of the point formula_34 in the image of formula_35.

==== Example ====
It&#x27;s instructive to look at a counter-example to see why the valuative criterion of properness should hold on spaces analogous to closed compact manifolds. If we take formula_36 and formula_37, then a morphism formula_38 factors through an affine chart of formula_4, reducing the diagram toformula_40where formula_41 is the chart centered around formula_42 on formula_4. This gives the commutative diagram of commutative algebrasformula_44Then, a lifting of the diagram of schemes, formula_45, would imply there is a morphism formula_46 sending formula_47 from the commutative diagram of algebras. This, of course, cannot happen. Therefore formula_4 is not proper over formula_11.

=== Geometric interpretation with curves ===
There is another similar example of the valuative criterion of properness which captures some of the intuition for why this theorem should hold. Consider a curve formula_50 and the complement of a point formula_51. Then the valuative criterion for properness would read as a diagramformula_52with a lifting of formula_53. Geometrically this means every curve in the scheme formula_4 can be completed to a compact curve. This bit of intuition aligns with what the scheme-theoretic interpretation of a morphism of topological spaces with compact fibers, that a sequence in one of the fibers must converge. Because this geometric situation is a problem locally, the diagram is replaced by looking at the local ring formula_55, which is a DVR, and its fraction field formula_56. Then, the lifting problem then gives the commutative diagramformula_57where the scheme formula_58 represents a local disk around formula_59 with the closed point formula_59 removed.

== Proper morphism of formal schemes ==
Let formula_61 be a morphism between locally noetherian formal schemes. We say &quot;f&quot; is proper or formula_62 is proper over formula_63 if (i) &quot;f&quot; is an adic morphism (i.e., maps the ideal of definition to the ideal of definition) and (ii) the induced map formula_64 is proper, where formula_65 and &quot;K&quot; is the ideal of definition of formula_63. The definition is independent of the choice of &quot;K&quot;.

For example, if &quot;g&quot;: &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; is a proper morphism of locally noetherian schemes, &quot;Z&quot;0 is a closed subset of &quot;Z&quot;, and &quot;Y&quot;0 is a closed subset of &quot;Y&quot; such that &quot;g&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;0) ⊂ &quot;Z&quot;0, then the morphism formula_67 on formal completions is a proper morphism of formal schemes.

Grothendieck proved the coherence theorem in this setting. Namely, let formula_61 be a proper morphism of locally noetherian formal schemes. If &quot;F&quot; is a coherent sheaf on formula_62, then the higher direct images formula_21 are coherent.

<text>Yeppoon () is a coastal town and locality in the Shire of Livingstone, Queensland, Australia. Yeppoon is renowned for its beaches, tropical climate, and the islands out on the bay. Located from the city of Rockhampton, Yeppoon is the seat of the Shire of Livingstone and the principal town on the Capricorn Coast, a string of seaside communities stretching more than from north to south. The beaches and shallow coves provide a destination both for tourists and retirees settling down in Central Queensland. Offshore, there are 27 islands including Great Keppel Island which is from Yeppoon. In the , the locality of Yeppoon had a population of 7,037 people; this does not include any neighbouring suburbs.

==Geography==

Yeppoon is located on Keppel Bay which opens to the Coral Sea, around north of the state capital, Brisbane, and from Rockhampton City. It is located within the local government area of Shire of Livingstone in Central Queensland. Between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Rockhampton Region).

The Rockhampton-Yeppoon Road (as Yeppoon Road) runs along part of the southern boundary.

==History==
The Capricorn Coast is part of the traditional lands of the Darumbal Aboriginal people. Yeppoon was first settled by the Ross family in 1865 who took up large landholding along the length of the Capricorn Coast. Fruit crops, cattle, and wool were the major industries of the early town. A short-lived period of sugar cane growing followed from 1883 to 1903, which failed due to unseasonal rains and lack of financial backing. Along with other sugar growing areas of Australia, South Sea Islanders were used as labourers on the sugar plantations, often without their consent (see blackbirding). Pineapples, mangoes, and other tropical fruit became the mainstay of local agriculture in the new century, with cattle grazing and fishing also contributing to the local economy. 

Yeppoon Provisional School opened on 4 May 1885 and became Yeppoon State School on 1 October 1889. Originally in Queen Street, it was relocated in 1957 to Tucker Street.

St Ursula&#x27;s College, a Catholic day and boarding school for girls, was established on 12 March 1918 by the Presentation Sisters.

St Brendan&#x27;s College, a Catholic day and boarding school for boys, was established on 8 October 1939 by the Christian Brothers.

Yeppoon Infants State School opened on 24 January 1955, but closed in 1968.

Yeppoon State High School opened on 28 January 1969.

The Bay View Tower motel and restaurant become Yeppoon first high-rise building in 1986.

On 20 February 2015, severe tropical cyclone Marcia crossed the Capricorn Coast near Shoalwater Bay as a category 5 Cyclone. The storm destroyed more than 150 houses in Yeppoon and left more than 13,500 residents without power.

The Yeppoon Public Library was opened in 1990 and went through a major refurbishment in 2017.

Yeppoon is within the local government area of Shire of Livingstone (between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Rockhampton Region following a local government amalgamation that was reversed in 2014).

== Demographics ==
In the , the locality of Yeppoon had a population of 6,334 people.

In the , the locality of Yeppoon had a population of 7,037 people; this does not include any neighbouring suburbs.

==Heritage listings==
Yeppoon has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Yeppoon railway station, James Street ()
* Yeppoon War Memorial, Normanby Street ()
* former Yeppoon State School building, 29 Queen Street ()
* current Yeppoon State School, Tucker Street ()

==Governance==

In 1879, the Gogango Division was established as one of 74 divisions in Queensland under the &quot;Divisional Boards Act 1879&quot;. The Gogango Divisional Board&#x27;s scope of authority comprised a large area north and east of Rockhampton. While the Division was administered in Rockhampton, a locally appointed body, the Yeppoon Progress Association, met once a month to look after the minor requirements of the town.

The discovery of gold brought a huge influx of people to the region, and the various boards broke up into smaller administrative bodies to better service the growing population. In 1903, the Gogango Divisional Board was renamed Shire of Livingstone.

The boundaries of the new shire remained largely unchanged until 1984, when outlying districts including the suburbs of Nerimbera and Parkhurst were ceded to Livingstone&#x27;s larger neighbour, City of Rockhampton. Continued growth in both &quot;Local Government Authorities&quot; became a contentious subject from then on, which caused much political tension, until finally in 2007, local conflicts came to a head with the tabling before the Parliament of Queensland of the proposed &quot;Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007&quot;.

The Act passed, and on 15 March 2008, Livingstone Shire merged with Fitzroy Shire, Mount Morgan Shire, and Rockhampton City to form the new local government area, Rockhampton Region. This forced amalgamation caused political tension. Following a majority vote by residents to restore the Shire of Livingstone, on 1 January 2014, the Shire of Livingstone was re-established with its 2008 boundaries with its seat at Yeppoon.

== Education ==
Yeppoon State School is a government primary (Early Childhood to Year 6) school for boys and girls in 14–16 Tucker Street ().

In 2018, the school had an enrolment of 320 students with 28 teachers (24 full-time equivalent) and 16 non-teaching staff (12 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program.

Yeppoon State High School is a government secondary (7–12) school for boys and girls at 30 Rawlings Street (). In 2015, the school had an enrolment of 1,006 students with 84 teachers (81 full-time equivalent) and 44 non-teaching staff (32 full-time equivalent). In 2018, the school had an enrolment of 1,033 students with 88 teachers (86 full-time equivalent) and 41 non-teaching staff (31 full-time equivalent).

==Media==
Although mainly served by media from nearby Rockhampton, there is a small selection of local media based on the Capricorn Coast.

Until 2020, Yeppoon had its own weekly newspaper called &quot;The Capricorn Coast Mirror&quot;, which was started by locals John and Suzy Watson in 1983. &quot;The Capricorn Coast Mirror&quot; was an offshoot to the region&#x27;s daily newspaper &quot;The Morning Bulletin&quot;, focusing on news and issues directly relevant to communities throughout Livingstone Shire and the Capricorn Coast. However, in 2020, &quot;The Mirror&quot; was one of 36 small newspapers in Australia which were closed entirely by News Corp Australia.

An independent news magazine called &quot;The Spectator&quot; is published locally on the Capricorn Coast and issued fortnightly. It was also established by Suzy and John Watson as an independent alternative for news in the Livingstone Shire.

Keppel FM (formerly 4NAG) is Yeppoon&#x27;s local community radio station which has locally based on-air presenters hosting a variety of special interest programming each day from a studio in Yeppoon. The station was founded in 1998 and broadcasts to the Livingstone Shire on 91.3 FM.

==Sport==
The local rugby league team is the Yeppoon Seagulls, established 1968. The club competes in the Rockhampton District Rugby League competition. Yeppoon is home to prominent Rugby league breeding ground St. Brendan&#x27;s College. Professional players Paul Bowman, Casey Conway, Tom Hewitt, PJ Marsh, Shane Marteene, Julian O&#x27;Neill, Matthew Scott, Jake Granville, Corey Oates, Dave Taylor, Ben Hunt and Harry Grant are all St. Brendan&#x27;s alumni.

The Capricorn Coast Football Club founded in 1972 competes in the local soccer competition. The Yepoon Swans, established in 1981 as Cap Coast, play out of Swan Park and compete in AFL Capricornia. The senior men&#x27;s team set the record for the most consecutive wins in an Australian rules football competition, remaining undefeated for 8 years and 128 matches achieving 8 straight premierships.

== Climate ==
Yeppoon experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa/Cwa), with hot, wet summers and very mild, relatively dry winters. Average annual rainfall is , with a late summer maximum. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 25 July 1995 to on 28 November 2018.

<text>Nezha (, Nézhā) or sometimes Nezha the Crown Prince (, ), is a protection deity in Taoism and Chinese folk religion. His official Taoist name is &quot;Marshal of the Central Altar&quot; (). He was then given the title &quot;Third Lotus Prince&quot; () after he became a deity.

==Legend==

According to &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot;, Nezha was born during the Shang dynasty in a military fortress at Chentang Pass, as the incarnation of Lingzhu Zi (灵珠子), who is destined to assist King Wu of Zhou in the upcoming war against the Shang. His father was a military commander Li Jing, who later became the &quot;Pagoda-wielding Heavenly King&quot;. Nezha&#x27;s mother, Lady Yin, gave birth to a ball of flesh after gestating for three years and six months. Li Jing thought his wife had given birth to a demon and attacked the ball with his sword. The ball split open, and Nezha jumped out as a boy instead of an infant. Nezha could jump and walk immediately after birth. He was later accepted by the immortal Taiyi Zhenren as a student. He had two older brothers, Jinzha, a disciple of Wenshu Guangfa Tianzun, and Muzha.

When Nezha was seven years old, he asked his mother for permission to go play outside of Chentang Pass. She agreed, on the condition that he took a family servant with him. After walking for about a mile, he became sick of the summer heat, and decided to take a bath in the nearby Jiuwan Stream, using his weapon, a red sash named Huntian Ling (混天绫) as a towel. It sent tremors through the water, shaking the East Sea Dragon King, Ao Guang&#x27;s undersea palace. A Yaksha, Li Gen, was sent to investigate the disturbance. Nezha insulted him, causing him to attack Nezha and be killed by his set of rings called the Qiankun Quan (乾坤圈). The Dragon King&#x27;s soldiers reported Li Gen&#x27;s death to him, and Ao Bing, his third son, volunteered to deal with Nezha.

Nezha slew him in combat, then pulled out his tendons to make a belt for Li Jing. When Ao Guang learned of his son&#x27;s death, he transformed into a human scholar and went to Li Jing&#x27;s residence to protest. Nezha admitted to killing Ao Bing and returned his tendons to Ao Guang, who told Li Jing he would file a complaint to the Jade Emperor.

Facing his parents&#x27; wrath, Nezha went to Taiyi Zhenren for help. He drew an invisibility talisman on Nezha and told him to ambush Ao Guang under the Heavenly Gate. Nezha subjected the Dragon King to a beating, then forced him to turn into a small snake and return to Chentang Pass with him. Upon arrival, Ao Guang transformed back into his human form, proclaiming he would gather the other Dragon Kings of the Four Seas and report the Li family to the Jade Emperor together, before disappearing in a breeze.

Lady Yin then sent Nezha into the back garden. He climbed up the barbican, where he came across the weapons Qiankun Bow (乾坤弓) and Zhengtian Arrows (震天箭) of the Yellow Emperor, sitting on a weapon rack. Eager for some archery practice, he lifted the bow and shot an arrow into the air, which flew all the way to White Bone Cave and killed the Biyun Tongzi (碧云童子; lit: Verdant Cloud Boy), an acolyte of Lady Shiji (石矶娘娘). Because Li Jing had carved his name onto the arrow, Shiji went to Chentang Pass, seized him, and took him back to her abode.

Li Jing explained to her that no one had been strong enough to lift the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s bow since it was placed in Chentang Pass, and she allowed him to return to the pass to find the real culprit. When he learned that Nezha was responsible, he took his son back to the White Bone Cave to answer to Shiji. Nezha attacked her other acolyte and tried to fight Shiji, but had both of his weapons taken away, forcing him to flee to his master&#x27;s abode. Taiyi Zhenren killed Shiji with the flames of the Jiulong Shenhuo Zhao (九龙神火罩 ; lit: Nine Dragon Divine Bell Cover), reducing her to her true form: a rock.

Taiyi then informed Nezha that the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas, with the permission of the Jade Emperor, had come for his parents.To save his family, Nezha killed himself then, carving up his own flesh and dismembering his bones, &quot;returning&quot; these to his parents in repayment for the debt of his birth. 

Nezha then appeared in his mother&#x27;s dream. In the dream, he asked her to build a temple for him, so that his soul would have a place to rest. This constitutes a link to Nezha&#x27;s birth because the night before Nezha was born, Lady Yin had a dream where a Taoist put something into her bosom and told her to take this child. In both instances, a dream was used to communicate a message.

His mother then secretly built a temple for Nezha, and this temple later flourished. This temple became well-known and grew vastly because of Nezha&#x27;s efficiency at granting prayers. However, Li Jing soon found out about this temple and burned it down because he was still angry at Nezha and felt that he had already caused too much trouble for their family.

Li Jing burning the temple caused Nezha to desire his father&#x27;s death. Thus, the enmity between father and son grew. Nezha was later brought back to life by his teacher, Taiyi Zhenren, who used lotus roots to construct a human body for his soul and gave him two new weapons: the Fenghuolun or Wind Fire Wheels () and the Huojianqiang or Fire-tipped Spear (). With the reincarnation of Nezha by his master, Li Jing and Nezha fought many battles. However, Li Jing soon realized that his mortal body was no match for Nezha and so he ran for his life. On the run, he met his second son, Muzha, who fought and was defeated by Nezha. At this, Li Jing attempted suicide but was stopped by Wenshu Guangfa Tianzun, who also contained Nezha. In the end, Nezha was forced to submit to his father by another deity, Randeng Daoren.

In popular culture, Nezha&#x27;s killing of Li Gen and Ao Bing is often seen as a result of Ao Guang demanding young boys and girls from Chentang Pass as sacrifices. When the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas threatened to flood Chentang Pass in retaliation, Nezha committed suicide to save his family and the people.

The above plot is only found in the 1979 Shanghai Animation Film Studio movie, &quot;Nezha Conquers the Dragon King&quot;, and not in the &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot; novel or Qing dynasty opera adaptations. The 19th century Guci manuscript, &quot;Fengshen Bang&quot;, is the earliest source that mentions the flooding of Chentang Pass: the North Sea Dragon King, Ao Ji, first proposed the idea during the four Dragon Kings&#x27; gathering. However, the South Sea Dragon King, Ao Shun, convinced his brothers to submit a complaint to the Jade Emperor together instead. 

According to &quot;The Journey to the West&quot;, Nezha was born with the word &quot;Ne&quot; written on the palm of his left hand and &quot;zha&quot; on his right, hence his name. But after he caused havoc in the Eastern Ocean, the Heavenly King had been so worried about the disastrous consequences that he decided to kill Nezha.

Thus Nezha returned his flesh and blood to his mother and bones to his father. Then Nezha&#x27;s soul went to the Buddha, who resurrected him. After, he used his vast powers to subdue 96 caves of demons through dharma. After this Nezha wanted to kill his father because he had to remove every piece of flesh and every stain of blood to return his bones to his father. The heavenly king had no choice but to seek help from the Buddha. The Buddha gave him an intricately made golden pagoda, in each story of which were Buddhas radiant with splendor. The Buddha told Nezha to regard these Buddhas as his father, thus ending the hatred between the father and the son and Li Jing earned the title of Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly king.

==Iconography==

Nezha is often depicted as a youth, although he does sometimes appear as an adult from time to time. He is often shown flying in the sky riding on the Wind Fire Wheels (), has the Universe Ring () around his body (sometimes in his left hand), the Red Armillary Sash () around his shoulders and a Fire-tipped Spear () in his right hand. Sometimes, he is shown in his &quot;three heads and six arms&quot; form (). 

In the Yuan dynasty &quot;Sanjiao Soushen Daquan&quot;, prior to his reincarnation into the mortal realm, he is a great immortal under the Jade Emperor, who wears a golden wheel around his head, has three heads, nine eyes, and eight arms, and can blow azure clouds out of his mouth. After his suicide and resurrection by the Buddha, he wields a spear and an embroidered ball. 

===Origin===
According to Meir Shahar, the name Nezha comes from Nalakuvara, depicted as a heroic yaksha general in the Mahamayuri. The link to Nalakuvara is established through variants in his Chinese name appearing in translations of Tantric Buddhist Texts.

The original variant Naluojiupoluo () changed to Naluojubaluo (), Nazhajuwaluo () and finally Nazha (). The simple addition of the &quot;mouth radical&quot; () to Na () changes the name to the current form Nezha ().

In addition, Nalakuvara&#x27;s father Kubera was eventually absorbed into the Buddhist pantheon as the Heavenly King Vaiśravaṇa. Shahar notes that Vaisravana was somehow connected to the historical Tang Dynasty general Li Jing. This explains the name and position of Nezha&#x27;s father, the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li Jing. 

===Worship===
Nezha is worshipped in Chinese folk religion and is called &quot;Marshal of the Central Altar&quot; or &quot;Prince Nezha&quot;, the &quot;Third Prince&quot;.

As in traditional folklore, Nezha flies around swiftly on his wind fire wheels, so he is also regarded as the tutelary god of many professional drivers, like trucks, taxis, or sightseeing bus drivers. They tend to place a small statue of Nezha in the vehicles for a safe drive.

Nezha is also often regarded as the patron god of children and filial piety. Parents would make an offering to Nezha with the hope that their children would grow up strong, healthy, and be dutiful and respectful.

==Influence==

===Arts===
Nezha has frequently appeared in Chinese mythology and ancient Chinese literature such as &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot; (or &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot;), although the story of &quot;Nezha Conquering the Sea&quot; is the most well known among Chinese households.

In &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Nezha was a general under his father, &quot;Pagoda-wielding Heavenly King&quot; Li Jing. He fought the Monkey King, Sun Wukong, when the latter rebelled against the Jade Emperor. They later became friends. Nezha made some appearances in the novel to help the four protagonists defeat powerful demons including his adoptive sister, Lady Earth Flow.

Nezha is a recurring character in R. F. Kuang&#x27;s 2018 novel The Poppy War and her trilogy of the same name. In the series Nezha is the second son of a powerful Warlord in a country loosely based on China.
===Media===
Nezha has been the central character in over 20 different films and television programs, both live-action and animated, dating back at least as early as a pre-communist Chinese live-action feature film, &quot;Nézhā Chūshì&quot; (), produced by the Great Wall Film Company and premiered, according to differing accounts, in either 1927 or 1928., In addition, he has appeared as a supporting character in numerous others, chiefly among the many adaptations of &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Journey to the West&quot;.

The character increased in popularity in 1979 with the traditionally-animated feature film &quot;Nezha Conquers the Dragon King&quot;, which was screened at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival and is considered one of the great classic works of Chinese animation. On 30 May 2014, Google paid homage to this film with an animated doodle on their Hong Kong search engine&#x27;s homepage.

A sequel, &quot;Ne Zha 2&quot; (2025), set further box office records, becoming the highest-grossing film in China, and the highest grossing non-English language film of all time, and the highest grossing animated movie of all time.

The 2021 animated film &quot;New Gods: Nezha Reborn&quot; depicts Nezha reincarnated in a cyberpunk setting 3,000 years after the original story.

A 2017 announcement from the leadership of Hasbro confirmed that Nezha will appear in a crossover with the &quot;Transformers&quot; franchise. The series, titled &quot;My Nezha and Transformers&quot;, consists of 52 11-minute episodes and is produced by Allspark Animation and China Central Television. The series was set for release in 2024.

The character has also been evoked outside of the fantasy genre, in realistic contemporary and period drama films as a byword for a rebellious, nonconformist young person, such as in &quot;Rebels of the Neon God&quot; (, 1992), &quot;Spin Kid&quot; (, 2011), &quot;Nezha&quot; (, 2014) and &quot;Operation Mekong&quot; (2016, in which a character is codenamed Nezha).

<text>Charles Decker Reidpath (September 20, 1889 – October 21, 1975) was an American track and field sprinter and winner of two gold medals at the 1912 Summer Olympics, who later went on to have an outstanding military career.

==Biography==
Born in Buffalo, New York, and a graduate of that city&#x27;s Lafayette High School, Reidpath became a collegiate track star at Syracuse University, winning the 220 yd (201 m) and 440 yd (402 m) dashes in the 1912 intercollegiate games. He also played football at Syracuse.

On graduating from Syracuse in 1912 with a degree in civil engineering, Reidpath was pressured by relatives to quit sports and take a position with the family business in Buffalo. Instead, he made the U.S. Olympic track team and headed to Stockholm, Sweden. Reidpath won the 400 m in an Olympic record shattering time of 48.2 seconds, a mark also ratified as a world record. Running the anchor leg of the 4 × 400 m relay, Reidpath helped the U.S. team set a world record of 3:16.6. In the 200 metres competition he finished fifth.

Reidpath was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army who served in England, France and Belgium in the Transportation Corps during World War II, winning battle stars for the Northern France and Rheinland campaigns. In Belgium, he was made Officer of the Crown for his services at the vital port of Antwerp in 1944 and 1945. Reidpath was made a Brigadier General when he retired from the New York National Guard in 1948. He is a member of the Lafayette High School Sports Hall of Fame.

Away from sports and the military, Reidpath worked for the Berdencer construction company from 1912 through 1937, when he was named director of buildings for Buffalo. For 15 years, he worked in the city Department of Public Works. In 1956, he helped build the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Buffalo Branch as superintendent of construction for architects.

He died in Kenmore, New York in 1975.

<text>The Sri Lankan wood pigeon or Ceylon wood pigeon (Columba torringtoniae) is a pigeon which is an endemic resident breeding bird in the mountains of Sri Lanka.

This species nests in damp evergreen woodlands in the central highlands, building a stick nest in a tree and laying a single white egg. Its flight is quick, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. Most of its food is vegetable. Normally silent it utters an owl-like &quot;hoo&quot; call in the breeding season.

The Sri Lanka wood pigeon is 36 cm in length. Its upperparts and tail are dark grey, and the head and underparts are lilac, becoming paler on the belly. There is a black-and-white chessboard pattern on the nape.

This pigeon can be quite easily seen in the woods of the Horton Plains National Park.

==Range and distribution==
The Sri Lanka wood pigeon is endemic to the island of Sri Lanka, where it is found in primary montane forest, generally above .

==In culture==

<doc id="603828" wikidata="Q339165" url="?curid=603828" title="K-1">
<text>K-1 is a professional kickboxing promotion established in 1993 by karateka Kazuyoshi Ishii.

Originally under the ownership of the Fighting and Entertainment Group (FEG), K-1 was considered to be the largest Kickboxing organization in the world. The organization was known for its heavyweight division fights and Grand Prix tournaments. K-1 also promoted mixed martial arts events, with some events having both kickboxing and MMA matches on their cards (such as their Dynamite!! series). The promotion has also held several tournaments under K-2 and K-3 banners from 1993 to 1995.

FEG would later face financial issues in the 2010s, and eventually went bankrupt in 2012. That same year, K-1 Global Holdings Limited, a company registered in Hong Kong, acquired the rights to K-1. In 2023, global rights to the K-1 brand were acquired by M-1 Sports Media.

The letter K in K-1 is officially designated as a representation of words karate, kickboxing and kung fu. Nevertheless, some reports suggest that it represents the initial K found in competing disciplines such as karate, kickboxing, kung fu, kempo, &quot;kakutougi&quot; (the generic Japanese term for &quot;combat sports&quot;), and taekwondo. Another theory claims that the K simply comes from &quot;kakutougi&quot; and the &quot;1&quot; component pertains to the single weight division (in earlier competition) and the champion&#x27;s unique position.

K-1 has its own unique ruleset different from other styles of Kickboxing. Because it has become so popular, K-1 is also seen as its own style of kickboxing and sometimes is erroneously considered as a standalone martial art/combat sport. Kickboxing governing bodies such as the ISKA and WKN have also crowned their own &quot;K-1 rules&quot; champions.

==History==
===Early years===
K-1&#x27;s predecessor, Seidokaikan karate, was formed in 1980 by Kazuyoshi Ishii, a former Kyokushin karate practitioner who had formed his own organization to help promote the best stand-up martial artists. Seidokaikan arranged several successful challenge events against other martial arts organizations, originally using rules based on the Kyokushin Knockdown karate rules, but gradually adapting and changing closer to kickboxing rules. In 1993, Mr. Ishii founded the K-1 exclusively as a kickboxing organization, closely cooperating with, but independent from Seidokaikan.

In 2010, rumours began to surface regarding financial issues with K-1, and parent company FEG. Simon Rutz, the owner of the Dutch-based kickboxing promotion It&#x27;s Showtime, claimed in January 2011 that some fighters from It&#x27;s Showtime had not been paid for fights in K-1.

In early 2011, FEG publicly announced that they were facing financial problems and that the organization would take some months off to restructure. Many fighters and managers spoke out against FEG, due to unpaid fight purses, as well as objections to the direction that its owner was taking K-1.

The entire K-1 brand, along with most of its trademarks, with the exception of, &#x27;K-1 Koshien&#x27;, &#x27;K-1 MAX&#x27; and &#x27;Dream&#x27;, were sold to Japanese real estate firm, Barbizon Corporation Limited, on July 28, 2011.

===Acquisition and restructuring (2012–2023)===
On February 1, 2012, EMCOM Entertainment Inc. purchased K-1 from Barbizon. In March 2012, It&#x27;s Showtime announced that EMCOM Entertainment established a new company K-1 Global Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong. K-1 Global Holdings, Ltd., became the new official owner of the K-1 brand. K-1 Global&#x27;s agreement with promotion required that certain fighters signed under It&#x27;s Showtime appear in upcoming K-1 Global events.

The K-1 World MAX Final 16 took place on May 27, 2012, at the Palacio Vistalegre in Madrid, Spain. After the event, controversy and rumors circulated over fighters not being paid for their performances, unpaid financial obligations of FEG, and the incomplete transfer of ownership of the K-1 name. As a result, the K-1 World Grand Prix scheduled for 2012 would be cancelled if these issues were not resolved. The chairman of the new K-1 resolved these issues by paying fighters what was owed and including a 50% bonus.

It was announced in June 2012 that It&#x27;s Showtime was purchased by Glory Sports International, eventually to be merged in their new promotion GLORY.

On August 10, 2012, K-1&#x27;s co-promotion agreement with Romanian-based kickboxing promotion SUPERKOMBAT was announced. Though the agreement would eventually end, SK president Eduard Irimia stated that while its company will be independent in 2013 it will still continue to have cooperation with any interested promotion, including K-1, by offering fighters.

====K-1 World GP Japan====
On May 29, 2014, the launch of a &quot;K-1 World League&quot; in Japan was announced. It is considered to be a separate entity from the K-1 of 2012, with the World League acquiring naming rights and exclusive license for the Japanese region from K-1 Global Holding Ltd. &quot;K-1 World League&quot; would focus on fighters in the 55 kg, -60 kg, -65 kg, -70 kg and heavyweight weight classes; and would be structured around professional events, amateur competitions and K-1 gyms. M-1 Sports Media is in charge of planning and production. &quot;K-1 World League&quot; was subsequently renamed K-1 World GP on September 24, 2014.

After its formation, &quot;K-1 World League&quot; formally incorporated the Krush brand. Launched prior to the folding of FEG, in 2009, Krush was a collaboration between K-1 and AJKF. It was seen at the time as the second tier of K-1 competition, and produced a number of future K-1 fighters such as Takeru Segawa, Tatsuya Tsubakihara and Leona Pettas, among others. K-1 would later add the KHAOS brand, which is seen as the third tier of competition, as a stepping stone between amateur and professional competition. K-1 maintains a number of gyms throughout Japan, from which potential kickboxers can transition from training to amateur competition to professional competition. A fighter can viably spend their entire career under the K-1 umbrella.

On September 20, 2016, &quot;K-1 World GP&quot; executive producer Kensaku Maeda retired, and was subsequently replaced by the Krush executive producer Mitsuru Miyata.

From June 2017 onward, &quot;K-1 World GP&quot; started once again started holding events at the Saitama Super Arena. It was further revealed that fighters were signed exclusively to K-1, which wasn&#x27;t the case previously.

On December 17, 2018, it was announced that the former Krush and K-1 commentator and martial arts writer Takumi Nakamura would replace Mitsuru Miyata as the executive producer.

On January 26, 2019, Krush was renamed &quot;K-1 KRUSH FIGHT&quot; to further announce the connection between the two brands. However, on December 7, 2019, it was renamed back to Krush. The aim of renaming the competition back to Krush was to dispel the image of the brand as the second tier of K-1.

===2023–present===
On February 10, 2023, K-1 agreed on a mutual exchange of fighters with fellow Japanese promotion RISE, after they successfully co-promoted the Tenshin Nasukawa vs. Takeru crossover pay-per-view event, known as &quot;THE MATCH 2022&quot;.

On February 28, 2023, M-1 Sports Media acquired the global licensing rights for the K-1 brand, which was from that point forward managed by K-1 International Federation (KIF).

On July 17, 2023, Takumi Nakamura stepped down stepped down from the position of producer.

Former Glory Japan General Manager Carlos Kikuta was announced as the new K-1 producer on July 18, 2023. That same day, K-1 announced a collaborative event with Quintet called ReBOOT, which will be held on September 10, 2023. The promotion subsequently announced their intention to re-brand their weight classes (under the &quot;K-1 WORLD GP&quot; and &quot;K-1 WORLD MAX&quot; banners, for heavyweights and fighters weighting -75 kg and under, respectively), that they would hold a heavyweight World Grand Prix, as well as a new partnership with Kyokushinkaikan.

On August 8, 2023, former executive producer Mitsuru Miyata was appointed as the Krush producer. On January 19, 2024, Kazuyoshi Ishii was appointed as an advisor.

==Rules==
K-1 rules are as follows:

* The fights are contested in a ring which is six or more meters square and surrounded by four ropes.
* Only striking techniques such as punches, sweeps, kicks and knees are allowed. Clinching is allowed (Only for 5 seconds)
* Throws, headbutts, any grabbing of the opponent and strikes with the elbow are prohibited. Furthermore, spitting, biting, groin strikes, strikes to the back of the head, striking after the round has ended or the referee has called for a break, striking while the opponent is knocked down and excessive holding are all considered fouls.
*Matches, both regular and title matches, are contested in three three-minute rounds. In case of a draw, an extension round is fought.
*If a fighter is knocked down during the fight, the referee will begin counting to eight until the fighter rises from the canvas. The referee can interrupt the count, or forgo it completely, if he deems the fighter unable to continue competing. Should the fighter remain downed by the time the referee has counted to eight, he is ruled as knocked out and the other fighter will be ruled the winner by knockout.
*Matches are scored based on four criteria: 
**(1) Number of knockdowns a fighter has scored, with three knockdowns inside of a single round resulting in a technical knockout (two in tournament bouts)
**(2) Presence or absence of damage to the opponent
**(3) The number clean strikes, with strikes which are thrown with fight ending intention scoring more highly than those thrown with the intent of racking up points
**(4) Aggressiveness

==List of K-1 events==
While under the FEG ownership, K-1 events were centred around the K-1 World Grand Prix, including qualifying tournaments and preliminaries held around the world.

==Tournament format==


===K-1 Grand Prix===

The original K-1 Grand Prix is a single-event tournament held in Japan where competitors participated on invitation. By 1998, K-1 introduced the K-1 World Grand Prix format composed of K-1 Regional Elimination Tournaments (theoretically amounting to six), which qualify fighters for the K-1 World Grand Prix Final, along with licensed K-1 Fighting Network events designed to hold national preliminaries for regional qualification.

K-1&#x27;s popularity differs greatly among six K-1 regions, which may limit the number of actual elimination tournaments or change locations. K-1 attempted to gain popularity in the United States by holding two GPs, however only a few Americans have ever qualified for the Finals. In 2006, one of the American GPs was relocated to Auckland. Additionally the K-1 Paris GP lost its qualifying right in favor of Amsterdam. Eventually, Amsterdam would lose it in favor of Łódź, and then Łódź in favor of Bucharest.

K-1 World Grand Prix Final Eliminator (&quot;Final 16&quot;) is an event where 16 participants compete for the final eight spots in the Final (&quot;Final 8&quot;). Eight participants from the Final Eliminator meet at the K-1 World Grand Prix Final. Other elements of the tournament format would be modified over the years. The final was held at Tokyo Dome from 1997 to 2006.

===K-1 World MAX and others===
By 2002, K-1 started the K-1 World MAX (&quot;Middleweight Artistic Xtreme&quot;) tournament for 70 kg (154 lb) Middleweight division, following a similar scheme to K-1 World Grand Prix (with theoretically four regional eliminators). In 2007, K-1 introduced two new title belts separate from K-1 World GP Champions, Super Heavyweight World Title for fighters over 100 kg/220 lbs and Heavyweight World Title for fighters under 100 kg/156–220 lbs.

==Broadcast==
K-1 events have been shown on the Tokyo Broadcasting System and Fuji TV during FEG ownership. Following the reformation of K-1 under the &quot;K-1 World League&quot; &amp; &quot;K-1 World GP&quot; banners, events would air through other broadcasters such as GAORA SPORTS, BS Sky PerfecTV! and TV Tokyo. 

K-1 events are currently broadcast through streaming service Abema TV domestically in Japan. The promotion regularly uploads full fights, press conferences, and general media to its global YouTube channel.

On August 30, 2023, it was announced that DAZN would begin distributing future K-1 events in 200 countries, beginning with the ReBOOT～K-1 ReBIRTH～ event on September 10.

<text>Foolad Mobarakeh Sepahan Sport Club (, &quot;Bâšgâh-e Farhangi-Varzeši-ye Fulâd-e Mobârake-ye Sepâhân&quot;), commonly known as Sepahan, is an Iranian sports club based in Isfahan. It is best known for their football section that play in the Persian Gulf Pro League, the highest tier of Iranian football league system.

In the 2002–03 season, Sepahan ended the total dominance of two Tehran-based clubs, Persepolis and Esteghlal, to win the Pro League. They are also the first Iranian club to win three consecutive league titles, reach the AFC Champions League final in 2007 and qualify for the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup, becoming the first-ever Iranian representative to the tournament. To date, they have won five league titles and four Hazfi Cups, becoming one of the most successful football clubs in Iran.

==Club history==
===Before the revolution===

In 1953, with the help of Iran national football team player Mahmoud Hariri the Shahin Isfahan football club was created. This club was one of the teams attached to the more popular and successful Shahin F.C. of Tehran. In 1963, Shahin as the representative of Isfahan Province became champions of Iran after a 1–1 draw against &quot;Tehran XI&quot;. In 1967, due to the problems that arose in the Shahin F.C. organization in Tehran, the Isfahan branch was forced to cease operations. The club changed its name to Sepahan. The club participated in the Takht Jamshid Cup league from 1974 to 1978. In the club&#x27;s first season in the Takht Jamshid Cup they finished in 10th place ahead of city rivals Zob Ahan.

===Post Revolution===
After the Revolution, they played in the local Isfahan leagues for many years until 1993. That year the club was purchased by the Siman-e-Sepahan (Sepahan Cement) factory of Isfahan. It participated in the Azadegan League until the year 2000, when Foolad Mobarekeh (Steel Mill of Mobarekeh Isfahan) bought the team from the Siman factory. The team now plays under the name of Foolad Mobarakeh Sepahan, and enjoys very good support by the club board, and has been able to attain a respectable fan base in its hometown.

===Success years===
The club was able to demonstrate its worth when it captured the league title in the 2002–03 season of the IPL, and qualified for the AFC Champions League tournament with Farhad Kazemi. It also won the Hazfi Cup in 2004 and was able to qualify for another season of the ACL competition, though the club did not have much success in the continental tournaments of ACL 2004 and 2005.
With Luka Bonačić, Sepahan was able to once again win the Hazfi Cup on 22 September 2006. With this win, they gained Iran&#x27;s final and second spot in the AFC Champions League 2007. They were impressive in continental stage as they finished top of their group and defeated Kawasaki Frontale of Japan and Al Wahda of the UAE to reach the final of the newly established continental tournament for the first time. Although they lost the final to Urawa Red Diamonds on aggregate, by reaching the final, Sepahan became the first Iranian club to qualify for the FIFA Club World Cup.

In the opening match of the FIFA Club World Cup 2007, Sepahan defeated Waitakere United of New Zealand to reach the quarter-final where they met Urawa Red Diamonds for a spot in the semifinal match against AC Milan. Urawa Reds managed to defeat Sepahan for the second time in just one month, reaching the semifinals of the FIFA Club World Cup.

By winning the Hazfi Cup once again in 2007, Sepahan also qualified for the AFC Champions League 2008, but could not repeat their success of 2007.

Sepahan has qualified for the AFC Champions League for the third consecutive time in 2009, coming as the Runners-up in Persian Gulf Cup 2007-08. Sepahan lost the title by only one point to Persepolis F.C., who beat them 2–1 in the last match of the season with a winner six minutes into second half injury time. They tried to improve the team by sacking the Brazilian coach Viera and replacing him with the German coach Firat but they had a difficult season where they could not win anything in the 2008–09 season and changed the coach three times.

In the next season Sepahan hired Turkish and former Iran&#x27;s assistant coach Engin Firat, but he was fired after getting poor result in the league, and Hossein Charkhabi who was Sepahan Novin head coach at that time replaced Firat. Despite getting good result with the team Charkahbi was replaced once again with Farhad Kazemi who won the league title with Sepahan in the 2002–03 season. Finally Sepahan finished 4th in the league and qualified for the 2010 AFC Champions League Group stage. In the next season the club hired former Iran and Esteghlal head coach Amir Ghalenoei, at the helm of Sepahan&#x27;s 2010 Season, the club sealed a championship title two weeks before the end of the season with a 2–2 tie against F.C. Aboomoslem.

In the 2010–11 Persian Gulf Cup, Sepahan dominated the league after a slow start and practically won the title two weeks before the season end. They also advanced to the knock out stage of the ACL competition, after finishing on top of the table in the group stage. Their group was arguably the group of death, consisting of Al-Hilal, Al Gharafa and Al-Jazira. They won their third championship and became the most successful team in Iran Pro League.

====Kranjčar Era====
They also repeated their league title in 2011–12 season, this time with Croatian manager, Zlatko Kranjčar. Sepahan also made it to the quarter-finals of 2012 AFC Champions League after defeating the fellow Iranian club Esteghlal.

In 2013 however, Sepahan was placed in Group C of the 2013 AFC Champions League and was unable to get past the 2013 AFC Champions League group stage. Being placed in the same group as Al-Gharafa Sports Club of Qatar, Al-Ahli SC of Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates&#x27; Al Nasr SC, they could not qualify as one of the top two teams of their group. Sepahan started the 2013 AFC Champions League with a great win at home against Al Nasr SC, however heading for an away game against Al-Gharafa Sports Club in Qatar, Sepahan only returned home humiliated by the Qatari team in a 3–1 lost game. That was not the end of Sepahan&#x27;s poor performance in the AFC Champions League. About three weeks after their loss in Qatar, Sepahan hosted Al-Ahli SC at Foolad Shahr Stadium, losing poorly once again but this time with a score of 4–2. Sepahan still had a chance after those two losses, but all hopes were lost once they lost in front of the Saudi giants again, this time with a score of 4–1 thus having them bid farewell to the 2013 AFC Champions League.
In the 2013–14 Iran Pro League season, Sepahan finished 4th, thus missing out on the AFC Champions League for the first time in five years. At the end of the season, Croatian manager Zlatko Kranjčar announced that he would not be returning for the 2014–2015 season. Sepahan also struggled in the Champions League as well, failing to make it past the group stage with a 1–0 loss to Al Hilal on the final match day. After originally announcing he was leaving the club, Sepahan announced that they had extended the contract of Kranjčar for another season.

====Faraki years====
Sepahan started the 2014–15 season with three wins in a row. However, Sepahan did not win their next four matches. Kranjčar resigned on 8 September 2014 and was replaced with former Foolad manager Hossein Faraki.

On 15 May 2015, with a 2–0 Sepahan victory over Saipa and Tractor drawing 3–3 with Naft Tehran, Sepahan won their fifth league title with a one-point margin over runner up Tractor. With the league victory, Sepahan returned to the AFC Champions League after a one-year absence.

On 12 November 2015 Hossein Faraki left Sepahan for personal problems. Faraki left by saying &quot;Things just don&#x27;t seem to be working out for me and I decided to quit my job in the team, I have nothing more to say because I think Sepahan needs concentration at the moment since they will play in Iran&#x27;s Hazfi Cup on Thursday,&quot;

===Štimac and Veisi years===
After Hossein Faraki&#x27;s resignation, the club signed former Croatia national team manager Igor Štimac. Igor Štimac won his first game against Naft Tehran, but after not winning a game in 10 weeks made the situations harder for Sepahan. Sepahan got knocked out of the Hazfi Cup by their rivals, Zob Ahan in penalties at the semi-final. Sepahan also went out of the AFC Champions League after losing five times in the first round. Igor Štimac resigned as Sepahan head coach on 20 April 2016, after a run of unsuccessful results which led the league champions Sepahan to end up in 11th place and out of both season&#x27;s cups, Hazfi Cup and AFC Champions League.

Before the start of the 2016–17 season, Abdollah Veisi who had led Esteghlal Khuzestan to the league title, was announced as the new manager of Sepahan but sepahans poor results continued so they announced Zlatko Kranjčar as their new manager. Sepahan finished the season in the 5th place.

==Reserve team==

Sepahan is also one of the clubs in Iranian football to have a senior reserve team, Foolad Sepahan Novin F.C., that as of the 2007/08 season, participates in 3rd Division and the Hazfi Cup. The reserve team was promoted to the Iran Pro League from the Azadegan League, but was not allowed to participate due to Fifa&#x27;s regulations about two teams from the same club playing in the same league.

==Rivalries==

===Isfahan Derby===

The Nagsh-e Jahan derby is a football match played annually in Isfahan, Iran, between the two rival professional teams of the city: Zob Ahan F.C. and Sepahan. Naqsh-e Jahan is an important square in old centrum of Isfahan. The competition is one of the most popular annual football events in Iran. The Isfahan derby goes back to the 1970s, when Zob Ahan F.C. and Sepahan F.C. faced each other in Takht Jamshid Cup seasons (1974/75, 1975/76, 1976/77, 1977/78). Their rivalry resumed in the 1990s when they faced each other in
Azadegan League seasons (1993/94, 1996/97, 1997/98) and from then on the two met each other twice a year.

===Tehran rivalries===
Esteghlal–Sepahan and Persepolis–Sepahan rivalries are the two important Iran Football Rivalries played between Sepahan and two Tehran based football clubs: Esteghlal and Persepolis.

==FIFA Club World Cup==
One of the most important titles of Sepahan football club, which makes this club a special club in Iranian football, is the participation in the Club World Cup in 2007.
For the people of Isfahan and those interested in football, especially the fans of Sepahan and of course Iranian football, the second day of November is undoubtedly a reminder of the name of Sepahan. On the day when the club was born, Sepahan&#x27;s name was placed next to big teams such as AC Milan of Italy, Boca Juniors of Argentina, Pachuca of Mexico, Whiteacres United of New Zealand, Sahil Tunis and Urawa Red Diamonds of Japan. Until today, Sepahan is the first and last representative of Iranian football who has hoisted the Iranian flag in the Club World Cup.

==Partnerships==

On 28 January 2009, Sepahan and Lebanese club Ahed signed an informal partnership deal. The partnership was made official on 8 March 2021, involving training camps and friendly games between the two sides.

==Stadium==

The Naghsh-e-Jahan Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Isfahan, Iran that is home ground of Sepahan. It is currently used for football matches. The stadium was built in 2003 and holds 45,000 in a three-tier configuration.

<text>Wyndham Halswelle (30 May 1882 – 31 March 1915) was a British athlete. He won the controversial 400m race at the 1908 Summer Olympics, becoming the only athlete to win an Olympic title by a walkover.

Halswelle was also an infantry officer who served in the Second Boer War and World War I. He was killed by a sniper at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915.

==Early life==

Born in London to London-born, Edinburgh-trained artist Keeley Halswelle and Helen Marianna Elizabeth Gordon, he is nonetheless usually referred to as being Scottish, the nationality of his maternal grandfather, General Nathaniel J. Gordon. Wyndham Halswelle had a notable athletic career at Charterhouse School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before being commissioned into the Highland Light Infantry as a second lieutenant on 8 January 1901. Serving in South Africa in 1902 for the Second Boer War, Halswelle&#x27;s ability was recognised by Jimmy Curran, a coach and amateur athlete. Halswelle returned to his regiment in January 1903, and was with the 1st battalion as they left South Africa for Egypt the same month. It was Curran who persuaded Halswelle to take up athletics seriously when his regiment returned to Edinburgh in 1904.

==Domestic athletics==

In 1904 he was army champion for 880 yards, and in 1905 he won the Scottish and AAA 440 yard (402 m) titles. In the 1906 Athens Intercalated Olympics, he achieved a silver medal in the 400 metres and a bronze in the 800 metres. On his return, in a single afternoon in 1906 at the Scottish championships in Powderhall, he won the 100, 220, 440 and 880 yards races (91, 201, 402, 805 m), a feat that has not been matched since. His season was cut short by a leg injury in 1907, but he came back the following year to set a world record of 31.2 s for 300 yards (274 m) and a British record over 440 yards of 48.4 s that lasted over a quarter of a century until it was eventually broken by Godfrey Rampling. In 1908 he set a Scottish 300 yards record that lasted until 1961 when it was beaten by Menzies Campbell, then a Glasgow University student.

==1908 Summer Olympics==

In 1908 Summer Olympics, Halswelle reached the final of the 400 m with the fastest qualifying time (an Olympic record of 48.4 s). The 400 m was not run in lanes at this point. Halswelle was baulked by William Robbins in the first 50 m. Then, coming off the final bend, Robbins led John Carpenter by a yard, with Halswelle waiting to pass him in the last straight, as he had done to other athletes in the earlier rounds. Carpenter ran wide, forcing Halswelle to within eighteen inches of the outside of the track, using his right elbow to prevent Halswelle overtaking. British umpire Roscoe Badger observed that Carpenter manoeuvred so as to prevent Halswelle from passing him. While blocking competitors was an acceptable strategy in the United States, it was prohibited by the British rules under which the 1908 London Olympics were organised. Badger immediately signalled the judges to declare the race void. Pictures of the race indicate that Carpenter (intentionally or not) blocked Halswelle.

Carpenter was disqualified, and the race was ordered to be rerun in lanes two days later; however, the other two U.S. runners refused to race, so a reluctant Halswelle ran the race by himself to win the gold in a time of 50.2 s. It is the only occasion in Olympic history where the final was a walkover. As a result of the controversy, from the next Olympics in 1912 onwards all 400 metre races were run in lanes, and the International Amateur Athletic Federation was founded to establish uniform worldwide rules for athletics.

The controversy soured Halswelle&#x27;s view of athletics. He was also under pressure from his senior officers, who felt he was being exploited, and he retired from athletics after a farewell appearance at the 1908 Glasgow Rangers Sports.

==Death==
Halswelle, by then a captain, was killed by a sniper at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in France, during World War I, on 31 March 1915 aged 32 while attempting to rescue an injured fellow officer. Earlier in the same battle (12 March) he was hit by shrapnel or shell fragments while leading his men across an area known as Layes Brook but despite his wounds he refused to be evacuated and continued at the front, although heavily bandaged.

In the issue of the HLI regimental magazine that announced his death also appeared a piece he wrote days before it. It described a battle where 79 of his fellow soldiers died to gain 15 yards:
&quot;I called on the men to get over the parapet... There is great difficulty in getting out of a trench, especially for small men laden with a pack, rifle and perhaps 50 rounds in the pouch, and a bandolier of 50 rounds hung around them, and perhaps four feet of slippery clay perpendicular wall with sandbags on the top. I got about three men hit actually on top of the parapet. I made a dash at the parapet and fell back. The Jocks then heaved me up and I jumped into a ditch – an old trench filled with liquid mud – which took me some time to get out of.&quot;
His grave was marked with a wooden cross, with his name in charcoal. Later his remains were re-interred in the Royal Irish Rifles Graveyard at Laventie, near Armentières.

In 2003, he was posthumously inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame. His Olympic medals and other trophies are displayed there.

Halswelle&#x27;s regiment, now the Royal Highland Fusiliers, awards the Wyndham Halswelle Memorial Trophy to the winner of the 400m at the Scottish under-20 championships.

<text>The Persian Gulf Pro League (, &quot;Lig-e Bartar-e Xalij-e Fârs&quot;), formerly known as the Iran Premier League (, &quot;Lig-e bartar-e Irân&quot;), is the top men&#x27;s professional football division of the Iranian football league system. It is controlled by the FFIRI and is contested by 16 teams over a 30-matchday period.

Each year, its top team becomes the Iranian football champion, and the two lowest finishers are relegated to Azadegan League.

Since 2013, the league comprises 16 teams. The winner of the Persian Gulf Pro League along with the Hazfi Cup champion automatically qualify for the AFC Champions League Elite group stages. The third of the Persian Gulf Pro League is qualified for the AFC Champions League Elite Play-off round. The bottom two teams in the league are relegated to Azadegan League. In the past, the format and number of teams were changed for various times.

==History==
To the turn of the millennium the Iranian Football Federation decided to create a new professional football league. In 2001, the &quot;Iran Pro League&quot; was founded as the new top-level football league in Iran. After the Iran Pro League was established as the professional football league of Iran, Azadegan League was declared as the second-highest league in the Iranian football league system. The Iran Pro League comprised 14 clubs until the 2003–04 season.

The first winner of the Iran Pro League was Persepolis, who beat Esteghlal by one point on the final match day. Esteghlal Rasht and East Azerbaijan&#x27;s club Tractor had been relegated to the Azadegan League. Tractor took eight years to return to Iran&#x27;s highest division

The runner-up of the 2002–03 season, PAS Tehran, became the Iranian football champion of the 2003–04 Iran Pro League. It was the last Iranian championship for PAS Tehran. PAS Tehran&#x27;s professional football team was dissolved in 2007.

In 2004, the number of teams was increased from 14 to 16 teams. Foolad of Ahvaz became the first champion from Khuzestan Province. In the 2005–06 Iran Pro League Esteghlal celebrated their first championship since 2001. Shamoushak Noshahr and Shahid Ghandi (today known as Tarbiat Yazd) relegated to Azadegan League.

===Persian Gulf Cup===

On 12 August 2006, the Iranian Football Federation decided to give the league another name. Since then, the league had been primarily known in Iran as &quot;Persian Gulf Cup&quot; (PGC). The Football Federation decided this to promote the Persian naming. The name of the Persian Gulf has been disputed by some Arab countries since the 1960s due to political and ethnic differences between Iran and Arab countries. The football Federation decided also to change the logo of the league. The final logo was selected from over 130 designs and unveiled on 14 November 2006. Saipa won the 2006–07 Persian Gulf Cup. Until 2007, six different teams won the league title successively. A foreign player became the league&#x27;s top goal scorer. Nigerian striker Daniel Olerum scored 17 goals in 27 matches for Aboomoslem. The winner of only two seasons before, Foolad, had to relegated to Azadegan League.
Before the start of the 2007–08 season the number of teams was increased from 16 to 18 teams. The professional football team of PAS Tehran was also dissolved before the start of the season. Instead of PAS Tehran a new club was founded in Hamadan and named PAS Hamedan. In 2008, Saba Battery was also moved from Tehran to Qom. Since then, the club is known as Saba Qom. The championship of the 2007–08 season was decided on the last matchday. Persepolis defeated Sepahan. Sanat Naft and Shirin Faraz (today known as Rahian Kermanshah) relegated to Azadegan League. The next season was dominated by Esteghlal and the two surprising teams Zob Ahan and Mes Kerman. Zob Ahan was the leading team after 75 minutes on matchday 34, before they lost their match against Foolad due to three conceded goals in the last 15 minutes with 1–4. Payam Mashhad had to relegated alongside Bargh Shiraz and Damash.

The 2009–10 Persian Gulf Cup was dominated by the two Isfahan based clubs Sepahan and Zob Ahan. Ultimately Sepahan won the league. Sepahan repeated their success by winning the 2010–11 and 2011–12 Persian Gulf Cup. Esteghlal won the 2012–13 Persian Gulf Cup and became for the eight time in their history the Iranian champion.

The League was scaled down from 18 to 16 teams before the beginning of the next season. Foolad won the 2013–14 Persian Gulf Cup. Foolad saved their championship after they defeated Gostaresh Foulad away .

===Persian Gulf Pro League===

The league changed its name from &quot;Persian Gulf Cup&quot; to &quot;Persian Gulf Pro League&quot; in 2014. The Iranian Football Federation decided also to change the logos of the Persian Gulf Pro League and of the Azadegan League. The 2014–15 Persian Gulf Pro League was embossed by a championship battle between Sepahan, Tractor and Naft Tehran. Furthermore, there were strange events in the stadium, including a lot of misinformation and disturbed telecommunication. Although Sepahan secured their title with a 2–0 victory over Saipa, thousands of Tractor supporters celebrated on the pitch, believing that they won the league for the first time in club&#x27;s history.

Also the 2015–16 Persian Gulf Pro League was not decided until the last matchday. Esteghlal Khuzestan won the league in front of Persepolis and Esteghlal. Persepolis missed their opportunity winning the league after eight years. However, Persepolis dominated the next season and won the 2016–17 Persian Gulf Pro League. Persepolis football team claimed the Iran Professional League (IPL) and repeated the title in 2017-18 Season. The Following Season Persepolis again were champion for three times in a row.

==Format==
In the past, the number of teams was changed at various times. Since 2013, the league comprises 16 teams. Over the course of a season, which runs annually from July to the following May, each team plays twice against the others in the league, once at home and once away, resulting in each team competing in 30 games in total. Three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw and zero for a loss. The teams are ranked in the league table by points gained, then goal difference, then goals scored and then their head-to-head record for that season.

At the end of the season, the club with the most points becomes the Iranian champion. Currently, the Champions, the Runners Up and the Hazfi Cup champions qualify automatically for the group phase of the AFC Champions League, while the third-place team enters the AFC Champions League at the Play-off round. The bottom two teams are relegated to Azadegan League. Furthermore, all teams in the Persian Gulf Pro League can participate in the Hazfi Cup.

<text>The Four Heavenly Kings are four Buddhist gods or &quot;devas&quot;, each of whom is believed to watch over one cardinal direction of the world. The Hall of Four Heavenly Kings is a standard component of Chinese Buddhist temples.

==Names==
The Kings are collectively named as follows:
Individually, they have different names and features.


==Mythology==
All four Kings serve , the lord of the devas of . On the 8th, 14th and 15th days of each lunar month, the Kings either send out emissaries or go themselves to inspect the state of virtue and morality in the world of men. Then they report their findings to the assembly of the devas.

On the orders of Śakra, the Kings and their retinues stand guard to protect from another attack by the Asuras, which once threatened to destroy the realm of the devas. They also vowed to protect the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Buddha&#x27;s followers from danger. In Chinese Buddhism, all four of the heavenly kings are regarded as four of the &quot;Twenty Devas&quot; (二十諸天 Èrshí Zhūtiān) or the &quot;Twenty-Four Devas&quot; (二十四諸天 Èrshísì zhūtiān), a group of Buddhist dharmapalas who manifest to protect the Dharma.

According to Vasubandhu, devas born in the Cāturmahārājika heaven are 1/4 of a krośa in height (about 750 feet tall). They have a five-hundred-year lifespan, of which each day is equivalent to 50 years in our world; thus their total lifespan amounts to about nine million years (other sources say 90,000 years).
The attributes borne by each King also link them to their followers; for instance, the nāgas, magical creatures who can change form between human and serpent, are led by , represented by a snake; the gandharvas are celestial musicians, led by , represented with a lute. The umbrella was a symbol of regal sovereignty in ancient India, and the sword is a symbol of martial prowess. &#x27;s mongoose, which ejects jewels from its mouth, is said to represent generosity in opposition to greed.

<text>Charles Dwight Sigsbee (January 16, 1845 – July 13, 1923) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy. In his earlier career, he was a pioneering oceanographer and hydrographer. He is best remembered as the captain of , which exploded in Havana Harbor, Cuba, in 1898 and set off the events that led up to the start of the Spanish–American War. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1899.

==Early life==
Sigsbee was born in Albany, New York, and educated at The Albany Academy. He was appointed acting midshipman on 16 July 1862.

==Military career==
Sigsbee fought in numerous engagements during the American Civil War, mostly against Confederate forts and batteries. Sigsbee served aboard , , and from 1863 to 1869, when he was assigned to duty at the Naval Academy. In 1871, he was assigned to the Hydrographic Office. He was first posted to the Hydrographic Office in 1873. He was assigned to the Coast Survey in 1874 and commanded the Coast Survey steamer &quot;Blake&quot; from 1875 to 1878. He returned to the Navy Hydrographic Office from 1878 to 1882 and served as hydrographer in the Bureau of Navigation from 1893 to 1897. During his period on &quot;Blake&quot;, he developed the Sigsbee sounding machine, which became a standard item of deep-water oceanographic equipment for the next 50 years.

Sigsbee served at the Naval Academy from 1869 to 1871, from 1882 to 1885, and from 1887 to 1890. He served on the Board of Control for the United States Naval Institute. He commanded on the European station from 1885 to 1886 and the training ship &quot;Portsmouth&quot; from 1891 to 1892.

Sigsbee took command of the armored cruiser &quot;Maine&quot; in April 1897. After &quot;Maine&quot; was destroyed in February 1898, Sigsbee and his officers were exonerated by a court of inquiry. He then commanded in 1898 at the Second Battle of San Juan and until 1900.

In February, he was appointed Chief Intelligence Officer of the Office of Naval Intelligence, succeeding Commander Richardson Clover. He held that post until April 1903 when he was succeeded by Commander Seaton Schroeder. He was promoted to rear admiral on 10 August 1903.

He assumed command of the South Atlantic Squadron in 1904 and the Second Division, North Atlantic Squadron, in 1905.

He commanded as his flagship on June 7, 1905, which sailed for Cherbourg, France. There, the remains of the late John Paul Jones were taken aboard and brought home for his interment at the United States Naval Academy.

==Death and legacy==
Sigsbee retired from the Navy in 1907 and died in New York, 1923. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His grandson, Charles Dwight Sigsbee III, First Lieutenant, US Army, was buried next to him on July 10, 1956.

Conscious of his legacy, Sigsbee penned a book giving the history of the &quot;Maine&quot; and his experiences aboard her. The book was entitled &quot;The MAINE - An Account of Her Destruction in Havana Harbor&quot; and was published by the Century Company of New York in 1899.

His daughter Mary Ellen Sigsbee (1877–1960) was an artist, socialist and feminist.

He has several namesakes:
* The destroyer was named for him.
* Sigsbee Park, the primary military family housing area for Naval Air Station Key West, and the collocated Sigsbee Elementary School are named in his honor.
* Sigsbee Deep, the deepest part of the Gulf of Mexico, was discovered by ships under his command and was named in his honor.
* On May 25, 1898, Daniel Bevill was appointed postmaster of a new post office in Shelby County, Missouri, but needed a name for the office. Bevill had so admired Sigsbee, a naval officer in command of the battleship &quot;Maine&quot;, which blew up in Havana Harbor in 1898, that he named the post office site as Sigsbee (Shelby County Historical Society records).

==Ranks held==

* Midshipman – September 27, 1859
* Passed Midshipman – 1863
* Master – May 10, 1866
* Commodore - Jan 4, 1867

<text>Mona Ingeborg Sahlin (; ; born 9 March 1957) is a Swedish politician who was leader of the opposition and leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party from 2007 to 2011.

Sahlin was a Member of Parliament, representing Stockholm County, from 1982 to 1996 and again from 2002 to 2011. She has also held ministerial posts in the Swedish government from 1990 to 1991, from 1994 to 1995 and from 1998 to 2006. Sahlin was elected as leader of the Social Democratic Party on 17 March 2007, succeeding Göran Persson who resigned as leader following the defeat in the 2006 general election. Sahlin is the first female leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party and became in 2011 the first since Claes Tholin in 1907 to leave that position without having served as Prime Minister of Sweden. In 2012, her successor Håkan Juholt joined her as the second now living person to do so. On 14 November 2010, following another electoral defeat for the Social Democrats, she announced her intent to step down as party chairman, which she did in early 2011.

== Youth and education ==
Sahlin was born Mona Ingeborg Andersson in Sollefteå, Västernorrland County, Sweden. Her father, Hans Andersson, worked at youth care schools community homes. In the mid-1960s, the family moved to Järla in Stockholm County where they remained. Her father later became an advisor to former Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson.

In 1964, at the age of seven, Sahlin founded the Swedish &quot;Barbie Club&quot;. During her childhood, she also enjoyed soccer and music. Sahlin performed as one of the back up singers to Jan Malmsjö, in the selection for the song to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 1969. The song was written by Benny Andersson and Lasse Berghagen and it came in second place.

Sahlin was educated at Nacka Samskola and Södra Latin in Stockholm and completed secondary school in 1977. From 1976 to 1977, she was vice chairperson of the Swedish Pupils&#x27; Association. Thereafter she worked at a private company and later as a trade union representative for the Swedish National Union of State Employees.

== Political career ==

At age 13, Sahlin joined the Swedish support group for the Viet Cong. Sahlin&#x27;s political career began in the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League in Nacka, Stockholm County, in 1973, at the age of 16. This was during the Vietnam War, and already as a 13-year-old Sahlin had joined the Swedish FNL group.

In the Swedish general election of 1982, Sahlin was elected to the Riksdag as the youngest member of parliament at that time. In 1990, she became Minister for Employment, but after the Social Democrats lost power in the 1991 election, Sahlin began to serve as chairman of the Riksdag&#x27;s Committee on the Labour Market and as spokesman for the Social Democrats on labour market issues. From 1992 to 1994, she was party secretary. During this period, she openly criticized government reforms, particularly on social welfare and employees&#x27; rights, maintaining they needed to be reversed. She left her position to rejoin the government as Minister for Gender Equality and Deputy Prime Minister, when the Social Democrats regained power in the 1994 election.

In October 1995, the newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; following an investigation led by Christian Democratic Spanish-Swedish Public Auditor Carlos Medina de Rebolledo reported that Sahlin, who was then serving as Deputy Prime Minister and was widely seen as the main candidate to succeed Ingvar Carlsson as Prime Minister, had charged for private expenses on her working charge card, which was only for working expenses. At a news conference, she admitted that she had used a Government credit card to buy groceries. She further confessed to having failed to pay 19 parking tickets and several bills for her children&#x27;s day care on time. Later, she apologized in a Stockholm newspaper. A preliminary investigation was initiated by the chief prosecutor , as a result of the transactions, and was closed in early 1996 when it came to the conclusion that there was no infringement. She eventually paid the bills (along with an extra of , which was later returned) to the Treasury. The controversy was dubbed as the &quot;Toblerone affair&quot; due to the inclusion of Toblerone bars on the credit card statement.

=== Break from politics and return ===
From 1996 to 1997, Sahlin worked as a self-employed owner of a small company and as a television reporter. In 1997, she was elected chairman of the European Council Against Racism and in 1998 she became the head of the Social Democratic youth education school Bommersvik.

Sahlin returned to national politics in 1998 when then Prime Minister Göran Persson appointed her as Minister without Portfolio. She served first in the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communication from 1998 to 2002, then from 2002 to 2004 in the Ministry of Justice as the &quot;Minister for Democracy and Integration&quot;, and from 2004 to 2006 in the Ministry of Sustainable Development as the &quot;Minister for Sustainable Development&quot;. In 2004, she was the Social Democratic minister for integration of refugees and her public positions indicated an opposition to proposed restrictions on asylum seekers, arguing the all refugees entering Sweden must have the same rights and obligations.

=== Social Democratic Party leadership ===
After the Social Democratic defeat in the 2006 election, Göran Persson announced his retirement as party leader on the election night. Mona Sahlin was mentioned as a possible successor, but not considered to be the most likely candidate. Both Margot Wallström and Carin Jämtin received stronger support amongst local and regional party organisations. Ulrica Messing was also mentioned as a possible candidate. Wallström, Jämtin and Messing declared however that they would not stand for the post and instead supported Sahlin, leaving Mona Sahlin as the only serious candidate. On 18 January, she was officially asked by the party&#x27;s Election Committee to stand as party leader, and accepted. On 17 March, she was unanimously elected at the extra party congress in Stockholm.

In January 2007, support for the new centre-right government of Sweden had dropped greatly in the polls, which showed the left bloc (including the Green Party) as having much stronger support. This provided Mona Sahlin, as leader of the biggest opposition party, with excellent opportunities to lead the opposition against the PM Fredrik Reinfeldt. By April 2009, however, the support had waned and a Demoskop poll published in &quot;Expressen&quot; showed that the four-party Alliance claimed a combined 50 percent voter support while the Sahlin-led opposition had 45.2 percent. Later the same month a Sifo poll showed that merely 27 percent of Swedes were confident or extremely confident in her leadership ability, while the public confidence in Reinfeldt was measured at 60 percent.
Mona Sahlin is often described as a scion of the party&#x27;s more moderate members, and a number of left-wing party members criticised her candidacy for party leader. Much of this criticism was silenced in January 2007 when the chairman of the Trade Union Confederation, Wanja Lundby-Wedin, expressed full support for Sahlin as well as several powerful party districts around the country. One of her key initiatives was the formation of the Red-Green alliance between the Social Democrats and the Green Party to counter the move to pare back the social welfare system and privatize state-owned assets.

In the election to the European Parliament held on 7 June 2009 – Sahlin&#x27;s first election as party leader – the Social Democratic Party received 24.41 percent of the votes (a slight reduction from the 2004 election in which the party received 24.56 percent). The result was the lowest for the Social Democratic Party since the introduction of universal suffrage in Sweden in 1921. In a speech before trade unionists during the election campaign on 12 May 2009, Sahlin said: &quot;If there&#x27;s not a plus in front of our figures it&#x27;s a deep failure&quot;.

She led the Social Democratic Party in the election of September 2010 where she failed to unseat Fredrik Reinfeldt as Prime Minister. The Social Democrats received the lowest recorded percentage of the votes in their history but were still the largest party in Sweden by a slim margin in 2010. She resigned as party leader on 25 March 2011, becoming the second Social Democratic Party leader to have resigned without having served as prime minister.

Speaking in 2005 at a Swedish mosque, Sahlin said that &quot;many Swedes are envious of immigrants because they have a culture, a history, something that binds them together. Swedes have only Midsummer Night and such silly things.&quot; Karen Jespersen, a former Minister of Integration in Denmark, commented: Cultural self-denial cannot easily be more monstrous and ghastly.&quot; After the terrorist action in Brussels in March 2016, Sahlin, who was then serving as national coordinator against violent extremism, maintained in an op-ed that such atrocities were the fault not only of the terrorists themselves but of critics of Islam whose remarks in online chat rooms, in comments fields, and on social media &quot;give the extremists their nourishment.&quot; Commentator Jenny Sonesson called for her to be dismissed from her position, saying that she &quot;knows nothing about Islam.&quot; Writing in &quot;Expressen&quot;, Sakine Madon also criticized Sahlin for her refusal to address the reality of jihadism.

On 5 May 2016, Sahlin stepped down from her position as Sweden&#x27;s national coordinator against violence-embracing extremism, due to revelations by the newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; that she had lied about her bodyguard&#x27;s salary, in order to help him secure a mortgage. The bodyguard had a monthly salary of , but Mona Sahlin wrote a confirmation letter stating that he had a salary of . When confronted with the issue, she first made a false statement that she had paid the difference out of her own pocket, before retracting the statement after it was proven by &quot;Expressen&quot; to actually be false. The media mentioned similarities to the so-called Toblerone case of the 1990s when Sahlin was caught using her government credit card to pay for private expenses and then dodging the issue when confronted.

In November 2017, Sahlin was found guilty of tax evasion. In 2015, she had failed to declare 151,072 kronor in income from writing and lecturing, and in 2016 she had failed to declare . She was required to pay a fine of .

== Personal life ==

Mona Sahlin has one brother and two sisters. Her brother, Janne Andersson, is the former lead singer of the pop group Japop and owns his own production company. Her sister Lena Ridemar is the chief of staff at the Tenants&#x27; Association.

In 1982, she married Bo Sahlin, a politician who later became the CEO of the Social Democratic media company AiP Media Produktion AB in 2006. The couple have three children: Jenny (born 1983), Gustav (born 1989), and Johan who died after ten months as a result of heart failure. She also has a child named Ann-Sofie from a previous relationship with a man named David Peña.

<text>Clive Sheridan Ponting (13 April 1946 – 28 July 2020) was a senior British civil servant and historian. In 1984, he leaked classified documents about the sinking of the ARA &quot;General Belgrano&quot; in the Falklands War in 1982, which showed that government statements about the sinking were untrue. He was prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act, but argued that his actions were in the public interest, and was acquitted. At the time of his resignation from the civil service in 1985, he was a Grade 5 (assistant secretary), earning £23,000 per year (£70,214 in 2020).

He later wrote a number of books on British and world history. These included a &quot;Green History of the World&quot; (1991), which was revised as &quot;A New Green History of the World&quot; in 2007, and a biography of Winston Churchill (1994) and &quot;1940: Myth and Reality&quot; (1990).

==Early life==
Ponting was born in Bristol, the only child of Charles Ponting, who is thought to have worked in sales, and his wife, Winifred (née Wadham). He was educated at Bristol Grammar School and the University of Reading. He joined the civil service in 1970.

==Bureaucratic career==
===&quot;General Belgrano&quot; papers===
While a senior civil servant at the United Kingdom&#x27;s Ministry of Defence (MoD), Ponting sent two documents, subsequently nicknamed &quot;the crown jewels&quot;, to Labour MP Tam Dalyell in July 1984 concerning the sinking of the Argentine navy warship &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, a key incident in the 1982 Falklands War. After Ponting admitted revealing the information, the Ministry of Defence suspended him without pay. On 17 August 1984, he was charged with a criminal offence under Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911. The Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, had his pay reinstated once she had been briefed on what had happened. Ponting&#x27;s defence at the trial was that the matter and its disclosure to a Member of Parliament were in the public interest. It was the first case under the Official Secrets Act that involved giving information to Parliament. Although Ponting expected to be imprisoned, he was acquitted by the jury. The acquittal came despite the judge&#x27;s direction to the jury, and hence by definition a &quot;perverse verdict&quot;. The judge, Sir Anthony McCowan, &quot;had indicated that the jury should convict him&quot;, and had ruled that &quot;the public interest is what the government of the day says it is&quot;.

In 1985, Ponting came across the one file about Operation Cauldron—1952 secret biological warfare trials that had led to a trawler being accidentally doused with plague bacteria off the Hebrides—that had not been destroyed, and confidentially told &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper about it, leading to a story that July headlined &quot;British germ bomb sprayed trawler&quot;.

Ponting resigned from the civil service on 16 February 1985. In May 1987, he made an extended appearance on the first ever edition of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;After Dark&quot; discussion programme, alongside among others Colin Wallace, T. E. Utley and Peter Hain.

===Charges under the Official Secrets Act===
Shortly after his resignation, &quot;The Observer&quot; began to serialise Ponting&#x27;s book &quot;The Right to Know: The Inside Story of the Belgrano Affair&quot;. The Conservative government reacted by amending the secrets legislation and by introducing the Official Secrets Act 1989. Before the trial, a jury could take the view that if an action could be seen to be in the public interest, the right of the individual to take that action might be justified. As a result of the 1989 modification, that defence was removed. After the enactment, it was taken that public interest&#x27; is what the government of the day says it is&quot;.

The events of Ponting&#x27;s charge and trial were dramatized by Richard Monks on BBC Radio Four in May 2022.

==Academic career==
Following his resignation from the Civil Service, Ponting served as a reader in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Wales, Swansea, until his retirement in 2004. He was one of the pioneers of Big History.

His historical works have attracted attention from other academics, with scholar Paul Addison writing that &quot;Ponting writes well and the clarity with which he summarises the issues calls to mind a model civil servant briefing his minister. He swoops like a hawk on the damning quotation or the telling statistic.&quot; C. J. Coventry reviewed Ponting&#x27;s biography of Churchill, writing that &quot;Ponting shattered the Churchill illusion for his readers leaving them little to piece together, just marble shards on the floor of his looted temple&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ponting was married four times. In 1969, he married Katherine Hannan. After their divorce in 1973, he married Sally Fletcher, who also worked in the Ministry of Defence. Laura Young, a teacher, was his third wife, whom he married in 1997. His fourth wife, Diane Johnson, died in March 2020.

==Retirement==
In November 2018, by then a resident of Kelso, Scottish Borders, Ponting gave a speech in which he warned fellow Scottish National Party members that a No-deal Brexit would be used as context in which to disband or constrain the Scottish Parliament.

Ponting died at home on 28 July 2020, at the age of 74.

<doc id="603861" wikidata="Q828357" url="?curid=603861" title="Sunshine Coast, Queensland">
<text>The Sunshine Coast is a peri-urban region in South East Queensland, Australia. In 1967, it was defined as &quot;the area contained in the [former] Shires of Landsborough, Maroochy and Noosa, but excluding Bribie Island&quot;. Located north of the centre of Brisbane in South East Queensland, on the Coral Sea coastline, its urban area spans approximately of coastline and hinterland from Pelican Waters to Tewantin.

The area has several coastal hubs at Caloundra, Kawana Waters, Maroochydore and Noosa Heads. Nambour and Maleny have developed as primary commercial centres for the hinterland.

Since 2014, the Sunshine Coast district has been split into two local government areas, the Sunshine Coast Region and the Shire of Noosa, which administer the southern and northern parts of the Sunshine Coast respectively.

As of June 2021, with an estimated urban population of 398,840, the Sunshine Coast is the fifth most populated area in Queensland and the 9th most populous in the country. The population of the area has grown steadily at an average annual rate of 2.4% year-on-year over the five years to 2018.

==History==

The earliest residents of the Sunshine Coast were the indigenous Gubbi Gubbi and Wakka Wakka people. The territory of the Kabi includes about along the coastline from the 27th parallel northward to the mouth of the Burrum River. The country of the Wakka Wakka people was about that was roughly triangular to the west of the Kabi, including a small part of the Dawson, and meeting the northern Kabi boundary at Walla. The two tribes were friendly and intermarried and had the same class restrictions. The groups were nomadic, gathering food en-route as they moved from one campsite to the next.

Gubbi Gubbi (Kabi Kabi, Cabbee, Carbi, Gabi Gabi) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gubbi Gubbi country. The Gubbi Gubbi language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Sunshine Coast Region and Gympie Region, particularly the towns of Caloundra, Noosa Heads, Gympie and extending north towards Maryborough and south to Caboolture&quot;.&quot;


In 1770, James Cook on the deck of HM Bark &quot;Endeavour&quot; became the first known European to sight the Glass House Mountains, located south-west of Caloundra.

In the 1820s, former convicts John Finnegan, Thomas Pamphlett and Richard Parsons landed on Moreton Island after becoming hopelessly lost fetching cedar. They lived with the Kabi Kabi for eight months.

Thereafter, during the 1830s to 1840s, the district became home to numerous runaway convicts from the Moreton Bay (Brisbane) penal colony slightly to the south.

In 1842, Governor George Gipps had the entire Sunshine Coast and hinterland from Mt Beerwah north to roughly Eumundi declared a &quot;Bunya Bunya Reserve&quot; for the protection of the bunya tree after Andrew Petrie advised him of the importance of bunya groves in Aboriginal culture. However, during the 1840s and 1850s, the Bunya Bunya Reserve and its vicinity became the scene of some of the most bitter skirmishes of Australia&#x27;s &quot;Black War&quot;. The Blackall Range, on account of the tri-annual Bunya Festival, served as both a hideout and rallying point for attacks against white settlements. By the 1850s timber cutters and cattlemen had started exploiting the area; in 1860 the Bunya Bunya Reserve was scrapped.

Many of the Sunshine Coast&#x27;s towns began as simple ports or jetties for the timber industry during the 1860s and 1870s, as the area once had magnificent stands of forest. Likewise, the region&#x27;s roads often began as snigging tracks for hauling timber. Timber getters used the region&#x27;s creeks, rivers and lakes as seaways to float out their logs of cedar – the resultant wood being shipped as far afield as Europe.

During the Gympie Gold Rush (1867), prospectors scaled the Sunshine Coast mountains to develop easier roadways to and from the gold fields of Gympie. After the construction of the railway line to Gympie, the coastal and river towns, being mostly ports for the early river trade, were bypassed.

By the 1890s, diverse small farming (fruit and dairy) had replaced the cattle-and-timber economy of earlier decades. Sugar cane and pineapples proved especially important to produce for the district. Many small hamlets and towns now emerged. Produce was initially taken by horse to Landsborough, then to Eudlo in 1891.

The post-World War I era saw the rise of the &quot;seaside shack&quot;. The seaside shack provided the opportunity for the coastal &quot;getaway&quot; with modest investment. From 1914 to 1946, they popped up all along the North Coast (because it was north of Brisbane). Seaside shacks were exceedingly cheap and were an early use of the concept of recycling. Many were built of disused or second grade timber, all kinds of materials were used for the holiday seaside shack, including fibro cement, metal containers, and left-over farm sheds; even disused trams were sold off as seaside shacks.

Especially after World War II, the Sunshine Coast grew into a holiday and surfing destination. This tendency was further expanded in the development boom of the 1960s and 1970s.

Then known as the Near North Coast, the renaming of the South Coast to become the Gold Coast triggered interest in renaming the Near North Coast to increase the tourist appeal. Names considered included the Silver Coast, the Diamond Coast, and Suncoast. Suncoast was rejected as it was copyrighted by a proprietary company. In 1967, it was officially renamed the Sunshine Coast.

Around the same time, various tourist attractions and theme parks were created, such as the Big Pineapple in Woombye.

After the 1980s, the Sunshine Coast experienced rapid population growth. it had become one of the fastest-growing regions in Australia. As the region becomes increasingly residential, most of the district&#x27;s distinctive small farms – especially tropical-fruit and sugar-cane farms have disappeared, as have most of its theme parks. The Moreton sugar mills closure in 2003 removed a market for the district&#x27;s 120 cane growers who had been harvesting cane in the region. Instead, businesses concerned with retail, catering and tourism have assumed increasing importance.

In 2008, The Shire of Noosa, Shire of Maroochy and City of Caloundra merged to form the Sunshine Coast Region. The 2007 referendum conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission and leading to the merger remained controversial in Noosa Shire, where 95% of voters had rejected amalgamation.

In March 2013, a second referendum resulted in 81% of residents voted to leave the amalgamated Sunshine Coast Region. On 9 November 2013 an election resulted in Noel Playford being elected to take office as mayor on 1 January 2014 with the new council.

The Shire of Noosa was re-established on 1 January 2014. This resulted in two geopolitical areas occupying the area generally recognised as &#x27;The Sunshine Coast&#x27;. The Sunshine Coast Region, governed by the Sunshine Coast Council and the Shire of Noosa, governed by Noosa Shire Council.

==Geography==

Major rivers of the Sunshine Coast include Noosa River, Maroochy River, Mooloolah River and the Stanley River. The region includes several lakes such as Lake Cootharaba and Lake Weyba. Ewen Maddock Dam, Wappa Dam and Baroon Pocket Dam have been built for water storage.
===Beaches===
Several stretches of the Sunshine Coast are lined with unbroken beaches – from Sunshine Beach near Noosa to Coolum Beach (); the coast from Point Arkwright to Mudjimba (); the Maroochydore–Mooloolaba stretch (); and from Buddina past the Caloundra CBD to Pelican Waters ().

Noosa Main Beach, Alexandra Headland, Mooloolaba (the spit) and Coolum Beach are nationally recognised surfing beaches.
Notable beaches include:

* Sunshine Beach in Noosa
* Sunrise Beach in Noosa
* Castaways Beach in Noosa
* Marcus Beach in Noosa
* Peregian Beach in Noosa
* Marcoola, Maroochydore
* Mudjimba, Maroochydore
* Kawana Waters, between Maroochydore and Caloundra
* Dicky Beach in Caloundra
* Moffat Beach in Caloundra
* Shelly Beach in Caloundra
* Kings Beach in Caloundra
* Golden Beach in Caloundra

===National parks===
The Sunshine Coast is home to more individual national parks than any other region in Queensland. The natural biodiversity of the area has been protected by five separate parks in both coastal and inland regions, including Mapleton Falls National Park, Kondalilla National Park, The Glass House Mountains National Park, Noosa National Park, and the Great Sandy National Park, which includes sections on Fraser Island and in Cooloola near Rainbow Beach.

===Climate===
Sunshine Coast has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) typical of South Queensland. Summers are generally hot, but moderated compared to areas on similar latitudes elsewhere. Winters retain warm days, but have cooler nights rendering it falling into the subtropical fold. There is no dry season and precipitation is generally quite high.

The average temperature of the sea ranges from in August to in February at Mooloolaba, and from in August to in February at Noosa Heads.

==Economy==
The Sunshine Coast economy has outpaced most of the regional economies in Australia in terms of growth over the last 15 years. The strength of the regional economy is based in its diversity and strength across a number of key sectors including healthcare, education, finance and professional business services. Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data from the May 2019 Labour Force Survey indicate that around 184,200 people were employed in the Sunshine Coast region. Health care and social assistance was the largest employment sector with 26,800 people, followed by construction with 26,500 people, and education and training with 21,200 people. Other important employment sectors in the region were accommodation and food services; retail trade; and professional, scientific and technical services. The agriculture, forestry and fishing sector employed 2,600 people, representing 1 per cent of the region&#x27;s workforce.

===Tourism===
The Sunshine Coast is a centre for tourism, attracting more than 3.2 million visitors a year. There are significant attractions, such as Steve Irwin&#x27;s Australia Zoo, UnderWater World marine park, Aussie World with the Ettamogah Pub, the Buderim Ginger Factory, the Big Pineapple, the Eumundi Markets and the Majestic Theatre, Pomona.

Sports tourism is supported by several annual sporting events such as the Mooloolaba Triathlon, Noosa Triathlon and Sunshine Coast Marathon.

The Sunshine Coast is served by the Sunshine Coast Airport north of Maroochydore, though many tourists also arrive from Brisbane Airport which is to the south.

As of November 2020 the Sunshine Coast is home of NightQuarter, an Eat Street-style precinct with live music and other immersive experiences.

The Sunshine Coast region is home to many tour operators which are supported by welcomed 3.6 million domestic overnight visitors in the year ending September 2021. These visitors spent an estimated $2.7 billion in the region and help sustain local businesses.

===Agriculture===

In 2017–18, the gross value of agricultural production in the Sunshine Coast region was $217 million, which was 2 per cent of the total gross value of agricultural production in Queensland ($13 billion).

Agricultural land in the Sunshine Coast region occupies 1,100 square kilometres, or 36 per cent of the region. Areas classified as conservation and natural environments (nature conservation, protected areas and minimal use) occupy 880 square kilometres, or 29 per cent of the region. The most common land use by area is grazing native vegetation, which occupies 530 square kilometres or 17 per cent of the Sunshine Coast region.

The Sunshine Coast region has a diverse agricultural sector. The most important commodities in the region based on the gross value of agricultural production were poultry ($66 million), followed by strawberries ($35 million) and milk ($29 million). These commodities together contributed 60 per cent of the total value of agricultural production in the region.

== Demographics ==

<text>Lake Delton is a man-made freshwater lake in Sauk County in central Wisconsin. For much of 2008, it was a mostly empty lake basin after a portion of a county highway that forms part of the dike wall eroded on June 9, 2008, under the pressure of floods in the area. The resulting wash out caused the lake to empty into the Wisconsin River, leaving behind only rainwater pools and the flow from Dell Creek. By March 2009, major repairs to correct the problem were completed, and the lake was allowed to refill. Minor repairs were expected to continue after that time, but the lake is now completely refilled and has been usable since Memorial Day weekend of 2009.

The lake was formed in 1927 to attract tourists to the area and became a popular attraction in the Wisconsin Dells tourist area following the economic recovery after the Great Depression. Resorts and tourist attractions line its banks. The lake was the site of Tommy Bartlett&#x27;s Thrill Show, which featured acrobatic water skiing.

==History==
In 1926, Chicago construction company owner William J. Newman decided to build a resort area in the tiny Delton, Wisconsin area (as the community of Lake Delton had been known at the time). Newman engaged a local land agent to purchase tracts of land along both banks of a stretch of Dell Creek. After taking title to the tracts, Newman brought engineers and construction crews to the area, who built a high dam near the confluence of Dell Creek and the Wisconsin River. They built a dike along the dam. They also created of artificial shoreline for the resort area.

Newman was particularly knowledgeable about dam and dike construction as his companies had done a majority of the caisson work that downtown Chicago skyscrapers are built upon. Caisson work involves building retaining, watertight structures used, for example, to work on the foundations of a bridge pier or for the construction of a concrete dam.

On July 27, 1927, they closed the dam&#x27;s sluice gates and allowed Dell Creek to fill up the lake basin that had been excavated and graded behind the dam. This resulted in a large pooling of water from the flow of Dell Creek, which was named Lake Delton. Newman had spent $600,000 on the construction by that date and expected to spend another $400,000 to build the resort. They built a lock between the lake and the Wisconsin River to allow small boats and canoes to travel between the bodies of water.

To decorate his own summer home on Lake Delton, Newman transported several sculptures and concrete blocks he saved from the rubble of Midway Gardens (1913, Chicago, Illinois; demolished 1929), the last of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Prairie Style buildings, which had stood near the Lake Michigan shoreline in downtown Chicago. Newman&#x27;s company had been hired in 1929 to demolish the structure. Years later, when Wright heard of the survival of the sculptures and blocks, he purchased them and they remained with his estate. As recently as 1999, a block was found buried on the property of Newman&#x27;s old summer home on Lake Delton and was donated to the Chicago Historical Society.

Newman ran the resort until the Great Depression caused him to file for bankruptcy protection. The Lake Delton enterprise was barely able to survive, and in the 1940s Newman&#x27;s interest was sold to an investment group, called the Lake Delton Development Corporation. The Lake Delton resort area was more successful after World War II, when tourism increased in the Dells area with Tommy Bartlett&#x27;s water show. 
By the 1980s, the Lake Delton strip had become home to waterparks, resorts and other recreational facilities that made it a mecca for travelers from across the United States. In fact, the local village website boasts that &quot;4.5 million visitors come to the Wisconsin Dells-Lake Delton area each year.&quot;

The lake level was drawn down for repairs on the dam in 1983. The inflow recharged the lake in 15 days.
Much of the shoreline of Lake Delton has been developed with summer homes, year-round homes and condominiums. About 20 resorts surround the lake. Prior to the 2008 washout, the lake had poor water quality, which is common to impoundments in southwest Wisconsin. Some of the water quality problems may have been due to construction site erosion, as well as rural nonpoint source pollution. The lake also had nuisance aquatic weed growth that has required chemical treatment. The fishery of the Lake Delton was northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, channel catfish and panfish.

==2008 draining==
===Immediate effects===

On the morning of June 9, 2008, a portion of County Trunk Highway A that traverses the north side of Lake Delton failed, creating a new drainage channel to the Wisconsin River. At 2 a.m. that day, of rain caused one hundred residents to start sandbagging. The lake waters overflowed County Highway A about a quarter mile from the dam, and most of the lake emptied in two hours. The water began overflowing at approximately 10 a.m. As the water overtopped the isthmus, it flowed downhill to the Wisconsin River approximately away, quickly eroding and creating a channel that rapidly drained the lake in an out-of-control torrent into the river, below the lake&#x27;s level. Three homes washed away, and another two were destroyed when their foundations were undermined by the new outflow. The sediments at the bottom of the lake were visible. &quot;We have nothing but mud in front of us now,&quot; said Tom Diehl, operator of the Tommy Bartlett Show and a Lake Delton village trustee. &quot;No water. Just mud.&quot;
Wisconsin governor Jim Doyle announced on June 10 that the state would repair the lake. He described the lake as crucial to the billion-dollar Wisconsin Dells tourism area. Engineers with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) were studying the lake, and Doyle said it will only take about two weeks for water from the river to refill the lake. It is unknown, however, how long it will take to divert and correct the river&#x27;s current path back into the lake. Dell Creek is still flowing down to the Wisconsin River, and the lake would be refilled from the creek, once the breach in the highway and collaterally damaged areas are repaired.

Russ Rasmussen, director of watershed management for the DNR, said restoring Lake Delton will be more involved than simply filling in the new channel. &quot;Whatever goes in there will have to be built to dam standards,&quot; he added.

Two of the owners whose homes were washed away at the point of the breach were unable to purchase flood insurance. They said that the city told them it was unnecessary, because the lake was dam-controlled. WISC-TV reported that the village had lost its eligibility for the Federal Emergency Management Agency&#x27;s (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program after the village failed to formally adopt an updated floodplain map called a &quot;flood insurance rate map&quot; (the official map of a community on which FEMA has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community). The village engineer and clerk said the map was not adopted because of &quot;gross inaccuracies&quot; in how FEMA had expanded the floodplain.

In an effort to make some good from the situation, local residents organized a &quot;clean the lake bottom&quot; campaign in which interested volunteers walked the empty lakebed before the lake&#x27;s refilling in order to remove refuse that has collected there.
On June 14, 2008, about 250 volunteers, including many who did not live in the area, filled four dumpsters with refuse.

Illusionists Rick and Suzan Wilcox staged a show on June 22, 2008, to benefit families who lost their homes in the Lake Delton flood. In addition, visitors to Noah&#x27;s Ark Waterpark on June 21, 2008, helped the victims of Lake Delton with the price of admission. The water park donated $2 from every ticket sold on that date to the Lake Delton Flood Relief Fund.

===Repair and restoration===
Following the draining of Lake Delton, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources Conservation Service allocated $160,000 to the Village of Lake Delton to redirect Dell Creek back to its normal path and through the Lake Delton Dam. The reconstruction took about 10 days to complete. A cofferdam was built to intercept the water and stop further erosion. A bipartisan congressional effort worked to provide emergency federal funds to midwest areas affected by the June 2008 floods. A bill was signed on June 30, 2008, that provided $390 million for the Emergency Watershed Program, which provides assistance on a matching-fund basis to state and local governmental entities. The Natural Resources Conservation Service estimated that about $500 million in total would be needed for the midwest recovery efforts.

The reparation of the break was coordinated by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.

Restoration was well underway by the end of October 2008. The gap was filled with 12,000 truckloads of sand and tons of rocks. Sand to fill the gap was donated by a landowner less than a mile away saving $3 million in fuel and material costs. Improvements were also underway on the dam to allow it to withstand a 1,000 year flood without the lake&#x27;s level rising. The Wisconsin DNR chief of dams stated that the goal was to have the lake refilled by late spring 2009.
Highway A was reopened during the last week of November 2008. Water began flowing back into Lake Delton after the dam was closed in early December 2008. An official ceremony was held for December 5, 2008, for both the Highway A reconstruction and the Dam projects. Additionally, rotenone was used to kill carp prior to the commencement of refilling. In February 2009, it was announced that the lake was expected to be refilled by Memorial Day weekend. Costs to the State of Wisconsin were said to be $3.6 million and $2.5 million was spent by the village of Lake Delton.

On June 9, 2009, Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle was in Wisconsin Dells to help celebrate the reopening of Lake Delton. The lake is at an average depth of 12 feet. Minnows have been released into the lake, and 9,000 walleye fingerlings were released in July 2009.

<doc id="603864" wikidata="Q112762" url="?curid=603864" title="Cumulative song">
<text>A cumulative song is a song with a simple verse structure modified by progressive addition so that each verse is longer than the verse before. Cumulative songs are popular for group singing, in part because they require relatively little memorization of lyrics, and because remembering the previous verse to concatenate it to form the current verse can become a kind of game.

== Structure ==
Typically, the lyrics take the form of a stanza of at least two lines. In each verse, the text of the first line introduces a new item, and the other line uses the words to begin a list which includes items from all the preceding verses. The item is typically a new phrase (simultaneously a group of words and a musical phrase) to a line in a previous stanza.

The two lines are often separated by refrains. Many cumulative songs also have a chorus.

=== Songs with two-line stanzas ===

One of the most well-known examples of a cumulative song is the Christmas song &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;, which uses a two-line stanza, where the second line is cumulative, as follows:

&lt;poem&gt;
On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent (&quot;or &quot;gave&quot;&quot;) to me
A partridge in a pear tree.

On the second day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree.

On the third day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
Three french hens, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree.
&lt;/poem&gt;

and so on until

&lt;poem&gt;
On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
Twelve drummers drumming, eleven pipers piping, ten lords a-leaping, nine ladies dancing, eight maids a-milking, seven swans a-swimming, six geese a-laying, five gold(en) rings, four calling birds, three french hens, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The first gift (the partridge) is always sung to a &quot;coda melody&quot; phrase. For the first four verses, the additional gifts are all sung to a repeated standard melodic phrase. In the fifth verse, a different melody, with a change of tempo, is introduced for the five gold(en) rings; and from this point on the first five gifts are always sung to a set of varied melodic phrases (with the partridge retaining its original coda phrase). Thence forward, the wording of each new gift is sung to the original standard melodic phrase before returning to the five gold(en) rings.

=== Songs with refrains ===
In many songs, an item is introduced in the first line of each stanza and extends the list in another line. An example is The Barley Mow (Roud 944):

&lt;poem&gt;
Here&#x27;s good luck to the pint pot,
Good luck to the barley mow
Jolly good luck to the pint pot,
Good luck to the barley mow

Oh the pint pot, half a pint, gill pot, half a gill, quarter gill, nipperkin, and a round bowl
Here&#x27;s good luck, good luck, good luck to the barley mow
&lt;/poem&gt;

The second verse substitutes a larger drink measure in the first line. In the second line the new measure heads the list and is sung to the same musical phrase as pint pot.

&lt;poem&gt;
Here&#x27;s good luck to the quart pot,
Good luck to the barley mow
Jolly good luck to the quart pot,
Good luck to the barley mow

Oh the quart pot, pint pot, half a pint, gill pot, half a gill, quarter gill, nipperkin, and a round bowl
Here&#x27;s good luck, good luck, good luck to the barley mow
&lt;/poem&gt;

One version of the final line and refrain is:

&lt;poem&gt;
Oh the company, the brewer, the drayer, the slavey, the daughter, the landlady, the landlord, the barrel, the half-barrel, the gallon, the half-gallon, the quart pot, pint pot, half a pint, gill pot, half a gill, quarter gill, nipperkin, and a round bowl
Here&#x27;s good luck, good luck, good luck to the barley mow
&lt;/poem&gt;

Alan Lomax recorded Jack French singing &quot;The Barley Mow&quot; at the Blaxhall Ship, a famous singing pub in Suffolk, in 1953. This recording is available online at the Cultural Equity website.

=== Songs with a chorus ===
A chorus (often with its own refrain) may be added to the stanzas as in &quot;The Rattlin&#x27; Bog&quot; (Roud 129):

&lt;poem&gt;
Hi ho, the rattlin&#x27; bog,
The bog down in the valley-o,
Hi ho, the rattlin&#x27; bog,
The bog down in the valley-o.

1. Now in the bog there was a tree,
A rare tree, a rattlin&#x27; tree,
The tree in the bog,
And the bog down in the valley-o.

(CHORUS)

2. And on that tree there was a branch,
A rare branch, a rattlin&#x27; branch,
The branch on the tree, and the tree in the bog,
And the bog down in the valley-o.

(CHORUS)
&lt;/poem&gt;

One version of the final line+refrain is:

&lt;poem&gt;
The feather on the wing, and the wing on the bird, and the bird on the nest, and the nest on the twig, and the twig on the branch, and the branch on the tree, and the tree in the bog,
And the bog down in the valley-o.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Each phrase is sung to the same two-note melody.

Hamish Henderson recorded William Sinclair Mitchell, Agnes Mitchell and Agnes Mitchell singing &quot;The Rattling Bog&quot; in 1979. The recording is available on line on the Tobar an Dualchais – Kist o Riches website.

Jim Carroll and Pat McKenzie recorded Pat McNamara singing &quot;The Bog Down in the Valley&quot; in Kilshanny, in 1975. The recording is available online on the Clare County Library website.

== Cumulative songs in languages other than English ==
Yiddish folk music contains many prominent examples of cumulative songs, including &quot;?װאָס װעט זײַן אַז משיח װעט קומען&quot; and &quot;מה אספּרה,&quot; or &quot;What Will Happen When the Messiah Comes?&quot; and &quot;Who Can Recall&quot; (a Yiddish version of the Passover song &quot;Echad Mi Yodea&quot;).

The Passover seder contains two Hebrew cumulative songs: &quot;Echad Mi Yodea&quot; and &quot;Chad Gadya&quot;.

<doc id="603877" wikidata="Q6475734" url="?curid=603877" title="Lake Elsinore">
<text>Lake Elsinore is a natural freshwater lake in Riverside County, California, United States, located east of the Santa Ana Mountains and fed by the San Jacinto River. Originally named Laguna Grande by Spanish explorers, it was renamed for the town of Elsinore, established on its northeastern shore on April 9, 1888.

Lake water levels have fluctuated greatly from dry spells to flooding. Lake Elsinore was home to the Lake Shore Beach Club, an African American resort.

==Limnology==
Lake Elsinore is the largest natural freshwater lake in Southern California. With its own 750-mi2 (1,900-km2) watershed, it is situated at the lowest point within the San Jacinto River watershed of , at the terminus of the San Jacinto River. It is the terminal lake of a partially closed basin called the San Jacinto Basin.

Lake water levels are healthy at an average of above sea level with a volume of which often fluctuates, although much has been done recently to prevent the lake from drying up, flooding, or becoming stagnant. When the lake&#x27;s water level is , it spills into the outflow channel on its northeastern shore, known as Temescal Wash, flowing northwest through Temescal Canyon and feeding Alberhill Creek which joins Temescal Creek. The Temescal Creek in turn dumps into the Santa Ana River just northwest of Corona, California.

===Lake history===
Lake Elsinore was seen by the Spanish Franciscan padre Juan Santiago, exploring eastward from the Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1797. In 1810, the water level of the &quot;Laguna Grande&quot; was first described by a traveler as being little more than a swamp about a mile long. Later in the early 19th century, the lake grew larger, providing Mexican rancheros, American trappers, the expedition of John C. Frémont, and the immigrants during the California Gold Rush a spot to camp and water their animals as they traveled along the southern shore of the lake on what later became the Southern Emigrant Trail and the route of the Butterfield Overland Mail. The lake and the Laguna Rancho adobe built near the lake on its southwest shore at its western corner was described by Benjamin Ignatius Hayes, who stayed there overnight on January 27–28, 1850:

In about 15 miles reach some timber where the hills approach near, apparently the termination of the valley of Temecula, a sort of low divide over which we enter into another valley. In both these is much good soil, although in the latter more of the wiry grass and more marshy, some little evergreen oak among the hills.

Come to the Laguna, two miles from the divide. Some good young grass, great deal of elder on its banks; as we rode along frequent flocks of geese rose from the shore; many shots at them; none brought down. The water of the Laguna is saltish, the animals cannot drink it; if they could, such a sheet of fresh water here would be invaluable to the owner of this land. As we were moving along the lake, an Indian overtook us, running as if to catch up with us; said he was from Temecula and going to the mines; had a little pinole tied up in a handkerchief; spoke Spanish, seemed disposed to be communicative.

At sunset the moon rises behind the snowy peaks to the eastward and is reflected on the lake. Wild sage; the lake has evidently once, near the house, been with a much broader basin. How is it supplied with water? Clover around it. The house is a substantial adobe. A small stream seems to enter it on the east. A low range of hills nearly surrounds the lake, higher where we are encamped on the southern side. The lake valley seems to be higher than that of Temecula…Two or three men at this house; their wives seem to be Indians.

Road firm and good, gently ascending for a mile or more from the lake; then uneven, occasionally sandy, to Temescal.

As a result of the Great Flood of 1862, the level of the lake was very high, and the Union Army created a post at the lake to graze and water their horses. In the great 1862–65 drought, most of the cattle in Southern California died and the lake level fell, especially during 1866 and 1867, when practically no rain fell. However, the lake was full again in 1872, when it overflowed down its outlet through Temescal Canyon. After 1872, the lake again evaporated to a very low level, but the great rains in the winter of 1883–84 filled it to overflowing in three weeks. Descriptions of the lake at this time say that large willow trees surrounding the former low-water shore line stood or more below the high-water level and were of such size that they must have been 30 or more years old. Indications are that the high water of the 1860s and 1870s must have been of a very short duration.

The rainfall until 1893 was greater than normal, and the lake remained high and overflowed naturally on three or four occasions during that time. The lake water was purchased by the Temescal Water Company for the irrigation of land in Corona. Its outlet channel was deepened, permitting gravity flow down the natural channel of Temescal Canyon to Corona for a year or more after the water level sank below the natural elevation of its outlet. As the lake surface continued to recede, a pumping plant was installed, and pumping was continued a few seasons, but the concentration of salts in the lake, due to the evaporation and lack of rainfall, soon made the water unfit for irrigation, and the project was abandoned by the company. After 1893, the lake&#x27;s water level sank almost continuously for nearly 10 years, with a slight rise every winter. Heavier precipitation, beginning in 1903, gradually filled the lake to about half the depth above its minimum level since 1883. Then in January, 1916, a flood rapidly raised the level to overflowing.

The lake hosted teams for Olympic training and high-speed boat racing in the 1920s. It went dry in the mid-1930s, but refilled by 1938. The lake ran dry during most of the 1950s and was refilled in the early 1960s. More than a week of heavy rains in 1980 flooded the lake, destroying surrounding homes and businesses. Since then a multimillion-dollar project has been put into place to maintain the water at a consistent level, allowing for homes to be built close to the lake. In 2007, an aeration system was added to prevent fish kills in the lake&#x27;s ecosystem. A series of storms in February 2024, brought the lake to 1,248 ft, a 25 year high.

== Description ==
Lake Elsinore sits in a basin, the Elsinore Valley which is a graben rift valley and part of the Elsinore Trough. It is the largest sag pond in the Elsinore Fault Zone. It lies beyond the northwestern extremity of the Temecula Valley, cut off from its Santa Margarita River watershed by a slight ridge running across the valley south of the lake between the Sedco Hills and the Elsinore Mountains to the west, part of the larger Santa Ana Mountain Range to the west and northwest of the valley. On the west side of the lake are many small arroyos like the Lakeland Village Channel, which drains canyons whose source is on the east slope of the Elsinore Mountains. Lake Elsinore&#x27;s northwestern shore rises to the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains and the saddle between them and the Clevelin Hills, which closely enclose the lake along its northeastern shore until they decline and end short near the shore of the Temescal Creek outlet from the lake that passes through downtown Lake Elsinore. Two of its larger tributaries come into the north shore of the lake from the Santa Ana Mountains, Leach Canyon Creek, and McVicker Canyon Creek. 

The lake south of the Temescal Creek outlet lies in an open area at the mouth of its major tributary, the San Jacinto River, distantly bounded to the east by the Tuscany Hills and south of the river by the Sedco Hills both part of the range of the Temescal Mountains. Much of the lake basin has been cut off from the lake and river by a flood-control levee, which only permits the isolated section to fill after an extremely large rainfall event raises the lake over the level of the overflow spillway, north of the baseball stadium.

===Discharge===
Lake Elsinore Valley and the San Jacinto Basin which is its tributary, is a partially closed drainage basin and part of the Great Basin Divide. Its watershed is normally endorheic, but sometimes flows into the Santa Ana River watershed during periods of high water after heavy rainfall or snow melt. It discharges water through the Elsinore Spillway Channel outlet to Temescal Creek when the lake reaches the level of the outlet at . Temescal Creek, flows through Warm Springs Valley and Walker Canyon into the Temescal Wash, which in turn flows through the northern Elsinore Trough to the Santa Ana River in such conditions. In recent years, efforts to maintain the lake at a stable high level have made the flows occur more frequently and for a longer duration during the year.

<text>Morgan Fairchild (born Patsy Ann McClenny; February 3, 1950) is an American actress. She began acting in the early 1970s and has had roles in several television series since then.

Fairchild began her career on the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; as Jennifer Pace from 1973 to 1977. In 1978, she appeared on the primetime soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot; as the first actress to portray Jenna Wade, before taking a lead role on the NBC series &quot;Flamingo Road&quot; in 1980 (for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama). In 1984, she co-starred on ABC&#x27;s short-lived television drama &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;, and then appeared on &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; as attorney Jordan Roberts from 1985 to 1986. Fairchild has also performed in theater and played guest roles on television comedies, including &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; (for which she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series), &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;Cybill&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot;. She is a board member of SAG-AFTRA.

==Early life==
Fairchild was born Patsy Ann McClenny in Dallas, Texas, the daughter of Martha Jane (Hartt), a high school English teacher who taught at Richardson High School (in Richardson, Texas), and Edward Milton McClenny. Fairchild has a younger sister, Cathryn Hartt, who is also an actress. As a younger child, she was seen on WFAA&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Peppermint Show&quot; with host Jerry Haynes. In her teens, she was in the audience on WFAA&#x27;s &quot;Sump&#x27;n Else&quot; bandstand show. She auditioned three times to be in The Little Group, which was the show&#x27;s dance group. Also during this time, she appeared in several locally broadcast commercials on Dallas-Fort Worth television stations.

==Career==
Fairchild&#x27;s first acting job was as a double for Faye Dunaway during filming for the film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), particularly in scenes where Bonnie is driving a car because Dunaway could not drive a stick shift. She took her new first name, Morgan, from the David Warner film &quot;Morgan - A Suitable Case for Treatment&quot; (1966). Fairchild then moved to New York City, where she secured her first credited onscreen role as the maniacal Jennifer Pace in the daytime soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; from 1973 until 1977. From the mid-1970s, she began to make various appearances on episodic primetime television series such as &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, and a few episodes of &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;.

Fairchild played Jenna Wade in the soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot; for one episode in 1978. The same year, Fairchild made the television film &quot;The Initiation of Sarah&quot; and also had a recurring role on the sitcom &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;. In 1980, she scored her first regular primetime role as Constance Weldon Carlyle on the soap opera &quot;Flamingo Road&quot;. Though the series had an impressive beginning, the ratings soon dropped and it was canceled after two seasons. Fairchild was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for her role.
After the cancellation of &quot;Flamingo Road&quot;, Fairchild continued to make guest appearances in a variety of episodic television series such as &quot;Hotel&quot;; &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;; &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. She also starred in the theatrical film &quot;The Seduction&quot; (1982). In 1984, along with Joan Collins, she co-hosted the ABC-TV special &quot;Blondes vs. Brunettes&quot;, a one-hour variety show that gently poked fun at popular culture&#x27;s blonde vs. brunette rivalry. In that same year, she also co-starred in another primetime soap opera &quot;Paper Dolls&quot; playing modeling agency owner Racine. The series was cancelled halfway through its first season, but by this time, Fairchild was established as a television actress. In 1985, she joined the cast of the soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, playing the glamorous lawyer Jordan Roberts for a season. She also appeared in the miniseries &quot;North and South&quot; (1985), and its sequel (1986).

In 1985, Jon Lovitz on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; created the &quot;Tommy Flanagan, The Pathological Liar&quot; character who claimed outlandish achievements for himself, culminating in the grand illusion that his wife was Morgan Fairchild. The obvious remoteness of such a possibility, and its mainstream comic appeal, was testimonial to Fairchild&#x27;s broad popularity and desirability.
Fairchild continued to make appearances in films and television series throughout the 1980s and garnered an Emmy Award nomination for her guest appearance in a 1989 episode of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. In the early 1990s, she was cast in a recurring role in &quot;Roseanne&quot;, as Sandra Bernhard&#x27;s bisexual girlfriend Marla. In 1994, Fairchild appeared in an unexpectedly campy advertisement campaign for clothing retailer Old Navy, with Joan Collins and other formerly familiar faces on television. Her reprised role as the over-the-top glamour vixen was so successful that the company created numerous sequels around her persona. She played herself in the comedy films &quot;Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult&quot; (1994), &quot;Holy Man&quot; (1998) and &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot; (2007).

In 1995, Fairchild returned to daytime soap operas as the catty Sydney Chase on &quot;The City&quot;. She played the role for a year, after which she went on to appear in &quot;General Hospital&quot;. She also made guest appearances on the hit sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; (as Chandler Bing&#x27;s mother, Nora) and was a recurring guest star on the sitcom &quot;Cybill&quot; as Andrea, a rival of Cybill Shepherd&#x27;s character.

Through the years, Fairchild has also appeared in various theater productions. More recently, she starred in the role of Mrs. Robinson in the stage adaptation of the film &quot;The Graduate&quot;. She also fronted an international advertising campaign for the consumer tooth whitening product Dental White. In 2005, Fairchild appeared in the competition reality show &quot;But Can They Sing?&quot; on VH1.
In 2006, she was cast in yet another of her &quot;rich bitch&quot; roles in the MyNetworkTV series &quot;Fashion House&quot;, playing Sophia Blakely, a rival to Bo Derek&#x27;s character, Maria Gianni. She has also appeared on the television series &quot;Chuck&quot; as Dr. Honey Woodcomb, the mother of Captain Awesome. In 2007 she appeared on &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; where she was cast as a cougar who propositions Charlie Harper with the line &quot;What has multiple orgasms and hums?&quot; She made another return to soap operas in 2009 when she had a guest role in the daytime series &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. In recent years, she guest-starred in &quot;Bones&quot;, &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;.

In 2014, Fairchild was named spokesperson for a website that was created to help consumers make burial preplanning choices. It was previously known as BurialPlanning.com but is now known as MemorialPlanning.com. In that capacity, she appeared in television commercials and in a direct mail campaign.

Fairchild has appeared in some independent movies in the 2000s and 2010s. In 2017, she returned to daytime for a limited run in &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; playing Anjelica Deveraux, a role previously played by soap actress Judith Chapman. Fairchild received a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Performer in a Drama Series nomination for her performance. In 2022, she guest-starred in the two episodes of ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; playing Haven de Havilland.

On 3 October 2023, it was announced that Fairchild would feature in the Lifetime film, &quot;Ladies of the &#x27;80s: A Divas Christmas&quot;. According to the official synopsis, the movie follows five soap opera divas readying for a reunion show who take on playing cupid during Christmas to bring together their director and producer as they all learn the meaning of the true Christmas spirit. The ensemble cast is made up of Fairchild, Loni Anderson, Linda Gray, Donna Mills, and Nicollette Sheridan.

==Personal life==

Fairchild was married to Jack Calmes from 1967 to 1973. 

For many years, she has been an activist for social causes including AIDS and environmentalism. 

In 1987, she was involved in a long-term relationship with Mark Seiler. Fairchild reported on her Twitter account that Seiler died on July 7, 2023.

She stated that she was twice kidnapped in the early 1970s.

In addition to her work as an actress, Fairchild has long maintained a strong role within the Screen Actors Guild, now SAG-AFTRA. Fairchild was a three-year board member of the Guild and has served on several committees, including co-chair Legislative Committee, National Executive Committee, SAG-AFTRA Relations Committee, Commercials Contracts Committee, Honors and Tributes Committee (HATS), and Guild Governance and Rules Committee.

<text>Petersville Australia Limited was an Australian food producer.

==History==

Petersville was founded in 1961 when Edgell and Peters Ice Cream merged. In May 1981, H.C. Sleigh Co. launched a successful takeover offer and rebranded the company Petersville Sleigh. In 1982, it was taken over by the Adelaide Steamship Company. In October 1991 it was purchased by Pacific Dunlop.

Some of the foods it produced or distributed were: ice cream, yogurt, cheese, butter and imported cheeses. Its head office (now Nestle Australia&#x27;s) was in Wellington Road, Mulgrave, Victoria, which was itself known as Petersville.

Among its brand names were Peters Ice Cream, Four&#x27;n Twenty, Edgell and Birds Eye. 

Petersville had dairy production plants at Warragul, Trafalgar and Yarragon in Victoria and at Orange, Taree and Grafton in New South Wales.

<doc id="603901" wikidata="Q26897146" url="?curid=603901" title="Affluent society">
<text>An affluent society is form of society characterized by material abundance for broad segments of the population.

A typical image for the affluent society is the literary topos of the Cockaigne, a mythical land of luxury goods. Similar terms, used more in a negative context, are throw-away society and consumer society.

== History of the term ==
A popular description of the land of Cockaigne is found in 14th century Ireland as the eponymous poem &quot;The Land of Cokaygne&quot;, which was a fictional country located to the west of Spain.

The concept of the affluent society was borrowed from an economic work by the U.S. economist John Kenneth Galbraith called &quot;The Affluent Society&quot; and appears only sporadically in sociological or socio-critical works.

== Poverty in affluent societies ==
Open poverty in the U.S. entered the public consciousness in 1962 with the book by the left-wing Catholic Michael Harrington &quot;The Other America&quot;. He found 50 million poor people in a country of then 200 million inhabitants, who had also escaped social science because it had assumed that they simply could not exist.

With the strengthening of the civil rights movement and the slogan of the Great Society under President Lyndon B. Johnson, this previously overlooked aspect of U.S. society finally entered the consciousness of politicians.

For example, Gabriel Kolko&#x27;s thorough study of income and wealth distribution over several decades found a stable persistence of poverty, and even rather a tendency for the poorer class to grow. Accordingly, Kolko considers the thesis of a middle-class society to be empirically refuted. The work of Simon Smith Kuznets had often served as the basis for the latter thesis. This study, however, was limited to the 5 percent of the population with the highest per capita income.

A more recent study also finds that poverty is a complex phenomenon whose trends and boundaries shift over time, both in absolute terms and in relative terms, but for which causes are very difficult to pin down. In principle, however, it should be clear that a solution to the social problem cannot be expected through market processes alone.

Critics of the affluent society, such as the Indian Germanist Saral Sarkar, see economism (dominance of the economy) as the basis for the processes of the affluent society. Sarkar calls for refusal to consume as a countermeasure.

<doc id="603903" wikidata="Q451599" url="?curid=603903" title="Child safety lock">
<text>A child safety lock is a special-purpose lock for cabinets, drawers, bottles, etc. that is designed to help prevent children from getting at any dangerous things or contents. Young children are naturally curious about their surroundings and will always explore, but as they may be unaware of dangerous substances or situations, the results can be fatal. Numerous cases of poisoning have resulted from eating brightly colored pills or spilling cleaning solvents.

==Containers==

In the United States, child safety locking mechanisms have been required by law since 1970 on all containers for potentially dangerous medicines and household cleaning products. These laws are enforced by the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These locking mechanisms may take several forms, but the most common is a design that requires a tab to be pressed firmly as the lid is twisted. Great strength and dexterity are not required to open the bottle, but the process is deliberately made to be unintuitive, and the children who might recklessly eat pills are unable to decipher the opening instructions. Parents and guardians are firmly admonished to keep all such containers out of the reach of children anyway, as no locking device is foolproof. It has become common practice in households to keep medicines and pills in high cabinets (sometimes locked) for safety. Cleaning agents, however, are still generally kept under sinks, where they are accessible.

==Cabinet doors==

Another type of lock is an inexpensive device which can be easily installed into drawers, cabinets, or other openables to prevent easy opening. It consists of a bendable plastic rod with a blunt hook on one side, and is situated on the inside of the drawer or cabinet. The hook catches on part of the drawer or door and prevents opening unless the rod is bent downward simultaneously to disengage the hook. These devices are helpful to pet owners as well — a typical housecat may be able to paw open a cabinet filled with food, but would have trouble operating the hook mechanism. Also available are electromagnetic cabinet locking devices that are activated via remote control.

Certain locks are available specifically for child proofing. These locks have the same function as the other lock design: to lock away valuables, food, or dangers from unwanted guests. However, these locks have a design that resembles a strap like lock. It attaches with two adhesive stickers and opens with a small slider. This slider was specifically designed to be tough for smaller children to get open, such as the medicine/cleaning product containers. Because of its latch design, it is not only able to strap to cabinets, but also other objects of the like. This includes but is not limited to fridges, toilets, garbage cans, drawers, microwaves, etc...

== Magnetic safety locks ==

In recent years, new hidden magnetic cabinet locks opened by a magnetic key have become widespread. Their advantage is the ability to lock cabinets and drawers, even without handles, while leaving the decor clean and smooth.

==Automotive==
Patented 7 June 1949 by Joseph M. Schumann, child safety locks are built into the rear doors of most cars to prevent rear seat passengers from opening the doors both during transit and while the vehicle is stationary. With an update to the Code of Federal Regulations in 1985 vehicles sold in the US began installing rear door child safety locks on all models. While referred to as child safety locks, this device prevents operation of the interior door handle for any passenger using the engaged door&#x27;s interior handle, preventing exit unless the rear window can be lowered and the exterior handle engaged, or the passenger relocates to the front driver&#x27;s seat.

The lock is typically engaged via a small switch on the edge of the door that is only accessible when the door is open. Some cars implement the child lock control as a rotary mechanism which can only be operated with a key. This design ensures the child lock remains in position, preventing passengers from changing the lock position when the door is open. Once the door is closed, control of these two mechanical type child locks is completely inaccessible to passengers. Starting in 1999, manufacturers began using electronic child locks activated from the driver position via a Door control unit, although Nissan offered manual, remote controlled child locks on their Pulsar/Cherry as early as 1982.

According to 49 CFR 571.206 S4.3.1, when the safety lock is engaged, it &quot;prevents operation of the interior door handle or other interior latch release control and requires separate actions to unlock the door and operate the interior door handle or other interior latch release control,&quot; effectively locking passengers inside the vehicle.

==Pool fencing==
Child safety locks can be fitted to pool fencing in order to make a pool area safer.

In Australia, pool fencing is required by law. It is stipulated that the lock should be attached on the side of the fence facing toward the pool, so that anyone entering would have to reach over the top of the boundary. Failing this, the child safety lock should be at least off the ground.

<doc id="603904" wikidata="Q1605895" url="?curid=603904" title="Henri de Montmorency, 3rd Duke of Montmorency">
<text>Henri de Montmorency, 3rd [[Duke of Montmorency]] (15 June 1534 in Chantilly, Oise – 2 April 1614), Marshal of France, and Constable of France, seigneur of Damville, served as Governor of Languedoc from 1563 to 1614.

== Biography ==

Born on 15 June 1534, Henri was the son of Anne de Montmorency and Madeleine of Savoy. As &quot;Gouverneur&quot;, he led an army into Toulouse, campaigning for nine months in 1570, and was chastized by the &quot;capitouls&quot; for letting Catholic property fall into the hands of a passing Protestant army without taking action. They accused Henri of being betraying the city and being in league with Protestants like his cousin Admiral Coligny. He responded by arresting four &quot;bourgeois&quot; and sending them to Paris with charges of slander. Henri also placed a &quot;procureur-général&quot; on the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Toulouse who was suspected of Protestantism. In October 1574 he joined with the Protestants of lower Languedoc, was deprived of his office by the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Toulouse, and arrests were made of his associates charged with conspiracy against the king. In the midst of these arrests, Henri hanged one of his own captains on a suspicion of poisoning, believing that Henry III of France was trying to kill him.

Henri became Duke of Montmorency on his brother François&#x27; death in 1579. As a leader of the party called the &quot;Politiques&quot; he took a prominent part in the French Wars of Religion. In 1593 Henri was made constable of France, but Henry IV kept him away from Languedoc, owing to his nickname &quot;King of Languedoc&quot;.

Henri was purportedly a Grand Master of the Order of the Temple, according to the Charter of Larmenius.

==Issue==
Henri and his first wife, Antoinette de La Marck (1542–1591), daughter of Robert IV de La Marck, had:
* Charlotte de Montmorency (1571–1636), married in 1591 Charles de Valois, Duke of Angoulême
* Marguerite de Montmorency (1577–1660), married in 1593, Anne de Lévis, Duke of Ventadour

Henri and his second wife, Louise de Budos (1575–1598), had:

<doc id="603907" wikidata="Q3141532" url="?curid=603907" title="Shadowbane">
<text>Shadowbane was a free-to-play fantasy role-playing video game (MMORPG) created by Wolfpack Studios and published on March 25, 2003 by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X platforms. Originally commercial and subscription-driven, &quot;Shadowbane&quot; was launched in March 2003, and was the creation of text-MUD veterans J. Todd Coleman, James Nance, Josef Hall, Patrick Blanton and Robert Marsa and a team of 45 programmers, designers and artists. It closed on July 1, 2009.

&quot;Shadowbane&quot; was a top-10 best selling PC game at launch, and had two noteworthy aspects. First, the majority of the game world allowed for open player versus player combat, making it an early pioneer title in the PvP MMO genre. Second, it was the first major MMO to offer dynamic world content as a primary feature of the game. Most MMOs were static, meaning the world itself did not change based on player actions. Dynamic worlds allowed player to change the game world itself; morphing terrain, building and destroying buildings and fortifications, and setting up patrol paths for player-hired AI combatants. The game was considered a &quot;cult hit&quot; and sustained a small base of followers, but technical issues plagued the game at launch and failed to retain much of the early fanbase shortly afterward.

After the sale of Wolfpack Studios to Ubisoft in March 2004, the live service was transitioned to a new management and (largely new) development team, led by Frank Lucero and Ala Diaz. This team later splintered off to become Stray Bullet Games in June 2006, and Mark Nuasha was brought in to run the organization. In March 2006 the game was made free-to-play. A system of short ads was introduced on March 6, 2007 to fund operating costs, which were displayed when the game was opened or closed and when a character died (with at least 10 minutes between death ads). All servers were closed on March 19, 2008 to prepare for the &quot;Shadowbane Reboot&quot;, a relaunch of the game to capitalize on stability and performance gains hindered by previously existing data. All player characters and cities were deleted in this reboot. On March 25, the fifth anniversary of the game&#x27;s launch, two servers were brought online followed by a third due to overpopulation. The game was closed in July 2009.

The regular game took place in a dark fantasy world called Aerynth (the world sometimes depended on the servers, many of which had unique world maps). Gameplay featured many aspects typical of role-playing video games, such as experience points, character classes, and fantasy races. Character creation was fairly extensive, allowing for detailed, differentiable characters to be created.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Shadowbane&quot; was notable for emphasizing player-versus-player combat, implementing non-conventional races and specializing in siege warfare (players building cities and trying to raze enemy players&#x27; cities) whereas a significant number of MMORPGs released since &quot;Ultima Online&quot; usually restrict player killing to certain areas of the game or special dedicated PvP servers. The game also featured a seamless world map, and made no use of instancing.

Players were also allowed to own cities and capitals and most of the property and cities in &quot;Shadowbane&quot; were player owned. In effect, &quot;Shadowbane&quot;″s war status was decided by the players rather than the game company. Whether a guild city went to war with another guild city was entirely up to the leaders. A government system was also implemented in the game. It ensured players were in total control of the &quot;Shadowbane&quot; world.

Though there were no quests in the game, &quot;Shadowbane&quot; featured PvP, Nation, and Siege Warfare systems, which offered players a wide range of in-game opportunities. There were twelve races available in the game. There were four basic classes; Fighter, Healer, Mage and Rogue. Not all races could use every class. At 10th level, each character had to choose to promote to a specific profession, such as a Ranger or Assassin. Two classes, Fury and Huntress, were for female characters only whilst the Warlock was for male characters only. Which professions were available was dependent on the race, gender and base class of the character. In addition, each character could take up to four disciplines, from a list of over thirty, though as with Professions, access was limited by race, class and current profession. The level hard cap was level 75, and until level 70 the fourth discipline slot was locked.

After shifting to free to play system, Ubisoft used an ad-based revenue generation system consisting of short ad videos at game start, game close and character death. Ads played on character death were limited to no more than one instance in ten minutes.

==Closure==
&quot;Shadowbane&quot; was shut down on July 1, 2009.

In April 2012, Chinese gaming company Changyou acquired the intellectual property rights and source code to &quot;Shadowbane&quot; with the intent of developing a new version of the game, which was titled &quot;World of Shadowbane&quot;.

==Announcement of re-opening==
Around April 2020 Changyou announced that &quot;Shadowbane&quot; was going to re-launch. Currently the game is in server testing phase, first two-week test server opening on April 29 and second month-long test server opening on May 20.

==Reception==
The original &quot;Shadowbane&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.
The game sold over 120,000 units by the end of March 2003.

===The Rise of Chaos===
&quot;The Rise of Chaos&quot; received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

<doc id="603913" wikidata="Q60738778" url="?curid=603913" title="Land-use planning">
<text>Land use planning or &quot;Land-use regulation&quot; is the process of regulating the use of land by a central authority. Usually, this is done to promote more desirable social and environmental outcomes as well as a more efficient use of resources. More specifically, the goals of modern land use planning often include environmental conservation, restraint of urban sprawl, minimization of transport costs, prevention of land use conflicts, and a reduction in exposure to pollutants. In the pursuit of these goals, planners assume that regulating the use of land will change the patterns of human behavior, and that these changes are beneficial. The first assumption, that regulating land use changes the patterns of human behavior is widely accepted. However, the second assumption – that these changes are beneficial – is contested, and depends on the location and regulations being discussed.

In urban planning, land use planning seeks to order and regulate land use in an efficient and ethical way, thus preventing land use conflicts. Governments use land use planning to manage the development of land within their jurisdictions. In doing so, the governmental unit can plan for the needs of the community while safeguarding natural resources. To this end, it is the systematic assessment of land and water potential, alternatives for land use, and economic and social conditions in order to select and adopt the best land use options. Often one element of a comprehensive plan, a land use plan provides a vision for the future possibilities of development in neighborhoods, districts, cities, or any defined planning area.

In the United States, the terms land use planning, regional planning, urban planning, and urban design are often used interchangeably, and will depend on the state, county, and/or project in question. Despite confusing nomenclature, the essential function of land use planning remains the same whatever term is applied. The Canadian Institute of Planners offers a definition that land use planning means the scientific, aesthetic, and orderly disposition of land, resources, facilities and services with a view to securing the physical, economic and social efficiency, health and well-being of urban and rural communities. The American Planning Association states that the goal of land use planning is to further the welfare of people and their communities by creating convenient, equitable, healthful, efficient, and attractive environments for present and future generations. Land-use planning in England and Wales is founded on the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, with comparable legislation applicable in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

==History==
Land use planning nearly always requires land use regulation, which typically encompasses zoning. Zoning regulates the types of activities that can be accommodated on a given piece of land, as well as the amount of space devoted to those activities, and the ways that buildings may be situated and shaped.

The ambiguous nature of the term &quot;planning&quot;, as it relates to land use, is historically tied to the practice of zoning. Zoning in the US came about in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect the interests of property owners. The practice was found to be constitutionally sound by the Supreme Court decision of Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co. in 1926. Soon after, the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act gave authority to the states to regulate land use. Even so, the practice remains controversial today, particularly in its impact on economic and racial segregation, as some critics argue that zoning has often been used to exclude certain populations from particular neighborhoods.

The &quot;taking clause&quot; of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the government from taking private property for public use without just compensation. The case of Dolan v. City of Tigard demonstrated the criteria that determine the threshold of what is considered taking. One interpretation of the taking clause is that any restriction on the development potential of land through zoning regulation is a &quot;taking&quot;. A deep-rooted anti-zoning sentiment exists in America, that no one has the right to tell another what he can or cannot do with his land. Ironically, although people are often averse to being told how to develop their own land, they tend to expect the government to intervene when a proposed land use is undesirable.

Conventional zoning has not typically regarded the manner in which buildings relate to one another or the public spaces around them, but rather has provided a pragmatic system for mapping jurisdictions according to permitted land use. This system, combined with the interstate highway system, widespread availability of mortgage loans, growth in the automobile industry, and the over-all post-World War II economic expansion, destroyed most of the character that gave distinctiveness to American cities. The urban sprawl that most US cities began to experience in the mid-twentieth century was, in part, created by a flat approach to land use regulations. Zoning without planning created unnecessarily exclusive zones. Thoughtless mapping of these zones over large areas was a big part of the recipe for suburban sprawl. It was from the deficiencies of this practice that land use planning developed, to envision the changes that development would cause and mitigate the negative effects of such change.


As America grew and urban sprawl was rampant, the much-loved America of the older towns, cities, or streetcar suburbs essentially became illegal through zoning. Unparalleled growth and unregulated development changed the look and feel of landscapes and communities. They strained commercial corridors and affected housing prices, causing citizens to fear a decline in the social, economic and environmental attributes that defined their quality of life. Zoning regulations became politically contentious as developers, legislators, and citizens struggled over altering zoning maps in a way that was acceptable to all parties. Land use planning practices evolved as an attempt to overcome these challenges. It engages citizens and policy-makers to plan for development with more intention, foresight, and community focus than had been previously used.

==Description and application==
===Description===
Land use planning is defined as: the process by which optimum forms of land use and management are indicated, considering the biophysical, technological, social, economic and political conditions of a particular territory. The objective of planning land use is to influence, control or direct changes in the use of land so that it is dedicated to the most beneficial use and maintains the quality of the environment and promoting conservation of the land resources. The territorial diagnosis and the generation of alternatives of management and environmental protection for the planning of the use of the land produces the indispensable knowledge necessary for the formulation of the policies of use, contributing to the search of competitive and sustainable productive and extractive activities and systems. The methodological process of land use planning contributes to: orienting the location of economic and social activities regarding the aptitude of the land and providing solutions to conflicts of use; indicate the base of natural resources that should remain and protected areas; point out the areas exposed to natural hazards and their management; identify sustainable productive and extractive activities and systems; guide the planning of land uses and indicate the areas that require land adaptation or recovery projects 

===Planning process and parties involved===
In most countries, the local municipal council/local government, the body responsible of the environment and oftentimes the national government assume all the functions of land use planning; among them the corresponding function to territorial ordering (OT). For this reason, the highlighted bodies have among other responsibilities the promotion of the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources, establishing policies, criteria, tools and procedures of the most appropriate efficient and sustainable territorial order in coordination with any other relevant corresponding entities such as construction companies and the public.

===Application ===
* &quot;Developing cities and towns&quot;: land use planning is an important component of city planning. The nature of cities required to the most beneficial use in terms of maximization of economic factors and promoting convenience, while maintaining the quality of the environment and promoting conservation of the land. The only way to achieve this is the utilization of the elements of land use planning.
*&quot;The concept of Zoning&quot;: Zoning is the process by which areas of land are split into zones by appropriate establishments within which several users are assigned to each zone. Therefore, this makes zoning very important modus operandi in land use planning where it is used to design urban areas in many countries (Lewis-Roger, 1987). The topic of zoning is considered within the context of land use planning and design as a systemic perception. Zoning is used as a fundamental component of territorial planning, which is incorporated in the stages of the logical model of regional development. In the process of zoning, the actor divides land into units of different sizes, shapes and locations, according to the characteristics of the terrain and the corporality of a culture. The actor who generates a multiplicity of spaces using zoning, based on global spatial unit and the preferences of user who uses these spaces in multiple use form, decomposes his vision of it into four different dimensions namely; deontic, cognitive, expressive and aesthetics functions. Each of these dimensions represents land in different forms, intensities, positions and areas, which may not coincide with each other. The deontic space is that of the transforming actions of the world, of the duty to be and to do. The cognitive space is apprehended by the faculties of knowledge from the senses to the reason, such as the ecological and technological spaces. The aesthetic space refers to the scopes of feel and beauty. The expressive or indexical space corresponds to the internal and cultural expression of the identity of the person who organizes the space. Often, a fifth space is included, that is, the administrative space, which concerns the positioning of the legal, authoritative and legislative base being planned. Zoning should not be considered as the end in itself, but only as a means of approximation in relation to geographical reality. Instead of imposing pre-established categories, it is about looking for landscape discontinuities. The category system (taxonomy) must allow a deepening (level) of the landscapes according to their scale. For each order of phenomena there are thresholds of manifestation and “extinction” that by themselves can justify the systematic differentiation of landscapes into hierarchical units. The study and zoning of the coverage and land use requires first defining the concepts of land, coverage and use in order to avoid the problems of interpretation associated with the management of these concepts. The concept of land is defined as an entity formed by the mutual interaction of living and non-living nature in a recognizable portion of the Earth&#x27;s surface. It is a more geographical than edaphological definition. The earth is conceived as the result of the integration of biophysical and socioeconomic elements whose interrelation generates certain particular spatial units or landscapes, therefore, land and landscape are considered in this guide as synonyms. Land cover, on the other hand, is defined as the different features that cover the land, such as water, forest, other types of vegetation, bare rocks or sand, man-made structures, etc. In general, these are the traits that can be directly observed in aerial photographs and frequently in satellite images. The concept of use, applies to the employment that man gives to different types of coverage, cyclically or permanently to meet his material or spiritual needs. Basically, this is where the need for zoning arises.

===Conditions necessary===
# Community relations: for any land planning activity, the actors involved must involve the community or the public to put into consideration their opinions on the proposed land planning initiatives. After all, the land is being planned so that the public can enjoy the benefits that comes from land use planning.
# Government and legal support: the government can support land use planning initiatives in a myriad of ways. The first is by financing or subsidizing a section of land use planning activities. The second way is by reducing bureaucracy and administration bottlenecks that comes with obtaining permits and licences.

==Pros and cons==
===Pros===
* Land use planning is an important growth framework: prosperous urban areas have a vision that they must follow through a framework to achieve a development in a well-ordered way. Hence, land use planning provides the framework.
* A well-planned urban area is a well-prepared urban area: anticipating the future allows for better preparedness. Indeed, the presence of natural phenomena that represent threats to human activities implies a limitation in land use. It is necessary to plan the use of the land taking into account its limitation in order to allow the containment of natural phenomena and its manifestations either by restricting the presence of human life and/or activities, adapting infrastructure conditions in a manner that reduces its vulnerability to natural phenomena or implementing plans conducive to risk mitigation. The absence of territorial planning plans, the lack of definition of areas exposed to threats and the lack of studies on natural phenomena that might bring threats, ensure an increase in the number and magnitude of natural disasters. The process of land use planning developed putting into consideration those aspects, allows the identification, location and evaluation of areas exposed to natural phenomena, which allows the implementation of measures that guarantee risk mitigation.
* Good land use planning positively impacts the development of urban economy.
*Promote the national territorial order and economic ecological zoning as a support for the conservation, use and sustainable use of natural resources and biological diversity, as well as the orderly occupation of the territory. 
* The analysis of natural and anthropic risk in territorial planning processes is incorporated, as well as adaptation measures to climate change. 
* Mechanisms to prevent the settlement of populations and the development of socioeconomic activities are promoted in areas with high potential for risks in the face of natural and anthropic hazards.
* Territorial planning is promoted as a basis for concerted development plans and border development, in the management of watersheds and coastal marine areas.
* The actions of regional and local governments are guided for the efficient fulfillment of their functions in this area of land use planning.

===Cons===
* The cost of land use planning is usually high, generally because of poor investment and the lack of anticipation of technology.
* Land use planning theory has largely been shaped by case studies of cities in the Global North. Countries all over the world, particularly in the Global South, are seeing population booms and rapid urbanization. Many of the methods, practices, and assumptions about land use planning from 20th Century Europe and the United States are not relevant to the Global South, where conditions are quite different. Many fundamental concepts associated with traditional land use planning, like zoning, have persisted despite a rapidly-changing urban landscape.
* Fragmented land-use planning codes can reduce construction productivity.

==Land use planning and environmental sustainability==
In view of sustainable development, land use planning is seen as a political and technical-administrative decision-making process agreed with social, economic, political and technical factors, for orderly occupation and sustainable use of the land under development. On the other hand, it seeks regulation and promotion of the location and sustainable development of human settlements, economic and social activities, and spatial physical development, based on the identification of potentialities and limitations that consider environmental, economic, sociocultural, institutional and geopolitical criteria. By and large, these parameters are put in place in order to make sure that the environment is protected during land use or land development. Indeed, based on the recommendations of the United Nations in its Habitat conference, land is assigned a high importance for the development of human life as it is the fundamental support for its permanence and development, this being the most important objective of the policy of human settlements. That is, the land resource is recognized as an essential element, which supports the social, political and economic formation of society. As mentioned earlier, the use of land refers to the occupation of a certain area according to its agrological capacity and therefore its development potential, it is classified according to its location as urban or rural, it represents a fundamental element for the development of the city and its inhabitants since it is from these that its urban structure is formed and therefore its functionality is defined. For this reason, there is a need to ensure sustainability in order to ensure the we continue to enjoy the benefits that come from urban planning and to ensure that future generations will continue enjoying these benefits.

To guarantee this, land use planning come into the fold. In a broader sense, this is a tool through which State defines the type of use land will have within a settlement, e.g. a city, while also determining the guidelines for its use in order to ensure effectiveness and sustainability. Land use, in this case, is assigned on the basis on its physical and functional characteristics that they have in the urban structure, and with the aim of occupying the space in an orderly manner and according to their physical capacity (occupation of areas suitable for urban development and environmental sustainability), which finally it translates into a harmonious growth of the city. This tool is structured through a planning system at the national and local level, which establishes the general guidelines that should be taken into account for the development of urban development. Here, the authorities involved might formulate a number of restrictions to guarantee sustainability, for example, banning land development in riparian zones or in national parks. Basically, the goal here is to protect the environment.

Throughout the world, there are rising levels of environmental degradation due to unclean energy usage in the development and powering of cities and neighborhoods. In the 20th century, there was a global push to develop large cities quickly to accommodate the people who were migrating from rural areas to cities for jobs. The type of energy used for this was either coal or oil fuel, which meant that the environment was disregarded and damaged by numerous urban development projects. Today, the United Nations has found that over half of the world&#x27;s population lives in cities that are still growing. In order to create environmentally viable urban landscapes, the UN advocated for green energy use, as well as urban development that encouraged green-friendly transportation. In the United States, about 75% of the energy used is allocated to power buildings and modes of transportation; land use planning can be a useful tool in changing these aspects of energy usage in a way that would be beneficial to both residents and the ecology.

A sustainable urban development includes:

* Methods for reducing waste, such as recycling and composting programs that are easily accessible to residents. 
* Limiting pollution, with techniques such as protecting universal access to necessities and encouraging access to facilities, goods, and services in ways that do not require the use of a car.
* Encouraging public transportation usage and spread within a city.

The Partnership for Sustainable Communities, created by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department Of Transportation, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2009 was intended to encourage sustainable land use planning. This partnership helps to ensure that federal housing projects, transportation, and other neighborhood infrastructure would help residents live closer to jobs, while also reducing pollution since there would be less commute time. Over the past decade, this federal partnership has funded 1,066 projects across the 50 States, as well as Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. The total amount of grant money given to these projects has reached approximately $4.6 billion. Some of the programs that the partnership sponsors are the Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s “Sustainable Communities Regional Planning” and “Community Challenge Grant Programs”. These programs have made important strides in sustainable urban planning, with about 40 percent of U.S. citizens now having access to communities who were awarded these grants. Both of these programs make up $240 million in federal investment towards local land use planning efforts.

==Types of planning==

Various types of planning have emerged over the course of the 20th century. Below are the six main typologies of planning, as defined by David Walters in his book, &quot;Designing Communities&quot; (2007):

* &quot;Traditional or comprehensive planning&quot;: Common in the US after World War II, characterized by politically neutral experts with a rational view of the new urban development. Focused on producing clear statements about the form and content of new development.
* &quot;Systems planning&quot;: 1950s–1970s, resulting from the failure of comprehensive planning to deal with the unforeseen growth of post World War II America. More analytical view of the planning area as a set of complex processes, less interested in a physical plan.
* &quot;Democratic planning&quot;: 1960s. Result of societal loosening of class and race barriers. Gave more citizens a voice in planning for future of community.
* &quot;Advocacy and equity planning&quot;: 1960s &amp; 70s. Strands of democratic planning that sought specifically to address social issues of inequality and injustice in community planning.
* &quot;Strategic planning&quot;: 1960s-present. Recognizes small-scale objectives and pragmatic real-world constraints.
* &quot;Environmental planning&quot;: 1960s–present. Developed as many of the ecological and social implications of global development were first widely understood.

Today, successful planning involves a balanced mix of analysis of the existing conditions and constraints; extensive public engagement; practical planning and design; and financially and politically feasible strategies for implementation.

Current processes include a combination of strategic and environmental planning. It is becoming more widely understood that any sector of land has a certain capacity for supporting human, animal, and vegetative life in harmony, and that upsetting this balance has dire consequences on the environment. Planners and citizens often take on an advocacy role during the planning process in an attempt to influence public policy.

Since the 1990s, the activist/environmentalist approach to planning has grown into the Smart Growth movement, characterized by the focus on more sustainable and less environmentally damaging forms of development. Moreover, there is changes on the requirements of land use planning overtime. For example, whilst most of the urban planners suggest the distance from the landfill that a housing estate should be built, they must also take wind direction into consideration 

Smart growth supports the integration of mixed land uses into communities as a critical component of achieving better places to live. Putting uses in close proximity to one another has benefits for transportation alternatives to driving, security, community cohesiveness, local economies, and general quality of life issues. Smart growth strives to provide a means for communities to alter the planning context which currently renders mixed land uses illegal in most of the country.

==Methods==

&quot;Professional planners&quot; work in the public sector for governmental and non-profit agencies, and in the private sector for businesses related to land, community, and economic development. Through research, design, and analysis of data, a planner&#x27;s work is to create a plan for some aspect of a community. This process typically involves gathering public input to develop the vision and goals for the community.

A charrette is a facilitated planning workshop often used by professional planners to gather information from their clients and the public about the project at hand. Charettes involve a diverse set of stakeholders in the planning process, to ensure that the final plan comprehensively addresses the study area.

Geographic information systems, or GIS, are very useful and important tools in land use planning. It uses aerial photography to show land parcels, topography, street names, and other pertinent information. GIS systems contain layers of graphic information and their relational databases that may be projected into maps that allow the user to view a composite of a specific area, adding an array of graphically oriented decision making tools to the planning process.

A transect, as used in planning, is a hierarchical scale of environmental zones that define a land area by its character, ranging from rural, preserved land to urban centers. As a planning methodology, the transect is used as a tool for managing growth and sustainability by planning land use around the physical character of the land. This allows a community to plan for growth while preserving the natural and historical nature of their environment.

Natural ecology and historical identity of the city are matched to its topography in the Urban Landscape System approach that intends to mitigate effects of climate change and improve city branding through the ontology of place.

Another approach to land use planning is the use of &quot;traditional and local knowledge,&quot; or TLK, or local, Indigenous, and place-bound ways of knowing. Categories of TLK include 1) knowledge about the environment, 2) knowledge about the current use of areas, 3) knowledge of management systems, 4) values associate with the environment (i.e., spirituality and culture). There is growing literature about how to effectively incorporate and represent TLK in land use and management plans.

==Basis of land use planning authority in the United States ==
Police power is the basis for land use planning authority in the United States. This authority is usually delegated by state governments to local governments, including counties and cities. It is these local governments that most frequently exercise police power in land use planning matters. The regulation of land use based on police power is distinct from the taking of private property by the government through the power of eminent domain. If the regulation of land use is done under the authority of the police power, the private property owner isn&#x27;t typically entitled to compensation as they would be if property was taken under the power of eminent domain. The court decision in the case Commonwealth v. Alger was related to land use planning and dealt with the construction of a wharf on privately owned tidelands around Boston Harbor.

== Practical examples ==

=== Milan ===
Milan city is located in northern Italy. It is the second most populous city in the country after Rome with a population of over 4 million (The CBD and its metropolitan Boroughs).

Every area in Milan is a segment that starts from the center and reaches the city limits, so that central areas and peripheral areas are part of the same area. In Milan, zones are not identified by names but numbers. The city hall area 1 of Milan includes the entire historical center, starting from the geographical center of Milan in Piazza Duomo up to the Cerchia dei Bastioni. The town hall area 2 goes from Piazza della Repubblica to Crescenzago, Turro, Greco and Precotto. The town hall 3 goes from Porta Venezia to Lambrate, passing through Città Studi.
The town hall area 4 goes from Porta Vittoria to the Forlanini park, also including Porta Romana, Corvetto and Santa Giulia. The town hall 5 goes from Porta Ticinese to the Agricultural Park, passing through Chiesa Rossa and Gratosoglio. The town hall 6 goes from the Darsena, up to Barona, Lorenteggio and Giambellino. The city hall area 7 goes from Porta Magenta to Baggio and Figino passing through San Siro. The town hall zone 8 goes from Porta Volta to Quarto Oggiaro, passing through QT8 and Gallaratese. And lastly, the town hall area 9 goes from Porta Nuova to Niguarda and Bovisa. The idea here, is to allow members of the nine zones to get easy access to the CBD. Effective measures have been put in place to limit the impact of human activities on the many water bodies in this city such as restricting land development in riparian areas. In fact, the drive for the establishment of the city on the land where it stands was easy accessibility to water.

=== Indigenous communities ===
Land use planning is an important method for sustainable development for Indigenous communities. Indigenous peoples in the United States and Canada often have fragmented or diminishing land bases with limited uses. Oftentimes, these land bases are also far from urban centers and with limited expansion ability. Since European settlers first began colonizing the American Continent, Indigenous peoples have lost 98.9% of their land, a Yale study found. The lands indigenous peoples were forced onto are facing current and future climate-change related risks. This fact leads to the perpetuation of systematic inequity for Indigenous peoples, since livelihoods, preservation of culture and tradition, access to adequate housing, and access to resources are all factors that are deeply rooted in land. Many Indigenous groups are embracing land use planning to determine the future of their territories. In Canada, for example, the Dehcho First Nations have developed a land use plan that honors cultural traditions and Elders&#x27; knowledge, and incorporates conservation, development zones, and other categories. This plan, which has been extensively researched, can serve as an excellent model for other Indigenous Nations, and for cities and areas across North America.

=== Examples in the Global South ===
While most of the examples discussed in this article were drawn from cities in the Global North, land use planning has been employed in cities all over the world. The Global North has traditionally been dominant in planning theory and practice. However, as the world continues to quickly urbanize, and the global population increases, most of the new global population growth is occurring in cities in the developing world, or the Global South. Many of the assumptions about land use planning do not hold true elsewhere in the world, especially as developing nations face urbanization at a more rapid scale than most countries in the Global North. In India, for example, land use planning, specifically as it pertains to siting industries, has been incorporated into the nation&#x27;s constitution, and is controlled by the State and Federal levels of government.

=== The future of land use planning ===
Due to the increasing discussions in the issues of climate change and global warming, the future of land use planning will be dominated by environmental sustainability themes more than economic convenience. Also, due to the fact that the world is quickly urbanizing, and this massive population growth is mostly occurring in cities in the Global South, some of the assumptions we have formed about land use planning must be reimagined, as common theory and practice is no longer always relevant to those cities that are currently practicing land use planning.

<text>Henri de Montmorency, 4th Duke of Montmorency (1595 – 30 October 1632) was a French nobleman and military commander. Made Grand admiral in 1612, governor of Languedoc in 1614, and by 1620 was viceroy of New France. Despite defeating a Protestant fleet and seizing islands of Re and Oleron, Cardinal Richelieu kept him from taking advantage of these victories. Henri defeated the Duke of Rohan in Languedoc during 1628-1629. He gained notoriety as a military commander in Piedmont during the War of the Mantuan Succession in 1630. Joining the forces of Gaston, Duke of Orleans (the king&#x27;s brother), Henri raised an army and was severely wounded at Battle of Castelnaudary. Captured, he was executed on 30 October 1632, by a guillotine-like device.

==Life and career==
Born at Chantilly, Oise, Henri was the son of Henri de Montmorency, 3rd Duke of Montmorency, and his second wife, Louise de Budos. He was the godson of King Henri IV and was constantly receiving marks of the royal affection. Henri&#x27;s name and his personality rendered him at an early age the darling of the court and the people. By 1612, he was raised to the office of Grand Admiral. Henri succeeded to his father&#x27;s title of Duke of Montmorency in 1614 and was also governor of Languedoc. With influence from Marie de Medici, he married Maria Felicia Orsini, an Italian noblewoman. In 1620, he was made viceroy of New France, a post he held until 1625.

Henri wrested several important places from the Protestants and was present at the sieges of Montauban and Montpellier. On the renewal of the civil war in 1625, the fleet sent from Holland to aid the French king was placed under his command. In 1625, Henri defeated the French Protestant fleet under Soubise and seized the islands of Ré and Oleron, but the jealousy of Cardinal Richelieu deprived him of the means of following up these advantages.

In 1628–1629, Henri took command of a royal army to fight the forces of Henri, Duc de Rohan, in Languedoc, and he bested that famous leader of the Huguenots.

In 1630, Henri won renown as a military leader in the war against the Spaniards in Piedmont (Italy). He defeated the Piedmontese at the Battle of Avigliana, where he charged across a ditch at the head of the gendarmes of the king, captured Carlo Doria, the enemy general, with his own hand, and fought like a common soldier until the enemy was completely driven from the field. This victory was followed by the raising of the siege of Casal and the taking of Saluzzo. For these achievements, he was appointed a Marshal of France later in the same year.

At the height of his fame and influence, he was solicited to join the opponents of Cardinal Richelieu, Louis XIII&#x27;s chief minister. Disliking Richelieu&#x27;s attempts to rein in the influence of his class, in 1632, using his position as governor of Languedoc, he raised levies of troops and money, joined the party of Gaston, Duke of Orleans (the king&#x27;s brother) and took command of an army of six or seven thousand.

Negotiation was tried in vain; Henri was confronted and defeated by Marshal Schomberg at the Battle of Castelnaudary (1 September 1632). Trying to emulate his victory at Avigliana, Henri led a charge into the royal camp at the head of a few horsemen. He cut his way through six ranks of infantry amidst a continuing shower of shot and fought against overwhelming numbers, until his horse dropped dead. Severely wounded, he was captured.

Abandoned by Gaston, he was doomed to death by the remorseless Richelieu, as an example to the rest of the plotting nobility. In vain his life was begged for by all ranks throughout France. The only palliation of punishment that could be obtained from Louis XIII was that the execution should be in private. Henri was therefore beheaded in Toulouse&#x27;s town hall 30 October 1632, by a guillotine-like device (according to the memoirs of Jacques, vicomte de Puysegur). His title passed to his sister, Charlotte Marguerite, Princess of Condé.

<doc id="603916" wikidata="Q1609490" url="?curid=603916" title="Kähler differential">
<text>In mathematics, Kähler differentials provide an adaptation of differential forms to arbitrary commutative rings or schemes. The notion was introduced by Erich Kähler in the 1930s. It was adopted as standard in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry somewhat later, once the need was felt to adapt methods from calculus and geometry over the complex numbers to contexts where such methods are not available.

==Definition==
Let and be commutative rings and be a ring homomorphism. An important example is for a field and a unital algebra over (such as the coordinate ring of an affine variety). Kähler differentials formalize the observation that the derivatives of polynomials are again polynomial. In this sense, differentiation is a notion which can be expressed in purely algebraic terms. This observation can be turned into a definition of the module

:formula_1

of differentials in different, but equivalent ways.

===Definition using derivations===
An -linear &quot;derivation&quot; on is an -module homomorphism formula_2 to an -module satisfying the Leibniz rule formula_3 (it automatically follows from this definition that the image of is in the kernel of ). The module of Kähler differentials is defined as the -module formula_1 for which there is a universal derivation formula_5. As with other universal properties, this means that is the &quot;best possible&quot; derivation in the sense that any other derivation may be obtained from it by composition with an -module homomorphism. In other words, the composition with provides, for every , an -module isomorphism

:formula_6

One construction of and proceeds by constructing a free -module with one formal generator for each in , and imposing the relations 
*,
for all in and all and in . The universal derivation sends to . The relations imply that the universal derivation is a homomorphism of -modules.

===Definition using the augmentation ideal===
Another construction proceeds by letting be the ideal in the tensor product formula_7 defined as the kernel of the multiplication map

:formula_8

Then the module of Kähler differentials of can be equivalently defined by

:formula_9

and the universal derivation is the homomorphism defined by

:formula_10

This construction is equivalent to the previous one because is the kernel of the projection

:formula_11

Thus we have:

:formula_12

Then formula_13 may be identified with by the map induced by the complementary projection

:formula_14

This identifies with the -module generated by the formal generators for in , subject to being a homomorphism of -modules which sends each element of to zero. Taking the quotient by precisely imposes the Leibniz rule.

==Examples and basic facts==

For any commutative ring , the Kähler differentials of the polynomial ring formula_15 are a free -module of rank &quot;n&quot; generated by the differentials of the variables:

:formula_16

Kähler differentials are compatible with extension of scalars, in the sense that for a second -algebra and formula_17, there is an isomorphism

:formula_18

As a particular case of this, Kähler differentials are compatible with localizations, meaning that if is a multiplicative set in , then there is an isomorphism

:formula_19

Given two ring homomorphisms formula_20, there is a short exact sequence of -modules

:formula_21

If formula_22 for some ideal , the term formula_23 vanishes and the sequence can be continued at the left as follows:

:formula_24

A generalization of these two short exact sequences is provided by the cotangent complex.

The latter sequence and the above computation for the polynomial ring allows the computation of the Kähler differentials of finitely generated -algebras formula_25. Briefly, these are generated by the differentials of the variables and have relations coming from the differentials of the equations. For example, for a single polynomial in a single variable,

:formula_26

==Kähler differentials for schemes==
Because Kähler differentials are compatible with localization, they may be constructed on a general scheme by performing either of the two definitions above on affine open subschemes and gluing. However, the second definition has a geometric interpretation that globalizes immediately. In this interpretation, represents the &quot;ideal defining the diagonal&quot; in the fiber product of with itself over . This construction therefore has a more geometric flavor, in the sense that the notion of &quot;first infinitesimal neighbourhood&quot; of the diagonal is thereby captured, via functions vanishing modulo functions vanishing at least to second order (see cotangent space for related notions). Moreover, it extends to a general morphism of schemes formula_27 by setting formula_28 to be the ideal of the diagonal in the fiber product formula_29. The &quot;cotangent sheaf&quot; formula_30, together with the derivation formula_31 defined analogously to before, is universal among formula_32-linear derivations of formula_33-modules. If is an open affine subscheme of whose image in is contained in an open affine subscheme , then the cotangent sheaf restricts to a sheaf on which is similarly universal. It is therefore the sheaf associated to the module of Kähler differentials for the rings underlying and .

Similar to the commutative algebra case, there exist exact sequences associated to morphisms of schemes. Given morphisms formula_34 and formula_35 of schemes there is an exact sequence of sheaves on formula_36

:formula_37

Also, if formula_38 is a closed subscheme given by the ideal sheaf formula_28, then formula_40 and there is an exact sequence of sheaves on formula_36

:formula_42

=== Examples ===

==== Finite separable field extensions ====
If formula_43 is a finite field extension, then formula_44 if and only if formula_43 is separable. Consequently, if formula_43 is a finite separable field extension and formula_47 is a smooth variety (or scheme), then the relative cotangent sequence

:formula_48

proves formula_49.

==== Cotangent modules of a projective variety ====
Given a projective scheme formula_50, its cotangent sheaf can be computed from the sheafification of the cotangent module on the underlying graded algebra. For example, consider the complex curve

:formula_51

then we can compute the cotangent module as

:formula_52

Then,

:formula_53

==== Morphisms of schemes ====
Consider the morphism

:formula_54

in formula_55. Then, using the first sequence we see that

:formula_56

hence

:formula_57

==Higher differential forms and algebraic de Rham cohomology==

===de Rham complex===
As before, fix a map formula_58. Differential forms of higher degree are defined as the exterior powers (over formula_59),

:formula_60

The derivation formula_61 extends in a natural way to a sequence of maps

:formula_62

satisfying formula_63 This is a cochain complex known as the &quot;de Rham complex&quot;.

The de Rham complex enjoys an additional multiplicative structure, the wedge product

:formula_64

This turns the de Rham complex into a commutative differential graded algebra. It also has a coalgebra structure inherited from the one on the exterior algebra.

===de Rham cohomology===

The hypercohomology of the de Rham complex of sheaves is called the &quot;algebraic de Rham cohomology&quot; of over and is denoted by formula_65 or just formula_66 if is clear from the context. (In many situations, is the spectrum of a field of characteristic zero.) Algebraic de Rham cohomology was introduced by . It is closely related to crystalline cohomology.

As is familiar from coherent cohomology of other quasi-coherent sheaves, the computation of de Rham cohomology is simplified when and are affine schemes. In this case, because affine schemes have no higher cohomology, formula_65 can be computed as the cohomology of the complex of abelian groups

:formula_68

which is, termwise, the global sections of the sheaves formula_69.

To take a very particular example, suppose that formula_70 is the multiplicative group over formula_71 Because this is an affine scheme, hypercohomology reduces to ordinary cohomology. The algebraic de Rham complex is

:formula_72

The differential obeys the usual rules of calculus, meaning formula_73 The kernel and cokernel compute algebraic de Rham cohomology, so

:formula_74

and all other algebraic de Rham cohomology groups are zero. By way of comparison, the algebraic de Rham cohomology groups of formula_75 are much larger, namely,

:formula_76

Since the Betti numbers of these cohomology groups are not what is expected, crystalline cohomology was developed to remedy this issue; it defines a Weil cohomology theory over finite fields.

===Grothendieck&#x27;s comparison theorem===
If is a smooth complex algebraic variety, there is a natural comparison map of complexes of sheaves

:formula_77

between the algebraic de Rham complex and the smooth de Rham complex defined in terms of (complex-valued) differential forms on formula_78, the complex manifold associated to &quot;X&quot;. Here, formula_79 denotes the complex analytification functor. This map is far from being an isomorphism. Nonetheless, showed that the comparison map induces an isomorphism

:formula_80

from algebraic to smooth de Rham cohomology (and thus to singular cohomology formula_81 by de Rham&#x27;s theorem). In particular, if &quot;X&quot; is a smooth affine algebraic variety embedded in formula_82, then the inclusion of the subcomplex of algebraic differential forms into that of all smooth forms on &quot;X&quot; is a quasi-isomorphism. For example, if 

:formula_83, 

then as shown above, the computation of algebraic de Rham cohomology gives explicit generators formula_84 for formula_85 and formula_86, respectively, while all other cohomology groups vanish. Since &quot;X&quot; is homotopy equivalent to a circle, this is as predicted by Grothendieck&#x27;s theorem. 

Counter-examples in the singular case can be found with non-Du Bois singularities such as the graded ring formula_87 with formula_88 where formula_89 and formula_90. Other counterexamples can be found in algebraic plane curves with isolated singularities whose Milnor and Tjurina numbers are non-equal.

A proof of Grothendieck&#x27;s theorem using the concept of a mixed Weil cohomology theory was given by . 

==Applications==

===Canonical divisor===
If is a smooth variety over a field , then formula_91 is a vector bundle (i.e., a locally free formula_59-module) of rank equal to the dimension of . This implies, in particular, that

:formula_93

is a line bundle or, equivalently, a divisor. It is referred to as the &quot;canonical divisor&quot;. The canonical divisor is, as it turns out, a dualizing complex and therefore appears in various important theorems in algebraic geometry such as Serre duality or Verdier duality.

===Classification of algebraic curves===
The geometric genus of a smooth algebraic variety of dimension over a field is defined as the dimension

:formula_94

For curves, this purely algebraic definition agrees with the topological definition (for formula_95) as the &quot;number of handles&quot; of the Riemann surface associated to &quot;X&quot;. There is a rather sharp trichotomy of geometric and arithmetic properties depending on the genus of a curve, for being 0 (rational curves), 1 (elliptic curves), and greater than 1 (hyperbolic Riemann surfaces, including hyperelliptic curves), respectively.

===Tangent bundle and Riemann–Roch theorem===
The tangent bundle of a smooth variety is, by definition, the dual of the cotangent sheaf formula_91. The Riemann–Roch theorem and its far-reaching generalization, the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem, contain as a crucial ingredient the Todd class of the tangent bundle.

===Unramified and smooth morphisms===
The sheaf of differentials is related to various algebro-geometric notions. A morphism formula_97 of schemes is unramified if and only if formula_98 is zero. A special case of this assertion is that for a field , formula_99 is separable over iff formula_100, which can also be read off the above computation.

A morphism of finite type is a smooth morphism if it is flat and if formula_98 is a locally free formula_59-module of appropriate rank. The computation of formula_103 above shows that the projection from affine space formula_104 is smooth.

===Periods===
&quot;Periods&quot; are, broadly speaking, integrals of certain arithmetically defined differential forms. The simplest example of a period is formula_105, which arises as

:formula_106

Algebraic de Rham cohomology is used to construct periods as follows: For an algebraic variety defined over formula_107 the above-mentioned compatibility with base-change yields a natural isomorphism

:formula_108

On the other hand, the right hand cohomology group is isomorphic to de Rham cohomology of the complex manifold formula_78 associated to , denoted here formula_110 Yet another classical result, de Rham&#x27;s theorem, asserts an isomorphism of the latter cohomology group with singular cohomology (or sheaf cohomology) with complex coefficients, formula_111, which by the universal coefficient theorem is in its turn isomorphic to formula_112 Composing these isomorphisms yields two &quot;rational&quot; vector spaces which, after tensoring with formula_113 become isomorphic. Choosing bases of these rational subspaces (also called lattices), the determinant of the base-change matrix is a complex number, well defined up to multiplication by a rational number. Such numbers are &quot;periods&quot;.

===Algebraic number theory===
In algebraic number theory, Kähler differentials may be used to study the ramification in an extension of algebraic number fields. If is a finite extension with rings of integers and respectively then the different ideal , which encodes the ramification data, is the annihilator of the -module :

:formula_114

==Related notions==
Hochschild homology is a homology theory for associative rings that turns out to be closely related to Kähler differentials. This is because of the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem which states that the Hochschild homology formula_115 of an algebra of a smooth variety is isomorphic to the de-Rham complex formula_116 for formula_117 a field of characteristic formula_118. A derived enhancement of this theorem states that the Hochschild homology of a differential graded algebra is isomorphic to the derived de-Rham complex.

The de Rham–Witt complex is, in very rough terms, an enhancement of the de Rham complex for the ring of Witt vectors.

<text>The Canadian province of Ontario has several historic counties, which are past census divisions that no longer exist today. Most historic counties either merged with other counties, or became regional municipalities or single-tier municipalities. Although counties had existed prior to 1849, after 1849 they replaced the district systems in administering local government and courts in Ontario.

The county system is used in southern, southwestern and eastern sections of the province of Ontario. There are no counties in Northern Ontario due to sparse population and a long-standing boundary dispute with the Northwest Territories (that was not resolved until 1912).

==Counties==
*Addington County (1792–1864) merged with Lennox County to form Lennox and Addington County
*Brant County (established 1852) split into the single-tier &#x27;county&#x27; of Brant and the city of Brantford
*Carleton County (1800–1969) became the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, now the City of Ottawa, a single-tier municipality.
*Dufferin County (established 1881) created from parts of Simcoe, Grey and Waterloo counties.
*Durham County (1792–1973) portions merged with Ontario County to form Durham Regional Municipality. Remaining portions joined Northumberland, Peterborough and Victoria Counties.
*Grenville County (1792–1850) merged with Leeds County to form Leeds and Grenville United Counties
*Kent County (1792–1998) became the single-tier Municipality of Chatham-Kent
*Haldimand County (1800–1974; 2001–present) was merged into the Regional Municipality of Haldimand-Norfolk for many years, but this was divided again with some minor adjustments to the old lines in 2001; it is now a single-tier municipality, not an official county
*Halton County (1816–1973) became Halton Regional Municipality
*Leeds County (1792–1850) merged with Grenville County to form Leeds and Grenville United Counties
*Lennox County (1792–1864) merged with Addington County to form Lennox and Addington County
*Lincoln County (1792–1970) merged with Welland County to form Niagara Regional Municipality
*Norfolk County (1792–1974) was merged into the Regional Municipality of Haldimand-Norfolk for many years, but this was divided again with some minor adjustments to the old lines in 2001; it is now a single-tier municipality, not an official county
*Ontario County a short-lived first county with this name existed from 1792 to 1800, and was split with the eastern portion joining Frontenac County and the western portion joining Addington County. The second existed from 1852 to 1973, and merged with portions of Durham County to form Durham Regional Municipality. A small portion became part of Simcoe County.
*Peel County (1851–1973) became Peel Regional Municipality
*Prescott County (1800–1820) merged with Russell County to form Prescott and Russell United Counties
*Prince Edward County (established 1792) has retained its name, but is now a single-tier municipality, not an official county
*Russell County (1800–1820) merged with Prescott County to form Prescott and Russell United Counties
*Suffolk County (1792–1800) formed in 1792 with Ontario County, in 1800 it was split into the Counties of Kent, Elgin and Middlesex. During its short existence it was made up of Delaware Township, Westminster Township, most of North Dorchester Township and the rest Indian land.
*Victoria County (1821–2001) became the City of Kawartha Lakes, a single-tier municipality.
*Welland County (1851–1970) merged with Lincoln County to form Niagara Regional Municipality
*Waterloo County (1853–1973) became Waterloo Regional Municipality in 1973
*Wentworth County (1816–1970) became Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Municipality, now the City of Hamilton, a single-tier municipality.
*York County (1792–1971) saw Metropolitan Toronto (now the City of Toronto) separate from it in 1953, and the remainder became York Regional Municipality in 1971

Various counties throughout Ontario were joined administratively in the 19th century. While many of these still exist today and have become relatively permanent, some have since been dissolved. For example, the former United Counties of Huron and Perth existed for only a few years in the 19th century. The United Counties of Northumberland and Durham, on the other hand, merged eight years after each one was created, and continued for 174 years up until the dissolution of Durham County on January 1, 1974.

==Special cases==

Four of Ontario&#x27;s electoral districts were also erroneously listed as counties of residence in some of Canada&#x27;s first post-Confederation censuses. These did not exist as counties in the political sense, although they may be referred to as such in some historical and genealogical works because of their appearances in census data:

*Bothwell was made up of townships from Kent and Lambton counties.
*Cardwell was made up of townships from Simcoe and Peel counties.
*Monck was made up of townships from Lincoln, Haldimand, and Welland Counties.
*Niagara was made up of townships from Lincoln County.

The Regional Municipality of Sudbury can also be considered &#x27;historic&#x27;, as it later became the City of Greater Sudbury — however, its origins are not in county government, but as a part of the still-extant Sudbury District.

The unincorporated Patricia District, comprising the portion of Northwestern Ontario which was transferred to Ontario from the Northwest Territories in 1912, existed until 1937 when it was merged into Kenora District.

<text>Edward Goderich &quot;Carji&quot; Greeves Jr. (1 November 1903 – 15 April 1963) was an Australian rules footballer who played for the Geelong Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL), now known as the Australian Football League (AFL). He won the inaugural Brownlow Medal in 1924, awarded to the VFL/AFL player adjudged fairest and best during the home-and-away season. He is the son of Ted Greeves, who also played with the Geelong Football Club.

Greeves is the namesake of the Carji Greeves Medal, the Geelong Football Club&#x27;s best and fairest award.

==Family and personal life==
In the 1860s, Greeves&#x27; grandmother Julie (née Anderson) was briefly engaged to Tom Wills, the famed cricketer and founder of Australian rules football. Historian Col Hutchinson noted that &quot;If Tom Wills had married Julie, we wouldn&#x27;t have had Carji Greeves&quot;.

Greeves was given the nickname &quot;Carji&quot; as a baby by a friend of the family, the New South Wales golfer Michael Scott, most likely after a character in &quot;A Country Girl&quot;, a popular musical play of the day.

Greeves also attended The Geelong College after receiving his early education at the Struan Dam School, South of Lismore, Victoria, where he was a schoolmate of Geelong champion Reg Hickey.

==VFL career==

Greeves played with the Geelong Football Club from 1923 to 1931 and wore jumper number 20.

Greeves was honoured with having the Geelong Football Club&#x27;s best-and-fairest award named after him, the Carji Greeves Medal. In 1996, Greeves was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. He also won the first Brownlow Medal, the award given to the player deemed to be the &quot;fairest and best.&quot; &quot;Best&quot; refers to the players being voted upon by officials for who was best on ground, and &quot;fairest&quot; means that the player did not serve a suspension during the competition.

Greeves represented Victoria in interstate matches seven times.

==Post Football==
Greeves kicking prowess had him head hunted by college football club UCLA in 1928 as a kicking coach and he moved to the United States. He would study at Stanford University, where he coached students there in Australian Rules.

From the 1930s, Greeves suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis and emphysema. He died on 15 April 1963 at the age of 59.

Since 2004, The &#x27;Carji&#x27; Greeves Club is the name of the Football Parents&#x27; Support Club at The Geelong College.

<text>Sergey Nazarovych Bubka (; &quot;Serhiy Nazarovych Bubka&quot;; born 4 December 1963) is a Ukrainian former pole vaulter. He represented the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. Bubka was twice named Athlete of the Year by &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot;, and in 2012 was one of 24 athletes inducted as inaugural members of the International Association of Athletics Federations Hall of Fame.

Bubka won six consecutive IAAF World Championships, an Olympic gold medal, and broke the world record for men&#x27;s pole vault 35 times. He was the first pole vaulter to clear 6.0 meters and 6.10 meters.

He held the indoor world record of 6.15 meters, set on 21 February 1993 in Donetsk, Ukraine for almost 21 years until France&#x27;s Renaud Lavillenie cleared 6.16 meters on February 15, 2014, at the same meet in the same arena. He held the outdoor world record at 6.14 meters between July 31, 1994, and September 17, 2020.

Bubka is Senior Vice President of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), serving since 2007, and served as President of the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine from 2005 to November 2022. He is also an Honorary Member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), having been involved since 1996. His older brother, Vasiliy Bubka, was also a medal-winning pole vaulter.

==Biography==
Born in Luhansk, Sergey Nazarovych Bubka was a track-and-field athlete in the 100-meter dash and the long jump, but became a world-class champion only when he turned to the pole vault. In 1983, he won the world championship in Helsinki, Finland, and the following year set his first world record, clearing 5.85m (19 ft 2 in). Until the dissolution of the USSR in late 1991, Bubka competed for Soviet teams. By 1992, he was no longer bound to the Soviet system, and signed a contract with Nike. that rewarded each world record performance with special bonuses of $40,000.

His son, Sergei Bubka (tennis) is a former professional tennis player.

From 2002 to 2006, Bubka was a member of the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada with the Party of Regions group and until 2014 an advisor to Viktor Yanukovych. He was on the youth policy, physical culture, sport and tourism committee while a MVR.

Bubka has been linked to business conducted in Ukraine’s Russian-occupied territories. On 5 March 2022, Bubka professed his love for his homeland after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and declared: &quot;Ukraine will win&quot;.

==Sporting career==

Sergey Bubka started competing on the international athletics scene in 1981 when he participated in the European Junior Championship finishing seventh. But the 1983 World Championship held in Helsinki was his actual entry point to the world athletics, where a relatively unknown Bubka snatched the gold, clearing 5.70 meters (18 feet 8 inches). The years that followed witnessed the unparalleled dominance of Bubka, with him setting new records and standards in pole vaulting.

He set his first world record of 5.85m on 26 May 1984 which he improved to 5.88m a week later, and then to 5.90m a month later. He cleared 6.00 meters (19 feet 8 inches) for the first time on 13 July 1985 in Paris. Bubka improved his own record over the next 10 years until he reached his career best and the then world record of 6.14 m (20 feet 1 inches) in 1994. He vaulted on UCS Spirit poles throughout his later career.

He became the first athlete ever to jump over 6.10 meters, in San Sebastián, Spain in 1991. Bubka increased the world record by 21 centimeters (8 inches) in the period from 1984 to 1994. He cleared 6.00 meters or better on 45 occasions.

Bubka officially retired from pole vault in 2001 during a ceremony at his Pole Vault Stars meeting in Donetsk.

=== Olympics curse ===
The first Olympics after Bubka&#x27;s introduction to the international athletics was held in 1984 and was boycotted by the USSR along with the majority of other Eastern Bloc countries. In 1988 Bubka competed in the Seoul Olympics and won his only Olympic gold medal clearing 5.90 meters. In 1992 he failed to clear in his first three attempts (5.70, 5.70, 5.75 meters) and was out of the Barcelona Olympics. At the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, a heel injury caused him to withdraw from the competition without any attempts. In 2000 at the Sydney Olympics, he was eliminated from the final after three unsuccessful attempts at 5.70 meters.

=== IAAF World championships ===
Bubka won the pole vault event in six consecutive IAAF World Championships in Athletics in the period from 1983 to 1997:

=== World record progression ===
Bubka broke the world record for men&#x27;s pole vault 35 times during his career. He broke the outdoor world record 17 times and the indoor world record 18 times. Bubka lost his outdoor world record only once in his career. After Thierry Vigneron, of France, broke his record on August 31, 1984 at the Golden Gala international track meet in Rome, Bubka subsequently reclaimed the record on his next attempt on the same runway minutes later.



===Technique===

Bubka gripped the pole higher than most vaulters to get extra leverage, though Bubka himself played down the effect of grip alone.

His development of the Petrov/Bubka technical model is also considered a key to his success. The Petrov/Bubka model allows the vaulter to continuously put energy into the pole while rising towards the bar. Most conventional models focus on creating maximum bend in the pole before leaving the ground, by planting the pole heavily in the pole vault box. The Petrov/Bubka model follows the technique used by Kjell Isaksson, which concentrates on driving the pole up, rather than bending it while planting it on the landing pad, combined with high running speed. While the traditional models depended on the recoil by bending the pole, the Petrov/Bubka model may exploit the recoil of the pole and exert more energy on the pole during the swinging action.

== Geography ==

Mooloolaba is bounded on the east by the Coral Sea, on the south by the Mooloolah River, on the north by Alexandra Headland and to the west by Buderim. Mooloolaba Harbour (near the mouth of the Mooloolah River, ) is the home of a large fleet of fishing vessels, as well as being the northern base for the pilot vessels that control shipping through Moreton Bay and the Port of Brisbane. Due to its sheltered location in the lee of Point Cartwright, it is an all-weather harbour favoured by recreational sailors.

The esplanade facing Mooloolaba beach is a centre for tourist activity, containing the Sea Life marine park, as well as many souvenir and clothing shops, bookshops, galleries and restaurants. Behind the apartments facing the Mooloolaba Beach () are camping grounds, backpacker hostels and canal villas. It is also a tourism destination, with cruise ships regularly anchoring outside the port.

In September 1954, Archbishop Reginald Halse performed a stump-capping ceremony for the new Anglican church at Mooloolaba. St Elizabeth&#x27;s Anglican Church was dedicated on 2 November 1954 by Archbishop Halse. Its closure on 2 April 2006 was approved by Venerable R N Gowty, Archdeacon of Wide Bay. The congregation had dwindled to 17 people and a property developer offered a sum for the block in First Avenue (approx ) described as &quot;safely estimated to be in the millions&quot; to combine the church land with other parcels to build a high-rise residential development. The plan was to combine St Elizabeth&#x27;s with St Peter&#x27;s Anglican in Maroochydore and have only one Anglican church in the area.

<text>Mesosomes or chondrioids are folded invaginations in the plasma membrane of bacteria that are produced by the chemical fixation techniques used to prepare samples for electron microscopy. Although several functions were proposed for these structures in the 1960s, they were recognized as artifacts by the late 1970s and are no longer considered to be part of the normal structure of bacterial cells. These extensions are in the form of vesicles, tubules and lamellae.

==Initial observations==
These structures are invaginations of the plasma membrane observed in gram-positive bacteria that have been chemically fixed to prepare them for electron microscopy. They were first observed in 1953 by George B. Chapman and James Hillier, who referred to them as &quot;peripheral bodies.&quot; They were termed &quot;mesosomes&quot; by Fitz-James in 1960.

Initially, it was thought that mesosomes might play a role in several cellular processes, such as cell wall formation during cell division, chromosome replication, or as a site for oxidative phosphorylation. The mesosome was thought to increase the surface area of the cell, aiding the cell in cellular respiration. This is analogous to cristae in the mitochondrion in eukaryotic cells, which are finger-like projections and help eukaryotic cells undergo cellular respiration. Mesosomes were also hypothesized to aid in photosynthesis, cell division, DNA replication, and cell compartmentalisation.

==Disproof of hypothesis==
These models were called into question during the late 1970s when data accumulated suggesting that mesosomes are artifacts formed through damage to the membrane during the process of chemical fixation, and do not occur in cells that have not been chemically fixed. By the mid to late 1980s, with advances in cryofixation and freeze substitution methods for electron microscopy, it was generally concluded that mesosomes do not exist in living cells. However, a few researchers continue to argue that the evidence remains inconclusive, and that mesosomes might not be artifacts in all cases.

Recently, similar folds in the membrane have been observed in bacteria that have been exposed to some classes of antibiotics, and antibacterial peptides (defensins). The appearance of these mesosome-like structures may be the result of these chemicals damaging the plasma membrane and/or cell wall.

The case of the proposal and then disproof of the mesosome hypothesis has been discussed from the viewpoint of the philosophy of science as an example of how a scientific idea can be falsified and the hypothesis then rejected, and analyzed to explore how the scientific community carries out this testing process.

<doc id="603942" wikidata="Q10536" url="?curid=603942" title="John Barnes">
<text>John Charles Bryan Barnes (born 7 November 1963) is a former professional football player and manager. Often considered one of the greatest England players of all time, Barnes currently works as an author, as well as a commentator and pundit for ESPN and SuperSport. Initially a quick, skilful left winger, he moved to central midfield later in his career. Barnes won two League titles and two FA Cups with Liverpool. He was also an FA Cup runner-up with Watford, Liverpool and Newcastle United. He earned 79 international caps for England.

Barnes was born and raised in Jamaica as the son of a military officer from Trinidad and Tobago and a Jamaican mother. He moved to London, England, with his family when he was 12 years old. He joined Watford aged 17 in 1981, before playing 296 competitive games for them, scoring 85 goals. He debuted for England in 1983, and in 1987 joined Liverpool for £900,000. In his ten seasons there, Liverpool won the then-top-flight First Division twice and the FA Cup twice. He scored 106 goals in 403 matches. By the time of his last cap, in 1995, he had more caps than any other black England player. After two years at Newcastle United, he ended his playing career at Charlton Athletic in 1999. Barnes had eight months as Celtic head coach when his former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was director of football. He has since managed the Jamaica national team, in 2008–09, and English club Tranmere Rovers, for four months in 2009.

Barnes was the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year once (in 1987–88) and the Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year twice (in 1987–88 and 1989–90). In 2005, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame. In 2006, in a poll of Liverpool fans&#x27; favourite players, Barnes came fifth; a year later, &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine named him Liverpool&#x27;s best all-time player. In 2016, &quot;The Times&quot; readers voted him England&#x27;s greatest-ever left-footed player.

Barnes has published two books: &quot;John Barnes: The Autobiography&quot; (1999), which was followed by &quot;The Uncomfortable Truth About Racism&quot; (2021), both of which were met with a largely positive reception. In 2022, he returned to Liverpool as an official Club Ambassador.

==Early life==
Barnes was born in Jamaica, to Roderick Kenrick &quot;Ken&quot; Barnes (a Trinidadian) and Frances Jeanne Hill (a Jamaican). Ken Barnes hailed from Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago emigrating to Jamaica in 1956 as a member of the West India Regiment. He joined the Jamaica Defence Force when formed after the nation&#x27;s 1962 independence when he was initially commanding officer of the 1st Battalion Jamaica Regiment. In 1973, he was promoted to colonel remaining in the army until retiring in 1989. While in the army, he was a semi-professional footballer for a Jamaica National Premier League club and also captained the Jamaica national football team. Barnes spent his early childhood living in Jamaica&#x27;s biggest military base, playing football and living a disciplined life. His father was president of the Jamaica Amateur Swimming Association and later formed Jamaica&#x27;s first bobsleigh team.

Barnes&#x27; father was a huge squash and football fan who encouraged his son to pursue sports, having named him after Welsh footballer John Charles. Ken Barnes, who was promoted to Colonel in 1973, was appointed Defence adviser to the High Commission of Jamaica, London (1976–1981), and Barnes moved to London with his family in January 1976, when he was 12 years old. He attended the rugby-playing St Marylebone Grammar School then a short stint at Haverstock School, Camden Town. While at school he played four years of youth football at the Stowe Boys Club in Paddington.

==Club career==

===Watford===
Barnes was noticed by Watford as a teenager while playing for Middlesex League club Sudbury Court. After a successful trial game in Watford&#x27;s reserves, Barnes signed on 14 July 1981 for the fee of a set of kits.

Barnes debuted aged 17 as a substitute on 5 September 1981 in a Football League Second Division 1–1 home draw with Oldham Athletic. With manager Graham Taylor, Watford were eight months away from completing a five-year rise from the Fourth Division to the First.

Barnes quickly established himself as a regular player and scored 12 Second Division goals as Watford were promoted, as runners-up to fierce rivals Luton Town to the top flight of English football at the end of season 1981–82. Watford finished runners-up for the League title to Liverpool the season after. Watford lost the 1984 FA Cup final as under-dogs 2–0 to Everton. Watford lost a 1986–87 FA Cup semi-final to Tottenham Hotspur.

At the end of the 1986–87 season, Taylor called time on his 10-year spell as Watford manager to take charge at Aston Villa. His successor, Dave Bassett, resigned to losing Barnes to a bigger club, gave Alex Ferguson the chance to sign Barnes for Manchester United. Ferguson rejected the offer still having faith in United&#x27;s left winger Jesper Olsen. Ferguson later admitted that he regretted not signing Barnes, especially as Barnes helped extend Liverpool&#x27;s dominance in England by three seasons, while Olsen fell out of favour at Old Trafford and had left by the end of 1988, with his successors Ralph Milne and Danny Wallace failing to live up to expectations. Ferguson&#x27;s United waited until 1990 to win a major trophy and 1993 to win the league title. Barnes left Watford after scoring 65 goals in 233 league appearances.

===Liverpool===
Barnes arrived at Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s Liverpool in the same close season as England teammate Peter Beardsley and linked up with new signings John Aldridge and Ray Houghton. He signed for the club on 9 June 1987. He debuted for the &quot;Reds&quot; along with Beardsley on 15 August in the 2–1 league win at Arsenal at Highbury. After nine minutes, Barnes and Beardsley combined to set up Aldridge to score. Barnes&#x27; first Liverpool goal was on 12 September beating Oxford United 2–0 at Anfield.
In Barnes&#x27; first Liverpool season, they won the League title, remaining undefeated for the first twenty-nine games of the season. Barnes&#x27; fifteen Liverpool league goals in his first season there was second only to John Aldridge. The 2–1 defeat at Nottingham Forest on 2 April was the last of only two league defeats that season. Eleven days later, Barnes, Beardsley, Houghton and Aldridge were instrumental in Liverpool&#x27;s 5–0 home win over Forest described by Tom Finney as &quot;One of the finest exhibition I&#x27;ve seen the whole time I&#x27;ve played and watched the game. You couldn&#x27;t see it bettered anywhere, not even in Brazil.&quot; The double however was thwarted by Lawrie Sanchez&#x27; Wimbledon goal beating Liverpool 1–0 in the 1988 FA Cup final. Barnes was a key performer on the &quot;Anfield Rap&quot;; the club&#x27;s cup final song that UK charted at number 3. Barnes was voted PFA Player of the Year.

In the summer of 1988, Ian Rush re-signed for Liverpool. Following the death of 96 Liverpool fans in April 1989 as a result of the Hillsborough disaster, Barnes attended several funerals and visited the injured in hospital. He pulled out of an England international friendly in order to fulfil these public duties. Liverpool won the 1989 FA Cup final with a 3–2 victory over Merseyside rivals Everton, with Barnes creating goals from the left wing for Rush. In the 1988–89 title decider at Anfield, Arsenal&#x27;s Michael Thomas&#x27; 92nd minute, league winning goal occurred in their counter-attack 17 seconds after Barnes lost ball possession attempting to dribble past Kevin Richardson.

Barnes played in the 1990 title winning side at Liverpool and scored 22 league goals from the left wing – the highest goal tally of his career. Ian Rush scored four fewer league goals than Barnes. Barnes was voted Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year, and expectations from England manager Bobby Robson were also high, seeing Barnes as a key component in the buildup to the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Beardsley has since said Barnes at the end of the 1980s was &quot;The best player I ever played with, bar none. For three or four years at the end of the &#x27;80s, John was possibly the best player in the world.&quot;
Barnes continued to play regularly for Liverpool and England into the 1990s. In the 1990–91 season, he scored 16 league goals. Arsenal were league champions in the season of Dalglish&#x27;s resignation and his replacement by Graeme Souness as manager. Liverpool had qualified for the 1991–92 UEFA Cup, being readmitted to European competitions a year after the ban on all other English clubs in European competitions since the Heysel disaster in 1985 had been lifted. This was the first time Barnes had played in European competitions since Watford&#x27;s 1983–84 UEFA Cup campaign. However, Barnes missed most of the 1991–92 season due to a succession of injuries and played just 12 league games, scoring once, as Liverpool finished sixth in the league – their lowest finish in two decades and the first time since 1981 that they had failed to finish champions or runners-up. Liverpool won the 1992 FA Cup final, but Barnes missed the game through injury. The next month in June he was injured playing for England in Helsinki in a warm up game before Euro 92. Barnes was out injured for five months. He never recovered his explosive burst of speed that had been a key element of his play. He was now past his playing peak.

Barnes and several other senior players had frosty relationships with Souness during this period as the manager tried to impose new methods quickly. Many senior pros resented his hard discipline approach as well as the increased pressure in training. Barnes also once had to make a public apology to Souness after he gave an interview criticising the tactics employed by the manager before an important match. Young teammate Robbie Fowler also said in his autobiography that Souness felt at the time Barnes was past his best, but in Fowler&#x27;s (and others&#x27;) opinion he still had a lot to offer and was still one of the most talented players at the club.

Souness later stated in his autobiography that Barnes, due to his injuries, was now taking a &quot;less demanding&quot; central midfield playmaker&#x27;s role as opposed to a goalscoring winger. Despite the effects of the injuries, Barnes was still regarded as one of the club and country&#x27;s best players and Souness noted that Barnes &quot;Retained his quality on the ball, using it well and rarely losing possession&quot;. Mark Walters, who had played for Souness at Rangers, had been purchased as cover/competition for Barnes but failed to displace him.

After Liverpool&#x27;s league title in 1990, they were usurped by Arsenal, Leeds United, Manchester United and Blackburn Rovers each winning the league at least once. Under Roy Evans, Barnes and younger players like Steve McManaman, Jamie Redknapp and Fowler (who had been given their debuts by either Dalglish or Souness) won the 1994–95 Football League Cup and were 1996 FA Cup final runners-up due to Eric Cantona&#x27;s goal that gave United a second league and FA Cup double in three seasons. Liverpool&#x27;s Spice Boys team drew stinging criticism for wearing matching cream Armani suits to the final.

By the mid-1990s, Barnes had been moved from the left wing to the position of a holding midfielder. He often captained the side in 1995–96 when regular captain Rush lost his place to new signing Stan Collymore. When Rush departed to Leeds United at the season&#x27;s end Barnes became full-time captain. Barnes created the final goal after a dribble and passing movement for Collymore during Liverpool&#x27;s 4–3 win against Newcastle at Anfield, which is often considered the greatest game in Premier League history.

Jamie Carragher debuted for the Liverpool first team in January 1997 and said that despite the 33-year-old Barnes now being past his peak, he was still the best player at the club. &quot;Technically, he&#x27;s the best player I&#x27;ve ever trained or played with, he was great with both feet, they were both exactly the same. I&#x27;d say he&#x27;s the best finisher I&#x27;ve ever played with (including Torres, Fowler, Owen). Barnes never used to blast his shots – they&#x27;d just get placed right in the corner. You speak with the players from those great Liverpool sides and ask them who the best player they played with was and they all say John Barnes,&quot; Carragher commented.

On 13 August 1997, three months before his 34th birthday, after 10 years at Liverpool with 407 appearances, 108 goals, and five major trophies, Barnes left on a free transfer. He had missed just three Premier League games in his final season at Anfield, scoring four goals (including a memorable late winner against Southampton just after Christmas) as they had led the table for much of the first half of the season before being overhauled by eventual champions Manchester United at the end of January and having to settle for a fourth-place finish. Paul Ince, with a completely contrasting combative style, was signed from Inter Milan to replace Barnes in central midfield.

===Newcastle United===
Barnes was subsequently snapped up by former teammate and manager Kenny Dalglish, who was managing Newcastle United. Although an approach had already been made by Harry Redknapp of West Ham United, Barnes had agreed in principle to join them, until at the final moment Dalglish called him, and Barnes changed his mind. In the 1997–98 season, Barnes played up front, mostly, deputising for Alan Shearer after he was injured for most of the season, and Barnes ended up Newcastle&#x27;s top league scorer with six goals, highlighting the &quot;Magpies&quot;″ lack of ability to score in the absence of the injured Shearer, while Les Ferdinand and Peter Beardsley had both been sold. Former Liverpool colleague Ian Rush and England colleague Stuart Pearce were also drafted in for the 1997–98 season. Pearce has since stated in his autobiography, &quot;Psycho&quot;, that he felt Barnes was overweight by the time he joined Newcastle and that both Barnes and Rush had less desire than himself to win at that stage in their careers as they had already won everything, and that they could have had more of an edge to them.

Newcastle (the previous season&#x27;s Premier League runners-up) endured a disappointing league campaign and finished 13th, although they did reach the 1998 FA Cup final, and Barnes went onto the field for the fourth FA Cup final of his career as the club finished runners-up. Additionally, Barnes played in the UEFA Champions League, including in the club&#x27;s 3-2 victory over Barcelona. Following the sacking of Dalglish early in the 1998–99 season, he was left isolated and shunned along with a number of Dalglish and Keegan era players including Pearce and Rob Lee. Barnes with many others was dropped from the first team by new manager Ruud Gullit and spent several months in the reserves despite, in his opinion, &quot;excelling in training&quot; and showing he had lost none of his quality if some of his pace. He felt that himself and others were deliberately being cold shouldered to make it known Gullit wanted his own players in; Barnes had worked briefly with Gullit during the 1998 World Cup ITV commentary team, and they had played numerous international matches played against each other in the 1980s and 1990s, but they were not friends. Barnes knew it was the last straw when even his MBE from the Queen was overlooked by Gullit after a presentation had been given to Pearce for receiving one – this was in the winter of 1998 and he knew he was unwanted. Barnes left the club on a free transfer to newly promoted Charlton Athletic on 10 February 1999.

===Charlton Athletic===
Barnes made his debut for Charlton Athletic on 13 February 1999, coming on as a substitute in a 1–0 home win over Liverpool. He made a further 11 league appearances that season, mostly as a substitute, and did not score any goals. Defeat on the final day of the season relegated the &quot;Addicks&quot; back to Division One, and Barnes announced his retirement as a player after 20 years.

===Celtic===
During his short spell as Celtic manager, Barnes would later register as a player, although he did not make an appearance for the Scottish side.

==Racism==
During his playing career, Barnes (like other Black players of his era) was frequently the target of racial abuse from the terraces. At one of his first appearances at Anfield, Barnes said that the tea lady had, intentionally or unintentionally, served tea to all the players in the lounge except him, and he made a joke about it by asking light-heartedly, &quot;Is it because I&#x27;m Black?&quot; As well as being abused by opposition players, on occasions Barnes reported overhearing teammates making racist remarks towards other black players in opposition teams. One instance of racial abuse by a section of Everton supporters in the Merseyside derby at Anfield led to Everton chairman Philip Carter disowning the offending supporters, branding them &quot;scum&quot;. 

The highest profile racial incident of his career was captured in a photograph where Barnes, in full Liverpool kit and mid-match, casually backheeled away a banana which had been hurled at him during a 1988 match with Everton at Goodison Park.

==International career==

Although born in Jamaica, Barnes had no intention of representing Jamaica at international level as the &quot;Reggae Boyz had not yet made a significant mark on world football and he was eager to get to the game&#x27;s biggest stage&quot;.

At the time of Barnes&#x27; international career, FIFA&#x27;s national team eligibility criteria allowed British passport holders to represent one of the British football associations if they had no blood ties to the United Kingdom. Barnes had already planned to represent England where he had lived since the age of 12. Barnes said: &quot;the only reason I played for England was because they were the first to ask...if Scotland had asked [first]...You go and play for Scotland.&quot;

Barnes debuted for Bobby Robson&#x27;s England on 28 May 1983 as a second-half substitute for Watford teammate Luther Blissett in a 0–0 draw at Northern Ireland&#x27;s Windsor Park in the British Championship. Blissett was the fifth and Barnes the seventh black full England football internationals.

England failed to qualify for the 1984 European Championships, so instead toured South America. On 10 June 1984, against Brazil, Barnes dribbled through several Brazilian defenders and rounded Roberto Costa to score in a friendly match at Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Estádio do Maracanã. In his early England days, he and fellow black player Mark Chamberlain were subjected to threats from racist groups. Barnes was abused by supporters of the National Front on the plane back from South America in June 1984; with the group claiming that England had only won 1–0 against Brazil because Barnes&#x27; goal &quot;didn&#x27;t count&quot;.

Robson did not use Barnes at the 1986 World Cup until the quarter-final with 15 minutes left when trailing 2–0 against Argentina. (BBC commentator Barry Davies shouted: &quot;Go on! Run at them!&quot; when Barnes was given the ball), setting up a goal for Gary Lineker and laying on another chance denied by the head of Lineker&#x27;s Argentine marker. England were eliminated with Barnes praised for his contribution and many asked why he had not played more nor in previous games. It was after the World Cup that Barnes became a British passport holder. Speaking in 2008, Barnes said &quot;I don&#x27;t even know if the English F.A. didn&#x27;t know that I wasn&#x27;t born there and wasn&#x27;t brought up there...maybe I played (for England) illegally, right?&quot;

As part of a front four with Lineker, Peter Beardsley, and Chris Waddle, England lost all three of their group games at the 1988 European Championships. However, Robson stayed in his job.

Barnes pulled out of England&#x27;s first international game after the Hillsborough disaster due to grief he felt at the time and the game coinciding with a funeral. In his absence, England won the World Cup qualifier against Albania 5–0 at Wembley on 26 April 1989.

In the lead up to the 1990 World Cup, Barnes played several times as a forward alongside Lineker, and in a warm up game against Uruguay played well and scored a half volley from a Stuart Pearce cross. Barnes again rapped this time in New Order&#x27;s UK Number 1, &quot;World in Motion&quot;, tie-in song. At the World Cup, he injured his groin against Belgium, shortly after his volleyed goal was wrongly disallowed for offside. England went out to West Germany on penalties in the semi-final.

In June 1992 against Finland in Helsinki in England&#x27;s last warm up game before the 1992 European Championships, he tore his achilles tendon. He was injured for five months. In his absence England were eliminated at the group phase. On his return he had lost his explosive burst of speed and was now past his peak.

In a Wembley 1994 World Cup qualifier against San Marino, Barnes was booed by an entire section of England fans after the whole team played poorly. Barnes later believed an article attributed to Jimmy Greaves in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, which cited his supposed support for the West Indies cricket team and questioned his loyalty to the England team, had influenced the crowd to boo.

He earned a surprise England recall in 1994 under Terry Venables and was in the squad in the run up to Euro 96 after improved form for Liverpool, although he was not selected for the final tournament squad despite England not having an established left-sided alternative.

Barnes&#x27; 79 caps (10 goals) made him England&#x27;s record capped black player for a time. Compared to his club form, he was never seen as a player who peaked wearing an England shirt. Robson described him as the &quot;Greatest enigma&quot; of his career; whilst including him for his all time dream team England squad of all the players he had picked as manager in his 1990 book &quot;Against All Odds&quot; (placing him on the bench), he was baffled at Barnes&#x27;s inconsistency. He described Barnes as being a player of &quot;the highest calibre&quot; but sometimes being unable to reach for that bit extra when he or captain Bryan Robson shouted at him to take more players on.

Barnes has since said he felt the systems England played were &quot;rigid&quot; focusing on speed, aggression, and attacking through the centre rather than patient, passing play. He also said he could receive the ball as few as six or seven times in a game whereas at Liverpool he may receive it more than twenty times, and he had more freedom under Kenny Dalglish who did not ask him to stay on the left wing all the time. England also had a very different system to Liverpool at the time, who were much more free-flowing, and later said that to have got the best out of him, they would have needed a similar system to the one used by Dalglish, which was never likely to happen. He also cited Glenn Hoddle and Chris Waddle as players he felt England were unable to get the best out of.

Newspapers at the time of his England career even queried whether his disciplinarian upbringing in Jamaica to a military family and rumoured beatings as a child from his parents had contributed to his underperformance as an England footballer.

After 12 years Barnes won his 79th and last cap on 6 September 1995 in a 0–0 friendly draw with Colombia at Wembley that contained extrovert Colombian goalkeeper René Higuita&#x27;s &#x27;Scorpion Kick.&#x27; Barnes was in the top ten most capped players list for eleven years until David Beckham and then Gary Neville edged him from ninth to 11th.

In 1999, Tony Adams picked Barnes to be in his England dream team in his book &quot;Addicted&quot;, citing that Barnes &quot;could pass, move, dribble, had Brazilian style movement... what more could you want?&quot; He also backed Barnes&#x27;s view that England at times used rigid systems.

==Managerial career==
===Celtic===
In a &quot;dream ticket&quot; style move, Barnes was appointed head coach of Celtic on 8 June 1999, working under Kenny Dalglish as director of football. After his appointment he later re-registered himself as a player but never played a competitive game for Celtic. He was sacked 8 months into his tenure following a home 3–1 1999–2000 Scottish Cup defeat by First Division club Inverness Caledonian Thistle in February. The result led to the newspaper headline, &quot;Super Caley go ballistic, Celtic are atrocious&quot;. Dalglish took over first-team duties until the end of the season. Although Dalglish won the League Cup in the process, his contract was not renewed and the board decided to replace him with Martin O&#x27;Neill.

===Jamaica===
Source:

Barnes entered discussions with the Jamaica Football Federation in September 2008 regarding the possibility of him managing the Jamaica national team. On 16 September 2008, Barnes was appointed as manager of Jamaica announcing Mike Commane as his assistant. Barnes guided his new Jamaican charges to a first-place finish in the 2008 Caribbean Championships, qualifying as the top Caribbean side for the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

In February 2009, Barnes told Sky Sports that he wanted to return to club management if the opportunity arose. It was reported in May 2009 that Barnes contacted English League Two side Port Vale to see whether he could replace out-going manager Dean Glover. Ultimately, though, the potential move to Port Vale did not happen. Instead, on 14 June 2009 he confirmed that he was to be appointed manager of League One side Tranmere Rovers.

===Tranmere Rovers===
Barnes was officially named as manager of Tranmere Rovers on 15 June 2009, with Jason McAteer assisting him. He got off to a disastrous start, with Tranmere only winning three of their first fourteen games. On 9 October 2009, Barnes was sacked by the club six days after a 5–0 defeat at Millwall and a run of just two wins from eleven league games.

==Accolades==
Former England international Tom Finney remarked that &quot;players like John Barnes come along just once in a lifetime.&quot; Twice in his career, Barnes was voted Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year. He also won the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year. Barnes was voted England&#x27;s &quot;greatest left foot&quot; by readers of &quot;The Times&quot; in 2016, ahead of Chris Waddle and Jimmy Greaves. Barnes was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2005 in recognition of his contribution to the English game.

The Liverpool fans&#x27; adoration for &quot;Digger&quot; (he was nicknamed after the character Digger Barnes in the American soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot;) was emphasised when he finished in the top 5 of the poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop which was conducted by the official Liverpool Football Club web site in the summer of 2006. More than 110,000 supporters worldwide voted for their 10 favourite players of all time, Barnes finished 5th behind Robbie Fowler (4th), Ian Rush (3rd), Steven Gerrard (2nd) and the man that signed him three times (for Liverpool, Newcastle and Celtic) Kenny Dalglish (1st).

He also appears frequently as a selection in &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine&#x27;s Perfect XI, a choice in which current and former professional footballers select the best 11 players they have ever seen, played with or against, including selections by Michael Owen, Steve McManaman, Peter Beardsley, Ian Wright and Jamie Carragher.

==Music career==

He performed the Keith Allen-penned rap section of New Order&#x27;s &quot;World in Motion&quot; as well as appearing on the track &quot;Anfield Rap&quot;, a Liverpool FA Cup final song, rapping the lyrics &quot;Liverpool FC is hard as hell/United, Tottenham, Arsenal&quot;, and performing lead rap in Liverpool&#x27;s &#x27;96 cup final song &quot;Pass &amp; Move (It&#x27;s the Liverpool Groove)&quot;.

&quot;World in Motion&quot; reached #1 in the charts and spent 18 weeks in the UK top 75 (including re-releases in 2002 and 2010) although Barnes was only paid a flat rate of £200 and received no royalties. &quot;Anfield Rap&quot; reached #3 and spent 6 weeks in the top 75, and &quot;Pass &amp; Move&quot; reached #4 and spent 4 weeks in the top 75.

The rap portion of &quot;World in Motion&quot; is the most remembered part of the original song, becoming an iconic piece of English football culture in its own right, familiar to subsequent generations of England football fans not yet born by 1990.

==Personal life==

Barnes was first married to and subsequently divorced Suzy, with whom he has two sons and two daughters. Barnes&#x27; second wife is called Andrea and they have two daughters and a son.

With fellow former footballers Les Ferdinand and Luther Blissett, he founded Team48 Motorsport, a team aiming to promote young racing drivers of African-Caribbean background. In 2008, the team entered the British Touring Car Championship, running Alfa Romeos for white Jamaican Matthew Gore and 18-year-old black Briton Darelle Wilson. However, the project never got off the starting line and the team failed to show up for any of the races.

A few days after being sacked by Tranmere, Barnes was declared bankrupt. He has described the bankruptcy as a technicality, saying: &quot;The bankruptcy issue is a tax oversight which is being dealt with.&quot; Barnes&#x27; claims of the bankruptcy being a &quot;tax oversight&quot; proved true and the order was quickly overturned.

==Media, charity work and politics==
As a sporting icon in England in the early 1990s Barnes appeared in a commercial for the energy drink Lucozade, launching their Lucozade Sport drink. Barnes became a pundit on ITV and a presenter of the football coverage on Five as well as having his own weekly football discussion show on LFC TV called &quot;The John Barnes Show&quot;, every Thursday. He also worked as an ambassador for Save the Children. Barnes has appeared on several shows and media outlets to promote his charity work, including a notable appearance on &quot;Soccer AM&quot; in February 2009 performing the &quot;World in Motion&quot; rap and a parody of the mistimed advert by ITV in the previous week&#x27;s Everton vs. Liverpool FA Cup tie, with Barnes&#x27; &quot;Under-11 World Champion Baton-twirling&quot; routine missed by mock commercials. In 2001, Barnes appeared on &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;.

In 2000, Barnes presented a one off soccer special with Lisa Rogers entitled The Pepsi World Challenge, devised and produced by Nathan Carey and airing on Channel 5 in the UK. The show was edited with local presenters around the world.

He was the subject of a &quot;This is Your Life&quot; programme in 2001, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel.

Barnes competed in the fifth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; which started in October 2007. His dance partner was Nicole Cutler. They finished in seventh place. He was also the first male celebrity to receive a ten from the judges, which he got for his salsa.

After an absence of nearly eight years, Barnes returned to football in late 2007. He agreed to run several coaching clinics across the Caribbean for young players with the possibility of them joining Premier League side Sunderland on trial.

He made a guest appearance as himself in episode 10 of Series 6 of &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; that was aired on BBC One on Wednesday, 27 October 2010.

He has been used as a pundit in ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the 2009–10 FA Cup, and in SuperSport&#x27;s coverage of the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League, in South Africa.

He appeared on &quot;Russell Howard&#x27;s Good News&quot; best bits show on Thursday, 15 December 2011, as his Mystery Guest. In the show he was dressed as Santa Claus and along with Russell Howard he performed his famous rap from New Order&#x27;s &quot;World in Motion&quot;.

On 17 October 2012, Barnes featured in series 9, episode 9 of the BBC series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?.&quot;

Barnes has suggested the Rooney Rule, used in the National Football League (NFL), which requires teams to interview minority candidates for coaching positions, should be adopted by the Premier League.

In 2016 in the run-up to the 2016 EU referendum, Barnes refuted Michael Gove&#x27;s claim that he wished the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, clarifying that he supports continued UK membership of the EU.

In January 2018, Barnes participated as a housemate on the twenty-first series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;.

On 21 February 2019, Barnes was a guest on &quot;Question Time&quot;, commenting on racism and discrimination in society.

<text>Ancaster is a village and civil parish in the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England, on the site of a Roman town. The population of the civil parish was 1,317 at the 2001 census, increasing to 1,647 at the 2011 census. The civil parish includes the settlements of Sudbrook and West Willoughby.

The village is related to the titles of Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven and Earl of Ancaster, both of which are now extinct.

==History==

Ancaster was a Roman town at the junction of the Roman roads of Ermine Street and King Street.

During the Romano-British period, the Romans built a roadside settlement on the site of a &quot;Corieltauvi&quot; settlement. It was traditionally thought to have been named &quot;Causennis,&quot; although that is now believed to be Saltersford near Grantham. Ancaster lies on Ermine Street, the major Roman road heading north from London. To the north-west of Ancaster is a Roman marching camp, and some 4th-century Roman earthworks are still visible. Excavations have found a cemetery containing more than 250 Roman burials, including 11 stone sarcophagi. In the later years of Roman occupation, a large stone wall with accompanying ditches was erected around the town, possibly for defence against marauding Saxons.

The place name Ancaster is first attested in a 12th-century Danelaw charter from the reign of Henry II, and in a legal document of 1196, where it appears as &quot;Anecastre&quot;. The name means &quot;the Roman fort of &#x27;Anna&#x27;.&quot;

An excavation by the television programme &quot;Time Team&quot; in 2002 revealed a cist burial bearing an inscription to the god Viridius. The dig also uncovered Iron Age to 3rd-century pottery, a 1st-century brooch, and some of the Roman town wall.

Ancaster Hall at the University of Nottingham was named after the parish, as was the extinct title of the Earl of Ancaster.

In 2005, the once widespread but now rare tall thrift plant was discovered in Ancaster churchyard, one of only two places in the country where the plant has been found to occur. A preservation regime for the plant was instituted by English Nature.

The town of Ancaster in Ontario, Canada, was established in Upper Canada in 1792 and was named after Ancaster, Lincolnshire, by British army officer and the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada John Simcoe, apparently inspired to do so by Peregrine Bertie, the 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven.

==Geography==
The River Trent formerly flowed east from the Nottingham area towards the North Sea, via the Vale of Belvoir and the Ancaster gap in the limestone ridge to the north known as the Lincoln Cliff.

Ancaster lies midway between Sleaford and Grantham on the A153 road, at its junction with the B6403 (Ermine Street). North of the village, the B6403 (High Dike) is the dividing line between South and North Kesteven. Towards Sleaford lies Wilsford and to the west Sudbrook.

The civil parish boundaries are different: the civil parish also covers the settlements of Sudbrook and West Willoughby.

==Amenities==
Ancaster has a Church of England primary school, a butcher and grocery shop, a small railway station on the Nottingham–Skegness line, and a post office and petrol station. Of two public houses in Ermine Street, only the &quot;Railway Inn&quot; remains. A sports and social club is associated with the playing field, which hosts Ancaster Cricket Club. West of the village on Willoughby Moor is a holiday park. There are also two nearby nature reserves, each a Site of Special Scientific Interest, where the tall thrift plant is found.

==Church==

The village&#x27;s Grade I listed Anglican parish church is dedicated to St Martin, one of many churches on Roman sites which are dedicated to the Roman soldier who converted to Christianity and later became Bishop of Tours and a saint. St Martin&#x27;s stands slightly elevated on the Roman road Ermine Street, on the probable site of a Roman temple. It is first documented in 1200 when the body of Bishop Hugh was rested overnight at the church while on its way to Lincoln. The church has decorated Norman arches and an Early English font. The corbels are decorated with medieval figurative imagery: a drinking nun, an older woman, and a farmer with a medieval headdress. There is also a Green Man &quot;mouth-puller&quot; in the vestry and the remains of a Sheela na gig on the north side of the tower. There are also figures carved on the wooden ceiling. Two Roman relief sculptures were found on the East Wall of the church in the 1960s.

The ecclesiastical parish links to Wilsford as part of the Loveden Deanery of the Diocese of Lincoln.

<doc id="603949" wikidata="Q454030" url="?curid=603949" title="Anna Held">
<text>Helene Anna Held (19 March 1872 – 12 August 1918) was a Polish-born French stage performer of Jewish origin on Broadway. While appearing in London, she was spotted by impresario Florenz Ziegfeld, who brought her to America as his common-law wife. From 1896 through 1910, she was one of Broadway&#x27;s most celebrated leading ladies, presented in a succession of musicals as a charming, coquettish Parisian singer and comedienne, with an hourglass figure and an off-stage reputation for exotic behavior, such as bathing in 40 gallons of milk a day to maintain her complexion. Detractors implied that her fame owed more to Ziegfeld&#x27;s promotional flair than to any intrinsic talent, but her audience allure was undeniable for over a decade, with several of her shows setting house attendance records for their time. Her uninhibited style also inspired the long-running series of popular revues, the Ziegfeld Follies.

==Early life==

Born in Warsaw, Held was named Helene Anna Held, daughter of a German Jewish glove maker, Shimmle (aka Maurice) Held, and his French-Jewish wife, Yvonne Pierre.

Sources list a variety of birth years, ranging from 1865 to 1873, but 1872 has been accepted in general. In 1881, anti-Semitic pogroms forced the family to flee to Paris. When her father&#x27;s glove manufacturing business failed, he found work as a janitor, while her mother operated a kosher restaurant. Held began working in the garment industry, then found work as a singer in Jewish theatres in Paris and, later, after her father&#x27;s death, London, where her roles included the title role in a production by Jacob Adler of Abraham Goldfaden&#x27;s &quot;Shulamith&quot;; she was also in Goldfaden&#x27;s ill-fated Paris troupe, whose cashier stole their money before they ever played publicly.

As a young woman in France, Held converted to Roman Catholicism.

==Career==

===Early years===
Her vivacious and animated personality proved popular and her career as a stage performer gained momentum as she became known for her risqué songs, flirtatious nature and willingness to show her legs on stage. In 1894, she married the much-older Uruguayan playboy Maximo Carrera, with whom she had a daughter, Lianne (1895–1988), who was also an actress and producer, sometimes billed as Anna Held Jr.

Touring through Europe, Held was appearing in London in 1896, when she met Florenz Ziegfeld, who asked her to return to New York City with him. He set about creating a wave of public interest in her, feeding stories to the American press, such as her having had ribs surgically removed. By the time Held and Ziegfeld arrived in New York, she was already the subject of intense public speculation. When she finally performed in a revival of &quot;A Parlor Match&quot;, the critics were dismissive, but the public approved.

===Broadway success===
David Monod of Wilfrid Laurier University has suggested that Held succeeded more on image than talent, the illusion she presented to post-Victorian era audiences who were beginning to explore new social freedoms. From 1896, Held enjoyed several successes on Broadway, including &quot;The Little Duchess&quot; (1901) and &quot;A Parisian Model&quot; (1906–1907). These, apart from bolstering Ziegfeld&#x27;s fortune, made her a millionaire in her own right. Ziegfeld&#x27;s talent for creating publicity stunts ensured that Held&#x27;s name remained well known.

Held influenced the format for what would eventually become the famous &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; in 1907, and she helped Ziegfeld establish the most lucrative phase of his career. Held could not perform in the first &quot;Follies&quot; when she become pregnant by Ziegfeld in late 1908. Held&#x27;s daughter Lianne later claimed in her unpublished memoirs that Ziegfeld forced Held to have an abortion because he did not want her pregnancy interfering with &quot;Miss Innocence&quot;, a show in which she would star in 1908–09. The claim was repeated in an autobiography by Held entitled &quot;Anna Held and Flo Ziegfeld&quot;, however, Richard and Paulette Ziegfeld, (authors of &quot;The Ziegfeld Touch&quot;) concluded that Held never wrote her memoirs, and Lianne was the real author of the autobiography. Eve Golden, Held&#x27;s biographer, wrote that Lianne&#x27;s abortion claim was likely a lie designed to demonize Ziegfeld, whom Lianne loathed.

In 1909, Ziegfeld began an affair with the actress Lillian Lorraine; Held remained hopeful that his fascination would pass, and he would return to her, but instead he turned his attentions to another actress, Billie Burke, whom he married in 1914.

===Film===
New York entertainment entrepreneur Oliver Morosco cast Held in the lead for &quot;Madame la Presidente&quot; in 1916. According to an interview she gave to Hector Ames for &quot;Motion Picture Classic&quot;, she was paid $25,000 for her performance.

==Later years and death==
After &quot;Miss Innocence&quot;, Held left Broadway. She spent the years of World War I working in vaudeville and touring France, performing for French soldiers and raising money for the war effort. She was considered a war heroine for her contributions, and was highly regarded for the courage she displayed in traveling to the front lines, to be where she could do the most good.
The year 1917 was one of constant touring for Held; she toured the United States in a production of &quot;Follow Me&quot; until ill health caused her to close the show in January 1918. She then checked into the Hotel Savoy in New York City where her health continued to decline. Held had been battling multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells, for a year. News coverage began reporting that it had been caused by her practice of excessive lacing of her corsets to give her a tiny waist.

According to the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, Held had been in and out of consciousness for about a week. On 12 August 1918, her doctor pronounced her dead, and the media was alerted. Approximately two hours later, Held revived, and the media notified she was still alive, only to have Held finally die shortly thereafter.

Held&#x27;s funeral was held at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Manhattan on 14 August. Florenz Ziegfeld did not attend; he had a phobia about death and never attended funerals. Held is interred at Cemetery of the Gate of Heaven in Hawthorne, New York.

==Legacy==

*The MGM film &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; (1936) tells a sanitized version of the Ziegfeld-Held relationship. Luise Rainer won an Academy Award for her performance as Held. Ziegfeld and Burke were played by William Powell and Myrna Loy.
*In 1978, Columbia Pictures released a made-for-television film on NBC, &quot;&quot;. Held was portrayed by Barbara Parkins.
*The American poet Carl Sandburg wrote a memorial poem for Anna Held, &quot;An Electric Sign goes Dark&quot;, in the collection &quot;Smoke and Steel&quot;.
*In 1976, Held&#x27;s daughter Lianne Carrera opened a museum of her mother&#x27;s personal and stage items in San Jacinto, California.

<text>Köping was a Swedish denomination for a market town since the Middle Ages, derived from the Old Norse word &quot;kaupang&quot;. The designation was officially abolished with the municipal reform of 1971, when Sweden was subdivided into the Municipalities of Sweden (currently amounting to 290). 

As present-day Finland was once a part of Sweden, the Finnish word &quot;kauppala&quot; has the same meaning. In modern Finnish, the word &quot;kaupunki&quot;, borrowed from the Old Norse word &quot;kaupang&quot;, is the main word for town and city. Swedish &quot;köping&quot; and the English toponym &quot;chipping&quot; are also cognates as is the Norwegian word &quot;kjøpstad&quot; and the Danish toponymical suffix &quot;-købing&quot;.

==Sweden ==

===History ===
In 1863 the first local government acts were implemented in Sweden. There were two acts, one for cities and one for rural areas. Of the around 2,500 municipalities, 89 had city rights and thus had the right to call themselves &quot;stad&quot; (city). Under the &quot;rural&quot; act there were also eight localities given the status of &quot;köping&quot;, which positioned them between a rural municipality and a town (see municipalköping). The number of localities designated as &quot;köping&quot; rose dramatically during the 20th century and reached its peak in 1959, when they were 95. Many new settlements during the industrialization of Sweden, as well as some of the suburbs in the metropolitan areas, first received the title of &quot;köping&quot; and it was also made part of their name (such as Linköping or Nyköping). They later grew further and received town privileges, but kept the &quot;köping&quot; ending of their names. See the list below. It has been found that a vast majority, nearly 70%, of such designated market-towns lie within an area of in south-central Sweden, especially in the highly economically productive region immediately west and south of Stockholm, in Södermanland, Örebro, Östergötland, and Jönköping counties.

A large-scale merger of Swedish municipalities in 1971 removed the distinctions between towns, market towns and rural municipalities. Many of the former market towns are now seats of municipalities. In contrast to the term &quot;stad&quot;, &quot;köping&quot; is seldom used in everyday speech today.

<text>Victoria Coach Station in the City of Westminster is the largest coach station in London, and a terminus for medium and long distance coach services in the United Kingdom. It is operated by Victoria Coach Station Limited, a subsidiary of Transport for London. , there were 14 million passenger and 472,000 coach movements annually.

Victoria Coach Station covers with separate arrival and departure terminals on opposite sides of Elizabeth Street. The departure building includes food and retail outlets, left-luggage facilities and a ticket hall.

London Buses routes 11, 44, 170, C1, C10, N11 and N44 serve the coach station. It is a short walk from London Victoria station.

==History==

Victoria Coach Station was commissioned by London Coastal Coaches, a consortium of coach operators, and opened on 10 March 1932 by Minister of Transport John Pybus. Wallis, Gilbert and Partners&#x27; distinctive Art Deco building was originally built with spaces for 76 coaches, and a booking hall, shops, buffet, restaurant, lounge and bar. London Coastal Coaches&#x27; headquarters and other offices occupied upper floors.

During World War II coach travel was restricted and the War Office requisitioned the premises.

By the 1960s, operation of the station had passed through industry consolidation to Tilling Group and British Electric Traction, whence it was reorganised by the &quot;Transport Act 1968&quot; to become part of National Bus Company. Subsequently it was transferred to London Transport in 1988, and Transport for London (TfL) in 2000.

Freehold owner, Grosvenor Group, announced in 2013 that it wished to redevelop the site and relocate station operations elsewhere in London, though the following year English Heritage designated the building Grade II listed. Nevertheless, several of TfL&#x27;s leases on the station were due to expire by 2023 and proposals were made to relocate to Royal Oak, but in 2019 the move was abandoned.

==Utilisation==

Use of the coach station has increased from 2008 to 2018.
Data from 2008/2009 until 2019/2020 is for departing passengers only and both departing and arriving coaches.

Data from 2020/21 onwards is &#x27;passenger movements through the site&#x27; and &#x27;Domestic and International Accessible Departures&#x27;. TfL does not state a reason for the reporting being different.

==Operators==

, service operators include:-

==Financial==

Profits for TfL subsidiary Victoria Coach Station Ltd have increased over recent years.

==Controversy==

In 2019, Transport for London was served a Fire Enforcement Notice after a &quot;catalogue of major fire risks&quot; were found by London Fire Brigade inspectors at Victoria Coach Station.

The deficiencies included holes in walls, which could cause a fire to spread; inadequate fire sprinkler systems that had been broken and out of use for more than two years, and obstructed exit routes used for storage. Fire experts described the situation as a &quot;walking disaster area&quot; and &quot;by far the worst I&#x27;ve seen in a long time&quot;. Transport for London posted fire watchers.

<text>Marita Koch (later Meier-Koch; born 18 February 1957) is a German former sprint track and field athlete. During her career she set 16 world records in outdoor sprints as well as 14 world records in indoor events. Her record of 47.60 in the 400 metres, set on 6 October 1985, still stands.

==Biography==
Born in Wismar, East Germany, Marita Koch displayed exceptional speed even as a young child and was defeating boys much older than herself in sprint races whilst at school. By the time she had turned 15 years old, she was training under Wolfgang Meier. Meier worked as a naval engineer, but also coached athletics part-time. Koch and Meier moved to Rostock where Koch began to study medicine. However, she decided to stop her studies and focus on running instead. Koch was coached by Meier for her entire career, and they later married. She retained her maiden name, and is now known as Marita Koch-Meier. She and her husband have a daughter named Ulrike. In 2019, Ulrike married Tony Drechsler, son of former East German long jump world record holder Heike Drechsler.

Koch has held world records over several distances from 50 m to 400 m. Some of her best performances are as follows:

* 100 m 10.83 seconds (+1.7) West Berlin (FRG) 8 June 1983
* 200 m 21.71 seconds (+0.7) Karl Marx Stadt (GDR) 10 June 1979
* 400 m 47.60 seconds Bruce Stadium, Canberra (AUS) 6 October 1985
Koch ran a 400 m quarterfinal at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal (51.87 seconds), but withdrew due to injury. She set her first world record in 1977 in Milan, when she ran a 400 m indoors in 51.8 seconds. The following year, she set her first outdoor record at 400 m in 49.19 seconds. She topped this with another two world records within a month. In 1979 Koch became the first woman to run a 200 m in under 22 seconds. Her time of 21.71 seconds (wind +0.7 m/s) set at Karl Marx Stadt stood as the world record for nine years. She tied her own 200 m world record in 1984 (21.71 seconds +0.3 m/s Potsdam). However, her 200 m world record was equaled twice in 1986 by Heike Drechsler. One of Drechsler&#x27;s 21.71 second 200 m performances was achieved into a headwind whereas both of Koch&#x27;s performances of 21.71 had a tailwind.

At the Moscow Olympics of 1980 Koch won the 400 m race. Three weeks before the 1984 Olympic Games, she equaled her own record, but the East German boycott prevented her from competing in the games. She also won the European Championships at 400 m in 1978, 1982 and 1986. She remained the European record holder for the 200 m until 28 August 2015 when Dafne Schippers won the 200 m final at the 2015 World Championships with a time of 21.63 seconds. As a member of East Germany&#x27;s relay teams, Koch also set more world records. They set new world records in the 4 × 100 m in 1979 and 1983. The same team became second in the 4 × 400 m relay in the 1980 Olympic Games. They also set world records over the same distance in 1980, 1982 and 1984. In October 1986, she was awarded a Star of People&#x27;s Friendship in gold (second class) for her sporting success.

Koch retired from running in 1987 as one of Germany&#x27;s most successful athletes. She had suffered from an Achilles tendon injury She and Meier own a sports goods store in Rostock.

===The 400 m world record run===

On 6 October 1985 at the year&#x27;s World Cup meet, Koch set the current 400 m world record of 47.60 seconds. That time is considered far out of reach of even the best of today&#x27;s athletes. The meet was held at Bruce Stadium in Canberra, Australia, which is at 605 metres altitude. The world record 400 m run had been well planned, and her basic speed and speed endurance proven in several training runs in the weeks prior. One week prior to her 400 m world record run, anecdotal reports suggest that Koch had run the 200 m in 21.56 seconds (fully automatic time). This 200 m performance was never verified by the IAAF and remains unofficial.
In her world record run, Koch, running in lane 2, came out of the blocks at a scorching pace and eliminated the stagger on most of her competitors by the end of the first bend. Her 100 m split time was reported to be 11.3 seconds, while her 200 m split time was reported to be 22.4 seconds. At the halfway point in the race, she had completely destroyed most of a world class field. Her 300 m split was reported to be 34.1 seconds (hand timed), the all-time best performance for this distance. During the final stages of the race, the original video footage only captured Koch and Olga Bryzhina (née Vladykina) of the former USSR, who was trailing behind, but closing the gap. The rest of the field had been left so far behind that they were not captured by the camera as Koch and Vladykina crossed the finishing line. Third place was Lillie Leatherwood, more than two seconds behind Vladykina. Koch had gained too much of an advantage in the early stages of the race, and Vladykina was unable to pull in Koch before the finish line. Vladykina also ran her all-time best performance (48.27 seconds) in that race.

In a 400 m race, the only women to have broken the 48-second barrier are Koch and Jarmila Kratochvílová (47.99 seconds, Helsinki, 1983). Kratochvílová was Koch&#x27;s main rival over the distance and also a 400 m world record holder in the early 1980s. To this day, no other woman has come within a half a second of Koch.

==Drug use controversy==

Koch&#x27;s achievements, along with the performances of other East German female athletes, have long been under suspicion that they were achieved with the aid of illegal performance-enhancing drugs. These drugs were not detectable at the time. In 1991, German anti-drug activists Brigitte Berendonk and Werner Franke were able to save several doctoral theses and other documents written by scientists working for the East German drug research programme.

The documents list the dosage and timetables for the administration of anabolic steroids to many athletes of the former DDR, with one of them being Marita Koch. According to the sources, Koch did use the anabolic steroid Oral-Turinabol (4-Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone) from 1981 to 1984 with dosages ranging from 530 to 1460 mg/year.

Marita Koch never failed a drug test.

Berendonk and Franke also discovered a letter allegedly written by Koch, complaining that her rival, Bärbel Wöckel, was receiving higher doses of steroids than her because Wöckel&#x27;s uncle was president of the pharmaceutical company Jenapharm.

<text>Eliteserien () is a Norwegian professional league for association football clubs. At the top of the Norwegian football league system, it is the country&#x27;s primary football competition. Contested by 16 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Norwegian First Division.

Seasons run from March to November with each team playing 30 matches (playing each other home and away). Most games are played on Sunday evenings.

Eliteserien was founded in 1937 as Norgesserien (), and the first season was the 1937–38 season. The structure and name of Eliteserien, along with Norway&#x27;s other football leagues, has undergone frequent changes. The top level was renamed &quot;Hovedserien&quot; in 1948, &quot;1. divisjon&quot; (now used by the second-level league in Norway) in 1963, then &quot;Tippeligaen&quot; (named for the main sponsor) in 1990. Starting with the 2017 season the league adopted the current &quot;Eliteserien&quot;, after NFF decided to totally drop any sponsor&#x27;s names from the name of the league. TV 2 have been the owners of the broadcasting rights since 2023. The league generates NOK 400 million per year in domestic television rights. The Norwegian top flight has been professional since 1992. In 1995, Tippeligaen was expanded to 14 teams, and in 2009 it was further expanded to 16 teams.

Seventeen clubs have won the title since the inception of the league in 1937: Rosenborg (26), Fredrikstad (9), Viking (8), Lillestrøm (5), Molde (5), Vålerenga (5), Bodø/Glimt (4), Brann (3), Larvik Turn (3), Lyn (2), Start (2), Strømsgodset (2), Fram Larvik (1), Freidig (1), Moss (1), Skeid (1) and Stabæk (1). In 2010, Rosenborg became, and still remain, the only club to complete an Eliteserien campaign without losing a single game. The record of most points in a season is 81 by Bodø/Glimt in 2020. Since its establishment as a one-group top flight in 1963, forty-eight clubs have competed in Eliteserien.

==History==
===Early years (1937–1948)===
Before 1937, there was no national league competition in Norway; only regional leagues and the Norwegian Cup. Starting in 1937–38, the various regional leagues in Southern Norway were aligned into eight districts, with a championship playoff between the winners to crown a national champion. This competition was called Norgesserien (English: &quot;The League of Norway&quot;). In the early years, the top flight teams were divided into eleven groups from eight districts. The league champion was decided in either a knockout tournament or a final between the winners of these groups. Fredrikstad was the first champions of the league, winning the 1937–38 season. They won the two-legged final against Lyn 4–0 on aggregate. Fredrikstad defended their title in the 1938–39 season. From the 1937–38 season and until the beginning of World War II, the teams were divided into eight district groups. There were plans at the time to merge the district leagues into a national competition, but because of World War II, this process was delayed until after the war, although also the first post-war season in 1947–48 had eleven district-based groups. 

===Hovedserien (1948–1962)===
In 1948, Hovedserien (English: &quot;The Main League&quot;) was created, consisting of the 16 top teams from the district leagues, who were placed into two groups of eight, with the group winners playing a two-legged final for the national championship at the end of the season. This format was in place from the 1948–49 season until 1960–61, when it was decided to merge the two groups into a single top division, and have the season follow the calendar year from 1963 onwards. The 1950s were dominated by Fredrikstad FK and Larvik Turn. Fredrikstad won their latest league title in 1960–61, which secured their ninth title out of sixteen possible. Larvik Turn won Hovedserien three times in four seasons from 1955–56. The 1961–62 season was played during 15 months. The teams from the two groups in the 1960–61 top division were put in one group consisting of 16 teams. The 1961–62 season became a transitional season, where the 16 top-flight teams were placed in a single group, playing a season that went on for 15 months and one half of its teams were relegated. Officially still known as Hovedserien, the 1961–62 season is often referred to as &quot;Maratonserien&quot; (&quot;The Marathon League&quot;) due to its unusual length. The &quot;Maratonserien&quot; was won by Brann.

===1. divisjon (1963–1989)===
In 1963, a single top division containing ten teams was introduced, and the league was renamed 1. divisjon (English: &quot;1st Division&quot;). The first regular one-league season was played spring-autumn and was won by title defenders Brann in 1963. The league was expanded to 12 teams in 1972. Teams from Northern Norway were not allowed to gain promotion to the top division before 1972, when Mjølner became the first team from Northern Norway to play in the top flight, and until 1979 were subject to stricter promotion rules than teams from the rest of the country. Viking won the league four consecutive seasons beginning in 1972. Lillestrøm won back-to-back titles in 1976 and 1977. In 1979 teams from Northern Norway were given the same promotion rights as the rest of the country. In the beginning of the 1980s, Vålerengen were the dominant team, with title wins in 1981, 1983 and 1984.

===Tippeligaen (1990–2016)===

In 1990, the league was renamed Tippeligaen, when Norsk Tipping became the main sponsor of the league. When fans and media continued referring to the league as 1. divisjon, it was decided to let the second-level league of Norwegian football &quot;inherit&quot; the name 1. divisjon in 1991, to help Tippeligaen establish as a brand. Rosenborg of Trondheim won the first year the league bore the name Tippeligaen in 1990. Followed by a win by Viking of Stavanger in 1991. In 1992, Rosenborg started a run of 13 consecutive titles which lasted to the 2004 season. During the first years of Rosenborg&#x27;s thirteen-year run, they won the league with substantial margins, only partly challenged by Bodø/Glimt, Molde, Lillestrøm and Brann. However, this was steadily narrowing down towards a dramatic finish in 2004, where the Trondheim team tied with Vålerenga of Oslo in game points and on goal difference, but finished ahead on number of goals scored. However, in 2005 the winning streak came to an end as Vålerenga clinched the title, one point ahead of Start of Kristiansand. Rosenborg was never in contention that season and would finish only 7th. In 2006, Rosenborg returned to the top of the league, coming back from 10 points behind Brann at the halfway point to clinch the title with a match to spare. Brann won the league in 2007, and Stabæk won their first-ever title in 2008. Rosenborg then returned for a two-year winning streak in 2009 and 2010. Molde&#x27;s back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 makes it the only other club to win consecutive titles in the current format, and outside Rosenborg, the first team to do so since Vålerenga in 1983 and 1984.

===Recent years (2017–present)===
In 2016, it was decided to change from the sponsorship name &quot;Tippeligaen&quot; to the non-sponsorship name &quot;Eliteserien&quot;, effecting from the 2017 season. Rosenborg won the league four consecutive times from 2015 to 2018, before Molde ended their streak by winning the title in the 2019 season. Lillestrøm were relegated from the 2019 Eliteserien and ended their record spell with 45 consecutive top division seasons. Bodø/Glimt became the first team from Northern Norway to win the league by winning the title in the 2020 season with 81 points, an all-time record.

==Competition format==
===Competition===
As of the 2025 season there are 16 clubs in the Eliteserien, seven of which are located in Eastern Norway, six are from Western Norway, two from Northern Norway and one is from Trøndelag.

During the course of a season, each club plays the others twice, home and away, for a total of 30 games for each club, and a total of 240 games in a season. The season starts in March and lasts until early November. Rounds played during the weekends are usually broken up into two games on Saturdays, five games on Sundays and one game on either Fridays or Mondays. For the final two rounds, all games start simultaneously so that no club may gain an unfair advantage by knowing the results of other games in advance of kicking off their own.

The 16 May round, which is played the day before Norway&#x27;s Constitution Day, 17 May, is one of the most anticipated rounds of the season. It is often referred to as the &quot;national day of football&quot; and since it precedes a national holiday, games usually see higher attendance than other rounds.

Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, goals scored, and then head-to-head records used to separate teams on equal points. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned &quot;League Winner&quot;. The title of &quot;Norwegian Champions&quot; is reserved for the winners of the Norwegian Football Cup. The two lowest placed teams are automatically relegated to the Norwegian First Division and the top two teams from the First Division take their place. The fourteenth placed team in Eliteserien is also in danger of being relegated and must enter play-offs against one team from the First Division to stay in the top flight.

=== Changes in competition format===
===Eliteserien teams in international competition===

Rosenborg (11 times) and Molde (once) are the only Norwegian clubs to participate in the UEFA Champions League group stage. Rosenborg reached the quarterfinal in the 1996–97 season. They were eliminated by runners-up Juventus with 1–3 on aggregate. In the 1968–69 season, Lyn lost the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup quarterfinal against runners-up Barcelona with 4–5 on aggregate. Brann lost the quarterfinal against Liverpool in the 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and Vålerenga lost the quarterfinal against Chelsea in the 1998–99 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup with 2–6 on aggregate. Molde reached the round of 16 in both the 2020-21 UEFA Europa League and the 2023-24 UEFA Conference League against Granada and Club Brugge respectively. Bodø/Glimt reached the quarterfinal of the 2021-22 UEFA Conference League, where they were eliminated by Roma.

;Notes
==List of champions==

Below is a list of the gold, silver and bronze medalists in the Norwegian top flight since its beginning in 1937–38. (The Norwegian Cup has been played since 1902, and is still officially known as the Norwegian Championship, presented with &quot;The King&#x27;s Cup&quot;.) During 1937–1948 the name of the league was Norgesserien (&quot;The League of Norway&quot;), 1948–1962 Hovedserien (&quot;The Main League&quot;), 1963–1989 1. divisjon (&quot;1st Division&quot;), and from 1990 Tippeligaen (sponsored name) or Eliteserien (&quot;The Elite League&quot;, a generic name).

From 1937 until 1948, the championship was decided through a playoff between the winners of the various regional leagues in Southern Norway. From 1948 until 1961, the 16-team league was divided into two groups, and decided by a final match between the group winners. Since then it has been a round-robin decided through a league table. Bronze finals were played in 1960 and 1961; before that no bronze medals were awarded. Note that clubs from Northern Norway (including Bodø/Glimt and Tromsø IL), allegedly due to travel distance, were not allowed in the top division until 1972, but a separate Northern Norwegian Cup was played. Furthermore, northern Norwegian teams had stricter promotion rules until 1979. The league did not play during the period 1940–1946 because of the World War II.

See below for a list of medalists by club.

=== Medalists by year ===

===Honoured clubs===
Clubs in European football are commonly honoured for winning multiple league titles and a representative golden star is sometimes placed above the club badge to indicate the club having won 10 league titles. In Norway the star symbolizes 10 Eliteserien titles. Rosenborg was the first team to introduce a star when they won their 10th title in 1995. No club has introduced a star since 2006, when Rosenborg won their 20th league title to put a second star on their badge. The clubs closest to their first are Fredrikstad with 9 Eliteserien titles and Viking with 8 Eliteserien titles. The following table is ordered after number of stars followed by number of Eliteserien titles.

:&quot;Statistics updated as of the end of the 2022 season&quot;
== Sponsorship ==
From 1990 to 2016, Eliteserien had title sponsorship rights sold to Norsk Tipping.

Eliteserien has a number of official partners and suppliers. The first official ball supplier for the league is Select who on 27 October 2017 signed a three-year contract to deliver official balls. The deal began from the start of the 2018 season and was renewed ahead of the 2022 season.

== Broadcasters ==
The broadcasting rights were in December 2015 secured by Discovery Networks who signed a six-year deal giving them rights to broadcast all the 240 games in Eliteserien from 2017 to 2022. The deal was worth NOK 2.4 billion. In December 2020, TV 2 acquired the broadcasting rights from 2023 to 2028 in a deal worth NOK 4.5 billion.

All matches are broadcast internationally on Eleven Sports.

In the Balkans, the league is currently aired on Sport Klub.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland matches are aired live on OneFootball.

== Stadiums ==

Since the competition format was changed to a one-group top flight in 1963, Eliteserien football has been played in 56 stadiums. As of the start of the 2020 season, Ullevaal Stadion has hosted the most matches in the top flight with 697. Since the opening of Vålerenga&#x27;s new stadium Intility Arena in August 2017, no clubs in Eliteserien use Ullevaal Stadion as their home ground. Two stadiums that have seen Eliteserien football (1963–) have now been demolished.

The stadiums for the 2023 season show a large disparity in capacity: Lerkendal Stadion, the home of Rosenborg, has a capacity of 21,421 with Nadderud Stadion, the home of Stabek, having a capacity of 4,938. The combined total capacity of Eliteserien in the 2023 season is 175,938 with an average capacity of 10,996.

The Eliteserien&#x27;s record average attendance was set during the 2007 season. This record attendance recorded an average attendance of 10,521 with a total attendance of just under 2 million. The 2 million mark was crossed after the 2009 league extension to sixteen teams. 2,151,219 was the total attendance in 2009, which is the record total attendance.

== Managers ==
Managers or head coaches in the Eliteserien are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the structure of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans. Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;A&#x27; Licences. The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Eliteserien on a permanent basis.

===League ranking and European qualification===

In the UEFA coefficient, UEFA&#x27;s rankings of European leagues based on their performances in European competitions over a five-year period, the league ranked 27th at the end of the 2012–2013 European season, its lowest ranking since 1993. The league&#x27;s highest ranking, tenth place, came in 1998. The winners of the previous calendar year&#x27;s Eliteserien enter the second qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, while the cup winners enter the second qualifying round of the Europa Conference League. The second and third placed teams also enters the second qualifying round of the Europa Conference League. In the 2013–2014 season, Norway also had an additional place in the first qualifying round of the Europa League due to its fair play ranking.

<text>Rogue Traders is an Australian electronic rock band formed in Melbourne, Victoria in 2002 by mainstay James Ash on keyboards. In 1989, Ash met fellow original member Steve Davis in London while both were working as DJs. Before forming Rogue Traders, the pair had worked together on many projects, including the dance music act Union State, which relocated to Melbourne in 1992. The group&#x27;s name comes from the 1999 drama film, &quot;Rogue Trader&quot;. They were joined in 2004 by soap opera actress, Natalie Bassingthwaighte, on lead vocals, Cameron McGlinchey on drums and Tim Henwood on guitar. Davis continued as a behind-the-scenes member, contributing to the songwriting process but not making any public appearances with the group.

Rogue Traders have achieved chart success in Australia, with seven top 20 hits on the ARIA Singles Chart, &quot;One of My Kind&quot;, &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;, &quot;Way to Go!&quot;, &quot;Watching You&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re Coming Home&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Wanna Feel&quot; and &quot;I Never Liked You&quot;. Their most successful single, &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;, peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart, number four in Australia, number seven on the New Zealand Singles Chart and number fifteen on the Irish Singles Chart. The group&#x27;s two Top 5 albums in Australia are &quot;Here Come the Drums&quot; (2005) and &quot;Better in the Dark&quot; (2007). In 2007, &quot;Here Comes the Drums&quot; was certified 4× platinum by ARIA for shipment of 280,000 copies, while &quot;Better in the Dark&quot; was certified platinum in 2008. As of 2008, Rogue Traders have been nominated for ten ARIA Awards, three MTV AVMA Awards, one The Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, one Inside Film Award, and eight APRA Awards.

In June 2008, Bassingthwaighte left the band to focus on her acting and solo music career. In July that year, her then-boyfriend and later husband, McGrinchey, also left the band.

In November 2008, Mindi Jackson was revealed as the new lead singer to replace Bassingthwaighte. Peter Marin joined on drums to replace McGrinchey. The band was unceremoniously dumped by Sony Records in 2010, and split due to infighting shortly afterwards. Their fourth studio album and greatest hits compilation, &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot;, was released after their split in November 2011.

On 15 December 2015, it was announced that the group had reformed with Bassingthwaighte. The band were working on new music, expected to be released in late 2017, which had not yet materialised as of 2021, though a 2021 remix EP of &quot;In Love Again&quot; was released in June 2021.

==History==
===Formation===
Rogue Traders formed as an Australian electronic, pop rock band in Melbourne in 2002 by former members of Union State, James Ash (aka Jamie Appleby) on keyboards and Steve Davis on guitar. The duo had met in 1989 in London where both were working as DJs. The pair first worked on a rap track, Ash recalled &quot;It was a terrible song but Steve and I hit it off straight away and became fast friends&quot;. Ash relocated to Melbourne in 1992, but the pair continued to work together and formed Union State to release singles including, &quot;Out to Get You&quot; and &quot;Retrosexual&quot;. In 1994 Ash signed with Vicious Vinyl as a solo artist under the name, Thunderchild, to issue a self-named single. By 2002 the duo had formed Rogue Traders and signed with Vicious Vinyl&#x27;s house music label, Vicious Grooves.

===&quot;We Know What You&#x27;re Up To&quot;: 2002–2004===
On 11 April 2002, Rogue Traders released their debut single, &quot;Need You to Show Me&quot;, under the Vicious Grooves label, which failed to reach the top 100 on the ARIA Singles Chart. However, it did reach No. 16 on the Top 50 Club Chart. It was originally intended to be the lead single for their debut album, &quot;We Know What You&#x27;re Up To&quot;, however it was cut from the album&#x27;s track listing before its release. The single was recorded with Jamaica Williams providing lead vocals. Half a year later, their second single, &quot;Give in to Me&quot;, was released on 14 October. The track had lead vocals by Melinda Richards, and was written by Ash, Davis, Josephine Armstead and Milton Middlebrook. It performed better than their first release on the ARIA Singles Chart, peaking at No. 67. At the APRA Music Awards of 2003 it was nominated for &#x27;Most Performed Dance Work&#x27;. Ash and Richards later married and, as Melinda Appleby, she contributed songwriting credits to Rogue Traders later work.

The band&#x27;s first top 20 success came in 2003 when &quot;One of My Kind&quot;, a remix/cover version of INXS&#x27;s &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;, was released on 23 February, which peaked at No. 10, and spent nine weeks inside the top 50. The single brought greater recognition for the band and, at ARIA Music Awards of 2003, they were nominated in two categories, &quot;Breakthrough Artist – Single&quot; and &quot;Best Video&quot; (by Sam Bennetts, Rising Sun Pictures), and won &quot;Best Dance Release&quot;. On 5 May 2003, their debut album, &quot;We Know What You&#x27;re Up To&quot;, was released, but it failed to reach the top 100 on the related Albums Chart. The third and final single from the album, &quot;Stay?&quot;, was released on 2 June, which peaked at No. 60.

Natalie Bassingthwaighte gained popular acclaim as an actress on the Australian soap opera, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, playing the role of Izzy Hoyland from 2003. By 2004, she began working on a parallel music career creating her own demos: songs with an acoustic-rock sound when, late that year, she was recruited as the lead singer for Rogue Traders. Upon being presented with the band&#x27;s music, Bassingthwaighte auditioned for Ash and Davis. The pair had auditioned 15 to 20 candidates, and after she performed their song &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;, she became the band&#x27;s front woman.

===&quot;Here Come the Drums&quot;: 2005–2006===

Rogue Traders first single with Bassingthwaighte&#x27;s vocals, &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;, was issued in May 2005. Its Australian release occurred without any mention of Bassingthwaighte in its promotion, as they wanted people to buy it because they liked the song instead of for its &#x27;celebrity value&#x27;. The single reached number four in Australia, number seven in New Zealand, number three in the United Kingdom (in July 2006), and number fifteen in Ireland (also July 2006).

In October 2005, the group performed at the NRL Grand Final shortly before the release of their second album, &quot;Here Come the Drums&quot; on 23 October. By that time they had added Cameron McGlinchey on drums. The album peaked at number two on the ARIA Albums Chart and reached the top 50 on the UK Albums Chart. The group had signed a new record contract with Sony BMG and now promoted their recent band members Bassingthwaighte and McGlinchey. The second single from the album, &quot;Way to Go!&quot; reached number seven in Australia, while &quot;Watching You&quot; peaked at number five. Like many other modern mainstream music acts, Rogue Traders use elements of old songs in their music. However, rather than sampling the original songs, they re-record the relevant parts. &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; contains a re-recorded riff from &quot;Pump It Up&quot; by Elvis Costello (co-credited as Declan MacManus), &quot;Watching You&quot; contains re-recorded elements of &quot;My Sharona&quot; by The Knack (co-credited to Doug Fieger and Berton Averre) and &quot;In Love Again&quot; contains re-recorded elements of &quot;Head over Heels&quot; by Tears for Fears (co-credited to Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith).

Early in 2006, the Rogue Traders toured Australia in support of their second album and its singles. Bassingthwaighte left &quot;Neighbours&quot; to focus on her music career and filmed her final scenes on 2 June. In March 2007, she reprised her role as Izzy Hoyland in scenes shot while on location in London in November 2006.

Rogue Traders won the 2006 MTV Australian Video Music Award for Best Dance Video for &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;. In June at the APRA Music Awards of 2006, Rogue Traders won their first APRA Award, with &quot;Way to Go!&quot; taking out the &quot;Most Performed Dance Work&quot; category. They had twice previously been nominated in the same category, in 2003 for their single &quot;Give in to Me&quot; and in 2004 for &quot;One of My Kind&quot;, which also won an ARIA award. Also in June 2006, Rogue Traders announced they were re-releasing &quot;Here Come the Drums&quot;, as a limited edition two-CD remix set. The second CD contained remixes of their hit singles and the album included new artwork. It was released on the same day as their fourth single, &quot;We&#x27;re Coming Home&quot; from the album. The single reached number fourteen. That same month, Bassingthwaighte and Ash announced on &quot;Video Hits&quot; that the band were currently in the process of writing their third studio recorded album. By that time Davis had left the group but continued to contribute as part of the songwriting process. He was replaced on guitar by Tim Henwood, previously of The Androids.

Rogue Traders announced in early 2006 that they had signed with the European division of Sony BMG and were to be releasing their second album &quot;Here Come the Drums&quot; and singles from the album into that market. On 10 July &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; became their first UK single and the album followed on 24 July. A gig was announced in the UK at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London for 11 July—to promoted &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; and &quot;Here Come the Drums&quot;. Many radio stations across the UK had started to play &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; six weeks before its release. The &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; video clip began to receive airplay on programs across UK: &quot;The Box&quot;, &quot;The Hits&quot; and &quot;MTV Dance&quot;. The clip was the same as the Australian version. It reached top 5 positions on programs and number-one on some radio stations as well. The song received numerous positive reviews from radio stations, TV programs and music critics. Some called it a &#x27;summer anthem for 2006&#x27; and some named it either &#x27;Record of the Week/Month&#x27;. The video and single was then put onto iTunes UK for purchase. The video reached number two on the iTunes Video Chart and stayed in the top five for several days, while the single made its way into the top ten and days later into the top five.

&quot;Voodoo Child&quot; was physically released on 10 July in the UK but debuted in the chart the week before at number eighteen due to download sales. After its official release, &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; reached number three with sales of over 21,000. Due to its UK chart success, &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; was issued in several European countries including Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. On 16 October &quot;Watching You&quot; was released in the UK as the band&#x27;s second single and peaked at number thirty-three on the singles chart. A new video clip was filmed, along with a new remix track, and the third UK single from &quot;Here Come the Drums&quot; was &quot;Way to Go!&quot; – it was issued as a digital download. In November they released &quot;In Love Again&quot; as a promotional single exclusively though radio, which peaked at number twenty on the ARIA Digital Tracks.

In June 2007, &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; was featured in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode, &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot; (Season 3, Episode 12). The song was preceded by the episode&#x27;s villain, The Master, proclaiming &quot;Here come the drums!&quot; The song&#x27;s lyrics echo the title of the episode, which refers to the drumming the Master hears in his head. Rogue Traders were also a surprise inclusion to the 2006 season of &quot;Big Brother Australia&quot;, entering the house and playing a &quot;concert&quot; for house mates. The event was also streamed to &quot;Big Brother&quot; audiences from the program&#x27;s website. The Rogue Traders&#x27; song, &quot;Fashion&quot; was also used as the theme tune to Gok Wan&#x27;s Channel 4 television programme called &quot;Gok&#x27;s Fashion Fix&quot;.

In 2006, Rogue Traders went on the We&#x27;re Coming Home Tour around Australia. They performed songs from &quot;Here Come the Drums&quot;, kicking off each show with &quot;Believer&quot; and ending with an encore of &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;. The band also previewed songs which were subsequently included on their third album, &quot;Better in the Dark&quot; (2007), including the title track, &quot;What You&#x27;re On&quot; and &quot;Shout Out&quot;. By the end of 2007, &quot;Here Comes the Drums&quot; was certified 4× platinum by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments in excess of 280,000 copies in Australia.

===&quot;Better in the Dark&quot;: 2007–2008===

In January 2007, Rogue Traders performed at the opening of the Australian Jamboree at Elmore, Victoria in front of a crowd of over 10,000. In April the group performed at the Melbourne Crown Casino, previewing some of their new songs. In May they supported British girl group Girls Aloud on The Sound of Girls Aloud: The Greatest Hits Tour. &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; reported that &quot;[t]he group&#x27;s management confirmed the band had been in discussions with a major US label.&quot; Rogue Traders flew to the US in July where they launched their first single into the North American market. The group then signed Universal Music Group. Unfortunately, the song failed to gain much attention in the US.

In May 2007, Old Navy, a division of Gap, Inc. in North America, featured &quot;Believer&quot;, &quot;Watching You&quot;, and later, &quot;World Go &#x27;Round&quot; in their Summerland commercials. In June Rogue Traders completed a tour of the UK and returned to Australia to finalise their third album. In September, the lead single, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Wanna Feel&quot;, was released: it debuted on the ARIA singles chart at number ten, and on the ARIA dance chart at number one. It premiered on Nova radio station in early September and two weeks later reached number one on the &quot;Hot30 Countdown&quot;. &quot;Better in the Dark&quot; was issued on 13 October. It was released in two forms; the standard form and a limited CD/DVD edition with international imports available later the following week. &quot;Better in the Dark&quot; made it to number four in the ARIA Albums Chart, and number one in the Australian Artists Chart. With the release of &quot;Better in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Here Come the Drums&quot; re-entered the charts at number forty-five, two years after its initial release, ultimately it appeared in the top 50 for 74 weeks. &quot;Don&#x27;t You Wanna Feel&quot; was certified Gold (35,000+ copies sold) by ARIA. It was the group&#x27;s third single to go Gold. &quot;Better in the Dark&quot; was also certified Platinum. Their second single, &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;, went Platinum (70,000+ copies sold).

In January 2008, the second single, &quot;I Never Liked You&quot;, from &quot;Better in the Dark&quot;, was issued, which peaked at number nine. On 1 February, Rogue Traders performed &quot;Don&#x27;t You Wanna Feel&quot; and &quot;I Never Liked You&quot; at the Melbourne Cricket Ground Twenty/20 Cricket match as part of the half-time entertainment in front of a crowd of over 84,000. In April the third single, &quot;What You&#x27;re On&quot; was issued, which peaked in the top 30. That same week it reached number eighteen on the Physical Singles Chart, number nine in the Australian Artists Singles Chart and number three on the Dance Chart.

Rogue Traders undertook the Better in the Dark Tour from 29 April to the beginning of June, playing venues around the country. The tour kicked off at the Regent Theatre in Yarram. The group played songs from all three albums: &quot;We Know What You&#x27;re Up To&quot;, &quot;Here Come the Drums&quot; and &quot;Better in the Dark&quot;. They surprised some fans by playing their first top 10 single, &quot;One of My Kind&quot;, a re-working of the INXS classic &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;, but this time sung live by Bassingthwaighte. They also performed a cover of &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;, the Prince song also covered by Sinéad O&#x27;Connor.

In June 2008, after the toured ended, Bassingthwaighte quit the band to focus on her acting and solo music career. A fourth single from the album had been planned, linked with a competition involving Ford. The competition was to answer in 25 words or less why they should feature in the new Rogue Traders video. The single was confirmed to be &quot;On Your Way to the Disco&quot;, but it was never officially released as Bassingthwaighte had left. In July that year her then-boyfriend (they later married), McGlinchey, also left the band. Ash dismissed the idea that Bassingthwaighte&#x27;s departure signalled the end of the band, stating that he had already started working on the next album, the fourth for the band.

===&quot;The Sound of Drums&quot; and breakup: 2009–2011===

On 13 August 2009, Rogue Traders revealed that Henwood had returned on guitar and Spencer had left. On 14 November, Ash revealed via Twitter the names of their new singer, Melinda &quot;Mindi&quot; Jackson, and new drummer, Peter Marin. On 25 December 2009 (Christmas Day), &quot;Love Is a War&quot; was issued as a digital download single and then, on 8 January 2010, as a physical single. It peaked at number ninety. On 12 March &quot;Would You Raise Your Hands?&quot; was released as the follow-up single, which reached number ninety-five. &quot;Hearts Beat as One&quot; was issued as the third single on 11 June 2011 – it had been written for the Socceroos as the official anthem for their 2010 FIFA World Cup campaign. However, despite this, the song failed to chart, the Rogue Traders&#x27; first single to do so since 2002&#x27;s &quot;Need You to Show Me&quot;.

&quot;Night of the Living Drums&quot;, the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, was initially set for release in June 2010, according to the band&#x27;s official website. However it was pushed back for undisclosed reasons, then in December it was revealed the band had left Sony Music, after the label had refused to release the album. On 11 November 2011 Rogue Traders finally released &quot;Night of the Living Drums&quot;, after they had re-signed to Sony. It was released as part of &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot; which is a double album that includes a compilation disc, &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot;, and the studio recording, &quot;Night of the Living Drums&quot;. Ash described &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot; conception, &quot;[t]he catalyst was when we realised we were coming up to the band&#x27;s 10-year anniversary. We&#x27;d always talked about how much fun it would be to do a greatest hits one day, and we struck on the idea of doing a record that combined the two. I have to give credit to Sony, because they changed their minds about us – we brought this idea back to them and they went for it&quot;.

A radio edit of &quot;Night of the Living Drums&quot; cut &quot;America&quot; was serviced to Australian radio to promote the release, but failed to make an impact.

After a two-year media silence, Ash confirmed in a 2014 interview that the band had split shortly after being dropped by Sony Music.

===Reunion: 2015–present===
On 15 December 2015, it was announced that Rogue Traders had reunited with Bassingthwaighte for a New Year&#x27;s Eve reunion gig, after initially reforming earlier in September for a corporate show in Gold Coast. The band confirmed that Jackson had given the band&#x27;s reunion her blessing. They have since performed at multiple events including the &quot;Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix&quot;, and co-headlining the &quot;Coates Hire Sydney 500&quot; with Killing Heidi.

In 2017, after a stint on &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, Bassingthwaighte revealed the band are working on new music and had their first recording session in April 2017.

In February 2023, the Rogue Traders Released their first single in over a decade, &quot;To the Disco&quot;, which interpolates an older Rogues track, &quot;On Your Way to the Disco&quot;, released in 2007.

<doc id="603973" wikidata="Q1090833" url="?curid=603973" title="Heyde's syndrome">
<text>Heyde&#x27;s syndrome is a syndrome of gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasia in the presence of aortic stenosis.

It is named after Edward C. Heyde, MD, who first noted the association in 1958. It is caused by cleavage of Von Willebrand factor (vWF) due to high shear stress forces from aortic valvular stenosis. This results in Von Willebrand disease type IIA (acquired).

==Signs and symptoms==

== Pathophysiology ==

Von Willebrand factor is synthesized in the walls of the blood vessels and circulates freely in the blood in a folded form. When it encounters damage to the wall of a blood vessel, particularly in situations of high velocity blood flow, it binds to the collagen beneath the damaged endothelium and uncoils into its active form. Platelets are attracted to this activated form of von Willebrand factor and they accumulate and block the damaged area, preventing bleeding .

In people with aortic valve stenosis, the stenotic aortic valve becomes increasingly narrowed resulting in an increase in speed of the blood through the valve in order to maintain cardiac output. This combination of a narrow opening and a higher flow rate results in an increased shear stress on the blood. This higher stress causes von Willebrand factor to unravel in the same way it would on encountering an injury site. As part of the normal hemostasis of the blood, when von Willebrand factor changes conformation into its active state, it is degraded by its natural catabolic enzyme ADAMTS13, rendering it incapable of binding the collagen at an injury site. As the quantity of von Willebrand factor in the blood decreases, the rate of bleeding dramatically increases.

The unraveling of high molecular weight von Willebrand factor in conditions of high shear stress is essential in the prevention of bleeding in the vasculature of the gastrointestinal system where small arterioles are common, as platelets cannot bind to damaged blood vessel walls well in such conditions. This is particularly true in the presence of intestinal angiodysplasia, where arteriovenous malformations lead to very high blood flow, and so the loss of von Willebrand factor can lead to much more extensive bleeding from these lesions. When people with aortic stenosis also have gastrointestinal bleeding, it is invariably from angiodysplasia.

It has been hypothesized that defects in high molecular weight von Willebrand factor could actually be the cause of the arteriovenus malformations in intestinal angiodysplasia, rather than just making existing angiodysplasic lesions bleed. This hypothesis is complicated by the extremely high rates of intestinal angiodysplasia in older people (who also have the highest rate of aortic stenosis), and thus requires further research for confirmation.

== Diagnosis ==
Heyde&#x27;s syndrome is now known to be gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasic lesions due to acquired vWD-2A deficiency secondary to aortic stenosis, and the diagnosis is made by confirming the presence of those three things. Gastrointestinal bleeding may present as bloody vomit, dark, tarry stool from metabolized blood, or fresh blood in the stool. In a person presenting with these symptoms, endoscopy, gastroscopy, and/or colonoscopy should be performed to confirm the presence of angiodysplasia. Aortic stenosis can be diagnosed by auscultation for characteristic heart sounds, particularly a crescendo-decrescendo (i.e., &#x27;ejection&#x27;) murmur, followed by echocardiography to measure aortic valve area (see diagnosis of aortic stenosis). While Heyde&#x27;s syndrome may exist alone with no other symptoms of aortic stenosis, the person could also present with evidence of heart failure, fainting, or chest pain. Finally, Heyde&#x27;s syndrome can be confirmed using blood tests for vWD-2A, although traditional blood tests for von Willebrand factor may result in false negatives due to the subtlety of the abnormality. The gold standard for diagnosis is gel electrophoresis; in people with vWD-2A, the large molecular weight von Willebrand factors will be absent from the SDS-agarose electrophoresis plate.

==Management==
The definitive treatment for Heyde&#x27;s syndrome is surgical replacement of the aortic valve. Recently, it has been proposed that transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) can also be used for definitive management. Direct surgical treatment of the bleeding (e.g. surgical resection of the bleeding portion of the bowel) is only rarely effective.

Medical management of symptoms is possible also, although by necessity temporary, as definitive surgical management is required to bring levels of von Willebrand factor back to normal. In severe bleeding, blood transfusions and IV fluid infusions can be used to maintain blood pressure. In addition, desmopressin (DDAVP) is known to be effective in people with von Willebrand&#x27;s disease, including people with valvular heart disease. Desmopressin stimulates release of von Willebrand factor from blood vessel endothelial cells by acting on the V2 receptor, which leads to decreased breakdown of Factor VIII. Desmopressin is thus sometimes used directly to treat mild to moderate acquired von Willebrand&#x27;s disease and is an effective prophylactic agent for the reduction of bleeding during heart valve replacement surgery.

==Epidemiology==
The exact prevalence of the syndrome is unknown, because both aortic stenosis and angiodysplasia are common diseases in the elderly. A retrospective chart review of 3.8 million people in Northern Ireland found that the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in people with any diagnosis of aortic stenosis (they did not subgroup people by severity) was just 0.9%. They also found that the reverse correlation—the incidence of aortic stenosis in people with gastrointestinal bleeding—was 1.5%. However, in 2003 a study of 50 people with aortic stenosis severe enough to warrant immediate valve replacement found GI bleeding in 21% of people, and another study done in the USA looking at angiodysplasia rather than GI bleeding found that the prevalence of aortic stenosis was 31% compared to 14% in the control group.
It is a disease mainly found in older adults but a rare case of Heyde&#x27;s syndrome has been reported in children.

== History ==
The American internist Edward C. Heyde originally described the syndrome in a 1958 letter to the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, reporting on ten patients with the association. Heyde graduated from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1938, served three years in the Army Medical Corps in World War II and joined the Vancouver Clinic, Vancouver, Washington in 1948, practicing medicine there for 31 years. He died on October 13, 2004.

In the 45 years following its initial description, no plausible explanations could be found for the association between aortic valve stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding. Indeed, the association itself was questioned by a number of researchers. Several studies demonstrated a statistically significant association between aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding, and in 1987 King et al. even noted the successful resolution of bleeding symptoms with aortic valve replacement in 93% of people, compared to just 5% in people where the bleeding was treated surgically. However, the potential causal association between the two conditions remained elusive and controversial.

Several hypotheses for the association were proposed, the most prominent being the idea that there is no causal relationship between aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding, they are both just common conditions in the elderly, and they sometimes overlap. Other hypotheses included hypoxia of the colonic mucosa and bowel ischemia due to low blood flow, both of which were discounted by later research. Another early hypothesis of note was proposed by Greenstein et al. in 1986. They suggested that GI bleeding could be caused by thinning of the wall of the cecum due to abnormal pulse waves in the ileocolic artery (an artery that supplies blood to the cecum) causing dilation of that artery. Specifically, they note that the usual anacrotic and dicrotic notches were absent from the pulse waves of their people with aortic stenosis. There has been no further research investigating this hypothesis, however, as it has been eclipsed by newer research into acquired von Willebrand&#x27;s disease.

The important role of depletion of von Willebrand factor in aortic stenosis was first proposed in 1992 by Warkentin et al. They noted a known association between aortic stenosis (in addition to other cardiac diseases) and acquired von Willebrand&#x27;s disease type IIA, which is corrected by surgical replacement of the aortic valve. They also noted that von Willebrand&#x27;s disease is known to cause bleeding from angiodysplasia. Based on these facts, they hypothesized that acquired von Willebrand&#x27;s disease is the true culprit behind gastrointestinal bleeding in aortic stenosis. They also proposed a possible mechanism for the acquired von Willebrand&#x27;s disease, noting that von Willebrand factor is most active in &#x27;high shear&#x27; vessels (meaning small vessels in which blood flows rapidly). They used this fact to hypothesize that this may mean that von Willebrand factor is activated in the narrowed stenotic aortic valve and thus cleared from circulation at a much higher rate than in healthy individuals.

This hypothesis received strong support in 2003 by the publication of a report by Vincentelli et al. that demonstrated a strong association between von Willebrand factor defects and the severity of aortic valve stenosis. They also showed these defects resolved within hours following aortic valve replacement surgery and remained resolved in most people, although in some people the von Willebrand factor defects had returned at six months. Following this observation the shear stress dependent depletion of von Willebrand factor was confirmed, and the protease responsible, ADAMTS13, was identified.

<text>A campervan, also referred to as a camper, caravanette, motorhome or [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] (recreational vehicle) in North America, is a self-propelled vehicle that provides both transport and sleeping accommodation. The term describes vans that have been fitted out, whereas a motorhome is one with a coachbuilt body.

== Ambiguity with motorhome ==

The term motorhome is sometimes used interchangeably with campervan, but the former can also be a larger vehicle than a campervan and intended to be more comfortable, whilst the latter is more concerned with ease of movement and lower cost. For example, some campervans lack built-in toilets and showers, or a divide between the living compartment and the cab.

The United States term &quot;recreational vehicle&quot; (RV) is more analogous to motorhome than campervan.

== Features ==

Campervans may be equipped either with a &quot;pop-up&quot; roof which is raised during camping, or a fixed roof, either shared with the commercial van that forms the basis of the vehicle (commonly a &quot;high-top&quot; model), or as part of a custom coach-built body.

Campervans usually have a small kitchen with a refrigerator (which is often powered by a choice of gas, battery, or mains electricity) and a two-burner gas hob and grill. They generally have dual-voltage lighting which can work from either a dedicated battery (other than the van battery) known as a deep-cycle or &quot;leisure battery&quot;, or from AC power, supplied at a campsite via a hook-up cable. Larger models may include a water heater, space heating and air conditioning, a portable toilet and an internal shower. Smaller models often carry a portable toilet, and sometimes an external shower that operates within the privacy of an awning.

The term &quot;Dormobile&quot; is sometimes used generically in the United Kingdom due to a once highly popular conversion brand, and &quot;Kombi&quot; is used in Australia and other countries. The popularity of this type expanded in the 1950s after Volkswagen commissioned the Westfalia company to use the Kombi version of their Type 2 transporter as the basis for a campervan.

== Off-road variations ==

Off-road campervans are often referred to as 4WD or 4x4 campers. Some models include expandable tents mounted on the roof while others have pop-up roofs for additional sleeping space and storage.

Pop-up roof variants share certain design elements with roof tents as sometimes fitted to more robust four wheel drive off-road vehicles intended for expeditions rather than relaxed camping. A compromise between these two purposes is sometimes reached by basing the conversion on an off-road vehicle. Sometimes the conversion is demountable from the back of a pick-up truck body.

== DIY and Self-Build Campervan Conversions ==
In recent years, converting vans into self-contained motorhomes or campervans has become a popular trend among people who want to own a motorhome or campervan but don&#x27;t have the budget for a purpose built motorhome or professional conversion. 

The conversion process involves stripping out the existing interior of the van and installing the new components. This can include insulating and lining the van, cutting and fitting furniture, installing electrical systems, new windows, a pop-up top and plumbing in a sink and water supply.

It is possible to do a hybrid conversion where large elements such as roof, windows and bed are installed by a professional company and the owner then completes the job themselves. Gas installation requires particular expertise and must either be completed or certified by a qualified engineer. 

Insurance for a DIY campervan requires a policy that is flexible enough to cover the vehicle while it is a van, during the conversion process and when it is a completed campervan.

== Classic Volkswagen and other campervans ==

There are several types of campervan manufactured by Volkswagen; depending on their age, they are colloquially referred to as either a splitty (split windscreen), a bay (bay framed windscreen), or a bricky (&quot;brick&quot; shaped van).

Although less popular, Mercedes also manufactured a similar-sized light van and conversions were reasonably common in the 1960s and 1970s. Of a similar size and vintage is the British Commer Spacevan conversion.

In Europe, the Citroën H-Van has also been used as a base for many campervan conversions, and is popular amongst Dutch and Belgian users in particular. Ex-factory, it had several height and length configurations, and in all versions it had a low floor and high ceiling, a legacy of one of its original uses as a mobile shop. It does not usually need a pop-top to accommodate its users.

Modern mid-sized Japanese vans such as the Toyota Hiace are sometimes converted to have the appearance of a classic Volkswagen.

== New concept car camper ==

The car camper is an estate car (UK) or a station wagon (USA) converted into a travel home. The rear cargo area is converted into a full double bed area usually with a fabricated aluminium framework. All equipment necessary to set up a well-appointed camp site is stored under the double bed with access through lidded areas under the bed. Unlike a standard station wagon where the camping equipment has to be removed before sleeping or a tent set up, the car camper is self-contained.

== British and European size and type classifications ==

=== A-class (AC) ===

Similar to North American A-class recreational vehicles (sometimes known generically as &quot;Winnebagos&quot;) but generally still smaller in Europe. Fully coachbuilt over a medium-to-large van chassis, from 7.5 tonnes and upwards. Highly appointed, sometimes with electrically operated slide-out (sideways) extensions to the living space, electricity-generating windmills and in very large models (of North American scale) sometimes even fitted with a hydraulically operated garage capable of transporting a small car.

Smaller (sub 7.5 tonnes) A-class vehicles are also popular in Europe, similar in size to overcab coachbuilts, but without the base vehicle&#x27;s cab. In its place, a (wider) cab is added, which allows for a drop-down bed to be fitted above. Recognisable by their large curved windscreens.

=== Overcab (OC) ===
Coachbuilt body, retaining the base van&#x27;s cab, with a raised Luton van style area over the cab containing a bed. Other beds may be fixed in place, built by moving seats and tables, or lowered from the ceiling. Shower and toilet cubicles usually fitted. Sometimes including a garage for bikes, and may be large enough to support a mechanism for towing a small city car. Roughly comparable to the North American C-class (CC).

Common base vehicles include the Fiat Ducato, Renault Master, and Ford Transit.

=== Low profile (LP) ===

Coachbuilt but without a raised bed over the cab. Other beds may be fixed in place, built by moving seats and tables, or lowered from the ceiling. Shower and toilet cubicles usually fitted. Garages and towing fittings may be carried as with the overcab designs.

Typical base vehicles are lighter-duty or smaller-engined variants of the same vehicles used for overcab designs.

=== High top (HT) ===
Based on a high-top van, typically of around 2.8 to 4.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight, without major coachbuilding modifications to the body. Beds typically fixed in place or built by moving seats and tables. Shower and toilet cubicles sometimes fitted.

Typical base vehicles are the same as for the coachbuilt designs, above. Often, a Dodge, GMC or Ford van will be professionally converted into a high top.

=== Rising roof (RR) ===
Often based on a relatively small van, typically 2 to 3 tonnes gross vehicle weight, including the classic Volkswagen Type 2, and with a roof which raises, usually with fabric sides, in a way not unlike a roof tent. Bed typically in the rising roof but also sometimes built by moving seats and tables. A rising roof is also sometimes used to allow for standing room in the vehicle. Shower and toilet cubicles rarely fitted.

The Volkswagen Transporter is a common base vehicle, and Ford Transits are also reasonably common.

=== Fixed roof (FR) ===

Also known as &quot;surf vans&quot; (or &quot;surf buses&quot;) and &quot;day vans&quot;. Typically similar in size to the rising roof designs. Beds usually built by moving seats and tables. Shower and toilet cubicles very rarely fitted.

The Volkswagen Transporter and Mercedes-Benz Vito are particularly common base vehicles. They have become the successors to the classic Volkswagen Type 2. Slightly smaller vans such as the Fiat Scudo may be used; on occasion, even smaller vans such as the Fiat Doblò are used to make casual light-duty campers with minimal facilities beyond sleeping space.

=== Dismountable (DM) ===
A coachbuilt body sits on a (sometimes modified) pick-up load-bed, and generally removable at campsites to allow the vehicle to be used.

Ford, Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi vehicles are common bases.

=== B-class (BC) ===

This term is not commonly used except for imported North American models, which may vary greatly in size from semi-low profile coachbuilts to van conversions. Typically, a van chassis is provided without interior or some exterior features as an &quot;incomplete vehicle&quot; by an automobile manufacturer, and upfitted with RV amenities by a coachbuilder. It is then sold as a completed RV and usually has safety standards certification from the RV Industry Association.

== North American van conversions ==


In North America there are many manufacturers of campervans. Since the 1970s, Japanese vans like the Toyota HiAce and the Datsun Urvan, as well as European models based on the Ford Transit, Fiat Ducato and Bedford vans, have become popular as base vehicles for conversions.

== Amenities ==
A modern campervan may contain some or all of the following features:
* Propane gas or electric-powered refrigerator
* Propane gas or electric cooktop, grill, or both
* Microwave oven
* Oven
* Propane gas- or electric-powered water heater
* One or more beds, some of which double-up as daytime seating
* Electricity supplied by &quot;house&quot; battery or external hook-up
* Built-in or cassette toilet with removable disposal tank – a flushing toilet with access usually outside the campervan for easy emptying. Some models have a swivel system for extra space.
* Shower
* Television (with an aerial, satellite dish, or both)
* Air conditioning (at least the normal vehicle&#x27;s cab system)
* Room heater or central heating
* Potable water tank
* Wastewater tank for &quot;grey&quot; (wash) water and black (sewer) water
* Extendable external awning – an extendable canvas shade that offers protection from the sun.
* Generator – powered by gasoline, diesel or propane
* Solar panels – for additional electricity generation
* Bike rack – a bicycle carrying device, usually fixed to the rear of the campervan.

<text>Bharatbhushan Gupta, better known as Bharat Bhushan (14 June 1920 – 27 January 1992) was an Indian actor in Hindi language films, scriptwriter and producer, who is best remembered for playing Baiju Bawra in the 1952 film of the same name. He was born in Meerut, and brought up in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh.

== Career ==
He made his debut with the Kidar Sharma hit &quot;Chitralekha&quot; (1941). However, he struggled for over a decade to make a mark in Hindi movies till &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot; (1952), which gave him instant stardom and legendary status along with Mohammad Rafi, Meena Kumari and Naushad Ali. Though a very talented actor and a prominent star of the 1950s and 1960s in Hindi language films, he often took on roles of tragic musicians in the movies. Films in which he starred as lead actor include &quot;Basant Bahar&quot;. His pairing with Madhubala proved to be very popular as they worked together in successful films like &quot;Gateway of India&quot; (1957), &quot;Phagun&quot; (1958) and &quot;Barsaat Ki Raat&quot; (1960).

&quot;He portrays historical and mythological characters the best in Hindi movies,&quot; states contemporary actor-producer Chandrashekar. He wrote scripts and stories for &quot;Barsat Ki Raat&quot;, &quot;Nayi Umar Ki Nayi Fasal&quot;, &quot;Basant Bahar&quot;, &quot;Dooj Ka Chand&quot;, etc. He was the producer of &quot;Dooj Ka Chand&quot;. His brother R. Chandra made many films such as &quot;Bebus&quot;, &quot;Minar&quot;, and &quot;Basant Bahar&quot;.
He was the recipient of the second Filmfare best actor award for the film &quot;Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu&quot; in 1954. Most of the great songs of major singers of that period such as Rafi, Manna Dey, Talat, and Mukesh were pictured on him. He was one of the few actors who had a good sense of music, so most music-based movies were made with him in lead roles in the 1950s and 1960s.

He acted in Hindi language movies until the 1990s. He is still loved and revered by the Indians for the great movies and great songs that he gave in spite of personal tragedies and stiff competition from his contemporaries. He is considered to be one of the greatest stars and legends of Hindi cinema.

==Personal life==
Bharat Bhushan was born as Bharat Raibahadur Motilal Gupta on 14 June 1920 in a Vaishya (&quot;Baniya&quot;) family at Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India.

His father, Raibahadur Motilal, was the government pleader of Meerut and Supreme Court Judge, Allahabad. He had one older brother. His mother died when he was two years old. The brothers left for Aligarh to stay with their grandfather after their mother&#x27;s death. He did his studies and earned a graduate degree from Dharam Samaj College, Aligarh. His elder brother was film producer and high court judge, Rameshchandra Gupta, who owned the Ideal Studio at Lucknow. After studies, he took to acting against his father&#x27;s wishes. He first went to Calcutta to join cinema and later established himself in Bombay.

He married into a prominent family in Meerut, Zamindar Raibahadur Budha Prakash&#x27;s daughter Sarla. They had two daughters, Anuradha (who had polio-associated complications) and Aparajita. Bhushan&#x27;s wife Sarla died of labour complications after delivering their second child in the early 1960s, soon after the release of film &quot;Barsaat Ki Raat&quot;. In 1967, he married actress Ratna, his co-star from &quot;Barsaat Ki Raat&quot;. Ratna was a prominent actress who played the sister or friend of the heroine in many films. Among her notable TV appearances was the serial Trishna as mother of the four young girls. It was an adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.

In an interview, his daughter Aparajita had said that after the sudden demise of her husband, she turned to acting. Aparajita has done more than 50 films and TV serials. She played the role of Mandodari in Ramanand Sagar&#x27;s famous serial &quot;Ramayan&quot;.

Bhushan owned a bungalow in Bandra suburb of Bombay. This was the famous Aashirwad bungalow, which he sold to Rajendra Kumar, who in turn sold it to Rajesh Khanna. This bungalow, was thus home to 3 famous film stars. Bhushan was an avid reader and boasted of a fine collection of books, which he had to sell off like his cars and bungalows in bad times, after he turned co-producer at the instance of his brother. Only a few of his films were successes and unfortunately, the rest flopped. He died after he escaped his financial crisis, on 27 January 1992.

<text>Shammi Kapoor (born Shamsher Raj Kapoor; ( ; 21 October 1931 – 14 August 2011) was an Indian actor known for his work in Hindi cinema. Kapoor is considered one of the greatest and most successful actors in the history of Indian cinema. In a career spanning over five decades, Kapoor worked in over 100 films. He is the recipient of three Filmfare Awards, including one for Best Actor.

Born to actor Prithviraj Kapoor and a member of the Kapoor family, he made his film debut with the commercially unsuccessful &quot;Jeewan Jyoti&quot; (1953). Following roles in continued box-office flops, he had his breakthrough with &quot;Tumsa Nahi Dekha&quot; (1957), which attained him the image of a stylish playboy and dancer, and subsequently gained further recognition with &quot;Dil Deke Dekho&quot; (1959). Kapoor rose to widespread recognition with the romantic blockbuster &quot;Junglee&quot; (1961), and went on to become one of the most marketable Bollywood stars throughout the 1960s, appearing in a number of highly successful films such as - &quot;Professor&quot; (1962), &quot;Dil Tera Diwana&quot; (1962), &quot;China Town&quot; (1962), &quot;Rajkumar&quot; (1964), &quot;Kashmir Ki Kali&quot; (1964), &quot;Janwar&quot; (1965), &quot;Teesri Manzil&quot; (1966), &quot;An Evening In Paris&quot; (1967), &quot;Brahmachari&quot; (1968) and &quot;Prince&quot; (1969). For &quot;Brahmachari&quot;, he won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.

Following his leading role in &quot;Andaz&quot; (1971), he began to appear in supporting roles. His notable such roles include - &quot;Parvarish&quot; (1977), &quot;Prem Rog&quot; (1982), &quot;Vidhaata&quot; (1982), &quot;Betaab&quot; (1983), &quot;Hero&quot; (1983), &quot;Sohni Mahiwal&quot; (1984), &quot;&quot; (1984), &quot;Hukumat&quot; (1987), &quot;Daata&quot; (1989), &quot;Tahalka&quot; (1992), &quot;Chamatkar&quot; (1992), &quot;Gardish&quot; (1993) and &quot;Rockstar&quot; (2011), which was his final film. For &quot;Vidhaata&quot;, he won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. Apart from acting, Kapoor is widely considered among the best dancers.

== Early life and family ==
Kapoor was born as Shamsher Raj Kapoor in Bombay (now Mumbai) to Prithviraj Kapoor and Ramsharni Mehra Kapoor. Shammi was the second of the three sons of Prithviraj (the other two being Raj Kapoor and Shashi Kapoor, both successful Hindi film actors). He is the nephew of actor Trilok Kapoor. His father&#x27;s first cousin was producer and filmmaker Surinder Kapoor. He was the first cousin of singer, Juggal Kishore Mehra, whose granddaughter is the actress-singer Salma Agha. Actors Randhir and Rishi are his nephews, while actor Ranbir is his grand nephew and actresses Karisma and Kareena are his grand nieces.

Though born in Mumbai, he spent a major portion of his childhood in Calcutta (now Kolkata), where his father was involved with New Theatres Studios, acting in films. It was in Kolkata that he did his Montessori education and Kindergarten. After coming back to Bombay, he first went to St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent (Wadala) and then, to Don Bosco School. He finished his matric schooling from New Era School at Hughes Road.

Kapoor had a short stint at Ramnarain Ruia College after which he joined his father&#x27;s theatrical company Prithvi Theatres. He entered the cinema world in 1948, as a junior artiste, at a salary of Rs. 50 per month, stayed with Prithvi Theatres for the next four years and collected his last paycheck of Rs. 300, in 1952. He made his debut in Hindi Films in the year 1953, when the film &quot;Jeewan Jyoti&quot; was released. It was directed by Mahesh Kaul and Chand Usmani was Kapoor&#x27;s first heroine. He was in a relationship with Nadia Gamal, a belly dancer from Cairo and Egyptian actress, from 1953–55 after they met in Sri Lanka on an occasion while he was on a holiday trip, but their relationship ended when she moved back to Cairo.

== Career ==
Shammi Kapoor debuted into Hindi films in 1953, with the release of &quot;Jeewan Jyoti&quot;, starring Shashikala and Leela Mishra. Kapoor&#x27;s career started unsuccessfully in the early 1950s with him acting with established actresses playing second fiddle in woman-oriented movies: with Madhubala in films such as &quot;Rail Ka Dibba&quot; (1953) and &quot;Naqab&quot; (1955), with Nutan in &quot;Laila Majnu&quot;, with Shyama in &quot;Thokar&quot; and with Nalini Jaywant in &quot;Hum Sab Chor Hain&quot; and &quot;Mehbooba&quot; &quot;Shama Parwana&quot; (1954) with Suraiya, comedy flick &quot;Mem Sahib&quot; (1956) with Meena Kumari, and thrillers like &quot;Chor Bazar&quot; (1954), as well as in the tragic love story &quot;Mirza Sahiban&quot; (1957) opposite Shyama. From 1953 to 1957, none of his films made him popular.

He had his first major success with Filmistan&#x27;s Nasir Hussain directed &quot;Tumsa Nahin Dekha&quot; (1957) opposite Ameeta and with &quot;Dil Deke Dekho&quot; (1959), he attained the image of a light-hearted, and stylish playboy. With the hugely successful &quot;Junglee&quot; (1961) his new image was cemented and his subsequent films were all in the romantic comedy and musical thriller genres. Mohammed Rafi was frequently chosen as his playback voice in the movies that he did and contributed to the success of his films. In the 1960s he was often paired with new actresses such as Asha Parekh, Saira Banu, Sharmila Tagore and Sadhana all of whom went on to have very successful careers. In the first half of the 1960s, Kapoor was seen in successful films like &quot;Junglee&quot;, &quot;Rajkumar&quot;, &quot;Professor&quot;, &quot;Dil Tera Diwana&quot;, &quot;China Town&quot;, &quot;Kashmir Ki Kali&quot;, &quot;Bluff Master&quot;, &quot;Janwar&quot; and &quot;Teesri Manzil&quot;.
In 1968, he received the first Filmfare Award for Best Actor of his career for &quot;Brahmachari&quot;. He made a unique place for himself in the industry as he was the only dancing hero in Hindi films from the late 1950s till the early 1970s. He used to compose dancing steps in the songs starring him and reportedly never needed a choreographer. This earned him the name of Elvis Presley of India.

His pairing opposite Southern heroines tended to be commercially successful. He played opposite B. Saroja Devi in &quot;Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya&quot; and &quot;Preet Na Jane Reet&quot;, with Padmini in &quot;Singapore&quot;, and opposite Vyjayanthimala in &quot;College Girl&quot; and &quot;Prince&quot; and with Ragini in &quot;Mujrim&quot;. In the late 1960s, his successful films included &quot;Budtameez&quot; and &quot;Sachaai&quot; with Sadhana, &quot;Brahmachari&quot; with Rajshree, &quot;Latt Saheb&quot; with Nutan, &quot;Tumse Achha Kaun Hai&quot; with Babita, &quot;An Evening in Paris&quot; with Sharmila Tagore and &quot;Prince&quot; with Vyjayanthimala.

In the 1970s, Kapoor&#x27;s weight problem proved an obstacle when playing the romantic hero, and the last such film he played in was &quot;Andaz&quot; (1971) co-starring superstar Rajesh Khanna and Hema Malini. &quot;Chhote Sarkar&quot; (1974) was his last movie in a lead role. He turned into a successful supporting actor in the 1970s, playing Saira Banu&#x27;s father in &quot;Zameer&quot; (1975), when he had been her leading man a decade earlier in &quot;Junglee&quot; (1961) and &quot;Bluff Master&quot; (1963) and playing Vinod Khanna&#x27;s father and Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s foster father in &quot;Parvarish&quot; (1977). He also directed &quot;Manoranjan&quot; (1974), a movie inspired from &quot;Irma La Douce&quot; and &quot;Bundal Baaz&quot; (1976). Neither were successful commercially though they got critical acclaim and were hailed as classics and ahead of their time.

In the 1980s, he continued to play many supporting roles in films like &quot;Prem Rog&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;Betaab&quot; and &quot;Vidhaata&quot; for which he won a Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor where big giants as Dilip Kumar and Sanjeev Kumar played major roles. He played a rare negative role in the 1992 film &quot;Tahalka&quot;.

In the 1990s he also appeared on television such as in the social drama serial called &quot;Chattan&quot; which aired on Zee TV for more than a year in the 1990s. He eventually cut down on film appearances by the late 1990s and early 2000s with appearances in the 1999 Salman Khan and Urmila Matondkar starrer &quot;Jaanam Samjha Karo&quot;, Dev Anand&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Censor,&quot; the 2002 release &quot;Waah! Tera Kya Kehna&quot; and the delayed 2006 release &quot;Sandwich&quot;.

Shortly before his death, he made his last film appearance in Imtiaz Ali&#x27;s 2011 directorial venture &quot;Rockstar&quot; co-starring his grand-nephew Ranbir Kapoor, the grandson of his brother Raj Kapoor.

Director Shakti Samanta directed Shammi Kapoor in six films — &quot;Singapore&quot;, &quot;China Town&quot;, &quot;Kashmir Ki Kali&quot;, &quot;An Evening In Paris&quot;, &quot;Pagla Kahin Ka&quot; and &quot;Jaane Anjane&quot; (the last two were unsuccessful) — and said in an interview &quot;I found Shammi to be a thoroughly good man. Even in his heyday, he was humble.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Kapoor met actress Geeta Bali in 1955, during the film &quot;Miss Coca Cola&quot;. They fell in love while shooting of the film &quot;Rangeen Raaten&quot;, where he was the leading actor and she played a cameo.

Four years later, Kapoor married Neila Devi Gohil, a princess of the Gohil dynasty of Bhavnagar State, on 27 January 1969.

In an interview in 2011, Mumtaz had stated that Kapoor had proposed marriage to her, as they had drawn close while shooting for &quot;Brahmachari&quot;. Mumtaz states that she had politely refused, as Kapoor wanted her to give up her career.

<text>Geeta Dutt (born Geeta Ghosh Roy Chowdhuri; 23 November 1930 – 20 July 1972) was an Indian classical and playback singer. She found particular prominence as a playback singer in Hindi cinema and Bengali cinema and is considered as one of the best playback singers of all time in Hindi films. She also sang many modern Bengali songs in the non-film genre.

==Early life==
Geeta Ghosh Roy Chowdhuri was one of 10 children born to a wealthy zamindar family in a village named Idilpur, Madaripur Subdivision under Faridpur district in Bengal, British India presently under Gosairhat Upazila of Shariatpur District, Bangladesh. Her family moved to Calcutta and Assam in the early 1940s, leaving behind their land and properties. In 1942, her parents moved to an apartment in Bombay. Geeta was twelve and continued her schooling at the Bengali High School.

==Singing career==

K. Hanuman Prasad took Geeta under his patronage, trained and groomed her in singing and later launched her into singing for movies. In 1946, she got the first break with an opportunity to sing in the mythological film &quot;Bhakta Prahlad&quot; for which Prasad was the music director. She was given two lines to sing for two songs. She was sixteen at that time.

==Personal life==
During Geeta&#x27;s recording of songs for the movie &quot;Baazi&quot;, she met its young up-and-coming director, Guru Dutt. Their romance culminated in marriage on 26 May 1953. Together they had three children: Tarun (1954–1985), Arun (1956–2014) and Nina (b. 1964). 

She also cut a number non-film discs, singing to the tune of notable music directors like Sudhin Dasgupta and Anal Chatterjee.

In 1957, Guru Dutt launched the film &quot;Gauri&quot; with Geeta Dutt as its singing star. It was to be India&#x27;s first movie in cinemascope but the project was shelved after just a few days of the shooting. By then, Guru Dutt had got romantically involved with Waheeda Rehman and Geeta had taken to drinking. The break up of their marriage affected Geeta&#x27;s singing career.

In 1964, Guru Dutt died from a combination of alcohol and an overdose of sleeping pills. (His death was widely perceived as a suicide following two earlier attempts). This shattered Geeta, who then suffered a serious nervous breakdown and ran into financial problems. She tried to resume her singing career, cutting discs at Durgā Pujā and giving stage shows. She performed a leading role in a Bengali movie, &quot;Badhu Baran&quot; (1967), and sang admirably in &quot;Anubhav&quot; (1971), to the music of Kanu Roy. Geeta Dutt&#x27;s final performance was for Midnight in 1972 (unreleased) Two duets, one of which was with Talat Mahmood.

==Death==
Geeta Dutt died on 20 July 1972 due to cirrhosis aged 41, in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

==Notable songs==

She has sung over 1417 songs in Hindi films. In addition, she has sung songs in many other Indian languages including Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Maithili, Bhojpuri and Punjabi. She has sung in Nepali evergreen movie &quot;Maitighar&quot;.

Some of the songs sung under S. D. Burman&#x27;s direction:

* &quot;Mera Sundar Sapna Beet Gaya&quot; (&quot;Do Bhai&quot; – 1947)
* &quot;Woh Sapne Waali Raat&quot; (&quot;Pyaar&quot; – 1950)
* &quot;Tadbir Se Bigdi Hui Taqdeer&quot; (&quot;Baazi&quot; – 1951)
* &quot;Aan Milo Aan Milo&quot; (&quot;Devdas&quot; – 1955 ) With Manna Dey

<text>Raymond James Barbuti (June 12, 1905 – July 8, 1988) was an American football player and sprint runner who won two gold medals at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Barbuti traveled to Amsterdam to initially only compete for the 400meter sprint however the US medal position was meek and then US Olympic committee president, Major General Douglas MacArthur insisted after Barbuti won the 400meter gold that he run in the 4 X 400 meter relay the next day. Barbuti was interrupted by MacArthur during his celebratory evening to start preparing to run the anchor for the event the next day. Barbuti initially, vehemently refused, claiming he would not displace a fellow US runner in search for further medals. However MacArthur was relentless and finally prevailed and history commenced with the team winning the gold.

In 1924 while playing fullback at Lawrence, Long Island, New York high school, Barbuti set a New York state record, which still stands (2013), scoring eight touchdowns in one game. He attended Syracuse University, where he won the IC4A championship in the 400 m sprint in 1928 in a time of 48.8 seconds. The same year he won the AAU Championship in the 400 m dash in a time of 51.4. He played fullback on the Syracuse football teams of 1926, 1927, and 1928 and was the captain of both the football and athletics teams.

His trainer, Peter Poole, very seldom let him run his two preferred distances, the 200 yd and the 400 yd, in the same competition, so Barbuti chose the 400 m and 4 × 400 m at the 1928 Summer Olympics and won both, setting a world record in the relay at 3:14.2. Next week he set another world record, at 3:13.4 in the 4×440 yd relay in London in a match against Great Britain.

During World War II Barbuti served with the US Air Force in the 83rd Bombardment Squadron which was part of the 12th Bombardment Group also known as the Earthquakers. He was awarded the Air Medal and the Bronze Star. While stationed in Gambut, Libya, Barbuti helped to organize the Western Desert Track and Field Championships. The competition was between the 12th Bombardment&#x27;s track men, members of the RAF, and Australian troops. With Barbuti&#x27;s talent on the track as a runner and as a coach, the men of the 12th won 1st place in 8 out of 11 events. He retired in the rank of major and became deputy director of the Civil Defense Commission for New York State and director of the New York State Office of Disaster Preparedness. In his spare time he acted as a referee in more than 500 intercollegiate football games.

On December 24, 1957, Barbuti appeared as a &quot;contestant imposter&quot; on the game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. This episode is still in existence and was most recently aired by GSN on January 20, 2009. The host was Bud Collyer and the panel consisted of Betsy Palmer, Don Ameche, Kitty Carlisle and Hy Gardner.

<doc id="603992" wikidata="Q156310" url="?curid=603992" title="Manna Dey">
<text>Prabodh Chandra Dey (1 May 1919 − 24 October 2013), known by his stage name Manna Dey, was an Indian playback singer, music director, and musician. He had a classical music background, being part of the Bhendibazaar Gharana and receiving training under Ustad Aman Ali Khan. Manna Dey is widely recognized as one of the most versatile and celebrated vocalists in the Hindi film industry, and is often acknowledged for his significant contributions to integrating Indian classical music into Hindi commercial cinema. As a musician, Dey is particularly acclaimed for incorporating Indian classical music elements into a pop musical framework, a contribution that played a pivotal role during the golden era of Hindi cinema.

Throughout his career spanning over five decades, Dey recorded a total of 3,047 songs. While the majority of his songs were in Bengali and Hindi, he showcased his singing prowess in 14 other Indian languages, including Bhojpuri, Punjabi, Assamese, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, and Chhattisgarhi. His musical zenith was observed during the mid-1950s to the 1970s.

For his outstanding contributions to Indian music, Manna Dey received several prestigious accolades from the Government of India. He was honored with the Padma Shri in 1971, followed by the Padma Bhushan in 2005 and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2007.

==Early life==
Dey was born in a Bengali family to Mahamaya and Purna Chandra Dey on 1 May 1919 in Calcutta (Now Kolkata). Besides his parents, his youngest paternal uncle, Sangeetacharya Krishna Chandra Dey highly inspired and influenced him. He received his early education at Indu Babur Pathshala, a small pre-primary school. He started doing stage shows in school from 1929. He attended Scottish Church Collegiate School and Scottish Church College. He participated in sports events like wrestling and boxing in his college days, taking training from Gobar Guha. He graduated from Vidyasagar College.

Dey began taking music lessons from Krishna Chandra Dey and Ustad Dabir Khan. During this period of learning, he stood first for three consecutive years in three different categories of inter-collegiate singing competitions.

==Career==

===Early career (1942–1953)===
In 1942, Dey accompanied Krishna Chandra Dey on a visit to Bombay. There he started working as an assistant music director first under Krishna Chandra Dey in a Bengali film &quot;Chanakya&quot; in 1939 and then under Sachin Dev Burman. Later, he assisted other music composers and then started to work independently. While working independently as a music director for various Hindi movies, Dey continued to take musical lessons in Hindustani classical music from Ustad Aman Ali Khan and Ustad Abdul Rahman Khan. He often works with near about 185 music directors in his singing career in Bollywood.

Dey started his career in playback singing with the movie &quot;Tamanna&quot;, in 1942. The musical score was by Krishna Chandra Dey and Manna sang a duet named &quot;Jago Aayee Usha Ponchi Boley Jago&quot; with Suraiya which was an instant hit.

But it was only in 1943 that he got his first solo break with &quot;Ram Rajya&quot;. Incidentally, the producer of the film Vijay Bhatt and its composer Shankar Rao Vyas had approached K C Dey with an offer for playback in the film. When K C Dey refused the offer on the grounds that he would not lend his voice to other actors, they spotted Manna Dey sitting in the corner of the room and offered him the opportunity.

Shankar Rao Vyas taught Manna Dey the songs and he chose to sing them in his uncle&#x27;s distinct style. And thus started the illustrious career with the first song &quot;Gayi tu gayi Seeta sati&quot; (&quot;Ram Rajya&quot;, 1943).

His songs like &quot;O Prem Diwani Sambhal Ke Chalna&quot; from 1944 film &quot;Kadambari&quot; composed by Anil Biswas, &quot;Dil Churaney Ki Liye from Dur Chaley&quot; (1946) composed by Jafar Khurshid, his duets with Amira Bahee like &quot;E Diniya Jara Suney&quot; from &quot;Kamala&quot; (1946) and duet song &quot;Aaj Bor Aayee&quot; with Meena Kapoor from 1947 film &quot;Chaltey Chaltey&quot; became chartbusters in respective years. Between 1945 and 1947, many Dey-Rajkumari duets like &quot;Hay Gagan Me Badal Tharey&quot; in 1945 for the film &quot;Vikaramaditya&quot;, &quot;Aowji Morey&quot; from &quot;Insaaf&quot; (1946), all four duets from the film &quot;Geet Govind&quot; composed by Pandit Indra – &quot;Kit Ho Nando Kumar&quot;, &quot;Chorr Sakhi Aaj Laj&quot;, &quot;Apney Hi Rang&quot;, &quot;Lalit Labang Lata&quot; from &quot;Geet Govind&quot; became popular.

He sang for first time songs composed by Sachin Dev Burman, &quot;Upar Gagan Vishal&quot; and &quot;Duniya Ke Logo&quot; in the 1950 movie &quot;Mashal&quot;, which became popular and from here his association with S.D.Burman began. Its lyrics were written by Kavi Pradeep. In 1952, Dey sang for a Bengali and a Marathi movie with the same name and storyline, &quot;Amar Bhupali&quot;. This established him as a leading playback singer in Bengali films and Marathi films as well by 1953.

In the post independence period, after 1947, Dey was regularly used by music composers Anil Biswas, Shankar Rao Vyas, S.K.Pal, S.D.Burman, Khem Chand Prakash, Mohd.Safi from 1947 to 1957. Dey-Anil Biswas combination gave hit numbers from films like &quot;Gajre&quot; (1948), &quot;Hum Bhi Insaan Hai&quot; (1948), &quot;Do Sitaare&quot; (1951), &quot;Hamdard&quot; (1953), &quot;Mahatma Kabir&quot; (1954), &quot;Jasoos&quot; (1957) and &quot;Pardesi&quot; (1957). Though Anil Biswas worked with Dey in very few films, their songs remain famous. He recorded his first duet with Shamshad Begum, who was the Hindi female singer most in demand from 1940 to 1961, &quot;Phoolon Ka Swapna&quot; in the films &quot;Girls School&quot; (1949) composed by S.K.Pal.

His first duet with the then upcoming singer Lata Mangeshkar was &quot;Lapat Ke Pot Pahaney Bikral&quot; composed by Vasant Desai for &quot;Narsingh Avtar&quot; (1949), and with Kishore Kumar it was &quot;Subaho Ki Paheli Kiran&quot; from 1951 film &quot;Anadolan&quot; composed by Pannalal Ghosh. His first duet with Geeta Dutt was &quot;Dhonyo Dhonyo He Ayodh Puri&quot; from the film &quot;Ram Vivah&quot; (1949) composed by Shankar Rao Vyas, first duet with Umadevi (Tun Tun) was &quot;Hay Ye Hain&quot; from &quot;Jangal Ka Jaanwar&quot; (1951) composed by Ghantshala. His first duet with the then struggling singer Asha Bhosle was &quot;O Raat Gayee Fir Din Aya&quot; from 1953 film &quot;Bootpolish&quot;.

Dey established his verstality between 1948 and 1954 by singing not only the classical based film songs but also singing such film songs which were fusion of Indian classical music and pop music and by giving classical music concerts. His experimentation with western music too produced many unforgettable melodies resulting in an increase in singing offers in films from 1955. He began singing ghazals in Hindi films from 1953. He became a music composer in Hindi films when he composed music along with Khemchand Prakash for both &quot;Shri Ganesh Janma&quot; (1951) starring Trilok Kapoor and Nirupa Roy and &quot;Vishwamitra&quot; (1952).

===1953–1967===

By 1954, Dey became popular among musical circle across film industries of various Indian languages. He became nationally famous after release of (1953) where two of the songs sung by him and composed by Salil Choudhury became hits. Salil Choudhury worked with Dey from 1953 to 1992 in Hindi films and made Dey sing even in Bengali and Malayalam films right from the late 1950s to early 1990s. His association with Shankar–Jaikishan and producer Raj Kapoor had begun while working for &quot;Awara&quot;, but their combination became famous while working together for &quot;Boot Polish&quot; in 1954. The trio worked in many films together from 1954 to 1971 whose musical scores were appreciated, irrespective of their box-office fate, like &quot;Shree 420&quot;, &quot;Chori Chori&quot;, &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot;, &quot;Awaara&quot;, and &quot;Kal Aaj Aur Kal&quot;. He also sang for Raj Kapoor in Parvarish, Sriman Satyavadi (both with music by Dattaram), Dil Hi To Hai (music by Roshan), and Abdullah (music by R.D. Burman). The Raj Kapoor-Manna Dey combination produced superhits (both music and film, the only exception being &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot; where the songs were chartbusters but the film was a flop) and was a pair to reckon with. While Mukesh sang the slow pathos for Raj Kapoor, Dey sang the fast peppy ones, the classical numbers, the romantic duets (in case one analyses Dey has sung more than 95% of Raj Kapoor&#x27;s superhit duets) and the naughty numbers. Dey has the rare distinction of doing playback for both father and son – Raj Kapoor and Randhir Kapoor (In fact Dey later sang for Rishi Kapoor in Zamane ko dikhana hai). C. Ramchandra worked with Dey very first time in &quot;Insaniyaat&quot; in 1955 and then recorded songs with Dey consistently even in the 1960s in films like – &quot;Tallaq&quot; (1959), &quot;Navrang&quot;, &quot;Paigham&quot;, &quot;Stree&quot; (1961), &quot;Veer Bhimsen&quot; etc.

In 1956, he sang with a new batch of singers. He recorded his first duets with Sudha Malhotra &quot;Ghar Ghar Deep Jalao Re&quot; from &quot;Ayodhyapati&quot; in 1956, with Binata Chatterjee in the duet &quot;Tum Mile Mil Gaye Karaar&quot; from &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1956) composed by Suresh Talwar, and then his first duet with Sabita Banerjee in the song &quot;Jamine Hamari Jamana&quot; composed by A.R.Quereshi from &quot;Laal-E-Yaman&quot; (1956) and with singer Meena Kapoor in the song &quot;Rim Jhim Jhim Rim Jhim&quot; from Pardesi (1957) composed by Anil Biswas.

Dey turned into an independent music composer in Hindi films with &quot;Maha Poojaa&quot; in 1954. He sang eighty-three Hindi songs in three years from 1953 to 1955 and his demand increased such that he sang 45 songs in the year 1956. His career reached in peak form when he recorded 95 Hindi songs in single year 1957 and 64 in 1958. His peak period in Hindi film industry is considered to be from 1953 to 1969 where he recorded 758 Hindi songs of which 631 came between 1957 and 1969. He worked extensively with other music directors like Naushad, K.Dutta, Vasant Pawar &amp; Ram, Vasant Desai, Ravi, S.K.Pal, Avinash Vyas, S. N. Tripathi, Sanmukh Babu, Nissar Bazmi, Husanlal Bhagatram, B.N. Bali, Sushanta Banerjee, O.P. Nayyar, G.Ramanathan, T.G.Lingappa, Nirmal Kumar, Ghulam Mohhammed, Bipin Dutta, Rabin Banerjee, Roshan, Sapan Jagmohan from 1954 to 1968.

New age composers like Kalyanji-Anandji started recording songs with Dey from 1958 and Laxmikant Pyarelal from 1964. Rahul Dev Burman made Dey sing the westernised songs – &quot;Aao Twist Karen&quot; and &quot;Pyar Karta Ja&quot; which became chartbusters in 1965. But the composers who gave Dey consistent popular song numbers in commercially successful films from 1955 to 1969 were S.D.Burman, C.Ramachandra, Ravi, Avinash Vyas, Vasant Desai, Anil Biswas, Salil Choudhury and Shankar Jaikishan. The solo songs sung by Dey like &quot;Lapak Jhapak Tu Aa Re&quot; from &quot;Boot Polish&quot; (1954), &quot;O Gori Tori Tu Pyar Ka Sagar Hai&quot; from &quot;Seema&quot; (1955), &quot;Yeh Kahani Hai Diye Aur Toofan Ki&quot; from &quot;Diya Aur Toofan&quot; (1956) composed by Vasant Desai, &quot;Humdum Se Gaye&quot; from &quot;Manzil&quot; (1960), &quot;Aye Mere Pyare Watan&quot; from &quot;Kabuliwala&quot; (1961), &quot;Laga Chunari Mein Daag&quot; from &quot;Dil Hi Toh Hai&quot; (1963), classical songs like &quot;Sur Na Saje&quot; from &quot;Basant Bahar&quot; (1956), &quot;Kaun Aya Mere Mann&quot; from &quot;Dekh Kabira Roya&quot; (1957), &quot;Pucho Na Kaise Maine Rain&quot; from &quot;Meri Surat Teri Aankhen&quot; (1963), &quot;Jhanak Jhanak Tore Baje Payalia&quot; from &quot;Mere Huzoor&quot; (1965); folk based songs like &quot;Kisi Chilman Se&quot; from &quot;Baat Ek Raat Ki&quot; (1962), &quot;Ae Meri Zohra Jabeen&quot; from &quot;Waqt&quot; (1965), &quot;Chalat Musafir Moh Liya&quot; from &quot;Teesri Kasam&quot; (1967), &quot;Aao Aao Sawariya&quot;, and duets with Lata like &quot;Masti Bhara Yeh Sama&quot; from &quot;Parvarish&quot; (1958), &quot;Nain Mile Chain Kahan&quot; from &quot;Basant Bahar&quot;(1956), &quot;Kehdoji Kehdo Chupaona Pyar&quot; from &quot;Kismat Ka Khel&quot; (1956), &quot;Tum Gagan Ke Chandrama&quot; from &quot;Sati Savitri&quot; (1964), &quot;Dil Ki Girah&quot; from &quot;Raat Aur Din&quot; (1966), &quot;Chunari Sambhal Gori&quot; from &quot;Baharon Ke Sapne&quot; (1967), were chartbusters in their respective year of release. Credit is also given to Dey for popularising classical based solo and duet songs to the masses like the duet with Lata – &quot;Pritam Daras Dikhao&quot; from &quot;Chacha Zindabad&quot; (1959), became a popular song though it was based on classical Raag Lalit. His rendition of &quot;Kasame Vaade Pyar&quot; from &quot;Upkar&quot; (1967) pictured on Pran and composed by Kalyanji Anandji won accolades for Dey, and was also significant in Pran&#x27;s career as he began to do positive roles.

Dey gave playback for Raj Kapoor in &quot;Shree 420&quot; (Mud Mud Ke Na Dekh), &quot;Chori Chori&quot; (Yeh Raat Bheegi, Jahan Main Jati and Aja Sanam), &quot;Parvarish&quot; (Masti bhara hai sama), &quot;Dil Hi To Hai&quot; (Laga chunari mein daag), &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot; (Ae bhai zara dekh ke chalo) and &quot;Ek Paon Chal Raha Hai&quot; from &quot;Kal Aaj Aur Kal&quot; (1971).

He sang for Balraj Sahni in many films from 1950 till 1969 and was voice of Mehmood and Anoop Kumar in many films from 1960 to 1975.

===1968–1991===
Kishore Kumar and Dey had recorded only 6 songs together until 1968 and all proved to be hits, some of them being &quot;Ye Duniya hai usaki nyari hai&quot; from Sauraksha composed by Bappi Lahiri, &quot;Ye Dosti humnai todenge&quot; from Sholay, &quot;Tubhi Piya Chikara Hoon&quot; and &quot;Tu Jaam Liye Jaa&quot; from &quot;Bewakoof&quot; (1960), &quot;Babu Samjho Ishaare&quot; from &quot;Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi&quot; (1958) all three composed by S.D. Burman and &quot;Baheta Pani Baheta Jaye&quot; from &quot;Dhaake Ke Malmal&quot; composed by C. Ramachandra, &quot;Joyo Joyo Mere Lal&quot; composed by S.K. Pal in 1952 and their first duet together – &quot;Subaho Ki Paheli Kiran&quot; in 1951 from &quot;Andolan&quot;. In 1968, R.D. Burman brought them together for &quot;Ek Chatur Naar&quot; in Padosan. Reportedly the song &quot;Ek Chatur Naar&quot; (a duet by Kishore Kumar and Manna Dey) from &quot;Padosan&quot; (1965) was partly improvised by Kishore Kumar at the time of recording and Dey, determined to show Kishore Kumar how he would sing the duet better (since Kishore had not been trained classically), got into the mood of the song and immortalised &quot;Ek Chatur Naar&quot;. Dey recorded around 31 songs with Kishore from 1951 to 1987 and all of them became chartbusters. From 1969, after release of &quot;Aradhana&quot;, the highest in demand playback singer was Kishore Kumar, so careers of Mukesh, Rafi and Dey were affected and they got lesser number of songs to sing. His peak period as a playback singer is considered to be from 1953 to 1969 and in the year 1969 it seemed that Dey&#x27;s career in Hindi films would be over due to resurgence of Kishore Kumar but he had an extended peak period till 1976. The song &quot;Tujhe Suraj Kahun Ya Chanda&quot; from &quot;Ek Phool Do Mali&quot; in 1969, S.D. Burman composition &quot;Mitwa Mitwa Piya Maine Kya Kiya&quot; from &quot;Us Paar&quot; (1974) and his duet with Shailendra Singh from &quot;Bobby&quot; – &quot;Na Maangoon Sona Chandi&quot; were a chartbusters in respective years. His song &quot;Sawan Ki Rimjhim Main&quot; was aired in non-film program section in Vividh Bharati and became popular on the radio.

He received a fresh lease of life in his playback singing career from 1971 after Rajesh Khanna allowed music directors to picturise or feature songs sung by Dey in films with Khanna in lead role beginning with Anand, composed by Salil Chowdahry. For Rajesh Khanna, Dey had sung songs &quot;Zindagi kaisi hai paheli&quot; (&quot;Anand&quot;, 1971), &quot;Tum bin jeewan kaisa jeewan&quot; and &quot;Bhor Aaye Gaya Andhera&quot; (&quot;Bawarchi&quot;, 1972), &quot;Nadiya Chale Re&quot; (song sung with Rajesh and Dey), &quot;Hasne ki chah ne kitna mujhe&quot; (&quot;Avishkaar&quot;, 1973) and &quot;Gori tori paijaniya&quot; (&quot;Mehbooba&quot;, 1976). Later in a 2012 interview, Dey said, &quot;I loved the way he picturised music. The success of a song depends upon how an actor picturises it. He was the number one in picturising songs. I will be ever indebted to him.&quot; From 1970 to 1983, he recorded around 503 songs used in Hindi films. Thereafter he became selective of the kinds of songs he sings and chose to do less work in Hindi.

The demand for Kishore-Dey combination only grew after 1972. Their popular songs were &quot;Mere Pyale Mein&quot; from &quot;Aamir Garib&quot; (1974), &quot;Is Ishq Mein Har&quot; from &quot;Mr. Romeo&quot; (1974), &quot;Yeh Dosti&quot; from &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975), &quot;Duniya Me Jeeney&quot; from &quot;Naukri&quot;, &quot;Kamal Hain&quot; from &quot;Karz&quot;, &quot;Phool Chaahiye Na&quot; from &quot;Pyas&quot; (1982) and their last duet was in 1986 film &quot;Maqqar&quot; – &quot;Tu Hi Mera Sapna&quot;. Salil Chowdhry compositions rendered by Dey from films like &quot;Ananad&quot; and &quot;Anadatta&quot; became popular as well. Also the trio of Kishore-Rafi-Dey sang together hits like &quot;Tujhme Ishwar, Allah Tujhme&quot; from &quot;Nanha Farishta&quot; (1969) and &quot;Band Mutthee&quot; from &quot;Chalti Ka Naam Zindagi&quot; (1981). Kishore-Dey together also sang with Asha in many films and famous among them are &quot;Khan Chacha&quot; from &quot;Dil Deewana&quot; (1974), &quot;Aa Kitni Sundar Jagah&quot; from &quot;Chandi Sona&quot;, both composed by R.D. Burman and with Lata in &quot;Goyakechu Nanche&quot; from &quot;Manoranjan&quot; (1974), &quot;Logo Ke Juban Me Apna&quot; from &quot;Nehla Pe Dehla&quot;, both composed by Pancham.

Lata and Dey recorded fusion songs, which used both Indian and western instruments. Several such songs included the duets &quot;Kaanhaa Bole Naa&quot; and &quot;Balma Moraa Aanchaar&quot; for the film &quot;Sangat&quot;, composed by Salil Chowdhury in 1975, which became very popular and was picturised on Rakesh Pandey and Kajri. The song &quot;Neela peela hara gulabi&quot; is a famous Holi song sung by Lata with Dey in &quot;Aap Bete&quot; (1976). In 1974, Dey sang along with Lata-Kishore in the song &quot;Goyakechu Nanche&quot; from &quot;Manoranjan&quot; (1974) which became a chartbuster in 1974. Dey continued to have hit Hindi songs to his credit from 1971 to 1986, such as &quot;Dulhan Banungi&quot; from &quot;Who Jo Hasina&quot; (1983), composed by Raamlaxman and sung with Lata, &quot;Aankhon Ka Salaam Lo&quot; with Lata-Rafi in &quot;Samraat&quot;, &quot;Dilwaale Dilwaale&quot; from &quot;Kranti&quot; (1981), &quot;Yaari Hai Imaan&quot; from &quot;Zanjeer&quot;, &quot;Ye Duniya Hey Usi Ko&quot; sung with Kishore-Usha from &quot;Suraksha&quot; (1979), &quot;Tum Besahara Ho To Kisi&quot; from &quot;Anurodh&quot; (1977), &quot;Jo Likha Gaya Hai&quot; from &quot;Umar Qaid&quot; (1975), among others. &quot;Sab Kho Diya Sab Pa Liya&quot; from &quot;Maqqar&quot; (1986), composed by Rajesh Roshan was the last duet of Lata-Dey for a Hindi film and was a chartbuster.

<text>The Norwegian Football Cup () is the main knockout cup competition in Norwegian football. It is run by the Football Association of Norway and has been contested since 1902, making it the oldest football tournament in the country. The tournament is commonly known as &quot;Cupen&quot; (&quot;The Cup&quot;), NM or NM Cup (&quot;NM Cupen&quot;), an acronym formed from &quot;Norgesmesterskap&quot; (&quot;Norwegian Championship&quot;). These terms are used to describe both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions. The equivalent competition for women&#x27;s teams is the Norwegian Women&#x27;s Football Cup.

The Norwegian Football Cup is a national championship, meaning that while the Eliteserien may be the most prestigious competition to win, it is the winners of the Cup who are awarded the title &quot;Norwegian football champions&quot;. This differs from, for example, English football, where the winners of the Premier League are the ones who become English champions.

Winners receive the King&#x27;s trophy. Winners also qualify for the Europa League second qualifying round and a place in the Mesterfinalen, the Norwegian super cup match. The current Norwegian champions and holders of the cup are Fredrikstad, who defeated Molde 5–4 on penalties (0-0 AET) in the 2024 final. Odd, Fredrikstad and Rosenborg are the most successful clubs with 12 titles each.

==History==
The first cup was played in 1902, and Oscar II presented the King&#x27;s Cup to the inaugural tournament. This was an invitation tournament organised by Kristiania IF and the Norwegian Football Association, which was later given official status. Five teams joined the competition, and Odd reached the final without playing a match. Grane won the first Norwegian Cup after they defeated Odd 2–0 at Gamle Frogner Stadion, Kristiania. The first tournament who had official status at the time of the events was the 1904 Norwegian Cup and was won by Odd. In the beginning, the cup was open for county champions only. This continued until 1917, when the cup was opened for all clubs of a certain standing. League football began with the 1937–38 season, and Fredrikstad became the first team to win a domestic double by winning both the league and the cup in the same year. Due to the outbreak of World War II, the competition was not played between the 1940 and 1945 editions. The competition was not nationwide until 1963. 1963 was the first year clubs from Northern Norway were allowed to participate, this was due to a poor communication system in the northern parts of Norway and to the belief that the clubs in the three northern counties could not compete on the same level as the southern clubs (Bodø/Glimt – one of the two northern newcomers – did stay in the cup to the fourth round that year). Until 1963, teams from Northern Norway competed in their own Northern Norwegian Championships.

Before the 2004 cup final, NRK awarded the 1986 final between Tromsø and Lillestrøm with the title &quot;Tidenes Cupfinale&quot; (Best cup final ever), and ex-Rosenborg striker Gøran Sørloth with &quot;Tidenes Cuphelt&quot; (Best cup hero ever).

The final has been played at Ullevaal Stadion since the 1948 cup final.

==Format==
===Overview===
Before the proper rounds take place, two qualifying rounds are played in March and April. 176 clubs from tier 4 and 5 enter the first qualifying round and 44 of these advance to the first round where they are joined by 84 teams from tiers 1, 2 and 3.

The first round of the cup are played in April, around the same time as the Eliteserien season starts. The first two rounds are set up by the Norwegian Football Association, and the top flight teams are usually pitted against fairly weak amateur teams, often in rural areas, on the amateur team&#x27;s home pitch. Early upsets, where an amateur team knocks a professional team out of the tournament do happen occasionally. For example, in 2012 the Eliteserien teams Sandnes Ulf and Sogndal were knocked out in the first round by the third division (fourth tier) teams Staal Jørpeland IL and Florø SK respectively. Even if the amateur team loses, squaring off against a professional team may well be the highlight of their season.
From the third round to the semi-final, matchups are drawn at random, the teams face off once, and the winner goes on to the next round. The final match is played at Ullevaal Stadium (national stadium) in November or December, and takes place near the end of the Norwegian football season.

The cup is very popular in Norway, and tickets for the final match are hard to get hold of, as the game usually sells out quickly. The supporters of the two teams playing in the final match are seated at the two short-ends of the pitch, while the more neutral supporters are seated by the long-ends. The match is also televised on national television.

===Schedule===
Most entrants from level 4 and all entrants from level 5 have to play to qualifying rounds to join the competition proper. Reserve teams of Eliteserien clubs, who are eligible to play in 2. divisjon (level 3) cannot enter. Depending on the number of reserve teams, the first round proper will be filled with the best clubs from level 4 until the number of teams from levels 1–4 is 84. Clubs from higher levels are then added in the first round, as per the table below. The months in which rounds are played are traditional, with exact dates subject to each year&#x27;s calendar.
===Tiebreaking===
In all rounds, if a fixture result in a draw after normal time, the winner is settled by a period of extra time, and if still necessary, a penalty shootout. Earlier, fixtures resulting in a draw (after normal time) would go to a replay, played at the venue of the away team.

The first Cup Final to go to a replay was the 1945 final, between Lyn and Fredrikstad. The initial tie finished 1–1 and the first replay also finished 1–1. Lyn won the second replay 4–0. The only other time the final has taken three matches to settle was the 1965 final between Oslo rivals Skeid and Frigg (2–2, 1–1, 2–1). The last replayed final was the 1995 final, when Rosenborg and Brann fought a 1–1 draw. The replay saw Rosenborg win the Cup, with the score 3–1. The first final to be decided by a penalty shootout was the 2009 final between Molde and Aalesund. The score ended 1–1 after normal time and 2–2 after extra time. Aalesund won the final 5–4 on penalties.

==Qualification for subsequent competitions==

===European football===
Prior to 2020, the Cup winners qualified for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Europa League (formerly named the UEFA Cup; from its launch in 1960 until 1998, they entered the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup instead). Effecting from the 2020 Norwegian Cup, winners qualify for the UEFA Europa Conference League. This European place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the Norwegian top flight. In the past, if the Cup winning team also qualified for the following season&#x27;s Champions League or Europa League through their league position, then the losing Cup finalist were given this European berth instead. Norwegian Cup winners enter the Europa League at the second qualifying round. Losing finalists, if they haven&#x27;t qualified for Europe via the league, began earlier, at the first qualifying round. From the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League season, however, UEFA does not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition. If the winner – and until 2015, the runner-up –
has already qualified for Europe through their league position (with the exception of the UEFA Cup until 1998), the Cup berth was then given to the highest-place team in the league who has not yet qualified.

==Women==

Since 1978, an official cup for women&#x27;s clubs has also been played. The women&#x27;s cup final is usually played on a Saturday, the day before the men&#x27;s cup final. The 1978 cup final between BUL and Trondheims-Ørn was the only Norwegian cup final to be decided on penalties.

Before the 2006 final, the Norwegian Football Association decided that the Women&#x27;s final would be played at Bislett Stadium instead of Ullevaal Stadion, which caused some debate. The Football Association claimed that two matches over one weekend would cause too much wear on the Ullevaal pitch, while representatives for the clubs claimed that the move was discriminating against women&#x27;s football. When the semi-finals of the 2006 cup were drawn, all 4 clubs boycotted the draw in a protest against the move.

<text>Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (American English) or tumours of the haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (British English) are tumors that affect the blood, bone marrow, lymph, and lymphatic system. Because these tissues are all intimately connected through both the circulatory system and the immune system, a disease affecting one will often affect the others as well, making aplasia, myeloproliferation and lymphoproliferation (and thus the leukemias and the lymphomas) closely related and often overlapping problems.
While uncommon in solid tumors, chromosomal translocations are a common cause of these diseases. This commonly leads to a different approach in diagnosis and treatment of hematological malignancies.
Hematological malignancies are malignant neoplasms (&quot;cancer&quot;), and they are generally treated by specialists in hematology and/or oncology. In some centers &quot;hematology/oncology&quot; is a single subspecialty of internal medicine while in others they are considered separate divisions (there are also surgical and radiation oncologists). Not all hematological disorders are malignant (&quot;cancerous&quot;); these other blood conditions may also be managed by a hematologist.

Hematological malignancies may derive from either of the two major blood cell lineages: myeloid and lymphoid cell lines. The myeloid cell line normally produces granulocytes, erythrocytes, thrombocytes, macrophages and mast cells; the lymphoid cell line produces B, T, NK and plasma cells. Lymphomas, lymphocytic leukemias, and myeloma are from the lymphoid line, while acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative diseases are myeloid in origin.

A subgroup of them are more severe and are known as haematological malignancies (British English)/hematological malignancies (American English) or blood cancer. They may also be referred to as liquid tumors.

==Diagnosis==
For the analysis of a suspected &quot;hematological malignancy&quot;, a complete blood count and blood film are essential, as malignant cells can show in characteristic ways on light microscopy. When there is lymphadenopathy, a biopsy from a lymph node is generally undertaken surgically. In general, a bone marrow biopsy is part of the &quot;work up&quot; for the analysis of these diseases. All specimens are examined microscopically to determine the nature of the malignancy. A number of these diseases can now be classified by cytogenetics (AML, CML) or immunophenotyping (lymphoma, myeloma, CLL) of the malignant cells.

===Classification===
Historically, hematological malignancies have been most commonly divided by whether the malignancy is mainly located in the blood (leukemia) or in lymph nodes (lymphomas).

==Treatment==
Treatment can occasionally consist of &quot;watchful waiting&quot; (e.g., in CLL) or symptomatic treatment (e.g., blood transfusions in MDS). The more aggressive forms of disease require treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and—in some cases—a bone marrow transplant. The use of rituximab has been established for the treatment of B-cell–derived hematologic malignancies, including follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

In addition to cure-directed treatment, people can benefit from self-care to manage symptoms. For example, aerobic exercise, such as walking, can reduce fatigue and feelings of depression in people with hematological malignancies.

===Follow-up===
If treatment has been successful (&quot;complete&quot; or &quot;partial remission&quot;), a person is generally followed up at regular intervals to detect recurrence and monitor for &quot;secondary malignancy&quot; (an uncommon side-effect of some chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens—the appearance of another form of cancer). In the follow-up, which should be done at pre-determined regular intervals, general anamnesis is combined with complete blood count and determination of lactate dehydrogenase or thymidine kinase in serum. Hematological malignancies as well as their treatments are associated with complications affecting many organs, with the lungs being frequently affected.

==Etiology==

Chromosomal translocations are a major etiologic factor in hematologic malignancies. Such translocations usually arise in cells as the result of aberrant DNA double-strand break repair by an imprecise processes such as non-homologous end joining. Chromosome instability in chronic myeloid leukemia may be due to oxidative damage to DNA along with impairments of genetic surveillance leading to imprecise error prone DNA repair.

==Epidemiology==
Taken together, haematological malignancies account for 9.5% of new cancer diagnoses in the United States and 30,000 patients in the UK are diagnosed each year. Within this category, lymphomas are more common than leukemias.

<text>Real-time application interface (RTAI) is a real-time extension for the Linux kernel, which lets users write applications with strict timing constraints for Linux. Like Linux itself the RTAI software is a community effort. RTAI provides deterministic response to interrupts, POSIX-compliant and native RTAI real-time tasks. RTAI supports several architectures, including IA-32 (with and without FPU and TSC), x86-64, PowerPC, ARM (StrongARM and ARM7: clps711x-family, Cirrus Logic EP7xxx, CS89712, PXA25x), and MIPS.

RTAI consists mainly of two parts: an Adeos-based patch to the Linux kernel which introduces a hardware abstraction layer, and a broad variety of services which make lives of real-time programmers easier. RTAI versions over 3.0 use an Adeos kernel patch, slightly modified in the x86 architecture case, providing additional abstraction and much lessened dependencies on the &quot;patched&quot; operating system. Adeos is a kernel patch comprising an Interrupt Pipeline where different operating system domains register interrupt handlers. This way, RTAI can transparently take over interrupts while leaving the processing of all others to Linux. Use of Adeos also frees RTAI from patent restrictions caused by RTLinux project.

==RTAI-XML==
RTAI-XML is a server component of RTAI, implementing a service-oriented way to design and develop real-time (RT) control applications.

This project was born to fulfill the needs of a university group, mainly focused to have a flexible platform for learning control systems design, allowing the students to test their programs remotely, over the Internet. Leaving the first wishful thinking and going to the real implementation gave rise to the alpha version of RTAI-XML, that showed the potential impact of the basic idea of a net separation of &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; real-time tasks in the programmation logic. What was necessary to assure that students could not crash the RT process, is now becoming a new RTAI paradigm.

RTAI-XML consists of a server component waiting for incoming calls on a box where a real-time process, the Target, is running (or ready to). A generic client program, the Host, can reach the server through the TCP/IP network, using a standard protocol based on XML, and hence interact with the Target, in order to monitor the status of the RT process, to see the signals collected (or generated) by the system and also to fetch and change the RT parameters (for example, the gains of a PID feedback ring). In other words, RTAI-XML provides a simple way towards remoting of control applications, adding flexibility to the RTAI project, without losing the key features of an open and standard implementation.

The RTAI-XML section of this site presents the details of the implementation. The general architecture is revised, in order to focus the three key components, the Server, the &quot;Server-Target&quot; interface and the &quot;Server-Host&quot; communication. The Applications section contains some examples of control systems based on RTAI-XML and the References section contains hints and links for further readings on this topic.

<text>Adeos (Adaptive Domain Environment for Operating Systems) is a nanokernel hardware abstraction layer (HAL), or hypervisor, that operates between computer hardware and the operating system (OS) that runs on it. It is distinct from other nanokernels in that it is not only a low level layer for an outer kernel. Instead, it is intended to run several kernels together, which makes it similar to full virtualization technologies. It is free and open-source software released under a GNU General Public License (GPL).

Adeos provides a flexible environment for sharing hardware resources among multiple operating systems, or among multiple instances of one OS, thereby enabling multiple prioritized domains to exist simultaneously on the same hardware.

Adeos has been successfully inserted beneath the Linux kernel, opening a range of possibilities, such as symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) clustering, more efficient virtualization, patchless kernel debugging, and real-time computing (RT) systems for Linux.

Unusually among HALs, Adeos can be loaded as a Linux loadable kernel module to allow another OS to run along with it. Adeos was developed in the context of real-time application interface (RTAI) to modularize it and separate the HAL from the real-time kernel.

==Prior work==
Two categories of methods exist to enable multiple operating systems to run on the same system. The first is simulation-based and provides a virtual environment for which to run additional operating systems. The second suggests the use of a nanokernel layer to enable hardware sharing.

In the simulation category, there are tools such as Xen, VMware, Virtual PC and SimOS. There is also Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) which is more similar to Adeos , but is not RT and requires specific virtualization hardware support. These methods are used for users who desire to run applications foreign to their base OS, they provide no control over the base OS to the user. Simulation was never meant to be used in a production environment. In the nanokernel category there are tools such as SPACE, cache kernel and Exokernel. All of these suggest building miniature hardware management facilities which can thereafter be used to build production operating systems . The problem of this approach is that it does not address the issue of extant operating systems and their user base.

Adeos addresses the requirements of both categories of application by providing a simple layer that is inserted under an unmodified running OS and thereafter provides the required primitives and mechanisms to allow multiple OSes to share the same hardware environment. Adeos does not attempt to impose any restrictions on the hardware’s use, by the different OSes, more than is necessary for Adeos’ own operation. Instead, such restriction is to be imposed by the system administrator or the system programmer. This exposes the system to mismanagement, but the idea behind Adeos is to give back control to system administrators and programmers.

==Architecture==

Adeos implements a queue of signals. Each time that a peripheral sends a signal, the different operating systems that are running in the machine are awakened, in turn, and must decide if they will accept (handle), ignore, discard, or terminate the signal. Signals not handled (or discarded) by an OS are passed to the next OS in the chain. Signals that are terminated are not propagated to latter stages.

As Adeos has to ensure equal and trusted access to the hardware, it takes control of some hardware commands issued by the different OSes; but, it also must not intrude too much on the different OSes’ normal behavior. Each OS is encompassed in a domain over which it has total control. This domain may include a private address space and software abstractions such as process, virtual memory, file-systems, etc. Adeos does not attempt to impose any policy of use of the hardware except as needed for its operation. The task of determining policy is left to the system architect.

===Adeos interrupt pipe===

Adeos uses an interrupt pipe to propagate interrupts through the different domains running on the hardware. As some domains may prefer to be the first to receive hardware interrupts, Adeos provides a mechanism for domains to have access to priority interrupt dispatching. In effect, Adeos places the requesting domain&#x27;s interrupt handler and accompanying tables, which may be called as an interrupt mechanism in SPACE terminology, at the first stages of the interrupt pipeline. Domains can control whether they accept, ignore, discard or terminate interrupts. Each of these has a different effect and is controlled differently.

Accepting interrupts is the normal state of a domain&#x27;s interrupt mechanism. When Adeos encounters a domain that is accepting interrupts it summons its interrupt handler after having set the required CPU environment and stack content for the interrupt handler to operate correctly. The OS then may decide to operate any number of operations including task scheduling. Once the OS is done, the pipeline proceeds as planned by propagating interrupts down the pipeline.

When an OS in a domain does not want to be interrupted, for any reason, it asks Adeos to stall the stage its domain occupies in the interrupt pipeline. By doing so, interrupts go no further in the pipeline and are stalled at the stage occupied by the domain. When the OS is done wanting to be uninterrupted, it asks Adeos to install the pipeline and thereafter all the interrupts that were stalled at the corresponding stage follow their route to the other stages of the pipeline.

When a domain is discarding interrupts, the interrupt passes over the stage occupied by the domain and continues onto the other stages. When a domain terminates interrupts then the interrupts that are terminated by it are not propagated to latter stages. Interrupt discarding and termination is only possible when the OS in a domain recognizes Adeos.

Since some OSes do not recognize Adeos, it is possible to create a domain which only serves as a handler for that OS. Hence, in the interrupt pipeline, this stage always precedes the handled domain&#x27;s stage and may take actions for that domain with Adeos in order to provide the handled domain&#x27;s OS with the illusion of normal system operation.

Once Adeos is done traversing the pipeline it checks if all domains are dormant. If that is the case, it then calls on its idle task. This task remains active until the occurrence of the next interrupt. If all the domains aren&#x27;t dormant it restores the processor to the state it had prior the interrupt entering the pipeline and execution continues where it had left. Since Adeos is very much hardware dependent, many details are specific to one of its particular implementations.

==Applicability==

===General-purpose operating system resource sharing===
General-purpose operating system resource sharing is one of the main objectives of Adeos, to provide an environment which enables multiple general purpose OSes to share the same hardware.

===Operating system development===
Developing OSes is usually a complicated process which sometimes requires extra hardware such as in-circuit emulators to probe the hardware on which an OS is running. Using Adeos, OS development is eased since any undesired behavior may be controlled by an appropriate domain handler. It can also provide a default domain handler for OS development under which developers may have controlled direct access to the hardware they are meant to control. As Adeos is itself a kernel-module, such development domain handlers may be developed independently from Adeos.

===Patchless kernel debuggers and probers===
Adeos provides for a way for kernel debuggers and probers to take control of Linux without modifying Linux. As with other Adeos domains, these facilities would load as normal kernel modules and would thereafter request a ring-zero domain from Adeos. Once that is done, they may request priority interrupt dispatching in the interrupt pipeline. Hence, before Linux gets to handle any interrupts, they will be able to intercept those interrupts and carry out the requested debugging tasks. This can also be extended to performance profilers and other such development tools.

<text>Mosaicism or genetic mosaicism is a condition in which a multicellular organism possesses more than one genetic line as the result of genetic mutation. This means that various genetic lines resulted from a single fertilized egg. Mosaicism is one of several possible causes of chimerism, wherein a single organism is composed of cells with more than one distinct genotype.

Genetic mosaicism can result from many different mechanisms including chromosome nondisjunction, anaphase lag, and endoreplication. Anaphase lagging is the most common way by which mosaicism arises in the preimplantation embryo. Mosaicism can also result from a mutation in one cell during development, in which case the mutation will be passed on only to its daughter cells (and will be present only in certain adult cells). Somatic mosaicism is not generally inheritable as it does not generally affect germ cells.

==History==
In 1929, Alfred Sturtevant studied mosaicism in &quot;Drosophila&quot;, a genus of fruit fly. H. J. Muller in 1930 demonstrated that mosaicism in &quot;Drosophila&quot; is always associated with chromosomal rearrangements, and Schultz in 1936 showed that, in all cases studied, these rearrangements were associated with heterochromatic inert regions. Several hypotheses on the nature of such mosaicism were proposed. One hypothesis assumed that mosaicism appears as the result of a break and loss of chromosome segments. Curt Stern in 1935 assumed that the structural changes in the chromosomes took place as a result of &quot;somatic crossing&quot;, as a result of which mutations or small chromosomal rearrangements in somatic cells. Thus the inert region causes an increase in mutation frequency or small chromosomal rearrangements in active segments adjacent to inert regions.

In the 1930s, Stern demonstrated that genetic recombination, normal in meiosis, can also take place in mitosis. When it does, it results in somatic (body) mosaics. These organisms contain two or more genetically distinct types of tissue. The term &quot;somatic mosaicism&quot; was used by CW Cotterman in 1956 in his seminal paper on antigenic variation.

In 1944, M. L. Belgovskii proposed that mosaicism could not account for certain mosaic expressions caused by chromosomal rearrangements involving heterochromatic inert regions. The associated weakening of biochemical activity led to what he called a &quot;genetic chimera&quot;.

==Types==

===Germline mosaicism===

Germline or gonadal mosaicism is a particular form of mosaicism wherein some gametes—i.e., sperm or oocytes—carry a mutation, but the rest are normal. The cause is usually a mutation that occurred in an early stem cell that gave rise to all or part of the gametes.

===Somatic mosaicism===
Somatic mosaicism (also known as clonal mosaicism) occurs when the somatic cells of the body are of more than one genotype. In the more common mosaics, different genotypes arise from a single fertilized egg cell, due to mitotic errors at first or later cleavages.

Somatic mutation leading to mosaicism is prevalent in the beginning and end stages of human life. Somatic mosaics are common in embryogenesis due to retrotransposition of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) and Alu transposable elements. In early development, DNA from undifferentiated cell types may be more susceptible to mobile element invasion due to long, unmethylated regions in the genome. Further, the accumulation of DNA copy errors and damage over a lifetime lead to greater occurrences of mosaic tissues in aging humans. As longevity has increased dramatically over the last century, human genome may not have had time to adapt to cumulative effects of mutagenesis. Thus, cancer research has shown that somatic mutations are increasingly present throughout a lifetime and are responsible for most leukemia, lymphomas, and solid tumors.

====Trisomies, monosomies, and related conditions====
The most common form of mosaicism found through prenatal diagnosis involves trisomies. Although most forms of trisomy are due to problems in meiosis and affect all cells of the organism, some cases occur where the trisomy occurs in only a selection of the cells. This may be caused by a nondisjunction event in an early mitosis, resulting in a loss of a chromosome from some trisomic cells. Generally, this leads to a milder phenotype than in nonmosaic patients with the same disorder.

In rare cases, intersex conditions can be caused by mosaicism where some cells in the body have XX and others XY chromosomes (46, XX/XY). In the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, where a fly possessing two X chromosomes is a female and a fly possessing a single X chromosome is a sterile male, a loss of an X chromosome early in embryonic development can result in sexual mosaics, or gynandromorphs. Likewise, a loss of the Y chromosome can result in XY/X mosaic males.

An example of this is one of the milder forms of Klinefelter syndrome, called 46,XY/47,XXY mosaic wherein some of the patient&#x27;s cells contain XY chromosomes, and some contain XXY chromosomes. The 46/47 annotation indicates that the XY cells have the normal number of 46 total chromosomes, and the XXY cells have a total of 47 chromosomes.

Also monosomies can present with some form of mosaicism. The only non-lethal full monosomy occurring in humans is the one causing Turner&#x27;s syndrome. Around 30% of Turner&#x27;s syndrome cases demonstrate mosaicism, while complete monosomy (45, X) occurs in about 50–60% of cases.

Mosaicism isn&#x27;t necessarily deleterious, though. Revertant somatic mosaicism is a rare recombination event with a spontaneous correction of a mutant, pathogenic allele. In revertant mosaicism, the healthy tissue formed by mitotic recombination can outcompete the original, surrounding mutant cells in tissues such as blood and epithelia that regenerate often. In the skin disorder ichthyosis with confetti, normal skin spots appear early in life and increase in number and size over time.

Other endogenous factors can also lead to mosaicism, including mobile elements, DNA polymerase slippage, and unbalanced chromosome segregation. Exogenous factors include nicotine and UV radiation. Somatic mosaics have been created in &quot;Drosophila&quot; using X‑ray treatment and the use of irradiation to induce somatic mutation has been a useful technique in the study of genetics.

True mosaicism should not be mistaken for the phenomenon of X-inactivation, where all cells in an organism have the same genotype, but a different copy of the X chromosome is expressed in different cells. The latter is the case in normal (XX) female mammals, although it is not always visible from the phenotype (as it is in calico cats). However, all multicellular organisms are likely to be somatic mosaics to some extent.

====Gonosomal mosaicism====
Gonosomal mosaicism is a type of somatic mosaicism that occurs very early in the organisms development and thus is present within both germline and somatic cells. Somatic mosaicism is not generally inheritable as it does not usually affect germ cells. In the instance of gonosomal mosaicism, organisms have the potential to pass the genetic alteration, including to potential offspring because the altered allele is present in both somatic and germline cells.

====Brain cell mosaicism====

A frequent type of neuronal genomic mosaicism is copy number variation. Possible sources of such variation were suggested to be incorrect repairs of DNA damage and somatic recombination.

====Mitotic recombination====
One basic mechanism that can produce mosaic tissue is mitotic recombination or somatic crossover. It was first discovered by Curt Stern in &quot;Drosophila&quot; in 1936. The amount of tissue that is mosaic depends on where in the tree of cell division the exchange takes place. A phenotypic character called &quot;twin spot&quot; seen in &quot;Drosophila&quot; is a result of mitotic recombination. However, it also depends on the allelic status of the genes undergoing recombination. Twin spot occurs only if the heterozygous genes are linked in repulsion, i.e. the trans phase. The recombination needs to occur between the centromeres of the adjacent gene. This gives an appearance of yellow patches on the wild-type background in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. another example of mitotic recombination is the Bloom&#x27;s syndrome, which happens due to the mutation in the &quot;blm&quot; gene. The resulting BLM protein is defective. The defect in RecQ, a helicase, facilitates the defective unwinding of DNA during replication, thus is associated with the occurrence of this disease.

==Use in experimental biology==
Genetic mosaics are a particularly powerful tool when used in the commonly studied fruit fly, where specially selected strains frequently lose an X or a Y chromosome in one of the first embryonic cell divisions. These mosaics can then be used to analyze such things as courtship behavior, and female sexual attraction.

More recently, the use of a transgene incorporated into the &quot;Drosophila&quot; genome has made the system far more flexible. The flip recombinase (or &quot;FLP&quot;) is a gene from the commonly studied yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; that recognizes &quot;flip recombinase target&quot; (FRT) sites, which are short sequences of DNA, and induces recombination between them. FRT sites have been inserted transgenically near the centromere of each chromosome arm of &quot;D. melanogaster&quot;. The &quot;FLP&quot; gene can then be induced selectively, commonly using either the heat shock promoter or the GAL4/UAS system. The resulting clones can be identified either negatively or positively.

In negatively marked clones, the fly is transheterozygous for a gene encoding a visible marker (commonly the green fluorescent protein) and an allele of a gene to be studied (both on chromosomes bearing FRT sites). After induction of &quot;FLP&quot; expression, cells that undergo recombination will have progeny homozygous for either the marker or the allele being studied. Therefore, the cells that do not carry the marker (which are dark) can be identified as carrying a mutation.

Using negatively marked clones is sometimes inconvenient, especially when generating very small patches of cells, where seeing a dark spot on a bright background is more difficult than a bright spot on a dark background. Creating positively marked clones is possible using the so-called MARCM (&quot;mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker&quot; system, developed by Liqun Luo, a professor at Stanford University, and his postdoctoral student Tzumin Lee, who now leads a group at Janelia Farm Research Campus. This system builds on the GAL4/UAS system, which is used to express GFP in specific cells. However, a globally expressed &quot;GAL80&quot; gene is used to repress the action of GAL4, preventing the expression of GFP. Instead of using GFP to mark the wild-type chromosome as above, GAL80 serves this purpose, so that when it is removed by mitotic recombination, GAL4 is allowed to function, and GFP turns on. This results in the cells of interest being marked brightly in a dark background.

<text>Sogndal Fotball is the football department of Norwegian sports club Sogndal IL from Sogndal in Vestland. The club was founded in 1926. The men&#x27;s team currently plays in second tier 1. divisjon of the Norwegian football league system. The club&#x27;s home matches are played at the 5,622 capacity Fosshaugane Campus.

The men&#x27;s team contests for the Norwegian Cup. They achieved for the first time play in the 1976 Norwegian Cup final phase. They were unsuccessful in the pursuit of the 1976 Norwegian Cup as runner-up in the 1976 Norwegian Cup, losing to SK Brann 2-1. Sogndal became the first third-tier side to play in a Norwegian Cup final. Sogndal men&#x27;s team contests in the top division Eliteserien. They contested in the 2017 season.

==History==

Sogndal IL was founded 19 February 1926. They contested their first top division season in 1982, and ended the season in 11th position; relegation returned them to the second tier.The club&#x27;s breakthrough in Norwegian football came in 1976, when they as a third-tier side they for their first time reached the final of the 1976 Norwegian Cup. Sogndal lost that final to Brann at Ullevaal Stadion 2–1; Knut Christiansen scored Sogndal&#x27;s only goal.

Sogndal&#x27;s second season in the first tier 1988 Norwegian First Division, they finished in sixth place, their then best finishing position. The club was relegated to the second tier in the 1989 season. Sogndal won group A in the 1990 2. divisjon and won promotion. During the 1990s, Sogndal played five seasons in the first tier. In 1999, Sogndal received a transfer fee reported to be around NOK 40 million when Eirik Bakke was sold to Leeds United. From 2001 to 2004, Sogndal played four consecutive seasons in the top division, an achievement they repeated in the seasons 2011–14. The men&#x27;s team were promoted to the 2011 Tippeligaen after winning the 2010 1. divisjon. Sogndal won the 2015 Norwegian First Division, their sixth successive second tier title. They share this distinction with HamKam and Lyn, the only other clubs with six Norwegian second tier titles.

In 2017, Sogndal received relegated an eighth time from Eliteserien, after losing the relegation play-offs on a penalty shoot-out against Ranheim.

==Stadium==
The club&#x27;s stadium is Fosshaugane Campus. The stadium was renovated and reopened in 2006 and the name &quot;Campus&quot; was added because the local Sogn og Fjordane University College and high school is located in the stadium. The capacity is 5,622.

The attendance record of 7,025 spectators dates from the 1976 Norwegian Cup quarter-final against Start.

<doc id="604026" wikidata="Q1354895" url="?curid=604026" title="Bowing">
<text>Bowing (also called stooping) is the act of lowering the torso and head as a social gesture in direction to another person or symbol. It is most prominent in Asian cultures but it is also typical of nobility and aristocracy in many European countries. It is also used in religious contexts, as a form of worship or veneration. Sometimes the gesture may be limited to lowering the head such as in Indonesia, and in many cultures several degrees of the lowness of the bow are distinguished and regarded as appropriate for different circumstances. It is especially prominent in Nepal, India, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, China, Korea, and Japan, where it may be executed standing or kneeling. Some bows are performed equally by two or more people while others are unequal – the person bowed to either does not bow in return or performs a less low bow in response. A nod of the head may be regarded as the minimal form of bow; forms of kneeling, genuflection, or prostration which involves the hands or whole body touching the ground, are the next levels of gesture.

==In Europe and the Commonwealth==

Bowing is a traditional gesture of respect and gratitude in European cultures. Since the 17th century, bowing has been a primarily male practice. Women instead perform a curtsy, a related gesture that diverged from the bow during the early modern period. However, women may still bow in some religious practices or during stage performances, such as at the curtain call.

The depth of the bow was related to the difference in rank or degree of respect or gratitude. In early modern courtly circles, males were expected to &quot;bow and scrape&quot; (hence the term &quot;bowing and scraping&quot; for what appears to be excessive ceremony). &quot;Scraping&quot; refers to the drawing back of the right leg as one bows, such that the right foot scrapes the floor or earth. Typically, while executing such a bow, the man&#x27;s right hand is pressed horizontally across the abdomen while the left is held out from the body. Today, social bowing is all but extinct, except in some very formal settings. However, hand-kissing of women by men, which entails bowing to reach the hand, continues in some cultures.

In the British, Australian, and other Commonwealth courts, lawyers and clerks (of both sexes) are expected to perform a cursory bow of the head only to the judge when entering or leaving a law court that is in session. Similar gestures are made to the Speaker of the House of Commons when entering or leaving the chamber of the House of Commons in session, and to the monarch by their staff.

Members of the Royal Family of the various Commonwealth Realms are either bowed or curtsied to, depending on the gender of the subject. Australians are expected to bow to the Governor-General of Australia, the spouse of the Governor-General and state Governors and Lieutenant-Governors.

==In Asia==

===In East Asia===

Bows are the traditional greeting in East Asia, particularly in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, China and Vietnam. In China and Vietnam, shaking hands or a slight bow have become more popular than a full bow. However, bowing is not reserved only for greetings; it can also be used as a gesture of respect, with different bows used for apologies and gratitude.

====In China====
The kowtow is the highest sign of reverence in Han Chinese culture, but its use has become extremely rare since the collapse of Imperial China. In many situations, the standing bow has replaced the kowtow. However, in modern Chinese societies, bowing is not as formalized as in Japan, South Korea and North Korea. Bowing is normally reserved for occasions such as marriage ceremonies and as a gesture of respect for the deceased, although it still sometimes used for more formal greetings.
In China, three bows are customarily executed at funerals including state funerals,
ancestral worship, and at special ceremonies in commemoration of &quot;pater patriae&quot; Sun Yat-sen.

As in Japan and Korea, public figures may bow formally to apologize. Chinese Premier bowed and offered his condolences to stranded railway passengers; Taiwanese Defense Minister bowed in apology following a faux pas concerning the shooting of former President in 2004.

===In South and Southeast Asia===
Similarly to East Asia, bowing is the traditional form of greeting in many South Asian and Southeast Asian countries. A gesture known as the &quot;Añjali Mudrā&quot; is used as a sign of respect and greeting and involves a bow of varying degrees depending on whom one performs it to and hands pressed together generally at chest level. Practised throughout South Asia and Southeast Asia, the gesture is most commonly used in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and Indonesia. Gestures across the region are known by different names such as the &quot;sampeah&quot; in Cambodia, &quot;wai&quot; in Thailand, &quot;sembah&quot; in Indonesia, &quot;namaste&quot; in India and Nepal, and in Sri Lanka the gesture is used as a greeting with the word &quot;Ayubowan&quot;

==In religious settings==

===Eastern religions===
In many Eastern religions bowing is used as a sign of respect in worship and has its origins in the Indian &quot;Añjali Mudrā&quot;.

====Sikhism====
Sikhs only bowed to their Gurus, who were the messengers of God. Their holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib is seen as the eternal guru after the death of their living gurus, as it has the word of god written by the past living gurus. In a Gurdwara, Sikhs bow to the Guru Granth Sahib and are not permitted to take part in idol worshiping, bowing to anything other than the Guru Granth Sahib or bowing to any living person.

====Shinto====

Bows are performed in Shinto settings. Visitors to a Shinto shrine will clap or ring a bell to attract the attention of the enshrined deity, clasp the hands in prayer, and then bow.

====Buddhism====
Bowing is a common feature for worship in Buddhism. Zen Buddhism, for example, has a daily ritual in which practitioners do 1,080 full prostration bows, usually spread throughout the day. More casual practitioners and laypeople typically do 108 bows once a day instead.

====Hinduism====

In the Hindu traditions people show deference by bowing or kneeling down and touching feet of an elder or respected person.
Traditionally, a child is expected to bow down to their parents, teachers and elders during certain formal ceremonies and casual settings.

===Abrahamic religions===
====Judaism====
In the Jewish setting, bowing, similar to in Christianity, is a sign of respect, and is done at certain points in Jewish services. By tradition, in the Temple in Jerusalem, kneeling was part of the regular service, but this is not part of a modern Jewish service.

Some bows within the current liturgy are simple bows from the waist — others (especially during parts of the Amidah) involve bending the knees while saying Baruch (Blessed), bowing from the waist at Atah ([are] you) and then straightening up at Adonai (God). During the concluding &quot;Aleinu&quot; section of the services, congregants usually bow when they say &quot;V&#x27;anachnu kor&#x27;im u&#x27;mishtachavim u&#x27;modim,&quot; meaning &quot;we bend our knees, prostrate, and acknowledge our thanks.&quot; Another moment in the service which triggers the bow is during the &quot;Bar&#x27;chu&quot;. Many bow at the mention of &quot;Adonai&quot; (the Jewish addressing of the Lord) at this and various other parts in the service (most likely if they are to remain standing during that prayer). 

Kneeling is retained in modern Orthodox Judaism, but only on the High Holy Days — once on each day of Rosh Hashanah (when the Aleinu prayer is recited during the Amidah), and four times on Yom Kippur — again, once for Aleinu, and three times during a central portion of the service when the details of the Avodah, the High Priest&#x27;s service in the Temple are recited.

The Talmudic texts as well as writings of Gaonim and Rishonim indicate that total prostration was common among many Jewish communities until some point during the Middle Ages. Members of the Karaite denomination practice full prostrations during prayers. Ashkenazi Jews prostrate during Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur as did Yemenite Jews during the Tachanun part of regular daily Jewish prayer until somewhat recently. Ethiopian Jews traditionally prostrated during a holiday specific to their community known as Sigd. &quot;Sigd&quot; comes from a root word meaning prostration in Amharic, Aramaic, and Arabic. There is a move among &quot;Talmide haRambam&quot;, a small modern restorationist group with perspectives on Jewish law similar to that of Dor Daim, to revive prostration as a regular part of daily Jewish worship.

====Christianity====
Communicants of many Christian denominations bow at the mention of the name of Jesus, while inside of a church and outside of one. The origin of this practice is within Sacred Scripture, which states: &quot;Therefore God also highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth&quot; (NRSV). This pious custom was mandated in the Second Council of Lyon, which proclaimed &quot;Whenever that glorious name is recalled, especially during the sacred mysteries of the Mass, everyone should bow the knees of his heart which he can do even by a bow of his head.&quot; The eighteenth canon of the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion, made this external obeisance obligatory during the divine service, declaring: &quot;When in time of divine service the Lord JESUS shall be mentioned, due and lowly reverence shall be done by all persons present, as it has been accustomed; testifying by these outward ceremonies and gestures their inward humility, Christian resolution, and due acknowledgement that the Lord JESUS CHRIST, the true eternal Son of God, is the only Saviour of the world, in whom alone all the mercies, graces, and promises of God to mankind for this life, and the life to come, are fully and wholly comprised.&quot; Likewise, in the Lutheran Churches, people are &quot;to bow when the name of Jesus is mentioned&quot;, and in the Roman Catholic Church &quot;at the mention of the name of Jesus, there is a slight bow of the head&quot;. John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Churches, also taught the faithful &quot;to bow at the Name of Jesus&quot; and as a result, it is customary for Methodists to bow at the mention of His name, especially during the recitation of the Creed.

In Christian liturgy, bowing is a sign of respect or deference. In many Christian denominations, individuals will bow when passing in front of the altar, or at certain points in the service (for example, when the name of Jesus Christ is spoken, as mentioned above). It may take the form of a simple bow of the head, or a slight incline of the upper body. A profound bow is a deep bow from the waist, and is often done as a substitution for genuflection.
In Eastern Orthodoxy, there are several degrees of bowing, each with a different meaning. Strict rules exist as to which type of a bow should be used at any particular time. The rules are complicated and are not always carried out in all parishes.

In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, a profound bow, prostration, a slight bow of the head (during the Creed) genuflection, and kneeling are all prescribed in the liturgy at various points. In addition, there are two forms of genuflection, depending on whether or not the Blessed Sacrament is exposed on the altar or not. In addition to bowing at the mention of the name of Jesus, in the Anglican Communion, &quot;A reverence in the form of a bow is made to an altar, because it is as it were God&#x27;s throne, and in a manner represents Him.&quot; As with Anglican churches, in Lutheran and Methodist churches, when approaching the chancel, it is customary to bow towards the altar (or altar cross). In Anglican churches a bow is also made when the processional cross passes by a communicant in a church procession.

Conservative Protestant Christians such as Brethren, Mennonite, and Seventh-day Adventists make a practice of kneeling during community prayer in the church service. Until the mid-1900s this was common practice among many Protestant Christian groups.

According to the New Testament writer Paul, everyone on Earth will someday bow to Jesus Christ. He writes in Philippians 2:9-11, &quot;Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&quot; KJV. He is here quoting a similar passage regarding bowing from the Old Testament, Isaiah 45:23.

====Islam====
In Islam, there are two types of bowing, Sujud and Ruk&#x27;u. Sajdah or Sujud is to prostrate oneself to God in the direction of the Kaaba at Mecca which is done during daily prayers (salat). While in sujud, a Muslim is to praise God and glorify him. The position involves having the forehead, nose, both hands, knees and all toes touching the ground together. Ruku&#x27; is bowing down in the standing position during daily prayers (salat). The position of ruku&#x27; is established by bending over, putting one&#x27;s hands on one&#x27;s knees, and remaining in that position while also praising God and glorifying him.
