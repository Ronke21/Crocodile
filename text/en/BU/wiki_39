<text>Patrick Daniel Tillman Jr. (November6, 1976– April22, 2004) was an American professional football player for the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) who left his sports career and enlisted in the United States Army Special Operations in May 2002 in the aftermath of the September11 attacks. His service in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as his subsequent death, received national attention, especially so when it was discovered he had been killed by friendly fire.

Tillman played college football for the Arizona State Sun Devils, earning first-team All-American honors in 1997. After four seasons in the NFL, Tillman joined the Army Rangers and served several combat tours before he was killed in the mountains of Afghanistan. At first, the army reported that Tillman had been killed by enemy fire. A month later, on May28, 2004, the Pentagon notified the Tillman family that he was actually killed by fire from his own side. The family and other critics allege that the Department of Defense delayed the disclosure until weeks after Tillman&#x27;s memorial service out of a desire to protect the image of the U.S. military. In 2007, the Pentagon released a report ruling Tillman&#x27;s death as accidental.

Tillman was posthumously promoted from specialist to corporal. He also posthumously received the Silver Star and Purple Heart medals.

==Early life and education==
Tillman was born on November 6, 1976, in Fremont, California, the son of Mary (Spalding) and Patrick Kevin Tillman. The oldest of three sons, with Kevin and Richard as the other two, Tillman played competitive football. He went to Bret Harte Middle School and helped lead Leland High School to the Central Coast Division I Football Championship. Tillman did not always play football. In his freshman year of high school, he was catcher for his baseball team, but did not make the varsity team. In his sophomore year he decided to concentrate on football. Tillman then went to Arizona State University on a football scholarship.

Tillman was very close to his family and high school friends. He repeatedly mentioned in his personal journals during wartime service that he drew strength from and deeply valued his closest friendships, parents, wife and family. Tillman was very committed to his high school sweetheart, Marie Ugenti, whom he married shortly before his enlistment in the Army. He also was very close with his brother, Kevin, who enlisted with and served alongside him.

==College career==
He started his college career as a linebacker for Arizona State University in 1994, when he secured the last remaining scholarship for the team. Tillman excelled as a linebacker at Arizona State, despite being relatively small for the position at tall. As a junior, he helped his team go undefeated that season as well as helping them make it to the Rose Bowl that year. In 1997, he was voted the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year. In the same year, Tillman was also named Arizona State&#x27;s MVP.

Tillman majored in marketing and graduated in three and a half years with a 3.85 GPA. He also earned many academic awards including: the Clyde B. Smith Academic Award in 1996 and 1997; the Sporting News Honda Scholar-Athlete of the Year in 1997; and the 1998 Sun Angel Student Athlete of Year. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2010, and was also posthumously inducted into the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Professional career==
===Arizona Cardinals===

In the 1998 NFL draft, Tillman was selected as the 226th pick by the Arizona Cardinals, and given a signing bonus of just $21,000 (). Tillman moved over to play the safety position in the NFL and started ten of 16 games in his rookie season.

At one point in his NFL career, Tillman turned down a five-year, $9 million contract offer from the St. Louis Rams out of loyalty to the Cardinals.

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; football writer Paul Zimmerman named Tillman to his 2000 NFL All-Pro team after Tillman finished with 155 tackles (118 solo), 1.5 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, 2 fumble recoveries, 9 pass deflections, and 1 interception for 30 yards.

Tillman finished his career with totals of 340 tackles, 2.5 sacks, 3 interceptions for 37 yards, 3 forced fumbles, 15 pass deflections, and 3 fumble recoveries in 60 career games. In addition, he also had 1 rush attempt for 4 yards and returned 3 kickoffs for 33 yards.

In May 2002, eight months after the September 11 attacks, and after completing the 15 remaining games of the 2001 season which followed the attacks, Tillman turned down a contract offer of $3.6 million ($ million in ) over three years from the Cardinals to enlist in the U.S. Army.

==Military career and death==
Tillman and his brother Kevin enlisted on May 31, 2002. In September 2002, they completed basic training together. The two brothers completed the Ranger Assessment &amp; Selection Program in late 2002 and were assigned to the 2nd Ranger Battalion in Fort Lewis, Washington. Tillman resided in University Place with his wife before being deployed to Iraq. After participating in the initial invasion of Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, in September 2003, he entered Ranger School at Fort Benning, Georgia; he graduated on November 28, 2003.

Tillman was subsequently deployed to Afghanistan, and posted at FOB Salerno. On April 22, 2004, he was initially reported to have been killed by enemy combatants. An Afghan Militia Force allied soldier, Sayed Farhad, was also killed in the action. Tillman&#x27;s platoon leader, First Lieutenant David Uthlaut, and his radiotelephone operator (RTO), 19-year-old Jade Lane, were wounded in the incident. The Army initially claimed that Tillman and his unit were attacked in an apparent ambush on a road outside of the village of Spera about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Khost, near the Pakistan border. It was not until after his burial that investigations by the Department of Defense and U.S. Congress were launched, eventually ruling his death as having come by friendly fire.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that prior to his death, Tillman called the invasion and occupation of Iraq &quot;fucking illegal&quot;.

An investigation by the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) concluded that Tillman and the Afghan militia soldier were killed by friendly fire when one part of his platoon fired upon the other in confusion, after nearby gunfire was mistakenly believed to be from enemy combatants. The CID Report summary, dated March 19, 2007, stated that: ... during their movement through the canyon road, Serial 2 [Tillman&#x27;s platoon had to split up because of a broken HMMWV; the parts were called Serial 1 and 2] was ambushed and became engaged in a running gun battle with enemy combatants. Serial 1 [Tillman&#x27;s portion of the platoon] had just passed through the same canyon without incident and were approximately one kilometer ahead of Serial 2. Upon hearing explosions, gunfire, and sporadic radio communication from Serial 2, Serial 1 dismounted their vehicles and moved on foot, to a more advantageous position to provide overwatch and fire support for Serial 2&#x27;s movement out of the ambush. Upon exiting the gorge, and despite attempts by Serial 1 to signal a &quot;friendly position&quot;, occupants of the lead vehicle of Serial 2 opened fire on Tillman&#x27;s position, where he was fatally shot.

The Army Special Operations Command initially claimed that there was an exchange with hostile forces. After a lengthy investigation conducted by Brigadier General Gary M. Jones, the U.S. Department of Defense concluded that both the Afghan militia soldier&#x27;s and Tillman&#x27;s deaths were due to friendly fire aggravated by the intensity of the firefight.

Tillman&#x27;s mother testified before Congress, stating &quot;The deception surrounding this case was an insult to the family, but more importantly, its primary purpose was to deceive a whole nation.&quot;

==Awards and decorations==
===Silver Star Citation===

Citation:
The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918 (amended by an act of July 25, 1963), takes pride in presenting the Silver Star (Posthumously) to Corporal Patrick D. Tillman, United States Army, for gallantry in action while serving with the 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, during action in Afghanistan on 22 April 2004, against an armed enemy while serving as a Rifle Team Leader in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. Caught between the crossfire of an enemy near ambush, Corporal Tillman put himself in the line of devastating enemy fire as he maneuvered his fire team to a covered position from which they could effectively employ their weapons on known enemy positions. His audacious leadership and courageous example under fire inspired his men to fight at great risk to their own personal safety, resulting in the enemy&#x27;s withdrawal, his platoon&#x27;s safe passage from the ambush kill zone, and his mortal wound. Corporal Tillman&#x27;s personal courage, tactical expertise, and professional competence directly contributed to his platoon&#x27;s overall success and survival. In making the ultimate sacrifice for his team and platoon, Corporal Patrick D. Tillman reflected great credit upon himself, the Joint Task Force, and the United States Army.

===Awards===


In addition to his military awards, Tillman received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award from ESPN in 2003, as part of that year&#x27;s ESPY Awards ceremony.

==Aftermath and legacy==
===Questions surrounding Tillman&#x27;s death===
A report described in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on May 4, 2005, prepared at the request of Tillman&#x27;s family by Brigadier General Gary M. Jones, revealed that in the days immediately following Tillman&#x27;s death, Army investigators were aware that Tillman had been killed by friendly fire, shot three times in the head at less than 10 yards away, according to Army doctors. Jones reported that senior Army commanders, including General John Abizaid, knew of this fact within days of the shooting, but nevertheless approved the awarding of the Silver Star, Purple Heart, and a posthumous promotion to the rank of Corporal.

Lieutenant General Stanley McChrystal approved the Silver Star citation on April 28, 2004, which gave a detailed account of Tillman&#x27;s death including the phrase &quot;in the line of devastating enemy fire,&quot; but the next day he sent a P4 confidential memo warning senior government members that Tillman might actually have been killed by friendly fire. Senior commanders within the U.S. Central Command, including former Commander of the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) General John Abizaid, were notified by the P4 memo, which described Tillman&#x27;s &quot;highly possible&quot; fratricide, four days before Tillman&#x27;s nationally televised memorial service during which he was lauded as a war hero for dying while engaging the enemy.

Jones reported that members of Tillman&#x27;s unit burned his body armor and uniform in an apparent attempt to hide the fact that he was killed by friendly fire. His notebook, in which, according to author Jon Krakauer, Tillman had recorded some of his thoughts on Afghanistan, was also burned; &quot;a blatant violation of protocol.&quot; Several soldiers were punished for their actions by being removed from the United States Army Rangers. Jones believed that Tillman should retain his medals and promotion, since, according to Jones, he intended to engage the enemy and behaved heroically.

Tillman&#x27;s family was not informed of the finding that he was killed by friendly fire until weeks after his memorial service, although at least some senior Army officers knew of that fact prior to the service. According to Krakauer in his book &quot;Where Men Win Glory&quot;, the extensive coverup that followed Tillman&#x27;s death included the military&#x27;s order to Tillman&#x27;s comrades to lie to his family at the funeral. Tillman&#x27;s parents have sharply criticized the Army&#x27;s handling of the incident; Tillman&#x27;s mother believed that &quot;this lie was to cover their image,&quot; while Tillman&#x27;s father believed that the Army &quot;purposely interfered in the investigation&quot; because of the effect it could have on their recruiting efforts.

He also blamed high-ranking Army officers for presenting &quot;outright lies&quot; to Tillman&#x27;s family and to the public.

On March 4, 2006, the U.S. Defense Department Inspector General directed the Army to open a criminal investigation of Tillman&#x27;s death. The Army&#x27;s Criminal Investigative Division was to determine whether Tillman&#x27;s death was the result of negligent homicide.

On March 26, 2007, the Pentagon released their report on the events surrounding Tillman&#x27;s death and coverup. The report reads in part:

Tillman&#x27;s brother Kevin testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that: The deception surrounding this Tillman case was an insult to the family: but more importantly, its primary purpose was to deceive a whole nation. We say these things with disappointment and sadness for our country. Once again, we have been used as props in a Pentagon public relations exercise.

After Kevin&#x27;s testimony, Pete Geren, acting secretary of the Army, stated to reporters, &quot;We as an Army failed in our duty to the Tillman family, the duty we owe to all the families of our fallen soldiers: give them the truth, the best we know it, as fast as we can.&quot;

Tillman&#x27;s notebook/diary was never returned to his family, and its whereabouts are not publicly known.

One investigation of the autopsy report and photographs by two forensic pathologists in November 2006 concluded that Tillman was most likely killed as a result of fire from a M249 light machine gun. The M249 uses the same ammunition as the M16 rifle and M4 carbine, but is capable of higher rates of fire. This would allow a competent user to place three bullets within a several-inch target from 40 or 50 yards away, even from a moving vehicle.

On July 26, 2007, Chris Matthews reported on &quot;Hardball&quot; that Tillman&#x27;s death may have been a case of deliberate murder by Tillman&#x27;s fellow soldiers – specifically that the bullet holes were tight and neat, suggesting a shot at close range. Matthews based his speculation on a report from the doctors who examined Tillman&#x27;s body. The following day the Associated Press reported that a doctor who examined Tillman&#x27;s body after his death wrote, &quot;The medical evidence did not match up with the scenario as described&quot;, also noting that the wound entrances appeared as though he had been shot with an M16 rifle from fewer than away. A possible motive was not identified. When officers and soldiers were asked during a criminal investigation, they said they were certain the shooting was accidental. According to one of his fellow soldiers, Tillman &quot;was popular among his fellow soldiers and had no enemies.&quot;

In addition, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Associated Press, the Defense Department released 2,300 pages of documents which were reported to indicate:
* There has never been evidence of enemy fire found on the scene, and no members of Tillman&#x27;s group had been hit by enemy fire.
* The three-star general who withheld details of Tillman&#x27;s death from his parents for a number of months told investigators approximately 70 times that he had a bad memory and could not recall details of his actions.
* Army attorneys sent each other congratulatory e-mails for keeping criminal investigators at bay as the Army conducted an internal friendly-fire investigation that resulted in administrative, or non-criminal, punishments.
* Army doctors told the investigators that Tillman&#x27;s wounds suggested murder because &quot;the medical evidence did not match-up with the scenario as described.&quot;

===Congressional inquiries===
On April 24, 2007, Specialist Bryan O&#x27;Neal, the last soldier known to see Pat Tillman alive, testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that he was warned by superiors not to divulge information that a fellow soldier killed Tillman, especially to the Tillman family. Later, Pat Tillman&#x27;s brother Kevin Tillman, who was also in the convoy traveling behind his brother at the time of the 2004 incident in Afghanistan but did not witness it, testified that the military tried to spin his brother&#x27;s death to deflect attention from emerging failings in the Afghan war.

On July 13, 2007, Henry Waxman and Tom Davis, the leading members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, revealed that the Bush administration and the Pentagon had withheld key documents relating to Tillman&#x27;s death and denied any new document release request from Congress citing executive privilege.

On August 13, 2007, the Associated Press reported that on behalf of VoteVets, 20 U.S. military veterans who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan asked the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, to help secure the release of all documents relating to the death of Pat Tillman.

On July 14, 2008, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released a proposed report titled &quot;Misleading Information from the Battlefield: The Tillman and Lynch Episodes&quot;. The committee stated that its &quot;investigation was frustrated by a near universal lack of recall&quot; among &quot;senior officials at the White House&quot; and the military. It concluded: The pervasive lack of recollection and absence of specific information makes it impossible for the Committee to assign responsibility for the misinformation in Specialist Tillman&#x27;s and Private Lynch&#x27;s cases. It is clear, however, that the Defense Department did not meet its most basic obligations in sharing accurate information with the families and with the American public.

===Memorials and tributes===
After his death, family and friends of Tillman including his widow Marie Tillman established the Pat Tillman Foundation to carry forward Tillman&#x27;s legacy by inspiring and supporting those striving for positive change in themselves and the world. Marie would serve as executive director and then chair of the board.

A highway bypass around the Hoover Dam has a bridge bearing Tillman&#x27;s name. Completed in October 2010, the Mike O&#x27;Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge spans the Colorado River between Nevada and Arizona.

Lincoln Law School of San Jose has established the Pat Tillman Scholarship in honor of Tillman. Tillman&#x27;s father earned his Juris Doctor from Lincoln in 1983.

On Sunday, September 19, 2004, all teams of the NFL wore a memorial decal on their helmets in honor of Tillman. The Arizona Cardinals continued to wear this decal throughout the 2004 season. Former Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer requested to also wear the decal for the entire season, but the NFL turned him down, saying his helmet would not be uniform with the rest of the Denver Broncos. Plummer later grew a full beard and his hair long in honor of Tillman, who had such a style in the NFL before cutting his hair and shaving his beard off to fit military uniform guidelines.

The Cardinals retired his number 40, and Arizona State did the same for the number 42 he wore with the Sun Devils. The Cardinals have named the plaza surrounding their State Farm Stadium in Glendale Pat Tillman Freedom Plaza. Later, on November 12, 2006, during a Cardinals game versus the Cowboys, a bronze statue was revealed in his honor. ASU also named the football locker room entryway to Sun Devil Stadium the &quot;Pat Tillman Memorial Tunnel&quot; and made a &quot;PT-42&quot; patch that they place on the neck of their uniforms as a permanent feature. In 2011, Pat Tillman Veteran&#x27;s Center in the lower level of the Memorial Union opened on the Tempe campus. Before the 2013 season, the Tillman Tunnel was renovated with new graphics and signage. Double doors separate the locker room from the tunnel, and a television with a sound system displays Tillman&#x27;s career highlights. The gate which opens to the field features an image of Pat Tillman facing the field, looking as if he is leading the team out.

On Saturday, April 15, 2005, 5,000 participants turned out for the inaugural Pat&#x27;s Run (which has become the annual fundraising event for the Pat Tillman Foundation) in Tempe. The racers traveled along the course around Tempe Town Lake to the finish line, on the 42-yard line of Sun Devil Stadium in order to commemorate the number which Tillman wore as a Sun Devil and which was later retired in his honor. A second race took place in San Jose. Sponsored by the Pat Tillman Foundation, Pat&#x27;s Run has continued to grow every year, with more than 28,000 attendees in April 2019. Various &quot;honor runs&quot;, in locations such as Austin, Texas, take place around the country at the same time as Pat&#x27;s Run and are supported by Arizona State University&#x27;s Alumni Association.

In 2004, the NFL donated $250,000 to the United Service Organizations to build a USO center in memory of Tillman. The Pat Tillman USO Center, the first USO center in Afghanistan, opened on Bagram Air Base on April 1, 2005. As of 2019, the NFL continues to support the Pat Tillman Foundation through its Salute to Service campaign honoring United States military service members along with other military and veteran nonprofits.

The song &quot;World Wide Suicide&quot; by Pearl Jam, released March 14th, 2006, was written largely about Tillman.

The Pacific-10 Conference renamed its annual defensive player-of-the-year award in football to the Pat Tillman Defensive Player of the Year.

Forward Operating Base Tillman was close to the Pakistan border, near the village of Lwara in Paktika Province, Afghanistan.

Tillman&#x27;s high school, Leland High School in San Jose, renamed its football field after him. In New Almaden, an unincorporated community adjacent to San Jose, where Tillman grew up, a memorial was constructed near the Almaden Quicksilver County Park. This memorial was dedicated in September 2007 during the annual New Almaden Day celebration. In Phoenix, the Balsz School District named a middle school in 2018 after Tillman.

The skateboarding bulldog featured on YouTube and in an Apple iPhone commercial was named after Tillman.

Two books about Tillman were published in 2009. Jon Krakauer, author of &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; and &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, chronicles Tillman&#x27;s story in &quot;Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman&quot;, published by Doubleday on September 15. Meanwhile, Tillman&#x27;s mother, Mary Tillman, also wrote a book about her son, &quot;Boots on the Ground by Dusk&quot;, which was released in April 2008.

Following Tillman&#x27;s death, Ohio State Linebackers consisting of A. J. Hawk, Bobby Carpenter, and Anthony Schlegel, as well as center Nick Mangold, grew their hair in tribute, imitating Tillman&#x27;s trademark locks.

In September 2008, Rory Fanning, a fellow Army Ranger who was stationed with Tillman in Fort Lewis, Washington, began his &quot;Walk for Pat&quot;, a walk across the United States in an effort to raise money and awareness for the Pat Tillman Foundation. The stated fundraising goal is $3.6 million, the value of the contract Tillman turned down when he decided to enlist in the military.

The Arizona State University Sun Devils football team wore special uniforms made by Adidas to honor Tillman and his career on October 29, 2015, when they faced the Oregon Ducks. All proceeds from the uniforms went to the Pat Tillman Foundation.

Super Bowl LVII, which was played in Arizona where he played collegiately and professionally, was dedicated to Tillman. Four Tillman Foundation Scholars performed the ceremonial coin toss.

===Criticisms===
After reports of Tillman&#x27;s anti-war views became public, Ted Rall, who had previously written a comic calling Tillman a &quot;fool&quot; and &quot;idiot&quot;, said that he was wrong to have assumed Tillman to be a &quot;right wing poster child&quot; when Tillman regarded the invasion of Iraq as illegal.

Then-Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Kauzlarich, Regimental Executive Officer at Forward Operating Base Salerno on Khost, Afghanistan, under which Tillman was serving at the time of his death, and led the second investigation into Tillman&#x27;s death, made statements about the Tillman family&#x27;s search for the truth based on Tillman&#x27;s atheism. In comments to ESPN, Kauzlarich said: &quot;These people have a hard time letting it go. It may be because of their religious beliefs&quot; and &quot;When you die, I mean, there is supposedly a better life, right? Well, if you are an atheist and you don&#x27;t believe in anything, if you die, what is there to go to? Nothing. You are worm dirt. So for their son to die for nothing and now he is no more ... I do not know how an atheist thinks, I can only imagine that would be pretty tough.&quot;

Kauzlarich conducted the second investigation into Tillman&#x27;s death which lasted a week, from May 8 to 15, 2004. Brigadier General Rodney Johnson, the Commanding General of the United States Army Criminal Investigations Command, testified before Congress that he found these statements &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;. Acting Department of Defense Inspector General Thomas Gimble also testified that he was &quot;shocked&quot; that Lieutenant Colonel Kauzlarich would make these statements. According to AP analysis, three lower-level officers are expected to be punished, and Kauzlarich may be one of the three. Tillman&#x27;s mother continues to reject the Pentagon&#x27;s characterization of the officers&#x27; offenses as &quot;errors&quot; in reporting Tillman&#x27;s death, because several officers have said they made conscious decisions not to tell the Tillman family that friendly fire was suspected.

===Media analyses===
Reviews by &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Dexter Filkins of Jon Krakauer&#x27;s book &quot;Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman&quot; noted that the book did well to compile the facts and &quot;nauseating&quot; details regarding the coverup of Tillman&#x27;s death. &quot;After Tillman&#x27;s death, Army commanders violated many of their own rules, not to mention elementary standards of decency, to turn the killing into a propaganda coup for the American side,&quot; Filkins wrote.

A documentary film, &quot;The Tillman Story&quot;, was shown at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2010, and was released in August 2010.

On October 19, 2006, Kevin Tillman broke his silence about his brother&#x27;s death, lashing out at the Iraq War (and American foreign policy in general) in a 660-word essay published on Truthdig, a progressive online journal of news and opinion. The essay was widely distributed and was cited in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Associated Press.

==Personal life==
Tillman was an atheist. According to speakers at his funeral, he was very well-read, having read a number of religious texts including the Bible, Quran, and the Book of Mormon, as well as transcendentalist authors such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. However, responding to religious overtones at the funeral by Maria Shriver and John McCain, his youngest brother, Richard, said, &quot;Just make no mistake, he&#x27;d want me to say this: He&#x27;s not with God, he&#x27;s fucking dead, he&#x27;s not religious.&quot; Richard added, &quot;Thanks for your thoughts, but he&#x27;s fuckin&#x27; dead.&quot; Another article quotes Tillman as having told then-general manager of the Seattle Seahawks, Bob Ferguson, in December 2003, &quot;You know I&#x27;m not religious.&quot;

The September 25, 2005, edition of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; newspaper reported that Tillman held views which were critical of the Iraq War. According to Tillman&#x27;s mother, a friend of Tillman had arranged a meeting for Tillman with author Noam Chomsky, a prominent critic of American foreign and military policy, to take place after his return from Afghanistan.

<text>The Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) is a counter-terrorism system in place in the United States air travel industry that matches passenger information with other data sources. The United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) maintains a watchlist, pursuant to 49 USC § 114 (h)(2), of &quot;individuals known to pose, or suspected of posing, a risk of air piracy or terrorism or a threat to airline or passenger safety.&quot; The list is used to pre-emptively identify terrorists attempting to buy airline tickets or board aircraft traveling in the United States, and to mitigate perceived threats.

== Overview ==
CAPPS systems rely on what is known as a passenger name record (PNR). When a person books a plane ticket, certain identifying information is collected by the airline: full name, date of birth, address, etc. This information is used to check against another data source (including the TSA No-Fly List, the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitive List, and other databases) and assign a terrorism &quot;risk score&quot; to that person. High risk scores require the airline to subject the person to extended baggage and/or personal screening, and to contact law enforcement, if necessary.

== CAPPS I ==
CAPPS I was first implemented in the late 1990s, in response to the perceived threat of U.S. domestic and international terrorism. The U.S. government started to implement counter-terrorism measures after several bomb attacks occurred, including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the 1996 Olympics bombing, and the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa. CAPPS I was administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). CAPPS screening selected passengers for additional screening of their checked baggage for explosives. CAPPS selectees did not undergo any additional screening at passenger security checkpoints.

=== September 11, 2001 attacks ===
On the morning of the September 11 attacks (9/11), several of the hijackers were selected by CAPPS. Wail al-Shehri and Satam al-Suqami were selected for extra screening of their checked bags before they boarded American Airlines Flight 11 at Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts. Waleed al-Shehri was also selected, but since he had checked no bags, the CAPPS selection had no effect on him. Mohamed Atta was selected by CAPPS when he checked in at Portland International Jetport.

All five of the hijackers on American Airlines Flight 77 were CAPPS selectees, with Hani Hanjour, Khalid al-Mihdhar, and Majed Moqed chosen by the CAPPS criteria. Nawaf al-Hazmi and Salem al-Hazmi were selected because they did not provide adequate identification, and had their checked bags held until they boarded the aircraft.

Ahmed al-Haznawi was the only hijacker selected of those on United Airlines Flight 93, and none of the hijackers of United Airlines Flight 175 were selected by CAPPS.

===After 9/11===
In response to the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. government authorized the creation of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee airport security, which was previously handled by private contractors. It was signed into law by President George W. Bush on November 19, 2001. The agency was initially placed under the United States Department of Transportation but was moved to the Department of Homeland Security when that department was formed on March 9, 2003. In November 2001, control of CAPPS was transferred to the TSA, where it has &quot;... expanded almost daily as Intelligence Community (IC) agencies and the Office of Homeland Security continue to request the addition of individuals ...&quot;

In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) presented a proposal for an expanded system (CAPPS II), which was reviewed by Congress and later canceled by the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II was a proposal for a new CAPPS system, designed by the Office of National Risk Assessment (ONRA), a subsidiary office of the TSA, with the contracted assistance of Lockheed Martin. Congress presented the TSA with a list of requirements for a successor to CAPPS I. Some of those requirements were: 

* The government, not the airlines, would control and administer the system
* Every ticketed passenger would be screened, not just those who check bags
* Every airline and every airport would be covered by the system

Like its predecessor, the CAPPS II proposal would rely on the PNR to uniquely identify people attempting to board aircraft. It would expand the PNR field to include a few extra fields, like a full street address, date of birth, and a home telephone number. It would then cross-reference these fields with government records and private sector databases to ascertain the identity of the person, and then determine a number of details about that person. Law enforcement would be contacted in the event that the person was either present on a terrorist or most-wanted list or had outstanding federal or state arrest warrants for a violent crime.

Otherwise, the software would calculate a &quot;risk score&quot; and then print a code on the boarding pass indicating the appropriate &quot;screening level&quot; for that person: green (no threat) indicates no additional screening, yellow (unknown or possible threat) indicates additional screening, and red (high-risk) indicates prevention from boarding and deferral to law enforcement. Exactly how this risk score would be calculated was never disclosed nor subject to public oversight of any kind outside of the TSA.

The CAPPS II system was criticized in a report by the United States General Accounting Office in early 2004, and faced increased opposition from watchdog groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), ReclaimDemocracy.org, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). These advocacy groups expressed concern that the system violated people&#x27;s privacy rights and that it was possibly unconstitutional. They also believed it could actually undermine safety, as terrorists could use it to their advantage.

CAPPS II was cancelled by the TSA in the summer of 2004. Shortly thereafter, the TSA announced a successor program, called Secure Flight, that would work in a way similar to CAPPS II. TSA hoped to test Secure Flight in August 2005 using two airlines, but it was blocked by Congress until the government could prove that the system can pass 10 tests for accuracy and privacy protection as follows:

# Redress process - A system of due process exists whereby aviation passengers determined to pose a threat are either delayed or prohibited from boarding their scheduled flights by TSA may appeal such decisions and correct erroneous information contained in CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow-on/successor programs. 
# Accuracy of databases and effectiveness of Secure Flight - The underlying error rate of the government and private databases that will be used to both establish identity and assign a risk level to a passenger will not produce a large number of false positives that will result in a significant number of passengers being treated mistakenly or security resources being diverted. 
# Stress testing - TSA has stress-tested and demonstrated the efficacy and accuracy of all search technologies in CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow-on/successor programs and has demonstrated that CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow-on/successor programs can make an accurate predictive assessment of those passengers who may constitute a threat to aviation. 
# Internal oversight - The Secretary of Homeland Security has established an internal oversight board to monitor the manner in which CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow-on/successor programs are being developed and prepared. 
# Operational safeguards - TSA has built in sufficient operational safeguards to reduce the opportunities for abuse. 
# Security measures - Substantial security measures are in place to protect CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow-on/successor programs from unauthorized access by hackers or other intruders.

<text>[[Sport]] in [[Lithuania]] is governed by the Physical Education and Sports Department following the country&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. The Lithuanian government established the department to manage physical education in the schools and sports administration in the country. Over the next few years, Lithuanian sports organizations established (or re-established) membership in international governing bodies (including the International Olympic Committee). Lithuania participated in the Winter Olympics in Albertville and has participated in every Winter and Summer Olympics since.

There are nearly 80 Olympic and non-Olympic sports federations in Lithuania, and the Lithuanian Union of Sports Federations was founded in 1993 to unite them. An organization, &quot;Sports for All&quot;, was established to promote physical education and a healthy lifestyle for all Lithuanians.

Among the most popular sports in Lithuania are basketball, football, athletics and cycling. Professional athletes and trainers are educated at the Lithuanian Academy of Physical Education.

==Major sports==

===Basketball===

Basketball is the most popular and successful team sport in Lithuania. Luke Winn, a writer for the American magazine &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, said in an August 2011 story:&quot;Basketball is the only sport the 3.2 million Lithuanians truly care about—it is their second religion, after Catholicism—and their success is proportionately stunning.&quot;

The Lithuanian national basketball team won the European basketball Championship in 1937, 1939 (when it was the host country) and 2003. They won silver medals in 1995, 2013 and 2015, bronze in 2007, and again hosted EuroBasket 2011. They were the bronze medal winners in the 2010 FIBA World Championship, which was one of the biggest underdog stories of the team, beating Spain, France, Argentina and Serbia in the bronze medal match while eventually being only defeated once, in the semifinal against Team USA.

In Olympic competition, Lithuania was the bronze medalist at the 1992, 1996, and 2000 Summer Olympics. The team finished fourth in 2004 (although it defeated Team USA in the group stage, it then lost the bronze medal game against them) and 2008.

Lithuania&#x27;s under-19 junior basketball team won the European Championship in 2003 and took second place at the World Championship that year. The U-17 team has won bronze in 2016 world championship. Its under-21 junior team won the 2005 World Championship in Argentina.

BC Žalgiris, based in Kaunas, is the most successful basketball club in Lithuania. The team won the Intercontinental Cup in 1986, EuroCup in 1998 and the EuroLeague in 1999. In 2018, the club after 19 years has reached the Euroleague Final Four again, reaching the 3rd place. Lietuvos rytas, in Vilnius, won the ULEB Cup (now known as the EuroCup) in 2005 and 2009, and was runner-up in 2007.
In the EuroLeague, Šarūnas Jasikevičius was a four-time EuroLeague winner and Arvydas Macijauskas, Ramūnas Šiškauskas, Arvydas Sabonis were Euroleague MVPs. Several Lithuanian basketball players have played successfully in the NBA:
* Arvydas Sabonis (Portland Trail Blazers, 1995–2001, 2002–03) 
* Šarūnas Marčiulionis (Golden State Warriors and other teams, 1989–1997) 
* Žydrūnas Ilgauskas (Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat) 
* Darius Songaila (Philadelphia 76ers)
* Linas Kleiza (Denver Nuggets and Toronto Raptors)
* Jonas Valančiūnas (New Orleans Pelicans)
* Donatas Motiejūnas (San Antonio Spurs)
* Domantas Sabonis (Sacramento Kings)
* Mindaugas Kuzminskas (Olimpia Milano)

Previously Lithuania ranked fourth in the FIBA World Rankings and putting this in perspective, Luke Winn wrote that Lithuania was at the time&quot;...behind countries of 313 million (the U.S.), 47 million (Spain), 40 million (Argentina) and 11 million (Greece), and just ahead of countries of 79 million (Turkey) and 61 million (Italy).

On 19 December 2022 Kaunas was announced as a host city for the 2023 EuroLeague Final Four, the first in Lithuania&#x27;s sports history.

===Football===
The Lithuanian national Football team reached its highest rating to date (number 37) in October 2008.
From the beginning of the independent Lithuanian state (from 1919 until the Soviet occupation), &quot;sport&quot; was equivalent to &quot;Football&quot;. Football players were the first athletes to participate in international competitions (notably, the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris and 1938 World Cup qualifying matches. During the period of Soviet occupation, Football remained popular because of FK Žalgiris success in the Soviet Union league and European tournaments. After independence, the national team was the closest to qualifying to a major tournament in the 1998 World Cup qualifiers, reaching 3rd place in the group. At the club level, no team has yet reached the group stage of any major UEFA tournament (UCL or EL) although FK Žalgiris, FK Sūduva, FK Ekranas and FBK Kaunas were close to qualifying having reached the Europa League Play-off phase multiple times.

Lithuanian Football players who have been successful in major European Football leagues include:
*Edgaras Jankauskas – Winner of the Champions League in 2004 with FC Porto
*Deividas Šemberas – Winner of the UEFA Cup in 2005 with CSKA
*Marius Stankevičius – Wing back in the Italian Serie A and Liga BBVA
*Tomas Danilevičius – All-time leading scorer on Lithuanian national team; plays for A.S. Livorno Calcio

The A Lyga (&quot;A&quot; League) is the top division in Lithuanian professional football.
As in the rest of Europe, Lithuanians enjoy following the UEFA Champions League, the FIFA World Cup and other world-class Football tournaments.

===Rugby===
Rugby union was introduced in Lithuania during the 1960s, with teams in Kaunas and Vilnius. During last 20 years, the northern city of Šiauliai has become the capital of Lithuanian rugby, with the two strongest teams in Lithuania located there. The Šiauliai Vairas-Jupoja team are national champions, and the Šiauliai BaltRex have been runners-up for the last 10 years (except 2006). The Lithuanian national team competes in European rugby division 2A. World rugby star Laurynas Tipelis also plays for the Lithuanian national team, which holds a world record of 18 consecutive international wins. The streak began in 2006 and ended in 2010, when Lithuania lost its World Cup qualifier to higher-ranked Ukraine.

Lithuania is ranked 39th in the IRB rankings. There are 13 rugby clubs in the country, with more than 1600 players (820 seniors). Rugby sevens is also popular; the Lithuanian rugby sevens national team is a successful participant in the European championships. The Lithuanian women&#x27;s rugby sevens national team is progressing from the lower tiers of the European ranks.

===Athletics===
Lithuanian athletes have won 11 Olympic medals, 7 at the World championships and 14 at the European Championships. The most successful Lithuanian athlete is discus thrower Virglijus Alekna, two-time Olympic gold medalist and two-time world champion. Another Olympic gold-medal discus thrower is Romas Ubartas. In recent years, Lithuanian sprinters have been on the ascendancy. In 2010 two Lithuanian sprinters, Martynas Jurgilas and Rytis Sakalauskas, set new national records for the 100-metre dash. A top woman sprinter, Lina Grinčikaitė, won gold medals at the 2009 Summer Universiade and the 2009 European Athletics U23 Championships. Lithuania also has a tradition of excellence in distance events. The most successful distance runners in recent years have been Aleksandras Antipovas and Živilė Balčiūnaitė. In addition, women heptathletes have medalled at a high level.

Lithuanian cyclists have achieved good results in prestigious cycling tours and the World Championships. The achievements of Lithuanian women cyclists are especially noteworthy.
Lithuanian women made their mark on the international cycling scene beginning in 1991. Among the leaders were Zita Urbonaitė and Diana Čepelienė (who took third place in GC) in the Women&#x27;s Challenge that summer.

Among the best Lithuanian cyclists were twin sisters Jolanta and Rasa Polikevičiūtė (2001 world road race champion), Edita Pučinskaitė (1999 world road race champion) and Diana Žiliūtė (1994 world junior road race champion, 1998 world road race champion and 2000 Olympic road race bronze medalist).
There is a strong junior program in cycling for girls in Lithuania, culminating in an annual international race in Panevėžys. A number of young Lithuanian riders have emerged from this program (particularly Modesta Vžesniauskaitė, one of the top riders in the world).

<text>Thomas Andrews FRS FRSE (19 December 181326 November 1885) was an Irish chemist and physicist who did important work on phase transitions between gases and liquids. He was a longtime professor of chemistry at Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast.

==Life==
Andrews was born in Belfast, Ireland, where his father was a linen merchant. He attended the Belfast Academy and the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, where at the latter of which he studied mathematics under James Thomson. In 1828 he went to the University of Glasgow to study chemistry under Professor Thomas Thomson, then studied at Trinity College, Dublin, where he gained distinction in classics as well as in science. Finally, at University of Edinburgh in 1835, he was awarded a doctorate in medicine.

Andrews began a successful medical practice in his native Belfast in 1835, also giving instruction in chemistry at the Academical Institution. In 1845 he was appointed vice-president of the newly established Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast, and professor of chemistry there. He held these two offices until his retirement in 1879 at age 66. He died in 1885, and was buried in the Borough Cemetery in Belfast.

In 1842, Andrews married Jane Hardie Walker (1818–1899). They had six children, including the geologist Mary Andrews.

==Work==

Andrews first became known as a scientific investigator with his work on the heat developed in chemical actions, for which the Royal Society awarded him a Royal Medal in 1844. Another important investigation, undertaken in collaboration with Peter Guthrie Tait, was devoted to ozone.

His reputation mainly rests on his work with liquefaction of gases. In the 1860s he carried out a very complete inquiry into the gas laws—expressing the relations of pressure, temperature, and volume in carbon dioxide. In particular, he established the concepts of critical temperature and critical pressure, showing that a substance passes from vapor to liquid state without any breach of continuity. He concluded that... the gaseous and liquid states are only distant stages of the same condition of matter, and are capable of passing into one another by a process of continuous change.In Andrews&#x27; experiments on phase transitions, he showed that carbon dioxide may be carried from any of the states we usually call liquid to any of those we usually call gas, without losing homogeneity. The mathematical physicist Willard Gibbs cited these results in support of the Gibbs free energy equation. They also set off a race among researchers to liquify various other gases. In 1877-78 Louis Paul Cailletet was the first to liquefy oxygen.

<text>Concetto Antonio Sciacca (13 June 1947 – 21 June 2017) was an Australian politician of the Australian Labor Party and member of the Australian House of Representatives from July 1987 to March 1996 and again from October 1998 to October 2004, representing the Division of Bowman, Queensland.

== Early life ==
Sciacca was born on 13 June 1947 in the village of Piedimonte Etneo, Sicily, Italy. He migrated to Australia with his family in 1951 and settled in Queensland, where his father worked as a canecutter. After completion of his law studies, he became a solicitor in 1970 starting his law practice straight out of law school. He founded the group Sciaccas Lawyers which was taken over by the legal group of Shine Lawyers in 2014.

== Political career and recognition ==
Sciacca joined the ALP at the age of 17 and was state president of Young Labor in 1972. He first stood for parliament at the 1969 Queensland state election at the age of 21. He made three unsuccessful bids for the state seat of Redlands beginning in 1977, coming closest at the 1985 Redlands state by-election.

Sciacca successfully contested the 1987 Australian federal election and won the Division of Bowman. He consecutively won the next two elections of 1990 and 1993. He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security from 1990 to 1994, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Arts and Administrative Services 1993–94, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services 1994, Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs 1994–96 and Minister Assisting the Treasurer for Superannuation 1995–96. He thus served in the Fourth Hawke Ministry, the First Keating Ministry, and the Second Keating Ministry.

Sciacca was defeated by Liberal Party candidate Andrea West in the 1996 election. After his re-election in 1998, Sciacca was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1998–2001. After a redistribution made Bowman notionally Liberal, Sciacca contested the new Division of Bonner at the 2004 election, but was narrowly defeated by Liberal candidate Ross Vasta.

In 1992, Sciacca&#x27;s son Sam died of Ewing&#x27;s sarcoma at the age of 19. Thereafter he started the Sam Sciacca Travelling Fellowship through which health experts would visit Australia and present lectures on the latest developments in research and technology. In 2006, Sciacca was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for &quot;service to ex-service personnel, cancer research institutions and service to the Australian parliament&quot;. He dedicated the award to his deceased son.

== Health and death ==
Sciacca was suffering from cancer and in February 2015 was reported to have been cleared of it after an operation performed in 2014. In April 2015 he was operated on by ophthalmologist Bill Glasson for cataracts in both his eyes.

Sciacca died on 21 June 2017, aged 70, after prolonged suffering from cancer at St Vincent&#x27;s Private Hospital in Brisbane. He had frequently been admitted to the hospital in the last six months for his deteriorating health.

<doc id="595671" wikidata="Q467350" url="?curid=595671" title="Pascual Pérez (boxer)">
<text>Pascual Nicolás Pérez (May 4, 1926 – January 22, 1977) was an Argentine flyweight boxer. Pérez was born in Tupungato in the Mendoza Province of Argentina, he went on to make history by becoming Argentina&#x27;s first world boxing champion.

Pérez usually did poor at the ticket gates in Argentina after he became world champion, forcing him to defend his world title on the road many times and to become known as a world-traveling champion. His first international success was a gold medal at the 1948 Summer Olympics in United Kingdom.

He and Delfo Cabrera were the only two Argentines to be an Olympic gold medalists in the London Olympics of 1948. Perez reigned as World Champion from 1954 to 1960. As an amateur he fought 125 bouts. Turning professional in 1952, he fought 92 fights (84 wins, 7 losses and 1 draw), in which he won 57 fights by knockout, a record that places him in an elite group of boxers who have won more than 50 fights by knockouts. He defended his title against nine contenders in a span of six years. He is considered one of the three greatest flyweight boxers in history alongside Miguel Canto and Jimmy Wilde. Along with Carlos Monzon, he is considered one of the best fighters ever to box. He has been inducted in the International Boxing Hall of Fame. In 2004, the American Boxing Confederation posthumously declared him the South American champion.

==Early life==
Pérez was born into a family of winemakers in the Uco Valley, Tupungato district of the Mendoza province, where he was the youngest of nine children. He worked as a laborer for the family since childhood. In 1942, at age 16, Perez started boxing at the Rodeo Deportivo de la Cruz, led by Felipe Segura, Perez showing superb skill and power, unusual for a lighter weight boxer. Though naturally left-handed he trained right-handed; his height, which only reached 1.52 m as an adult, was smaller than the rest of his opponents in the flyweight division.

==Boxing career==
He debuted as an amateur in January 1944 and would contest in 125 bouts winning 16 amateur championships, including the gold medal at the 1948 London Olympics. The first tournament he won was the Mendocino Novice Championship, in March 1944, just two months after his debut.

That same year, his father had to pay money to hire a farm laborer who could replace Perez in the vineyard, as a condition for granting legal consent required by the regulations on parental rights. His parents kept a reluctant attitude towards his plans, and he began fighting under the name Pablo Pérez to avoid being caught by them.

In 1946 and 1947, Pascual Perez won the Mendoza, Argentine and Latin American championships, and in 1948, he won the tournament where the Argentina Olympic boxing team was selected, every member of this team won medals at the Olympic Games.

===London Olympics===
In the 1948 London Olympics, Pascual Perez (then 22 years old) won the tenth Olympic gold medal for Argentina (in the same Games, Argentina won two others) and the sixth for boxing (the same day another gold medal was obtained by fellow Argentine Rafael Iglesias). Perez had never fought outside of South America and was to compete in the same division with, and possibly fight against, the European champion, the Spanish Luis Martínez Zapata who, despite both him and Perez being respected by press and fans alike, was favored to win the gold. Initially Pascual Perez was mistakenly disqualified from the tournament when his official weight was mixed up with Arnoldo Parés, a boxer in a heavier class. However, after the confusion was cleared, Perez was cleared to box and the disqualification was rescinded.

Perez first faced the Filipino Ricardo Adolfo, winning by RSC (stoppage by the referee) in the second round. In the second match he faced the South African Desmond Williams, also winning by RSC, this time, in the third round. In the quarterfinals he defeated the Belgian Alex Bollaert and in the semifinals he beat the Czech František Majdloch.

In the finals, Pérez faced the Italian Spartacus Bandinelli (28 years old), who had an upset victory in the quarterfinals over the favored Martínez Zapata. In the first round, Perez dominated the match with his aggressive style, controlling the initial offensive of the Italian, with several successions of punches landed, including a strong right he landed at the end of the round. The second round was very intense, with Bandinelli fighting aggressively to recover points and Perez answering blow for blow, using his greater mobility to score points with his left forehand, taking advantage of the Italian&#x27;s tendency to keep his guard down. In the third round Perez again took the offensive from the start with a succession of direct left and right punches to Bandinelli&#x27;s face. Momentum swung several times, eventually with the Italian taking the offensive. Then the Argentine stopped the Italian&#x27;s counterattack with an uppercut, and the round ended with each exchanging blows in the center of the ring.

Felix Frascara of &quot;Figura&quot; magazine, covered the match and after Perez&#x27; victory commented:
Perez was labeled a hero in Mendoza, where the provincial parliament gave him a house and a job. Notably, in the next tournament held to select Argentine boxers for the 1952 Olympic Games, Perez lost a match by split decision, to Francisco Calvagno, being eliminated from the tournament. The chosen Argentine representative was Alberto Barenghi, who was eliminated in the first fight. After his removal, Perez decided to enter professional boxing, and two years later became the first world boxing champion from Argentina. His last amateur fight was November 14 of 1952, in the Golden Strip Club winning by points in five rounds against Paul Rapretti.

===Professional career===
Pérez made his professional career with manager Lazarus Koci, who also managed José María Mono Gatica, and reorganized professional boxing in Argentina.

On December 5, 1952, Pérez beat José Ciorino by knockout in round four at the small Argentine city of Gerly, to begin his professional boxing career. After winning his first six fights by knockout, he challenged Marcelo Quiroga on November 11 of 1953, for the Argentine Flyweight title, winning the fight by a fourth-round knockout at Buenos Aires.

Pérez&#x27;s knockout streak reached 18 knockouts in a row, and it lasted until he met Juan Bishop, on April 22, 1954, winning by a ten-round decision.

On July 24 of that year, and with a record of 23 wins, no losses, with 22 wins by knockout, Pérez met Yoshio Shirai, who, coincidentally, had been Japan&#x27;s first world champion in history, in a non-title fight held at Buenos Aires. The Argentine ambassador in Japan, Carlos Quiroz, at the direction of then-President Juan D. Peron, took steps to set up a match in Buenos Aires against Shirai, without the title at stake. The fight took ten rounds at Luna Park on July 24 of 1954, with the presence of President Perón, sitting ringside . The match ended tied and was an extraordinary event in the country, for the first time an Argentine professional boxer was not defeated by a world champion. The tie forced Yoshio Shirai, as was standard in the boxing world then, to grant a rematch against the Argentine boxer again in a fight with the title at stake.

====Flyweight world title====
On November 26 of 1954, Pérez fought what was both his first fight abroad outside the Olympics, and his first world title fight. The Argentine knocked down the champion in the 2nd round and again in the 12th, in which the champion returned to his corner almost knocked out. From rounds 13 - 15, Perez nearly knocked out Shirai several times. After the fight, the score reflected a wide difference unanimously in favor of the Argentine. Referee Jack Sullivan had it 146–139, Judge Bill Pacheco, 143–139, and judge Kuniharu Hayashi, 146-143 all in Perez&#x27; favor. He made history by beating Shirai by a fifteen-round decision, becoming Argentina&#x27;s first world champion boxer, in Tokyo. Pascualito became the smallest flyweight boxer to win a title.

Over the course of Pérez&#x27;s next fights, he would defend his title only nine times, lose for the first time, and fight in Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Curaçao, Japan, Paraguay, the Philippines, Thailand, Uruguay and Venezuela. Many of his fights would have been title fights, but some of his opponents were not able to make the Flyweight division&#x27;s 112 pound weight limit, so Pérez often had to settle for non-title wins instead. He lost his undefeated record to Japan&#x27;s Sadao Yaoita on January 16 of 1959, by a ten-round decision in Tokyo. Among the fighters he defeated to retain his world title were Dai Dower (by a first-round knockout), Dommy Ursua (by a fifteen-round decision) and Yaoita in a rematch, by a thirteenth-round knockout.

Pérez would lose his title to another first time world champion, Thailand&#x27;s Pone Kingpetch, who made history for his country by beating Pérez by a fifteen-round decision at Bangkok on April 16, 1960. A rematch between Pérez and Kingpetch was fought on September 22 of the same year, at Los Angeles, but Pérez&#x27;s first fight in the United States was also his first knockout defeat, as he was beaten in eight rounds by Kingpetch.

====Later fights====
Pérez won his next twenty-eight bouts, mostly against nondescript opposition but he did score a pair of victories over the once-promising but by then fading Uruguayan Waldemiro Torres. Then, after dropping a split decision to Filipino veteran Leo Zulueta and outpointing Panamanian journeyman Manuel Moreno in his next two bouts, he faced perennial world title contender Bernardo Caraballo in Colombia on July 23, 1963. Pérez lost by a ten-round decision.

He finished his career with fights in Ecuador, Mexico and Panama, going 1-2 including losing by third-round knockout to future world flyweight champion Efren Torres in his fight on Mexican soil. His final fight, at the age of 37, was against Panamanian Eugenio Hurtado, who won by technical knock-out on March 15, 1964.

Pérez had a record of 84 wins, 7 losses and 1 draw, with 58 knockouts, numbers which place him in the exclusive group of boxers to have won 50 or more fights by knockout.

==Awards and legacy==
He has been inducted into both the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame.
On his death in 1977, Pascual Pérez was interred in the La Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In 1955 he was awarded the Gold Olimpia Award. Perez in 1977 entered the International Boxing Hall of Fame organized by the magazine &quot;Ring&quot;. In 1995, the Hall of Fame in Canastota (IBHOF) did the same, where he is included with Argentine boxers Carlos Monzon, Nicolino Locche, and Victor Galindez. In 2004, he was officially declared the South American champion, by the American Boxing Confederation.

The Mendoza Boxing Palace of the Mendoza Boxing Federation, reopened in 2007, was named Estadio Pascual Perez, in his memory.

In 1954, writer Rafael Lauria and musicians Hector Maure and Sergio Gasparini composed a tango titled &quot;The great champion,&quot; recorded by Hector Maure, part of which reads:

Prominent journalist Chon Romero praised Pascual Perez in the following statement:
In 1980, with the first edition of the Konex Awards, the Konex Foundation awarded a Diploma of Merit to Perez as one of the top 5 boxers in the history of Argentina.

Boxrec.com ranks Pérez as the number one flyweight of all time.

<text>Alexander Matveyevich Matrosov ( February 5, 1924 – February 27, 1943) was a Soviet infantry soldier during the Second World War, posthumously awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union reportedly for blocking a German machine-gun with his body.

His official Soviet biography states he was born in Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipro). However an evidence emerged that both his name and place of birth were invented by him while he was a street child. There are several versions about his origins.

==Acts of bravery==
Matrosov was a private in the 2nd Separate Rifle Battalion of the 91st Independent Siberian Volunteer Brigade, later renamed and the 254th Rifle Regiment and reorganized within the 56th Guards Rifle Division of the Soviet Army. He was armed with a light machine-gun.

On 23 and 24 February 1943, in the battle to recapture village of Chernushki, near Velikiye Luki, currently in Loknyansky District, Pskov Oblast, the Soviet forces struggled to take a German heavy machine-gun, housed within a concrete pillbox, which blocked the route to the village. It had already claimed the lives of many of the Red Army troops. Matrosov crept up to the pillbox and released a burst of rounds into the slot in the pillbox. One round hit a mine inside, and the machine-gun temporarily fell silent. It restarted a few minutes later. At this point Matrosov physically pulled himself up and jammed his body into the slot, wholly blocking the fire at his comrades but clearly at the cost of his own life. This allowed his unit to advance and capture the pillbox and thereafter retake the village.

For his self-sacrifice in battle, Matrosov was posthumously awarded the distinction Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin.

Stalin officially renamed his regiment the Matrosov Regiment.

According to one of versions Alexander Matrosov was actually of a Bashkir ethnic minority and his real name Shakiryan Muhammedyanov was Russified.

On 5 January 2023, the day after the monument to Matrosov in his place of birth Dnipro, Ukraine (then Yekaterinoslav, USSR) was dismantled in as part of the derussification and decommunization campaigns following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Mayor of Dnipro Borys Filatov claimed that Matrosov had never been to Yekaterinoslav but he had pretended to be born there so that he looked like a Russian person in Soviet documents. Filatov also stated that Matrosov was actually of Bashkir ethnicity.

===Similar cases===
More than were posthumously awarded by the Soviet government for blocking enemy pillboxes with their bodies.

According to Beijing People&#x27;s Daily, Matrosov&#x27;s tale also inspired Huang Jiguang, a famous Chinese revolutionary martyr, to perform a similar feat during the Korean War.

During the First Indochina War, in Battle of Dien Bien Phu. A Viet Minh soldier named Phan Đình Giót sacrificed his life to fill the machine gun bunker of the French army to create opportunities for teammates to advance.

==In popular culture==

Matrosov is the main character a number of books and of the 1947 war film, &quot;Private Alexander Matrosov&quot; (&quot;Рядовой Александр Матросов&quot;), directed by Leonid Lukov.

<doc id="595692" wikidata="Q1094387" url="?curid=595692" title="Malabar grey hornbill">
<text>The Malabar gray hornbill (Ocyceros griseus) is a hornbill endemic to the Western Ghats and associated hills of southern India. They have a large beak but lack the casque that is prominent in some other hornbill species. They are found mainly in dense forest and around rubber, arecanut or coffee plantations. They move around in pairs or small groups, feeding on figs and other forest fruits. Their loud cackling and laughing call makes them familiar to people living in the region.

==Description==

The Malabar grey hornbill is a large bird, but at in length it is still the smallest of the Asian hornbills. It has a tail and pale or yellowish to orange bill. Males have a reddish bill with a yellow tip, while the females have a plain yellow bill with black at the base of the lower mandible and a black stripe along the culmen. They show a broad whitish superciliary band above the eye, running down to the neck. They fly with a strong flap and glide flight and hop around heavily on the outer branches of large fruiting trees. They have brown-grey wings, a white carpal patch and black primary flight feathers tipped with white. The Indian grey hornbill, which is found mainly on the adjoining plains, is easily told apart by its prominent casque, and in flight by the white trailing edge of the entire wing. The Malabar grey hornbill has a grey back and a cinnamon vent. The long tail is blackish with a white tip, and the underparts are grey with white streaks. The long curved bill has no casque. Immature birds have browner upperparts and a yellow bill. Young birds have a dull white or yellow iris.

Their loud calls are distinctive and include &quot;hysterical cackling&quot;, &quot;laughing&quot; and &quot;screeching&quot; calls.

== Local names ==
சோலைக்  காகா (&quot;solai kaka,&quot; Tamil, meaning forest crow); சராட்டான் (&quot;sarattaan&quot;, Kadar); செரியன் ஓங்கல் (&quot;seriyan oongal&quot;, Muthuvan, meaning small hornbill); ಕಲ್ದಲ್ ಹಕ್ಕಿ (&quot;kaldal hakki&quot;, Kannada), കോഴിവേഴാമ്പൽ (&quot;kozhi vezhambal&quot;, Malayalam), &quot;chotta peelu&quot; or &quot;dhanesh&quot; in Marathi, and &quot;gobre vaayre&quot; in Konkani. 
==Distribution==
The species is endemic to the Western Ghats mountain range of India from about Nashik in the north to the southernmost hills. The species has an elevational distribution range from about 50 m near the coast (e.g., Phansad Wildlife Sanctuary, Maharashtra) to around 1,500 m in the mountains. In the southern Western Ghats, Malabar Grey Hornbills were reported in evergreen forests between 500 m and 900 m (sporadically to 1,100 m) elevation in Kalakad – Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, but frequently up to 1,200 m in the Anamalai Hills further north. In both these sites, the estimated Malabar Grey Hornbill density decreased with elevation, with the population density in rainforest fragments in the Anamalai Hills being additionally positively related to food tree species richness. The species is found mainly in dense forest habitats; the thinner dry forest habitat of the plains is typically occupied by the Indian grey hornbill. The Sri Lanka grey hornbill was included with this species in the past, but is now considered distinct.

===Behaviour and ecology===
This hornbill is found in small groups mainly in habitats with good tree cover. Being large frugivores, they are important as seed dispersal agents for many species of fruit bearing forest trees. They also feed on small vertebrates and in captivity they will readily take meat.

===Breeding===
The breeding season is January to May. Being secondary cavity nesters (incapable of excavating their own nests), they find trees with large cavities. A study in the Anaimalai Hills showed that the species preferred nest sites that had large trees. The nest holes were usually found in large trees with hollows caused by heart-rot, where a branch had broken off. Trees of the species &quot;Lagerstroemia microcarpa&quot;, &quot;Terminalia bellirica&quot; and &quot;Terminalia crenulata&quot; were found to hold nearly 70% of all the nests in the Mudumalai area. The species is monogamous, and the same nest sites are used by the pair year after year. The female incarcerates herself within the cavity by sealing its entrance with a cement made from her droppings. The female then lays three or sometimes four white eggs and begins a complete moult of her flight feathers. The entrance to the nest retains a narrow aperture through which the female voids excreta and receives food from the male. The male brings all the food needed for the female and the young. Berries, insects, small rodents and reptiles are included in the diet. Males tap the tree to beckon the female on arriving with food. Berries are regurgitated one at a time and shifted to the tip of the bill before being passed to the female.

<text>A fat binary (or multiarchitecture binary) is a computer executable program or library which has been expanded (or &quot;fattened&quot;) with code native to multiple instruction sets which can consequently be run on multiple processor types. This results in a file larger than a normal one-architecture binary file, thus the name.

The usual method of implementation is to include a version of the machine code for each instruction set, preceded by a single entry point with code compatible with all operating systems, which executes a jump to the appropriate section. Alternative implementations store different executables in different forks, each with its own entry point that is directly used by the operating system.

The use of fat binaries is not common in operating system software; there are several alternatives to solve the same problem, such as the use of an installer program to choose an architecture-specific binary at install time (such as with Android multiple APKs), selecting an architecture-specific binary at runtime (such as with Plan 9&#x27;s union directories and GNUstep&#x27;s fat bundles), distributing software in source code form and compiling it in-place, or the use of a virtual machine (such as with Java) and just-in-time compilation.

==Apollo==
===Apollo&#x27;s compound executables===
In 1988, Apollo Computer&#x27;s Domain/OS SR10.1 introduced a new file type, &quot;cmpexe&quot; (compound executable), that bundled binaries for Motorola 680x0 and Apollo PRISM executables.

==Apple==
===Apple&#x27;s fat binary===
A fat-binary scheme smoothed the Apple Macintosh&#x27;s transition, beginning in 1994, from 68k microprocessors to PowerPC microprocessors. Many applications for the old platform ran transparently on the new platform under an evolving emulation scheme, but emulated code generally runs slower than native code. Applications released as &quot;fat binaries&quot; took up more storage space, but they ran at full speed on either platform. This was achieved by packaging both a 68000-compiled version and a PowerPC-compiled version of the same program into their executable files. The older 68K code (CFM-68K or classic 68K) continued to be stored in the resource fork, while the newer PowerPC code was contained in the data fork, in PEF format.

Fat binaries were larger than programs supporting only the PowerPC or 68k, which led to the creation of a number of utilities that would strip out the unneeded version. In the era of small hard drives, when 80 MB hard drives were a common size, these utilities were sometimes useful, as program code was generally a large percentage of overall drive usage, and stripping the unneeded members of a fat binary would free up a significant amount of space on a hard drive.

===NeXT&#x27;s/Apple&#x27;s multi-architecture binaries===
====NeXTSTEP Multi-Architecture Binaries====
Fat binaries were a feature of NeXT&#x27;s NeXTSTEP/OPENSTEP operating system, starting with NeXTSTEP 3.1. In NeXTSTEP, they were called &quot;Multi-Architecture Binaries&quot;. Multi-Architecture Binaries were originally intended to allow software to be compiled to run both on NeXT&#x27;s Motorola 68k-based hardware and on Intel IA-32-based PCs running NeXTSTEP, with a single binary file for both platforms. It was later used to allow OPENSTEP applications to run on PCs and the various RISC platforms OPENSTEP supported. Multi-Architecture Binary files are in a special archive format, in which a single file stores one or more Mach-O subfiles for each architecture supported by the Multi-Architecture Binary. Every Multi-Architecture Binary starts with a structure () containing two unsigned integers. The first integer (&quot;magic&quot;) is used as a magic number to identify this file as a Fat Binary. The second integer () defines how many Mach-O Files the archive contains (how many instances of the same program for different architectures). After this header, there are &quot;&quot; number of fat_arch structures (). This structure defines the offset (from the start of the file) at which to find the file, the alignment, the size and the CPU type and subtype which the Mach-O binary (within the archive) is targeted at.

The version of the GNU Compiler Collection shipped with the Developer Tools was able to cross-compile source code for the different architectures on which NeXTStep was able to run. For example, it was possible to choose the target architectures with multiple &#x27;-arch&#x27; options (with the architecture as argument). This was a convenient way to distribute a program for NeXTStep running on different architectures.

It was also possible to create libraries (e.g. using NeXTStep&#x27;s ) with different targeted object files.

====Mach-O and Mac OS X====
Apple Computer acquired NeXT in 1996 and continued to work with the OPENSTEP code. Mach-O became the native object file format in Apple&#x27;s free Darwin operating system (2000) and Apple&#x27;s Mac OS X (2001), and NeXT&#x27;s Multi-Architecture Binaries continued to be supported by the operating system. Under Mac OS X, Multi-Architecture Binaries can be used to support multiple variants of an architecture, for instance to have different versions of 32-bit code optimized for the PowerPC G3, PowerPC G4, and PowerPC 970 generations of processors. It can also be used to support multiple architectures, such as 32-bit and 64-bit PowerPC, or PowerPC and x86, or x86-64 and ARM64.

====Apple&#x27;s Universal binary====
In 2005, Apple announced another transition, from PowerPC processors to Intel x86 processors. Apple promoted the distribution of new applications that support both PowerPC and x86 natively by using executable files in Multi-Architecture Binary format. Apple calls such programs &quot;Universal applications&quot; and calls the file format &quot;Universal binary&quot; as perhaps a way to distinguish this new transition from the previous transition, or other uses of Multi-Architecture Binary format.

Universal binary format was not necessary for forward migration of pre-existing native PowerPC applications; from 2006 to 2011, Apple supplied Rosetta, a PowerPC (PPC)-to-x86 dynamic binary translator, to play this role. However, Rosetta had a fairly steep performance overhead, so developers were encouraged to offer both PPC and Intel binaries, using Universal binaries. The obvious cost of Universal binary is that every installed executable file is larger, but in the years since the release of the PPC, hard-drive space has greatly outstripped executable size; while a Universal binary might be double the size of a single-platform version of the same application, free-space resources generally dwarf the code size, which becomes a minor issue. In fact, often a Universal-binary application will be smaller than two single-architecture applications because program resources can be shared rather than duplicated. If not all of the architectures are required, the and command-line applications can be used to remove versions from the Multi-Architecture Binary image, thereby creating what is sometimes called a &quot;thin binary&quot;.

In addition, Multi-Architecture Binary executables can contain code for both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of PowerPC and x86, allowing applications to be shipped in a form that supports 32-bit processors but that makes use of the larger address space and wider data paths when run on 64-bit processors.

In versions of the Xcode development environment from 2.1 through 3.2 (running on Mac OS X 10.4 through Mac OS X 10.6), Apple included utilities which allowed applications to be targeted for both Intel and PowerPC architecture; universal binaries could eventually contain up to four versions of the executable code (32-bit PowerPC, 32-bit x86, 64-bit PowerPC, and 64-bit x86). However, PowerPC support was removed from Xcode 4.0 and is therefore not available to developers running Mac OS X 10.7 or greater.

In 2020, Apple announced another transition, this time from Intel x86 processors to Apple silicon (ARM64 architecture). To smooth the transition Apple added support for the Universal 2 binary format; Universal 2 binary files are Multi-Architecture Binary files containing both x86-64 and ARM64 executable code, allowing the binary to run natively on both 64-bit Intel and 64-bit Apple silicon. Additionally, Apple introduced Rosetta 2 dynamic binary translation for x86 to Arm64 instruction set to allow users to run applications that do not have Universal binary variants.

==== Apple Fat EFI binary ====
In 2006, Apple switched from PowerPC to Intel CPUs, and replaced Open Firmware with EFI. However, by 2008, some of their Macs used 32-bit EFI and some used 64-bit EFI. For this reason, Apple extended the EFI specification with &quot;fat&quot; binaries that contained both 32-bit and 64-bit EFI binaries.

==CP/M and DOS==
===Combined COM-style binaries for CP/M-80 and DOS===
CP/M-80, MP/M-80, Concurrent CP/M, CP/M Plus, Personal CP/M-80, SCP and MSX-DOS executables for the Intel 8080 (and Zilog Z80) processor families use the same .COM file extension as DOS-compatible operating systems for Intel 8086 binaries. In both cases programs are loaded at offset +100h and executed by jumping to the first byte in the file. As the opcodes of the two processor families are not compatible, attempting to start a program under the wrong operating system leads to incorrect and unpredictable behaviour.

In order to avoid this, some methods have been devised to build fat binaries which contain both a CP/M-80 and a DOS program, preceded by initial code which is interpreted correctly on both platforms. The methods either combine two fully functional programs each built for their corresponding environment, or add stubs which cause the program to exit gracefully if started on the wrong processor. For this to work, the first few instructions (sometimes also called &quot;gadget headers&quot;) in the .COM file have to be valid code for both 8086 and 8080 processors, which would cause the processors to branch into different locations within the code.
For example, the utilities in Simeon Cran&#x27;s emulator MyZ80 start with the opcode sequence . An 8086 sees this as a jump and reads its next instruction from offset +154h whereas an 8080 or compatible processor goes straight through and reads its next instruction from +103h.
A similar sequence used for this purpose is .
John C. Elliott&#x27;s FATBIN is a utility to combine a CP/M-80 and a DOS .COM file into one executable. His derivative of the original PMsfx modifies archives created by Yoshihiko Mino&#x27;s PMarc to be self-extractable under &quot;both&quot;, CP/M-80 and DOS, starting with to also include the &quot;-pms-&quot; signature for self-extracting PMA archives, thereby also representing a form of executable ASCII code.

Another method to keep a DOS-compatible operating system from erroneously executing .COM programs for CP/M-80 and MSX-DOS machines is to start the 8080 code with , which is decoded as a &quot;RET&quot; instruction by x86 processors, thereby gracefully exiting the program, while it will be decoded as &quot;JP 103h&quot; instruction by 8080 processors and simply jump to the next instruction in the program. Similar, the CP/M assembler Z80ASM+ by SLR Systems would display an error message when erroneously run on DOS.

Some CP/M-80 3.0 .COM files may have one or more RSX overlays attached to them by GENCOM. If so, they start with an extra 256-byte header (one page). In order to indicate this, the first byte in the header is set to magic byte , which works both as a signature identifying this type of COM file to the CP/M 3.0 executable loader, as well as a &quot;RET&quot; instruction for 8080-compatible processors which leads to a graceful exit if the file is executed under older versions of CP/M-80.

 is never appropriate as the first byte of a program for any x86 processor (it has different meanings for different generations, but is never a meaningful first byte); the executable loader in some versions of DOS rejects COM files that start with , avoiding incorrect operation.

Similar overlapping code sequences have also been devised for combined Z80/6502, 8086/68000 or x86/MIPS/ARM binaries.

===Combined binaries for CP/M-86 and DOS===
CP/M-86 and DOS do not share a common file extension for executables. Thus, it is not normally possible to confuse executables. However, early versions of DOS had so much in common with CP/M in terms of its architecture that some early DOS programs were developed to share binaries containing executable code. One program known to do this was WordStar 3.2x, which used identical overlay files in their ports for CP/M-86 and MS-DOS, and used dynamically fixed-up code to adapt to the differing calling conventions of these operating systems at runtime.

Digital Research&#x27;s GSX for CP/M-86 and DOS also shares binary identical 16-bit drivers.

===Combined COM and SYS files===
DOS device drivers (typically with file extension .SYS) start with a file header whose first four bytes are FFFFFFFFh by convention, although this is not a requirement. This is fixed up dynamically by the operating system when the driver loads (typically in the DOS BIOS when it executes DEVICE statements in CONFIG.SYS). Since DOS does not reject files with a .COM extension to be loaded per DEVICE and does not test for FFFFFFFFh, it is possible to combine a COM program and a device driver into the same file by placing a jump instruction to the entry point of the embedded COM program within the first four bytes of the file (three bytes are usually sufficient). If the embedded program and the device driver sections share a common portion of code, or data, it is necessary for the code to deal with being loaded at offset +0100h as a .COM style program, and at +0000h as a device driver. For shared code loaded at the &quot;wrong&quot; offset but not designed to be position-independent, this requires an internal address fix-up similar to what would otherwise already have been carried out by a relocating loader, except for that in this case it has to be done by the loaded program itself; this is similar to the situation with self-relocating drivers but with the program already loaded at the target location by the operating system&#x27;s loader.

===Crash-protected system files===
Under DOS, some files, by convention, have file extensions which do not reflect their actual file type. For example, COUNTRY.SYS is not a DOS device driver, but a binary NLS database file for use with the CONFIG.SYS COUNTRY directive and the NLSFUNC driver. Likewise, the PC DOS and DR-DOS system files IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM are special binary images loaded by bootstrap loaders, not COM-style programs. Trying to load COUNTRY.SYS with a DEVICE statement or executing IBMBIO.COM or IBMDOS.COM at the command prompt will cause unpredictable results.

It is sometimes possible to avoid this by utilizing techniques similar to those described above. For example, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher incorporate a safety feature developed by Matthias R. Paul: If these files are called inappropriately, tiny embedded stubs will just display some file version information and exit gracefully. Additionally, the message is specifically crafted to follow certain &quot;magic&quot; patterns recognized by the external NetWare &amp; DR-DOS VERSION file identification utility.

A similar protection feature was the 8080 instruction (&quot;RST 0&quot;) at the very start of Jay Sage&#x27;s and Joe Wright&#x27;s Z-System type-3 and type-4 &quot;Z3ENV&quot; programs as well as &quot;Z3TXT&quot; language overlay files, which would result in a warm boot (instead of a crash) under CP/M-80 if loaded inappropriately.

In a distantly similar fashion, many (binary) file formats by convention include a byte (ASCII ^Z) near the beginning of the file. This control character will be interpreted as &quot;soft&quot; end-of-file (EOF) marker when a file is opened in non-binary mode, and thus, under many operating systems (including the PDP-6 monitor and RT-11, VMS, TOPS-10, CP/M, DOS, and Windows), it prevents &quot;binary garbage&quot; from being displayed when a file is accidentally printed at the console.

==Linux==
===FatELF: Universal binaries for Linux===

FatELF was a fat binary implementation for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Technically, a FatELF binary was a concatenation of ELF binaries with some meta data indicating which binary to use on what architecture. Additionally to the CPU architecture abstraction (byte order, word size, CPU instruction set, etc.), there is the advantage of binaries with support for multiple kernel ABIs and versions.

FatELF has several use-cases, according to developers:
* Distributions no longer need to have separate downloads for various platforms.
* Separated &quot;/lib&quot;, &quot;/lib32&quot; and &quot;/lib64&quot; trees are not required anymore in OS directory structure.
* The correct binary and libraries are centrally chosen by the system instead of shell scripts.
* If the ELF ABI changes someday, legacy users can be still supported.
* Distribution of web browser plug ins that work out of the box with multiple platforms.
* Distribution of one application file that works across Linux and BSD OS variants, without a platform compatibility layer on them.
* One hard drive partition can be booted on different machines with different CPU architectures, for development and experimentation. Same root file system, different kernel and CPU architecture.
* Applications provided by network share or USB sticks, will work on multiple systems. This is also helpful for creating portable applications and also cloud computing images for heterogeneous systems.

A proof-of-concept Ubuntu 9.04 image is available. , FatELF has not been integrated into the mainline Linux kernel.

==Windows==
===Fatpack===
Although the Portable Executable format used by Windows does not allow assigning code to platforms, it is still possible to make a loader program that dispatches based on architecture. This is because desktop versions of Windows on ARM have support for 32-bit x86 emulation, making it a useful &quot;universal&quot; machine code target. Fatpack is a loader that demonstrates the concept: it includes a 32-bit x86 program that tries to run the executables packed into its resource sections one by one.

===Arm64X===
When developing Windows 11 ARM64, Microsoft introduced a new way to extend the Portable Executable format called Arm64X. An Arm64X binary contains all the content that would be in separate x64/Arm64EC and Arm64 binaries, but merged into one more efficient file on disk. Visual C++ toolset has been upgraded to support producing such binaries. And when building Arm64X binaries are technically difficult, developers can build Arm64X pure forwarder DLLs instead.

==Similar concepts==
The following approaches are similar to fat binaries in that multiple versions of machine code of the same purpose are provided in the same file.

=== Heterogeneous computing===
Since 2007, some specialized compilers for heterogeneous platforms produce code files for parallel execution on multiple types of processors, i.e. the CHI (C for Heterogeneous Integration) compiler from the Intel EXOCHI (Exoskeleton Sequencer) development suite extends the OpenMP pragma concept for multithreading to produce fat binaries containing code sections for different instruction set architectures (ISAs) from which the runtime loader can dynamically initiate the parallel execution on multiple available CPU and GPU cores in a heterogeneous system environment.

Introduced in 2006, Nvidia&#x27;s parallel computing platform CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a software to enable general-purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU). Its LLVM-based compiler NVCC can create ELF-based fat binaries containing so called PTX virtual assembly (as text) which the CUDA runtime driver can later just-in-time compile into some SASS (Streaming Assembler) binary executable code for the actually present target GPU. The executables can also include so called &quot;CUDA binaries&quot; (aka &quot;cubin&quot; files) containing dedicated executable code sections for one or more specific GPU architectures from which the CUDA runtime can choose from at load-time. Fat binaries are also supported by , a GPU simulator introduced in 2007 as well.

Multi2Sim (M2S), an OpenCL heterogeneous system simulator framework (originally only for either MIPS or x86 CPUs, but later extended to also support ARM CPUs and GPUs like the AMD/ATI Evergreen &amp; Southern Islands as well as Nvidia Fermi &amp; Kepler families) supports ELF-based fat binaries as well.

===Fat objects===
GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and LLVM do not have a fat binary format, but they do have fat &quot;object files&quot; for link-time optimization (LTO). Since LTO involves delaying the compilation to link-time, the object files must store the intermediate representation (IR), but on the other hand machine code may need to be stored too (for speed or compatibility). An LTO object containing both IR and machine code is known as a &quot;fat object&quot;.

===Function multi-versioning===
Even in a program or library intended for the same instruction set architecture, a programmer may wish to make use of some newer instruction set extensions while keeping compatibility with an older CPU. This can be achieved with &quot;function multi-versioning&quot; (FMV): versions of the same function are written into the program, and a piece of code decides which one to use by detecting the CPU&#x27;s capabilities (such as through CPUID). Intel C++ Compiler, GCC, and LLVM all have the ability to automatically generate multi-versioned functions. This is a form of dynamic dispatch without any semantic effects.

Many math libraries feature hand-written assembly routines that are automatically chosen according to CPU capability. Examples include glibc, Intel MKL, and OpenBLAS. In addition, the library loader in glibc supports loading from alternative paths for specific CPU features.

A similar, but byte-level granular approach originally devised by Matthias R. Paul and Axel C. Frinke is to let a small self-discarding, relaxing and relocating loader embedded into the executable file alongside any number of alternative binary code snippets conditionally build a size- or speed-optimized runtime image of a program or driver necessary to perform (or not perform) a particular function in a particular target environment at load-time through a form of dynamic dead code elimination (DDCE).

<text>One Tree Hill is a town on the outskirts of Adelaide, South Australia. It is located in the City of Playford.

==History==
The town takes its name from the &#x27;One Tree Hill Inn&#x27; (licensed in 1851), for many years the meeting place of the District Council of Munno Para East. The inn&#x27;s name, in turn, referred to a giant red gum tree which stood on the intersection of Black Top Road and Walters Road. The tree burnt down in 1890 and was cut down in 1934 and replaced with 5 trees which can still be seen today.

===Aboriginal history===
The Kaurna people were the indigenous inhabitants of the Adelaide region, which includes One Tree Hill. The Peramangk people, living further inland, visited the area from time to time, chiefly in the warmer parts of the year. This was due to the area being cooler and better watered than the plains. The hills at this time were well wooded with tree species that had been in the area for around 6000 years. Along the rivers and creeks and wide valleys could be found tall, heavy eucalypts, many of which had wide, hollowed bases large enough for the Aboriginals to use as shelters. There were many such shelter trees in use by the Kaurna and Peramangk as late as the 1840s, and evidence exists that they hunted and gathered in the woodlands and grasslands for many generations prior to European settlement. Unfortunately, the community declined soon after European settlement, and most of what we know about them today comes from the few artifacts and sparse archaeological evidence that they left behind.

===European settlement===
Europeans settled the area in the early 1840s, and the township commenced in 1851 with the building of the One Tree Hill Inn. The settlement was located in a strategic location, being close to several larger towns (such as Gawler and Salisbury) with facilities, and became the meeting place of the surrounding rural community, including Gould Creek and Uleybury. A post office and general store were built in 1858 which featured a large cellar where produce including local wine was sold. In 1906, the Institute, which cost about £600, was built across the road from the post office, and became a town meeting place and recreation centre, which was expanded considerably in 1978.

One Tree Hill Post Office opened on 19 May 1857.

==Demographics==
The 2016 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 1,095 persons in One Tree Hill on census night. Of these, 569 (52.2%) were male and 522 (47.8%) were female.
The majority of residents 791 (72.7%) are of Australian birth, with 155 14.2% born in England.
The median age of One Tree Hill residents is 45. Children aged 0 – 14 years made up 16.8% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 14.9% of the population.

==Community==
The township has one primary school and several historic primary school buildings: Precolumb School (1855-1938), Uley School (1856 to 1971, now the Uleybury School Museum). In 1972 the current primary school was built on McGilp Road. One Tree Hill has an Institute Hall built 1906 and Uniting Church built 1867 (originally Methodist) and many historic buildings. The township has a small shopping centre and a hotel named the Blacksmiths Inn.

==Attractions==

===Parks===
The Para Wirra Conservation Park is north-east of the town.

==Transport==
There is no specific provision for bicycles on any of the local roads. There are footpaths on most roads within the town and along Black Top Road in some sections up three kilometres west of the town using land from the old alignment of the road.

===Roads===
The town is serviced by the following main roads:
* Black Top Road to Adelaide and Salisbury
* Yorktown Road to Elizabeth
* Gawler - Kersbrook Road to Kersbrook, Gawler and Williamstown
* One Tree Hill Road to Golden Grove

===Public transport===
The area is not serviced by Adelaide public transport; the nearest service is an Adelaide Metro bus route at Craigmore, five kilometres to the west of the town.

From the commencement of a Bowman&#x27;s bus service around 1937 until Friday 14 May 1982, a daily bus service ran from the township to Adelaide via Golden Grove and North East Road (Route 540E). Before that the nearest transport was at Smithfield Railway Station.

<doc id="595704" wikidata="Q922585" url="?curid=595704" title="Orthophoto">
<text>An orthophoto, orthophotograph, orthoimage or orthoimagery is an aerial photograph or satellite imagery geometrically corrected (&quot;orthorectified&quot;) such that the scale is uniform: the photo or image follows a given map projection. Unlike an uncorrected aerial photograph, an orthophoto can be used to measure true distances, because it is an accurate representation of the Earth&#x27;s surface, having been adjusted for topographic relief, lens distortion, and camera tilt.

Orthophotographs are commonly used in geographic information systems (GIS) as a &quot;map accurate&quot; background image. An orthorectified image differs from &quot;rubber sheeted&quot; rectifications as the latter may accurately locate a number of points on each image but &quot;stretch&quot; the area between so scale may not be uniform across the image. A digital elevation model (DEM) is required to create an accurate orthophoto as distortions in the image due to the varying distance between the camera/sensor and different points on the ground need to be corrected. An orthoimage and a &quot;rubber sheeted&quot; image can both be said to have been &quot;georeferenced&quot;; however, the overall accuracy of the rectification varies. Software can display the orthophoto and allow an operator to digitize or place linework, text annotations or geographic symbols (such as hospitals, schools, and fire stations). Some software can process the orthophoto and produce the linework automatically.

Production of orthophotos was historically achieved using mechanical devices.

The orthorectification is not always perfect and has side effect especially for the geometry of high-rise constructions.

==Orthophotomosaic and orthophotomap ==

An orthophotomosaic is a raster image mosaic made by merging or stitching orthophotos. The aerial or satellite photographs have been transformed to correct for perspective so that they appear to have been taken from vertically above at an infinite distance. Google Earth images are of this type.

The document (digital or paper) representing an orthophotomosaic with additional marginal information like a title, north arrow, scale bar and cartographical information is called an orthophotomap or image map. Often these maps show additional point, line or polygon layers (like a traditional map) on top of the orthophotomosaic. A similar document, mostly used for disaster relief, is called a spatiomap.

<doc id="595708" wikidata="Q3589429" url="?curid=595708" title="Functional equation (L-function)">
<text>In mathematics, the &quot;L&quot;-functions of number theory are expected to have several characteristic properties, one of which is that they satisfy certain [[functional equation]]s. There is an elaborate theory of what these equations should be, much of which is still conjectural.

== Introduction ==

A prototypical example, the Riemann zeta function has a functional equation relating its value at the complex number &quot;s&quot; with its value at 1 − &quot;s&quot;. In every case this relates to some value ζ(&quot;s&quot;) that is only defined by analytic continuation from the infinite series definition. That is, writingas is conventionalσ for the real part of &quot;s&quot;, the functional equation relates the cases

:σ &gt; 1 and σ &lt; 0,

and also changes a case with

:0 &lt; σ &lt; 1

in the &quot;critical strip&quot; to another such case, reflected in the line σ = ½. Therefore, use of the functional equation is basic, in order to study the zeta-function in the whole complex plane.

The functional equation in question for the Riemann zeta function takes the simple form

:formula_1

where &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is ζ(&quot;s&quot;) multiplied by a &quot;gamma-factor&quot;, involving the gamma function. This is now read as an &#x27;extra&#x27; factor in the Euler product for the zeta-function, corresponding to the infinite prime. Just the same shape of functional equation holds for the Dedekind zeta function of a number field &quot;K&quot;, with an appropriate gamma-factor that depends only on the embeddings of &quot;K&quot; (in algebraic terms, on the tensor product of &quot;K&quot; with the real field).

There is a similar equation for the Dirichlet L-functions, but this time relating them in pairs:

:formula_2

with χ a primitive Dirichlet character, χ* its complex conjugate, Λ the L-function multiplied by a gamma-factor, and ε a complex number of absolute value 1, of shape

:formula_3

where &quot;G&quot;(χ) is a Gauss sum formed from χ. This equation has the same function on both sides if and only if χ is a &quot;real character&quot;, taking values in {0,1,−1}. Then ε must be 1 or −1, and the case of the value −1 would imply a zero of &quot;Λ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) at &quot;s&quot; = ½. According to the theory (of Gauss, in effect) of Gauss sums, the value is always 1, so no such &quot;simple&quot; zero can exist (the function is &quot;even&quot; about the point).

== Theory of functional equations ==

A unified theory of such functional equations was given by Erich Hecke, and the theory was taken up again in Tate&#x27;s thesis by John Tate. Hecke found generalised characters of number fields, now called Hecke characters, for which his proof (based on theta functions) also worked. These characters and their associated L-functions are now understood to be strictly related to complex multiplication, as the Dirichlet characters are to cyclotomic fields.

There are also functional equations for the local zeta-functions, arising at a fundamental level for the (analogue of) Poincaré duality in étale cohomology. The Euler products of the Hasse–Weil zeta-function for an algebraic variety &quot;V&quot; over a number field &quot;K&quot;, formed by reducing &quot;modulo&quot; prime ideals to get local zeta-functions, are conjectured to have a &quot;global&quot; functional equation; but this is currently considered out of reach except in special cases. The definition can be read directly out of étale cohomology theory, again; but in general some assumption coming from automorphic representation theory seems required to get the functional equation. The Taniyama–Shimura conjecture was a particular case of this as general theory. By relating the gamma-factor aspect to Hodge theory, and detailed studies of the expected ε factor, the theory as empirical has been brought to quite a refined state, even if proofs are missing.

<doc id="595710" wikidata="Q4978267" url="?curid=595710" title="Bruce Scott (Australian politician)">
<text>Bruce Craig Scott (born 20 October 1943) is an Australian former politician. He was a member of the National Party and represented the Division of Maranoa in the House of Representatives from 1990 to 2016. He served as Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs in the Howard government from 1996 to 2001.

==Early life==
Scott was born in Roma, Queensland, and was educated at the Anglican Church Grammar School in Brisbane. Before entering politics, Scott was a wool and grain grower. He served as president of the Queensland Merino Stud Sheep Breeders Association, president of the Maranoa Graziers&#x27; Association and president of the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders. He was a Nuffield Farming Scholar in 1983.

==Politics==
Scott was first elected to parliament at the 1990 federal election, retaining the Division of Maranoa that has been in Country/National hands for all but three years since 1921, and without interruption since 1943. He was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1992–96. He was Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs from 1996 to 2001, and also Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence from 1998 to 2001.

Following the resignation of Harry Jenkins Jr. as Speaker of the House on 24 November 2011, Scott was nominated for the position of Deputy Speaker of the House by Liberal MP Christopher Pyne. Scott accepted the nomination and a ballot took place, installing Anna Burke as the Deputy Speaker of the House. Following the resignation of Peter Slipper as Speaker on 9 October 2012, Burke was elected as his replacement. Scott was nominated by Pyne as Deputy; with his nomination seconded by Tony Windsor. Scott defeated Steve Georganas in a ballot.

Scott announced on 3 August 2015 that he would not stand in the next election.

<text>51 Nemausa is a large main-belt asteroid that was discovered on January 22, 1858, by Joseph Jean Pierre Laurent. Laurent made the discovery from the private observatory of Benjamin Valz in Nîmes, France. The house, at 32 rue Nationale in Nîmes, has a plaque commemorating the discovery. With Laurent&#x27;s permission, Valz named the asteroid after the Celtic god Nemausus, the patron god and namesake of Nîmes during Roman times.

Based upon its spectrum, this is listed as a C-type asteroid in the Tholen classification taxonomy, and as a Cgh by Bus and Binzel (2002). This indicates a composition similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Absorption features in the spectrum indicate the presence of phyllosilicates. It may have a water content of about 14%.

The first stellar occultation was observed on August 17, 1979, from the Gissar and Alma-Ata observatories produced two chords which were used to estimate a diameter of 150 km for the asteroid.
This is close to the present-day estimate of 147.9 km. Since then 51 Nemausa has been observed 20 times in stellar occultation.

Light curve inversion model DAMIT 1065 is a good match to a seven-chord occultation observed on 3 September 2016, from which an equivalent mean diameter of 146.4 km, and an equivalent Surface mean diameter of 150.3 km was obtained.

Lightcurve data suggests that it may have a small moon. Nemausa has been studied by radar.

<doc id="595716" wikidata="Q423014" url="?curid=595716" title="Stilbite">
<text>Stilbite is the name of a series of tectosilicate minerals of the zeolite group. Prior to 1997, stilbite was recognized as a mineral species, but a reclassification in 1997 by the International Mineralogical Association changed it to a series name, with the mineral species being named:

* Stilbite-Ca
* Stilbite-Na, sometimes also called &quot;stiblite&quot;

Stilbite-Ca, by far the more common of the two, is a hydrous calcium sodium and aluminium silicate, NaCa4(Si27Al9)O72·28(H2O). In the case of stilbite-Na, sodium dominates over calcium. The species are visually indistinguishable, and the series name stilbite is still used whenever testing has not been performed.

== History ==
At one time heulandite and stilbite were considered to be identical minerals. After they were found to be two separate species, in 1818, the name desmine (&quot;a bundle&quot;) was proposed for stilbite, and this name is still employed in Germany. The English name &quot;stilbite&quot; is from the Greek stilbein = to shine, because of the pearly luster of the {010} faces.

== Chemistry and related species ==
Stilbite shows a wide variation in exchangeable cations: silicon and aluminium ions occupy equivalent sites and can substitute for each other. Since silicon and aluminium have a different charge (Si4+ and Al3+) the ions occupying the sodium/calcium site have to adjust to maintain charge balance. There is a continuous series between stellerite, whose formula can be written as Ca4(Si28Al8)O72·28(H2O), and stilbite, and another continuous series between stilbite and barrerite, Na8(Si28Al8)O72·26(H2O).

Epistilbite is a distinct zeolite species unrelated to stilbite.

== Crystal class ==
Stilbite is usually monoclinic 2/m, meaning that it has one twofold axis of rotational symmetry perpendicular to a mirror plane. The twofold axis is the crystal axis b, and the a and c crystal axes lie in the mirror plane. For a monoclinic crystal a and c are inclined to each other at an angle β which is not a right angle. For stilbite β is nearly 130°. Stilbite crystals, however, appear to be almost orthorhombic, and a larger unit cell can be chosen, containing two formula units (Z = 2) such that resembles an orthorhombic cell, with all three crystal axes very nearly mutually perpendicular. The mineral is said to be pseudo-orthorhombic.

Non-endmember forms of stilbite may be triclinic or even truly orthorhombic, indeed the framework can have symmetry ranging from orthorhombic to triclinic in a single crystal.

== Habit ==
Crystals are typically thin tabular, flattened parallel to the dominant cleavage and elongated along the a axis. Aggregates may be sheaf-like or in bow-ties, also fibrous and globular. Twinning, cruciform and penetration, is extremely common on {001}.

== Physical and optical properties ==
The color is usually colorless or white, also yellow, brown, pink, salmon, orange, red, green, blue or black. The luster is generally vitreous, and on the perfect cleavage parallel to the plane of symmetry it is markedly pearly. The streak is white and crystals are transparent to translucent. The hardness is to 4 and the specific gravity 2.12 to 2.22. Cleavage is perfect on {010}, poor on {001}. The mineral is brittle, with a conchoidal or uneven fracture. It is not radioactive.

Stilbite is biaxial (-) with refractive indices:
*Nx = 1.479 to 1.492, Ny = 1.485 to 1.500, Nz = 1.489 to 1.505
*Nx = 1.484 to 1.500, Ny = 1.492 to 1.507, Nz = 1.494 to 1.513

== Unit cell and structure==
Where sources give cell parameters for stilbite-Na, they are the same as those for stilbite-Ca.

The unit cell can be considered as a monoclinic cell with β close to 130° and one formula unit per unit cell (Z = 1), or as a larger pseudo-orthorhombic cell with β close to 90° and Z = 2.
Cell Parameters for the monoclinic cell: 
*a = 13.595 to 13.69 Å, b = 18.197 to 18.31 Å, c = 11.265 to 11.30 Å, β = 127.94 to 128.1°
*a = 13.63 Å, b = 18.17 Å, c = 11.31 Å, β = 129.166°
*a = 13.60 to 13.69 Å, b = 18.20 to 18.31 Å, c = 11.27 Å, β = 128°
Cell parameters for the pseudo-orthorhombic cell:
*a = 13.595 to 13.69 Å, b = 18.197 to 18.31 Å, c = 17.775 to 17.86 Å, β = 90.00 to 90.91°
*a = 13.595 to 13.657 Å, b = 18.197 to 18.309 Å, c = 17.775 to 17.842 Å, β = 90:05 to 90.91° (Z is doubled to Z = 4 because the formula unit halved to NaCa2Al5Si13O36.14H2O)
*a=13.69 Å, b=18.25 Å, c=11.31 Å, β =128.2°
*a = 13.60 to 13.69 Å, b = 18.20 to 18.31 Å, c = 17.78 to 17.86 Å, β = 90.0 to 90.91°

The framework of stilbite is pseudo-orthorhombic with the open channels typical of zeolites. It has 10-member rings and 8-member rings forming channels parallel to a and pseudo-orthorhombic c respectively.

== Uses ==
The open channels in the stilbite structure act like a molecular sieve, enabling it to separate hydrocarbons in the process of petroleum refining.

== Environment ==
Stilbite is a low-temperature secondary hydrothermal mineral. It occurs in the amygdaloidal cavities of basaltic volcanic rocks, in andesites, gneiss and hydrothermal veins. It also forms in hot springs deposits, and as a cementing agent in some sandstones and conglomerates. Stilbite has not been found in sedimentary tuff deposits or deep-sea deposits. Associated minerals are other zeolites, prehnite, calcite and quartz.

== Localities ==
Stilbite is abundant in the volcanic rocks of Iceland, Faroe Islands, Isle of Skye, Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia (where it is the provincial mineral), northern New Jersey and North Carolina. Salmon-pink crystals occur with pale green apophyllite in the Deccan Traps near Mumbai (Bombay) and Pune, India; white sheaf-like groups encrust the calcite (Iceland-spar) of Berufjord near Djupivogr in Iceland; brown sheafs are found near Paterson, New Jersey in the United States; and crystals of a brick-red color are found at Old Kilpatrick, Scotland.

Iceland is generally considered to be the type locality for stilbite-Ca. It is presumed to be the Helgusta Iceland Spar Mine, along Reydarfjordur. Excellent white bow ties of stilbite are found here on calcite and quartz, associated with heulandite and laumontite in cavities.

The type locality for stilbite-Na is Cape Pula, Pula, Cagliari Province, Sardinia, Italy. Small, lustrous, white or pink, pointed blades of stilbite-Na, and formless masses, up to 5 cm in diameter, have been found there, covering a thin crust of reddish heulandite in large fractures and cavities in the highly weathered volcanic andesite or rhyolite.

The Tertiary Deccan basalts of western India are the most prolific sources of stilbite in the world. Stilbite is the most abundant zeolite in the tholeiitic basalt plateaux near Nasik and Pune and decreases in abundance toward the coast at Mumbai.

<text>Patrick Damien &quot;Pat&quot; Secker (born 6 June 1956), Australian politician, was a Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives from October 1998 to August 2013, representing the Division of Barker, South Australia.

==Biography==
Secker was born in Happy Valley, South Australia, and was educated at Flinders University, Adelaide gaining a degree in Economics and Politics. He was a primary producer, small business retailer and company director before entering politics. He was a member of the Meadows District Council 1981-83 and the Mt Barker District Council 1983–92.

Secker was Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives and Deputy Chair of the National Capital and External Territories Joint Standing Committee of Parliament. He was Secretary of the Opposition backbench committee on Agriculture and Infrastructure as well as Chair of the Liberal Party Rural and Regional affairs Committee and a member of the Liberal Party Federal Executive and Federal Council.

Secker was booked by a police officer in April 2006 for tailgating a prime mover. He was accused of travelling half a second behind, Secker pleaded not guilty and asserted that he was travelling five seconds behind. In September 2007 he was found guilty of tailgating a prime mover by the Magistrates Court at Berri in the SA Riverland, given a $450 fine and lost one demerit point. It followed a speeding incident in 2005, at 17 km/h over the limit whilst overtaking a truck. In his defence, Secker stated:

I think I&#x27;m like most people and that&#x27;s why I challenged that ruling is that when you pass a B-double you need to speed up. I think most people still do that on the basis that it&#x27;s safer.

In a Liberal Party pre-selection ballot on 3 March 2012, Secker lost Liberal Party endorsement for the 2013 election to Mount Gambier lawyer Tony Pasin, only receiving 78 votes to his opponent&#x27;s 164 votes.

He made his valedictory speech in parliament on 25 June 2013.

<doc id="595727" wikidata="Q1306701" url="?curid=595727" title="Stephen Kinzer">
<text>Stephen Kinzer (born August 4, 1951) is an American author, journalist, and academic. A former &quot;New York Times&quot; correspondent, he has published several books and writes for several newspapers and news agencies.

==Reporting career==
During the 1980s, Kinzer covered revolutions and social upheaval in Central America and wrote his first book, &quot;Bitter Fruit&quot;, about military coups and destabilization in Guatemala during the 1950s. In 1990, &quot;The New York Times&quot; appointed Kinzer to head its Berlin bureau, from which he covered Eastern and Central Europe as they emerged from the Soviet bloc. Kinzer was &quot;The New York Times&quot; chief in the newly established Istanbul bureau from 1996 to 2000.

Upon returning to the U.S., Kinzer became the newspaper&#x27;s culture correspondent, based in Chicago, as well as teaching at Northwestern University. He then took up residence in Boston and began teaching journalism and U.S. foreign policy at Boston University. He has written several nonfiction books about Turkey, Central America, Iran, and the U.S. overthrow of foreign governments from the late 19th century to the present, as well as Rwanda&#x27;s recovery from genocide.

Kinzer also contributes columns to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. He is a Senior Fellow in International and Public Affairs at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University.

==Views==
Kinzer&#x27;s reporting on Central America was criticized by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky in their book &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; (1988), which cited Edgar Chamorro (&quot;selected by the CIA as press spokesman for the contras&quot;) in his interview by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting describing Kinzer as &quot;just responding to what the White House is saying&quot;. In chapter 2 of &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot;, Kinzer is criticized for deploying no skepticism in his coverage of the murders of GAM leaders in Guatemala and for &quot;generally employing an apologetic framework&quot; for the Guatemalan military state.

Kinzer has since that time criticized interventionist U.S. foreign policy toward Latin America and more recently, the Middle East. In &quot;Overthrow: America&#x27;s Century of Regime Change From Hawaii to Iraq&quot; (2006), he critiqued U.S. foreign policy as overly interventionist. In a 2010 interview with &quot;Imagineer&quot; Magazine, he said:

In his 2008 book &quot;A Thousand Hills: Rwanda&#x27;s Rebirth and the Man who Dreamed It&quot;, Kinzer credits President Paul Kagame for what he calls the peace, development, and stability in Rwanda in the years after the Rwandan genocide, and criticizes Rwanda&#x27;s leaders before the genocide, such as Juvenal Habyarimana. According to Susan M. Thomson, the &quot;book is an exercise in public relations, aimed at further enhancing Kagame&#x27;s stature in the eyes of the west&quot;, is one-sided due to heavy reliance on interviews with Kagame and even apologist.

Kinzer has been criticised for &quot;help[ing] spread Assad&#x27;s propaganda&quot;. In a 2016 opinion piece, Kinzer wrote that Aleppo had been liberated by Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s forces from the violent militants who had ruled it for three years, but that the American public had been told &quot;convoluted nonsense&quot; about the war. He added: &quot;At the recent debate in Milwaukee, Hillary Clinton claimed that United Nations peace efforts in Syria were based on &#x27;an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva.&#x27; The precise opposite is true. In 2012 Secretary of State Clinton joined Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Israel in a successful effort to kill Kofi Annan&#x27;s UN peace plan because it would have accommodated Iran and kept Assad in power, at least temporarily. No one on the Milwaukee stage knew enough to challenge her.&quot; Clinton was referencing the Geneva I Conference on Syria, during which the major powers agreed on principles and guidelines for a power transition.

In April 2018, he added:
Kinzer wrote that the 2018 Syrian Gas Attacks on Civilians in the Douma region was a &quot;false flag&quot; attack, suggesting the event was staged by either al-Qaeda, NATO, or Syrian Civil Defense.

Kinzer has opposed US support for Ukraine in response to the 2014 and 2022 Russian invasions, stating that the war is a proxy war provoked by NATO expansion. Kinzer said in March 2022, after Russia&#x27;s initial invasion, that US provision of arms to Ukraine only &quot;guarantees more suffering and death&quot; and that it &quot;provoke[s] Russia to respond by killing more Ukrainians.&quot; Kinzer believes that &quot;for American strategic planners, this war has little to do with Ukraine. They see it as a battering ram against Russia. Since saving Ukrainian lives is not their priority, they view diplomacy as an enemy.&quot; Kinzer has rejected the &quot;villainous&quot; depiction of Vladimir Putin, stating: &quot;For years, we reveled in our moral superiority over colorful nemeses like Castro, Khadafi, and Saddam Hussein. Putin fits perfectly into this constellation.&quot;

<doc id="595728" wikidata="Q4933930" url="?curid=595728" title="Bob Sercombe">
<text>Robert Charles Grant Sercombe (3 April 1949 – 12 January 2025) was an Australian politician who represented the Division of Maribyrnong, Victoria for the Australian Labor Party from March 1996 until his retirement at the 2007 federal election.

==Life and career==
Sercombe was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and was educated at the University of Melbourne. He was a public servant, social planner, and administrator before entering politics. He was an adviser to Clyde Holding, a former Victorian opposition leader and a minister in the Hawke government from 1983 until 1988. Sercombe was a member of the Essendon City Council in 1983 and 1984. Sercombe was the Member for Niddrie in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1988 until 1996. He was Deputy Leader of the Opposition 1993–94 and a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1992–94.

In State politics, he became well known for supporting a leadership challenge on behalf of Ian Baker who attempted to topple then Leader John Brumby in 1994. After the bid failed, he did not contest the deputy leadership. In the federal Parliament, Sercombe was an Opposition Whip from 1998 until 2001. He was elected to the Opposition Shadow Ministry after the 2004 election and appointed Shadow Minister for Pacific Islands (assisting the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kevin Rudd). His portfolio responsibilities were expanded some time later by Beazley to include Overseas Development. As Shadow Minister, Sercombe put out a series of policy announcements about expanding Australia&#x27;s relationship with that region.

Within the Labor Party, Sercombe was for many years a leading member of the Labor Right in Victoria, although later became allied to the Left faction in Victoria while being a leading light of the Centre caucus in Canberra. Just prior to a local vote of ALP members, in February 2005 Sercombe announced he was withdrawing his candidacy from Labor preselection for his seat of Maribyrnong in favour of Australian Workers&#x27; Union National Secretary Bill Shorten as Shorten had the numbers over Sercombe to win the preselection and Shorten was elected unopposed as a result. He criticised challenges to other incumbent MPs. Despite announcing his retirement Sercombe was kept on the frontbench by Opposition Leader Kim Beazley until December 2006 when he was sacked by new leader Kevin Rudd. Sercombe was an Opposition frontbencher in both the Victorian State and Federal Parliaments but did not become a Minister in either tier of Government. 

Sercombe died on 12 January 2025, at the age of 75.

<text>The Tomb of Shah Jamal () is the tomb of Sufi Saint Baba Shah Jamal. It is located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. It can be located opposite Forman Christian (FC) College, near Muslim Town. There is a masjid built around the tomb which incorporates a graveyard.

==Traditions==
At the foot of the stairs leading up to the tomb, there is a regular gathering of pilgrims, who come every Thursday night and Friday morning, following a tradition that has been going on for hundreds of years. Dhol is played with devotees (dervish or fakir) dancing in a trance also known as &quot;dhamaal&quot;. The drummer Pappu Sain was the central attraction and performed on the dhol.

This performance, every Thursday night/ Friday morning, is attended by people from all walks of life—students, government officials, musicians both domestic and international, models, common folk. It is encouraged that people wear simple, plain clothes and come covered, out of respect for the shrine.
==Annual &quot;urs&quot; festival==
The annual &quot;urs&quot; festival is conducted every year on the 3rd, 4th and 5th days of the Islamic month of Rabi&#x27; al-Thani (ربيع الثاني). In 2006, 300,000 people attended the 366th annual URS (anniversary celebrations) of Shah Jamal (1588-1649).
The present custodian (Sajjada Nasheen) is Dr Pir Syed Ali Hussain Shah Naqvi.

<doc id="595738" wikidata="Q1797842" url="?curid=595738" title="LAGEOS">
<text>LAGEOS (), Laser Geodynamics Satellite or Laser Geometric Environmental Observation Survey, are a series of two scientific research satellites designed to provide an orbiting laser ranging benchmark for geodynamical studies of the Earth. Each satellite is a high-density passive laser reflector in a very stable medium Earth orbit (MEO).

== Function and operation ==
The spacecraft are aluminum-covered brass spheres with diameters of and masses of , covered with 426 cube-corner retroreflectors, giving them the appearance of disco balls. Of these retroreflectors, 422 are made from fused silica glass while the remaining 4 are made from germanium to obtain measurements in the infrared for experimental studies of reflectivity and satellite orientation. They have no on-board sensors or electronics, and are not attitude-controlled.

They orbit at an altitude of , well above low Earth orbit and well below geostationary orbit, at orbital inclinations of 109.8 and 52.6 degrees.

Measurements are made by transmitting pulsed laser beams from Earth ground stations to the satellites. The laser beams then return to Earth after hitting the reflecting surfaces; the travel times are precisely measured, permitting ground stations in different parts of the Earth to measure their separations to better than one inch in thousands of miles.

The LAGEOS satellites make it possible to determine positions of points on the Earth with extremely high accuracy due to the stability of their orbits.
The high mass-to-area ratio and the precise, stable (attitude-independent) geometry of the LAGEOS spacecraft, together with their extremely regular orbits, make these satellites the most precise position references available.

== Mission goals ==
The LAGEOS mission consists of the following key goals:
* Provide an accurate measurement of the satellite&#x27;s position with respect to Earth.
* Determine the planet&#x27;s shape (geoid).
* Determine tectonic plate movements associated with continental drift.

Ground tracking stations located in many countries (including the US, Mexico, France, Germany, Poland, Australia, Egypt, China, Peru, Italy, and Japan) have ranged to the satellites and data from these stations are available worldwide to investigators studying crustal dynamics.

There are two LAGEOS spacecraft, LAGEOS-1 launched in 1976, and LAGEOS-2 launched in 1992. , both LAGEOS spacecraft are routinely tracked by the ILRS network.

== Time capsule ==
LAGEOS-1 (which is predicted to re-enter the atmosphere in 8.4 million years) also contains a 4 in × 7 in plaque designed by Carl Sagan to indicate to future humanity when LAGEOS-1 was launched. The plaque includes the numbers 1 to 10 in binary. In the upper right is a diagram of the Earth orbiting the Sun, with a binary number 1 indicating one revolution, equaling one year. It then shows 268,435,456 years in the past (binary: 228), indicated by a left arrow and the arrangement of the Earth&#x27;s continents at that time (during the Permian period). The present arrangement of the Earth&#x27;s continents is indicated with a 0 and both forward and backward arrows. Then the estimated arrangement of the continents in 8.4 million years with a right facing arrow and 8,388,608 in binary (223). LAGEOS itself is shown at launch on the 0 year, and falling to the Earth in the 8.4 million year diagram.

==Launch data==
* LAGEOS 1, launched 4 May 1976, NSSDC ID 1976-039A, NORAD number 8820
* LAGEOS 2, deployed 23 October 1992 from STS-52, NSSDC ID 1992-070B, NORAD number 22195

<doc id="595740" wikidata="Q7507904" url="?curid=595740" title="Sid Sidebottom">
<text>Peter Sid Sidebottom (born 23 April 1951) is an Australian former politician. Sidebottom was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives, representing the Division of Braddon in Tasmania between 1998 and 2004 and again from the 2007 federal election until his defeat in 2013. In 2011, Sidebottom was appointed the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. He was defeated for a second time at the 2013 election, with a swing of 10% against him.

==Background and early career==
Sidebottom was born in Hobart, Tasmania. He graduated from the University of Tasmania with a Bachelor of Arts (honours); and was a senior secondary college teacher between 1975 and 1997. During 1998, he was an electorate officer for Senator Nick Sherry and again worked for Sherry as an advisor between 2004 and 2007. Sidebottom was elected as a Councillor of the Central Coast Council, serving between 1996 and 1998.

==Political career==
At the 1998 federal election, Sidebottom defeated sitting Liberal Member for Braddon, Chris Miles. However, Sidebottom was defeated by the Liberal candidate, Mark Baker, at the 2004 election. Many put this down to concern about loss of forestry jobs under Labor&#x27;s environment policy, which had the potential to adversely affect Sidebottom&#x27;s electorate.

Sidebottom subsequently won back the seat at the 2007 federal election, defeating Baker.

On 14 December 2011, Sidebottom was appointed the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in the Second Gillard Ministry.

At the 2013 federal election, Sidebottom lost his seat of Braddon for the second time, suffering a 10% swing against him.

<doc id="595742" wikidata="Q157287" url="?curid=595742" title="Galega officinalis">
<text>Galega officinalis, commonly known as galega or goat&#x27;s-rue, is a herbaceous plant in the subfamily Faboideae of the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of northern Africa, western Asia and Europe, but is widely cultivated and naturalised elsewhere. The plant has been extensively cultivated as a forage crop, an ornamental, a bee plant, and as green manure.

&quot;G. officinalis&quot; is rich in galegine, a substance with blood glucose-lowering activity and the foundation for the discovery of metformin, a treatment for managing symptoms of diabetes mellitus. In ancient herbalism, goat&#x27;s-rue was used as a diuretic. It can be poisonous to mammals, but is a food for various insects.

==Etymology==
The English name &quot;goat&#x27;s-rue&quot; is a translation of the Latin &quot;Ruta capraria&quot;, used for the plant in 1554 when it was considered to be related to &quot;Ruta graveolens&quot;, or common rue. The Latin specific epithet &quot;officinalis&quot; refers to plants with some medicinal, culinary or herbal attributes.

&quot;Galega bicolor&quot; is a synonym.

==Distribution and habitat==
Widely distributed throughout temperate regions of the world, predominantly in Europe, the plant is a hardy perennial that blooms in the summer months on grasslands, wetlands, and riverbanks, and is classified as an invasive weed in many parts of North America. It has also been found in South America, North Africa, Pakistan, Turkey, and New Zealand.

In 1891 in the United States, &quot;Galega officinalis&quot; was introduced experimentally at Utah State University for potential use as a forage crop, but escaped cultivation and is now an agricultural pest. As a result, it has been placed on the Federal Noxious Weed List in the United States. It was collected in Colorado, Connecticut and New York prior to the 1930s, and in Maine and Pennsylvania in the 1960s, but the populations appear to have died out.

==Chemistry and herbalism==
Although not thoroughly studied with 21st century methods, &quot;G. officinalis&quot; has been analyzed for its constituents, which include galegine, hydroxygalegine, several guanidine derivatives, such as 4-hydroxygalegine flavones, flavone glycosides, kaempferol, and quercetin. In addition to its purported effect to lower blood glucose levels and induce diuresis, goat&#x27;s rue was used as a herbal tonic in folk medicine practices of medieval Europe to treat bubonic plague, worms, and snake bites.

===Relation to metformin===
Once used in traditional medicine over centuries, &quot;G. officinalis&quot; is at the foundation of the biguanide class of antidiabetic drugs, which also included phenformin and buformin (both discontinued).

&quot;G. officinalis&quot; contains the phytochemicals, galegine and guanidine, both of which decrease blood sugar, but were discovered to cause adverse effects in human studies. The study of galegine and related molecules in the first half of the 20th century led to development of oral antidiabetic drugs. Research on other compounds related to guanidine, including biguanide, led ultimately to the discovery of metformin (trade name, Glucophage), used in the 21st century for management of diabetes by decreasing liver glucose production and increasing insulin sensitivity of body tissues.

===Adverse effects===
Goat&#x27;s rue may interfere with prescribed diabetes drugs, iron absorption, and anticoagulants. It may cause headache or muscular weakness, and its safety during pregnancy or breastfeeding is unknown.

<doc id="595744" wikidata="Q822822" url="?curid=595744" title="Izu Peninsula">
<text>The is a mountainous peninsula with a deeply indented coastline to the west of Tokyo on the Pacific coast of the island of Honshu, Japan, the largest of the four main islands of Japan. Formerly known as Izu Province, Izu peninsula is now a part of Shizuoka Prefecture. The peninsula has an area of and its estimated population in 2005 was 473,942 people. The peninsula&#x27;s populated areas are located primarily on the north and east.

==Geology==

Tectonically, the Izu peninsula results from the Philippine Sea Plate colliding with the Okhotsk Plate at the Nankai Trough. The Philippine Sea Plate, the Amurian Plate, and the Okhotsk Plate meet at Mount Fuji, a triple junction. The peninsula itself lies on the Philippine Sea Plate.

The southern portion of the peninsula is composed largely of breccia, and the central and northern portions consist of numerous highly eroded volcanoes. The Amagi Mountain Range dominates the center of the peninsula with Mount Amagi () and Mount Atami () in the east and Mount Daruma () in the west, with the eastern and western portions of the range extending underwater into Sagami Bay and Suruga Bay. The peninsula&#x27;s major river, the Kano River in the north, flows through a graben valley created by plate tectonics.

As a result of its underlying geology, the peninsula is prone to frequent earthquake swarms and tsunamis, and it abounds in hot springs.

==Administration==
All of Izu Peninsula is within Shizuoka Prefecture. It is administratively divided into eight cities and five towns:

* Atami
* Itō
* Izu
* Izunokuni
* Numazu
* Mishima
* Shimoda
* Kamo District
** Higashiizu
** Kawazu
** Matsuzaki
** Minamiizu
** Nishiizu

==Economics==
A popular resort region for tourists from the Kantō region, the Izu peninsula is primarily known for &quot;onsen&quot; hot spring resorts in Atami, Shuzenji, and Itō. The area is also popular for sea bathing, surfing, golfing and motorcycle touring. The peninsula abuts Mount Fuji and is a part of Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. 

The southwest coast of Izu, from the municipalities of Matsuzaki, Nishiizu and Minamiizu was designated a National Place of Scenic Beauty in 1937.

Aside from tourism, agriculture and fishing are the mainstays of the local economy. Izu is one of the biggest producers of &quot;wasabi&quot; in Japan, and the local cuisine offers dishes flavored with &quot;wasabi&quot;. Nevertheless, these industries are not lucrative enough to prevent a heavy loss of population to Greater Tokyo and Shizuoka, particularly among the young.

==Access==

===Railway===

The northern parts of Izu peninsula is easily accessible from Tokyo and points west via the Tōkaidō Shinkansen, which has stations in both Atami in the northeast and Mishima in the northwest. JR Itō Line and the Izu Kyūkō Line provides service along the east coast of the peninsula to Shimoda, however given the lack of population, these services are less regular.

Central Izu is served by the Sunzu Line as far as Shuzenji. The west coast of the peninsula is less developed, and has no train service.

===Roadway===
Izu Peninsula is served by numerous expressways. By car, it is from the Yōga Interchange (用賀インター &quot;Yōga Intā&quot;) on the Tokyo end of the Tōmei Expressway to Numazu.
To get to the eastern side, a branch at Atsugi leads to the Odawara-Atsugi Road, which continues past Odawara to Yugawara, Atami, and Shimoda. Izu Peninsula is also served by Japan National Route 135, Japan National Route 136, and Japan National Route 414. Izu also offers two scenic roads, called &quot;Izu Skyline&quot; (伊豆スカイライン) and &quot;Western Izu Skyline&quot; (西伊豆スカイライン) that offer beautiful views on nature and Mt. Fuji. Both skyline roads are favorite spots of car and motorcycle enthusiasts.

The Odakyu Electric Railway runs local bus services from Odawara and Hakone, and there is an extensive but infrequent internal bus network.

===Airway===
On August 12, 1985, Flight JAL 123, while crossing peninsular airspace, experienced an explosion in the aft pressure bulkhead, resulting in an accident that killed 520 people, becoming one of the deadliest air disasters in human history.

<doc id="595750" wikidata="Q239508" url="?curid=595750" title="Alek Wek">
<text>Alek Wek (born 16 April 1977) is a South Sudanese-British model and designer who began her fashion career at the age of 18 in 1995. She has been hailed for her influence on the perception of beauty in the fashion industry. She is from the Dinka ethnic group in South Sudan, but fled to Britain in 1991 to escape the civil war in Sudan. In 2015, she was listed as one of BBC&#x27;s 100 Women.

== Early life ==
Alek was born April 16, 1977, and she was born in Wau, Sudan (now South Sudan), in a two-bedroom house without electricity or running water, and is the seventh of nine children. Her mother Akuol (b. 1946) was a housewife, and her father Athian (1933–1985) was an education official. Her name reportedly means &quot;Black Spotted Cow&quot;.

When the civil war broke out in Wau in 1985, the Wek family had to flee from both rebel and government forces. Her father, Athian, once broke his hip in a bicycle accident, and his hip was repaired with metal pins. Long periods of walking caused Athian&#x27;s hip to get infected, and upon the family&#x27;s return to Wau, he became paralysed and endured a haemorrhage. He died at a relative&#x27;s home in Khartoum.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
After arriving in London at age 14, Alek&#x27;s psoriasis immediately cleared. She enrolled in the London College of Fashion and studied Fashion Business and Technology.

Alek was discovered at an outdoor market in 1995 in Crystal Palace, London by a Models 1 scout. She appeared in the music video for &quot;GoldenEye&quot; by Tina Turner that year, and shortly thereafter began fashion modeling. She was signed to Ford Models in 1996 and also appeared in the &quot;Got &#x27;Til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; music video by Janet Jackson that year. She was named &quot;Model of the Year&quot; in 1997 by MTV, and was the first African model to appear on the cover of &quot;Elle&quot; that year.

===Modelling===
Alek has modelled for many notable fashion houses. She has appeared on the cover of American, French, German and South African &quot;Elle&quot; as well as &quot;i-D&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Forbes Magazine Africa&quot; and &quot;Ebony&quot;. She has also been featured in editorials in American and British &quot;Vogue&quot;. In 2002 she made her acting debut in &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; as Sudanese princess Aquol. Herb Ritts photographed her for a 1999 calendar in a Joanne Gair body painting that was a highlight of Gair&#x27;s first retrospective.

In September 2015, Alek walked for Marc Jacobs at Spring/Summer 2016 New York Fashion Week, later appearing in the label&#x27;s Spring Summer 2016 campaign. In May 2016, she modelled for four special edition covers of Brazilian &quot;Elle&quot;.

===Image===
Dark-skinned models were rare, if not unheard of, in the high fashion industry. As a result, Alek&#x27;s mainstream success was celebrated by black women all over the world. Oprah Winfrey commented that &quot;if Alek had been on the cover of a magazine when I was growing up, I would have had a different concept of who I was.&quot; In a speech on beauty and self-perception, Kenyan-Mexican actress Lupita Nyong&#x27;o stated that she had been a self-conscious, insecure teenager before seeing Alek in the spotlight: &quot;When I saw Alek, I inadvertently saw a reflection of myself that I could not deny. Now, I had a spring in my step because I felt more seen, more appreciated by the far-away gatekeepers of beauty&quot;.

===Designing===
Alek also designs a range of designer handbags called &quot;Wek 1933&quot;, which are available throughout selected Selfridges department stores. The name refers to the year her father was born. Her inspiration for the designs came from the brass-clasp briefcase carried by her father.

==Campaigning==
Since 2002, Alek has been an advisor to the U.S. Committee for Refugees Advisory Council, which helps to raise awareness about the situation in Sudan, as well as the plight of refugees worldwide.

She is a missionary for World Vision, an organisation which combats AIDS, an ambassador for Doctors Without Borders in Sudan, and devotes time to UNICEF.

In 2007, she released an autobiography, entitled &quot;Alek: From Sudanese Refugee to International Supermodel&quot;, documenting her journey from a childhood of poverty in Sudan to the catwalks of Europe.

In 2011, she appeared as a guest judge in the sixteenth cycle of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;.

In July 2012, she returned to South Sudan with the UN Refugee Agency to highlight the stories of refugees returning from the north and the massive efforts needed to build and stabilise the country. In 2012, Alek teamed up with Amarula as the face of their campaign African Originals.

==Personal life==
As of 2009, Wek resided in Brooklyn, New York. She was in a relationship with Riccardo Sala, an Italian real estate developer, for twelve years; they separated in 2013. She is the aunt of the runway model Ataui Deng.

<doc id="595755" wikidata="Q998623" url="?curid=595755" title="Sado Island">
<text>is an island located in the eastern part of the Sea of Japan, under the jurisdiction of Sado City, Niigata Prefecture, Japan, with a coastline of . In October 2017, Sado Island had a population of 55,212 people. Sado Island covers an area of , and is the second largest island after Okinawa Island outside of the four main islands of Japan, excluding the disputed Southern Kurils. The shortest distance between Sado Island and Honshu is . The highest peak on Sado Island is Mount Kinpoku, with an elevation of .

== Geography ==
The shape of Sado Island resembles the kanji character for ‘work’ (工) in Japanese or the letter ‘S’. The topography of the island can be roughly divided into three parts, the Ōsado range in the north, the Kosado range in the south, and the Kakakura plain with flat terrain in between. The Ōsado range area is higher in altitude, and the highest peak of Sado Island, Mount Kinpoku ( above sea level), is also located in this area. The coastline on the north side of Mount Sado is steep, and is a famous tourist spot, among which the Senkaku Bay is the most famous. The Kosado range has a relatively flatter terrain with Satsuma orange and tea trees growing there. Its highest peak is Mount Ōjiyama, with an elevation of . The Nakakura Plain is a large plain in Japan&#x27;s outlying islands and is also the agricultural area of Sado Island. On the west side of the Kuninaka Plain is Mano Bay, and on the east side is Ryōtsu Bay. The Kokufugawa River (also reads Konogawa River) flows through the Kuninaka Plain, with a total length of , and flows into Mano Bay. Its watershed area accounts for 20% of Sado Island. Lake Kamo, the largest lake in Niigata Prefecture, is located at the eastern end of the Kuninaka Plain. Lake Kamo was originally a freshwater lake, and later turned into a lagoon after an opening built to the Sea of Japan. Oyster breeding flourishes in the lake. Part of Sado Island belongs to the Sado-Yahiko-Yoneyama Quasi-National Park.

=== Weather and climate ===
Affected by the warm Black Current that passes through the Sado waters, the winter in Sado Island is warmer than that in Niigata Prefecture and with less snow. In summer, due to the influence of ocean, the temperature difference between day and night is smaller than that of Niigata Prefecture, and is cooler than that of Niigata Prefecture. However, the Aikawa area on the northwestern side of the Ōsado range are affected by the monsoon blowing from the northwest and the temperature is higher. Precipitation on Sado Island is mainly concentrated in the end of the East Asian rainy season and early winter, and there is less precipitation than in Niigata Prefecture. When the low air pressure and typhoons pass through the Sea of Japan, Sado Island often suffers from Foehn wind, raising the temperature sharply. Located at the junction of the warm and cold current, Sado City enjoys diverse plants and rich aquatic resources.


== Flora and fauna ==
Because it is located at the junction of warm and cold currents, it is extremely rich in vegetation, making it an extremely rare vegetation area on the island where plants unique to both Hokkaido and Okinawa coexist. It is also blessed with a variety of marine products, such as dolphinfish, bonito, and bigfin squid that appear in warm currents, and yellowtail that appears in cold currents.

Due to the hundreds of thousands of years that have passed since it was isolated from Honshu island, endemic species such as the Sad hare, Sad mole, and Sad shrew can be seen. Although they are now extinct, there was a population of wild boars that was genetically separated from the population of Honshu for hundreds of thousands of years. The Japanese weasel is said to have been re-introduced after becoming locally extinct.

== History ==
Sado Island was originally connected to Honshu, but it separated from Honshu around 16 million years ago due to changes in the topography due to tectonic deformation and volcanic activity, and around 2 million years ago, the ground began to collapse due to compressive kinetic energy in the ocean floor. It is thought that the area rose to its current shape, with the Osado Mountains and Kosado Hills sandwiching the Kuninaka Plain. Uplift continues to this day due to tectonic movements such as earthquakes.

With a long history, Sado Island has been inhabited by humans for 10,000 years. Thousands of ruins discovered in the Kanai area included stoneware and hunting equipment from the late Yayoi period. There are also records of Sado in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihongi&quot;. After the Taika Reform, the central government established the Sado Province on the island, and the local population began to emigrate to Sado Island. At the same time, Sado Island has also become the place where losers of political conflicts or dissidents were exiled. Emperor Juntoku, Nichiren and other people had been exiled to Sado. After the Kamakura period, the Honma clan was appointed as the Shugodai. After 1589 ( Tenshō 17), Uesugi Kagekatsu invaded Sado Island, after which Sado Island was dominated by the Uesugi clan.

In 1601, miners discovered veins of gold and silver in the Aikawa Tsuruko Ginzan, which became the Sado Mine. In 1603 (Keichō 8), Tokugawa Ieyasu classified Sado Island as a territory of the Bakufu immediately after his victory at the Battle of Sekigahara. Sado Mine developed into the largest goldmine in Japan. Its output reached 41 tons by the Bakumatsu period in the mid-19th century, and it played an important role in the financing of the Shogunate. After the middle of the Edo period, the quantity began to decrease, but output rose to the highest level ever, at 400 kg a year, thanks to the introduction of advanced excavation technology during the Meiji era in the late 19th century. Sado Gold Mine closed in 1989. In nearly 400 years of mining history, it produced 78 tons of gold and 2,300 tons of silver.

After the abolition of the &quot;han&quot; system, the Japanese government established Sado Prefecture on Sado Island, but later renamed it Aikawa Prefecture. In 1876, Aikawa Prefecture was incorporated into Niigata Prefecture. In 2004, ten cities, towns and villages on Sado Island were merged to form Sado City.

=== Forced labor ===

Sado Island was the site of forced labor during World War II, when around 1,500 Koreans were conscripted and forced to work in the mines on the island. The Japanese government, some Japanese scholars, and a minority of international scholars oppose this claim. Koreans are even mentioned in an exhibit in one of the mines, but there is no implication that they were forced to work there.

In 2022, this became the subject of a diplomatic conflict between South Korea and Japan. Japan had previously added Hashima Island, another island where forced labor occurred (which Japan denies), to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list. However, the nomination was only approved because South Korea and Japan had reached a deal where Japan would acknowledge forced labor in its exhibits. Japan, under the guidance of Japanese politician and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, went back on its word and created a museum denying that forced labor occurred on Hashima. All other 21 nations of the UNESCO committee agreed that Japan had failed to reach its side of the agreement, but Japan ignored requests to correct the museum. It subsequently filed to have Sado Island added to the list as well, which sparked international and domestic criticism. This request was initially denied due to concerns over how the island&#x27;s history would be presented. Japan refiled the request on 28 January 2023, with the goal of being added to the list by 2024. 

Various sources expressed skepticism on whether the bid would be successful. However, on 27 July 2024, the UNESCO committee unanimously decided to register the Sado Island Gold Mines as a cultural heritage site. The bid gained the support of South Korea following bilateral negotiations between the two countries. The Japanese government established an exhibit about the harsh working conditions, and promised to hold an annual memorial. Additionally, a representative for the Japanese government told the committee that Japan would make efforts to &quot;comprehensively address the whole history of the Sado Island Gold Mines&quot; in consultation with South Korea. The listing has been described as an improvement in Japan-South Korea relations, although it has been met with criticism in South Korea. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol&#x27;s friendlier position to Japan has been analyzed in the context of the approval.

== Population ==
In 1960, Sado Island had a population of 113,296. Due to the inconvenience of living on the outlying islands and lack of jobs, Sado Island has experienced a long-term population decline. In October 2017, the population of Sado Island was 55,212. The total fertility rate of Sado Island is about 1.9, which is much higher than the average of Japan and Niigata Prefecture. However, the continuous outflow of population results in the persistent decrease of population.

== Culture ==

Since Sado Island is an important trading base on the Nishimawari naval route from the coast of the Japan Sea to Osaka, the culture is strongly influenced by West Japanese culture like Kinki and Hokuriku. Intellectuals and politicians exiled from Kyoto to Sado brought the traditional performance culture of Kyoto, which caused the traditional art of Sado Island to began to thrive. The Noh Master Zeami Motokiyo was exiled to Sado, resulting in the particular development of Noh culture in Sado. In the Edo period, there were more than 200 Noh stages. Sado still has more than 30 Noh stages - ranking first in Japan in the number of Noh stages per capita. There are also local performing arts such as ‘Ghost Taiko’ on Sado Island.

Sado is also home to the Kodō taiko drumming troupe. Kodō are credited with popularizing modern taiko drumming both in Japan and worldwide. Kodō Village is based in the Ogi subdivision.

The round coracle-like Tarai-bune boats were once common in different parts of Japan, but are now only found on Sado.

<doc id="595758" wikidata="Q2154562" url="?curid=595758" title="Middlesbrough Ironopolis F.C.">
<text>Middlesbrough Ironopolis Football Club was a football club based in Middlesbrough, England.

Although it was only in existence for five years, the club won three Northern League titles and two cup competitions, and once reached the FA Cup quarter-finals.

==History==

The club was formed in 1889 by some members of Middlesbrough F.C., an amateur club at the time, who wanted the town of Middlesbrough to have a professional club, as the original stayed amateur; however, once Ironopolis turned professional, Middlesbrough followed suit within a week. The team played its first ever game against Gainsborough Trinity on 14 December 1889 at home, having recruited a squad of professionals mostly from Scottish clubs, including four from Arthurlie, three from Dundee clubs Harp and Strathmore, and retaining some from Middlesbrough. The match ended in a 1–1 draw, T. Seymour scoring the new club&#x27;s first goal, an equalizer just before the break.

===League and Cup===
Middlesbrough Ironopolis played in the Northern League from 1890 to 1893, winning three consecutive titles. In their first season, they reached the Fourth Qualifying Round of the FA Cup, losing to Darlington.

Both the Washers and Middlesbrough came to realise their only real chance of gaining promotion to the Football League was through a reunion of the two teams. On 7 May 1892, after a meeting between the two clubs, an application to join the Football League was made under the name Middlesbrough and Ironopolis Football and Athletic Club. The club received only one vote in its application to join the First Division, and did not enter the vote to join the Football League Second Division, so the two original clubs split up once more. The next season, Ironpolis had its best run in the FA Cup, losing to Preston North End in a quarter-final replay; in the original game, at the Paradise Ground, Preston played the second half with ten men due to injury, and McArthur scored a late equalizer for the home side to send the game into extra time, which could not split the sides.

Ironopolis applied to join the Second Division for the 1893–94 season, and was originally unsuccessful in the vote; however, in August 1893, Accrington resigned, and Ironpolis was invited to take its place. Competing in the league alongside them were Liverpool, Newcastle United, and Woolwich Arsenal (now known simply as Arsenal). Ironopolis finished 11th out of 15 clubs, recording wins against Small Heath (now Birmingham City), 3–0, and over Ardwick (now Manchester City) 2–0. They played in total 28 games, won 8, drew 4, lost 16, scored 37 goals, conceded 72, and finished with 20 points. The squad that season was: G. Watts; J. Elliott, Philip Bach; Thomas Seymour, Robert Chatt, R. Nicholson; J. Hill, Archibald M. Hughes, Thomas McCairns, P. Coupar, Wallace McReddie.

The club lost its stadium, the Paradise Ground, which was adjacent to Middlesbrough F.C.&#x27;s Ayresome Park, at the end of the season. Its financial position was poor, as gate receipts did not cover the cost of players&#x27; wages and the costs of travelling to fixtures in distant parts of England. In February 1894 all the professional players were served notice of the plans to liquidate the team. The club&#x27;s final game was a 1–1 draw against South Bank on 30 April 1894. Ironopolis resigned from the Football League the following month and disbanded. Ironopolis and Bootle are the only two clubs to have spent a single season in the Football League.

==Seasons==
==Name and colours==
The club was formed during the late Victorian industrial boom and adopted the name &quot;Ironopolis&quot; (iron-city) partly to emphasise this (Middlesbrough was then a centre for iron and steel production; see Teesside Steelworks) and also to distinguish itself from the other local club, Middlesbrough F.C.

The club had three sets of colours in its brief history; initially a cardinal and green kit jersey, which had been Middlesbrough&#x27;s colours in 1885–86. In 1891 it changed to cherry and white stripes (the racing colours of Alderman Weighell, who presented the club with its new shirts), and in 1893 altered the design to cherry with a white sash.

==Ground==

The club played at the Paradise Ground, a former rugby union pitch on Linthorpe Road, next to Ayresome Park; indeed part of the latter was later built over a corner of the Paradise pitch.

<doc id="595759" wikidata="Q7176978" url="?curid=595759" title="Peter Slipper">
<text>Peter Neil Slipper (born 14 February 1950) is an Australian former politician and bishop who served as the 27th speaker of the Australian House of Representatives from 2011 to 2012. A member of the Liberal Party of Australia for most of his career, he was the member of parliament (MP) for the division of Fisher from 1984 to 1987 and again from 1993 to 2013. He is the current bishop in Australia for the Catholic Apostolic Church of Australia (ICAB) a mission of the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church (&quot;Igreja Católica Apostólica Brasileira&quot;) and an honorary consul for Brazil in Australia.

Slipper is originally from Ipswich, Queensland, and studied arts and law at the University of Queensland. He worked as a lawyer and farmer before entering politics. Slipper was first elected to parliament at the age of 34, standing as a member of the National Party. He was narrowly defeated after one term, but reclaimed the seat at the 1993 election as a member of the Liberal Party. During the Howard government, he served as a government whip and a member of the ministry as a parliamentary secretary now designated as assistant ministers.

After the 2010 election, Slipper fell out with some of his Coalition colleagues over failed earlier moves to disendorse him prior to the election. However all members of the Liberal National Party of Queensland were assured of endorsement following the merger of the Liberal and National Parties in that state. He was elected Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives in September 2010, with the backing of the Labor Party. In November 2011, he was elected Speaker of the House in place of Labor&#x27;s Harry Jenkins, who unexpectedly resigned thereby giving the Labor minority government an additional number on the floor. Slipper resigned from the Liberal National Party to become an independent speaker in the Westminster tradition upon taking office, pre-empting moves to expel him. He was the first independent to serve as speaker since Frederick Holder (1901–1909).

In April 2012, Slipper took a leave of absence from the speakership in order to deal with an Australian Federal Police investigation into his alleged misuse of Cabcharge vouchers, as well as sexual harassment allegations from a former staffer, James Ashby. He eventually formally resigned in October 2012; he was unsuccessful in his bid to be re-elected as an independent at the 2013 federal election. Slipper was convicted of defrauding the government in July 2014, but successfully appealed the charges and had his conviction overturned in February 2015. Ashby dropped his sexual harassment lawsuit in June 2014 with his case having been earlier dismissed as an abuse of process by Justice Steven Rares of the Federal Court of Australia.

In 2017, he was consecrated as Bishop in Australia by the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church and having been instrumental in having a Continuing Anglican church, the Church of Torres Strait, to apply to join it. He had previously assisted the Church of Torres Strait in native title and other legal and administrative matters.

==Early life==
Slipper was born on 14 February 1950 in Ipswich, Queensland. He is the son of Joan and Stanley Slipper; his father was a mechanical engineer/manager with Queensland Railways.

Slipper attended school in Townsville before completing his secondary education at Ipswich Grammar School. He subsequently studied law and arts at the University of Queensland, graduating Bachelor of Laws in 1977 and later as Bachelor of Arts. He subsequently worked as a solicitor and also had business and farming interests.

==Politics==
Having joined the Young National Party, Slipper was the National Party&#x27;s campaign director in the Electoral District of Ipswich West in the 1974 State Election and in the Division of Oxley at the 1975 federal election. He was state president of the Young Nationals.

Slipper first won Fisher as a National Party candidate in 1984. The once safely conservative seat had become somewhat more marginal after a redistribution pushed the seat into the outer suburbs of Brisbane. During his first term, Slipper was a staunch supporter of the &quot;Joh for Canberra&quot; campaign. He was narrowly defeated in 1987 by Labor&#x27;s Michael Lavarch. However, a redistribution in 1993 made Fisher notionally Liberal; the Liberals had taken second place in the seat three years earlier. Slipper sought to retake his old seat, this time as a Liberal, and won.

Slipper was government whip from 1997 to 1998, parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration from 1998 to 2004 and parliamentary secretary to the prime minister from 2002 to 2003.

In both government and opposition, Slipper served on a number of parliamentary committees including the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, where he was chairman (2004 to 2007), deputy chairman (2007 to 2010), the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Standing Committees on Family and Community Affairs where he was chairman (1996 to 1997), the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Privileges and the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.

===Alleged abuse of travel entitlements===
In 2010 Slipper drew significant local and national media attention over the alleged overuse of his parliamentary travel entitlements. Slipper denied any claim of abuse and it was reported in the local newspaper, &quot;Sunshine Coast Daily&quot;, that &quot;... (Slipper had said) nearly every incident was a consequence of either a misunderstanding or a disputable interpretation of the rules.&quot; The Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, initially backed Slipper, perhaps due to the fact that Slipper had voted for Abbott for the Liberal leadership in December 2009 which Abbott had won by one vote, but later publicly stated that it was up to each member to adhere to the rules regarding entitlements.

Slipper has said that he has been cleared of these allegations.

===Attempted disendorsement===
On 14 August 2010, just as the travel abuse allegations were gaining momentum, it was revealed in the &quot;Sunshine Coast Daily&quot; that a move had been made to attempt to disendorse Slipper in favour of former MP Mal Brough for his seat of Fisher at the next election. However, this move was rejected due to an agreement between the Liberal and National parties about guaranteed endorsement for existing candidates.

By this time, it became apparent that Slipper would lose his LNP endorsement for the next election. With this in mind, Labor believed that Slipper was a potential &quot;weak link&quot; in the Coalition, and sought to use him to bolster its parliamentary standing. On 28 September 2010, Slipper accepted Labor&#x27;s nomination to serve as Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives and was elected to that position by 78 votes to 71, defeating the Coalition nominee, Bruce Scott of the National Party. In December 2010, Brough confirmed his intention to seek preselection, by running against Slipper.

Concerned about the damage to the LNP&#x27;s reputation in the electorate, in March 2011 a motion was moved at the party&#x27;s Federal Divisional Council &quot;that this Council notes the actions of the Member for Fisher in accepting nomination by the Labor Party for the position of Deputy Speaker and competing for this position in opposition to Mr Bruce Scott MP nominated for this position by the coalition parties and expresses its concern over the ongoing negative publicity directed at the Member for Fisher and the resulting damage to the Liberal National Party and requests the Applicant Review Committee to take note and take action as deemed appropriate&quot;. According to media reports, the matter was deferred without discussion to the party&#x27;s state director.

In September 2011, Slipper raised concerns of alleged branch stacking by Brough, and there was growing pressure over how the LNP would determine preselection of candidates for the seat of Fisher, with Slipper threatening to resign from the party if not re-endorsed.

==Speaker of the House of Representatives==
In November 2011, Harry Jenkins, a member of the Australian Labor Party, unexpectedly resigned as 26th Speaker of the House of Representatives. Slipper was nominated unopposed and installed as Speaker on 24 November 2011. As a member of the opposition, Slipper&#x27;s acceptance of Labor&#x27;s nomination as Speaker was considered a &quot;renegade&quot; action and opposition leader Tony Abbott threatened to expel him from the Liberal Party for his action. Slipper resigned from the Liberal National Party on taking the Speaker&#x27;s seat and continued in parliament as an independent representative.

Upon his election as speaker, Slipper moved to restore various traditions of the office of speaker. Most notably, Slipper took to wearing the traditional gown and bar jacket over his business attire. He also moved to reinstate once weekly the longer and more formal Speaker&#x27;s procession into the House involving the Serjeant-at-Arms and the Mace, which had not been seen in three decades. This meant the Speaker&#x27;s Procession once a week processed briefly through parts of Parliament House open to the public. During his first formal procession into parliament, Slipper wore a gown, bar jacket, and a white bow tie with white bands. This degree of formality occurred only once a week; on other occasions Slipper donned less formal attire which he described as a blend of tradition and modernity. Slipper soon established a no-nonsense reputation; during his first Question Time, he expelled four of his former Coalition colleagues without warning.

===Sexual harassment and further expenses allegations===
On 20 April 2012, Slipper was accused of misusing Cabcharge vouchers. These allegations were then investigated by the Australian Federal Police, with a summons issued in January 2013 in relation to matters unconnected with the James Ashby allegations which were later withdrawn by Ashby. He was also accused of sexually harassing James Ashby who was a member of his staff. Ashby, a 33-year-old gay man, alleged that Slipper sexually harassed him on a number of occasions, via mobile phone text messages and in private conversations. A sexual harassment case regarding these allegations was dismissed by the Federal Court on 12 December 2012, after Slipper argued that the charges were &quot;vexatious and an abuse of the legal process&quot;.

The Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott, and other senior Opposition figures such as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Eric Abetz, called for Slipper to resign until Ashby&#x27;s claims were investigated. The Government said it was a legal matter and that they would not be asking for Slipper&#x27;s resignation. However, in April 2012, Slipper briefly stepped aside from the speakership, resumed the position shortly afterwards, but announced to the House in May that he would not take the chair in the House for the time being (and therefore not enter the chamber of the House as Speaker), while investigations into the alleged travel-related misconduct were conducted. The Coalition, as well as Rob Oakeshott, Andrew Wilkie and Tony Windsor, called on Slipper to continue to stand aside pending a resolution of the sexual harassment claims.

On 27 April 2012, Slipper released copies of Cabcharge documents for at least two of the dates in question (a third group of documents contained illegible dates) along with a written statement saying they were clearly in his handwriting, therefore disproving the allegation he handed over blanks. The Government agreed, but various questions about the documents, including whether the payments were inflated and even whether Slipper signed them all, were raised in the media. Julia Gillard announced on 29 April 2012 that she had spoken to Slipper and he had agreed to stay away from the House for &quot;a further period&quot;.

On 8 May 2012, Slipper resumed the chair as Speaker and read out a statement denying the allegations against him. He then formally requested that the Deputy Speaker, Anna Burke, take the chair in his absence.

Federal Court Justice Steven Rares dismissed the sexual harassment charges against Slipper in December 2012, saying that he had &quot;reached the firm conclusion that Mr Ashby&#x27;s predominant purpose for bringing these proceedings was to pursue a political attack against Mr Slipper and not to vindicate any legal claim he may have for which the right to bring proceedings exists.&quot; However, in February 2014 Ashby successfully appealed against the decision to dismiss the case. Ashby abandoned his lawsuit against Slipper in June 2014.

On 8 January 2013 the federal police summonsed Slipper alleging three offenses against in relation to allegations concerning the use of Cabcharge vouchers. Slipper was due to answer these allegations in the ACT Magistrates Court on 15 February 2013. According to documents released by the court, Slipper was alleged to have used Cabcharge to pay for hire cars to visit a number of wineries in the Canberra region in January, April, and June 2010.

On 28 July 2014, Slipper was found guilty of dishonestly using taxpayer funds to visit Canberra wineries for his own enjoyment. On 24 September 2014, he was sentenced to 300 hours community service and ordered to reimburse taxpayers for the $954 total that was spent on the trips. Slipper appealed the sentence, and the case was heard in December 2014. Justice John Burns reserved his decision until 26 February 2015, when he ruled the appeal be upheld and the conviction and sentence be set aside.

===Resignation as Speaker of the House===
Slipper announced his resignation in Parliament on 9 October 2012. Earlier in the day a motion of no confidence was defeated by one vote (69/70). However, key independent members Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott, despite voting against the earlier no confidence motion, later informed Slipper that they could not continue to support him as Speaker given the damning text messages. Slipper later entered Parliament and, when announcing his resignation, said:
He then moved to the crossbench as an independent member of the House.

On 11 May 2013, he apparently joined the Palmer United Party, also known as the (revived) United Australia Party. This situation was short-lived; just hours after announcing his membership had been accepted, the party released a statement on its website announcing members had decided to revoke Slipper&#x27;s membership under clause D26 of the constitution of the party. Slipper, however, claimed that he had withdrawn his application for membership after finding out that the party had announced without his knowledge that he was joining.

Slipper stood as an independent candidate in the Division of Fisher at the 2013 federal election, but his replacement as LNP candidate, Mal Brough, won the seat resoundingly. Brough subsequently faced a Federal Police investigation in relation his role concerning the theft of the Speaker&#x27;s diary and announced he would not contest the following election.

==Religion==
In 2008, Slipper was ordained as a priest of the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia, a member church of the Traditional Anglican Communion (TAC) and considered part of the international Continuing Anglican movement. He was ordained by Archbishop John Hepworth and served as chancellor. The ordination was controversial to some as Slipper has no formal theological training and he was ordained without the knowledge of the wider TAC clergy. He was also the chancellor of the TAC, having succeeded Michael Atkinson, but resigned from this position in August 2012.

Slipper was made chancellor and later vicar-general of the Church of Torres Strait, a then member church of the Traditional Anglican Communion which had signed an agreement to enter into the Roman Catholic Church as part of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross (OLSC), though that agreement never came to fruition. In 2016, Slipper travelled to Brazil to be ordained as a deacon and priest and was instrumental in the CTS applying to join the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church (ICAB) in a unanimous vote of its synod in that year.

==Personal life==
Slipper married Lyn Hooper in 1981. Her father Max Hooper was a Queensland state government minister. The couple had two children before divorcing in 2001. In 2006, Slipper married Inge Hall at a high-profile ceremony attended by many of his parliamentary colleagues.

<text>Waris Dirie (; born 21 October 1965) is a Somali model, author, actress and human rights activist in the fight against female genital mutilation (FGM). From 1997 to 2003, she was a UN special ambassador against FGM. In 2002 she founded her own organization in Vienna, the Desert Flower Foundation. She has won numerous awards recognizing her work on eradicating FGM, including the Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur (2007).

Born in Somalia, she moved to London where she began her modeling career. She was a model for top brands such as Chanel, Levi&#x27;s, L&#x27;Oréal and Revlon. As a model, Dirie was the first black woman to appear in an Oil of Olay advertisement. In 1987, Dirie played a minor role in the James Bond film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;.

In 1997, at the height of her modeling career, Dirie spoke publicly for the first time with the women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Marie Claire&quot; about the FGM that she had undergone as a child, and would become a UN special ambassador against FGM that same year. She has created a platform for raising awareness about FGM that includes numerous foundations, campaigns, books, and documentaries. Her first book, &quot;Desert Flower&quot; (1998), is an autobiography that went on to become an international bestseller, selling over 11 million copies worldwide, and inspired the film &quot;Desert Flower&quot; (2009). She created two foundations: Desert Flower Foundation, an organisation whose goal is to eradicate female genital mutilation worldwide, and the Desert Dawn Foundation, which raises money for schools and clinics in her native Somalia.

==Early life==
Dirie was born as one of twelve children into a nomadic family in 1965 in the area of Galkayo. Her first name, &quot;Waris&quot;, means &quot;desert flower&quot;.

In her autobiography, Dirie explained how as a four-year-old, she was raped by her cousin. After the rape took place, Dirie underwent an infibulation procedure to remove her labia and suture her vulva, following cultural ideals of purity (&quot;taharah&quot;) and shame (&quot;ebwaye&quot;). Describing the procedure, Dirie said that she was blindfolded but allowed to experience the procedure with her other senses: &quot;It&#x27;s like somebody is slicing through the meat of your thigh, or cutting off your arm, except this is the most sensitive part of your body&quot;. She also described herself fainting and having an out-of-body experience.

At the age of thirteen, she fled through the desert to Mogadishu in order to escape an arranged marriage to a 60-year-old man. She first stayed there with relatives, although her escape was not tolerated.

One of her uncles, who was then the Somali ambassador to the United Kingdom, was looking for a maid. With the help of her aunt, she convinced her uncle to hire her and take her to London, where she worked at her uncle&#x27;s house for little pay. After her uncle&#x27;s four-year term, Dirie left and lived in a number of unstable housing arrangements, later renting a room in a YMCA. She earned her living as a cleaner in a local McDonald&#x27;s. She also began evening classes to learn English.

==Career==
===Modeling success===
Aged 18, Dirie was by chance discovered by photographer Mike Goss, as she stood waiting for her charge outside of his daughter&#x27;s school. Through getting the children to translate for them, Goss persuaded Dirie to model for him. Afterwards, he helped her get a portfolio together and get her representation, although a lot of modelling agencies claimed there was &#x27;no call for black models&#x27;. One of her first modelling jobs was for Terence Donovan, who photographed her in 1987 together with the then still unknown model Naomi Campbell for the title of the Pirelli Calendar. From there, Dirie&#x27;s modeling career took off, she soon became a successful model, appearing in advertisements for top brands such as Chanel, Levi&#x27;s, L&#x27;Oréal and Revlon.

As a model, Dirie was the first black woman to appear in an Oil of Olay advertisement. She has described the catwalk as her favorite part of modeling, but she has a lesser opinion of the casting process, which she described as &quot;mostly about disappointment&quot;. Because of her previous nomadic lifestyle, coupled with the poor nutrition she had at the time, she developed bowed legs. By the time she considered surgery to have them fixed, her bones had set and surgery was not an option. Over time, she incorporated her legs into her identity, coming to see them as an identifier of her nomadic history and of her African heritage. In 1987, Dirie played a minor role in the James Bond film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;. She also appeared on the runways of London, Milan, Paris and New York City, and in fashion magazines such as &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot;. This was followed in 1995 by a BBC documentary entitled &quot;A Nomad in New York&quot; about her modeling career.

===FGM activism and authorship===
After experiencing painful menstruation, Dirie sought the advice of several doctors, but she declined to speak about the female genital mutilation that she had endured as a child. She eventually saw a doctor to have her vulva reopened. From that point, she no longer found menstruation or urination painful. She described the change as a &quot;new freedom&quot;. In 1997, at the height of her modeling career, Dirie spoke for the first time with Laura Ziv of the women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Marie Claire&quot; about the FGM that she had undergone as a child, at the age of five along with her two sisters. That same year, Dirie became a UN envoy for the abolition of FGM. She later paid her mother a visit in her native Somalia. She instructed her mother to intervene if anyone she knew were to undergo FGM, and her mother eventually asked for her forgiveness for subjecting her to the treatment.

In 1998, Dirie coauthored her first book along with nonfiction author Cathleen Miller: &quot;Desert Flower&quot;, an autobiography that went on to become an international bestseller. Over 11 million copies have been sold worldwide to date, 3 million in Germany alone. She later released other successful books including &quot;Desert Dawn&quot;, &quot;Letter to My Mother&quot; and &quot;Desert Children&quot;, the latter of which was launched in tandem with a European campaign against FGM. Dirie published her second autobiography, &quot;Desert Dawn&quot;, in 2002, four years after her first. The same year, she founded the Desert Flower Foundation in Vienna. The foundation collects money to raise awareness about the worldwide problem of FGM and to help those affected. In the same year, she received the Corine Literature Prize.

In 2004, she received the World Social Award by Mikhail Gorbachev at the Women&#x27;s World Award Gala in Hamburg, Germany. Dirie opened the World Conference against FGM in Nairobi, delivered a much-noticed speech, and published for the first time the Waris-Dirie Manifesto against FGM. The Austrian Federal President Heinz Fischer awarded her the Romero Prize on behalf of the Austrian Catholic Men&#x27;s Movement. In 2006, she addressed the assembled ministers of all EU Member States in Brussels. The European Union then put the fight against female genital mutilation on its agenda, after which laws were tightened up and preventive measures initiated in many European countries. In 2007, the Arab channel Al Jazeera invited Waris Dirie to the popular talk show by Riz Khan. She spoke for the first time on an Arab channel in front of over 100 million viewers about the taboo topic &quot;Female Genital Mutilation&quot;.

In 2009, Desert Flower, a feature-length film based on Waris&#x27; book &quot;Desert Flower&quot; was released, with the Ethiopian supermodel Liya Kebede playing her. Directed by Sherry Hormann, the film was produced by Oscar winner Peter Herrmann. Benjamin Herrmann and Waris Dirie were co-producers. The movie has so far been released in 20 countries including France, Spain, Israel, Greece, Poland and Brazil. In January 2010, it won the Bavarian Film Awards in Munich in the &quot;Best Movie&quot; category. It was also nominated for a Film Award in Gold in the &quot;Outstanding Feature Film&quot; category at the German Film Awards, and won the Audience Award in the &quot;Best European Film&quot; category at the San Sebastián International Film Festival.

In 2010, Dirie was appointed Ambassador of Peace and Security in Africa by the African Union.

==Humanitarian work and campaigns==
Dirie has campaigned extensively to draw attention to female genital mutilation. In 2002 Dirie founded the Desert Flower Foundation in Vienna, an organisation whose goal is to eradicate female genital mutilation worldwide. The Foundation&#x27;s work is financed by donations. She also started the Desert Dawn Foundation, which raises money for schools and clinics in her native Somalia, and supports the Zeitz Foundation, an organization focused on sustainable development and conservation.

In January 2009 Dirie became a founding member of the &quot;PPR Foundation for Women’s Dignity and Rights&quot;, an organization of French tycoon François-Henri Pinault (CEO of PPR) and his wife, Hollywood actress Salma Hayek. In 2010, she campaigned with &quot;Stop FGM Now&quot; in collaboration with the Berlin agency Heymann Brandt de Gelmini. This initiative was awarded the prize for &quot;Best NGO Social Media Campaign&quot; by the German Federal Government. &quot;Together for African Women&quot; followed in 2011, a collaboration with the Hamburg agency Jung von Matt and the laundry label Mey.

After the rescue of &quot;Desert Flower&quot; Safa from FGM in 2014, the sponsorship programme &quot;Save A Little Desert Flower&quot; was launched.

In March 2019 came the much-acclaimed campaign &quot;End FGM&quot; with the British lingerie label Coco de Mer. Dirie posed for the company&#x27;s collection (as the successor to Pamela Anderson) and was staged by photographer Rankin Rankin also produced the campaign&#x27;s short film. The initiative was awarded the if Social Impact Prize 2019 by the iF International Forum Design headquartered in Hanover and was supported with prize money. For Dirie the photo shoot with Rankin in London was a comeback as a model.

===Desert Flower Centers===
There are a number of Desert Flower centers throughout Europe:
*On 11 September 2013, Dirie as patron opened the world&#x27;s first holistic medical center for the treatment and care of FGM victims in Berlin together with the Waldfriede Hospital as a cooperation hospital of the Desert Flower Foundation. The Desert Flower Center was awarded the &quot;Louise Schroeder Medal&quot; by the State of Berlin in 2016.
*In 2014, the &quot;Desert Flower Surgical Training Center&quot; for surgeons, gynaecologists, urologists and nursing staff was established in Amsterdam together with the Desert Flower Foundation BENELUX.
*The &quot;Desert Flower Center Scandinavia&quot; was established in 2015 in cooperation with the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm.
*In 2017 the &quot;Centre Fleur du Desert&quot; opened with the &quot;Fondation Fleur du Desert&quot; in the women&#x27;s shelter at the Hôpital Delafontaine in Paris Saint-Denis. The &quot;Centre Fleur du Desert&quot; was visited by French President Emmanuel Macron in December 2017.

===Education projects in Sierra Leone===
In 2016 Dirie and the team of the Desert Flower Foundation decided to make the topic &quot;Education in Africa&quot; the focus of their work. Through the sponsorship project &quot;Save A Little Desert Flower&quot; 1,000 girls could be saved from FGM in Sierra Leone. The construction of the first three &quot;Desert Flower schools&quot; in Sierra Leone was announced in early 2019. Diries Desert Flower Foundation is also building a &quot;Safe House&quot;, where FGM victims find refuge and protection. There is also a library and a computer centre. In addition, 10,000 copies of Waris Dirie&#x27;s reading book &quot;My Africa - The Journey&quot; with Desert Flower educational boxes will be distributed to 34 schools in Sierra Leone.

==Personal life==
Contrary to popular belief, Dirie is not related to fellow Somali model Iman. In her book &quot;Desert Flower&quot;, Dirie states that Iman&#x27;s mother was good friends with her aunt, a relative with whom she once lived during her time in London.

Since 2009 Dirie has lived in Gdańsk, Poland. She also lived temporarily in Vienna. She is the mother of two sons, Aleeke and Leon. Since March 2005, Dirie has held Austrian citizenship.
===Attack and disappearance===
In March 2004, Dirie was attacked in her home in Vienna. A 26-year-old Portuguese man was held in custody after having apparently stalked her 1,000 miles across Europe, eventually gaining access to her apartment by climbing through a neighbour&#x27;s window. &quot;She was so frightened and in shock that she let him in,&quot; a police spokesman said. Dirie apparently suffered minor injuries when her assailant threw her to the floor. The attacker then left in a taxi, only to return later to smash one of the building&#x27;s ground-floor windows. He was arrested when neighbours called the police and was later given a five-month suspension. It was reported that the suspect had met Dirie six months earlier when his brother was working at her previous residence in Wales. He later broke into that home and stole items of her clothing.

In another incident in early March 2008, Dirie went missing for three days while staying in Brussels. She was found by a Brussels policeman.

Over 11 million copies have been sold worldwide to date, 3 million in Germany alone (number 1 on the &quot;Spiegel&quot; bestseller list from 11 to 17 January and from 25 January to 18 July 1999).
*&quot;Desert Dawn&quot; (2002) with Jeanne D’Haem

*&quot;Desert Children&quot; (2005)
:With her third book Dirie starts a Europe-wide campaign against FGM. Genital mutilation is not only practiced in Africa, but also in the western world. It reports on encounters with victims and perpetrators, on their research, setbacks and successes.
*&quot;Letter to my mother&quot; (2007)
:Dirie says about this book on the website of the Desert Flower Foundation: &quot;This is my most personal book. There are simply wounds that don&#x27;t want to heal. My longing was great to meet my mother again, to forgive my mother, but I had to realize that love and suffering are often inextricably linked. Working on this book was a painful but vital experience for me.&quot;
*&quot;Schwarze Frau, weißes Land&quot; (2010)
:In this book Dirie talks about her life in her new, white homeland - and about her longing for Africa and her deep desire to help her home continent free itself from poverty, outdated traditions and dependence.
*&quot;Saving Safa&quot; (2013)
:Little Safa comes from a bitterly poor family in Djibouti. Raised in a slum, she is selected for the role of little Waris Dirie in the biopic of the world bestseller &quot;Desert Flower&quot;. The dramatic scene, in which the little girl is violently circumcised, makes people cry in cinemas all over the world. In real life, Safa is still intact. Dirie is all the more horrified when she hears that Safa&#x27;s genital mutilation is imminent. And she does everything in her power to save the girl from this cruel practice.
*&quot;My Africa - The Journey&quot; (2017)
:Together with her Desert Flower Foundation team, Dirie publishes her first reading book for children at African schools. The book tells the story of the little &quot;desert flower&quot; Waris and her brother Mo, who go on a journey together to discover their home continent Africa. On their adventures they get to know the flora and fauna of Africa. In addition to the story, the book also contains numerous writing exercises, which are intended to promote the reading and writing skills of children.

The lyrics are by Frank Ramond, with the music by Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen (wrote the music for &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; by Nena). On 22 February 2020 the musical was premiered at the theatre St. Gallen in the presence of Waris Dirie.

<doc id="595766" wikidata="Q1744000" url="?curid=595766" title="Kiwiana">
<text>Kiwiana are certain items and icons from New Zealand&#x27;s heritage, especially from around the middle of the 20th century, that are seen as representing iconic New Zealand elements. These &quot;quirky things that contribute to a sense of nationhood&quot; include both genuine cultural icons and kitsch.

==Origins and history==
Items of Kiwiana are generally either unique or particularly common to New Zealand, particularly from the early and mid-twentieth century. Although the term is sometimes used to describe any and all New Zealand icons, it is more commonly used to describe pop culture items such as toys or branded foods. A few more serious national icons have become Kiwiana through heavy use in advertising and the souvenir industry. These include the kiwi and the hei-tiki. Kiwiana is generally seen as a form of kitsch.

A number of companies with products deemed to be &#x27;Kiwiana&#x27; have enthusiastically cashed in on this. For example, an advertising campaign has claimed that &quot;you&#x27;ll never be a Kiwi &#x27;til you love your Wattie&#x27;s sauce&quot;, even though the company is now American-owned. In the 1990s, a Sanitarium campaign claimed that &quot;Kiwi kids are Weet-Bix kids&quot;. The advertisement was a dubbed version of an Australian advertisement that claimed that &#x27;Aussie kids are Weet-bix kids&#x27; and the landscape in the background of the advertisement is recognisably Australian. Other companies have attempted to create their own Kiwiana. For example, McDonald&#x27;s New Zealand has an off and on &#x27;Kiwiburger&#x27; sold within their stores, which was an attempt to duplicate the traditional New Zealand style of burger with a slice of beetroot and a fried egg, and its advertisement was essentially a sung list of Kiwiana items. A series of L&amp;P commercials, featuring Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords, are based around Kiwiana-themed items, and were very popular with New Zealanders. A number of products widely regarded as Kiwiana, such as Wattie&#x27;s tomato sauce, Marmite, and L&amp;P, are now made by non-New Zealand companies. In some cases, this is because the original New Zealand company has been purchased by an overseas corporation, in others the product has always been made by an international firm.

In recent decades, Kiwiana has become a subject in itself, and several celebratory books have been published. A range of products using Kiwiana motifs has also been produced, including Christmas tree decorations, cards, T-shirts, garden ornaments and jewellery. There are Kiwiana sections in many New Zealand museums, and some are dedicated to showing Kiwiana only. In 1994, New Zealand Post released a set of stamps depicting kiwiana items including a pavlova, fish and chips, rugby boots and ball, and a black singlet and gumboots.

<text>Anastasius of Constantinople (also Anastasios; Greek: Ἀναστάσιος; died January 754) was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 730 to 754. He had been preceded by patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople (715–730). Anastasius was heavily involved in the controversy over icons (images). He was immaculately succeeded in ecumenical rite by Constantine II of Constantinople.

His opinion of icons changed twice. First, he opposed them, then he favored them, and finally he opposed them again.

== Background ==
In 726, Emperor Leo III the Isaurian published an edict forbidding the use of images in the Church. His soldiers consequently removed images from churches throughout the Byzantine Empire. Germanus I, the patriarch of Constantinople, protested the edict. He wrote a letter appealing to Pope Gregory II in Rome in 729. Emperor Leo III deposed Germanus I as patriarch soon afterwards. Pope Gregory II opposed Leo III and urged him to retract the edict, which Leo III refused to do.

== Anastasius&#x27;s Patriarchate ==
Leo III appointed Anastasius patriarch of Constantinople in 730, based largely on his support for iconoclasm. The controversy over the policy would dominate his tenure and fuel the decisive breach between the Eastern and Western churches. Pope Gregory II died in 731, but his successor, Pope Gregory III, continued to resist the new policy, even to the extent of encouraging armed rebellion against Imperial authority in Italy.

In 731 or 733 or by 740, Leo III the Isaurian attached Illyricum and Southern Italy (Sicily and Calabria) to Patriarch Anastasius of Constantinople, transferring the papal authority to the Eastern Church.

In 741 Leo III died and was succeeded as Emperor by his son Constantine V, who almost immediately needed to depart the capital to defend the eastern frontier against the Umayyad Caliphate. Constantine V&#x27;s brother-in-law Emperor Artabasdos, who was kouropalates (&quot;master of the palace&quot;), and commanded both the Opsikion theme and the Armeniac theme, took advantage of the new Emperor&#x27;s absence from the capital to seize the throne. To gain support from those opposed to the iconoclastic policy, Artabasdos reversed it and declared himself the &quot;Protector of the Holy Icons&quot;. Patriarch Anastasius quickly switched sides and suddenly became an ardent defender of icons, which Artabasdos reinstalled in the churches. Anastasius even excommunicated Constantine V and declared him a heretic.

Constantine V gathered the loyal segments of his army and marched to Constantinople in 743. He defeated Artabasdos and had him executed. Anastasius was stripped of his office, whipped and blinded and then paraded through the streets in shame. After Anastasius changed his position on the icon issue again, reverting to his former opinion against icons, he received the Emperor&#x27;s pardon and was restored as patriarch. Anastasius lived until 754.

<text>Steve Hogarth (born Ronald Stephen Hoggarth, 14 May 1956), also known as &quot;h&quot;, is an English musician. Since 1989, he has been the lead singer of the rock band Marillion, for which he also performs additional keyboards and guitar. Hogarth was formerly a keyboard player and co-lead vocalist with the Europeans and vocalist with How We Live. AllMusic has described Hogarth as having a &quot;unique, expressive voice&quot; with &quot;flexible range and beautiful phrasing&quot;.

==Early life==
Hogarth was born in Kendal, Westmorland, England. His father was an engineer in the British Merchant Navy. He was brought up on a council estate in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, from the age of two. As a child he became interested in music, his earliest influences being the Beatles and the Kinks, and taught himself to play piano.

Leaving school at the age of eighteen, Hogarth spent three years studying for a degree in electrical engineering at Trent Polytechnic (now Nottingham Trent University). He was also a member of a band during this time, Harlow, who played working men&#x27;s clubs. They recorded the single &quot;Harry de Mazzio&quot; on the Pepper record label, which Hogarth wrote and later described as &quot;dreadful&quot; and &quot;definitely the worst record I ever made.&quot; The band split in 1981 and Hogarth left his engineering degree, moving to London to further his music career.

==Career==

In London, after responding to an advertisement in the music press Hogarth joined the band Motion Pictures. They were subsequently renamed the Europeans. Initially joining just as a keyboard player, Hogarth later shared the vocal duties with Ferg Harper. Signed to A&amp;M Records, the Europeans released two studio albums and one live album. Hogarth sang just one track on the first studio album but sang five of the eight tracks on the second album.

In 1985, Hogarth and guitarist Colin Woore left the band to form How We Live, The duo were signed to Columbia Records. In 1987, following record company changes, How We Live&#x27;s debut album &quot;Dry Land&quot; was unsuccessful. Hogarth considered leaving the music industry and becoming a milkman or postman. However, a meeting with his publishers arranged by a friend, Darryl Way, a founding member of Curved Air, persuaded him to send a tape to Marillion, who were recruiting for a new lead vocalist following the departure of Fish in late 1988.

Marillion heard the tape and were interested enough to ask for a meeting with the singer. Later accounts of this first meeting record that Hogarth turned up at band member Pete Trewavas&#x27; house with his demo tapes contained in a red plastic fire bucket – the audition taking place in Trewavas&#x27; garage, due to the presence of cats in the house (see below). The band were immediately impressed by his vocal prowess. Hogarth himself, however, took a little longer to make up his mind, holding as he did at the time a potentially lucrative offer to tour the U.S. on keyboards with The The. As he later recalled in a 2001 interview by &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, he had a choice &quot;between the most hip band in the world, and the least...&quot;. In the end he accepted the position with Marillion, won over as the band wanted an equal partner and were offering a potentially permanent arrangement.

Hogarth&#x27;s first album with the band, released in September 1989, was &quot;Seasons End&quot;, their fifth studio album. Since then, Marillion have recorded a further fourteen studio, and numerous live albums, with Hogarth on vocals, the most recent being &quot;An Hour Before It&#x27;s Dark&quot; released in March 2022.

Hogarth has also released one solo studio album under the name &#x27;h&#x27; called &quot;Ice Cream Genius&quot;. This album had contributions from ex-Japan/ Porcupine Tree synthesiser/keyboard maestro Richard Barbieri, former XTC guitarist Dave Gregory, Blondie drummer Clem Burke, bassist Chucho Merchan and percussionist Luís Jardim.

Subsequently, Hogarth&#x27;s side-project, The H-Band, has played live across the UK and Europe featuring a variety of musicians, including former the Stone Roses MKII guitarist Aziz Ibrahim, Massive Attack and the Bays drummer Andy Gangadeen, session musician Jingles on bass, Aziz&#x27;s regular musical partner Dalbir Singh Rattan on tablas and Stephanie Sobey-Jones on cello. With Barbieri and Gregory, this line up recorded a double album entitled &quot;Live Spirit: Live Body&quot; at Dingwalls on 8 and 9 August 2001. It was released one year later.

In 2006, Hogarth undertook a solo tour, &#x27;h Natural&#x27;, during which he played around 20 dates in the UK and Europe . It was billed as an evening of music and conversation with Hogarth at the piano. These shows were mixed and released for download, one at a time and for a limited period only, on Hogarth&#x27;s (now defunct) H-Tunes website.

On 14 May 2010, Hogarth performed at the Relentless Garage in London to celebrate his birthday. On the following two days he also performed in Liverpool and Sheffield. To coincide with these shows a CD was released featuring some of the best tracks taken from his H Natural shows. This collection is called H Natural Selection and was available at the shows and from the Marillion website.

In 2012, Hogarth joined forces with Richard Barbieri again, releasing an album as a duo called &quot;Not the Weapon But the Hand&quot;.

In 2014, it was announced that Hogarth was releasing two volumes of diaries, written between 1991 and 2014. The first was released in June 2014 by Miwk Publishing and is called &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;. Volume 2 followed in December 2014.

Hogarth collaborated with Swedish chamber-rock band Isildurs Bane on an album titled &quot;Colours Not Found in Nature,&quot; released in 2017. Hogarth had written the lyrics and recorded the vocals in hotel rooms around the world while on tour with Marillion.

==Personal life==
Hogarth has three children: a daughter named Sofi and a son named Nial with his first wife Sue, and a son named Emil from his current relationship with Linette, who is from Denmark.

Hogarth is violently allergic to cats, first learning this when hospitalised as a child after visiting a Liverpudlian aunt &quot;...whose house was full of &#x27;em!&quot; Marillion bass player Pete Trewavas had cats in January 1989 when they had their first meeting so Hogarth could not enter his house.

Hogarth is a fan of the football club Manchester United.

==Musical inspirations==
In an interview for &quot;HuffPost&quot; in 2012, Hogarth cited the Blue Nile, Paddy McAloon, Mike Scott, John Lennon, David Bowie and Joni Mitchell as musical inspirations, and Peter Gabriel, Sting and Massive Attack as artists he would like to work with. On Sting, Hogarth commented: &quot;It&#x27;s weird how few artists mention Sting and pull him out but he&#x27;s such a brilliant talent.&quot;

<text>Avery Franklin Brooks (born October 2, 1948) is a retired American actor, director, singer, narrator and educator. He is best known for his television roles as Captain Benjamin Sisko on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, as Hawk on &quot;&quot; and its spinoff &quot;A Man Called Hawk&quot;, and as Dr. Bob Sweeney in the Academy Award–nominated film &quot;American History X&quot;. Brooks has delivered a variety of other performances to a great deal of acclaim. He has been nominated for a Saturn Award and three NAACP Image Awards. Brooks has also been inducted into the College of Fellows of the American Theatre and bestowed with the William Shakespeare Award for Classical Theatre by the Shakespeare Theatre Company.

==Early life==
Avery Brooks was born in Evansville, Indiana, the son of Eva Lydia (&quot;née&quot; Crawford), a choral conductor and music instructor, and Samuel Brooks, a union official and tool and die worker. His maternal grandfather, Samuel Travis Crawford, was also a singer who graduated from Tougaloo College in 1901. When Avery was eight years old his family moved to Gary, Indiana, after his father had been laid off from International Harvester. Brooks has said: &quot;I was born in Evansville...but it was Gary, Indiana, that made me.&quot;

The Brooks household was filled with music. His mother, who was among the first African-American women to earn a master&#x27;s degree in music at Northwestern University, taught music wherever the family lived. His father was a member of the Wings Over Jordan Choir, an &quot;a cappella&quot; spiritual choir best known for performing on CBS radio from 1937 to 1947. His maternal uncle Samuel Travis Crawford was a member of the Delta Rhythm Boys. &quot;Music is all around me and in me, as I am in it,&quot; Brooks has said.

Brooks attended Indiana University and Oberlin College. He later completed his Bachelor of Arts plus a Master of Fine Arts from Rutgers University in 1976, becoming the first African American to receive an MFA in acting and directing from Rutgers.

==Career==
===Television career===
====&quot;Spenser: For Hire&quot;: Hawk====
In 1985, Brooks was cast in the role of Hawk on the ABC television detective series &quot;&quot;, based on the mystery series published by Robert Parker. Hawk became a popular character, and after three seasons, Brooks in 1989 received his own, short-lived spinoff series, &quot;A Man Called Hawk&quot;.

Brooks said of his role as Hawk: &quot;I never thought of myself as the sidekick... I&#x27;ve never been the side of anything. I just assumed that I was equal.&quot;

Brooks returned to play Hawk in four &quot;Spenser&quot; television movies: &quot;Spenser: Ceremony&quot;, &quot;Spenser: Pale Kings and Princes&quot;, &quot;Spenser: The Judas Goat&quot; and &quot;Spenser: A Savage Place&quot;.

====&quot;Star Trek&quot;: Benjamin Sisko====
Brooks is best known for his role as Benjamin Sisko on the syndicated science-fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; which ran for seven seasons from 1993 to 1999.

Brooks won the role of Commander Benjamin Sisko by beating 100 other actors from all racial backgrounds to become the first Black-American captain to lead a &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. Brooks also directed nine episodes of the series, including &quot;Far Beyond the Stars&quot;, an episode focusing on racial injustice.

Series producer Ronald D. Moore said of Brooks: 
Brooks was nominated for a Saturn Award and two NAACP Image Awards for the role.

====Other roles====
In 1984, Brooks received critical praise for his featured role in PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Playhouse&quot; production of &quot;Half Slave, Half Free: Solomon Northup&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;, directed by Gordon Parks. The story chronicled the life of Solomon Northup, a free man from New York kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841 and held until 1853, when he regained his freedom with the help of family and friends. It was adapted from Northup&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Twelve Years a Slave&quot; (1853).

Brooks appeared in the 1985 television movie adaptation of &quot;Finnegan Begin Again.&quot; In 1987, he starred in the role of Uncle Tom in Showtime&#x27;s filmed adaptation of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin.&quot; Brooks was nominated for an Ace Award in the category of best actor in a movie or miniseries for that said role. A third project that allowed Brooks to highlight the history of African Americans was his performance in the 1988 television movie &quot;&quot;, which featured his fellow &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors LeVar Burton, Kate Mulgrew, and Tim Russ.

During 1998 he also supplied the voice of King Maximus in an episode of the animated TV series, &quot;Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child&quot; entitled &quot;The Golden Goose&quot;. Brooks was eventually nominated for an NAACP Image Award within the category of Outstanding Performance in a Youth or Children&#x27;s Series/Special for the role. He also voiced the character of Nokkar in an episode of the Disney animated series &quot;Gargoyles&quot;.

In 2001, Brooks narrated and appeared in a series of commercials for IBM.

===Teaching and cultural work===
Brooks has taught at Oberlin College and Case Western Reserve University. A graduate of Livingston College and Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, he accepted an appointment in 1976 as an associate professor of theater arts at Mason Gross.

A deep baritone singer, Brooks has performed on stage with Butch Morris, Lester Bowie, and Jon Hendricks. He also recorded an album with saxophone player James Spaulding, &quot;James Spaulding Plays the Legacy of Duke Ellington&quot; (Storyville, 1977).

In his role as Benjamin Sisko, he performed the Frank Sinatra tune &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot; at the conclusion of the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Badda-Bing Badda-Bang&quot; as a duet with James Darren.

In a brief venture into scoring, Brooks composed the musical score for the final two episodes of &quot;A Man Called Hawk&quot;, which he starred in.

In 2009, Brooks released his debut album, &quot;Here&quot;, an album of jazz and blues covers, as well as spoken word. During 2016 Brooks performed in concert with the Springfield Symphony Orchestra at the Springfield Symphony Hall.

===Theater===
Brooks received critical acclaim in Phillip Hayes Dean&#x27;s play &quot;Paul Robeson&quot;. Brooks portrayed the life of the famous singer, actor, and civil-rights activist in a one-man, critically acclaimed biographical drama. He has performed the role since 1982 at the Westwood Playhouse in Los Angeles, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and the Longacre Theater on Broadway. He also portrayed Robeson in &quot;Are You Now Or Have You Ever Been?&quot;, both on- and off-Broadway.

He subsequently starred in &quot;Othello&quot; at the Folger Shakespeare Festival (1985) and &quot;Fences&quot; at the Repertory Theater of St. Louis, Missouri, in 1990. He reprised the role of &quot;Othello&quot; at the Washington Shakespeare Theater in 1990–1991.

During 1994, he was inducted in the College of Fellows of the American Theatre. Brooks later appeared in the title role of &quot;The Oedipus Plays&quot;, a production that traveled to the 2003 Athens Festival in Greece. He also appeared in the title role of &quot;King Lear&quot; at Yale&#x27;s Repertory Theatre. In 2005, Brooks again starred as &quot;Othello&quot;, this time at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in a production directed by renowned Michael Kahn. Brooks was one of 15 actors of the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C., to be honored with the William Shakespeare Award for Classical Theatre in 2007. He returned to the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Fall 2007 to play the title role in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Tamburlaine&quot;. His performance was interrupted when an injury made it necessary for him to take time off to heal.

In September 2008, Brooks played Willy Loman in a production of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; at Oberlin College.

During 2010, Brooks performed in Baltimore Center Stage&#x27;s production of Kwame Kwei-Armah&#x27;s play Let There Be Love. Once again, Brooks played the title role of Paul Robeson at the Shakespeare Theater from March 24–27 in 2011.

He also narrated the three-part series &quot;Heart of Africa&quot;, consisting of &quot;Heart of Africa: Jewel of the Rift&quot;, about the lifecycles of African cichlid fish in Lake Tanganyika, &quot;Heart of Africa: Virunga&quot;, about the gorillas of Virunga National Park, and &quot;Heart of Africa: Fire and Ice&quot;, about the lowland animals of the Rift Valley.

In May 2007, Brooks recorded the narration for the documentary &quot;The Better Hour&quot;, which is about the life of William Wilberforce, the man who led the campaign for the end of slavery in the United Kingdom in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

Brooks also provided the narration for the BBC series &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; when it aired in North America on the Discovery Channel. His deep and authoritative voice commanded viewer attention; Brooks was able to draw on his years of training as an opera singer and his extensive stage experience with Shakespeare company actors not only to engage the viewer, but also to use his vocal abilities to emphasize the events as seen in the show.

In 2009, Brooks narrated a special documentary for the National Geographic channel, titled &quot;Drain the Ocean&quot;. Using CGI animation, National Geographic simulates removing the water from the oceans to explore the ocean floor and its vast geography.

In 2011, Brooks was interviewed by William Shatner in the feature-length documentary &quot;The Captains&quot;. The film was written and directed by Shatner and features the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; captain interviewing every other actor who had portrayed a prominently recurring captain, upon whom the science-fiction franchise had yet been based. Brooks also served as music supervisor for the project.

In 2013, Brooks began to narrate the Christian or Abrahamic series &quot;The Bible&#x27;s Greatest Secrets&quot;, on the American Heroes Channel, which attempted to use interpretations of events found in the &quot;Bible&quot; to illuminate new archeological findings and interpretations of history, and to use interpretations of new archeological findings to illuminate interpretations of events found in the Bible. IMDb lists the &quot;Storyline&quot; as: &quot;Unlock the mysteries of vanished civilizations of the Holy Land and the people who built them.&quot;

===Other projects===

As part of BBC Audiobooks America&#x27;s entry into the US market, Brooks narrated an audiobook of Alex Haley&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot;. This was the first time the novel was adapted into an audiobook. Brooks had previously starred in a 1988 television film based upon the book, &quot;Roots: The Gift&quot;. As an audio book, &quot;Roots: The Saga of an American Family&quot; won an Audie Award in 2008 within the category of Non-Fiction.

In 2007, Brooks released an album containing in his words &quot;a selection of ballads and love songs... I speak of my respect for my father, and for artists that I have listened to all my life.&quot;

<text>A vice-county (also spelled vice county) is a geographical division of the British Isles. It is also called biological vice-county as it is used for purposes of biological recording and other scientific data-gathering, or sometimes called a Watsonian vice-county as vice-counties were introduced by Hewett Cottrell Watson in the third volume of his &quot;Cybele Britannica&quot;, published in 1852. Watson&#x27;s vice-counties were based on the ancient counties of Britain, but often subdividing these boundaries to create smaller, more uniform units, and considering exclaves to be part of the surrounding vice-county.

In 1901 Robert Lloyd Praeger introduced a similar system for Ireland and its off-shore islands.

Vice-counties are the &quot;standard geographical area for county based [...] recording&quot;. They provide a stable basis for recording using similarly sized units, and, although National Grid-based reporting has grown in popularity, vice-counties remain a useful mapping boundary, employed in many regional surveys, especially county floras and national lists. This allows data collected over long periods of time to be compared easily. The vice-counties remain unchanged by subsequent local government reorganisations, allowing historical and modern data to be more accurately compared.

In 2002, to mark the 150th anniversary of the introduction of the Watsonian vice-county system, the NBN Trust commissioned the digitisation of the 112 vice-county boundaries for England, Scotland and Wales, based on 420 original one-inch to the mile maps annotated by Dandy in 1947, and held at the Natural History Museum, London. The resulting datafiles were much more detailed than anything readily available to recorders up to that point, and were made freely available (as a beta version). Intended for use with modern GIS and biological recording software, a final &#x27;standard&#x27; version was released in 2008. Up until that point, county recorders only had general access to a set of two fold-out vice-county maps covering the entirety of Great Britain, published in 1969.

==Vice-county systems==

The vice-county system was first introduced by Hewett Cottrell Watson in the third volume of his &quot;Cybele Britannica&quot; published in 1852. He refined the system in later volumes. The geographical area that Watson called &quot;Britain&quot; consisted of the island of Great Britain with all of its offshore islands, plus the Isle of Man, but excluding the Channel Islands. This area was divided into 112 vice-counties with larger counties divided; for example, Devon into the vice-counties of North Devon and South Devon, and Yorkshire into five vice-counties. Each of these 112 vice-counties has a name and a number. Thus Vice-county 38, often abbreviated to &quot;VC38&quot;, is called &quot;Warwickshire&quot;.

In 1901, Robert Lloyd Praeger extended the system of vice-counties to Ireland and its off-shore islands, based on an earlier suggestion by C. C. Babington in 1859. The Irish vice-counties were based on the historic 32 counties of Ireland, with the six largest being sub-divided; for example, the county of Cork was divided into three vice-counties. This produced a total of 40 vice-counties for Ireland, which were numbered from H1 to H40 (&quot;H&quot; for &quot;Hibernia&quot;). As with the 112 vice-counties of Britain, each vice-county has a name as well as a number. Thus Vice-county (or VC) H3 is &quot;West Cork&quot;.

Combining these two systems produces a 152 vice-county system. The exclusion of the Channel Islands from Watson&#x27;s system for Britain has led to variations between different recording schemes. The geographical area covered by the 152 vice-counties may be described as the &quot;British Isles&quot;, as in the 2008 &quot;Checklist of Beetles of the British Isles&quot;. Other recording schemes regard the &quot;British Isles&quot; as including the Channel Islands. As they are not part of the 152 vice-county system, the Channel Islands may be added as an extra vice-county, making 153 in total, being indicated by letter codes such as &quot;C&quot; or &quot;CI&quot;. Less usually, each of the five separate islands may be treated as a vice-county, giving 157 vice-counties in total.

Alternative counts of vice-counties used in different recording schemes are shown in the table below.
The vice-counties of Britain alone may be described as &quot;Watsonian vice-counties&quot;, or this term may be used for the combined vice-counties of Britain and Ireland, which may also be described as &quot;Watson-Praeger vice-counties&quot;. In all cases, the Channel Islands may be excluded or included, so that the count of vice-counties varies, as noted in the table above.

==List of vice-counties==
==Vice-counties of Ireland listed by county, province and jurisdiction==
Praeger&#x27;s fieldwork mostly predates and ignores the county boundary changes made in 1899 under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. Divergences from the pre-1899 boundaries are noted below.

<doc id="595792" wikidata="Q1464556" url="?curid=595792" title="2004 South African general election">
<text>General elections were held in South Africa on Wednesday, 14 April 2004. The African National Congress (ANC) of President Thabo Mbeki, which came to power after the end of the apartheid system in 1994, was re-elected with an increased majority.

These were the third elections held since the end of the apartheid era. The South African National Assembly consists of 400 members, elected by proportional representation. 200 members are elected from national party lists, the other 200 are elected from party lists in each of the nine provinces. The President of South Africa is chosen by the National Assembly after each election.

The ANC, which had been in power since 1994, obtained 69.7% of votes cast on the national ballot, theoretically allowing them to change the constitution.

Some 20.6-million people were registered for the 2004 general elections, which was about 2 million more than in 1999. About 76% of registered voters took part in the election, with the ANC receiving 69.7% of the votes cast. However, only 56% of eligible voters (South African citizens of voting age) took part in the 2004 election, which means that the ANC received votes from only about 38% of all eligible voters.

The year 2004 saw an increase in voter abstention and there was at least one high-profile election and registration boycotts campaign, the No Land! No House! No Vote! Campaign. A major electoral issue during the election was the dominance of the ANC; detractors of the ANC, most notably the Democratic Alliance, argued that the party&#x27;s political dominance posed a threat to the country&#x27;s democratic institutions and that voters should therefore vote for opposition parties.

The main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, also obtained an increased percentage on the national ballot, most likely from former supporters of the New National Party (NNP), possibly losing some support to Patricia de Lille&#x27;s new Independent Democrats. The NNP, a descendant of the ruling party of the apartheid era, collapsed and lost most of their support, dropping from 6.9% in 1999 to 1.7% (it was 20.4% in 1994), many of their supporters being unhappy with their alliance with the ANC. The NNP alliance with the ANC allowed the ANC gain control of the Western Cape and City of Cape Town; following the election the NNP elected to dissolve and merge with the ANC.

The Independent Democrats surprised many observers by obtaining more votes than the New National Party, becoming the fifth largest party. The Inkatha Freedom Party lost some support, including the majority in their stronghold province of Kwazulu-Natal, while the United Democratic Movement also lost support, barely hanging on as opposition in their stronghold, the Eastern Cape. As of 2024 this is the last election in which the ANC made gains in both seats and popular vote.

== Events ==
A corruption scandal dubbed &quot;Oilgate&quot; by the South African media surfaced when it was reported that R11 million was transferred from the state owned PetroSA to help fund the African National Congress&#x27; election campaign. Following the election the Mail and Guardian newspaper was controversially gagged from publishing a report on the Oilgate scandal. 

==National Assembly results==
===Contested seat===
When the official results were released, the ACDP successfully challenged the outcome. As a result, one of the two seats AZAPO won initially was handed over to the ACDP.

==Provincial legislature results==
Elections for the nine provincial parliaments were held at the same time as for the National Assembly.
===Eastern Cape===
===Free State===
===Gauteng===
===KwaZulu-Natal===
===Limpopo===
===Mpumalanga===
===North West===
===Northern Cape===
===Western Cape===
===NCOP seats===
The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) consists of 90 members, ten elected by each provincial legislature. The Members of NCOP have to be elected in proportion to the party membership of the provincial legislature.

<doc id="595793" wikidata="Q838963" url="?curid=595793" title="Pyrus pyrifolia">
<text>Pyrus pyrifolia is a species of pear tree native to southern China and northern Indochina that has been introduced to Korea, Japan and other parts of the world. The tree&#x27;s edible fruit is known by many names, including Asian pear, Persian pear, Japanese pear, Chinese pear, Korean pear, Taiwanese pear, apple pear, zodiac pear, three-halves pear, papple, naspati and sand pear. Along with cultivars of &quot;P&quot;. × &quot;bretschneideri&quot; and &quot;Pyrus ussuriensis&quot;, the fruit is also called the nashi pear. Cultivars derived from &quot;Pyrus pyrifolia&quot; are grown throughout East Asia, and in other countries such Pakistan, Nepal, Australia, New Zealand, and America. Traditionally in East Asia the tree&#x27;s flowers are a popular symbol of early spring, and it is a common sight in gardens and the countryside.

The fruits are not generally baked in pies or made into jams because they have a high water content and a crisp, grainy texture, very different from the European varieties. They are commonly served raw and peeled. The fruit tends to be quite large and fragrant. When carefully wrapped, having a tendency to bruise because of its juiciness, it can last for several weeks (or more) in a cold, dry place.

== Culture ==
Due to their relatively high price and the large size of the fruit of cultivars, the pears tend to be served to guests, given as gifts, or eaten together in a family setting.

In cooking, ground pears are used in vinegar- or soy sauce-based sauces as a sweetener, instead of sugar. They are also used when marinating meat, especially beef, with a notable example being in the Korean dish bulgogi, due to the presence of enzymes to tenderize the proteins in the meat.

In Australia, these pears were first introduced into commercial production beginning in 1980.

In Japan, fruit is harvested in Chiba, Ibaraki, Tottori, Fukushima, Tochigi, Nagano, Niigata, Saitama and other prefectures, except Okinawa. &quot;Nashi&quot; () may be used as a late Autumn &quot;kigo&quot;, or &quot;season word&quot;, when writing haiku. &quot;Nashi no hana&quot; (, pear flower) is also used as a &quot;kigo&quot; of spring. At least one city (Kamagaya-Shi, Chiba Prefecture) has the flowers of this tree as an official city flower.

In Nepal (Nepali: &quot;Naspati&quot; नस्पाती) and the Himalayan states of India, they are cultivated as a cash crop in the Middle Hills between about in elevation, where the climate is suitable. The fruit are carried to nearby markets by human porters or, increasingly, by truck, but not for long distances because they bruise easily.

In Taiwan, pears harvested in Japan have become luxurious presents since 1997 and their consumption has jumped.

In China, the term &quot;sharing a pear&quot; () is a homophone of &quot;separate&quot; (). As a result, sharing a pear with a loved one can be read as a desire to separate from them.

In Korea, the fruit is known as (), and it is grown and consumed in great quantity. In the South Korean city of Naju, there is a museum called The Naju Pear Museum and Pear Orchard for Tourists ().

In Cyprus, the pears were introduced in 2010 after initially being investigated as a new fruit crop for the island in the early 1990s. They are currently grown in Kyperounta.

== Cultivars ==

Cultivars are classified in two groups. Most of the cultivars belong to the &quot;Akanashi&quot; (&#x27;Russet pears&#x27;) group, and have yellowish-brown rinds. The &quot;Aonashi&quot; (&#x27;Green pears&#x27;) have yellow-green rinds.

Important cultivars include:
* &#x27;Chojuro&#x27; (, Japan, 1893?) (&#x27;Russet pears&#x27;)
* &#x27;Kosui&#x27; (, Japan, 1959; the most important cultivar in Japan) (&#x27;Russet pears&#x27;)
* &#x27;Hosui&#x27; (, Japan, 1972) (&#x27;Russet pears&#x27;)
* &#x27;Imamuraaki&#x27; (, Japan, native) (&#x27;Russet pears&#x27;)
* &#x27;Nijisseiki&#x27; (, Japan, 1898; name means &quot;20th century&quot;, also spelled &#x27;Nijusseiki&#x27;) (&#x27;Green pears&#x27;)
* &#x27;Niitaka&#x27; (, Japan, 1927) (&#x27;Russet pears&#x27;)
* &#x27;Okusankichi&#x27; (, Japan, native) (&#x27;Russet pears&#x27;)
* &#x27;Raja&#x27; (new) (&#x27;Russet pears&#x27;)
* &#x27;Shinko&#x27; (, Japan, pre-1941) (&#x27;Russet pears&#x27;) (&#x27;Russet pears&#x27;)
* &#x27;Hwangkeum&#x27; (, , Korea, 1984, &#x27;Niitaka&#x27; × &#x27;Nijisseiki&#x27;)
* &#x27;Huanghuali&#x27; (not to be confused with the wood of &quot;Dalbergia odorifera&quot;, also called Huanghuali)

===Pyrus pyrifolia var. culta===

<text>F-Zero GX is a 2003 racing video game developed by Amusement Vision and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. A collaboration between Nintendo and Sega, it runs on an enhanced version of the engine used in &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot;. F-Zero AX, the arcade counterpart of &quot;GX&quot;, uses the Triforce arcade system board; it was released by Sega alongside &quot;GX&quot; in 2003.

&quot;F-Zero GX&quot; is the successor to &quot;F-Zero X&quot; and continues the series&#x27; difficult, high-speed racing style, retaining the basic gameplay and control system from the Nintendo 64 game. A heavy emphasis is placed on track memorization and reflexes. &quot;GX&quot; introduces a &quot;story mode&quot; element, where the player assumes the role of &quot;F-Zero&quot; pilot Captain Falcon through nine chapters while completing various missions.

The &quot;GX&quot; and &quot;AX&quot; project was the first significant video game collaboration between Nintendo and Sega. &quot;GX&quot; was well received by critics for its visuals, intense action, high sense of speed, and track design while its high difficulty has been criticized.

==Gameplay==

&quot;F-Zero GX&quot; is a futuristic racing game where up to thirty competitors race on massive circuits inside plasma-powered machines in an intergalactic . It is the successor to &quot;F-Zero X&quot; and continues the series&#x27; difficult, high-speed racing style, retaining the basic gameplay and control system from the Nintendo 64 game. Tracks include enclosed tubes, cylinders, tricky jumps, and rollercoaster-esque paths. Some courses are littered with innate obstacles like dirt patches and mines. A heavy emphasis is placed on track memorization and reflexes, which aids in completing the game. Each machine handles differently, has its own performance abilities affected by its weight, and a grip, boost, and durability trait graded on an A to E (best to worst) scale. Before a race, the player is able to adjust a vehicle&#x27;s balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed. Every machine has an energy meter, which serves two purposes. First, it is a measurement of the machine&#x27;s health and is decreased from accidents or attacks from opposing racers. Second, the player is usually given the ability to boost after the first lap, but must sacrifice energy to do so. Pit areas and dash plates are located at various points around the track for vehicles to drive over. The former replenishes energy, while the latter gives a speed boost without using up any energy. The less time spent in the pit area, the less energy will regenerate. Courses may also have jump plates, which launch vehicles into the air enabling them to cut corners.

Each racing craft contains air brakes for navigating tight corners by using an analog stick and shoulder buttons. Afterwards, the game&#x27;s physics modeling give vehicles setup with high acceleration a boost of acceleration. Players can easily exploit this on a wide straight stretch of a circuit to generate serpentinous movements. This technique called &quot;snaking&quot; delivers a massive increase in speed, but it is best used on the easier tracks, when racing alone in Time Trial, and with heavy vehicles with a high grip rating and given high acceleration. According to Nintendo, the snaking technique was an intentional addition to &quot;F-Zero GX&quot;″s gameplay.
&quot;F-Zero GX&quot; features numerous gameplay modes and options. In the Grand Prix mode, the player races against twenty-nine opponents through three laps of each track in a cup. There are four cups available (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, and Diamond) with five tracks in each. Unlocking the AX cup gives the player all six tracks from the arcade game, &quot;F-Zero AX&quot;. Each cup has four selectable difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Expert, and Master. Players get a certain number of points for finishing a track depending on where they placed, and the winner of the circuit is the character who receives the most total points. If the player has a &quot;spare machine&quot;—the equivalent of an extra life—then the race can be restarted even if the player&#x27;s vehicle is destroyed from losing all energy or falling off the track. A predetermined number of spare machines based on the difficulty level chosen are given to players before starting a cup. Players get an additional spare machine for every five contenders they destroy through vehicular combat, with each destroyed and eliminated opponent also granting extra energy.

The Vs. Battle is the multiplayer mode where two to four players can compete simultaneously. Time Attack lets the player choose any track and complete it in the shortest time possible. An Internet ranking system was established where players enter a password on the official F-Zero website and get ranked based on their position in the database. Players receive a password after completing a Time Attack race, which records their time and machine used. Ghost data, transparent re-enactments of the player&#x27;s Time Attack performances, can be saved on memory cards to later race against. Up to five ghosts can be raced against simultaneously. The Replay mode allows saved Grand Prix and Time Attack gameplay to be replayed with different camera angles and in-game music. The Pilot Profile mode has each character&#x27;s biography, theme music, information on their machine, and a short full motion video sequence.

Customize mode is divided between the F-Zero Shop, Garage, and Emblem Editor. The shop is where opponent machines, custom parts for vehicle creation, and miscellaneous items such as story mode chapters and staff ghost data can be purchased with tickets. Tickets are acquired as the player progresses through the Grand Prix, Time Attack, and Story mode. In the Garage section, players can create a machine with three custom parts or print emblems on any vehicle. The parts are divided into body, cockpit, and booster categories, and affect the vehicle&#x27;s overall durability, maximum speed, cornering, and acceleration. The Emblem Editor lets players create decals.

&quot;F-Zero GX&quot; is the first &quot;F-Zero&quot; game to feature a story mode. Its story has the player assume the role of &quot;F-Zero&quot; pilot Captain Falcon in nine chapters of various racing scenarios; such as Falcon&#x27;s training regiment, a race against a rival through a canyon with falling boulders, attack and eliminate a rival&#x27;s gang, and escape from a collapsing building through closing blast doors. Each chapter can be completed on a normal, hard, and very hard difficulty setting. Toshihiro Nagoshi, one of the game&#x27;s co-producers, stated that this mode was included because the development team felt that the &quot;F-Zero&quot; universe was unique and they wanted to explain some of the characters&#x27; motivations and flesh out the game world.

==Arcade counterpart==

&quot;F-Zero AX&quot; is a futuristic racing arcade game developed by Amusement Vision and published by Sega for the Triforce arcade system board. It is the second game by Sega to use Triforce, which was conceived from a business alliance between them, Nintendo and Namco. This hardware allows for connectivity between the GameCube and arcade games. &quot;F-Zero AX&quot;″s arcade cabinet is available for purchase in standard and deluxe versions. The standard version is a regular sit-down model, while the deluxe version is shaped like Captain Falcon&#x27;s vehicle and has a tilting seat simulating the craft&#x27;s cockpit. &quot;IGN&quot; demoed the Cycraft version dubbed &quot;F-Zero Monster Ride&quot; at the 2003 JAMMA arcade show. The Cycraft machine, co-developed between Sega and Simuline, is a cabin suspended in midair controlled by three servomotors for an in-depth motion-based simulation.

The game features 14 playable vehicles with their pilots, consisting of ten newcomers and the four returning characters from the original &quot;F-Zero&quot;, as well as six race tracks. Each track must be completed before time runs out. Time extensions are awarded for reaching multiple checkpoints on a course however, the player will receive time penalties for falling off-course or depleting their energy meter. Two gameplay modes are available: Race mode, in which the player races against twenty-nine opponents; and Time Attack mode, in which the player attempts to complete a track in the fastest time possible. Connecting multiple cabinets opens up &quot;Versus Play&quot; in the race mode, thus enabling up to four players to compete simultaneously.

===Data storage devices===
&quot;F-Zero AX&quot; cabinets can dispense magnetic stripe cards called an &quot;F-Zero license card&quot; to keep track of custom machine data, pilot points, and race data. A card was bundled with the Japanese release of &quot;F-Zero GX&quot;. The card expires after fifty uses, but its data can be transferred to a new card. Once inserted, the game builds a machine with three custom parts which can be upgraded by earning pilot points. Pilot points are acquired as the player progresses through the Race and Time Attack modes. Players can increase point earnings by improving finish place, eliminating opponents, and finishing races with a large amount of energy reserved. A magnetic stripe card is needed to enter the &quot;F-Zero AX&quot; Internet Ranking system. Similarly to &quot;GX&quot;, players receive a password after completing a Time Attack race to enter on the official &quot;F-Zero&quot; website&#x27;s ranking system.

GameCube memory cards, on which saved games are kept, can be inserted into these arcade units. A memory card is required for players a chance to win the &quot;AX&quot;-exclusive pilots, their vehicles, and tracks for use in &quot;GX&quot;. Players can store up to four machines from &quot;GX&quot; on a memory card, then play them in &quot;AX&quot;. If a memory card is used with a magnetic stripe card, players have additional options; they can enter stored &quot;GX&quot; machines into the &quot;F-Zero AX&quot; Internet ranking system, and transfer custom &quot;AX&quot; machine parts to &quot;GX&quot;. &quot;F-Zero AX&quot; content can also be acquired by completing &quot;GX&quot;″s tougher challenges, or through the use of a cheat device.

==Development and release==
After Sega transitioned from first to third-party development in 2001, they and Nintendo developed a close relationship. Toshihiro Nagoshi, president of Sega subsidiary Amusement Vision, developed &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; for the GameCube, which opened up the opportunity for a collaboration between the two companies. Nintendo announced on February 18, 2002, that an arcade system board under the name of &quot;Triforce&quot; was being developed in conjunction between Nintendo, Namco, and Sega. The idea for the arcade board originated after discussions between Sega and Namco about the capabilities and cost effectiveness of the GameCube architecture to make arcade games. Sega, having helped to develop Nintendo&#x27;s Triforce arcade system, wanted to support it with software that would &quot;stand out and draw attention to Nintendo&#x27;s platform.&quot; Nagoshi was suggested to develop a driving game and agreed under the stipulation he could come up with something unique—which was working on the next installment in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;F-Zero&quot; series. Nagoshi contemplated declining the project due to the combined pressure of making a great impression on Nintendo and creating the next installment of an esteemed franchise, but his curiosity about what he and his team could create overcame his hesitation.
In March 2002, an announcement from Sega and Nintendo revealed that Amusement Vision and Nintendo would collaborate to release &quot;F-Zero&quot; video game titles for the Triforce arcade board and the GameCube. &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; and &quot;AX&quot; was the first significant software collaboration between Nintendo and Sega, and the announcement that Nintendo had handled development of one of its franchises to former competitor Sega came as a surprise to some critics. Nagoshi claimed that 1991&#x27;s &quot;F-Zero&quot; &quot;actually taught me what a game should be&quot; and that it served as an influence for him to create &quot;Daytona USA&quot; and other racing games. &quot;F-Zero&quot; producer Shigeru Miyamoto stated that Nintendo &quot;gained a lot of fans among current game developers, including famous producers like Mr. Nagoshi who grew up playing Nintendo games and are big fans of some of our titles.&quot; and thought the collaboration resulted in a &quot;true evolution of the &quot;F-Zero&quot; series&quot;, enhancing the simulation of racing at high speeds and expanding the &quot;F-Zero world on a grand scale.&quot;

While Amusement Vision was responsible for most of the game&#x27;s development, Miyamoto and Takaya Imamura of Nintendo EAD took on the role of producer and supervisor, respectively. Sega handled planning and execution and Nintendo was responsible for supervision of their product. Nagoshi was initially concerned about differences in opinion between the two companies, and mentioned &quot;If Nintendo planned to hold our hands through development, I would have suggested they develop the game themselves. That way we could focus on a project which would reflect our studio&#x27;s abilities. I figured that would cause a war, but I was told most of the responsibility would be left to us.&quot; &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; runs on an enhanced version of the engine used in &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot;. During the game&#x27;s development, Nagoshi focused on what he called its self-explanatory &quot;interface&quot; and &quot;rhythm&quot; to give the way the tracks are laid out a rhythmic feel. The game&#x27;s soundtrack features an array of songs from rock and techno musical styles originally composed by the game music staff&#x27;s Hidenori Shoji and Daiki Kasho. Shojii is known for his musical scores in &quot;Daytona USA 2&quot; and &quot;Fighting Vipers 2&quot;, while Kasho worked on the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series. Kasho composed the character themes and their lyrics were by Alan Brey. Both Shoji and Kasho supervised the soundtrack&#x27;s audio mastering.

Nintendo revealed the first footage of &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; at the Pre-Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference on May 21, 2002. While the game was known to exist several months prior, it had remained behind closed doors until that conference. In early March 2003, according to the official Nintendo website, &quot;F-Zero&quot; was delayed by two months. Via a live video conference call from Japan on July 7, Miyamoto, Nagoshi, and Imamura answered questions about the two &quot;F-Zero&quot; games. There, Miyamoto announced the Japanese version of the game was finished and would soon be available to the public. Nagoshi mentioned that back at E3 2003, he was hoping that they would have that time to include a local area network (LAN) multiplayer mode, however they chose not to support this mode. The development team focused more on the game&#x27;s single-player aspects, and a LAN multiplayer mode would distract greatly from it. Imamura commented that even though he worked directly on &quot;F-Zero&quot; throughout its different incarnations, this time he took a &quot;step back and was involved at kind of a producer level at looking over the game.&quot; Imamura added &quot;hav[ing] worked on the &quot;F-Zero&quot; series, and seeing the results of the collaboration with Sega, I found myself at something of a loss as to how we can take the franchise further past &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; and &quot;AX&quot;.&quot;

Published by Nintendo, &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; was released in Japan on July 25, 2003, in North America on August 25, in Australia on October 24, and in Europe on October 31. The Arcade version was released in 2003 alongside its Gamecube counterpart. &quot;F-Zero GX/AX Original Soundtracks&quot;, a two-CD set composed of BGM soundtracks to the video games &quot;GX&quot; and its arcade counterpart, was released in Japan under the Scitron Digital Content record label on July 22, 2004. The first disc consists of forty-one tracks and the second has forty with an additional track rearranged by Supersweep&#x27;s AYA (Ayako Sasō) of &quot;Big Blue&quot;.
==Reception==
When &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; was released, the game was well-received overall by reviewers; the title holds an average of 89/100 on the aggregate website Metacritic. Some video game journalists consider it as one of the best racers of its time and the greatest racer on the GameCube platform. It was listed &quot;Best GameCube Racing Game&quot; in the E3 2003 &quot;IGN&quot; Awards and &quot;Best Racing Game of 2003&quot; by &quot;IGN&quot;. &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; was named the best GameCube game of August 2003 and &quot;Best GameCube Driving Game&quot; of 2003 overall by &quot;GameSpot&quot;, and was nominated for &quot;Console Racing Game of the Year&quot; at the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards held by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked it the 92nd best game available on Nintendo platforms. The staff felt it was best for hardcore fans. &quot;Edge&quot; ranked the game 66th on their 100 Best Video Games in 2007.

The game has been credited for its visuals, arcade/home connectivity, longevity, sharp controls, tough challenge, and fleshed-out single-player modes. The game&#x27;s most common criticism is its difficulty, specifically in the game&#x27;s story mode. It earned fourth place in &quot;IGN&quot;″s and &quot;GameTrailers&quot;″ toughest games to beat. &quot;GameTrailers&quot; mentioned &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; demanded players to master the &quot;rollercoaster-style tracks [which] required hairline precision&quot; to avoid falling off-course. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; criticized &quot;GX&quot;″s sharp increase in difficulty and &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Jeff Gerstmann agreed stating it &quot;will surely turn some people away before they&#x27;ve seen the 20 tracks and unlocked all the story mode chapters&quot;. Bryn Williams of &quot;GameSpy&quot; mentioned that &quot;purists may find it too similar to N64 version&quot; and criticized the lack of LAN play.

&quot;1UP.com&quot; stated that the &quot;F-Zero&quot; series is &quot;finally running on hardware that can do it proper justice&quot;. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Kristan Reed pointed out that, graphically, &quot;it&#x27;s hard to imagine how Amusement Vision could have done a better job&quot;. Matt Casamassina of &quot;IGN&quot; praised the developers&#x27; work commenting they have &quot;done a fine job of taking Nintendo&#x27;s dated franchise and updating it for the new generation&quot; and summed up the general opinion by stating that &quot;For some, GX will be the ultimate racer. For others, it will be flat out too difficult.&quot; In Japan, &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; sold 100,981 units and became qualified for the Player&#x27;s Choice line in both Europe and North America by selling at least 250,000 copies. Nagoshi said in a 2018 &quot;Edge&quot; interview that &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide.

<text>Akshay Hari Om Bhatia (born Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia; 9 September 1967), known professionally as Akshay Kumar (), is an Indian actor and film producer working in Hindi cinema. Referred to in the media as &quot;Khiladi Kumar&quot;, through his career spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in over 150 films and has won several awards, including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards. He received the Padma Shri, India&#x27;s fourth-highest civilian honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar is one of the most prolific actors in Indian cinema. &quot;Forbes&quot; included Kumar in their lists of both highest-paid celebrities and highest-paid actors in the world from 2015 to 2020. Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only Indian on both lists.

Kumar began his career in 1991 with &quot;Saugandh&quot; and had his first commercial success a year later with the action thriller &quot;Khiladi&quot;. The film established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in the &quot;Khiladi&quot; film series, in addition to other action films such as &quot;Mohra&quot; (1994) and &quot;Jaanwar&quot; (1999). Although his early tryst with romance in &quot;Yeh Dillagi&quot; (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that Kumar expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the romantic films &quot;Dhadkan&quot; (2000), &quot;Andaaz&quot; (2003), &quot;Namastey London&quot; (2007), and for his slapstick comic performances in several films including &quot;Hera Pheri&quot; (2000), &quot;Mujhse Shaadi Karogi&quot; (2004), &quot;Phir Hera Pheri&quot; (2006), &quot;Bhool Bhulaiyaa&quot; (2007), and &quot;Singh Is Kinng&quot; (2008). Kumar won Filmfare Awards for his negative role in &quot;Ajnabee&quot; (2001) and his comic performance in &quot;Garam Masala&quot; (2005).

While his career had fluctuated commercially, his mainstream success soared in 2007 with four consecutive box-office hits; it was consistent until a short period of decline between 2009 and 2011, after which he reinforced his status with several films, including &quot;Rowdy Rathore&quot; (2012) and &quot;&quot; (2014). Moreover, around this time critical response to several of his films improved; his work in &quot;Special 26&quot; (2013), &quot;Baby&quot; (2015), &quot;Airlift&quot; (2016), and &quot;Jolly LLB 2&quot; (2017) was acclaimed, and he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the crime thriller &quot;Rustom&quot; (2016). He earned further notice for his self-produced social films &quot;&quot; (2017) and &quot;Pad Man&quot; (2018), as well as the war film &quot;Kesari&quot; (2019), and set box-office records in 2019 with &quot;Mission Mangal&quot;, &quot;Housefull 4&quot;, &quot;Good Newwz&quot;, and the 2021 action film &quot;Sooryavanshi&quot;. All of Kumar&#x27;s subsequent theatrical releases failed commercially, with the exception of the comedy-drama &quot;OMG 2&quot; (2023).

In addition to acting, Kumar has worked as a stunt actor. In 2008, he started hosting &quot;Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi&quot;, which he did for four seasons. He also launched the TV reality show &quot;Dare 2 Dance&quot; in 2014 and his off-screen work includes ownership of the team Khalsa Warriors in the World Kabaddi League. The actor had also set up martial arts training schools for women safety in the country. Kumar is one of the India&#x27;s most philanthropic actor and supports various charities. He is a leading brand endorser celebrity in India. From 2011 to 2023, he was a citizen of Canada.

== Early life and background ==
Kumar was born in Old Delhi in Delhi, India, to Hari Om Bhatia (later Brijmohan Bhatia) and Aruna Bhatia in a Punjabi Hindu family. His father was an army officer. From a young age, Kumar was very interested in sports. His father too enjoyed wrestling. He lived and grew up in Delhi&#x27;s Chandni Chowk and later he moved to Bombay (present-day Mumbai) when his father left Army to become an accountant with UNICEF. Soon, his sister was born and the family lived in Koliwada, a Punjabi dominated area of Central Bombay.

He received his school education from Don Bosco High School, Matunga, simultaneously learning Karate. He enrolled in Guru Nanak Khalsa College for higher education, but dropped out as he was not much interested in studies. He requested his father that he wanted to learn martial arts further, and his father somehow saved money to send him to Thailand. Kumar went to Bangkok to learn martial arts and lived in Thailand for five years learning Thai Boxing. Kumar also has a sister, Alka Bhatia. When Kumar was a teenager, his father asked him what he aspired to be. Kumar expressed his desire to become an actor.

After having obtained a black belt in Taekwondo while in India, he studied martial arts in Bangkok, Thailand, where he learned Muay Thai and worked as a chef and waiter. After Thailand, Kumar went to work in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) in a travel agency, in Dhaka in a hotel as a chef and Delhi where he sold Kundan jewellery. Upon his return to Bombay, he commenced the teaching of martial arts.

During this time, the father of one of his students, himself a model co-ordinator, recommended Kumar into modelling which ultimately led to a modelling assignment for a furniture showroom. Kumar effectively made more money within the first two days of shooting than in his entire month&#x27;s salary, and therefore chose a modelling career path. He worked as an assistant for photographer Jayesh Sheth for 18 months without payment to shoot his first portfolio. He also worked as a background dancer in various films.

Kumar made his first screen appearance with film Aaj under his birth name &#x27;Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia&#x27;, in a bit role as a Karate instructor. Kumar further stated that he changed his name to Akshay Hari Om Bhatia and chose his stage name as Akshay Kumar, after Kumar Gaurav&#x27;s character Akshay in the film.

One morning, he missed his flight for an ad-shoot in Bangalore. Disappointed with himself, he visited a film studio along with his portfolio. That evening, Kumar was signed for a lead role by producer Pramod Chakravarthy for the movie &quot;Deedar&quot;.

== Film career ==

=== 1991–1999: Debut, breakthrough and action films ===

Kumar made his first appearance as the lead actor opposite Raakhee and Shantipriya in &quot;Saugandh&quot; (1991). In the same year, he acted in Kishore Vyas-directed &quot;Dancer&quot;, which received poor reviews. The following year he starred in Abbas Mustan-directed suspense thriller, &quot;Khiladi&quot;, widely considered his breakthrough role. A review in &quot;The Indian Express&quot; called the film &quot;an engrossing thriller&quot; and described Kumar as impressive in the lead part, noting his physical appearance, strong screen presence, and commending him for being &quot;perfectly at ease&quot;. His next release was the Raj Sippy-directed detective film &quot;Mr. Bond&quot;, based on James Bond. His last release of 1992 was &quot;Deedar&quot;. It failed to perform well at the box office.

In 1993, he acted in the Keshu Ramsay-directed bilingual film &quot;Ashaant&quot; alongside Dr. Vishnuvardhan and Ashwini Bhave. Almost all of his films released during 1993, including &quot;Dil Ki Baazi&quot;, &quot;Kayda Kanoon&quot; and &quot;Sainik&quot; did not perform well commercially. In 1994, he appeared in 11 feature films. He played a police inspector in two films: Sameer Malkan&#x27;s &quot;Main Khiladi Tu Anari&quot; and Rajiv Rai&#x27;s &quot;Mohra&quot;, both among the highest-grossing films of the year. Further success came later that year when he starred in Yash Chopra-produced romance &quot;Yeh Dillagi&quot;, opposite Kajol. One of the year&#x27;s biggest mainstream successes, both the film and his performance were received well by critics, with &quot;The Indian Express&quot; describing him as &quot;always dependable&quot; and singling out his performance. His work in the film earned him his first nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare Awards and the Screen Awards. During the same year, Kumar also had success with films like &quot;Suhaag&quot; and the low-budget action film &quot;Elaan&quot;. All these achievements established Kumar as one of the most successful actors of the year, according to &quot;Box Office India&quot;.

Kumar proved to have success with what later became known as the &quot;Khiladi&quot; series. He starred in the fourth and fifth action thriller films with &quot;Khiladi&quot; in the title: &quot;Sabse Bada Khiladi&quot; (1995) and &quot;Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi&quot; (1996), both directed by Umesh Mehra and released to commercial success. He played a dual role in the former. &quot;Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi&quot; co-starred Rekha and Raveena Tandon. During the film&#x27;s shooting Kumar was injured, and went on to receive treatment in United States. Shubhra Gupta of &quot;The Indian Express&quot; wrote in a year-end review, &quot;It was Akshay Kumar in &quot;Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi&quot; who packed the aisles, no doubt about it... He shoved his hair back in a slick little ponytail, much like Steven Seagal, wore ankle-length great coats, wrestled with the fearsome Undertaker, and walked away with the film.&quot;

Kumar played a supporting role in Yash Chopra-directed musical romantic drama, &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; (1997), co-starring Shah Rukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor, for which he received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. In the same year, he starred opposite Juhi Chawla in David Dhawan-directed comedy &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Khiladi&quot;, fifth instalment of the &quot;Khiladi&quot; series. Unlike his previous films of the series, it failed commercially. Considerable success, however, came with another dual role in the romantic action film &quot;Aflatoon&quot;. Khalid Mohamed of &quot;Filmfare&quot;, while critical of the film, approved of Kumar&#x27;s effort: &quot;Akshay Kumar comes to life. Given something even slightly different to do, he does rise to the occasion.&quot; His following releases failed in commercial terms and this caused a setback to his film career. In 1999, Kumar played opposite Twinkle Khanna in &quot;International Khiladi&quot;. The film did not do well at the box office. He received critical acclaim for his roles in the films &quot;Sangharsh&quot; and &quot;Jaanwar&quot;. While the former did not make a profit at the box office, the latter turned out to be a commercial success and marked his comeback.

=== 2000–2006: &quot;Hera Pheri&quot; and expansion to comedy films ===

In 2000, Kumar starred in the Priyadarshan-directed comedy &quot;Hera Pheri&quot; alongside Paresh Rawal and Suneil Shetty. The film which was a remake of Malayalam film &quot;Ramji Rao Speaking&quot;, became a commercial success and proved to be a turning point in Kumar&#x27;s career. &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; noted the film&#x27;s &quot;intense portrayal of the surreality of the human condition&quot;. He also starred in the Dharmesh Darshan-directed romantic drama &quot;Dhadkan&quot; later that same year.

Kumar said of Pacino&#x27;s response: &quot;A touch of appreciation is always held dearly in an actor&#x27;s arms, even if it&#x27;s from the simplest of people like our beloved spot boys. But to have your work spoken of so kindly by the world&#x27;s most admired gangster Al Pacino himself – I had goose-bumps thinking about him watching the promo!

Anuj Kumar of The Hindu wrote &#x27;In order to tone down his body language and accent, Kumar has lost much of his trademark energy and could not develop the gravitas required to play the celebrated ruler.

Made on a budget of ₹200 crore, the film failed to recoup the massive investment and proved to be a disaster at the box office.

The &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; wrote &quot;Akshay Kumar got a golden opportunity in the film &quot;Ram Setu&quot; by Abhishek Sharma released on 25 October 2022, as his character is unlike anything he has done in the recent past. &quot;Ram Setu&quot; embraces the best of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; and National Treasure schools of storytelling with desi action&quot;.

Ganesh Aaglave of &quot;Firstpost&quot; stated, &quot;Akshay&#x27;s character as the messenger of Lord Shiva seems to be an extended cameo.

<text>Torres Strait Islanders ( ) are the Indigenous Melanesian people of the Torres Strait Islands, which are part of the state of Queensland, Australia. Ethnically distinct from the Aboriginal peoples of the rest of Australia, they are often grouped with them as Indigenous Australians. Today, many more Torres Strait Islander people live in mainland Australia (nearly 62,000) than on the Islands (about 4,500).

Five distinct peoples exist within the broader designation of Torres Strait Islander people, based partly on geographical and cultural divisions. Kalaw Lagaw Ya and Meriam Mir comprise the two main Indigenous language groups; Torres Strait Creole is also widely spoken as a language of trade and commerce. The core of Island culture is Papuo-Austronesian, and the people are traditionally a seafaring nation. The Torres Islanders exhibit a strong artistic culture, particularly in sculpture, printmaking, and mask-making.

==Demographics==

Of the 133 islands, only 38 are inhabited. The islands are culturally unique, with much to distinguish them from neighbouring Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and the Pacific Islands. Today the islands are multicultural, having attracted Asian and Pacific Island traders to the beche-de-mer, mother-of-pearl and trochus-shell industries over the years.

The 2016 Australian census counted 4,514 people living on the islands, of whom 91.8% were Torres Strait Islander or Aboriginal Australian people. (64% of the population identified as Torres Strait Islander; 8.3% as Aboriginal Australian; 6.5% as Papua New Guinean; 3.6% as other Australian and 2.6% as &quot;Maritime South-East Asian&quot;, etc.). In 2006 the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had reported 6,800 Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait area.

People identifying themselves as of Torres Strait Islander descent in the whole of Australia in the 2016 census numbered 32,345, while those with both Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal ancestry numbered a further 26,767 (compared with 29,515 and 17,811 respectively in 2006).

Five communities of Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal Australians live on the coast of mainland Queensland, mainly at Bamaga, Seisia, Injinoo, Umagico and New Mapoon in the Northern Peninsula area of Cape York.

In June 1875 a measles epidemic killed about 25% of the population, with some islands suffering losses of up to 80% of their people, as the islanders had no natural immunity to European diseases.

==Administration==
Until the late 20th century, Torres Strait Islanders had been administered by a system of elected councils, a system based partly on traditional pre-Christian local government and partly on the introduced mission management system.

Today, the Torres Strait Regional Authority, an Australian government body established in 1994 and consisting of 20 elected representatives, oversees the islands, with its primary function being to strengthen the economic, social and cultural development of the peoples of the Torres Strait area.

Further to the TSRA, there are several Queensland LGAs which administer areas occupied by Torres Strait Islander communities:
*the Torres Strait Island Region, covering a large proportion of the Islands;
*the Northern Peninsula Area Region, administered from Bamaga, on the northern tip of Cape York; and
*the Shire of Torres, which governs several islands as well as portions of Cape York Peninsula, is effectively colocated with the Northern Peninsula Area Region, which covers a number of Deed of Grant in Trust areas on the peninsula, and the Torres Strait Island Region and administers those sections of its area which are not autonomous.

==Ethnicity==

Torres Strait Islander people are of predominantly Melanesian descent, distinct from Aboriginal Australians on the mainland and some other Australian islands, and share some genetic and cultural traits with the people of New Guinea.

The five-pointed star on the national flag represents the five cultural groups; another source says that it originally represented the five groups of islands, but today (as of 2001) it represents the five major political divisions.

Pre-colonial Island people were not a homogeneous group and until then did not regard themselves as a single people. They have links with the people of Papua New Guinea, several islands being much closer to PNG than Australia, as well as the northern tip of Cape York on the Australian continent.

Sources are generally agreed that there are five distinct geographical and/or cultural divisions, but descriptions and naming of the groups differ widely.

*&quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;: the Eastern (Meriam, or Murray Island), Top Western (Guda Maluilgal), Near Western (Maluilgal), Central (Kulkalgal), and Inner Islands (Kaiwalagal).
*&quot;Multicultural Queensland 2001&quot; (a Queensland Government publication): five groups may be distinguished, based on linguistic and cultural differences, and also related to their places of origin, type of area of settlement, and long-standing relationships with other peoples. these nations are: Saibailgal (Top Western Islanders), Maluilgal (Mid-Western Islanders), Kaurareg (Lower Western Islanders), Kulkalgal (Central Islanders) and Meriam Le (Eastern Islanders).
*Torres Shire Council official website (Queensland Government): Five major island clusters – the Top Western Group (Boigu, Dauan and Saibai), the Near Western Group (Badu, Mabuiag and Moa), the Central Group (Yam, Warraber, Coconut and Masig), the Eastern Group (Murray, Darnley and Stephen), and the TI Group (Thursday Island, Tabar Island, Horn, Hammond, Prince of Wales and Friday).

Ethno-linguistic groups include:
*Badu people, based on the central-west Badu island
*Kaurareg, lower Western Islanders, based on the Muralag (Prince of Wales Island) group.
*Mabuiag (or Mabuygiwgal) people, across a number of the islands.
*Meriam people, who living on a number of inner eastern islands, including Murray Island (also known as Mer Island) and Tabar Island.

==Languages==
There are two distinct Indigenous languages spoken on the Islands, as well as a creole language.

The Western-central Torres Strait Language, or Kalaw Lagaw Ya, is spoken on the southwestern, western, northern and central islands; a further dialect, Kala Kawa Ya (Top Western and Western) may be distinguished. It is a member of the Pama-Nyungan family of languages of Australia.

Meriam Mir is spoken on the eastern islands. It is one of the four Eastern Trans-Fly languages, the other three being spoken in Papua New Guinea.

Torres Strait Creole, an English-based creole language, is also spoken.

==Culture==
Archaeological, linguistic and folk history evidence suggests that the core of Island culture is Papuo-Austronesian. The people have long been agriculturalists (evidenced, for example, by tobacco plantations on Aureed Island) as well as engaging in hunting and gathering. Dugong, turtles, crayfish, crabs, shellfish, reef fish and wild fruits and vegetables were traditionally hunted and collected and remain an important part of their subsistence lifestyle. Traditional foods play an important role in ceremonies and celebrations even when they do not live on the islands. Dugong and turtle hunting as well as fishing are seen as a way of continuing the Islander tradition of being closely associated with the sea. The islands have long history of trade and interactions with explorers from other parts of the globe, both east and west, which has influenced their lifestyle and culture.

The Indigenous people of the Torres Strait have a distinct culture which has slight variants on the different islands where they live. Cultural practices share similarities with Australian Aboriginal and Papuan culture. Historically, they have an oral tradition, with stories handed down and communicated through song, dance and ceremonial performance. As a seafaring people, sea, sky and land feature strongly in their stories and art.

===Post-colonisation===
Post-colonisation history has seen new cultural influences on the people, most notably the place of Christianity. After the &quot;Coming of Light&quot; (see below), artefacts previously important to their ceremonies lost their relevance, instead replaced by crucifixes and other symbols of Christianity. In some cases the missionaries prohibited the use of traditional sacred objects, and eventually production ceased. Missionaries, anthropologists and museums &quot;collected&quot; a huge amount of material: all of the pieces collected by missionary Samuel McFarlane, were in London and then split between three European museums and a number of mainland Australian museums.

In 1898–1899, British anthropologist Alfred Cort Haddon collected about 2000 objects, convinced that hundreds of art objects collected had to be saved from destruction by the zealous Christian missionaries intent on obliterating the religious traditions and ceremonies of the native islanders. Film footage of ceremonial dances was also collected. The collection at Cambridge University is known as the Haddon Collection and is the most comprehensive collection of Torres Strait Islander artefacts in the world.

During the first half of the 20th century, Torres Strait Islander culture was largely restricted to dance and song, weaving and producing a few items for particular festive occasions. In the 1960s and 1970s, researchers trying to salvage what was left of traditional knowledge from surviving elders influenced the revival of interest in the old ways of life. An Australian historian, Margaret Lawrie, employed by the Queensland State Library, spent much time travelling the Islands, speaking to local people and recording their stories, which have since influenced visual art on the Islands.

===Art===
 Mythology and culture, deeply influenced by the ocean and the natural life around the islands, have always informed traditional artforms. Featured strongly are turtles, fish, dugongs, sharks, seabirds and saltwater crocodiles, which are considered totemic beings.

Torres Strait Islander people are the only culture in the world to make turtleshell masks, known as &quot;krar&quot; (turtleshell) in the Western Islands and &quot;le-op&quot; (human face) in the Eastern Islands.

Prominent among the artforms is &quot;wame&quot; (alt. &quot;wameya&quot;), many different string figures.

Elaborate headdresses or dhari (also spelt &quot;dari&quot;), as featured on the Torres Strait Islander flag, are created for the purposes of ceremonial dances.

The Islands have a long tradition of woodcarving, creating masks and drums, and carving decorative features on these and other items for ceremonial use. From the 1970s, young artists were beginning their studies at around the same time that a significant re-connection to traditional myths and legends was happening. Margaret Lawrie&#x27;s publications, &quot;Myths and Legends of the Torres Strait&quot; (1970) and &quot;Tales from the Torres Strait&quot; (1972), reviving stories which had all but been forgotten, influenced the artists greatly. While some of these stories had been written down by Haddon after his 1898 expedition to the Torres Strait, many had subsequently fallen out of use or been forgotten.In the 1990s a group of younger artists, including the award-winning Dennis Nona (b.1973), started translating these skills into the more portable forms of printmaking, linocut and etching, as well as larger scale bronze sculptures. Other outstanding artists include Billy Missi (1970–2012), known for his decorated black and white linocuts of the local vegetation and eco-systems, and Alick Tipoti (b.1975). These and other Torres Strait artists have greatly expanded the forms of Indigenous art within Australia, bringing Melanesian carving skills as well as new stories and subject matter. The College of Technical and Further Education on Thursday Island was a starting point for young Islanders to pursue studies in art. Many went on to further art studies, especially in printmaking, initially in Cairns, Queensland and later at the Australian National University in what is now the School of Art and Design. Other artists such as Laurie Nona, Brian Robinson, David Bosun, Glen Mackie, Joemen Nona, Daniel O&#x27;Shane and Tommy Pau are known for their printmaking work.
An exhibition of Alick Tipoti&#x27;s work, titled &quot;Zugubal&quot;, was mounted at the Cairns Regional Gallery in July 2015.

===Music and dance===
For Torres Strait Islander people, singing and dancing is their &quot;literature&quot; – &quot;the most important aspect of Torres Strait lifestyle. The Torres Strait Islanders preserve and present their oral history through songs and dances;...the dances act as illustrative material and, of course, the dancer himself is the storyteller&quot; (Ephraim Bani, 1979). There are many songs about the weather; others about the myths and legends; life in the sea and totemic gods; and about important events. &quot;The dancing and its movements express the songs and acts as the illustrative material&quot;.

Dance is also major form of creative and competitive expression. &quot;Dance machines&quot; (hand held mechanical moving objects), clappers and headdresses (dhari/dari) enhance the dance performances. Dance artefacts used in the ceremonial performances relate to Islander traditions and clan identity, and each island group has its own performances.

Artist Ken Thaiday Snr is renowned for his elaborately sculptured dari, often with moving parts and incorporating the hammerhead shark, a powerful totem.

Christine Anu is an ARIA Award-winning singer-songwriter of Torres Strait Islander heritage, who first became popular with her cover version of the song &quot;My Island Home&quot; (first performed by the Warumpi Band).

=== Sports ===
Sports are popular among Torres Strait Islanders and the community has many sporting stars in Australian and international sports. Sporting events bring together people from across the different islands and help to connect the Torres Strait with mainland Australia and Papua New Guinea. Rugby league is especially popular, including the annual &#x27;Island of Origin&#x27; tournament between teams from different islands. Basketball is also extremely popular.

==Religion and beliefs==
The people still have their own traditional belief systems. Stories of the Tagai, their spiritual belief system, represent Torres Strait Islanders as sea people, with a connection to the stars, as well as a system of order in which everything has its place in the world. They follow the instructions of the Tagai.

Some Torres Strait Islander people share beliefs similar to the Aboriginal peoples&#x27; Dreaming and &quot;Everywhen&quot; concepts, passed down in oral history.

===Oral history===

One of the stories passed down in oral history tells of four brothers (&quot;bala&quot;) named Malo, Sagai, Kulka and Siu, who paddled their way up to the central and eastern islands from Cape York (&quot;Kay Daol Dai&quot;, meaning &quot;big land&quot;), and each established his own tribal following. Sagai landed at Iama Island (known as Yam), and after a time assumed a god-like status. The crocodile was his totem. Kulka settled on Aureed Island, and attained a similar status, as god of hunting. His totem was the fish known as &quot;gai gai&quot; (Trevally). Siu settled on Masig, becoming god of dancing, with the tiger shark (&quot;baidam&quot;) as his totem. The eldest brother, Malo, went on to Mer and became responsible for setting out a set of rules for living, a combination of religion and law, which were presented by Eddie Mabo in the famous Mabo native title case in 1992.

The cult of Kulka was in evidence on Aureed Island with the finding of a &quot;skull house&quot; by the rescuers of survivors two years after the wreck of &quot;Charles Eaton&quot;, in 1836.

===Introduction of Christianity===
From the 1870s, Christianity spread throughout the islands, and it remains strong today among Torres Strait Islander people everywhere. Christianity was first brought to the islands by the London Missionary Society (LMS) mission led by Rev. Samuel Macfarlane and Rev. Archibald Wright Murray, who arrived on Erub (Darnley Island) on 1 July 1871 on the schooner &quot;Surprise&quot;, a schooner chartered by the LMS. They sailed to the Torres Strait after the French Government had demanded the removal of the missionaries from the Loyalty Islands and New Caledonia in 1869. Eight teachers and their wives from Loyalty Islands arrived with the missionaries on the boat from Lifu.

Clan elder and warrior Dabad greeted them on their arrival. Ready to defend his land and people, Dabad walked to the water&#x27;s edge when McFarlane dropped to his knees and presented the Bible to Dabad. Dabad accepted the gift, interpreted as the &quot;Light&quot;, introducing Christianity to the Torres Strait Islands. The people of the Torres Strait Islands adopted the Christian rituals and ceremonies and continued to uphold their connection to the land, sea and sky, practising their traditional customs, and cultural identity referred to as &quot;Ailan Kastom&quot;.The Islanders refer to this event as &quot;The Coming of the Light&quot;, also known as Zulai Wan, or Bi Akarida, and all Island communities celebrate the occasion annually on 1 July. &quot;Coming of the Light&quot;, an episode in the 2013 documentary television series &quot;Desperate Measures&quot;, features the annual event.

However the coming of Christianity did not spell the end of the people&#x27;s traditional beliefs; their culture informed their understanding of the new religion, as the Christian God was welcomed and the new religion was integrated into every aspect of their everyday lives.

===Religious affiliation, 2016 census===
In the 2016 Census, a total of 20,658 Torres Strait Islander people (out of a total of 32,345) and 15,586 of both Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal identity (out of 26,767) reported adherence to some form of Christianity. (Across the whole of Australia, the Indigenous and non-Indigenous population were broadly similar with 54% (vs 55%) reporting a Christian affiliation, while less than 2% reported traditional beliefs as their religion, and 36% reported no religion.)

==Traditional adoptions==

A traditional cultural practice, known as &quot;kupai omasker&quot;, allows adoption of a child by a relative or community member for a range of reasons. The reasons differ depending on which of the many Torres Islander cultures the person belongs to, with one example being &quot;where a family requires an heir to carry on the important role of looking after land or being the caretaker of land&quot;. Other reasons might relate to &quot;the care and responsibility of relationships between generations&quot;.

There had been a problem in Queensland law, where such adoptions are not legally recognised by the state&#x27;s &quot;Succession Act 1981&quot;, with one issue being that adopted children are not able to take on the surname of their adoptive parents. On 17 July 2020 the Queensland Government introduced a bill in parliament to legally recognise the practice. The bill was passed as the &quot;Meriba Omasker Kaziw Kazipa Act 2020&quot; (&quot;For Our Children&#x27;s Children&quot;) on 8 September 2020.

<text>Ingleside is a suburb in Northern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Ingleside is located 28 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council. Ingleside Heights and Tumbledown Dick are localities in the west of the suburb.

The area is mostly semi-rural properties and bushland with increasing housing developments.

==History==
The suburb takes its name from a mansion in the area called Ingleside House, built in the 1880s by Baron von Bieren, an industrial chemist of Dutch and American background. He specialised in gunpowder and explosives, founding a factory called the Australian Gunpowder and Explosives Manufacturing Company. Powder Works Road takes its name from this factory.

==Population==
In the 2021 Census, there were 1,030 people in Ingleside. 72.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.6%, Italy 2.5%, and New Zealand 2.2%. 77.1% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian 3.0% and Serbian 2.2%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 34.8%, Catholic 25.8%, and Anglican 11.7%.

==Landmarks==
* The Sydney Baháʼí Temple, the world&#x27;s fourth Baháʼí House of Worship, was completed in 1961.
* The Smoky Dawson Ranch was the home of one of Australia&#x27;s most popular country music singers. The former ranch was sold to the HASG Armenian School. In 2002 the school opened a commemorative Smoky Dawson ranch-style gate, which has become a tourist attraction.
* DoggieRescue.com, an animal rescue and re-homing shelter started by Monika Biernacki.

<doc id="595822" wikidata="Q6555099" url="?curid=595822" title="Linux kernel mailing list">
<text>The Linux kernel mailing list (LKML) is the main electronic mailing list for Linux kernel development, where the majority of the announcements, discussions, debates, and flame wars over the kernel take place. Many other mailing lists exist to discuss the different subsystems and ports of the Linux kernel, but LKML is the principal communication channel among Linux kernel developers. It is a very high-volume list, usually receiving about 1,000 messages each day, most of which are kernel code patches.

Linux utilizes a workflow governed by LKML, which is the &quot;bazaar&quot; where kernel development takes place. In his book &quot;Linux Kernel Development&quot;, Robert Love notes:
The LKML functions as the central place where Linux developers around the world share patches, argue about implementation details, and discuss other issues. The official releases of the Linux kernel are indicated by an email to LKML. New features are discussed and most code is posted to the list before any action is taken. It is also the official place for reporting bugs in the Linux kernel, in case one cannot find the maintainer to whom the bug should be reported. Author Michelle Delio suggests that it was on LKML that Tux, the official Linux mascot, was suggested and refined, although the accuracy of her reporting in other stories has been disputed. Many companies associated with Linux kernel make announcements and proposals on LKML; for example, Novell, Intel, VMware, and IBM.

The list subscribers include all the Linux kernel maintainers as well as other known figures in Linux circles, such as Jeff V. Merkey and Eric S. Raymond. A 2000 study found that 14,535 people, from at least 30 countries, sent at least one email to LKML between 1995 and 2000 to participate in the discussion of Linux development.

Authors of books such as &quot;The Linux Kernel Development As A Model of Open Source Knowledge Creation&quot; and &quot;Motivation of Software Developers in Open Source Projects&quot;, and &quot;Recovering Device Drivers&quot; have made use of LKML for their research studies and surveys.

== Media coverage ==
The LWN.net website frequently covers discussion on the LKML, and the newsletter &quot;Kernel Traffic&quot; covered the activities of the LKML until November 2005. Many internet websites include archives of the mailing list, such as lore.kernel.org/lkml, lkml.org, mail-archive.com and marc.info.

== Linus Torvalds on LKML ==
Linus Torvalds is known for angrily disagreeing with other developers on the LKML. Calling himself a &quot;really unpleasant person&quot;, he later explained &quot;I&#x27;d like to be a nice person and curse less and encourage people to grow rather than telling them they are idiots. I&#x27;m sorryI tried, it&#x27;s just not in me.&quot;

His attitude, which Torvalds considers necessary for making his point clear, has drawn opposition from Intel programmer Sage Sharp and systemd developer Lennart Poettering, among others. In 2018 Torvalds took a break from kernel development to work on improving his behavior and instituted a code of conduct.

<doc id="595823" wikidata="Q2114345" url="?curid=595823" title="Pyrus × bretschneideri">
<text>Pyrus&quot; × &quot;bretschneideri (or &quot;Pyrus&quot; &quot;bretschneideri&quot;), the ya pear or pearple or Chinese white pear (), is an interspecific hybrid species of pear native to North China, where it is widely grown for its edible fruit.

Recent molecular genetic evidence confirms some relationship to the Siberian pear (&quot;Pyrus ussuriensis&quot;), but it can also be classified as a subspecies of the Chinese pear &quot;Pyrus pyrifolia&quot;.

Along with cultivars of &quot;P. pyrifolia&quot; and &quot;P. ussuriensis&quot;, the fruit is also called the nashi pear. These very juicy, white to light yellow pears, unlike the round Nashi pears (&quot;P. pyrifolia&quot;) that are also grown in eastern Asia, are shaped more like the European pear (&quot;Pyrus communis&quot;), narrow towards the stem end. The “Ya Li” (), literally &quot;duck pear&quot; due to its mallard-like shape, is one cultivar widely grown in China and exported around the world. Ya pears taste similar to a mild Bosc pear, but are crisp, with a higher water content and lower sugar content.

==Further hybridization==

<text>In mathematics, a Tschirnhaus transformation, also known as Tschirnhausen transformation, is a type of mapping on polynomials developed by Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus in 1683.

Simply, it is a method for transforming a polynomial equation of degree formula_1 with some nonzero intermediate coefficients, formula_2, such that some or all of the transformed intermediate coefficients, formula_3, are exactly zero.

For example, finding a substitutionformula_4for a cubic equation of degree formula_5,formula_6such that substituting formula_7 yields a new equationformula_8such that formula_9, formula_10, or both.

More generally, it may be defined conveniently by means of field theory, as the transformation on minimal polynomials implied by a different choice of primitive element. This is the most general transformation of an irreducible polynomial that takes a root to some rational function applied to that root.

== Definition ==
For a generic formula_11 degree reducible monic polynomial equation formula_12 of the form formula_13, where formula_14 and formula_15 are polynomials and formula_15 does not vanish at formula_17,formula_18the Tschirnhaus transformation is the function:formula_19Such that the new equation in formula_20, formula_21, has certain special properties, most commonly such that some coefficients, formula_22, are identically zero.

== Example: Tschirnhaus&#x27; method for cubic equations ==
In Tschirnhaus&#x27; 1683 paper, he solved the equation
formula_23
using the Tschirnhaus transformation
formula_24Substituting yields the transformed equationformula_25
or
formula_26Setting formula_9
yields,
formula_28
and finally the Tschirnhaus transformation
formula_29
which may be substituted into
formula_30
to yield an equation of the form:
formula_31
Tschirnhaus went on to describe how a Tschirnhaus transformation of the form:
formula_32
may be used to eliminate two coefficients in a similar way.

== Generalization ==
In detail, let formula_33 be a field, and formula_34 a polynomial over formula_33. If formula_36 is irreducible, then the quotient ring of the polynomial ring formula_37 by the principal ideal generated by formula_36,

:formula_39,

is a field extension of formula_33. We have

:formula_41

where formula_42 is formula_43 modulo formula_44. That is, any element of formula_45 is a polynomial in formula_42, which is thus a primitive element of formula_45. There will be other choices formula_48 of primitive element in formula_45: for any such choice of formula_48 we will have by definition:

:formula_51,

with polynomials formula_52 and formula_53 over formula_33. Now if formula_55 is the minimal polynomial for formula_48 over formula_33, we can call formula_55 a Tschirnhaus transformation of formula_36.

Therefore the set of all Tschirnhaus transformations of an irreducible polynomial is to be described as running over all ways of changing formula_36, but leaving formula_45 the same. This concept is used in reducing quintics to Bring–Jerrard form, for example. There is a connection with Galois theory, when formula_45 is a Galois extension of formula_33. The Galois group may then be considered as all the Tschirnhaus transformations of formula_36 to itself.

== History ==
In 1683, Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus published a method for rewriting a polynomial of degree formula_65 such that the formula_66 and formula_67 terms have zero coefficients. In his paper, Tschirnhaus referenced a method by René Descartes to reduce a quadratic polynomial formula_68 such that the formula_69 term has zero coefficient.

In 1786, this work was expanded by Erland Samuel Bring who showed that any generic quintic polynomial could be similarly reduced.

In 1834, George Jerrard further expanded Tschirnhaus&#x27; work by showing a Tschirnhaus transformation may be used to eliminate the formula_66, formula_67, and formula_72 for a general polynomial of degree formula_73.

<doc id="595831" wikidata="Q3313448" url="?curid=595831" title="Mike McMahon (American football)">
<text>Michael Edward McMahon (born February 8, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for five seasons in the National Football League (NFL), mostly serving in a backup role. He spent one season in the Canadian Football League (CFL), and one season in the United Football League (UFL). After playing college football for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, he was selected by the Detroit Lions in the fifth round of the 2001 NFL draft.

McMahon played for the Lions for four seasons from 2001 to 2004, and for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2005. McMahon played for the Toronto Argonauts and Montreal Alouettes of the CFL in 2007. He signed with the California Redwoods of the UFL in 2009 and played for the Virginia Destroyers from 2011 to 2012. He last played in Europe for the Uppsala 86ers of the Swedish Superserien in 2013.

==Early life==
McMahon played at North Allegheny High School in Wexford, Pennsylvania, where he became the starting quarterback during his senior year in 1996. He graduated in 1997. While in high school, he was featured in an &quot;NFL Films Presents&quot; episode as a potential next premiere quarterback to originate from Western Pennsylvania.

==College career==
McMahon attended college at Rutgers University. Though he started all four years (1997–2000), he sat out some games during the 1999 and 2000 seasons due to shoulder injuries. He participated in the 2000 Blue–Gray Football Classic and in the 2001 Senior Bowl. He left school as the all-time leader in passing and he was the first Scarlet Knight quarterback to be drafted in the NFL Draft.

==Professional career==
===Detroit Lions===
McMahon was drafted in the fifth round (149th overall) in the 2001 NFL draft by the Detroit Lions, who had traded their sixth- and seventh-round picks to the New England Patriots to take him. The Patriots used those picks to select tight end Arther Love and kicker Owen Pochman. McMahon began the 2001 season as the third-string quarterback behind starter Charlie Batch and backup Ty Detmer. However, after Batch suffered a season-ending injury during a December 2 game against the Chicago Bears, McMahon was inserted as the starting quarterback and served in that role for the Lions&#x27; first victory of the season against the Minnesota Vikings on December 16. He made seven total appearances and started three games for Detroit in his rookie campaign.

The Lions drafted University of Oregon quarterback Joey Harrington with the third overall pick in the 2002 NFL draft, but McMahon was named the starting quarterback to begin the 2002 season. After two straight losses as the starter, McMahon was benched in favor of Harrington before the third game of the season. McMahon took over in the last three games of the season due to Harrington having an irregular heartbeat. McMahon began the 2003 season as the backup to Harrington, and only saw action in two games during the season. The Lions re-signed McMahon to a one-year contract on April 1, 2004. In 2004, he was again the backup to Harrington, and played in one game to replace him.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
McMahon signed a two-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles on March 12, 2005, reuniting him with former Lions&#x27; head coach Marty Mornhinweg, who was now working as the Eagles&#x27; assistant head coach.

McMahon started the 2005 season as the third-string quarterback behind starter Donovan McNabb and backup Koy Detmer. With McNabb undergoing season-ending sports hernia surgery following a November 14 game against the Dallas Cowboys, McMahon took over the reins of the Eagles for the remainder of the season. On December 24, 2005, he became the first Eagles quarterback to rush for two touchdowns in a single game since Randall Cunningham in 1992. After taking over for McNabb, McMahon compiled a record of two wins and five losses in the games he started. His quarterback rating was 55.2 for the season. He was released on March 20, 2006, three days after the team signed quarterback Jeff Garcia.

===Minnesota Vikings===
McMahon was signed to a two-year contract by the Minnesota Vikings on March 23, 2006, a move which reunited him with then-Vikings head coach Brad Childress, who was previously the offensive coordinator in Philadelphia. McMahon lost a training camp battle for the third-string job with fellow quarterbacks Tarvaris Jackson and Brooks Bollinger. He was cut on September 2, 2006, after posting a 23.7 passer rating in the preseason, the second worst rating in the league. He was worked out by the Cleveland Browns a few days later but not signed.

===Canadian Football League===
On February 20, 2007, McMahon signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. McMahon started the 2007 CFL season as the third-string quarterback despite a strong showing in the preseason. However, an injury to Michael Bishop bumped McMahon to starting quarterback. His stint as a starter lasted only two games before being replaced by Damon Allen as the acting starting quarterback for the team.

On September 9, 2008, McMahon was traded to the Montréal Alouettes. In return, the Argonauts received a sixth round draft pick in the 2008 CFL draft (used to select WR Tyler Scott). McMahon was cut on October 15 without having appeared in a game.

===UFL and Europe===
McMahon signed with the California Redwoods of the United Football League in 2009, and played for the Virginia Destroyers from 2011 to 2012.

On March 28, 2013, McMahon signed with the Swedish team Uppsala 86ers of the Superserien.

On June 1, 2013, in the season opener against the Carlstad Crusaders, McMahon sustained injuries to several ligaments of the knee and was later ruled out for the season having taken only two snaps for his new team.

<text>Nevertire is a rural village in New South Wales, Australia. It is located at the junction of the Mitchell Highway and the Oxley Highway, in Warren Shire. Nevertire is about 496 kilometres northwest of Sydney, 78 km north-west of Narromine and about 107 km from Dubbo. It is about 20 km south-west of Warren on the western end of the Oxley Highway. At the 2011 census, Nevertire had a population of 225 people.

==History==
Originally the village was known as Warren Pond. The Main West railway line reached Nevertire in 1882 and the local pub was already trading before the town was surveyed in 1883. The town was devastated by a tornado on 28 December 1896. The town once had a railway station, operated by the State Rail Authority, but with the demise of country rail travel in the 1980s, the passenger services were replaced by a coach service run by CountryLink.

== Services ==
Nevertire is at the junction of the Main Western railway line to Nyngan and the branch line to Warren. The village is now served by three CountryLink Coach services: one to Bourke, one to Nyngan and one to Cobar/Broken Hill. Bourke Coach operates four times per week, the Broken Hill coach operates daily, and the Nyngan coach, which also serves Warren, operates four times per week.

There is a large grain handling facility on the railway line, operated by GrainCorp, and served by Pacific National trains. 
Local businesses also include a local pub (which is also the local post office), a cafe and store named The Rural Trader, welding services and a rural supplies outlet.

== Education ==
Nevertire Public school closed at the conclusion of the 2002 academic year, due to a lack of enrolments. Children in Nevertire now go to Warren Central School or St Mary&#x27;s in Warren.

The village is the subject of Betty Casey&#x27;s poem &quot;Nevertire&quot; and Henry Lawson once described it as the edge of the &quot;Great Grey Plain&quot;.

<text>Nsukka is a town and a Local Government Area in Enugu State, Nigeria. Nsukka shares a common border as a town with Edem, Opi (archaeological site), Ede-Oballa, and Obimo.

The postal code of the area is 410001 and 410002 respectively, referring to University of Nigeria Campus, and Nsukka Urban.

== History ==
Nsukka is made up of Mkpunano, Nru, and Ihe&#x27;n Owerre. Presently, there is an erroneous trend of referring to all the towns under Enugu North Senatorial Zone as Nsukka. This trend could be as a result of Nsukka housing the headquarters of the now defunct Nsukka province under the colonial rule.

Nsukka is also a local government area and comprises several towns including Nsukka the host to the first indigenous university in Nigeria, the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN).

Nsukka is an agricultural-trade centre for the yams, cassava (manioc), corn (maize), taro, pigeon peas, and palm oil and kernels produced by the local Igbo (Ibo) people. Weaving is a traditional local craft. Coal deposits have been discovered east of Nsukka around Obolo, a town on the main Onitsha-Makurdi road.

People in Nsukka speak central Igbo and Nsukka dialect, a sub-dialect of larger Igbo language.

The influence of Nsukka people was felt as far as Idah, the Achadu Oko Attah clan in Idah historically migrated from Nsukka.
===Ancient wars===
Nsukka in the 18th and 19th century had one of the best fighting forces in what is present-day Enugu North, which they employed in waging war against their neighbours in order to gain more territories for their rising population, among other reasons. Each community that made up the town of Nsukka had stationed in them a fighting force made up of people from that community.

Nsukka&#x27;s numerous wars with her neighbours were usually successful such that some surrounding communities requested help from Nsukka to protect them from their attackers.

An instance of Nsukka&#x27;s expansionist bid was the war with Ejuona-Obukpa (a community in Obukpa) which eventually ended in the annexing of a part of Ejuona-Obukpa. According to D. C. Ugwu, this war should not be viewed as one between Nsukka and the entire Obukpa as Ejuona (the involved community) refused the assistance of the rest of Obukpa. By the time the war ended, Nsukka succeeded in taking parts of Ejuona-Obukpa, almost wiping out one village (Umugboguru) of all its inhabitants in the process.
Nsukka is the second largest town in Enugu state. The people of Nsukka are deeply religious and most of the indigenes of this geographical area are traditional religion adherents. They celebrate a popular masquerade festival known as &quot;Omabe festival&quot; every year. The essence of the festival is show the indigenes&#x27; reverence for their Chi (i.e. Personal god). Also, the Omabe festival enables them to strengthen the relationship between different communities that made up of this geographical area. The Omabe is notable for its magical and stylistic displays.
==Climate==
== Culture ==
=== &quot;Eshu&quot; (cow) funeral rituals ===

&quot;Eshu&quot; is an Igbo breed of cow used in a funeral rite in the Nsukka cultural area of Igboland. Many factors influence if someone will receive funeral rites, such as how and when they die, their marital status, and if they performed the same rites for their own parents. If someone qualifies, then the rite is performed to ensure that the dead can rest peacefully and to lift them to a higher position within the spirit world. There are many animals which can be used and each animal has a different significance. The cow is the highest ranked among those used in the ritual.

=== Ndishi tradition ===
In traditional Igbo society, men&#x27;s dominance was total. Women were to be seen but not to be heard: it was a man&#x27;s world. Whether in the day to day governance, economic activities, religion, among others, women played a peripheral role in the society. A man could marry as many wives as he wants. The younger wives could be the age mates of his first set of children. Whether the husband is virile enough to satisfy the innumerable wives is hardly taken into consideration. To check marital infidelity on the part of the women in this polygamous society, the Nsukka Igbo instituted the Ndishi/Nna tradition.  The Ndishi/Nna tradition connotes a spiritual avowal among the Nsukka people which origin is embedded in myth. The tradition forbids any married woman from engaging in any form of extra-marital affairs or assisting the relations without express permission of the husband. Women from other parts of Igboland who are married to the men of this area are usually forewarned about the efficacy of this tradition. It is the general belief among the people that any such act attracts the wrath of the gods, which results to instant madness for the transgressor. Employing qualitative approach which includes, participant observation, indepth interviews and oral tradition, the researchers explored the potency of this tradition in checking marital infidelity.  Enugu-Ezike, Obollo, and Imilike communities which have distinct cultural practices among Nsukka people were selected for the study. Johannes Andenaees&#x27;s theory of punishment and deterrence would be applied.
=== Masquerade ===

Nsukka is known to be rich in tradition and it is one of the Igbo communities that still upholds her traditional practices especially the masquerade festival. These masquerades comes in different colors and shapes, some are beautifully made while some are tattered. The Nsukka masquerade assumes different names in different communities. In Obollo Afor, it is called Akatakpa; in Igbo Etiti, it is known as Odo; in Orba it is known as Ogede; in Nsukka, it is called Oriokpa or Omaba. In olden days, masquerades were a rallying point as they performed different functions ranging from entertainment to peace making, social control, and it was also used for security purposes.

<doc id="595848" wikidata="Q6724994" url="?curid=595848" title="Macquarie Marshes Nature Reserve">
<text>The Macquarie Marshes Nature Reserve is a protected natural wetland reserve that is located within the Macquarie Marshes, in the region along the lower Macquarie River in northwestern New South Wales, Australia. The reserve is situated approximately northwest of Sydney and north of .

The Macquarie Marshes Nature Reserve is the core of the Macquarie Marshes. It is the area most frequently flooded and contains samples of all the habitat types present in the Marshes. Nevertheless, there are large and significant wetland areas outside the nature reserve, including extensive river red gum areas and some of the largest rookeries in the Marshes.

==Natural significance==

The marshes are created by irregular flooding of the flat lands along the river. The nature reserve extends over an area of almost , approximately 10% of the Macquarie Marshes floodplain. It consists of two main reserves, the North and South Marsh, and a third small reserve. The North and South Marsh Nature Reserves were listed as a wetland of international importance in 1986 under the Ramsar Convention of 1971. The Macquarie Marshes are also listed on the Register of the National Estate, the Register of the National Trust of Australia, and the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia. The reserve is part of the Macquarie Marshes Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance as a breeding site for waterbirds.

===Flora and fauna===
The wetlands contain a wide range of vegetation types, primarily determined by the frequency and duration of flooding. The dominant types are river red gum forest and woodland, as well as extensive beds of common reed. Various vegetation associations are found throughout the wetlands, providing habitat for many species of waterbird, as well as other wildlife including 211 bird species, 8 species of native mammal, 15 frog, 56 reptile and 24 native fish species. The wetlands are one of the most important breeding sites in Australia for intermediate egret and straw-necked ibis. A number of birds are listed as vulnerable or threatened including the magpie goose, blue-billed duck, freckled duck, Australasian bittern, brolga, painted snipe, osprey, glossy black cockatoo, turquoise parrot, square-tailed kite and Major Mitchell&#x27;s cockatoo.

===Threats===
The nature reserve covers only a small part of the marsh area. The rest of it is private agricultural holdings, utilised for the grazing of cattle and sheep, and cropping. The frequency and extent of the flooding required to sustain the marshes is threatened by increasing extraction of water from the Macquarie River for crop irrigation upstream from the marshes. An environmental trust has been established in order to attract widespread community support.

<doc id="595849" wikidata="Q8043909" url="?curid=595849" title="Xerox Daybreak">
<text>Xerox Daybreak (also Xerox 6085 PCS, Xerox 1186) is a workstation computer marketed by Xerox from 1985 to 1989.

==Overview==

Daybreak is the final release in the D* (pronounced D-Star) series of machines, some of which share the Wildflower CPU design by Butler Lampson. Machines in this series include, in order, Dolphin, Dorado, Dicentra, Dandelion, Dandetiger, Daybreak, the never-manufactured Daisy, and Dragonfly &quot;a 4-processor VLSI CPU developed at PARC and intended for a high-end printing system&quot;.

It was sold as the Xerox 6085 PCS (Professional Computer System) or ViewPoint 6085 PCS when sold as an office workstation running the ViewPoint system. ViewPoint is based on the Star software originally developed for the Xerox Star. The 6085 ran the ViewPoint (later GlobalView) GUI and was used extensively throughout Xerox until being replaced by Suns and PCs. Although years ahead of its time, it was never a commercial success. The proprietary closed architecture and Xerox&#x27;s reluctance to release the Mesa development environment for general use stifled any third-party development.

A fully configured 6085 came with an 80 MB hard disk, 3.7 MB of RAM, a 5¼-inch floppy disk drive, an Ethernet controller, and a PC emulator card containing an 80186 CPU. The basic system comes with 1.1 MB of RAM and a 10 MB hard disk. It was introduced in 1985 at .
The Daybreak was also sold as a Xerox 1186 workstation when configured as a Lisp machine.

Xerox also produced the Xerox Encryption Unit, intended to &quot;sit atop a Xerox 6085 workstation processor&quot; but reportedly usable by workstations and personal computers in general, for the encryption of IEEE 802.3 and Ethernet local area network traffic in government computing environments.

<text>Mitchell Highway is an outback state highway located in the central and south western regions of Queensland and the northern and central western regions of New South Wales in Australia. The southern part of Mitchell Highway forms part of the National Highway A32 B71 corridor, which stretches from Sydney to Brisbane via Dubbo. Mitchell Highway also forms part of the shortest route between Sydney and , via and Mount Isa, making it an important road link for the transport of passengers and freight for regional New South Wales and Queensland. The highway is a part of route Alternative A2 between Augathella and Charleville, route A71 and B71 between Charleville and Nyngan, and part of route A32 between Nyngan and Bathurst.

In New South Wales, the highway&#x27;s south-eastern terminus is at its junction with Great Western and Mid-Western Highways, and it links with Golden, Newell, Oxley, Barrier and Kamilaroi Highways. In Queensland, the highway links with Balonne and Warrego Highways and its northern terminus is at its junction with Landsborough Highway.

==Route==
Mitchell Highway lies west of the Great Dividing Range and in New South Wales runs generally northwest–southeast and in Queensland, runs generally north–south in the central western and southwest parts of that state.

From its northern terminus at a junction with the Landsborough Highway near Augathella, Mitchell Highway heads south as route Alternative A2 through Charleville, meeting Warrego Highway heading east as Alternative A2. As route A71, the highway continues south through , meeting with Balonne Highway, and then further south to the state border between Queensland and New South Wales (called Barringun Road), where it changes to route B71.Approximately north of it crosses the Darling River before heading into Bourke where it forms junctions with Kamilaroi Highway heading east and Kidman Way heading south. From this point Mitchell Highway generally heads southeast through to Nyngan, meeting with Barrier Highway, and continues south as route A32. At the highway meets Oxley Highway, before passing through and then heads generally east to the major rural centre of Dubbo, where it meets Newell Highway, before it crosses the Macquarie River and heads south towards , crossing the Macquarie River again. At , the highway generally starts to head east towards , where an alternative route diverts many heavy vehicles away from the city centre; the portion of Mitchell Highway that passes through Orange city centre is known locally as Summer Street. The southern terminus of Mitchell Highway is at a roundabout in Bathurst, at the junction of Mid-Western Highway to , and Great Western Highway to Sydney via the Blue Mountains.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board. North-Western Highway was declared (as Main Road No. 7) on 8 August 1928, from the interchange with Great Western Highway and Mid-Western Highway in Bathurst, via Orange, Dubbo, Nyngan, and Bourke, to the border with Queensland; with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to State Highway 7 on 8 April 1929. On 9 October 1936 the name was changed to Mitchell Highway, in honour of Lieutenant Colonel Sir Thomas Mitchell, who was Surveyor-General of New South Wales in the 1820s and explored much of inland New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Mitchell Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 71, from the state border with Queensland at Barringun to the intersection with Great Western and Mid-Western Highways at Bathurst.

Mitchel Highway was signed National Route 71 between Augathella and Nygan, and National Route 32 between Nyngan and Bathurst, in 1955. With both states&#x27; conversion to their newer alphanumeric systems in 2004 and 2013, its former route numbers were updated to Alternative A2 between Augathella and Charleville and A71 between Charleville and the state border within Queensland in 2004, and B71 between the state border and Nyngan and A32 between Nyngan and Bathurst within New South Wales in 2013.

===Truck explosion===
On 5 September 2014, a truck travelling on Mitchell Highway rolled off a road bridge at Angellala Creek approximately 30 km south of Charleville (). The truck was carrying 52 tonnes of ammonium nitrate which exploded. The blast destroyed the two road bridges and severely damaged the adjacent rail bridge. The blast was so powerful that the truck was disintegrated and the dangers posed by the remaining ammonium nitrate necessitated a 2 km exclusion zone around the site for a number of days. The large crater formed by the blast closed the highway necessitating detours of up to 600 km. The Department of Transport and Mains Road was allowed to commence work at the site on 13 September and by 23 September had constructed a temporary side track around the blast site suitable for cars, buses and light trucks. By 7 October, the side track had been upgraded to support road trains, ending the need to detour. In April 2015, the $10 million tender to reconstruct the highway and bridges were awarded and the construction work took place between June and November 2015. In early 2016, a competition was held to decide a new name for the bridge.

<text>The LHTEC T800 is a turboshaft engine for rotary wing applications. It is produced by the LHTEC (Light Helicopter Turbine Engine Company), a joint venture between Rolls-Royce and Honeywell. The commercial and export version is the CTS800. The engine was primarily developed for the United States Army&#x27;s cancelled RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter, but has found use in other applications.

==Design and development==
The engine was originally developed for the United States Army&#x27;s LHX armed reconnaissance helicopter competition, competing against the Avco/Pratt &amp; Whitney T800. The LHTEC T800 was selected to power the LHX in 1988. The Boeing-Sikorsky team was selected to build the RAH-66 Comanche in 1991. A pair of T800-powered RAH-66 prototypes were constructed and underwent flight testing between 1996 and 2004. The LHX program was canceled in 2004, primarily due to cost overruns during its lengthy development, and the US Army&#x27;s changing requirements.

==Applications==
* AgustaWestland Super Lynx 300 (CTS800-4N)
* AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat (CTS800-4N)
* Ayres LM200 Loadmaster (LHTEC CTP800-4T) (aircraft not built)

<doc id="595864" wikidata="Q1837775" url="?curid=595864" title="Jackie Collins">
<text>Jacqueline Jill Collins (4 October 1937 – 19 September 2015) was an English romance novelist and actress. She moved to Los Angeles in 1985 and spent most of her career there. She wrote 32 novels, all of which appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list. Her books have sold more than 500 million copies and have been translated into 40 languages. Eight of her novels have been adapted for the screen, either as films or television miniseries. She was the younger sister of Dame Joan Collins.

==Early life==
Collins was born in 1937, in Hampstead, London, the younger daughter of Elsa (née Bessant) Collins (died 1962) and Joseph William Collins (died 1988), a theatrical agent whose clients later included Dame Shirley Bassey, the Beatles, and Sir Tom Jones.

Collins&#x27;s South African-born father was Jewish, and her British mother was Anglican. A middle child, Collins had an elder sister, Joan Collins (actress and author), and a younger brother, Bill (who became a property agent).

Collins attended Francis Holland School, an independent day school for girls in London and was expelled at age 15. During this period, she reportedly had a brief affair with 29-year-old Marlon Brando.

==Early career==
In 1956, Collins visited her older sister, Joan, who was then based in Los Angeles. She returned to London after failing to gain a U.S. work permit to enable her to be groomed for stardom at 20th Century Fox. Collins began appearing in acting roles in a series of British B movies. These included &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; (1957), &quot;Rock You Sinners&quot; (1957), &quot;The Safecracker&quot; (1958), &quot;Intent to Kill&quot; (1958), &quot;Passport to Shame&quot; (1958), and &quot;The Shakedown&quot; (1960), in which she was credited as Lynn Curtis. After minor appearances in such television series as &quot;Danger Man&quot; and &quot;The Saint&quot;, Collins gave up on pursuing an acting career, although she did play briefly on the television series &quot;Minder&quot; in 1980.

Her first book, &quot;The World Is Full of Married Men&quot; (1968), became a best-seller. Four decades later, she admitted she was a &quot;school dropout&quot; and &quot;juvenile delinquent&quot; when she was 15: &quot;I&#x27;m glad I got all of that out of my system at an early age,&quot; she said, adding that she &quot;never pretended to be a literary writer.&quot;

==Writing career==

===1960s===
Collins later said that she always wanted to write, not act. By the age of 13 classmates paid to listen to sex scenes she wrote. Collins began many works of fiction but abandoned them, and only completed her first novel after being persuaded to do so by her second husband Oscar Lerman. &quot;You&#x27;re a storyteller&quot;, he told her. After the publication of her first novel &quot;The World Is Full of Married Men&quot;, romantic novelist Barbara Cartland called the book &quot;nasty, filthy and disgusting&quot;, and charged Collins with &quot;creating every pervert in Britain&quot;. The book was banned in Australia and South Africa, but the scandal bolstered sales in the United States and the UK.

Her second novel, &quot;The Stud&quot;, was published in 1969. It also made the best-seller lists.

===1970s===
By the 1970s Collins was a peer of successful male airport novel authors like Sidney Sheldon and Harold Robbins.. Her third novel, &quot;Sunday Simmons &amp; Charlie Brick&quot; (first published under the title &quot;The Hollywood Zoo&quot; in the UK and then retitled &quot;Sinners&quot; worldwide in 1984) was published in 1971 and again made the best-seller lists. This was Collins&#x27;s first novel to be set in the United States.

&quot;Lovehead&quot; followed in 1974 (retitled as &quot;The Love Killers&quot; in 1989). This novel was Collins&#x27;s first foray into the world of organized crime, a genre that would later prove to be extremely successful for her.

Following this, Collins published &quot;The World Is Full of Divorced Women&quot; (unrelated to her first novel) in 1975, and then &quot;Lovers &amp; Gamblers&quot; in 1977, which told the story of rock/soul superstar Al King.

In the late 1970s, Collins made a foray into writing for the screen. She co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Stud&quot; (1978), based on her second book; the film starred her older sister Joan as the gold-digging adulteress Fontaine Khaled. Following this, Collins wrote the screenplay for &quot;The World Is Full of Married Men&quot; (1980), the film adaptation of her first novel. She also released her seventh novel, &quot;The Bitch&quot; (1979), a sequel to &quot;The Stud&quot;; &quot;The Bitch&quot; was also made into a successful 1979 film, with Joan Collins reprising the role. Around the same time, Collins wrote an original screenplay (not based on any of her novels) for the film &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Hero&quot; (1979).

===1980s===
In the 1980s, Collins and her family moved to Los Angeles on a full-time basis, where she would continue to write about the &quot;rich and famous&quot;. She said, &quot;If you wish to be successful, there is a place you should be at a certain time. And Los Angeles in the 1980s was it.&quot;

Her next novel was &quot;Chances&quot; (1981). It introduced one of her best-known characters, Lucky Santangelo, the &quot;dangerously beautiful&quot; daughter of a gangster.

While living in the hills above Sunset Boulevard, Collins collected the knowledge and experience to write her most commercially successful novel, &quot;Hollywood Wives&quot; (1983), which hit &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller list at number one. Marketed as a &quot;scandalous exposé&quot;, the novel sold over 15 million copies and placed Collins in a powerful position, making her a celebrity of near equal status to her sister Joan, whose own career had taken an upwards direction with her role in the television drama &quot;Dynasty&quot;.

In 1985, &quot;Hollywood Wives&quot; was made into a television miniseries, produced by Aaron Spelling and starring Candice Bergen, Stefanie Powers, Angie Dickinson, Anthony Hopkins, Suzanne Somers, and Rod Steiger. Although credited as a &quot;creative consultant&quot;, Collins later stated that she was never consulted during production and that she did not agree with some of the casting choices.

She then went on to write the sequel to &quot;Chances&quot;, titled &quot;Lucky&quot; (1985), followed by &quot;Hollywood Husbands&quot; (1986) and &quot;Rock Star&quot; (1988).

===1990s===
In 1990, Collins published her third Lucky Santangelo novel, &quot;Lady Boss&quot;, and wrote and co-produced the television miniseries &quot;Lucky Chances&quot;, which combined her first two Lucky Santangelo novels and starred Nicollette Sheridan (in the lead role) and Sandra Bullock.

In 1992, Collins was widowed when her husband of 26 years, Oscar Lerman, died of cancer. Around this time, she wrote and produced another miniseries based on the &quot;Lady Boss&quot; novel, with Kim Delaney playing the lead role. Collins&#x27;s run of best-sellers continued with &quot;American Star&quot; (1993), &quot;Hollywood Kids&quot; (1994), and the fourth Santangelo novel, &quot;&quot; (1996).

She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1993, when she was surprised by Michael Aspel.

In 1998, she made a foray into talk show television with the series &quot;Jackie Collins&#x27; Hollywood&quot;, but this was unsuccessful. She also published the novel &quot;Thrill&quot; (1998) and wrote a four-part series of mini-novels, called &quot;L.A. Connections&quot;, to be released in a newspaper every six weeks and which introduced a new heroine in the form of investigative journalist Madison Castelli. The fifth Lucky Santangelo novel, &quot;Dangerous Kiss&quot;, was published in 1999.

===2000s===
The 2000s turned out to be Collins&#x27;s busiest time; she published eight best-sellers, more than in any other decade in her career. In 2000, Collins brought back the character of Madison Castelli in a new novel, &quot;Lethal Seduction&quot;. In 2001, she published &quot;Hollywood Wives: The New Generation&quot;, which was adapted as a 2003 television movie starring Farrah Fawcett, Melissa Gilbert, and Robin Givens. (Collins was credited as an executive producer.) A new Madison Castelli novel, &quot;Deadly Embrace&quot;, was published in 2002, and &quot;Hollywood Divorces&quot; was published in 2003. In 2004, Collins hosted a series of television specials, &quot;Jackie Collins Presents&quot;, for E! Entertainment Television.
Collins continued with &quot;Lovers &amp; Players&quot; (2006); the sixth Lucky Santangelo novel, &quot;Drop Dead Beautiful&quot; (2007); and &quot;Married Lovers&quot; (2008), which concerns the affairs of a female personal trainer named Cameron Paradise. This was followed by &quot;Poor Little Bitch Girl&quot; (2009), which stemmed from an idea Collins had worked on for a television series about heiresses that was ultimately never made.

===2010s===
&quot;Paris Connections&quot; (2010), a direct-to-DVD movie adapted from Collins&#x27;s &quot;L.A. Connections&quot; series of mini-novels, was made by Amber Entertainment in association with the UK supermarket chain Tesco. The movie stars Charles Dance, Trudie Styler, and Nicole Steinwedell (as Madison Castelli). Collins served as co-producer, and three more &quot;Connections&quot; movies with the Madison Castelli character are planned.

Collins continued to write Lucky Santangelo books, including &quot;Goddess of Vengeance&quot;. Her 29th novel, titled &quot;The Power Trip&quot;, was published in February 2013. &quot;Confessions of a Wild Child&quot;, was published in February 2014, with a movie deal announced even before the book came out.

Collins&#x27;s cookbook, &quot;The Lucky Santangelo Cookbook&quot; (2014), is named after the protagonist of nine Collins novels, who is often portrayed preparing elaborate gastronomic creations for her intimates (and who watched her father throw a plate of food at her mother as a child). Collins&#x27;s final novel was &quot;The Santangelos&quot; (2015), a conclusion to the Santangelo series she had begun with &quot;Chances&quot; (1981).

==Personal life==
Collins held dual citizenship: British (by birth) and U.S. (by naturalization, from 6 May 1960). She married her first husband, Wallace Austin, in 1960; they divorced in 1964. Austin&#x27;s addiction to drugs prescribed for manic depression ultimately caused their separation, and he died from a deliberate overdose the year after their marriage ended. The couple had one daughter, Tracy, born in 1961.

In 1965, Collins married again, this time to American art gallery and nightclub (&quot;Ad-Lib&quot; and Tramp) owner, Oscar Lerman, who was 18 years her senior. The wedding took place in the home of her sister Joan and her husband at the time, Anthony Newley. Collins and Lerman had two daughters, Tiffany (born 1967) and Rory (born 1969). Lerman also formally adopted Collins&#x27;s daughter, Tracy, from her previous marriage. Lerman died in 1992 from prostate cancer.

In 1994, Collins became engaged to Los Angeles business executive Frank Calcagnini, who died in 1998 from a brain tumor. She said that what got her through the tragedies of losing two loved ones was &quot;celebrating their lives, as opposed to dwelling on their deaths.&quot;

In 2011, when asked if she were dating anyone, Collins said: &quot;I have a man for every occasion&quot;, adding:

She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to fiction and charity.

Throughout Collins&#x27;s career she intentionally promoted a flamboyant public image, both to market her books and to protect her quieter private life. She claimed to have only had Botox once (&quot;I hated it&quot;), and avoided salons and buying new clothes; hobbies were television (Collins owned four TiVos) and Tweeting. Collins fictionalized aspects of her personal life as a source for her novels. She said she loved Los Angeles and recalled that while growing up in England, she often read novels by Robbins, Mickey Spillane, and Raymond Chandler. Dominick Dunne wrote that Collins &quot;loved the picture business, the television business, the record business, and the people in them, the stars, celebrities, directors, and producers&quot;. Although she was a &quot;great partygoer&quot;, he said, she went to them &quot;more as an observer than participant&quot;, using them as part of her research. &quot;Write about what you know&quot;, Collins said at a writer&#x27;s conference. &quot;I love what I do. I fall in love with my characters. They become me, and I become them&quot;.

==Death==
Collins died on 19 September 2015, of breast cancer. She had been diagnosed with stage-4 breast cancer more than six years before her death but kept her illness almost entirely to herself. She reportedly informed her sister Joan Collins two weeks before she died and flew from Los Angeles to London to appear on the ITV chat show &quot;Loose Women&quot; nine days before her death.

<doc id="595866" wikidata="Q2289734" url="?curid=595866" title="Gilgal">
<text>Gilgal ( &quot;Gilgāl&quot;), also known as Galgala or Galgalatokai of the 12 Stones ( or , &quot;Dōdekalithōn&quot;), is the name of one or more places in the Hebrew Bible. Gilgal is mentioned 39 times, in particular in the Book of Joshua, as the place where the Israelites camped after crossing the Jordan River (Joshua 4:19 – 5:12). 

The Hebrew term &quot;Gilgal&quot; most likely means &quot;circle of stones&quot;. Its name appears in Koine Greek on the Madaba Map.

==Places named Gilgal in the Bible==
===In Joshua 4–5===

According to Joshua 4:19, Gilgal is a location &quot;on the eastern border of Jericho&quot; where the Israelites encamped immediately after crossing the Jordan River. There, they erected twelve stones as a memorial to the miraculous stopping of the river when they crossed. Joshua then ordered the Israelites who had been born during the Exodus to be circumcised at this spot. The Bible refers to this place as &quot;Givat Ha&#x27;aralot&quot;, then says that Joshua called the place Gilgal because, in his words, &quot;today I have removed (&quot;galoti&quot;) the shame of Egypt from upon you.&quot;

Some scholars speculate that the circle of 12 stones was the (unnamed) religious sanctuary that was condemned in Amos 4:4 and 5:5 and Hosea 4:15.
===Elsewhere in Joshua===
&quot;The king of Goyim, of Gilgal&quot; is listed as one of the 31 kings defeated by Joshua. His city is identified by Eusebius with Jaljulia.

&quot;In fact, the King of Goim was defeated in Gilgal of Jericho, that is, the name of his city was not Gilgal (Joshua 12:23)

&quot;Gilgal&quot; is mentioned as a location on the border between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, near Ma&#x27;ale Adumim.

===In Deuteronomy===
In the Book of Deuteronomy 11:29–30, Gilgal is a place across from Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal.

===In the Book of Samuel===
A place named Gilgal was included in Samuel&#x27;s annual circuit, and is the location where he offered sacrifices after Saul was anointed as king, and where he renewed Saul&#x27;s kingship together with the people.

In 1 Samuel 15, Gilgal is where Samuel hewed King Agag in pieces after Saul refused to obey God and utterly destroy the Amalekites.

On King David&#x27;s return to Jerusalem after the death of his son Absalom (2 Samuel 19), David traveled to Gilgal. From there he was escorted to Jerusalem by the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.

Again it is possible for this to be yet another &quot;circle of standing stones&quot; (or the same one as mentioned in relation to Elijah and Elisha, as Bethel is on the circuit with Gilgal, and other assumed locations show Gilgal to be far further away than the other two locations), and it is significant that it is treated as a holy place by the biblical text, rather than as a heathen one.

===In the Book of Kings===
In the Books of Kings, &quot;Gilgal&quot; is mentioned as the home of a company of prophets. The text states that Elijah and Elisha came from Gilgal to Bethel, and then onward to Jericho and to the Jordan, suggesting that the place was in the vicinity of Bethel, and far from Joshua&#x27;s Gilgal near Jericho.

Since &quot;Gilgal&quot; means a &quot;circle of standing stones&quot;, it is quite plausible for there to have been more than one place named Gilgal, and although there are dissenting opinions, it is commonly held to be a different place from the one involved with Joshua; it has been identified with the village Jaljulia, about north of Bethel. It is significant that the Books of Kings treat it as a place of holiness, suggesting that stone circles still had a positive religious value at the time the source text of the passages in question was written, rather than having been condemned as heathen by religious reforms. Another opinion is that it is not different from the Book of Joshua, as it locates it near Bethel as does the Books of Chronicles.

===In Hosea===
Gilgal is mentioned in God&#x27;s rebuke of the Israelites saying: &quot;The Lord says, &#x27;All their wickedness began at Gilgal; there I began to hate them. I will drive them from my land because of their evil actions. I will love them no more because all their leaders are rebels.&#x27;&quot;(Hosea 9, ).

Hosea also mentions sacrifices in Gilgal: &quot;If Gilead be given to iniquity becoming altogether vanity, in Gilgal they sacrifice unto bullocks; yea, their altars shall be as heaps in the furrows of the field.&quot; (Hosea 12, ).

The term &quot;gilgal&quot; is thought by many modern archaeologists to refer to a type of structure, which may then receive additional names, for example &quot;the gilgal by the terebinths of Moreh&quot; () or &quot;the gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho&quot; (). Gilgal structures have been found only in the Jordan River valley, and in the Samarian mountains on the edge of the desert. Pottery discoveries date them to the early Israelite period, with most remains from the 12th–11th centuries BCE. They are located on the lower slopes of a hill, have a footprint-shaped stone outline, and were used for occasional assembly rather than permanent dwelling. These sites are hypothesized to be ritual sites where the early Israelites celebrated holidays together, until worship was centralized. The footprint-shaped outline recalls ancient Egyptian symbolism in which a footprint symbolized ownership. The use of low slopes is in contrast to Canaanite practice, which placed sanctuaries &quot;on every lofty hill&quot; (2 Kings 17:10).

This theory is disputed by Nadav Na&#x27;aman, who argues that &quot;gilgal&quot; as a type of settlement never appears in the Bible, and that all references to a place of that name are either corruptions (for example of &quot;Galilee&quot;) or refer to a single unidentified cultic site east of Jericho.

==Location==
Edward Robinson first drew the connection to Gilgal to Jiljilyya in 1838, as did van de Velde and Victor Guérin in 1870. In 1882, SWP noted: &quot;The name suggests its identity with Gilgal, a town in the mountains near Bethel. This Gilgal (2 Kings ii. i) is mentioned as though &quot;above&quot; Bethel (verse 2), which does not agree exactly with the position of Jiljilia (2,441 feet above the sea), and of Beitin (2,890), but the descent into the great
valley, Wady el Jib, may account for the expression, &#x27;went down to Bethel.&quot;

In the 20th century, archaeologist W.F. Albright disagreed with this identification, while Abel agreed with it.

<text>Cudgegong River, a perennial stream that is part of the Macquarie catchment within the Murray–Darling basin, is located in the central western and Orana districts of New South Wales, Australia.

The river rises of the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range within Wollemi National Park, east of Rylstone, and flows generally west, north-west, and south-west, joined by fourteen tributaries, including Wyaldra Creek and Lawsons Creek, before reaching its confluence with the Macquarie River at Lake Burrendong; descending over its course.

Several reservoirs, including Rylstone Reservoir and Lake Windamere, impede the natural flow of the Cudgegong River past the towns of Mudgee, and near Gulgong.

<doc id="595871" wikidata="Q16997365" url="?curid=595871" title="Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967">
<text>The Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967 (c. 41), shortened to Marine Broadcasting Offences Act or Marine Offences Act, became law in the United Kingdom at midnight on Monday 14 August 1967. It was subsequently amended by the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 and the Broadcasting Act 1990. Its purpose was to extend the powers of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949 (which was incorporated by this act), beyond the territorial land area and territorial waters of the UK to cover airspace and external bodies of water.

The act represented the UK&#x27;s ratification of the 1965 &quot;European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts Transmitted from Stations outside National Territories&quot; (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Council of Europe Strasbourg Convention&quot; or &quot;Strasbourg Treaty&quot;).

At the time that the bill was introduced in Parliament in 1966, there were radio stations and proposals for television stations outside British licensing jurisdiction with signals aimed at Britain. These stations were anchored at sea but there were press reports of stations broadcasting from aircraft – Caroline TV, and from a ship – Radex TV.

The act was extended to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man in September 1967. The act meant that the operation of offshore, pirate radio stations became illegal if they were operated or assisted by persons subject to UK law. It prohibited &quot;carrying by water or air goods or persons to or from it&quot; which made tendering illegal. Station operators thought they could continue if they were staffed, supplied and funded by non-British citizens, but this largely proved impractical.

==Origins ==
In 1966, broadcasting in the UK was controlled by the British General Post Office, which had granted exclusive radio broadcasting licences to the British Broadcasting Corporation and television licences to the BBC and 16 regional Independent Television companies.

The power of the GPO covered letters delivered by the Royal Mail, newspapers, books and their printing presses, the encoding of messages on lines used to supply electricity; the electric telegraph, the electric telephone (which was originally deemed an electronic post office); the electric wireless telegraph and the electric wireless telephone which became known as &quot;telephony&quot; and later wireless broadcasting. In the 1920s the GPO had been circumvented by broadcasting from transmitters in countries close to British listeners. World War II terminated these broadcasts except for Radio Luxembourg.

==Broadcasting pressure groups==
In the 1950s a pressure group campaigned with the help of Winston Churchill to pass the Television Act 1954 that broke the BBC television monopoly by creating ITV. Some members wanted commercial competition to radio but were thwarted by a succession of governments.

By the 1960s several companies formed in the hope that radio licences would be issued. Radio monopolies in adjoining nations had been broken by transmitters on ships in international waters. The first attempt to broadcast offshore to Britain was by CNBC, an English-language station from the same ship as Radio Veronica broadcasting in Dutch to the Netherlands. CNBC ended transmissions but press reports followed that GBLN, &quot;The Voice of Slough&quot;, would transmit from a ship with sponsored programming already booked and advertised by Herbert W. Armstrong. GBLN was followed by reports that GBOK was attempting to get on the air from another ship, both ships to be anchored off south-east England. Many in these early ventures were known to each other.

Some of the commercial television group members had registered broadcasting companies and were working to create offshore radio. The first venture was &quot;Project Atlanta&quot; in 1963, which had ties to British political leaders, bankers, the music industry and to Gordon McLendon, who had helped Radio Nord broadcast from a ship off Sweden. When that was put off the air by Swedish law it became available to British entrepreneurs. Before Radio Atlanta got on the air, Radio Caroline began broadcasting in March 1964.

Texas connections to British stations led Don Pierson of Eastland, Texas to promote three American-radio format stations off Britain: Wonderful Radio London or Big L, Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio. By 1966 other stations had come on the air transmitting to Scotland, northern and southern England, or were in the process of doing so. Press reports included rumours of offshore television stations and the brief success of the Dutch REM Island operation called Radio and TV Noordzee heightened the fear of the authorities that de facto unregulated broadcasting was becoming so entrenched due to its popularity that it would not be possible to stop it.

==Existing laws ==
Although these stations maintained sales and management offices in Britain, the transmitters were not under British law. In many instances, the ships were registered in other countries.

==Claims of piracy==
Parliamentary debates listed several reasons why unlicensed broadcasting should be stopped. Opponents referred to &quot;pirate radio stations&quot;. Allegations of piracy included misappropriation of World War II military installations; wavelengths allocated to others and the unauthorised playing of recorded music. Other claims said the vessels were a danger to shipping and that signals could interfere with aircraft and police, fire and ambulance services.

==Timing ==
In 1966, a dispute among offshore radio operators brought the issue of unlicensed radio stations to the fore. Reginald Calvert, operator of Radio City, had refused to pay Radio Caroline&#x27;s operator Oliver Smedley for a substandard transmitter. Smedley hired some riggers to occupy the Radio City facility (on Shivering Sands, a disused offshore defence fort), and in an altercation at Smedley&#x27;s house, Smedley killed Calvert. This incident strengthened the position of the Labour government of Harold Wilson, who wanted to bring the pirate stations under control, enough to see the passage of the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act on 15 August 1967.

==Application to Crown Dependencies==

The UK parliament generally only extends laws to Crown Dependencies with the consent of the local legislatures. The Isle of Man, supply base for Radio Caroline, rejected the 1967 law, but the legislation was extended to it anyway by an Order in Council, along with the other dependencies. This resulted in some protests and talk of independence in the Manx legislature, but no consequential action.

==Results==
The offshore stations fell into four groups:

* Local operators of small stations such as Radio Essex and Radio City who conducted their businesses with limited budgets primarily from disused forts on offshore sandbars, plus the similarly based larger operation, Radio 390. The UK silenced these stations by bringing the sandbars within UK waters.
* Regional operators such as Radio 270 and Radio Scotland who lacked the resources to relocate to other countries and staff their operations with non-British personnel.
* The ship based stations of Wonderful Radio London, Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio. While Wonderful Radio London made money, the others had lost so they closed ahead of the law to save further expense. Radio London continued broadcasting until its last transmission on the eve of the new law.
* The Radio Caroline ships announced they would move to Holland, with an advertising office in New York City. The reality was felt in early 1968 when two tugs representing the company supplying the ships with food, fuel, water, and spares towed the vessels away to satisfy debts.

==Continuing challenges ==
Although challenges began with Radio North Sea International in 1970, the British governments (both Labour, then Conservative) jammed it until it moved to a position off the Netherlands. There was no Dutch equivalent of the act until 1974; upon its introduction, RNI closed.

Radio Caroline returned through the 1970s using the , a vessel that sank in 1980, then returned with a new ship, the , in 1983, primarily conducted with volunteer help. For much of this period Caroline&#x27;s ships also hosted Dutch-language stations whose revenue, along with that of American evangelical broadcasts, kept the station on the air.

In 1984 Caroline was joined by Laser 558 another station with American backing, and while the latter gained a huge audience, the legislation plus a sea embargo monitoring supplies out to its ship, MV &quot;Communicator&quot;, drove its operators into insolvency as well as putting additional pressure on Caroline. An attempt to revive Laser under new management only lasted a few months from 1986 to 1987. The arrival of Laser had increased knowledge of Caroline&#x27;s presence, and its closure plus a change in Caroline&#x27;s music policy resulted in an increase in their younger audience.

Further amendments to the act had resulted in Radio Caroline having to move its operations into wilder water, and the Great Storm of 1987 damaged their antenna tower, which collapsed a few weeks later. A smaller antenna system was built but was less efficient. The Dutch and British governments then raided the Radio Caroline ship and removed much of its equipment, but again it limped back onto the air until late 1990 when, with its funding running low, the final amendment to the act, instigating a 200-mile limit, came into effect. Attempts to secure more funding proved futile, and thereafter it pursued legal means of broadcasting.

==Apparent conclusion of unlicensed British offshore radio==
The end of the offshore Radio Caroline came when the Broadcasting Act 1990, which built on all similar and related legislation, together with a storm that caused its staff temporarily to abandon the ship, caused the station to come ashore in 1991, where enthusiasts continue to build a broadcasting business using the new licensing system available to British broadcasters.

<doc id="595872" wikidata="Q4120716" url="?curid=595872" title="Sufi whirling">
<text>Sufi whirling (or Sufi turning) ( borrowed from Persian Sama-zan, Sama, meaning &quot;listening&quot;, from Arabic, and zan, meaning doer, from Persian) is a form of physically active meditation which originated among certain Sufi groups, and which is still practiced by the Sufi Dervishes of the Mevlevi order and other orders such as the Rifa&#x27;i-Marufi. It is a customary meditation practice performed within the sema, or worship ceremony, through which dervishes (from the persian Darvish Persian also called &quot;semazens&quot;, from Persian ) aim to reach greater connection with Allah. This is sought through abandoning one&#x27;s nafs, ego or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on God, and spinning one&#x27;s body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the Solar System orbiting the Sun.

The Mevlevi practice gave rise to an Egyptian form, &quot;tanoura&quot;, distinguished by the use of a multicolored skirt. This has also developed into a performance dance by non-Sufis, including dancers outside the Islamic world.

== Origin ==
As an order, the whirling Dervishes were founded by mystic poet Rumi in the 13th century. Initially, Sufi fraternities () were organized as leaderships where members followed prescribed disciplines in service to a sheikh or master to establish trust with him. A member of such a fraternity is referred to as a Persian &quot;darwish&quot;. These turuk were responsible for organizing an Islamic expression of religious life, often founded by independent saints or resulted from the division of existing orders. Each Sufi tariqa stems from a unique &quot;silsila&quot;, or &quot;chain of order&quot; in which a member must learn, as the &quot;silsila&quot; binds each member to Allah through one&#x27;s chain of order. One&#x27;s &quot;silsila&quot; extends through the member&#x27;s individual teacher, to their teacher and so on, through time until one is connected to the Prophet and thus Allah. The Prophet himself is revered as the originator of Sufism, which has in turn been traced down through a series of saints.

== Practice ==

A dervish practices multiple rituals, the primary of which is the &quot;dhikr&quot;, a remembering of Allah. The &quot;dhikr&quot; involves recitation of devotional Islamic prayer. This &quot;dhikr&quot; is coupled with physical exertions of movement, specifically dancing and whirling, in order to reach a state assumed by outsiders to be one of &quot;ecstatic trances&quot;. As explained by Sufis:

In the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen&#x27;s camel&#x27;s hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt (&quot;tennure&quot;) represents the ego&#x27;s shroud. By removing his black cloak (&quot;hırka&quot;), he is spiritually reborn to the truth. At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to god&#x27;s unity. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive god&#x27;s beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen conveys god&#x27;s spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevlâna Jalâluddîn Rumi says, &quot;All loves are a bridge to Divine love. Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!&quot;

Among the Mevlevi order, the practice of &quot;dhikr&quot; is performed in a traditional dress: a &quot;tennure&quot;, a sleeveless white frock, the &quot;destegul&quot;, a long sleeved jacket, a belt, and a black overcoat or &quot;khirqa&quot; to be removed before the whirling begins. As the ritual dance begins, the dervish dons a felt cap, a &quot;sikke&quot;, in addition to a turban wrapped around the head, a trademark of the Mevlevi order. The sheikh leads the ritual with strict regulations. To begin,
The sheikh stands in the most honored corner of the dancing place, and the dervishes pass by him three times, each time exchanging greetings, until the circling movement starts. The rotation itself is on the left foot, the center of the rotation being the ball of the left foot and the whole surface of the foot staying in contact with the floor. The impetus for the rotation is provided by the right foot, in a full 360-degree step. If a dervish should become too enraptured, another Sufi, who is in charge of the orderly performance, will gently touch his frock in order to curb his movement, The dance of the dervishes is one of the most impressive features of the mystical life in Islam, and the music accompanying it is of exquisite beauty, beginning with the great hymn in honor of the Prophet (na&#x27;t-i sharif, written by Jalaluddin himself) and ending with short, enthusiastic songs, some things sung in Turkish.


The Western world, having witnessed Sufi whirling through tourism, have described the various forms of &quot;dhikr&quot; as &quot;barking, howling, dancing, etc.&quot; The practice of each &quot;tariqa&quot; is unique to its individual order, specific traditions and customs may differ across countries. The same &quot;tariqa&quot; in one country will not mirror that of another country as each order&#x27;s ritual stresses &quot;emotional religious life&quot; in various forms. The Mevleviyah order, like many others, practice the &quot;dhikr&quot; by performing a whirling meditation. Accompanying the &quot;dhikr&quot; practices of whirling and prayer, the custom of &quot;sama&quot; serves to further one&#x27;s &quot;nourishment of the soul&quot; through devotional &quot;hearing&quot; of the &quot;&#x27;subtle&#x27; sounds of the hidden world or of the cosmos.&quot; In contrast to the use of &quot;sama&quot;, whirling and devotional prayer in the practice of &quot;dhikr&quot;, the &quot;tariqa&quot; orders perform Sufi whirling in addition to playing musical instruments, consuming glowing embers, live scorpions and glass, puncturing body parts with needles and spikes, or practicing clairvoyance and levitation. The dervish practice can be performed by community residents or lay members, members have typically been those of lower classes. Women were received into a &quot;tariqa&quot; order by a male sheikh, but traditionally were instructed to practice the &quot;dhikr&quot; alone or with an established branch of females within a specific order.

The custom of &quot;sama&quot; among Sufi orders has a history of controversy within the Islamic faith. In one argument, the use of the term &quot;sama&quot; is considered to suggest physically &quot;listening&quot; in a spiritual context. A differing opinion argues that &quot;sama&quot; is in fact &quot;hearing&quot;, as &quot;to hear&quot; can pertain to any sound in addition to any &quot;subtle&quot; sounds of the spiritual realm. Those in support of &quot;sama&quot; further claim that the term is actually synonymous with &quot;understanding&quot; and therefore recognition and application of the Revelation as well as the act of &quot;attaining higher knowledge.&quot; Sama can also refer to considerate listening to an honest temporal leader who ensures social justice and makes word of God mainstream. The spread of &quot;sama&quot; among Sufi orders began some time around the mid third/ninth century C.E. in Baghdad, eventually finding acceptance and favor in Persian, Turkish and Indian Islam. The custom of &quot;sama&quot; evolved in practice over time as it complemented Sufi &quot;dhkir&quot;, whirling and among some orders dancing and a meal. Rules of propriety and conditions were adopted upon the widespread concern surrounding the necessity of &quot;sama&quot; with the &quot;dhikr&quot;; in order to distinguish between entertainment and valuable spiritual practice, the &quot;sama&quot; was distinguished as heard from the ego, heart or spirit. Despite the application of rules, some sheikhs continued to limit or disapprove the practice of &quot;sama&quot;. While controversy continuously questioned the place of &quot;sama&quot; in Sufi orders, the music itself was not affected. More recently, the custom of &quot;sama&quot; is most commonly performed within a &quot;dhikr&quot; ceremony. Those in support of &quot;sama&quot; continue to argue that &quot;according to that which it is not &quot;sama&quot; and dance which induce ecstasy, but ecstasy which arouses dance, or furthermore, that &quot;sama&quot; is only a revealing instrument and that it only supplies that which is brought to it by the hearer.&quot;

In 2005, UNESCO proclaimed the &quot;Mevlevi Sema Ceremony&quot; of Turkey as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

== Today ==

Dervish communities, in the Middle Ages, served a central role in social, religious and political life throughout &quot;central Islamic lands.&quot; Dervish orders were at one time much larger in size than they are today, as the government has taken control over most Dervish monasteries throughout this area. In 1925, Turkey ordered the dissolution of all Sufi fraternities by decree, the Mevlevi managed to survive among small villages throughout the Middle East. In 1954, the Turkish government granted the Mevlevi order a special permission to perform ritual whirling practices for tourists during two weeks each year. Outside of tourist entertainment, Orthodox theologians have now vocally discounted the Dervish practice resulting in &quot;faqirs&quot;, or wandering, mendicant dervishes throughout central Islamic regions. Despite strict government control over Dervish practices, the Mevleviyah order continued its existence in Turkey to this day.

While only men have historically been permitted to take part in the ceremony, some communities now allow women to participate.

==Regional and secular forms==
===Egyptian tanoura===

In Egypt, the practice of whirling has been adapted as tanoura (). The word &quot;tanoura&quot; or &quot;tannoura&quot; refers to the colorful skirt worn by the whirler, with a color representing each Sufi order. The word may also refer to the dancer, traditionally a Sufi man. Tanoura is associated with Sufism and is performed at Sufi festivals, but it is also performed by non-Sufis as a folk dance or concert dance.

Although it is mainly used for visual effects, the dancers also augment their balance with the tanoura, through a dynamic centrifugal effect.

In Sufi shrines in Pakistan, such as the Lal shrine in Sehwan, Sindh, the practice of Sufi whirling is called &quot;Dhamaal&quot; and is performed to honor Sufi saints, or qalandars. Unlike the Turkish practice, Dhamaal may be practiced by any devotee – priests as well as pilgrims. Dhamaal is usually preceded by the beating of a drum (naghara) and ringing of bells, as pilgrims raise their hands, start to skip steps standing at one place and gradually work into a trance as the beats get faster. As the beats get faster, rhythms change and the drum beats are accompanies by the playing of shehnai.

Practitioners associate the dance with Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and with protests following the Battle of Karbala. They regard the rhythm of the drum to evoke the rhythm of the creation of the universe, as illustrated in the concept of &quot;Kun Fyakun&quot;.

===In the West===

The tanoura tradition has attracted some interest from Westerners in the belly dancing community. These performers include both men and women, solo and in groups. Such performances may be augmented with pyrotechnics or props, such as veils, wings and ribbons.
The techniques used in Egyptian Tanoura can also be adopted by belly dancers to help with their balance and control dizziness.

Sufi whirling has also been promoted by actor and memoirist Annabelle Gurwitch as a form of stress relief.

==Physiology==
A defining feature of whirling is continuous rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) around a central radical axis while avoiding vertigo. In untrained dancers, this sustained rotation causes dizziness or motion-induced vertigo. Training for whirling targets the inner ear, which is responsible for balance functions in humans. To counteract this effect, whirling dance performers practice various balancing and psychological techniques.

==Records==
Guinness World Records for &quot;most Sufi whirls in one hour&quot; were awarded in London in 2012, to Shafik Ibrahim Abd El Hamed in the male category with 2,905 rotations, and Tara Lee Oakley in the female category with 2,191. These records were surpassed in Zurich in 2015 by Nicole McLaren, with 3,552 rotations.

The longest continuous whirling performance has been recorded at more than four hours. The record for the most people simultaneously whirling is 755, set in Taiwan in 2011.

<text>Ron Kass (March 30, 1935 – October 17, 1986) was an American businessman, recording executive, and film producer. Kass worked with at least four recording companies: Liberty, MGM, Warner Brothers, and Apple Records.

==Early life==
Born Ronald Stanley Kashinoff in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, his family changed the name to Kass when they moved to California. He attended Fairfax High School in Los Angeles where he played in a band that became Tijuana Brass and then got a degree in accounting from UCLA.

==Career==
Kass married his UCLA sweetheart, Anita, and started working for Liberty Records which was directly across from Hollywood High School. He was promoted to overseas manager and eventually president of Liberty. He was brought in to head Apple Records, the label set up by The Beatles in 1968.

In 1969, Allen Klein was appointed The Beatles&#x27; business manager. He viewed Kass as a threat due to his role in the commercial success of Apple Records, so Kass was forced from his position, after being falsely accused of &quot;financial impropriety&quot;. He was succeeded in the position by his former deputy Jack Oliver.

Kass&#x27;s film producing credits included &quot;Melody&quot; (1971), &quot;The Optimists&quot; (1973) starring Peter Sellers, &quot;Naked Yoga&quot; (1974) nominated for an Oscar for Best Documentary Short Subject, &quot;The Stud&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Bitch&quot; (1979) both based on novels by Jackie Collins, and starring her sister Joan Collins.

He and Collins appeared on &quot;Tattletales&quot; in 1977 and 1982.

==Personal life==
With Anita his first wife, they had their first son David, and then Kass moved to London but settled his family in Lugano, Switzerland, where they had two more sons, Roberto and Jonathan. After their divorce in 1969, Anita raised their children in Lugano.

In 1972, Kass married Joan Collins. They had a daughter, Katyana (&quot;Katie&quot;), born in 1972. Kass and Collins were divorced in 1983, but reportedly remained close. Collins provided for Kass&#x27;s medical care when he was ill with terminal cancer, in addition to flying his sons from Switzerland to their father. On October 17, 1986, in Los Angeles, California, Kass died from cancer at the age of 51.

<text>Mudgee () is a town in the Central West of New South Wales, Australia. It is in the broad fertile Cudgegong River valley north-west of Sydney and is the largest town in the Mid-Western Regional Council local government area as well as being the council seat. At the 2021 Census, its population was 11,457. The district lies across the edge of the geological structure known as the Sydney Basin.

==History==
=== Wiradjuri people ===
The Mudgee and Dabee clans of the Wiradjuri people lived at and around the site of what is now the town of Mudgee on the Cudgegong River. Some cultural and tool-making sites of these Aboriginal people remain, including the Hands on the Rocks, The Drip and Babyfoot Cave sites.

==== Significance of local names ====
Many place-names in the region are derived from the original Wiradjuri language, including Mudgee itself, which was named by the Wiradjuri clan who lived there. There are various translations as to what Mudgee means including &quot;resting place&quot;, &quot;contented&quot;, &quot;nest in the hills&quot; as well as &quot;friend or mate&quot; which the latter coincides with the Wiradjuri word &quot;mudyi&quot;. The correct pronunciation has also been recorded as either &quot;Moudgee&quot;, &quot;Moothi&quot; or &quot;Mougee&quot;. Nearby places include Lue (Loowee, &#x27;a chain of waterholes&#x27;); Gulgong (&#x27;a gully&#x27;); Wollar (&#x27;a rock water hole&#x27;); Menah (&#x27;flat country&#x27;); Eurunderee (&#x27;a local tree&#x27;); Guntawang (&#x27;a peaceful place&#x27;), Cooyal (&#x27;dry country&#x27;); Wilbertree (&#x27;a long switch&#x27;); Gooree (&#x27;native chasing live animal&#x27;); Burrendong (&#x27;darker than usual&#x27;). The Aboriginal name of the Rylstone area was Combamolang.

===Early British colonisation (1821 to 1850)===

James Blackman, leading a small expedition in the latter half of 1821, was the first British colonist to enter the Mudgee district. Not long after, Lieutenant William Lawson who was then commandant of Bathurst, made several further expeditions to Mudgee. Both Blackman and Lawson found the site to be an Aboriginal settlement or &quot;bimmel&quot; inhabited by around 100 people who called the area &quot;Mudgee&quot; or &quot;Mujjee&quot;.

In February 1822, George and Henry Cox, sons of William Cox, followed the trails set up by Blackman and Lawson with 500 head of livestock, and established a grazing property at Menah, north of the current town. The Coxes were soon in conflict with the Mudgee clan who drove away their workers and livestock. George Cox gathered some men at Bathurst and returned to Menah where a two hour fight later ensued, resulting in six Mudgee people being killed and one of Cox&#x27;s employees being speared to death.

The violence in the region worsened in June 1824, when Theophilus Chamberlain, who was the Coxes&#x27; superintendent of their Mudgee property holdings, led a number of punitive expeditions against the local Aboriginal people. A skirmish at Guntawang to the north of Mudgee resulted in some settlers being killed, with around 70 or more Aboriginal people dying in follow up raids. Martial law was declared by Governor Thomas Brisbane in August 1824, leading to further killings of the Wiradjuri people in the Mudgee area. Descendants and workers of the Coxes later described this period as one where &quot;an immense number of natives, men, women and children were slaughtered&quot; and &quot;the bodies of the blacks were piled together and burnt...like old tar barrels&quot;. The violence forced the Coxes to abandon Guntawang, and relieving Chamberlain of his duties, they shifted their enterprise to nearby Dabee.

The Cox family remained prominent landholders around Mudgee for many decades, owning the Dabee, Menah and Burrundulla properties. William Lawson and his descendants also continued to be leading pastoralists in the region, holding estates such as Putta Bucca and Havilah.

The site of the Mudgee township was surveyed in 1837 and the first land sales occurred in August 1838. It has been incorrectly claimed that Robert Hoddle designed the village. Although Hoddle was the first surveyor in the region, marking out the boundaries of Putta Bucca and Bombira, by the time the village was gazetted, he had already left the district to become leader of the Port Phillip Survey. John Blackman built a slab hut, the first dwelling in Mudgee and its general store.

By 1841 there were 36 dwellings, three hotels, a hospital, a post office, two stores and an Anglican church. St John&#x27;s Church of England was consecrated on 6 May 1841. The police station moved from Menah in the mid-1840s and an Anglican school was established in that decade.

===1850 to present===


In 1851 the population of Mudgee was 200. This skyrocketed with the discovery of gold by Edward Hargraves in nearby Hargraves, leading to a gold rush. While no gold was found in Mudgee itself, the town is central to the goldfields of Gulgong, Hill End and Windeyer, and grew rapidly as a result.

Mudgee was declared as a municipality in 1860 making it the second oldest municipality west of the Great Dividing Range with a population of 1500 in 1861. A public school was built in the 1850s together with the present Anglican, Catholic Methodist and Presbyterian churches. A new police station, courthouse, Mechanics&#x27; Institute and a town hall were built in the 1860s. There were four coach factories operating in Mudgee to cater for the demand of the nearby goldfields. The National Trust of Australia has a number of these buildings registered including the Mudgee Museum (formerly the Colonial Inn), the Catholic presbytery, the court house, the police station and the Anglican Church. On 1 June 1861 the Electric Telegraph system arrived and was opened for messages to be transmitted and received at the Telegraph office.

One gold miner attracted to the Mudgee district was Niels Peter Larsen, who married Louisa Albury in Mudgee in 1866. They were the parents of leading Australian poet Henry Lawson, born in Grenfell in 1867, and changed their names to Peter and Louisa Lawson. By the birth of their third child, they moved to a selection at Pipeclay (now Eurunderee) north of Mudgee. The site is now a rest stop with a plaque.

Louisa Lawson&#x27;s vigorous lobbying led to the establishment of the slab-and-bark Eurunderee Public School in 1876 with Henry Lawson first attending aged nine. He would later write about the school in his poem, &quot;The Old Bark School&quot;. Lawson later attended St. Matthews Central School, Mudgee before progressively worsening deafness led to him leaving school at 14. He lived in the region until age 15 and many of his stories were written about the district.

Tiny diamonds were sometimes found and discarded by gold panners when &quot;washing off&quot;, but sometime before June 1869 a larger specimen was found on the banks of the Cudgegong River about from Mudgee and appraised by the jeweller George Crisp, of Queen Street, Melbourne, at 22.2 carat. Dubbed the &quot;Mudgee diamond&quot;, it was the largest found to that date in Australia, however commercial quantities were not found and companies founded to exploit the discoveries were wound up a few years later.

As the gold petered out in the latter half of the 19th century, Mudgee was sustained by both its wool industry and a nascent wine industry founded by a German immigrant, Adam Roth, in the 1850s. The opening of the railway extension from Rylstone to Mudgee occurred on 10 September 1884.

The railway boosted the town&#x27;s agriculture. The extension between Rylstone and Mudgee closed on 2 March 1992. This same section re-opened eight years later, on 2 September 2000 and closed again in 2007. The Wallaby Track Drive Tour visits various sites associated with Lawson including the old Eurundee Public School, the Henry Lawson memorial, the Budgee Budgee Inn, Sapling Gully, Golden Gully and the Albury Pub which was owned by Lawson&#x27;s grandfather.

In 1890 a local newspaper was founded with the title the &quot;Mudgee Guardian and North-Western Representative&quot;. Its title changed in 1963 to the &quot;Mudgee Guardian and Gulgong Advertiser&quot; and is currently published twice a week.

Mudgee&#x27;s Glen Willow Regional Sports Stadium hosted the 2012 City vs Country Origin rugby league match with an attendance of 8,621, and the 2017 match with an attendance of 8,322. The St. George Dragons regularly host home matches there.

Additionally, in the A-League, the Western Sydney based Western Sydney Wanderers have chosen to take their Community Round match to Mudgee&#x27;s Glen Willow Regional Sports Stadium, as part of their new Regional Strategy,

In 2014, the local council found itself involved in a statewide corruption investigation when officers of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (New South Wales) raided the local council&#x27;s offices.

==Economy==

Mudgee has developed as a wine producing region, it has manufacturing and repair industries. It is also heavily dependent on several major mines in the surrounding area and fly-in fly-out (FIFO) miners who live in the town but work elsewhere.

Other rural produce includes cattle, sheep, wheat, alfalfa, olives, fruit, tomatoes, sweetcorn, honey, alpacas and dairy products. These, however, do not play as large a role as mining.

The Ulan coal mines are in the district and it also produces marble, pottery clays, shale and dolomite. These mines have further potential to expand in the region, however they attract environmental protests.

Tourism is also a growing industry based mostly on the wineries and, as of 2020, escaping the restrictive life in Sydney. Property prices have surged due to the local airport and the fact that it&#x27;s only a one hour flight to Sydney.

A laboratory was established in 1987 to test meat for pesticide residues.

Local real estate, petrol and living costs skyrocketed since 2010 when the mining boom began to peak. This has rolled onto the local population, who have since had increased difficulty in living in the town.

A new hospital was completed in 2020.

<text>Martin Farquhar Tupper (17 July 1810 – 29 November 1889) was an English poet and novelist. He was one of the most widely-read English-language authors of his day with the poetry collection &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot;, which was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and North America for several decades.

Tupper found great success in Victorian Britain at a relatively early age, with a second series of the poetry collection &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot; in 1842. The work&#x27;s fame later spread to the US and Canada, and it continued to be popular for several decades. The author capitalised on this success with scores of editions in various formats and tours in his homeland and in North America, and as one of Queen Victoria&#x27;s favourite poets he was once a serious contender for the position of Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom. However, &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot; eventually fell out of fashion, and its previous eminence made the poetry and its author popular targets for satire and parody.

Despite his prodigious output and ongoing efforts at self-promotion, Tupper&#x27;s other work did not achieve anywhere close to the bestseller status of &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot;, and even towards the end of the poet&#x27;s own lifetime he had become obscure. Nevertheless, the style of &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot; (which Tupper referred to as &quot;rhythmics&quot; rather than poetry) had an influence on admirer Walt Whitman, who was also experimenting with free verse. Considered by later generations to be artefacts of their time, Tupper&#x27;s works have largely been forgotten, and had been out of print for over a century.

==Early life==

Martin Farquhar Tupper was born on 17 July 1810 at 20 Devonshire Place, London. He was the eldest child of Dr. Martin Tupper, an esteemed doctor from an old Guernsey family, and his wife Ellin Devis Marris, the daughter of landscape painter Robert Marris (1749–1827) and granddaughter of Arthur Devis.

Martin F. Tupper received his early education at Eagle House School and Charterhouse, going on to attend Christ Church, Oxford where he received a BA in 1832. At university he was the classmate of many distinguished men, including future politicians James Broun-Ramsay, James Bruce, Henry Pelham-Clinton, Charles Canning, George Cornewall Lewis and William Ewart Gladstone, as well as literary figures Francis Hastings Doyle, Henry Liddell and Robert Scott. He maintained a close friendship with Gladstone until the final years of his life.

From a young age Tupper suffered from a severe stammer, which precluded him from going into the church or politics. Having taken the further degree of MA, Tupper became a student at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and was called to the bar in 1835, but did not ever practise as a barrister.

On 26 November of the same year Tupper married his first cousin Isabella Devis, daughter of Arthur William Devis, in St Pancras Church, having proposed to her before leaving for university seven years previously. He acquired a house on Park Village East, near Regent&#x27;s Park, and the couple was financially supported by his father. While living here, Tupper attended St James&#x27; Chapel on Hampstead Road (now demolished), where he became acquainted with its minister Henry Stebbing. An author and former editor of the literary magazine the Athenaeum, Stebbing&#x27;s encouragement of Tupper&#x27;s writings eventually led to the publication of &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot;.

==Career==
===Early works===
While at Oxford, Tupper&#x27;s literary career commenced; his first important publication was a collection of 75 short poems entitled &quot;Sacra Poesis&quot; (1832). In the same year he wrote a long poem partially in blank verse, &quot;A Voice from the Cloister&quot;, but this was only published, anonymously, in 1835.

In the summer of 1838 Tupper penned a continuation of Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Christabel&quot;, naming it &quot;Geraldine&quot; and publishing it alongside various other pieces in the latter half of that year in the collection &quot;Geraldine, a sequel to Coleridge&#x27;s Christabel: with other poems&quot;. The poem &quot;Geraldine&quot; itself met with some critical reprobation, although in his contemporary notes Tupper attributes this largely to it being a continuation of an early version of Coleridge&#x27;s poem: &quot;When Coleridge first published Christabel ... it was positively hooted by the critics ... Coleridge left behind him a very much improved and enlarged version of the poem, which I did not see till years after I had written the sequel to it: my Geraldine was composed for an addition to Christabel, as originally issued.&quot; The other poems in the collection were more warmly received.

===&quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot;===

Tupper&#x27;s most successful work had its genesis in 1828, shortly before his Oxford matriculation. At this time he was engaged to Isabella, and he decided to write his &quot;notions on the holy estate of matrimony&quot; for her, &quot;in the manner of Solomon&#x27;s proverbs&quot;. Isabella showed them to Hugh M&#x27;Neile, who suggested seeking publication, but Tupper chose not to do so at the time.

In 1837, on the encouragement of Henry Stebbing, Tupper began to revise these writings and expand them into a book, working on them at home and in his workplace, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, over the subsequent 10 weeks. The work takes the form of free verse meditations on morality (&quot;OfHumility&quot;, &quot;OfPride&quot;), religion (&quot;OfPrayer&quot;, &quot;TheTrain of Religion&quot;), and other aspects of the human condition (&quot;OfLove&quot;, &quot;OfJoy&quot;). Tupper did not refer to the pieces as poetry, preferring his own description of &quot;rhythmics&quot;.

Stebbing referred Tupper to the publisher Joseph Rickerby, who agreed to publish the work on a profit-sharing basis, and this first official version appeared on 24 January 1838 entitled &quot;Proverbial Philosophy: A Book of Thoughts and Arguments, originally treated, by Martin Farquhar Tupper, Esq., M.A.&quot; at a price of 7s. It met with moderate success in Britain; a second edition was commissioned, to which Tupper added more material, and sold for 6s. A third edition emerged, but this failed to sell well; the unsold copies were sent to America, where it was received poorly. &quot;Americans scarcely knew what to make of it at all; one of the few stateside reviewers to read &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot;, the powerful editor N.P. Willis, was so perplexed by the form of the book that he guessed it to have been written ... in the seventeenth century.&quot;
Despite the lack of interest in the third edition, in 1841 Tupper was spurred to write a second series of &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot; at the suggestion of John Hughes, who he had met in a chance encounter in Windsor two years previously. This series was to be serialised in the new publication Ainsworth&#x27;s Magazine, William Harrison Ainsworth being a friend of Hughes. Tupper and his family temporarily moved to Brighton where he produced some initial pieces for the magazine, as well as some essays. However, being &quot;too quick and too impatient to wait for piecemeal publication month by month&quot;, Tupper collated his new &quot;rhythmics&quot; and had the second series of &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot; published as a whole, on 5 October 1842 by John Hatchard.

The second series was sold alongside the fifth edition of the first series, and proved to be immediately popular. The two were soon combined into one collection, still entitled &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot;, and this iteration became an enormous success over the subsequent decades:

In the 1850s the work was translated into several languages, including German, Swedish, Danish, Armenian, and a French version by George Métivier. By 1866 it had sold over 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom, through forty editions.

Tupper did go on to write a third and fourth series in 1867 and 1869 respectively, published by Edward Moxon in his &quot;Moxon&#x27;s Popular Poets&quot; series (which had previously included luminaries such as Byron, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats and Milton). However, by this time Tupper had fallen out of fashion, and these latter series did not sell well. Moxon had already been in bad financial straits, and Tupper&#x27;s new works did not change his fortunes; the publisher was shortly taken over.

Over the course of the author&#x27;s lifetime it is estimated that between one quarter and half a million copies were sold in England, and over 1.5 million in the United States, across 50 editions. Due to the lack of international copyright laws, the US market was dominated by pirated copies; consequently, Tupper made almost no money from the work&#x27;s enormous American sales. However, he did manage to capitalise on his fame in North America by undertaking two tours of the US and Canada, in 1851 and 1876-1877.

===Candidate for Poet Laureate===
Upon the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, Tupper began to suggest his willingness to fill the now-vacant position of Poet Laureate to influential friends and acquaintances such as William Gladstone and James Garbett, who further gathered support. He continued to write poems for public events in order to demonstrate his capability, marking occasions such as the deaths of Robert Peel and the Duke of Cambridge, as well as the Great Exhibition, for which he published &quot;Hymn to the Exhibition&quot; in over sixty languages (set to music by Samuel Sebastian Wesley). It appears that his candidacy had popular support, from both sides of the Atlantic. However, the eventual selection was Alfred, Lord Tennyson, partly due to Prince Albert&#x27;s admiration of the poem In Memoriam A.H.H.

===First tour of America===

Despite making almost no money from his written works in North America, Tupper recognised the potential of his enormous popularity on the other side of the Atlantic. Having overcome his stammer at the age of 35, he embarked on a &quot;wildly successful&quot; reading tour of the Eastern USA and Canada, setting off from Liverpool on 2 March 1851 and landing in New York City two weeks later. His arrival was announced in American newspapers, and while based in the city he met a variety of literary figures including William Cullen Bryant, Nathaniel Parker Willis, James Gordon Bennett Sr., James Fenimore Cooper, and Washington Irving. He was generally warmly received by the people he met, although his tendency to quote his own poetry was &quot;deemed unseemly at the time&quot; and criticised in the press, as was his perceived &quot;patronising attitude and sentimentalism&quot; towards Americans.

An indication of Tupper&#x27;s popularity in the US is given by his dealings with one of his publishers in Philadelphia:

The highlight of the American tour was a dinner at the White House on 8 May with President Millard Fillmore and members of his cabinet, Fillmore himself being an admirer of the poet. In his autobiography Tupper quotes his contemporaneous notes:

After stops in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, Tupper returned to New York, where he was noticed in a concert crowd by its promoter P. T. Barnum and brought backstage to meet Jenny Lind. The Swedish Nightingale was an admirer - &quot;she sat holding Tupper&#x27;s hand and crying with emotion while the management of the theatre frantically tried to get her on stage for a bow.&quot; He set off on his return trip to Liverpool on 24 May 1851, seen off by a group of admirers and &quot;regretful paragraphs&quot; in the New York newspapers.

===Middle years===

By 1851 Tupper had fathered eight children, and had moved his large family into the spacious Albury House in Albury, Surrey approximately ten years previously. However, his financial position became precarious by the mid-1850s. His wife Isabella had fallen ill, and he wrote to Gladstone (then Chancellor of the Exchequer) to request an office or public pension, to no avail. His eldest son, Martin Charles Selwyn (born 1841), was made the youngest Captain in the British Army by purchase in 1864, but it fell upon his father to settle his many drinking and gambling debts, and fund a spell in an asylum in St John&#x27;s Wood, until he was relocated to Rio de Janeiro in 1868. These financial strains were compounded by a series of poor investments. Tupper managed to stay afloat by continuing to publish poetry, and bringing out new editions of &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot;, including an illustrated version, but he was compelled to let out Albury House from 1867 to generate additional income.

Tupper was already a favourite poet of Queen Victoria, and in June 1857, having written sonnets for each of the engaged couple Victoria, Princess Royal and Prince Frederick, was granted the honour of being &quot;summoned to Buckingham Palace, to be received by the Queen herself and Prince Albert, and to present special copies of &#x27;Proverbial Philosophy&#x27; with his own hands to the young betrothed.&quot; The circumstances of this audience were highly unusual, as Tupper was instructed to meet the Royal Family on a Sunday after church – &quot;the Royal Family had never entertained a private individual in this way since George III had summoned Dr Johnson.&quot; Tupper&#x27;s work was already well known to the family, having been appreciated by the children&#x27;s governess and their drawing master Edward Henry Corbould (who also happened to be Tupper&#x27;s friend), and he had written pieces for the children to perform for their parents previously.

Tupper continued to write poetry for periodicals and publications of his own work, but none of these came close to the popularity of &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot;. By the mid-1860s he and his work were being persistently satirised by a new generation of Victorians, the victims of changing tastes (see ).

===British and second American tours===
Deciding to focus on readings of his works instead of continuing to pen new material to be satirised or ignored, Tupper began touring south-west England in April 1873. These events were somewhat popular, although apart from the &quot;fair-sized audiences, largely composed of ladies&quot; there were also &quot;many who only came to satisfy themselves that such a fabulous being as Martin Tupper really existed&quot;. The most popular of his works were &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Marriage&quot; from &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot;, as well as the poems &quot;Never Give Up&quot; and &quot;All&#x27;s for the Best&quot;. Later in the year he also toured Scotland, to a warmer reception.

After his Scottish success, Tupper decided to undertake a second American tour; delayed by illness, he arrived in October 1876 and stayed in New York as the guest of Thomas De Witt Talmage, an admirer of &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot;. Much like in Britain, this tour was filled with public readings of his works; while his American popularity had also declined, it was not to the extent that it had in his home country, and he delivered a reading of &quot;Immortality&quot; to his largest-ever audience, between five and six thousand – the congregation of Talmage&#x27;s church. However, Tupper often failed to attract large crowds on the merit of his readings alone; he performed to several thousand at one event in Philadelphia, but only a few hundred at various events in New York State and Canada. After the huge success of his first American tour, this one &quot;proved a pale shadow&quot;. Nevertheless, it was profitable, and his stature was such that he was invited to the inaguruation and White House reception of President Hayes.

==Later life and death==

By the time of his return from his second American tour on 16 April 1877, Tupper had fallen into obscurity in his home country. His attempts to publish a complete collection of his works failed; each of the 26 publishers he approached had declined. Continually short of money, in 1880 was obliged to mortgage his longtime home of Albury House to the Duke of Northumberland. He and his family moved to a small rental property in Upper Norwood.

Tupper made a final attempt at a new printing of &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot; in 1881, a large illustrated quarto, but this failed to sell. He continued to write articles and plays, managing to publish &quot;Dramatic Pieces&quot; in 1882, and he also delivered occasional lectures and readings. Around this time he and Gladstone, friends since childhood, fell out over Gladstone&#x27;s views on the circumstances that led to the Oaths Act 1888, and his refusal to continue to support the author financially.

In late 1885 Tupper started to write an autobiography, which was published in May 1886 under the title &quot;My Life as an Author&quot;. His wife Isabella had died during its composition, in December 1885, from apoplexy, and he included a tribute to her in the work. It received fairly warm reviews, but never ran to a second edition, despite the author working on improvements and corrections after publication.

Tupper&#x27;s last published work was the booklet &quot;Jubilate!&quot;, which contained new poems for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria as well as the work he had written in honour of her coronation fifty years earlier.

In November 1886 Tupper suffered an illness of several days which robbed him of the ability to read and write. He remained in a fragile state for his remaining three years, being cared for by his children, never learning that during that period Albury House had been foreclosed by the Duke of Northumberland. Eventually he died, on 29 November 1889, and was buried in Albury churchyard in the same grave as his wife and son Martin Charles Selwyn, with an epitaph reading &quot;He being dead yet speaketh&quot;.

==Personal beliefs==
===Religion===
Tupper was a passionate lifelong Protestant:

The contrast between his beliefs and those of his close friend William Gladstone, who was raised Evangelical but sympathised with the Oxford Movement later in life, became a frequent source of friction between the two. Tupper at one point challenged him with the question &quot;are you a hearty friend of the Protestant Reformation?&quot;, and the difference of views was a contributing factor to their eventual falling out.

Tupper&#x27;s religion played a large role in his works, both in terms of the genesis and reception of &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot; (&quot;There was room for a work of moral principle, and of Evangelical temper, that would have a wide appeal&quot;), as well as later in life, when he wrote &quot;extreme Protestant ballads&quot; for the Church of England paper &quot;The Rock&quot;. Additionally, he was an early supporter of the Student Volunteer Movement, which was founded to encourage missionary work abroad.

===Colonialism===
During a time of increasing concern about the state of the British Empire&#x27;s military forces, Tupper was a key voice in creating the Volunteer Force, a movement which bolstered the army and helped lead to its professionalisation; he himself became the secretary of the &quot;Blackheath Rifles&quot; in 1859. He wrote jingoistic poems in support of the allied troops in the Crimean War and, controversially, urging severe punishment of those responsible for the Indian Rebellion of 1857. His ballads in the &quot;Globe&quot; captured a popular mood of outrage at the delay in relief for General Gordon at the Siege of Khartoum, and earned the appreciation of Gordon&#x27;s family.

===Race and abolitionism===
Tupper had an interest in the legacy of the Anglo-Saxons; he arranged an event to mark the thousandth anniversary of the birth of Alfred the Great in the king&#x27;s birthplace of Wantage, and was an erstwhile contributor to the short-lived magazine &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; (1849-1851), which was &quot;devoted to the cause of friendship between the English-speaking peoples&quot;. However, this interest has overtones of racial superiority, as evinced by his 1850 ballad &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Race&quot;: &quot;Break forth and spread over every place / The world is a world for the Anglo Saxon race!&quot;. Critic Kwame Anthony Appiah argues that Tupper&#x27;s views on race were informed and limited by their time, quoting this poem as an example of the predominant colonialist understanding of &quot;race&quot; in the nineteenth century. Appia calls Tupper a &quot;racialist&quot;: &quot;He believed, as did most educated Victorians by the mid-century, that we could divide human beings into a small number of groups, called &quot;races,&quot; in such a way that all members of these races shared certain fundamental ... characteristics with each other that they did not share with members of any other race.&quot;

Tupper was a proponent of abolitionism. While studying at Oxford he refused to eat sugar &quot;by way of somehow discouraging the slave trade&quot;, and in 1848 he wrote a national anthem for Liberia and advocated for the republic in communications with Lord Palmerston and President Fillmore. He received presidents Roberts and Benson in his home as they came to thank him for his support. In addition he created a specific prize in order to encourage African literature, &quot;biennially to be competed for by emancipated slaves&quot;.

Regarding the American Civil War, however, he was not entirely supportive of the anti-slavery Union. While he wrote to President Lincoln in May 1861 with the sentiment &quot;May this Revolution bear the good fruit of total abolition of slavery all over the American continent ...!&quot; and to Gladstone that &quot;The South are responsible for this civil war&quot;, his later works demonstrate a sympathy for the Southern cause. During his second American tour, Tupper published a sympathetic &quot;Ode to the South&quot;, beginning
Tupper&#x27;s autobiography, written towards the very end of his life, recounts visiting a formerly slave-owning friend during the same tour:

==Legacy==
Tupper had no doubts as to his place in the pantheon of English literature. As Murphy (1937) notes, the closing lines of his autobiography are a confident indication of this, quoting from the epilogue of Ovid&#x27;s Metamorphoses:
===&quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot; in later years===
Having enjoyed huge success for almost two decades, by the end of the 1850s &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot; started to fall out of favour in Britain as tastes and social attitudes changed. The first sign of this was an article by the influential &quot;National Review&quot; in its 1858 article &quot;Charlatan Poetry: Martin Farquhar Tupper&quot;. Acknowledging that the poet&#x27;s popularity was &quot;one of the most unquestionable facts of the day ... We are quite aware that it would be utterly beyond our strength to displace him from his stronghold in public favour&quot;, the article proceeds with a lengthy criticism of his poetry: &quot;[we] belong to that small but respectable minority who regard Mr. Tupper&#x27;s versicular philosophy as superficial and conceited twaddle&quot;.

Although it remained popular for many years, the ultimate challenge to the work&#x27;s further longevity was that &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot; presents a style and viewpoint that are inextricably linked and of interest only to those who lived during the early-to-mid Victorian period. In his biography of Tupper, Hudson (1949) contends that &quot;the success of &#x27;Proverbial Philosophy&#x27; ... sprang primarily from the moral and religious movement of early Victorian days which gradually lost its impetus as the reign proceeded. It was the belief that art must be linked with morality that furthered the astonishing advance of Tupper&#x27;s book&quot;. Dingley (2004) agrees: &quot;He presented as vatic wisdom the established convictions of his readership, which responded by venerating him as a sage. But as those convictions themselves began to crumble in the 1860s, under the pressure of scientific advance and social change, so Tupper’s status declined and he came to seem an embarrassing survival from a superseded past, a victim of the progress he had so earnestly celebrated.&quot; Collins (2002) adds that the work was a victim of its own success: &quot;The children who had once received gift book editions of Tupper for their birthdays were heartily sick of the man.&quot; As a piece of art that spoke only to people of its own time, the work has never experienced a revival of interest: &quot;It put the weight of tradition and common sense behind social values and interpretations which were in reality peculiar to Victorianism.&quot;
Given that &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot; was published by the author when he was a young man, who went on to live a long life and write prolifically, he was an easy target for satire from new generations and changing tastes – &quot;Tupper&#x27;s visage was everywhere ... His very generosity and omnipresence worked against him. By the 1870s, each week began to bring fresh pummelings by clever young men in humor magazines like &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;Figaro&quot; and &quot;The Comic&quot;.&quot; Hudson (1949) quotes examples dating from 1864:

Once the satire was played out, Tupper&#x27;s work was forgotten. , none of his works have been in print since the final edition of &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot; in 1881, although digital transcriptions and facsimiles can now be found.

===Influence on Walt Whitman===
Renowned American poet Walt Whitman was an enthusiastic supporter of Tupper while acting as editor for the Brooklyn Eagle (1846–1848) – for example, in his 1847 review of &quot;Probabilities: An Aid to Faith&quot; he commends the work&#x27;s &quot;lofty ... august scope of intention! ... The author ... is one of the rare men of the time. He turns up thoughts as with a plough ... we should like well to go into this book ... but justice to it would require many pages.&quot; Contemporary readers noted similarities between &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot; and Whitman&#x27;s writings (not always intending this to be a flattering comparison), and it seems likely that the work influenced the style of Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, although the two had many ideological differences. Coulombe (1996) suggests that Whitman also 

In later years, however, Whitman distanced himself from Tupper; Tupper had by then become highly unfashionable, and Whitman was seeking to create a separate style of art for the New World: &quot;His disagreement with Tupper, who considered the States as a literary adjunct to England, underscores his desire to create a distinctly American poetry.&quot; The influence from Britain continued, however, as Snodgrass (2008) notes that Whitman&#x27;s style in later works such as Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking &quot;was less influenced by homiletic writers such as Martin Tupper in favor of the more musical efforts of such poets as Tennyson.&quot;

===In other literature===
W. S. Gilbert alludes to Tupper in &quot;Bab Ballads&quot;. In the poem &quot;Ferdinando and Elvira, or, The Gentle Pieman&quot; ( 1866), Gilbert describes how two lovers are trying to find out who has been putting mottoes into &quot;paper crackers&quot; (a sort of 19th Century fortune cookie). Gilbert builds up to the following lines, eventually coming up with a spoof of Tupper&#x27;s own style from &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot;:

Such was Tupper&#x27;s fame that the 1933 &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; contains an entry &quot;Tupperian&quot;: &quot;Of, belonging to, or in the style of Martin F. Tupper&#x27;s Proverbial Philosophy&quot;, or &quot;An admirer of Tupper. So Tupperish &quot;a.&quot;, Tupperism, Tupperize &quot;v.&quot;&quot;. The entry attests references dating from 1858.

==Awards and recognition==
On 10 April 1845 Tupper was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on merit of being &quot;the author of &#x27;Proverbial Philosophy&#x27; and several other works&quot;, and &quot;eminent as a literary Man, and for his Archaeological attainments&quot;. A key contribution to archaeology was his excavation of Farley Heath on Farley Green, Surrey, done piecemeal at periods between 1839 and 1847, and as an organised project in 1848, which uncovered a Romano-Celtic temple as well as a number of &quot;coins, brooches and other metal objects&quot;. Tupper&#x27;s interpretation of what he found, however, was of questionable accuracy.

He received the 1844 Gold Medal for Science and Literature from the King of Prussia as a mark of the King&#x27;s admiration for &quot;Proverbial Philosophy&quot;.

<text>Maxwell Reed (2 April 1919 – 31 October 1974) was a Northern Irish actor who became a matinee idol in British films during the 1940s and 1950s.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Reed was born in Larne. He left school aged fifteen to work on ships, including as a blockade runner. He wanted to act and ended up studying at RADA for a year. During World War II he served in the RAF and then the Merchant Navy. After demobilisation he worked as an extra and in repertory. He did a screen test for Riverside Studios at Rank and joined The Company of Youth at the age of 27.

Reed made his film debut in &quot;The Years Between&quot; (1946) and then appeared in &quot;Gaiety George&quot; (1946), both in uncredited roles.

===Leading man===
Producer Sydney Box thought Reed had star potential and promoted him to leading man status for &quot;Daybreak&quot;, a film noir which Box produced and co-wrote with his wife Muriel; Reed played an employee of Eric Portman&#x27;s character Eddie who lusts after Eddie&#x27;s wife, played by Ann Todd. The film was made in 1946, but not released until 1948 because of censorship issues.

Box then cast Reed opposite Patricia Roc as one of the leads in a film made immediately after but released before &quot;Daybreak&quot;: &quot;The Brothers&quot; (1947).

Reed followed it with a rare sympathetic character in &quot;Dear Murderer&quot; (1947), from a script by Box, which again starred Portman. He then made two films opposite Anne Crawford, &quot;Night Beat&quot; (1947) and &quot;Daughter of Darkness&quot; (1948), where he was back to playing his usual scoundrels. He had the lead in a film called &quot;Streets Paved with Water&quot; but this was abandoned during filming.

Reed had more of a support role in &quot;The Lost People&quot; (1949), co-directed by Muriel Box, and &quot;Madness of the Heart&quot; (1949), starring Margaret Lockwood. After his initial late 1940s success he then starred in his first B movie, &quot;Blackout&quot; (1950). This was followed by a supporting role in &quot;The Clouded Yellow&quot; (1950) with Jean Simmons and Trevor Howard, then the lead in some more B pictures, &quot;The Dark Man&quot; (1950) and &quot;There Is Another Sun&quot; (1951). Reed said in June 1950 that &quot;they tried to make me a star too soon.&quot;

Reed moved to the U.S. to make &quot;Flame of Araby&quot; (1952), starring Maureen O&#x27;Hara and Jeff Chandler. He returned to Britain to play the villain opposite Yvonne de Carlo and Rock Hudson in the Anglo-American production &quot;Sea Devils&quot; (1953); he was also part of the ensemble cast of Ealing Studios&#x27; &quot;The Square Ring&quot; (1953).

After making &quot;Captain Phantom&quot; (1953) in Italy, Reed starred in more British B movies, &quot;Marilyn&quot; (1953), &quot;Before I Wake&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Brain Machine&quot; (1956). He had a small role in &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; (1956).

===Hollywood===
Reed moved to Hollywood permanently in the late 1950s and guest starred on TV shows like &quot;Celebrity Playhouse&quot; and &quot;The Betty Hutton Show&quot;. He landed the title role in the 1950s television series &quot;Captain David Grief&quot;, based on short stories by Jack London. It ran for two seasons in syndication, and was the first television series made on location in Hawaii; the first nine episodes were shot on Maui before production moved to southern California.

Reed had support roles in films like &quot;The Notorious Landlady&quot; (1962) and appeared as a guest star in television series such as &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Kraft Mystery Theater&quot;, &quot;The Beachcomber&quot;, &quot;The Lloyd Bridges Show&quot;, &quot;The Great Adventure&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;.

His last feature film was &quot;Picture Mommy Dead&quot; (1966).

His last acting role was back in Britain, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; episode &quot;The Dancing Men&quot; in 1968.

==Personal life==
Reed was the first husband of actress Joan Collins, whom he married on 24 May 1952. He is reported to have raped her when dating and she married him out of shame. They were separated in 1954 and the marriage ended in divorce in 1956, after which Reed sued her for alimony, claiming that he had earned only $1,000 over the previous 12 months. He later withdrew this claim.

He died from cancer in 1974, aged 55, in London.

<doc id="595881" wikidata="Q3376654" url="?curid=595881" title="Peter Holm (singer)">
<text>Peter Holm (born Peter Gustaf Carl Sjöholm; 16 June 1947) is a former pop singer and Swedish playboy who was married to actress Joan Collins between November 1985 and August 1987. He became her manager and together they co-produced two of her television mini-series, &quot;Sins&quot; and &quot;Monte Carlo&quot;.

==Singer==
Holm&#x27;s pre-Collins singing career began with a psychedelic phase in the late 1960s before his high-pitched voice found its natural home doing Euro-pop. His best known song is &quot;Monja&quot; (aka &quot;Monia&quot; in the French version). Other songs included &quot;Syster Jane&quot; (a Swedish cover version of New World&#x27;s &quot;Sister Jane&quot;) and &quot;You Will Be Mine.&quot;

==Marriage==
Holm married actress Joan Collins 6 November 1985. Collins sought an annulment in December 1986 and was granted a final divorce 24 August 1987. 
According to Collins, the marriage quickly degenerated into a string of &quot;interminable arguments... and hearty crockery-throwing rows.&quot; She said Holm was a bully with a ferocious temper and &quot;the most combative person I&#x27;ve ever met.&quot;

In December 1986, Collins received a restraining order against Holm. Undaunted, he gave interviews blaming Collins&#x27;s identification with her &quot;Dynasty&quot; character. &quot;Joan is consumed by Alexis, that&#x27;s why she&#x27;s doing this. She really loves me and I love her and we&#x27;ll get back together, I know it.&quot; He contested a pre-nuptial agreement, limiting him to 20 per cent of Collins&#x27;s $5 million earnings during their 13 months together. 

Collins hired flamboyant divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson and the proceedings became a media circus. When Holm and his supporters picketed Collins&#x27; Beverly Hills house waving placards, he became a national punchline with jokes from David Letterman.

At the trial, Mitchelson produced Holm&#x27;s secret lover, an aspiring starlet called Romina Danielson, and grilled her so intensely she fainted on the stand.

Holm lost his case, collecting only $80,000 as agreed in the pre-nup. A New York radio station hosted a fundraiser for him and he retreated to Switzerland. Soon after the divorce, Holm inherited money of his own.

Collins gave her candid side of the break-up in &quot;Second Act&quot;, her second volume of memoirs, and subsequently referred to him only as &quot;The Swede.&quot;

<doc id="595882" wikidata="Q575986" url="?curid=595882" title="Diver propulsion vehicle">
<text>A diver propulsion vehicle (DPV), also known as an underwater propulsion vehicle, sea scooter, underwater scooter, or swimmer delivery vehicle (SDV) by armed forces, is an item of diving equipment used by scuba divers to increase range underwater. Range is restricted by the amount of breathing gas that can be carried, the rate at which that breathing gas is consumed, and the battery power of the DPV. Time limits imposed on the diver by decompression requirements may also limit safe range in practice. DPVs have recreational, scientific and military applications.

DPVs include a range of configurations from small, easily portable scooter units with a small range and low speed, to faired or enclosed units capable of carrying several divers longer distances at higher speeds.

The earliest recorded DPVs were used for military purposes during World War II and were based on torpedo technology and components.

==Structure==

A DPV usually consists of a pressure-resistant watertight casing containing an underwater thruster, or a battery-powered electric motor, which drives a propeller The design must ensure that the propeller cannot harm the diver, diving equipment or marine life, the vehicle cannot be accidentally started or run away from the diver, and it remains approximately neutrally buoyant while in use underwater.

==Application==
DPVs are useful for extending the range of an autonomous diver that is otherwise restricted by the amount of breathing gas that can be carried, the rate at which that breathing gas is consumed, which is increased by exertion and diver fatigue, and the time limits imposed by decompression obligation, which depend on the dive profile. Typical uses include cave diving and technical diving where the vehicles help move bulky equipment and make better use of the limited underwater time imposed by the decompression requirements of deep diving. Military applications include delivery of combat divers and their equipment over distances or at speeds that would be otherwise impracticable. There are accessories that can be mounted to a DPV to make it more useful, such as lights, compasses, and video cameras. Use of a DPV on deep dives can reduce the risk of hypercapnia from overexertion and high breathing rate.

===Limitations===
DPV operation requires greater situational awareness than simply swimming, as some changes can happen much faster. Operating a DPV requires simultaneous depth control, buoyancy adjustment, monitoring of breathing gas, and navigation. Buoyancy control is vital for diver safety: The DPV has the capacity to dynamically compensate for poor buoyancy control by thrust vectoring while moving, but on stopping the diver may turn out to be dangerously positively or negatively buoyant if adjustments were not made to suit the changes in depth while moving. If the diver does not control the DPV properly, a rapid ascent or descent under power can result in barotrauma or decompression sickness. High speed travel in confined spaces, or limited visibility can increase the risk of impact with the surroundings at speeds where injury and damage are more likely. Many forms of smaller marine life are very well camouflaged or hide well and are only seen by divers who move very slowly and look carefully. Fast movement and noise can frighten some fish into hiding or swimming away, and the DPV is bulky and affects precise manoeuvring at close quarters. The DPV occupies at least one hand while in use and may get in the way while performing precision work like macro photography. Since the diver is not kicking for propulsion, they will generally get colder due to lower physical activity and increased water flow. This can be compensated by appropriate thermal insulation. If the operation of the DPV is critical to exit from a long penetration dive, it is necessary to allow for alternative propulsion in case of a breakdown to ensure safe exit before the breathing gas runs out. Control of the DPV is additional task loading and can distract the diver from other matters. A DPV can increase the risk of a silt-out if the thrust is allowed to wash over the bottom.

==History==
Human torpedoes or crewed torpedoes are a type of diver propulsion vehicle used as secret naval weapons in World War II. The name was commonly used to refer to the weapons that Italy, and later Britain, deployed in the Mediterranean and used to attack ships in enemy harbours.
The first human torpedo was the Italian &quot;Maiale&quot; (&quot;Pig&quot;). In operation, it was carried by another vessel (usually a normal submarine), and launched near the target. It was electrically propelled, with two crewmen in diving suits and rebreathers riding astride. They steered the torpedo at slow speed to the target, used the detachable warhead as a limpet mine and then rode the torpedo away. The nose of the torpedo was filled with pounds of TNT and would be hung under a ship&#x27;s keel.

The idea was successfully applied by the Italian navy (&quot;Regia Marina&quot;) early in World War II and then copied by the British when they discovered how effective this weapon could be after three Italian units successfully penetrated the harbour of Alexandria and damaged the British battleships and , and the tanker &quot;Sagona.&quot; The official Italian name for their craft was &quot;Siluro a Lenta Corsa&quot; (SLC or &quot;Slow-running torpedo&quot;), but the Italian operators nicknamed it &quot;Maiale&quot; after their inventor Teseo Tesei said that it was making the noise of a pig while moored on the beach. The British versions were named &quot;chariots&quot;.
The Motorised Submersible Canoe (MSC), nicknamed &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, was built by British Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II as an underwater vehicle for a single frogman to perform clandestine reconnaissance or attacks against enemy vessels.

==Types ==

===Diver-tugs, tow-behind, scooters===
The most common type of DPV tows the diver who holds onto handles on the stern or bow. Tow-behind scooters are most efficient by placing the diver parallel to and above the propeller wash. The diver wears a harness that includes a crotch-strap with a D-ring on the front of the strap. The scooter is rigged with a tow leash that clips to the scooter with releasable metal snap.

===Swimmer delivery vehicles===

Swimmer Delivery Vehicles (SDVs) are wet subs designed to transport frogmen from a combat swimmer unit or naval Special Forces underwater, over long distances. SDVs carry a pilot, co-pilot/navigator, and combat swimmer team and their equipment, to and from maritime mission objectives on land or at sea. The pilot and co-pilot are often a part of the swimmer team. An example of a modern SDV in use today is the SEAL Delivery Vehicle used by the United States Navy SEALs and British Special Boat Service.

For long-range missions, SDVs can carry their own onboard breathing gas supply to extend the range of the swimmer&#x27;s scuba equipment.

SDVs are typically used to land special operations forces or plant limpet mines on the hull of enemy ships. In the former usage, they can land a combat swimmer team covertly on a hostile shore in order to conduct missions on land. After completing their mission, the team may return to the SDV to exfiltrate back to the mother-ship. For extended missions on land, a team can be re-supplied by contact with other SDVs. In the latter usage, SDVs can stealthily plant mines and other bombs on ships or port infrastructure and then retreat to a safe distance before detonating the explosives. In addition to destroying targets, the SDV can mislead enemies as to where they are being attacked from. One type of SDV—the Mark 9 SEAL Delivery Vehicle—was also capable of firing torpedoes, giving it the standoff ability to attack from up to away.

The origins of the SDV stems from the Italian human torpedoes and the British Motorised Submersible Canoe used during World War II.

===Manned torpedoes===

These are torpedo or fish-shaped vehicles for one or more divers typically sitting astride them or in hollows inside. The human torpedo was used to great effect by commando frogmen in World War II, who were able to sink more than 100,000 tons worth of ships in the Mediterranean alone. Similar vehicles have been made for work divers or sport divers but better streamlined as these do not have warheads; the &quot;Dolphin&quot; made on the Isle of Wight (UK) in the 1971s is an example. Some Farallon and Aquazepp scooters are torpedo-shaped with handles near the bow and a raised seat at the rear to support the diver&#x27;s crotch against the slipstream.
The Russian Protei-5 and Proton carry the diver attached to the top. The New Zealand made Proteus is strapped onto the diver&#x27;s cylinder.

===Subskimmers===

The Subskimmer is a submersible rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RIB). On the surface it is powered by a petrol engine, when submerged the petrol engine is sealed and it runs on battery-electric thrusters mounted on a steerable cross-arm. It can self inflate and deflate, transforming itself from a fast, light, surface boat to a submerged DPV. Started in the 1970s by Submarine Products Ltd. of Hexham, Northumberland, England, &quot;Subskimmer&quot; is now a tradename owned by Marine Specialised Technology.

===Wet subs===

As DPVs get bigger they gradually merge into submarines. A wet sub is a small submarine where the crew spaces are flooded at ambient pressure and the crew must wear diving gear. Covert military operations use wet subs to deliver and retrieve operators into harbors and near-shore undetected. An example is the Multi-Role Combatant Craft (MRCC).

=== Towed sleds ===
These are unpowered boards (usually rectangular) towed by a surface boat which function as diving planes. The diver holds onto the sled and may use a quick-release tether to reduce fatigue. Depth control while submerged is by adjusting the angle of attack. Sometimes known as manta-boards, after the manta ray. Towed sleds are useful for surveys and searches in good visibility in waters where there are not too many large obstacles. The route is largely controlled by the towing vessel, but the diver has a limited amount of control over vertical and lateral excursions.

<doc id="595885" wikidata="Q945212" url="?curid=595885" title="Oxley Highway">
<text>Oxley Highway is a rural highway in New South Wales, Australia, linking Nevertire, Gilgandra, Coonabarabran, Tamworth, and Walcha to Port Macquarie, on the coast of the Tasman Sea. It was named to commemorate John Oxley, the first European to explore much of inland New South Wales in 1818. 

==Route==
Oxley Highway commences at the intersection with Mitchell Highway at Nevertire and travels in an easterly direction through Warren to Gilgandra, where it intersects with Castlereagh Highway. It shares a concurrency with Newell Highway from there to Coonabarabran, where it splits off and heads east again through Gunnedah to Tamworth, where it shares another concurrency with New England Highway from there to Bendemeer. It splits off again and heads east to intersect with Thunderbolts Way at Walcha, continuing east through Yarrowitch, Ellenborough, Long Flat, Wauchope, and intersects with Pacific Highway just east of Wauchope, before eventually terminating at Port Macquarie.

About 45 kilometres of the Yarrowitch to Wauchope section is unfenced and livestock (cattle) may be encountered there, along with other wild animals on most of the highway. Kangaroos are the most likely of those to be spotted, but wombats and other marsupials may be found.

==History==
Work commenced in 1838 with the use of convicts working from Port Macquarie towards a spot known as &quot;Prisoners&#x27; Garden&quot; about 20 km from Yarrowitch. Here it is said that the convicts were chained up each night. In 1842 the track from the Northern Tablelands to Port Macquarie was opened for the first time. Wool carried along this new route reduced the travelling time to 10 days, as opposed to 12–14 weeks for the trip to Maitland. The section from Walcha to Bendemeer existed as a mapped road in 1857, was surveyed in 1867, and proclaimed a Parish Road in c.1889. West of Walcha the road was only suitable for bullock teams and they too had difficulties, especially with the ranges.

The steep range section from Yarras to Yarrowitch was in serious need of repair in 1925 when the Main Roads Board was formed. Following a re-survey in 1927 the road was altered between Yarras and Tobins Camp.

The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW). Oxley Highway was declared (as Main Road No. 11) from the intersection with North Coast Highway (today Pacific Highway) near Wauchope, via Walcha, Tamworth, Gunnedah, Coonabarabran, and Gilgrandra to the intersection with North-Western Highway (today Mitchell Highway) at Trangie, Main Road 202 was declared from Nevertire to Warren (and continuing north to Quambone eventually to Coonabrarbran), and Main Road 203 was declared from Warren to Collie, on the same day, 8 August 1928; with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, these were amended to State Highway 11 and Main Roads 202 and 203 on 8 April 1929.

Oxley Highway was split into two parts, with the section between Tamworth and Bendemeer defined as part of Great Northern Highway (known as New England Highway from March 1933), on 23 June 1931; as a consequence Oxley Highway was re-declared to run from Trangie to Tamworth, and then from Bendemeer to Wauchope. On 30 September 1933 the section between Walcha and Port Macquarie was officially opened; Walcha Shire maintained 106 km of the highway until July 1966 when this part was taken over by the Department of Main Roads.

The western end of the highway was rerouted through Warren to terminate at Nevertire instead on 13 June 1951, subsuming Main Road 203 and the alignment of Main Road 202 between Warren and Nevertire; Main Road 202 was truncated at Warren as a result, and Main Road 347 was extended along the old alignment from Collie to Trangie (and continuing south via Albert to Melrose). Newell Highway was declared a National Highway in 1992, and was re-declared to form one continuous highway on 15 January 1993: as a consequence, Oxley Highway was split into three parts, re-declared to run from the intersection with Mitchell Highway in Nevertire to the intersection with Newell Highway in Gilgandra, then from the intersection with Newell Highway just northeast of Coonabarabran to Tamworth, and then from Bendemeer to Port Macquarie.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Oxley Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 11, from Nevertire to Gilgandra, then from Coonabarabran to Tamworth, and then from Bendemeer to Port Macquarie.

Oxley Highway was signed National Route 34 across its entire length in 1955. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, this was replaced with route B56 between Coonabarabran and Port Macquarie, with the rest of the highway west of Coonabarabran unallocated.

<text>This is a list of words coming to English from or via Czech, or originating in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, often called Czech lands. Words and expressions derived from the Czech language are called Bohemisms.

*[[Absurdistan]] (in Czech &quot;Absurdistán&quot;) – word created by Eastern Bloc dissidents, passed into English mainly through works of Václav Havel. 
*Dollar – from Czech tolar (taler), a silver coin used in Czechia since the 15th century.
*[[háček]] – a diacritical mark, literally &quot;little hook&quot;, e.g. č is letter c having háček. Also known as &quot;caron&quot;.
*[[howitzer]] – from &quot;houfnice&quot;, a 15th-century Hussite catapult; &quot;houf&quot; meaning &quot;crowd&quot; or &quot;band&quot;
*[[kolache]] – from &quot;koláč&quot; or &quot;koláček&quot;.
*koczwarism – Sexual asphyxiophilia in medical slang; after František Kočvara
*[[pistol]] – from píšťala, a 15th-century Hussite firearm (alternative sources have been suggested, see the article for details)
*[[polka]] – from &quot;Polák&quot; or &quot;polský&quot;, a Czech dance named in remembrance of the November Uprising of 1830; or from &quot;Půlka&quot;, in English &quot;half&quot; because of its tempo
*[[Pram (ship)|pram]] – from Czech &quot;prám&quot;, a flatbottomed boat, through Dutch praam and Middle Dutch praem 
*[[robot]] – from Czech &quot;robot&quot; (machine resembling a human being), introduced in Karel Čapek&#x27;s play R.U.R. from the 1920s.
*[[Semtex]] – a plastic explosive named after Semtín, part of the city of Pardubice, Czech Republic, location of its manufacturer.
*Slivovice (Slivovitz), plum brandy – from Czech (more precisely, Moravian) word slíva (plum)

Sometimes it is mistakenly claimed [[Hocus Pocus (magic)|hocus-pocus]] has Czech origin since &quot;pokus&quot; means &quot;trial&quot; (attempt) or experiment.

<doc id="595888" wikidata="Q5639168" url="?curid=595888" title="Hail, Vermont!">
<text>&quot;Hail, Vermont!&quot; was the former state song of the U.S. state of Vermont. The song was written by Josephine Hovey Perry of Barre, Vermont, and was officially made the state song in 1938. The song was significant at its time of publication for mentioning Vermont&#x27;s daughters as well as her sons. From the 1950s through the 1960s the song was given to Vermont school children in a soft-bound booklet titled &quot;Vermont Sings.&quot; On May 22, 2000, the song was replaced by &quot;&#x27;These Green Mountains.&quot;&#x27;
Though not designated the official state song by legislative statute, &quot;Hail Vermont!&quot; was proclaimed the state song by Governor of Vermont George Aiken to be performed in the Vermont Pavilion at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The current state song, &quot;These Green Mountains&quot; became the official state song by passage of Act 99 of the Vermont General Assembly&#x27;s 1999–2000 biennial session.

==Lyrics==
: Hail to Vermont!
: Lovely Vermont!
: Hail to Vermont so fearless!
: Sing we a song!
: Sing loud and long!
: To our little state so peerless!
: Green are her hills, Clear are her rills,
: Fair are her lakes and rivers and valleys;
: Blue are her skies, Peaceful she lies,
: But when roused to a call she speedily rallies.

: Hail to Vermont! Dear old Vermont!
: Our love for you is great.
: We cherish your name,
: We laud! We acclaim!
: Our own Green Mountain State.

: Proud of Vermont, Lovely Vermont,
: Proud of her charm and her beauty;
: Proud of her name, Proud of her fame,
: We&#x27;re proud of her sense of duty;
: Proud of her past, Proud first and last,
: Proud of her lands and proud of her waters;
: Her men are true. Her women, too.
: We&#x27;re proud of her sons and proud of her daughters.

: Hail to Vermont! Dear old Vermont!
: Our love for you is great.
: We cherish your name,
: We laud! We acclaim!
: Our own Green Mountain State.

<doc id="595890" wikidata="Q2970132" url="?curid=595890" title="Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire">
<text>Newark Castle, in Newark-on-Trent in the English county of Nottinghamshire, was founded in the mid 12th century by Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln. Originally a timber castle, it was rebuilt in stone towards the end of the century.

The castle was slighted (dismantled) in the 17th century as a result of the English Civil War, and restored in the 19th century, first by Anthony Salvin in the 1840s and then by the corporation of Newark who bought the site in 1889.

==History==
In a charter generally thought to date to 1135, King Henry I granted the Bishop of Lincoln permission to build a castle. The charter reads:

Alexander also established a mint at the castle. This early castle was most likely of timber construction, and was rebuilt in stone towards the end of the century. King John died after a feast at this castle on the night of 18 October 1216 from dysentery, according to tradition from eating a &quot;surfeit of peaches&quot;.

The castle was slighted in 1648 and left derelict. Between 1845 and 1848 architect Anthony Salvin restored the castle, and in 1889 the corporation of Newark purchased the building and carried out further restoration work.

The castle is a scheduled monument, a &quot;nationally important&quot; historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a Grade I listed building (first listed in 1950) and recognised as an internationally important structure. The Gilstrap Heritage Centre is located on the castle grounds. The centre featured exhibits about the castle, and the town&#x27;s history during the English Civil Wars. The Gilstrap Centre is now the Newark Registration Office. Admission to the gardens is free and tours are conducted by the Castle Ranger.

<text>In mathematics, the Chowla–Mordell theorem is a result in number theory determining cases where a Gauss sum is the square root of a prime number, multiplied by a root of unity. It was proved and published independently by Sarvadaman Chowla and Louis Mordell, around 1951.

In detail, if formula_1 is a prime number, formula_2 a nontrivial Dirichlet character modulo formula_1, and 

:formula_4

where formula_5 is a primitive formula_1-th root of unity in the complex numbers, then

:formula_7

is a root of unity if and only if formula_2 is the quadratic residue symbol modulo formula_1. The &#x27;if&#x27; part was known to Gauss: the contribution of Chowla and Mordell was the &#x27;only if&#x27; direction. The ratio in the theorem occurs in the functional equation of L-functions.

<doc id="595898" wikidata="Q7268351" url="?curid=595898" title="Quadratic Gauss sum">
<text>In number theory, quadratic Gauss sums are certain finite sums of roots of unity. A quadratic Gauss sum can be interpreted as a linear combination of the values of the complex exponential function with coefficients given by a quadratic character; for a general character, one obtains a more general Gauss sum. These objects are named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, who studied them extensively and applied them to quadratic, cubic, and biquadratic reciprocity laws.

== Definition ==

For an odd prime number and an integer , the quadratic Gauss sum is defined as
: formula_1
where formula_2 is a primitive th root of unity, for example formula_3.
Equivalently, 
: formula_4

For divisible by , and we have formula_5 and thus
: formula_6

For not divisible by , we have formula_7, implying that
: formula_8
where
: formula_9
is the Gauss sum defined for any character modulo .

== Properties ==

* The value of the Gauss sum is an algebraic integer in the th cyclotomic field formula_10.
* The evaluation of the Gauss sum for an integer not divisible by a prime can be reduced to the case :
:: formula_11

* The exact value of the Gauss sum for is given by the formula:
:: formula_12

; Remark
In fact, the identity
: formula_13
was easy to prove and led to one of Gauss&#x27;s proofs of quadratic reciprocity. However, the determination of the &quot;sign&quot; of the Gauss sum turned out to be considerably more difficult: Gauss could only establish it after several years&#x27; work. Later, Dirichlet, Kronecker, Schur and other mathematicians found different proofs.

== Generalized quadratic Gauss sums ==

Let be natural numbers. The generalized quadratic Gauss sum is defined by

:formula_14.

The classical quadratic Gauss sum is the sum .

; Properties

*The Gauss sum depends only on the residue class of and modulo .
*Gauss sums are multiplicative, i.e. given natural numbers with one has

::formula_15

:This is a direct consequence of the Chinese remainder theorem.

*One has if except if divides in which case one has
::formula_16.

:Thus in the evaluation of quadratic Gauss sums one may always assume .

*Let be integers with and even. One has the following analogue of the quadratic reciprocity law for (even more general) Gauss sums
::formula_17.

*Define
::formula_18
:for every odd integer . The values of Gauss sums with and are explicitly given by

::formula_19

:Here is the Jacobi symbol. This is the famous formula of Carl Friedrich Gauss.

* For the Gauss sums can easily be computed by completing the square in most cases. This fails however in some cases (for example, even and odd), which can be computed relatively easy by other means. For example, if is odd and one has

::formula_20

:where is some number with . As another example, if 4 divides and is odd and as always then . This can, for example, be proved as follows: because of the multiplicative property of Gauss sums we only have to show that if and are odd with . If is odd then is even for all . For every , the equation has at most two solutions in . Indeed, if formula_21 and formula_22 are two solutions of same parity, then formula_23 for some integer formula_24, but formula_25 is odd, hence formula_26. Because of a counting argument runs through all even residue classes modulo exactly two times. The geometric sum formula then shows that .

*If is an odd square-free integer and , then

::formula_27

:If is not squarefree then the right side vanishes while the left side does not. Often the right sum is also called a quadratic Gauss sum.

*Another useful formula

::formula_28

:holds for and an odd prime number , and for and .

<text>The Scottish Crop Research Institute more commonly known as SCRI was a scientific institute located in Invergowrie near Dundee, Scotland. when SCRI merged with the Macaulay Land Use Institute to form The James Hutton Institute.

==History==

The institute was opened in 1951 in Invergowrie under the name Scottish Horticultural Research Institute (SHRI). In 1981, the SHRI merged with the Scottish Plant Breeding Station (SPBS), which at the time was located near Edinburgh. Operations of the SPBS moved to the institute&#x27;s site at Invergowrie and became the Scottish Crop Research Institute. In 1987 the institute accepted managerial responsibility for Biomathematics &amp; Statistics Scotland, formerly the Scottish Agricultural Statistics Service. The commercial arm of the SCRI, Mylnefield Research Services, was launched in 1989. In April 2011 SCRI merged with the Macaulay Land Use Institute to form a new body, The James Hutton Institute.

==Research==

The SCRI has both staff and PhD students who do research into several different aspects of plant science. Research facilities include laboratories, office space, glasshouses, growth chambers and 172 hectares of land which is used for field work. Research at SCRI is organised into four programmes: environment plant interactions, plant pathology, genetics and plant products and food quality. The institute carries out research funded by the Scottish Government&#x27;s &quot;Programme 1&quot; for profitable and sustainable agriculture and the co-ordinator of Programme 1 is staff member Professor Howard Davies. The institute is also undertaking research into how climate change in Scotland will affect crop production, as the institute is involved with the Scottish Government&#x27;s Agriculture and Climate Change Stakeholder Group.

<text>Patrick Warburton (born November 14, 1964) is an American actor. On television, he has played David Puddy on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, the title character on &quot;The Tick&quot;, Jeb Denton on &quot;Less than Perfect&quot;, Jeff Bingham on &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; and Lemony Snicket on &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;. His voice roles include Joe Swanson in &quot;Family Guy&quot;, Sheriff Bronson Stone in &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;, Kronk in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;, Buzz Lightyear in &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot;, and Brock Samson in &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; In the audiobook &quot;The Eye of the Bedlam Bride&quot; by Matt Dinniman, he voices the father of the main character Carl in the Dungeon Crawler Carl series. In advertising, he plays a &quot;control enthusiast&quot; in commercials for National Car Rental.

==Early life ==
Warburton was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on November 14, 1964. He is the son of orthopedic surgeon John Charles Warburton Jr. and Barbara Jeanne Gratz (an actress credited as Barbara Lord). Warburton and his three sisters, Mary, Lara, and Megan, were raised in a &quot;very religious&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; Catholic family in Huntington Beach, California, where he attended Saints Simon and Jude Catholic School. Warburton later attended Servite High School (in Anaheim, California), then transferred to Newport Harbor High School (in Newport Beach, California). He studied marine biology at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, California, but dropped out to pursue modeling and acting.

==Career==

In the 1990s, Warburton was known for his recurring role in &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as David Puddy, an unflappable auto mechanic who was the on-again, off-again boyfriend of Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). He played Eric in the sitcom &quot;Dave&#x27;s World&quot;, and had a small role in the 2002 film &quot;Men in Black II&quot; as J&#x27;s new partner, T.

Warburton played the title role in FOX&#x27;s short-lived series &quot;The Tick&quot;. He has repeatedly criticized FOX&#x27;s mismanagement of the series after its cancellation, stating that the network &quot;apparently didn&#x27;t have a clue&quot;. In 2016 he was a producer for the Amazon streaming version of the series.

He played Nick Sharp in &quot;8 Simple Rules;&quot; and in 2003, joined the cast of &quot;Less than Perfect&quot; as anchorman Jeb Denton. He also played Jeff Bingham in &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; and Rip Riley in the FX series &quot;Archer&quot;.
Warburton has provided voices for several animated films and TV programs, including a lead character in &quot;Game Over&quot;, Buzz Lightyear and the Little Green Men in &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot;, and Kronk in &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;, with David Spade, Eartha Kitt, and John Goodman. Spade and Warburton reunited for the CBS sitcom &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;, which aired from 2007 to 2013, and &quot;Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser&quot; in 2015. Warburton reprised his role as Kronk for the direct-to-video sequel &quot;Kronk&#x27;s New Groove&quot; and the subsequent TV series &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New School&quot;. He voiced Steve Barkin in the Disney Channel show &quot;Kim Possible&quot;.

Warburton was also cast in &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, where he voices Brock Samson, and voices Joe Swanson on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Family Guy&quot; and Detective Cash in &quot;The Batman&quot;. He recorded voices for the animated feature films &quot;Hoodwinked&quot;, &quot;Chicken Little&quot;, &quot;Bee Movie&quot;, &quot;Open Season&quot;. In video games, he voiced Lok in the &quot;Tak and the Power of Juju&quot; video game series and has also reprised the role again in the television series of the same name, as well as Flynn in the &quot;Skylanders&quot; series. He was also the voice of Commander Blaine H. Tate on the Comedy Central animated series &quot;Moonbeam City&quot; in October 2015.

Warburton appeared on GSN&#x27;s &quot;Poker Royale Celebrities vs. the Pros&quot; tournament in 2005, winning the tournament and the $50,000 grand prize. On November 8, 2009, he appeared as Wild West character Cal Johnson on &quot;Seth &amp; Alex&#x27;s (Almost Live) Comedy Show&quot;, hosted by Seth MacFarlane and Alex Borstein on Fox. He was also cast as Sheriff Bronson Stone in the Cartoon Network series &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;, and appeared as Bowser in a video by CollegeHumor, &quot;The Roast of Mario&quot;.

He appeared on the American version of &quot;Top Gear&quot; on February 21, 2012, where he set the &quot;Big Star, Small Car&quot; lap record, beating previous record-holder Arlene Tur.

Warburton starred in the 2016 NBC sitcom &quot;Crowded&quot;, where he and Carrie Preston played parents who were about to enjoy their empty-nest years only to find their daughters and his parents moving back in with them. It ran for one season of 13 episodes.

He is featured as the flight attendant, Patrick, in the &quot;preboarding&quot; video shown to guests at Soarin&#x27; Around the World in Disney California Adventure in Anaheim, California and Epcot at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida where he explains the ride&#x27;s requirements, reprising his role from the preboarding video of the predecessor ride, Soarin&#x27; Over California. He lent his voice to the droid G2-4T in the queue of Star Tours: The Adventures Continue at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida and Disneyland in Anaheim, California.

He starred as Lemony Snicket in the Netflix comedy drama series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;.

Despite being a lifelong fan of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team, Warburton has appeared at multiple New Jersey Devils games with his face (and chest) painted similar to that of his Devils crazed role in an episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, exhorting the crowd in a manner like that of his David Puddy character. His real-life relationship with the Devils began when the team invited him to drop the ceremonial first puck of the 1995 season, and he showed up with his face painted. After dropping the puck, he slipped and fell, but rescued the moment by regaining his balance and ripping off his shirt to reveal his chest was painted with the letter &quot;D&quot;, which came to be regarded as an iconic moment in Devils history. The Devils gave out a Puddy bobblehead doll to fans at a 2019 game.

In the commercial and advertising world, Warburton is the voice in the Carrier Corporation commercials for their air-conditioning and HVAC units, and was the voice of Superman in &quot;The Adventures of Seinfeld and Superman&quot; for American Express. He is the voice of Lewis in the &quot;Clark &amp; Lewis Expedition&quot; radio commercials for Horizon Air. In August 2009, he played a high-end PC in a &quot;Get a Mac&quot; ad for Apple Inc. He became the spokesman for Japanese automaker Honda&#x27;s &quot;Good Reasons&quot; advertising campaign in September 2011. He is the voice in NAPA&#x27;s &quot;Can of Know How&quot; commercial. In 2015, he appeared in National Car Rental&#x27;s &quot;Be the Boss of You&quot; commercials. He is the voice of the current &quot;Discover Fresh&quot; radio ad campaign by Souplantation, a California-based buffet-style restaurant chain (known as Sweet Tomatoes in other markets).

Warburton is also the voice of Ranger, a forest ranger, in a series of radio spots for the national Smokey Bear campaign sponsored by the U.S. Forest Service and the Ad Council.

In 2003, he appeared in the M&amp;Ms commercial &quot;You Don&#x27;t Eat Your Own Kind&quot;.

In 2024, Patrick voiced the father of the protagonist Carl in the 6th audiobook in the Dungeon Crawler Carl series, written by Matt Dinniman.

==Personal life==
In 1991, Warburton married Cathy Jennings, whom he met in college. The couple have three sons and one daughter: Talon, Shane, Gabriel, and Alexandra. They live in Santa Rosa Valley, California. 

Warburton is a Christian, and has said that he is willing to turn off &quot;Family Guy&quot; &quot;when it takes its religious humor too far&quot;, perceiving such moments &quot;as diminished returns&quot;. His mother, Barbara Warburton, is a member of the Parents Television Council, which is severely critical of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, on which he voices Joe Swanson. Politically, Warburton is a &quot;lifelong conservative&quot; but has &quot;very liberal views&quot; on some issues.
