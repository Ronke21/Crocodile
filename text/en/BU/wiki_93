<text>Ocean Colour Scene (often abbreviated to OCS) are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1989. They have had five top 10 albums, including a number one in 1997. They have also achieved seventeen top 40 singles and six top 10 singles to date.

==History==
===Early days (1990–1995)===
Ocean Colour Scene were formed from two other bands disbanding; The Boys (Steve Cradock) and Fanatics (Simon Fowler, Damon Minchella, Oscar Harrison). Fanatics had released an EP titled &quot;Suburban Love Songs&quot;. The name was decided upon when the band went through books in a library looking for words they liked. OCS signed to !Phffftt Records in 1990.

Their first single, &quot;Sway&quot;, was released in September 1990 during the indie era. When their record label was swallowed up by larger company Phonogram their eponymous début album was remixed, against the band&#x27;s wishes, to fit in with the Baggy/indie-dance musical trend of the time. The album was largely deemed a failure. Being in dispute with their label, the band were forced back onto unemployment benefits, with no real direction and being only able to write new music with no outlet for it.

In 1993, the start of the turnaround occurred. Paul Weller invited the band to support him on some dates of his tour. On the back of these performances, Weller invited guitarist Steve Cradock to play on one of his singles, and vocalist Simon Fowler to sing on his album &quot;Wild Wood&quot;. Cradock was asked to play live with Weller on his tour, and the money Cradock made allowed the band to keep paying rent for a studio.

===Britpop fame (1995–2000)===
The band recorded a demo that was sent to various industry figures. After hearing this tape, Noel Gallagher invited the band to play with Oasis on their 1995 tour. This support slot brought OCS to the attention of more record labels, and eventually in late 1995, the band signed with MCA Records.

With the explosion of the Britpop scene, OCS&#x27;s music became nationally and internationally known. Their second album &quot;Moseley Shoals&quot; was released to mixed-to-positive reviews, containing four hit singles and reached No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart. They also played at one of the concerts at Knebworth House supporting Oasis in August 1996.

&quot;Marchin&#x27; Already&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Moseley Shoals&quot;, went to No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart, displacing Oasis&#x27; &quot;Be Here Now&quot; at the top of the charts in 1997. In 1998 they headlined their own arena tour in support of &quot;Marchin&#x27; Already&quot; and played three sold out nights at Stirling Castle, Scotland.

&quot;One from the Modern&quot; was released in 1999, and peaked in the UK Albums Chart at No. 4. The record spawned three top 40 singles, &quot;Profit in Peace&quot;, &quot;So Low&quot; and &quot;July&quot;.

A Greatest Hits album, &quot;Songs for the Front Row&quot;, was released in 2001.

===Post-Britpop (2001–2008)===

After splitting with bassist Damon Minchella, the band continued to record and perform. Releases in 2001 (&quot;Mechanical Wonder&quot;), 2003 (&quot;North Atlantic Drift&quot;), 2005 (&quot;A Hyperactive Workout for the Flying Squad&quot;) and 2007 (&quot;On the Leyline&quot;) continued the trend of releasing new material every two years.

2004 saw the band release their first live album, &quot;Live: One for the Road&quot;. The album was a compilation of nineteen live tracks taken from various concerts. In 2006 the band released a live acoustic album, &quot;Live at the Jam House&quot;, which consisted of fifteen live tracks and also contained four new songs in &quot;Great Man in Waiting&quot;, &quot;The Word&quot;, &quot;Still Trying&quot; and &quot;Matilda&#x27;s England&quot;.
The band also released a live album in December 2006, which was recorded at Birmingham Academy and spread over two discs. People attending the gig were able to purchase the recording straight afterwards.

===Recent years (2009–present)===

In 2009, the band went into the studio with producer Gavin Monaghan, known for his work with Editors, Scott Matthews and The Twang, to work on a new album, &quot;Saturday&quot;, with a release date of 1 February 2010 to mark the 21st anniversary of the band. The album had a working title of &#x27;Rockfield&#x27;, named after the studios where it was recorded, but it was released as &quot;Saturday&quot; - both &quot;Rockfield&quot; and &quot;Saturday&quot; being tracks thereon.

On 2 November 2009, the band released a free downloadable version of a new song, &quot;Mrs Maylie&quot;. &quot;Magic Carpet Days&quot;, the first single from &quot;Saturday&quot;, was released on 25 January, followed by the album a few days later. The album charted at No. 35 on the UK Albums Chart. A second single, &quot;Saturday&quot;, was released in May 2010 but it failed to chart. On 24 July 2010 they performed at the Wickerman Festival.

On 11 October 2010, the band released a 4-CD box set, &quot;21&quot;, to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the band. It included many previously unreleased tracks and a brand new song entitled &quot;Twenty One&quot;.

In March 2011, the band released a 15th anniversary special edition of their 1996 hit album &quot;Moseley Shoals&quot;. It consisted of the full album, b-sides and live tracks. The band played a full UK tour in support of the re-release. December saw the limited edition release of a double CD/DVD release of the band&#x27;s Moseley Shoals gig at O2 Academy Birmingham, which was filmed on 26 February 2011. They performed an acoustic set at Lanford Live in 2011 for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

In December 2012, the band announced the forthcoming release of their tenth studio album, &quot;Painting&quot;, which was released on 11 February 2013. They also played at V-festival where &quot;Inbetweeners&quot; actor James Buckley performed &quot;The Circle&quot; with them in Chelmsford and at The Electric Picnic Festival in Stradbally, Ireland.

In 2014 a special edition of &quot;Marchin&#x27; Already&quot; was released on a 2 CD edition and a special deluxe 4 disc box set which included a DVD of their live performance at Stirling Castle in 1998. Early 2015 saw the band celebrate their 25th anniversary with some acoustic concerts around the UK. They released a double CD live album which was recorded at the Manchester concert on the tour.

The following year, in 2016, the band announced several special concerts around the UK to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their 1996 hit album &quot;Moseley Shoals&quot;. They also played several dates in Australia for the first time in their career.

On 22 June 2016, the band officially announced that Scottish musician Raymond Meade would be joining the band permanently on bass, following the departures of both Dan Sealey and Andy Bennett. Meade had already played live with the band since the start of the year.

In November 2018 the band unveiled their first new material in five years since the release of &quot;Painting&quot;. The four track EP was released on 10&quot; vinyl and available only at the band&#x27;s Christmas shows. The EP received a 5 stars rating from Flick of the Finger, with the publication stating that &#x27;Lushly textured, these four compelling and diverse new offerings are nothing short of brilliant.&#x27;

In 2023 the band released a career-spanning box set entitled &quot;Yesterday, Today 1992–2018&quot;, which contained all their studio albums and 5 bonus CDs, totalling 230 tracks. The set also came with a 72-page book. A companion vinyl box set was also released, covering their first three studio albums from 1992–1997. In May, a follow-up vinyl set was released, covering the three studio albums released between 1999 and 2003. August saw the release of the final box set, covering the remaining four albums from 2005 to 2013.

== Collaborative work ==
Most band members have supported and collaborated with other artists during the group&#x27;s existence. Simon Fowler, along with members of Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Space and The Spice Girls, was part of the supergroup England United who recorded the official song for the England national football team&#x27;s World Cup campaign in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. &quot;((How Does It Feel to Be) On Top of the World&quot; reached number 9 in the UK Singles Chart. Steve Cradock plays regularly with Paul Weller, as well as with Amy MacDonald.

During their peak (around the time of the &quot;Moseley Shoals&quot; release) OCS also regularly performed on stage with Noel and Liam Gallagher of Oasis, with whom they were on tour at the time. One particular performance of note with the Gallaghers was a rendition of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Day Tripper&quot;, which was included as a live B-side to &quot;The Circle&quot;. The song was also included on the B-side compilation album, &quot;B-sides, Seasides and Freerides&quot;. Noel Gallagher previewed an advance copy of the song during an interview on BBC Radio 1 with DJ Jo Whiley. The interview mainly focused on Oasis&#x27;s then forthcoming gig in the grounds of Knebworth House, where Ocean Colour Scene were one of the supporting acts. Over 2.6 million people applied for tickets for the shows, making it the most in-demand concert in UK history. There was a combined audience of over 250,000 people.

At a 2011 gig at the University of East Anglia, Ocean Colour Scene were joined on stage by former footballer Dion Dublin, an amateur percussionist, who accompanied them on The Dube, an instrument he invented.

<doc id="608317" wikidata="Q945238" url="?curid=608317" title="Peripheral neuropathy">
<text>Peripheral neuropathy, often shortened to neuropathy, refers to damage or disease affecting the nerves. Damage to nerves may impair sensation, movement, gland function, and/or organ function depending on which nerve fibers are affected. Neuropathies affecting motor, sensory, or autonomic nerve fibers result in different symptoms. More than one type of fiber may be affected simultaneously. Peripheral neuropathy may be acute (with sudden onset, rapid progress) or chronic (symptoms begin subtly and progress slowly), and may be reversible or permanent.

Common causes include systemic diseases (such as diabetes or leprosy), hyperglycemia-induced glycation, vitamin deficiency, medication (e.g., chemotherapy, or commonly prescribed antibiotics including metronidazole and the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin)), traumatic injury, ischemia, radiation therapy, excessive alcohol consumption, immune system disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or viral infection. It can also be genetic (present from birth) or idiopathic (no known cause). In conventional medical usage, the word &quot;neuropathy&quot; (, &quot;nervous system&quot; and , &quot;disease of&quot;) without modifier usually means &quot;peripheral neuropathy&quot;.

Neuropathy affecting just one nerve is called &quot;mononeuropathy&quot;, and neuropathy involving nerves in roughly the same areas on both sides of the body is called &quot;symmetrical polyneuropathy&quot; or simply &quot;polyneuropathy&quot;. When two or more (typically just a few, but sometimes many) separate nerves in disparate areas of the body are affected it is called &quot;mononeuritis multiplex&quot;, &quot;multifocal mononeuropathy&quot;, or &quot;multiple mononeuropathy&quot;.

Neuropathy may cause painful cramps, fasciculations (fine muscle twitching), muscle loss, bone degeneration, and changes in the skin, hair, and nails. Additionally, motor neuropathy may cause impaired balance and coordination or, most commonly, muscle weakness; sensory neuropathy may cause numbness to touch and vibration, reduced position sense causing poorer coordination and balance, reduced sensitivity to temperature change and pain, spontaneous tingling or burning pain, or allodynia (pain from normally nonpainful stimuli, such as light touch); and [[autonomic neuropathy]] may produce diverse symptoms, depending on the affected glands and organs, but common symptoms are poor bladder control, abnormal blood pressure or heart rate, and reduced ability to sweat normally.
==Classification==
Peripheral neuropathy may be classified according to the number and distribution of nerves affected (mononeuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, or polyneuropathy), the type of nerve fiber predominantly affected (motor, sensory, autonomic), or the process affecting the nerves; e.g., inflammation (neuritis), compression (compression neuropathy), chemotherapy (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy). The affected nerves are found in an EMG (electromyography) / NCS (nerve conduction study) test and the classification is applied upon exam completion.

===Mononeuropathy===

Mononeuropathy is a type of neuropathy that only affects a single nerve. Diagnostically, it is important to distinguish it from polyneuropathy because when a single nerve is affected, it is more likely to be due to localized trauma or infection.

The most common cause of mononeuropathy is physical compression of the nerve, known as compression neuropathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome and axillary nerve palsy are examples. Direct injury to a nerve, interruption of its blood supply resulting in (ischemia), or inflammation also may cause mononeuropathy.

===Polyneuropathy===

&quot;Polyneuropathy&quot; is a pattern of nerve damage that is quite different from mononeuropathy, often more serious and affecting more areas of the body. The term &quot;peripheral neuropathy&quot; sometimes is used loosely to refer to polyneuropathy. In cases of polyneuropathy, many nerve cells in various parts of the body are affected, without regard to the nerve through which they pass; not all nerve cells are affected in any particular case. In distal axonopathy, one common pattern is that the cell bodies of neurons remain intact, but the axons are affected in proportion to their length; the longest axons are the most affected. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common cause of this pattern. In demyelinating polyneuropathies, the myelin sheath around axons is damaged, which affects axons&#x27; ability to conduct electrical impulses. The third and least common pattern directly affects the cell bodies of neurons. This affects the sensory neurons (known as &quot;sensory neuronopathy&quot; or &quot;dorsal root ganglionopathy&quot;).

The effect of this is to cause symptoms in more than one part of the body, often symmetrically on the left and right sides. As for any neuropathy, the chief symptoms include motor symptoms such as weakness or clumsiness of movement; and sensory symptoms such as unusual or unpleasant sensations such as tingling or burning; reduced ability to feel sensations such as texture or temperature, and impaired balance when standing or walking. In many polyneuropathies, these symptoms occur first and most severely in the feet. Autonomic symptoms also may occur, such as dizziness on standing up, erectile dysfunction, and difficulty controlling urination.

Polyneuropathies usually are caused by processes that affect the body as a whole. Diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance are the most common causes. Hyperglycemia-induced formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is related to diabetic neuropathy. Other causes relate to the particular type of polyneuropathy, and there are many different causes of each type, including inflammatory diseases such as Lyme disease, vitamin deficiencies, blood disorders, and toxins (including alcohol and certain prescribed drugs).

Most types of polyneuropathy progress fairly slowly, over months or years, but rapidly progressive polyneuropathy also occurs. It is important to recognize that at one time it was thought that many of the cases of small fiber peripheral neuropathy with typical symptoms of tingling, pain, and loss of sensation in the feet and hands were due to glucose intolerance before a diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes. However, in August 2015, the Mayo Clinic published a scientific study in the Journal of the Neurological Sciences showing &quot;no significant increase in...symptoms...in the prediabetes group&quot;, and stated that &quot;A search for alternate neuropathy causes is needed in patients with prediabetes.&quot;

The treatment of polyneuropathies is aimed firstly at eliminating or controlling the cause, secondly at maintaining muscle strength and physical function, and thirdly at controlling symptoms such as neuropathic pain.

===Mononeuritis multiplex===
Mononeuritis multiplex, occasionally termed polyneuritis multiplex, is simultaneous or sequential involvement of individual noncontiguous nerve trunks, either partially or completely, evolving over days to years and typically presenting with acute or subacute loss of sensory and motor function of individual nerves. The pattern of involvement is asymmetric. However, as the disease progresses, deficit(s) becomes more confluent and symmetrical, making it difficult to differentiate from polyneuropathy. Therefore, attention to the pattern of early symptoms is important.

Mononeuritis multiplex is sometimes associated with a deep, aching pain that worsens at night and frequently in the lower back, hip, or leg. In people with diabetes mellitus, mononeuritis multiplex typically is encountered as acute, unilateral, and severe thigh pain followed by anterior muscle weakness and loss of knee reflex.

Electrodiagnostic medicine studies will show multifocal sensory motor axonal neuropathy.

It is caused by, or associated with, several medical conditions:
===Autonomic neuropathy===
Autonomic neuropathy is a form of polyneuropathy that affects the non-voluntary, non-sensory nervous system (i.e., the autonomic nervous system), affecting mostly the internal organs such as the bladder muscles, the cardiovascular system, the digestive tract, and the genital organs. These nerves are not under a person&#x27;s conscious control and function automatically. Autonomic nerve fibers form large collections in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis outside the spinal cord. They have connections with the spinal cord and ultimately the brain, however. Most commonly autonomic neuropathy is seen in persons with long-standing diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2. In most—but not all—cases, autonomic neuropathy occurs alongside other forms of neuropathy, such as sensory neuropathy.

Autonomic neuropathy is one cause of malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, but not the only one; some conditions affecting the brain or spinal cord also may cause autonomic dysfunction, such as multiple system atrophy, and therefore, may cause similar symptoms to autonomic neuropathy.

The signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy include the following:
* Urinary bladder conditions: bladder incontinence or urine retention
* Gastrointestinal tract: dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, malabsorption, fecal incontinence, gastroparesis, diarrhoea, constipation
* Cardiovascular system: disturbances of heart rate (tachycardia, bradycardia), orthostatic hypotension, inadequate increase of heart rate on exertion
* Respiratory system: impairments in the signals associated with regulation of breathing and gas exchange (central sleep apnea, hypopnea, bradypnea).
* Skin: thermal regulation, dryness through sweat disturbances
* Other areas: hypoglycemia unawareness, genital impotence

===Neuritis===
Neuritis is a general term for inflammation of a nerve or the general inflammation of the peripheral nervous system. Symptoms depend on the nerves involved, but may include pain, paresthesia (pins-and-needles), paresis (weakness), hypoesthesia (numbness), anesthesia, paralysis, wasting, and disappearance of the reflexes.

Causes of neuritis include:
== Signs and symptoms ==
Those with diseases or dysfunctions of their nerves may have problems with normal nerve functions. Symptoms vary depending on the types of nerve fiber involved. In terms of sensory function, symptoms commonly include loss of function (&quot;negative&quot;) symptoms, including , tremor, impairment of balance, and gait abnormality. Gain of function (positive) symptoms include tingling, pain, itching, crawling, and pins-and-needles. Motor symptoms include loss of function (&quot;negative&quot;) symptoms of weakness, tiredness, muscle atrophy, and gait abnormalities; and gain of function (&quot;positive&quot;) symptoms of cramps, and muscle twitch (fasciculations).

In the most common form, length-dependent peripheral neuropathy, pain, and parasthesia appear symmetrically and generally at the terminals of the longest nerve in the lower legs and feet. Sensory symptoms usually develop before motor symptoms such as weakness. Length-dependent peripheral neuropathy symptoms make a slow ascent of the lower limbs, while symptoms may never appear in the upper limbs; if they do, it will be around the time that leg symptoms reach the knee. When the nerves of the autonomic nervous system are affected, symptoms may include constipation, dry mouth, difficulty urinating, and dizziness when standing.

===CAP-PRI scale for diagnosis===
A user-friendly, disease-specific, quality-of-life scale can be used to monitor how someone feels with the burden of chronic, sensorimotor polyneuropathy. This scale, called the Chronic, Acquired Polyneuropathy - Patient-reported Index (CAP-PRI), contains only 15 items and is completed by the person affected by polyneuropathy. The total score and individual item scores can be followed over time, with item scoring used by the patient and care provider to estimate the clinical status of some of the more common life domains and symptoms impacted by polyneuropathy.

==Causes==
The causes are grouped broadly as follows:
==Diagnosis==
Peripheral neuropathy may first be considered when an individual reports symptoms of numbness, tingling, and pain in feet. After ruling out a lesion in the central nervous system as a cause, a diagnosis may be made on the basis of symptoms, laboratory and additional testing, clinical history, and a detailed examination.

During physical examination, specifically a neurological examination, those with generalized peripheral neuropathies most commonly have distal sensory or motor and sensory loss, although those with a pathology (problem) of the nerves may be perfectly normal; may show proximal weakness, as in some inflammatory neuropathies, such as Guillain–Barré syndrome; or may show focal sensory disturbance or weakness, such as in mononeuropathies. Classically, ankle jerk reflex is absent in peripheral neuropathy.

A physical examination will involve testing the deep ankle reflex as well as examining the feet for any ulceration. For large fiber neuropathy, an exam will usually show an abnormally decreased sensation to vibration, which is tested with a 128-Hz tuning fork, and diminished sensation of light touch when touched by a nylon monofilament.

Diagnostic tests include electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCSs), which assess large myelinated nerve fibers. Testing for small-fiber peripheral neuropathies often relates to the autonomic nervous system function of small thinly- and unmyelinated fibers. These tests include a sweat test and a tilt table test. Diagnosis of small fiber involvement in peripheral neuropathy may also involve a skin biopsy in which a 3 mm-thick section of skin is removed from the calf by a punch biopsy, and is used to measure the skin intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD), the density of nerves in the outer layer of the skin. Reduced density of the small nerves in the epidermis supports a diagnosis of small-fiber peripheral neuropathy.

In EMG testing, demyelinating neuropathy characteristically shows a reduction in conduction velocity and prolongation of distal and F-wave latencies, whereas axonal neuropathy shows a reduction in amplitude.

Laboratory tests include blood tests for vitamin B12 levels, a complete blood count, measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone levels, a comprehensive metabolic panel screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes, and a serum immunofixation test, which tests for antibodies in the blood.

==Treatment==
The treatment of peripheral neuropathy varies based on its cause, and treating the underlying condition can help neuropathy treatment. When peripheral neuropathy results from diabetes mellitus or prediabetes, blood sugar management is key to treatment. In prediabetes, strict blood sugar control can significantly alter the course of neuropathy. In peripheral neuropathy that stems from immune-mediated diseases, the underlying condition is treated with intravenous immunoglobulin or steroids. When peripheral neuropathy results from vitamin deficiencies or other disorders, those are treated as well.

===Medications===
A range of medications that act on the central nervous system have been used to treat neuropathic pain. Commonly used medications include tricyclic antidepressants (such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline. imapramine, and desipramine,) serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medications (duloxetine, venlafaxine, and milnacipran) and antiepileptic medications (gabapentin, pregabalin, oxcarbazepine zonisamide levetiracetam, lamotrigine, topiramate, clonazepam, phenytoin, lacosamide, sodium valproate and carbamazepine). Opioid and opiate medications (such as buprenorphine, morphine, methadone, fentanyl, hydromorphone, tramadol and oxycodone) are also often used to treat neuropathic pain.

As is revealed in many of the Cochrane systematic reviews listed below, studies of these medications for the treatment of neuropathic pain are often methodologically flawed and the evidence is potentially subject to major bias. In general, the evidence does not support the usage of antiepileptic and antidepressant medications for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Better-designed clinical trials and further review from non-biased third parties are necessary to gauge just how useful for patients these medications truly are. Reviews of these systematic reviews are also necessary to assess their failings.

It is also often the case that the aforementioned medications are prescribed for neuropathic pain conditions for which they had not been explicitly tested for which controlled research is severely lacking; or even for which evidence suggests that these medications are not effective. The NHS for example explicitly states that amitriptyline and gabapentin can be used for treating the pain of sciatica. This is despite both the lack of high-quality evidence that demonstrates the efficacy of these medications for that symptom, and also the prominence of generally moderate to high-quality evidence that reveals that antiepileptics in specific, including gabapentin, demonstrate no efficacy in treating it.

==== Antidepressants ====
In general, according to Cochrane&#x27;s systematic reviews, antidepressants have shown to either be ineffective for the treatment of neuropathic pain or the evidence available is inconclusive. Evidence also tends to be tainted by bias or issues with the methodology.

Cochrane systematically reviewed the evidence for the antidepressants nortriptyline, desipramine, venlafaxine, and milnacipran and in all these cases found scant evidence to support their use for the treatment of neuropathic pain. All reviews were done between 2014 and 2015.

A 2015 Cochrane systematic review of amitriptyline found no evidence supporting amitriptyline that did not possess inherent bias. The authors believe amitriptyline may have an effect in some patients but that the effect is overestimated. A 2014 Cochrane systematic review of imipramine notes that the evidence suggesting benefit were &quot;methodologically flawed and potentially subject to major bias.&quot;

A 2017 Cochrane systematic review assessed the benefit of antidepressant medications for several types of chronic non-cancer pains (including neuropathic pain) in children and adolescents and the authors found the evidence inconclusive.

==== Antiepileptics ====
A 2017 Cochrane systematic review found that daily dosages between 1800–3600 mg of gabapentin could provide good pain relief for pain associated with diabetic neuropathy only. This relief occurred for roughly 30–40% of treated patients, while placebo had a 10–20% response. Three of the seven authors of the review had conflicts of interest declared. In a 2019 Cochrane review of pregabalin the authors conclude that there is some evidence of efficacy in the treatment of pain deriving from post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, and post-traumatic neuropathic pain only. They also warned that many patients treated will have no benefit. Two of the five authors declared receiving payments from pharmaceutical companies.

A 2017 Cochrane systematic review found that oxcarbazepine had little evidence to support its use for treating diabetic neuropathy, radicular pain, and other neuropathies. The authors also call for better studies. In a 2015 Cochrane systematic review the authors found a lack of evidence showing any effectiveness of zonisamide for treating pain deriving from any peripheral neuropathy. A 2014 Cochrane review found that studies of levetiracetam showed no indication of its effectiveness at treating pain from any neuropathy. The authors also found that the evidence was possibly biased and that some patients experienced adverse events.

A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that there was high-quality evidence to suggest that lamotrigine is not effective for treating neuropathic pain, even at high dosages 200–400 mg. A 2013 Cochrane systematic review of topiramate found that the included data had a strong likelihood of major bias; despite this, it found no effectiveness for the drug in treating the pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. It had not been tested for any other type of neuropathy. Cochrane reviews from 2012 of clonazepam and phenytoin uncovered no evidence of sufficient quality to support their use in chronic neuropathic pain.&quot;

A 2012 Cochrane systematic review of lacosamide found it very likely that the drug is ineffective for treating neuropathic pain. The authors caution against positive interpretations of the evidence. For sodium valproate the authors of a 2011 Cochrane review found that &quot;three studies no more than hint that sodium valproate may reduce pain in diabetic neuropathy&quot;. They discuss how there is a probable overestimate of the effect due to the inherent problems with the data and conclude that the evidence does not support its usage. In a 2014 systematic review of carbamazepine the authors believe the drug benefits some people. No trials were considered greater than level III evidence; none lasted longer than 4 weeks and had poor reporting quality.

A 2017 Cochrane systematic review aiming to assess the benefit of antiepileptic medications for several types of chronic non-cancer pains (including neuropathic pain) in children and adolescents found the evidence inconclusive. Two of the ten authors of this study declared receiving payments from pharmaceutical companies.

==== Opioids ====
A Cochrane review of buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, and morphine, all dated between 2015 and 2017, and all for the treatment of neuropathic pain, found that there was insufficient evidence to comment on their efficacy. Conflicts of interest were declared by the authors in this review. A 2017 Cochrane review of methadone found very low-quality evidence, three studies of limited quality, of its efficacy and safety. They could not formulate any conclusions about its relative efficacy and safety compared to a placebo.

For tramadol, Cochrane found that there was only modest information about the benefits of its usage for neuropathic pain. Studies were small, had potential risks of bias and apparent benefits increased with risk of bias. Overall the evidence was of low or very low quality and the authors state that it &quot;does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect&quot;. For oxycodone the authors found very low-quality evidence showing its usefulness in treating diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia only. One of the four authors declared receiving payments from pharmaceutical companies.

More generally, a large-scale 2013 review found opioids to be more effective for intermediate-term use than short-term use, but couldn&#x27;t properly assess effectiveness for chronic use because of insufficient data. Most recent guidelines on the pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain however are in agreement with the results of this review and recommend the use of opioids. A 2017 Cochrane review examining mainly propoxyphene therapy as a treatment for many non-cancer pain syndromes (including neuropathic pain) concluded, &quot;There was no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of opioids to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents.&quot;

==== Others ====
A 2016 Cochrane review of paracetamol for the treatment of neuropathic pain concluded that its benefit alone or in combination with codeine or dihydrocodeine is unknown.

Few studies have examined whether nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective in treating peripheral neuropathy.

There is some evidence that symptomatic relief from the pain of peripheral neuropathy may be obtained by the application of topical capsaicin. Capsaicin is the factor that causes heat in chili peppers. However, the evidence suggesting that capsaicin applied to the skin reduces pain for peripheral neuropathy is of moderate to low quality and should be interpreted carefully before this treatment is used.

Evidence supports the use of cannabinoids for some forms of neuropathic pain. A 2018 Cochrane review of cannabis-based medicines for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain included 16 studies. All of these studies included THC as a pharmacological component of the test group. The authors rated the quality of evidence as very low to moderate. The primary outcome was quoted as, &quot;Cannabis-based medicines may increase the number of people achieving 50% or greater pain relief compared with placebo&quot; but &quot;the evidence for improvement in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) with cannabis to be of very low quality&quot;. The authors also conclude, &quot;The potential benefits of cannabis-based medicine... might be outweighed by their potential harms.&quot;

A 2014 Cochrane review of topical lidocaine for the treatment of various peripheral neuropathies found its usage supported by a few low-quality studies. The authors state that no high-quality randomised control trials demonstrate its efficacy or safety profile.

A 2015 (updated in 2022) Cochrane review of topical clonidine for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy included two studies of 8 and 12 weeks in length; both of which compared topical clonidine to placebo and both of which were funded by the same drug manufacturer. The review found that topical clonidine may provide some benefit versus placebo. However, the authors state that the included trials are potentially subject to significant bias and that the evidence is of low to moderate quality.

A 2007 Cochrane review of aldose reductase inhibitors for the treatment of pain deriving from diabetic polyneuropathy found it no better than a placebo.

===Medical devices===
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy is often used to treat various types of neuropathy. A 2010 review of three trials, for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy explicitly, involving a total of 78 patients found some improvement in pain scores after 4 and 6 but not 12 weeks of treatment and an overall improvement in neuropathic symptoms at 12 weeks. Another 2010 review of four trials, for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, found significant improvement in pain and overall symptoms, with 38% of patients in one trial becoming asymptomatic. The treatment remains effective even after prolonged use, but symptoms return to baseline within a month of cessation of treatment.

These older reviews can be balanced with a more recent 2017 review of TENS for neuropathic pain by Cochrane which concluded that &quot;This review is unable to state the effect of TENS versus sham TENS for pain relief due to the very low quality of the included evidence... The very low quality of evidence means we have very limited confidence in the effect estimate reported.&quot; A very low quality of evidence means, &#x27;multiple sources of potential bias&#x27; with a &#x27;small number and size of studies&#x27;.

===Surgery===

Peripheral neuropathy due to nerve compression is treatable with a nerve decompression. When a nerve is subject to localized pressure or stretching, the vascular supply is interrupted leading to a cascade of physiological changes that causes nerve injury. In a nerve decompression, a surgeon explores the entrapment site and removes tissue around the nerve to relieve pressure. Common sites of entrapment are spaces of anatomic narrowing such as osteofibrous tunnels (e.g. carpal tunnel in carpal tunnel syndrome). In many cases the potential for nerve recovery (full or partial) after decompression is excellent, as chronic nerve compression is associated with low-grade nerve injury (Sunderland classification I-III) rather than high-grade nerve injury (Sunderland classification IV-V). Nerve decompressions for properly selected patients are associated with a significant reduction in pain, in some cases the complete elimination of pain.

In people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, two reviews make a case for nerve decompression surgery as an effective means of pain relief and support claims for protection from foot ulceration. There is less evidence for efficacy of surgery for non-diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the legs and feet. One uncontrolled study that did before/after comparisons with a minimum of one-year follow-up reported improvements in pain relief, impaired balance, and numbness. &quot;There was no difference in outcomes between patients with diabetic versus idiopathic neuropathy in response to nerve decompression.&quot; There are no placebo-controlled trials for idiopathic peripheral neuropathy in the published scientific literature.

===Diet===
According to a review, strict gluten-free diet is an effective treatment when neuropathy is caused by gluten sensitivity, with or without the presence of digestive symptoms or intestinal injury.

=== Counselling ===
A 2015 review on the treatment of neuropathic pain with psychological therapy concluded that &quot;There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy and safety of psychological interventions for chronic neuropathic pain. The two available studies show no benefit of treatment over either waiting list or placebo control groups.&quot;

=== Alternative medicine ===
A 2019 Cochrane review of the treatment of herbal medicinal products for people with neuropathic pain for at least three months concluded that &quot;There was insufficient evidence to determine whether nutmeg or St John&#x27;s wort has any meaningful efficacy in neuropathic pain conditions. The quality of the current evidence raises serious uncertainties about the estimates of effect observed, therefore, we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.&quot;

A 2017 Cochrane review on the usage of acupuncture as a treatment for neuropathic pain concludes, &quot;Due to the limited data available, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of acupuncture for neuropathic pain in general, or for any specific neuropathic pain condition when compared with sham acupuncture or other active therapies.&quot; Also, &quot;Most studies included a small sample size (fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm) and all studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel.&quot; Also, the authors state, &quot;we did not identify any study comparing acupuncture with treatment as usual.&quot;

Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) with benfotiamine is a proposed pathogenic treatment for painful diabetic neuropathy only. The results of two systematic reviews state that oral ALA produced no clinically significant benefit, intravenous ALA administered over three weeks may improve symptoms and that long-term treatment has not been investigated.

==Research==
A 2008 literature review concluded that &quot;based on principles of evidence-based medicine and evaluations of methodology, there is only a &#x27;possible&#x27; association of celiac disease and peripheral neuropathy due to lower levels of evidence and conflicting evidence. There is not yet convincing evidence of causality.&quot;

A 2019 review concluded that &quot;gluten neuropathy is a slowly progressive condition. About 25% of the patients will have evidence of enteropathy on biopsy (CD [celiac disease]) but the presence or absence of an enteropathy does not influence the positive effect of a strict gluten-free diet.&quot;

Stem-cell therapy is also being examined as a possible means to repair peripheral nerve damage but efficacy has not yet been demonstrated.

<text>Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake is the third studio album, and only concept album by the English rock band Small Faces. Released on 24 May 1968, the LP peaked at number one on the UK Album Charts on 29 June, where it remained for six weeks. It became the group&#x27;s final studio album during their original incarnation (and the last album to contain solely new material until the release of reunion album &quot;Playmates&quot; in 1977). The album title and distinctive packaging design was a parody of Ogden&#x27;s Nut-brown Flake, a brand of tinned tobacco that was produced in Liverpool from 1899 by Thomas Ogden.

==Background==
Side one of the album showcases a variety of musical styles. The opening title track is an instrumental re-working of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Mine&quot;, a failed single from 1965. This recording uses a Hammond Organ treated with wah-wah pedal and orchestral flourishes from a string section led by David McCallum Senior (the father of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. star David McCallum.). An eclectic selection of tracks follow; the proto-Hard rock of &quot;Song of a Baker&quot;; the psychedelic ballad &quot;Long Agos And Worlds Apart&quot;; cockney knees-up songs &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot; and &quot;Rene&quot; (the latter featuring a lengthy psychedelic jam as its coda); and the intense, soul-influenced ballad &quot;Afterglow&quot; (titled &quot;Afterglow of Your Love&quot; on the subsequent single and some compilations). The single version of &quot;Afterglow&quot; - released in March 1969 a year after it was recorded and immediately after the group&#x27;s disbandment was officially announced - was presented in a radically-different mix that eschewed the LP version&#x27;s acoustic opening, altered the song&#x27;s tempo and extended the instrumental coda.

Side two of the LP is based on an original fairy tale concept about a boy called Happiness Stan, consisting of a musical suite of six songs interlinked with narration provided by comic monologuist and performer Stanley Unwin in his unique, nonsensical private language of &quot;Unwinese&quot;. Unwin was not the band&#x27;s first choice for narrator, however – originally they approached the popular but mercurial absurdist comedian Spike Milligan to narrate the piece, but negotiations with Milligan floundered early and the more affable and amenable Unwin stepped in to everyone&#x27;s eventual satisfaction. Unwin spent time observing the band at work and at play in the studio, and picking up on the private, coded language they used amongst themselves, he incorporated it alongside contemporary slang into his inventive and surreal narrative.

The fairy tale follows Happiness Stan in his quest to find the &#x27;missing&#x27; half of the moon, after seeing the moon at half-phase in the sky one night and misinterpreting the physics involved. Along the way, he saves a fly from starvation, and in gratitude the insect tells him of a wise man who can answer his question and also tell him the philosophy of life itself. Conveniently possessed of magic powers, Stan intones, &quot;If all the flies were one fly, what a great enormous fly-follolloper that would bold!&quot; and the fly duly grows to gigantic proportions. Seated on the giant fly&#x27;s back, Stan undertakes a psychedelic journey to the cave of Mad John the Hermit, who explains that the moon&#x27;s disappearance is only temporary, and demonstrates by pointing out that Stan has spent so long on his quest that the moon is now full again. He then sings Stan a cheerful song about the meaning of life.

The concept for side two of the album was conceived during a boating trip on the river Thames that the band undertook to relax and recuperate after a disastrous January 1968 tour of Australia and New Zealand, when bassist/vocalist Ronnie Lane noted in a moment of relaxed contemplation that the half-phase moon in the sky appeared to have had half of its surface removed. Lane and vocalist/guitarist Steve Marriott then conceived the idea of an uncomplicated and unworldly character called Happiness Stan embarking upon a naive but heroic quest to recover this supposed &#x27;missing&#x27; half of the moon, but discovering the secret of happiness and &#x27;the meaning of life itself&#x27; instead. The character of &#x27;Happiness Stan&#x27; was reportedly named after Lane&#x27;s older brother Stanley, rather than after Stanley Unwin. &#x27;Happiness&#x27;, meanwhile, was a promotional keyword of the Immediate record label, with their &#x27;Happy to be part of the industry of human happiness&#x27; slogan.

==Recording==
The recording of &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot; spanned approximately five months, with most of the work done in spring 1968 at Olympic Studios in Barnes, London. The earliest recording that may have been aimed toward inclusion on the album was a track entitled &quot;Call It Something Nice&quot;, recorded on 21 October 1967 at Olympic. The song itself was an uncharacteristically slow and heavy number with a doleful, contemplative lyric that presaged the group&#x27;s eventual move toward the harder, more rock-oriented sound of later songs like &quot;Wham Bam Thank You Ma&#x27;am&quot; and Steve Marriott&#x27;s work with his next group, Humble Pie. The track did not ultimately appear on the album, however, eventually only seeing release on the posthumous compilation &quot;The Autumn Stone&quot; more than two years later in November 1969.

Recording continued through the remainder of 1967, with a session in November that yielded the outwardly more whimsical &quot;I Feel Much Better&quot; (which saw prompt release in December as the b-side of the band&#x27;s &quot;Tin Soldier&quot; UK single), and another session in December backing Immediate labelmate P.P. Arnold on her solo single, the Marriott/Lane song &quot;(If You Think You&#x27;re) Groovy&quot;. Other versions of the track were cut, including the Small Faces&#x27; own take with Steve Marriott on solo lead vocal which was earmarked for their forthcoming album, but this version was ultimately left unreleased and is now considered to be lost.

After the group returned from their ill-fated tour of Oceania with the Who in January 1968, recording sessions for the album began in earnest through February and March at Olympic, with Glyn Johns at the recording desk. Recording began on two tracks intended for a future single, but ultimately not released in this format: another Marriott/Lane original, &quot;Rollin&#x27; Over&quot; (initially titled &quot;Bun in the Oven&quot;) was the projected A-side, with a cover version of &quot;Every Little Bit Hurts&quot;, as the B-side. Written by Ed Cobb and made famous by Brenda Holloway, the latter track - a slow, soulful ballad - features Marriott on piano instead of his usual guitar, and Ian McLagan on Hammond organ. This track was not released at the time and did not officially appear until the early 1990s, although a longer live version would appear on &quot;The Autumn Stone&quot; in 1969. &quot;Rollin&#x27; Over&quot; - another heavy rock workout - would be worked on further however, with Marriott tracking two attempts at a new lead vocal - one take appearing on the mono single release and the other on the stereo album release. Marriott also duets with himself on the verses, singing both harmonies. The mono version of &quot;Rollin&#x27; Over&quot; would later be released as the b-side of the &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot; single in the UK, while the stereo version found itself incorporated into the musical suite on side two of the LP.

At some point during the sessions the group also cut a cover version of the Ronettes&#x27; &quot;Be My Baby&quot; - a track which, in contemporary interviews in the UK music press preceding the LP&#x27;s release, was declared by Marriott to be included on side one. Although an early version of the LP that included this track was alleged to exist in acetate form, by the time of the LP&#x27;s release in May the track had been excised and remained unreleased. Like the band&#x27;s own version of &quot;If You Think You&#x27;re Groovy&quot;, it is now thought to be lost. One of the few songs not recorded at Olympic Studios for the LP was the track &quot;The Journey&quot;, recorded at Trident Studios in London in February (with Ronnie Lane and Steve Marriott switching their usual instruments to play guitar and bass, respectively). Album sessions wrapped on 3 April (two days before the release of the &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot; / &quot;Rollin&#x27; Over&quot; single) at Olympic with the recording of &quot;Mad John&quot;, and the out-take &quot;A Collibosher&quot; (which was again later released on the posthumous compilation &quot;The Autumn Stone&quot;). As was usual for Immediate label recordings at this time, other artists on the label&#x27;s roster such as P.P. Arnold, Billy Nicholls, flautist Lyn Dobson and numerous other session players made uncredited vocal and musical contributions to the album.

Mixing of the album was completed by Marriott and Lane through April and May at Trident Studios, with the LP arriving in record shops on 24 May 1968. The 5 April release of &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot; as the album&#x27;s lead single, meanwhile, had come as a surprise to the band who had not been consulted over the choice, and Marriott in particular was displeased by it at a time when he wanted the group to be taken more seriously as musicians. He later claimed that had he been consulted, he would have chosen &quot;Afterglow&quot; to continue in the less frivolous vein of their previous hit &quot;Tin Soldier&quot;. Despite Marriott&#x27;s displeasure, the band and P.P. Arnold appeared in session on BBC Radio One&#x27;s Top Gear show in April to dutifully promote their new single and the forthcoming album. They performed a version of Lazy Sunday alongside three otherwise unreleased cover versions: a new performance of &quot;Every Little Bit Hurts&quot;, an instrumental cover version of the Temptations&#x27; &quot;Get Ready&quot;, and an intense, rock-oriented cover of Tim Hardin&#x27;s &quot;If I Were A Carpenter&quot; (with the exception of &quot;Get Ready&quot; the session was later officially released on a Small Faces BBC Sessions collection in the year 2000). In late May after the album&#x27;s release, the Small Faces recorded another similarly intense (but more downbeat) cover of Hardin&#x27;s &quot;Red Balloon&quot; at Olympic, which later saw release on &quot;The Autumn Stone&quot; LP.

The new album&#x27;s musical and technical complexities, coupled with Small Faces live shows being still mostly confined to shorter sets as part of shared bills with other artists, meant that &quot;Ogden&#x27;s Nut Gone Flake&quot; was never performed live on stage in its entirety – only &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot;, &quot;Rollin&#x27; Over&quot; and &quot;Song Of a Baker&quot; appeared as part of their live sets. The Happiness Stan suite was performed as a whole only once, on the BBC television programme &quot;Colour Me Pop&quot; on Friday 21 June 1968, and even then it was not performed totally live. Songs featured were &quot;Song of a Baker&quot;, &quot;Happiness Stan&quot;, &quot;Rollin&#x27; Over&quot;, &quot;The Hungry Intruder&quot;, &quot;The Journey&quot;, &quot;Mad John&quot; and &quot;Happydaystoytown&quot;. Although the band mimed playing their instruments to the original studio recordings, their microphones were left on to capture their live vocals and ad-libs.

==Design and packaging==
The album was originally released on vinyl in a circular novelty package of a metal replica of a giant tobacco tin, inside which was a poster created with five connected paper circles with pictures of the band members. This proved too expensive and not successful as the tins tended to roll off of shelves and it was quickly followed by a paper/card replica with a gatefold cover. Two limited-edition CD releases (including a three-disc deluxe edition in 2006 that included the original mono mix of the album on CD for the first time) went even further by packaging the disc(s) in a circular tin (as the original vinyl release had). Most CD releases use conventional packaging, superimposing the circular artwork on a square booklet.

The award-winning artwork for the album was produced by Nick Tweddell and Pete Brown, who were art school friends of Ian Mclagan and who had also played in a band with Mclagan called the Muleskinners. Album cover illustration was by Harry Willock, 1969 D&amp;AD Silver Award winning album cover. Early pressings of XTC&#x27;s &quot;The Big Express&quot; (1984) were similarly packaged in a round sleeve in tribute to the Small Faces album. It was ranked number 21 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Album Covers&quot; in 1991.

== Controversy ==
To promote the album, Immediate Records issued an advertisement that parodied the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. This caused an uproar in the British press, and outraged readers wrote in to voice their anger. It read:

Regarding the advert, Steve Marriott said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t know a thing about the ad until we saw it in the music papers. And frankly we got the horrors at first. We realize that it could be taken as a serious knock against religion. But on thinking it over, we don&#x27;t feel it is particularly good or bad. It&#x27;s just another form of advertising. We&#x27;re not all that concerned about it. We&#x27;re more concerned in writing our music and producing our records.&quot;

==Vinyl and CD versions==
The original vinyl album includes a segue between the end of &quot;Afterglow&quot; and the beginning of &quot;Long Agos And Worlds Apart&quot;. Most CD editions have a different stereo mix, and use a version of &quot;Afterglow&quot; without the segue. There is also a segue between &quot;Long Agos and Worlds Apart&quot; and &quot;Rene&quot;, and this is retained on the CD. Some CD editions also include one or more bonus tracks.

The US Immediate vinyl LP looked the same as the British original, but was printed on flimsy paper stock. The CBS/Immediate issue was always sold in a plastic bag with a foldover snap. The sound on the US release was not as bright as the UK release or most subsequent CD issues.

In 1989, Castle Communications released a single disc commemorative &quot;tobacco tin&quot; version that included a &#x27;live&#x27; version of Tin Soldier as well as several table coasters replicating the cover.

The 2006 Castle Music/Sanctuary Records 3-disc &quot;tobacco tin&quot; Special Edition includes fully remastered mono and stereo mixes complete with segue, plus an episode of the BBC Radio documentary series &quot;Classic Albums&quot; in which the band discuss the making of the album. A second 3-disc Deluxe Edition was released in 2012 on Charly Records, this time, overseen by surviving band members Ian McLagan and Kenney Jones, and featured newly remastered mono and stereo mixes complete with segue, with the third disc full of outtakes and alternative takes, versions and mixes, including some specially mixed from newly discovered original session tapes. In countries other than the UK, however, the 2012 3-disc version was a limited edition and was replaced a year later by a two CD version with conventional packaging, and the stereo mix is omitted completely from the package.

In 2018 the album was reissued in a deluxe 50th anniversary edition that included the full 2012 3-disc version and a DVD that included the Colour Me Pop performance.

On many reissues, the cover design still spells the title as &quot;Ogdens&#x27; &quot;, but the label and sleeve copy gives it as &quot;Ogden&#x27;s&quot;.

The vinyl LP was reissued in 2015 for Record Store Day.

==Reception==
In 2000 &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot; at number 59 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. The album was featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a positive review.

It was voted number 337 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

==In other media==
The title track was played during the debut trailer for the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; and was later featured on the in-game Los Santos Rock Radio station.

==Track listing==

<text>Skynet Airlines was an airline operating from Ireland to Russia via Amsterdam, that was operational between 2001 and 2004.

==History==
Skynet began operations from Shannon Airport to Amsterdam, with onward connections to Moscow, Russia, using Boeing 737 aircraft. Skynet rented unused routes and airport slots from and operated code shared routes with Aeroflot.

In May 2004 the aircraft leasing company impounded Skynet&#x27;s two Boeing 737 aircraft at Shannon amid a rent dispute, and the airline was forced to cancel all flights indefinitely. In June 2004 the airline announced it was in talks with Pulkovo Aviation Enterprise of St. Petersburg, but as of October 2004 no flights had taken place. A further plan to resume flights in May 2005 between Shannon, St Petersburg, Moscow and New York has also failed to occur.

After the company became defunct, its website was acquired by the Russian airline of the same name.

<text>Musa Cälil (, ; ; – 25 August 1944) was a Soviet Tatar poet and resistance fighter during World War II. He is the only poet of the Soviet Union awarded simultaneously the Hero of the Soviet Union award for his resistance fighting and the Lenin Prize for having written &quot;The Moabit Notebooks&quot;; both awards were bestowed upon him posthumously.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Musa Cälil was born in Mustafino, a village in Orenburg Governorate, to a family of junk dealers. He graduated from in Orenburg. His first published works were revolutionary verses. The Turkic &quot;aruz wezni&quot; poetic rhythm is seen in Cälil&#x27;s early works, which is attributed to &quot;Gisyanism&quot; (; гыйсъянизм), a romantic poetic style celebrating revolution that was often found in young Tatar poetry of the 1920s. In 1919, he joined the underground Komsomol cell in Orenburg (the region was under the control of White Russians at that time). Then, Musa participated in the Russian Civil War against pro-White forces; due to his young age, he did not fight at the front, instead serving in a Red Army unit. In 1920, Cälil returned to his native village, establishing the pro-Communist youth organization The Red Flower there. He also became a Komsomol activist in Mustafino. He represented his village at the governorate Komsomol conference.

===Literary life===
In 1920, the Tatar ASSR was established and Kazan became its capital. In 1922, Musa, along with other Tatar poets, moved to Kazan. During this time, verses that he wrote include &quot;The Red Host&quot;, &quot;The Red Holyday&quot;, &quot;The Red Hero&quot;, &quot;The Red Way&quot;, &quot;The Red Force&quot;, and &quot;The Red Banner&quot;. In Kazan, Cälil worked as copyist for the &quot;Qьzьl Tatarstan&quot; newspaper and studied at rabfak of the Oriental Pedagogical Institute. He became acquainted with Tatar poets such as Qawi Näcmi, Hadi Taqtaş, and Ğädel Qutuy. In 1924, he became a member of the literary society October, backing Proletkult. Since that year, his poetry departed from Ghisyanism and aruz and turned to the Tatar folk verse. His first collection of verses, &quot;Barabız&quot; (&quot;We are going&quot;) was published in 1925. One concept that the verses dealt with was pre-revolutionary life.

During 1925 and 1926, Cälil became an instructor of Orsk uyezd Komsomol cell, where he visited Tatar and Kazakh auls, agitating for Komsomol there. In 1926, he became the member of Orenburg governorate Komsomol committee. In 1927, Musa moved to Moscow, where he combined his study in the Moscow State University and job in Tatar–Bashkir section of the Central Committee of Komsomol. Cälil joined the All-Union Communist Party (b) in 1929, which was the same year that his second collection, &quot;İptäşkä&quot; (&quot;To the Comrade&quot;; Yañalif: &quot;Iptəşkə&quot;) was published. Living in Moscow, Cälil met Russian poets Zharov, Bezymensky, and Svetlov; Cälil also attended Vladimir Mayakovsky&#x27;s performances. He entered the Moscow Association of Proletarian Writers; he became its third secretary and a leader of its Tatar section. By the end of the 1920s, lyricism appeared in Cälil&#x27;s poetry.

In 1931, Cälil graduated from the literature faculty of Moscow University. Until 1932, he was a chief editor of the Tatar children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Keckenə iptəşlər&quot;, which was later renamed to &quot;Oktəbr Balasь&quot; (&quot;Little Octobrist&quot;). Then, he managed the section of literature and art in the central Tatar newspaper &quot;Kommunist&quot;. In 1934, Musa Cälil published two collections. The first of them, &quot;The Millions, Decorated with Orders&quot; was devoted mostly to youth and Komsomol, whereas in the second, &quot;Verses and Poems&quot;, was a general compilation of his writing. However, many of his lyrical poems weren&#x27;t published due to being at conflict with Stalinism.

In 1935, the first Russian translations of his poems were published. During the 1930s, Cälil also translated to the Tatar language writings of poets of the USSR peoples, such as Shota Rustaveli, Taras Shevchenko, Pushkin, Nekrasov, Mayakovsky and Lebedev-Kumach. In the late 1930s, he tended to write epic poems, such as &quot;The Director and the Sun&quot; (1935), &quot;Cihan&quot; (1935–1938), and &quot;The Postman&quot; (1938). As a playwright of the Tatar State Opera, he wrote four librettos for Tatar operas, one of which is &quot;Altınçäç&quot; (&quot;Golden Hair Maiden&quot;) of Näcip Cihanov. In 1939 and 1940, he served as the chairman of the Tatar ASSR Union of Writers.

===During World War II===

After the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Cälil volunteered for the Red Army. Graduating political commissar courses, he arrived at the Volkhov Front and became a war correspondent in the &quot;Otvaga&quot; newspaper. Cälil also wrote verse, which was at first patriotic but later evolving into lyricism concerning war and people experiencing war.

In June 1942, during the Lyuban Offensive Operation, Cälil&#x27;s unit was encircled; when his unit tried to run a blockade he became seriously wounded, shell-shocked, and captured. After months in concentration camps for Soviet prisoners of war, including Stalag-340 in Daugavpils, Latvia and Spandau, Cälil was transferred to Dęblin, a fortified stronghold in German-occupied Poland. There, the Wehrmacht were assembling prisoners of Idel-Ural and Eastern nationalities in the camp. Cälil responded by forming a resistance group.

In late 1942, the Wehrmacht started forming what they called &quot;national legions&quot;. Among others, the Idel-Ural legion was formed in Lager Jedlnia, General Government, consisting of prisoners of war belonging to the nations of the Volga basin. Since the majority of the legion were Volga Tatars, the Germans usually called it the Volga-Tatar Legion. The Wehrmacht began preparing the legionnaires for action against the Red Army. Cälil joined the Wehrmacht propaganda unit for the legion under the false name of Gumeroff. Cälil&#x27;s group set out to wreck the National Socialist plans, to convince the men to use the weapons they would be supplied with against the National Socialists themselves. The members of the resistance group infiltrated the editorial board of the &quot;Idel-Ural&quot; newspaper the German command produced, and printed and circulated anti-Hitler leaflets among the legionnaires into esoteric action groups consisting of five men each. The first battalion of the Volga-Tatar Legion that was sent to the Eastern Front mutinied, shot all the German officers there, and defected to the Soviet partisans in Belarus.

====Capture and death====
On 10 August 1943, he was arrested with his comrades by the Gestapo and sent to Moabit Prison in Berlin. He sat in a cell with Belgian patriot and resistance fighter André Timmermans and a Polish prisoner. Cälil studied the German language in prison to communicate with his cellmates. In prison, he compiled verses composed in the prison into self-made notebooks. He and his group of 12 were sentenced to death on 12 February 1944 and guillotined at Plötzensee Prison, Berlin, on August 25. His body was never recovered.

===Prison notebooks===
Cälil&#x27;s first notebook was preserved by the Tatars Ğabbas Şäripov and then Niğmät Teregulov, both of whom later died in Stalin&#x27;s camps. Şäripov was also imprisoned in Moabit and received Cälil&#x27;s and Abdulla Aliş&#x27;s writings when the prison guards hid from bombing. To preserve the writings, Cälil&#x27;s group fenced him off. The second notebook was preserved by the Belgian cellmate André Timmermans. Those notebooks were passed to the Tatar ASSR Union of Writers in 1946 and 1947 correspondingly. They were published as two books under the title &quot;Moabit Däftäre&quot; (&quot;The Moabit Notebook&quot;). Cälil&#x27;s widow Äminä Zalyalova gave the originals to the National Museum of Tatarstan for safekeeping.

One notebook was brought to the Soviet embassy in Rome by the ethnically Tatar Turkish citizen Kazım Mirşan in 1946. However, this notebook was lost in the archives of SMERSH, and pursuits for it since 1979 have had no results.
These notebooks were in arabic script.

==Legacy==
In 1946, MGB opened a file on Musa Cälil branding him as a traitor. In April 1947, his name was included in the list of wanted &quot;dangerous criminals&quot;.

Then Tatar writers and the Tatarstan department of state security proved Cälil&#x27;s underground work against the Third Reich and his death. In 1953, &quot;The Moabit Notebooks&quot; were published in Kazan and the Russian translation also was published in &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot;, owing to its editor, Konstantin Simonov. Musa Cälil was awarded the star of the Hero of the Soviet Union in 1956 and Literature Lenin Prize in 1957 for &quot;The Moabit Notebooks&quot;.

A monument to Musa Cälil is placed near the Kazan Kremlin; the museum in his flat was opened in Kazan in 1983. His poetry was popularized in the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries.

Soviet Tatar composer Nazib Zhiganov wrote an &quot;opera-poem&quot; &quot;Dzhalil&quot; based on the life of Cälil. This was premiered in Tatar in Kazan in 1957, and later recorded by conductor Boris Khaykin for Moscow radio.

Musa Cälil Tatar Library was opened in Constanța, Romania, in 2014.

The Symphony-poem &quot;Musa Jalil&quot; written by Soviet Tatar composer Almaz Monasypov in 1971 was dedicated to the poet. A minor planet 3082 Dzhalil discovered by Soviet astronomer Tamara Mikhailovna Smirnova in 1972 is named after him.

On October 13, 2021, a monument to Cälil had its grand opening in the Sverdlovsk Oblast within Yekaterinburg.

<doc id="608330" wikidata="Q7119449" url="?curid=608330" title="PIT maneuver">
<text>The PIT maneuver (precision immobilization technique), also known as TVI (tactical vehicle intervention), is a law enforcement pursuit tactic in which a pursuing vehicle forces another vehicle to turn sideways abruptly, causing the driver to lose control and stop. It was developed by BSR Inc. and first used by the Fairfax County Police Department in Virginia, United States, in 1988.

==Procedure==
The PIT maneuver begins when the pursuing vehicle pulls alongside the fleeing vehicle so that the portion of the pursuer&#x27;s vehicle forward of the front wheels is aligned with the portion of the target vehicle behind the back wheels. The pursuer gently makes contact with the target&#x27;s side, then sharply steers into the target. The pursuer must also accelerate (or its bumper will slide off the target vehicle). Forces of motion tend to swing the fleeing vehicle around in a sweeping arc until its position is reversed, with its front bumper suddenly facing the rear. At high speeds, such sudden lateral movement can cause rollover collisions.

==History==
The PIT originated in West Virginia during the late 1980s with a goal of halting fleeing vehicles as &quot;tactical vehicle interception (T.V.I.)&quot;. The first U.S. law enforcement agency to teach PIT was the Fairfax County Police Department in Virginia, which modified the technique&#x27;s parameters for initiation and execution in police tactics.

==Controversy==
While some police departments in the United States consider the PIT maneuver as an intermediate force option that can end a pursuit, others, like the state of Illinois, consider &quot;forcible stop techniques&quot; to be &quot;use of deadly force&quot; if performed at high speeds (above 20 mph).

Police pursuit policies in general — and the PIT maneuver specifically — are controversial because of risk of injury or death to both involved and uninvolved. The PIT maneuver has been linked to at least 30 fatalities between 2016 and 2020. Of those fatalities, 18 occurred when officers attempted to stop motorists for minor traffic violations. Many police departments have placed regulations to limit the potential risks of the PIT maneuver and limit its use to serious situations, including pursuit of drivers with outstanding warrants or who are considered likely to be dangerous for other reasons.

In recent years, Arkansas State Police have at least twice performed controversial PIT maneuvers. In June 2020, a pregnant woman, who was at the time searching for a place to pull over, was the target of a PIT maneuver. As part of a legal settlement with the driver of the car, the Arkansas State Police agreed to improve training and restrict the use of the PIT maneuver and use it only in cases to “protect a third person or an officer from imminent death or serious physical injury.” Additionally, in September 2023, an Arkansas State Trooper resigned after performing a PIT maneuver on the wrong vehicle during a high-speed chase.

In April 2024 in Newberry, Florida, four teenagers died during a police pursuit initiated by the Bradford County Sheriff&#x27;s office. The teens, who were between 14 and 16 years old and attended Newberry High School, were killed after a Florida Highway Patrol trooper performed a PIT maneuver on the stolen SUV they were driving.

<text>Red Norvo (born Kenneth Norville; March 31, 1908 – April 6, 1999) was an American musician, one of jazz&#x27;s early vibraphonists, known as &quot;Mr. Swing&quot;. He helped establish the xylophone, marimba, and vibraphone as jazz instruments. His recordings included &quot;Dance of the Octopus&quot;, &quot;Bughouse&quot;, &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Wood&quot;, &quot;Congo Blues&quot;, and &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot;.

==Career==
Red Norvo was born in Beardstown, Illinois, United States. His career began in Chicago with a band called &quot;The Collegians&quot; in 1925. He played with many other bands, including an all-marimba band on the vaudeville circuit, and the bands of Paul Whiteman, Benny Goodman, Charlie Barnet, and Woody Herman. He recorded with Mildred Bailey (his wife from 1933 to 1942), Billie Holiday, Dinah Shore and Frank Sinatra. Norvo and his wife were known as &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Swing.&quot; He appeared as himself in the film &quot;Screaming Mimi&quot; (1958) and in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot;, accompanying Dean Martin while he sang &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Kick in the Head?&quot;

In 1933, he recorded two sessions for Brunswick under his own name. The first, &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Wood&quot; and &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot;, pleased Brunswick&#x27;s recording director Jack Kapp, and Norvo was booked for another session. This time, Kapp was out of town but Norvo went ahead and recorded two early pieces of chamber jazz: &quot;In a Mist&quot; by Bix Beiderbecke and Norvo&#x27;s own &quot;Dance of the Octopus&quot;. He played marimba instead of xylophone in the second session, accompanied by Benny Goodman in a rare performance on bass clarinet, Dick McDonough on guitar, and Artie Bernstein on double bass. Kapp was outraged when he heard the recordings and tore up Norvo&#x27;s contract. Nevertheless, this modern record remained in print through the 1930s.

Norvo recorded eight modern swing sides for Columbia in 1934–1935, and fifteen sides for Decca and their short-lived Champion label series in 1936. Starting in 1936 through 1942, Norvo formed a swing orchestra and recorded for ARC, first on their Brunswick label, then Vocalion and Columbia after CBS bought ARC. The recordings featured arrangements by Eddie Sauter, often with Mildred Bailey as vocalist. In 1938, Red Norvo and His Orchestra reached number one with their recordings of &quot;Please Be Kind&quot;, which was number one for two weeks, and &quot;Says My Heart&quot;, with lead vocals by Bailey, which was number one for four weeks on the pop charts, reaching number one during the week of June 18, 1938.

In June 1945, while a member of the Benny Goodman Sextet, he recorded a session for Comet Records employing members of Goodman&#x27;s group, as well as Charlie Parker, and Dizzy Gillespie. About the session Norvo said: &quot;Bird and Diz were dirty words for musicians of my generation. But jazz had always gone through changes and in 1945 we were in the middle of another one. Bird and Diz were saying new things in an exciting way. I had a free hand, so I gambled&quot;.

In 1949, while trying to find work near home on the West Coast and running into difficulties with large groups, Norvo formed a trio with the novel combination of vibes, guitar, and bass. When the original guitarist and bassist quit (Mundell Lowe and Red Kelly), he brought in two previously little-known players. Tal Farlow became one of the most significant of the new generation of guitarists, in part because the demands of the trio led him to explore changes in tempo and harmony. Charles Mingus&#x27;s career as a bass player developed via this group through his virtuoso musicianship, though its repertoire was unconnected to his later career. Mingus left in 1951 and Red Mitchell replaced him. Farlow left the group in 1953 and guitarist Jimmy Raney took his place. The Norvo, Farlow, and Mingus trio recorded two albums for Savoy Records.

In 1959, Norvo&#x27;s group played concerts in Australia with Frank Sinatra; Blue Note released these recordings in 1997. Norvo and his group also made several appearances on &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot; in the late 1950s and early &#x27;60s.

Norvo recorded and toured throughout his career until a stroke in the mid-1980s forced him into retirement (although he developed hearing problems long before his stroke). He died at a convalescent home in Santa Monica, California at the age of 91.

==Compositions==
Red Norvo&#x27;s instrumental compositions include &quot;Dance of the Octopus&quot;, &quot;Bughouse&quot; (with Irving Mills and Teddy Wilson), &quot;The Night is Blue&quot;, &quot;A Cigarette and a Silhouette&quot;, &quot;Congo Blues&quot;, &quot;Seein&#x27; Red&quot;, &quot;Blues in E Flat&quot;, &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot;, &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Wood&quot;, &quot;Decca Stomp&quot;, &quot;Tomboy&quot;, and &quot;1-2-3-4 Jump&quot;.

<text>The government of Serbia (), formally the Government of the Republic of Serbia (), commonly abbreviated to Serbian Government (), is the executive branch of government in Serbia.

The affairs of government are decided by the Cabinet of Ministers, which is led by the prime minister. The government is housed in the Government Building in Belgrade.

==Jurisdiction==
According to the Constitution of Serbia, the Government:

<text>Eörs Szathmáry (born 1959) is a Hungarian theoretical evolutionary biologist at the now-defunct Collegium Budapest Institute for Advanced Study and at the Department of Plant Taxonomy and Ecology of Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest. He is the co-author with John Maynard Smith of &quot;The Major Transitions in Evolution&quot;, a seminal work which continues to contribute to ongoing issues in evolutionary biology. He is a member of the Batthyány Society of Professors.

==Main interest==
His main interest is theoretical evolutionary biology and focuses on the common principles of the major steps in evolution, such as the origin of life, the emergence of cells, the origin of animal societies, and the appearance of human language. Together with his mentor, John Maynard Smith, he has published two important books which serve as the main references in the field (&quot;The Major Transitions in Evolution, Freeman, 1995, and The Origins of Life, Oxford University Press, 1999&quot;). Both books have been translated into other languages (so far, German, French, Japanese, and Hungarian). He serves on the editorial board of several journals (Journal of Theoretical Biology, Journal of Evolutionary Biology, Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere, Evolutionary Ecology and Evolution of Communication).

==Awards==
Professor Szathmáry was awarded the New Europe Prize in 1996 by a group of institutes for advanced study. He used the prize to establish the NEST (New Europe School for Theoretical Biology) foundation, whose task is to help young Hungarian theoretical biologists. The Juhász-Nagy junior fellowship that he endowed in 1996 at Collegium Budapest also serves this purpose. In 1996 he was the Executive Vice-President of ICSEB V (Fifth International Congress of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology) that took place in Budapest, partially sponsored by Collegium Budapest. He served as President of the International Organisation for Systematic and Evolutionary Biology (IOSEB, 1996–2002). The Hungarian Academy of Sciences acknowledged his outstanding scientific contribution with the Academy Prize in 1999. He was invited to prestigious institutions, including the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin and the Collège de France. He is a member of Academia Europaea and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

==Achievements==
Professor Szathmáry&#x27;s main achievements include:
* a mathematical description of some phases of early evolution;
* a scenario for the origin of the genetic code;
* an analysis of epistasis in terms of metabolic control theory;
* a demonstration of the selection consequences of parabolic growth;
* a derivation of the optimal size of the genetic alphabet;
* a general framework to discuss the major transitions in evolution.
* a discussion on the confusion between hypercycle and collectively autocatalytic system (link)

==Author==
Apart from the aforementioned co-authored books, he has also published numerous papers in important journals, including Nature, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, and Journal of Theoretical Biology.

<doc id="608388" wikidata="Q3003796" url="?curid=608388" title="Women's lacrosse">
<text>Women&#x27;s lacrosse (or girls&#x27; lacrosse), sometimes shortened to lax, is a field sport played at the international level with two opposing teams of ten players each (12 players per team at the U.S. domestic level). Originally played by indigenous peoples of the Americas, the modern women&#x27;s game was introduced in 1890 at the St Leonard&#x27;s School in St Andrews, Scotland. The rules of women&#x27;s lacrosse differ significantly from men&#x27;s field lacrosse. The two are often considered to be different sports with a common root.

The object of the game is to use a long-handled stick (known as a &quot;crosse&quot; or lacrosse stick) to catch, cradle, and pass a solid rubber lacrosse ball in an effort to score by hurling the ball into an opponent&#x27;s goal. Cradling is a technique of moving the wrists and arms in a semi-circular motion to keep the ball in the pocket of the stick&#x27;s head using centripetal force. The head of the lacrosse stick has a mesh or leather net strung into it that allows the player to hold the ball. Defensively, the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body positioning. The rules of women&#x27;s lacrosse are different from the men&#x27;s lacrosse game. Equipment required to play is also different from the men&#x27;s. In the United States, women are only required to wear eyewear or lacrosse goggles and a mouth guard. The stick has restrictions too, as it must be a certain length and the pocket must be shallow enough to show the ball above the side when held at eye level.

At the collegiate level in the United States, lacrosse is represented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which conducts three NCAA Women&#x27;s Lacrosse Championships, one for each of its competitive divisions, each spring. Internationally, women&#x27;s lacrosse has a thirty-one-member governing body called World Lacrosse, which sponsors the Women&#x27;s Lacrosse World Cup once every four years.

==History==

French Jesuit missionaries in the St. Lawrence Valley introduced the game of lacrosse, a traditional Native American game, to Europeans in the 1630s. The games were sometimes major events that could last several days. As many as 100 to 1,000 men from opposing villages or tribes would participate. Native American lacrosse describes a broad variety of stick-and-ball games played by them. Geography and tribal customs dictated the extent to which women participated in these early games:

&quot;Lacrosse, as women play it, is an orderly pastime that has little in common with the men&#x27;s tribal warfare version except the long-handled racket or crosse (stick) that gives the sport its name. It&#x27;s true that the object in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse is to send a ball through a goal by means of the racket, but whereas men resort to brute strength the women depend solely on skill.&quot; Rosabelle Sinclair
The first modern women&#x27;s lacrosse game was played in 1890 at the St Leonards School in Scotland, where women&#x27;s lacrosse had been introduced by Louisa Lumsden. Lumsden brought the game to Scotland after watching a men&#x27;s lacrosse game between the Canghuwaya (probably Caughnawaga) Indians and the Montreal Lacrosse Club. A British school teacher, Cara Gascoigne, at Sweet Briar College, started club lacrosse at that college in 1914. One of Lumsden&#x27;s students, Rosabelle Sinclair, established the first women&#x27;s lacrosse team in the United States at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, Maryland in 1926. The first women&#x27;s intercollegiate game was held between Sweet Briar College and The College of William and Mary in 1941.

Until the mid-1930s, women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s field lacrosse were played under virtually the same rules, with no protective equipment. In the United States, the formation of the U.S. Women&#x27;s Lacrosse Association led to a change in these rules.

==Rules==
The details that follow are the United States college rules. In the U.S., 12 players constitute a full team, including the goalkeeper during usual play. The ball used in women&#x27;s lacrosse is yellow (men&#x27;s lacrosse uses a white ball). The duration of the game is 60 minutes split into four 15-minute quarters, with a two-minute break following the first and third quarters. Halftime is ten minutes unless both the coaches agree prior to the start of the game on fewer minutes. Each team is allowed three 2 minute team timeouts. A time-out may be requested by the head coach or any player on the field. With the addition of free-movement to both U.S. Lacrosse and NCAA rule codes, players are no longer required to drop their sticks in place during a timeout.

Before a game can begin, every stick that each player is planning on using during the game must be approved by the referee; the process is called a &quot;stick check&quot;. The evaluation is based on a set of standards created by U.S. Lacrosse and the NCAA. These standards may change as new sticks are being created by lacrosse equipment companies. During a stick check, a standard lacrosse ball is placed into the head of the stick and viewed by the referee at eye level. If the ball cannot be seen over the top of the side-wall of the head of the stick, then the pocket is too deep for play. The stick may also be checked by placing the ball in and tilting the stick at about a 45 degree angle and letting the ball roll down and out of the stick. This occurs on both the back and the front of the stick. If the ball gets stuck, then the pocket is too deep and the strings must be adjusted. A pocket that is deeper than regulation causes an unfair advantage for the individual with the stick. If the stick pocket is too deep, this can be fixed by tightening the stringing, but if a stick’s pocket depth cannot be adjusted to regulation, the stick cannot be used in the game. An example of a stick stringing regulation is that the shooting string attachment must be 3.5 inches from the top of the head. After a player scores a goal, the player must drop her stick so that the referee can check that the stick is within regulation. This rule only applies in collegiate and professional lacrosse, while in high school and club play, as long as the stick is cleared prior to play, it doesn&#x27;t have to be checked after a goal is scored. However, a coach may request a stick check following a goal, and if the goal-scorer’s stick pocket is too deep or the stick is non-standard, the goal will be overruled. Also, throughout the game, an opposing team may challenge a player&#x27;s stick, meaning asking the referee to check that a player&#x27;s stick is legal for play.

The rules of women&#x27;s lacrosse differ significantly from men&#x27;s lacrosse. In international women&#x27;s lacrosse, 10 players constitute a full team, and its rules differ slightly from the U.S. rules.

The women&#x27;s lacrosse game saw numerous rule changes in 2000. Modifications included limiting the number of players allowed between the two restraining lines on the draw to five players per team. This rule has since been modified so that only three members per team may be within the restraining lines prior to either team gaining possession of the ball after the draw. Stick modifications have led to offset heads, which allow the women&#x27;s game to move faster and makes stick moves and tricks easier. The stick became similar to the men&#x27;s stick, with a deeper pocket and more rounded head. In 2002, goggles became mandatory equipment in the United States (but not a requirement in international rules). In 2006, hard boundaries were adopted. Prior to hard boundaries, referees stopped play when the action moved too far away. Passes that were thrown out of bounds would be awarded to the team closest to the ball. After this rule change, balls lost out of bounds became turnovers and were awarded to the opposing team, except on a shot, in which case, the player closest to the ball at the time it went out of bounds would have possession. One of the rules for player safety is called &quot;shooting space&quot;, which prohibits a defender from running directly into the shooting lane of the player about to shoot in order to obstruct a shot on goal. The shooting lane can be visualized by imagining two lines extending from the ball carrier, one going to the left side of the goal circle, and the other going to the right. The defender cannot enter this space unless they are within a stick’s length of the shooter. To avoid this, the defender must run up at an angle to the player about to shoot. This violation can only be called if the defender is in the critical scoring area and the attacker is within the 12-meter with the ability to shoot.

In 2013, women&#x27;s NCAA lacrosse included a changed rule on defending. When their team does not possess the ball, players in their defending end of the field may run through any portion of the 8-meter arc for as long as three seconds without marking an attacker. Players that are on attack are not allowed to run through the goal circle.

In 2015, for the 2016 season, there were a few other major rule changes. Players are allowed to kick the ball in order to get it out of traffic (in the past, kicking the ball resulted in an automatic relinquishing of possession to the other team). Also, players are allowed to self-start after an opposing player commits a minor foul against them. Before moving forward, one must stand still in an athletic stance before self-starting to let the referee know the player is ready to continue with game play.

In 2016, for the 2017 season, NCAA Division I implemented a 90-second possession shot clock, which was added to Divisions II and III in the following year.

In the summer of 2017, the NCAA added more major changes. Prior to the newest addition, all players needed to stop play upon whistle of the referee. Play was resumed upon another whistle or continuation by self-start. Free movement was implemented, meaning upon the whistle for a foul, play does not stop unless for halftime or the end of the game. Also, the defense is allowed to run through the crease of the lacrosse goal. For the draw, only 3 players, instead of 5 players, from each team are allowed into the midfield area until possession has been established. Last, a player must move out of the 8-meter arc after a penalty has been called.

In 2021 and 2022, there were further significant rule changes. The pre-game stick checks by referees were eliminated. In the past, players had their sticks checked by the referees to ensure they were within regulation. A player&#x27;s stick instead will be checked after each goal scored by that player. Throughout the game, a team can request the referee to check an opposing player&#x27;s stick. If the stick is illegal, the team requesting the stick check gains possession of the ball. If the stick is within regulation, the team requesting the check loses possession. If a team requests a check that affirms a legal stick for a second time, it loses a timeout. If a team has no timeouts remaining, it is not allowed to request a stick check. Another rule change eliminated the two 30-minute halves, instead implementing four 15-minute quarters with 2-minute breaks following the first and third quarters. The possession clock procedure has also changed in order to achieve fewer stoppages. When showing less than 60 seconds, the clock resets to 60 seconds if a team&#x27;s offense regains possession of the ball after a goalie save or a shot that rebounds off of the goal.

===Players===

Traditionally, women played with three attackers (starting with the position closest to the net that a team is shooting at, the attack positions are called &quot;first home&quot;, &quot;second home&quot;, and &quot;third home&quot;), five midfielders (a &quot;right attack wing&quot;, a &quot;left attack wing&quot;, a &quot;right defensive wing&quot;, a &quot;left defensive wing&quot;, and a &quot;center&quot;), three defenders (starting from the position closest to the net a team is defending, these positions are called &quot;point&quot;, &quot;cover point&quot;, and &quot;third man&quot;), and one goalie. The positions used to be pinned on the players, and the players used to be required to be marked on defense by their opposite number (third man or &quot;3M&quot; covering the opposing third home &quot;3H&quot;).

Today, under North American rules, seven players play attack at one time and seven defenders are present. Generally, a team has four attackers, four close defenders, and three midfielders. There is a restraining line that keeps the four defensive players (plus the goalie) from going into the attack, or four attackers from going into the defensive zone. If those players cross the line and participate in the play, they are considered offside and a major foul is called.

===Equipment===
Women&#x27;s lacrosse rules are specifically designed to limit physical contact between players. As a result of the lack of contact, the only protective equipment required are a mouth guard and face guard/goggles. Although headgear is not required (except for the U.S. state of Florida, where it is mandatory for girls lacrosse players), it is considered for lacrosse players due to the risk of head injury. In 2017 Brown University purchased headgear for its team and was the first NCAA program to make helmets available to the whole team.

Players must wear eye protection according to U.S. Lacrosse rules. All field players must properly wear eye protection that meets ASTM specification standard F803 for women&#x27;s adult/ youth lacrosse for the appropriate level of play.Or if preferred (and mandatory in some states including Florida) players wear helmets. All players must wear a professionally manufactured intra-oral mouthpiece that fully covers the teeth. The mouthguard must include portions protecting and separating the biting surfaces and protecting the teeth and supporting structures and has to cover the posterior teeth with adequate thickness. As of the 2024 spring season, mouthguards that are white, clear, or feature a design that is meant to imitate the appearance of teeth/fangs are permitted at all levels of play. Mouth pieces must be worn at all times and cannot be taken out in the middle of play. No protruding tabs are allowed for field players.

In addition, players may choose to wear gloves, and most jewelry is not allowed to be worn. There are exceptions to this, as hair ties and other soft/non-abrasive accessories on the arm are permitted, but earrings (unless the piercings are recent and covered by tape), rings, and necklaces are completely prohibited. Hair adornments like beads may be worn so long as they are secured and do not present a danger to the athlete or to others. Religious or cosmetic headwear is also permitted under the same conditions, any protective head coverings worn for medical reasons must be approved by the officials. Although the rules specify these types of protection, injuries still occur from accidental checks to the head and the overall nature of the sport.

Players must wear composition or rubber soled shoes. No spikes are allowed. Plastic, leather, or rubber cleats-studs may be worn. Shoes and socks are not required to be identical for team members.

The pockets of women&#x27;s sticks are shallower than those of the men, making the ball more difficult to catch and to shoot at high speed. The pockets also make it harder to cradle without dropping the ball. The crosse of a women&#x27;s stick may be 35.5 inches and no longer than 43.25 according to the NCAA girls lacrosse committee.

The crosse (lacrosse stick) is divided into two parts, the shaft and the head. The shaft can be made of a variety of materials such as wood, aluminum and composite materials depending on what position the player prefers. Women&#x27;s lacrosse rules mandate that only composite and aluminum shafts can be used, due to accidental checks and hitting that can happen during the duration of the games. The top of the stick is where the head joins the shaft to make the whole stick. The head is made of compact plastic where the mesh, sidewall and pocket form.

There are different mesh types made from materials which affect the shot accuracy and handling of the ball. The sidewall is the siding of the head that affects the depth of the pocket and stiffness the feel when handling the ball. More stiff sidewalls and heads are better to use for defense players who want to check harder. More flexible sidewalls are better use of picking up groundballs, movement and face-offs. The pocket is made from mesh, and with these different meshes they can have different capabilities; a wide pocket allows and easier time catching balls, but will also cause less ball control, while a smaller head will allow the user a more hard time catching the ball but lends greater accuracy. The pocket of the lacrosse stick can often be easily adjusted to ensure the depth of the pocket is legal and meets the players preference before the start of a game.

The lacrosse ball is made of solid rubber and can be yellow, orange, blue or green. All lacrosse balls must meet NOCSAE (National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment) standards.

===Playing area===

The size of the playing field depends on the players&#x27; age group. For U15 and U13 players, they must play on a regulation sized field with all appropriate markings. For U11, they must play on a regulation sized field with all appropriate markings whenever possible. Otherwise, they may play on a modified field with reduced players. For U9 players the fields must be rectangular, between 60 and 70 yards in length and 30–40 yards in width to accommodate play on existing fields.

Under World Lacrosse rules, there are two different areas around the goal on both sides of the field: the 3 meter goal circle around the goal (called the &quot;crease&quot;) and the 11-meter arc. The players are never allowed to enter the crease on their attack side of the field. However, defenders are allowed to run through the crease while actively marking an attacker. Only the goalkeeper is allowed to remain stationary inside the crease. If a defensive foul occurs inside the 11-meter arc, all players that were previously inside the penalty area (defined as the area inside the 11-meter arc and the space within and between the restart dots that are behind the goal) must move to a location outside of the penalty area. The player who was fouled, must move to the nearest hash mark that is located around the edges of the arc and has a direct lane to goal. The defender who committed the foul is relocated 4 meters directly behind the shooter. If a player fouled another player not in the arc, the victim receives the ball and the player who fouled must back away at least 4 meters. All other players standing closer than 4 meters to the ball holder must also back away to give the player room to move with the ball. If outside the 11-meter arc, the offended player regains the ball and the person who committed the foul is relocated 4 meters behind the offender. Outside the 11-meter arc the game may be restarted by the offended player self-starting.

Under USA college rules, the two different areas around the goal on both sides of the field are the 8-meter arc and the 12-meter fan. When committing a major foul inside either of these areas, the offense regains the ball and has a direct opportunity to shoot at the goal. If outside the 8-meter arc, but inside the fan, a &quot;lane&quot; to goal is cleared of all other players and the person who committed the foul is relocated 4 meters behind the offender. If inside the 8-meter arc and a defensive foul occurs, all players that were previously inside the penalty area (defined as the area inside the 8-meter arc, the two pie shaped areas on either side of the arc, and the space within and between the restart dots that are behind the goal) must move to a location outside of the penalty area. The player who was fouled, now moves to the nearest hash mark that is located around the edges of the arc and has a direct lane to goal. The defender who committed the foul is relocated on the 12-meter fan directly behind the shooter. If a player fouled another player not in the arc, the victim receives the ball and the player who fouled must back away at least 4 meters. All other players standing closer than 4 meters to the ball holder must also back away to give the player room to move with the ball.

The shooting space rule in women&#x27;s lacrosse is very important in keeping the players safe. It occurs when a defender moves into the offender&#x27;s shooting lane to goal, while not marking an opponent at an angle that makes the defender at risk of being hit by the ball if the offender were to shoot. A shooting space violation calls for an immediate whistle by the umpire, granted that the attacking player with the ball would have the opportunity to shoot, and the attacker will be awarded a free position from the nearest hash mark on the 11-meter arc. Repeated shooting space violations may result in a yellow card.

===Tie-breaking methods===
Should a tie remain after regulation, the teams will then play 3-minute golden goal periods until one team scores, which wins the game.

===Ball in and out of play===
The &quot;draw&quot; is what starts the game and keeps the game going after a goal is scored. The draw is when two players, one from each team, stand in the center circle with the backs of their sticks facing each other. Then the referee places the ball between the two sticks. Each player has to push their sticks together parallel to the ground to contain the ball. There are allowed two players to stand along the circle surrounding the center circle during the draw. The players’ sticks around the circle cannot break the line until the whistle is blown. The centers must lift and pull their sticks over their heads releasing the ball. If one player taking the draw moves or lifts their stick before the other player, it is penalized as an illegal draw.

Protecting one&#x27;s stick from being checked is a very important key in the game of women&#x27;s lacrosse. In order to protect the stick from being checked, the player must cradle the ball. If the player has a strong &quot;cradle&quot;, it would make it much more difficult to recover the ball for the opposing team. &quot;Cradling&quot; is the back and forth movement and twisting of the head of the stick, which keeps the ball in the pocket with centripetal force.

Allowable checking is based on what age level of the game is being played. Rules for U15 and above allow lacrosse players full checking above the head. However, this requires that at least one of the two umpires have a USL Local Rating so that they can judge the appropriate amount of contact. In most cases, a check into the head area is a mandatory yellow card. If a sufficiently experienced umpire is not available, then U13 checking rules must be used where modified checking only below the shoulder is allowed. In U11 and U9 no checking is allowed. US Lacrosse rules recommend that Middle School/Junior High players play with U13 checking rules.

In women&#x27;s lacrosse, players may only check if the check is directed away from the ball carrier&#x27;s head. Also, players may only check using the side of their stick. If caught by one of the referees using the flat of the head, it will be called as a &quot;held check&quot; and the opposing team will get the ball.

There are two types of fouls in women&#x27;s lacrosse, major and minor. When a minor foul is committed anywhere on the field, the player who committed the foul is set 4 meters to whichever side she was last guarding the person she obstructed. If a major foul occurs outside of the 12-meter fan or 8-meter arc, the fouler must stand 4 meters behind the player she fouled.

===Penalties===
Penalties for women&#x27;s lacrosse are assessed with the following cards:
* The green card, given to the team, is often for a delay of game. A delay of game is issued when a player fails to move 4 meters as directed by the referee, engages too early, jewelry violation, and improper use of equipment, and includes any behavior that the official deems to be a delay of game. Green cards are also used to mitigate unnecessary fouling and dangerous play in transition. At the high school level, if a team is fouled three times in between the restraining lines, a green card will be awarded to the offending team, sending the last player to commit a foul to the penalty box. In NCAA rules, any foul committed within the restraining lines results in a green card. At both levels, a green card results in a one minute releasable penalty to the player, but at the NCAA level, if one team receives three green cards, the third and every subsequent green card will be unreleasable. 
* The yellow card is for a major penalty deemed too dangerous/unnecessary for a typical whistle and free-position, and results in the player being removed from the field for two minutes. Certain fouls are mandatory yellow card violations, such as Dangerous Contact, Dangerous Follow-Through, Dangerous Propelling, Illegal Body Ball in the Goal Circle, Unsportsmanlike Conduct, Slashing, and Suspended Player Substitute, but any foul that the official deems too dangerous or excessive can be awarded a yellow card. Any player that receives two yellow cards in one game will be ejected from the play and will not be allowed to return to the game. At the high school level, yellow cards are unreleasable, whereas at the NCAA level, the first 3 yellow cards given to a single team in one game are releasable and every card after that point is “full time served”. Yellow cards result in a two-minute man-down penalty for both levels. In high school play, any team that receives four yellow cards in a single game will have to play man-down for the rest of the game, and for every subsequent yellow card, will have to remove another player from the field.
* The red is the result of a particularly flagrant foul or extremely unsportsmanlike behavior, and causes the player to be ejected from the game. Once receiving a red card, the player is also not permitted to play in the following game. This penalty lasts for five minutes in the NCAA and lasts for four minutes in high school play, and is unreleasable under every rule set. In high school play, a red card also means that the recipient’s team must play down a player for the rest of the game, regardless of how many yellow cards that team has been awarded during that game. Red cards also contribute to a team’s “card count,” which, if it reaches 4 cards in one game, the fourth and every subsequent card will require the removal of another player for the remainder of the game.

==International competition==
Beginning in 1972, the sport was governed internationally by the International Federation of Women&#x27;s Lacrosse Associations (IFWLA). The formation of the IFWLA actually predated that of the corresponding body for men&#x27;s lacrosse, the International Lacrosse Federation (ILF), by two years.

In August 2008, after negotiations lasting four years, the IFWLA and ILF agreed to merge into a single governing body, the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL). All tournaments operated by the IFWLA were taken over by the FIL. The FIL changed its name to World Lacrosse in 2019.

The World Lacrosse Women&#x27;s World Championship, formerly the Women&#x27;s Lacrosse World Cup, is held every four years. It was organized by the IFWLA before its merger with the IFL and is now organized by World Lacrosse. The 2022 edition was hosted by the United States in Towson, Maryland, where the United States defeated Canada in the final. Only two countries have ever won the world championship Australia (two times) and the United States (nine times). Canada and England have both reached the final, but neither country lifted the trophy.

==Leagues==
Athletes Unlimited Lacrosse - A four team league which started play in 2021.

Women&#x27;s Professional Lacrosse League - Was a four team league which was started in 2018, but ceased operations in 2020.

<text>The Bruce Peninsula is a peninsula in Ontario, Canada, that divides Georgian Bay of Lake Huron from the lake&#x27;s main basin. The peninsula extends roughly northwestwards from the rest of Southwestern Ontario, pointing towards Manitoulin Island, with which it forms the widest strait joining Georgian Bay to the rest of Lake Huron. The Bruce Peninsula contains part of the geological formation known as the Niagara Escarpment. The entire peninsula and nearby communities to the south along Lake Huron are located within Bruce County, Ontario.

The peninsula is a popular tourist destination for camping, hiking and fishing, with two national parks (Bruce Peninsula National Park and Fathom Five National Marine Park), more than half a dozen nature reserves, and the Bruce Peninsula Bird Observatory. The Bruce Trail runs through the region to its northern terminus in the town of Tobermory. This region is named after James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin (Lord Elgin), Governor General of Canada. Parks Canada now refers to the peninsula as &quot;Saugeen Peninsula&quot; in recognition of its being traditional territories of the Saugeen-Ojibway nation. However the national park retains the name &quot;Bruce Peninsula National Park&quot; for the time being.

The Bruce Peninsula is a key area for both plant and animal wildlife. Part of the Niagara Escarpment World Biosphere Reserve, the peninsula has the largest remaining area of forest and natural habitat in Southern Ontario and is home to some of the oldest trees in eastern North America. An important flyway for migrating birds, the peninsula is habitat to a variety of animals, including black bear, massasauga rattlesnake, and barred owl.

== History ==
===History from the 19th century===

Until the mid-19th century, the area known as the Bruce Peninsula was territory controlled by the Saugeen Ojibway Nations. The nations included the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation and Saugeen First Nation. Historical and archaeological evidence from the area concludes that at the time of first contact with Europeans, the peninsula was inhabited by the Odawa people, from whom a large number of local native people are descended. Oral history from Saugeen and Nawash suggests their ancestors have been here as early as 7500 years ago. The area of Hope Bay is known to natives as &quot;Nochemoweniing,&quot; or Place of Healing.

In 1836 the Saugeen Ojibway signed a treaty with Sir Francis Bond Head to cede lands south of the peninsula to the Canadian government in exchange for learning agriculture, proper housing, assistance in becoming &quot;civilized,&quot; and for permanent protection of the peninsula. In 1854, the Saugeen Ojibway agreed to sign another treaty – this time for the peninsula itself. In 1994, after decades on increasing First Nations activism, the Saugeen Ojibway filed a suit for a land claim for part of their traditional territory; they claimed breach of trust by the Crown in failing to meet its treaty obligations to protect Aboriginal lands. The claim seeks the return of lands still held by the Crown and financial compensation for other lands. This claim is still active.

European settlement began on the peninsula in the mid-19th century, despite its poor potential for agricultural development. Attracted by the rich fisheries and lush forest, settlers found the land known then as the &quot;Indian or Saugeen Peninsula&quot; to be irresistible. In 1881, settlers built the first sawmill on the peninsula in Tobermory. In less than 20 years, most of the valuable timber was gone, and timber industry jobs declined. Fuelled by the waste left behind by the rapid logging and land clearances, intense forest fires sprang up around the peninsula in 1908, burning large swaths of land. By the mid-1920s, the formerly abundant forests of the peninsula were nearly barren. When the lamprey eel was accidentally introduced to the Great Lakes in 1932, the devastation on the fish supply made the peninsula a less attractive place to live; many left when fish stocks became depleted. The peninsula underwent a steady decline in population until the 1970s. In the late 20th century, the peninsula started to attract a new kind of resident: the cottager. Today, seasonal residents outnumber permanent residents, especially in the summer.

===Natural history of the Bruce Peninsula and the Niagara Escarpment===

In its southern Ontario portion, the Niagara Escarpment is a ridge of rock several hundred metres high in some locations, stretching from Queenston on the Niagara River, to Tobermory at the tip of the Bruce Peninsula. Today, in Ontario, the Escarpment contains more than 100 sites of geological significance, including some of the best exposures of rocks and fossils of the Silurian and Ordovician periods (405 to 500 million years old) to be found anywhere in the world.

The Niagara Escarpment has origins dating to the Silurian age some 430 to 450 million years ago, a time when the area lay under a shallow warm sea. This sea lay in a depression of the Earth&#x27;s crust, centered in what is now the lower peninsula of the State of Michigan. Known geologically as the Michigan Basin, the outer rim of this massive saucer-shaped feature governs the location of the Niagara Escarpment, which is shaped like a gigantic horseshoe. The Escarpment can be traced from near Rochester, New York, south of Lake Ontario to Hamilton, north to Tobermory on the Bruce Peninsula. It is covered by the waters of Lake Huron, appearing as Manitoulin Island, then across the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and down the west side of Lake Michigan into the State of Wisconsin.

As occurs with present-day water bodies, such as Hudson Bay or the Gulf of Mexico, rivers flowing into this ancient sea carried sand, silt and clay to be deposited as thick layers of sediment. At the same time, lime-rich organic material from the abundant sea life was also accumulating. Over millions of years these materials became compressed into massive layers of sedimentary rocks and ancient reef structures now visible along the Escarpment. Some rock layers now consist of soft shales and sandstones while others are made up of dolomite (a rock similar to limestone which contains magnesium and is more durable).

Today, fossil remains illustrating the various life forms can be found in many of the rocks as they are slowly exposed by the action of wind, water and ice.
===Indigenous history===

Saugeen First Nation is an Ojibwa First Nation located along the Saugeen River and Bruce Peninsula in Ontario, Canada. The original territory included all of the Saugeen River watershed and all of the Bruce Peninsula.

Organized in the mid-1970s, during a period of increased political activism, Saugeen First Nation declared itself the primary &#x27;political successor apparent&#x27; to the historic Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory, who had occupied this territory and made treaties with the Crown. However, along with the Saugeen First Nation, the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation also claims to be the &#x27;political successor apparent&#x27; to the Chippewa of Saugeen Ojibway Territory. Under the Saugeen Tract Agreement, the portion south of Owen Sound was ceded to the Crown, with reserves later established on the Bruce Peninsula.

The claims for land and payment of rent on lands discussed in early treaties are significant. The Saugeen is now determined to establish its claim to the waters of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay and any Crown Land remaining on the peninsula. &quot;The two First Nations are claiming aboriginal title to the lands under the water covering an area of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay from south of Goderich, west to the international border and north to the mid-point between the tip of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island; then east to the mid-point of Georgian Bay and south to the southernmost point of Nottawasaga Bay.&quot; A trial to establish the ownership and resolve disputes over the treaties began in 2019.

== Parks ==
There are 2 National Parks, 8 Ontario Parks, and 4 Federation of Ontario Naturalists Parks located within the Bruce Peninsula.

* Bruce Peninsula National Park - In the heart of a World Biosphere Reserve, the park contains massive, rugged cliffs inhabited by thousand year old cedar trees. The park is composed of an array of habitats from alvars to dense forests and several small lakes. Together these form a greater ecosystem - the largest remaining chunk of natural habitat in southern Ontario.
* Fathom Five National Marine Park - The waters at the mouth of Georgian Bay are home to Fathom Five - Canada&#x27;s first National Marine Conservation Area. The park preserves 22 shipwrecks and several historic light stations. Fathom Five&#x27;s freshwater ecosystem contains some of the most pristine waters of the Great Lakes. The park contains rugged lake bed topography that is popular with scuba divers.

Ontario Parks - include:
* Black Creek 
* Ira Lake 
* Johnstons Harbour
* Little Cove 
* Cabot Head 
* Smoky Head 
* Lion&#x27;s Head 
* Hope Bay Forest

Federation of Ontario Naturalists - Ontario Nature works to protect and restore the species, spaces and landscapes that represent the full diversity of nature in Ontario.

== Climate and habitat ==
The Bruce Peninsula has a cold climate, with freezing cold winters and mild summers, caused by maritime cooling from Lake Huron.

The peninsula has eastern mixed forests and boreal forest, especially to the north of the peninsula. Due to almost all of the Bruce Peninsula being in a Snowbelt, the peninsula experiences heavy Lake-effect snow from Lake Huron, often receiving multiple meters of snow per year, which can be extremely dangerous for unprepared individuals.

== Lighthouses ==
The Bruce Peninsula&#x27;s shoreline has several lighthouses, necessary to provide guidance to the many ships that would pass by her shores.

The Cove Island Light, located near Tobermory is one of the six famous &quot;Imperial&quot; lighthouses built in the 1850s by John Brown which can be found on the mainland and on nearby islands of the northern Bruce Peninsula.
Other lighthouses include:

* Lion&#x27;s Head Lighthouse
* Flowerpot Island
* Big Tub Lighthouse
* Knife &amp; Lyal Island Lighthouse
* Cape Croker Lighthouse
* Cabot Head Lighthouse

== Wildlife ==
There are many varieties of wildlife on the Bruce Peninsula, such as the northern flying squirrel, black bear, chipmunk, fisher, long-eared bats, red squirrel, fox, massasauga rattlesnake, red-shouldered hawk, barred owl, hermit thrush, black-throated blue warbler, scarlet tanager and yellow-spotted salamander.

The Bruce Peninsula is located on a major northern migration route, so many species of birds, such as the bald eagle, have their wintering grounds here.

The highest concentration of nesting birds can be found in the Bruce in May and June each year. About 20 species of warblers breed on &quot;the Bruce,&quot; including the black-throated green, yellow, yellow-rumped, and Blackburnian warblers and the ubiquitous American redstart. They make their summer homes in the extensive wooded areas along the Peninsula. The annual Huron Fringe Birding Festival in May observes the spring migration. The endangered piping plover has made a comeback along the northern shores of Sauble Beach as well, and nest in restricted areas of the beach. These are well marked to prevent visitors overrunning the area and to reduce negative human effects. Migrating hawks also follow the Niagara Escarpment. Hawks travel during the day, and can be seen in the vicinity of Cabot Head in the open areas west of Dyers Bay, and near Tobermory, in April.

== Wildflowers and orchids ==
Some of the rarest flowers and ferns in Ontario can be found growing on the Bruce Peninsula. For example: lakeside daisy (&quot;Tetraneuris herbacea var. glabra&quot;), dwarf lake iris (&quot;Iris lacustris&quot;), and northern holly fern (&quot;Polystichum lonchitis&quot;)

=== Orchids ===
Globally, there are more than 30,000 orchid species. Canada is home to 77 of these species. Ontario has 61 varieties of orchids, and of these, 44 can be found in the Bruce Peninsula.

A selection of interesting orchids on the Bruce Peninsula: 
*yellow lady&#x27;s slipper — &quot;Cypripedium parviflorum&quot;
*pink lady&#x27;s slipper — &quot;Cypripedium acaule&quot;
*nodding ladies&#x27; tresses — &quot;Spiranthes cernua&quot;
*eastern prairie fringed orchid — &quot;Platanthera leucophaea&quot;
*ram&#x27;s-head lady&#x27;s-slipper — &quot;Cypripedium arietinum&quot;
*European common twayblade — &quot;Neottia ovata&quot;
*helleborine — &quot;Epipactis helleborine&quot;

== Communities ==

The Bruce Peninsula is composed of the Municipalities of Northern Bruce Peninsula and South Bruce Peninsula.

The main villages in these regions are as follows:

* Tobermory is located at the northern end of the Bruce Peninsula. It has a landing for the passenger-car ferry &quot;MS Chi-Cheemaun.&quot; Nearby is Bruce Peninsula National Park and Fathom Five National Marine Park. This port village has galleries, tourist shops and a historic lighthouse.
* Lion&#x27;s Head is located in the centre of the Bruce Peninsula on Georgian Bay. The village has a public marina and sandy beach.
* Wiarton, near the south end of the peninsula, is the home of Wiarton Willie.
* Sauble Beach is more than seven miles (11 km) long.

<doc id="608406" wikidata="Q1754064" url="?curid=608406" title="Moonmilk">
<text>Moonmilk (sometimes called mondmilch, also known as bergmilch, montmilch, or cave milk) is a white, creamy substance found inside limestone, dolomite, and possibly other types of caves. It is a precipitate from limestone comprising aggregates of fine crystals of varying composition, usually made of carbonates such as calcite, aragonite, hydromagnesite, and/or monohydrocalcite. 

== Formation and Composition ==
Moonmilk forms as a result of several processes, including both chemical reactions and possible bacterial action. One hypothesis suggests that moonmilk is created by the bacterium &quot;Macromonas bipunctata&quot;. However, no microbiological studies have been carried out to confirm this. Moonmilk was originally thought to be created by moon rays, a misconception reflected in its name.

It is possible that moonmilk forms when water dissolves and softens the karst in caves, carrying dissolved nutrients that are used by microbes, such as Actinomycetes. As microbial colonies grow, they trap and accumulate chemically precipitated crystals in an organic matter-rich matrix. These heterotrophic microbes, which produce CO2 as a waste product of respiration and possibly organic acids, may help to dissolve the carbonate.

== Historical and Cultural Uses ==
In 2017, archaeologists at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in China discovered a bronze jar dating back over 2,700 years, containing animal fat combined with moonmilk. This mixture is believed to have been used as a cosmetic face cream by Chinese noblemen.

Being soft, moonmilk was frequently used as a medium for finger fluting, a form of prehistoric art.

The Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner described moonmilk&#x27;s use as a medicine in the 16th century. It continued to be prescribed until the 19th century.

== Notable Formations ==
The world&#x27;s largest formation of brushite moonmilk is found in the Big Room of Kartchner Caverns State Park in southern Arizona.

<doc id="608407" wikidata="Q5633086" url="?curid=608407" title="HMS Leander (F109)">
<text>HMS &quot;Leander&quot; (F109) was the nameship of the of the Royal Navy (RN). She was originally intended to be part of the and would have been known as &quot;Weymouth&quot;. &quot;Leander&quot; was, like the rest of the class, named after a figure of the classical Greek mythology. She was built by the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Northern Ireland and was launched on 28 June 1961. She was commissioned on 27 March 1963.

==Service history==
===1963–1969===
Upon her commissioning, &quot;Leander&quot; deployed to the West Indies, performing a variety of duties while there. She returned to the United Kingdom in April 1964. In 1965, &quot;Leander&quot; was part of Matchmaker I, a multi-national squadron of NATO, and the predecessor of Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), which was created in 1967, although it was not actually formed until the following year. In 1966, &quot;Leander&quot; deployed to the Pacific and in 1967 she deployed back to the West Indies and subsequently to the Persian Gulf.

===1970–1979===
In 1970, &quot;Leander&quot; joined the NATO multi-national squadron STANAVFORLANT. In June that year, &quot;Leander&quot; began modernisation that included the removal of her one twin 4.5-in gun which was replaced by the Ikara anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missile launcher. The work was completed in December 1972. In 1974, she joined the 3rd Frigate Squadron, which included other &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates. That same year, as part of that squadron, &quot;Leander&quot; took part in Task Group (TG) 317.2, a deployment that caused some controversy back in the UK when the TG, on its way to the Far East/Pacific, visited South Africa, which was at that time under apartheid rule. As well as visiting two ports in South Africa, the TG performed military exercises with the South African armed forces, which caused uproar in some parts of the governing Labour Party, as well as gaining much press coverage.
&quot;Leander&quot;, with the rest of the TG visited Cape Town, while and the submarine visited Simonstown. The TG, upon reaching their destination performed a number of exercises and &#x27;fly the flag&#x27; visits with Far East and Pacific countries. While in the region, &quot;Leander&quot;, like a number of the TG, was shadowed by a number of nations, including the Soviet Union, a common occurrence during the Cold War. The TG did not visit South Africa on their return, and headed to Brazil for an exercise with the Brazilian Navy. &quot;Leander&quot; returned to the United Kingdom in June 1975.

In December 1975, &quot;Leander&quot;, under the command of Captain John Tait, began a Fishery Protection Patrol during the Third Cod War between the United Kingdom and Iceland over fishing disputes. Like many other Royal Navy vessels, she was confronted by Icelandic gunboats. In January 1976, she rammed the Icelandic gunboat &quot;Þór&quot; (&quot;Thor&quot;), causing some damage to both ships. &quot;Þór&quot; sailed back to port for repairs with her helicopter deck damaged, while &quot;Leander&quot;&#x27;s hull was dented on her starboard bow. No further collisions with Icelandic gunboats occurred on her first patrol, but on 17 January, the ship broke down during a heavy storm. She eventually made her way back to Faslane. The damage she suffered during her Fishery Patrol and during the storm was repaired at Devonport Dockyard. When the repairs were made, &quot;Leander&quot; undertook a second Fishery Patrol, and rammed another Icelandic patrol boat, &quot;Ver&quot; on 22 May 1976. &quot;Leander&quot;&#x27;s stem was shattered, while part of &quot;Ver&quot;&#x27;s port quarter was ripped off.

In 1977, &quot;Leander&quot; undertook a refit, and the following year headed to the West Indies, California, British Columbia, Mexico and Florida.

===1980–1989===
In 1982, &quot;Leander&quot; came to the aid of the Portuguese vessel MV &quot;Ave Maria&quot; which was ablaze off Exeter. &quot;Leander&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean in 1983 and again in 1985.

==Fate==
On 31 July 1986 &quot;Leander&quot; was placed in Reserve, becoming part of the Standby Squadron. A potential sale to Chile did not occur, possibly due to Australia prohibiting the sale of the Ikara ASW missile to non-Commonwealth nations. In April 1987, &quot;Leander&quot; was decommissioned. Her career came to an end in 1989, when during a naval exercise, she was sunk by a Sea Dart missile, three Exocets and one gravity bomb.

<text>The Oread Institute was a women&#x27;s college founded in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1849 by Eli Thayer. Before its closing in 1934, it was one of the oldest institutions of higher education for women in the United States. According to the &quot;Worcester Women&#x27;s History Project&quot;:

:&quot;&quot;The Oread offered three levels of instruction: primary, academic and collegiate. The four-year collegiate program offered a classical, college-level curriculum and is thought to be the first institution of its kind exclusively for women in the country. It was modeled after the program at Brown University, Thayer’s alma mater&quot;.&quot;

Two graduates of Oread, Sophia Packard and ornamental music teacher Harriet Giles, would eventually found Spelman College, named after Oread graduate Laura Spelman Rockefeller. Laura Spelman was the future wife of John D. Rockefeller, having attended Oread while her future husband, who dropped out of Cleveland&#x27;s Central High School in the 1850s, worked as a clerk.

Thayer constructed an enormous Gothic-style castle for his new college, complete with turrets. The college closed in 1881.

From 1898 to 1904 the building was the &quot;Worcester Domestic Science Cooking School&quot; and was finally closed in 1934.

The institute lent its name to Mount Oread, a hill in Lawrence, Kansas, upon which the main campus of the University of Kansas is currently situated. Lawrence was founded in 1854 by settlers from Massachusetts who had been sent there by the New England Emigrant Aid Company, which was created by Eli Thayer.

<text>Choro (, &quot;cry&quot; or &quot;lament&quot;), also popularly called chorinho (&quot;little cry&quot; or &quot;little lament&quot;), is an instrumental Brazilian popular music genre which originated in 19th century Rio de Janeiro. Despite its , the music often has a fast and happy rhythm. It is characterized by virtuosity, improvisation and subtle modulations, and is full of syncopation and counterpoint. Choro is considered the first characteristically Brazilian genre of urban popular music. The serenaders who play choros are known as chorões.

==Choro instruments==

Originally &quot;choro&quot; was played by a trio of flute, guitar and cavaquinho (a small chordophone with four strings). Other instruments commonly played in choro are the mandolin, clarinet, saxophone, trumpet and trombone. These melody instruments are backed by a rhythm section composed of 6-string guitar, seven-string guitar (playing bass lines) and light percussion, such as a pandeiro. The cavaquinho appears sometimes as a melody instrument, other times as part of the rhythm.
==Compositional structure==
Structurally, a &quot;choro&quot; composition usually has three parts, played in a rondo form: AABBACCA, with each section typically in a different key (usually the tonal sequence is: principal key-&gt;relative mode-&gt;sub-dominant key). There are a variety of choros in both major and minor keys.
==History==

In the 19th century, choro resulted from the style of playing several musical genres (polka, schottische, waltz, mazurka and habanera) by carioca musicians, who were already strongly influenced by afro-brazilian rhythms, principally the lundu and the batuque. The term “choro” was used informally at first to refer to the style of playing, or a particular instrumental ensemble, (e.g. in the 1870s flutist Joaquim Antônio da Silva Calado formed an ensemble called &quot;Choro Carioca&quot;, with flute, two guitars and cavaquinho), and later the term referred to the music genre of these ensembles. The accompanying music of the Maxixe (dance) (also called &quot;tango brasileiro&quot;) was played by these choro ensembles. Various genres were incorporated as subgenres of choro such as &quot;choro-polca&quot;, &quot;choro-lundu&quot;, &quot;choro-xote&quot; (from schottische), &quot;choro-mazurca&quot;, &quot;choro-valsa&quot; (waltz), &quot;choro-maxixe&quot;, &quot;samba-choro&quot;, &quot;choro baião&quot;.

Just like ragtime in the United States, tango in Argentina and habanera in Cuba, choro springs up as a result of influences of musical styles and rhythms coming from Europe and Africa.

In the beginning (by the 1880s to 1920s), the success of choro came from informal groups of friends (principally composed of workers from the postal, railway and telegraphic services) which played at parties, pubs (botecos), streets and home balls (forrobodós). The mainstay of the repertoire was made of the big hits of Ernesto Nazareth, Chiquinha Gonzaga and other pianists, whose musical scores were published by print houses. By the 1910s, many of the first Brazilian phonograph records were choros.

Much of the mainstream success (by the 1930s to 1940s) of this style of music came from the early days of radio, when bands performed live on the air. By the 1950s and 1960s, it was replaced with urban samba on the radio, but it was still alive in amateur circles called &quot;rodas de choro&quot; (choro gatherings in residences and botecos), the most famous ones being the roda de choro in the house of composer and musician Jacob do Bandolim, in the Jacarepaguá neighborhood in Rio; and the &quot;roda de choro&quot; in the pub &quot;Suvaco de Cobra&quot; (Snake&#x27;s Armpit) in the Penha neighborhood in the same town.

In the late 1970s there was a successful effort to revitalize the genre in the mainstream, through TV-sponsored nationwide festivals in 1977 and 1978, which attracted a new, younger generation of professional musicians and listeners. Thanks in great part to these efforts, choro music remains strong in Brazil. More recently, choro has attracted the attention of musicians in the United States, such as Anat Cohen, Mike Marshall and Maurita Murphy Mead, who have brought this kind of music to a new audience.

Most Brazilian classical composers recognize the sophistication of choro and its major importance in Brazilian instrumental music. Radamés Gnattali said it was the most sophisticated instrumental popular music in the world. Heitor Villa-Lobos defined choro as the true incarnation of Brazilian soul.
Notably, both composers had some of their music inspired by choro, dressing it with classical tradition. The French composer Darius Milhaud was enchanted by choro when he lived in Brazil (in 1917) and he composed the ballet &quot;Le Bœuf sur le toit&quot;, in which he quotes close to 30 Brazilian tunes.

According to Aquiles Rique Reis (a Brazilian singer), ”Choro is classical music played with bare feet and callus on the hands”

<text>The New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC) is an organization that serves as the governing body for sports in preparatory schools and leagues in New England. The organization has 169 full member schools as well as 24 associate member schools. The associate member schools are from New England as well as outside the region, including Indiana, New Jersey, New York, and Ontario. The organization is headquartered in Hudson, Massachusetts.

==History==
Although the relationships and rivalries between many of these schools began long before the 20th century, the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council was officially founded in 1942 as an organization of athletic directors from preparatory schools in New England also with two members from Lower Canada.

School representatives met at the Harvard Club of Boston to discuss the future of preparatory school athletics due to government regulations imposed during World War II.

<doc id="608427" wikidata="Q8031360" url="?curid=608427" title="Mormonism and women">
<text>The status of women in Mormonism has been a source of public debate since before the death of Joseph Smith in 1844. Various denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement have taken different paths on the subject of women and their role in the church and in society. Views range from the full equal status and ordination of women to the priesthood, as practiced by the Community of Christ, to a patriarchal system practiced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), to the ultra-patriarchal plural marriage system practiced by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) and other Mormon fundamentalist groups.

==Definition of women==

The LDS Church does not recognize trans women as women, but defines gender as the &quot;biological sex at birth&quot;. The church teaches that if a person is born intersex, the decision to determine the child&#x27;s sex is left to the parents, with the guidance of medical professionals, and that such decisions can be made at birth or can be delayed until medically necessary.

==Women in LDS Church history==
Nineteenth and early 20th-century accounts of Latter-day Saint history often neglected women&#x27;s role in founding the religion. The 1872 history &quot;The Rise, Progress, and Travels of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot; does not name any women. The seven-volume history, &quot;History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot; (1872) by B.H. Roberts only mentions a few women. A notable exception to this was 19th century historian Edward Tullidge, who Claudia Bushman said &quot;stood alone as a Mormon feminist historian before the revitalization of the women&#x27;s movement in the 1970s.&quot; However, a number of women had significant supporting roles; for example, Joseph Smith&#x27;s wife, Emma Hale Smith, served as a scribe during translation of the Book of Mormon and was the subject of one of the church&#x27;s early revelations, which included direction to compile the church&#x27;s first hymnal. Emma Smith also served as head of the Relief Society, originally a self-governing women&#x27;s organization within the church, which is one of the oldest and largest women&#x27;s organizations in the world.

===Women&#x27;s suffrage===
In the secular sphere, Utah Territory was at the forefront of women&#x27;s suffrage; in 1870, it became one of the first states or territories in the Union to grant women the vote, though the federal government removed the franchise from women in 1887 via the Edmunds–Tucker Act. Education and scholarship was also a primary concern for Mormon women. Religious missions, like Bathsheba W. Smith&#x27;s mission to southern Utah to preach &quot;woman&#x27;s rights&quot;, were launched. The &quot;Woman&#x27;s Exponent&quot; magazine, the unofficial publication of the Relief Society, published a 1920 editorial in favor of &quot;equal rights before the law, equal pay for equal work, [and] equal political rights&quot;, stating that a women&#x27;s place is not just &quot;in the nursery&quot; but &quot;in the library, the laboratory, the observatory.&quot;

In 1873, Ann Eliza Young gained national attention after she divorced and sued Brigham Young, who was President of the Church at the time. Ann Eliza accused Young of neglect, cruel treatment, and deserting herself and her children in the harsh conditions of frontier Utah. In 1874, she became one of the first women to testify before the US Congress, and was influential in the antipolygamy legislation passed in the late 1800s. 

Late-19th-century Utah had the most liberal divorce laws in the United States at the time. The laws were advantageous to women: any woman who insisted on a divorce got one. The divorce rate in late 19th-century Utah came close to 30 percent. This divorce rate was inflated by people from other states seeking an easy divorce in Utah. In 1896, Martha Hughes Cannon was the first woman in the nation elected to state senate. She ran against her husband.

===Laying on of hands and priesthood===
In the early church, women would sometimes lay hands on another person to give them a special &quot;women&#x27;s blessing&quot;. Patty Bartlett Sessions recorded giving and receiving blessings from other women in her work as a midwife, as did Louisa Barnes Pratt in her life as a pioneer and a missionary. While not given by virtue of priesthood ordination, these &quot;women&#x27;s blessings&quot; were a normal part of religion at the time. Relief Society president Eliza Snow believed that women did not need to be &quot;set apart&quot; to officiate in temple ordinances or in administering to the sick. She advised that women confide personal issues to the Relief Society president and her counselors, rather than the bishops. Women also participated in the Anointed Quorum in the early church.

Current LDS Church policy dictates that the act of giving blessings &quot;by laying on of hands&quot; is only to be performed by those ordained to offices in the Melchizedek priesthood, which offices are only held by men. However, a 2015 essay published in &quot;The Gospel Topics&quot; section of the church&#x27;s website states that while neither Joseph Smith nor any other church leader ordained women to the priesthood, women do exercise priesthood authority without ordination.

Trans women may be able to receive the priesthood as long as they do not pursue medical, surgical, or social transitioning, as priesthood and temple ordinances are assigned according to birth sex.

==Polygamy==

The status of women in the LDS Church has been a source of public debate beginning in the 19th century, when the church found itself at odds with the United States federal government over its practice of polygamy. Polygamy was introduced into the LDS Church when Joseph Smith prayed about the plural marriage as practiced in the Old Testament. The practice was established in the church in 1831. It continued until 1890 when Wilford Woodruff received a revelation, known as the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, that stopped plural marriage. Following the Manifesto, many groups and individuals left the church in order to continue the practice; however, these groups have no affiliation with the church today.

Although some church leaders are known to have large polygamous families, two-thirds of the men who practiced polygamy in the church only had two wives. Women were able to divorce their husbands. Among the church population as a whole, at its peak, only 25 to 30 percent of members were part of polygamist families by 1870. Despite the legal and cultural issues related to the Mormon practice of polygamy, 19th-century women played a significant public leadership role in Latter-day Saint culture, politics, and doctrine. Some view the role of women in the 19th-century church as the zenith of women&#x27;s institutional and leadership participation in the church hierarchy.

When speaking of polygamy, generally only two extremes are considered: &quot;Mormon women were either highly empowered agents or submissive dupes.&quot; To note only these extremes, however, is to ignore that Mormon women chose to participate in polygamy and the fact that it was a part of their daily lives. Polygamy caused many women to grapple with their faith, but also allowed them to grow closer to God and to make and keep covenants.

Women in polygamous relationships at the time described the experience as a great trial that taught them self-denial. Many were Protestant converts and believed that their suffering helped to purify them. Even when the practice was established, it was not always accepted. Mothers discouraged their daughters from entering into plural relationships. For many, the decision to accept polygamy and practice it was an agonizing and difficult process that brought them closer to God. Some women did not accept polygamy at first and had to pray about, study, and question the practice before receiving an answer from God and accepting it. Elizabeth Graham MacDonald saw polygamy as a form of discipline that taught her subordination to God and her family.
For some women, like Hannah Tapfield King, plural marriage was a way for women to obtain the highest blessings of salvation. King&#x27;s husband was not a member of the church, and although he did convert, the couple was not able to be sealed in the temple. King was sealed to Brigham Young but only for the next life. She remained married to her husband throughout her life and never had relations with Young but was able to ensure blessings for herself through polygamy that she would not otherwise have received in this life. After accepting polygamy, Edith Turbin declared &quot;I had rather to be the 20th wife of an honorably God-fearing Man, than to be the only wife of any one of two thirds of the Men in the world.&quot;

==Gender roles==
Ezra Taft Benson stated that women have qualities of faithfulness, benevolence, and charity that balance the &quot;more aggressive and competitive nature of man&quot;. Speaking of women working in professions equal to men, Howard W. Hunter said, &quot;I hope the time never comes when women will be brought down to the level with men, although they seem to be making these demands in meetings held ... all over the world.&quot;

===Church activity===
Ecclesiastically, the LDS Church is firmly committed to traditional gender roles. Women have a certain degree of authority in some areas, including leadership positions with authority over children and other women, although these women leaders receive supervision and guidance by male priesthood-holding leaders. Women are &quot;endowed&quot; with priesthood power, but are not ordained to priesthood office. Though not considered clergy, women play a significant part in the operation of local congregations teaching classes to adults, teenagers, and children and organizing social, educational, and humanitarian activities. Women may also serve as missionaries, and a select few may perform certain ordinances such as washing and anointing on behalf of women in church temples. Women who have had an abortion (except in the case of rape, incest, or when the mother&#x27;s life is in danger) are usually excluded from missionary service, as are women who have borne a child out of wedlock, and women under 40 who have been divorced. On October 6, 2012, church president Thomas S. Monson announced that all male missionaries, regardless of nation, could serve from age 18. Prior to the announcement, members from some countries were allowed to serve from the younger age to avoid conflict with educational or military requirements. It was also announced that young women may serve beginning at age 19 instead of 21. Missions typically last two years for males, 18 months for females, and 1 to 3 years for older couples.

Aside from the years starting in 1967 until 1978 women have been allowed to pray in sacrament meetings. Women leaders have regularly given sermons at the church&#x27;s semi-annual general conference, but it was not until 2013 that a woman was invited to pray during a general session of the conference.

A survey conducted in 2012 of 500 Mormons in the United States showed that if they were married to a Latter-day Saint spouse, men and women had equal levels of church activity. Almost half of the men surveyed agreed that a good Latter-day Saint should obey without knowing why, while only 31 percent of women agreed. About 20 percent of the women stated that &quot;women do not have enough say in the church.&quot; A 2024 social media post stating, &quot;There is no other religious organization in the world ... that has so broadly given power and authority to women&quot;, was met largely with a negative response, with many LDS women stating it was untrue.

In 2019, it was announced that any baptized woman could serve as a witness for the baptism of a living person outside the temple, and any woman holding a current temple recommend, including a limited-use recommend, could be a witness for a proxy baptism for a deceased person, and any woman who was an endowed member with a current temple recommend could serve as a witness to sealing ordinances, living and proxy. In 2023 a local practice in San Francisco of having women sit on the stand before the congregation along with the male &quot;presiding authorities&quot; was ended by a regional church authority.

===Marriage===
LDS Church leaders have taught on many occasions that a woman should obey her husband. Some examples from the 1800s include that of Orson Pratt who wrote in 1852 that a woman should not marry a man unless she &quot;had fully resolved herself to submit herself wholly to his counsel, and let him govern as the head&quot;. Additionally, apostles Heber C. Kimball and George A. Smith both taught in the temple in the 1840s that a wife must be &quot;in subjection&quot; to her husband. Young also taught in the temple that Adam only received the tokens of the priesthood after learning to not listen to his wife, and that women won&#x27;t get back to God unless they follow a man back. Because these teachings on women were given by top leaders in temple they became unquestioned parts of LDS culture.

Other examples of teachings on LDS women in marriages include church president Harold B. Lee&#x27;s 1972 article &quot;Maintain Your Place as a Woman&quot; which stated, &quot;the wife is to obey the law of her husband&quot; (with the caveat &quot;only as he obeys the laws of God&quot;). In contrast, Spencer W. Kimball said that a man &quot;presides&quot; rather than &quot;rules&quot;. Early prophet Brigham Young stated of his wives, &quot;The influence of my women over me is no more than the buzzing of a fly&#x27;s wing in winter.&quot; He also stated, &quot;A woman is the dirtiest creature, dirtier than a man&quot;, and &quot;Men are honest, but if a woman won&#x27;t lie, she is a miracle.&quot;

Initially, early church members defined &quot;celestial marriage&quot; as a polygamous relationship, but the term now refers to any marriage sealed in the temple. After the Manifesto prohibiting plural marriage, members felt that there was a lack of available Mormon men for women to marry, even though there were a sufficient number. Fiction from the &quot;Young Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot; attempts to make religious marriage attractive by describing it as romantic. Unmarried LDS women are promised that if they are faithful, they will have the opportunity to marry in the afterlife.

====Same-sex marriage====

LDS women who are married to other women may receive church discipline including ex-communication. In order to receive church ordinances such as baptism, and to enter church temples, women are required to abstain from sexual activity with other women. Additionally, in the church&#x27;s plan of salvation non-celibate lesbian individuals will not be allowed in the top tier of heaven to receive exaltation unless they repent, and a marriage to a man is a requirement for exaltation. However, they are allowed to attend weekly church worship services.

The church&#x27;s policies and treatment of LGBT people has long been a source of controversy both within and outside the church. They have also been a significant cause of disagreement and disaffection by members. Transgender women are similarly barred from all temple ordinances including temple marriage as of 2023.

===Working and responsibility to children===
&quot;The Family: A Proclamation to the World&quot; states that &quot;Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children&quot;, and an article on women in the church on the official church website states that women have &quot;the greater gift and responsibility for home and children and nurturing there and in other settings.&quot; Numerous quotes from General Authorities support the assertion that women are fundamentally different from men, not just in their physical bodies, but in their spiritual makeup as well. Harold B. Lee said that women have a special &quot;mother&#x27;s intuition&quot;.

Brigham Young said &quot;As I have often told my sisters in the Female Relief Societies, we have sisters here who, if they had the privilege of studying, would make just as good mathematicians or accountants as any man; and we think they ought to have the privilege to study these branches of knowledge that they may develop the powers with which they are endowed. We believe that women are useful not only to sweep houses, wash dishes, make beds, and raise babies, but that they should stand behind the counter, study law or physic [medicine], or become good book-keepers and be able to do the business in any counting house, and this to enlarge their sphere of usefulness for the benefit of society at large&quot;. Many women in Brigham Young&#x27;s time worked; in 1874, Utah had a respectable class of literate and professional women and a visitor noted that no profession was closed to women. After the church officially ended polygamy, church members adopted a more mainstream Victorian view towards women&#x27;s work, which confined women&#x27;s roles to the home. By 1920, the church&#x27;s ideals for women mirrored society&#x27;s until the 1960s and 70s, when some Church leaders strongly advised against (presumably married) women working outside the home. Spencer W. Kimball said, &quot;Numerous divorces can be traced directly to the day when the wife left the home and went out into the world into employment.&quot; Gordon B. Hinckley made allowances for single mothers and other women in similar circumstances: &quot;I recognize [...] that there are some women (it has become very many, in fact) who have to work to provide for the needs of their families. To you I say, do the very best you can.&quot; A 1986 Ensign article emphasized that husband and wife share the responsibility of providing for their children&#x27;s temporal needs, and that each family would prayerfully decide if a mother would go to work. Mormon women were to reject the secular values of individuality and devote themselves to the eternal women&#x27;s roles of marriage, motherhood, and submissiveness.

The messages of church leaders regarding working women were reflected in the Relief Society&#x27;s housework curriculum. Throughout the 1950s, Relief Society lessons were written by career women who balanced home and work life. Each lesson was listed with the author&#x27;s name, allowing readers to match a name to the curriculum. However, by the 1970s, the church discontinued the lessons written by specific individuals and the use of an author&#x27;s byline. Relief Society lessons were then created to be messages from the church as a whole, &quot;providing no individual model of a professional woman for others to know and follow&quot;.

One 1990 study by Laurence Iannaccone found that starting in 1963, statements from church leaders were highly variable on women&#x27;s topics. After Ezra Taft Benson&#x27;s 1987 talk &quot;To the Mothers in Zion&quot; exhorting women to not work outside the home, many women quit their jobs and some women attending Brigham Young University (BYU) wondered if they should continue their studies. Then-BYU-president Jeffrey R. Holland stated that BYU especially welcomed women, and encouraged personal study and revelation about how to follow church guidelines. The same study found that as the church affirmed new sex roles, the number of living endowments increased (a sign of committed new membership) but the number of endowments for the dead decreased (a sign of committed, experienced member activity). It also found the opposite was true; as the church affirms traditional roles, the number of living endowments increased and the number of endowments for the dead increased.

Some scholars have found that multi-level marketing firms are more prevalent in Mormon communities due to these conflicting responsibilities. Operating a home-based business is seen as increasing the ability to provide for the family, while still physically being present in the home. &quot;LuLaRich&quot; is a documentary about LuLaRoe, a clothing company started by a Mormon couple, which explores these beliefs and how they translated into recruiting distributors for the product.

===Clothing===
Brigham Young said that women&#x27;s dress should reflect that they are separate from the world. On one occasion he called his daughters together and announced that they were too quick to follow the fashions of &quot;the world&quot;, and he insisted they modify their manner of dress. His older daughters had taken to loosening their tight skirts when they were to see their father, in order to make their bustles seem less conspicuous. Young asked them to stop wearing bustles altogether and implored them to cut back on the frivolities of their appearance in order to set an example for the rest of the female members of the church to follow.

After Joseph F. Smith complained about the indecency of some LDS women&#x27;s attire, Amy Brown Lyman led the Relief Society, YLMIA, and Primary in issuing dress guidelines for Mormon women in 1917. These guidelines were not closely followed by members. In 1951, Elder Spencer W. Kimball gave the talk &quot;A Style of Our Own: Modesty in Dress and Its Relationship to the Church&quot;, which was reprinted in the &quot;Church News&quot; and defined modesty for Mormons in the latter half of the 20th century. Kimball said that Latter-day Saint women should have a unique style of their own that did not include strapless dresses, shorts, form-fitting sweaters, or dresses with low necks or backs. Immediately following the talk, many women changed their wardrobes to conform to Kimball&#x27;s instructions and called their wardrobes &quot;kimballized&quot;, but the church issued no formal dress standards. In 1957, the Mutual Improvement Association published a pamphlet on modesty in general. It advised women against &quot;flaunt[ing] one&#x27;s figure&quot;, and also emphasized modesty in speech and conduct. A 1959 &quot;Improvement Era&quot; column counseled teenage girls to keep their clothing clean and ironed.

In the 1960s, the counterculture movement started to influence the dress of Mormon youth. Short skirts, beards and long hair for men, and dirty clothing became popular. Fearing that the counterculture fashions would negatively influence morals, leaders began to advise on dress codes more stringently. Men received instruction to avoid long hair and beards because of their association with counterculture; women&#x27;s dress standards were created to protect their virtue. The miniskirt in particular was denounced as unfashionable as well as immodest. The church&#x27;s modesty rhetoric in the 1960s and 70s also encouraged women to dress femininely especially as androgynous styles became more popular. A more feminine dress style was associated with acceptance of traditional feminine gender roles of the 1950s.

In 1965, the first &quot;For the Strength of Youth&quot; pamphlet was published, and the first presidency encouraged youth and their parents to conform to its regulations. It prescribed skirts that covered the kneecaps and forbade low-cut, strapless, and low-backed attire. It encouraged women to &quot;always try to look feminine&quot; and stated that slacks (rather than skirts or dresses) were appropriate only for hiking and other sports. The 1968 &quot;For the Strength of Youth&quot; pamphlet denounced soiled and sloppy clothing and said that women should not be in public with her hair in curlers. In 1972, the pamphlet was changed to state that skirts should be &quot;of modest length.&quot; Dallin H. Oaks published a formal dress code for BYU in 1971, which allowed pant suits but no other pants for women. Jeans were allowed in 1981, and knee-length shorts in 1991. A specific prohibition against tattoos and multiple earrings was added in 2000. Sister missionaries also received special instruction in dressing professionally starting in 1977. The church published a dress code for its own employees in 1980, which did not allow pant suits.

Finding modest dresses, shorts, and swimsuits presents a challenge to some LDS women. The La Canada first ward in California sewed modest swimsuits for themselves in 1976. One group of LDS young women in Kansas worked with Nordstrom to propose modest dress ideas, garnering over 9,000 women&#x27;s signatures in support of making more modest dresses available.

In 2012 and 2013, some LDS women participated in &quot;Wear Pants to Church Day&quot;, in which they wore trousers to church instead of the customary dresses to encourage gender equality within the church. Over one thousand women participated in 2012.

In 2017, the church announced that its female employees could wear &quot;professional pantsuits and dress slacks&quot; while at work; dresses and skirts had previously been required.

In 2018, it was announced that female missionaries of the church could wear dress slacks except when attending the temple and during Sunday worship services, baptismal services, and mission leadership and zone conferences.

Until 2022, the &quot;For the Strength of Youth&quot; pamphlet for LDS youth defined modest dress standards for young women: &quot;Young women should avoid short shorts and short skirts, shirts that do not cover the stomach, and clothing that does not cover the shoulders or is low-cut in the front or the back.&quot; The pamphlet also counseled women to only wear one pair of earrings. Women who have gone through the temple endowment and wear temple garments must cover their garments, which cover shoulders, midriff, and thighs.

In 2022, the church released a new edition of &quot;For the Strength of Youth&quot; which includes fewer prescriptive standards for dress and grooming. The new edition instead emphasizes the spiritual principles behind the standards. For example, the new passage which corresponds to the past edition&#x27;s statement on modesty now reads: &quot;Avoid styles that emphasize or draw inappropriate attention to your physical body instead of who you are as a child of God with an eternal future. Let moral cleanliness and love for God guide your choices.&quot; The wording in the new edition also eliminates the previous edition&#x27;s differentiation between female and male modesty.

Some members feel that when leaders emphasize dressing modestly to young women, they only emphasize the sexualization of women&#x27;s bodies and encourage women to judge each other by their physical appearance. Other members feel that modest dress is the first defense against immorality, and that dressing modestly will help individuals act modestly.

Trans women are counseled to dress and groom themselves as men, and are advised that those who socially transition will experience some church membership restrictions for the duration of this transition.

==Factors affecting mental health==
Mormon women are no more likely than other women to report experiencing depression, however, Mormon women who experience depression have specific challenges. A 1993 dissertation by Marleen Williams found a few differences in how Mormon women experience depression. Compared to mildly depressed Protestant women, mildly depressed Mormon women felt more guilt and self-blame, took responsibility for others&#x27; behavior, and depended on others for approval. Compared to non-depressed Mormon women, mildly depressed Mormon women were more likely to have role conflicts and feel their gender role restricted their behavior. A 1984 study by David Spendlove found that poor health, low income, less education, and less perceived caring from spouse were positively correlated with depression in LDS women in Utah. Spendlove also found that for women in Utah in 1984, women who work &quot;may be at a higher risk of depression&quot; than those who do not.

Other studies have examined specific subgroups of Mormon women. A study by Ann Pritt in 1998 found that Mormon women who were sexually abused were more likely to feel distant from God, blame themselves for bad things that happen to them, and be more pessimistic in general compared to Mormon women who were not sexually abused (with both parties having received counseling at some point). Another study by Jacobsen and Wright in 2014 found that Mormon women who experience same-sex attraction feel isolation and worthlessness and need to form a positive self-identity.

==In the temple==

===Menstruation===
In December 1866, Brigham Young gave advice that women should wait a week from the start of menstruation before participating in the endowment.

Some temples in 2012 still did not allow women to perform baptisms for the dead during their menstrual period, despite official policy to the contrary.

===Endowment===
A 1936 policy forbade women whose husbands were not endowed from receiving their own endowment, whether their husbands were members of the church or not. The ostensible reason for the prohibition was to maintain peace and harmony in the home. Gradually the policy changed, first for women whose husbands were members of the church, and then on 12 February 1986, for all women whose husbands were unendowed providing they have the consent of their husbands.

In the temple endowment, women were urged to each be a priestess &quot;unto her husband&quot;, while men were promised they would be priests to God; but in January 2019, that was removed from the endowment process, in accordance with other changes that included more lines for Eve in their ritual performance of the Book of Genesis. Also in 2019, a letter from the church&#x27;s First Presidency stated that &quot;Veiling an endowed woman&#x27;s face prior to burial is optional.&quot; It had previously been required. The letter went on to say that such veiling, &quot;may be done if the sister expressed such a desire while she was living. In cases where the wishes of the deceased sister on this matter are not known, her family should be consulted.&quot; That same year veiling of women during part of the temple endowment ceremony was discontinued.

===Prayer circles===
In current Latter-day Saint temple practice, the endowment ritual contains a prayer circle, where some participants stand in a circle and repeat a prayer given by a single person. Women were first included in the ceremony on September 28, 1843. After 1846, it was uncommon for women to participate in prayer circles without their husbands. Under Eliza R. Snow&#x27;s guidance, some women made women-only prayer circles. In 1896, the first presidency advised against Relief Society prayer circles, but some Relief Societies continued the practice. In 1978, the First Presidency discontinued all prayer circles except those performed in a temple as part of the endowment. Since members of prayer circles had to be approved by the first presidency, continuing this tradition in a worldwide church made for unwieldy paperwork.

==Religiously significant women==

===Heavenly Mother===

Along with the promotion of women&#x27;s rights in the secular sphere, women in Utah, like renowned poet Eliza R. Snow, spoke of women&#x27;s equality in sacred matters. This included the development of a Heavenly Mother theology. Joseph Smith discussed the doctrine of a Heavenly Mother as early as the 1840s. The idea of a Heavenly Mother expanded to a loving mother who sent each of us off on our journey to this earth and who will welcome us back to her again after death. As written in poems by Mormon authors, &quot;[Heavenly Mother] oversees key moments for individual souls in the Mormon progressive plan of salvation.&quot; These ideas were expressed throughout the early 1800s. Today, church leaders continue to mention Heavenly Mother, although less frequently and embellished than in early church history. Neal A. Maxwell affirmed the ideas or a homecoming expressed in Snow&#x27;s poetry about Heavenly Mother by saying, &quot;Could such a regal homecoming be possible without the anticipatory arrangements of a Heavenly Mother?&quot;

In the 1970s and 1980s church members began to write speculations about a Heavenly Mother and even to pray to her in meetings. In the 1980s and 1990s the church stopped these practices. There were publications made in &quot;Dialogue&quot; during this time period that suggested that Heavenly Mother is the Holy Ghost. In 2015 an essay was published in &quot;The Gospel Topics&quot; section of the church&#x27;s website, which surveyed 171 years of statements about a Mother in Heaven.

===Eve===

Mormonism rejected the Augustinian doctrine of original sin, which held that humanity inherits the sin of Adam and Eve in which they ate the forbidden fruit. This sin was historically blamed on Eve, and was thought to be the source of women&#x27;s submissive and dependent state. The movement&#x27;s second Article of Faith states, &quot;We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam&#x27;s transgression.&quot;

==Civil rights==
===Reproductive rights===

The LDS Church opposes elective abortion based on a belief in the &quot;sanctity of human life&quot;. The church allows members to abort pregnancies in some rare circumstances. According to an official statement, &quot;The Church allows for possible exceptions for its members when: Pregnancy results from rape or incest, or a competent physician determines that the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy, or a competent physician determines that the fetus has severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth.&quot; The statement goes on to say, &quot;Abortion is a most serious matter and should be considered only after the persons involved have consulted with their local church leaders and feel through personal prayer that their decision is correct.&quot; The statement also clarifies that the LDS church does not favor or oppose specific legislation or public demonstrations concerning abortion.

In the past the use of birth control methods including artificial contraception was explicitly condemned by LDS Church leaders. Beginning in July 1916, apostles were quoted stating that birth control was a &quot;pernicious doctrine&quot; and that &quot;limiting the number of children in a family...is sinful&quot;. As recently as 2003 a church manual was published containing a quote from the late church president Spencer W. Kimball stating that the church does not &quot;condone nor approve of&quot; measures of contraception which greatly &quot;limit the family&quot;. The current church stance is that &quot;decisions about birth control and the consequences of those decisions rest solely with each married couple&quot; and that they should consider &quot;the physical and mental health of the mother and father and their capacity to provide the basic necessities of life for their children&quot; when planning a family. The church &quot;strongly discourages&quot; surgical sterilization like vasectomies and tubal ligation and encourages members to only turn to it for serious medical conditions after discussing it with a bishop. The church&#x27;s insurance company Deseret Mutual Benefits Administrators which provides coverage for its employees does not cover any form of birth control and will only cover sterilization by vasectomy or tubal ligation for a couple if the woman has already had five children or is over forty.

===Equal Rights Amendment===
According to historian Ardis Parshall, in 1943, women within positions of leadership in the LDS Church backed the amendment.

In the 1970s, the LDS Church came out against the Equal Rights Amendment. The LDS Church in Utah requested that ten women from each ward attend the Utah International Women&#x27;s Year in 1977 to support the church&#x27;s position on the Equal Rights Amendment and other women&#x27;s issues. The fourteen thousand attendees, mostly Latter-day Saint women recruited in their wards, voted on platforms before hearing their discussion and rejected all the national resolutions—even those that did not advocate a moral position opposed to that of the LDS Church. In 1978, the LDS church encouraged nine thousand female members in greater Las Vegas, Nevada, to canvass their neighborhoods with anti–Equal Rights Amendment pamphlets and encouraged all members to vote. Nevada did not ratify the amendment. Sonia Johnson fought against the church in support of the Equal Rights Amendment and was excommunicated; a December 1979 excommunication letter claimed that Johnson was charged with a variety of misdeeds, including hindering the worldwide missionary program, damaging internal Mormon social programs, and teaching false doctrine. Also in 1979, the Alice Reynolds forum was forbidden from discussing the amendment in the Alice Reynolds reading room at Brigham Young University; the club subsequently found a different place to meet.

==Dissent==
Within and outside the church mainstream, there is a minority of LDS women who raise concerns regarding church policy and doctrine. However, any members who are viewed as publicly oppositional toward the church&#x27;s current structure are subject to ecclesiastical discipline, including excommunication for apostasy.

==20th and 21st centuries changes in church policies about women==
The First Presidency made the Relief Society an auxiliary to the church, removing their independent financial status in 1970. In 1977, First Presidency member N. Eldon Tanner told a meeting of church leaders that presidency of the Relief Society should be considered a partner with the Melchizedek priesthood.

Other developments during the presidency of Spencer W. Kimball included having young women class advancements recognized in sacrament meeting and, in 1978, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles issued a policy which approved of women praying in sacrament meeting. Women had been barred praying in sacrament meeting from 1967 to 1978. In 1980, the general presidents of the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary were invited to sit on the stand with the male general authorities during general conference. In 1984, a woman spoke in general conference for the first time since 1931; since then, women have spoken in every general conference. In 1978, a conference session specifically for women was added, initially two weeks before the October general conference, which was later changed to one week beforehand, then to Conference Weekend itself in 2018. In the April 2013 general conference, women gave prayers for the first time.

In 1978, a policy that a woman was not allowed to be a Sunday School president was clarified to a bishop in a Boston suburb. Also in 1978, Alice Colton Smith, a member of the Relief Society General Board, remarked in a letter to Leonard J. Arrington that women were once permitted to join in or stand as an observer at the blessing of her baby, but now were rarely permitted to do so. In 1975, the LDS church allowed Maureen Ursenbach Beecher to continue to work in the History Division after the birth of her daughter. Previously, the church&#x27;s policy was to terminate new mothers&#x27; employment; after consulting with their legal counsel, the church changed their policy to allow women employees to continue working after several weeks of maternity leave.

Brigham Young University (BYU), the LDS Church&#x27;s flagship educational institution, has made several changes in its policy towards women. In 1975, the four-year, full tuition and boarding expenses presidential scholarship was changed from only being available to men to being available to an equal number of men and women. BYU established a Women&#x27;s Research Institute in 1978. Among its directors over its 21 years of existence was Marie Cornwall. At the end of 2009, BYU restructured its Women&#x27;s Studies Programs, freeing more money for research on women&#x27;s issues by ending an institute staff, placing the Women&#x27;s Studies Minor in the Sociology Department and thus putting all the money that had been split between research and staff directly into research expenditures.

In 2013, the church adjusted the leadership council in its missions to include a greater role for the wife of the mission president and by creating a new role, called &quot;sister training leader&quot;. The new Mission Leadership Council expands the use of councils to govern the church at every level. Also in 2013, the organization Ordain Women was established by LDS women who supported the extension of priesthood ordinations to women. On November 1, 2013, the church announced that beginning in 2014, a general women&#x27;s meeting, conducted by the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary organizations, would be held in connection with its bi-annual general conferences. In 2015, the church appointed women to its executive councils for the first time: Linda K. Burton, president of the Relief Society, Rosemary Wixom, president of the Primary, and Bonnie L. Oscarson, president of the Young Women&#x27;s organization, to three high-level church councils (one woman to each).

==Mormon feminism==

Mormon feminism is a feminist movement concerned with the role of women within Mormonism. Mormon feminists advocate for a more significant recognition of Heavenly Mother, the ordination of women, gender equality, and social justice grounded in Mormon theology and history. The modern form of the movement has roots that go back to the founding of Mormonism, including the largely independent operation of the female Relief Society, priesthood blessings by women in early church history, and the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in the western United States.

==Fundamentalist groups==
Mormon fundamentalists are groups or individuals who have broken from the dominant form of Mormonism practiced by the LDS Church. Since the mid-19th century, numerous fundamentalist sects have been established, many of which are located in small, cohesive, and isolated communities in areas of the Western United States, western Canada, and Mexico. Mormon fundamentalists advocate a return to Mormon doctrines and practices which, they believe, were wrongly abandoned, such as plural marriage, the law of consecration, the Adam–God doctrine, the Patriarchal Priesthood, elements of the Mormon endowment ritual, and often the exclusion of blacks from the priesthood.

Plural marriage is generally considered the most central and significant doctrine separating fundamentalists from mainstream Mormonism. In Mormon fundamentalist groups, women are typically expected or encouraged to adhere to a strongly patriarchal perspective on women&#x27;s roles and activities and, in many cases, participate in plural marriage.

Even though women in fundamentalist groups are often expected to rear children and other domestic tasks, it is not accurate to assume that all women in polygamous relationships in Mormon fundamentalist groups are powerless. Mormon women in fundamentalist groups experience their gender roles differently than women in the LDS church. In fundamentalists sects, sex is viewed as a necessary evil for reproduction. Women who are menstruating, lactating, or pregnant are not expected to have sex with their husbands. One fundamentalist woman said that because her husband had other wives, she didn&#x27;t feel pressured to sexually satisfy her husband. Fundamentalist women help their husbands seek other wives, and many say that for their husbands to look for a wife without consulting existing wives would be akin to infidelity. Some wives in polygamous marriages feel closer to their sister wives than to their husbands. In some polygamous relationships, a wife nurtures her husband&#x27;s relationship with his other wives by encouraging her husband to spend time with them. Sister wives help each other with childrearing, cooking, and other domestic tasks. Women in polygamous relationships have their own bedrooms, while their husbands are treated as visitors. Sister wives also often control the household&#x27;s finances. The studies that examined the experience of fundamentalist women did not examine underage marriage, which the authors felt was a separate issue. The 2008 police raid of the FLDS Texas compound found that 12 girls were married before age 16 and sexually abused.

<doc id="608433" wikidata="Q3015605" url="?curid=608433" title="Somatotropic cell">
<text>Somatropic cells (somatotropes) (from the Greek &quot;sōmat&quot; meaning &quot;body&quot; and &quot;tropikós&quot; meaning &quot;of or pertaining to a turn or change&quot;) are cells in the anterior pituitary that produce growth hormone.

==Structure==
Somatotropic cells constitute about 30−40% of anterior pituitary cells. They release growth hormone (GH) in response to growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH, or somatocrinin) or are inhibited by GHIH (somatostatin), both received from the hypothalamus via the hypophyseal portal system vein and the secondary plexus.

==Clinical significance==
===Hormone deficiency===

When levels of somatotropin are low in the body, a physician may prescribe human growth hormone as a drug.

Deficiency in somatotrope secretion before puberty or before the end of new bone tissue growth, can lead to pituitary dwarfism. When growth hormone is deficient, blood sugar is low because insulin is not opposed by normal amount of growth hormone.

===Hormone excess===
If there is an excess of growth hormone, it is usually because of over-secretion of somatotrope cells in the anterior pituitary gland. A significant amount of excess somatotrope secretion before puberty or before the end of new bone tissue growth can lead to gigantism, a disease that causes excess growth of body (e.g. being over 7 ft. tall) and unusually long limbs. An excess of secretion of growth hormone after puberty can lead to acromegaly. This is a disease that causes abnormal growth in the hands, head, jaw, and tongue. Some symptoms associated with acromegaly include heavy sweating, oily skin, improper processing of sugars in the diet (diabetes), high blood pressure, increased calcium in urine and swelling of the thyroid gland and arthritis.

==Other animals==
Bovine somatotropin occurs in the pituitary of cattle and differs in structure from human pituitary growth hormone and is biologically inactive in the human being. Bovine somatotropin aids in regulating the amount of milk produced. Recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST) is a hormone that is injected in cows that increases milk production.

<doc id="608434" wikidata="Q3016161" url="?curid=608434" title="Prolactin cell">
<text>A prolactin cell (also known as a lactotropic cell, epsilon acidophil, lactotrope, lactotroph, mammatroph, mammotroph) is a cell in the anterior pituitary which produces prolactin (a peptide hormone) in response to hormonal signals including dopamine (which is inhibitory), thyrotropin-releasing hormone and estrogen (especially during pregnancy), which are stimulatory. Prolactin is responsible for actions needed for body homeostasis, the development of breasts, and for lactation. The inhibitory effects of dopamine override the stimulatory effects of TRH in non-pregnant, non-lactating sexually mature females. Depending on the sex of the individual, prolactin cells account for 20% - 50% of all cells in the anterior pituitary gland. The inhibitory effects of dopamine override the stimulatory effects of TRH in non-pregnant, non-lactating sexually mature females. Other regulators include oxytocin and progesterone.

Males and non-pregnant, non-lactating females typically have low levels of prolactin. The number for prolactin cells in a pregnant female will increase to allow for breast tissue development. Prolactin is involved in the maturation of mammary glands and their secretion of milk in association with oxytocin, estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoids, and others. Prolactin has numerous other effects in both sexes.

== Function ==
When prolactin cells are observed in vitro, they are responsible for firing spontaneous action potentials, causing Ca2+ to follow the action potential pathway and allows for the exocytotic pathway, prolactin gene transcription, and hormone synthesis to remain active throughout. Prolactin gene transcription is responsible for the production of prolactin.

Prolactin is involved in the maturation of mammary glands and their secretion of milk in association with oxytocin, estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoids, and others. Prolactin has numerous other effects in both sexes.

=== Conditions ===
Prolactin cells are acidophilic by hematoxylin &amp; eosin stains and, If these cells undergo neoplastic transformation, they will give rise to a prolactinoma, a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma.

Prolactinoma is a tumor of the pituitary gland that is typically non-cancerous. This disorder is more common in females than males. Although the tumor itself may not cause symptoms, the tumor can cause an increased production of prolactin and decreased levels of estrogen and testosterone.

Symptoms of both sexes could include osteoporosis, infertility, or a decrease in sexual desire.

In men, prolactinoma could also cause erectile dysfunction, enlarged breast tissue, small muscles or a decrease in the amount of body hair. In women, this could cause breast discharge, irregular menstrual cycles, painful intercourse, acne, or an increase in the amount of body hair.

<doc id="608437" wikidata="Q3304865" url="?curid=608437" title="Thyrotropic cell">
<text>== Overview ==
Thyrotropic cells (also called thyrotropes, or thyrotrophs) are endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary which produce thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, or thyrotropin, triggers the release of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) from the thyroid gland. Thyrotropes comprise around 5% of the anterior pituitary lobe cells. 
=== Visualization ===
Thyrotropes appear basophilic in histological preparations. In the image displayed on the right, thyrotropes are the cells with the bluish-purple cytoplasm and the dark purple nucleus. Normal morphology of these cells is characterized by a round shape. However, these cells are best displayed under light microscopy performed following immunohistochemistry with TSH. This specific type of imaging allows for the visualization of the location of thyrotrophs in the anterior pituitary gland. Thyrotropic cells are clustered together in the anteromedial region of the gland.

=== Development ===
Thyrotrophs can be identified via immunocytochemistry as early as the 12th week of fetal development, roughly at the same time that gonadotrophs can be detected. The active hormone, TSH, is detected at the 14th week of gestation. Transcription factors, such as Pit-1, GATA-2, and PROP1, influence cell proliferation and maturation.

== Mechanisms of Stimulation and Secretion ==

=== Effect of TRH Signaling ===
The hypothalamus secretes thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) into portal veins, which carry this hormone to the anterior pituitary. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone is a relatively small peptide, containing only three amino acids. TRH stimulates the thyrotropic cells through the use of a phospholipase C second messenger system. TRH binds to a class A G protein-coupled receptor on the surface of a thyrotropic cell, which is known as the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR). Strong hydrogen bonding interactions stabilize the binding of TRH to TRHR. This binding event induces the coupling of Gαq/G11, which activates phospholipase C. Phospholipase C cleaves PIP2 into IP3. Inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) binds to calcium channels along the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum causing a conformational change, which opens the channels and subsequently releases Ca2+ ions into the cytosol of the thyrotrophs.

=== Biosynthesis of Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) ===
TSH consists of noncovalently associated subunits: an α-subunit that is conserved in other pituitary hormones and a β-subunit that gives the hormone its specificity. These subunits are synthesized from different genes. These subunits are transcribed in response to the signaling of TRH. The direct pathway from the release of calcium ions to the expression of these genes in thyrotropic cells is unknown. The subunits are glycosylated and remodeled as they move through the cell. Further glycosylation of the subunits occurs as they progress through the secretory pathway. Thyroid stimulating hormone is stored in the secretory granules of thyrotropic cells. Release of these granules is also induced by the signaling of TRH.

=== Effect of Stimuli on the Release of TSH ===
Multiple neurogenic stimuli are known to affect the release of TSH from thyrotropes. Exposure to cold temperatures increases the secretion of TSH. This increased secretion results from the increased secretion of TRH, as the hypothalamus is excited by the change in body temperature. Furthermore, emotions that activate the sympathetic nervous system—such as excitement and anxiety—decrease the secretion of TSH. The decrease in secretion is also connected to the change in body temperature. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system increases the body temperature, which then causes a decrease in TRH secretion and the subsequent decrease in TSH secretion.

Thyroid hormones can have a direct inhibitory effect on thyrotropic cells, though the exact mechanism is unknown. At elevated levels of thyroxine, the rate of secretion of TSH decreases to near zero, as the body tries to maintain a relatively constant level of thyroid hormone in circulation. However, the inhibitory effect of thyroid hormones may decrease in thyrotropic tumor cells. The receptor affinity for T3 significantly decreases for thyrotropic tumor cells in culture when compared to healthy thyrotropes, which reduces the regulatory effect.

In addition, during pregnancy, the size of the pituitary gland increases, and consequently, the expression of TSH also increases. This increase in secretion of TSH likely results from the additional metabolic load that pregnant mothers experience in combination with the secretion of placental hormones.

GLP-1 can also impact the secretion of TSH, though the exact mechanism is unknown. The presence of high affinity binding sites for GLP-1 was recently discovered in the thyrotropic cells of rodents. Understanding this pathway can help the formulation of treatments for type II diabetes mellitus, as there exists a strong association between metabolic diseases and thyroid dysfunction.

== Pathologies associated with Thyrotropic Cells ==

=== Thyrotroph Adenomas ===

This image shows the histology of a thyrotroph tumor. These thyrotroph tumors are referred to as thyrotroph adenomas, and are very rare. They typically present as functional macroadenomas and generally appear in individuals in their 50s. Thyrotroph adenomas are not well understood as they only comprise roughly 1% of all pituitary tumors. These tumors typically result in increased secretion of TSH. Individuals with thyrotroph adenomas typically have hyperthyroidism and diffuse goitre. Diffuse goitre refers to the elongated enlargement of the thyroid gland that results from the increased expression of TSH.

In histological staining, the thyrotropic cells appear more elongated and spindle shaped and are regularly accompanied by fibrosis.

The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies pituitary tumors based on their transcription factors and hormones, as these factors provide insight into the cell lineage and purpose. Thyrotropic adenomas are identified as having the transcription factors, Pit-1, TEF, and GATA-2, and the hormones, β-TSH and α-subunit. Pit-1, in combination with thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF), contributes to a cell&#x27;s differentiation into a thyrotroph and helps stimulate the production of β-TSH. GATA-2 is a transcription factor for cells that belong to the &quot;Lhx&quot; gene family. The heterodimer formation between the α-subunit and β-TSH is critical to TSH secretion. Disruption of the α-subunit gene results in a lack of TSH secretion, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of thyrotrophs, and decreased quantities of somatotrophs and lactotrophs.

The molecular mechanism behind the formation of these tumors is not well understood, likely due to their low prevalence. Currently, no mutations have been identified in association with thyrotroph adenomas.

In the presence of other pituitary tumors, the thyrotropic cells are unaffected.

=== Other Conditions ===
In individuals with primary hyperthyroidism, treatment via thyroid hormone therapy can reverse the hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the thyrotrophs.

Individuals with a rare form of dwarfism characterized by hypothyroidism lack thyrotropic cells altogether, as this syndrome results from a mutation in the Pit-1 gene.

Excess iodine present in individuals with Graves’ Disease can induce thyrotoxicosis, which is the overexpression of thyroid hormone. Sudden overexpression of the thyroid hormone is referred to as thyroid storm. Thyroid storm results in substantial decreases in the amount of thyrotropic cells in the pituitary gland. This decrease, if significant enough, can be fatal. However, with treatment, this decrease in the number of thyrotrophs can be reversed.

<text>== 1. Introduction ==
Gonadotropic cells (also known as gonadotropes, gonadotrophs, delta cells, or delta basophils) are endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary that produce gonadotropins. More specifically, gonadotrophs produce and secrete glycoprotein polypeptide hormones, such as the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are released due to the positive input of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). These gonadotropins are essential in the development and maintenance of reproductive function in mammals. This control of the reproductive system is coordinated by the electrical activity and signaling pathways of gonadotrophs as well as the tight regulation of gonadotropic cells by both sex steroids and paracrine factors.

== 2. Formation and Morphology ==
During embryonic development, the anterior and posterior pituitary merge due to regulated cell-to-cell interactions, signaling pathways, and numerous transcription factors. Of the pituitary endocrine cells, the gonadotropic cells are the last to form and become functional. It has been found through studies with zebrafish that glycoprotein 𝞪-subunit (&quot;gpa&quot;) and thyroid-stimulating hormone beta (&quot;tshb&quot;) expressing cells are precursors for gonadotropes and thyrotropes. Even further, the genes involved in the final differentiation of these precursors into gonadotropes are sine oculus 1 (&quot;six1&quot;), eyes absent homolog 1 (&quot;eya1&quot;), steroidogenic factor 1 (&quot;sf1&quot;), and paired-like homeodomain 1 (&quot;pitx1&quot;).

Once gonadotropes are fully developed and functional, these cells compose approximately 15-20% of the anterior pituitary, and gonadotropic cells are larger than other cells of the anterior lobe. Gonadotropes are usually near capillaries and in close proximity to lactotrophs, which suggests a possible paracrine interaction between the two pituitary endocrine cells. In electron micrographs of gonadotropic cells, the rough endoplasmic reticulum is prominent and forms dilated stacks, and the Golgi apparatus are also clearly visible. Cytoplasmic granules within gonadotropic cells are responsible for producing FSH and LH. In most gonadotrophs, the cytoplasm contains both FSH and LH, but there are some gonadotrophs that contain only one of the two hormones. Therefore, there are two different granule populations in gonadotropes, one type being 150-250 nm in diameter and the other being 350-450 nm in diameter. Gonadotropes are usually described as globular and basophilic due to the cells’ ability to absorb dyes that appear blue or purple under the microscope due to the cytoplasmic granules that have a high affinity for basic stains.

== 3. Electrical Activity and Signaling Pathway ==
 Gonadotrophs contain numerous voltage-gated sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), and chloride (Cl) channels in the plasma membrane, and these channels account for spontaneous and receptor-controlled electrical and Ca2+ signaling. The presence of these voltage-gated channels makes gonadotrophs electrically excitable cells, meaning the cells are capable of propagating action potentials either spontaneously or by stimulation. The resting membrane potential of gonadotrophs is generally -60 to -50 mV, but when depolarization of the plasma membrane surpasses the threshold voltage, the gonadotrophs fire tall and narrow action potentials with amplitudes of more than 60 mV. This electrical activity of gonadotrophs differs from other pituitary cells because other cell types usually exhibit periodic depolarized potentials with smaller amplitude peaks. In gonadotrophs, the sodium ion channels work simultaneously with calcium ion channels to propagate these action potentials, or calcium channels can be solely responsible for the depolarization of gonadotrophs.

One factor that has an important effect on this electrical activity of gonadotrophs is the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH is a hormone released by the hypothalamus, and it is responsible for signaling gonadotrophs to release gonadotropins FSH and LH. GnRH binds to gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors (GnRHR), which is a G-protein coupled receptor, and signals the oscillation of calcium that hyperpolarizes gonadotropic cell membranes. This oscillation of calcium ions occurs through the resultant signaling cascade of the GnRH binding to the GnRHR in the plasma membrane of the gonadotroph. The G-protein associated with the GnRHR is activated by the binding of GnRH, which results in increased phospholipase C (PLC) activity in the plasma membrane. PLC cleaves phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biophosphate (PIP2) into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) signals. DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), which phosphorylates proteins, and IP3 binds to IP3 receptors on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This binding results in the release of intracellular calcium ions stored within the ER. Therefore, this increase in calcium ions signals the synthesis of secretion of FSH and LH in gonadotrophs. Overall, the fluctuation of calcium levels that is activated by the electrical activity and the signaling pathway within gonadotropic cells collectively contribute to the synthesis and release of gonadotropins that will serve an endocrine function in the reproductive system. 

== 4. Endocrine Function ==

The endocrine function of gonadotrophs is derived from the effect of gonadotropins on the reproductive system. The gonadotropins produced by gonadotropic cells are FSH and LH, which are dimeric pituitary glycoprotein hormones with a common alpha subunit and distinct beta subunit that confers biological activity of the hormones. These hormones are synthesized in the ER of gonadotropic cells and then passed through the Golgi apparatus. After modification and packaging within the Golgi complex, the hormones are delivered to the plasma membrane through constitutive or regulated secretory pathways. The regulated pathway involves the fusion of the secretory vesicles containing FSH and LH to the gonadotroph membrane, and the vesicle is arrested waiting for specific signals, such as increased calcium levels from electrical activity and signaling pathways, that activate secretion of the hormones. The gonadotropins FSH and LH regulate the development of follicles, also known as folliculogenesis, in females, and the development of sperm in males. More specifically, the released FSH acts on ovarian granulosa and testicular Sertoli cells, while LH acts on ovarian theca and testicular Leydig cells. The release of these hormones are directly signaled by the pulsing secretion of GnRH. For example, the low frequency GnRH pulses lead to the release of FSH and the high-frequency of GnRH pulses lead to the release of LH. Therefore, the controlled release of FSH and LH from gonadotrophs allows for precise control of gonadal function.

== 5. Regulation of Gonadotropic Cells ==
 Gonadotroph release of gonadotropins is highly regulated and fluctuates with physiological conditions. For example, in the presence of gonadotropins, ovaries produce and secrete the hormone estradiol. Increased levels of estradiol regulate the surge in LH levels through a negative feedback mechanism during the mid-cycle of the menstrual cycle. This indicates that LH released from gonadotrophs stimulates the production of estradiol; however, when there is a drastic increase in estradiol production, estradiol will regulate LH production by preventing gonadotrophs from releasing more LH until estradiol is needed again. In males, LH stimulates the production of testosterone by Leydig cells in testis and FSH controls spermatogenesis. Testosterone will also provide negative feedback to gonadotrophs and regulate its own production by acting on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. The negative feedback provided by these sex steroids (estradiol and testosterone) lead to the inhibition of hypothalamic secretion of GnRH, which consequently will inhibit the release of LH from gonadotropic cells. FSH is selectively inhibited by paracrine factors, such as inhibin. Inhibin A is secreted from ovarian granulosa cells in females, and inhibin B is secreted by testicular Sertoli cells in males. Similar to the negative feedback of the sex steroids, the inhibin will provide feedback to the pituitary gonadotrophs to reduce secretion of FSH by inhibiting GnRH from activating the release of gonadotropins. The integration of different regulatory signals by gonadotropes results in the coordinated control of production and secretion of gonadotropins to respond and control sexual maturation and reproductive functions.

<doc id="608439" wikidata="Q5173293" url="?curid=608439" title="Corticotropic cell">
<text>Corticotropic cells, (corticotropes or corticotrophs) are basophilic cells in the anterior pituitary that produce pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) which undergoes cleavage to adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), β-lipotropin (β-LPH), and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). These cells are stimulated by corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and make up 15–20% of the cells in the anterior pituitary. The release of ACTH from the corticotropic cells is controlled by CRH, which is formed in the cell bodies of parvocellular neurosecretory cells within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and passes to the corticotropes in the anterior pituitary via the hypophyseal portal system. Adrenocorticotropin hormone stimulates the adrenal cortex to release glucocorticoids and plays an important role in the stress response.

== Function ==

The primary function of the corticotropic cells is to produce the prohormone POMC in response to the release of CRH from the hypothalamus. POMC is cleaved into several peptide hormones via enzyme activity. In addition to synthesis in the corticotropes, POMC is also synthesized in melanotroph cells, the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and melanocytes. POMC undergoes differential cleavage into various peptide hormones depending on the cell it is synthesized in; it also varies based on species. POMC in the corticotropes of humans is proteolytically cleaved by proprotein convertases into ACTH and β-lipotropin. In rats, however, the ACTH is further cleaved into α-MSH and CLIP in the corticotrope. These peptide hormones are stored within vesicles in the corticotropic cells and are released in response to CRH stimulation from the hypothalamus. These vesicles then leave the anterior pituitary and travel throughout the body via the bloodstream to reach their target tissues. 
== Role in the Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal Axis ==
=== Stimulation ===
Corticotropic cells serve an important role within the feedback loop of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and the stress response. Corticotropes produce and release ACTH, a 39 amino acid peptide hormone, in response to corticotropic releasing hormone (CRH) release from the hypothalamus. CRH is a 41-amino-acid peptide hormone that is secreted by the parvocellular neurosecretory cells, which are found within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.

Stimuli for the release of CRH from the hypothalamus include:

*Forskolin
*Interleukin-6
*Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP)
*Stress or trauma
*Circadian rhythms

Forskolin and PACAP regulate the synthesis of CRH in the hypothalamus by binding to G protein-coupled receptors and stimulating and increase in cAMP within the cells via the action of adenylate cyclase. This activates the protein kinase A pathway, which results in the binding of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) onto the CRH promoter region and induces transcription of CRH. This process is repressed by glucocorticoids; this inhibitory feedback helps maintain homeostasis of the stress response.

Once released by the hypothalamus, CRH travels through the hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary, where it binds to G protein-coupled receptors on the corticotropic cell membrane and stimulates cAMP production. The effects of CRH on pituitary corticotropes are potentiated by vasopressin (AVP); AVP is a weak inducer of ACTH production on its own, but has a strong synergistic effect on ACTH production when CRH is also bound to the receptor. These signaling hormones act via signal transduction, causing the synthesis of POMC and eventual cleavage to ACTH and β-lipotropin. These peptide hormones are then released into the bloodstream, where they circulate and act on target tissues.

=== Function ===
ACTH released from the corticotropes binds to G protein-coupled receptors in the adrenal cortex, where it stimulates the production of glucocorticoids (primarily cortisol). ACTH binds to the melanocortin 2 receptor and, through signal transduction, increases levels of cholesterol esterase, the transport of cholesterol across the mitochondrial membrane, cholesterol binding to P450SCC and, an increase in pregnenolone synthesis. It also serves as a secondary stimulus for the synthesis of mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone, which serve an important role in regulating the salt balance of the blood. Glucocorticoids released by the adrenal cortex inhibit production of CRH and ACTH, forming a negative feedback loop.

=== Inhibition of ACTH production ===
Corticotropes contain glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG, or transcortin). GR is a nuclear receptor that inhibits transcription of ACTH via a negative glucocorticoid recognition element (GRE) that binds cortisol on POMC DNA, but generally transcortin binds glucocorticoids (including cortisol, cortisone, deoxycortisone, and aldosterone) with high affinity and prevents this inhibition. Tonic inhibition of corticotropes requires high concentrations of glucocorticoids, exceeding CBG capacity. This causes ACTH secretion to be vulnerable to inhibition in patients taking glucocorticoids for medical purposes such as treatment of autoimmune disease or as an anti-transplant-rejection medication.

== Associated diseases ==

=== Cushing&#x27;s Disease ===
Corticotropic cells can have detrimental effects on the body if they express too much or too little ACTH. One such example is Cushing&#x27;s disease, which can result from overproduction of ACTH in the corticotropes due to pituitary tumors known as corticotroph adenomas; this is the cause for roughly two-thirds of those diagnosed with Cushing&#x27;s disease. It is also possible that this disease can result from production of ACTH in a non-pituitary tumor, known as ectopic production, or the adrenal glands can overproduce cortisol due to an adrenal tumor. This overproduction of ACTH causes an increase in cortisol levels due to increased glucocorticoid synthesis in the adrenal cortex resulting in several associated symptoms.

Symptoms of Cushing&#x27;s disease include:

* Fatty deposits in the neck or back
* Stretch marks (striae)
* Fatigue
* Osteoporosis
* Weakened immune system
* Hypertension

=== Addison&#x27;s Disease ===
Corticotropic cells can also be the cause of Addison&#x27;s disease in some instances. Addison&#x27;s disease is characterized adrenal insufficiency, which is defined as the underproduction of glucocorticoids by the adrenal cortex. If the corticotropes underproduce ACTH this can result in secondary adrenal insufficiency, causing the adrenal glands to underproduce cortisol. This can be caused by tumors of the anterior pituitary or hypothalamus, inflammation, or surgery. This ultimately results in the underproduction of cortisol, which has many detrimental symptoms.

Symptoms of Addison&#x27;s disease include:

* Weight loss
* Hypoglycemia
* Hypotension
* Irritability

<text>The Sukhoi Su-80 (formerly known as the Sukhoi S-80) is a Russian twin-turboprop, twin-boom STOL transport aircraft.

==Design and development==
The Su-80 program was supposed to start in the late 1990s, but due to lack of funds, it was postponed for several years. A prototype of the combined Freight/Passenger Su-80GP was built and its first flight was planned for early 1998, but the program was delayed again. The first flight of the prototype was at the 2001 MAKS in Moscow issued Zhukovsky.

On 4 September 2001, Igor Wotinzew started with the prototype, 82911, on his first flight. In early 2006, the Su-80 entered production in the KnAAPO factory in Komsomolsk-on-Amur.

The first model of the turboprop transporter Sukhoi S-80 was shown at the 46th Paris International Air and Space Show, 2005. The plane is being developed by Sukhoi OKB and the aircraft factory in Komsomolsk/Amur under the &quot;konversija&quot; program. The aircraft is intended to replace the An-24/26, An-28 and Yak-40, and to compete with the Antonov An-38 . The design of the machine is very similar to the Scaled Composites ATTT and the Rockwell OV-10. It has three lift-generating surfaces: the primary wings; two fins at the rear of the fuselage which join the booms to the fuselage; and the horizontal stabilizer which joins the two vertical fins at the rear of the booms. Two General Electric CT7-9B turboprop engines are housed in bays at the front of the tail booms.

The sleek hull offers space for 30 passengers, and a &quot;beaver-tail&quot; cargo ramp is fitted at the rear of the fuselage, which allows for easy loading and unloading of cargo.

==Operational history==
 Eight aircraft from the second production (first definitive) batch were earmarked for delivery to customers.

===Commercial orders===
Blagoveshchensk Airlines, Chukotavia, Dalavia, the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky Air Enterprise, and Polar Airlines all signed preliminary agreements to acquire the type. The KnAAPO factory airline was expected to be the Su-80&#x27;s first operator.

===Military orders===
The Kazakhstan Border Guards tentatively ordered ten Su-80s, while the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force, Jordanian Air Force, Royal Malaysian Air Force, Indonesian Air Force and Republic of Korea Air Force all expressed interest.

Ultimately, no aircraft performed active service. In 2022, it does not appear that any of these aircraft are operational.

==Variants==
There are two different models of the Su-80. The four pre-series aircraft were of a short-fuselage design, while the fifth, sixth and seventh prototypes were stretched by 1.4 m (4 ft 7 in) allowing an extra row of passenger seats.
; S-80PC (Su-80GP) : Combination Passenger and Freight carrier

<text>Enigma was a musical project by British producer and musician Nigel Wright in the early 1980s. The recordings were by session musicians and singers who performed medleys of popular disco tracks. In 1981, the singles &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Stopping&quot; and &quot;I Love Music&quot; reached #11 and #25 on the UK Singles Chart, respectively. They also released an album, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Stoppin″&quot;, which reached #80 on the UK Albums Chart in September 1981. Their releases were under the Creole Records label.

Band members were Tino Rowe (vocals), Martin Jay (vocals and guitar), Jill Saward (vocals), Tracy Ackerman (as Tracy Lee Ackerman) (vocals), and Steve Underwood (bass guitar). Saward, Ackerman and Underwood all had associations with the band Shakatak, of which Wright was a member.

In 1987, Wright released one more single under this name before embarking on another remix project under the name Mirage, which also scored a few hits over a brief period.

<doc id="608461" wikidata="Q5155038" url="?curid=608461" title="Community politics">
<text>Community politics is a movement in British politics to re-engage people with political action on a local level.

Most developed amongst the Liberal Democrats but adopted to some extent by the British Greens, other parties, and Independents. An early example cited is the victory of Michael Meadowcroft in Leeds West, a traditionally safe Labour seat, in the 1983 general election.

Community politics is based on small-scale action on local political issues. To give an example of how it works: Residents are irritated by rubbish dumped by a playing field. A &#x27;non-community&#x27; political response would be to issue a statement calling for more resources to be allocated to deal with dumped rubbish. A &#x27;community politics&#x27; response would be for local councillors to lead a group of people to clear the rubbish themselves, then inform the local community through a newsletter.

The result is a stronger local community who feel that their representatives are achieving something, and a better chance of even the most under-resourced local authority taking the time to stop the problem in future.

The low-budget techniques are easy to adopt. No television advertising, mass direct mailing or contacts with national newspapers are necessary.

Community politics principles can be applied to any area and by any party. The keys are local action on residents&#x27; concerns and effective communication with local residents through newsletters and face-to-face contact. Parties which espouse community politics often meet with electoral success (e.g. the Liberal Democrats&#x27; ability to break out of the third-party trap), particularly in areas which have been dominated by one political party. In Letchworth Garden City local residents, disenchanted by local politics and the local establishment, petitioned for their own town council and elected all 24 members as independents. (All the seats had been contested by the main political parties).

== National and local initiatives ==

Concern at disengagement with local politics in the UK—manifested, not least, by low turnout in local elections - has led to a series of initiatives aimed at making it easier for people to become involved in local decision-making. Their success is debatable. Notable national initiatives include changes to electoral systems to allow universal postal voting on a trial basis, and the process introduced in the Local Government Act 2000 by which the public can, via petition, call for a referendum on whether there should be a local elected mayor. National regeneration funding streams, such as New Deal for Communities, require community leadership as part of their governance arrangements. At a local level, many local authorities have established &quot;area&quot;, &quot;ward&quot; or &quot;neighbourhood&quot; committees and such like to consider more local, community based issues, sometimes with devolved budgets. The requirement placed on each local authority in England and Wales to create a Local Strategic Partnership is also intended to facilitate greater community involvement. There is also ongoing reform of the mechanisms for public and patient involvement in health issues. The Police and Justice Act 2006 and the 2006 local government white paper include processes for &quot;Community Calls for Action&quot;, setting out statutory mechanisms by which local residents can formally bring issues of concern to the attention of their local authority and other public sector organisations.

In May 2016, she was sworn in as the Mayor of Islington, having served as a councillor of the borough&#x27;s St George&#x27;s Ward since 2013. She was previously president of the National Union of Students, between 2004 and 2006, the first to be elected from a political slate to the left of Labour Students.

==Early life==
Born in Sheffield, Fletcher was the General Secretary of Sheffield College&#x27;s students&#x27; union, where she joined the Campaign for Free Education (CFE) and the Alliance for Workers&#x27; Liberty, a small Trotskyist group. She later attended the University of Leeds where she studied Social Policy and Education. After studying for two years, she was elected as the NUS National Women&#x27;s Officer, and subsequently to the NUS Block of Twelve part-time officers. She then returned to Leeds, graduating in 2004.

==NUS President==
She was elected president in 2004 in an extremely close contest, which she won by only two votes after six rounds of transfers, having lost the 2003 election by only three votes to the incumbent candidate. Although a long-standing member of the Labour Party, she ran on a leftist platform as a member of the Campaign for Free Education (CFE) criticising the NUS proximity to Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour government, particularly on the issue of tuition fees. After being elected she pushed through a process of NUS reform which she claimed was necessary to save the organisation from financial crisis.

She left the AWL before being elected president; during her first year in office, she disbanded CFE, as a result of reinstating free education policy. It was at this point that the AWL and other left-wing activists such as the CFE&#x27;s successor organisation Education Not for Sale came into sharp opposition to her.

In 2005, she stood for re-election without any description, winning by the largest margin in NUS history. Other candidates standing included: Conservative Future&#x27;s candidate Michael Champion and the Socialist Workers&#x27; Student Society candidate Suzie Wylie.

==Career==
After her presidency, Fletcher worked for two years (2006–08) at the Centre for Excellence in Leadership, a government quango in the Further Education sector. Between 2008 and January 2010 she worked as Director of Policy and Development for the 157 Group. In 2010, she started volunteering for Ed Miliband&#x27;s Labour Leadership Campaign, being subsequently appointed as head of volunteers for the duration of the campaign.

Fletcher stood as a Labour candidate at St. George&#x27;s ward in the London Borough of Islington March 2013 by-election, and was elected as a councillor with relative ease. She was subsequently re-elected in the 2014 Islington London Borough Council election. Fletcher acted as election agent for Jeremy Corbyn in the 2015 general election, and was subsequently a part of Corbyn&#x27;s campaign team when he won the 2015 Labour Party leadership election.

In 2015, Fletcher was appointed the Deputy Mayor of Islington. The following year she was sworn in as Mayor, a post she held until May 2017. She selected the Ben Kinsella Trust as her designated charity.

In November 2019, she announced her decision to resign from Islington Council. During the 2020 Labour Party leadership election, she worked for Keir Starmer&#x27;s campaign as Director of Field.

<text>James Emil Coco (March 21, 1930 – February 25, 1987) was an American stage and screen actor. He was the recipient of a Primetime Emmy Award, a Drama Desk Award, a Cable ACE Award and three Obie Awards, as well as nominations for a Tony Award, an Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards. Coco is remembered for his supporting roles in the films &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (1972), &quot;Murder by Death&quot; (1976) and &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot; (1981).

==Early life and career==
Born in the Little Italy section of Manhattan, Coco was the son of Felice Lescoco, a shoemaker, and Ida Detestes Lescoco (Coco being a shortened version of his birth name).

The family moved to the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx when he was an infant, where he lived until his late teens.

James began acting straight out of high school. He received his acting training at HB Studio in New York City. As an overweight and prematurely balding adult, he found himself relegated to character roles. He made his Broadway debut in &quot;Hotel Paradiso&quot; in 1957, but his first major recognition was for Off-Broadway&#x27;s &quot;The Moon in Yellow River&quot; by Denis Johnston, for which he won an Obie Award.

Coco&#x27;s first modern collaboration with playwright Terrence McNally was a 1968 Off-Broadway double-bill of the one-act plays &quot;Sweet Eros&quot; and &quot;Witness&quot;, followed by &quot;Here&#x27;s Where I Belong&quot;, a disastrous Broadway musical adaptation of &quot;East of Eden&quot; that closed on opening night. They had far greater success with their next project, &quot;Next&quot;, a two-character play with Elaine Shore, which ran for more than 700 performances and won Coco the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance. Sixteen years later, the two reunited for the Manhattan Theatre Club production of &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Play&quot;.

Coco also achieved success with Neil Simon, who wrote &quot;The Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot; (1969) specifically for him. It earned him a Tony Award nomination as Best Actor in a Play. The two later joined forces for a Broadway revival of the musical &quot;Little Me&quot; and the films &quot;Murder by Death&quot; (1976), &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; (1978) and &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot; (1981), for which he was both Oscar-nominated and Razzie-nominated.

Coco, a veteran of many failed diets, was the author of the bestselling book &quot;The James Coco Diet&quot;, released on February 1, 1983, which documented his successful experience of the Structure House Weight Loss Plan, developed by Gerard Musante. However, he only lived four years after the release of his book.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirkusreviews/paone-coco&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television roles==
Coco&#x27;s additional film credits include &quot;Ensign Pulver&quot; (1964), &quot;The Patty Duke Show &quot;(1965). &quot;End of the Road&quot; (1970), &quot;The Strawberry Statement&quot; (1970), &quot;Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon&quot; (1970), &quot;A New Leaf&quot; (1971), &quot;Such Good Friends&quot; (1971), &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (1972), &quot;The Wild Party&quot; (1975), &quot;Charleston&quot; (1977), &quot;Scavenger Hunt&quot; (1979), &quot;Wholly Moses!&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; (1984).

Several of his films were released posthumously, including: &quot;Hunk&quot; (1987) and &quot;That&#x27;s Adequate&quot; (1989).

On television, Coco starred on two unsuccessful 1970s series, &quot;Calucci&#x27;s Department&quot; and &quot;The Dumplings&quot;, and made guest appearances on many series, including &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot;, NBC Children&#x27;s Theater, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Medical Center&quot;, &quot;Maude&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;The Eddie Capra Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;$weepstake$&quot;, and &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, for which he won an Emmy Award. One of his later television assignments was a recurring role as Nick Milano on the sitcom &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;. Coco died exactly one day after what was his final appearance on &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; was broadcast.

==Awards and nominations==
==Personal life==
Coco was gay.

==Death==
Coco died at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Manhattan, on February 25, 1987, at age 56 after suffering a heart attack at his Greenwich Village home. He is buried in St. Gertrude&#x27;s Roman Catholic Cemetery in Colonia, New Jersey.

<doc id="608485" wikidata="Q3273260" url="?curid=608485" title="MTV (Canadian TV channel)">
<text>MTV was a Canadian English-language discretionary specialty channel formerly owned by Bell Media subsidiary of BCE Inc. with the name and branding used under a licensing agreement with Paramount Global. Originally devoted to talk, lifestyle, documentary and scripted programming, the channel drifted towards programming sourced from its U.S. counterpart aimed at men ages 12-87 before the channel would wind down in 2024.

The channel launched as Talktv in 2000 by Bell Globemedia, but was not as widely available prior to its relaunch in March 2006. Unlike MTV channels in the United States and elsewhere, the channel was restricted in its ability to carry music programming until 2015, due to conditions in the channel&#x27;s licence issued by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Thus, the channel never used the &quot;Music Television&quot; tagline as its international counterparts did prior to 2010. Instead, MuchMusic had been launched in 1984 as the designated Canadian channel dedicated to mainstream music.

As a former Category A service, MTV was required to be carried on the basic service of all digital cable providers across Canada. The channel was typically offered optionally at the discretion of providers.

On October 30, 2024, Bell Media announced that MTV Canada would be discontinued at the end of the year. The channel terminated on December 31, 2024. The sister network Much took over the programming of MTV Canada.

==History==

===MTV in Canada before 2005===

CHUM Limited launched Canadian music channel MuchMusic in 1984, inspired by the success of MTV in the United States. CRTC genre exclusivity restrictions prevented MTV from either bringing its American channel directly into Canada or launching a homegrown competitor. Instead, MuchMusic would acquire Canadian rights to MTV&#x27;s programming.

In October 2001, MTV partnered with Craig Media to launch MTV Canada as a digital cable channel. One of the conditions of licence was that a maximum of 10% of the schedule could be devoted to music videos and music programming. In 2003, CHUM filed a complaint with the CRTC alleging that MTV Canada was airing more music videos and music programming than allowed by its licence and had subsequently become competitive with MuchMusic. In Broadcasting Decision 2003-65, the CRTC found that MTV Canada was offering a music-based service rather than a broadly-based teen channel. Furthermore, the Commission found that MTV was broadcasting in excess of 10% music video clips and that MTV was not meeting its commitment to provide educational programming for teens, nor was it providing any programming from independent educational authorities.

Craig was ordered to come into compliance with its broadcasting licence, but after CHUM purchased Craig in 2004, MTV Networks terminated the agreement with Craig as the contract had included a provision to cancel the agreement if there was a change in ownership. MTV Canada was subsequently rebranded as Razer from 2005 to 2008, when the channel was rebranded as MTV2 on August 1.

=== Launch as Talktv ===

Meanwhile, Talktv was licensed by the CRTC to Baton Broadcasting, Inc. in 1996 and was launched on September 1, 2000, and primarily carried repeats of CTV talk shows, as well as a six-hour afternoon/evening program, &quot;The Chatroom&quot;, which aired every weekday until mid-2002, usually broadcast from the CTV-owned Masonic Temple in Toronto. The program featured future CTV network personalities Seamus O&#x27;Regan and Ben Mulroney, as well as Craig Norris (now at CBLA-FM-2 in Kitchener, Ontario) and Jennifer Hollett. In 1999, talktv also acquired the broadcast rights to &quot;Pamela Wallin Live&quot;, which formerly aired on CBC Newsworld. Upon its move, the program was renamed &quot;Pamela Wallin&#x27;s talktv&quot;.

Talktv had been licensed as an analogue channel, allowing cable companies to offer it without requiring a digital converter box, and was one of the last specialty channels to be launched with that status (all specialty channels licensed since 2001 have been specifically limited to digital distribution). However, it was not explicitly required to receive analog carriage either, provided the provider had already launched digital services. Due to this, combined with the channel&#x27;s late launch and cable systems approaching capacity for analog channels, Talktv was only available on digital programming tiers, aside from a handful of major markets such as Toronto. In 2002, the CRTC had granted the channel the right to charge 7¢ per subscriber when carried on basic cable, whereas it was previously made available to these viewers free of charge; the new charge had been expected to help sustain the channel&#x27;s live programming.

Due of low ratings, and much more narrow distribution than other specialty channels, &quot;The Chatroom&quot; was cancelled in 2002, after which talktv became solely a repeat service for CTV network programming and repeated segments of &quot;The Chatroom&quot;.

===The return of MTV Canada===

On September 28, 2005, CTV and MTV Networks announced that Talktv would be relaunched as a new Canadian incarnation of MTV, while continuing to maintain its licence requirement of &quot;documentary programming&quot; with over 68% Canadian content. In the September 28 press release, CTV claimed to have applied for a Category 2 licence that would feature music videos, along the lines of the former MTV2 Canada (now Juicebox).

CTV already had strong ties with MTV; it was the first broadcast network to air &quot;The Osbournes&quot;, which aired during prime time, uncensored and subsequently aired &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; and &quot;&quot;. CTV&#x27;s &quot;exclusive&quot; rights to MTV content meant that CHUM&#x27;s MuchMusic lost all rights to MTV programming immediately following the announcement. CHUM released a statement saying that they would be intrigued as to how talktv could be morphed into MTV without violating its CRTC broadcasting licence, and filed a complaint with the CRTC. However, the CRTC was unable to take preemptive action based on a press release.

Since MTV uses the same broadcast licence CTV held for talktv, CTV is restricted by the following conditions of licence:
* an emphasis on talk programs
* a minimum of 68% of the daytime programming must be Canadian content
* a minimum of 71% of the prime time programming (6:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time) must be Canadian content

Prior to the relaunch, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that the network would &quot;... be quite different from what most people associate with the original American MTV, which has increasingly moved away from music videos toward reality shows and other original programming,&quot; placing a heavy emphasis on &quot;talk and lifestyle shows&quot;. In a Canadian Press report, it was stated that while there could not be a Canadian version of the music-oriented &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, other spin-off programs were not out of the question. Canadian versions of &quot;MTV Cribs&quot;, &quot;Diary&quot; and &quot;Making the Video&quot; have already been produced.

Leading up to the launch, CTV aired the specials &quot;MTV Unplugged: Alicia Keys&quot; in early October 2005, and &quot;MTV&#x27;s New Year of Music&quot; on December 31, 2005. In February 2006, MTV began promoting its launch date with a series of ads with the slogan &quot;the drought ends 03.21.06,&quot; some of which appeared during various programs across Bell Globemedia&#x27;s (now Bell Media) television platforms. Talktv&#x27;s bug began periodically changing into an MTV logo to notify viewers of the coming change. On March 1, 2006, the network identifier on several program guides changed from &quot;talktv&quot; to &quot;MTVCAN,&quot; additionally the sole program listed was &quot;MTV is Coming,&quot; however this was not an actual program and the talktv schedule continued to air.
On February 20, 2006, CTV announced that the Masonic Temple in Toronto – which was previously home to &quot;Open Mike with Mike Bullard&quot; – would be the new home for MTV Canada and its new flagship show, &quot;MTV Live&quot;. This would be essentially a revival of the live-and-interactive talk show format introduced by &quot;the chatroom&quot;, with new hosts, the addition of a studio audience, field reports, and live performances.

The final program broadcast under the talktv brand was that night&#x27;s episode of &quot;eTalk Daily&quot; on March 20, 2006 at 11:30 p.m. Eastern Time; this was followed at midnight Eastern Time by a large, red MTV logo and an 18-hour countdown clock in preparation for the relaunch. The relaunch occurred on March 21, 2006, at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time, with the first edition of &quot;MTV Live&quot;. The start of &quot;MTV Live&quot; was preceded (at 5:58:20 p.m. Eastern Time) by a ten-second countdown featuring water drops with &quot;MTV drops&quot; appearing at the end, followed by a 90-second promo featuring various people wearing beige MTV shirts falling out of the sky signifying that the drought was over, as seen in the launch promos. The relaunch as MTV did not affect the channel&#x27;s analogue status. In fact, many analogue cable viewers that never had access to talktv were able to view the channel at, or soon after, its relaunch. Analogue coverage has been greatly expanded, and many channel placements improved, through new deals with Rogers Cable, Bell TV, Shaw Direct and other cable and satellite providers.

The channel held its official on-air launch party on April 18, 2006, with live performances by Kanye West and Sam Roberts. These performances were edited into several specials that are aired on CTV. On June 27, 2006, MTV Canada aired &quot;Making the Video&quot; for the first time (Ashlee Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Invisible&quot;), but only showed a short clip of the video. Viewers were told to watch the rest of the video on the MTV website. Recently, episodes of &quot;Making the Video&quot; broadcast on the channel have included the full music video.

On November 2, 2012, Bell Media announced that MTV would relocate from the Masonic Temple, which the channel was based from its inception since 2000, to 299 Queen Street West where most of its specialty channels are based, with Bell Media putting the channel&#x27;s headquarters up for sale on March 4, 2013.

Starting in 2013, the channel would begin airing MTV&#x27;s scripted programming and the MTV Video Music Awards, alongside new episodes of &quot;&quot; and its in-house produced aftershow, &quot;After Degrassi&quot;.

Since the late 2010&#x27;s, MTV has re-oriented its programming towards male-targeting reality television series, including &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; and &quot;Cops&quot;. The majority of its talk, lifestyle, documentary and scripted programming has since been dispersed to other Bell Media channels.

In August 2021, the channel began adopting the current logo being used worldwide. In Quebec, MTV was launched in summer 2024 via the Noovo streaming service.

===Closure===
MTV2 (the former iteration of MTV Canada under Craig) ceased operations on March 29, 2024. In an October 31, 2024 report by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, a Bell Media spokesperson stated that MTV Canada would be shut down on December 31, 2024, with the company citing &quot;changing audiences&quot; as reasoning, and directing viewers to CTV.ca and Crave. Much of its U.S. programs that were aired on this channel are also available on Paramount+ which is also available in Canada. The last show that aired on the channel was an episode of Ridiculousness.

Following the closedown, most current MTV original programming moved to sister channel Much, however other certain programming, such as current seasons of established franchises such as &quot;The Challenge&quot; and &quot;Teen Mom&quot;, has been picked up by Corus Entertainment&#x27;s Slice.

==Programming==

Though still marketed as a talk-based service as of 2024, MTV ended its run by carrying most of the original programming seen on its U.S. counterpart, though the network&#x27;s scripted programming (&quot;Teen Wolf&quot; and &quot;Awkward.&quot;, etc.) and the &quot;MTV Video Music Awards&quot; did not begin airing on the Canadian channel until 2013.

Music-based programming was absent from the channel because the original broadcasting licence issued for Talktv did not allow for any music programming, but its programs were interactive television blended with vintage and traditional talk programming. Moreover, MuchMusic&#x27;s previous status as Canada&#x27;s mainstream music channel (and the accompanying genre protection from direct competition) meant that MTV could not have requested a new format enabling it to compete directly with Much in any event. Since mid-2007, Much and its affiliated channels have been under the same ownership, following CTVglobemedia&#x27;s acquisition of CHUM Limited, making the former rival networks present-day sister channels.

In March 2015, the CRTC announced it would no longer enforce conditions of licence related to programming for most specialty channels other than those primarily airing news or sports. By that point, MTV&#x27;s schedule had begun to emphasize scripted series reruns during the daytime hours, including Canadian-produced shows to fulfill Canadian content quotas. By the late 2010&#x27;s, MTV had moved most of its scripted programming to Bravo, some of its talk programming to E!, and many of its lifestyle programming to Gusto, entirely sourcing many of its programming from its U.S. counterpart.

===&quot;10 Spot&quot;===
The &quot;10 Spot&quot; is the channel&#x27;s hour-long primetime block of MTV reality and lifestyle series airing weeknights at 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. New, as well as returning series premiere on the block on a monthly basis. Branded after the former block on the U.S. channel, the &quot;10 Spot&quot; schedule often resembles that featured on the MTV channel in the United States, although the programs are often aired several weeks behind their initial broadcast in the U.S.

===Interactivity===
During afternoon and prime time commercial breaks, MTV hosts direct discussions about the shows that are currently airing on the channel. Viewers are encouraged to interact with MTV and its hosts through emails or telephone. These short interstitials are used as a way of fulfilling the talk programming requirements under the channel&#x27;s license.

===MTV on CTV===
CTV formerly aired a late-night block of MTV programming branded as &quot;MTV on CTV,&quot; airing on Saturdays from 12:05 to 2:05 a.m. local time (actual times may vary by location or station). Programming featured in the block includes several of the music-oriented and comedy programs that MTV Canada itself cannot air as well as many of the reality/lifestyle shows that are shown on MTV. A half-hour weeknight block aired at 1:05 a.m. local time from MTV Canada&#x27;s 2006 relaunch until September 7, 2007, when it was replaced by &quot;TMZ on TV&quot;.

==MTV.ca==
At the time of launch in March 2006, the channel&#x27;s website was branded as MTV Overdrive. This brand was dropped in early 2007, months after MTV U.S. had dropped the Overdrive name for its website, which it began simply calling &quot;MTV.com&quot;. In June 2007, the site was redesigned, and was once again facelifted in March 2009 to refocus the website on its video content. As of 2024, the channel now directs to the CTV.ca website.

MTV also maintains a Canadian-exclusive web brand called &quot;MTV FORA&quot;, which is dedicated to beauty, fashion, and lifestyle content.

==High-definition feed==
On June 4, 2013, MTV HD was launched as a high definition simulcast of MTV that broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format on Eastlink. The HD feed is also available nationally on Bell Fibe TV and Telus Optik TV, and regionally on Cogeco Cable and Rogers Cable.

<text>Captain James Buchanan Eads (May 23, 1820 – March 8, 1887) was a world-renowned American civil engineer and inventor, holding more than 50 patents. 

Eads&#x27; great Mississippi River Bridge at St. Louis was designated a National Historic Landmark by the Department of the Interior in 1964 and on October 21, 1974 was listed as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was also awarded a Special Award of Recognition by the American Institute of Steel Construction in 1974 on the 100th anniversary of its entry into service. Eads also designed the jetties of the south pass of the Mississippi River, which were designated as National Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks in 1982.

==Early life and education==
Eads was born in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, and named for his mother&#x27;s cousin, future President of the United States James Buchanan. Eads&#x27; father, Thomas C. Eads, pursued a fortune to no avail and the family moved several times. Eads grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. The family lost all of their possessions in a steamboat fire as they landed in St. Louis in 1833. Thomas Eads&#x27; business ventures in St. Louis failed, and he abandoned his family and moved upriver.

James Eads was largely self-educated; at the age of 13, he left school to take up work to help support the family. He sold apples on the streets of St. Louis to help support his sisters and mother, who ran a boardinghouse. One of his first jobs was at the Williams &amp; Duhring dry-goods store run by Barrett Williams. Williams allowed the young Eads to spend time in his library, located above the store. In Eads&#x27;s spare time, he read books on physical science, mechanics, machinery, and civil engineering. When Eads became successful later in life and Williams suffered hardship, Eads reciprocated Williams&#x27; generosity by providing money for Williams&#x27; comfort in his old age.

== Family ==

Around 1842, Eads fell in love with Martha Dillon, a woman related to him by marriage. Martha&#x27;s father was Patrick Dillon, a prominent St. Louis businessman. Patrick did not approve of the couple, as he wanted Martha to marry someone with money and influence. In October 1845, James and Martha wed without her father&#x27;s consent.

Martha moved in with Eads&#x27; parents in LeClaire, Iowa while Eads stayed behind in St. Louis to set up a glass works. Although their living arrangement was supposed to be temporary, the failure of his glass business made it permanent. Eads had many debts to pay off from the failed business and he went back to working in salvage.

Martha died in October 1852 of cholera. She did not live to see Eads become successful. Five years after her death, when Eads retired from working on the river, he had amassed a fortune of $500,000.

Nine years after Martha&#x27;s death, in 1861, Eads remarried.

==Fortune==
When he was twenty-two, Eads designed a salvage boat and showed the drawings to two shipbuilders, Calvin Case and William Nelson. Although Eads had no previous experience and no capital for the project, Case and Nelson were impressed with him and the three became partners.

At that time, salvaging wrecks from the Mississippi River was nearly impossible because of strong currents. Eads made his initial fortune in salvage by creating a diving bell, using a wine barrel to retrieve goods sunk in riverboat disasters. He also devised special boats for raising the remains of sunken ships from the river bed. Eads did much of the diving himself because the work was so dangerous. His work gave Eads an intimate knowledge of the river, as he explored its depths from the Gulf of Mexico to Iowa. Because of his detailed knowledge of the Mississippi (the equal of any professional river pilot), his exceptional ability at navigating the most treacherous parts of the river system, and his personal fleet of snag-boats and salvage craft, he was afforded the much prized courtesy title of &quot;Captain&quot; by the rivermen of the Mississippi and was addressed as Captain Eads throughout his life.

==Civil War==
In 1861, after the outbreak of the American Civil War, Eads was called to Washington at the prompting of his friend, Attorney General Edward Bates, to consult on the defense of the Mississippi River. Soon afterward, he was contracted to construct the City-class ironclads for the United States Navy, and produced seven such ships within five months: &quot;St. Louis&quot;, &quot;Cairo&quot;, &quot;Carondelet&quot;, , &quot;Louisville&quot;, &quot;Mound City&quot;, and &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;. He also converted the river steamer &quot;New Era&quot; into the ironclad &quot;Essex&quot;. The river ironclads were a vital element in the highly successful Federal offensive into Tennessee, Kentucky and upper Mississippi (February–June, 1862). Eads corresponded frequently with Navy officers of the Western Flotilla, and used their &quot;combat lessons learned&quot; to improve vessels during post-combat repairs, and incorporate improvements into succeeding generations of gunboats. By the end of the war he would build more than 30 river ironclads.

The last were so hardy that the Navy sent them into service in the Gulf of Mexico, where they supported the successful Federal attack on the Confederate port city of Mobile. All senior officers in the Western Theater, including Grant and Sherman, agreed that Eads and his vessels had been vital to early victory in the West. The first four gunboats were built at the Eads&#x27; Union Marine Works in Carondelet, Missouri. The next three were built under Eads&#x27; contract at the Mound City (Illinois) Marine Railway and Shipyard. Eads&#x27; vessels were the first United States ironclads to enter combat. On January 11, 1862 the Eads-built ironclads &quot;St. Louis&quot; and &quot;Essex&quot; fought the Confederate gunboats &quot;CSS General Polk&quot;, &quot;CSS Ivy&quot;, and &quot;CSS Jackson&quot; at Lucas Bend, on the Mississippi River. Subsequently, on February 6, 1862, Eads&#x27; ironclads captured Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. This was over a month before the combat actions of the ironclads &quot;CSS Virginia&quot; and &quot;USS Monitor&quot; during the March 8–9, 1862 Battle of Hampton Roads.

During the war, Eads wrote a check to the War Department for $1,000 to help homeless Confederates and Union sympathizers. After the war, he held a fair to raise money for the thousands of homeless refugees in St. Louis.

==Mississippi River bridge==

Eads designed and built the first road and rail bridge to cross the Mississippi River at St. Louis. The Eads Bridge, constructed from 1867 through 1874, was the first bridge of a significant size with steel as its primary material, and it was the longest arch bridge in the world when completed. Eads was the first bridge builder to employ the cantilever method, which allowed steam boat traffic to continue using the river during construction. The bridge is still in use today, carrying both automobile and light rail traffic over the river. 

==Mississippi River designs==

The Mississippi in the 100-mile-plus stretch between the port of New Orleans, Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico frequently suffered from silting up of its outlets, stranding ships or making parts of the river unnavigable for a period of time. Eads solved the problem with a wooden jetty system that narrowed the main outlet of the river, causing the river to speed up and cut its channel deeper, allowing year-round navigation. Eads offered to build the jetties first, and charge the government later. If he was successful, and the jetties caused the river to cut a channel 30 feet deep for 20 years, the government agreed to pay him $8 million. Eads was successful. The jetty system was installed in 1876 and the channel was cleared in February 1877. 
Journalist Joseph Pulitzer, who had known Eads for five years, invested $20,000 in this project. A flood in 1890 brought calls for a similar system for the entire Mississippi Valley. A jetty system would prevent the floods by deepening the main channel. However, there were concerns about the ability of water moving through a jetty system to cut out the rock and clay on the river bottom. The development of navigable channels at the mouth of the Mississippi River made Eads famous.

In 1982, the American Society of Civil Engineers designated the south pass jetties as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.

==Other work==

Eads designed a gigantic railway system intended for construction at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, which would carry ocean-going ships across the isthmus from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean; this attracted some interest but was never constructed.

In 1884 he became the first U.S. citizen awarded the Albert Medal of the Royal Society of the Arts.

== Later life and death ==
Although he came from a humble background, Eads&#x27; accomplishments throughout his life earned him wealth and renown. He was so revered that Scientific American proposed that he run for president of the United States.

Eads died while on vacation in Nassau, Bahamas, aged 66. Eads and his second wife, Eunice, had moved to New York four years before his death. However, his funeral took place in St. Louis and he was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri in the family vault.

==Legacy==

The towns of Eads, Tennessee; Eads, Colorado; and Port Eads, Louisiana are named for him.

U.S. Route 50 through Lawrenceburg, his hometown, is called Eads Parkway in his honor.

Eads Street is a street running parallel to U.S. Route 1/Richmond Highway in Crystal City, Arlington Virginia.

In 1920, Eads was added to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans colonnade, located on the grounds of the Bronx Community College in New York.

Eads is memorialized at Washington University in St. Louis by James B. Eads Hall, a 19th-century building long associated with science and technology. Eads Hall was the site of Professor Arthur Holly Compton&#x27;s Nobel Prize–winning experiments in electromagnetic radiation. Today Eads Hall continues to serve Washington University as the site of a number of facilities including the Arts and Sciences Computing Center. Eads Hall was the gift of Captain Eads&#x27;s daughter Mrs. James Finney How.

Each year the Academy of Science of St. Louis awards the James B. Eads Award recognizing a distinguished individual for outstanding achievement in science and technology.

Eads is recognized with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

In 1927, the deans of America&#x27;s engineering colleges vote Eads one of the top five engineers of all time, an accolade he shared with Leonardo da Vinci, James Watt, Ferdinand de Lesseps, and Thomas A. Edison.

Eads&#x27; great Mississippi River Bridge at St. Louis was designated a National Historic Landmark by the Department of the Interior in 1964 and on October 21, 1974 was listed as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was also awarded a Special Award of Recognition by the American Institute of Steel Construction in 1974 on the 100th anniversary of its entry into service.

<text>Magnocellular neurosecretory cells are large neuroendocrine cells within the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. They are also found in smaller numbers in accessory cell groups between these two nuclei, the largest one being the circular nucleus. There are two types of magnocellular neurosecretory cells, oxytocin-producing cells and vasopressin-producing cells, but a small number can produce both hormones. These cells are neuroendocrine neurons, are electrically excitable, and generate action potentials in response to afferent stimulation. Vasopressin is produced from the vasopressin-producing cells via the AVP gene, a molecular output of circadian pathways.

Magnocellular neurosecretory cells in rats (where these neurons have been most extensively studied) in general have a single long varicose axon, which projects to the posterior pituitary. Each axon gives rise to about 10,000 neurosecretory terminals and many axon swellings that store very large numbers of hormone-containing vesicles. These vesicles are released from the axon swellings and nerve terminals by exocytosis in response to calcium entry through voltage-gated ion channels, which occurs when action potentials are propagated down the axons.

The cells typically have two or three long dendrites, which also contain large dilations and a very high density of hormone-containing vesicles. Oxytocin and vasopressin can, thus, be released within the brain from these dendrites, as well as into the blood from the terminals in the posterior pituitary gland. However, the release of oxytocin and vasopressin from dendrites is not consistently accompanied by peripheral secretion, as dendritic release is regulated differently. Dendritic release can be triggered by depolarisation, but can also be triggered by the mobilisation of intracellular calcium stores. The dendrites receive most of the synaptic inputs from afferent neurons that regulate the magnocellular neurons; typically a magnocellular neuron receives about 10,000 synapses from afferent neurons.

The activity of magnocellular neurosecretory cells is regulated by local glial cells as well as through themselves (intrinsically). Their activity is also dependent on reproductive, osmotic, and cardiovascular inputs.

<text>The hypolimnion or under lake is the dense, bottom layer of water in a thermally-stratified lake. The word &quot;&quot; is derived from . It is the layer that lies below the thermocline.

Typically the hypolimnion is the coldest layer of a lake in summer, and the warmest layer during winter. In deep, temperate lakes, the bottom-most waters of the hypolimnion are typically close to 4 °C throughout the year. The hypolimnion may be much warmer in lakes at warmer latitudes. Being at depth, it is isolated from surface wind-mixing during summer, and usually receives insufficient irradiance (light) for photosynthesis to occur.

== Oxygen dynamics ==
The deepest portions of the hypolimnion often have lower oxygen concentrations than the surface waters (i.e., epilimnion). While oxygen can typically exchange between surface waters and the atmosphere (i.e., in the absence of ice cover), bottom waters are comparatively isolated from atmospheric replenishment of oxygen. In particular, during periods of thermal stratification, gas exchange between the epilimnion and hypolimnion is limited by the density difference between these two layers. Consequently, decomposition of organic matter in the water column and sediments can cause oxygen concentrations to decline to the point of hypoxia (low oxygen) or anoxia (no oxygen). In dimictic, eutrophic lakes, the hypolimnion is often anoxic throughout a majority of the stratified period. However, hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations are replenished in the fall and early winter in many temperate lakes, as lake turnover allows mixing of oxic surface waters and anoxic bottom waters.

Notably, anoxic conditions in temperate lakes have the potential to create a positive feedback, whereby anoxia during a given year begets increasingly severe and frequent occurrences of anoxia in future years. Anoxia can lead to release of nutrients from sediment, which contribute to increased phytoplankton growth. Increased phytoplankton growth subsequently increases decomposition, perpetuating hypolimnetic oxygen declines. This positive feedback effect has been termed the Anoxia Begets Anoxia feedback.

=== Hypolimnetic aeration ===
In eutrophic lakes where the hypolimnion is anoxic, hypolimnetic aeration may be used to add oxygen to the hypolimnion. Adding oxygen to the system through aeration can be costly because it requires significant amounts of energy.

<doc id="608510" wikidata="Q990066" url="?curid=608510" title="Epilimnion">
<text>The epilimnion or surface layer is the top-most layer in a thermally stratified lake. 

The epilimnion is the layer that is most affected by sunlight, its thermal energy heating the surface, thereby making it warmer and less dense. As a result, the epilimnion sits above the deeper metalimnion and hypolimnion, which are colder and denser. Additionally, the epilimnion is typically has a higher pH and higher dissolved oxygen concentration than the hypolimnion.
== Physical Structure ==

=== Properties ===
In the water column, the epilimnion sits above all other layers. The epilimnion is only present in stratified lakes. On the topside of the epilimnion it is in contact with air, which leaves it open to wind action, which allows the water to experience turbulence. Turbulence and convection work together to make waves which increases aeration. On the bottom side of the epilimnion is the metalimnion, which contains the thermocline. The thermocline is created because of the difference in temperature between the epilimnion and the metalimnion. This is due to the fact that since the epilimnion is in contact with air and is above everything, it interacts with the sun and heat more, making it warmer than the layers below. In certain areas during the winter, the epilimnion will freeze over, cutting off the lake from being aerated directly. Because of the epilimnion&#x27;s susceptibility to air temperature change, it is often used to monitor warming trends. 

=== Lake Turnover and Mixing ===
In most stratified lakes, seasonal changes in the spring and fall air temperature cause the epilimnion to warm up or cool down. During these seasonal changes stratified lakes may experience a lake turnover. During this, the epilimnion and hypolimnion mix together and the lake generally becomes un-stratified, meaning it has a constant temperature throughout, and the nutrients are even throughout the lake. There are different names for these turnovers based on how many times the lake does it in a year. Monomictic lakes flip only once, dimictic flip twice, and polymictic lakes flip more than twice. These turnovers can be based on seasonal differences, or can even happen daily. In some cases this causes the lake to have inverse stratification, where the epilimnion has cooler water than the hypolimnion.

== Chemistry ==
With the layer being open to air, the epilimnion usually has high amounts of dissolved O2 and CO2. This means the epilimnion is in a constant state of exchange of dissolved gases with the atmosphere. The epilimnion&#x27;s thickness can be impacted by light exposure; more transparent lakes receive greater levels of light, leading to more stored energy in the water and a shallower epilimnion. The epilimnion is also an area of concern for algal blooms due to phosphorus and nitrogen runoff from terrestrial sources. Wind erosion carrying soil particles can also introduce many different nutrients into the water as well, and those particles will enter the lake system through the epilimnion.

== Biology ==
Because of its closeness to the surface, and being the area that receives the most sunlight, the epilimnion is a great home for phytoplankton, and other primary producers. Algal blooms are common in this layer as a result of large accumulations of nutrients. In response to large amounts of algae and phytoplankton being present, many fish species are common in this layer as they look for their source of food. Birds will often use the epilimnion as an area for rest and/or fishing. Many insects also make various uses of the epilimnion when it comes to nest making and habitat. Human interactions are also an important part of the biological part of the epilimnion. Some direct human interactions are recreational uses such as swimming, boating, or other activities. Other indirect interactions may come from sewage, runoff of agricultural fields, or land development. These are all able to affect properties of the epilimnion.

<doc id="608513" wikidata="Q546440" url="?curid=608513" title="Bylina">
<text>A bylina (, ; ) is a type of Russian oral epic poem.

The oldest &quot;byliny&quot; are set in the 10th to 12th centuries in Kievan Rus&#x27;, while others deal with all periods of Russian and Ukrainian history. Byliny narratives are loosely based on historical fact, but greatly embellished with fantasy or hyperbole.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the past tense of the verb &quot;to be&quot; () and implies &#x27;something that was&#x27;. The term most likely originated from scholars of Russian folklore (folklorists); in 1839, Ivan Sakharov, a Russian folklorist, published an anthology of Russian folklore, a section of which he titled &quot;Byliny of the Russian People&quot;, causing the popularization of the term. Later scholars believe that Sakharov misunderstood the word in the opening of the &quot;Igor Tale&quot; as &quot;an ancient poem.&quot; The folk singers of called their songs , , ; ) or and ), meaning &#x27;stories of old&#x27; ).

==History== 
Most scholars adhere to the version expressed by Vsevolod Miller that as an old genre originated in the Russian North. According to Miller, the prototype of the Old Russian were sacred northern legends, read according to a certain &quot;bylinic technique&quot;, passed &quot;from generation to generation, by the teacher to the student&quot;. Regarding the time of the origin of the , Leonid Maykov wrote:

Finally, according to Orestes Miller, the great antiquity of is proved by the fact that they depict a defensive policy, not an offensive one.

Anthologists played an important role in the narration and preservation of . After Sakharov, there were numerous other anthologists who contributed to its development, particularly during the 18th century. For example, Kirsha Danilov produced a compilation of 70 . His sources were believed to be miners living in the Perm area. The works of these folklorists provided insights into the transition of the Russian literary tradition from one that was focused on religious subjects to secular literature. The first transcriptions of are attributed to Richard James, an Englishman who traveled to Russia from 1617 to 1619. The texts that he was able to record are now preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford

There was also a known German translation of the and this was published anonymously in 1819. Overall, interest in these epic poems continued to the point that comprehensive and wide-ranging materials were sourced from virtually all of Great Russia. Although these were preserved, according to Kahn et al., only those from &quot;northern Russia, the areas of Arkhangelsk, Olonetsk, the Onega region, and parts of Siberia&quot; were actively preserved into the 20th century.

==Collections==
 have been collected in Russia since the 17th century; initially they were published for entertainment in prose paraphrases. The Cossack Kirsha Danilov compiled the most notable of the early collections in the Ural region for the mill owner Prokofi Demidov in the middle of the 18th century. In the middle of the 19th century, Pavel Rybnikov traveled through the region of Lake Onega and rediscovered that the tradition, which was thought to be extinct, still flourished among the peasants of northwest Russia. A storm stranded Rybnikov on an island in Lake Onega where he heard the sound of a being sung; he persuaded the singer to repeat the song and wrote down his words. He proceeded to collect several hundred , all of which he recorded from spoken paraphrase, and published them from 1861 to 1867 in several volumes entitled &quot;Songs Collected by P. N. Rybnikov&quot;.

Another influential collector, Alexander Gilferding, published one collection entitled &quot;Onega Bylinas Recorded by A. F. Gilferding in the Summer of 1871&quot;. He improved upon Rybnikov&#x27;s work by transcribing the directly from the sung performance rather than the spoken retellings. He noticed that the rhythm differed between the sung and spoken versions, and asked the performers to pause for a longer period of time between lines to allow him time to record the words from the song itself. He also organized his collection by singer rather than subject and included short biographical sketches of the performers with their collected songs, thus focusing on the singer&#x27;s role in the composition of the song. Following the work of Rybnikov and Gilferding, many more scholars searched for everywhere in northern Russia, and obtained from the shores of the White Sea and the rivers flowing to the north.

==Classifications==
There are several ways to categorize , and scholars disagree on which classification to use. Scholars from the mythological school differentiate between about &#x27;older&#x27; and &#x27;younger&#x27; heroes. The &#x27;older&#x27; heroes resembled mythological figures, while the &#x27;younger&#x27; heroes resembled ordinary human beings. The historical school classifies based on the principality in which the story took place, as in Kievan, Novgorodian, and Galician-Volhynian cycles. The mythological of giants and the like probably originated long before the Kievan state was founded, and cannot be classified easily by principality. Scholars of the historical school often consider mythological separately. Other scholars group based on content, including heroic, fairy tale type, novella type and ballad-. Most scholars prefer classification based on principalities.

==Structure==
Because of their nature as performed pieces, singers employ basically linear and easy to follow structure. structure typically includes three basic parts, introduction, narrative portion and epilogue. The introduction sometimes includes a verse to entice the audience to listen. Introductions often describe heroes at a feast being given a task or setting out on a mission. The narrative portion relates the adventure with exaggerated details and hyperbole to make the story more exciting. The epilogue refers to the reward for the mission, a moral or a reference to the sea, since byliny were often performed to attempt to calm the sea. To help listeners grasp the story, singers used &#x27;tag lines&#x27; to preface speeches or dialogues, setting up for the audience who is talking to whom.

==Common themes==
Scenes common to include a hero taking leave of his mother, saddling a horse, entering a council chamber, bragging, departing over the wall of a city, going on a journey, urging on his horse, in battle, dressing in the morning, exchanging taunts with an enemy, becoming blood brothers with another hero, and asking for mercy. Singers may use their telling of these scenes in many of their songs, incorporating different elements in song after song. Themes in many include the birth and childhood of a hero, father and son fighting, battling a monster, the imprisoned or reluctant hero returning in time to save his city, matchmaking or bride taking, a husband arriving at the wedding of his wife, and encounters with a sorceress who turns men into animals. Christian beliefs mixed with pre-Christian ideas of magic and paganism in , for instance, saints would appear to defend mortals against darkness.

==Major characters and prototypes==

Major bylina characters are Russian epic heroes known as &quot;bogatyrs&quot;.

<text>Haverford is an unincorporated community located in both Haverford Township in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States, and Lower Merion Township in Montgomery County, approximately west of Philadelphia. The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) opened Haverford Station in 1880 on their Main Line west out of Broad Street Station (now Suburban Station) in Philadelphia. Haverford sits at milepost 9.17.

Haverford borders the unincorporated portion of Haverford Township called Havertown, as well as the unincorporated communities of Bryn Mawr, Gladwyne, Ardmore, Wynnewood, and a small portion of Broomall.

The Haverford neighborhood name was borrowed from the older entity, Haverford Township (established 1681) to which much of the unincorporated community belongs, as the result of a postal code address change in 1946. Haverford Township&#x27;s namesake is in turn derived from the name of the town of Haverfordwest in Wales, UK.

Today, Haverford is most notable for being the site of Haverford College and one of the United States&#x27; oldest country clubs, the Merion Cricket Club.

Major roads in Haverford include Lancaster Avenue (US 30/Lincoln Highway), Montgomery Avenue, Haverford Road, and I-476 (Blue Route).

<text>Edward Stuart Davis (December 7, 1892 – June 24, 1964) was an early American modernist painter. He was well known for his jazz-influenced, proto-pop art paintings of the 1940s and 1950s, bold, brash, and colorful, as well as his Ashcan School pictures in the early years of the 20th century. With the belief that his work could influence the sociopolitical environment of America, Davis&#x27; political message was apparent in all of his pieces from the most abstract to the clearest. Contrary to most modernist artists, Davis was aware of his political objectives and allegiances and did not waver in loyalty via artwork during the course of his career. By the 1930s, Davis was already a famous American painter, but that did not save him from feeling the negative effects of the Great Depression, which led to his being one of the first artists to apply for the Federal Art Project. Under the project, Davis created some seemingly Marxist works; however, he was too independent to fully support Marxist ideals and philosophies.

== Life and career ==

Davis was born Edward Stuart Davis on December 7, 1892, in Philadelphia to Edward Wyatt Davis, art editor of &quot;The Philadelphia Press&quot;, and Helen Stuart Davis, sculptor. In 1909 he entered the Orange High School, but during his first year he dropped out and began commuting to New York City. Davis began his formal art training under Robert Henri, the leader of the Ashcan School, at the Robert Henri School of Art in New York under 1912. During this time, Davis befriended painters John Sloan, Glenn Coleman and Henry Glintenkamp.

In 1913, Davis was one of the youngest painters to exhibit in the Armory Show, where he displayed five watercolor paintings in the Ashcan school style.
In the show, Davis was exposed to the works of a number of artists including Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso. Davis became a committed &quot;modern&quot; artist and a major exponent of cubism and modernism in America. He spent summers painting in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and made painting trips to Havana in 1918 and New Mexico in 1923.

After spending several years emulating artists in the Armory Show, Davis started moving toward a signature style with his 1919 &quot;Self-Portrait&quot;, in the collection of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art. In the 1920s he began his development into his mature style; painting abstract still lifes and landscapes. His use of contemporary subject matter such as cigarette packages and spark plug advertisements suggests a proto-pop art element to his work. Among Davis&#x27; practices was his use of previous paintings.
Elements of harbor scenes he painted in Gloucester, Massachusetts can be found in a number of subsequent works. Another practice was painting series, works with similar structures, but with altered colors or added geometric embellishments, essentially creating variations on a theme. Some commentators suggest that this aspect of his work parallels his love of jazz in which a basic chord structure is improvised upon by the musicians.

In 1928, he visited Paris, France for a year, where he painted street scenes. In 1929, while in Paris, he married his American girlfriend, Bessie Chosak. In the 1930s, he became increasingly politically engaged; according to Cécile Whiting, Davis&#x27; goal was to &quot;reconcile abstract art with Marxism and modern industrial society&quot;. In 1934 he joined the Artists&#x27; Union; he was later elected its president. In 1936 the American Artists&#x27; Congress elected him National Secretary. He painted murals for Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration that are influenced by his love of jazz.

In 1932 Davis was devastated by the loss of his wife, Bessie Chosak Davis, who died after complications from a botched abortion. Also in 1932, Davis executed a mural commission for Radio City Music Hall which the Rockefeller Center Art Committee named &quot;Men Without Women&quot; (after Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s second collection of short stories completed the same year). According to Hilton Kramer in a 1975 piece on the work in the New York Times, Davis was happy neither with the location in which the mural was placed nor with the title it was given.
In 1938, Davis painted &quot;Swing Landscape&quot;, a modernist mural now considered one of the most important American paintings in the 20th-century. That same year, Davis married Roselle Springer. Davis spent his late life teaching at the New York School for Social Research and at Yale University.

Along with his paintings, Davis was also a printmaker and was a member of the Society of American Graphic Artists.

From 1945 to 1951, Davis worked on &quot;The Mellow Pad&quot;, an abstract work inspired by jazz music.

In 1947–52, two works by Davis, &quot;For internal use only&quot; (1945) and &quot;Composition (1863)&quot; (c. 1930) were featured in the &quot;Painting toward architecture&quot; crossover art and design exhibition, in 28 venues.

In 1952, Davis received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts. 

He was represented by Edith Gregor Halpert at the Downtown Gallery in New York City.

One of his last paintings, &quot;Blips and Ifs&quot;, created between 1963 and 1964, is in the collection of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art.

In 1964, the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp featuring Davis&#x27; &#x27;Detail Study for Cliche&#x27;.

Davis died of a stroke in New York on June 24, 1964, aged 71.

== Mentors ==
Davis was first professionally trained by Robert Henri, an American realist. Henri began teaching Davis in 1909. Henri did not look highly upon American art institutions at the time, which led to him joining John Sloan and six other anti-institutional artists (known as &quot;the Eight&quot;) to put on an exhibit at the Macbeth Gallery in 1908. Through his vocal rejection of academic norms in painting, Henri encouraged Davis and his other students to find new forms and ways to express their art and to draw on their daily lives for inspiration.

== Inspirations ==
Ideologies prevalent during the Progressive Era led to the young Stuart Davis feeling a great sense of pride in being American, which led to his creating several works centered on a &quot;Great America&quot;. After his training with Henri, Davis would walk around the streets of New York City for inspiration for his works. His time amongst the public caused him to develop a strong social conscience which was strengthened through his friendship with John Sloan, another anti-institutional artist. Additionally, Davis frequented the 1913 Armory Show (in which he exhibited his work), to further educate himself on modernism and its evolving trends. Davis acquired an appreciation and knowledge of how to implement the formal and color advancements of European modernism, something Henri did not focus on, to his art. In 1925, the Société Anonyme put on an exhibit in New York with several pieces by the French artist Fernand Léger. Davis had a large amount of respect for Léger because like Davis, Léger sought the utmost formal clarity in his work. Davis also appreciated Léger&#x27;s work for the subject matter: storefronts, billboard and other man-made objects.

<text>The Mozilla Public License (MPL) is a free and open-source weak copyleft license for most Mozilla Foundation software such as Firefox and Thunderbird. The MPL is developed and maintained by Mozilla, which seeks to balance the concerns of both open-source and proprietary developers. It is distinguished from others as a middle ground between the permissive software BSD-style licenses and the GNU General Public License. As such, it allows the integration of MPL-licensed code into proprietary codebases, as long as the MPL-licensed components remain accessible under the terms of the MPL.

MPL has been used by others, such as Adobe to license their Flex product line, and The Document Foundation to license LibreOffice 4.0 (also on LGPL 3+). Version 1.1 was adapted by several projects to form derivative licenses like Sun Microsystems&#x27; Common Development and Distribution License. It has undergone two revisions: the minor update 1.1, and a major update version 2.0 nearing the goals of greater simplicity and better compatibility with other licenses.

==Terms==
The MPL defines rights as passing from &quot;contributors&quot;, who create or modify source code, through an optional auxiliary distributor (itself a licensee), to the licensee. It grants liberal copyright and patent licenses allowing for free use, modification, distribution, and &quot;exploit[ation]&quot; of the work, but does not grant the licensee any rights to a contributor&#x27;s trademarks. These rights will terminate if the licensee fails to comply with the license&#x27;s terms and conditions, but a violating licensee who returns to compliance regains its rights, and even receiving written notice from a contributor will result in losing rights to that contributor&#x27;s code only. A patent retaliation clause, similar to that of the Apache License, is included to protect an auxiliary distributor&#x27;s further recipients against patent trolling. The contributors disclaim warranty and liability, but allow auxiliary distributors to offer such things on their own behalf.

In exchange for the rights granted by license, the licensee must meet certain responsibilities concerning the distribution of licensed source code. Covered source code files must remain under the MPL, and distributors &quot;may not attempt to alter or restrict recipients&#x27; rights&quot; to it. The MPL treats the source code file as the boundary between MPL-licensed and proprietary parts, meaning that all or none of the code in a given source file falls under the MPL. An executable consisting solely of MPL-covered files may be sublicensed, but the licensee must ensure access to or provide all the source code within it. Recipients can combine licensed source code with other files under a different, even proprietary license, thereby forming a &quot;larger work&quot; which can be distributed under any terms, but again the MPL-covered source files must be made freely available. This makes the MPL a compromise between the MIT or BSD licenses, which permit all derived works to be relicensed as proprietary, and the GPL, which requires the derived work as a whole to be licensed under the GPL. By allowing proprietary modules in derived projects while requiring core files to remain open source, the MPL is designed to motivate both businesses and the open-source community to help develop core software.

The one exception to covered source files remaining under the MPL occurs when code under version 2.0 or later is combined with separate code files under the GNU GPL, GNU Lesser GPL (LGPL), or Affero GPL (AGPL). In this case, the program as a whole will be under the chosen GNU license, but the MPL-covered files will be dual-licensed, so that recipients can choose to distribute them under that GNU License or the MPL. The initial author of MPL code may choose to opt out of this GPL compatibility by adding a notice to its source files.

It is explicitly granted that MPL-covered code may be distributed under the terms of the license version under which it was received or any later version. If code under version 1.0 or 1.1 is upgraded to version 2.0 by this mechanism, the 1.x-covered code must be marked with the aforementioned GPL-incompatible notice. The MPL can be modified to form a new license, provided that said license does not refer to Mozilla or Netscape.

==History==
Version 1.0 of the MPL was written by Mitchell Baker in 1998 while working as a lawyer at Netscape Communications Corporation. Netscape was hoping that an open-source strategy for developing its own Netscape web browser would allow it to compete better with Microsoft&#x27;s browser, Internet Explorer. To cover the browser&#x27;s code, the company drafted a license known as the Netscape Public License (NPL), which included a clause allowing even openly developed code to be theoretically relicensed as proprietary.

However, at the same time, Baker developed a second license similar to the NPL. It was called the Mozilla Public License after Netscape&#x27;s project name for the new open-source codebase, and, although it was originally only intended for software that supplemented core modules covered by the NPL, it would become much more popular than the NPL and eventually earn approval from the Open Source Initiative.

Less than a year later, Baker and the Mozilla Organization would make some changes to the MPL, resulting in version 1.1, a minor update. This revision was done through an open process that considered comments from both institutional and individual contributors. The primary goals were to clarify terms regarding patents and allow for multiple licensing. This last feature was meant to encourage cooperation with developers that preferred stricter licenses like the GPL. Not only would many projects derive their own licenses from this version, but its structure, legal precision, and explicit terms for patent rights would strongly influence later revisions of popular licenses like the GPL (version 3).

Both versions 1.0 and 1.1 are incompatible with the GPL, which led the Free Software Foundation to discourage using version 1.1. For these reasons, earlier versions of Firefox were released under multiple licenses: the MPL 1.1, GPL 2.0, and LGPL 2.1. Some old software, such as the Mozilla Application Suite, is still under the three licenses. Therefore, in early 2010, after more than a decade without modification, an open process for creating version 2.0 of the MPL began. Over the next 21 months, the MPL was not only changed to make the license clearer and easier to apply, but also to achieve compatibility with the GPL and Apache licenses. The revision team was overseen by Baker and led by Luis Villa with key support from Gervase Markham and Harvey Anderson. They would publish three alpha drafts, two beta drafts, and two release candidates for comment before releasing the final draft of version 2.0 on January 3, 2012.

<doc id="608540" wikidata="Q12295746" url="?curid=608540" title="Stuart Davis (musician)">
<text>Stuart Davis (born January 11, 1971) is an American contemporary musician and songwriter. He has been performing throughout the United States and Europe since 1993. Davis regularly works with music producer Alex Gibson, who produced his last five studio albums.

In 2009, TV channel HDNet broadcast the first six-episode season of &quot;Sex, God, Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;, a comedy sketch show written, directed, and hosted by Davis; a second season with Davis and co-host Kandyse McClure began airing in 2012. Davis is a contributing member of philosopher Ken Wilber&#x27;s Integral Institute, and appears as a fictionalized character in Wilber&#x27;s novel Boomeritis. His single &quot;Already Free&quot; (2008) was featured as the end theme of the Showtime series &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe I&#x27;m Still Single&quot;, and was also used in the feature film Drillbit Taylor. A precursor to the HDNet series &quot;Sex, God, Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; existed in the form of a 12-part web series, &quot;The Stuart Davis Show&quot; (2007), select episodes of which were co-written with Steven Brill.

Ken Wilber has called Davis &quot;the finest singer/songwriter of his generation&quot;.

==Early life==
Stuart Evan Davis was born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1971, the youngest of three brothers. His family moved to Lakeville, Minnesota when he was a young boy, and he was formally introduced to music when his father got him a guitar and taught him three chords. By the time he had graduated high school he&#x27;d recorded his first album and was soon playing shows around Minnesota. Early influences include: Elvis Costello, Richard Thompson, XTC, and Bob Dylan.

==Musical career==

===1990s===
The first two albums in the Stuart Davis catalogue, &quot;Idiot Express&quot; and &quot;Big Energy Dream&quot;, are social and romantic critiques featuring simple acoustic guitar progressions and minimal instrumentation characteristic of folk music. His third release, &quot;Self-Untitled&quot;, received airplay on some alternative and public stations with the songs &quot;Universe Communion&quot; and &quot;Only Changing Drugs&quot;.

With his fourth album, &quot;Nomen Est Numen&quot;, Davis shed his folk roots. The music featured driving bass lines, electric guitars, and richer vocal harmonies characteristic of alternative/pop, and lyrically it was more intellectual and subversive.

Between &quot;Nomen Est Numen&quot; and his fifth album, &quot;Kid Mystic&quot;, two important events happened to Davis. First, he was introduced to Zen Buddhism by his drummer Dave King, and became a practitioner of zazen, or sitting meditation. The second was his discovery of the book &quot;Sex, Ecology, Spirituality&quot;, by Ken Wilber. Their influence would soon send Davis on an entirely new trajectory.

As the title implies, on &quot;Kid Mystic&quot; Davis begins to explore some ethereal territory. The pace and structure of the songs are much different, and the lyrics are more image-conscious and laced with metaphor. Death and dying play a major role, implicitly or explicitly, on a majority of the tracks, and instead of playing as simply a collection of songs, it is more a unitive work.

The tagline of his subsequent studio album, &quot;Bright Apocalypse&quot;, is &quot;13 Songs About God&quot;, and uses some of the same structural and thematic material. The thirteen songs construct a sort of dialogue with the divine; much of the album is sung in second person, and in several of the songs the divine speaks back in whispers.

===2000s===
His eponymous seventh album, popularly known as the &quot;Silver Album&quot; or &quot;Silver/Naked&quot;, for its cover art featuring a nude Davis adorned in silver paint, is built around a trilogy of songs that close the album called &quot;Dive&quot;, &quot;Swim&quot;, and &quot;Drown&quot;. They were inspired by the book &quot;Grace and Grit&quot;, another work by Ken Wilber, and &quot;tell the story of a soul going back home.&quot; The album also contains the song &quot;Ladder&quot;, which is featured as the bumper music on Wilber&#x27;s audio program &quot;Kosmic Consciousness&quot;.

Beginning in 2003, Davis began working with Alex Gibson, who produced that year&#x27;s &quot;Bell&quot;. Gibson was able to procure the services of drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. (Lady Gaga, Paul McCartney, Paul Simon), and Davis&#x27;s affiliation with Gibson would continue to give him access to some of the most accomplished session musicians in the industry.

&quot;Bell&quot; was followed by &quot;¿What&quot;, a radical sonic departure in the Davis discography, which features performance poetry by Saul Williams on &quot;April Showers, April Tears&quot;, beat-boxing on &quot;Easter&quot;, house-influenced synth bass lines on &quot;Dirty Purity&quot;, dissonant sampled loops on &quot;Voodoo Dolls&quot;, and the spare, haiku-like &quot;Glass&quot;. &quot;¿What&quot; is filled with haunting effects and vocals throughout, and features songs mostly composed of sampled loops and sequenced rhythms. He expressed the wish to make a video with actress Parker Posey for his song &quot;Parker Posey&quot;, which tells the story about a condescending director pitching a movie role to Posey that is beneath her ability, so he can break her into the upper echelon of Hollywood A-list actresses.

His next album, &quot;Something Simple&quot;, leads off with the single &quot;Already Free&quot;, which was featured as the end theme of the Showtime series &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe I’m Still Single&quot;, and was also used in the movie Drillbit Taylor. It peaked at 154 on the Billboard singles chart in 2008. Davis worked with a new roster of musicians for this project, including Wendy Melvoin on guitar, Ed Kowalczyk on backing vocals, and Sean Hurley (John Mayer, Pitbull) on bass. Hurley previously contributed on &quot;¿What&quot;.

Joe Viglione noted the influence of Al Green and Elvis Costello on &quot;Something Simple&quot; and wrote that the song &quot;Deity Freak&quot; &quot;is as infectious as it gets.&quot; He wrote that &quot;Something Simple&quot; &quot;demands a number of spins before it reveals itself and some of the mystery still remains, which is the kind of intangible quality usually indicating that something special is going on.&quot;

===2010s===
After taking a few years off from music to concentrate on his television and screenwriting projects, Davis went back into the studio with a new band to record &quot;Music For Mortals&quot;. The album features a collection of songs written over the course of the last year of his father&#x27;s life, and explores themes found in several &quot;books of the dead.&quot; Once again it was produced and engineered by Alex Gibson (David Lee Roth, Sting, Ben Folds), and features musicians Blair Sinta (Alanis Morissette, Annie Lennox) on drums, Joel Shearer (Christina Aguilera, Dido) on guitar, Justin Meldal-Johnsen (Tori Amos, Beck) on bass, and Nathan Jenkins (Beyoncé, Slim Thug) on various instruments, electronic programming, additional production &amp; engineering. The first single from the album is called &quot;Beautiful Place&quot;.

==Television career==
In 2006 Davis created a 12-episode web series for the website Integral Naked called The Stuart Davis Show. It features Stuart and two &quot;clones&quot; that represent competing and divergent voices of his personality. The show deals with subjects such as open marriage, Death Day, The Secret, and the tragedy at Virginia Tech.

After completing a year of The Stuart Davis Show, Davis began developing a new venture called Sex, God, Rock &#x27;n Roll. While his first series was a loosely designed and spiritually influenced topical sitcom, the new show followed a more conventionally formatted late-night talk show with an opening monologue, news segment, and interview, with occasional pre-recorded parody commercials. It was picked up by Mark Cuban&#x27;s network HDNet for the 2009 television season and ran for 6 episodes. The televised version omitted the interview segments, but these were included as extras on the season&#x27;s home video release.

For season 2, Davis redesigned the show into five segments including the Sexy Word (with Mariann Gavelo of &quot;Casa de mi padre&quot;), news (with co-host Kandyse McClure of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;), musical studio performance, Rocktails (McClure), and closing monologue. One of the high points of season 2 was a sit-down interview with Kermit the Frog. Among other topics the two discussed Kermit&#x27;s new movie (&quot;The Muppets&quot;), sex life, and spiritual practice. Season 2 ran for 6 episodes in the winter of 2012 on HDNet.

==Other artistic pursuits==

===Constructed language===
Davis is the developer of a constructed language called &quot;Is&quot;. Among its unique characteristics are that words are &quot;conjugated in altitudes,&quot; or levels of consciousness.

===Calligraphy===
Davis paints calligraphy, often using the medium to explore his fascination with crows. One of the most common styles he employs is to paint the crows using tiny strokes composed of his constructed language Is. Because of the microstroke method, these paintings can take a long time to complete. He also typically burns the edges so that they have an uneven and charred perimeter.

===Books and screenplays===
Davis also has written several screenplays, one of them with Steven Brill, and published an audiobook called Love Has No Opposite, which he describes, in the introduction, as a tome that &quot;some might consider a Blog-ography...a biography minus sequence, thematic continuity, and facts.&quot;

A book with a title similar to his television program, &quot;Sex, God, Rock &#x27;n Roll: Sacred Comedy for Profane Sensibilities&quot;, remains unpublished but is the source of many of the spoken word segments read by Davis at shows in 2012. A foreword to the book is contributed by philosopher Ken Wilber.

==Personal life==
Davis has long been an advocate of the probability of extraterrestrial life, in part fostered by his friendship with the late John E. Mack, and his fascination with the subject has manifested in the songs &quot;Universe Communion&quot;, &quot;Shades of Grey&quot; and &quot;They’re Already Here&quot;. He discussed his esoteric viewpoints as a guest on the late-night radio show Coast to Coast AM in 2012.

He has served as a charter member of Ken Wilber&#x27;s spiritual think-tank Integral Institute (II), and was a contributor to II&#x27;s multimedia sister site Integral Naked.

Davis grew up in Minnesota before moving to Boulder, Colorado. Most recently he moved to Amsterdam where he is living a comfortable house-boat with his wife and two daughters while he focuses on other pursuits such as his writing.

<text>Miniature golf (also known as minigolf, putt-putt, crazy golf, and by several other names) is an offshoot of the sport of golf focusing solely on the putting aspect of its parent game. The aim of the game is to score the lowest number of points. It is played on courses consisting of a series of holes (usually a multiple of 9) similar to those of its parent, but the courses are characterized by their short length (usually within 10 metres from tee to cup).

The game uses artificial putting surfaces (such as carpet, artificial turf, or concrete), a geometric layout often requiring non-traditional putting lines such as bank shots, and artificial obstacles such as tunnels, tubes, ramps, moving obstacles like windmills, and walls made of concrete, metal, or fiberglass. When miniature golf retains many of these characteristics but without the use of any props or obstacles, it is purely a mini version of its parent game.


==Nomenclature==
While the World Minigolf Sport Federation (WMF) prefers to use the name &quot;minigolf&quot;, the game has several other names which vary between countries, including &quot;mini-golf&quot;, &quot;midget golf&quot;, &quot;goofy golf&quot;, &quot;shorties&quot;, &quot;extreme golf&quot;, &quot;crazy golf&quot;, &quot;adventure golf&quot;, &quot;mini-putt&quot;, and &quot;putter golf&quot;. The name Putt-Putt is the trademark of an American company that builds and franchises miniature golf courses in addition to other family-oriented entertainment. The term &quot;putt-putt&quot; is sometimes used colloquially to refer to the game itself. The term &quot;minigolf&quot; was formerly a registered trademark of a Swedish company that built its own patented type of minigolf courses.

==History==
Geometrically shaped minigolf courses made of artificial materials (carpet) began to emerge during the early 20th century. The earliest documented mention of such a course is in the June 8, 1912, edition of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, which introduces a minigolf course called the Gofstacle.

The first standardized minigolf courses to enter commercial mass-production were the Thistle Dhu (&quot;This&#x27;ll Do&quot;) course in 1916 in Pinehurst, North Carolina, and the 1927 Tom Thumb patent of Garnet Carter from Lookout Mountain, Tennessee. Thomas McCullough Fairbairn, a golf fanatic, revolutionized the game in 1922 with his formulation of a suitable artificial green—a mixture of cottonseed hulls, sand, oil, and dye. With this discovery, miniature golf became accessible everywhere; by the late 1920s there were over 150 rooftop courses in New York City alone and tens of thousands across the United States. This American minigolf boom of early 20th century came to an end during the Great Depression in the late 1930s. Nearly all minigolf courses in the United States were closed and demolished before the end of the 1930s. A rare surviving example from this period is the Parkside Whispering Pines Miniature Golf Course located near Rochester, New York, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

The first miniature golf course in Canada was at the Maples Inn in Pointe-Claire, Quebec. The &quot;Mapes&quot; was constructed as a summer home in the 1890s but was renovated into a club in 1902, opened to the public in 1914, and had a miniature golf course in 1930. The popular nightspot burned in 1985.

===European origins===

One of the first documented minigolf courses in mainland Europe was built in 1926 by a man surnamed Schröder in Hamburg, Germany. Schröder had been inspired by his visit to the United States, where he had seen minigolf courses spreading across the country.

In 1930 Edwin O. Norrman and Eskil Norman returned to Sweden from the United States, where they had stayed for several years and witnessed the golden days of the American minigolf boom. In 1931 they founded the company &quot;Norman och Norrmans Miniatyrgolf&quot; and began manufacturing standardized minigolf courses for the Swedish market. During the following years they spread this new leisure activity across Sweden, by installing minigolf courses in public parks and other suitable locations.

Swedish minigolf courses typically had a rectangular wooden frame surrounding the playing area made of tennis field sand; in contrast, American manufacturers used newly developed and patented felt as the surface of their minigolf courses. Felt did not become popular as a surface material in Sweden until in the mid-1960s—but since then it has become practically the only surface material used in Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, due to its favorable playing qualities in wet weather. Minigolf courses with a felt surface can be played in rainy weather, because water soaks through the felt into the ground. The other commonly used surface materials, concrete and fibre-cement, cannot be used in rainy weather, because the rainwater pools on them, stopping the ball from rolling.

The Swedish Minigolf Federation (Svenska Bangolfförbundet) was founded in 1937, making it the oldest minigolf sport organization in the world. National Swedish championships in minigolf have been played yearly since 1939. In other countries minigolf sport federations were not founded until the late 1950s, due to the post-war economical depression.

In 1954, the minigolf course in Ascona, Switzerland, opened. It is the oldest course in the world which follows the norms of Paul Bongni.

===Competitive games===
The earliest documented minigolf competitions were played in the United States. The first National Tom Thumb Open minigolf tournament was arranged in 1930, with a total cash purse $10,000 (the top prize being $2,000). Qualification play-offs were played in all of the 48 states, and the final competition on Lookout Mountain, Chattanooga, Tennessee, attracted over 200 players representing thirty states. After the Depression ten years later, minigolf died out as a competition sport in America, and has begun to recover only during the most recent decades. The American minigolf sport boom of the 1930s inspired many European countries, and the sport of minigolf lived on in Europe even after the American game fell into Depression.

===Post-depression U.S.===
In 1938 Joseph and Robert Taylor from Binghamton, New York, started building and operating their own miniature golf courses. These courses differed from the ones in the late 20s and early 30s; they were no longer just rolls, banks, and curves, with an occasional pipe thrown in. Their courses not only had landscaping, but also obstacles, including windmills, castles, and wishing wells.

Impressed by the quality of the courses, many customers asked if the Taylors would build a course for them. By the early 1940s, Joe and Bob formed Taylor Brothers, and were in the business of building miniature golf courses and supplying obstacles to the industry. During both the Korean and Vietnam Wars, many a G.I. played on a Taylor Brothers prefabricated course that the U.S. Military had contracted to be built and shipped overseas. In the 1950s, Don Clayton invented the Putt-Putt brand with a focus on treating minigolf seriously, emphasizing skill and player improvement. Most of the Putt Putt routes were 2-par holes involving ramps or angled blocks that could be mastered in one go through practice.

By the late 1950s, almost all supply catalogs carried Taylor Brother&#x27;s obstacles. In 1961, Bob Taylor, Don Clayton of Putt-Putt, and Frank Abramoff of Arnold Palmer Miniature Golf organised the first miniature golf association known as NAPCOMS (or the &quot;National Association of Putting Course Operators, Manufacturers, and Suppliers&quot;). Their first meeting was held in New York City. Though this organization only lasted a few years it was the first attempt to bring miniature golf operators together to promote miniature golf.

In 1955, Lomma Golf, Inc., founded by Al Lomma and his brother Ralph Lomma, led the revival of wacky, animated trick hazards. These hazards required both accurately aimed shots and split-second timing to avoid spinning windmill blades, revolving statuary, and other careening obstacles.

The book, &quot;Tilting At Windmills: How I Tried To Stop Worrying And Love Sport&quot;, by Andy Miller tells the story of the formerly sports-hating author attempting to change by competing in miniature golf, including events in Denmark and Latvia.

In the United States, National Miniature Golf Day is held yearly on the second Saturday of May. The event had its inaugural celebration on May 12, 2007, and was officially recognized and published in 2008&#x27;s edition of &quot;Chase&#x27;s Calendar of Events&quot;.

===Other countries===
By the 1950s the American Putt-Putt company was exporting their minigolf courses to South Africa, Australia, Japan, Korea, India, Iran, Italy, Pakistan, Argentina, Brazil, and the Eastern Bloc.

==Governing body==

The sport of miniature golf is governed internationally by the World Minigolf Sport Federation (WMF), headquartered in Göteborg, Sweden. The WMF was a member of Global Association of International Sports Federations, before its dissolution, and within it, of the Alliance of Independent Recognized Members of Sport (AIMS). WMF is also member of the Association for International Sport for All (TAFISA).

It organizes World Championships for youth and elite players, and Continental Championships in Europe, Asia and the United States, held in alternate years.

===WMF Members===

==Course types==
All competitions approved by World Minigolfsport Federation are played on standardized courses, whose design has been checked to be suitable for competitive play. The WMF currently approves four different course types:
* Beton (abbreviated B, sometimes called &quot;Bongni&quot; and named after Paul Bongni of Geneva, Switzerland, &quot;Minigolf&quot; or &quot;Abteilung 1&quot;)
* Eternite (abbreviated E (in Sweden EB), sometimes called &quot;Europabana&quot;, &quot;Miniaturgolf&quot; or &quot;Abteilung 2&quot;)
* Felt (abbreviated F or SFR, sometimes called &quot;Swedish felt runs&quot;), and
* Minigolf Open Standard (abbreviated &quot;MOS&quot;). The latter non-standardized playing system, MOS, covers all minigolf courses that the three standardized systems (B, E, F) do not cover.

== Course features ==
The final holes (often the 18th hole or a bonus ) of many miniature golf courses are designed to capture the ball, effectively preventing the player from playing additional rounds without purchasing another game. This may be accomplished with a &quot;drain&quot; or trap-door hole setup that channels the ball to a lockbox.

The 19th hole on miniature golf courses is often a hole in which if a hole-in-one is scored, one receives a free game. One popular method of theming the 18th hole in the United States is to use a gated, ramped target area depicting the face of a clown; if the ball lands &quot;in&quot; the clown&#x27;s nose, a bell may sound and the player would win a discount ticket for another game. Another method for capturing the ball incorporated by various adventure golf courses involves a tube that sucks and propels the ball with pressurized air to a collection area or another area of the course typically on a higher elevation.

==Competitions==
The world record on one round of minigolf is 18 strokes on 18 holes. More than a thousand players have officially achieved this score on eternite. On other playing systems, a perfect round of 18 holes-in-one is extremely rare, and has never been scored in an official national or international tournament. Unofficial 18-rounds on concrete and felt courses have been reported in Sweden.

Nearly all European countries have an official national federation for promoting minigolf as a competition sport. The bi-annual European Championships attract competitors from more than twenty European countries. As of 2012, Chris Beattie has been the holder of the European Championship title. Outside Europe only a small number of countries have participated in international minigolf competitions. These countries include the United States, Japan, China, India and Taiwan. A national minigolf federation exists also in Moldova, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, but none of these countries has ever participated in international competitions, and probably are not arranging many domestic competitions either.

World Minigolfsport Federation represents some 40,000 registered competition players from 37 countries. The national minigolf federation of Germany has 11,000 members with a competing license, and the Swedish federation has 8,000 registered competition players. Other strong minigolf countries include Austria and Switzerland, each having a few thousand licensed competition players. Also Italy, Czech Republic and Netherlands have traditionally been able to send a strong team to international championships, even if they cannot count their licensed players in thousands.

The sceptre of competitive minigolf rests quite firmly in mainland Europe: no player from other countries (such as UK, the United States, Japan et cetera) has ever reached even the top 50 in World Championships (in men&#x27;s category). Nearly all national federations outside Europe were founded only quite recently (within the last ten years), and it will take time before the players of these countries learn all secrets of the game. The United States has a longer history of minigolf competitions, but the standardized European competition courses are practically unknown in the United States, and therefore the American players have been unable to learn the secrets of European minigolf. On the traditional American courses the best American players are able to challenge the European top players into a tough and exciting competition.

The British Minigolf Association (BMGA) has an additional problem on their way to greater success in competitive minigolf. While the minigolf federations in mainland Europe receive annual funding from the government, in England the national sports organization Sport England has refused to accept BMGA as its member – which means that BMGA is left without the public funding that other forms of sports enjoy. The rules of Sport England declare that only one variant of each sport can be accepted as member – and minigolf is interpreted as a variant of golf.

The most prize money is paid in the United States, where the winner of a major competition may earn up to $5,000. In mainland Europe the prize money generally quite low, and in many cases honor is the only thing at stake in the competition. International championships usually award no prize money at all.

In the US there are two organizations offering national tournaments: the Professional Putters Association and the US Pro Mini-Golf Association (USPMGA). The USPMGA represents the United States in the World Minigolfsport Federation, having been an active member since 1995. USPMGA President Robert Detwiler is also the WMF representative for North and South America.

The New Israeli Minigolf Association was established in February 2010 in Israel. Setting up, for the first time, league play according to the rules of WMF and USPMGA. Now, a series of lush and inviting minigolf parks in prime locations are being built around Israel.

===International===

World Minigolfsport Federation (WMF), a member of AGFIS, organizes World Championships biennially (on odd-numbered years), while the continental championships in Europe and Asia are organized on even-numbered years. Many of these competitions are arranged for three age groups: juniors (under 20 years), adults (no age limit), and seniors (over 45 years). Men and women compete separately in their own categories, except in some team competitions and pair competitions. The difference in the playing skills of men and women is very small at the top level. Sometimes the best player in a major international tournament is female. Typically the winner in women&#x27;s category would be very close to medals also in men&#x27;s category.

World and European Championships have so far never been arranged on MOS courses (which are popular in the United States and UK, and were approved by WMF for competition use only a few years ago). International competitions are typically arranged on two courses of 18 holes, of which one course is eternite, and the other course is usually concrete, less commonly felt. In the future, the WMF is expected to use also MOS courses in international championships – which will give American and British players a chance to show their skills on their own traditional course types.

<text>Limbo is a popular game, based on traditions that originated on the island of Tobago. The aim is to pass forwards under a low bar without falling or dislodging the bar.

The dance originated as an event that took place at wakes in Tobago. It was popularized in the 1950s by dance pioneer Julia Edwards (known as the First Lady of Limbo) and her company which appeared in several films, in particular &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; (1957), and toured widely in the Caribbean, Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Africa in the 1960s and later.

==Rules==
A horizontal bar, known as the limbo bar, is supported by two vertical bars. All contestants must attempt to go under the bar with their backs facing toward the floor. When passing under the bar, players must bend backwards. No part of their body is allowed to touch the bar, and no part other than their feet may touch the ground. They must not turn their head or neck to the side. Whoever knocks the bar off or falls is eliminated. After everyone has passed under the bar in this manner, the bar is lowered slightly and the contest continues. The contest ends when only one person can pass under the bar.

==History==
The word &#x27;limbo&#x27; dates back to the 1950s. It is conjectured that limbo is a West Indian English derivative of &#x27;limber&#x27;. Merriam–Webster lists the etymology as &quot;English of Tobago &amp; Barbados; akin to Jamaican English &quot;limba&quot; to bend, from English &quot;limber&quot;&quot;. 
This game is also used as a funeral game and may be related to the African legba or legua game.Consistent with certain African beliefs, the game reflects the whole cycle of life...The players move under a pole that is gradually lowered from chest level and they emerge on the other side as their heads clear the pole as in the triumph of life over death.

The limbo dates back to the mid to late 1800s in Tobago. It achieved mainstream popularity during the 1950s. An alternative explanation of the name is suggested; that the version of the limbo performed in nineteenth century Tobago was meant to symbolize slaves entering the galleys of a slave ship, or a spirit crossing over into the afterworld, or &quot;limbo&quot;, but no literary reference is known to substantiate this postulated linkage.

Dr Alan Rice elaborates on the supposed link the game has with the slave trade: &quot;Africans were forced to game on deck for exercise. Many took advantage of this to bond and communicate with their shipmates by dancing steps remembered from their past in Africa. This was to continue in the Americas in games, religious ceremonies and other musical forms that used cultural traditions from Africa. One such game was the limbo in the Caribbean. The limbo spoke directly of the limited space in the slaving ships and the African ability to escape it.&quot;

==Popularization==
 
Traditionally, the limbo game began at the lowest possible bar height and the bar was gradually raised, signifying an emergence from death into life. In its adaptation to the world of entertainment, troupes began reversing the traditional order. According to a 1956 newspaper report, the game was revived in 1944 by Edric Connor. It became a popular entertainment in Trinidad and was adopted as a physical fitness exercise by American troops. In the 1950s, choreographer and player Julia Edwards added a number of features that are now considered standard, such as human &#x27;bars&#x27; formed by the limbs of other players and the use of fire in the performance of limbo. A film, &quot;Julia and Joyce&quot;, by Trinidadian-American Sonja Dumas, was released in 2010. It traces the evolution of limbo dancing and the contribution of Edwards to its popularity.

Limbo players generally move and respond to a number of specific Afro-Caribbean drum patterns. As Limbo gained popularity as a tourist activity and a form of entertainment, pop music began using Caribbean rhythms to respond to the emerging craze in the United States. One example is the song &quot;Limbo Rock&quot; (recorded by Chubby Checker), which became a number 2 charted hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100, from which emerged the popular quote/chant that is associated with limbo which Checker also helped to popularize: &quot;How low can you go?&quot; Limbo was brought into the mainstream by Trinidadian Calypsonian Brigo (Samuel Abrahams) with his popular Soca song &quot;Limbo Break&quot;.

Limbo is considered the unofficial national game of Trinidad and Tobago, which refers to itself as the land of limbo, steelpan (steel drums), and calypso. After a preparatory game, the player prepares and approaches the bar, lowering and leaning back their body while balancing on feet akimbo with knees extended backwards. The player is declared &quot;out&quot; and loses the contest if any part of the body touches the stick or pole that they are passing beneath, or if the hands touch the floor. When several players compete, they go under the stick in single-file; the stick is gradually lowered until only one player, who has not touched either the pole or the floor, remains.

As Limbo spread out of Trinidad and Tobago to the wider world and the big screen, limbo became a major part of the tourism package in several other Caribbean islands, such as Barbados and Jamaica. In Jamaica, the trendy limbo music of the 1950s was often based on a clave rhythm. It is also widely heard in Jamaican mento recorded in the 1950s, in songs such as &quot;Limbo&quot; by Lord Tickler and Calypsonians, or &quot;Limbo&quot; by Denzil Laing &amp; the Wrigglers, as well as many other songs not directly related to the limbo game itself. Limbo&#x27;s continued significance in Trinidadian and Tobagonian culture ia clearly demonstrated in festivals and social events across the two islands, including performances by popular game troupes at the Prime Minister&#x27;s Best Village Competition, and during the Carnival season in Trinidad and Tobago.

When performing for tourists, professional limbo players often invite spectators to participate after their own presentation of the game. The massive popularity of limbo has emerged directly from this audience participation. In recent years, limbo dancing has been conducted as a social &quot;icebreaker&quot; game for tourists at Caribbean and other tropical resorts. The winning player often receives a prize.

==World record==
The world record for lowest limbo game is held by Dennis Walston, who successfully attempted a bar in March 1991.

The world record for lowest female limbo game is held by Shemika Charles, a 26-year-old woman from Trinidad who lives in Buffalo, NY. On 16 September 2010, she successfully played under a bar above the ground.

Shemika Charles-Campbell also holds her second world record for the Farthest Distance Limbo Under 12 inches. The record setting limbo was completed under vehicles and measured a distance of 12.67 ft (3.8 meters). The record was attained on 9 October 2020 in her home country Trinidad and Tobago.

<text>Brent East is a parliamentary constituency in north west London; it was replaced by Brent Central for the 2010 general election. It returned one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post system.

Further to the completion of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the seat was re-established for the 2024 general election, largely based on the existing Brent Central constituency.

== History ==
The constituency was created in 1974 and was first contested at the February general election of that year. An ethnically diverse area, it was previously one of the Labour Party&#x27;s safest seats in London. It was held by Reg Freeson from 1974 to 1987, then by Ken Livingstone (following the abolition of the Greater London Council, of which he was leader, in 1986).

After Livingstone was expelled from the Labour Party for standing as an independent candidate for Mayor of London in 2000, he represented the constituency as an independent until standing down as an MP in 2001 to concentrate on his position as Mayor. Labour regained the seat at the 2001 general election, with Paul Daisley holding the seat until his death two years later.

The resulting Brent East by-election was held on 18 September 2003, with the 2003 Invasion of Iraq as a background. Labour lost the seat to Sarah Teather of the Liberal Democrats, with a considerable 29% swing, having come from a distant third place in 2001. Teather retained the seat at the 2005 general election, with a majority of 2,712 votes and a swing of 30.7% from Labour to the Liberal Democrats compared to the previous general election.

== Boundaries ==

=== Historic ===
The original constituency was one of three covering the London Borough of Brent in north-west London, covering the areas of Brondesbury, Dollis Hill, Kilburn and Neasden, as well as parts of Willesden and Cricklewood.

1974–1983: The London Borough of Brent wards of Brentwater, Brondesbury Park, Carlton, Church End, Cricklewood, Gladstone, Kilburn, Mapesbury, Queen&#x27;s Park, and Willesden Green.

1983–2010: The London Borough of Brent wards of Brentwater, Brondesbury Park, Carlton, Chamberlayne, Church End, Cricklewood, Gladstone, Kilburn, Mapesbury, Queen&#x27;s Park, and Willesden Green.

=== Current ===
Further to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, which came into effect for the 2024 general election, the constituency is composed of the following wards of the London Borough of Brent:

* Brondesbury Park; Cricklewood &amp; Mapesbury; Dollis Hill; Kingsbury; Roundwood; Stonebridge; Welsh Harp; Willesden Green.

&quot;The re-established seat primarily comprises the majority of the abolished Brent Central constituencies, with Brondesbury Park and Kingsbury wards coming from the abolished constituencies of Hampstead and Kilburn, and Brent North respectively.&quot;

<doc id="608564" wikidata="Q7428644" url="?curid=608564" title="Sawing-off of Manhattan Island">
<text>The sawing-off of [[Manhattan Island]] is an urban legend about New York City that is largely unverified. It describes a practical joke allegedly perpetrated in 1824, by a retired ship carpenter named Lozier. According to the story, in the 1820s a rumor began circulating among city merchants that the weight of the urban district was causing the southern section of Manhattan Island to sink, near the Battery. It was believed that by cutting the island, towing it out, rotating it 180 degrees, and putting it back in place that Manhattan would be stabilized, and that the thin part of the island could be condemned. The main concern was not the futility of the idea but of Long Island&#x27;s being in the way. Lozier finally assembled a large workforce and logistical support. At a massive groundbreaking ceremony, Lozier did not show up, but hid in Brooklyn and did not return for months.

The story did not appear in any known newspapers (although the press supposedly did not report on such pranks in that era) and no records have been found to confirm the existence of the individuals involved. This has led to speculation that the incident never occurred and the original report of the hoax was itself a hoax, which is the conclusion Joel Rose suggests in his book, &quot;New York Sawed in Half: An Urban Historical&quot; (2001). The hoax was first documented in Thomas F. De Voe&#x27;s (1811–1892) volume &quot;The Market Book&quot; (1862), as conveyed by his uncle who was Lozier&#x27;s supposed associate, and was told again in Herbert Asbury&#x27;s work &quot;All Around The Town: Murder, Scandal, Riot and Mayhem in Old New York&quot; (1934, reissued as a Sequel to &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;). Another condensed retelling occurs in the 1960s Reader&#x27;s Digest book, &quot;Scoundrels and Scallywags: 51 Stories of the Most Fascinating Characters of Hoax and Fraud&quot; (1968).

<doc id="608565" wikidata="Q1337316" url="?curid=608565" title="Korah">
<text>Korah ( &quot;Qōraḥ&quot;; &quot;Qārūn&quot;), son of Izhar, is an individual who appears in the Biblical Book of Numbers of the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) and four different verses in the Quran, known for leading a rebellion against Moses. Some older English translations, as well as the Douay–Rheims Bible, spell the name Core, and many Eastern European translations have &quot;Korak&quot; or &quot;Korey&quot;.

The name Korah is also used for at least one other individual in the Hebrew Bible: Korah (son of Esau).

== In the Torah ==
===Genealogy===
Exodus cites Korah as being the son of Izhar, son of Kehath, son of Levi. lists his three sons. Korah&#x27;s brothers through Izhar were Nepheg and Zichri. connects this Korah with Hebron, Uzziel and Amram, who were his father&#x27;s brothers (Izhar son of Kohath). 1 Chronicles , and , repeat this genealogy; however, this reference could have been inspired by the Exodus genealogies.

Numbers traces this lineage back further to Levi, son of the patriarch Israel. According to , his lineage runs: &quot;Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kehath, the son of Levi&quot;, making him the great-grandson of the patriarch Levi and the first cousin of Moses and Aaron.

===Rebellion===
 indicates that Korah rebelled against Moses along with Dathan and Abiram and 250 co-conspirators. The 250 co-conspirators were punished for their rebellion when they offered incense to God in fire pans and the heavenly fire from the incense pans consumed all 250 of them. Korah from the tribe of Levi and his allies Dathan and Abiram from the tribe of Reuben were also punished when God caused the ground to split open beneath their feet swallowing them, their families, anyone associated with Korah, and all their possessions.

Furthermore, the Israelites who did not like what had happened to Korah, Dathan and Abiram (and their families) objected to Moses, and God then commanded Moses to depart from the multitude. God then smote 14,700 men with plague, as punishment for objecting to Korah&#x27;s destruction (ff.)

&quot;Notwithstanding, the children of Korah died not&quot; ().

==In rabbinical literature==
The rabbis of the Talmudic era explained the name &quot;Korah&quot; as meaning &quot;baldness.&quot; It was given to Korah on account of the gap or blank which he made in Israel by his revolt. Korah is represented as the possessor of extraordinary wealth, having discovered one of the treasures that Joseph had hidden in Egypt. The keys of Korah&#x27;s treasuries alone formed a load for 300 mules. He and Haman were the two richest men in the world, and both died on account of their greed, and because their riches were not the gift of Heaven. On the other hand, Korah is represented as a wise man, chief of his family and as one of the Kohathites who carried the Ark of the Covenant on their shoulders.

===Cause of revolt===
According to the Rabbis, the main cause of Korah&#x27;s revolt was the nomination of Elizaphan, son of Uzziel, as prince over the Kohathites, Korah arguing thus: &quot;Kohath had four sons. The two sons of Amram, Kohath&#x27;s eldest son, took for themselves the kingdom and the priesthood. Now, as I am the son of Kohath&#x27;s second son, I should be made prince over the Kohathites; however Moses gave that office to Elizaphan, the son of Kohath&#x27;s youngest son&quot;.

Korah asked Moses the following questions: &quot;Does a tallit made entirely of tekhelet need fringes?&quot; To Moses&#x27; affirmative answer, Korah objected: &quot;The blue color of the ṭallit does not make it ritually correct, yet according to your statement four blue threads do so&quot;. &quot;Does a house filled with the books of the Law need a mezuzah?&quot; Moses replied that it did; whereupon Korah said: &quot;The presence of the whole Torah, which contains 175 chapters, does not make a house fit for habitation, yet you say that one chapter of it does so. It is not from God that you have received these commandments; you have invented them yourself.&quot; He then assembled 250 men, chiefs of the Sanhedrin, and, having clad them in tallitot of blue wool, but without fringes, prepared for them a banquet. Aaron&#x27;s sons came for the priestly share, but Korah and his people refused to give the prescribed portions to them, saying that it was not God but Moses who commanded those things. Moses, having been informed of these proceedings, went to the house of Korah to effect a reconciliation, but the latter and his 250 followers rose up against him.

Korah consulted also his wife, who encouraged him in the revolt, saying: &quot;See what Moses has done. He has proclaimed himself king; he has made his brother high priest, and his brother&#x27;s sons priests; moreover, he has made you shave all your hair in order to disfigure you.&quot; Korah answered: &quot;But he has done the same to his own sons.&quot; His wife replied: &quot;Moses hated you so much that he was ready to do evil to his own children provided the same evil would overtake you&quot;.

Modern Jewish reform and secular interpretations of the Korah revolt supply new causes for the revolt to reflect new agendas and concerns of the authors.

===Korah&#x27;s parable===
Korah incited all the people against Moses, arguing that it was impossible to endure the laws Moses had instituted. He told them the following parable: &quot;A widow, the mother of two young daughters, had a field. When she came to plow it, Moses told her not to plow it with an ox and an ass together; when she came to sow it, Moses told her not to sow it with mingled seeds; At the time of harvest she had to leave unreaped the parts of the field prescribed by the Law, while from the harvested grain she had to give the priest the share due to him. The woman sold the field and with the proceeds bought two sheep. But the first-born of these she was obliged to give to Aaron the priest; and at the time of shearing he required the first of the fleece also. The widow said: &#x27;I cannot bear this man&#x27;s demands any longer. It will be better for me to slaughter the sheep and eat them.&#x27; But Aaron came for the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the maw. The widow then vehemently cried out: &#x27;If you persist in your demand, I declare them devoted to the Lord.&#x27; Aaron replied: &#x27;In that case the whole belongs to me&#x27;, whereupon he took away the meat, leaving the widow and her two daughters wholly unprovided for&quot;.

The question how it was possible for a wise man like Korah to be so imprudent as to rebel is explained by the fact that he was deceived through his own prophetic ability. He had foreseen that the prophet Samuel would be his descendant, and therefore concluded that he himself would escape punishment. But he was mistaken; for, while his sons escaped, he perished.

===Destruction of Korah===

At the time of Korah&#x27;s engulfment, the earth became like a funnel, and everything that belonged to him, even linen that was at the launderer&#x27;s and needles that had been borrowed by persons living at a distance from Korah, rolled till it fell into the chasm. According to the Rabbis, Korah himself underwent the double punishment of being burned and buried alive. He and his followers continued to sink until Hannah prayed for them; and through her prayer, the Rabbis declare, Korah will ascend to paradise. Rabbah bar bar Hana narrates that while he was traveling in the desert, an Arab showed him the place of Korah&#x27;s engulfment. There was at the spot a slit in the ground into which he introduced some wool soaked in water. The wool became parched. On placing his ear to the slit, he heard voices cry: &quot;Moses and his Torah are true; and we are liars&quot;.

== Other references ==
Korah is referenced in the New Testament in : &quot;Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam&#x27;s error; they have been destroyed in Korah&#x27;s rebellion.&quot; (NIV)

The rebellion of Korah is also made reference to in chapter 11 of 2 Meqabyan, a book considered canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.

Korah is mentioned in the 1768 edition of &quot;The New England Primer&quot;. Here, as part of an alphabet, we read that &quot;Proud Korah&#x27;s troop was swallowed up&quot; which is a paraphrasing of .

Korah is also mentioned by Irenaeus in his anti-Gnostic work &quot;Against Heresies&quot; (), written in about 180. He criticized the excuse that some evil people in the Bible were credited with obtaining their power from God. Specifically he wrote that there are some who &quot;declare that Cain derived his being from the Power above, and acknowledge that Esau, Korah, the Sodomites, and all such persons, are related to themselves.&quot;

The Dead Sea Scrolls also provide additional details about Korah, though which Korah is not certain.

==Quranic reference==
Korah is also mentioned in the Quran by the name of Qārūn (). He is recognized as wealthy, and became very arrogant due to his pride and ignorance. He gave the credit for his wealth to his knowledge instead of to God.
The Quran states he was punished due to his extreme arrogance by being swallowed by earth along with all his great material wealth.

In the Malay and Indonesian language, the term for treasure is literally &quot;Harta Karun&quot; (&quot;Qarun&#x27;s treasure&quot;). It is also often referred to in Turkish as &quot;Karun&#x27;un Hazineleri&quot;. In Muslim culture, he is referred to as a tyrant who is the epitome of arrogance based on wealth.

<doc id="608584" wikidata="Q7753506" url="?curid=608584" title="The New Amsterdams">
<text>The New Amsterdams is an American band featuring Matthew Pryor of The Get Up Kids. In a certain sense, they represented the acoustic counter-project to The Get up Kids. In contrast to The Get Up Kids, this project features acoustic guitars, the accordion, wind instruments, strings, and mature elements of American folklore. Among the members were also numerous musicians and contributors of The Get Up Kids and other friendly bands.

==History==

The New Amsterdams began as a solo project of The Get Up Kids lead singer, Matt Pryor. The band was named after the song New Amsterdam by Elvis Costello from 1980.

=== &quot;Never You Mind&quot; (2000) ===
In 2000, he released his debut album &quot;Never You Mind&quot;, which was largely made up of acoustic tracks with sparse accompaniment. However, the album also featured Alex Brahl, Ed Rose, Jake Cardwell &amp; Rob Pope providing extra instrument tracks. It was released at a time when The Get Up Kids were already becoming more and more successful. The first five albums of the New Amsterdams were released on Vagrant Records.

=== &quot;Para Toda Vida&quot;, &quot;Worse for the Wear&quot; (2002-2003) ===
Two years later in January 2002, Pryor released &quot;Para Toda Vida&quot;, this time sticking almost purely to acoustic guitar, with the exception of a few tracks utilizing the harmonica and banjo as well. However, the next year, the band went a step further in the release of &quot;Worse for the Wear&quot;, which utilized a full band for the first time. This included The Get Up Kids bandmates Ryan Pope and his brother Rob, as well as longtime friend and producer Ed Rose. The album was one of the earlier albums to be recorded at Black Lodge Studios, the recording studio renovated and co-owned by Ed Rose and the members of The Get Up Kids.

=== &quot;Story Like a Scar, Killed or Cured&quot; (2005-2007) ===
The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Killed or Cured&quot; was released in 2005. However, it was written during a turbulent time for The Get Up Kids, who were heading towards a breakup. Because of this, Vagrant Records, the label to which both the bands were signed, didn&#x27;t want to release the album until The Get Up Kids finished their farewell tour in the summer of that year. For this reason, a portion of the album was released online for free via The New Amsterdams website. In 2005 they played on the Austin City Limits Music Festival. The album &quot;Killed or Cured&quot; was released in its full version through retail channels on April 10, 2007.

In 2006, the band released the album &quot;Story Like a Scar&quot; with what is now the current lineup, including Bill Belzer on drums, Eric McCann on upright bass, and Dustin Kinsey on guitar. In the same year, The New Amsterdams played alongside bands like Depeche Mode and Daft Punk at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

=== &quot;At the Foot of My Rival&quot; (2007) ===
In September 2007, the band released another album, &quot;At the Foot of My Rival&quot; on CD, Vinyl, and Digital Download. However, after a long relationship with Vagrant Records, the band decided to release the album on Elmar, (named after Pryor&#x27;s son Elliot Marshall) an offshoot of Curb Appeal Records, owned in part by bandmate Jim Suptic.

In January 2008, the band released a collection of demos and b-sides, available exclusively through their website.

In May of the same year, they went on their first European tour, starting in Amsterdam. The band planned to go into a small hiatus after that due to Matt Pryor&#x27;s involvement with The Get Up Kids. Dustin Kinsey also joined the band Koufax.

=== &quot;Outroduction&quot; (2013) ===
In a November 2011 interview with &quot;MidcoastStation.com&quot;, Pryor said he had plans to release a New Amsterdams compilation. In 2013, a compilation entitled &quot;Outroduction&quot; was finally released, which contained B-side material. This time, the album was released on the label Nightshoes Syndicate, founded by Pryor himself.

<doc id="608594" wikidata="Q5374880" url="?curid=608594" title="Emulex hoax">
<text>The Emulex hoax was an instance of securities fraud perpetrated by 23-year-old Mark Jakob on August 24, 2000.

Jakob, a former employee of the press release distribution service Internet Wire, was facing a loss of almost $100,000 as a result of short-selling stock in the Emulex Corporation, a fiber-optic equipment manufacturer. To cover his losses, Jakob wrote a fake release stating that Emulex&#x27;s CEO had quit and the company was restating its quarterly earnings from a profit to a loss. Jakob then sent it to Internet Wire, posing as an Emulex publicist.

The next morning, the phony release was picked up by Bloomberg Television and other news outlets. Emulex&#x27;s stock price on the NASDAQ stock exchange dropped from $103.94 to $43.00 in only 16 minutes of morning trading, losing $2.2 billion in market capitalization.

The press release was a fraudulent short and distort stock manipulation. Bloomberg picked up Jakob&#x27;s fake release at around 10:13 a.m., just as Emulex, headquartered in California, was opening its doors for the day, and the stock price fell 62% before Emulex found the fake release and asked the National Association of Securities Dealers to halt trading, which it did at 10:29 a.m. Once the release had been conclusively debunked, trading resumed on Emulex and the share price recovered almost immediately to close at $105.75.

The FBI traced the release to Mark Jakob, who had realized a profit of more than $240,000 by shorting the stock. Jakob pled guilty and was sentenced to 44 months in prison, forfeiting the gains and owing an additional $103,000 in penalties. Jakob&#x27;s fraud cost Emulex shareholders almost $110 million.

<doc id="608611" wikidata="Q2632175" url="?curid=608611" title="Lord Dunmore's War">
<text>Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War, also known as Dunmore&#x27;s War, was a brief conflict in fall 1774 between the British Colony of Virginia and the Shawnee and Mingo in the trans-Appalachian region of the colony south of the Ohio River. Broadly, the war included events between May and October 1774. The governor of Virginia during the conflict was John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, who in May 1774, asked the House of Burgesses to declare a state of war with the Indians and call out the Virginia militia.

The conflict resulted from escalating violence between white settlers, who, in accordance with previous treaties, especially the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768), were exploring and moving into land south of the Ohio River (modern West Virginia, southwestern Pennsylvania, and Kentucky), and the Ohio Country Shawnee who had historical hunting rights in the south of Ohio lands of the Iroquois Confederacy. Resulting cross-river attacks by the Shawnee caused war to be declared &quot;to pacify the hostile Indian war bands&quot;. The war ended soon after Virginia&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Point Pleasant on October 10, 1774. In the ensuing Treaty of Camp Charlotte, the Native Americans surrendered their hunting rights south of the Ohio, and agreed to cease attacks upon travelers on the river and recognize the river, running nearly north–south at its eastern end, as the boundary between Indian lands of Ohio Country to the west, and the Colonies to the east. This was a major resetting of the Appalachian boundary defined by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 which ended the French and Indian War.

Although the Indian national chieftains signed the treaty, conflict within the Indian nations soon broke out. Some tribesmen felt the treaty sold out their claims and opposed it, and others believed that another war would mean only further losses of territory to the settlers. When the American Revolutionary War broke out between the American settlers and the British in 1775, the war parties of the Indian nations quickly gained power. They mobilized the various Indian nations to ally with the British during the war, initiating the Cherokee-American wars that lasted nearly two decades.

==Settlement and resistance in the &quot;Kentucke&quot; country==
The area south of the Ohio River and west of the Kanawha River (long referred to as &quot;Kentucke&quot; country after a region around the namesake river in what is today eastern Kentucky) had been claimed by the Iroquois Confederacy since their conquest in the 17th-century Beaver Wars. Although they were the most powerful Indian nation in the Northern Colonies, other tribes also made claims to the area and often hunted the region.

When, in accordance with the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768), British officials acquired the land south of the Ohio River from the Iroquois, many other Ohio Indians who had hunted in these lands refused to accede to the treaty and prepared to defend their hunting rights.

At the forefront of this resistance were the Shawnee, the most powerful among the allied Algonquin tribes of the Ohio Valley. They soon organized a large confederacy of Shawnee-Ohio Confederated Indians who were opposed to the British and the Iroquois in order to enforce their claims. British officials worked to isolate the Shawnee diplomatically from other Indian nations. When full-blown hostilities broke out within a few years, the Shawnee would find that they faced the Virginia militia with few allies.

Following the 1768 treaty, colonial explorers, surveyors, and settlers began pouring into the region. This immediately brought them into direct contact with Native Americans of the upper Ohio Valley, especially the Allegheny River. George Washington wrote in his journal for November 17, 1770, &quot;The Indians who are very dexterous, even their women, in the Management of Canoes, have there Hunting Camps &amp; Cabins all along the River for the convenience of Transporting their Skins by Water to Market.&quot;

===The Boone incident===
In September 1773, noted frontiersman Daniel Boone led a group of about 50 emigrants up the Powell River valley in Tennessee in the first attempt by white colonists to establish a settlement in &quot;Kentucke&quot;. On October 9, 1773, just south of the Cumberland Gap, Boone&#x27;s oldest son James, age 16, and a small group of men and boys who were retrieving supplies were attacked by a band of Delawares, Shawnees, and Cherokees. They had decided &quot;to send a message of their opposition to settlement...&quot; James Boone and Henry Russell, a teenage son of future Revolutionary War officer William Russell, were captured and tortured to death. The brutality of the killings shocked the settlers along the frontier, and Boone&#x27;s party abandoned their expedition. By December, the incident had been reported in Baltimore and Philadelphia newspapers.

The deaths among Boone&#x27;s party were among the seminal events that culminated in Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War. For the next several years, Indian nations opposed to the treaty continued to attack settlers, ritually mutilated and tortured to death the surviving men, and took the women and children into slavery.

Boone&#x27;s expedition was the first of several as part of a scheme with land speculator Richard Henderson to establish the Transylvania Colony in &quot;Kentucke&quot;.

===Early Allegheny settlements===

Starting in 1769, Ebenezer Zane, afterwards a famed &quot;Indian fighter&quot; and guide, known for Zane&#x27;s trace, had established a settlement on Wheeling Creek just over the Pennsylvania border on the Allegheny he named &quot;Zanesburg&quot; (now Wheeling, West Virginia). Later, Fort Fincastle was sited there.

Among the early settlers of the Allegheny valley beyond Pennsylvania was Captain Michael Cresap, the owner of a trading post at Redstone Old Fort (now Brownsville, Pennsylvania) on the Monongahela River. Under authority of the colonial government of Virginia, Cresap had taken control of extensive tracts of land at and below the mouth of Middle Island Creek (now St. Marys, West Virginia.) He went there in the early spring of 1774 with a party of men to settle his holdings.

===The Clark Expedition to Kentucky===
In spring of 1774, a group that included George Rogers Clark, who later became a general during the Revolutionary War, had gathered at the mouth of the Little Kanawha River (now Parkersburg, West Virginia). They were waiting there for the arrival of other Virginians expected to join them before they moved downriver to settle lands in Kentucky. Clark&#x27;s group began to hear reports that hostile Indians were robbing and occasionally killing traders, surveyors and others traveling down the Ohio. So they invited another settler, Captain Michael Cresap, who also intended to go to Kentucky, and who had combat experience, to join the group.

Cresap understood that any provocations might result in war, so he suggested the group return upstream to Zane&#x27;s small settlement at &quot;Zanesburg&quot; (the future Wheeling) and wait to see if Indian hostilities would decline. However, when they arrived, they found the whole area in an uproar. People were panicked by the stories of the survivors of the Indian attacks. They were upset by the Indian brutality towards captured settlers. Fearing for the lives of women and children, colonists living on the frontier flocked to the town for protection. A message from John Connolly, the garrison commander at upstream Fort Pitt, indicated that the local tribes including Shawnee and Delaware, intended war. 

Cresap called a council on April 26. After he read Connolly&#x27;s letter aloud, the assembly declared war against the Indians. After spotting some Indian canoes on the river the next day, settlers chased them downriver to Pipe Creek. There settlers engaged them in battle, with a few casualties on each side. The following day, Clark&#x27;s party abandoned the original idea of proceeding to Kentucky. Expecting retaliation, they broke camp and retreated with Cresap&#x27;s men to his headquarters at Redstone Old Fort.

===The Yellow Creek massacre===

Immediately after the Pipe Creek attack, settlers killed relatives of the Mingo leader Logan. Up until this point, Logan had expressed peaceful intentions toward the settlers. He and his hunting party were camped on the west bank of the Ohio at Yellow Creek, about above Zanesburg (near present day Steubenville, Ohio) and across the river from Baker&#x27;s Bottom. On April 30 some members of the hunting party (Logan was not among them) crossed the river to the cabin of Joshua Baker, a settler and rum trader. The visiting Mingo included Logan&#x27;s younger brother, commonly known as John Petty, and two closely related women. The younger woman was pregnant and also had an infant girl with her. The father of both these children was John Gibson, a well-known trader. Once the group was inside Baker&#x27;s cabin, some 30 frontiersmen, led by Daniel Greathouse, suddenly crowded in and killed all the visitors except the infant.

When Logan heard of the massacre, he was led to believe that Cresap, not Greathouse, was the man responsible for the attack. However, many people familiar with the incident (including Clark) knew that Greathouse and his men were the ones who had killed the party. Settlers along the frontiers realized that these killings were likely to provoke the remaining Indian nations of the Ohio Country to attack. Settlers remaining on the frontier immediately sought safety, either in blockhouses or by fleeing eastward across the Monongahela River. Many even traveled back across the Allegheny Mountains. Their fear was well founded. Logan and small parties of Shawnee and Mingo soon began striking at frontier settlers in revenge for the murders at Yellow Creek.

===Prelude to war===
The following month, a field surveyor named William Preston sent a letter of report to the head engineer of the frontier fort construction, namely George Washington, which indicates his understanding of circumstances just prior to the outbreak of Dunmore&#x27;s War:
FINCASTLE May 27. 1774.
DEAR SIR

Agreeable to my Promise I directed Mr. Floyd an Assistant to Survey your Land on Cole River on his Way to the Ohio, which he did and in a few Days afterwards sent me the Plot by Mr. Thomas Hog. Mr. Spotswood Dandridge who left the Surveyors on the Ohio after Hog Parted with them, wrote me that Mr. Hog and two other Men with him had never since been heard of. I have had no Opportunity of writing to Mr. Floyd Since. Tho&#x27; I suppose he will send me the Courses by the first Person that comes up, if so I shall make out the Certificate and send it down. This I directed him to do when we parted to prevent Accidents. But I am really afraid the Indians will hinder them from doing any Business of Vallue this Season as the Company being only 33 and dayly decreasing were under the greatest Apprehension of Danger when Mr. Dandridge parted with them.

It has been long disputed by our Hunters whether Louisa or Cumberland Rivers was the Boundary between us and the Cherokees. I have taken the Liberty to inclose to you a Report made by some Scouts who were out by my Order; and which Sets that matter beyond a Doubt.

It is say&#x27;d the Cherrokees claim the Land to the Westward of the Louisa &amp; between Cumberland M [mutilated] and the ohio. If so, and our Government gives it up we loose all the most Valluable part of that Country. The Northern Indians Sold that Land to the English at the Treaty of Lancaster in 1744, by the Treaty of Logs Town in 1752 and by that at Fort Stanwix in 1768. At that Time the Cherrokees laid no Claim to that Land &amp; how the[y] come to do it now I cannot imagine...
==Dunmore&#x27;s expedition==
===Mobilization and movements===
Early in May 1774, Dunmore received word that fighting had begun at Yellow Creek and other points on the Ohio. He requested the legislature to raise regular military forces to quell the threat of growing violence. The House of Burgesses preferred temporary militia forces. The legislature spent their time in session showing support to Boston and discussing the border dispute with Pennsylvania, but failed to renew the expiring militia act. Dunmore dissolved the House of Burgesses on 26 May 1774 and used his executive power under the expiring Invasions and Insurrections Act to mobilize Virginia&#x27;s county militias.

According to historians Eric Hinderaker and Peter C. Mancall in &quot;At the Edge of Empire&quot; (2003):

With the new forces, Dunmore advanced toward the Ohio where he split his force into two groups: one would move down the Ohio from Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh), 1,700 men led by him, and another body of 800 troops under Colonel Andrew Lewis would travel from Camp Union (now Lewisburg, West Virginia) with the two forces rendezvousing at the mouth of the Great Kanawha River. Under this general plan, Dunmore traveled to Fort Pitt and duly proceeded with his forces down the Ohio. On September 30, he arrived at Fort Fincastle (later Fort Henry), recently built at Zanesburg at his direction.

The force under Lewis, now 1,100 strong, proceeded from Camp Union to the headwaters of the Kanawha. From there, he continued downriver to the appointed rendezvous, reaching the river&#x27;s mouth (October 6) where he established &quot;Camp Pleasant&quot; (soon to be known as Point Pleasant). Not finding Dunmore there, he sent messengers up the Ohio to meet him and tell him of the arrival. On October 9 Dunmore sent a dispatch announcing his presence at the mouth of the Hocking River, and that he would proceed to the Shawnee towns on the Scioto. He ordered Lewis to cross the Ohio and meet him at the Shawnee towns.
===Fort Fincastle===
Dunmore encouraged the county militia lieutenants to build small forts to protect inhabitants, and also for use by militias.
Connolly sent William Crawford to build Fort Fincastle in June 1774, to oversee the mouth of Wheeling Creek. From here, Connolly planned to launch offensive operations.

===McDonald&#x27;s Expedition===
In the first battle of the war, on July 26, 1774, forces under Angus McDonald crossed the Ohio River to attack the villages of Wakatomika. McDonald commanded a battalion of about 400 men divided into eight companies, including Michael Cresap, George Rogers Clark, and Daniel Morgan as three of the company commanders.

After making first contact on July 31 with 3 Native Americans on horseback, McDonald suspected a decoy initiated ambush, and organized the companies into three columns. The following day, they indeed encountered three Native American scouts who ran through a swamp, leading McDonald&#x27;s battalion to an ambush. Prepared for this tactic, McDonald&#x27;s battalion flanked the Native Americans, who conducted a fighting withdrawal. The battalion reported two dead and five wounded, with one Native American confirmed killed. 

The Virginians continued to the Muskingum River, where they exchanged musket fire with village defenders, killing one while suffering no losses. During the exchange, a Virginian named Joseph Nicholson and a Lenape man recognized one another, and the Lenape man crossed the river to speak with McDonald. He told McDonald that the Pennsylvanians had warned the area villages of the &quot;cruel&quot; Virginian&#x27;s approach, and that the Lenape were friendly towards white settlers. The Lenape man left and returned the next day with two more Lenape men and one Mingo. After some discussion, McDonald sent them with a message that he would spare the nearby villages if they released two white women that had recently been captured, and offered three warriors to be held by the Virginians until the chiefs could meet in a council.

While awaiting their response, McDonald sent two companies to cross the river downstream. When the Lenape did not return on August 2, 1774, McDonald ordered an attack. Along the way, they found the Mingo man from the previous day, who said the villages had refused their terms. McDonald kept the man as hostage. The two companies that had crossed the river, meanwhile, met an ambush of defenders. The Virginians outflanked their position and believed that they had killed or wounded several. The entire battalion entered the villages, which they found abandoned. They plundered and burned one Mingo and five Shawnee villages, but spared the Lenape villages since they were considered neutral.

Shawnee defenders killed two Virginians and wounded several more, but McDonald was able to sack multiple villages and destroy their fields. They returned to Wheeling with three Shawnee captives and three scalps. Native American attacks continued; McDonald&#x27;s campaign accomplished little, but convinced Governor Dunmore than overwhelming force was needed.

===Battle of Point Pleasant===

On October 10, before Lewis began crossing the Ohio, he and his force were surprised by warriors under Chief Cornstalk. The Battle of Point Pleasant (at what is today its namesake Point Pleasant, WV on the WV/Ohio border) raged nearly all day and descended into hand-to-hand combat. Lewis&#x27;s army suffered about 215 casualties, of whom 75 were killed, including Lewis&#x27;s brother, and 140 wounded. His forces defeated the Ohio Confederacy warriors, who retreated across the Ohio, having lost about 40 warriors. Captain George Mathews of the Virginia militia was credited with a flanking maneuver that initiated Cornstalk&#x27;s retreat.

===Treaty of Camp Charlotte===
After victory at the Point, Dunmore and Lewis advanced from their respective camps into Ohio to within of the Shawnee towns at Pickaway Plains (present Pickaway County, Ohio) on the Scioto. Here they erected the temporary Camp Charlotte on Scippo Creek and met with Cornstalk to begin peace negotiations. By the terms of the Treaty of Camp Charlotte (October 19, 1774), the Shawnee agreed to cease hunting south of the Ohio and to discontinue harassment of travellers on the River. Although Chief Logan said he would cease fighting, he would not attend the formal peace talks. It was here that an agent of Chief Logan (possibly Simon Girty) recited a speech by Logan which became one of the most famous speeches in Indian and Ohio history, dubbed, &quot;Logan&#x27;s Lament&quot;.

After the Mingo refused to accept the terms, Major William Crawford attacked their village of Seekunk (Salt Lick Town, now Columbus, Ohio). His force of 240 men destroyed the village. These operations, and the submission of the Shawnee at Camp Charlotte, virtually closed the war.

The treaty was reaffirmed in talks the following year at Fort Pitt, where commissioners from the Continental Congress urged representatives from the Iroquois, Shawnee, Lenape, Wyandot, and Odawa to remain neutral in the growing conflict with Great Britain.

===Fort Gower Resolves===

In early November 1774, the army of Virginians arrived back at the point of land formed by confluence of the Ohio and Hocking Rivers and to the makeshift base camp they had established several weeks earlier named Fort Gower (for Earl Gower, a British Lord). There they were informed that the Continental Congress in Philadelphia had enacted a boycott of English goods in response to the Coercive Acts. Recognizing the significance of what was essentially an act of rebellion, the Virginians, in a declaration of the increasing spirit of independence among the colonists, addressing King George and their fellow Virginians, wrote and had published what came to be known as the &quot;Fort Gower Resolves&quot;. Among the soldiers present were many Virginians that later became famous in the revolution: William Campbell, George Rogers Clark, William Crawford, Simon Kenton, Andrew Lewis, Daniel Morgan, William Russell, Adam Stephen and many others.

At a Meeting of the Officers under the Command of his Excellency the Right Honourable the EARL of DUNMORE, convened at Fort Gower*, November 5, 1774, for the Purpose of considering the Grievances of BRITISH AMERICA, an Officer present addressed the Meeting in the following Words:

&quot;GENTLEMEN: Having now concluded the Campaign, by the Assistance of Providence, with Honour and Advantage to the Colony, and ourselves, it only remains that we should give our Country the strongest Assurance that we are ready, at all Times, to the utmost of our Power, to maintain and defend her just Rights and Privileges. We have lived about three Months in the Woods, without any intelligence from Boston, or from the Delegates at Philadelphia. It is possible, from the groundless Reports of designing Men, that our Countrymen may be jealous of the Use such a Body would make of Arms in their Hands at this critical Juncture. That we are a respectable Body is certain, when it is considered that we can live Weeks without Bread or Salt, that we can sleep in the open Air without any Covering but that of the Canopy of Heaven, and that our Men can march and shoot with any in the known World. Blessed with these Talents, let us solemnly engage to one another, and our Country in particular, that we will use them to no Purpose but for the Honour and Advantage of America in general, and of Virginia in particular. It behooves us then, for the Satisfaction of our Country, that we should give them our real Sentiments, by Way of Resolves, at this very alarming Crisis.&quot;

Whereupon the Meeting made Choice of a Committee to draw up and prepare Resolves for their Consideration, who immediately withdrew; and after some Time spent therein, reported, that they had agreed to, and prepared the following Resolves, which were read, maturely considered, and agreed to &quot;nemine contradicente&quot;, by the Meeting, and ordered to be published in the Virginia Gazette:

&quot;Resolved, that we will bear the most faithful Allegiance to his Majesty King George III, whilst his Majesty delights to reign over a brave and free People; that we will, at the Expense of Life, and every Thing dear and valuable, exert ourselves in Support of the Honour of his Crown and the Dignity of the British empire. But as the Love of Liberty, and Attachment to the real Interests and just Rights of America outweigh every other Consideration, we resolve that we will exert every Power within us for the Defence of American Liberty, and for the Support of her just Rights and Privileges; not in any precipitate, riotous, or tumultous Manner, but when regularly called forth by the unanimous Voice of our Countrymen.&quot;

&quot;Resolved, that we entertain the greatest Respect for his Excellency the Right Honourable Lord Dunmore, who commanded the Expedition against the Shawanese; and who, we are confident, underwent the great Fatigue of this singular Campaign from no other Motive than the true Interest of this Country.&quot;

Signed by Order, and in Behalf of the whole corps,

Clerk.
The Resolves were published in the &quot;Virginia Gazette&quot; December 22, 1774.

It was the first time colonists had asserted that they were prepared to use force of arms against the Crown to secure their rights—acts which, if executed, would be treason.

These resolves were virtually a declaration of independence in Ohio by Virginia backwoodsmen six months before the shot in Concord &quot;heard round the world&quot; and fully a year and a half before the peal of the Liberty Bell announced the freedom of the colonies.

Dunmore&#x27;s militia then retreated over the Alleghenies proceeding by Redstone Old Fort and the Great Crossings of the Youghiogheny River to Fort Cumberland, and then to the capitol at Williamsburg.

==Aftermath==
The peace did not stay for long following the treaty, however. On March 24, 1775, a band of Shawnee who apparently did not recognize the Ohio river boundary attacked Daniel Boone in Kentucky along the Wilderness Road. Nonetheless, by the time of colonial victories at Lexington and Concord, there were several permanent settlements in &quot;Kentucke&quot; country: Harrod&#x27;s Town, Boone&#x27;s Station, Logan&#x27;s Fort, and Lexington. In May 1776, as the American Revolution got underway, the Shawnee joined dissident Cherokee chief Dragging Canoe in again declaring war on the Virginia colonists. These were the Cherokee–American wars of 1776–1794. &quot;Kentucke&quot; country would go on to become its own county (1776) and eventually the U.S. state of Kentucky (1792); the northern portion, including Point Pleasant, would become the state of West Virginia.

Fort Gower was abandoned after Dunmore&#x27;s war. Its present location is believed to be underwater just beyond Hockingport, Ohio. Fort Fincastle, renamed Fort Henry by the colonial militia, along with Fort Pitt and the downstream Fort Harmar in Ohio (1785) became major stepping stones for advancement of the trans-Appalachian frontier during the Cherokee-American and Northwest Indian wars. A series of forts were established at the Point during and after the Revolutionary War; all were abandoned. Settlement along the Allegheny was inhibited until the end of the Indian wars. About that time, a settlement grew up on the Point and was chartered Point Pleasant in 1794.

<text>Ethanol fuel is fuel containing ethyl alcohol, the same type of alcohol as found in alcoholic beverages. It is most often used as a motor fuel, mainly as a biofuel additive for gasoline.

Several common ethanol fuel mixtures are in use around the world. The use of pure hydrous or anhydrous ethanol in internal combustion engines (ICEs) is only possible if the engines are designed or modified for that purpose. Anhydrous ethanol can be blended with :gasoline (petrol) for use in gasoline engines, but with high ethanol content only after engine modifications to meter increased fuel volume since pure ethanol contains only 2/3 the energy of an equivalent volume of pure gasoline. High percentage ethanol mixtures are used in some racing engine applications as the very high octane rating of ethanol is compatible with very high compression ratios.

The first production car running entirely on ethanol was the Fiat 147, introduced in 1978 in Brazil by Fiat. Ethanol is commonly made from biomass such as corn or sugarcane. World ethanol production for transport fuel tripled between 2000 and 2007 from to more than . From 2007 to 2008, the share of ethanol in global gasoline type fuel use increased from 3.7% to 5.4%. In 2011 worldwide ethanol fuel production reached with the United States of America and Brazil being the top producers, accounting for 62.2% and 25% of global production, respectively. US ethanol production reached in May 2017.

Ethanol fuel has a &quot;gasoline gallon equivalency&quot; (GGE) value of 1.5, i.e. to replace the energy of 1 volume of gasoline, 1.5 times the volume of ethanol is needed.

Ethanol-blended fuel is widely used in Brazil, the United States, Canada, and Europe (see also Ethanol fuel by country). Most cars on the road today in the U.S. can run on blends of up to 15% ethanol, and ethanol represented 10% of the U.S. gasoline fuel supply derived from domestic sources in 2011. Some flexible-fuel vehicles are able to use up to 100% ethanol.

Since 1976 the Brazilian government has made it mandatory to blend ethanol with gasoline, and since 2007 the legal blend is around 25% ethanol and 75% gasoline (E25). By December 2011 Brazil had a fleet of 14.8 million flex-fuel automobiles and light trucks and 1.5 million flex-fuel motorcycles that regularly use neat ethanol fuel (known as E100).

Bioethanol is a form of renewable energy that can be produced from agricultural feedstocks. It can be made from very common crops such as hemp, sugarcane, potato, cassava and corn. There has been considerable debate about how useful bioethanol is in replacing gasoline. Concerns about its production and use relate to increased food prices due to the large amount of arable land required for crops, as well as the energy and pollution balance of the whole cycle of ethanol production, especially from corn.

==Chemistry==
During ethanol fermentation, glucose and other sugars in the corn (or sugarcane or other crops) are converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide.
:C6H12O6 → 2 C2H5OH+ 2 CO2 + heat

Ethanol fermentation is not 100% selective with side products such as acetic acid and glycols. They are mostly removed during ethanol purification. Fermentation takes place in an aqueous solution. The resulting solution has an ethanol content of around 15%. Ethanol is subsequently isolated and purified by a combination of adsorption and distillation.

During combustion, ethanol reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and heat:
:C2H5OH + 3 O2 → 2 CO2 + 3 H2O + heat

Starch and cellulose molecules are strings of glucose molecules. It is also possible to generate ethanol out of cellulosic materials. That, however, requires a pretreatment that splits the cellulose into glucose molecules and other sugars that subsequently can be fermented. The resulting product is called cellulosic ethanol, indicating its source.

Ethanol is also produced industrially from ethylene by hydration of the double bond in the presence of a catalyst and high temperature.
:C2H4 + H2O → C2H5OH

Most ethanol is produced by fermentation.

==Sources==

About 5% of the ethanol produced in the world in 2003 was actually a petroleum product. It is made by the catalytic hydration of ethylene with sulfuric acid as the catalyst. It can also be obtained via ethylene or acetylene, from calcium carbide, coal, oil gas, and other sources. of petroleum-derived ethanol are produced annually. The principal suppliers are plants in the United States, Europe, and South Africa. Petroleum derived ethanol (synthetic ethanol) is chemically identical to bioethanol and can be differentiated only by radiocarbon dating.

Bioethanol is usually obtained from the conversion of carbon-based feedstock. Agricultural feedstocks are considered renewable because they get energy from the sun using photosynthesis, provided that all minerals required for growth (such as nitrogen and phosphorus) are returned to the land. Ethanol can be produced from a variety of feedstocks such as sugar cane, bagasse, miscanthus, sugar beet, sorghum, grain, switchgrass, barley, hemp, kenaf, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, sunflower, fruit, molasses, corn, stover, grain, wheat, straw, cotton, other biomass, as well as many types of cellulose waste and harvesting, whichever has the best well-to-wheel assessment.

In 2008 an alternative process to produce bioethanol from algae was announced by the company Algenol. Rather than grow algae and then harvest and ferment it, the algae grow in sunlight and produce ethanol directly, which is removed without killing the algae. It is claimed the process can produce per year compared with for corn production. In 2015 the project was abandoned.

Currently, the first generation processes for the production of ethanol from corn use only a small part of the corn plant: the corn kernels are taken from the corn plant and only the starch, which represents about 50% of the dry kernel mass, is transformed into ethanol. Two types of second generation processes are under development. The first type uses enzymes and yeast fermentation to convert the plant cellulose into ethanol while the second type uses pyrolysis to convert the whole plant to either a liquid bio-oil or a syngas. Second generation processes can also be used with plants such as grasses, wood or agricultural waste material such as straw.

==Production==

Although there are various ways ethanol fuel can be produced, the most common way is via fermentation.

The basic steps for large-scale production of ethanol are: microbial (yeast) fermentation of sugars, distillation, dehydration (requirements vary, see Ethanol fuel mixtures, below), and denaturing (optional). Prior to fermentation, some crops require saccharification or hydrolysis of carbohydrates such as cellulose and starch into sugars. Saccharification of cellulose is called cellulolysis (see cellulosic ethanol). Enzymes are used to convert starch into sugar.

===Fermentation===

Ethanol is produced by microbial fermentation of the sugar. Microbial fermentation currently only works directly with sugars. Two major components of plants, starch and cellulose, are both made of sugars—and can, in principle, be converted to sugars for fermentation. Currently, only the sugar (e.g., sugar cane) and starch (e.g., corn) portions can be economically converted.

There is interest in cellulosic ethanol obtained from breaking down plant cellulose to sugars and converting the sugars to ethanol. However, cellulosic ethanol is currently uneconomical and not practiced commercially. According to a 2006 International Energy Agency report, cellulosic ethanol could be important in the future.

===Distillation===
For the ethanol to be usable as a fuel, the yeast solids and the majority of the water must be removed. After fermentation, the mash is heated so that the ethanol evaporates. This process, known as distillation, separates the ethanol, but its purity is limited to 95–96% due to the formation of a low-boiling water-ethanol azeotrope with maximum (95.6% m/m (96.5% v/v) ethanol and 4.4% m/m (3.5% v/v) water). This mixture is called hydrous ethanol and can be used as a fuel alone, but unlike anhydrous ethanol, hydrous ethanol is not miscible in all ratios with gasoline, so the water fraction is typically removed in further treatment to burn in combination with gasoline in gasoline engines.

===Dehydration===
There are three dehydration processes to remove the water from an azeotropic ethanol/water mixture. The first process, used in many early fuel ethanol plants, is called azeotropic distillation and consists of adding benzene or cyclohexane to the mixture. When these components are added to the mixture, it forms a heterogeneous azeotropic mixture in vapor–liquid-liquid equilibrium, which when distilled produces anhydrous ethanol in the column bottom, and a vapor mixture of water, ethanol, and cyclohexane/benzene.

When condensed, this becomes a two-phase liquid mixture. The heavier phase, poor in the entrainer (benzene or cyclohexane), is stripped of the entrainer and recycled to the feed—while the lighter phase, with condensate from the stripping, is recycled to the second column. Another early method, called extractive distillation, consists of adding a ternary component that increases ethanol&#x27;s relative volatility. When the ternary mixture is distilled, it produces anhydrous ethanol on the top stream of the column.

With increasing attention being paid to saving energy, many methods have been proposed that avoid distillation altogether for dehydration. Of these methods, a third method has emerged and has been adopted by the majority of modern ethanol plants. This new process uses molecular sieves to remove water from fuel ethanol. In this process, ethanol vapor under pressure passes through a bed of molecular sieve beads. The bead&#x27;s pores are sized to allow adsorption of water while excluding ethanol. After a period of time, the bed is regenerated under vacuum or in the flow of inert atmosphere (e.g. N2) to remove the adsorbed water. Two beds are often used so that one is available to adsorb water while the other is being regenerated. This dehydration technology can account for energy saving of 3,000 btus/gallon (840 kJ/L) compared to earlier azeotropic distillation.

Recent research has demonstrated that complete dehydration prior to blending with gasoline is not always necessary. Instead, the azeotropic mixture can be blended directly with gasoline so that liquid-liquid phase equilibrium can assist in the elimination of water. A two-stage counter-current setup of mixer-settler tanks can achieve complete recovery of ethanol into the fuel phase, with minimal energy consumption.

===Post-production water issues===
Ethanol is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs water vapor directly from the atmosphere. Because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the ethanol and may cause phase separation of ethanol-gasoline blends (which causes engine stall), containers of ethanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed. This high miscibility with water means that ethanol cannot be efficiently shipped through modern pipelines, like liquid hydrocarbons, over long distances.

The fraction of water that an ethanol-gasoline fuel can contain without phase separation increases with the percentage of ethanol. For example, E30 can have up to about 2% water. If there is more than about 71% ethanol, the remainder can be any proportion of water or gasoline and phase separation does not occur. The fuel mileage declines with increased water content. The increased solubility of water with higher ethanol content permits E30 and hydrated ethanol to be put in the same tank since any combination of them always results in a single phase. Somewhat less water is tolerated at lower temperatures. For E10 it is about 0.5% v/v at 21 °C and decreases to about 0.23% v/v at −34 °C.

===Consumer production systems===
While biodiesel production systems have been marketed to home and business users for many years, commercialized ethanol production systems designed for end-consumer use have lagged in the marketplace. In 2008, two different companies announced home-scale ethanol production systems. The AFS125 Advanced Fuel System from Allard Research and Development is capable of producing both ethanol and biodiesel in one machine, while the E-100 MicroFueler from E-Fuel Corporation is dedicated to ethanol only.

==Engines==
===Fuel economy===
Ethanol contains approximately 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, and therefore in theory, burning pure ethanol in a vehicle reduces range per unit measure by 34%, given the same fuel economy, compared to burning pure gasoline. However, since ethanol has a higher octane rating, the engine can be made more efficient by raising its compression ratio.

For E10 (10% ethanol and 90% gasoline), the increase in fuel consumption in unmodified vehicles is small (up to 2.8%) when compared to conventional gasoline, and even smaller (1–2%) when compared to oxygenated and reformulated blends. For E85 (85% ethanol), the effect becomes significant. E85 produces lower mileage than gasoline, and requires more frequent refueling. Actual performance may vary depending on the vehicle. Based on EPA tests for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline. The EPA-rated mileage of current United States flex-fuel vehicles should be considered when making price comparisons, but E85 is a high performance fuel, with an octane rating of about 94–96, and should be compared to premium. Ethanol is not suitable for most aircraft, according to the RACQ, as well as some motorbikes and small engines, though the Embraer EMB 202 Ipanema is an example of an aircraft that has been specifically designed for use with ethanol fuel in some variants.

===Cold start during the winter===
High ethanol blends present a problem to achieve enough vapor pressure for the fuel to evaporate and spark the ignition during cold weather (since ethanol tends to increase fuel enthalpy of vaporization). When vapor pressure is below 45 kPa starting a cold engine becomes difficult. To avoid this problem at temperatures below , and to reduce ethanol higher emissions during cold weather, both the US and the European markets adopted E85 as the maximum blend to be used in their flexible fuel vehicles, and they are optimized to run at such a blend. At places with harsh cold weather, the ethanol blend in the US has a seasonal reduction to E70 for these very cold regions, though it is still sold as E85. At places where temperatures fall below during the winter, it is recommended to install an engine heater system, both for gasoline and E85 vehicles. Sweden has a similar seasonal reduction, but the ethanol content in the blend is reduced to E75 during the winter months.

Brazilian flex fuel vehicles can operate with ethanol mixtures up to E100, which is hydrous ethanol (with up to 4% water), which causes vapor pressure to drop faster as compared to E85 vehicles. As a result, Brazilian flex vehicles are built with a small secondary gasoline reservoir located near the engine. During a cold start pure gasoline is injected to avoid starting problems at low temperatures. This provision is particularly necessary for users of Brazil&#x27;s southern and central regions, where temperatures normally drop below during the winter. An improved flex engine generation was launched in 2009 that eliminates the need for the secondary gas storage tank. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first Brazilian flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start.

===Fuel mixtures===

In many countries cars are mandated to run on mixtures of ethanol. All Brazilian light-duty vehicles are built to operate for an ethanol blend of up to 25% (E25), and since 1993 a federal law requires mixtures between 22% and 25% ethanol, with 25% required as of mid July 2011. In the United States all light-duty vehicles are built to operate normally with an ethanol blend of 10% (E10). At the end of 2010 over 90 percent of all gasoline sold in the U.S. was blended with ethanol. In January 2011 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a waiver to authorize up to 15% of ethanol blended with gasoline (E15) to be sold only for cars and light pickup trucks with a model year of 2001 or newer.

Beginning with the model year 1999, an increasing number of vehicles in the world are manufactured with engines that can run on any fuel from 0% ethanol up to 100% ethanol without modification. Many cars and light trucks (a class containing minivans, SUVs and pickup trucks) are designed to be flexible-fuel vehicles using ethanol blends up to 85% (E85) in North America and Europe, and up to 100% (E100) in Brazil. In older model years, their engine systems contained alcohol sensors in the fuel and/or oxygen sensors in the exhaust that provide input to the engine control computer to adjust the fuel injection to achieve stochiometric (no residual fuel or free oxygen in the exhaust) air-to-fuel ratio for any fuel mix. In newer models, the alcohol sensors have been removed, with the computer using only oxygen and airflow sensor feedback to estimate alcohol content. The engine control computer can also adjust (advance) the ignition timing to achieve a higher output without pre-ignition when it predicts that higher alcohol percentages are present in the fuel being burned. This method is backed up by advanced knock sensors – used in most high performance gasoline engines regardless of whether they are designed to use ethanol or not – that detect pre-ignition and detonation.

In June 2021, India brought forward to 2025 its target to implement a 20% ethanol-blended auto fuel. India&#x27;s ethanol blending rate in fuel (at the time of this target revision) is 8%, which is set to increase to 10% by 2022 based on the &#x27;Roadmap for ethanol blending in India 2020-25&#x27; released on 5 June (World Environment Day) by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The government expects oil marketing companies such as Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to provide 20% ethanol-blended fuel from April 2023 onward. States like Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, where ethanol is in surplus, are expected to be the first to adopt the higher ethanol fuel blending rate. India is also prioritizing roll-out of vehicles compatible with ethanol-blended fuel. From March 2021, auto manufacturers are required to indicate the ethanol compatibility of new vehicles and engines must be optimally designed to use 20% ethanol-blended fuel. The government expects automakers to begin production of ethanol-blended fuel compliant vehicles before April 2022. However, environmentalists worry that India&#x27;s increased target for ethanol blending could incentivise water-intensive crops such as sugarcane and rice, and suggest that the government should focus on lower-water intensity crops such as millets since India is already facing an acute water shortage.

===Other engine configurations===

;ED95 engines

Since 1989 there have also been ethanol engines based on the diesel principle operating in Sweden. They are used primarily in city buses, but also in distribution trucks and waste collectors. The engines, made by Scania, have a modified compression ratio, and the fuel (known as ED95) used is a mix of 93.6% ethanol and 3.6% ignition improver, and 2.8% denaturants. The ignition improver makes it possible for the fuel to ignite in the diesel combustion cycle. It is then also possible to use the energy efficiency of the diesel principle with ethanol. These engines have been used in the United Kingdom by Reading Buses but the use of bioethanol fuel is now being phased out.

;Dual-fuel direct-injection

A 2004 MIT study and an earlier paper published by the Society of Automotive Engineers identified a method to exploit the characteristics of fuel ethanol substantially more efficiently than mixing it with gasoline. The method presents the possibility of leveraging the use of alcohol to achieve definite improvement over the cost-effectiveness of hybrid electric. The improvement consists of using dual-fuel direct-injection of pure alcohol (or the azeotrope or E85) and gasoline, in any ratio up to 100% of either, in a turbocharged, high compression-ratio, small-displacement engine having performance similar to an engine having twice the displacement. Each fuel is carried separately, with a much smaller tank for alcohol. The high-compression (for higher efficiency) engine runs on ordinary gasoline under low-power cruise conditions. Alcohol is directly injected into the cylinders (and the gasoline injection simultaneously reduced) only when necessary to suppress &#x27;knock&#x27; such as when significantly accelerating. Direct cylinder injection raises the already high octane rating of ethanol up to an effective 130. The calculated over-all reduction of gasoline use and CO2 emission is 30%. The consumer cost payback time shows a 4:1 improvement over turbo-diesel and a 5:1 improvement over hybrid. The problems of water absorption into pre-mixed gasoline (causing phase separation), supply issues of multiple mix ratios and cold-weather starting are also avoided.

;Increased thermal efficiency

In a 2008 study, complex engine controls and increased exhaust gas recirculation allowed a compression ratio of 19.5 with fuels ranging from neat ethanol to E50. Thermal efficiency up to approximately that for a diesel was achieved. This would result in the fuel economy of a neat ethanol vehicle to be about the same as one burning gasoline.

;Fuel cells powered by an ethanol reformer
In June 2016, Nissan announced plans to develop fuel cell vehicles powered by ethanol rather than hydrogen, the fuel of choice by the other car manufacturers that have developed and commercialized fuel cell vehicles, such as the Hyundai Tucson FCEV, Toyota Mirai, and Honda FCX Clarity. The main advantage of this technical approach is that it would be cheaper and easier to deploy the fueling infrastructure than setting up the one required to deliver hydrogen at high pressures, as each hydrogen fueling station cost to to build.

Nissan plans to create a technology that uses liquid ethanol fuel as a source to generate hydrogen within the vehicle itself. The technology uses heat to reform ethanol into hydrogen to feed what is known as a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The fuel cell generates electricity to supply power to the electric motor driving the wheels, through a battery that handles peak power demands and stores regenerated energy. The vehicle would include a tank for a blend of water and ethanol, which is fed into an onboard reformer that splits it into pure hydrogen and carbon dioxide. According to Nissan, the liquid fuel could be an ethanol-water blend at a 55:45 ratio. Nissan expects to commercialize its technology by 2020.

==Experience by country==

The world&#x27;s top ethanol fuel producers in 2011 were the United States with and Brazil with , accounting together for 87.1% of world production of . Strong incentives, coupled with other industry development initiatives, are giving rise to fledgling ethanol industries in countries such as Germany, Spain, France, Sweden, China, Thailand, Canada, Colombia, India, Australia, and some Central American countries.

=== Brazilian ethanol fuel program ===
Since the 1970s, Brazil has had an ethanol fuel program which has allowed the country to become the world&#x27;s second largest producer of ethanol (after the United States) and the world&#x27;s largest exporter. Brazil&#x27;s ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap sugarcane as feedstock, and the residual cane-waste (bagasse) is used to produce heat and power. There are no longer light vehicles in Brazil running on pure gasoline.

==Environment==

===Energy balance===
† experimental, not in commercial production

†† depending on production method

All biomass goes through at least some of these steps: it needs to be grown, collected, dried, fermented, distilled, and burned. All of these steps require resources and an infrastructure. The total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel is known as the energy balance (or &quot;energy returned on energy invested&quot;). Figures compiled in a 2007 report by &quot;National Geographic&quot; point to modest results for corn ethanol produced in the US: one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol. The energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil is more favorable, with one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol. Energy balance estimates are not easily produced, thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory. For instance, a separate survey reports that production of ethanol from sugarcane, which requires a tropical climate to grow productively, returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended, as compared to corn, which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended. A 2006 University of California Berkeley study, after analyzing six separate studies, concluded that producing ethanol from corn uses much less petroleum than producing gasoline.

Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is emitted during fermentation and combustion. This is canceled out by the greater uptake of carbon dioxide by the plants as they grow to produce the biomass.
When produced by certain methods, ethanol releases less greenhouse gases than gasoline does.

===Air pollution===
Compared with conventional unleaded gasoline, ethanol is a particulate-free burning fuel source that combusts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water and aldehydes. The Clean Air Act requires the addition of oxygenates to reduce carbon monoxide emissions in the United States. The additive MTBE is currently being phased out due to ground water contamination, hence ethanol becomes an attractive alternative additive. Current production methods include air pollution from the manufacturer of macronutrient fertilizers such as ammonia.

A study by atmospheric scientists at Stanford University found that E85 fuel would increase the risk of air pollution deaths relative to gasoline by 9% in Los Angeles, US: a very large, urban, car-based metropolis that is a worst-case scenario. Ozone levels are significantly increased, thereby increasing photochemical smog and aggravating medical problems such as asthma.

Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel. Gas chromatograph studies were performed of ambient air in São Paulo, Brazil, and compared to Osaka, Japan, which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher.

===Carbon dioxide===

 of exactly how much carbon dioxide is produced in the manufacture of bioethanol is a complex and inexact process, and is highly dependent on the method by which the ethanol is produced and the assumptions made in the calculation. A calculation should include:
*The cost of growing the feedstock
*The cost of transporting the feedstock to the factory
*The cost of processing the feedstock into bioethanol
Such a calculation may or may not consider the following effects:
*The cost of the change in land use of the area where the fuel feedstock is grown.
*The cost of transportation of the bioethanol from the factory to its point of use
*The efficiency of the bioethanol compared with standard gasoline
*The amount of carbon dioxide produced at the tail pipe.
*The benefits due to the production of useful bi-products, such as cattle feed or electricity.
The graph on the right shows figures calculated by the UK government for the purposes of the Renewable transport fuel obligation.

The January 2006 Science article from UC Berkeley&#x27;s ERG, estimated reduction from corn ethanol in GHG to be 13% after reviewing a large number of studies. In a correction to that article released shortly after publication, they reduce the estimated value to 7.4%. A &quot;National Geographic&quot; overview article (2007) puts the figures at 22% less CO2 emissions in production and use for corn ethanol compared to gasoline and a 56% reduction for cane ethanol. Carmaker Ford reports a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions with bioethanol compared to petrol for one of their flexible-fuel vehicles.

An additional complication is that production requires tilling new soil which produces a one-off release of GHG that it can take decades or centuries of production reductions in GHG emissions to equalize. As an example, converting grass lands to corn production for ethanol takes about a century of annual savings to make up for the GHG released from the initial tilling.

===Change in land use===

Large-scale farming is necessary to produce agricultural alcohol and this requires substantial amounts of cultivated land. University of Minnesota researchers report that if all corn grown in the U.S. were used to make ethanol it would displace 12% of current U.S. gasoline consumption. There are claims that land for ethanol production is acquired through deforestation, while others have observed that areas currently supporting forests are usually not suitable for growing crops. In any case, farming may involve a decline in soil fertility due to reduction of organic matter, a decrease in water availability and quality, an increase in the use of pesticides and fertilizers, and potential dislocation of local communities. New technology enables farmers and processors to increasingly produce the same output using less inputs.

Cellulosic ethanol production is a new approach that may alleviate land use and related concerns. Cellulosic ethanol can be produced from any plant material, potentially doubling yields, in an effort to minimize conflict between food needs vs. fuel needs. Instead of utilizing only the starch by-products from grinding wheat and other crops, cellulosic ethanol production maximizes the use of all plant materials, including gluten. This approach would have a smaller carbon footprint because the amount of energy-intensive fertilisers and fungicides remain the same for higher output of usable material. The technology for producing cellulosic ethanol is currently in the commercialization stage.

====Using biomass for electricity instead of ethanol====
Converting biomass to electricity for charging electric vehicles may be a more &quot;climate-friendly&quot; transportation option than using biomass to produce ethanol fuel, according to an analysis published in Science in May 2009. Researchers continue to search for more cost-effective developments in both cellulosic ethanol and advanced vehicle batteries.

====Health costs of ethanol emissions====
For each billion ethanol-equivalent gallons of fuel produced and combusted in the US, the combined climate-change and health costs are $469million for gasoline, $472–952million for corn ethanol depending on biorefinery heat source (natural gas, corn stover, or coal) and technology, but only $123–208million for cellulosic ethanol depending on feedstock (prairie biomass, Miscanthus, corn stover, or switchgrass).

==Efficiency of common crops==
As ethanol yields improve or different feedstocks are introduced, ethanol production may become more economically feasible in the US. Currently, research on improving ethanol yields from each unit of corn is underway using biotechnology. Also, as long as oil prices remain high, the economical use of other feedstocks, such as cellulose, becomes viable. By-products such as straw or wood chips can be converted to ethanol. Fast growing species like switchgrass can be grown on land not suitable for other cash crops and yield high levels of ethanol per unit area.
==Reduced petroleum imports and costs==
One rationale given for extensive ethanol production in the U.S. is its benefit to energy security, by shifting the need for some foreign-produced oil to domestically produced energy sources. Production of ethanol requires significant energy, but current U.S. production derives most of that energy from coal, natural gas and other sources, rather than oil. Because 66% of oil consumed in the U.S. is imported, compared to a net surplus of coal and just 16% of natural gas (figures from 2006), the displacement of oil-based fuels to ethanol produces a net shift from foreign to domestic U.S. energy sources.

According to a 2008 analysis by Iowa State University, the growth in US ethanol production has caused retail gasoline prices to be US$0.29 to US$0.40 per gallon lower than would otherwise have been the case.

==Motorsport==
Leon Duray qualified third for the 1927 Indianapolis 500 auto race with an ethanol-fueled car. The IndyCar Series adopted a 10% ethanol blend for the 2006 season, and a 98% blend in 2007.

The American Le Mans Series sports car championship introduced E10 in the 2007 season to replace pure gasoline. In the 2008 season, E85 was allowed in the GT class and teams began switching to it.

In 2011, the three national NASCAR stock car series mandated a switch from gasoline to E15, a blend of Sunoco GTX unleaded racing fuel and 15% ethanol.

Australia&#x27;s V8 Supercar championship uses Shell E85 for its racing fuel.

Stock Car Brasil Championship runs on neat ethanol, E100.

Ethanol fuel may also be utilized as a rocket fuel. , small quantities of ethanol are used in lightweight rocket-racing aircraft.

==Replacement cooking fuel==
Project Gaia is a U.S. non-governmental, non-profit organization involved in the creation of a commercially viable household market for alcohol-based fuels in Ethiopia and other countries in the developing world. The project considers alcohol fuels to be a solution to fuel shortages, environmental damage, and public health issues caused by traditional cooking in the developing world. Targeting poor and marginalized communities that face health issues from cooking over polluting fires, Gaia currently works in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Brazil, Haiti, and Madagascar, and is in the planning stage of projects in several other countries.

==Research==

Ethanol research focuses on alternative sources, novel catalysts and production processes. INEOS produced ethanol from vegetative material and wood waste. The bacterium E.coli when genetically engineered with cow rumen genes and enzymes can produce ethanol from corn stover. Other potential feedstocks are municipal waste, recycled products, rice hulls, sugarcane bagasse, wood chips, switchgrass and carbon dioxide.

<doc id="608625" wikidata="Q3495442" url="?curid=608625" title="Buffer overflow protection">
<text>Buffer overflow protection is any of various techniques used during software development to enhance the security of executable programs by detecting buffer overflows on stack-allocated variables, and preventing them from causing program misbehavior or from becoming serious security vulnerabilities. A stack buffer overflow occurs when a program writes to a memory address on the program&#x27;s call stack outside of the intended data structure, which is usually a fixed-length buffer. Stack buffer overflow bugs are caused when a program writes more data to a buffer located on the stack than what is actually allocated for that buffer. This almost always results in corruption of adjacent data on the stack, which could lead to program crashes, incorrect operation, or security issues.

Typically, buffer overflow protection modifies the organization of stack-allocated data so it includes a &quot;canary&quot; value that, when destroyed by a stack buffer overflow, shows that a buffer preceding it in memory has been overflowed. By verifying the canary value, execution of the affected program can be terminated, preventing it from misbehaving or from allowing an attacker to take control over it. Other buffer overflow protection techniques include &quot;bounds checking&quot;, which checks accesses to each allocated block of memory so they cannot go beyond the actually allocated space, and &quot;tagging&quot;, which ensures that memory allocated for storing data cannot contain executable code.

Overfilling a buffer allocated on the stack is more likely to influence program execution than overfilling a buffer on the heap because the stack contains the return addresses for all active function calls. However, similar implementation-specific protections also exist against heap-based overflows.

There are several implementations of buffer overflow protection, including those for the GNU Compiler Collection, LLVM, Microsoft Visual Studio, and other compilers.

==Overview==

A stack buffer overflow occurs when a program writes to a memory address on the program&#x27;s call stack outside of the intended data structure, which is usually a fixed-length buffer. Stack buffer overflow bugs are caused when a program writes more data to a buffer located on the stack than what is actually allocated for that buffer. This almost always results in corruption of adjacent data on the stack, and in cases where the overflow was triggered by mistake, will often cause the program to crash or operate incorrectly. Stack buffer overflow is a type of the more general programming malfunction known as buffer overflow (or buffer overrun). Overfilling a buffer on the stack is more likely to derail program execution than overfilling a buffer on the heap because the stack contains the return addresses for all active function calls.

Stack buffer overflow can be caused deliberately as part of an attack known as stack smashing. If the affected program is running with special privileges, or if it accepts data from untrusted network hosts (for example, a public webserver), then the bug is a potential security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject executable code into the running program and take control of the process. This is one of the oldest and more reliable methods for attackers to gain unauthorized access to a computer.

Typically, buffer overflow protection modifies the organization of data in the stack frame of a function call to include a &quot;canary&quot; value that, when destroyed, shows that a buffer preceding it in memory has been overflowed. This provides the benefit of preventing an entire class of attacks. According to some researchers, the performance impact of these techniques is negligible.

Stack-smashing protection is unable to protect against certain forms of attack. For example, it cannot protect against buffer overflows in the heap. There is no sane way to alter the layout of data within a structure; structures are expected to be the same between modules, especially with shared libraries. Any data in a structure after a buffer is impossible to protect with canaries; thus, programmers must be very careful about how they organize their variables and use their structures.

==Canaries==

&quot;Canaries&quot; or &quot;canary words&quot; or &quot;stack cookies&quot; are known values that are placed between a buffer and control data on the stack to monitor buffer overflows. When the buffer overflows, the first data to be corrupted will usually be the canary, and a failed verification of the canary data will therefore alert of an overflow, which can then be handled, for example, by invalidating the corrupted data. A canary value should not be confused with a sentinel value.

The terminology is a reference to the historic practice of using canaries in coal mines, since they would be affected by toxic gases earlier than the miners, thus providing a biological warning system. Canaries are alternately known as &quot;stack cookies&quot;, which is meant to evoke the image of a &quot;broken cookie&quot; when the value is corrupted.

There are three types of canaries in use: &quot;terminator&quot;, &quot;random&quot;, and &quot;random XOR&quot;. Current versions of StackGuard support all three, while ProPolice supports &quot;terminator&quot; and &quot;random&quot; canaries.

===Terminator canaries===
&quot;Terminator canaries&quot; use the observation that most buffer overflow attacks are based on certain string operations which end at string terminators. The reaction to this observation is that the canaries are built of null terminators, CR, LF, and FF. As a result, the attacker must write a null character before writing the return address to avoid altering the canary. This prevents attacks using codice_1 and other methods that return upon copying a null character, while the undesirable result is that the canary is known. Even with the protection, an attacker could potentially overwrite the canary with its known value and control information with mismatched values, thus passing the canary check code, which is executed soon before the specific processor&#x27;s return-from-call instruction.

===Random canaries===
&quot;Random canaries&quot; are randomly generated, usually from an entropy-gathering daemon, in order to prevent an attacker from knowing their value. Usually, it is not logically possible or plausible to read the canary for exploiting; the canary is a secure value known only by those who need to know it—the buffer overflow protection code in this case.

Normally, a random canary is generated at program initialization, and stored in a global variable. This variable is usually padded by unmapped pages so that attempting to read it using any kinds of tricks that exploit bugs to read off RAM cause a segmentation fault, terminating the program. It may still be possible to read the canary if the attacker knows where it is or can get the program to read from the stack.

===Random XOR canaries===
&quot;Random XOR canaries&quot; are random canaries that are XOR-scrambled using all or part of the control data. In this way, once the canary or the control data is clobbered, the canary value is wrong.

Random XOR canaries have the same vulnerabilities as random canaries, except that the &quot;read from stack&quot; method of getting the canary is a bit more complicated. The attacker must get the canary, the algorithm, and the control data in order to re-generate the original canary needed to spoof the protection.

In addition, random XOR canaries can protect against a certain type of attack involving overflowing a buffer in a structure into a pointer to change the pointer to point at a piece of control data. Because of the XOR encoding, the canary will be wrong if the control data or return value is changed. Because of the pointer, the control data or return value can be changed without overflowing over the canary.

Although these canaries protect the control data from being altered by clobbered pointers, they do not protect any other data or the pointers themselves. Function pointers especially are a problem here, as they can be overflowed into and can execute shellcode when called.

==Bounds checking==
Bounds checking is a compiler-based technique that adds run-time bounds information for each allocated block of memory, and checks all pointers against those at run-time. For C and C++, bounds checking can be performed at pointer calculation time or at dereference time.

Implementations of this approach use either a central repository, which describes each allocated block of memory, or fat pointers, which contain both the pointer and additional data, describing the region that they point to.

==Tagging==
Tagging is a compiler-based or hardware-based (requiring a tagged architecture) technique for tagging the type of a piece of data in memory, used mainly for type checking. By marking certain areas of memory as non-executable, it effectively prevents memory allocated to store data from containing executable code. Also, certain areas of memory can be marked as non-allocated, preventing buffer overflows.

Historically, tagging has been used for implementing high-level programming languages; with appropriate support from the operating system, tagging can also be used to detect buffer overflows. An example is the NX bit hardware feature, supported by Intel, AMD and ARM processors.

==Implementations==
===GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)===
Stack-smashing protection was first implemented by &quot;StackGuard&quot; in 1997, and published at the 1998 USENIX Security Symposium. StackGuard was introduced as a set of patches to the Intel x86 backend of GCC 2.7. StackGuard was maintained for the Immunix Linux distribution from 1998 to 2003, and was extended with implementations for terminator, random and random XOR canaries. StackGuard was suggested for inclusion in GCC 3.x at the GCC 2003 Summit Proceedings, but this was never achieved.

From 2001 to 2005, IBM developed GCC patches for stack-smashing protection, known as &quot;ProPolice&quot;. It improved on the idea of StackGuard by placing buffers after local pointers and function arguments in the stack frame. This helped avoid the corruption of pointers, preventing access to arbitrary memory locations.

Red Hat engineers identified problems with ProPolice though, and in 2005 re-implemented stack-smashing protection for inclusion in GCC 4.1. This work introduced the -fstack-protector flag, which protects only some vulnerable functions, and the -fstack-protector-all flag, which protects all functions whether they need it or not.

In 2012, Google engineers implemented the -fstack-protector-strong flag to strike a better balance between security and performance. This flag protects more kinds of vulnerable functions than -fstack-protector does, but not every function, providing better performance than -fstack-protector-all. It is available in GCC since its version 4.9.

All Fedora packages are compiled with -fstack-protector since Fedora Core 5, and -fstack-protector-strong since Fedora 20. Most packages in Ubuntu are compiled with -fstack-protector since 6.10. Every Arch Linux package is compiled with -fstack-protector since 2011. All Arch Linux packages built since 4 May 2014 use -fstack-protector-strong. Stack protection is only used for some packages in Debian, and only for the FreeBSD base system since 8.0. Stack protection is standard in certain operating systems, including OpenBSD, Hardened Gentoo and DragonFly BSD.

StackGuard and ProPolice cannot protect against overflows in automatically allocated structures that overflow into function pointers. ProPolice at least will rearrange the allocation order to get such structures allocated before function pointers. A separate mechanism for pointer protection was proposed in PointGuard and is available on Microsoft Windows.

===Microsoft Visual Studio===
The compiler suite from Microsoft implements buffer overflow protection since version 2003 through the command-line switch, which is enabled by default since version 2005. Using disables the protection.

===IBM Compiler===
Stack-smashing protection can be turned on by the compiler flag codice_2.

===Clang/LLVM===
Clang supports the same -fstack-protector options as GCC and a stronger &quot;safe stack&quot; () system with similarly low performance impact. Clang also has three buffer overflow detectors, namely AddressSanitizer (codice_3), UBSan (codice_4),
and the unofficial SafeCode (last updated for LLVM 3.0).

These systems have different tradeoffs in terms of performance penalty, memory overhead, and classes of detected bugs. Stack protection is standard in certain operating systems, including OpenBSD.

===Intel Compiler===
Intel&#x27;s C and C++ compiler supports stack-smashing protection with options similar to those provided by GCC and Microsoft Visual Studio.

=== Fail-Safe C ===
&quot;Fail-Safe C&quot; is an open-source memory-safe ANSI C compiler that performs bounds checking based on fat pointers and object-oriented memory access.

===StackGhost (hardware-based)===
Invented by Mike Frantzen, StackGhost is a simple tweak to the register window spill/fill routines which makes buffer overflows much more difficult to exploit. It uses a unique hardware feature of the Sun Microsystems SPARC architecture (that being: deferred on-stack in-frame register window spill/fill) to detect modifications of return pointers (a common way for an exploit to hijack execution paths) transparently, automatically protecting all applications without requiring binary or source modifications. The performance impact is negligible, less than one percent. The resulting gdb issues were resolved by Mark Kettenis two years later, allowing enabling of the feature. Following this event, the StackGhost code was integrated (and optimized) into OpenBSD/SPARC.

<doc id="608632" wikidata="Q4799541" url="?curid=608632" title="Arthur Lloyd (musician)">
<text>Arthur Lloyd (14 May 1839 – 20 July 1904) was a Scottish singer, songwriter, comedian and impresario. Lloyd was the first prolific and successful singer-songwriter for music hall in the United Kingdom. 

He wrote more than 1,000 songs, many of which were performed by himself and others. One of his compositions, &quot;Not for Joseph&quot; was the first comic song to sell more than 100,000 copies. He established his own theatre company, opened a theatre in London, performed for royalty and toured extensively, touring North America in 1893–94.

==Early life==
Arthur Rice Lloyd was born into a musical family in Edinburgh. His father was Horatio Lloyd, a comic actor based at the Theatre Royal, and his mother, Eliza Horncastle, was a member of the Pyne and Harrison Opera Company. The family lived at 7 Annandale Street, a large Georgian flat at the top of Leith Walk.

From an early age, the young Arthur expressed a desire for a career on the stage, however his father was initially resistant. In 1856 Arthur&#x27;s father agreed to send his son to the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, where Arthur&#x27;s uncle, (his father&#x27;s brother, Fred) was a leading actor. He spent two seasons at the Theatre Royal after which he performed with his father in Scotland. While on a break from the theatre, Arthur tried his hand at the music hall, giving his first appearance at the Minerva Hall in Glasgow. He secured an engagement at Glasgow&#x27;s Whitebait Music Hall in March 1861 and following a successful season, he headed to London where he gave his debut at the Sun Music Hall in Knightsbridge on 12 October 1862. In the same year, he also performed at the Marylebone Theatre and Philharmonic Music Halls.

==Career==
Lloyd achieved success early in his career. In 1863, the &quot;Song of Songs&quot; became a popular hit with copies of the sheet music being sold in the thousands. He had enormous popular success with &quot;Not For Joseph&quot; (1868), a tune that was inspired by a chance meeting with a London bus conductor, who spoke about himself in the third person. This became the first comic tune to sell more than 100,000 copies In the 1860s, Lloyd, along with contemporaries Alfred Peck Stevens and George Leybourne, were instrumental in developing a new style of music hall performer, known as the &quot;lion comique&quot; or &quot;swells.&quot; In this style, performers relied less on copying burlesque, and instead sought inspiration in their everyday experiences and the colourful characters of daily street life. Audiences loved to join in the chorus and &quot;give the bird.&quot;
Lloyd achieved great success with his character-songs in the 1870s. He wrote songs for his own performances, as well as for other artists. His repertoire specialised in Cockney songs with many titles devoted to the subject of costermongers. Unlike other music hall composers, his songs were not entirely dependent on the performer&#x27;s ability to mimic Cockney accents and mannerisms, but rather the lyrics used a &quot;quaintness of fancy&quot; and humour.

A prolific composer, Lloyd wrote over one thousand songs, most of them now forgotten, except for &quot;Married to a Mermaid&quot; (1866) which is occasionally sung in the UK. He performed for the Prince of Wales and other royalty on a few occasions (command performances). Lloyd was the first prolific and successful singer-songwriter for music hall.

As a performer, he toured extensively, working with leading actors, comedians and musicians of the period. He toured America and Canada during 1893–94 to produce his musical comedy, &quot;Our Party.&quot; Lloyd was also an impresario who operated his own theatrical company, known simply as Arthur Lloyd&#x27;s Musical Company.

==In popular culture==
The expression &quot;Not for Joseph&quot; or &quot;Not for Joe,&quot; from Lloyd&#x27;s music hall song of the same name, was in popular use as an expression until well after the first world war. Lines from Lloyd&#x27;s song &quot;Pretty Lips&quot; were quoted in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s book Stalky &amp; Co. The &quot;Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English&quot; credits Lloyd with popularising the term, &quot;toff&quot; to refer to a well-to-do person. 

The term most likely originated from an abbreviation of Cockney slang, where a toffee-nosed person was simplified to a &quot;toff.&quot; However, the popularity of Lloyd&#x27;s song the &quot;Shoreditch Toff&quot; did a great deal to ensure that the expression entered the popular lexicon.

Three of his songs are referenced in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

<text>A churchwarden pipe is a tobacco pipe with a long stem. The history of the pipe style is traced to the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century. Some churchwarden pipes can be as long as 16 inches (40 cm). In German the style is referred to as &quot;Lesepfeife&quot; or &quot;reading pipe&quot;, presumably because the longer stem allowed an unimpeded view of one&#x27;s book, and smoke does not form near the reader&#x27;s eyes, allowing one to look down.
==History==
Such pipes were very popular as an Oriental influence from the seventeenth century onwards in Europe. They remained most popular in Eastern Europe, as an emblem of the Hussars, cavalry troops with roots in Hungary and Poland, whose employment and influence spread from Russia to France and England during the Napoleonic Wars and brought the pipes with them as part of their characteristic dress. It was even known as the &quot;Hussar pipe&quot; at the time. Engraved portraits exist of men smoking such an instrument. This long stem pipe type has its origins in the Ottoman Empire, geographically and historically.

Clay churchwarden pipes were also used during the pioneer era in North America. Many clay pieces of these pipes have been found by archaeologists, giving rise to the myth that the long stems of the clay churchwarden pipes would, for sanitation purposes, be broken off by the next client of the tavern or saloon who wished to smoke. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, pipes were cleaned by being placed in iron cradles and baked in ovens. Examples of such clay pipes can be seen at the historic Fort Osage museum in Fort Osage, Missouri.

==Practical considerations==
Churchwarden pipes generally produce a cooler smoke due to the distance smoke must travel from the bowl to the mouthpiece. They have the added benefit of keeping the user&#x27;s face further away from the heat and smoke produced by combustion in the bowl. They are also more prone to breakage since more pressure is placed on the tenon when the pipe is supported around the mouthpiece. Long ago, churchwarden pipes were made of clay and were common in taverns, and sometimes a set of pipes would have been owned by the establishment and used by different clients like other service items (plates, tankards, etc.).
==Etymology==
Churchwarden pipes are reputedly named after churchwardens, who are lay members of a parish community with various official duties in the church. The long stem serves to keep smoke and heated tobacco away from the face and allow for unimpeded views. The pipe&#x27;s resemblance to the long &quot;candle snuffer&quot; used by Churchwardens in their duties is also a probable source for the name.

<doc id="608636" wikidata="Q5163043" url="?curid=608636" title="Conservative Future">
<text>Conservative Future (CF) was the youth movement of the Conservative Party in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The organisation was made up of all members of the Conservative Party who were 30 years old or younger.

Conservative Future was founded in 1998. By 2006, it was the largest political organisation on British campuses and the estimated membership, including members on campuses and through constituency associations may once have totalled 20,000.

Conservative Future Scotland was the independent sister organisation of CF in Scotland. Internationally, Conservative Future participated in the centre-right International Young Democrat Union. Within Europe, it was a founder member of the European Young Conservatives.

Conservative Future founder and former Leader of the House of Commons William Hague was announced as the Honorary President at the 2012 Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham.

It also sent delegates to the National Conservative Convention, the parliament of the party&#x27;s voluntary wing (Voluntary Party). 2015 was the last year CF sent delegates to the NCC.

==History==
Conservative Future was formed on 7 October 1998 as part of a major series of cross-party reforms introduced by then party leader William Hague. Part of the reforms including the merging of the three movements that specifically handled youth affairs within the party: the Young Conservatives, the Conservative Collegiate Forum, and the National Association of Conservative Graduates. The merger of the organisations into a single body was controversial and opposed by most members and officers of the three organisations at the time. A key change was that whereas members of the party &#x27;opted in&#x27; to join the three organisations, under the new unified organisation membership would be automatic for all members under 20. The name &#x27;Conservative Future&#x27; stems from the title of the party reforms &#x27;The Fresh Future&#x27; and was only intended to be temporary. The first national chairman was the last head of Conservative Graduates, Donal Blaney, followed by Gavin Megaw, who had been the chairman of Conservative Students in its last year of existence.

At its launch, the party&#x27;s national performance and dwindling activist base led to the closure of most former Young Conservative branches and student branches struggled to attract members. As formal membership records were not kept on a national database there have never been any accurate membership figures for the youth organisations before or after the creation of Conservative Future.

In 1999 Conservative Future attracted national attention following a re-branding exercise that used the slogan &quot;CFUK&quot;, a twist on the French Connection FCUK brand. The CFUK branding was to be used on promotional material for university branches from late August to mid October 1999 but the threat of court proceedings from French Connection over breach of copyright led to Conservative Future withdrawing the promotion in early October, just before the end of the campaign.

In 2002, Conservative Future gained two positions on the national executive committee of the National Union of Students, marking their first return in seven years. This was followed up by a national tour of universities, called &#x27;Politics Unplugged&#x27;, which involved ten Shadow Cabinet members and was aimed at making politicians more approachable. CF gained further traction in 2003 and 2004, after it was announced that the party announced it would scrap university tuition fees. In 2004 alone, membership rose by 3,000, but stagnated at 15,000 members until the election of David Cameron as party leader.

Cameron&#x27;s election was seen to be emblematic of a change of Conservative Future&#x27;s image to &#x27;cool&#x27;, replacing the symbolism of the &#x27;Tory Boy&#x27; stereotype of previous years. This occurred most dramatically from 2006 onwards, particularly in northern England. Described by Geordie Greig as &#x27;counter culture&#x27;, this change is ascribed to &#x27;Saatchi-isation&#x27;, named for former Party Chairman Maurice Saatchi, and ideological alignment to the so-called &#x27;Notting Hill Set&#x27; of the party leadership.

==Controversy and closure==

On 19 November 2015, the entire executive of the organisation was suspended, and the youth wing taken under direct control by the Conservative Party. Conservative youth materials for Freshers packs no longer feature Conservative Future branding. This followed months of newspaper speculation and eventually an exposé on &quot;Newsnight&quot;, after which the entire Executive of CF was removed, one member of which was an elected councillor in Essex.

Allegations of bullying, sexual crime and blackmail were made, centring on Mark Clarke, a [2015] executive with Unilever plc. Clarke headed both Road Trip 2015 and (2006–2008) Conservative Future. Clarke was expelled from the Conservative Party &quot;for life&quot; after senior members of the Conservative Party considered an internal report. Allegations against Clarke had included assertions that his behaviour had led to the suicide of a young activist and that Clarke had plotted to blackmail a Cabinet Minister, Robert Halfon MP, over an affair Halfon was conducting with another Road Trip 2015 activist and Conservative Future National Chair, 30-year-old Alexandra Paterson, a public relations employee and Ayn Rand devotee.

==Purpose==
CF&#x27;s purpose was to encourage Conservative Party values and assist in local and general elections. Conservative Future is aided in its aims by Members of Parliament (MPs) and Prospective Parliamentary Candidates (PPCs) with visits to branches. They participated in lectures, debates and many more activities. Many members of Conservative Future branches often went on to contest local and national elections, and the organisation as a whole was, by the end of its active life, increasingly turning to the internet to attract new active members.

Conservative Future also played an important role in the party&#x27;s campaigning. Described as the Conservative Party&#x27;s &#x27;shock troops&#x27;, CF made a major contribution to the parliamentary by-election victories in Crewe and Nantwich in 2008 and Norwich North in 2009. They were significantly more numerous, visible, and active than Labour&#x27;s young supporters in the 2008 London mayoral election, in which young voters were one of the key demographics of Boris Johnson&#x27;s vote. Michael Rock, Chairman of CF from 2008 to 2010, said that one of CF&#x27;s virtue is being able to take part in stunts and activities that older members can&#x27;t. A contingent from Conservative Future went to the United States to campaign for John McCain in the 2008 presidential election.

==Organisation==

===Branches===
Conservative Future branches varied in structure. It had branches at most British universities (many of which disaffiliated with CF and are still active); others are affiliated with city and town associations and aim to attract members from the non-student population. Some branches bring together both types of organisation. Newcastle-under-Lyme and Keele University Conservative Future is an example of a hybrid university and town branch. Some County areas operate, in effect, as one large branch, so that their members have more opportunities to get involved. While some CF branches still actively exist within local Parties, most have fallen into abeyance along with CF nationally.

===Regional College===
The Regional College included a voting body of Regional Chairmen from across the UK who co-ordinated campaign and membership activity in their regions, and chaired their Regional Executives. It was chaired by the Regional College Chairman, who was elected by fellow Regional Chairmen to one term, and represented the Regional College on the CF National Executive. The position was first established in December 2011, when then Northern Ireland Regional Chairman, Matthew Robinson, was elected as the inaugural Regional College Chairman. The last Regional College Chairman was Chris Rowell.

The last elected Regional Chairmen (elected in 2014) were:

*North West England – Anthony Harrison
*North East England – Isaac Duffy
*Yorkshire and the Humber – Chris Rowell
*West Midlands – Kurt Ward
*East Midlands – Samuel Armstrong 
*Eastern – Chantelle Whyborn
*South West England – Will Elliott 
*London – Luke Springthorpe
*South East England – Theodora Dickinson
*Northern Ireland – Ben Manton
*Wales – Ryan Hunter

Non-voting members of the Regional College also included; the Northern Conservative Future Partnership Chairman and representatives from the Conservative Future Scotland National Executive.
