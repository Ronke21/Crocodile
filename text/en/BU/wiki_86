<text>Buster is a 1988 British romantic crime comedy-drama based on events from the Great Train Robbery, starring Phil Collins and Julie Walters.

The supporting cast includes Larry Lamb and Shelia Hancock. The soundtrack features two singles from Collins, both of which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

==Plot==
Buster Edwards is a petty criminal from Lambeth in 1963 London. His long-suffering wife June thinks of him as a lovable rogue. The film opens with Buster walking along his local high street and breaking into a shop to steal a suit, which he then wears to a funeral. Also attending the funeral is police inspector Mitchell, who happens to be an old school friend of Buster and wants to &#x27;keep in touch&#x27;. Buster brings Harry, who has been used on other &#x27;jobs&#x27; and has recently served 18 months in prison, to discuss the next &#x27;job&#x27; with their ring-leader Bruce Reynolds. Harry wants &#x27;in&#x27; and becomes part of the firm who are planning to rob a Royal Mail train allegedly carrying up to £1 million in cash.

After a complex and successful heist, the gang return to their farmhouse hideout to stay out of sight and split the spoils. They find they have stolen over £3 million − much more than anticipated. While lying low at the farmhouse, they hear on the radio that the police (led by Mitchell) are searching farmhouses and outhouses within a radius of the robbery site. The gang become nervous and some members want to immediately return to London for fear of discovery; others think they should keep to the original plan and stay where they are.

The gang decide to return to London, where they meet their &#x27;contact&#x27;, a solicitor&#x27;s clerk who, as in the original plan, is to arrange for the farmhouse to be cleared and fully cleaned. The contact states he will bring the plans forward and have the cleaning done over the next two to three days. Bruce, Buster and Harry are not happy with any delay at all because they fear imminent discovery, so they set off back to the farmhouse, to do the job themselves. During the journey, they hear on the radio that the farmhouse hideout has been discovered, so they abandon their plans and return to London, hoping they will have time to escape with their families. Buster returns home and is devastated to find that June has had a miscarriage while he was committing the robbery. She cannot believe it when she learns of his involvement in what has been quickly dubbed &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;. Politicians, incensed that the gang are being treated as antiheroes by the newspapers, demand that they be punished with extraordinarily long prison sentences, and that no plea bargains (&quot;deals&quot;) will be offered to any of the accused.

Most of the gang are slowly rounded up by the police. Several months after the robbery, Buster and June remain in hiding with their young daughter Nicky until they are turned in by a suspicious neighbour. Mitchell and an army of officers arrive too late and discover that they have already fled. Meanwhile, Harry is also arrested by Mitchell, who defies his superiors to offer Harry a deal in return for disclosing Buster and Bruce&#x27;s whereabouts, but he refuses. Buster flees to Acapulco, where he is met by Bruce and his girlfriend Franny, who are also on the run and living it up in the sun on the proceeds of the crime. June and Nicky arrive later, despite the disapproval of her mother, and although Nicky seems to love her new life in the sun, June is immediately unimpressed and resolves to return to England, despite knowing that if Buster is to return with them he will be imprisoned. Buster remains in Acapulco after June leaves, until realising (while celebrating England&#x27;s 1966 World Cup triumph), that having money and the sun means nothing if he doesn&#x27;t have his family.

He returns to England, in the knowledge he will have to face justice, but in the hope that a deal with Mitchell to reduce his jail sentence will be available. He is quickly arrested and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Skipping forward to a later date after he has been released, Buster is seemingly content and running a flower stall near London&#x27;s Waterloo Bridge, but he breaks the fourth wall and explains to the audience he still has a &quot;dream&quot;, as he and June walk away as the end credits roll.

==Cast==
==Production==

Pre-production began in 1987, with Collins first being associated with the project during Genesis&#x27; tour for the 1986 album &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;.

The real Buster Edwards plays a small cameo during the arrival in Acapulco. He is seen walking out of the airport (62 minutes into the film) with his girlfriend, played by Phil Collins’ wife, just before Buster, June, and Nicky also leave.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack includes three songs that were performed by Phil Collins. Two of them were released as singles, namely &quot;A Groovy Kind of Love&quot; and &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, which reached #1 and #6 on the UK Singles Chart, respectively. Both songs were number one singles in the US.

==Controversy==
&quot;Buster&quot; generated controversy on its release because critics argued it made a hero out of Edwards and glamourised a brutal crime. Prince Charles and Princess Diana cancelled their attendance of the film&#x27;s premiere on 15 September 1988, on the advice of Phil Collins, due to the controversy around it. Collins said he wanted to avoid causing them &quot;embarrassment&quot;. One of the film&#x27;s critics was Conservative MP Ivor Stanbrook, who said the royal couple should not be associated with a film that &quot;commemorates a particularly sordid and vicious crime&quot;.

==Release==
The film opened 16 September 1988 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London and grossed £65,883 in its opening weekend, placing sixth at the UK box office despite playing in just one cinema. After expanding nationwide in its fifth week of release, it reached number one at the UK box office. The film went on to gross £3,939,329 ($7.2 million) in the UK, the highest-grossing independent film of the year; tenth highest-grossing film of the year and the third best British film behind &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; and &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;. In the United States and Canada, it grossed $540,000 (£300,000).

==Critical reception==
Reviews for the film were mixed, with praise for the lead performances but criticism of the film&#x27;s tone. &quot;Radio Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of five, stating: &quot;Too squeaky clean to be believable, this is an entertaining but fairy-tale view of law-breaking.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 3 out of 4 and wrote: &quot;Buster is played with surprising effectiveness by rock star Phil Collins, who looks and sounds like a gentler Bob Hoskins.&quot; &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; described the film as an &quot;uneasy combination of romantic comedy and chase thriller&quot;. Leonard Maltin gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing: &quot;Singer Collins&#x27; starring film debut is a diverting (if forgettable) yarn, with Walters a good match as his loving, long-suffering spouse.&quot; Maltin also wrote that the film had a &quot;great soundtrack&quot;.

<doc id="606615" wikidata="Q2824551" url="?curid=606615" title="Presidency of Gerald Ford">
<text>Gerald Ford&#x27;s tenure as the 38th president of the United States began on August 9, 1974, upon the resignation of President Richard Nixon, and ended on January 20, 1977. Ford, a Republican from Michigan, had been appointed vice president on December 6, 1973, following the resignation of Spiro Agnew from that office. Ford was the only person to serve as president without being elected to either the presidency or the vice presidency. His presidency ended following his narrow defeat in the 1976 presidential election to Democrat Jimmy Carter, after a period of days in office. His 895 day presidency remains the shortest of all U.S. presidents who did not die in office.

Ford took office in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and in the final stages of the Vietnam War, both of which engendered a new disillusion in American political institutions. Ford&#x27;s first major act upon taking office was to grant a presidential pardon to Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal, prompting a major backlash to Ford&#x27;s presidency. He also created a conditional clemency program for Vietnam War draft dodgers. 

Much of Ford&#x27;s focus in domestic policy was on the economy, which experienced a recession during his tenure. After initially promoting a tax increase designed to combat inflation, Ford championed a tax cut designed to rejuvenate the economy, and he signed two tax reduction acts into law. The foreign policy of the Ford administration was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the president. Overcoming significant congressional opposition, Ford continued Nixon&#x27;s détente policies with the Soviet Union.

In the 1976 presidential election, Ford was challenged by Ronald Reagan, a leader of the conservative wing of the Republican Party. After a contentious series of primaries, Ford narrowly won the nomination at the 1976 Republican National Convention. In the general election, Ford lost to Carter by a narrow margin in the popular and electoral vote. In polls of historians and political scientists, Ford is generally ranked as a below average president, much like both his predecessor and successor.

==Accession==


The Republican ticket of President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew won a landslide victory in the 1972 presidential election. Nixon&#x27;s second term was dominated by the Watergate scandal, which stemmed from a Nixon campaign group&#x27;s attempted burglary of the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s headquarters and the subsequent cover-up by the Nixon administration. Due to a scandal unrelated to Watergate, Vice President Agnew resigned on October 10, 1973. Under the terms of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Nixon nominated Ford as Agnew&#x27;s replacement. Nixon selected Ford, then the House Minority Leader and representative from Michigan&#x27;s 5th congressional district, largely because he was advised that Ford would be the most easily confirmed of the prominent Republican leaders. Ford was confirmed by overwhelming majorities in both houses of Congress, and he took office as vice president in December 1973.

In the months after his confirmation as vice president, Ford continued to support Nixon&#x27;s innocence with regards to Watergate, even as evidence mounted that the Nixon administration had ordered the break-in and subsequently sought to cover it up. In July 1974, after the Supreme Court ordered Nixon to turn over recordings of certain meetings he had held as president, the House Judiciary Committee voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Nixon. After the tapes became public and clearly showed that Nixon had taken part in the cover-up, Nixon summoned Ford to the Oval Office on August 8, where Nixon informed Ford that he would resign. Nixon formally resigned on August 9, making Ford the first President of the United States who had not been elected as either president or vice president.

Immediately after taking the oath of office in the East Room of the White House, Ford spoke to the assembled audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation. Ford noted the peculiarity of his position: &quot;I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers.&quot; He went on to state:

==Administration==

===Cabinet===

Upon assuming office, Ford inherited Nixon&#x27;s cabinet, although Ford quickly replaced Chief of Staff Alexander Haig with Donald Rumsfeld, who had served as a Counselor to the President under Nixon. Rumsfeld and Deputy Chief of Staff Dick Cheney rapidly became among the most influential people in the Ford administration. Ford also appointed Edward H. Levi as Attorney General, charging Levi with cleaning up a Justice Department that had been politicized to unprecedented levels during the Nixon administration. Ford brought in Philip W. Buchen, Robert T. Hartmann, L. William Seidman, and John O. Marsh as senior advisers with cabinet rank. Ford placed a far greater value in his cabinet officials than Nixon had, though cabinet members did not regain the degree of influence they had held prior to World War II. Levi, Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, Secretary of the Treasury William E. Simon, and Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger all emerged as influential cabinet officials early in Ford&#x27;s tenure.

Most of the Nixon holdovers in cabinet stayed in place until Ford&#x27;s dramatic reorganization in the fall of 1975, an action referred to by political commentators as the &quot;Halloween Massacre&quot;. Ford appointed George H. W. Bush as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, while Rumsfeld became Secretary of Defense and Cheney replaced Rumsfeld as Chief of Staff, becoming the youngest individual to hold that position. The moves were intended to fortify Ford&#x27;s right flank against a primary challenge from Ronald Reagan. Though Kissinger remained as Secretary of State, Brent Scowcroft replaced Kissinger as National Security Advisor.

===Vice presidency===

Ford&#x27;s accession to the presidency left the office of vice president vacant. On August 20, 1974, Ford nominated Nelson Rockefeller, the leader of the party&#x27;s liberal wing, for the vice presidency. Rockefeller and former Representative George H. W. Bush from Texas were the two finalists for vice presidential nomination, and Ford chose Rockefeller in part due to a &quot;Newsweek&quot; report that revealed that Bush had accepted money from a Nixon slush fund during his 1970 Senate campaign. Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress, which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides, including Kissinger. Although conservative Republicans were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked, most of them voted for his confirmation, and his nomination passed both the House and Senate. He was sworn in as the nation&#x27;s 41st vice president on December 19, 1974. Prior to Rockefeller&#x27;s confirmation, Speaker of the House Carl Albert was next in line to the presidency. Ford promised to give Rockefeller a major role in shaping the domestic policy of the administration, but Rockefeller was quickly sidelined by Rumsfeld and other administration officials.

===Executive Privilege===
In the wake of Nixon&#x27;s heavy use of executive privilege to block investigations of his actions, Ford was scrupulous in minimizing its usage. However, that complicated his efforts to keep congressional investigations under control. Political scientist Mark J. Rozell concludes that Ford&#x27;s:
: failure to enunciate a formal executive privilege policy made it more difficult to explain his position to Congress. He concludes that Ford&#x27;s actions were prudent; they likely salvaged executive privilege from the graveyard of eroded presidential entitlements because of his recognition that the Congress was likely to challenge any presidential use of that unpopular perquisite.

==Judicial appointments==
Ford made one appointment to the Supreme Court while in office, appointing John Paul Stevens to succeed Associate Justice William O. Douglas. Upon learning of Douglas&#x27;s impending retirement, Ford asked Attorney General Levi to submit a short list of potential Supreme Court nominees, and Levi suggested Stevens, Solicitor General Robert Bork, and federal judge Arlin Adams. Ford chose Stevens, an uncontroversial federal appellate judge, largely because he was likely to face the least opposition in the Senate. Early in his tenure on the Court, Stevens had a relatively moderate voting record, but in the 1990s he emerged as a leader of the Court&#x27;s liberal bloc. In 2005 Ford wrote, &quot;I am prepared to allow history&#x27;s judgment of my term in office to rest (if necessary, exclusively) on my nomination 30 years ago of Justice John Paul Stevens to the U.S. Supreme Court&quot;. Ford also appointed 11 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 50 judges to the United States district courts.

==Domestic affairs==
===Nixon pardon===

Along with the experience of the Vietnam War and other issues, Watergate contributed to a decline in the faith that Americans placed in political institutions. Low public confidence added to Ford&#x27;s already formidable challenge of establishing his own administration without a presidential transition period or the popular mandate of a presidential election. Though Ford became widely popular during his first month in office, he faced a difficult situation regarding the fate of former President Nixon, whose status threatened to undermine the Ford administration. In the final days of Nixon&#x27;s presidency, Haig had floated the possibility of Ford pardoning Nixon, but no deal had been struck between Nixon and Ford before Nixon&#x27;s resignation. Nonetheless, when Ford took office, most of the Nixon holdovers in the executive branch, including Haig and Kissinger, pressed for a pardon. Through his first month in office, Ford publicly kept his options open regarding a pardon, but he came to believe that ongoing legal proceedings against Nixon would prevent his administration from addressing any other issue. Ford attempted to extract a public statement of contrition from Nixon before issuing the pardon, but Nixon refused.

On September 8, 1974, Ford issued Proclamation 4311, which gave Nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he might have committed against the United States while president. In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country, and that the Nixon family&#x27;s situation &quot;is a tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must.&quot;

The Nixon pardon was highly controversial, and Gallup polling showed that Ford&#x27;s approval rating fell from 71 percent before the pardon to 50 percent immediately after the pardon. Critics derided the move and said a &quot;corrupt bargain&quot; had been struck between the men. In an editorial at the time, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the Nixon pardon was a &quot;profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act&quot; that in a stroke had destroyed the new president&#x27;s &quot;credibility as a man of judgment, candor and competence&quot;. Ford&#x27;s close friend and press secretary, Jerald terHorst, resigned his post in protest. The pardon would hang over Ford for the remainder of his presidency, and damaged his relationship with members of Congress from both parties. Against the advice of most of his advisers, Ford agreed to appear before a House Subcommittee that requested further information on the pardon. On October 17, 1974, Ford testified before Congress, becoming the first sitting president since Woodrow Wilson to do so.

After Ford left the White House, the former president privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of &quot;Burdick v. United States&quot;, a 1915 Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt.

===Clemency for draft dodgers===
During the Vietnam War, about one percent of American men of eligible age for the draft failed to register, and approximately one percent of those who were drafted refused to serve. Those who refused conscription were labeled as &quot;draft dodgers&quot;; many such individuals had left the country for Canada, but others remained in the United States. Ford had opposed any form of amnesty for the draft dodgers while in Congress, but his presidential advisers convinced him that a clemency program would help resolve a contentious issue and boost Ford&#x27;s public standing. On September 16, 1974, shortly after he announced the Nixon pardon, Ford introduced a presidential clemency program for Vietnam War draft dodgers. The conditions of the clemency required a reaffirmation of allegiance to the United States and two years of work in a public service position. The program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters established a Clemency Board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a presidential pardon and a change in military discharge status. Ford&#x27;s clemency program was accepted by most conservatives, but attacked by those on the left who wanted a full amnesty program. Full pardon for draft dodgers would later come in the Carter Administration.

===1974 midterm elections===
The 1974 congressional midterm elections took place less than three months after Ford assumed office. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the House of Representatives elections, taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. Even Ford&#x27;s former House seat was won by a Democrat. In the Senate elections, the Democrats increased their majority to 61 seats in the 100-seat body. The subsequent 94th Congress would override the highest percentage of vetoes since Andrew Johnson served as president in the 1860s. Ford&#x27;s successful vetoes, however, resulted in the lowest yearly spending increases since the Eisenhower administration. Buoyed by the new class of &quot;Watergate Babies,&quot; liberal Democrats implemented reforms designed to ease the passage of legislation. The House began to select committee chairs by secret ballot rather than through seniority, resulting in the removal of some conservative Southern committee chairs. The Senate, meanwhile, lowered the number of votes necessary to end a filibuster from 67 to 60.

Ford was at odds with the liberal Democratic majority in Congress during his presidency, as he reflected in his autobiography:

=== Economy ===
By the time Ford took office, the U.S. economy had entered into a period of stagflation, which economists attributed to various causes, including the 1973 oil crisis and increasing competition from countries such as Japan. Stagflation confounded the traditional economic theories of the 1970s, as economists generally believed that an economy would not simultaneously experience inflation and low rates of economic growth. Traditional economic remedies for a dismal economic growth rate, such as tax cuts and increased spending, risked exacerbating inflation. The conventional response to inflation, tax increases and a cut in government spending, risked damaging the economy. The economic troubles, which signaled the end of the post-war boom, created an opening for a challenge to the dominant Keynesian economics, and laissez-faire advocates such as Alan Greenspan acquired influence within the Ford administration. Ford seized the initiative, abandoned 40 years of orthodoxy, and introduced a new conservative economic agenda as he sought to adapt traditional Republican economics to deal with the novel economic challenges.

At the time that he took office, Ford believed that inflation, rather than a potential recession, represented the greatest threat to the economy. He believed that inflation could be reduced, not by reducing the amount of new currency entering circulation, but by encouraging people to reduce their spending. In October 1974, Ford went before the American public and asked them to &quot;Whip Inflation Now&quot;. As part of this program, he urged people to wear &quot;WIN&quot; buttons. To try to mesh service and sacrifice, &quot;WIN&quot; called for Americans to reduce their spending and consumption, especially with regards to gasoline. Ford hoped that the public would respond to this call for self-restraint much as it had to President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s calls for sacrifice during World War II, but the public received WIN with skepticism. At roughly the same time he rolled out WIN, Ford also proposed a ten-point economic plan. The central plank of the plan was a tax increase on corporations and high earners, which Ford hoped would both quell inflation and cut into government&#x27;s budget deficit.

Ford&#x27;s economic focus changed as the country sank into the worst recession since the Great Depression. In November 1974, Ford withdrew his proposed tax increase. Two months later, Ford proposed a 1-year tax reduction of $16 billion to stimulate economic growth, along with spending cuts to avoid inflation. Having switched from advocating for a tax increase to advocating a tax reduction in just two months, Ford was greatly criticized for his &quot;flip-flop&quot;. Congress responded by passing a plan that implemented deeper tax cuts and an increase in government spending. Ford seriously considered vetoing the bill, but ultimately chose to sign the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 into law. In October 1975, Ford introduced a bill designed to combat inflation through a mix of tax and spending cuts. That December, Ford signed the Revenue Adjustment Act of 1975, which implemented tax and spending cuts, albeit not at the levels proposed by Ford. The economy recovered in 1976, as both inflation and unemployment declined. Nonetheless, by late 1976 Ford faced considerable discontent over his handling of the economy, and the government had a $74 billion deficit.

===Rockefeller Commission===
Prior to Ford&#x27;s presidency, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had illegally assembled files on domestic anti-war activists. In the aftermath of Watergate, CIA Director William Colby put together a report of all of the CIA&#x27;s domestic activities, and much of the report became public, beginning with the publication of a December 1974 article by investigative journalist Seymour Hersh. The revelations sparked outrage among the public and members of Congress. In response to growing pressure to investigate and reform the CIA, Ford created the Rockefeller Commission. The Rockefeller Commission marked the first time that a presidential commission was established to investigate the national security apparatus. The Rockefeller Commission&#x27;s report, submitted in June 1975, generally defended the CIA, although it did note that &quot;the CIA has engaged in some activities that should be criticized and not permitted to happen again.&quot; The press strongly criticized the commission for failing to include a section on the CIA&#x27;s assassination plots. The Senate created its own committee, led by Senator Frank Church, to investigate CIA abuses. Ford feared that the Church Committee would be used for partisan purposes and resisted turning over classified materials, but Colby cooperated with the committee. In response to the Church Committee&#x27;s report, both houses of Congress established select committees to provide oversight to the intelligence community.

=== Environment ===

Due to the frustration of environmentalists left over from the Nixon days, including Environmental Protection Agency head Russell E. Train, environmentalism was a peripheral issue during the Ford years. Secretary of the Interior Thomas S. Kleppe was a leader of the &quot;Sagebrush Rebellion&quot;, a movement of western ranchers and other groups that sought the repeal of environmental protections on federal land. They lost repeatedly in the federal courts, most notably in the 1976 Supreme Court decision of &quot;Kleppe v. New Mexico&quot;. Ford&#x27;s successes included the addition of two national monuments, six historical sites, three historic parks and two national preserves. None were controversial. In the international field, treaties and agreements with Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, the Soviet Union and several European countries included provisions to protect endangered species.

=== Social issues ===
Ford and his wife were outspoken supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), a proposed constitutional amendment that had been submitted to the states for ratification in 1972. The ERA was designed to ensure equal rights for all citizens regardless of gender. Despite Ford&#x27;s support, the ERA would fail to win ratification by the necessary number of state legislatures.

As president, Ford&#x27;s position on abortion was that he supported &quot;a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the 50 States to make the choice&quot;. This had also been his position as House Minority Leader in response to the 1973 Supreme Court case of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, which he opposed. Ford came under criticism for a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview his wife Betty gave in 1975, in which she stated that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was a &quot;great, great decision&quot;. During his later life, Ford would identify as pro-choice.

=== Campaign finance ===

After the 1972 elections, good government groups like Common Cause pressured Congress to amend campaign finance law to restrict the role of money in political campaigns. In 1974, Congress approved amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act, establishing the Federal Election Commission to oversee campaign finance laws. The amendments also established a system of public financing for presidential elections, limited the size of campaign contributions, limited the amount of money that candidates could spend on their own campaigns, and required the disclosure of nearly all campaign contributions. Ford reluctantly signed the bill into law in October 1974. In the 1976 case of &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot;, the Supreme Court overturned the cap on self-funding by political candidates, holding that such a restriction violated freedom of speech rights. The campaign finance reforms of the 1970s were largely unsuccessful in lessening the influence of money in politics, as more contributions shifted to political action committees and state and local party committees.

=== Court ordered busing to desegregate public schools ===

In 1971, the United States Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; that &quot;Busing was a permissible tool for desegregation purposes.&quot; However, in the closing days of the Nixon administration, the Supreme Court largely eliminated District Court ability to order busing across city and suburban systems in the case of &quot;Milliken v. Bradley.&quot; It meant that disgruntled white families could move to the suburbs and not be reached by court orders regarding segregation of the central city schools. Ford, representing a Michigan district, had always taken the position in favor of the goal of school desegregation but opposition to court-ordered forced busing as a means of achieving it. In the first major bill he signed as president, Ford&#x27;s compromise solution was to win over the general population with mild anti-busing legislation. He condemned anti-busing violence, promoted the theoretical goal of school desegregation, and promised to uphold the Constitution. The problem did not go away – it only escalated and remained on the front burner for years. Tension exploded in Boston, where working-class Irish neighborhoods inside the city limits violently resisted court-ordered busing of black children into their schools.

=== Other domestic issues ===

When New York City faced bankruptcy in 1975, Mayor Abraham Beame was unsuccessful in obtaining Ford&#x27;s support for a federal bailout. The incident prompted the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;&#x27; famous headline &quot;Ford to City: Drop Dead&quot;, referring to a speech in which &quot;Ford declared flatly ... that he would veto any bill calling for &#x27;a federal bail-out of New York City. The following month, November 1975, Ford changed his stance and asked Congress to approve federal loans to New York City, upon the condition that the city agree to more austere budgets imposed by Washington, D.C. In December 1975, Ford signed a bill providing New York City with access to $2.3 billion in loans.

Despite his reservations about how the program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight public budgeting, Ford signed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, which established special education throughout the United States. Ford expressed &quot;strong support for full educational opportunities for our handicapped children&quot; upon signing the bill.

Ford was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic. In the early 1970s, an influenza strain H1N1 shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans. On February 5, 1976, an army recruit at Fort Dix mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized; health officials announced that &quot;swine flu&quot; was the cause. Soon after, public health officials in the Ford administration urged that every person in the United States be vaccinated. Although the vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems, some 25% of the population was vaccinated by the time the program was canceled in December 1976. The vaccine was alleged to have been a factor in twenty-five deaths.

==Foreign affairs==


===Cold War===

Ford continued Nixon&#x27;s détente policy with both the Soviet Union and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War. In doing so, he overcame opposition from members of Congress, an institution which became increasingly assertive in foreign affairs in the early 1970s. This opposition was led by Senator Henry M. Jackson, who scuttled a U.S.–Soviet trade agreement by winning passage of the Jackson–Vanik amendment. The thawing relationship with China brought about by Nixon&#x27;s 1972 visit to China was reinforced with another presidential visit in December 1975.

Despite the collapse of the trade agreement with the Soviet Union, Ford and Soviet Leader Leonid Brezhnev continued the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, which had begun under Nixon. In 1972, the U.S. and the Soviet Union had reached the SALT I treaty, which placed upper limits on each power&#x27;s nuclear arsenal. Ford met Brezhnev at the November 1974 Vladivostok Summit, at which point the two leaders agreed to a framework for another SALT treaty. Opponents of détente, led by Jackson, delayed Senate consideration of the treaty until after Ford left office.

====Helsinki Accords====
When Ford took office in August 1974, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) negotiations had been underway in Helsinki, Finland, for nearly two years. Throughout much of the negotiations, U.S. leaders were disengaged and uninterested with the process; Kissinger told Ford in 1974 that &quot;we never wanted it but we went along with the Europeans ... [i]t is meaningless—it is just a grandstand play to the left. We are going along with it.&quot; In the months leading up to the conclusion of negotiations and signing of the Helsinki Final Act in August 1975, Americans of Eastern European descent voiced their concerns that the agreement would mean the acceptance of Soviet domination over Eastern Europe and the permanent incorporation of the Baltic states into the USSR. Shortly before President Ford departed for Helsinki, he held a meeting with a delegation of Americans of Eastern European background, and stated definitively that U.S. policy on the Baltic States would not change, but would be strengthened since the agreement denies the annexation of territory in violation of international law and allows for the peaceful change of borders.

The American public remained unconvinced that American policy on the incorporation of the Baltic States would not be changed by the Helsinki Final Act. Despite protests from all around, Ford decided to move forward and sign the Helsinki Agreement. As domestic criticism mounted, Ford hedged on his support for the Helsinki Accords, which had the impact of overall weakening his foreign-policy stature. Though Ford was criticized for his apparent recognition of the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, the new emphasis on human rights would eventually contribute to the weakening of the Eastern bloc in the 1980s and speed up its collapse in 1989.

===Vietnam===
One of Ford&#x27;s greatest challenges was dealing with the ongoing Vietnam War. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American prisoners of war. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the Geneva Conference of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu was not involved in the final negotiations, and publicly criticized the proposed agreement, but was pressured by Nixon and Kissinger into signing the agreement. In multiple letters to the South Vietnamese president, Nixon had promised that the United States would defend Thieu&#x27;s government, should the North Vietnamese violate the accords.

Fighting in Vietnam continued after the withdrawal of most U.S. forces in early 1973. As North Vietnamese forces advanced in early 1975, Ford requested Congress approve a $722 million aid package for South Vietnam, funds that had been promised by the Nixon administration. Congress voted against the proposal by a wide margin. Senator Jacob K. Javits offered &quot;...large sums for evacuation, but not one nickel for military aid&quot;. Thieu resigned on April 21, 1975, publicly blaming the lack of support from the United States for the fall of his country. Two days later, on April 23, Ford gave a speech at Tulane University, announcing that the Vietnam War was over &quot;...as far as America is concerned&quot;.

With the North Vietnamese forces advancing on the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon, Ford ordered the evacuation of U.S. personnel, while also allowing U.S. forces to aid others who wished to escape from the Communist advance. Forty thousand U.S. citizens and South Vietnamese were evacuated by plane until enemy attacks made further such evacuations impossible. In Operation Frequent Wind, the final phase of the evacuation preceding the fall of Saigon on April 30, military and Air America helicopters took evacuees to off-shore U.S. Navy vessels. During the operation, so many South Vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make room for more people.

The Vietnam War, which had raged since the 1950s, finally came to an end with the Fall of Saigon, and Vietnam was reunified into one country. Many of the Vietnamese evacuees were allowed to enter the United States under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act. The 1975 act appropriated $455 million toward the costs of assisting the settlement of Indochinese refugees. In all, 130,000 Vietnamese refugees came to the United States in 1975. Thousands more escaped in the years that followed. Following the end of the war, Ford expanded the embargo of North Vietnam to cover all of Vietnam, blocked Vietnam&#x27;s accession to the United Nations, and refused to establish full diplomatic relations.

===Mayaguez and Panmunjom===

North Vietnam&#x27;s victory over the South led to a considerable shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S. influence in the region. The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region when Khmer Rouge forces seized an American ship in international waters.

In May 1975, shortly after the fall of Saigon and the Khmer Rouge conquest of Cambodia, Cambodians seized the American merchant ship &quot;Mayaguez&quot; in international waters, sparking the Mayaguez incident. Ford dispatched Marines to rescue the crew from an island where the crew was believed to be held, but the Marines met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as, unknown to the U.S., the crew were being released. In the operation, three military transport helicopters were shot down and 41 U.S. servicemen were killed and 50 wounded while approximately 60 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed. Despite American losses, the rescue operation proved to be a boon to Ford&#x27;s poll numbers; Senator Barry Goldwater declared that the operation &quot;shows we&#x27;ve still got balls in this country.&quot; Some historians have argued that the Ford administration felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot. But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration&#x27;s internal discussions, shows that Ford&#x27;s national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.

===Middle East===

In the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, two ongoing international disputes developed into crises during Ford&#x27;s presidency. The Cyprus dispute turned into a crisis with the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which took place following the Greek-backed 1974 Cypriot coup d&#x27;état. The dispute put the United States in a difficult position as both Greece and Turkey were members of NATO. In mid-August, the Greek government withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September 1974, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford vetoed the bill due to concerns regarding its effect on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO&#x27;s eastern front. A second bill was then passed by Congress, which Ford also vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until the end of the year. As Ford expected, Turkish relations were considerably disrupted until 1978.

In 1973, Egypt and Syria had launched a joint surprise attack against Israel, seeking to re-take land lost in the Six-Day War of 1967. However, early Arab success gave way to an Israel military victory in what became known as the Yom Kippur War. Although an initial cease fire had been implemented to end active conflict in the Yom Kippur War, Kissinger&#x27;s continuing shuttle diplomacy was showing little progress. Ford disliked what he saw as Israeli &quot;stalling&quot; on a peace agreement, and wrote, &quot;[Israeli] tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell.&quot; During Kissinger&#x27;s shuttle to Israel in early March 1975, a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal, prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, which included:
On March 24, Ford informed congressional leaders of both parties of the reassessment of the administration policies in the Middle East. &quot;Reassessment&quot;, in practical terms, meant canceling or suspending further aid to Israel. For six months between March and September 1975, the United States refused to conclude any new arms agreements with Israel. Rabin notes it was &quot;an innocent-sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in American-Israeli relations&quot;. The announced reassessments upset many American supporters of Israel. On May 21, Ford &quot;experienced a real shock&quot; when seventy-six U.S. senators wrote him a letter urging him to be &quot;responsive&quot; to Israel&#x27;s request for $2.59 billion in military and economic aid. Ford felt truly annoyed and thought the chance for peace was jeopardized. It was, since the September 1974 ban on arms to Turkey, the second major congressional intrusion upon the President&#x27;s foreign policy prerogatives. The following summer months were described by Ford as an American-Israeli &quot;war of nerves&quot; or &quot;test of wills&quot;. After much bargaining, the Sinai Interim Agreement (Sinai II) between Egypt and Israel was formally signed, and aid resumed.

===Angola===
A civil war broke out in Angola after the fledgling African nation gained independence from Portugal in 1975. The Soviet Union and Cuba both became heavily involved in the conflict, backing the left-wing MPLA, one of the major factions in the civil war. In response, the CIA directed aid to two other factions in the war, UNITA and the FNLA. After members of Congress learned of the CIA operation, Congress voted to cut off aid to the Angolan groups. The Angolan Civil War would continue in subsequent years, but the Soviet role in the war hindered détente. Congress&#x27;s role in ending the CIA presence marked the growing power of the legislative branch in foreign affairs.

====South Africa====
During the Ford administration, the United States began to distance itself from the apartheid regime of South Africa&#x27;s nuclear weapons program. By this point, however, the program was highly advanced, and this policy shift was, by this point, too late in time to significantly stall the apartheid regime&#x27;s ultimate goal of developing a nuclear deterrent.

===Indonesia and East Timor===
U.S. policy since the 1940s has been to support Indonesia, which hosted American investments in petroleum and raw materials and controlled a highly strategic location near vital shipping lanes. In 1975, the left-wing Fretilin party seized power after a civil war in East Timor (now Timor-Leste), a former colony of Portugal that shared the island of Timor with the Indonesian region of West Timor. Indonesian leaders feared that East Timor would serve as a hostile left-wing base that would promote secessionist movements inside Indonesia. Anti-Fretilin activists from the other main parties fled to West Timor and called upon Indonesia to annex East Timor and end the communist threat. On December 7, 1975, Ford and Kissinger met Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta. Suharto discussed the plans to invade East Timor; both Ford and Kissinger indicated the United States would not take a position on East Timor. Indonesia invaded the next day, and annexed the country. A bloody civil war broke out, and over one hundred thousand died in the fighting or from executions or starvation. Upwards of half of the population of East Timor became refugees fleeing Fretilin-controlled areas between 1975 and 1981. Later, after international intervention in the 1999 East Timorese crisis, East Timor became an independent nation in 2002.

===List of international trips===

==Assassination attempts==

Ford faced two assassination attempts during his presidency. In Sacramento, California, on September 5, 1975, Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, pointed a Colt .45-caliber handgun at Ford. As Fromme pulled the trigger, Larry Buendorf, a Secret Service agent, grabbed the gun, and Fromme was taken into custody. She was later convicted of attempted assassination of the President and was sentenced to life in prison; she was paroled on August 14, 2009.

In reaction to this attempt, the Secret Service began keeping Ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds, a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later. As he left the St. Francis Hotel in downtown San Francisco, Sara Jane Moore, standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street, pointed her .38-caliber revolver at him. Moore fired a single round but missed because the sights were off. Just before she fired a second round, retired Marine Oliver Sipple grabbed at the gun and deflected her shot; the bullet struck a wall about six inches above and to the right of Ford&#x27;s head, then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver, who was slightly wounded. Moore was later sentenced to life in prison. She was paroled on December 31, 2007, after serving 32 years.

==1976 presidential election==


Ford made the first major decision of his campaign in mid-1975, when he selected Bo Callaway to run his campaign. The pardon of Nixon and the disastrous 1974 mid-term elections weakened Ford&#x27;s standing within the party, creating an opening for a competitive Republican primary. The intra-party challenge to Ford came from the conservative wing of the party; many conservative leaders had viewed Ford as insufficiently conservative throughout his political career. Conservative Republicans were further disappointed with the selection of Rockefeller as vice president, and faulted Ford for the fall of Saigon, the amnesty for draft dodgers, and the continuation of détente policies. Ronald Reagan, a leader among the conservatives, launched his campaign in autumn of 1975. Hoping to appease his party&#x27;s right wing and sap Reagan&#x27;s momentum, Ford requested that Rockefeller not seek election and the vice president agreed to this request. Ford defeated Reagan in the first several primaries, but Reagan gained momentum after winning North Carolina&#x27;s March 1976 primary. Entering the 1976 Republican National Convention, neither Ford nor Reagan had won a majority of delegates through the primaries, but Ford was able to win the support of enough unpledged delegates to win the presidential nomination. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas won the vice presidential nomination.

In the aftermath of the Vietnam War and Watergate, Ford campaigned at a time of cynicism and disillusionment with government. Ford adopted a &quot;Rose Garden strategy&quot;, with Ford mostly staying in Washington in an attempt to appear presidential. The campaign benefited from several anniversary events held during the period leading up to the United States Bicentennial. The Washington fireworks display on the Fourth of July was presided over by the president and televised nationally. The 200th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts gave Ford the opportunity to deliver a speech to 110,000 in Concord acknowledging the need for a strong national defense tempered with a plea for &quot;reconciliation, not recrimination&quot; and &quot;reconstruction, not rancor&quot; between the United States and those who would pose &quot;threats to peace&quot;. Speaking in New Hampshire on the previous day, Ford condemned the growing trend toward big government bureaucracy and argued for a return to &quot;basic American virtues&quot;.

Eleven major contenders competed in the 1976 Democratic primaries. At the start of the primaries, former Governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia was little-known nationally, but he rocketed to prominence with a victory in the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary. A born again Christian, Carter emphasized his personal morality and his status as a Washington outsider. Carter won the presidential nomination on the first ballot of the 1976 Democratic National Convention, and selected liberal Senator Walter Mondale of Minnesota as his running mate. Carter began the race with a huge lead in the polls, but committed a major gaffe by giving an interview to &quot;Playboy&quot; in which he stated that &quot;I&#x27;ve committed adultery in my heart several times.&quot; Ford made his own gaffe during a televised debate, stating that &quot;there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.&quot; In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the &quot;spirits&quot; of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner Max Frankel was visibly incredulous at the response. As a result of this blunder, Ford&#x27;s surge stalled and Carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls.

In the end, Carter won the election, receiving 50.1% of the popular vote and 297 electoral votes compared with 48.0% of the popular vote and 240 electoral votes for Ford. Ford dominated in the West and performed well in New England, but Carter carried much of the South and won Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Though Ford lost, in the three months between the Republican National Convention and the election he had managed to close what polls had shown as a 33-point Carter lead to a 2-point margin.

==Historical reputation==

Polls of historians and political scientists have generally ranked Ford as a below-average president. A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association&#x27;s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Ford as the 25th best president. A 2017 C-SPAN poll of historians also ranked Ford as the 25th best president. Historian John Robert Greene writes that &quot;Ford had difficulty navigating a demanding political environment.&quot; He also notes, however, that &quot;Americans, by and large, believed that Gerald Ford was an innately decent and good man and that he would (and did) bring honor to the White House. Although this sentiment proved too little to bring Ford to victory in 1976, it is an assessment that most Americans and scholars still find valid in the years after his presidency.&quot;

<doc id="606626" wikidata="Q10962705" url="?curid=606626" title="Emperor of Ethiopia">
<text>The emperor of Ethiopia (, &quot;King of Kings&quot;), also known as the Atse (, &quot;emperor&quot;), was the hereditary ruler of the Ethiopian Empire, from at least the 13th century until the abolition of the monarchy in 1975. The emperor was the head of state and head of government, with ultimate executive, judicial and legislative power in that country. A &quot;National Geographic&quot; article from 1965 called Imperial Ethiopia &quot;nominally a constitutional monarchy; in fact it was a benevolent autocracy&quot;.

==Title and style==
The title &quot;King of Kings&quot;, often rendered imprecisely in English as &quot;emperor&quot;, dates back to ancient Mesopotamia, but was used in Axum by King Sembrouthes (). However, Yuri Kobishchanov dates this usage to the period following the Persian victory over the Romans in 296–297. The most notable pre-Solomonic usage of the title &quot;Negusa Nagast&quot; was by Ezana of Axum; despite this, prior to the beginning of the Solomonic Dynasty, most Axumite and Zagwe rulers went by negus. Its use meant that both subordinate officials and tributary rulers, notably the gubernatorial vassals of Gojjam (who ranked 12th in the states non-dynastic protocol as per 1690), Welega, the seaward provinces and later Shewa, received the honorific title of &quot;nəgus&quot;, a word for &quot;king.&quot;

The consort of the emperor was referred to as the &quot;ətege&quot;. Empress Zewditu used the feminized form nəgəstä nägäst (&quot;Queen of Kings&quot;) to show that she reigned in her own right, and did not use the title of &quot;ətege&quot;.

==Succession==
On the death of a monarch any male or female descendant of the various dynastic lines could claim succession to the throne. Though in many cases the practice favoured primogeniture for at least one subsequent succession to the imperial throne, it often, as in the case of Emperor Yohannes IV of Tigray&#x27;s claim to the throne after the death of Emperor Tewodros II from Gondar, would leave the direct lineage of one royal family in favor of another.

The system developed two approaches to controlling the succession: the first involved the selection of emperors by a council of vassal regional royals and powerful clergy members from throughout the country who supported their claim to the Imperial throne; the combined military and religious strength would use their influence to contain and put down any competing claims. The second involved interning all of the emperor&#x27;s possible rivals in a secure location, which drastically limited their ability to disrupt the empire with revolts or to dispute the succession of an heir apparent. Ethiopian traditions do not all agree as to exactly when the custom started of imprisoning rivals to the throne on a &quot;Mountain of the Princes&quot;. One tradition credits this practice to the Zagwe king Yemrehana Krestos (fl. 11th century), who allegedly received the idea in a dream; Taddesse Tamrat discredits this tradition, arguing that the records of the Zagwe dynasty betray too many disputed successions for this to have been the case. Another tradition, recorded by historian Thomas Pakenham, states that this practice predates the Zagwe dynasty (which ruled from ), and was first practiced on Debre Damo, which was captured by the 10th-century queen Yodit or &quot;Gudit&quot;, who then isolated 200 princes there to death; however, Pakenham also notes that when questioned, the abbot of the monastery on Debre Damo knew of no such tale.
Taddesse Tamrat argues that this practice began in the reign of Wedem Arad (1299–1314), following the struggle for succession that he believes lies behind the series of brief reigns of the sons of Yagbe&#x27;u Seyon (reigned 1285–1294). A constructivist approach states that the tradition was used on occasion, weakened or lapsed sometimes, and was sometimes revived to full effect after some unfortunate disputes – and that the custom started in time immemorial as Ethiopian common inheritance patterns allowed all agnates to also succeed to the lands of the monarchy – which however is contrary to keeping the country undivided.

The potential royal rivals were incarcerated at Amba Geshen until the site was destroyed in 1540 during the Ethiopian-Adal war; then, from the reign of Fasilides (1632–1667) until the mid-18th century, at Wehni. Rumors of these royal mountain residences were part of the inspiration for Samuel Johnson&#x27;s short story, &quot;Rasselas&quot;.

Although the emperor of Ethiopia had theoretically unlimited power over his subjects, his councillors came to play an increasing role in governing Ethiopia, because many emperors were succeeded either by a child, or one of the incarcerated princes, who could only successfully leave their prisons with help from the outside. As a result, by the mid-18th century the power of the emperor had been largely transferred to his deputies, like Ras Mikael Sehul of Tigray ( – 1779), who held actual power in the empire and elevated or deposed emperors at will.

==Ideology==
The emperors of Ethiopia derived their right to rule based on two dynastic claims: their descent from the kings of Axum, and their descent from Menelik I, the legendary son of Solomon and Makeda, Queen of Sheba.

The claim to their relationship to the Kings of Axum derives from Yakuno Amlak&#x27;s claim that he was the descendant of Dil Na&#x27;od, through his father, although he defeated and killed the last Zagwe king in battle. His claim to the throne was also helped by his marriage to that king&#x27;s daughter, even though Ethiopians commonly do not acknowledge claims from the distaff side. The claim of descent from Menelik I is based on the assertion that the kings of Axum were also the descendants of Menelik I; its definitive and best-known formulation is set forth in the &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot;.

However, there is no historical evidence supporting the legends or Yekuno Amlak&#x27;s ancestry. There is no credible basis to the claims that the Aksumite royal house was descended from Solomon (or that any Aksumite king even claimed such an ancestry) or that Yekuno Amlak was descended from the Aksumite royal house. Solomon is dated to the 10th century BCE, hundreds of years before the founding of Aksum. Historian Harold G. Marcus describes the stories of the &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot; as a &quot;pastiche of legends&quot; created to legitimize Yekuno Amlak&#x27;s seizure of power. David Northrup notes that Although the story originated as a medieval political myth, it nevertheless became embedded in the Ethiopian sense of nationhood. This and the dynasty&#x27;s continued propagation of the myth was reflected in the 1955 Ethiopian constitution, which declared that the emperor &quot;descends without interruption from the dynasty of Menelik I, son of Queen of Ethiopia, the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon of Jerusalem&quot;.

==History==
The Solomonic dynasty, which claimed descent from the old Aksumite rulers, ruled Ethiopia from the 13th century until 1974.

===Modern era===
The Amhara warrior turned emperor, Kassa of Qwara, Gonder, in 1855 took complete control over Ethiopia and was crowned Emperor Tewodros II. Of the valley nobility, he claimed paternal descent from Emperor Fasilides, by way of one of the aforementioned emperor&#x27;s daughters. After Emperor Tewodros&#x27; reign, one of the many rebels leaders that helped the British in their expedition into Abyssinia was Dejazmatch Kassa, he was rewarded with articles of war for his services and went on to assume power through his claim of Solomonic descent from his mothers Gondarian ancestry and was crowned Emperor Yohannes IV. Sahle Maryam of Shewa, who descended from Solomonic emperors directly paternally through the Shewan Branch (junior only to the Gondar line), ascended the imperial throne following Emperor Yohannes IV&#x27;s death and thus, purporting to restore the male-line Solomonic tradition, for which he adopted the throne name of Menelik II.

The Emperor Tewodros spent his youth fighting with invading Ottoman Egyptians (termed &#x27;Turks&#x27; by the Ethiopians), then unifying the empire after the dark age of the &#x27;Zemene Mesafint&#x27; (Era of the Princes). Emperor Yohannes IV defeated an invading Egyptian army in modern day Eritrea and died while working to address the situation regarding the Mahdist presence in Ethiopia. Emperor Menelik II achieved a major military victory against Italian invaders in March 1896 at the Battle of Adwa and conquered the modern borders of Ethiopia.

===Italian occupation of Ethiopia===

Italy under Benito Mussolini attacked Ethiopia in 1935, starting the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Italian successes in the war caused the emperor Haile Selassie to be voted into exile by his nobles in 1936; he pled Ethiopia&#x27;s case against Italy before the League of Nations, but aid from the League was not forthcoming. Italy added Ethiopia to its already existing colonies of Eritrea and Italian Somalia, creating the new dependent state of Italian East Africa and was the first to associate Ethiopia as part of the Horn of Africa. On 9 May 1936, King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy proclaimed himself emperor of Ethiopia, replacing Haile Selassie.

Victor Emmanuel&#x27;s claim to emperorship was not entirely accepted, with the Soviet Union never considering the Italian conquest legitimate, and Haile Selassie continuing to contest the occupation from exile in the United Kingdom. With Italy&#x27;s entry on the side of the Axis Powers in World War II, the African part of the British Empire aided Haile Selassie and anti-Italian Ethiopian forces in the East African campaign. Italy was defeated and Selassie restored to the throne, with most combat in Ethiopia ending in 1941. The Armistice of Cassibile was signed in September 1943 with the Kingdom of Italy&#x27;s surrender, and Victor Emmanuel III officially renounced his title as emperor of Ethiopia in November 1943.

===Return of Haile Selassie, post-war period, and end of the monarchy===
In January 1942, Haile Selassie was officially reinstated to power in Ethiopia. The position of the emperor and the line of succession were strictly defined in both of the constitutions adopted during the reign of Selassie: the one adopted on July 16, 1931; and the revised one of November 1955.

Haile Selassie was the last Solomonic monarch to rule Ethiopia. He was deposed by the Derg, the committee of lower-ranking military and police officials on September 12, 1974. The Derg offered the throne to Selassie&#x27;s son Amha Selassie, who – understandably mistrustful of the Derg – refused to return to Ethiopia to rule. The Derg abolished the monarchy on 21 March 1975. In April 1989, Amha Selassie was proclaimed emperor in exile at London, with his succession backdated to the date of Haile Selassie&#x27;s death in August 1975 rather than his deposition in September 1974. In 1993 a group called the &quot;Crown Council of Ethiopia&quot;, which included several descendants of Haile Selassie, affirmed Amha as emperor and legal head of Ethiopia. However, the 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia confirmed the abolition of the monarchy.

<doc id="606633" wikidata="Q5002123" url="?curid=606633" title="Buster (comics)">
<text>Buster was a British comic which began publication in 1960, originally published by IPC Magazines Ltd under the company&#x27;s comics division Fleetway, then by Egmont UK Ltd under the same imprint until its closure in 2000. Despite missing issues due to industrial action during its run, the comic published 1,902 issues in total. The comic carried a mixture of humour and adventure strips, featuring the title character Buster and a host of other characters.

==Description==
The title character, whose strip usually appeared on the front cover, was Buster himself. He was originally billed as &quot;Buster: Son of Andy Capp&quot;; Andy Capp is the lead character of the eponymous &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper strip, and Buster wore a similar flat cap to reinforce the connection. In early issues, Buster often referred to his father, and Andy was seen in the comic (attempting to find a gas leak in three frames of the 18 June 1960 issue; shown in two drawn photographs in the 2 July issue that same year, the first of which was displayed by Buster&#x27;s mum with the pronouncement, &quot;It&#x27;s a photo of Buster taken with Andy! You can see he&#x27;s got his dad&#x27;s fine straight nose&quot;). Buster&#x27;s mum was often referred to by name, and was consistently drawn to resemble Andy&#x27;s wife Flo.

The connection with Andy Capp was gradually forgotten over time, and Andy no longer appeared in the strip by the mid-1960s. From 1965 the strip instead featured Buster in two long-running series: as lead character in the extremely durable &quot;Buster&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1960–68 and 1974–85) and in &quot;Buster&#x27;s Dream World&quot; (1968–74).

A Swedish edition of &quot;Buster&quot; began in 1967. At first, most of the material was taken from the UK edition; but as time went on the magazine produced more and more original material. Versions of &quot;Buster&quot; also appeared in Norway and Finland.

In its final years, the comic mostly consisted of reprints from either &quot;Buster&quot; itself or from the twelve comics which had merged with it over its 40-year run. The final strip was written by the last cartoonist for &quot;Buster&quot;, J. Edward Oliver. The last page of that final issue also revealed how every story in the comic ended, typically in a humorous reversal of the obvious, or expected, manner.

==Special==
In 2009, Egmont UK intended to publish four one-off specials, celebrating the comics &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;, &quot;Battle&quot;, &quot;Buster&quot; and &quot;Misty&quot;. To mark this event, the website BusterComic.co.uk held a poll in which users could vote for their favourite &quot;Buster&quot; strip. The results were released in May 2009, with &quot;X-Ray Specs&quot; topping the poll. This was passed onto Egmont, and the special was due for release on 16 September. &quot;Misty&quot; and &quot;Buster&quot; then had their release-dates swapped, and the &quot;Buster&quot; special was finally released on 9 December.

On 19 March 2012, the Royal Mail launched a special stamp collection to celebrate Britain&#x27;s rich comic book history. The collection featured &quot;The Beano&quot;, &quot;The Dandy&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;The Topper&quot;, &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;, &quot;Bunty&quot;, &quot;Buster&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot;, &quot;Twinkle&quot; and &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

In August 2016, Rebellion Developments purchased The IPC/Fleetway back-catalogue of British comics and characters, and in July 2017 published the &quot;Buster&quot; classic &quot;The Leopard from Lime Street&quot;, with other Buster strips &quot;Marney the Fox&quot; to follow in October, and &quot;Faceache&quot; in December, with other comics characters from the pages of &quot;Scream!&quot; also going to be published.

==Absorbed titles==
As occurred with other British comics such as &quot;The Dandy&quot;, many other comics merged with &quot;Buster&quot; over the years, in consequence of which &quot;Buster&quot; inherited some of their characters:

*&quot;Radio Fun&quot; (25 February 1961; which itself had merged with &quot;The Wonder&quot;)
*&quot;Film Fun&quot; (15 September 1962; which itself had merged with &quot;Picture Fun&quot;, &quot;Kinema Comic&quot;, &quot;Film Picture Stories&quot;, &quot;Illustrated Chips&quot;, and &quot;Top Spot&quot;)
*&quot;The Big One&quot; (27 February 1965)
*&quot;Giggle&quot; (20 January 1968) 
*&quot;Jet&quot; (2 October 1971) – short-lived comic that ran for 22 issues in 1971. It contained a mixture of both humorous and adventure stories. The comic introduced the character of Faceache, one of Buster&#x27;s most popular and long running characters.
*&quot;Cor!!&quot; (22 June 1974)
*&quot;Monster Fun&quot; (6 November 1976)
*&quot;Jackpot&quot; (30 January 1982)
*&quot;School Fun&quot; (2 June 1984)
*&quot;Nipper&quot; (1 September 1987)
*&quot;Oink!&quot; (22 October 1988)
*&quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot; (3 November 1990; which itself had previously absorbed &quot;Whoopee!&quot;, &quot;Krazy&quot;, &quot;Scouse Mouse&quot;, and &quot;Knockout&quot;; &quot;Whoopee!&quot; had previously absorbed &quot;Wow!&quot;, &quot;Cheeky&quot;, and &quot;Shiver and Shake&quot;)

==List of strips==
=== Closed story-lines ===
Here is a list of how the strips came to an end in the final issue:

*Benny Bones of &quot;Lazy Bones&quot; tells the doctor that he is suffering from insomnia.
*&quot;Joker&quot; reveals that his real name is Jeremy Beadle.
*&quot;Chalky&quot; is arrested for vandalism.
*&quot;Captain Crucial&quot; has a bad hair day.
*&quot;Odd Ball&quot; bursts because he hides inside a thorn bush.
*&quot;Sweet Tooth&quot; suffers from tooth decay because of all the sweets he&#x27;s eaten.
*&quot;Tom Thug&quot; is horrified to discover that he has passed his exams with flying colours, meaning he is no longer a &quot;brainless&quot; bully.
*Bernie Banks of &quot;Memory Banks&quot; dies because he forgets to keep breathing.
*&quot;Junior Rotter&quot; becomes the Prime Minister.
*&quot;Tony Broke&quot; is happy because his parents have won 90 squillion pounds on the National Lottery, making Tony and his family mega-rich. &quot;Ivor Lott&quot; has broken down in tears because his father has lost all of his money investing in the &quot;Buster&quot; comic, making Ivor and his family very poor. Thus, &quot;Ivor Lott and Tony Broke&quot; have swapped places, with Tony being rich and Ivor being poor.
*Melvyn of &quot;Melvyn&#x27;s Mirror&quot; breaks the mirror, resulting in seven years&#x27; bad luck, but in Mirrorland, it&#x27;s the opposite (seven years&#x27; good luck), but unfortunately, it also means that Melvyn will never see his family again and will be stuck in Mirrorland forever.
*Bobby of &quot;Bobby&#x27;s Ghoul&quot; has grown old, so his ghoul-friend (who never ages because she is a ghost) breaks up with him.
*&quot;Watford Gapp&quot; can&#x27;t think of a word rhyming with &quot;oblige&quot;, so he cannot finish his poem.
* &quot;Fuss Pot&quot; is too fussy to appear in the comic.
*Ray of &quot;X-Ray Specs&quot; has his specs taken back by I.Squint, the optician because he says that he only lent Ray the specs in 1975, and that he couldn&#x27;t keep them.
*Jon and Suzy of &quot;Double Trouble&quot; have started to like each other. Also &quot;Sweeny Toddler&quot; says that he is going to like everyone from now on.
*Buster takes off his cap to reveal a &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;-style haircut.
*The Millennium Bug affects &quot;Vid Kid&#x27;s&quot; remote, resulting in the entire universe being turned off.

<doc id="606634" wikidata="Q1228613" url="?curid=606634" title="Discworld MUD">
<text>Discworld MUD is a popular MUD, a text-based online role-playing game, set in the Discworld as depicted in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series of books by Terry Pratchett.

==History==
The MUD was founded in 1991 and opened to the public in 1992 (receiving continuous updates since then, now thirty years later). Originally containing a small section of the then rather loosely defined Ankh-Morpork, over time more locations have been added as the world has been further described in the book series, and laid out in the map supplements (such as The Streets of Ankh-Morpork and The Discworld Mapp). It now consists of areas that attempt to simulate several big cities (Ankh-Morpork, Bes Pelargic, Genua and Djelibeybi) on two continents, a larger number of smaller towns, and more than a million rooms which form the land between the cities and towns, with markers designating canon cities yet to be built.

The MUD was founded in Perth, Western Australia, by David &quot;Pinkfish&quot; Bennett, Craig &quot;Furball&quot; Richmond, Sean A. &quot;Lynscar&quot; Reith and Evan Scott. It was an outgrowth of another MUD called &quot;Discworld II&quot;. The MUD ran for a while on a machine in Melbourne before moving to run in the UK on a machine at Compulink where Gordon &quot;DrGoon&quot; was added to the administration team.

The MUD was later hosted for a time at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut by one of its undergraduates: Michael &quot;Bastian&quot; Hammill. &quot;Bastian&quot; served as chief administrator of the game and &quot;god&quot; of Discworld (a character role), while &quot;Pinkfish&quot; continued in his capacity as head game developer. The school&#x27;s IT administrator eventually ruled the project a hacking attempt due to multiple UNIX rlogin attempts from across the globe. This was actually just the game developers, or &quot;creators&quot;, working as part of an international programming effort. The mistake cost the MUD another one of its homes.

Also of note, at the time &quot;Bastian&quot; was issued a cease and desist order by Terry Pratchett&#x27;s attorney. The author&#x27;s legal adviser thought the game was a for-profit effort and therefore a violation of Pratchett&#x27;s copyright. &quot;Bastian&quot; assured both Pratchett and his attorney it was a fan-based effort and invited the author to visit &quot;Pinkfish&#x27;s&quot; creation. Pratchett was assuaged. The Discworld project was allowed to continue.

After a while the game was moved to Seattle, running on a machine at one of the admin&#x27;s workplace, Derek &quot;Ceres&quot; Harding, before again moving back to the UK to run at Jacqui &quot;Sojan&quot; Greenland&#x27;s house.

&quot;Discworld&quot; has publicly released the code base under which it runs on a couple of occasions, allowing other MUDs to use the same base for writing their worlds.

==Software==
The MUD&#x27;s software is divided into two sections — the mudlib and the driver. The MUD is based on a from-scratch mudlib and runs on FluffOS, a fork of the MudOS driver, placing it in the LPMud family. The driver is largely open-source, with new releases usually made available quickly, while cut-down versions of the mudlib including most of the underlying features are occasionally released (most recently in 2003), allowing the use of most of the basic object classes and tools of the MUD.

It is expected that players who wish to help with coding the game will apply to join the game&#x27;s development team, rather than working independently and submitting patches. Developers are not automatically taken from players at a certain skill level, instead being recruited into a hierarchy from the player base with an application and interview system. The underlying code is largely obscured from other players, with developers holding a policy of secrecy with actual game code and algorithms. Several useful algorithms such as that for determining experience costs have been either reverse-engineered or extracted from the released code by players, however, and can be generally found on various informational websites.

Before code is released live for general play, it is tested for bugs, typos, playability and ensuring the integrity of the theme by a group of beta tester players, aka Playtesters. Often new items, areas, quests, and new spells or abilities are generated from ideas from this group of players.

===Interface===

The &quot;Discworld&quot; command system is a customized text parser allowing for flexible interactions with objects and a way to specify how the command is structured. In addition to adjectives and properties attached to game objects, allows advanced semantic recognition to specify in-game objects (including &#x27;living&#x27; things):
Other interface features include a basic in-game text editor, for editing in-game mail and other chunks of text, context-sensitive help, and optional sections of topological map (known as &quot;lookmaps&quot;) to aid navigation.

One of the strongest development priorities in recent years has been on textual depth, providing rich descriptions and additional details, rather than on expanding the world or on providing higher-level content. Many interesting or useful details in descriptive text can be elaborated upon by applying more specific criteria to the &quot;look&quot; command.

== Player Interaction ==

===Chat===
For purely message-based interaction, the MUD provides a talker system with a number of fixed channels, including general chat channels, channels for development organisation, and channels reserved for members of many in-game organisations. In addition to these, clubs can be formed which gain their own channels and optional electoral system. Some examples include Taxi (providing magical transportation around the game world), OOC (for roleplayers to chat and organise events out of character), and Begorrah (for Irish players to chat and organise meeting up in real life). World Cabbage Day sees several meet-ups in real life over the past decade on several continents, notably in the UK, US and Australia.

===RP &amp; PvP===
Roleplaying is optional, and players can be observed playing in many different roles both in and out of character, from organisational, to social, to &#x27;numberchasing&#x27; (grinding, especially for skills). Player versus player interaction is on an opt-in basis, with characters over two days of play old being allowed to remove their protected status. There are some notable exceptions to this — for example, the player councils can hire in-game, NPC (non-player character) assassins to kill a player who hasn&#x27;t opted for PvP status.

=== Player councils ===
The game world includes several political regions. The cities of Ankh-Morpork and Djelibeybi are run by councils of elected player magistrates. These magistrates have the ability to develop player law, which they can also carry out. In areas with no player council, no written player laws apply, and only the game&#x27;s acceptable use policy, invariably referred to as &quot;the rules&quot;, applies.

Ankh-Morpork has seven magistrates, while the Djelibeybi council has five. Elections are held every six months. The council system is based on the game Nomic.

===Atmosphere===
Taking the humorous aspect of Pratchett&#x27;s work and running with it, the atmosphere on &quot;Discworld MUD&quot; is frequently whimsical, with a general fondness displayed for silliness and nonsense. Frogs and wombles are often referred to.

== Mechanics ==
The fundamental game mechanics of the MUD are based on a &#x27;stat/skill&#x27; division, with a player&#x27;s stats (statistics) relating to intrinsic properties, being semi-permanent, and skills (relating to aptitudes) increased by spending experience points to self-teach, or to learn from other player/non-player characters. Skill abilities are based on a diminishing returns system, in which a character&#x27;s &#x27;bonus&#x27;, or ability to perform a certain task, is calculated on a logarithmic basis from the character&#x27;s skill level and a geometric mean of related stats. Levels are uncapped, but also rise in experience point cost per level.

Experience points can be gained in a number of ways — in successful combat with NPCs, in the use of guild points (categorised action points), for exploration of areas, in the completion of quests, the accomplishment of in-game achievements, and simply by waiting — a very slow rate of &#x27;idle XP&#x27; is given to players merely for being online.

The skill system contains a number of quirks and odd features; for example, some skills are used in unexpected ways, such as the skill &quot;adventuring.movement.climbing.rock&quot;, which, while it is used for climbing rocks, is typically used to climb virtually any surface which isn&#x27;t a tree or rope, such as a metal drainpipe. Because of the wide range of uses that skills are put to, individual skills are not documented, so working out what skill you need to perform a given task can sometimes be challenging — for example, the skill &quot;adventuring.direction&quot;, typically used to avoid getting lost in extreme circumstances, is also the skill used in both reading and crafting maps.

Characters begin with seven lives, which can be replaced in-game. A player who dies with no lives can only be revived by a magical rite that consumes expensive components and requires the cooperation of eight high level wizards. Most PvP deaths do not reduce your life total, but otherwise have the same effects. Before 2012, a player that ran out of lives could not be revived at all.

The majority of the game world is not persistent, resetting areas and objects invisibly, but players&#x27; inventories, the contents of rentable houses, and safe deposit box-like vaults are saved.

=== Guilds ===

A large part of the original intent for &quot;Discworld MUD&quot; was to move away from a restrictive class system, and to allow a player to do (almost) anything with enough effort and advancement. Each character can join one of a selection of guilds, a combination of class and in-game organisation, and each guild has several unique abilities not shared with any other. Many mundane attributes such as hit points, perceptiveness, and swimming skill are not affected by choice of guild. While players can advance and benefit from any skill, players get extra bonuses and abilities within the skill set of their guild.

Broadly speaking, there are six classes: warrior, wizard, priest, witch, thief, and assassin. Over several years these broad classes have split into more specialized guilds with regional and cultural flavour, and somewhat more specialized skills.

As of April 1st, 2019, the Fools&#x27; Guild and associated fool class were added to the game. This was done to coincide with April Fools&#x27;, but has remained and grown as an actual guild.

==Canon and divergence==

Content has been worked upon continuously as the &quot;Discworld&quot; series of books has been growing, therefore there are smatterings of continuity taken from different books introduced in different regions. Additionally, some changes to the world have been made to allow a limited degree of player-control (such as player-elected administration for some of the in-world organisations) rather than using NPCs created from book characters.

The largest divergence from canon, however, is the addition of a range of divine magic not unlike that described in the &quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot; or &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; systems, mostly restricted to a small number of player-worshippable gods.

==Reception==
In April 1999, &quot;Discworld&quot; was selected as The Mud Connector&#x27;s Mud of the Month.

In Total PC Gaming, UK edition, &quot;Discworld&quot; was 2nd of the Top Three MUDs in the MMO Supplement in issue 7, and received a special mention in the MMO Supplement in issue 15, in the &quot;We Love&quot; section.

<text>The Air Corps () is the air force of Ireland. Organisationally a military branch of the Defence Forces of Ireland, the Air Corps utilises a fleet of fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft to carry out a variety of duties in conjunction with the Irish Army, Irish Naval Service and Garda Síochána. The headquarters of the Air Corps is located at the Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel, Dublin. The Air Corps has an active establishment of 886 personnel. Like other components of the Defence Forces, it has struggled to maintain strength and as of December 2023 has only 689 active personnel. Unlike the Army or the Naval Service, the Air Corps does not maintain a reserve component.

== History ==
=== National Army Air Service ===

The National Army Air Service was independent Ireland&#x27;s first air force. During the Anglo-Irish Treaty talks of 1921, a Martinsyde Type A Mark II biplane was purchased and put on 24-hour standby at Croydon Airport to allow Michael Collins to escape back to Ireland if the talks failed. The plane was not needed for this mission, and it became the first aircraft of the new National Army Air Service arriving in June 1922. The National Army Air Service was established in July 1922 and was gradually equipped with various aircraft types acquired from the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Aircraft Disposal Company. This company had been formed in 1919 to dispose of surplus aircraft and aero-engines from World War I for the British government. By the end of 1922, the National Army Air Service comprised ten aircraft, consisting of six Bristol F2B fighters from the First World War and four Martinsyde F4 Fighters, and about 400 men. Its successor, the Irish Army Air Corps was established in 1924 following a re-organisation of the National Army at the end of the Civil War.

=== The Air Corps ===
====Early years====

With the establishment of the Defence Forces in 1924, the Air Service became the new Army&#x27;s Air Corps and remained part of the Army until the 1990s.

In 1938 four Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters were delivered – a further eight were ordered but were embargoed by the outbreak of World War II. Other aircraft purchased from the United Kingdom before the outbreak of war included 16 Avro Anson Mark I maritime patrol bombers, 3 Supermarine Walrus amphibians, 6 Westland Lysander Mark II army co-operation aircraft and a number of trainers.


====World War II (The Emergency)====

During World War II (or The Emergency) there are no records of Air Corps planes engaging any belligerent aircraft, although dozens of escaped barrage balloons were shot down. Requests for more aircraft from Britain resulted in 13 obsolete Hawker Hector biplane light bombers being supplied during 1941. Twelve Hawker Hurricane Mk. Is were initially ordered for the Irish Army Air Corps in 1940 but were not delivered due to a wartime embargo imposed by the British government. Eleven Hurricane Mk. Is were eventually delivered to the Air Corps, from surplus RAF stocks, between July 1943 and March 1944, and the Hurricane Mk. I (no.93), that crash-landed in County Wexford in 1940, was the twelfth aircraft. These were supplemented by 6 Hawker Hurricane Mk. IIcs that were delivered to the Irish Army Air Corps in March 1945, to eventually replace the Hurricane Mk. Is of No. 1 Fighter Squadron. Supplied from surplus RAF stocks, the Hurricane Mk. IIcs were the last batch of aircraft to be delivered to the Air Corps before the end of World War II. The Hurricanes were the first monoplane fighter aircraft to enter service with the Air Corps and were also the first aircraft capable of reaching 300 m.p.h. in level flight. The Hurricane gave the Air Corps a proven modern fighter, and – at peak – 20 flew in Irish colours.
163 belligerent aircraft force-landed in Ireland during the war, and in this way, the Air Corps acquired a Lockheed Hudson, a Fairey Battle, and three Hawker Hurricanes.

====The Cold War====
After the Emergency, the Hurricanes were replaced by Supermarine Seafires and a few two-seat Spitfire trainers.&lt;br&gt;
The jet age arrived on 30 July 1956 when the Corps took delivery of three de Havilland Vampire T.55 trainers, followed by three more in 1960 who served as advanced trainers and fighters.&lt;br&gt;
The Vampires were replaced by six Fouga CM.170 Magister jet trainers that were purchased secondhand from the French Air Force and delivered from 1975 to 1976. The Magisters were used for jet training, by the Light Strike Squadron and for aerobatics by the Silver Swallows display team that was formed in 1986. The Magisters were occasionally used to escort VIP aircraft. The Magister could be equipped with two 7.62mm machine guns in the nose and fourteeen 68mm rockets on its underwing hardpoints.

De Havilland Chipmunk T.20s were introduced in the 1950s and used as basic flight trainers until 1976. Hunting Percival Provost T.51 and T.53s were also introduced in the 1950s as advanced flight trainers, serving until 1976.&lt;br&gt;
During the mid-sixties and early seventies, the Corps played a part in expanding Ireland&#x27;s film industry. Pilots and engineering staff participated in a 1965 box office success, &quot;The Blue Max&quot;. The fleet of World War I replicas, owned by ex-RCAF fighter pilot Lynn Garrison&#x27;s &quot;Blue Max Aviation&quot;, was based at Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel – before being moved to Weston Aerodrome at Leixlip. Here the Corps continued its involvement, providing aircrew and engineering staff to support films such as &quot;Darling Lili&quot;, &quot;Von Richthofen and Brown&quot;, &quot;Zeppelin&quot; and a number of television commercials. Lynn Garrison was also responsible for coordinating the first demonstration of the Marchetti SF-260 Warrior at Baldonnel.&lt;br&gt;
As a result of this presentation, in 1977 the Corps acquired ten SIAI-Marchetti SF.260W Warriors for basic and advanced training and light ground attack. Four were lost in accidents, and one attrition replacement was acquired in 1979.

Three Avro Anson C.19s were delivered in 1946 for radio and navigation training, air-to-ground photography, and transport, and were replaced by four de Havilland Doves which arrived in 1953, 1959, 1962, and 1970, which were also used for calibration of radar and landing aids at Dublin and Shannon airports.

The troubles in Northern Ireland required additional reconnaissance resources, and in 1972 eight Reims-Cessna FR.172H joined the Air Corps to provide patrolling, aerial surveillance, and aerial communications. One Reims-Cessna FR.172K was delivered in 1981 as an attrition replacement. The Cessnas served with No 2 Support Wing, operating from Gormanstown until the airfield&#x27;s closure in 2002.

Ireland&#x27;s accession to the European Economic Community in 1973 which necessitated frequent travel to European capitals for government ministers led to the creation of the Ministerial Air Transport Service (MATS) and the acquisition of the Corps&#x27; first business jet, a BAe 125-700 (#238), which served until 1992. This was joined in 1980 by a Beechcraft Super King Air 200 (#240), which also provided multi-engine training.

Ireland&#x27;s accession to the EEC also necessitated sustained maritime patrolling of 342,000 km2 (132,000 square miles) of ocean. Two Beechcraft Super King Air 200s (#232 and #234) were delivered in 1977-8 to perform this duty.

The bad winter of 1962/3 incentivised the acquisition of helicopers and in November 1963, the Air Corps took delivery of its first three helicopters, SA.316B Alouette IIIs, followed by five more in 1972-3. The Alouettes performed search and rescue, troop transport and air ambulance duties. Two Aérospatiale SA342L Gazelle entered service in 1979 to provide helicopter training.&lt;br&gt;
The single engine of the Alouette limited its search and rescue range over water, and in 1986 five twin-engined Aérospatiale SA365Fi Dauphin II were acquired for the SAR role. Two of these were modified for operation from the Naval Service Helicopter Patrol vessel LÉ Eithne, and equipped with crashproof fuel tanks and harpoon deck arrester gear.

In 2024, the state settled a case with a former Air Corps technician, who had worked in the avionics section in the 1990s, and who was &quot;allegedly exposed to toxic chemicals which he says caused severe health difficulties&quot;.

====Into the 21st century====
In November 1998, the Air Corps had two Fouga Magisters in service. Two of the six Magisters were to be retired in 1997 and a further two in 1998. In early 1999, the Magisters were withdrawn from service. Leaving the Air Corps without any jet combat aircraft. In 1998, a review of the Air Corps conducted by Price Waterhouse for the Irish government recommended replacing the Fougas and Marchettis by eight light strike/trainer aircraft.

In 2004, eight Pilatus PC-9M trainers were delivered to the Air Corps to replace the Marchettis and Magisters. The PC-9M is the first Air Corps aircraft to have ejection seats since the Vampire. The PC-9M has six underwing hardpoints, and is normally equipped with two FN HMP250 gun pods, each carrying one M3P machine gun, and two FN LAU-7 rocket pods, each carrying seven 70mm Folding-Fin Aerial Rockets, in the close air support role.&lt;br&gt;
One of the retired Marchettis was kept for the Air Corps Museum, while the remaining six were sold to a private reseller in the United States.&lt;br&gt;
On 12 October 2009, Air Corps instructor Captain Derek Furniss, and Cadet David Jevens were tragically killed when their PC-9M (#265) crashed during a training exercise in Connemara, County Galway.&lt;br&gt;
In 2017, an attrition replacement (#269) was delivered.

To support Ireland&#x27;s assumption of the EU Presidency in 1990, the Corps leased a Grumman Gulfstream III (#249) – which in 1990 became the first Irish military aircraft to circumnavigate the world. The success of Gulfstream III as an ambassador for Ireland led to its replacement in 1992 by a Grumman Gulfstream IV (#251) which also replaced the HS.125.&lt;br&gt;
Ireland again assumed the EU Presidency in 1994, and the Air Corps acquired a Learjet 45XR (#258) to supplement the government&#x27;s ministerial travel requirements.

The Ministerial Air Transport Service has since declined in use and size as government ministers are reluctant to travel in perceived luxury when adequate commercial air travel is available, and after repeated criticisms of government ministers using Air Corps aircraft for domestic travel. The repeated technical problems to the MATS aircraft has led to their gradual withdrawal from service, with the Beechcraft the first to be retired in 2009.&lt;br&gt;
The Gulfstream IV followed in 2014 after corrosion was detected in the undercarriage which required substantial costs to repair. The Learjet has continued in service, albeit with increasing unreliability, and (as of 2023) was due to be replaced by 2024.

The two maritime patrol Beechcraft were unsuitable for flying in long periods in a salty atmosphere and were replaced by two CASA CN235-100MP Persuader which arrived in 1994. These were upgraded in 2006/2007 by EADS CASA to the FITS Persuader standard with enhanced radar, forward looking infrared equipment and a new electronic and avionics suite.

In the 1990s the Air Corps gained a new role with the formation of the Garda Air Support Unit (GASU) in 1997. The unit was initially equipped with one Britten-Norman Defender 4000 (#254), and one Eurocopter AS.355N Ecureil (#255). Operational control of the aircraft remains with the Department of Justice, Equality, and Law Reform, while the Air Corps provide pilots and technicians to fly and maintain the aircraft. The AS.355N was supplemented by a Eurocopter EC135 T2 (#256) in 2003, and replaced by a second EC135 T2 (#272) which arrived in January 2008.

During the 1990s and 2000s, the Air Corps gradually lost its search and rescue (SAR) role. In 1990, an inquiry chaired by retired Garda Commissioner Eamonn Doherty into Ireland&#x27;s air sea rescue recommended transferring this service from the Air Corps to a new emergency service, and the stationing of rescue helicopters at regional airports instead of a centralised service. The government accepted the recommendations and established the Irish Marine Emergency Service (IMES), now the Irish Coast Guard in 1991. Irish Helicopters operated the first privatised SAR helicopter, a Sikorsky S-61N, from Shannon in 1991. This service was later taken over by Bond Helicopters (now CHC Helicopter) in 1997 who also won the Dublin contract in 1999.&lt;br&gt;
On 2 July 1999, Captains Dave O&#x27;Flaherty and Mick Baker, Sergeant Pat Mooney and Corporal Niall Byrne were tragically killed when their Dauphin (#248) crashed into sand dunes at Tramore Beach, County Waterford. The crash only emphasised the limits of the Air Corps SAR helicopters, as the Alouette was only available during daylight hours and the Dauphin was small and had a short range. Both needed replacement by medium sized helicopters.&lt;br&gt; 
In 2002, CHC took over the Waterford SAR contract, leaving the Air Corps with only the north-east contract. While a S-61 was leased to train crews, pending a tender to purchase up to five medium helicopters, two of which would be SAR helicopters, the contract was cancelled and CHC took over the north-east contract based in Sligo, leaving the Air Corps without a SAR role.

Despite the cancellation of the order for five S-92s and the loss of the SAR role, the aging Alouettes, Gazelles and Dauphins still needed replacement. In 2004 the government ordered two Eurocopter EC135P2 light helicopters for training, air ambulance, and general utility, and four AgustaWestland AW139 medium helicopters for troop transport, air ambulance, and VIP transport. The Gazelles were retired in 2005 and replaced in November by two EC135 P2.&lt;br&gt;
The Dauphins were retired in 2006, followed by the Alouettes in 2007. During their operational lifetime, 3,300 people were assisted by the Alouette helicopters in their Search and Rescue and air ambulance roles. The four AW139 arrived during 2006/7, and the option for an additional two was exercised and arrived in 2008. Since 2012, one of the AW139 has operated an air ambulance service from Custume Barracks, Athlone for the Emergency Aeromedical Service.

On 4 October 2019, after 47 years of service to the state, the five remaining Reims/Cessna FR172H Rocket aircraft were retired from service after amassing 63,578 flight hours total. The Cessnas were replaced with several Pilatus PC-12NG aircraft during 2020. The first PC-12NG utility transport variant was delivered in April 2020, followed by three PC-12NG &#x27;Spectre&#x27; aerial surveillance variants in September 2020.

During the 2011 Libyan civil war, the Air Corps was tasked with evacuating approximately forty Irish citizens from the troubled country. The operation involved two Air Corps aircraft (the Learjet and one CN-235), and nine personnel, using Malta as a temporary base.

There was much criticism of Ireland&#x27;s inability to rescue its own citizens in the 2021 Kabul and 2023 Sudan evacuations due to Ireland&#x27;s lack of a long-range, heavy-lift aircraft. In August 2021, Ireland has to ask France and Finland to rescue 36 Irish citizens from Kabul.&lt;br&gt;
In April 2023, over 90 Irish citizens were evacuated from Sudan by aircraft from France, Spain and the UK.

====2022 Commission on the Defence Forces====

In February 2022, the Commission on the Defence Forces published a report. For the Air Corps, the report recommended that the service be renamed to the Irish Air Force and advocated for the establishment of a Chief of the Air Force. The Air Corps would change from being &quot;an effective sub branch of the army&quot; to having a &quot;stand-alone command and decision-making structure&quot;. The report also recommended three levels of ambition (LOAs) with each level having different recommendations. LOA 1 proposes to maintain the current size of the Air Corps, while bringing active personnel numbers back up to the current establishment.

LOA 2 recommends the development of additional capabilities, including:

* 2 additional medium helicopters – 8 Medium Helicopters to eventually be replaced with 8 super-medium helicopters
* Primary radar – establish a Recognised Air Picture (RAP)
* Strategic reach aircraft – transport and airlift for overseas deployments
* Counter UAV – Anti-drone/UAV capability
* Air Corps Reserve – recruitment of specialist roles (technicians, trained pilots, air traffic controllers)

LOA 3 recommends a further development of Air Corps combat capabilities, including:

* Jet combat aircraft – Air combat/intercept capability
* Troop carrier aircraft – Overseas deployment of personnel
* Armed CSAR helicopters – Organic intra-theatre deployments

Under LOA 3, the new Air Force would also be capable of deploying combat pilots, aircraft and support personnel overseas. LOA 2 recommends a budget of €1.5 billion with LOA 3 recommending a budget of €2.967 billion. The commission compared Ireland to other nations of similar GDP and population size, and determined these budgetary increases would be commensurate with those nations.

As of 2023, the then Irish government had committed to implementing LOA 2 by 2028.

=== Aircraft orders ===
In December 2022, an order was placed for an additional Airbus C295, to be used for cargo and personnel transport, including overseas operations, special operations forces support and medical evacuations. This planned purchase aligns with a recommendation for fixed wing strategic-reach capability as indicated under LOA 2 of the Commission on the Defence Forces report. As of June 2023, it was expected to be delivered in 2025.

In January 2023, the Irish government announced funding of €21.5 million for a replacement helicopter and fixed wing plane for the Garda Air Support Unit (GASU). In July 2024, a DHC-6 Twin Otter was ordered as a replacement for the Britten-Norman Defender. In December 2024, the government announced the purchase of four Airbus H145M light utility helicopters for €91.7 million to replace the EC135s used for pilot training and the GASU. The helicopters are scheduled to begin arriving in 2027.

In February 2023, the government agreed to replace the Learjet 45, which has been in service since 2004, has becoming increasingly unreliable and unable to fly long distances. The replacement jet is expected to seat ten passengers and be capable of long distance travel to assist in overseas evacuation of Irish citizens, medical transport as well as ministerial air transport. The tender was listed in November 2023. In December 2024, the government announced that it had ordered a Dassault Falcon 6X, known as the Strategic Reach Aircraft, which is due be delivered in December 2025 and available ahead of Ireland&#x27;s EU Presidency in the second half of 2026.

The Irish Air Corps lacks primary radar to detect aircraft in Irish controlled airspace who have switched off their transponders, like hijacked aircraft and incursions by Russian military aircraft. The 2015 White Paper on Defence stated that, if additional funding became available, the acquisition of a radar surveillance capability for the Air Corps would be a priority. The White Paper on Defence Update 2019 reported that no additional funding had been provided. In February 2022, the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces (CoDF) recommended acquiring primary radar under Level of Ambition (LOA) 2. In September 2022, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported that it would cost over €100 million to procure primary radar. In November 2023, the Detailed Implementation Plan for the Report of the Commission of the Defence Forces (DIP-CoDF) stated that the recommendation to develop a primary radar was planned to be completed by 2028.

The 2022 CoDF recommended under LOA 2 that eight super‐medium helicopters should be acquired when the existing fleet of medium-lift helicopters is due to be replaced. The 2023 DIP-CoDF stated that the acquisition could be completed by 2028.

Since the retirement of the Magister in 1999, Ireland has lacked an air intercept capability. However, since 1952 Ireland has had a secret agreement with the UK to allow the Royal Air Force to respond to incursions into Irish airspace. The 2015 White Paper on Defence stated the White Paper update would consider a more capable air combat/intercept capability than the PC-9s. The 2019 Update to the White Paper on Defence reported that the project had not commenced. The 2022 CoDF recommended acquiring a squadron of jet combat aircraft under LOA 3. This would increase Ireland&#x27;s air defence capabilities to a level comparable to similar sized countries in Europe. The 2023 DIP-CoDF stated that the recommendation would be considered by government in 2028.

The Pilatus PC-9s are due to reach their 20-year service life in 2025, however as of 2023 no tender for a replacement aircraft had been announced. 

== Roles ==
The roles and functions of the Air Corps are more akin to an army air corps rather than a conventional air force. The Air Corps has no air intercept capability, and very limited low-level ground attack capacity. The Air Corps can provide a day/night tactical helicopter troop transport, but without armed helicopter escort support.
The Air Corps non-military capabilities in aid to the civil power and other Government departments include ministerial transport, maritime patrol, police support, search and rescue support, air ambulance, aerial firefighting, and aerial surveillance, observation and photography.

=== Air ambulance ===
The Air Corps provides an air ambulance service for emergency rapid transfer of patients between hospitals, to hospitals from offshore islands, transferring patients for treatment overseas, and transporting emergency organ retrieval teams. The aircraft used are the AW139, EC135, C-295 and Learjet.

An Air Corps AW139 also provides an Emergency Aeromedical Service for the National Ambulance Service based out of Custume Barracks in Athlone, providing an emergency patient airlift service from scenes of accidents to hospitals.

=== Maritime patrol ===
The Air Corps operates two CASA C-295 long-range maritime patrol aircraft in support of fishery protection, marine surveillance, and search and rescue.

=== Ministerial Air Transport Service ===
The Air Corps provides a Ministerial Air Transport Service (MATS) for the President and members of the Government in official engagements abroad. The Learjet 45 is used specifically for this purpose, with the AW139, EC135 and CASA occasionally used.

=== Garda Air Support ===
The Garda Air Support Unit (GASU) provides specialist air support for the Garda Síochána, Ireland&#x27;s national police force. The Air Corps provides three aircraft, two Eurocopter EC135 T2 helicopters and a Britten-Norman Defender, as well as pilots and aircraft technicians to the GASU, while the Department of Justice retains operational control of the aircraft.

== Ranks ==

The Air Corps&#x27; ranks are similar to those of the Irish Army. As of April 2023, the strength was 711 all ranks.

<text>Melvin Thomas Ott (March 2, 1909 – November 21, 1958), nicknamed &quot;Master Melvin&quot;, was an American professional baseball right fielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Giants, from through .

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Though unusually slight in stature for a power hitter, at , , Ott led the National League in home runs a then-record six times. He was an All-Star for 11 consecutive seasons, and was the first National League player to surpass 500 career home runs.

Ott was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951.

==Early life==
Ott was born in Gretna, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans. He was a second cousin of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Baton Rouge, Stanley Joseph Ott. Despite his average height, he quickly established himself as a gifted athlete, especially in baseball. During high school, he played on a semi-pro team three or four days a week. He already showed considerable power at a young age and was getting paid for it. His team had a tradition of passing the hat whenever a player hit a home run that figured in a victory, meaning Ott was taking home money for playing baseball as early as 14.

==Playing career==
Despite his power, Ott&#x27;s hometown minor league team, the New Orleans Pelicans, refused to sign him because of concerns about his size. He then found a job at a lumber company in Patterson, near Morgan City, where he became a sensation on the company baseball team. Company owner Henry Williams was particularly impressed with Ott. While visiting New York, he suggested that Giants manager John McGraw give him a tryout. Ott was skeptical at first, so Williams bought Ott a train ticket to New York.

Ott arrived in New York in early September. He quickly impressed observers with his hitting, especially McGraw, who predicted that he would be &quot;one of the greatest lefthand hitters the National League has ever seen.&quot; He formally signed Ott to a contract in January 1926.

===Regular season===
Ott had originally been a catcher, but McGraw concluded that Ott was too small to be a major league catcher and converted him into an outfielder. After two years as a part-time player, he became the regular right fielder in 1929 at the age of 20. He didn&#x27;t disappoint, hitting .328 in 150 games while setting career highs in home runs (42) and RBI (151)—both records for players who were 20 years old or younger at the start of the season. Ott&#x27;s 1929 batting average of .328 is his second highest season average for a full-time player trailing only his 1930 campaign with a .349 average. By the time Ott reached the age of 25, he had accumulated 1,249 hits, the second highest total for a 25-year-old in MLB history, behind only Ty Cobb (1,433).

Ott was a six-time NL home run leader, in 1932, 1934, 1936–1938, and 1942. From 1928 through 1945, he led the New York Giants in home runs. This 18-season consecutive dominance is a record; no other player has ever led his team in more consecutive years in a single Triple Crown category. He was both the youngest player to hit 100 home runs and the first National Leaguer to hit 500 home runs. He passed Rogers Hornsby to become the all-time NL home run leader in and held that title until Willie Mays passed him in .
Ott was noted for reaching base via the base on balls (BB), or walk. He drew five walks in a game three times. He set the National League record for most walks in a doubleheader, with six, on October 5, 1929, and did it again on April 30, 1944. He tied an MLB record by drawing a walk in seven consecutive plate appearances (June 16–18, 1943). He also led the NL in walks six times: in 1929, 1931–1933, 1937, and 1942.

He twice scored six runs in a game, on August 4, 1934, and on April 30, 1944. He is the youngest major leaguer to ever hit for the cycle. Ott was the first NL player to post eight consecutive 100-RBI seasons, and only Willie Mays, Sammy Sosa, Chipper Jones, and Albert Pujols have since joined him.

He used a batting style that was then considered unorthodox, lifting his forward (right) foot prior to impact. When McGraw first saw Ott&#x27;s style, he called it &quot;the most natural swing I&#x27;ve seen in years. Alvin Dark said that Ott &quot;lifted his lead foot right off the ground like he was getting ready to kick at a dog&quot;. This style helped him hit for power. More recent players who used a similar style include Harold Baines and Kirby Puckett, as well as the Japanese home run king, Sadaharu Oh.

In 1943, all of his 18 home runs came at home; only two other players ever had a greater number of all-homefield home runs. Of Ott&#x27;s 511 career home runs, 323 of them, or 63%, came at home. Because of this, his home run record historically has been downplayed, suggesting that a foul line at the Polo Grounds resulted in higher numbers at home. Sportswriters often jokingly referred to him as the master of the &quot;Chinese home run&quot; as such short homers were called at the time; Ott would often respond by noting that if it was so easy to inflate his homer totals by hitting over that fence, all other hitters in the league would be doing it.

As a balance, the Polo Grounds had the deepest power alleys in baseball. Also, Ott hit more career home runs in foreign stadiums than any other National League hitter at the time of his retirement. In some of his better seasons, he hit more homers on the road than in the Polo Grounds.

There may be reason to believe that he was a better hitter than his record suggests because of differences in National League and American League ball specifications. Those differences are considered the greatest in the history of the game and made it considerably harder for National League hitters to achieve home runs.

Ott was also a skilled fielder. He was a master at playing balls that bounced off the fences at the Polo Grounds, allowing him to garner 26 assists in 1929, his first full season as a full-time player. He would never even approach that figure again, as baserunners quickly realized it was far too risky to run on balls hit in Ott&#x27;s direction.

During the prime of Ott&#x27;s career, 11 seasons from 1931 to 1941, American League batters averaged 21% more home runs—peaking at 41% more home runs—than their National League counterparts. Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx, contemporaries, and both American League players, were the only batters to surpass Ott&#x27;s record during this time.

===Post-season===
Ott played in the World Series in 1933, 1936, and 1937, winning in 1933. He hit two home runs during the 1933 World Series. In Game 1, he had four hits, including a two-run home run in the first inning. In Game 5, he drove in the series-winning run with two outs in the top of the 10th, driving a pitch into the center-field bleachers. In the 1936 World Series, Ott had seven hits and one home run. In 1937, he had four hits and one home run. Playing in 16 World Series games, Ott batted .295 (18-for-61) with eight runs, four home runs and 10 RBI.

===Career statistics===
In his 22-season career, Ott batted .304 with 511 home runs, 1,860 RBI, 1,859 runs, 2,876 hits, 488 doubles, 72 triples, 89 stolen bases, 1,708 BB, .414 on-base percentage and a .533 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .974 fielding percentage. He hit better than .300 10 times in his major league career. At the time of his retirement, he had hit 200 more home runs than the next-highest National Leaguer.

==Managerial career==
After longtime teammate Bill Terry retired as manager in 1941, he named Ott as player-manager. Ott continued as a regular player for another five years, and remained productive at the plate for much of that time. In 1942, he led the league in home runs (30), runs scored (118), and walks (109). He finished second in home runs (26) and third in slugging percentage (.544) in 1944. In 1945, he hit .308 and finished tied for fourth in home runs (21).

On the second day of the 1946 season, a day after hitting what would be his final career home run, he injured his knee while diving for a fly ball. The injury effectively ended his career; he only appeared in 29 more games for the rest of 1946, and retired after making only four cameo appearances in 1947. He stayed on as manager until Leo Durocher replaced him midway through the 1948 season.

The Giants&#x27; best finish during Ott&#x27;s tenure was third place in 1942, one of only three times he finished with a winning record. However, his 1943 and 1944 teams were decimated by World War II, which saw a number of established players drafted into the military.

It was in reference to Ott&#x27;s supposedly easy-going managing style that then-Dodgers manager Durocher made the oft-quoted and somewhat out-of-context comment, &quot;Nice guys finish last!&quot; Ott was the first manager to be ejected from both games of a doubleheader, when the Giants lost both games to the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 9, 1946.

Ott spent the remaining two-and-a-half years of his contract helping his former teammate Carl Hubbell run the Giants&#x27; farm system. In 1951, Ott succeeded Chuck Dressen as manager of the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, leading the club to an 80–88 record and seventh-place finish. In 1952, the Oaks finished 104–76 under Ott, good for second place in the PCL.

==MLB honors==

Ott was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951 with 87.2% of the vote. His number &quot;4&quot; was also retired by the Giants in , and it is posted on the facade of the upper deck in the left field corner of Oracle Park.

He was a National League All-Star for 12 consecutive seasons, from 1934 through 1945 (All-Star selections only began in 1933; Ott had at least three All-Star caliber seasons prior to that, as well as in 1945, when MLB cancelled the 1945 contest and selections).

He is one of only six National League players to spend a 20+ year career with one team (Cap Anson, Stan Musial, Willie Stargell, Tony Gwynn, and Craig Biggio being the others).

In 1999, Ott was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. That same year, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; placed Ott at number 42 on its list of &quot;Baseball&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players&quot;. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Ott at number 32 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

==Broadcasting career==

Ott spent the 1953 and 1954 seasons out of baseball for the first time since coming to New York in 1925. In 1955, he joined the Mutual radio network to recreate baseball games. From 1956 to 1958, Ott teamed with Van Patrick to broadcast the games of the Detroit Tigers on radio and television.

==Death==
Ott was injured in an auto accident in Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi, in November 1958. He was transferred to a hospital in New Orleans, where he died a week later at the age of 49. He was interred in Metairie Cemetery. Ott died in a similar manner to two other New York Giants Hall of Famers: Frankie Frisch in 1973 and Carl Hubbell in 1988, both of whom had been teammates with Ott (Frisch in Ott&#x27;s rookie season in 1926 and Hubbell for his entire career from 1928 to 1943).

==Legacy==
Ott is remembered in his hometown of Gretna, where a park is named in his honor. Since 1959, the National League has honored the league&#x27;s annual home run champion with the Mel Ott Award. In the 1989 film &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, Ott was one of several deceased players portrayed in farmer Ray Kinsella&#x27;s Iowa cornfield. In 2006, Ott was featured on a United States postage stamp, as one of a block of four honoring &quot;Baseball Sluggers&quot; — the others being Mickey Mantle, Hank Greenberg, and Roy Campanella. In announcing the stamps, the U.S. Postal Service stated, &quot;Remembered as powerful hitters who wowed fans with awesome and often record-breaking home runs, these four men were also versatile players who helped to lead their teams to victory and set impressive standards for subsequent generations.&quot; Ott is also remembered in the name of the Little League of Amherst, New York. The Mel Ott Little League began in 1959, named for Ott soon after his death.

Ott&#x27;s name frequently appears in crossword puzzles, on account of its letter combination and brevity.

Ott is mentioned in the poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash, first published in &quot;Sport&quot; magazine in January 1949:
Ott is mentioned in Frank D. Gilroy&#x27;s 1964 Pulitzer Prize-winning play “The Subject was Roses” near the beginning of Act 1, Scene 2, when John and Timmy have just returned home from a 1946 Giants vs. Cubs game.

JOHN: What&#x27;ll we drink to?

TIMMY: The Chicago Cubs.

JOHN: Think it&#x27;ll help them?

TIMMY: Can it hurt?

JOHN: To the Cubs.

TIMMY: To the Cubs.

JOHN: Sixteen to three.

TIMMY: I&#x27;m still glad we went.

JOHN: So am I. That was a beautiful catch Ott made.

TIMMY: Yes.

JOHN: For a moment I thought he lost it in the sun.

<text>The gray ratsnake or gray rat snake (Pantherophis alleghaniensis), also commonly known as the black ratsnake, central ratsnake, chicken snake, midland ratsnake, or pilot black snake, is a species of nonvenomous snake in the genus &quot;Pantherophis&quot; in the subfamily Colubrinae. The gray ratsnake is one of about ten species within the American ratsnake genus &quot;Pantherophis&quot;.

==Description==
A medium to large serpent, the gray ratsnake typically reaches an adult size of total length (including tail); however, the record is . Unlike other &quot;Pantherophis&quot;, whose conspicuous juvenile pattern fades into adulthood, the gray ratsnake in the southern part of its range does not undergo drastic ontogenetic changes in color or markings. Instead, it retains the juvenile pattern of dark elongate dorsal blotches separated by four, or more, pale gray body scales, a light gray crown with dark striping that forms an anteriorly facing spearpoint, and a solid band which covers the eyes and extends rearward to the posterior upper labial scales. However, in the northern part of its range it is black in adulthood, like &quot;P. quadrivittatus&quot; and &quot;P. obsoletus&quot;. The venter is usually off-white or pale gray with darker irregular blotches, and a double row of black spots behind the divided anal plate of the vent. The dorsal scale rows around midbody are usually weakly keeled. Because the gray ratsnake shares its range with other members of its genus, hybrids of midlands x eastern ratsnakes are not uncommon.

==Distribution and habitat==
Native to North America, &quot;Pantherophis alleghaniensis&quot; is commonly found in the forests of the eastern and central United States. It occurs relatively continuously throughout the major part of the eastern half of the United States, along the western edge of the Appalachian Mountains, from southwestern New England to the Gulf of Mexico, westward to the Mississippi River, and northward from northern Louisiana to southwestern Wisconsin.

In Canada, this species is known to occur in two disjunct regions of southern Ontario: the Carolinian forest region along the north shore of Lake Erie in the southwest, and the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence region in the southeast.

===Habitat===
An agile climber, the gray ratsnake is at home from the ground to the tree tops in many types of hardwood forest and cypress stands, along tree-lined streams and fields, and even around barns and sheds in close proximity to people. Within its range, almost any environment rich in rodents, and vertical escape options, proves a suitable habitat for the gray ratsnake.

==Diet and behavior==
===Diet===
A scent-hunter and a powerful constrictor, &quot;P. alleghaniensis&quot; feeds primarily on small mammals, birds, and bird eggs. Neonates and juveniles prefer a diet of frogs and lizards.

===Behavior===
When startled, the gray ratsnake, like other ratsnakes, stops and remains motionless with its body held in a series of wave-like kinks. The snake will also rattle its tail against whatever it is lying on, making an audible buzzing sound; this is intended to fool a potential threat into thinking that they&#x27;ve encountered a rattlesnake. The gray ratsnake will defend itself by raising its head and bluffing a strike. If handled, it will musk a victim by releasing the foul-smelling contents of its cloaca, and will bite if necessary. However, the gray ratsnake is less likely to bite than other members of its genus, and wounds from a bite rarely require more than a small bandage.

===Reproduction===
Breeding in &quot;P. alleghaniensis&quot; takes place from April to July. Females reach sexual maturity at 7–9 years of age. They deposit 5 to 27 eggs around mid-summer, and the hatchlings usually emerge in September.

==Conservation status==
The gray ratsnake is considered common across much of its range, but is listed as &quot;of special concern&quot; in Michigan and is also listed as rare in Wisconsin. The gray ratsnake is listed federally in Canada as &quot;endangered&quot; (Carolinean population) and &quot;threatened&quot; (Great Lakes – St. Lawrence population). In the state of Georgia, all indigenous, nonvenomous snakes are illegal to kill or capture, and are considered to be in the custody of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.

Habitat destruction and road mortality are leading causes of decline.

<doc id="606659" wikidata="Q770843" url="?curid=606659" title="Glucagonoma">
<text>Glucagonoma is a very rare tumor of the alpha cells of the pancreas that results in the overproduction of the hormone glucagon. Typically associated with a rash called necrolytic migratory erythema, weight loss, and mild diabetes mellitus, most people with glucagonoma contract it spontaneously. However, about 10% of cases are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) syndrome.

== Causes ==
Although the cause of glucagonoma is unknown, some genetic factors may lead to the condition. A family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a risk factor. Additionally, those with Mahvash disease have an increased risk for glucagonoma, as the glucagon receptor gene (GCGR) is mutated.

==Mechanism==
Glucagonoma results from the overproduction of glucagon, a peptide hormone located in the pancreatic alpha cells. Classic symptoms include, but are not limited to, necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), diabetes mellitus, and weight loss. NME presents in about 70% of cases of glucagonoma, and is characterized by erythematous lesions over the distal extremities and the groin area. NME has occasionally been observed in people who do not have glucagonoma. People who develop glucagonoma from Mahvash disease also do not develop NME, implying that working glucagon receptors are needed in order for NME to be present in a person. Weight loss, the most commonly associated effect with glucagonoma, results from the glucagon hormone, which prevents the uptake of glucose by somatic cells. Diabetes is not present in all cases of glucagonoma, but does frequently result from the insulin and glucagon imbalance.

== Diagnosis ==
The presence of glucagonoma syndrome, the symptoms that accompany the pancreatic tumor, as well as elevated levels of glucagon in the blood, are what is used to diagnose glucagonoma. When a person presents with a blood glucagon concentration greater than 500 mg/mL along with the glucagonoma syndrome, a diagnosis can be established. Not all cases of hyperglucagonemia will lead to a diagnosis of glucagonoma. Elevated blood levels of glucagon are associated with other disorders like pancreatitis and kidney failure.

About 60% of people diagnosed with glucagonoma are women. Most of those that are diagnosed are between 45–60 years of age.

== Treatment ==
People who are diagnosed with sporadic glucagonoma often have an increased mortality rate compared to those with MEN1, as the latter group will go to the doctor for periodic visits. People whose tumor have metastasized cannot easily be treated as the tumor is resistant to chemotherapy. The only curative therapy for glucagonoma is surgery, and even this is not always successful.

Heightened glucagon secretion can be treated with the administration of octreotide, a somatostatin analog, which inhibits the release of glucagon. Doxorubicin and streptozotocin have also been used successfully to selectively damage alpha cells of the pancreatic islets. These do not destroy the tumor, but help to minimize progression of symptoms.

== History ==
Fewer than 251 cases of glucagonoma have been described in the literature since their first description by Becker in 1942. Because of its rarity (fewer than one in 20 million worldwide), long-term survival rates remain unknown. Glucagonoma accounts for approximately 1% of neuroendocrine tumors, although this may be an underestimate given that glucagonoma is associated with non-specific symptoms.

<doc id="606671" wikidata="Q29004679" url="?curid=606671" title="Mumps virus">
<text>The mumps virus (MuV) is the virus that causes mumps. MuV contains a single-stranded, negative-sense genome made of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Its genome is about 15,000 nucleotides in length and contains seven genes that encode nine proteins. The genome is encased by a capsid that is in turn surrounded by a viral envelope. MuV particles, called virions, are pleomorphic in shape and vary in size from 100 to 600 nanometers in diameter. One serotype and twelve genotypes that vary in their geographic distribution are recognized. Humans are the only natural host of the mumps virus.

MuV replicates first by binding to the surface of cells, whereby its envelope merges with the host cell membrane to release the capsid inside of the cell. Once inside, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase transcribes messenger RNA (mRNA) from the genome and later replicates the genome. After translation of viral proteins, virions are formed adjacent to the cell membrane, where they then leave the cell by budding from its surface, using the cell membrane as the envelope.

The mumps virus was first identified as the cause of mumps in 1934 and was first isolated in 1945. Within a few years after isolation, vaccines protecting against MuV infection had been developed. MuV was first recognized as a species in 1971, and it has been given the scientific name &quot;Mumps orthorubulavirus&quot;. It is assigned to the genus &quot;Orthorubulavirus&quot; in the subfamily &quot;Rubulavirinae&quot;, family &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot;.

==Characteristics==
===Genome===
The mumps virus contains a nonsegmented, single-stranded, linear genome that is 15,384 nucleotides in length and made of ribonucleic acid (RNA). The genome has negative sense, so mRNA can be transcribed directly from the genome. Mumps virus encodes seven genes in the following order:
* nucleocapsid (N) protein,
* V/P/I (V/phospho-(P)/I) proteins,
* matrix (M) protein, the most abundant protein in virions,
* fusion (F) protein,
* small hydrophobic (SH) transmembrane protein,
* hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and
* the large (L) protein, which combines with the P protein to form the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). RdRp acts as both a replicase to replicate the genome and as a transcriptase to transcribe mRNA from the genome.

The SH protein is thought to be involved in blocking NF(α)-mediated apoptosis of the host cell, which is done as an antiviral response to suppress the spread of viruses, though SH is not necessary for replication since MuVs engineered without SH are still able to replicate. The V protein is also involved in evading host antiviral responses by means of inhibiting production and signalling of interferons. Unlike the other proteins, the I protein&#x27;s function is unknown.

===Structure===
The genome of the mumps virus is encased by N proteins to form a flexible, loosely coiled helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex consisting of the genome surrounded by a nucleocapsid that RdRp is bound to. RNPs are surrounded by an envelope, a lipid membrane, which contains two types of spikes on its surface that correspond to the HN and F glycoproteins. M proteins are found on the inner side of the envelope, connecting the envelope to the RNP. Virions vary in size from 100 to 600 nanometers (nm) in diameter and are pleomorphic in shape.

===Life cycle===
MuV first interacts with a host cell by binding to its surface via the HN protein&#x27;s receptor, sialic acid, which binds to sialic acid receptors on the surface of host cells. Following attachment, the F protein is triggered and begins fusing the viral envelope with the host cell&#x27;s membrane. The F protein does so by changing from a metastable state to refolding to a more stable hairpin structure, which allows the contents of the virion, including the RNP, to be released into the host cell&#x27;s cytoplasm.

Upon entering the host cell, the RdRp begins transcribing mRNA from the genome inside the RNP. Transcription starts at or near the 3&#x27;-end (usually pronounced &quot;three prime end&quot;) at a promoter region and moves sequentially toward the 5&#x27;-end. One mRNA strand is transcribed for each gene, and it is necessary for all genes sequentially before a gene to be transcribed for that gene to be transcribed. Genes closer to the 3&#x27;-end are transcribed at the highest frequency, decreasing in frequency as RdRp approaches the 5&#x27;-end. RdRp synthesizes a cap on the 5&#x27;-end of the mRNA and a polyadenylated tail on the 3&#x27;-end consisting of hundreds of consecutive adenines. Once a gene has been transcribed, RdRp releases it into the cytoplasm for subsequent translation of viral proteins by host ribosomes. The V and P proteins are encoded by the same gene, so while transcribing mRNA, RdRp edits the mRNA by inserting two non-templated guanines into the mRNA to transcribes mRNA for the P protein.

Later in the replication cycle, once a sufficient number of nucleoproteins are present after translation, RdRp switches functions to replicate the genome. This occurs in a two-step process: first, a positive-sense antigenome is synthesized by RdRp from the negative-sense genome, and second, negative-sense genomic RNA strands are in turn synthesized by RdRp from the antigenome. During this process, the antigenome and newly replicated genomes are encapsidated by the nucleoprotein at the same time as replication. Progeny genomes can be used for additional transcription or replication or may simply be packaged into progeny virions.

HN and F proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and travel through the Golgi complex to the cell membrane, whether they bind to the cell membrane and protrude from the surface of the cell. M proteins bind to the sites of the cell membrane where HN and F proteins are, doing so at the positions where their &quot;tails&quot; protrude into the inside of the cell membrane in the cytoplasm. M proteins then act as a signals to newly synthesized RNPs as to where virions are to be formed. The interaction of RNP and M proteins is then thought to trigger budding from the host cell.

Budding from the host cell begins once M proteins recruit host class E proteins that form endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) structures at the site of budding. There, ESCRT proteins form into concentric spirals and push the contents of the virion outward from the cell in the form of a vesicle that protrudes from the cell. The ESCRT proteins then constrict the opening of the vesicle and terminate budding by cutting off the vesicle from the rest of the membrane, forming a complete virion that is released from the host cell. During this process, the neuraminidase of HN proteins aids in separation from the host membrane and prevents virion aggregation.

===Diversity===
The mumps virus has one serotype and twelve genotypes. The genotypes can be distinguished based on the F, SH, are HN genes. The SH gene has a degree of variation between genotypes ranging from 5% to 21%, the highest among MuV&#x27;s genes. The genotypes are named genotypes A to N, excluding E and M, i.e. genotypes A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and N. Genotypes E and M were previously recognized but were abolished due to phylogenetic analysis that MuVs assigned to them instead belonged genotypes C and K, respectively.

The different genotypes vary in frequency from region to region. For example, genotypes C, D, H, and J are more common in the western hemisphere, whereas genotypes F, G, and I are more common in Asia, although genotype G is considered to be a global genotype. Genotypes A and B have not been observed in the wild since the 1990s. This diversity of MuV is not reflected in the antibody response since because there is only one serotype, antibodies to one genotype are also functional against all others.

===Evolution===
The F, SH, HN genes, used to distinguish genotypes, are estimated to experience genetic mutations at a rate of substitutions per site per year, which is considered to be a very low mutation rate for an RNA virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the entire SH gene indicates that genotypes A and J are related in one branch and split apart from the other genotypes. In that second branch, genotype I is a sister clade of the other genotypes, which cluster into five sequential sister clades: G and H; D and K; C; L; and B, F, and N.

==Disease==
Humans are the only natural host of the mumps virus, which causes mumps. The disease is transmitted via contact with respiratory secretions such as aerosolized droplets and saliva. Infection leads to fever, muscle pain, and painful swelling of the parotid glands, two salivary glands situated on the sides of the mouth in front of the ears. Infection may also involve many other tissues and organs, resulting in a variety of inflammatory reactions such as encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, orchitis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, nephritis, oophoritis, and mastitis. Mumps is usually not life-threatening and typically resolves within a few weeks after the onset of symptoms, but long-term complications such as paralysis, seizures, hydrocephalus, and deafness can occur. Treatment is supportive in nature, and infection is preventable via vaccination.

==Classification==
Mumps virus, scientific name &quot;Mumps orthorubulavirus&quot;, is assigned to the genus &quot;Orthorubulavirus&quot;, in the subfamily &quot;Rubulavirinae&quot;, family &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot;. Strains of MuV are named and classified using the following system:
* MuVs (RNA sequence derived from clinical material) or MuVi (RNA sequence derived from cell culture)
* City.Country ISO3 code
* Week number.year, the date of onset of when the disease occurred, or the date of specimen collection if the disease onset date is unknown, or the date the sample was received in the laboratory if the two prior dates are unknown
* replicate in week
* [genotype], which indicates which genotype the strain belongs to
* (VAC), which is used to indicate strains derived from cases with a history of vaccination and with vaccine virus detected

This system is used in sequential order. For example, MuVs/NewYork.USA/17.11[B] (VAC) is a vaccine-associated genotype B MuV derived from clinical material in New York City, and MuVi/London.GBR/3.12/2[G] is a genotype G MuV derived from cell culture in London.

==History==
In 1934, mumps was identified as a viral disease by Claude D. Johnson and Ernest William Goodpasture. They found that rhesus macaques exposed to saliva taken from humans in the early stages of the disease developed mumps. Furthermore, they showed that mumps could be transferred to children via filtered and sterilized, bacteria-less preparations of macerated monkey parotid tissue, showing that it was a viral disease. The mumps virus was isolated for the first time in 1945 and by 1948 the first mumps vaccine had been developed.

Initial vaccines contained inactivated virus particles and provided short-term protection against mumps. In the 1960s, Maurice Hilleman developed a more effective mumps vaccine using live virus particles that were taken from his then five-year-old infected daughter, Jeryl Lynn. This vaccine was approved for use in 1967 and recommended in 1977, replacing prior vaccines that were less effective. Hilleman would also work to develop the MMR vaccine in 1971, effective against measles, mumps, and rubella. The &quot;Jeryl Lynn&quot; strain of the mumps virus, which belongs to genotype A, continues to be used in vaccines against mumps.

Mumps virus was recognized as a species in 1971 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), which oversees virus taxonomy, when it was assigned to the genus &quot;Paramyxovirus&quot;. Since then, it has undergone numerous taxonomic changes and changes to its scientific name:
* In 1995, &quot;Mumps virus&quot; was established as the type species of the newly established genus &quot;Rubulavirus&quot;.
* In 2016, &quot;Mumps virus&quot; was renamed to &quot;Mumps rubulavirus&quot;.
* In 2018, &quot;Mumps rubulavirus&quot; was renamed to &quot;Mumps orthorubulavirus&quot; to accompany &quot;Rubulavirus&quot; being abolished and replaced with the subfamily &quot;Rubulavirinae&quot; bearing the same name and the newly established genus &quot;Orthorubulavirus&quot;.
* In 2020, type species in virus taxonomy were abolished, so &quot;Mumps orthorubulavirus&quot; was removed as the type species of &quot;Orthorubulavirus&quot;.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;mumps&quot; is first attested circa 1600 and is the plural form of &quot;mump&quot;, meaning &quot;grimace&quot;, originally a verb meaning &quot;to whine or mutter like a beggar&quot;. The disease was likely called mumps in reference to the swelling caused by mumps parotitis, reflecting its impact on facial expressions as well as its causing of painful, difficult swallowing. &quot;Mumps&quot; was also used starting from the 17th century to mean &quot;a fit of melancholy, sullenness, silent displeasure&quot;.

<text>Ian Richard Hodder (born 23 November 1948, in Bristol) is a British archaeologist and pioneer of postprocessualist theory in archaeology that first took root among his students and in his own work between 1980 and 1990. At this time he had such students as Henrietta Moore, Ajay Pratap, Nandini Rao, Mike Parker Pearson, Paul Lane, John Muke, Sheena Crawford, Nick Merriman, Michael Shanks and Christopher Tilley. , he is Dunlevie Family Professor of Anthropology at Stanford University in the United States.

==Early life and education==
Hodder was born on 23 November 1948 in Bristol, England, to Professor Bramwell William &quot;Dick&quot; Hodder and his wife Noreen Victoria Hodder. He was brought up in Singapore and in Oxford, England. He was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford, then an all-boys private school.

He studied prehistoric archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology of the University of London, graduating with a first class Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1971. He then studied at Peterhouse, Cambridge, and was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree by the University of Cambridge in 1975: his supervisor was David L. Clarke and his thesis was titled &quot;Some Applications of Spatial Analysis in Archaeology&quot;.

==Academic career==
He was a lecturer at the University of Leeds from 1974 to 1977. He then returned to the University of Cambridge, where he was an assistant lecturer (1977 to 1981) and then lecturer (1981 to 1990) in archaeology. From 1990 to 2000, he was director of the Cambridge Archaeological Unit and a Fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge. The university appointed him Reader in Prehistory in 1990 and Professor of Archaeology in 1996.

In 1999, Hodder moved to Stanford University in the United States. He became Dunlevie Family Professor in 2002.

From 1993 - 2018, Hodder and an international team of archaeologists carried out new research and excavation of the 9,000-year-old Neolithic site of Çatalhöyük in central Anatolia (modern Turkey). He was the Director of the Çatalhöyük Archaeological Project which aimed to conserve the site, put it into context, and present it to the public. He endeavoured to explore the effects of non-positivistic methods in archaeology, which included providing each excavator with the opportunity to record his or her own individual interpretation of the site. In 2012 he dismissed most of the team, replacing them with other excavators and specialists, citing a need for a &quot;shake up.&quot; His permit was completed in 2018 when handed over the site to a Turkish team.

He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1996. In the 2019 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours he was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) for services to archaeology and UK/Turkey relations.

<text>Georg Joseph Vogler, also known as Abbé Vogler (15 June 1749 – 6 May 1814), was a German composer, organist, teacher and theorist. In a long and colorful career extending over many more nations and decades than was usual at the time, Vogler established himself as a foremost experimenter in baroque and early classic music. His greatest successes came as performer and designer for the organ at various courts and cities around Europe, as well as a teacher, attracting highly successful and devoted pupils such as Carl Maria von Weber. His career as a music theorist and composer however was mixed, with contemporaries such as Mozart believing Vogler to have been a charlatan. Despite his mixed reception in his own life, his highly original contributions in many areas of music (particularly musicology and organ theory) and influence on his pupils endured, and combined with his eccentric and adventurous career, prompted one historian to summarize Vogler as &quot;one of the most bizarre characters in the history of music&quot;.

==Biography==
Vogler was born at Pleichach in Würzburg. His father Jared Vogler was a violin maker and instrument-maker for the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg. The young Vogler studied law and theology in Würzburg and Bamberg, however he had possessed a prodigious talent and interest in music from childhood and continued to pursue that interest as a university student. In the late 1760s he was introduced to the Elector Palatine Karl Theodor, receiving appointment as the latter&#x27;s almoner at the court in Mannheim in 1770. Vogler became active in composing and performance there, and in 1771 his first major theatrical piece &quot;Singspiel – Der Kaufmann von Smyrna&quot; was performed for the court. In 1773 he was sponsored by the court to study under the Padre Martini in Bologna. Dissatisfied with the method of that learned theorist, he studied for five months under Francesco Antonio Vallotti at Padua, and met Johann Adolph Hasse in Venice. He afterwards proceeded to Rome, where, having been ordained priest, he was admitted to the famous Academy of Arcadia, made a knight of the Golden Spur, and appointed protonotary and chamberlain to the pope.

On his return to Mannheim in 1775, Vogler was appointed court chaplain and second &quot;maestro di cappella&quot;. From this position he was able to found a school to educate both amateur and aspiring musicians. His pupils were devoted to him, but he made innumerable enemies, for the principles upon which he taught were opposed to those of all other teachers. Two major musicological contributions followed: &quot;Tonwissenschaft und Tonsetzkunst&quot; on the theory of harmony, and &quot;Stimmbildungskunst&quot; on voice training. He also invented a new system of fingering for the harpsichord, a new form of construction for the organ, and from 1778 to 1781 edited the &quot;Betrachtungen der Mannheimer Tonschule&quot; – a periodical providing analysis of new compositions and essays on music. Mozart condemned the fingering as &quot;miserable&quot;, the young composer finding little musical success in Mannheim now musically dominated by Vogler. The proposed change in the construction of the organ consisted of simplifying the mechanism, introducing free-reeds in place of ordinary reed-stops, and substituting unisonous stops for the great &quot;mixtures&quot; then in vogue. Vogler&#x27;s writings on musical theory, though professedly based upon Vallotti&#x27;s principles, were to a great extent empirical. Nevertheless, in virtue of a certain substratum of truth which seems to have underlain his new theories, Vogler undoubtedly exercised a powerful influence over the progress of musical science, and numbered among his disciples some of the greatest geniuses of the period.

In 1778 Karl Theodor moved his court to Munich. Vogler temporarily remained in Mannheim before following him there in 1780, but, dissatisfied with the reception accorded to his dramatic compositions, soon quit his post. He went to Paris, where after much hostility his new system was recognized as a continuation of that started by Jean-Philippe Rameau. His organ concerts in the church of St. Sulpice attracted considerable attention. At the request of the royal court, he composed the opera &quot;Le Patriotism&quot;, which was performed at Versailles. Other works, including &quot;Eglė&quot; and &quot;La Kermesse, ou La Foire flamande&quot;, did not attract widespread critical acclaim however. Rather more successful were his tone paintings, performed in his capacity as an organ virtuoso, and Vogler played to packed houses around Europe in 1780s, although critical opinions remained mixed.

In 1786 he was appointed &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; by Gustav III of Sweden and founded his second music school in Stockholm. His major composition of this period was &quot;Gustav Adolf och Ebba Brahe&quot;, as well as the &quot;Pieces de Clavecin&quot; and a series of organ studies and didactic works on musical theory. He attained extraordinary celebrity by his performances on an instrument called the &quot;orchestrion&quot;, a species of organ invented by himself. As a member of the Swedish court he visited Saint Petersburg in 1788 where he met the Copenhagen organ builder Kirsnick (one of the first known to use free reeds in organ pipes). Starting in 1790 Vogler changed all the organs he performed on by adding new registers with free reeds. The first organ that was changed was in Rotterdam, and as many as 30 known rebuilds of organs followed. In 1790 he brought this instrument to London, and performed upon it with great effect at the Pantheon, for the concert-room where he also constructed an organ upon his own principles. The abbé&#x27;s pedal-playing excited great attention. His most popular pieces were a fugue on themes from the &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot;, composed after a visit to the Handel festival at Westminster Abbey, and &quot;A Musical Picture for the Organ&quot;, by Knecht, containing the imitation of a storm.

In 1792 his royal patron was assassinated, and he embarked upon a series of ambitious travels extended over Spain, Greece, Armenia, remote districts of Asia and Africa, and even Greenland, in search of uncorrupted forms of national melody and the existing traces of ancient musical practices on which Western music was founded. These travels also supplied new exotic themes and folk music traditions that found their way into his later compositions. He returned to Stockholm and remained in residence there until 1799, before once more establishing himself in Germany, where his compositions, both sacred and dramatic, received at last full credit. He also wrote &quot;Choral-System&quot; in 1800 as a result of his new theory on choral accompaniment. He spent time in Vienna from 1802 to 1804, making the acquaintances of Haydn and Beethoven. His operas &quot;Castore e Polluce&quot; and &quot;Samori&quot; received popular acclaim there and he was to gain two ardent disciples – Carl Maria von Weber and Johann Baptist Gänsbacher. Under his tutelage, both would become well known composers in their own right. After Vienna, Vogler continued to travel around Germany. While at Frankfurt in 1807 he received an invitation from Ludwig I, grand duke of Hesse-Darmstadt, offering him the appointment of &quot;Kapellmeister&quot;, with the order of merit, the title of privy councillor, a salary of 3000 florins, a house, a table supplied from the duke&#x27;s own kitchen, and other privileges, which determined him to bring his wanderings at last to a close. At Darmstadt he opened his third and most famous music school, the chief ornaments of which were Gänsbacher, Weber, and Giacomo Meyerbeer. One of Vogler&#x27;s last journeys was to Frankfurt in 1810, to witness the production of Weber&#x27;s &quot;Sylvana&quot;. He continued to work hard in music and organ building in old age, and died suddenly of apoplexy at Darmstadt on 6 May 1814.

<text>&quot;Dasein&quot; (; ) is a technical term in the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. Adopted from the ordinary German word meaning &quot;existence&quot;, Heidegger used it to refer to the mode of being that is particular to human beings. It is a form of being that is aware of and must confront such issues as personhood, mortality, and the dilemma or paradox of living in relationship with other humans while being ultimately alone with oneself.

== Meaning ==
In German, &quot;Dasein&quot; is the vernacular term for &quot;existence&quot;. It is derived from &quot;da-sein&quot;, which literally means &quot;being-there&quot; or &quot;there-being&quot;. In a philosophical context, it was first used by Leibniz and Wolff in the 17th century, as well as by Kant and Hegel in the 18th and 19th; however, Heidegger&#x27;s later association of the word with human existence was uncommon and not of special philosophical significance during this period.

Dasein for Heidegger is a mode of being involved with and caring for the immediate world in which one lives, while always remaining aware of the contingent element of that involvement, of the priority of the world to the self, and of the evolving nature of the self itself.

The opposite of this authentic self is everyday and inauthentic Dasein, the forfeiture of one&#x27;s individual meaning, destiny and lifespan, in favour of an (escapist) immersion in the public everyday world—the anonymous, identical world of the They and the Them.

In harmony with Nietzsche&#x27;s critique of the subject, as something definable in terms of consciousness, Heidegger distinguished Dasein from consciousness in order to emphasize the way that &quot;Being&quot; shapes our entire understanding and interpretation of the world.
&quot;This entity which each of us is himself...we shall denote by the term &#x27;Dasein (Heidegger, trans. 1927/1962, p.27).

&quot;[Dasein is] that entity which in its Being has this very Being as an issue...&quot; (Heidegger, trans. 1927/1962, p.68).
Heidegger sought to use the concept of Dasein to uncover the primal nature of &quot;Being&quot; (&quot;Sein&quot;), agreeing with Nietzsche and Dilthey that Dasein is always a being engaged in the world: neither a subject, nor the objective world alone, but the coherence of being-in-the-world. This ontological basis of Heidegger&#x27;s work thus opposes the Cartesian &quot;abstract agent&quot; in favour of practical engagement with one&#x27;s environment. Dasein is revealed by projection into, and engagement with, a personal world—a never-ending process of involvement with the world as mediated through the projects of the self.

Heidegger considered that language, everyday curiosity, logical systems, and common beliefs obscure Dasein&#x27;s nature from itself. Authentic choice means turning away from the collective world of Them, to face Dasein, one&#x27;s individuality, one&#x27;s own limited life-span, one&#x27;s own being. Heidegger thus intended the concept of Dasein to provide a stepping stone in the questioning of what it means to &quot;be&quot;—to have one&#x27;s own being, one&#x27;s own death, one&#x27;s own truth.

Heidegger also saw the question of Dasein as extending beyond the realms disclosed by positive science or in the history of metaphysics. &quot;Scientific research is not the only manner of Being which this entity can have, nor is it the one which lies closest. Moreover, Dasein itself has a special distinctiveness as compared with other entities; [...] it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, that Being is an issue for it.&quot; &quot;Being and Time&quot; stressed the ontological difference between entities and the being &quot;of&quot; entities: &quot;Being is always the Being of an entity.&quot; Establishing this difference is the general motif running through &quot;Being and Time&quot;.

Some scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, arguing that for Heidegger Dasein denoted a structured awareness or an institutional &quot;way of life&quot;. Others suggest that Heidegger&#x27;s early insistence on the ontological priority of Dasein was muted in his post-war writings.

== Origin and inspiration ==

Some have argued for an origin of Dasein in Chinese philosophy and Japanese philosophy: according to Tomonobu Imamichi, Heidegger&#x27;s concept of Dasein was inspired—although Heidegger remained silent on this—by Okakura Kakuzo&#x27;s concept of &quot;das-in-der-Welt-sein&quot; (being in the world) expressed in &quot;The Book of Tea&quot; to describe Zhuangzi&#x27;s Taoist philosophy, which Imamichi&#x27;s teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having followed lessons with him the year before. Parallel concepts are also found in Indian philosophy and in Native American lore.

== Other applications ==
Eero Tarasti considered Dasein very important in &quot;Existential Semiotics&quot;. In Tarasti&#x27;s view the term Dasein has been given a &quot;broader&quot; meaning, has stopped meaning the condition of an individual being flung into the world, having instead come to signify an &quot;existential phase&quot; with the sociohistoric characteristics from which signs extensively emerge.

From this point of view, transcendence is the desire to surpass realist acceptance of the world as it is and to move towards a political, ethical and planned reality of subjectivity in semiotic relations with the world.

Jacques Lacan turned in the 1950s to Heidegger&#x27;s Dasein for his characterisation of the psychoanalyst as being-for-death (&quot;être-pour-la-mort&quot;). Similarly, he saw the analyst as searching for authentic speech, as opposed to &quot;the subject who loses his meaning in the objectifications of discourse...[which] will give him the wherewithal to forget his own existence and his own death&quot;.

Alfred Schütz distinguished between direct and indirect social experience, emphasising that in the latter, &quot;My orientation is not toward the existence (&quot;Dasein&quot;) of a concrete individual Thou. It is not toward any subjective experiences now being constituted in all their uniqueness in another&#x27;s mind&quot;.

Aleksandr Dugin uses Dasein as the foundation for the &quot;Fourth Political Theory&quot;, emphasizing Dasein and its role in Russian society. He puts this in opposition to Western (more specifically American) society, which is far too individualistic with an inauthentic view of individuality.

== Criticism ==
Heidegger used the concept of Dasein to discuss Nazi ideology, and to advocate support for Hitler. In the context of the German election of November 1933 – in which the electorate was presented with a single Nazi-approved list of candidates – he said the following:
The German people has been summoned by the Führer to vote; the Führer, however, is asking nothing from the people; rather, he &quot;is giving&quot; the people the possibility of making, directly, the highest free decision of all: whether itthe entire peoplewants its own existence (&quot;Dasein&quot;), or whether it does not want it. [...] On November 12, the German people as a whole will choose &quot;its&quot; future, and this future is bound to the Führer. [...] There are not separate foreign and domestic policies. There is only one will to the full existence (&quot;Dasein&quot;) of the State. The Führer has awakened this will in the entire people and has welded it into a single resolve.

Theodor W. Adorno criticised Heidegger&#x27;s concept of Dasein as an idealistic retreat from historical reality.

Richard Rorty considered that with Dasein, Heidegger was creating a conservative myth of being, complicit with the Romantic elements of Nazism.

According to Julian Wolfreys, &quot;There is no direct &#x27;face&#x27;-to-&#x27;face&#x27; relation for Heidegger; despite his invaluable critique of ontology, he still reduces the relation between Dasein and Dasein as mediated by the question and problematic of being.&quot;

<text>Count Vittorio Alfieri (, , ; 16 January 17498 October 1803) was an Italian dramatist and poet, considered the &quot;founder of Italian tragedy.&quot; He wrote nineteen tragedies, sonnets, satires, and a notable autobiography.

==Early life==
Alfieri was born at Asti, Kingdom of Sardinia, now in Piedmont.

His father died when he was very young, and he was brought up by his mother, who married a second time, until, at the age of ten, he was placed in the academy of Turin. After a year at the academy, he went on a short visit to a relative at Coni (mod. Cuneo). During his stay there he composed a sonnet chiefly borrowed from lines in Ariosto and Metastasio, the only poets he had at that time read. At thirteen, Alfieri began the study of civil and canon law, but this only made him more interested in literature, particularly French romances. The death of his uncle, who had taken charge of his education and conduct, left him free, at the age of fourteen, to enjoy his paternal inheritance, augmented by the addition of his uncle&#x27;s fortune. He began to attend a riding-school, where he acquired an enthusiasm for horses and equestrian exercise that continued for the rest of his life.

Having obtained permission from the king to travel abroad, he departed in 1766, under the care of an English tutor. Seeking novelty in foreign cultures, and being anxious to become acquainted with the French theatre, he proceeded to Paris, but he appears to have been completely dissatisfied with everything he witnessed in France and did not like the French people. In the Netherlands he fell in love with a married woman, but she went with her husband to Switzerland. Alfieri, depressed by the incident, returned home and again began studying literature. Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot; inspired him with a passion for freedom and independence. He recommenced his travels; and his only gratification, in the absence of freedom among the continental states, came from contemplating the wild and sterile regions of the north of Sweden, where gloomy forests, lakes and precipices encouraged his sublime and melancholy ideas. In search of an ideal world, Alfieri passed quickly through various countries. During a journey to London he engaged in an intrigue with Lady Penelope Ligonier, a married woman of high rank. The affair became a widely publicised scandal and ended in a divorce that ruined Lady Ligonier and forced Alfieri to leave the country. He then visited Spain and Portugal, where he became acquainted with the Abbe Caluso, who remained through life the most attached and estimable friend he ever possessed. In 1772, Alfieri returned to Turin. This time he fell for the Marchesa Turinetti di Prie, but it was another doomed affair. When she fell ill, he spent his time dancing attendance on her, and one day wrote a dialogue or scene of a drama, which he left at her house. When the couple quarreled, the piece was returned to him, and being retouched and extended to five acts, it was performed at Turin in 1775, under the title of &quot;Cleopatra&quot;.

==Literary career==

From this moment Alfieri was seized with an insatiable thirst for theatrical fame, to which he devoted the remainder of his life. His first two tragedies, &quot;Filippo&quot; and &quot;Polinice&quot;, were originally written in French prose. When he came to versify them in Italian, he found that, because of many dealings with foreigners, he was poor at expressing himself. With the view of improving his Italian, he went to Tuscany and, during an alternate residence at Florence and Siena, he completed &quot;Filippo&quot; and &quot;Polinice&quot;, and had ideas for other dramas. While thus employed, he became acquainted with Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, also known as the Countess of Albany, who was living with her husband, Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;), at Florence. For her he formed a serious attachment. With this motive, to remain at Florence, he did not wish to be bound to Piedmont. He therefore ceded his whole property to his sister, the countess Cumiana, keeping for himself an annuity that was about half his original income. Louise, motivated by the ill-treatment she received from her husband, sought refuge in Rome, where she at length received permission from the Pope to live apart from him. Alfieri followed her to Rome, where he completed fourteen tragedies, four of which were published at Siena.

For the sake of Louise&#x27;s reputation, he left Rome, and, in 1783, travelled through different states of Italy, publishing six additional tragedies. The interests of his love and literary glory had not diminished his love of horses. He went to England solely for the purpose of purchasing a number of these animals, which he took back to Italy. On his return he learned that Louise had gone to Colmar in Alsace, where he joined her, and they lived together for the rest of his life. They chiefly passed their time between Alsace and Paris, but at length took up their abode entirely in that metropolis. While here, Alfieri made arrangements with Didot for an edition of his tragedies, but was soon after forced to quit Paris by the storms of the French Revolution. He recrossed the Alps with the countess, and finally settled at Florence. The last ten years of his life, which he spent in that city, seem to have been the happiest of his existence. During that long period, his tranquility was only interrupted by the entrance of the Revolutionary armies into Florence in 1799.

Alfieri&#x27;s political writings were among those which had contributed to the revolutionary atmosphere. His essay, &quot;Della Tirannide&quot;, denounced absolutism and was dedicated to liberty as a universal right. In &quot;Del Principe e delle Lettere&quot;, he declared poets to be the heralds of freedom and human dignity and the natural enemies of tyrants. He supported the American Revolution and wrote a collection of odes published as &quot;L’America libera&quot; and dedicated a play about the ancient Romans to George Washington.
When the French Revolution broke out, he supported its initial liberal phase, but the violence of the Reign of Terror turned him strongly against the radical Jacobins. Despite Alfieri&#x27;s increasingly anti-French sentiments, he was honored when the French army arrived in Italy and Napoleon himself attended a performance of Alfieri&#x27;s &quot;Virginia&quot;, a play set in ancient Rome in which the people demand liberty and rise to overthrow a tyrant. Alfieri&#x27;s ideas continued to influence Italian liberals and republicans such as Piero Gobetti throughout the Risorgimento and well into the twentieth century.

He spent the concluding years of his life studying Greek literature and perfecting a series of comedies. His labor on this subject exhausted his strength and made him ill. He eschewed his physicians prescriptions in favor of his own remedies, which made the condition worse. He died in Florence in 1803. His last words were &quot;Clasp my hand, my dear friend, I die!&quot;

He is buried in the Church of Santa Croce, Florence next to Machiavelli.
==Character==

Alfieri&#x27;s character may be best appreciated from the portrait he drew of himself in his own Memoirs of his Life. He was evidently of an irritable, impetuous, and almost ungovernable temper. Pride, which seems to have been a ruling sentiment, may account for many apparent inconsistencies of his character. But his less amiable qualities were greatly softened by the cultivation of literature. His application to study gradually tranquillized his temper and softened his manners, leaving him at the same time in perfect possession of those good qualities he inherited from nature: a warm and disinterested attachment to his family and friends, united to a generosity, vigour and elevation of character, which rendered him not unworthy to embody in his dramas the actions and sentiments of Grecian heroes.

==Contribution to Italian literature==
It is to his dramas that Alfieri is chiefly indebted for the high reputation he has attained. Before his time the Italian language, so harmonious in the Sonnets of Petrarch and so energetic in the Commedia of Dante, had been invariably languid and prosaic in dramatic dialogue. The pedantic and inanimate tragedies of the 16th century were followed, during the Iron Age of Italian literature, by dramas of which extravagance in the sentiments and improbability in the action were the chief characteristics. The prodigious success of the &quot;Merope&quot; of Maffei, which appeared in the commencement of the 18th century, may be attributed more to a comparison with such productions than to intrinsic merit. In this degradation of tragic taste, the appearance of the tragedies of Alfieri was perhaps the most important literary event that had occurred in Italy during the 18th century.

On these tragedies, it is difficult to pronounce a judgment, as the taste and system of the author underwent considerable change and modification in the intervals between the three periods of their publication. An excessive harshness of style, an asperity of sentiment, and total want of poetical ornament are the characteristics of his first four tragedies, &quot;Filippo&quot;, &quot;Polinice&quot;, &quot;Antigone&quot;, and &quot;Virginia&quot;. These faults were in some measure corrected in the six tragedies he wrote some years after, and in those he published along with &quot;Saul&quot;, the drama that enjoyed the greatest success of all his productions. This popularity is partly attributable to Alfieri&#x27;s severe and unadorned style, which fit the patriarchal simplicity of the age. Though there is a considerable difference in his dramas, there are certain qualities common to all. None of the plots are of his own invention, but are founded on either mythological fable or history. Most of them had been previously treated by the Greek dramatists or by Seneca. &quot;Rosmunda&quot;, the only one that could be of his own contrivance, and which is certainly the least happy effusion of his genius, is partly founded on the eighteenth novel of the third part of Bandello and partly on Prévost&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;un homme de qualité&quot; (&quot;Memoirs of a Man of Quality&quot;).

Another characteristic common to every Alfieri&#x27;s tragedy is that the main character is always a tragic &quot;hero of freedom&quot; whose ambition and need of revolution push him to fight tyranny and oppression wherever they exist. Usually, this is accomplished in the most radical manner, up to killing the tyrant and facing death for it afterwards. This desire for freedom always moves the hero into a dimension of solitude, pessimism, and internal torment, but he keeps going despite knowing that the majority of the people around him can&#x27;t understand or share his views and struggles, or that his goals are almost impossible to reach. This concept is called .

But whatever subject he chooses, his dramas are always formed on the Grecian model and breathe a freedom and independence worthy of an Athenian poet. Indeed, his and &quot;Bruto&quot; may rather be considered oratorical declamations and dialogues on liberty than tragedies. The unities of time and place are not so scrupulously observed in his dramas as in the ancients, but he rigidly adheres to a unity of action and interest. He infuses each play with one great action and one ruling passion, taking care to remove as much as possible every other event or feeling. In this excessive zeal for the observance of unity he seems to have forgotten that its charm consists in producing a common relation between multiplied feelings, and not in the bare exhibition of one, divested of those various accompaniments that give harmony to the whole. Consistently with the austere and simple manner he thought the chief excellence of dramatic composition, he excluded from his scene all , all philosophical reflexions, and that highly ornamented versification so assiduously cultivated by his predecessors. In his anxiety, however, to avoid all superfluous ornament, he has stripped his dramas of the embellishments of imagination; and for the harmony and flow of poetical language he has substituted, even in his best performances, a style that, though correct and pure, is generally harsh, elaborate and abrupt; often strained into unnatural energy or condensed into factitious conciseness.

The chief excellence of Alfieri consists in powerful delineation of dramatic character. In his &quot;Filippo&quot; he has represented, almost with the masterly touches of Tacitus, the sombre character, the dark mysterious counsels, the &quot;suspensa semper et obscura verba&quot;, of the modern Tiberius. In &quot;Polinice&quot;, the characters of the rival brothers are beautifully contrasted; in &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; (&quot;Mary Stuart&quot;), that unfortunate queen is represented as unsuspicious, impatient of contradiction and violent in her attachments. In &quot;Mirra&quot;, the character of Ciniro is perfect as a father and king, and Cecri is a model of a wife and mother. In the representation of that species of mental alienation where the judgment has perished but traces of character still remain, he is peculiarly happy. The insanity of Saul is skilfully managed, and the horrid joy of Orestes in killing Aegisthus rises finely and naturally to madness in finding that, at the same time, he had inadvertently slain his mother.

Whatever the merits or defects of Alfieri, he may be considered as the founder of a new school in the Italian drama. His country hailed him as her sole tragic poet, and his successors in the same path of literature have regarded his bold, austere and rapid manner as the genuine model of tragic composition.

Besides his tragedies, Alfieri published during his life many sonnets; five odes on American independence; one tramelogedia, (&quot;Abele&quot;); and the poem of Etruria, based on the assassination of Alexander, duke of Florence. Of his prose works the most distinguished for animation and eloquence is the &quot;Panegyric on Trajan&quot;, composed in a transport of indignation at the supposed feebleness of Pliny&#x27;s eulogium. His books &quot;La Tirannide&quot; and the &quot;Essays on Literature and Government&quot; are remarkable for elegance and vigour of style, but are too evidently imitations of the manner of Machiavelli. His &quot;Antigallican&quot;, which he wrote while composing his &quot;Defence of Louis XVI&quot;, presents a historical and satirical view of the French Revolution.

The posthumous works of Alfieri consist of satires, six political comedies, and the &quot;Memoirs of his Life&quot;, work that will always be read with interest in spite of the cold and languid gravity he applies to the most interesting adventures and strongest passions of his agitated life.

==Death==
Alfieri caught a &quot;chill on his stomach&quot; while out driving on 3 October 1803. His health deteriorated and he died in his chair on 8 October. He was buried in the church of Santa Croce, Florence. Louise arranged for Antonio Canova to erect a monument in his memory. This took 6 years to be executed, being finally installed in Santa Croce in the autumn of 1810.

==Freemasonry==
The name of Vittorio Alfieri was never registered in the official publications of the Piedmont Freemasonry. It is proved Alfieri was initiated in the regular Masonic Lodge &quot;Vittoria&quot; of Naples which was an obedience of the Gran Loggia Nazionale &quot;Lo Zelo&quot;, founded in 1874-185 by aristocrat Freemasons closely linked to the queen Maria Carolina of Austria.

Many of Alfieri&#x27;s friends were Freemasons, as it is attested by the documents conserved in the center of studies located in the town of Asti. The first edition of the Alfieri&#x27;s tragedy was published in 1763 and sent to the following notable Freemasons: the von Kaunitz brothers of Turin, Giovanni Pindemonte e Gerolamo Zulian in Venice, Annibale Beccaria (brother of Cesare), Luigi Visconte Arese e Gioacchino Pallavicini in Milan, Carlo Gastone Rezzonico in Parma, Saveur Grimaldi in Genoa, Ludovico Savioli in Bologna, Kiliano Caraccioli which was Venerable Master in Naples, Giuseppe Guasco in Rome.

On August 27, 1782, the name of Alfieri is cited in the &quot;Tableau des Membres de la Respectable Loge de la Victoire à l&#x27;Orient de Naples&quot; (&quot;List of the members of the Venerable Lodge &quot;Victoire&quot; in the Orient of Naples&quot;) as &quot;Comte Alfieri, Gentilhomme de Turin&quot; (count Alfieri, gentleman of Turin). Some months later, the Savoia dynasty banned any Masonic activity from the Piedmont and the Great Master count Asinari of Bernezzo was obliged to transfer his title to the prince Diego Naselli of Naples. Napes become the official seat of the Italian Scottish Rite Freemasonry.

His poetry &quot;Vita&quot;, published in 1775, says:

The chapter continues mentioning the Scottish Rite degrees of &quot;Venerabile&quot;, &quot;primo Vigilante&quot;, &quot;Oratore&quot; and &quot;Segretario&quot;.

<text>Amandus ( 584 – 679), commonly called Saint Amand, was a bishop of Tongeren-Maastricht and one of the catholic missionaries of Flanders. He is venerated as a saint, particularly in France and Belgium.

==Life==
The chief source of details of his life is the &quot;Vita Sancti Amandi&quot;, an eighth-century text attributed to Beaudemond (). The vita was expanded by Philippe, abbot of Aumône. According to this biography, Amand was born in Lower Poitou. He was of noble birth but at the age of twenty, he became a monk on the Île d&#x27;Yeu, against the wishes of his family. His father threatened to disinherit him if he did not return home. From there Amandus went to Bourges and became a pupil of bishop Austregisilus. There he lived in solitude in a cell for fifteen years, living on no more than bread and water.

Humbert of Maroilles was of a noble family and trained as a monk in Laon. However, upon the death of his parents, he returned to his estates in Mézières sur Oise to settle some inheritance issues and found fine food, servants, and various conveniences sufficiently distracting that he gave up any thought of the monastic life, until one day Amandus took him on a pilgrimage to Rome. Humbert became his disciple and companion.

After the pilgrimage to Rome, Amandus was made a missionary bishop in the Merovingian kingdom in 628, without a fixed diocese. At the request of Clotaire II, he evangelized the pagan inhabitants of Ghent, later extending his field of operations to all of Flanders. Initially, he had little success, suffering persecution and undergoing great hardships. However, after allegedly performing a miracle (bringing back to life a hanged criminal) the attitude of the people changed and he made many converts. He founded a monastery at Elnon where he served as abbot for four years. Amandus was made a bishop in 628.
He returned to the Merovingian kingdom in 630. Amandus was a close friend of Adalbard of Ostrevent, whom he advised on the founding Marchiennes Abbey. His disciple, Jonatus, was made abbot of the new house. Amandus, however, angered Dagobert I by attempting to have the king amend his life. In spite of the intervention of Acarius, Amand was expelled from the kingdom and went to Gascony.

Later Dagobert asked him to return and tutor the heir to the throne. Amand however declined. In 633, Amandus founded two monasteries in Ghent; one at Blandinberg, and the other named for St. Bavo, who gave his estate for its foundation. His next missionary task was among the Slavic people of the Danube valley in present-day Slovakia but this was unsuccessful. Amand went to Rome and reported to the Pope. In 639, he built an abbey near Tournai.

From 647 till 650, Amand briefly served as Bishop of Maastricht. The pope gave him some advice on how to deal with disobedient clerics and told him about the Monothelite, at that time prevalent in the East. Amand was commissioned by the pope to organize church councils in Neustria and Austrasia in order to pass on the various decrees from Rome. The bishops asked Amand to transmit the proceedings of the church councils to the pope. He resigned the see to St. Remaclus, to resume his missionary work.

Around this time, Amand established contact with the family of Pepin of Landen and helped Gertrude of Nivelles and her mother Itta establishing the famous monastery of Nivelles. At the same time, he was now 70 years old, the inhabitants of the Basque country asked him to return to their country to evangelize, although 30 years earlier he had preached there in vain. Returning home, he founded several more monasteries in present-day Belgium with the help of king Dagobert.

Amand died in Elnone Abbey (later Saint-Amand Abbey, in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux, near Tournai) at the age of ninety.

==Veneration==

Known for his hospitality, Amand is the patron saint of all who produce beer: brewers, innkeepers and bartenders. He is also the patron of vine growers, vintners and merchants, and of Boy Scouts. 

His feast day is 6 February. Although mostly revered in Flanders and Picardy, he is also venerated in England, where at least one private chapel (at East Hendred in Oxfordshire) is dedicated to him.

<doc id="606698" wikidata="Q376800" url="?curid=606698" title="Jamie Gorelick">
<text>Jamie Shona Gorelick (; born May 6, 1950) is an American lawyer who served as the Deputy Attorney General of the United States from 1994 to 1997, during the Clinton administration. She has been a partner at WilmerHale since 2003 and has served on the board of directors of Amazon since February 2012.

Gorelick served on British Petroleum&#x27;s Advisory Council, as their top legal counsel after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. She was appointed by former Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle to serve as a commissioner on the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, which sought to investigate the circumstances leading up to the September 11 attacks, and also served as Vice Chairman of Fannie Mae.

== Early life and education ==
Gorelick was born in Brooklyn, New York City to Leonard and Shirley Gorelick, and grew up in Great Neck, New York, in a Jewish family. She attended Great Neck South High School, graduating in 1968. She went on to receive a J.D. &quot;cum laude&quot; from Harvard Law School in 1975.

Gorelick was president of the District of Columbia Bar from 1992 to 1993.

She is a law partner in the Washington office of WilmerHale and a member of the boards of Amazon.com, United Technologies Corporation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless and Legal Affairs.

== Deputy Attorney General ==

While serving as Deputy Attorney General under Bill Clinton, Gorelick spoke in favor of banning the use of strong encryption and called for a key escrow system to allow the Federal government access to encrypted communication.

== Private practice ==
Gorelick is a lobbyist for the lending industry fighting student loan reform. Gorelick has also represented Cardinal Health.

==Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae)==
Gorelick was appointed Vice Chairman of Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) from 1997 to 2003. She served alongside former Clinton Administration official Franklin Raines. During that period, Fannie Mae developed a $10 billion accounting scandal.

On March 25, 2002, &quot;Business Week&quot; interviewed Gorelick about the health of Fannie Mae. Gorelick is quoted as saying, &quot;We believe we are managed safely. We are very pleased that Moody&#x27;s gave us an A-minus in the area of bank financial strength – without a reference to the government in any way. Fannie Mae is among the handful of top-quality institutions.&quot; One year later, government regulators accused Fannie Mae of improper accounting &quot;to the tune of $9 billion&quot; in unrecorded losses.

In an additional scandal concerning falsified financial transactions that helped the company meet earnings targets for 1998, a &quot;manipulation&quot; that triggered multimillion-dollar bonuses for top executives, Gorelick received $779,625.

A 2006 report of an investigation by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight into Fannie Mae&#x27;s accounting practices and corporate governance revealed that from 1998 to 2002 Gorelick received a total of $26.5 million in income from Fannie Mae.

==9/11 Commission==

Gorelick&#x27;s wrote in an op-ed for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;At last week&#x27;s hearing, Attorney General John Ashcroft, facing criticism, asserted that &#x27;the single greatest structural cause for September 11 was the wall that segregated criminal investigators and intelligence agents&#x27; and that I built that wall through a March 1995 memo.&quot; However, the report from the 9/11 Commission, co-authored by Gorelick, asserts that the &#x27;wall&#x27; limiting the ability of federal agencies to cooperate had existed since the 1980s and is in fact not one singular wall but a series of restrictions created over the course of over twenty years.

===Conflict of interest===
A 1995 U.S. Department of Justice memorandum states that the procedures her memorandum put in place for the investigation of the 1993 WTC bombing &quot;go beyond what is legally required...[to] prevent any risk of creating an unwarranted appearance that FISA is being used to avoid procedural safeguards which would apply in a criminal investigation.&quot; The wall intentionally exceeded the requirements of FISA (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978) for the purposes of criminal investigations, as well as the then-existing federal case law. These rules were, shortly after their creation, expanded to regulate such communications in future counter-terrorism investigations.

Gorelick eventually recused herself from reviewing her own role in the regulation of information about terrorist activities. Attorney General Ashcroft was incensed before the 9/11 Commission to learn that the commission had not investigated or been told of Gorelick&#x27;s memo or her role regarding the &quot;wall&quot;. This assertion was disputed by former senator Slade Gorton (R-WA), a member of the 9/11 Commission, who said, &quot;nothing Jamie Gorelick wrote had the slightest impact on the Department of Defense or its willingness or ability to share intelligence information with other intelligence agencies.&quot; Gorton also asserted that &quot;the wall&quot; was a long-standing policy that had resulted from the Church committee in the 1970s, and that the policy only prohibits transfer of certain information from prosecutors to the intelligence services and never prohibited information flowing in the opposite direction.

Testifying before the commission, Attorney General John Ashcroft said, &quot;Although you understand the debilitating impact of the wall, I cannot imagine that the commission knew about this memorandum, so I have declassified it for you and the public to review,&quot; he said. &quot;Full disclosure compels me to inform you that its author is a member of this commission.&quot;

== Lawyer for Opioid Distributor ==
Jamie Gorelick has been accused of lobbying on behalf of the drug industry and limiting the government&#x27;s ability to hold opioid distributors accountable. Gorelick&#x27;s firm WilmerHale represented Cardinal Health, an opioid distributor. Since 2011, the Drug Enforcement Administration had been building a case for Cardinal Health for distributing staggering amounts of drugs to treat pain. In 2012, Cardinal Health got wind of the DEA&#x27;s investigation into the company&#x27;s distribution of millions of opioid drugs every month. Joseph T. Rannazzisi, the head the DEA&#x27;s Office of Diversion Control at the time, believed that Gorelick&#x27;s actions compromised the DEA&#x27;s active investigation.

== Lawyer for Duke University ==
Gorelick was added in February 2008 to Duke University&#x27;s defense team after the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case scandal. The University faced claims by unaccused members of the team that they &quot;railroaded 47 Duke University students as either principals or accomplices.&quot; Gorelick and her law firm left the defense team in July 2011 after Judge Beatty denied Duke&#x27;s motions to dismiss and let the lawsuits proceed in April.

== Lawyer for Jared Kushner ==
Gorelick represented Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of Donald Trump, as he considered a possible role in the White House. She had advised Kushner, who has sprawling financial interests in a multibillion-dollar global real estate empire, on how he might comply with federal ethics and anti-nepotism laws. She has argued that although officials leading federal agencies are barred from hiring relatives, the White House is not an agency and thus exempt. Gorelick argued that if Kushner forgoes a White House salary, he would not be bound by federal nepotism rules. Though Kushner has no experience in government or public policy, Trump directed that during his presidential transition all foreign-policy matters be relayed through Kushner. Kushner participated in meetings between Trump and foreign heads of state while continuing to run the Kushner Companies. On July 14, 2017, Gorelick stepped away from the lead role in the Russian investigation and turned over all responsibilities to Abbe Lowell. Gorelick will still work on other matters for Kushner that she was originally retained for. In September 2017 she briefly fell for fake emails originating from &quot;email prankster&quot; James Linton purporting to be from Kushner but didn&#x27;t reveal anything confidential.

==Charitable work and community involvement==
Gorelick has served on the boards of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Urban Institute, the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. She was elected to The American Law Institute in 1987.

==Personal==
She is married to Richard Edward Waldhorn, a pulmonologist, and has two children.

<text>N.V. Koolhoven was an aircraft manufacturer based in Rotterdam, Netherlands. From its conception in 1926 to its destruction in the Blitzkrieg in May 1940, the company remained the second major Dutch aircraft manufacturer (after Fokker). Although many of its aircraft were as unsuccessful economically as they were brilliant from a design standpoint, the company managed to score several &#x27;hits&#x27;, amongst them the FK-58 single-seat monoplane fighter, the FK-50 twin-engine passenger transport, and the FK-41, built in England under licence by Desoutter.

==History==
In 1920, aircraft designer Frederick &quot;Frits&quot; Koolhoven returned from England to his native Netherlands. The postwar years had not been good to him; the British Aerial Transport Company for which he was chief designer went bankrupt and all other manufacturers were struggling for survival too hard to think of hiring. The Netherlands, Koolhoven hoped, would be better. But there he found that while the Netherlands&#x27; new airline KLM was a willing taker for all the aircraft it could get, the market was almost completely dominated by Fokker. Out of other options, Koolhoven returned to his old job and worked as an automobile engineer for the Spyker automobile factory.

In 1921, his luck began to change when a group of businessmen founded the &quot;N.V. Nationale Vliegtuig Industrie&quot; (&quot;National Aircraft Industry, Incorporated&quot;) and hired him as their chief designer. The time was still not yet ripe for a second Dutch aircraft manufacturer and, as with BAT, N.V.I. produced technically advanced designs that attracted attention from all over the world, but received virtually no orders. The company lasted only four years.

At the demise of N.V.I. Koolhoven had become sufficiently business-aware to convince several of the N.V.I. shareholders that the company would still be viable, if only &quot;he&quot; would have complete control of the operations. Enough of the shareholders agreed and even while N.V.I. was being dissolved, its assets were almost immediately taken over by a new company: &quot;N.V. Koolhoven vliegtuigen&quot; (Koolhoven aircraft, Inc.).

For its first five years, 1925 to 1930, the company managed to stay afloat by making one-off purpose-built airplanes to order, slowly branching out into the private aircraft sector and trying to break into the military market. In 1930, the company finally struck gold with the FK-41 high-wing tourist monoplane. Although N.V. Koolhoven itself only built 7 FK-41&#x27;s the airplane was built under licence in England as the Desoutter Mk.I and later improved as the Mk.II.

By 1933 the military market had picked up and Koolhoven increasingly built trainers and observation aircraft for the Dutch air force as well as several other countries. By 1938, with war looming, the company&#x27;s order books continued to fill as air forces from all over Europe were virtually fighting over each plane that rolled off the production line. Even France found itself buying Koolhoven FK-58 fighters as its own aircraft industry was unable to keep up with the demand from the Armée de l&#x27;Air.

In 1938, the Koolhoven factory at Waalhaven covered 8,000 square meters and had 1,200 employees. While still no match for Fokker, Koolhoven had established itself firmly as the number two manufacturer in the Netherlands.

The end came on 10 May 1940. As a prelude to the German invasion of the Netherlands, the Luftwaffe set out to destroy as much as possible of the Dutch Air Force on the ground. On the morning of that day, a massive armada of German bombers appeared over Waalhaven and almost completely destroyed the airfield and its surrounding facilities. This included the Koolhoven factory and within a few hours, the company had been reduced to a pile of rubble and all drawings, models, and documentation of Koolhoven&#x27;s projects were destroyed. Today, the only photographs remaining of Koolhoven&#x27;s planes are newspaper clippings and private snapshots.

Frederick Koolhoven died of a stroke on 1 July 1946. His company, although without means of production, continued to exist as a holding. Over the next ten years various attempts were made to start up new projects, but apart from the construction of two prototype sailplanes nothing happened and in 1956 N.V. Koolhoven Aeroplanes closed and was liquidated.

==Aircraft==
Apart from the Heidevogel of 1911, Koolhoven designed 59 aircraft, which he consecutively numbered FK-1 to FK-59. About half of these were design studies that were never built. Koolhoven designed projects FK-1 to FK-28 in England for Armstrong Whitworth and BAT, projects FK-29 to FK-34 for N.V.I. and projects FK-35 to FK-59 for his own company. The first &#x27;true&#x27; Koolhoven airplane therefore would have been the FK-35. However, on formation of the N.V. Koolhoven, Frits Koolhoven took with him the design of the FK-30 &quot;Toerist&quot; light sportsplane originally designed for NVI, but not built. Several &quot;Toerists&quot; built by the new FK Koolhoven therefore constitute the earliest airplanes of that company, if not by production date, then at least by numbering.

The website of the Koolhoven foundation lists 26 Koolhoven designs, starting with the F.K.30 and then going from F.K.35 to F.K.59. It however also notes that the designs F.K.37, 38, 39 and 59 were never built, while only giving pictures of wooden models for the designs F.K.35 and F.K.36. Jane&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Aviation only lists the Koolhoven designs F.K.40, 41, 42, 43, 46, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53 and 58 but mentions a F.K.50-b bomber project, which the Koolhoven foundation site doesn&#x27;t.

The best-known of those designs are the F.K.41 high-wing monoplane, which was built under licence as the Desoutter Mk.II and the F.K.50 twin engine transport monoplane, two of which were used by the Swiss aircraft company . Amongst the military designs, the most successful were the Koolhoven F.K.51 biplane reconnaissance aircraft, which saw service in extensive numbers in the Dutch air force from the mid-1930s until the Second World War, the Koolhoven F.K.52 biplane which was used by the Finnish Air Force and the Koolhoven F.K.58 single-seat monoplane fighter. The latter was the plane ordered by France and flew in the Armée de l&#x27;Air during the Battle of France

<doc id="606709" wikidata="Q2283481" url="?curid=606709" title="Thaxted">
<text>Thaxted is a town and civil parish in the Uttlesford district of north-west Essex, England. The town is in the valley of the River Chelmer, not far from its source in the nearby village of Debden, and is 97 metres (318 feet) above sea level (where the parish church stands).

The town is north from the county town of Chelmsford and east from the M11 motorway. The parish contains the hamlets of Cutlers Green, Bardfield End Green, Sibleys Green, Monk Street and Richmond&#x27;s Green. Much of its status as a &quot;town&quot; rests on its prominent late medieval guildhall, a place where guilds of skilled tradesmen regulated their trading practices, and its English Perpendicular parish church.

==History==
According to &quot;A Dictionary of British Place Names&quot;, Thaxted derives from the Old English &quot;thoec&quot; or &quot;þæc&quot; combined with &quot;stede&quot;, being a &quot;place where thatching materials are got&quot;. In the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book,&quot; the settlement is referred to as &#x27;Tachesteda&#x27; and in subsequent official records variously as &quot;&quot;Thacstede&quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;Thaxstede&quot;, &quot;Thackestede&quot; and &quot;Thakstede&quot;, amongst other spellings. As late as the nineteenth century, the spelling &quot;Thackstead&quot;&quot; was still in use.

Thaxted developed as a Saxon settlement on a Roman road. There was a Roman villa to the east of the current town and Roman artefacts have been discovered in the area. The British Museum holds a Roman bronze head of Bacchus found at Thaxted in the nineteenth century. The first documented record of Thaxted, including a church, is in the Liber Eliensis, describes a gift of land in &quot;Thacstede&quot; by a woman named Æthelgifu at some time between 881 and 1016.

Archeological research of the area by Oxford Archaeology in 2007 produced finds showing Bronze Age, late Iron Age, Roman, late medieval and post-medieval occupation, including flint fragments, floor and roof tiles, pottery sherds, ditch enclosures, graves, and skeletal remains. A further archeological excavation in the centre of the town by the Colchester Archeological Trust in 2015 found a large medieval ditch which may have been a part of the town&#x27;s defences, 15th- to 16th-century artifacts, and fragments of animal bone waste, mainly from cattle.

In the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, the settlement, in the Hundred of Dunmow, consisted of 108 households with a population of 54 villagers, 34 smallholders, 16 slaves, and 4 freemen. The land supported 28.5 plough teams—being seven lord&#x27;s teams and 21.5 men&#x27;s teams—and contained two mills, meadow of , and woodland with 850 pigs. In 1066 there were four cobs, 36 cattle, an additional 128 pigs, 200 sheep, and 10 beehives. The sheep had increased to 320, and the beehives to 16, by 1086. In 1066 the lord was Wihtgar, son of Aelfric, who was lord or overlord of 27 other manors, chiefly in west Essex. After 1086 the lordship of Thaxted was given in part to Warner, and to Richard fitz Gilbert—son to Gilbert, Count of Brionne—who was also Tenant-in-chief to the king.

During the Middle Ages, Thaxted prospered as a centre for the production of cutlery. This association is recalled by the town&#x27;s well-known guildhall, by the which consists of two crossed swords, and in the name of the nearby hamlet of Cutlers Green. Why a town like Thaxted, lacking in the natural resources required for the large-scale manufacturing metal products, should have developed this industry is unclear. Although it had been assumed that Thaxted&#x27;s cutlers were finishing blades made elsewhere, excavations undertaken in 2015 in Orange Street found evidence to support the work of bladesmiths alongside cutlers/hafters.

The cutlers seem to have been already well-established by the beginning of the fourteenth century: in 1310, a cutler named Adam de Thakstede had prospered enough to purchase the freedom of the City of London and set up business in Cheapside. A manuscript in the Bodleian Library indicates that Thaxted was already widely identified with its cutlery by the 1320s. The 1381 Poll Tax returns indicate 79 cutlers established in Thaxted, alongside other related trades such as smiths and sheathers.

This artisanal development had an effect on the economic and social dynamics of the town, shifting from a feudal agricultural model, in which most people were dependent on and laboured for the lord of the manor, to an urban industrial model where many people were employed and more autonomous. The right to hold a market was granted in 1205. Sometime during the first half of the fourteenth century, certain town inhabitants acquired the status of burgesses (&quot;burgenses)&quot; living within an area of the town known as the borough (&quot;burgus&quot;), achieving some degree of freedom from obligations toward the manor.

However, this independence &quot;did not extend to any real measure of self-government&quot;. The exact date that Thaxted first acquired formal borough status is unknown but the 1556 charter states that Thaxted &quot;is an ancient borough and had from time immemorial a mayor and other officers and ministers and was endowed with diverse liberties&quot;. Royal documents from the end of the fifteenth century refer to the &quot;manor and borough of Thaxted&quot;. It seems clear however that Thaxted did not achieve self-government as a fully-fledged borough until the granting of the 1556 charter.

A guild of cutlers was established during the reign of Edward III (1327–77), led by a warden. In November 1481, Edward IV, at the behest of his mother, Cecily, who held the manor, issued letters patent to license some residents of Thaxted &quot;to found a fraternity or perpetual gild&quot;, empowered to regulate itself and own land. A deed of foundation of the &quot;fraternity or perpetual guild of St. John the Baptist at Thaxted&quot; dates from 1507. The famous Guildhall is supposed to have been built by the cutlers&#x27; guild. However, it seems there was, at one time, more than one guild in existence in the town – and more than one guild hall: there is some evidence for a guild or fraternity dedicated to the Holy Rood, and the Ordnance Survey map of 1876 shows the site of a guild hall in Vicarage Mead, off Newbiggen Street. An historical account of the town in 1831 states that the &quot;mote hall&quot; [the extant guildhall] was being used as a school and the &quot;guild hall&quot; was the town workhouse.

In 1556, the town took advantage of the fact that the lord of the manor was a minor to request incorporation of the borough, which was granted by Philip and Mary, allowing a town government consisting of a mayor, two bailiffs, twenty-four burgesses, a court, a recorder and two serjeants at law, amongst other officers. The Charter describes the borough as having fallen into &quot;great ruin and decay by reason of great poverty and necessity&quot;; the charter may have signalled an effort to revitalise the fortunes of the town and was reconfirmed by Elizabeth I and James I. However, despite efforts to encourage the development of the wool trade in the town with the creation of a guild of clothiers in 1583, Thaxted&#x27;s fortunes did not return. The charter was extinguished in 1686 after the town was unable to challenge a quo warranto writ by James II.

==Governance==
Thaxted Parish Council consists of 11 elected members who each serve a term of 4 years. The parish council is responsible for managing certain amenities and open spaces, including the Recreation Ground and Sports Pavilion, the Windmill, Bolford Street Hall, the allotments, the public car parks in Park Street and Margaret Street, the public toilets, Margaret Street Gardens and the green space at Cutlers Green.

Thaxted lies within the Thaxted and the Eastons Ward for Uttlesford District Council which elects two representatives to serve on the district council. Thaxted lies within the Thaxted Division (or super ward) for Essex County Council, which also covers the surrounding villages of Ashdon, Debden, Little Dunmow, the Eastons, Felsted, Hempstead, the Sampfords, Stebbing and Wimbish, and elects one county councillor.

The Thaxted electoral ward had a recorded population of 5,291 at the 2021 census.

Thaxted acquired borough status sometime in the fifteenth century. It was incorporated by charter in 1556 as a borough and &quot;body corporate and politic&quot;, governed by a common council of twenty-four &quot;capital burgesses&quot; including an elected mayor, and seated at the Guildhall The borough status lapsed in 1686, but Thaxted continues to be referred to as a &quot;town&quot; by its inhabitants.

==Demography==
In 1829, there were 2,293 people living in Thaxted; in 1848 there were 2,527. At the time of the 1881 census, that figure had fallen to 1,914, and it fell further by 1921 to 1,596.

In 2001, the population had risen again to 2,526. The 2011 census put the total population of Thaxted at 2,845. By the 2021 census, the figure had risen to 3,116 inhabitants.

== Education ==
Thaxted County Primary School was established in 1878 under the 1870 Education Act. It still occupies the fine Victorian building on the eastern edge of the town built for it in 1880 and is run by Essex County Council.

Thaxted lies within the secondary education catchment area for the Helena Romanes School in Great Dunmow.

There are a number of preschools in the area.

The 1556 Borough Charter provided for setting up a grammar school. This occupied the Guildhall from 1714 until it closed in 1878. A day school, operated by the Church of England, opened in 1819 and was housed in a building funded by Lord Maynard on the Broxted Road. The non-conformists established a rival British School in Bolford Street in 1856. Both schools ceased to operate when the Primary School was established in 1878.

From 1944 to 1962, the Bachad Farm Institute, located on a farm at Bardfield End Green, provided agricultural training to young Jewish refugees, including many from the Kindertransport, as part of a network of hakhshara youth training farms.

== Amenities ==
Thaxted Public Library is operated by Essex County Council and located in Town Street. A Community and Tourist Information Office is located within the Library, staffed by volunteers.

There are a number of venues for meetings in the town. The Guildhall is sometimes used for events, meetings and exhibitions. Bolford Street Hall, formerly the British School built in 1849, is maintained by the parish council. Thaxted Church Hall in Margaret Street in maintained by the Thaxted Church Hall Trust together with the parish church.

Thaxted Parish Council maintains public parks and open spaces, including the Margaret Street Garden, the Recreation Ground and Sports Pavilion, Walnut Tree Meadow in Copthall Lane, and the greens at Cutlers Green and Bardfield End Green. The latter is the location of the cricket ground. There are numerous public footpaths offering walks and hiking opportunities; the Harcamlow Way long-distance trail passes through the town.

Thaxted Surgery, situated in Margaret Street, provides general practice healthcare to the community. The Thaxted Centre for the Disabled, founded in 1963 and situated on Dunmow Road, supports persons with physical disabilities through volunteers and community fundraising.

Essex County Fire and Rescue Service maintains an on-call fire station in Thaxted, with locally based firefighters on standby to respond to incidents.

==Culture and community==

Between 2007 and 2009, a village design statement was produced for Thaxted to describe the character of the town and parish and to inform any future development. It was drawn up after consultation with local residents and under the auspices of Thaxted Parish Council and the Thaxted Society, and was published after further consultation with the rural community council and Uttlesford District Council.

The Thaxted Society is a conservation charity founded in 1963 to safeguard and promote Thaxted&#x27;s legacy. It publishes the &quot;Thaxted Bulletin&quot; twice a year, with the 100th edition appearing in winter 2017. The society&#x27;s remit is to scrutinise and respond to local planning and Government planning regulation and policy.

The annual Thaxted Festival takes place over four weekends in June and July every year, presenting a programme of musical concerts.

Thaxted Cricket Club represents the town and parish. The club&#x27;s teams play in the Herts &amp; Essex Border League, play Sunday Friendlies, and in under-12 and under-15 competitions.

Thaxted&#x27;s football club, Thaxted Rangers, was formed in 1998 and has a senior team and youth teams.

Thaxted Bowling Club was founded in 1965 and has a green and clubhouse off Park Street.

Thaxted Tennis Club operates from tennis courts situated on Dunmow Road at the southern entrance to the town.

Thaxted Morris Men is a morris side, which was founded in 1911 under the instigation of Conrad Noel, Vicar of Thaxted, as a response to a renewed interest in morris dancing. The side (team) performed locally as part of coronation celebrations for George V.

Since 2001, Thaxted has been twinned with Saint-Vrain in the French department of Essonne. A twinning association aims to promote friendship and cultural understanding and to foster the relationship between the two towns and their people.

According to a local vicar, in local Essex dialect the word &quot;thaxted&quot; meant &quot;sharp, clever&quot; – an apparent reference to the former cutlery industry.

==Transport==

Thaxted once lay on the busy A130 trunk road from Chelmsford to Cambridge which brought large trucks through the centre of the town past the Guildhall and Church. In the 1980s, this route was downgraded to become the B184 road following completion of the M11 motorway and the A120 dual carriageway. Ordnance Survey maps show a Roman road running north to south through Thaxted.

Thaxted is connected to the local towns and villages, as well as to Stansted Airport, by local bus services, operated by Stephensons of Essex. Uttlesford District Council runs a community travel service for residents who have difficulty using public transport.

From 1913 to 1952, Thaxted was served by a light railway branch line from Elsenham which ran to a terminus station located about one mile south of the town. The line, the Elsenham &amp; Thaxted Light Railway, was known to locals as the &quot;Gin and Toffee&quot; line because the main investors where a local sweet factory owner and a distillery magnate. Passenger traffic ceased on 15 September 1952 and the line closed definitively on 1 June 1953.

Between 1916 and 1919, Thaxted hosted a Home Defence aircraft landing ground. The unit was equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory BE2 and BE12 variants fighters of No. 75 Squadron until the summer of 1918, and thereafter with Avro 504Ks and Bristol F2bs. The site was decommissioned at the end of the First World War in 1919. The landing ground was located north of Bardfield End Green.

==Landmarks and notable buildings==

Thaxted Parish Church is a fine example of English Perpendicular church architecture built between 1340 and 1510 and a testament to the prosperity of the town in the Middle Ages. It is one of the largest churches in Essex, 183 feet long and 87 feet wide with a spire reaching 181 feet and is dedicated to St John the Baptist with Our Lady and St Laurence.

Thaxted Guildhall is a Grade I listed timber-framed medieval moot hall in the main high street. It was built in the late 15th century, supposedly with funding from the significant cutlery industry, hence the assumption that it served the cutlers&#x27; guild.

John Webb&#x27;s Windmill is a restored brick tower mill, built in 1810, standing to the south of the church. The view of the windmill from the Bullring, framed by the almshouses, is a classic Essex postcard view. The Almshouses consist of the thatched Chantry House and the tiled Almshouses building of 1714, the latter still in use providing accommodation for elderly people.

Horham Hall is a Grade I listed mansion to the south-east of the town of Thaxted. It was built in brick by Sir John Cutte between 1510 and 1515, on the site of a timber-framed late– moated manor house.

Clarence House is a Grade I listed Queen Anne townhouse in Watling Street, opposite the church. It was built in 1715 and retains many original features. Its garden wall is Grade I listed separately.

Dick Turpin&#x27;s Cottage is one of a group of timber-framed terrace houses in picturesque Stoney Lane, but there is no evidence to support its association with the famous highwayman. It, along with Nos. 2 and 4 either side, are Grade I listed buildings.

On the south side of Town Street, the former Recorder&#x27;s House – named because it was once the home of the first Recorder under the 1556 Charter, Serjeant Bendlowes – has carvings beneath the windows including the arms of Edward IV. It is Grade II* listed.

== Thaxted and music ==

In the twentieth century, Thaxted developed a musical tradition that can be traced back to the influence of the composer, Gustav Holst, and Conrad Noel, the vicar of Thaxted.

In 1913, while on a walking holiday, Holst discovered the town and remained associated with it for the rest of his life. Encouraged by the vicar, Conrad Noel, a medievalist and folk-dancing and church music enthusiast, Holst had the idea of organizing a Whitsun festival there, bringing singers and players from St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School and Morley College in London to join with local people in a weekend of musical festivities. In 1916, once he had finished The Planets, he devoted time to writing and arranging music especially for Thaxted. The carols &quot;Bring us in good ale&quot; (dedicated to Conrad Noel), &quot;Lullay my liking&quot;, &quot;Of one that is so fair and bright&quot; and &quot;Terly, terlow&quot; were specifically written for Thaxted. His most outstanding achievement was &quot;This have I done for my true love&quot; (also dedicated to Noel), &quot;an evocation of the medieval notion of dancing and religious worship being closely intertwined&quot;. Holst&#x27;s daughter, Imogen Holst, a composer in her own right, also maintained links with the town.

Although the Whitsun Festival was discontinued in 1918, the idea was revived in 1980 and flourishes as the Thaxted Festival.

Thaxted is the name given to a hymn tune, a setting for &quot;I Vow to Thee, My Country&quot;, which Holst composed, based on the theme of &quot;Jupiter&quot; in his orchestral Planets suite. Holst wrote the Planets whilst living in a cottage in Monks Street outside Thaxted.

== Thaxted and Morris dancing ==
The Thaxted Morris Men were formed in 1911 as part of the Morris dancing revival underway in the first half of the twentieth century. The Thaxted Morris is now the oldest revival side in the country.

During the Great War, many active Morris men were killed, and the Morris was predominantly women. By the 1930s, men predominated again. In 1934, the year that Holst died, the Cambridge Morris Men invited five other teams (Letchworth, Thaxted, East Surrey, Greensleeves and Oxford) to join them in the formation of a national organisation. Five of the six teams met at Thaxted on 11 May 1934 to inaugurate The Morris Ring.

The Ring, which has grown to around 180 sides, organises regular meetings. The annual Thaxted Morris Weekend, which takes place on the Spring Bank Holiday weekend, welcomes sides from all over the United Kingdom and the world. The weekend consists of a series of dancing tours, in which teams dance in the villages surrounding Thaxted, before reconvening in the town. The final dance of the evening is always the evocative Abbots Bromley Horn Dance, performed by the host side from Thaxted, winding their way from the churchyard, down Stoney Lane and past the Guildhall, accompanied by a solitary fiddler. The Morris Weekend is a major tourist attraction pulling visitors to the town each year.

==Thaxted in film==
The town and surrounding countryside feature in the documentary film &quot;Ripe Earth&quot;, directed and produced by the Boulting Brothers in 1938. The ten-minute film depicts the gathering of the harvest in Rails Farm and the harvest festival celebration in the church, including Conrad Noel at the altar.

The town was used as the location for the 1952 British comedy film &quot;Time Gentlemen, Please!&quot; The film was directed by Lewis Gilbert, starred Eddie Byrne, and also featured Dora Bryan and Sid James.

Part of Passolini&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales (I racconti di Canterbury)&quot; was filmed in Thaxted: the unrestored Windmill, with the church spire in the distance, formed the backdrop to the scene depicting the Summoner, the Devil and the Old Woman in The Friar&#x27;s Tale, somewhat anachronistically since the tower mill is a nineteenth century structure of the Industrial Revolution that would have been unknown in Chaucerian times.

==Notable people==

*Robert Wydow or Wedow ( – 1505), an English poet, church musician, and religious figure, was born in Thaxted and was vicar of the town from 1481 to 1489. He attended Eton College and King&#x27;s College Cambridge, and is the first known recipient of a Bachelor of Music degree in England, awarded by Oxford University in 1478 or 1479. Wydow&#x27;s contemporaries held him in high esteem as a poet and musician, describing him as &quot;an excellent poet&quot;, and &quot;easily the finest&quot; of Latin authors of the time. However, only a few lines of his poetry survive and none of his music. The surviving brass in the Parish Church is reputed to be his likeness. Wedow Road, in the town, commemorates him.
*Sir John Cutte (d. 1520), Under-Treasurer to Henry VII and Henry VIII, built Horham Hall on the site of an earlier house. His grandson, Sir John Cutte (1545-1615), hosted Queen Elizabeth I in 1571 (nine days) and 1578 (six days).
*Sir John Alleyn or Allen (c.1470-1544), mercer in the City of London, was born in Thaxted. He served two terms as Lord Mayor of London, in 1525 and 1535. His immediate predecessor as Lord Mayor, Sir William Bailey, serving in 1524, was also from Thaxted.
* Samuel Purchas (1577–1626), English cleric and author, was born in the town. His works are an important source of information about the age of exploration. He graduated from St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1600. His most famous work, &quot;&quot; (1625) is a massive compilation of accounts by Elizabethan and Jacobean travellers of their journeys around the world. Yet he noted with some irony that &quot;I, which have written so much of travellers and travels, never travelled 200 miles from Thaxted in Essex where I was borne&quot;.
* Dick Turpin (1705–39), the famous highwayman, was born in nearby Hempstead and was reputed to have run a butcher&#x27;s shop in Thaxted. Contemporary biographies claiming that he was born in Thaxted are erroneous; and there is no evidence to support a connection with the cottage in Stoney Lane that carries his name.
*John Fell (1733–97), Classical scholar and author, lived in Thaxted from 1770 as minister of the Congregationalist chapel. He was friends with Rayner Heckford, a Saxon scholar, whose family owned Clarence House. Whilst in Thaxted, he tutored the young Richard &quot;Conversation&quot; Sharp (1759-1835), who went on to become a famous wit, literary figure and a Member of Parliament.
*Alfred Paget Humphry (1850-1916), barrister, is buried in Thaxted. He bought Horham Hall in 1905 and lived there until his death. He was a renowned champion rifle shooter and wrote &quot;First Hints at Rifle Shooting&quot; (1876).
*Conrad Noel (1869–1942), Christian socialist, was known as the town&#x27;s &#x27;Red Vicar&#x27;, serving in the post from 1910 until his death. He played a key role in the morris dancing revival in the town. He enjoyed the patronage of Daisy, Countess of Warwick, of Easton Lodge.
*Launcelot Alfred Cramner-Byng (1872-1945), sinologist and author, lived at Folly Mill, near Monk Street. He translated many works of Chinese literature.
*Gustav Holst (1874-1934), the British composer of The Planets, lived in The Manse (then called The Steps) in the High Street. His residency is marked by a blue plaque. His daughter, Imogen Holst, also lived in the town in her youth.
*Alec Butler Hunter (1899-1958), textile designer, lived at Market Cross, a fine medieval house next to the Guildhall, from 1944 until his death. He worked for Warner &amp; Sons, the textile manufacturer in nearby Braintree, and was a President of the Society of Industrial Artists. He was an active supporter of Morris dancing revival and the first Squire of the Morris Ring. The Alec Hunter Academy in Braintree is named after him.
*Sir George Binney (1900– 72), Arctic explorer, lived at Horham Hall from 1946 to 1969.
*W. E. Shewell-Cooper (1900–82), gardener and pioneer of organic gardening, lived and worked at Prior&#x27;s Hall, outside the town, from 1948 to 1960, where he ran a training college promoting organic horticulture.
*Alan Rawsthorne (1904-1971), English composer, and his wife Isabel Rawsthorne (née Nicholas) (1912-1992), English painter and scenery designer, are both buried in Thaxted churchyard. They lived in a cottage in the neighbouring village of Little Sampford. 
*Isabel Alexander (1910-1996), artist and illustrator, lived in Thaxted between 1949-1964 while working at Saffron Walden Teacher Training College. Some of her works depict Thaxted and the surrounding landscape.
*Donald Hall (1928-2018), American poet and writer, spent a year in Thaxted between 1959 and 1960, during which time he wrote his collection of poems, &quot;A Roof of Tiger Lilies,&quot; and his short story collection, &quot;A String Too Short To Be Saved&quot;. His poem, &quot;An American in an Essex Village,&quot; describes a walk around the town at that time, including the church and the then derelict windmill whose &quot;ruin appals only an eye which invents a landscape which needs it.&quot;
*Evelyn Anthony (Evelyn Bridgett Patricia Ward-Thomas) (1926-2018), novelist, lived at Horham Hall from 1968 to 1976 and again from 1982 to her death. Her most successful novel was &quot;The Tamarind Seed,&quot; which was made into a feature film.
*Diana Wynne Jones, author of &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; and other novels, was raised in the town.
*Genista McIntosh, Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall, the Labour life peer, lived in Thaxted from 2002 to 2015. She spoke in praise of Thaxted Parish Church in a debate in the House of Lords in 2014.

== Places of worship ==

The Church of Saint John the Baptist with Our Lady and Saint Laurence, the Church of England parish church, is a large English Perpendicular style medieval church which commands the town from the hilltop. The church was, in the twentieth century, the centre of so-called &quot;Thaxted Movement&quot;, which combined High Church Anglo-Catholicism with Christian Socialism. The benefice has since 2017 been joined to the neighbouring parishes of Hempstead, Radwinter and the Sampfords.

In the eighteenth century, Thaxted became a centre for non-conformity when an independent meeting house was established. This became a Congregationalist Chapel at which the minister was John Fell. The United Reformed Church, in Bolford Street, was built in 1876 on the site of the earlier Congregationalist chapel. The Baptist Church, in Park Street, occupies a Georgian building dating from 1832. There was once also a Quaker meeting house at Mill End: the building was later incorporated into the sweet factory and still exists. The Exclusive Brethren established a meeting house in the Tanyard in the 1940s.

In 1942, a Roman Catholic Church, dedicated to the English Martyrs, was built in Park Street. With the building recently condemned, the congregation are currently making use of the Lady Chapel in the Anglican parish church.

== Industry and commerce ==
The prosperity of Thaxted was once built on the cutlery and wool trades but by the seventeenth century these had wained. By the nineteenth century, Thaxted was a depressed agricultural backwater. In 1870, George Lee opened a sweet factory in the town, which rapidly became the major employer. It saved Thaxted, became a major employer and led to the advent the light railway, with the support of the gin magnate, Sir Walter Gilbey. Because the railway was promoted by a gin distiller and a confectioner, it was known by the locals as &quot;The Gin and Toffee Line&quot;. The sweet factory closed in 1969 and its site, at the eastern entrance to the town, was used by a tea packing company and, from 1976 to 2013, by a pharmaceutical company. It has since been redeveloped for residential use.

Cedric Arnold, a pipe organ maker, had a workshop at Mill End for many years. He built one of the organs in the parish church. The business was eventually subsumed by Messrs. Hill, Norman &amp; Beard Ltd. and relocated away from Thaxted. Another light industry that came and went was the wiremaker, Cowell &amp; Cooper, which opened in 1946 but moved to Haverhill in 2009.

Agriculture remains an important part of the local economy.

The town maintains a modest selection of shops, including a supermarket, a post office, a long-established hardware shop and a bakery, as well as a petrol station. When Thaxted was a borough, it acquired the right to hold a weekly market on Fridays. Although this lapsed, the market was revived in the 1990s and continues to be held most Fridays in Town Street. Since 2008, the market has been administered by the Parish Office.

Thaxted once possessed a copious number of public houses, but many have been lost. &quot;The Fox and Hounds&quot; on the northern entrance of the town is now a care home. &quot;The Bull&quot; in Newbiggen Street has become a private house, as has &quot;The Cock Inn&quot; in Watling Street. &quot;The Saracen&#x27;s Head&quot; stood on the site now occupied by Saracen&#x27;s Filling Station in the southern entrance to the town. Lowe&#x27;s hardware shop in Town Street was once &quot;The Duke&#x27;s Head&quot;, a coaching inn. Bell Lane gets its name from &quot;The Bell&quot;, which occupied the house on the corner with Watling Street that was subsequently the post office and is now an Indian restaurant. The &quot;Butchers Arms&quot; at Bardfield End Green, which once sustained the cricket club, has also closed.

Three public houses remain in the town itself: the &quot;Swan Hotel&quot;, opposite the Church, is an historic coaching inn in a Grade II listed building; the &quot;Star&quot;, in Mill End, occupies a Grade II listed hall house from the fourteenth century; The &quot;Maypole&quot;, formerly the &quot;Rose &amp; Crown,&quot; is at the top of Mill End opposite the petrol station. Outside the town is the &quot;Farmhouse Inn&quot;, formerly the &quot;Greyhound&quot;, a fifteenth-century hall house in the hamlet of Monk Street, on the road to Dunmow.

<text>Viroconium or Uriconium, formally Viroconium Cornoviorum, was a Roman city, one corner of which is now occupied by Wroxeter, a small village in Shropshire, England, about east-south-east of Shrewsbury. At its peak, Viroconium is estimated to have been the 4th-largest Roman settlement in Britain, a &quot;civitas&quot; with a population of more than 15,000. The settlement probably lasted until the end of the 7th century or the beginning of the 8th. Extensive remains can still be seen.

==Toponym==
&quot;Viroconium&quot; is a Latinised form of a toponym that was reconstructed as Common Brittonic &quot;*Uiroconion&quot; (&quot;[city] of &quot;*Uirokū&quot;&quot;. &quot;*Uirokū&quot; ( &quot;man-wolf&quot;) is believed to have been a masculine given name meaning &quot;werewolf&quot;.

The original capital of the local British tribe of the Cornovii was the impressive hillfort on the Wrekin known as *Uiroconion. When the Cornovii were eventually subdued by the Romans, their capital was moved to Wroxeter and given its Roman name. Hence the term &quot;Cornoviorum&quot; distinguishes the site as the Viroconium &quot;of the Cornovii&quot;, the Celtic tribe whose settlement became &quot;civitas&quot;.

The city is mentioned by Roman historians Ptolemy, Suetonius, and others.

==History==

===Roman===
Wroxeter was first established in the early years of the Roman conquest of Britain as a frontier post for a cohort of Thracian Auxilia who were taking part in the campaigns of the governor, Publius Ostorius Scapula. The site is strategically located near the end of Watling Street, the primary Roman trunk road that ran across Britannia from Dubris (Dover). The post was a key frontier position because it defended the River Severn valley as it come out of Cambria (Wales) as well as protecting the route to the south that lead to the Wye valley.

In the mid 1st century Caesar&#x27;s Legio XIV Gemina took over the site from the Thracian Auxilia in preparation for the invasion of Wales and replaced the fort with a much larger legionary fortress. In 78 governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola led campaigns to suppress the tribes in North Wales and the druids on Ynys Môn. In 80 Agricola took Legio XIV Gemina north on his punitive expeditions against the Picts in Scotland. With the departure of Legio XIV Gemina, Legio XX Valeria Victrix took over the fortress.

By the late 80s the fort had ceased to be used by the Roman army after Legio XX Valeria Victrix moved to Deva Victrix. In this period the canabae, or civilian settlement, that had grown up around the legionary fort began turning it into a town. Archaeological research has found that an unfinished legionary bath house in the centre of the town eventually became the town&#x27;s forum. A decade later a civic street grid was subsuming the plan of the old legionary fort.

The colonnaded forum was started in the 120s covering the unfinished bath house, and with the impressive dedicatory inscription to Hadrian found in excavations dating the completion to 130. By then the town had expanded especially under Emperor Hadrian to cover an area of more than . It then had many public buildings, including thermae. Simpler temples and shops have also been excavated. At its peak, Viroconium is estimated to have been one of the richest and the fourth largest Roman settlement in Britain with a population of more than 15,000. Its wealth is surprising for what remained a frontier town and is perhaps explained by its access to Wales and to other trade routes.

Between 165 and 185 the forum burned down, including neighbouring shops and houses, and many shop contents were subsequently found in excavations. The forum was rebuilt with several modifications.

Following the end of Roman rule in Britain around 410, the Cornovii tribe divided into Pengwern (Shropshire) and Powys. This socio-political division started Viroconium&#x27;s decline as an important settlement.

===Early medieval period===

Although Viroconium served as the early sub-Roman capital of Powys, variously identified with the ancient Welsh cities of Cair Urnarc or Cair Guricon which appeared in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;″s list of the 28 &quot;civitates&quot; of Britain, Viroconium became the site of the court of a sub-Roman kingdom known in Old English as the &quot;Wrocensaete&quot;, which was the successor territorial unit to Cornovia. &quot;Wrocensaete&quot; means the &#x27;inhabitants of Wroxeter&#x27;.

The Wroxeter Stone or Cunorix Stone, was found in 1967, with an inscription in an Insular Celtic language, identified by the Celtic Inscribed Stones Project (CISP) at UCL as &quot;partly-Latinized Primitive Irish&quot;. The inscription, probably on a re-used gravestone, is dated to 460-475 AD, when Irish raiders had begun to make permanent settlements in South Wales and south-western Britain.

Town life in Viroconium continued in the fifth century, but many of the buildings fell into disrepair. Between 530 and 570, when most Roman urban sites and villas in Britain were being abandoned, there was a substantial rebuilding programme. The old basilica was carefully demolished and replaced with new timber-framed buildings on rubble platforms. These probably included a very large two-storey building and a number of storage buildings and houses. In all, 33 new buildings were &quot;carefully planned and executed&quot; and &quot;skillfully constructed to Roman measurements using a trained labour force&quot;. Who instigated this rebuilding programme is not known, but it may have been a bishop. Some of the buildings were renewed three times, and the community probably lasted about 75 years until, for some reason, many of the buildings were dismantled.

There is a tradition that Shrewsbury was &quot;founded in the 5th century, on occasion of the decay of the Roman Uriconium.&quot; The historian, John Wacher, suggests that Shrewsbury may have been refortified by refugees fleeing an outbreak of a plague in Viroconium around this time.

The site was probably abandoned peacefully in the second half of the seventh century or the beginning of the eighth. The later minor Wreocensæte sub-kingdom of the Angles emerged in the area when Oswiu conquered Pengwern in 656. Eventually the court of the Kingdom of Powys moved to Mathrafal sometime before 717 following famine and plague in its original location.

==Preservation==

Although archaeologist Philip A. Barker believed stonework from Viroconium Cornoviorum was used to build the nearby parish churches of Atcham, Wroxeter, and Upton Magna, some substantial remains are still standing. These include &quot;the Old Work&quot; (an archway, part of the baths&#x27; &quot;frigidarium&quot; and the largest free-standing Roman ruin in England) and the remains of a baths complex. These are on display to the public and, along with a small museum, are looked after by English Heritage under the name &quot;Wroxeter Roman City&quot;. Some of the more important finds are housed in the Music Hall Museum in Shrewsbury. Most of the town still remains buried, but it has largely been mapped through geophysical survey and aerial archaeology.

Archaeological research of the site is ongoing with further buildings being excavated.

===Reconstructed villa===

In February 2011 a reconstructed Roman villa was opened to the public to give visitors an insight into Roman building techniques and how the Romans lived. A Channel 4 television series entitled &quot;Rome Wasn&#x27;t Built in a Day&quot; showed how it was built using authentic ancient techniques. The builders were assisted by a team of local volunteers and supervised by archaeologist Dai Morgan Evans, who designed the villa.

<text>In group theory, 
the Tits group 2&quot;F&quot;4(2)′, named for Jacques Tits (), is a finite simple group of order
:   17,971,200 = 211 · 33 · 52 · 13.

This is the only simple group that is a derivative of a group of Lie type that is not a group of Lie type in any series from exceptional isomorphisms. It is sometimes considered a 27th sporadic group.

==History and properties==
The Ree groups 2&quot;F&quot;4(22&quot;n&quot;+1) were constructed by , who showed that they are simple if &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1. The first member 2&quot;F&quot;4(2) of this series is not simple. It was studied by who showed that it is almost simple, its derived subgroup 2&quot;F&quot;4(2)′ of index 2 being a new simple group, now called the Tits group. The group 2&quot;F&quot;4(2) is a group of Lie type and has a BN pair, but the Tits group itself does not have a BN pair. The Tits group is member of the infinite family 2&quot;F&quot;4(22&quot;n&quot;+1)′ of commutator groups of the Ree groups, and thus by definition not sporadic. But because it is also not strictly a group of Lie type, it is sometimes regarded as a 27th sporadic group.

The Schur multiplier of the Tits group is trivial and its outer automorphism group has order 2, with the full automorphism group being the group 2&quot;F&quot;4(2).

The Tits group occurs as a maximal subgroup of the Fischer group Fi22. The group 2&quot;F&quot;4(2) also occurs as a maximal subgroup of the Rudvalis group, as the point stabilizer of the rank-3 permutation action on 4060 = 1 + 1755 + 2304 points.

The Tits group is one of the simple N-groups, and was overlooked in John G. Thompson&#x27;s first announcement of the classification of simple &quot;N&quot;-groups, as it had not been discovered at the time. It is also one of the thin finite groups.

The Tits group was characterized in various ways by and .

==Maximal subgroups==

 and independently found the 8 classes of maximal subgroups of the Tits group as follows:

==Presentation==
The Tits group can be defined in terms of generators and relations by

:formula_1

where [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] is the commutator &quot;a&quot;−1&quot;b&quot;−1&quot;ab&quot;. It has an outer automorphism obtained by sending (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) to (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;(&quot;ba&quot;)5&quot;b&quot;(&quot;ba&quot;)5).

<doc id="606721" wikidata="Q176314" url="?curid=606721" title="Denis Potvin">
<text>Denis Charles Potvin (born October 29, 1953) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman and team captain for the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL). He is a four-time Stanley Cup winner as a member of the early 1980s New York Islanders. Potvin is also a three-time James Norris Memorial Trophy winner as the NHL&#x27;s top defenceman. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1991 and served as a commentator for Ottawa Senators&#x27; television broadcasts on Sportsnet. Potvin is the former color commentator for the Florida Panthers. In 2017, he was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history.

==Biography==
===Playing career===
After a stellar junior hockey career with the Ottawa 67s, Potvin was drafted first overall in the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft by the struggling expansion New York Islanders. This team had recorded the worst record in modern NHL history the previous season. Right after Bill Torrey drafted Potvin, Montreal Canadiens general manager Sam Pollock approached Torrey, hoping to trade for Potvin. Pollock&#x27;s strategy was to offer a &quot;quick-fix&quot; package of mature players to exchange for the top draft pick. Torrey ultimately turned down the offer since he felt Potvin would be a long-term asset to his team.

Upon joining the Islanders, Potvin wanted to wear number 7 on his uniform but was forced to take number 5, as forward Germain Gagnon was wearing number 7. Potvin entered the NHL with high expectations; some regarded him as the savior of the Islanders&#x27; franchise, and by others as potentially the next Bobby Orr. While he did not dominate the game in the same way as Orr, Potvin became an immediate star: He won the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year in 1973–74 and the James Norris Memorial Trophy as league&#x27;s top defenceman in 1975–76 ending Orr&#x27;s eight-year reign. At age 22, Potvin scored 31 goals and 98 points, the highest totals by a defenceman other than Orr. That year he finished second to Bobby Clarke in the voting for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player.

Upon Orr&#x27;s decline and retirement in the late 1970s, Potvin became widely acknowledged (along with Larry Robinson) as the premier defenceman in the game. He also won the Norris Trophy in 1977–78 and 1978–79. The latter was his best offensive season, when he scored 31 goals and 70 assists in only 73 games, becoming the second defenceman (Orr being the first) to score 100 points in a season. He had an impressive +71 plus-minus rating that season and finished fourth in the balloting for the Hart Trophy. Between 1974–75 and 1980–81, Potvin was named to the NHL&#x27;s first all-star team five times and the second all-star team once; the only season he missed the all-star teams was 1979–80, when he was only able to play 31 games due to injury.

In Potvin&#x27;s best season, 1978–79, the talented but young Islanders ultimately lost in the semi-finals of the 1979 Stanley Cup playoffs to the New York Rangers in six games, despite being heavily favoured to win the series. Clark Gillies stepped down as captain during the off-season and Potvin became the team&#x27;s third captain, a position he held until relinquishing it in 1987. In 1979–80, Potvin&#x27;s first year as captain, the Islanders won their first of four Stanley Cups. Potvin was a key part of the Islanders during the team&#x27;s early 1980s glory years: in addition to the four consecutive Stanley Cup championships and five straight finals appearances, in the eight seasons he served as captain, the Islanders never failed to reach the Stanley Cup playoffs. Potvin was very productive offensively in the playoffs, with his best year being 1980–81 when he scored 8 goals and 17 assists for 25 points in 18 games. However, he was never able to win the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff&#x27;s most valuable player. In the 1983–84 season, Potvin made a comeback of sorts, scoring 85 points and making the NHL&#x27;s second all-star team.

Potvin was known for being intelligent, articulate, and outspoken off the ice. Throughout the 1970s, these traits often alienated his Islander teammates, as they made Potvin appear arrogant. He offended many hockey fans by stating publicly he had played better in the 1976 Canada Cup than Bobby Orr, and that Orr&#x27;s selection as tournament MVP was for sentimental reasons. However, as Potvin matured, he became seen as a great leader as he learned to use these same qualities to positively affect his teammates.

Potvin was a more traditional defender than Orr and an extremely physical player. He averaged just under one point per game over his career (0.992), while Orr averaged 1.39 points per game. Late in his career, Potvin suffered a series of injuries that impeded his performance, leading to his retirement following the 1987–88 season. He retired as the NHL&#x27;s leader in goals and points as a defenceman. His career totals were later surpassed by Ray Bourque, Paul Coffey, and others, and as of 2014, he sits fifth in career goals and seventh in career points amongst defencemen.

Potvin claimed to have received an offer from Mike Keenan to come out of retirement and play for the arch-rival New York Rangers in 1993. Keenan has yet to substantiate these claims. Potvin admitted that although he believed it was a joke, he did contemplate a comeback. After a brief skate, he decided his body could no longer handle the rigours of the game.

===Broadcasting===
Potvin was a studio analyst for SportsChannel America television broadcasts from 1988–92, paired with host Bob Papa. Potvin was a color commentator for Florida Panthers television broadcasts from 1993, paired with play-by-play announcers Jeff Rimer, Dave Strader, and Steve Goldstein for over 16 seasons before being replaced by former Panthers player Bill Lindsay in 2009.

In September 2010, Potvin was hired as the Ottawa Senators&#x27; television colour commentator, working with Dean Brown on Rogers Sportsnet. In August 2014, he was rehired as colour commentator by the Florida Panthers, working with Steve Goldstein on Fox Sports Florida. As a colour commentator, he is known for his bizarre and inflammatory comments, such as claiming that Daniel and Henrik Sedin &quot;...only use [their] fingers to lick the peanut butter off their bread&quot;. On July 29, 2019, he retired from broadcasting.

==Personal life==
Potvin was born in Vanier, Ontario, but grew up in nearby Hull, Quebec. Potvin&#x27;s brother, Jean Potvin, was also an NHL defenceman and the brothers were teammates for some years with the Islanders. Jean died in 2022. Both were cousins of former NHL player Marc Potvin, who died in 2006.

In 1983, Potvin&#x27;s estranged wife accused him of repeatedly beating her while he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs. She cited this as a reason for the renegotiation of the financial terms of their divorce; the court rejected the renegotiation request. Of the proceedings, Potvin said, &quot;It could have destroyed me, except that it was totally untrue, and the judge saw that.&quot;

<doc id="606724" wikidata="Q1233089" url="?curid=606724" title="Totton and Eling">
<text>Totton and Eling () is a civil parish in Hampshire, England, with a population of 28,970 people. It contains the settlements of Totton, Eling, Calmore, Hounsdown, Rushington and Testwood. It is situated between the eastern edge of the New Forest and the River Test, close to the city of Southampton but outside the city boundary; the town is within the New Forest non-metropolitan district. Surrounding towns and villages include Ashurst, Marchwood, Cadnam and Ower.

==Description==
The areas behind Calmore Industrial Estate by the River Test have been regenerated with lakes for boating, but their main use is for fishing and as a water supply resource.
There is also the Testwood Lakes Centre, with walks along the Test Way running from Totton to Inkpen Beacon in Berkshire, via Romsey in Hampshire.

Eling can be accessed by crossing the railway line which divides the original old village of Totton and the areas of Eling, and Hounsdown. This goes to Brokenford which has some pathways from Totton to the A35 Bypass road at Eling recreation ground, by Bartley Water. The village&#x27;s name is pronounced the same as that of the London town and borough of Ealing.

==History==

===Early history===
Eling&#x27;s attractions include the parish church and Eling Tide Mill Experience. St Mary&#x27;s is a Norman church built on Saxon foundations with registers dating back to 1537. The Eling Tide Mill Experience is Eling Tide Mill, its visitor centre, and the outdoor walks around the mill pond at Bartley Water and the Solent Water shoreline at Goatee Beach. Eling Tide Mill is one of the very few working tide mills in the UK but cannot be equated with the mill listed in the Domesday Book. Hampshire&#x27;s only surviving medieval toll bridge is here, across Bartley Water by the side of the Tide Mill. This has been in use since at least 1418 and still charges users today. The Eling Tide Mill Experience was closed for refurbishment from 2015 and reopened 9 April 2018.

=== 19th century ===
As of 1875, the name of the parish was Eling, despite Totton being the larger settlement. At this time, according to Kelly&#x27;s Directory at the time, the parish was within:

* the Southern division of Hampshire
* the hundred of Redbridge
* New Forest Poor Law Union
* Romsey Petty Sessional Division
* Southampton County court district
* the Diocese of Winchester and Archdeaconry of Winchester
* and the rural deanery of Fordingbridge.

The parish was divided into 16 tithings:

* Bartley-Regis
* Bauldoxfee
* Bistern with Bartley
* Colebury
* Durley
* North Eling
* South Eling
* Langley
* Loperwood
* Marchwood
* Rumbridge
* Tatchbury
* Great Testwood
* Little Testwood
* Wade
* Wigley Ower

It was also divided into five ecclesiastical districts: Eling St Mary, North Eling, Netley, Marchwood and Colbury.

===Recent history===
The original village of Totton can be described as the areas of Totton, Testwood and the Salmon Leap, dissected by the A36 and the A336 and bordered by the River Test. From this, many new developments were made to expand the town. The Calmore estate was built in the early 1970s to the north of the town, and subsequent housing has merged the estate to the town as a whole. Extended housing to the Hounsdown region also occurred during the 1970s, with the construction of the school and the increased housing found there. In the late 1980s and 1990s, more housing was built to the west of the town towards Netley Marsh and along Ringwood Road. These developments, collectively referred to as West Totton, consisted of a new communal area and church and hall as well as huge amounts of new homes.

==Transport==
Totton and Eling is served by the railway at Totton railway station, on the South West Main Line to Southampton, London Waterloo, Bournemouth and Poole, and is run by South Western Railway.

Bus services in the town are run by two main companies. Bluestar operate services to Southampton, Cadnam, Hythe, Dibden and around the town. Salisbury Reds also operate cross county routes between Salisbury and Southampton.

The town has easy access to the nearby M27 motorway, to Salisbury via the A36 Salisbury Road, to Lyndhurst and Southampton via the A35 and to the Waterside region by the A326.

The town also has numerous cycle routes, which started with the suburban cycleway through West Totton, constructed when the estate was built and running from Hounsdown to Calmore Road. This has further been extended to two on-road routes to the centre of Totton from Calmore schools down Water Lane, and down Salisbury Road. In addition, there are several links to the New Forest cycle network at Ashurst and Foxhills.

==Sport==
One of the most successful sporting enterprises of the area has been Totton and Eling Cricket Club. Under its former guise of B.A.T. Sports, it won the Southern Premier League, the highest level of club cricket in the Hampshire area, four times in six seasons between 2001 and 2006. In September 2007 Totton and Eling C.C. became North Gear National 2020 Champions beating Ockbrook &amp; Borrowash in the live televised final on Sky Sports.

Totton also has two local football teams, A.F.C. Totton who play at Testwood Stadium and Totton &amp; Eling F.C. who play at Little Testwood Farm. In 2007, AFC Totton made it to the final of the FA Vase and so had the chance to play in the second competitive match at Wembley Stadium. The club were previously based at a ground in the centre of the town, however moved in 2011 to a new stadium with stand and several training pitches near the outskirts of the town in Calmore. The ground reportedly cost £2.5 million.

Rugby: Tottonians RFC play at water lane. They are an amateur club with 4 adult teams and a thriving mini &amp; junior section. The 1st XV currently play in regional 1 south (level 6). They have won one Hampshire cup whilst playing in the London &amp; South West leagues. Ex players include Italian international David Sisi.

==Schools==
There are two secondary schools and a sixth form college within the parish.
Testwood School is in the north of the town was built in the 1940s, and gained Sports College status in 2004. This resulted in improvement of facilities including building of a synthetic turf pitch and an extension to the sports hall. The Testwood school logo includes the river, the wood and salmon, indicating the nearby River Test and the salmon leap. Testwood hires out its sporting facilities after hours, namely the synthetic turf pitch, which is used frequently by the community. Testwood&#x27;s pupils mainly come from the central Totton and Calmore areas.

Hounsdown School, a Specialist Science College, built in 1963, opened in 1969
is located in the Hounsdown area of the town, south of the A35. It too has experienced expansion in recent years, including the construction of a new sports hall and History Block. The Hounsdown logo is of a stylised, curved triangle. Hounsdown also hires out its sporting facilities after school, namely the swimming pool, which is used frequently by the local community and groups. Hounsdown&#x27;s catchment area covers Hounsdown village, Eling, South and West Totton, and Ashurst. The catchment area of the school also extends into the New Forest, southwest past the village of Lyndhurst and north past the village of Copythorne, stopping just south of West Wellow

The sixth form college, Totton College, opened in 1955 as Totton Grammar School to provide selective education, when grammar schools were phased out it changed status to a 16 - 19 yr old FE college. 

Totton has a split site special educational needs school called Forest Park School, which opened in September 2009, which caters for children from Nursery to Post 16. It&#x27;s an amalgamation of 2 former SEN schools called Forest Edge School, which was located on Lydlynch Road, this is now the site of Forest Park Primary School, which was built around the old school building. The secondary school, called Forest Park Secondary School, was called Salterns school, which is located on Commercial Road. The Primary site has a range of pupils with moderate, severe and profound learning difficulties, whilst the secondary site provides education for children with severe and profound learning difficulties.

==Religion==
The town has a number of churches in the area, the biggest and oldest being St. Mary the Virgin church in Eling. Other Anglican churches in the town include the church of St. Anne in Calmore, the church of St. Matthew in Netley Marsh and the church of St. Winfrid in Testwood. These churches form the Team parish of Totton and are part of the Diocese of Winchester. In addition to these, there is also Testwood Baptist Church and Trinity Church in West Totton (Methodist/URC). Near the town centre, there is St Theresa&#x27;s of the Child Jesus, a Roman Catholic Church.

===St. Mary the Virgin Church===
St Mary the Virgin is the oldest of the churches in the Totton area. Several years ago during the reordering of the church, part of a Celtic cross dating back to the 9th (possibly the 6th) century was found. The site of St Mary&#x27;s has been a place of Christian worship since that date. The church building has Saxon origins.

Today the church stands on the hill looking out over the bay to the container port on the Southampton side of Millbrook.

The church has a modern interior with a light, open effect and the traditional stone, including a Saxon arch.

St Mary the Virgin Church is a part of the Anglican team ministry that covers Totton and Eling with 38,000 people within its area. Historically the mother church to the area, St Mary&#x27;s is now one of four churches in the team ministry along with Calmore, Netley Marsh and Testwood. In 2003 two self-styled &#x27;vampires&#x27; were imprisoned for harassment of the vicar of St Mary&#x27;s and his family.

<doc id="606737" wikidata="Q1866174" url="?curid=606737" title="Chocolate Salty Balls">
<text>&quot;Chocolate Salty Balls (P.S. I Love You)&quot; is a song from the American animated sitcom &quot;South Park&quot;, performed by the character Chef and featured on the soundtrack album &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot;. The song&#x27;s vocals are performed by Isaac Hayes, the voice actor for Chef. The song as it originally appeared was in the 1998 episode &quot;Chef&#x27;s Chocolate Salty Balls&quot;, in which Chef creates a confectionery treat, the eponymous Chocolate Salty Balls. He then begins to sing the lyrics that became the basis for the single.

The song was released as a single on December 14, 1998, and reached 1 on the UK Singles Chart and in Ireland. It also charted in mainland Europe and Australia, becoming a top-10 hit in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway while peaking at No. 14 in Australia. The song was written by &quot;South Park&quot; co-creator Trey Parker and produced by Rick Rubin.

==Song information==
The song&#x27;s first and second verses feature Chef listing the ingredients for his &quot;Chocolate Salty Balls&quot;, an innuendo meaning testicles (even though the lyrics throughout refer to the edible food, as mentioned earlier). However, there is no mention of salt in the recipe. He also urges people to &quot;suck on [them]&quot; during the chorus. After listing the ingredients, he sings the lines, &quot;Say, everybody, have you seen my balls / they&#x27;re big and salty and brown / if you ever need a quick pick-me-up / just stick my balls in your mouth&quot;, starting the chorus.

During the song&#x27;s final verse, Chef becomes concerned that his Chocolate Salty Balls have become burned, and urges his lover to blow on them. In particular the lyrics he sings at that point are: &quot;Hey... wait a minute... What&#x27;s that smell? It smells like something&#x27;s burnin&#x27;. Well, that don&#x27;t confront me none, as long as I get my rent paid on Friday. Baby, you better get back in the kitchen... &#x27;cause I&#x27;ve got a sneakin&#x27; suspicion. Oh, man baby... Baby! You just burned my balls!&quot; The verse features a line from the song &quot;One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer&quot;.

A rare alternate radio version of the song removes the &quot;I&#x27;m Chef&quot; intro, the musical outro and subsequent audience cheer found in the &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot; version making it sound more like a traditional studio recording. Most noticeably, it contains an alternate final verse where Chef is serenading the listener while his chocolate salty balls are baking in the oven replacing the entire comedic &quot;You just burned my balls!&quot; verse/skit found in the original album version. A saxophone solo and a slightly altered ending chorus (before the song fades to end) were also added. This version can be found on the UK compilation album &quot;New Hits 99&quot;.

The song was included on the fourth episode of series two of &quot;Cold Feet&quot;. Hayes also performed the song live at the 2002 Glastonbury Festival.

==Chart performance==
&quot;Chocolate Salty Balls (P.S. I Love You)&quot; reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was a contender for the Christmas No. 1 single in the UK but debuted at No. 2, behind the Spice Girls&#x27; &quot;Goodbye&quot;, missing out on the top spot by 8,000 copies and garnering the most weekly sales for a song at No. 2 since Wham!&#x27;s &quot;Last Christmas&quot; in 1984. The following week, the track dethroned &quot;Goodbye&quot;, giving Isaac Hayes his first and only number-one hit in the UK. The song became the seventh-best-selling single of 1998 in the UK. &quot;Chocolate Salty Balls&quot; was also a top-20 hit in Australia, peaking at No. 14 in February 1999.

==Music video==
The song&#x27;s music video features various clips from season one and season two of &quot;South Park&quot;. It can be found on the South Park DVD &quot;South Park: The Chef Experience&quot;.

<doc id="606741" wikidata="Q5308405" url="?curid=606741" title="Grandview Triangle">
<text>The 3-Trails Crossing Memorial Highway is the official name for an interchange in south Kansas City, Missouri that was once considered one of Missouri&#x27;s most congested locations. Although it is known as the Grandview Triangle, it is not located in Grandview, a suburb of Kansas City. It is actually north of Grandview, still within the city limits of Kansas City. After several years of reconstruction, the interchange itself is largely congestion free during non-peak hours despite the high traffic on the highways approaching the interchange. During rush-hour moderate to major delays and numerous accidents are reported.

The name &quot;Three Trails Crossing&quot; refers to the Santa Fe, Oregon, and California Trails that cross there. It is a major interchange of five major highways in the Kansas City area: I-49, I-435, I-470, US 50, US 71, and Missouri State Highway W.

I-49/US 71 brings in traffic from the southeastern suburbs of the Kansas City area in Jackson and Cass counties. I-49 currently ends at the triangle, but the road continues northwest into Kansas City as US 71. The I-49 designation went into effect in December 2012.

I-435 is a beltway around the Kansas City metropolitan area.

I-470 is a major traffic corridor that connects southern Kansas City to the suburbs of eastern Jackson County, mainly Lee&#x27;s Summit.

US 50 travels concurrently with I-435 entering the Triangle, and then travels concurrently with I-470 at Exit 71A.

State Highway W, also known as Bannister Road, which forms the northern leg of the triangle, is a major east-west arterial thoroughfare through southern Kansas City, and also serves as a detour for traffic seeking an alternate route when I-435 is congested.

The 3-Trails Crossing currently handles approximately 250,000 vehicles per day. Now that the reconstruction is completed, the interchange should be able to accommodate more than 400,000 vehicles per day.

<doc id="606746" wikidata="Q387322" url="?curid=606746" title="Centennial, Colorado">
<text>Centennial is a home rule municipality located in Arapahoe County, Colorado, United States. The city population was 108,418 at the 2020 United States Census, making Centennial the 11th most populous municipality in Colorado. Centennial is a part of the Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Front Range Urban Corridor.

==History==
Centennial was formed on February 7, 2001, from portions of unincorporated Arapahoe County, including the former Castlewood and Southglenn census-designated places (CDPs). The citizens of the area had voted to incorporate on September 12, 2000, choosing Centennial as the official name during the vote. The name reflects Colorado&#x27;s admission to the Union as the 38th state in 1876, the centennial year of the United States Declaration of Independence. The state of Colorado is nicknamed the &quot;Centennial State&quot;.

Incorporation was approved by 77% of the voters, and the population of the area at over 100,000 made it the largest incorporation in U.S. history as of its creation. The city was incorporated in large part to prevent further annexations of unincorporated areas by the city of Greenwood Village in an attempt to improve its tax base. The taxes generated from businesses in unincorporated portions of Arapahoe County funded the majority of the county&#x27;s services, including road work. A number of court cases eventually established the right of incorporation to take precedence over the right of annexation.

The city was incorporated on a promise to keep city taxes at 1%. (One of the campaigns against incorporation appealed to voters to maintain the 3.8% sales tax of the unincorporated county.) According to the Centennial website, the current sales tax rate is two-and-a-half times the promised rate, at 2.5%.

In 2008, Centennial voters approved a referendum by approximately a 2-to-1 margin making Centennial a home rule city.

Centennial Airport, formerly Arapahoe County Airport, lies adjacent to Centennial, but is located in unincorporated Arapahoe County. The airport is not named after the city, as it predates the city by over 30 years.

==Geography==
Centennial is roughly divided in half by Interstate 25, with most of its business and entertainment centers lying west of the highway. The city&#x27;s boundaries are highly irregular and evocative of a gerrymander, particularly the overwhelmingly residential eastern portions of the city, which appear with Foxfield, portions of Aurora, and unincorporated areas as a distorted checkerboard on the city&#x27;s map.

Centennial has many hills, gullies and ravines, and its open spaces are usually accompanied by recreational trails and parks, including Dry Creek Dam, DeKoevend Park, the High line Canal Trail, Willow Creek Trail, as well as Big Dry Creek and Little Dry Creek Trails. Centennial hosts most native wildlife and is a good reflection of Colorado&#x27;s front range ecosystem. Centennial has seen a boost in coyote populations in recent years, leading to resident education on how to deter coyotes from eating family pets.

Centennial is located at 39°35&#x27;47&quot; North, 104°50&#x27;38&quot; West (39.5963, −104.8439).

At the 2020 United States Census, the city had a total area of including of water.

==Demographics==


The city is approximately composed of 87.4% White, 4.8% Hispanic or Latino, 3.6% Asian, 2.4% African American, 0.4% Native American, and 0.3% from other races.

The median age is 37.2 years, in comparison to the 35.3-year national average. For every 100 females, there are 98 males.
==Economy==

<doc id="606749" wikidata="Q5653472" url="?curid=606749" title="Har Mar Superstar">
<text>Sean Tillmann-Hauser (born February 6, 1978) is an American singer-songwriter and actor. He has performed and released studio albums as [[Sean Na Na]] and as a member of hardcore band [[Calvin Krime]], but is best known for his work under the name Har Mar Superstar.

==Early life==
Tillmann was born in Marshall, Minnesota, on February 6, 1978, at Weiner Memorial Hospital. In 1987, his family moved to Owatonna, Minnesota. He graduated from the Perpich Center for Arts Education in Golden Valley, Minnesota. His family is still based in Owatonna, where his mother and father are retired educators.

== Career ==
Tillmann is known in the U.S. independent music community as a singer-songwriter. He is best known by his alter ego Har Mar Superstar, a character whose sweaty, energetic live performances were once infamous for often concluding with a perspiring, de-layered Tillmann disrobed down to a pair of briefs. His primary musical genres are contemporary R&amp;B and pop music.

He originally claimed to be Sean Tillmann&#x27;s twin brother, Harold Martin Tillmann, from which he claimed his name originated. The name actually comes from the Har Mar Mall, a shopping center in Roseville, Minnesota.

After playing in a number of garage bands during high school, Tillmann moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota, and joined three-piece noise band Calvin Krime as bassist and lead vocalist. Over three and a half years, it recorded two albums and an EP and regularly toured the country. When Calvin Krime disbanded in 1998, Tillmann explored his softer pop side in Sean Na Na. Reflecting on what led to the creation of Har Mar Superstar, Tillmann said, &quot;I kinda always thought that [I was going to do R&amp;B], I just had to figure out how to do it ... I just had to figure out how to make beats and write songs in that style.&quot; In 2000, he enlisted the help of several Saint Paul musician friends and the result was the pseudonymously self-titled album &quot;Har Mar Superstar&quot; that appeared on Kill Rock Stars in 2001.

Soon, Tillmann was touring all over the U.S. as Har Mar Superstar. Initially, he appeared onstage in a choir robe and was accompanied solely by pre-recorded beats emanating from his MiniDisc player. After his follow-up album, &quot;You Can Feel Me&quot;, elevated Har Mar&#x27;s popularity in the U.S. and put him on the map in the United Kingdom, his stage outfits became more theatrical and several live shows featured female dancers. By the time the third album, &quot;The Handler&quot;, was released in 2004, Har Mar Superstar regularly toured with a drummer and a bassist to fortify the prerecorded material. Shows ranged from club dates to festival engagements (Reading and Leeds Festivals).

In addition to his own headlining tours, Har Mar opened for Ben Lee, The Strokes, Incubus, Tenacious D and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. In 2007, Har Mar supported the Red Hot Chili Peppers on their tour of Australia and New Zealand. Fabrizio Moretti and Tony Bevilacqua have served as Har Mar&#x27;s rhythm section, playing drums and bass guitar respectively. Har Mar supported Sia on her 2008 tour with Denver Dalley on bass and Nick Slack on drums. Other bassists have included Jenni Tarma, Jeff Quinn, and John Fields, while Bert Thomas, Jeff Brown and Michael Bland have manned the drum stool.

As well as a solo artist, Har Mar Superstar is a songwriter. He has written songs for artists including The Cheetah Girls, Jennifer Lopez, Kelly Osbourne, and Ben Adams. After &quot;Tall Boy&quot; was rejected by Britney Spears&#x27;s management, Har Mar recorded the song for his album &quot;Dark Touches.&quot;

In 2008, Har Mar Superstar was part of the live touring set-up of Neon Neon, the band created by Super Furry Animals&#x27; Gruff Rhys and producer/solo artist Boom Bip. Har Mar sings and plays percussion during live shows and is featured on the recorded version and video of &quot;Trick for Treat&quot;, a song on the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Stainless Style&quot;, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2008. Har Mar also performed backing vocals and appeared in the video for Ben Lee&#x27;s &quot;Catch My Disease&quot;.

Har Mar&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Dark Touches&quot;, was released on October 12, 2009, in the U.K. and on October 13 in the U.S. Playing cities throughout the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. in 2009 and 2010, Har Mar&#x27;s &quot;Dark Touches&quot; touring band featured Denver Dalley on guitar, Jeff Quinn on bass, and Will Rockwell-Scott on drums.

In February 2011, Har Mar started recording and performing with the soft rock-inspired band Gayngs and experimental rock group Marijuana Deathsquads. Har Mar and Marijuana Deathsquads teamed up for monthlong residencies in Los Angeles at Spaceland, in New York City at Bowery Electric, and in Austin, Texas.

Har Mar and Father John Misty (a.k.a. Josh Tillman) joined forces for a tour in May 2012. While Sean Tillmann and Josh Tillman are not related, the tour was informally called the &quot;Two Tillman(n)s Tour&quot;. Har Mar performed material from his upcoming soul album &quot;Bye Bye 17&quot;, and his band consisted of Macey Taylor on bass, Quinn on guitar, and J. Tillman on drums.

&quot;Bye Bye 17&quot; was released on April 23, 2013, on Julian Casablancas&#x27;s Cult Records. Tillmann toured the new material throughout the U.S. in March, April and May 2013 with Dalley on bass, Quinn on guitar, and Ryan McMahon on drums. In August and September 2013, Har Mar Superstar supported the Yeah Yeah Yeahs on various tour dates. Har Mar and Lizzo toured the U.S. in September and October. A 14-date tour of the U.K. followed in November. At the end of 2014, Har Mar started writing songs for a new album and toured the U.S. with The Pizza Underground.

Collaborating once again with Casablancas, Tillmann released his sixth Har Mar album, &quot;Best Summer Ever&quot;, on April 15, 2016. Since its inception, &quot;Best Summer Ever&quot; was imagined as a &quot;Greatest Hits of Har Mar Superstar from 1950–1985&quot;, even though Tillmann was born in 1978. Touring the U.S. and Europe in support of the album, Har Mar enlisted six other musicians. Har Mar Superstar&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Roseville&quot;, came together in late 2020 and is the first true collaborative effort of the whole touring band. It was distance recorded by all the members in their home studios and the band&#x27;s home base, Mid City Studio, in Minneapolis. The band is Nelson Devereaux, Jake Baldwin, Adam Hurlburt, Ethan Elseth, Aaron Baum, and Ryan Mach, and everyone had a hand in co-writing. It has been described as an &quot;existential homecoming&quot; that chronicles Tillmann&#x27;s return to life as a Minnesotan.

== Television, film and commercials ==

Tillmann has performed on several U.S. television shows, including &quot;The Sharon Osbourne Show&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, and &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. In the U.K., he has appeared on Channel 4 music programme &quot;Born Sloppy&quot;, &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot;, and &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;. In 2003 and 2014, he was a guest on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;.

Har Mar has been spokesman for Vladivar Vodka, which produced a series of TV commercials that gained an underground cult appreciation for their blatantly sexual content. Har Mar has also been a spokesman for Lynx deodorant in the U.K.

Tillmann has a cameo in the 2004 movie &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; as Dancing Rick, a disco dance champion who faces off in a contest with Ben Stiller&#x27;s character.

Har Mar played a roller derby coach in &quot;Whip It&quot;, a film by Drew Barrymore. He also contributed a cover of The Association&#x27;s &quot;Never My Love&quot; to the film&#x27;s soundtrack, with additional vocals by Adam Green, instrumentation &amp; production by Flowers of Doom (Josiah Steinbrick &amp; Matthew &quot;Cornbread&quot; Compton), and Flea on trumpet.

On October 26, 2009, Har Mar Superstar was the musical guest on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; and earned rave reviews for his performance of &quot;Tall Boy&quot;, immediately increasing his popularity in North America.

In 2012, Har Mar appeared in the film &quot;Pitch Perfect&quot; as Clef No. 2 (a member of an older a cappella quartet), alongside Joe Lo Truglio, Jason Jones, and Donald Faison.

In October 2014, Har Mar returned to &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; alongside Nicole Scherzinger, Kerry Godliman, and James Acaster.

In the Season 3 premiere of &quot;Broad City&quot;, Har Mar played hipster gallery patron &quot;Oy Bomb&quot;, a reference to the similarly named Soy Bomb who crashed Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1998 Grammy performance.

Har Mar performs the theme song, and is the lead character of the &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot; band, for the 2017 Netflix revival of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

== Honors and awards ==

Tillmann was named the &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s 2004 Rock and Roll Man of the Year.

In 2013, Minneapolis mayor R. T. Rybak declared September 20, 2013 &quot;Har Mar Superstar Day&quot;. Tillmann was presented with an official proclamation from the city in recognition of his achievements in music and film, and in light of his continued connection to Minneapolis. In celebration, Tillmann kicked off his fall U.S. tour with a special performance that night at Minneapolis club First Avenue.

Tillmann was honored with a star on First Avenue&#x27;s outside mural, which recognizes performers who have played sold-out shows or otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the venue. According to journalist Steve Marsh, receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis.&quot; After anonymous sexual misconduct accusations against Tillmann emerged, &quot;First Avenue&quot; buckled to an organized series of complaints, and Har Mar Superstar&#x27;s star was painted over.

== Personal life ==

In 2016, Tillmann moved from Brooklyn back to Minnesota, specifically to the Northeast neighborhood of Minneapolis.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tillmann and his fiancée Laura Hauser created coloring books to raise funds to help affected businesses, including First Avenue and several local bars, including Grumpy&#x27;s and Palmer&#x27;s Bar.

Tillmann publicly discussed getting sober and how he became a mail carrier during the pandemic while promoting his album &quot;Roseville&quot;.

He married his partner Laura in 2022, double-barrelling their surnames to be legally known as Sean Tillmann-Hauser.

== Sexual assault accusations ==
In March 2021, three unnamed women accused Tillmann of sexual misconduct in the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; after a statement of &quot;a collective of survivors and allies&quot; was distributed via social media, alleging that a total of seven individuals had experienced sexual misconduct by Tillmann, ranging from &quot;pointed inappropriate sexual comments and grooming to physical sexual assault.&quot; Tillmann issued a since-deleted statement addressing the allegations on social media, denying the sexual assault allegation and addressing the others by referring to potential &quot;conduct that was harmful, abusive, and selfish&quot;, saying &quot;I am deeply sorry to anyone who feels I&#x27;ve hurt them; what matters here is not my feelings or perspective but to take these statements seriously and respectfully.&quot;

The &quot;Star Tribune&quot; published a fourth anonymous accuser&#x27;s narrative in a follow-up article, and reported a brewery severing business ties. The &quot;West Central Tribune&quot; reported Tillmann&#x27;s ousting as a partner at Moorhead, Minnesota, bar Harold&#x27;s on Main; the bar released a since-deleted statement on Facebook saying: &quot;At Harold&#x27;s, we believe Women. We take the accusations against our business partner Sean Tillmann very seriously. Upon learning of these accusations last week, we swiftly asked for Sean&#x27;s resignation and immediate dismissal from our business.&quot;

In April 2022, Tillmann booked a July 15 show in Minneapolis, writing, &quot;I&#x27;m celebrating 3 years free of alcohol today by announcing my 1st show back in a long time!&quot; Shortly after his announcement, the website selling tickets for the show said, &quot;the July 15 show is moving to a larger, TBA venue because of &#x27;OUTSTANDING&#x27; ticket demand&quot;, but a spokesperson for the venue said the show was &quot;canceled late Saturday due to the volume of community concerns voiced over Tillmann&#x27;s allegedly abusive past&quot;. Publicist Lisa Braun Dubbels called this a &quot;masterclass in how not to handle a PR crisis&quot;, to which Tillmann sarcastically replied, &quot;Thank you&quot;. Andrea Swensson, formerly of City Pages and 89.3 the Current, wrote: &quot;Sean, read the room. The announcement and drama around this show is causing widespread pain and distress. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll block me as well, but I&#x27;d suggest you sit down, take a beat, and think about what you&#x27;re doing here.&quot;

A June 1, 2023, show that Tillmann booked at The Hall at Fargo Brewing was canceled two days after it was announced. In the cancellation announcement, the promoter, Jade Nielsen, said he had &quot;made a mistake in booking the Har Mar show and wholeheartedly accept it ... the announcement was supposed to be made on Facebook with the comments section closed at the request of the Har Mar Superstar team&quot;, but despite this request, &quot;The comments [had] been left open and as of 9 a.m. Tuesday morning the post had more than 35 comments, mostly negative.&quot; Nielsen added, in response to the community outcry, &quot;Your voice is always welcome and will be heard.&quot; This followed the cancellation of another show at The What&#x27;s Up Lounge in Mankato earlier that week.

<text>Stockton Heath is a civil parish and suburb of Warrington, in the Borough of Warrington, Cheshire, England. It is located to the north of the Bridgewater Canal and to the south of the Manchester Ship Canal, which divides Stockton Heath from Latchford and north Warrington. It has a total resident population of 6,396.

Victoria Square is at the centre of Stockton Heath and is on the crossroads of the A49 and A56. Until the 1970s, the Victoria Hotel stood on this square but its location has been redeveloped. North of the square is the main shopping area which includes the Forge Shopping Centre, developed on the site of the old forge (Caldwell&#x27;s). Stockton Heath is home to a number of modern bars and restaurants, as well as traditional public houses. The Red Lion Inn dates back to the early 19th century and the Mulberry Tree on Victoria Square, opened in its present building (replacing earlier premises dating from 1725) in March 1907 .

Since 1988, much of the centre of Stockton Heath has been designated a conservation area to preserve its character but, at the same time, there has been redevelopment work with several new bars and restaurants moving into the centre of Stockton Heath.
==History==

A Roman road ran through Stockton Heath, along the route now known (appropriately) as Roman Road. There have been some excavations; more information is available at Warrington Museum.

Excavations of the large Roman industrial settlement in the suburbs of modern-day Wilderspool and Stockton Heath have unearthed a Roman mask, one of only a handful found in Europe, and the first evidence of this settlement was unearthed during the early excavation of the Bridgewater Canal in Stockton Heath in 1770. Primary evidence points to a probable temple to Minerva on the site, a strong focus on pottery and glass bead paste making industries, and a trapezoidal building of unidentified purpose. that one author suggests may have been an auxiliary fort. 
Although the name Stockton Heath appears to have been conferred on the village at a later date (indeed the area itself has been described rather as &quot;a hamlet of little consequence and no development until the 19th century&quot;), many secondary references state that a family bearing the name Stockton lived in the area from the end of the 13th century until at least the end of the 15th.

In 1643, parliamentarian forces under the command of Sir William Brereton advanced from Northwich to launch an attack on Warrington, the Lancashire headquarters of the royalist leader James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby. Sir William&#x27;s troops were routed at the &quot;Battle of Stockton Heath&quot;. Unverified local legend has it that many of the parliamentarian soldiers were buried at Hill Cliffe and Budworth. The battle is referred to in the 1859 novel Hollywood Hall by James Grant:

&quot;A priory, situated in a wooded hollow, ruined and battered as the Royalists had left it in 1643, next caught my eye, when, riding rapidly on, I approached a wide waste common called Stockton Heath, past which the Mersey rolled amid swamps and morasses filled with rushes and willows.&quot;

The same novel frequently refers to Stockton Heath as a &quot;waste&quot; and makes numerous references to swamps nearby. This description contrasts sharply with the variants of &quot;fashionable shopping village&quot; frequently encountered in the literature of estate agents today.

Early maps refer to a hamlet by the name of Stoken (or Stocken) where the present village of Stockton Heath now stands. However, more detailed old maps of the area of Acton Grange show a sparsely populated hamlet and refers only to the old buildings and bridges recognisable today in street names in the area, such as Whitefield Cottage.

The Bridgewater Canal, one of two canals that pass through the village, reached Stockton Heath in 1772, the year of the death of its designer, James Brindley

In the 1900s George Formby Senior moved his young family to Stockton Heath and it was from here that George Formby Junior began his entertainment career. Their house, Hillcrest, is a listed building. George Formby Senior died in Stockton Heath in 1921.

In 1974, Stockton Heath, historically part of Cheshire, became incorporated into the borough of Warrington under the Local Government Act 1972. Warrington, historically part of Lancashire, became a Cheshire borough under the act.

2008 saw the first ever Stockton Heath Festival, which is now going into its twelfth year. It is situated on Mill Lane Field in Stockton Heath, although it takes place over many venues throughout Grappenhall, Appleton and Stockton Heath. In 2011, the Stockton Heath Festival attracted 12,000 visitors.

==Schools==

The original LEA primary school of 1910 was demolished in October 2008, despite a strong campaign to retain it, after a new school had been built adjacent. There is also St Thomas C of E Primary School now located next to Alexandra Park. This was opened in 1974 and moved from its original site opposite St Thomas&#x27; Church. The original St Thomas&#x27; school was opened in 1833 and the building was eventually demolished (along with a late Victorian extension) in the late 1970s. On its site now stands a modern health centre.

<doc id="606754" wikidata="Q6849200" url="?curid=606754" title="Mike Wallace (historian)">
<text>Mike Wallace (born July 22, 1942) is an American historian. He specializes in the history of New York City, and in the history and practice of &quot;public history&quot;. In 1998 he co-authored &quot;Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898&quot;, which in 1999 won the Pulitzer Prize in History. In 2017, he published a successor volume, &quot;Greater Gotham: A History of New York City from 1898 to 1919&quot;. Wallace is a Distinguished Professor of History at John Jay College of Criminal Justice (City University of New York), and at the CUNY Graduate Center.

==Early life and education==
Wallace was born in Queens in 1942. The family moved to San Francisco in 1943 and returned to New York in 1949. He grew up in Fresh Meadows, Queens, Valley Stream, and Great Neck.

Wallace went to Columbia College in 1960. On graduating in 1964 he stayed on at Columbia University for graduate studies. With historian Richard Hofstadter as his adviser, his dissertation examined the emergence of the two-party system. He worked as Hofstadter&#x27;s research assistant, and in 1968 had his first article accepted by the &quot;American Historical Review&quot;.

In 1968 Wallace took part in the student strike at Columbia University. In 1969 he and Hofstadter wrote a documentary history of violence in the U.S.

==Career==
In 1970, he taught for a year at Franconia College. In 1971, Wallace accepted a teaching position at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

In the early 1970s, Wallace began working with other historians of his generation who were &quot;broadening the scope of American history by adding the voices of those previously excluded, such as women, blacks and the working class.&quot; In 1973, Wallace helped launch, and for the next ten years directed, the Radical History Forum. He also participated in transforming the &quot;Radical Historians&#x27; Newsletter&quot;, started in 1973, into the &quot;Radical History Review&quot;, by 1975, and then served as its editorial coordinator.

During the 1980s, Wallace wrote essays about the ways history gets presented – or misrepresented – to the general public, outside of schools and universities. In 1996, these pieces were collected in a book called &quot;Mickey Mouse History and Other Essays on American Memory&quot;.

In 1998, he co-authored (with Edwin G. Burrows) &quot;&quot;, which in 1999 won the Pulitzer Prize in History.

In 2000, Wallace founded the Gotham Center for New York City History, a non-profit organization. It is part of the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

The successor volume, &quot;Greater Gotham: A History of New York City from 1898 to 1919&quot;, was published on October 2, 2017.

==Personal life==

Wallace is married to Mexican author and playwright Carmen Boullosa. He was formerly married, in December 1969, to Nancy Greenough; in May 1973 to Elizabeth Fee and in October 1987 to historian and former Queen of Sikkim, Hope Cooke.

<doc id="606755" wikidata="Q2177468" url="?curid=606755" title="Fordwich">
<text>Fordwich is a market town and a civil parish in east Kent, England, on the River Stour, northeast of Canterbury.

It is the smallest community by population in Britain with a town council. Its population increased by 30 between 2001 and 2011.

==History==
Fordwich is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as a small village. The town grew in the Middle Ages as a port for boats on their way upriver to Canterbury. All of the Caen stone used by the Normans to rebuild Canterbury Cathedral in the 12th and 13th centuries was landed at Fordwich. It later became a limb of the Cinque Ports. It lost its status as a town in 1880 when it no longer had a Mayor and Corporation. However, in a reorganisation in 1974, Fordwich was again made a town. Fordwich Town Hall was rebuilt in or shortly before 1544.

The ancient Church of St Mary the Virgin, now redundant but open to the public, and in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust, contains part of a carved sarcophagus reputed to have contained the remains of St Augustine of Canterbury. The 16th-century building next the Town Hall, now known as Watergate House, was the family home of John and Gregory Blaxland, early 19th-century pioneers of Australia.

== Palaeolithic archaeology ==
During the 1920s-1930s, a significant amount of Palaeolithic handaxes were discovered during industrial quarrying to the west side of Fordwich. In total, these handaxes numbered some 330 pieces, along with flakes from lithic construction. During 2020, Cambridge University dug exploratory trenches at the same western location, discovering deposits of Palaeolithic archaeology, counting 251 in-situ Lower-Palaeolithic flakes and scrapers from Acheulean industry. In 2022, Archaeologist Peter Knowles [Professor David Bridgland Professor, Archaeology, Mark White ] of Durham University made a handaxe discovery from an area called &quot;Moat Rough&quot; in Fordwich. Moat Rough is of particular interest archaeologically because the ground there has been left fallow for decades with no quarrying or development. The new handaxe discovery at Moat Rough revealed that gravel terraces bearing Palaeolithic archaeology running underneath Fordwich are much more widespread than previously thought, indicating that there is much more research on early-man that needs to be done there.

== Community ==

There are two pubs in the town, the George &amp; Dragon and Fordwich Arms, which boasts a Michelin star. Fordwich gained angling and fishing repute from Izaak Walton for its &quot;Fordidge trout&quot;, one of the largest types found.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Dover TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Kent, Heart South, and KMFM Canterbury, a community based station that broadcast from Canterbury. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Kentish Gazette&quot;.

<doc id="606758" wikidata="Q2596209" url="?curid=606758" title="Joel Robinson">
<text>Joel Robinson is a fictional character featured in the American science fiction comedy television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (&quot;MST3K&quot;). He was portrayed by series creator Joel Hodgson. If counting the locally-produced episodes, Joel Robinson is the show&#x27;s longest-tenured host with 107 episodes (86 if not counting the aforementioned episodes) on television. He also returned as an occasional host in the online Season 13.

==Overview==
The show&#x27;s theme song explains Joel&#x27;s backstory: Formerly a janitor and inventor for Gizmonic Institute, Joel was launched into space by his boss Dr. Clayton Forrester and co-worker Dr. Laurence Erhardt – later replaced by TV&#x27;s Frank – as part of an experiment to see which bad movies were capable of destroying the human mind. Joel built the &#x27;Bots Tom Servo, Crow, Gypsy, and Cambot to keep him company, but in doing so used parts that apparently caused him to lose the ability to control when the films would stop and start. Though bombarded with many horrible films, he tends to take his captivity in benign stride, delivering most of his riffs in deadpan, holding no ill will against his captors and even affectionately calling them &quot;the Mads&quot; (among other amusing nicknames such as &quot;the Overlords&quot;) while riffing on popular culture (&quot;Auntie Em and Toto&quot;) or things found in Minnesota (&quot;Milavetz and Associates&quot;, a prominent Twin Cities-area law firm).

As the opening theme song said, Joel generally wore a red jumpsuit during most of his time as host, but on occasion would wear other colors, such as tan (during the show&#x27;s first improvisation season on KTMA) or green or bright aqua colored (often worn during Season 2). From season 2 episode 212 through his departure in episode 512, Joel wore a darker, maroon-colored jumpsuit, though the original red jumpsuit (and second season green one) remained in the show&#x27;s intro and opening theme.

Joel was the host from 1988–93. Episode #512, &quot;Mitchell&quot;, was his final episode as host; beginning with the following episode (#513 &quot;The Brain That Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot;) he was replaced by Mike Nelson, played by series head writer Michael J. Nelson.

During &quot;Mitchell&quot;, Gypsy overheard The Mads talking about eliminating Mike, the temp worker who was assisting them with an &quot;evil-scientist audit&quot;. Hearing them refer to Mike as a &quot;be-jumpsuited fool&quot; and thinking they were actually talking about Joel, she struggled to think of some way to help Joel escape his alleged fate. Joel escaped the &quot;Satellite of Love&quot; (SOL) in a previously undiscovered escape pod (named the &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot;) mislabeled as a crate of &quot;Hamdingers&quot; that Mike told Gypsy about. Mike managed to override The Mads&#x27; control over the &quot;SOL&quot; so that Gypsy could get Joel into the escape pod and launch it. After Joel&#x27;s departure from the &quot;SOL&quot;, the Mads tried to &quot;rescue&quot; him, but gave up seconds later when they discovered that he had already safely landed in the Australian Outback. Instead of killing Mike, as they initially planned, they sent him up to take Joel&#x27;s place.

After Joel&#x27;s departure he returned just once, in the show&#x27;s final season (episode 1001: &quot;Soultaker&quot;), having turned the escape pod into a makeshift spaceship. He returned to the SOL to make repairs to parts that were programmed to self-destruct a decade after the ship&#x27;s launch into orbit and give Mike a pep talk, after which he left the satellite through the corridor to the theater, where he had entered it earlier in that episode. Joel reported that, since leaving the ship, he had traveled around the Australian outback, doing pyrotechnics for the band &quot;Man or Astro-man?&quot;, and that he was currently working as a manager at a Hot Fish Shop in Osseo, Minnesota. (In reality, the most famous Hot Fish Shop in Minnesota had closed the weekend that episode 1001 aired, although the shop was located in Winona, Minnesota, rather than Osseo.)

After his departure, Joel was never directly mentioned until his appearance in &quot;Soultaker&quot;. However, he was indirectly referred to in the episode &quot;Santa Claus&quot; when Gypsy gives Mike a sweater as a gift, with the word &quot;Joike&quot; written on it, explaining that she had started knitting it when &quot;the other guy&quot; was present, but finished it after Mike&#x27;s arrival. He was again indirectly referenced in &quot;Time Chasers&quot; by Mike&#x27;s brother Eddie (who, due to a time travel mistake caused by Crow, was now in Mike&#x27;s place on the &quot;SOL&quot;), who called him the &quot;sleepy-eyed guy&quot;. After his visit in &quot;Soultaker&quot;, he was mentioned again in episode 1004 (&quot;Future War&quot;) during the film&#x27;s credits. Mike attempts to do something Joel-esque, worrying the Bots, and Crow eventually asks if this has anything to do with Joel stopping by recently. Joel was referenced again in episode 1008 (&quot;Final Justice&quot;), when Mike believed he could escape after &quot;suffering though a horrible Joe Don Baker movie&quot; like Joel had previously (the Bots revealed that Mike&#x27;s escape pod was actually the ship&#x27;s water heater).

Joel&#x27;s tenure as host was marked by &quot;invention exchanges&quot;, during which Joel and his mad scientist tormentors would come up with wacky inventions in a contest with each other. These sketches were a good match for Hodgson, who began his career as a prop comic; indeed, many of the inventions were items originally found in his standup act. The gag remained during the early episodes with Mike as host, but was done away with (since the writers wanted to focus on Mike&#x27;s strengths in portraying various comic characters), as were any references to the Gizmonic Institute, to which Hodgson owned the rights. The in-show reasoning behind the disposal of invention exchanges was that they were part of Gizmonic corporate culture, about which Mike (having never worked at the Institute) knew nothing. Another change was the relationship between host and bots; whereas Joel was more of a parental authority figure to Crow and Servo (in keeping with his status as their creator), the pair treated Mike more as a peer, occasionally subjecting him to pranks which they never would have considered playing on Joel.

Joel&#x27;s &quot;sleepy eyed&quot; persona was reportedly the result of Hodgson staying up all night working non-stop on the pilot, which was kept after the pilot was shot because the crew and other performers thought it was funny. Off-camera, Hodgson wears eyeglasses, which were occasionally seen when he turns his head in profile during scenes in the theater, but was very frequently seen in the Kickstarter videos and other promotional appearances.

== Name ==
In the pilot episode of &quot;MST3K&quot;, Hodgson simply used his real name. During its run on KTMA and the first season on the nationally broadcast Comedy Channel, Joel&#x27;s last name was never mentioned on air. During the second nationally broadcast season, his character began using the surname Robinson, after the protagonist of &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. (When Hodgson was later interviewed on &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, Space Ghost referred to him as &quot;Mr. Lost in Space himself, Joel Robinson&quot;.)

<doc id="606759" wikidata="Q3187217" url="?curid=606759" title="Joyboard">
<text>The Joyboard is a balance board peripheral for the Atari 2600 home video game console. It was released in 1983 and was used by standing on top of it and leaning in a certain direction. Skier Suzy Chaffee appeared on television and at toy fairs demonstrating its use.

==Design==
The Joyboard worked by installing the four directional latches of a joystick on the bottom of the board. Leaning in a certain direction engaged these latches, controlling the game. A joystick could also be connected to the Joyboard if necessary. This is done via a standard Atari joystick port placed next to where the cable goes into the board. It can be used in a &quot;plugthrough&quot; manner which saves disconnecting the board when not in use.

Due to similarities in design and function, the Wii Balance Board, a peripheral for Nintendo&#x27;s Wii video game console, has been compared to the Joyboard. The Wii Balance Board also allows users to control games with their feet, but uses more advanced technology in the form of pressure sensors under each foot.

==Software==
&quot;Mogul Maniac&quot; was the only game released for the Joyboard. A slalom skiing game, it was developed by Amiga Corporation and sold alongside the Joyboard upon release. &quot;Off Your Rocker&quot;, another game developed by Amiga, could also use the Joyboard, in place of a normal joystick. The object of the game was to repeat the color and sound patterns made by &quot;Rockin&#x27; Rollie&quot;, the on-screen character. Although the game was completed, it was never officially sold by Amiga, and instead the cartridges were sent to a company called Pleasant Valley Video who then sold them to the public. &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, a surfing game, was the first game developed for use with the Joyboard, but was not released either.

==Guru Meditation==

Early in the development of the Amiga computer operating system, the company&#x27;s developers became so frustrated with the system&#x27;s frequent crashes that, as a relaxation technique, they attempted to sit perfectly still on the Joyboard so not to engage any of the latches on the bottom of it. This is where the infamous Guru Meditation error originates from in earlier versions of the AmigaOS operating system.

In homage to this, Ian Bogost, founder of video game developer Persuasive Games, has developed the video game &quot;Guru Meditation&quot; in an attempt &quot;to create a legitimate zen meditation game&quot;. Although the game may be played using a joystick, if a player uses the Joyboard, they must sit perfectly still on it with their legs crossed. If a player is successful, the on-screen yogi will rise, and once enough time has passed the yogi will begin to float and the timer starts. The time of day changes roughly each hour, and clouds pass in the background. Ian Bogost worked in conjunction with Atari fansite AtariAge to manufacture ten copies of the game in cartridge form.

<doc id="606760" wikidata="Q1680440" url="?curid=606760" title="James Gang">
<text>James Gang was an American rock band formed in Cleveland, Ohio in 1966. The band went through a variety of line-up changes until they recorded their first album as a power trio consisting of Joe Walsh (guitars, lead vocals), Tom Kriss (bass) and Jim Fox (drums). Dale Peters replaced Kriss on bass for the band&#x27;s second and third albums. Two of the band&#x27;s songs, &quot;Funk #49&quot; and &quot;Walk Away&quot;, continue to be popular on classic rock and AOR stations.

In late 1971, Walsh left to pursue a solo career and would later join the Eagles. The band carried on with a number of other guitarists and lead singers to replace Walsh. However, after failing to produce a hit song over the course of six more studio albums, the band finally broke up in 1977. Walsh, Fox and Peters have reformed for reunions since then, including September 3, 2022, when the power trio returned for a performance at the Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert held in Wembley Stadium.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
Drummer Jim Fox first played with the Cleveland-area band the Outsiders but left them in 1965 to attend college. After they had a national hit the following year with &quot;Time Won&#x27;t Let Me&quot;, Fox returned temporarily to play with them after their drummer was drafted. After leaving them again to return to school, Fox, heavily influenced by the sound of British Invasion bands such as the Beatles, the Who and the Yardbirds, began to think about forming his own band and teamed up with schoolmate Ronnie Silverman (guitar), bassist Tom Kriss and keyboardist Phil Giallombardo in 1966.

The James Gang&#x27;s earliest lineup consisted of Fox (drums), Kriss (bass), Silverman (guitar), Giallombardo (vocals, keyboards), and after auditioning some 25 candidates for lead guitar, the band decided to go with Greg Grandillo, who later played with another popular Cleveland band, Rainbow Canyon. He was soon replaced by Dennis Chandler, who was then succeeded by John &quot;Mouse&quot; Michalski who, with the Count Five, had just enjoyed a national hit with &quot;Psychotic Reaction&quot;.

A short time later, Fox was invited to audition for a nine-piece rhythm and blues band that was being assembled. Fox initially declined the offer but changed his mind when he heard that local guitar legend Glenn Schwartz, who was fresh out of the army, was to be in attendance. After hearing Schwartz play, and hearing that two of his influences were the Spencer Davis Group and Jeff Beck, Fox was impressed and invited Schwartz to join the James Gang. However, Michalski was not as enthused by Glenn&#x27;s playing as Fox and left the band immediately. Ronnie Silverman soon departed as well to enter the military. Bill Jeric was then brought in to play alongside Schwartz. No recordings were ever released by these early lineups of the band.

Around Christmastime of 1967, Schwartz, who was found to be AWOL from the army and was breaking up with his wife, decided to leave the band and move to California, where he ended up forming the band Pacific Gas &amp; Electric.

===Joe Walsh years===
Just days later, shortly after the new year of 1968, a friend of Schwartz&#x27;s, Joe Walsh (from a band called The Measles), knocked on Fox&#x27;s door and asked to be given a tryout as Glenn&#x27;s replacement. Walsh was accepted and the band continued as a five piece for a short time until Giallombardo, who was still in high school at the time, left. Jeric and Walsh worked together on guitar parts, but in the spring of 1968, Jeric ended up leaving as well. He was replaced by a returning Ronnie Silverman, who had been discharged from the military.

On Sunday June 9, 1968 the group played a concert in Detroit at the Grande Ballroom opening for Cream. At the last minute, Silverman informed the others that he would not be joining them at the show. The band, desperately in need of the money, took to the stage as a trio. They liked their sound as a threesome and decided to remain that way.

In 1968 the band signed with manager Mark Barger, who was handling the career of a fellow Ohio band, the Lemon Pipers, who had just scored a big hit with &quot;Green Tambourine&quot;. Barger put the Gang in touch with ABC Records staff producer Bill Szymczyk, who got them signed to ABC&#x27;s new Bluesway Records subsidiary in January 1969.

In March 1969 the band, now consisting of Fox, Kriss and Walsh and produced by Szymczyk, released its debut LP, &quot;Yer&#x27; Album&quot;.

Later in 1969, Szymczyk was music coordinator for the George Englund movie &quot;Zachariah&quot; (which was released in 1971), based on the 1922 novel &quot;Siddhartha&quot; by writer Hermann Hesse. Szymczyk arranged for the band to appear in the movie, with two James Gang songs, &quot;Laguna Salada&quot; and &quot;Country Fever&quot;, also being used. For the recording of these two songs, vocalist Kenny Weiss, a friend of Fox&#x27;s, was brought in to allow Walsh to focus on his guitar playing. However, Weiss was gone by the time the group arrived in Mexico to film their scenes in the movie. &quot;Laguna Salada&quot; and &quot;Country Fever&quot; later reappeared as bonus tracks on the 2000 re-release of &quot;The James Gang Greatest Hits&quot;.

In November 1969 bassist Tom Kriss left the band after his father, George, was diagnosed with lung cancer after he had worked for Alcoa for years, where he was likely exposed to various industrial carcinogens involved in the production of aluminum. Kriss was replaced by Dale Peters, who was brought in from another group called Case of E.T. Hooley. Kriss also died from cancer on May 6, 2013, at age 63.

In 1969 Roger Abramson went to JB&#x27;s, a small club in Kent, Ohio, and advised Belkin Productions to start a Management division with the James Gang and the band Silk, which included Michael Stanley.

In July 1970 the band, composed of Fox, Peters and Walsh, released its second album, &quot;James Gang Rides Again&quot;, which included the popular single &quot;Funk #49.&quot;

In the spring of 1970, Belkin Productions arranged for the band to open for the Who for six dates during a US tour and their guitarist Pete Townshend was so impressed with them he invited the band to open for them on their fall tour of the United Kingdom. Townshend and Walsh then started a long friendship with Townshend telling Rolling Stone that Walsh was the best American guitar player. In January 1971 they appeared on Top of the Pops in the United Kingdom.

In July 1971 the Gang returned to tour Europe. During their heyday, the band also shared the stage with artists like Grand Funk Railroad, Kinks, Humble Pie, Three Dog Night and Led Zeppelin.

But after two more albums, 1971&#x27;s &quot;Thirds,&quot; and the live album &quot;James Gang Live in Concert&quot; released later that same year, Walsh, who was tired of the pressure of doing most of the writing and singing and being the only melodic instrument in the trio, left the band in December 1971. He relocated to the mountains of Colorado and eventually formed Barnstorm.

===Post-Walsh 1970s===
Peters and Fox carried on with vocalist Roy Kenner and guitarist Domenic Troiano (both ex-members of the Canadian band Bush) for two albums, &quot;Straight Shooter&quot; and &quot;Passin&#x27; Thru&quot;, both released in 1972. But in recent interviews, Fox stated that things did not work out musically with Troiano as hoped, so Troiano left the band in 1973 and would subsequently join the Guess Who.
Troiano was replaced by guitarist Tommy Bolin, formally from Zephyr, after Joe Walsh called to recommend him to the band. Bolin joined the band in August 1973 and appeared on two albums, &quot;Bang!&quot; and &quot;Miami&quot;, that saw the band moving from ABC Records over to Atlantic Records&#x27; Atco label.

During the recording of &quot;Miami&quot; in 1974, Kenner ran into legal troubles after a drug bust and was not available initially for recording. Other singers were reportedly auditioned but eventually Kenner was able to return to complete the album. Not happy with the musical direction, and frustrated with the indifference from Bolin concerning new material, Kenner gave notice, telling Fox and Peters he would stay on until a replacement was found. Aware of this development, a disillusioned Bolin decided to leave as well, albeit in a slightly different manner: no notice, and simply not showing up for the gig. Bolin went on to work with Dr. John and Alphonse Mouzon and attempted to form another group with future Crosby, Stills and Nash keyboardist Mike Finnigan before accepting the offer from Deep Purple in 1975.

After Kenner&#x27;s departure he later joined Ohio based band &quot;LAW&quot;, followed by a stint with Troiano, then some solo projects, and many years doing voice-over sessions. After Kenner and Bolin&#x27;s exit, the band went over to England to look for a new guitar player. Jimmy McCulloch (ex-Thunderclap Newman) expressed interest in joining but was committed to Paul McCartney&#x27;s Wings. The group returned home dejected.

By early 1975, Fox and Peters decided to try again with a new lineup that included Fox&#x27;s old friends, vocalist Bubba Keith, who had been playing out in LA with a band called Uncle Tom and guitarist Richard Shack who had previously played in the band Case of E.T. Hooley with Peters. This lineup recorded the album &quot;Newborn&quot;, which featured a cover of the Elvis Presley staple &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;.
The band released a final recording, &quot;Jesse Come Home&quot;, in February 1976, which featured the return of early member Phil Giallombardo, who rejoined along with new guitarist/vocalist Bob Webb (who, like Joe Walsh, had played in the group The Measles).

Ultimately, none of the post-Walsh lineups achieved the level of success enjoyed in their early 1970s heyday. Drummer Fox was the only remaining member of the original band when James Gang finally disbanded early in 1977.

=== Later years ===

In a 1998 Chris Welch interview, Fox talks of the Gang&#x27;s final years and the breakup: &quot;It became a quest to find a suitable replacement for Joe Walsh. We&#x27;d try some guys and do an album or two, but it wasn&#x27;t quite what we wanted and so we&#x27;d move on to something else in the hope of recapturing the old spirit. Some of the albums were good but we were always looking to find that particular thing we had with Joe and I don&#x27;t think we ever found it again. So, after all those changes, Dale and I just talked one day and said &#x27;Enough&#x27;s enough&#x27;. That&#x27;s when we decided to let it go. I never aspired to start another band. Instead I decided to take six months off and see what happened. If John Lennon called I&#x27;d see about it. That was my attitude. I wasn&#x27;t looking to start up again.&quot;

After James Gang broke up, Fox was involved for a time with the Belkin management firm, who handled the affairs for artists like Michael Stanley Band, Wild Cherry and Donnie Iris. As for other latter day Gang members, Bubba Keith went on to play for England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley and was later the lead vocalist for Point Blank, while Bob Webb played in Jay Ferguson&#x27;s band.

The &quot;classic&quot; lineup of the band consisting of Walsh, Peters and Fox first reunited in July 1991 at Nautica Pavilion in Cleveland when Fox and Peters took to the stage during a Walsh concert to play three songs. The trio then gathered together again to perform at an election rally for President Bill Clinton at the Cleveland State University Convocation Center on November 4, 1996. They also appeared on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; in the 1998–99 season and at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Allen Theater in Cleveland for three shows in February 2001, joined by keyboardist Mark Avsec (ex-Wild Cherry and Donnie Iris &amp; the Cruisers). And in the summer of 2005, the group performed another handful of shows (joined again by Avsec) in the Cleveland area.

As of May 2004, Glenn Schwartz was playing guitar and singing Thursday nights at &quot;Major Hooples&quot; in the Flats, Cleveland. And as of 2014, Schwartz continued to perform at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland. Schwartz died on November 3, 2018, at the age of 77.
In April 2006 it was announced that the Walsh/Peters/Fox lineup of the group would be touring the United States later that summer, supported by keyboardist Bill Appleberry and backing vocalists Gia Ciambetti, Robbyn Kirmsse and Stacy Michelle. During this summer tour, the band appeared in August performing live on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; on Sirius Satellite Radio.

In March 2012 it was stated on ultimateclassicrock.com that Walsh was in the Cleveland-area Lava Room Recording Studios with Fox and Peters, working on new recordings of their well-known James Gang tracks, with longtime friends Joe Vitale and Michael Stanley contributing. Since this time, however, nothing more has been heard about this, probably due to Walsh&#x27;s ongoing busy schedule with the Eagles.

In August 2022 it was announced that the band would play two shows for the Taylor Hawkins tribute concerts. The shows were scheduled for September 3 at Wembley Stadium and September 27 at the Kia Forum.

The James Gang participated in their first in-store signing event in over 50 years on November 8, 2022, at Used Kids Records in Columbus, Ohio. After a brief interview, Jimmy Fox, Joe Walsh and Dale Peters signed autographs at the store, which is located just a few blocks from Walsh’s childhood home. Proceeds from the event raised funds for various veterans-related organizations via Walsh’s VetsAid charity.

On November 13, 2022, once again supported by Mark Avsec and a vocal trio, and joined on their encore on drums by Dave Grohl, the group performed at the VetsAid concert in Columbus, Ohio. There were early reports that VetsAid would be the final gig for the James Gang, but Joe Walsh said that may not be the case. “Glenn Frey used to say never say never, so I’m not,” Walsh explained. “We played the concerts for Taylor Hawkins and it worked really good; we got in front of an audience and we were able to do what we used to do. I haven’t played loud on 11 in a long time; I play in a vocal group, so I have small amps. It’s different to turn it up and go for it, and I didn’t realize how much I missed it until we started cookin’ with the James Gang. I can’t wait to play again.”

<doc id="606762" wikidata="Q1967561" url="?curid=606762" title="Bettie Serveert">
<text>Bettie Serveert is a Dutch indie rock band. The name translates to &quot;Bettie Serves&quot;, or &quot;Service to Bettie&quot;, which is the title of a book written by Dutch tennis player Betty Stöve, who made it to the Wimbledon Ladies Singles final in 1977.

==Formation==
The band is composed of Carol Van Dijk (or &quot;van Dyk&quot;, born 22 April 1962, in Vancouver, British Columbia) (vocals and guitar), Peter Visser (guitar), Herman Bunskoeke (born c. 1961 in Amsterdam) (bass) and Berend Dubbe (born c. 1961 in Deventer) (drums). The band originally formed in 1986, but its members split up for four years, following their first gig. They reformed in 1990, and released their debut album, &quot;Palomine&quot;, in 1992. According to The Guardian, the album was a &quot;&quot;high point for European guitar music in an era dominated by the US and UK&quot;.&quot; 

==Subsequent releases==
In 1995, the group released their second album, &quot;Lamprey&quot;, which was well received by critics. They subsequently obtained tour slots alongside bands including Belly, Dinosaur Jr, Buffalo Tom, Superchunk, Come, and Jeff Buckley.

After releasing the full-length album &quot;Dust Bunnies&quot; in 1997, Bettie Serveert released a cover album featuring songs from the band Velvet Underground. Dubbe left the band due to artistic differences and started his own band, Bauer.

In July 2001, Van Dijk and Pascal Deweze of Sukilove released their self-titled album as &quot;Chitlin&#x27; Fooks&quot;. They followed it with &quot;Did it Again&quot; in January 2003.

A number of drummers, such as Reinier Veldman (who played the drums in the Bettie Serveert proto-band &quot;De Artsen&quot;), stood in for Dubbe on their next album, &quot;Private Suit&quot;. Stoffel Verlackt, Jeroen Blankert, and Gino Geudens played the drums on &quot;Log 22&quot; and &quot;Attagirl&quot;. Bettie Serveert continues to tour extensively through Western Europe, Canada, and the United States. Their cover of the Bright Eyes track &quot;Lover I Don&#x27;t Have to Love&quot; was featured in episode 18 of season 3 of the FOX show &quot;The OC&quot;. &quot;Palomine&quot;&#x27;s title track can be heard playing in the background during episode 4 of &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;. The band also covered Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It with Mine&quot; for the soundtrack of the 1996 indie film &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;.

Bettie Serveert released a digital only EP, &quot;Deny All&quot;, on Second Motion Records, on 26 January 2010 in the United States. Their ninth full-length album, &quot;Pharmacy of Love&quot;, was also given a US release by Second Motion on 23 March of that year.

2017 saw the release of &quot;Damaged Good&quot;, again to positive reception. A pink vinyl version with a gatefold cover, limited to 1,000 copies, was released as part of Record Store Day that year.

==Carol van Dijk==
Carol van Dijk was born in Canada to Dutch parents. Her native language is English. Her family moved to Holland in 1969, and van Dijk struggled with the subsequent language barrier, in particular the Amsterdam variation of the Dutch language. Her voice has been praised for its beauty and clarity, as well as its unusual pronunciations.

<text>Igor Nikolayevich Larionov (; born 3 December 1960) is a Russian ice hockey coach, sports agent and former professional ice hockey player, known as &quot;the Professor&quot;. Considered one of the best hockey players of all time, he, along with Viacheslav Fetisov, were instrumental in forcing the Soviet government to let Soviet players compete in the National Hockey League (NHL). During his career, which lasted from 1977 to 2006, he primarily played the centre position.

Larionov won the Stanley Cup three times with the Detroit Red Wings (1997, 1998, 2002) and was inducted as a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame on 10 November 2008. He was also a member of Detroit&#x27;s famed Russian Five line. His international career was recognized with induction into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Playing career==

===Soviet League (1977–1989)===
Larionov began his career in the Soviet League with Khimik Voskresensk in 1977–78, appearing in six games. Joining the club full-time the following season, he recorded seven points in 32 games as a rookie. He improved to 45 points in 43 games in 1980–81, garnering the attention of CSKA Moscow and Soviet national team coach Viktor Tikhonov. Tikhonov approached him before a game between CSKA and Khimik early in the 1980–81 season, inviting Larionov to play for him. He notched five assists that game against Tikhonov&#x27;s team and the following season, joined CSKA Moscow as the top-line centre between Vladimir Krutov and Sergei Makarov. The trio became known as the &quot;KLM Line&quot; and dominated both the Soviet League and international competition. They were joined by defensive pairing Viacheslav Fetisov and Alexei Kasatonov to form the five-man lineup known as the &quot;Green Unit&quot;, so called for the green uniforms they wore during practice.

Larionov put up 53 points in his first season with CSKA, including a Soviet career-high 31 goals. He was named the Soviet MVP in 1988 following a personal best 32 assists and 57 points. Despite the success, Larionov resisted Tikhonov&#x27;s draconian coaching style and the Soviet system that had a tight grip on the players&#x27; personal lives. He objected that Tikhonov kept his players confined to barracks (in CSKA&#x27;s Archangel training facility) for as much as 11 months a year, even when they were married (CSKA was a functioning division of the Soviet Army). He told a Russian magazine that with the players being away from home for so long, &quot;it is a wonder our wives manage to give birth.&quot; Larionov also recounted suspicious injections that national team players would receive annually leading up to the World Championships. According to Larionov, he refused an injection prior to the 1982 World Championships and was not asked again.

Larionov led the revolt with Fetisov against Soviet authorities that prevented Soviet players from defecting to the NHL. He had been drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in 1985 and openly expressed a desire to move to North America. After talking to reporters about one day playing in the NHL, Tikhonov told Larionov that there was a mix-up with his passport and that he could not join the team for their six-city tour of the NHL in December 1985. He was to be kept off the national squad as well until the lobbying of Fetisov and other players returned Larionov to the team.

===National Hockey League (1989–2004)===
After eight years of voicing his discontent, Larionov was allowed to join the Canucks in 1989–90. He left the Soviet Union around the same time as several other Soviet players, including all four of his &quot;Green Unit&quot; teammates. They were sold in order to infuse the cash-strapped Sovintersport (the governing body for sports in the former Soviet Union), which would draw a portion of the players&#x27; salaries. Larionov was joined in Vancouver by Krutov, and both struggled initially. While Krutov lasted only one year in the NHL, Larionov played three years for the Canucks and got progressively better as he adapted to the North American game. In the 1991–92 season, he centered the Canucks&#x27; top line, which included Greg Adams and rookie Pavel Bure. Larionov took the young Russian star under his wing that season.

After his three-year contract with the Canucks had expired, Larionov chose to play a year in Switzerland so that Sovintersport would not continue to draw a portion of his salary. Subsequently, the Canucks left him unprotected in the 1992 NHL Waiver Draft and he was claimed by the San Jose Sharks on 4 October 1992. He went to the San Jose Sharks in 1993–94, where he was re-united with Sergei Makarov and helped the Sharks to a record 59-point improvement over the previous season. The Sharks then upset the heavily favoured Detroit Red Wings in the opening round of the playoffs and extended the Toronto Maple Leafs to seven games in the Conference Semi-Finals before falling. During the 1994–95 season, Larionov served as an alternate captain for the Sharks.

During the 1995–96 season, the re-building Sharks traded Larionov along with a conditional draft pick to the Detroit Red Wings for forward sniper Ray Sheppard. Red Wings coach and general manager Scotty Bowman had specifically targeted Larionov for his all-around game, noting his ability to play both the power play and penalty kill with equal success. Larionov was one of the Red Wings&#x27; &quot;Russian Five&quot; in the mid-1990s. He and Fetisov were looked on as father figures by the team&#x27;s other Russian players, which included Sergei Fedorov, Vyacheslav Kozlov and Vladimir Konstantinov.

Larionov was an integral part of the Red Wings&#x27; back to back Stanley Cup Championships in 1997 and 1998. That summer, Larionov and his Russian teammates made history by bringing the famed Cup home to Russia for the first time ever.

In 2000, Larionov signed with the Florida Panthers, where he was re-united with Pavel Bure. It was a disaster, though, and Larionov was traded back to Detroit before the end of the season. He helped the Red Wings to the 2002 Stanley Cup championship, and made his mark on the 2002 Stanley Cup Finals by scoring the winning goal in triple overtime of Game 3 against the Carolina Hurricanes. Detroit would win the series in five games.

He played his final NHL season for the New Jersey Devils in 2003–04, where Viacheslav Fetisov was an assistant coach. He finished his career by playing two games for the Swedish team Brunflo IK in 2005–06, producing one goal and three assists. Brunflo is the same team that his former linemate in CSKA Moscow and the Soviet Union, Vladimir Krutov, ended his career with ten years earlier.

==International play==








On the international stage, playing for the Soviet Union, Larionov centered Vladimir Krutov and Sergei Makarov on the famed &quot;KLM Line&quot;. Along with defensemen Viacheslav Fetisov and Alexei Kasatonov, they formed the &quot;Green Unit&quot;, so named because they wore green jerseys in practice. All five players also played for CSKA Moscow.

Larionov won two gold medals (1984, 1988) for the Soviet Union and one bronze medal for Russia (2002) at the Olympics. At the World Championships, Larionov won four golds (1982, 1983, 1986, 1989), one silver (1987), and one bronze (1985). He was an instrumental member of the Soviet squad that won the 1981 Canada Cup (this tournament was the coming out of the KLM Line) and played in the 1984 and 1987 events as well. He then played for Russia in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey.

Larionov, Viacheslav Fetisov, Joe Sakic, Sidney Crosby, Scott Niedermayer and Corey Perry are the only six players in the world who have won Olympics Gold, World Championship Gold, a Stanley Cup (IIHF Triple Gold Club), Canada/World Cup, and World Junior Championship Gold.

Larianov&#x27;s international career was recognized with induction into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Post-retirement==
In 2008, Larionov was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He was the sixth Russian-born inductee, and the fifth-ever player.

In July 2008, Larionov was named director of hockey operations for Russian powerhouse hockey club SKA Saint Petersburg. He also works as a player agent in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.

In 2011, he was appointed to a three-year term on the Hall Of Fame&#x27;s selection committee.

In 2020, Larionov was announced the head coach of the Russian junior team. He made his debut as head coach at the 2021 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

In 2022, Larionov was named head coach of Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod of the KHL.

==Personal life==
Larionov is married to former figure skater Elena Batanova and has three children, Alyonka, Diana and Igor Larionov II. Currently, he is a professional wine merchant making wines under the labels &quot;Hattrick&quot; and &quot;Triple Overtime&quot; with wines from Australia and California. Other wine labels include &quot;Slapshot&quot; and &quot;IL Triple Overtime.&quot; The name Triple Overtime Wine Company roots from Larionov&#x27;s winning goal in the third overtime period of Game 3 in the 2002 Stanley Cup Finals.

<doc id="606777" wikidata="Q484827" url="?curid=606777" title="Anal cancer">
<text>Anal cancer is a cancer which arises from the anus, the distal opening of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms may include bleeding from the anus or a lump near the anus. Other symptoms may include pain, itchiness, or discharge from the anus. A change in bowel movements may also occur.
Risk factors include human papillomavirus (HPV), HIV/AIDS, receptive anal sex, smoking, and many sexual partners. Anal cancer is typically a squamous cell carcinoma. Other types include adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Diagnosis is suspected based on physical examination and confirmed by tissue biopsy.
Prevention includes avoiding risk factors and HPV vaccination. Standard treatment may include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery. About 8,300 people are diagnosed a year in the United States, representing about 0.5% of new cancers. Onset is typically after the age of 45. Women are affected more often than men. The number of cases has increased since the 1990s. The five-year survival rate in the United States is 68%.

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms of anal cancer can include pain or pressure in the anus or rectum, a change in bowel habits, a lump near the anus, rectal bleeding, itching or discharge. Bleeding may be severe.

==Risk factors==
* Human papillomavirus: Examination of squamous cell carcinoma tumor tissues from patients in Denmark and Sweden showed a high proportion of anal cancers to be positive for the types of HPV that are also associated with high risk of cervical cancer. In another study done, high-risk types of HPV, notably HPV-16, were detected in 84 percent of anal cancer specimens examined. Based on the study in Denmark and Sweden, Parkin estimated that 90% of anal cancers are attributable to HPV.
* Sexual activity: Due to increased risk of exposure to HPV, having multiple sex partners and receptive anal intercourse greatly increases the likelihood of developing anal cancer, for men and women.
* Smoking: Current smokers are several times more likely to develop anal cancer compared with nonsmokers. Epidemiologist Janet Daling, Ph.D., a member of Fred Hutchinson&#x27;s Public Health Sciences Division, and her team found that smoking appears to play a significant role in anal-cancer development that is independent of other behavioral risk factors, such as sexual activity. More than half of the anal-cancer patients studied were current smokers at the time of diagnosis, as compared to a smoking rate of about 23 percent among the controls. &quot;Current smoking is a very important promoter of the disease,&quot; said Daling. &quot;There&#x27;s a fourfold increase in risk if you&#x27;re a current smoker, regardless of whether you&#x27;re male or female.&quot; They explained that the mechanism behind smoking and anal-cancer development is unknown, but researchers speculate that smoking interferes with a process called apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which helps rid the body of abnormal cells that could turn cancerous. Another possibility is that smoking suppresses the immune system, which can decrease the body&#x27;s ability to clear persistent infection or abnormal cells.
* Immunosuppression, which is often associated with HIV infection.
* A history of cervical, vaginal or vulval cancers
* Cloacogenic. Cloacogenic carcinoma is a rare tumor of the anorectal region originating from a persistent remnant of the cloacal membrane of the embryo. The tumor accounts for 2–3% of anorectal carcinomas and occurs more than twice as often in women.

==Pathology==

Most anal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas (epidermoid carcinomas), that arises near the squamocolumnar junction. It may be keratinizing (basaloid) or non-keratinizing (cloacogenic).

Other types of anal cancer are adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, sarcoma or melanoma.

===Staging===
Pathologic TNM staging of anal carcinomas:

Primary tumor (pT)
* &quot;TX: Primary tumor not assessed&quot;
* &quot;T0: No evidence of primary tumor&quot;
* &quot;Tis: High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion&quot;
* &quot;T1: Tumor ≤ 2 cm&quot;
* &quot;T2: Tumor &gt; 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm&quot;
* &quot;T3: Tumor &gt; 5 cm&quot;
* &quot;T4: Tumor of any size invading adjacent organ(s), such as the vagina, urethra or bladder&quot;

Regional lymph nodes (pN)
* &quot;NX: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed&quot;
* &quot;N0: No regional lymph node metastasis&quot;
* &quot;N1: Metastasis in inguinal, mesorectal, internal iliac or external iliac nodes&quot;
** &quot;N1a: Metastasis in inguinal, mesorectal or internal iliac nodes&quot;
** &quot;N1b: Metastasis in external iliac lymph nodes&quot;
** &quot;N1c: Metastasis in external iliac with any N1a nodes&quot;

Distant metastasis (pM)
* &quot;M0: No distant metastasis&quot;
* &quot;M1: Distant metastasis&quot;

==Prevention==
Since many, if not most, anal cancers derive from HPV infections, and since the HPV vaccine before exposure to HPV prevents infection by some strains of the virus and has been shown to reduce the incidence of potentially precancerous lesions, scientists surmise that HPV vaccination may reduce the incidence of anal cancer.
The efficacy of the vaccine against HPV types 16 and 18 in naive women ≤26 years old has been shown to be between 91 and 100% but is lower when individuals are vaccinated irrespective of baseline HPV infection at 76%.

In 2010, Gardasil was approved in the US to prevent anal cancer and pre-cancerous lesions in males and females aged 9 to 26 years. The vaccine has been used before to help prevent cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancer, and associated lesions caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in women.

==Screening==
As the incidence of anal cancer has increased in recent years, screening and early detection of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) has become a necessity in patients at risk. This screening detects premalignant lesions, which are highly prevalents, and improves the staging of lesions after treatment.

Anal Pap smears similar to those used in cervical cancer screening have been studied for early detection of anal cancer in high-risk individuals. In 2011, an HIV clinic implemented a program to enhance access to anal cancer screening for HIV-positive men. Nurse practitioners perform anal Papanicolaou screening, and men with abnormal results receive further evaluation with high-resolution anoscopy. The program has helped identify many precancerous growths, allowing them to be safely removed. A similar study was performed in women with a history of cervical cancer or high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. More than 30% had abnormal anal Pap smears and one third of those already had anal intraepithelial neoplasia.

==Treatment==

=== Localised disease ===
Localised disease (carcinoma-in-situ) and the precursor condition, anal intraepithelial neoplasia (anal dysplasia or AIN) can be ablated with minimally invasive methods such as infrared photocoagulation.

Previously, anal cancer was treated with surgery, and in early-stage disease (i.e., localised cancer of the anus without metastasis to the inguinal lymph nodes), surgery is often curative. The difficulty with surgery has been the necessity of removing the internal and external anal sphincter, with concomitant fecal incontinence. For this reason, many patients with anal cancer have required permanent colostomies.

Current gold-standard therapy is the combination of chemotherapy and radiation treatment to reduce the necessity of debilitating surgery. This &quot;combined modality&quot; approach has led to the increased preservation of an intact anal sphincter, and therefore improved quality of life after definitive treatment. Survival and cure rates are excellent, and many patients are left with a functional sphincter. Some patients have fecal incontinence after combined chemotherapy and radiation. Biopsies to document disease regression after chemotherapy and radiation were commonly advised, but are not as frequent any longer. Current chemotherapy consists of continuous infusion 5-FU over four days with bolus mitomycin given concurrently with radiation. 5-FU and cisplatin are recommended for metastatic anal cancer. For stages I to III anal squamous cell carcinoma, using cisplatin instead of mitomycin C (MMC) in chemoradiation therapy doesn&#x27;t improve overall survival or slow down the cancer compared to the standard treatment of 5-FU plus MMC. Although cisplatin might cause fewer blood-related side effects, 5-FU combined with MMC is still the preferred treatment for nonmetastatic anal cancer. A 2024 systematic review found that chemoradiation therapy (CRT) with 5-FU and Mitomycin C improves locoregional control and colostomy-free survival compared to radiation alone, though with increased acute hematologic toxicity.

===Metastatic or recurrent disease===
10 to 20% of patients treated for anal cancer will develop distant metastatic disease following treatment. Metastatic or recurrent anal cancer is difficult to treat, and usually requires chemotherapy. Radiation is also employed to palliate specific locations of disease that may be causing symptoms. Chemotherapy commonly used is similar to other squamous cell epithelial neoplasms, such as platinum analogues, anthracyclines such as doxorubicin, and antimetabolites such as 5-FU and capecitabine. JD Hainsworth developed a protocol that includes Taxol and Carboplatinum along with 5-FU.

== Prognosis ==
Median survival rates for people with distant metastases range from 8 to 34 months. Surgical resection with permanent colostomies was the standard treatment until the 1970s, yielding 5-year overall survival of approximately 50%. The best overall survival rates are seen after combined radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy (5-FU + Mitomycin) in people with T2N0 and T3N0 categories of disease (5-y overall survival: 82%). The 5-year overall survival rates of patients with T4 with no involved lymph nodes, T3 with involved lymph nodes, and T4 with involved lymph nodes disease after the combined treatment is 57%, 57%, and 42%, respectively.

Radiation therapy side effects (and occurrence rates) include acute (27%) and late (17%) dermatological toxicities, acute (14%) and late (27%) gastrointestinal toxicities, and chronic pelvic radiation disease (1-10%), e.g., irreversible lumbosacral plexopathy.

==Epidemiology==
Worldwide in 2002 there were an estimated 30,400 new cases of anal cancer. With approximately equal fractions in the developing (15,900) and developed (14,500) countries. An estimated 90% (27,400) were attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV).

=== United States ===
In 2014 about 7,060 new cases of anal cancer were diagnosed in the United States (4,430 in women and 2,630 in men). It is typically found in adults, average age early 60s. In 2019, an estimated 8,300 adults will be diagnosed with anal cancer.

In the United States, an estimated 800 to 900 people die of anal cancer annually.

=== United Kingdom ===
Anal cancer accounts for less than 1% of all cancer cases and deaths in the United Kingdom. Around 1,200 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011, and around 310 people died in 2012.

<text>Boğaziçi University (Turkish: &quot;Boğaziçi Üniversitesi&quot;), also known as Bosphorus University, is a public research university in Istanbul, Turkey, historically tied to a former American educational institution, Robert College. Robert College was the first American college to be founded outside the United States. The main campus of Boğaziçi University is located on the European side of the Bosphorus strait. It has seven faculties and two schools offering undergraduate degrees and seven institutes offering graduate degrees. Traditionally, the language of instruction is English.

Boğaziçi University is a center of attraction for students who excel in the nation-wide entrance examination, as well as for distinguished faculty. Its liberal approach has fostered an interdisciplinary and international research environment, and the peaceful coexistence of different lifestyles and worldviews.

== History ==
In 1863, Robert College was founded in Bebek by Christopher Robert, a wealthy American philanthropist, and Cyrus Hamlin, a Congregational missionary devoted to education. Six years after its foundation, the first campus (the current-day Boğaziçi South Campus) was built on the ridge near Rumelian Castle (Turkish: &quot;Rumeli Hisarı&quot;) with the permission of Sultan Abdülaziz.

According to a college catalogue compiled for the 1878–1879 academic year, &quot;the object of the College is to give to its students, without distinction of race or religion, a thorough education equal in all respects to that obtained at a first-class American college and based upon the same general principles.&quot;

After Cyrus Hamlin, the college was administered by George Washburn (1877–1903) and Caleb Gates (1903–1932). The college, which was established as an institution of higher learning independent of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) yet holding a significant number of missionaries among its faculty in its earlier years, adopted an entirely secular and non-denominational educational model in 1923 in compliance with the new republican principles of Turkey.

Before 1971, Robert College, had junior high school, high school, and university sections under the names &quot;Robert Academy&quot;, &quot;Robert College&quot;, and &quot;Robert College Yüksek Okulu (&quot;&quot;Yüksek Okul&quot; may be translated as &quot;school of higher education&quot; in Turkish&quot;)&quot;. In 1971, the Bebek campus and academic staff of Robert College were turned over to the Republic of Turkey to be transformed into a public university named Boğaziçi University, the renamed continuation of Robert College&#x27;s university section (i.e. &quot;Robert College Yüksek Okulu&quot;). The rest of Robert College moved into the Arnavutköy campus of the American College for Girls; despite continuing to call itself a college it became merely a high school.&quot;

On 10 September 1971, Robert College bequeathed today&#x27;s South Campus of 118 acres, including buildings, the library, laboratories, and all facilities and personnel, to the Turkish government. Boğaziçi University was officially established as a Turkish public university. Since then, the university has gradually transformed from a small liberal arts college into a major research university.

=== Democratic Governance ===
At its inception, the university had a president and an administration, which was answerable to councils and committees made up of faculty members. All faculty, both senior and junior, attended the general assemblies, where important questions were discussed and decisions were made.

The 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état affected participatory democracy at universities negatively, as it did many other institutions. During the years of martial law, Boğaziçi University was under the administration of a rector externally appointed by the newly established Council of Higher Education. During the normalization of politics in the post-coup period, faculty members of BU proposed a system for the election of the rector in 1992. Accordingly, the faculty members were to elect the rector. The Council of Higher Education accepted this model for all Turkish universities with a slight modification, whereby the names of the three candidates with the highest votes were to be submitted to the Council of Higher Education. The council was to turn in one of these names, preferably the candidate with the highest vote, to the President of Turkey for appointment.To ensure that their candidate with the highest vote would be appointed as rector, upon request from the BU faculty, the rector candidates accepted an informal agreement to reject the appointment, in the case they did not come in first and their name was the one submitted to the President.

=== Seizure of Power ===
In 2016, the President did not appoint the Boğaziçi University candidate who received 86% of the votes but instead appointed Mehmed Özkan, the deputy of the former elected rector. Nevertheless, Özkan subsequently received a vote of confidence from the faculty.

The top-down appointment of Melih Bulu, an external candidate with close ties to the Justice and Development Party, on 2 January 2021 represented a radical and unprecedented intervention in the university&#x27;s governance. Resistance and acts of protest by faculty, students, and alumni immediately followed. More than 150 students were detained. The new rector dismissed the earlier faculty deans to appoint himself or candidates from outside the university to their positions.Bulu was dismissed from the rectorship by President Erdoğan on 15 July 2021. Following this, Naci İnci, another government-backed contender was appointed to the office, despite receiving a 95% no confidence vote and the existence of 17 alternative candidates approved by the faculty.

The imposition of Bulu and İnci as rectors in spite of outspoken opposition from the faculty signaled a political takeover of Boğaziçi. The extensive executive powers granted to rectors under the Higher Education Law (which were de facto never implemented at Boğaziçi University due to its democratic governance history and institutional practice) mean that the university has become a microcosm of the country&#x27;s one-man rule.

On 4 June 2024, the Constitutional court of Turkey, the highest court in the land, nullified the decree that allowed Erdoğan to appoint rectors. The annulment decision will come into force after 12 months, and the Turkish Grand National Assembly will have to make new legal regulations within this period. Nevertheless, on August 16, without waiting for any new regulation by the Parliament, Erdoğan appointed rectors to 13 universities. It has been noted that the appointed names were close to the government or directly from the AK Party.

Student and faculty resistance continues unabated in spite of legal bans. As of 2024, daily protest vigils had taken place for more than 1,000 days.

==== Administrative and Academic Interventions ====
Unprecedented academic interventions followed immediately after the appointment of the first imposed rector Melih Bulu who initiated a set of operations to transform the university&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot;. Such interventions continue in an accelerated manner under the second imposed rector, Naci İnci, since 15 July 2021.According to reporting by the Arab Studies Institute, “Decades-long procedures and rules concerning meetings, agenda setting, voting, and approval of minutes were consistently violated, Senate and Executive Board members being muted during on-line meetings and being treated with disrespect. Casting multiple votes to obtain favorable results in meetings became regular practice.”

Two new faculties and a graduate institute have been established by decree of the President of the State: the Faculty of Law, Faculty of Communication, and the Institute for Data Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence. Other faculties have been reorganized or disbanded. Notably, in spring 2024, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences was split in two, despite the unanimous objection of all the affected department heads.

In retaliation to the protests against the interventions of the new administration, a series of investigations were initiated against full- and part-time academicians, as well as retired and emeritus professors. Several faculty members were banned from teaching and entering the campus for months. The contracts of a number of teaching staff were not renewed; in cases taken to court, court decisions in favor of academicians were disregarded by the administration. The contracts of a number of academicians (both foreign and Turkish) were annulled. A number of retired and emeritus professors were banned from teaching and prohibited from entering the campus.

Across virtually all faculties and academic units, duly elected faculty and administrators have been purged, with deans, department chairs, and vice-chairs removed from office and replaced by appointment. These purges have continued into 2024. As many as 100 new faculty members have been added outside of normal protocols.

There has been significant and unprecedented disruption of both teaching and research activities. Notably, the administration has prevented the faculty from determining which classes will be taught, and by whom. In 2022, the offices of many research centers were evicted with very little or no notice. Belongings of the centers - files, documents, equipment, research projects, etc.-  were put in trash bags and dumped in remote locations on the campus.  The centers thus removed from their offices include The Istanbul Mathematical Sciences Center, Peace Education Application and Research Center, and Social Policies Forum, the Archive and Documentation Center (staff dismissed, archives transferred to the university library and documentation center), Byzantine Studies Research Center (despite donation from an international funding agency for hosting various activities and supporting researchers and students), Human Development Research Center (while organizing an international conference), the Nazım Hikmet Arts and Culture Research Center and Telecommunications and Informatics Technologies Research Center.

On 10 June 2022, four professors from the university&#x27;s Council of Information Technologies revealed the violation of General Data Protection Regulation rights of 60,000+ Boğaziçi members (students, academicians, personnel, and graduates). The whistleblowers have been met with reprisal including campus bans, lawsuits, and attempts to bar them from public service. Additional accusations of technical mismanagement have stemmed from an arbitrary and disruptive change to the university&#x27;s domain name.Finally, the seizure of the university also affected the institutional support system of the university such as the Boğaziçi Alumni Association which has been expelled from its social center in the main campus and the Boğaziçi University Foundation which has been taken over by the appointed administration by virtue of the right given to the rector by the original Trust Deed to periodically introduce new trustees.

==== Intervention in Campus and Student Life ====
Since immediately after Bulu&#x27;s appointment, the university&#x27;s campuses have been constantly surrounded by armed vehicles and police forces. The presence of increasing numbers of security personnel and plainclothes police officers in the campus is coupled with the installation of hundreds of surveillance cameras around the university premises.

Except for select members of pro-government media organizations, journalists are not allowed on the campuses. More than a hundred individuals with ties to Boğaziçi University, alumni, retired and emeriti faculty members, have been blacklisted by the appointed administration and are not allowed to enter the institution. A 2023 decision by the rectorate prohibited all retired and emeriti faculty members who are not currently teaching any courses from entering the university grounds. These measures have led to a serious depopulation of the campuses. As of July 2024, the situation had escalated to the point that even members of the Turkish parliament were being barred from attending ceremonies on campus.

Student life is being closely monitored by the usurping administration, with many students subjected to disciplinary investigation and punishment, and many student club activities constrained or censored. Especially vulnerable were members of the student LGBTI+ community, whose student club was banned, activities censored, and group members criminalized. In June 2023, the majority of student club offices located at a central dorm building located on the main campus (South Campus) were forcefully removed by security forces, and club facilities were relocated to a building situated at the fringes of the campus.

One policy element of the new regime is gender segregation of dorms and their removal from central campus grounds; as of Fall 2023, the South Campus has been exclusively reserved for women&#x27;s dorms. Gyms and pools have also had new rules instituted mandating gender segregation.

While the layout and texture of the historical core of the university remains intact, heavy security measures and police presence has had the effect of depopulating the campus and minimizing student socialization. Students, who made Boğaziçi a hub of vivid social and cultural activity, now prefer to spend time outside the campus grounds. Peaceful student demonstrations have been interrupted with force, as imposed rectors allowed anti-terror teams on the university grounds, resulting in the detainment and arrest of many students on different occasions.

==== Resistance, Protests, and Solidarity ====
The ongoing resistance to the seizure of administrative control, which began with the 2021 Boğaziçi University protests, has received support through declarations and awards by national and international academic institutions and associations. The violations of academic freedom at the university have received significant attention in the media as well.

Several mainstream TV channels have covered the resistance extensively on prime time news programs. Many TV stations have interviewed faculty members about the resistance. Many academicians have published articles in national and international press discussing the resistance and its rationale.

The means of resistance of the faculty members include refusal to cooperate with the imposed administration, daily vigils, weekly bulletins, lawsuits, public statements, departmental joint declarations, open courses and presenting and defending the BU case at international conferences and academic associations. Over 200 lawsuits have been filed against the appointed administration, including those by individuals, deans, and academic departments.

Alumni of Boğaziçi University have supported the resistance by joining the vigils, organizing various events and public declarations. A large number of national and international institutions, as well as individuals including Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, and Judith Butler have acknowledged and expressed their support for the resistance of Boğaziçi University.

== Campus ==
Boğaziçi University operates on seven campuses in Istanbul. Four of these campuses (South Campus, North Campus, Hisar Campus, and Uçaksavar Campus) are within walking distance to each other on a hill above the affluent district of Bebek on the European side of Istanbul, overlooking the Bosphorus, which is reflected in the name. All these campuses have been subject to major physical and functional transformations, with Uçaksavar Campus being reduced to a soccer field, after the §Seizure of Power.

The South Campus is considered to be the most popular Boğaziçi University Campus. It houses various historic buildings of Robert College, including Hamlin, Washburn, Theodorus, Dodge, Albert Long and Anderson Halls as well as the Kennedy Lodge, named after John F. Kennedy, and currently serving as a welcoming facility for visiting professors and staff.

The North Campus is home to Aptullah Kuran Library, which contains more than 740,000 printed books, 800,000 e-books, 55,000 e-journals as well as an extensive collection of Braille books, and a collection of rare books and manuscripts. However, in 2023 the building was evacuated and will be demolished due to earthquake risk. As of 2024, open shelf access has been suspended and library services minimized.

The Kandilli Campus is on the opposite side of the Bosphorus in Çengelköy, and hosts the historic Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute.

The Kilyos Sarıtepe campus, located on the Black Sea coast, is home to a private beach. It is the first self-sufficient university campus in the world, meeting all of its electricity demands from its own wind power plant.

In 2022, the Anadolu Hisarı Campus, which was previously under the administration of Marmara University, was transferred to Boğaziçi University.
== Dormitories ==
The university has ten dormitories on its different campuses. Boğaziçi&#x27;s First Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Dorms are housed in some of the oldest buildings in the historic South Campus and offer students the chance to participate in the university&#x27;s active social life.

There are also four dormitories on Boğaziçi&#x27;s North Campus. The First and Second North Campus Dormitories were opened in 198, the former for female students, the latter for males. They have similar 1980s modernist architectural designs. The Third North Campus Dorm was opened for female students in 2010. The Fourth Dormitory of the North Campus has been in service since 2011, and mainly accepts graduate students.
The Kilyos Campus Dormitories are approximately one hour&#x27;s drive away from Boğaziçi South and North campuses. The First Kilyos Dormitory serves female students while the Second Kilyos Dormitory is for males.

The Superdorm and Kandilli Dorms also provide accommodation to Boğaziçi University students. The Kandilli Dormitory for female students opened in 2017 on the Kandilli Campus. The waste water collected from the bathrooms at the Kandilli Dorm is reused in the toilet reservoirs after treatment.

== Music and sports festivals ==
Taşoda Music Festival is organized by Boğaziçi University Music Club every spring. It is the most important amateur music festival held in Turkey and takes its name from Music Club&#x27;s studio at the South Campus. Every May the Boğaziçi Sports Festival is held at the South Campus and other university venues. Usually, some 300 to 800 students from all over the world come to compete in various events.

==International rankings==
Boğaziçi University ranks first in Turkey and 197th internationally according to U.S. News &amp; World Report 2021 Best Global Universities Rankings, and shares the fifth rank among Turkish universities according to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings of 2021, with a global ranking of 601–800.

<text>Formation dance is a style of ballroom dancing. It is pattern or shadow team dancing by couples in a formation team. The choreography may be based on a particular dance or a medley of dances. Formation dancing may be done for exhibition or for competition between teams. There is also a type of formation in Bhangra.

==International style ballroom: dance sport ==

===History===
Formation dancing originated in 1932 in London&#x27;s Astoria Ballroom. It was Olive Ripman who introduced it under the name &quot;pattern dancing&quot;. Soon it became a competitive dance form.

Formation team contests began in the 1930s in England, and spread to many other countries. International matches have taken place. Formation dances were an important part of the BBC TV program &quot;Come Dancing&quot; when Frank and Peggy Spencer&#x27;s formation teams competed against Constance Millington&#x27;s team. The peak of popularity was in the 1960s, and is now growing from strength to strength with formation teams from all over the world competing against each other.

=== Choreography ===

The choreography of a formation team includes both choreography of a dancesport routine of an individual couple and the overall pattern of movements of the couples on the floor. All couples are expected to follow the beat of the music and movements should be executed simultaneously. Teams are marked on their synchronicity

Latin Dancesport formation is a medley of dances that include the 5 International Latin dances: Cha Cha, Rumba, Jive, Paso Doble and Samba.

Standard or Ballroom formation is a medley of the 5 international ballroom dances Waltz, Quickstep, Tango, Viennese Waltz and Foxtrot.

The routines generally feature at least some free-form choreography in the walk on and walk off, which may include movements from jazz dance, ballet, or any other type of dance. This is clearly marked by a gong.
A complete routine usually lasts a total of 6 minutes.

Formation routines allow dancers to show off their own technique in addition to their ability to move as a team.
Unlike individual competitions tricks such as &quot;round abouts&quot;, &quot;chain reactions&quot; form a large section of the choreography.

Shapes (also known as patterns or images) that are an accepted part of choreography are diamonds, squares, diagonals, circles and lines. The routine is judged by the distribution of competitors across the floor, how &quot;readable&quot; the patterns are and the transitions between these patterns.

Specialist formation choreographers include Ona Skaistutė Idzelevičienė, Roberto Albanese, Horst Beer, and Rachael Holland.

=== Competitions ===

The international governing body is the International DanceSport Federation (IDSF) (which has Olympic recognition). Competing teams must be a member of one of its member organisations such as the English amateur dancesport association ltd (EADA)

The following is a summary of the IDSF rules for European and World Formation competitions.
*Each member country may send 2 formation teams to compete in each of the 2 international styles (Latin and Standard).
*These are selected by national competitions, such as the British National Championships at the Blackpool Dance Festival.
*International competitions have a minimum of 4 countries
*The usual sporting anti-doping rules apply.
*All competitors must be amateurs.
*Each team must contain between 6 and 8 couples.
*In the standard section Men&#x27;s dress must be black or midnight blue.
*In Latin men may wear coloured shirts but all men must dress the same.
*In standard formation, solo work is restricted to 8 bars. This does not apply in Latin where solo work usually plays a part.
*Lifts are not allowed in the main &quot;judged&quot; part of the routine, but are usually allowed in the walk on and walk off, which is clearly marked by a gong.
*A routine is a maximum of 6 minutes long including entry to and from the floor (a walk on and walk off). Only minutes of this is judged so a gong is used to clearly signify which sections are to be judged.
*Competing teams are judged by those experienced in formation.

In early rounds, judges mark if they believe teams should go through to the next round. In final rounds teams are ranked and the skating system applies.

Other competitions of note are the Blackpool Dance Festival and the Donaupokal Invitational Competition Vienna.
Germany is notable in having several leagues of formation teams, and holds several competitions each year.

=== Formation teams, 2013===
This is a list of Adult Formation Teams competing in 2013 in the IDSF World Ranking Competition. There were 22 Latin Teams and 18 Standard teams that compete annually in the World Cup

<text>Charles Kinsey (1773June 25, 1849) was an American businessman and politician who served two terms as a U.S. Representative from New Jersey from 1817 to 1819, then again from 1820 to 1821.

==Early life and career==
Kinsey was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1773. He attended the common schools, and in early life engaged in the manufacture of paper. He moved to Bloomfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey and later to Paterson, New Jersey and New Prospect (now Waldwick), Bergen County, continuing in the paper industry.

In 1807 he invented a machine which allowed paper to be produced in one continuous roll. His correspondence with James Madison is in the Library of Congress.

==Political career==
Kinsey was a member of New Jersey General Assembly in 1812, 1813, 1819, and 1826 and served in the New Jersey Legislative Council (now the New Jersey Senate) in 1814. He was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the 15th Congress (March 4, 1817 - March 3, 1819), then elected to the 16th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of John Condit and served from February 2, 1820 to March 3, 1821.

==Later career and death==
After serving in the Congress, Kinsey continued to work in the paper industry. He then became a judge, serving as judge of the New Jersey Court of Common Pleas and of the orphans’ court of Bergen County, New Jersey from 1830 to 1845.

He died in New Prospect, New Jersey on June 25, 1849 and is buried in Union Cemetery, near New Prospect.

<text>Greatest Hits is a double-disc greatest hits album by American rapper 2Pac, released by Amaru Entertainment, Death Row Records, Interscope Records, and Jive Records on November 24, 1998.

The album&#x27;s non-chronological sequence focuses on the highlights of 2Pac&#x27;s career. 21 of his tracks are accompanied by four previously unreleased songs: &quot;God Bless the Dead&quot;, &quot;Unconditional Love&quot;, &quot;Troublesome &#x27;96&quot;, and &quot;Changes&quot;. Some tracks have alternate mixes, while the original mix of &quot;California Love&quot; makes its first proper album appearance after initially only being available as a single.

&quot;Changes&quot; earned 2Pac the first and only posthumous Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance. This is one of two 2Pac releases—and one of only nine hip hop albums—to have been certified Diamond in the United States.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; debuted at number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 268,000 copies in its first week. In January 1999, the album reached its peak at number three on the chart. It has spent 433 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On October 16, 2000, it was certified 9× platinum. Nearly 11 years later, in June 2011, it was certified by the RIAA for shipments of over 10 million, the late rapper&#x27;s first RIAA Diamond award. With 5.33 million units sold which is 10.66 million in RIAA sales, it remains the best-selling rap greatest hits compilation of all time and the twentieth best-selling rap album since Nielsen Soundscan began tracking record sales in 1991.

Tupac Shakur&#x27;s virtual appearance at the annual Coachella Festival on April 15, 2012, spurred a re-entry for the album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart; it jumped in at No. 129 with 4,000 copies sold according to Nielsen SoundScan (a gain of 571% over the previous week).

The album was certified Platinum by the BPI on 16 August 2002, making it 2Pac&#x27;s highest selling album in the UK.

<text>César Francisco Gerónimo Zorrilla (born March 11, 1948), known as César Gerónimo, is a Dominican former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder from through , most notably as a member of the Cincinnati Reds dynasty that won three National League pennants and two World Series championships between 1972 and 1976. He also played for the Houston Astros and the Kansas City Royals.

Although Gerónimo was not a prolific player on offense, he excelled as a defensive player, winning four consecutive Gold Glove Awards between 1974 and 1977. In 2008, Gerónimo was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Gerónimo was born in El Seibo, Dominican Republic. His father was a driver for a car service, shuttling passengers on the three-hour drive from El Seibo to the capital of the Dominican Republic, Santo Domingo. At age 14, César&#x27;s parents sent him to school at a seminary with hopes that he would become a priest. However, his athletic prowess continued to develop, especially in basketball. He didn&#x27;t start playing baseball until he was 17. Two years later in 1967, after scouts saw him play on his father&#x27;s softball team and recognized his prowess both pitching and hitting, he was signed to a free agent contract by the New York Yankees.

==Professional career==
The Yankees tried unsuccessfully to make Gerónimo a pitcher during his first professional season (1967). In spring training of 1968 he informed the Yankees that he wanted to end the pitching experiment, and later that year he was drafted out of the Yankees&#x27; minor league system in the Rule 5 Draft by the Houston Astros.

Gerónimo made his major league debut with the Astros on April 16, 1969, at the age of 21. He notched his first career hit five days later in the ninth inning when, pinch-hitting for Jack Billingham, Gerónimo doubled off the Reds&#x27; Wayne Granger.

On November 29, 1971, Gerónimo was involved in one of the most significant trades in the history of the Cincinnati Reds when he was acquired from the Astros along with Ed Armbrister, Jack Billingham, Denis Menke and Joe Morgan. The trade helped to transform the Reds into the juggernaut known as the Big Red Machine that would dominate the National League for the next five seasons. A winner of four consecutive Gold Glove Awards from 1974 to 1977, Gerónimo was an outstanding all-around defensive center fielder who combined speed and great range with a powerful arm. He was the starting centerfielder of Reds teams that won five divisional championships, three National League pennants and the 1975 and 1976 World Series. Geronimo was known as &quot;the Chief&quot;. In the 1975 World Series, he hit .280 with two home runs, but is best known for the iconic image of catching Carl Yastrzemski&#x27;s fly ball for the final out of the World Series.

Gerónimo had his most productive season in 1976, with career-best totals in batting average (.307), hits (149), bases on balls (56), triples (11), stolen bases (22), and on-base percentage (.382). The following season he hit a career-high 10 home runs.

He played the last three seasons of his career (1981-1983) in a reserve role with the Kansas City Royals.

In his 15 Major League seasons, Gerónimo batted .258, with 51 home runs and 392 RBI, 460 runs scored, 977 hits, 161 doubles, 50 triples and 82 stolen bases. Defensively, he posted a .988 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions.

Gerónimo holds the dubious distinction of being the 3,000th strikeout victim of both Bob Gibson and Nolan Ryan. &quot;I was just in the right place at the right time,&quot; he joked.

==Personal life==
After retiring, he worked for the Japanese Hiroshima Carp, as a coach in their Dominican baseball academy, and he has been on the board of trustees of the Dominican Republic Sports &amp; Education Academy. He currently resides with his family in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

In July 2008 he was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. He continues to return to Cincinnati for the annual RedsFest, Big Red Machine reunions and other appearances.

<text>Jean Chalopin (born 31 May 1950) is a French businessman, banker and former television producer. In 1971, he founded the production company DIC Entertainment, which specialized in children-oriented television and film productions. Through the company, he co-created successful television series including &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; (which grew into a namesake media franchise), &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Sonic Underground&quot;, and &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;; he also served as the co-writer and producer of &quot;The Mysterious Cities of Gold&quot;. He created a successor company, C&amp;D in 1987. DIC was dissolved into Cookie Jar Group in 2013, and he has since shifted focus onto a career in banking.

==Career==
In 1968, Chalopin formed an advertising company named the Office de Gestion et d&#x27;Action Publicitaire (OGAP, Office of Management and Advertising Action). In 1971, with the backing of the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion, Chalopin renamed the company to Diffusion Information Commercial (DIC, Commercial Information Dissemination) which later evolved into DIC Entertainment. At DIC, he wrote, developed and produced programmes animated by overseas studios. DIC&#x27;s first major series were the French-Japanese co-productions &quot;Ulysses 31&quot; and &quot;The Mysterious Cities of Gold&quot;, which Chalopin produced and co-wrote. Subsequently, he co-created &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; together with Andy Heyward and Bruno Bianchi; its launch in 1983, concurrently with &quot;The Littles&quot;, marked DIC&#x27;s foray into the American marketplace.

In 1987, Chalopin founded the company Créativité et Développement, aka C&amp;D (eng: Creativity and Development), after selling his shares in DIC, and continued to produce cartoons in the late 1980s and 1990s. C&amp;D had offices in Paris and Tokyo while setting up Jetlag Productions as its American affiliated company. C&amp;D had purchased the DIC library foreign distribution rights from Saban Entertainment soon after Saban had acquired them from DIC in 1987. In 1996, Chalopin sold the C&amp;D library to Fox Kids Worldwide, while the company itself was absorbed into Saban International Paris.

After moving to the Bahamas in 1987, Chalopin began investing in Deltec Bank and Trust, eventually becoming its largest shareholder and chairman. As chairman he sought out smaller cryptocurrency-related businesses, including Tether and its controlling company Bitfinex in 2018. At that time, Deltec was the only bank willing to work with the cryptocurrency.

Chalopin acquired Farmington State Bank (FSB), a single-location community bank in Farmington, Washington, in 2020. FSB, which until then had focused on agricultural loans, began to offer services to the blockchain and cannabis industries under the name Moonstone Bank. Among FSB&#x27;s blockchain activities, it accepted millions of dollars in investment capital and deposits from entities linked to the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. US federal prosecutors seized FTX-related funds from the bank in January 2023 after FTX&#x27;s failure, and FSB announced that it would return to community banking. Later that year FSB agreed to sell its operations and liquidate at the insistence of the Federal Reserve Board and state bank regulators.

<text>A blower door is a machine used to perform a building air leakage test. It can also be used to measure airflow between building zones, to test ductwork airtightness and to help physically locate air leakage sites in the building envelope.

There are three primary components to a blower door: a calibrated, variable-speed blower or fan, capable of inducing a range of airflows sufficient to pressurize and depressurize a variety of building sizes; a pressure measurement instrument, called a manometer, to simultaneously measure the pressure differential induced across the face of the fan and across the building envelope, as a result of fan airflow; and a mounting system, used to mount the fan in a building opening, such as a door or a window.

Airtightness testing is usually thought of in residential settings. It is becoming more common in commercial settings. The General Services Administration (GSA) requires testing of new US federal government buildings.

A variety of blower door air tightness metrics can be produced using the combination of building-to-outside pressure and fan airflow measurements. These metrics differ in their measurement methods, calculation and uses. Blower door tests are used by building researchers, weatherization crews, home performance contractors, home energy auditors, and others in efforts to assess the construction quality of the building envelope, locate air leakage pathways, assess how much ventilation is supplied by the air leakage, assess the energy losses resulting from that air leakage, determine if the building is too tight or too loose, determine if the building needs mechanical ventilation and to assess compliance with building performance standards.

==History==
In Sweden blower door technology was first used to measure building air tightness in 1977. The earliest implementation in Sweden used a fan mounted in a window, rather than a door. By 1979, similar window-mounted measurement techniques were being pursued in Texas, and door-mounted test fans were being developed by a team at Princeton University to help them find and fix air leaks in homes in a Twin Rivers, New Jersey housing development.

In Canada the initial concept similarly involved the use of a &quot;blower window&quot;, which was first utilized by G. T. Tamura in Ottawa, Canada, as part of a Division of Building Research study to test houses in Ottawa in 1967–1968 and was published in 1975.

In Canada, a team at the National Research Council of Canada&#x27;s Division of Building Research (NRC/DBR) in Saskatchewan, advanced the published work of Tamura in 1975 and went from a blower window to a blower door concept used in the construction of the Saskatchewan Conservation House in 1977. The Saskatchewan group was actively involved in the development of the blower door in 1977-78 and published their findings in 1980. They made available their flow nozzle to interested companies including one from Minneapolis. Harold Orr, who had been in Ottawa in 1967 when Tamura was conducting his work, continued to work on blower door technology after Tamura published his paper. Tamura&#x27;s blower window concept from 1967, preceded the Swedish work in 1977 by a decade. The first blower door was further used to test the airtightness of the Saskatchewan Conservation House built in 1977, which was tested at 0.5 ach at 50 Pa.

These early research efforts demonstrated the potential power of blower door testing in revealing otherwise unaccounted for energy losses in homes. Previously, air leakage around doors, windows and electrical outlets was considered to be the primary leakage pathway in homes, but Harrje, Dutt and Beya used blower doors to identify thermal bypasses. These bypasses were air leakage sites, such as attic utility chases, that accounted for the largest percentage of air leakage energy loss in most homes. Use of blower doors in home energy retrofitting and weatherization efforts became known as &quot;house doctoring&quot; by researchers on the east and west United States coasts.

The blower door first became commercially available in the United States in 1980 under the name Gadsco. Harmax started to sell units in 1981, followed closely by The Energy Conservatory in 1982.

While these blower door-testing efforts were useful in identifying leakage pathways and in accounting for otherwise inexplicable energy losses, the results could not be used to determine real-time air exchange in buildings under natural conditions, or even to determine average annual air exchange levels. Sherman attributes the first attempt at doing this to Persily and Kronvall, who estimated annual average air exchange by:

formula_1

formula_2 = Natural Air Changes per Hour [1/h]

formula_3 = Air Changes per Hour at 50 pascal [1/h]

Further physical modeling efforts allowed for the development and validation of an infiltration model by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). This model combined data derived from blower door tests with annual weather data to generate time-resolved ventilation rates for a given home in a specific location. This model has been incorporated into the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals (1989), and it has been used in the development of ASHRAE Standards 119 and 136. Other infiltration models have been developed elsewhere, including one by Deru and Burns at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), for use in whole-building performance simulation.

==How blower door tests work==

A basic blower door system includes three components: a calibrated fan, a door panel system, and a pressure measurement device (manometer).

===Test setup===
The blower door fan is temporarily sealed into an exterior doorway using the door panel system. All interior doors are opened, and all exterior doors and windows are closed. HVAC balancing dampers and registers are not to be adjusted, and fireplaces and other operable dampers should be closed. All mechanical exhaust devices in the home, such as bathroom exhaust, kitchen range hood or dryer, should be turned off. Pressure tubing is used to measure the fan pressure, and it is also run to the exterior of the building, so that the indoor/outdoor pressure differential can be measured. The exterior pressure sensor should be shielded from wind and direct sunlight. The test begins by sealing the face of the fan and measuring the baseline indoor/outdoor pressure differential. The average value is to be subtracted from all indoor/outdoor pressure differential measurements during the test.

===Test procedure===
The blower door fan is used to blow air into or out of the building, creating either a positive or negative pressure differential between inside and outside. This pressure difference forces air through all holes and penetrations in the building enclosure. The tighter the building (e.g. fewer holes), the less air is needed from the blower door fan to create a change in building pressure. Typically, only depressurization testing is performed, but both depressurization and pressurization are preferable. Different values for blower door metrics are to be expected for pressurizing and depressurizing, due to the building envelope&#x27;s response to directional airflow. The smallest fan ring that allows the fan to reach the maximum target indoor/outdoor pressure differential should be used. A multi-point test can be performed either manually or using data acquisition and fan control software products. The manual test consists of adjusting the fan to maintain a series of indoor/outdoor pressure differentials and recording the resulting average fan and indoor/outdoor pressures. Alternatively, a single-point test can be performed, where the blower door fan is ramped up to a reference indoor/outdoor pressure differential and the fan pressure is recorded. Often the blower door hardware converts fan pressure measurements directly to fan airflow values.

==Power law model of airflow==

Building leakage is described by a power law equation of flow through an orifice. The orifice flow equation is typically expressed as

formula_4

:formula_5 =Airflow (m3/s)
:formula_6 = Air leakage coefficient
:formula_7 = Pressure differential (Pa)
:formula_8 = Pressure exponent

The C parameter reflects the size of the orifice, the ∆P is the pressure differential across the orifice, and the n parameter represents the characteristic shape of the orifice, with values ranging from 0.5 to 1, representing a perfect orifice and a very long, thin crack, respectively.

There are two airflows to be determined in blower door testing, airflow through the fan (codice_1) and airflow through the building envelope (codice_2).

formula_9

formula_10

It is assumed in blower door analysis that mass is conserved, resulting in:

formula_11

Which results in:

formula_12

Fan airflow is determined using codice_3 and codice_4 values that are provided by the blower door manufacturer, and they are used to calculate codice_1. The multi-point blower door test procedure results in a series of known values of Qn, Fan and ∆Pn, Building. Typical ∆Pn, Building values are ±5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 pascal. Ordinary least squares regression analysis is then used to calculate the leakage characteristics of the building envelope: codice_6 and codice_7. These leakage characteristics of the building envelope can then be used to calculate how much airflow will be induced through the building envelope for a given pressure difference caused by wind, temperature difference or mechanical forces. 50 Pa can be plugged into the orifice-flow equation, along with the derived building C and n values to calculate airflow at 50 pascal. This same method can be used to calculate airflow at a variety of pressures, for use in creation of other blower door metrics.

An alternative approach to the multi-point procedure is to only measure fan airflow and building pressure differential at a single test point, such as 50 Pa, and then use an assumed pressure exponent, codice_7 in the analysis and generation of blower door metrics. This method is preferred by some for two main reasons: (1) measuring and recording one data point is easier than recording multiple test points, and (2) the measurements are least reliable at very low building pressure differentials, due both to fan calibration and to wind effects.

==Air density corrections==
In order to increase the accuracy of blower door test results, air density corrections should be applied to all airflow data. This must be done prior to the derivation of building air leakage coefficients (formula_13) and pressure exponents (formula_14). The following methods are used to correct blower door data to standard conditions.

For depressurization testing, the following equation should be used:

formula_15

:formula_16 = Airflow corrected to actual air density 
:formula_17 = Airflow derived using formula_18 and formula_19
:formula_20 = Air density inside the building, during testing
:formula_21 = Air density outside the building, during testing

For pressurization testing, the following equation should be used:

formula_22

The values formula_23 and formula_24 are referred to as air density correction factors in product literature. They are often tabulated in easy to use tables in product literature, where a factor can be determined from outside and inside temperatures. If such tables are not used, the following equations will be required to calculate air densities.

formula_20 can be calculated in IP units using the following equation:

formula_26

:formula_20 = Air density inside the building, during testing
:formula_28 = Elevation above sea level (ft)
:formula_29 = Indoor temperature (F)

formula_21 can be calculated in IP units using the following equation:

formula_31

:formula_21 = Air density outside the building, during testing
:formula_28 = Elevation above sea level (ft)
:formula_34 = Outdoor temperature (F)

In order to translate the airflow values derived using formula_18 and formula_19 from the blower door manufacturer to the actual volumetric airflow through the fan, use the following:

formula_37

:formula_38 = Actual volumetric airflow through the fan 
:formula_39 = Volumetric airflow calculated using manufacturer&#x27;s coefficients or software
:formula_40 = Reference air density (typically 1.204 for kg/m3 or 0.075 for lb/ft3)
:formula_41 = Actual density of air going through the fan formula_20 for depressurization and formula_21 for pressurization

==Blower door metrics==

Depending on how a blower door test is performed, a wide variety of airtightness and building airflow metrics can be derived from the gathered data. Some of the most common metrics and their variations are discussed below. The examples below use the SI pressure measurement unit Pascal (pa). Imperial measurement units are commonly water column inches (WC Inch or IWC). The conversion rate is 1 WC inch = 249 Pa. Examples below use the commonly accepted pressure of 50pa which is 20% of 1 IWC.

===Airflow at a specified building pressure===
This is the first metric that results from a Blower Door Test. The airflow, (Imperial in Cubic Feet / minute; SI in liters / second) at a given building-to-outside pressure differential, 50 pascal (Q50). This standardized single-point test allows for comparison between homes measured at the same reference pressure. This is a raw number reflecting only the flow of air through the fan. Homes of different sizes and similar envelope quality will have different results in this test.

===Airflow per unit surface area or floor area===
Often, an effort is made to control for building size and layout by normalizing the airflow at a specified building pressure to either the building&#x27;s floor area or to its total surface area. These values are generated by taking the airflow rate through the fan and dividing by the area. These metrics are most used to assess construction and building envelope quality, because they normalize the total building leakage area to the total amount of area through which that leakage could occur. In other words, how much leakage occurs per unit area of wall, floor, ceiling, etc.

===Air changes per hour at a specified building pressure===
Another common metric is the air changes per hour at a specified building pressure, again, typically at 50 Pa (ACH50).

formula_44

:formula_45 = Air changes per hour at 50 pascal (h−1)
:formula_46 = Airflow at 50 pascal (ft3/minute or m3/minute)
:formula_47 = Building volume (ft3 or m3)

This normalizes the airflow at a specified building pressure by the building&#x27;s volume, which allows for more direct comparison of homes of different sizes and layouts. This metric indicates the rate at which the air in a building is replaced with outside air, and as a result, is an important metric in determinations of indoor air quality.

===Effective leakage area===
In order to take values generated by fan pressurization and to use them in determining natural air exchange, the effective leakage area of a building must be calculated. Each gap and crack in the building envelope contributes a certain amount of area to the total leakage area of the building. The Effective Leakage Area assumes that all of the individual leakage areas in the building are combined into a single idealized orifice or hole. This value is typically described to building owners as the area of a window that is open 24/7, 365 in their building. The ELA will change depending on the reference pressure used to calculate it. 4 Pa is typically used in the US, whereas a reference pressure of 10 Pa is used in Canada. It is calculated as follows:

formula_48

:formula_49 = Effective Leakage Area (m2 or in2)
:formula_13 = Building air leakage coefficient
:formula_51 = Air density (kg/m3 or lb/in3), typically a standard density is used
:formula_52 = Reference pressure (Pa or lbForce/in2), typically 4 Pa in US and 10 Pa in Canada
:formula_14 = Building pressure exponent

It is essential that units are carefully conserved in these calculations. codice_6 and codice_7 should be calculated using SI units, and ρ and ∆PReference should be kg/m3 and pascal, respectively. Alternatively, codice_6 and codice_7 can be calculated using Imperial units, with ρ and ∆PReference being lb/ft3 and lbForce/in2, respectively.

The ELA can be used, along with the Specific Infiltration Rate(s) derived using the LBNL infiltration model, to determine airflow rate through the building envelope throughout the year.

===Leakage area per unit floor or surface area===
Leakage area estimates can also be normalized for the size of the enclosure being tested, For example, the LEED Green Building Rating System has set an airtightness standard for multi-family dwelling units of of leakage area per of enclosure area, to control tobacco smoke between units. This is equal to 0.868 cm2/m2.

===Normalized leakage===
Normalized leakage is a measure of the tightness of a building envelope relative to the building size and number of stories. Normalized leakage is defined in ASHRAE Standard 119 as:

formula_54

:formula_55 = Normalized leakage
:formula_56 = Effective Leakage Area (m2 or in2)
:formula_57 = Building floor area (m2 or in2)
:formula_58 = Building height (m or in)
:formula_59 = Reference height ()

==Applications==
Blower doors can be used in a variety of types of testing. These include (but are not limited to):
* Testing residential and commercial buildings for air tightness
* Testing buildings at mid-construction to identify and correct any failures in the enclosure
* Testing buildings for compliance with standards for energy efficiency, such as the IECC and ASHRAE.
* Testing building envelopes and window frames for water tightness and rain penetration
* NFPA Clean Agent Retention testing (this type of testing is usually described as a &quot;door fan test&quot; rather than a blower door test)
* Duct leakage testing of forced air heating/cooling systems - both supply (vents) ducts and return ducts can be tested to determine if and how much they leak air. A duct test can be combined with a blower door test to measure the total leakage to outside, measuring effective leakage to the outside of the house only.
* Finding air leaks in a building using an infrared camera while the house is depressurized. A blower door is not mandatory for an infrared reading, but the drawing in of outside air temperatures exaggerates temperature changes and facilitates the spotting of envelope leaks.

==NFPA enclosure integrity testing==
NFPA enclosure integrity testing is a specialized type of enclosure testing that typically measures the airtightness of rooms within buildings that are protected by clean agent fire suppression systems. This test is normally done during the installation and commissioning of the system and is mandatory under NFPA, ISO, EN and FIA standards that also require the test is repeated annually if any doubt exists about the airtightness from the previous test. These types of enclosures are typically server rooms containing large amounts of computer and electronic hardware that would be damaged by the more typical water based sprinkler system. The word &quot;clean&quot; refers to the fact that after the suppression system discharges, there is nothing to be cleaned up; the agent merely disperses into the atmosphere.

NFPA-2001 (2015 Edition) is used throughout North America, many Asian countries and the Middle East. A hold time analysis has been required since 1985. ISO-14520-2015 version or EN-15004 Standards are used throughout Europe while FIA Standards are used in the UK. Results from all these standards are very similar.

NFPA standards for equipment calibration are about the same as they are for other types of testing, so any modern blower door equipment is sufficiently accurate to perform NFPA enclosure integrity testing. Specialized software or a tedious calculation must be provided to arrive at the hold time which is generally ten minutes.

The NFPA standard requires that the blower door operator be trained, but does not specify the nature or source of this training. There is no official NFPA training available for enclosure integrity testing methodology at this time.

An NFPA enclosure integrity test result is typically reported in the form of an &quot;agent hold time&quot; which represents the duration for which the room will retain at least 85% of the design concentration in order to suppress a fire and to ensure it does not reignite. This retention time inversely proportion to the leakage area of the room which is the major factor. Location of leaks, height being protected, the presence of continual mixing and clean agent being used will affect the hold time also. The 2008 Edition of NFPA-2001 required a peak pressure evaluation in addition but the industry in the USA in particular has been slow to institute this important requirement since excessive pressure during discharge has damaged many enclosures. This requirement was designed to prevent that.

<text>Işık University () is a private university located in Istanbul, Turkey. The university operates under the Feyziye Schools Foundation&#x27;s Işık Schools, which originated with the establishment of the Feyz-i Sıbyan School in the city of Salonica, modern Thessaloniki, on 14 December 1885.

==History==
The history of the Feyziye Schools Foundation&#x27;s Işık Schools (Turkish: &quot;Feyziye Mektepleri Vakfı Işık Okulları&quot;) began with the establishment of Feyz-i Sıbyan School (Turkish: &quot;Feyz-i Sıbyan Mektebi&quot;) in the city of Salonica on 14 December 1885. Over time, additional schools were established in Salonica, including the Şemsi Efendi School, which was attended by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.After the Balkan Wars, when Salonica became part of Greece, the foundation relocated to Nişantaşı Naciye Sultan Mansion in Istanbul. In 1935, during the 50th anniversary of the school, the name was changed from &quot;&quot;Feyziye&quot; to &quot;Işık&quot;,&quot; both meaning &quot;light&quot; in Turkish, with the endorsement of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. To address the increasing demand for educational institutions, the foundation completed its Maslak campus in 1996.

Işık University was established at the Maslak campus at the beginning of the 1996–1997 academic year, marking a new chapter in the foundation&#x27;s history. Işık University is governed by a board of trustees, in conjunction with the university president and provosts and the deans of the various faculties. Today, the Feyziye Schools Foundation provides education at all levels, from preschool to graduate studies.

==Campuses==

Işık University operates two campuses. The Maslak campus is located in one of the business centers of Istanbul, while the suburban Şile campus, located out of Istanbul, opened its doors in 2003. The Şile campus has been planned as a complete “educational campus” with dormitories, social facilities, and educational and administrative buildings situated in an area of . In 2005 summer, most of the university&#x27;s academic and administrative departments (including the rector) moved to the Şile campus. Three faculties (Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences) and two institutes (Institute of Science and Engineering and Institute of Social Sciences) are located in Şile Campus, but the Faculty of Fine Arts remains in Maslak.

<doc id="606809" wikidata="Q829715" url="?curid=606809" title="Stereo Total">
<text>Stereo Total was a Berlin-based multilingual, French-German duo which comprised Françoise Cactus (born Françoise van Hove and formerly co-leader of the West Berlin band Les Lolitas) and Brezel (&#x27;pretzel&#x27;) Göring (aka Friedrich von Finsterwalde, born Friedrich Ziegler, ex-Haunted Henschel, Sigmund Freud Experience). 

Stereo Total&#x27;s social media accounts reported that Françoise Cactus died from breast cancer on 17 February 2021, aged 57.

Both Cactus and Göring sung and played multiple instruments. When they appeared on stage as a duo, Cactus frequently played drums while Göring played guitar and synth; at other times the touring band has included additional musicians such as Angie Reed.

Their early career was nurtured within Berlin&#x27;s easy listening scene, and they frequently supported the DJ team Le Hammond Inferno, who went on to form Bungalow Records and sign Stereo Total to their label. Stereo Total became the most successful act on Bungalow, finding an audience not just beyond Berlin but also across Europe and eventually in Japan, Brazil and the US.

==Musical style==
Their music is a playful, wildly eclectic mash-up of synthpop, new wave, electronica, and pop music. The most consistent element in their cut and paste compositions is a retro-hip European 1960s style, with references to psych and garage-rock as well as to 1960s French-pop in the vein of Françoise Hardy, Jacques Dutronc, France Gall, and Brigitte Bardot. Some of their most recognized tracks are kitschy lo-fi covers of pop, rock and soul songs, such as their self-consciously trashy version of Salt-N-Pepa&#x27;s electro rap hit &quot;Push It.&quot;

Their songs are primarily sung in German, French and English, but some of their output also features a number of other languages, such as Japanese, Spanish and Turkish. The band has covered songs by: Sylvie Vartan, Françoise Hardy, Brigitte Bardot, Brigitte Fontaine, Serge Gainsbourg, Johnny Hallyday, Velvet Underground, Nico, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Harpo, Pizzicato Five, Hot Chocolate, Die Tödliche Doris, Nina Hagen, KC and the Sunshine Band and Marjo (Corbeau).

==Songs used in advertisements==
&quot;I Love You, Ono&quot;—a re-titled cover version of &quot;I Love You, Oh No!&quot; by Japanese new wave band, Plastics—from their album &quot;My Melody&quot;, was used by Sony in a European commercial for the Handycam in June 2005, and was also featured in Robot Food&#x27;s snowboarding hit &quot;Afterbang&quot;. In 2009, the song was used in a Dell commercial for the Studio 15. In 2012 &quot;I Love You, Ono&quot; was used on the Dior Addict advert in the UK and Spain. In 2013 it was used as the theme music for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Anna and Katy&quot; – the choice of the show&#x27;s co-writers and performers, Anna Crilly and Katy Wix. The title of the Stereo Total version is a play on both the original Plastics title and Yoko Ono, and is a likely homage to the original&#x27;s Japanese origin.

Another one of their songs, &quot;L&#x27;Amour à trois&quot; (the French version of the song &quot;Liebe zu Dritt&quot;), was used in a commercial for 3G-phones in Sweden in the fall of 2005 by the company 3, as well as by the Spanish TV Channel Cuatro in an advert for the company and in the disco scene in the independent Argentinian film &quot;Glue&quot;. Their song &quot;Cannibale&quot; was included in the console game &quot;Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 4&quot;, released in November 2006. &quot;Megaflittchen&quot; was also used in a commercial by Estonian mobile operator EMT.

&quot;Aua&quot; from the &quot;Monokini&quot; album was used in the trailers and closing titles for Adam Curtis&#x27;s BBC Two documentary series &quot;All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace&quot;.

<doc id="606810" wikidata="Q1669589" url="?curid=606810" title="Classical archaeology">
<text>Classical archaeology is the archaeological investigation of the Mediterranean civilizations of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Nineteenth-century archaeologists such as Heinrich Schliemann were drawn to study the societies they had read about in Latin and Greek texts. Many universities and foreign nations maintain excavation programs and schools in the area – such is the enduring appeal of the region&#x27;s archaeology.

==Cultures discussed==
Classical archaeology in its strictest, most traditional sense applies only to the study of Classical Athenian culture and the culture of the Roman Republic and Empire. However, over the course of the last century, the field has expanded to include discussions of the elaborate mosaic of cultures that produced the civilizations of Ancient Greece and Rome. Classical archaeologists interested in Greece frequently discuss Crete and the Minoan civilization present on that island during the Bronze Age. They also discuss the Helladic and Geometric periods, as well as occasionally discussing the Neolithic period as it pertains to Greece. Even during the Classical period, it is completely untrue to say that Greece had one true culture – a great deal of regional variation was present, and much of the study of Greek archaeology lies in examination of these regional differences. Greek archaeology covers the Hellenistic period as well, frequently compelling the classical archaeologist to examine the Greek influences present in all the areas that were part of Alexander the Great&#x27;s empire, including much of the Middle East and Egypt.

Classical archaeologists interested in Roman civilization discuss the influence of the Etruscans and other early cultures present on the Italic Peninsula. They also discuss the subcultures present within the Roman Republic and Empire based on regional differences, and any discussion of the later empire requires at least a partial segue into the Byzantine Empire.

==Excavations==
While inspired by ancient texts and sometimes using them to interpret artifacts, classical archaeology would not exist without ancient artifacts. Though much of classical archaeology (like any kind of archaeology) is performed by scholars in their studies, the most vibrant and crucial parts of classical archaeology are the archaeological excavations, more commonly known as &quot;digs&quot;. Excavation techniques at first were modelled after excavations in Egypt and the Near East and searched for large artifacts and walls without much care for the delicate remains that might have existed in the ground around these artifacts. Many of the earliest sites still cannot be dated in a satisfying manner because the stratigraphy, soil layers with embedded artifacts used to determine the age of a site, was completely stripped away. Early excavations also often failed to record the items they found in sufficient detail, making it difficult to date artifacts, determine precisely where they were found, or establish a connection between objects that may have been found together. Over time, excavation techniques have greatly improved and the amount of information gleaned from each excavation is exponentially greater than that recorded in early excavations. While excavation reports now take many years to compile due to the level of detail included and analyzed.

<text>The Federal Register (FR or sometimes Fed. Reg.) is the official journal of the federal government of the United States that contains government agency rules, proposed rules, and public notices. It is published every weekday, except on federal holidays. The final rules promulgated by a federal agency and published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; are ultimately reorganized by topic or subject matter and codified in the &quot;Code of Federal Regulations&quot; (CFR), which is updated quarterly.

The &quot;Federal Register&quot; is compiled by the Office of the Federal Register (within the National Archives and Records Administration) and is printed by the Government Publishing Office. There are no copyright restrictions on the &quot;Federal Register&quot;; as a work of the U.S. government, it is in the public domain.

==Contents==
The &quot;Federal Register&quot; provides a means for the government to announce to the public changes to government requirements, policies, and guidance. 
* Proposed new rules and regulations
* Final rules
* Changes to existing rules
* Notices of meetings and adjudicatory proceedings
* Presidential documents including executive orders, proclamations and administrative orders.

Both proposed and final government rules are published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot;. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (or &quot;NPRM&quot;) typically requests public comment on a proposed rule and provides notice of any public meetings where a proposed rule will be discussed. The public comments are considered by the issuing government agency, and the text of a final rule along with a discussion of the comments is published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot;. Any agency proposing a rule in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; must provide contact information for people and organizations interested in making comments to the agencies and the agencies are required to address these concerns when it publishes its final rule on the subject.

The notice and comment process, as outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, gives the people a chance to participate in agency rulemaking. Publication of documents in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; also constitutes constructive notice, and its contents are judicially noticed.

The &quot;United States Government Manual&quot; is published as a special edition of the &quot;Federal Register&quot;. Its focus is on programs and activities.

== Format ==
Each daily issue of the printed &quot;Federal Register&quot; is organized into four categories:

* Presidential Documents (executive orders and proclamations)
* Rules and Regulations (including policy statements and interpretations of rules by federal agencies)
* Proposed Rules (including petitions to agencies from the public)
* Notices (such as scheduled hearings and meetings open to the public and grant applications)

Citations from the &quot;Federal Register&quot; are [volume] FR [page number] ([date]), &quot;e.g.&quot;, 71 FR 24924 (April 7, 2006).

The final rules promulgated by a federal agency and published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; are ultimately reorganized by topic or subject matter and re-published (or &quot;codified&quot;) in the &quot;Code of Federal Regulations&quot; (CFR), which is updated annually.

== Availability ==
Copies of the &quot;Federal Register&quot; may be obtained from the U.S. Government Publishing Office. Most law libraries associated with an American Bar Association-accredited law school will also have a set, as will federal depository libraries.

=== Free sources ===
The &quot;Federal Register&quot; has been available online since 1994. Federal depository libraries within the U.S. also receive copies of the text, either in paper or microfiche format. Outside the U.S., some major libraries may also carry the &quot;Federal Register&quot;.

As part of the Federal E-Government eRulemaking Initiative, the web site Regulations.gov was established in 2003 to enable easy public access to agency dockets on rulemaking projects including the published &quot;Federal Register&quot; document. The public can use Regulations.gov to access entire rulemaking dockets from participating Federal agencies to include providing on-line comments directly to those responsible for drafting the rulemakings. To help federal agencies manage their dockets, the Federal Docket Management System (FDMS) was launched in 2005 and is the agency side of regulations.gov.

In April 2009, Citation Technologies created a free, searchable website for &quot;Federal Register&quot; articles dating from 1996 to the present.

GovPulse.us, a finalist in the Sunlight Foundation&#x27;s Apps for America 2, provided a Web 2.0 interface to the &quot;Federal Register&quot;, including sparklines of agency activity and maps of current rules, but is no longer available.

On July 25, 2010, the Federal Register 2.0 website went live. The new website is a collaboration between the developers who created GovPulse.us, the Government Publishing Office and the National Archives and Records Administration.

On August 1, 2011, the Federal Register announced a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate programmatic access to the Federal Register content. The API is fully RESTful, utilizing the HATEOAS architecture with results delivered in the JSON format. Details are available at the developers page and Ruby and Python client libraries are available.

=== Paid sources ===
In addition to purchasing printed copies or subscriptions, the contents of the &quot;Federal Register&quot; can be acquired via several commercial databases:
* Citation Technologies offers the complete Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs) through subscription-based web portals such as CyberRegs.
* HeinOnline (1936–): Full coverage available dating back to 1936 in an image-based searchable PDF format.
* LexisNexis (July 1, 1980–): Searchable text format since .
* Westlaw (January 1, 1981–): Searchable text format since . The Unified Agenda and the official English text of the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, which became effective January 1, 1988, are included. Sunshine Act Meeting Notices are not available prior to 1991. Unified Agenda documents are not available prior to October 1989.

== History ==
The &quot;Federal Register&quot; system of publication was created on July 26, 1935, under the Federal Register Act. The first issue of the &quot;Federal Register&quot; was published on March 16, 1936. In 1946 the Administrative Procedure Act required agencies to publish more information related to their rulemaking documents in the &quot;Federal Register&quot;.

<text>The Bardo Thodol (, &#x27;Liberation through hearing during the intermediate state&#x27;), commonly known in the West as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, is a terma text from a larger corpus of teachings, the &quot;Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones&quot;, revealed by Karma Lingpa (1326–1386). It is the best-known work of Nyingma literature. In 1927, the text was one of the first examples of both Tibetan and Vajrayana literature to be translated into a European language and arguably continues to this day to be the best known.

The Tibetan text describes, and is intended to guide one through, the experiences that the consciousness has after death, in the bardo, the interval between death and the next rebirth. The text also includes chapters on the signs of death and rituals to undertake when death is closing in or has taken place. The text can be used as either an advanced practice for trained meditators or to support the uninitiated during the death experience.

==Etymology==
&quot;Bar do thos grol&quot; () translates as: “Liberation (grol) through Hearing (thos) in the Intermediate State (bardo)”

* The Tibetan &quot;bar&quot; and its Sanskrit equivalent &quot;antarā&quot; mean ‘between.’ The Sanskrit &quot;bhava&quot; means a place of existence. Thus &quot;antarābhava&quot; means ‘an existence between,’ translated into Tibetan as &quot;bardo&quot;. 
* &quot;thos grol&quot;: &quot;thos&quot; means &quot;hearing&quot;. &quot;Grol&quot; means ‘liberation,’ which may be understood in this context as being synonymous with the Sanskrit &quot;bodhi&quot;, &quot;awakening&quot;, &quot;understanding&quot;, &quot;enlightenment&quot;, as well as with the term &quot;nirvāṇa&quot;, &quot;blowing out&quot;, &quot;extinction&quot;, &quot;the extinction of illusion&quot;. &quot;Grol&quot; has connotations of freeing, liberating, unravelling, becoming undone.

==Original text==

===Origins and dating===

According to Tibetan tradition, the &quot;Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State&quot; was composed in the 8th century by Padmasambhava, written down by his primary student, Yeshe Tsogyal, buried in the Gampo hills in central Tibet and subsequently discovered by a Tibetan terton, Karma Lingpa, in the 14th century.

===&quot;bar do thos grol&quot;===
The Tibetan title is &quot;bar do thos grol&quot;, &quot;Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State&quot;. It consists of two comparatively long texts:
* &quot;Great Liberation through Hearing: The Supplication of the Bardo of Dharmata&quot; (&quot;chos nyid bar do&#x27;i gsol &#x27;debs thos grol chen mo&quot;), the bardo of dharmata (including the bardo of dying); 
* &quot;Great Liberation through Hearing: The Supplication Pointing Out the Bardo of Existence&quot; (&quot;strid pa&#x27;i bar do ngo sprod gsol &#x27;debs thos grol chen mo&quot;), the bardo of existence. 
Within the texts themselves, the two combined are referred to as &quot;Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo&quot;, &quot;Great Liberation through Hearing&quot;, or just &quot;Liberation through Hearing&quot;.

===&quot;kar-gling zhi-khro&quot;===

It is part of a larger terma cycle, &quot;Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones&quot; (&quot;zab-chos zhi khro dgongs pa rang grol&quot;, also known as &quot;kar-gling zhi-khro)&quot;, popularly known as &quot;Karma Lingpa&#x27;s Peaceful and Wrathful Ones.&quot;

The &quot;Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation&quot; is known in several versions, containing varying numbers of sections and subsections, and arranged in different orders, ranging from around ten to thirty-eight titles. The individual texts cover a wide range of subjects, including meditation instructions, visualizations of deities, liturgies and prayers, lists of mantras, descriptions of the signs of death, indications of future rebirth, and texts such as the &quot;bar do thos grol&quot; that are concerned with the bardo-state.

===Three bardos===

The &quot;Bardo Thodol&quot; differentiates the intermediate state between lives into three bardos: 
# The &quot;chikhai bardo&quot; or &quot;bardo of the moment of death&quot;, which features the experience of the &quot;clear light of reality&quot;, or at least the nearest approximation of which one is spiritually capable;
# The &quot;chonyid bardo&quot; or &quot;bardo of the experiencing of reality&quot;, which features the experience of visions of various Buddha forms, or the nearest approximations of which one is capable;
# The &quot;sidpa bardo&quot; or &quot;bardo of rebirth&quot;, which features karmically impelled hallucinations which eventually result in rebirth, typically yab-yum imagery of men and women passionately entwined.

The &quot;Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State&quot; also mentions three other bardos:
# &quot;Life&quot;, or ordinary waking consciousness; 
# &quot;Dhyana&quot; (meditation); 
# &quot;Dream&quot;, the dream state during normal sleep.

Together these &quot;six bardos&quot; form a classification of states of consciousness into six broad types. Any state of consciousness can form a type of &quot;intermediate state&quot;, intermediate between other states of consciousness. Indeed, one can consider any momentary state of consciousness a bardo, since it lies between our past and future existences; it provides us with the opportunity to experience reality, which is always present but obscured by the projections and confusions that are due to our previous unskillful actions.

==English translations==

===Evans-Wentz&#x27;s &quot;The Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;===

The &quot;bar do thos grol&quot; has become known in the English speaking world as &quot;The Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;, a title popularized by Walter Evans-Wentz&#x27;s edition, after the &quot;Egyptian Book of the Dead&quot;, though the English title bears no relationship with the Tibetan&#x27;s, as outlined above. The Evans-Wentz edition was first published in 1927 by Oxford University Press. 

According to John Myrdhin Reynolds, Evans-Wentz&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot; introduced a number of misunderstandings about Dzogchen. In fact, Evans-Wentz collected seven texts about visualization of the after-death experiences and he introduced this work collection as &quot;The Tibetan Book of Death.&quot; Evans-Wentz was well acquainted with Theosophy and used this framework to interpret the translation of &quot;The Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;, which was largely provided by two Tibetan lamas who spoke English, Lama Sumdhon Paul and Lama Lobzang Mingnur Dorje. Evans-Wentz was not familiar with Tibetan Buddhism, and his view of Tibetan Buddhism was &quot;fundamentally neither Tibetan nor Buddhist, but Theosophical and Vedantist.&quot; He introduced a terminology into the translation which was largely derived from Hinduism, as well as from his Theosophical beliefs. 

The third revised and expanded Evans-Wentz edition of The Tibetan Book of the Dead contains a psychological commentary by Carl Jung in an English translation by R. F. C. Hull. The commentary also appears in the Collected Works. Jung applied his extensive knowledge of eastern religion to craft a commentary specifically aimed at a western audience unfamiliar with eastern religious tradition in general and Tibetan Buddhism specifically. He does not attempt to directly correlate the content of the Bardo Thodol with rituals or dogma found in occidental religion but rather highlights karmic phenomena described on the Bardo plane and shows how they parallel unconscious contents (both personal and collective) encountered in the west, particularly in the context of analytical psychology. Jung’s comments should be taken strictly within the realm of psychology, and not that of theology or metaphysics. Indeed, he warns repeatedly of the dangers for western man in the wholesale adoption of eastern religious traditions such as yoga.

===&quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot;===
&quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot;, published in 1964, is a guide for LSD trips, written by Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert (later known as Ram Dass), loosely based on Evan-Wentz&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;. Aldous Huxley introduced the &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot; to Timothy Leary. According to Leary, Metzner and Alpert, the &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot; is 
They construed the effect of LSD as a &quot;stripping away&quot; of ego-defenses, finding parallels between the stages of death and rebirth in the &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;, and the stages of psychological &quot;death&quot; and &quot;rebirth&quot; which Leary had identified during his research. According to Leary, Metzner and Alpert it is:

<doc id="606821" wikidata="Q156859" url="?curid=606821" title="Assyriology">
<text>Assyriology (from Greek , &quot;Assyriā&quot;; and , &quot;-logia&quot;), also known as Cuneiform studies or Ancient Near East studies, is the archaeological, anthropological, historical, and linguistic study of the cultures that used cuneiform writing. The field covers Pre Dynastic Mesopotamia, Sumer, the early Sumero-Akkadian city-states, the Akkadian Empire, Ebla, the Akkadian and Imperial Aramaic speaking states of Assyria, Babylonia and the Sealand Dynasty, the migrant foreign dynasties of southern Mesopotamia, including the Gutians, Amorites, Kassites, Arameans, Suteans and Chaldeans. Assyriology can be included to cover Neolithic pre-Dynastic cultures dating to as far back as 8000 BC, to the Islamic Conquest of the 7th century AD, so the topic is significantly wider than that implied by the root &quot;Assyria&quot;.

The large number of cuneiform clay tablets preserved by these Sumero-Akkadian and Assyro-Babylonian cultures provide an extremely large resource for the study of the period. The region&#x27;s, and the world&#x27;s first cities and city-states like Ur are archaeologically invaluable for studying the growth of urbanization.
Scholars of Assyriology develop proficiency in the two main languages of Mesopotamia: Akkadian (including its major dialects) and Sumerian. Familiarity with neighbouring languages such as Biblical Hebrew, Hittite, Elamite, Hurrian, Indo-Anatolian (also called &quot;Indo-Hittite&quot;), Imperial Aramaic, Eastern Aramaic dialects, Old Persian, and Canaanite are useful for comparative purposes, and the knowledge of writing systems that use several hundred core signs. There now exist many important grammatical studies and lexical aids. Although scholars can draw from a large corpus of literature, some tablets are broken, or in the case of literary texts where there may be many copies the language and grammar are often arcane. Scholars must be able to read and understand modern English, French, and German, as important references, dictionaries, and journals are published in those languages.

==Terminology==
The term was first used by Ernest Renan in 1859 as a parallel to the term Egyptology, in a discussion of the translation of Assyrian terms from other cuneiform languages. By 1897 Fritz Hommel described the term as misleading, and today the International Association for Assyriology itself calls the term &quot;old-fashioned&quot;.

The term is widely considered ambiguous, being defined in different ways by different scholars in the field. Today, alternate terms such as &quot;cuneiform studies&quot; or &quot;study of the Ancient Near East&quot; are also used.

Originally Assyriology referred primarily to the study of the texts in the Assyrian language discovered in quantity in the north of modern-day Iraq, ancient Assyria, following their initial discovery at Khorsabad in 1843. Although the decipherment of Old Persian cuneiform had taken place prior, much of the subsequent decipherment of cuneiform was carried out using the multilingual Achaemenid royal inscriptions, comparing the previously deciphered Persian with the Assyrian cuneiform where used in parallel scripts. Usage of the term began to expand after it was noticed that, in addition to Old Persian and Assyrian, the cuneiform script had been used for a sister language, Babylonian. Babylonian and Assyrian had diverged around 2000 BCE from their ancestor, an older Semitic language that their speakers referred to as &quot;Akkadian&quot;.

From 1877, excavations at Girsu showed that before Akkadian, cuneiform had been used to write a completely different language, Sumerian. &quot;Sumerology&quot; therefore gradually became a branch of Assyriology. Subsequent research showed that during the 2nd millennium BC, cuneiform writing had also been used for other languages such as Ugaritic, Hurrian, Hittite or Elamite, which became subsumed under the increasingly ambiguous term Assyriology. Today the term designates the study of texts written in cuneiform script, irrespective of whether the script is from Egypt, Sumer, or Assyria.

==History==

===From classical antiquity to modern excavation===
For many centuries, European knowledge of Mesopotamia was largely confined to often dubious classical sources, as well as biblical writings. From the Middle Ages onward, there were scattered reports of ancient Mesopotamian ruins. As early as the 12th century, the ruins of Nineveh were correctly identified by Benjamin of Tudela, also known as Benjamin Son of Jonah, a rabbi from Navarre, who visited the Jews of Mosul and the ruins of Assyria during his travels throughout the Middle East. The identification of the city of Babylon was made in 1616 by Pietro Della Valle. Pietro gave &quot;remarkable descriptions&quot; of the site, and brought back to Europe inscribed bricks that he had found at Nineveh and Ur.

===18th century and birth===
Between 1761 and 1767, Carsten Niebuhr, a Danish mathematician, made copies of cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis in Persia as well as sketches and drawing of Nineveh, and was shortly followed by André Michaux, a French botanist and explorer, who sold the French Bibliothèque Nationale de Paris an inscribed boundary stone found near Baghdad. The first known archeological excavation in Mesopotamia was led by Abbé Beauchamp, papal vicar general at Baghdad, excavating the sculpture now generally known as the &quot;Lion of Babylon.&quot; Abbé Beauchamp&#x27;s memoirs of his travels, published in 1790, sparked a sensation in the scholarly world, generating a number of archeological and academic expeditions to the Middle East.

In 1811, Claudius James Rich, an Englishman and a resident for the East India Company in Baghdad, began examining and mapping the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh, and collecting numerous inscribed bricks, tablets, boundary stones, and cylinders, including the famous Nebuchadnezzar Cylinder and Sennacherib Cylinder, a collection which formed the nucleus of the Mesopotamian antiquities collection at the British Museum. Before his untimely death at the age of 34, Claudius Rich wrote two memoirs on the ruins of Babylon and the inscriptions found therein, two works which may be said to &quot;mark the birth of Assyriology and the related cuneiform studies.&quot;

===Decipherment of cuneiform===

One of the largest obstacles scholars had to overcome during the early days of Assyriology was the decipherment of curious triangular markings on many of the artifacts and ruins found at Mesopotamian sites. These markings, which were termed &quot;cuneiform&quot; by Thomas Hyde in 1700, were long considered to be merely decorations and ornaments. It was not until late in the 18th century that they came to be considered some sort of writing.

In 1778 Carsten Niebuhr, the Danish mathematician, published accurate copies of three trilingual inscriptions from the ruins at Persepolis. Niebuhr showed that the inscriptions were written from left to right, and that each of the three inscriptions contained three different types of cuneiform writing, which he labelled Class I, Class II, and Class III (now known to be Old Persian, Akkadian, and Elamite).

Class I was determined to be alphabetic and consisting of 44 characters, and was written in Old Persian. It was first deciphered by Georg Friedrich Grotefend (based on work of Friedrich Munter) and Henry Creswicke Rawlinson between 1802 and 1848.

Class II proved more difficult to translate. In 1850, Edward Hincks published a paper showing that the Class II was not alphabetical, but was in fact both syllabic and ideographic, which led to its translation between 1850 and 1859. The language was at first called Babylonian and/or Assyrian, but has now come to be known as Akkadian.

From 1850 onwards, there was a growing suspicion that the Semite inhabitants of Babylon and Assyria were not the inventors of cuneiform system of writing, and that they had instead borrowed it from some other language and culture. In 1850, Edward Hincks published a paper suggesting that cuneiform was instead invented by some non-Semitic people who had preceded the Semites in Babylon. In 1853, Rawlinson came to similar conclusions, texts written in this more ancient language were identified. At first, this language was called &quot;Akkadian&quot; or &quot;Scythian&quot; but it is now known to be Sumerian. This was the first indication to modern scholarship that this older culture and people, the Sumerians, existed at all.

===Systematic excavation===
Systematic excavation of Mesopotamian antiquities was begun in earnest in 1842, with Paul-Émile Botta, the French consul at Mosul. The excavations of P.E. Botta at Khorsabad and Austen H. Layard (from 1845) at Nimrud and Nineveh, as well as the successful decipherment of the cuneiform system of writing opened up a new world. Layard&#x27;s discovery of the library of Ashurbanipal put the materials for reconstructing the ancient life and history of Assyria and Babylonia into the hands of scholars. He was the first to excavate in Babylonia, where C.J. Rich had already done useful topographical work. Layard&#x27;s excavations in this latter country were continued by W.K. Loftus, who also opened trenches at Susa, as well as by Julius Oppert on behalf of the French government. But it was only in the last quarter of the 19th century that anything like systematic exploration was attempted.

After the death of George Smith at Aleppo in 1876, an expedition was sent by the British Museum (1877–1879), under the conduct of Hormuzd Rassam, to continue his work at Nineveh and its neighbourhood. Excavations in the mounds of Balaw~t, called Imgur-Bel by the Assyrians, 15 miles east of Mosul, resulted in the discovery of a small temple dedicated to the god of dreams by Ashurnasirpal II (883 BC), containing a stone coffer or ark in which were two inscribed tables of alabaster of rectangular shape, as well as of a palace which had been destroyed by the Babylonians but restored by Shalmaneser III (858 BC). From the latter came the bronze gates with hammered reliefs, which are now in the British Museum.

The remains of a palace of Ashurbanipal at Nimrud (Calah) were also excavated, and hundreds of enamelled tiles were disinterred. Two years later (1880–1881) Rassam was sent to Babylonia, where he discovered the site of the temple of the sun-god of Sippara at Abu-Habba, and so fixed the position of the two Sipparas or Sepharvaim. Abu-Habba lies south-west of Baghdad, midway between the Euphrates and Tigris, on the south side of a canal, which may once have represented the main stream of the Euphrates, Sippara of the goddess Anunit, now Dir, being on its opposite bank.

Meanwhile, from 1877 to 1881, the French consul Ernest de Sarzec had been excavating at Telloh, ancient Girsu, and bringing to light monuments of the pre-Semitic age; these included the diorite statues of Gudea now in the Louvre, the stone of which, according to the inscriptions upon them, had been brought from Magan in the Sinai peninsula. The subsequent excavations of de Sarzec in Telloh and its neighbourhood carried the history of the city back to at least 4000 BC. A collection of more than 30,000 tablets has been found, which were arranged on shelves in the time of Gudea ().

In 1886–1887 a German expedition under Robert Koldewey explored the cemetery of El Hiba (immediately to the south of Telloh), and for the first time made us acquainted with the burial customs of ancient Babylonia. Another German expedition, on a large scale, was despatched by the &quot;Orientgesellschaft&quot; in 1899 with the object of exploring the ruins of Babylon; the palace of Nebuchadrezzar and the great processional road were laid bare, and W. Andrae subsequently conducted excavations at Qal&#x27;at Sherqat, the site of Assur.

Even the Turkish government has not held aloof from the work of exploration, and the Museum at Istanbul is filled with the tablets discovered by V. Scheil in 1897 on the site of Sippara. Jacques de Morgan&#x27;s exceptionally important work at Susa lies outside the limits of Babylonia. Not so, the American excavations (1903–1904) under EJ Banks at Bismaya (Ijdab), and those of the University of Pennsylvania at Nippur between 1889 and 1900, where Mr JH Haynes has systematically and patiently uncovered the remains of the great temple of El-lil, removing layer after layer of debris and cutting sections in the ruins down to the virgin soil.

Midway in the mound is a platform of large bricks stamped with the names of Sargon of Akkad and his son, Naram-Sin (2300 BC). As the debris above them is 34 feet thick, the topmost stratum being not later than the Parthian era (HV Hilprecht, &quot;The Babylonian Expedition&quot;, p. 23), it is calculated that the debris underneath the pavement, 30 feet thick, must represent a period of about 3000 years, more especially as older constructions had to be leveled before the pavement was laid. In the deepest part of the excavations, inscribed clay tablets and fragments of stone vases are still found, though the cuneiform characters upon them are of a very archaic type, and sometimes even retain their primitive pictorial forms.

===Digital Assyriology===

also known as &quot;Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies&quot; (DANES). Analogous to the development of the digital humanities and accompanying the digitization of the subject, computer-based methods are being developed jointly with computer science, the roots of which can be found in the late 1960s in the work of Gerhard Sperl. In 2023, an open data set was published an used to train an artificial intelligence enabling the recognition of cuneiform signs in photographs and 3D-models.

<text>Palisade (originally called Palisades) is located in Eureka County in the northeastern section of the state of Nevada, in the western United States. It is about south of Carlin, and about southwest of Elko. Although now a virtual ghost town, it had a rich history following construction of the Transcontinental Railroad. The town takes its name from Palisade Canyon (also called &quot;12-Mile&quot; and &quot;10-Mile Canyon&quot;), an important obstacle to the construction and operation of the railroad, which lies to the west.

==History==
The Palisade community was founded in 1868 as a station on the Central Pacific Railroad. It soon became the transportation hub for Mineral Hill, Hamilton Eureka and other eastern Nevada mining camps. A post office was established at Palisade in May 1870. After the Eureka and Palisade Railroad was established here in 1874, Palisade&#x27;s population dramatically expanded. Houses and commercial stores were built and by the end of the 1870s, the town had multiple hotels, saloons, other businesses and residences. A school was built and the town had two churches. The local population reached 600.

Palisade was the site of an elaborate hoax during the early 1870s, probably to boost tourism. Whenever a train arrived, the residents were said to stage rampant gunfights and bank robberies. Nobody was privy to knowledge of the hoax except the residents, and the showmanship died off after several years. In reality, crime in Palisade was low and the town did not have a sheriff.

By 1882, the town had a new train station and telegraph office. The new station was used by both railroads. After 1885, the Eureka mines declined, as well as commercial train activity. With the decline of the railroad, and the subsequent loss of jobs, people in town started to move away. In 1908, a third railroad began running thru town when the Western Pacific built its line to transport people and goods to northern Nevada. In 1910, flooding destroyed most of the town and damaged all three railroad lines. The town never regained its success after the flooding of 1910.

In 1932, according to legend, Palisade may have been the site of a possible assassination attempt on the life of President Herbert Hoover. Shortly before Hoover&#x27;s train was to pass through the town, one railroad inspector said he encountered a vagrant by a trestle with 22 sticks of dynamite. Two men skirmished with the inspector and then fled, but another inspector disputed the story and said the vagrant did not have dynamite.

The Palisade post office was discontinued in 1961.

Since the 1920s, the town was owned by relatives of Atlanta businessman John Sexton, who sold the entire town at auction on April 26, 2005, in San Francisco. The town was sold to an unidentified bidder for $150,000. Sexton, who had not visited Palisade for some 35 years, said he sold the town to raise college tuition money for his daughter.

<doc id="606841" wikidata="Q12064297" url="?curid=606841" title="No. 99 Squadron RAF">
<text>Number 99 Squadron is a squadron of the Royal Air Force which operates the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III strategic/tactical transport aircraft from RAF Brize Norton.

The squadron conducts global deployments on behalf of the British Armed Forces and the UK Government, notably delivering emergency aid during natural disasters and supporting military operations overseas.

No. 99 was a bomber squadron in both World War I and World War II. The squadron was the first RAF unit to receive the Avro Aldershot, Handley Page Hyderabad, Handley Page Hinaidi, Vickers Wellington, Bristol Britannia and Boeing Globemaster III. In the case of the Avro Aldershot, the squadron was its only operator, as it is now for the Globemaster III.

==History==
===World War I===
What would later become No. 99 (Madras Presidency) Squadron was originally formed at Yatesbury, Wiltshire, England on 15 August 1917 from elements supplied by No. 13 Training Squadron, RFC. It was equipped with de Havilland DH.9 bombers in 1918, deploying to France to form part of the Independent Air Force, the RAF&#x27;s strategic bombing force. It flew its first mission on 21 May and continued to take part in large scale daylight raids against targets in Germany, sustaining heavy losses due both to the unreliable nature of the DH.9 and heavy German opposition. As an example, during one raid against railway targets in Saarbrücken on 31 July 1918, seven out of nine aircraft from 99 Squadron were shot down, with a further three DH.9s turning back with engine trouble before the formation crossed the enemy lines 99 Squadron was withdrawn from the front line on 25 September to be re-equipped with de Havilland DH.9A bombers, and it was still in the process of converting when the war ended. During the war it had taken part in 76 bombing raids, dropping 61 tons of bombs and claiming 12 German aircraft, of which eight were during the raid of 31 July.
In 1919 the squadron was sent to India, flying patrols over the North-West Frontier from Mianwali and Kohat during the Mahsud and Waziristan campaigns. It was disbanded by being renumbered to No. 27 Squadron on 1 April 1920.

===Inter-war period===
No. 99 Squadron reformed on 1 April 1924 at Netheravon, Wiltshire, flying Vickers Vimys. In May 1924, it moved to RAF Bircham Newton in Norfolk, uniquely receiving the Avro Aldershot single-engined heavy bomber. These were replaced at the end of 1925 by twin-engined Handley Page Hyderabads, the squadron moving to RAF Upper Heyford in December 1927. In 1929, it again switched to new aircraft when it began receiving Handley Page Hinaidis, a radial engined derivative of the Hyderabad. By 1933, the Hinaidi, which was little improvement over bombers in use during the First World War, was recognised as obsolete, and in November the unit received the first production Handley Page Heyford heavy bombers. While these carried twice the bombload of the earlier aircraft, and had significantly better performance, they soon became outclassed. However, 99 Squadron, which had moved to RAF Mildenhall in November 1934, was obliged to retain the Heyford until October 1938, when it converted to Vickers Wellington monoplanes. In September 1935, &quot;B&quot; flight of 99 Squadron was split off to form 38 Squadron, while on 12 April 1937 the squadron again detached &quot;B&quot; flight, this time to form 149 Squadron.

===World War II===

The squadron was the first unit to be equipped with Vickers Wellingtons, just before the start of World War II. It flew its first operational mission of the war on the night of 8/9 September 1939, when three Wellingtons set off from Mildenhall to drop leaflets over Germany. The squadron temporarily dispersed to RAF Elmdon (now Birmingham Airport) the next day before moving to a more permanent new home at RAF Newmarket, Suffolk on 15 September. On 14 December 1939, 12 Wellingtons of the squadron set off for an armed reconnaissance of the Schillig Roads, hoping to attack a force of German warships spotted by a British submarine the previous night. While the formation encountered the German warships, the cloud base was too low to bomb the ships, and five of the bombers were lost over the North Sea, one shot down by anti-aircraft fire, three by German fighters and one lost in a collision. A further Wellington crashed on return to base. The squadron was a part of No. 3 Group RAF, Bomber Command and bombed targets in Norway and Germany, mainly at night. It moved to the newly established base at RAF Waterbeach in March 1941.

In February 1942 the squadron moved to India with the Wellingtons, and resumed operations in November 1942 against Japanese bases in Burma. From September 1944 the squadron re-equipped with Consolidated Liberators which allowed it to reach targets in Thailand and Malaya. During this period, the squadron included a significant number of Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and Royal Canadian Air Force aircrew personnel, attached to it under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The squadron moved to the Cocos Islands in August 1945 to prepare for the planned invasion of Malaya. After the Japanese surrender the squadron disbanded there on 15 November 1945.
===Post-War===

The Squadron was reformed again on 17 November 1945 at RAF Lyneham, Wiltshire, as a transport squadron, equipped with the Avro York. In that rôle it contributed to the Berlin Airlift.
The unit continued in the transport role from 1949 to 1959 with the Handley Page Hastings, which was normally used as a transport aircraft but, as the squadron also had a tactical support role, was also used in 1956 to drop paratroops on Gamil Airfield during the Suez crisis.
From 1959 the squadron flew the Bristol Britannia, initially from Lyneham, then from RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, from June 1970. The unit put the new long range turboprop aircraft to use to evacuate citizens from troublespots all over the world such as Congo 1960, Kuwait 1961, Belize 1961 and Aden 1967. The Squadron was disbanded on 6 January 1976, following the 1974 Defence White Paper.

===C-17 Globemaster III (2000–present)===

The squadron was reformed again in November 2000, to operate the RAF&#x27;s Boeing C-17 Globemaster IIIs. The first of the squadron&#x27;s four initial C-17s was delivered to the RAF on 17 May 2001, arriving at Brize Norton on 23 May. One of the first high-profile missions of the squadron was the deployment of Westland Lynx helicopters and support equipment to Macedonia as part of a NATO peacekeeping force. This deployment was codenamed Operation Bessemer.

Previously the RAF had to lease commercial heavy lifters such as the Antonov An-124 to return the aircraft to the UK, or launch a major logistical effort to allow a ferry flight. In any case the C-17 has proved invaluable to the RAF and in December 2009, the Ministry of Defence announced its intention to acquire a seventh aircraft. This was received by the RAF at Boeing&#x27;s Long Beach, California facility on 16 November 2010. The UK announced the purchase of its eighth C-17 in February 2012.

On 13 January 2013, it was announced that two No. 99 Squadron C-17s were to be used to transport French military equipment and troops to Mali. On 15 November 2013, a C-17 of No. 99 Squadron flew to the Philippines to assist with aid efforts there after Typhoon Haiyan.

In August 2021, the C-17 was called upon to assist with Operation Pitting, the evacuation of Kabul. Four aircraft were deployed and the aircraft&#x27;s normal capacity of 138 people was increased and exceeded almost every day. On 24 August there were 354 persons on board, and by the close of the evacuation, 436 stood as the new record and the greatest number of people ever flown on a single RAF aircraft.

On 13 September 2022, C-17A &quot;ZZ177&quot; of No. 99 Squadron carried the coffin of Queen Elizabeth II from Edinburgh Airport to RAF Northolt in preparation for Her Majesty&#x27;s state funeral.

<text>Valentine Esegragbo Melvine Strasser (born 26 April 1967) is a former Sierra Leonean military officer who served as head of state of Sierra Leone from 1992 to 1996. He became the world&#x27;s youngest head of state in 1992, seizing power three days after his 25th birthday.

Strasser was born and raised in the neighbourhood of Allen Town in the east end of Sierra Leone&#x27;s capital Freetown to Creole parents. He enlisted in the Republic of Sierra Leone Military Forces (RSLMF) at age eighteen, immediately after graduating from secondary school. In the context of the Sierra Leone Civil War which had erupted in the previous year, he led a coup d&#x27;état in 1992 which overthrew president Joseph Saidu Momoh. He then established the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) military junta. During the war, he hired Executive Outcomes, a South African mercenary firm to repel the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel group.

As the war continued, after nearly four years in power, Strasser was ousted in a second military coup in 1996, led by his deputy, Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio. Following his overthrow, he lived in England where he unsuccessfully sought asylum. He later unsuccessfully attempted to enter the Gambia in 2000 before eventually returning to Sierra Leone.

==Early life==
Valentine Esegragbo Melvin Strasser was born on 26 April 1967 in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, to parents from the Creole ethnic group. At the time of Strasser&#x27;s birth, Sir Albert Margai was the Prime Minister of Sierra Leone when the country was a parliamentary government. Strasser grew up in the neighbourhood of Allen Town, in the extreme East End of Freetown.

Strasser completed his secondary education at the Sierra Leone Grammar School in Freetown and graduated in 1985 at age eighteen. While in secondary school, Strasser was a gifted student in math and chemistry.

==Military career==
On graduation from secondary school in 1985, he enlisted in the Republic of Sierra Leone Military Forces (RSLMF) at the age of eighteen during the government of President Siaka Stevens, and was deployed for military training as a cadet officer at the Benguema Military Training Academy in Benguema, a town located just outside Freetown. After his training, he was commissioned into the Sierra Leone army at the young age of nineteen. He was posted to a military barracks in Daru, Kailahun District in Eastern Sierra Leone.

The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) led by Foday Sankoh began their first attack on 25 March 1991 in Buedu villages in Kailahun District. Strasser and other soldiers who were already in a military barracks in Kailahun, were sent to command and rout the rebellion against the RUF.

Before President Momoh was removed by his successor, Valentine Strasser fought against the Liberian invasion in Sierra Leone, particularly in the East and South of Sierra Leone. Strasser in his fight had to go up against domestic rebels, also known as sobels. President Momoh&#x27;s presidency was not long-lasting because he denied the demands of the people of Sierra Leone who at the time of his regime wanted a more cooperative political system and thought Momoh provided nothing different than his predecessor.”

==1992 coup and tenure as head of state ==
During Strasser&#x27;s time at the war front in Kailahun District against the RUF, the Government of Sierra Leone led by president Joseph Saidu Momoh hardly supplied enough boots to the soldiers and the necessary military equipment to help fortify Strasser and his fellow soldiers in the war against the RUF. The soldiers never received their salaries on time and their welfare was hardly at the top of the government&#x27;s list of priorities.

After many appeals, warnings or threats, the young soldiers decided to march down in their combat from Kailahun to the State House in Freetown on 29 April 1992, to protest about their setbacks in pursuing the war, demanding their outstanding salaries. The group of soldiers was led by Strasser himself and his two best friends and fellow soldiers Seargent Solomon Musa and Captain Sahr Sandy. The appearance of the soldiers in the capital city forced president Momoh to flee the country and he went into exile in Conakry, Guinea. This power vacuum motivated Strasser and his men to seize power, forming the NPRC, with Strasser as its leader and the Head of State of the country. Strasser became the youngest Head of State in the world at just twenty five years old.

==1996 coup==
In January 1996, after nearly four years in power, Strasser was ousted in another military coup, but this time it was his own NPRC members who were not satisfied with his handling of the peace process. The coup was led by his deputy, Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio, along with Colonel Tom Nyuma and Captain Komba Mondeh. Bio quickly rose as the leader of the coup, with the support of Nyuma and Mondeh and took over as Head of State of Sierra Leone.

==Post-leadership==
Following his overthrow, Strasser was given a fellowship by the UN to study law at the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, but stopped his studies after 18 months. In 2000, Strasser&#x27;s application for asylum in England was rejected; he then left for the Gambia, only to be denied entry. He eventually returned to Sierra Leone, where he lived in poverty on a small pension in Grafton, east of Freetown, and worked at the ICT Institute providing computer skills for youths.

In January 2019, he fell gravely ill and was flown to Ghana for treatment. His left leg was partially amputated due to peripheral artery disease. After undergoing rehabilitation, he returned to Sierra Leone in July 2021, and received an apartment from President Bio. Amadu Makalo Koita, a member of the opposition All People&#x27;s Congress, later alleged that the government was keeping Strasser under house arrest.

<text>Joseph Nicholas Gallo (The Betrayer) (January 8, 1912 – September 1, 1995) was a New York mobster who served as consigliere of the Gambino crime family under three different bosses.

Joseph N. Gallo was not related to Joe Gallo of the Colombo crime family.

==Biography==
Joseph N. Gallo was born on January 8, 1912, in Calabria, but grew up in the Little Italy section of Manhattan. Gallo was married and was the father of Gambino associate Joseph C. Gallo. Joseph N. Gallo and his family lived in Mill Basin, Brooklyn and Long Island City, Queens.

In the 1930s, Gallo was convicted in New York of illegal gambling.

Over the years, Gallo built his power base in the New York garment industry. He owned a dress manufacturing company in Brooklyn and eventually controlled the Greater Blouse, Shirt, and Undergarment Association, a trade group.

Gallo also had strong ties with the Trafficante crime family of Tampa, Florida, and the New Orleans crime family boss Carlos Marcello. Gallo frequently represented their leaders at Cosa Nostra meetings in New York.

In the early 1970s, Gallo replaced Joseph Riccobono as consigliere under boss Carlo Gambino. Gallo was considered as a possible candidate to succeed the ailing Gambino. However, on February 21, 1974, Gallo suffered a severe heart attack. Gallo recovered from this illness, but decided that he did not have the will or stamina to be Gambino&#x27;s successor. After Gambino&#x27;s death in 1976, Gallo continued as consigliere for boss Paul Castellano. In 1986, after Castellano&#x27;s assassination, new boss John Gotti also kept Gallo as consigliere.

On December 22, 1987, Gallo was convicted of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act charges that included two counts of bribery and one count of illegal interstate travel to commit bribery. In February 1988, Gallo was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison and ordered to pay fines totaling $380,000. Before his sentence, he was released on parole to spend a last Christmas with his family, since at his age any sentence imposed on him would have assured he would die in prison. He became the oldest inmate in federal custody. In 1987, after Gallo&#x27;s conviction, Gotti replaced him with capo Sammy Gravano as consigliere.

In 1995, Gallo was released from prison. On September 1, 1995, Gallo died of natural causes in Astoria, Queens. He is buried in St. Michaels Cemetery in East Elmhurst, Queens.
