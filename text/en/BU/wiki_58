<text>Mokosh () is a Slavic goddess. No narratives about this deity have survived and scholars must rely on academic disciplines like philology to discern details about her.

According to etymological reconstruction, Mokosh was the goddess of earth, waters and fertility. Later, according to most researchers, she was reflected in bylinas and zagovory as Mat Zemlya. Another reconstruction was made on the basis of ethnography; at the end of the 19th century, the names kikimora as &quot;Mokusha&quot; or &quot;Mokosha&quot; were recorded in the Russian North. The coincidence is explained by kikimora being a demonized version of the goddess and, by approximating between the two, researchers have portrayed Mokosh as the goddess of love and birth, with a connection to night, the moon, spinning, sheep farming and women&#x27;s economy. Spinning was the occupation of several European goddesses of fate, which led to the characterization of Mokosh as a deity who controls fate. This reconstruction disagrees with data on her etymology, which shows spinning could not have been the deity&#x27;s main role. 

In 980, prince Vladimir the Great established a wooden statue of Mokosh, along with other deities, on a hill in Kyiv, Ukraine. Some historians have described this event as a manifestation of Vladimir&#x27;s pagan reformation but other scholars deny such a reformation was carried out, and the question of its existence is debatable in modern scholarship. In 998, during the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27;, statues of deities were destroyed. Mokosh was mentioned in various &quot;Words&quot; and &quot;Teachings&quot; against Paganism along with the vilas, but is not described by them.

In academia, the opinion the cult of Mokosh was passed to the folk-Christian Paraskeva Friday, which was associated with water and spinning, spread. Because of this identification, Friday began to be considered a day dedicated to the goddess, and a conclusion about the popularity of Mokosh among women in Christian times was drawn. In later studies, the idea of an approximation with Paraskeva was criticized because Paraskeva&#x27;s association with spinning, water, and Friday has Christian rather than pagan roots.

The Slavic version of the basic myth theory, based on ethnographic and linguistic data, depicts Mokosh as Perun&#x27;s wife. It is believed Mokosh cheated on Perun with Veles, causing Perun to kill Mokosh&#x27;s children. The theory has not been recognized in academia. The supposition Mokosh is depicted on the Zbruch Idol and on North Russian 19th-century embroideries has also been rejected. Archaeologist Boris Rybakov&#x27;s theory the goddess&#x27; original name was &quot;Makosh&quot; is not supported by other researchers.

== Name and characteristics ==
In Old East Slavic texts, the name &quot;Mokosh&quot; is rendered as &quot;Mokošĭ&quot; (), &quot;Mokŭšĭ&quot; () – in ancient texts uppercase was not used. According to Oleg Trubachyov, the form &quot;Mokŭšĭ&quot; was formed through the secondary adideation of &quot;*Mokošь&quot; and &quot;*kъšь&quot; &quot;fate&quot;. Grammatically, the theonym Mokosh belongs to the feminine gender, from which it is inferred that the deity was specifically a goddess. In older studies and later chronicles, she may have appeared to be a male deity, but this variant is secondary to the original. According to the most-reasonable etymology the theonym was formed by the suffixal method from the Proto-Slavic stem &quot;*mok-&quot; meaning &quot;wet&quot; with the suffix &quot;*-ošь&quot;. Vladimir Toporov and Vyacheslav Ivanov comment this etymology is &quot;indisputable&quot;, understanding her name as &quot;She who is wet&quot;. The first to put forward such an etymology was Vatroslav Jagić, who believed the theonym is a translation or an amplification of the Greek word &quot;malakiya&quot;, and therefore &quot;Mokosh&quot; was a literary fiction. Toporov, Ivanov and Max Vasmer consider Jagić&#x27;s position to be incorrect.

According to Michał Łuczyński, the theonym may have appeared after the 3rd century AD due to the occurrence of the [š] sound, which arose in Slavic languages as part of the first palatalization. He derives the name of the goddess from the unattested noun &quot;*mokošь&quot; &quot;someone/something wet&quot; because the suffix &quot;*-ošь&quot; forms the names of the bearers of features, and he drives this noun from the v-tematic &quot;&quot; ( &quot;*mokъve&quot;) &quot;wet place, mud&quot; ( Polish &quot;mokwa&quot;, Ukrainian ) and compares the name &quot;Mokosh&quot; to other names ending in &quot;-osh&quot; that are derived from v-thematic words with topographical meaning, Old Polish &quot;Bagosz&quot; (&lt; &quot;&quot;), &quot;Narosz&quot; (&lt; &quot;*nary&quot;). In connection with this etymology, he considers Mokosh to be a &quot;pluvial goddess with uranic characteristics&quot;. Similarly, understands the theonym to derive from a word meaning &quot;moist, swampy place&quot;. Toporov, Ivanov, and Łuczyński believe the theonym &quot;Mokosh&quot; is a later epithet that replaced the original, unknown name of the deity. Ivanov and Toporov compare the etymology with Lithuanian &quot;makusyti&quot; &quot;to splash&quot;, &quot;to walk on mud&quot;; &quot;makasyne&quot; &quot;slush&quot;, &quot;mud&quot;, &quot;mixture&quot;, &quot;mess&quot;.

Vasmer and many modern academics consider Mokosh to be the goddess of fertility, waters and earth, which brings her closer to the later Mat Zemlya, who is often mentioned in bylinas and zagovory. Aleksander Gieysztor commented that the association with Mat Zemlya is shared by most researchers. Mokiyenko and Henryk Łowmiański also suggested a connection with rain.

Linguist Andrey Zaliznyak and religious academic Andrzej Szyjewski have likened Mokosh to the Iranian Anahita because the latter is also called &quot;Wet&quot; or &quot;Broad ,Spread out&quot;. In a similar way, philologist Nikolay Zubov links her to the Scythian goddess of earth and water Api. On the basis of their approximation with Anahita, Toporov and Ivanov attribute the function of procreation to Mokosh and consider the goddess Zhiva to be her &quot;higher hypostasis&quot;, opposite to the &quot;low hypostasis&quot; that is Mokosh. Celtic academic likened Mokosh to the Irish goddess Macha, whom he believes was originally a fertility goddess. He elevated the theonym &quot;Mach&quot;a to &quot;*mokosiā&quot;, which &quot;corresponds exactly to the name of the Slavic goddess Mokosh&quot;, but another Celtic academic Garrett Olmsted derives the theonym &quot;Macha&quot; from the Proto-Celtic &quot;*magos&quot; &quot;plain, field&quot;.

=== Obsolete and questionable etymologies ===
Slavist put forward a hypothesis for the theonym&#x27;s origin based on parallels with the Baltic languages. According to him, the theonym &quot;Mokosh&quot; has a counterpart in Lithuanian in the words &quot;makstýti&quot; (&quot;to weave&quot;) &quot;mèksti&quot; (&quot;to knit&quot;), and &quot;mãkas&quot; (&quot;purse&quot;); related to the Russian (&quot;bag, purse&quot;), and thus the theonym comes from Proto-Slavic &quot;*mokos-&quot; (&quot;spinning&quot;, &quot;weaving&quot;). Toporov and Ivanov, who are proponents of the moisture etymology, &quot;rehabilitate&quot; Ilinsky&#x27;s etymology, seeing a connection in the Lithuanian stems in the words &quot;mazgas&quot; (&quot;knot&quot;); &quot;megzti&quot; (&quot;to knit&quot;, &quot;to tie&quot;) with &quot;mazgoti&quot; (&quot;to wash&quot;). ESSJa and Martin Pukanec called Ilinsky&#x27;s etymology &quot;hypothetical&quot;.

Boris Rybakov considered &quot;Makosh&quot; to be a more accurate reading of the goddess&#x27; name, dividing the theonym into two parts: &quot;ma-&quot; and &quot;-kosh&quot;, where &quot;ma-&quot; was short for &quot;mother&quot; (Old East Slavic мати, &quot;mati&quot;), approaching a certain Cretan-Mycenaean goddess named &quot;Ma&quot; in a culture very distant from the Slavs. He understood the second part &quot;-kosh&quot; as an Old East Slavic word meaning &quot;fate&quot;. Rybakov thus translates this theonym as &quot;Mother of good fate&quot;, identifying her with the goddess of fate, and also at the same time as &quot;Mother of good harvests&quot;, since fruit could be placed in the basket (see &quot;*košь&quot;), adding that Mokosh is also the goddess of fertility, as well as the &quot;Mother of luck&quot;, since, in his opinion, the harvest is luck. Leo Klejn, who sticks to the reconstruction of Mokosh as the goddess of women&#x27;s labor, particularly spinning, criticizes Rybakov, noting that such functions are not supported by anything. The etymology is also criticized: &quot;mother&quot; can be shortened to &quot;ma&quot; mainly in the language of children. Klejn points out that in Russian, compound words are constructed differently: the main noun stands at the end and the defining word at the beginning, and gives such examples as &quot;Bogo-matier&quot; and &quot;Daz-bog&quot;, so the expected form of a name would be &quot;*Koshma&quot;. The word is indeed found in Russian, but is of Tatar origin. The notation &quot;Makosh&quot; itself is not standard in chronicles, unlike &quot;Mokosh&quot;. ESSJa, Toporov, and Ivanov reject Rybakov&#x27;s etymology.

According to Nikolay Galkovsky, the name &quot;Mokosh&quot; was borrowed from an unknown source. Evgeny Anichkov believed that the name was derived from the ethnonym of Finno-Ugric group, the &quot;Mokshas&quot;, part of the Mordvins, which he believes explains why Vladimir the Great had to establish statues of Slavic gods: The gods of Vladimir&#x27;s pantheon were of non-Slavic origin, where Perun was said to have been brought from Scandinavia as the personal god of the Rurikids, and other gods established by Vladimir, such as Mokosh, were gods of peoples neighboring the Slavs, whose statues were established by Vladimir to centralize his power. Anichkov compared Finnish toponyms such as &quot;Moksha&quot;, which is a right tributary of the Oka, &quot;Ropsha&quot;, &quot;Shapsha&quot;, &quot;Kapsha&quot;, &quot;Kiddeksha&quot; with the name of the goddess. , on the other hand, believed that &quot;Mokosh&quot; was derived from the Finnish demon &quot;Moksha&quot;. This view has not met with widespread acceptance. Henryk Łowmiański, who had no doubts about the Slavic etymology, considers the demon &quot;Moksha&quot; to be most likely a loan from the Slavs, or that the sound similarity is coincidental; Gieysztor also considered the demon to be a loan. Later researchers and Zubov denied the Finno-Ugric origin of Mokosh. Toporov, Iwanov and ESSJa share a similar point of view. Mikhail Vasilyev believes that the connection with the Finnish ethnonym &quot;Moksha&quot; is coincidental, while the very &quot;affiliation of Mokosh with Slavic paganism is indisputable&quot;.. Michal Téra suggested that the Mokosh was borrowed from the Slavs and later demonized.

Etymologies connecting theonym with Sanskrit &quot;rich&quot;, &quot;noble&quot;, or, according to Natalya Guseva, &quot;moksha,&quot; &quot;liberation,&quot; and &quot;death&quot; are questionable; as well as the relationship with Ancient Greek &quot;lustful&quot;, &quot;violent&quot;, with Old Lithuanian &quot;kekše&quot; &quot;prostitute&quot;, Avestan &quot;maekantis;&quot; and &quot;tree sap.&quot; Thracian origin of Mokosh is also doubtful. Gieysztor called the etymology of Vittore Pisani, who considered the theonym to be a word composed of the roots &quot;mot-&quot; &quot;to spool, to reel&quot; and &quot;-kos&quot; &quot;abundance&quot;, &quot;unbelievable&quot;.

=== Onomastics ===
There is onomastic data that can be linked to Mokosh: the Croatian masculine surname and given name &quot;Mokoš&quot;, the masculine terms , in the Russian proverb ; &quot;rusalka&quot;; &quot;troublesome person&quot;; in Yaroslavl region &quot;phantom, ghost&quot;. In Tver and Novgorod regions &quot;to cry, beg for something&quot;. In Novgorod meaning &quot;to obsessively demand something, to pester with requests&quot; is also attested. Russian dialects include the words &quot;foolish, stupid woman&quot;, &quot;whore, hussy&quot; and , meaning the constellation Aquarius. From the Belarusian family ., the proper noun , was attested in Pskov&#x27;s from 1585, belonging to cannon maker.

The toponyms of the Czech village &quot;Mokošín&quot; was attested since 11th century, and hill &quot;Mokošin Vrch&quot;; Sorbian &quot;Мосоcize&quot;, &quot;Mockschiez&quot;; Polish &quot;Mokoszyn&quot;, &quot;Mokosznica&quot;, &quot;Mokossko&quot;, &quot;Mokos&quot;; located near Stralsund in the former Polabian lands of Germany, the Old Polabian toponym &quot;Muuks&quot;, &quot;Mukus&quot; attested in 1310; Croatian &quot;Mokosica&quot; near Dubrovnik, mountain &quot;Mukoša&quot; near Marloh and smaller mountains &quot;Mukos&quot;, &quot;Mokoš&quot; and &quot;Mokos&quot;; Macedonian &quot;Mukos&quot;; in Chernihiv Oblast, Russia, and swampy area, in Belarus. There was a wasteland or lye called in Cherepovetsky Uyezd the ethnographer Mikhail Gerasimov noted. It is likely the onomastics materials speak of the Proto-Slavic antiquity of the goddess, or the toponyms are derived from &quot;*mokosъ&quot; (&quot;floodplain meadow&quot;) or directly from the stem root &quot;*mok-&quot;. Zubov said in light of the word &quot;mokosha&quot; as a term for a troublesome person, the relationship with Mokosh becomes problematic. Ilyinsky lists a number of toponyms similar to the theonym, but denies their kinship, recognizing toponyms derived from the root &quot;*mok-&quot; (&quot;to (get) wet&quot;), from words &quot;makushka&quot;, &quot;mak&quot; (&quot;poppy&quot;) and from dialectal form of given name Maximus: . Linguist Stanisław Urbańczyk considers the correlation of toponyms with Mokosh to be questionable.

Toporov associates Mokosh with a character from a Slovenian fairy tale called &quot;Mokoška&quot;, &quot;Mokuška&quot;, &quot;Mokoška&quot;, which is also known as or Lamwaberl. The story was recorded in 1855 by Davorin Trstenjak, who heard it from in Lower Styria According to the tale:

Lamwaberl used to live in Grünau, a marshy place not far away from Šent Florjan Square, near the Ložnica [river] that often overflowed its banks. Archaeological artifacts confirm that in the olden times the place had been cultivated. A lone farming estate is situated there now, but once upon a time there stood the castle of Mokoška, a heathen princess who lived in it. The castle was surrounded by gardens that were always green. She occasionally helped people but sometimes also harmed them; she was especially wont to taking children with her. At long last, God punished her. On a stormy night, the castle and all its gardens sank into the ground. But Mokoška was not doomed. She continued to appear, disguised in different female forms. She still carries off children, especially those who have been neglected by their parents 

== Sources ==
=== Old East Slavic sources ===
Mokosh is mentioned in a 980 account in the early-12th-century text &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, the oldest copy of which is part of the &quot;Laurentian Codex&quot; of 1377:

And Vladimir began to reign alone in Kyiv. And he placed idols on the hill outside the palace: a Perun in wood with a silver head and a gold moustache, and Khors Dazhbog, and Stribog, and Simargl, and Mokosh. And they offered sacrifices and called them gods, and they took their sons and daughters to them and sacrificed them to the devils. And they profaned the earth with their sacrifices, and Rus’ and that hill were profaned by blood.

In historiography, this event is known as the pagan reform or the first religious reform of Vladimir. One point of view, considering the reform, treats it as a transition to monotheism; according to philologist Viljo Mansikka, and historians Aleksey Shakhmatov and Henryk Łowmiański, initially there was only Perun in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, and later other gods were added to make Vladimir a polytheist. The philologist Anichkov shared Shahmatov&#x27;s position, although he noted: &quot;there is no objective data to recognize this insertion&quot;. Historian Evgeny Anichkov said the existence of the Kyiv pantheon is recorded in parallel sources. Another historian, Leo Klejn considered the event a reintroduction of paganism; the idols were erected immediately after the assassination of Yaropelk, who had sympathies for Christianity and pursued a pro-Christian policy, and after the enthronement of Vladimir. The Perun idol was already standing on a hill in Kyiv at the home of prince Igor.

It has been debated the text&#x27;s passage about &quot;bringing their sons and daughters&quot; refers to either human sacrifice or participation in a ritual. Modern academics consider the text from &quot;And they offered&quot; to &quot;and that hill&quot;, and beyond to be a paraphrase of Psalm verses (). Vasilyev considers the existence of frequent human sacrifices for the Kyiv pantheon as a historical fact, but according to historian , the issue of human sacrifices and the reform is debatable, and the text about Vladimir&#x27;s reform is a reworking of the &quot;Chronicle of George Hamartolos&quot;, which mentions the creation of six idol gods of deities with Belphegor leading and one female figure, Astarte. According to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, the idols were made of gold and silver, and defiled earth is also mentioned. Lukin said the story of Vladimir&#x27;s pantheon and human sacrifices is a chronicler&#x27;s construction from the 1170s, and the names of the deities were taken from oral tradition the chronicler knew of.

Among the deities established by Vladimir, Mokosh was the only goddess. Philologist Nikolay Zubov said: &quot;according to the generally accepted opinion, in the circle of Vladimir&#x27;s pantheon, this is the most mysterious figure&quot;.

The chronicle then tells how the elders and boyars decided to cast lots to kill a boy or girl as a sacrifice to the gods. In Kyiv lived a Christian and Varangian, Fyodor, who had a son John, according to the chronicle, &quot;beautiful in face and soul&quot;, upon whom fate had fallen. Emissaries came to Fyodor, saying that his son had been chosen by the gods and should be sacrificed. Fyodor dismissed the Kyiv statues as gods, pointing out that they were made of wood. The envoys told the people all about it, and, taking up arms, they trashed Fyodor&#x27;s courtyard and ordered him, as he stood in the hallway with his son, to give his son to the gods. In response, Varangian said that the gods themselves could send someone from their own circle to take his son from him, whereupon the people cut down the hallway, and Fyodor and John were killed. The appearance of the story of the Varangians in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; is a later addition that probably first appeared in the &quot;First Corpus&quot; of the 1190s. 

The chronicle entry itself was based on a possibly existing original story about the Varangians, an early short synaxarion record in memory of locally honored saints, which was written specifically to glorify the first Rus&#x27; martyrs. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; account used a version already revised and supplemented with some unreliable details, but without the names of the Varangians, which were unknown to the compiler of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; account. Among the misrepresentations is the location of the death of the Varangians. The existence of human sacrifices among the Slavs is recorded by various sources. Therefore, as archaeologists Irina Rusanova and wrote, &quot;the information about human sacrifices among the Eastern Slavs [...] can hardly be considered accusations and propaganda against paganism&quot; and that &quot;no special cruelty can be seen in the custom of human sacrifices among the Slavs. These sacrifices were conditioned by the worldview of the time and were used for the good and salvation of society&quot;. Human sacrifices were made under certain circumstances, and bloodless sacrifices were the most common.

After Vladimir baptized Rus in 988, he ordered the idols to be overthrown: some chopped up, others burned. He built St. Basil&#x27;s Church on the spot where the idols stood. In 1975, the foundations of the building were found during excavations on . Archaeologist Boris Rybakov recognized the structure as the site of Kyiv&#x27;s pantheon, claiming that it had &quot;clearly marked five projections of different sizes: one large one in the middle, two smaller ones on the sides and two very small ones near the side projections...&quot;. Subsequent researchers have criticized Rybakov&#x27;s statement. The (outdoors templte) itself has not been discovered by archaeologists, nor has any evidence of human sacrifice in Kyiv.

After the adoption of Christianity, various sermons against the old religion appeared. In particular, the &quot;Sermon by One Who Loves Christ&quot; was written, according to most scholars, in the mid-11th century. The exceptions are Mansikka, who claims the &quot;Sermon&quot; was written in the 14th century, and Rusanova and Timoshchuk, who date it to the 12th century. The &quot;Sermon&quot; itself is available in two editions: a short, original edition and a long, later edition. Fragment from the late 14th century edition of the Paisios&#x27; list of the collection:
As Elijah the Tishbite, having cut the throats of three hundred idolatrous prophets and priests, said: “I burn with zeal for my Lord God Almighty”, so he, too being unable to bear Christians who live a double faith and believe in Perun and Khors, Mokosh, Sim and Rgl and in the Vily, who number thirty ninth sisters, —so say ignorant people who consider them goddesses—and thus give them offerings and cut the throats of hens and pray to fire, calling it Svarozhits. [...] Therefore, Christians must not hold demonic festivities, meaning dancing, music and profane songs, and offerings to the idols, who with fire under the fields of sheaves pray to the Vily, to Mokosh, and Sim and Rgl, to Perun, Rod, the Rozhanitsy and all the like.
– &quot;Sermon by One Who Loves Christ and Is a Jealous Defender of the Righteous Faith&quot;
Slavist Nikolay Galkovsky, due to the fact that the vilas are noted next to Mokosh, believes that they are related to the goddess, but according to historian Igor Danilevsky, the author of the Word used some unknown South Slavic source from which he took information about the vilas, mythological figures of the South Slavs. In his opinion, the Eastern Slavs themselves did not worship vilas. Similarly, Mansikka believes that the vilas and Mokosh were taken from the text &quot;Vopros, chto yest&#x27; trebokladen&#x27;ye idol&#x27;skoye&quot;, which he considers South Slavic. According to Anichkov, the original version of the &quot;Sermon&quot; said nothing about deities and they were added by later editors. Anichkov&#x27;s opinion is shared by Mansikka, who believes that the list of deities comes from the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;. On this basis, historian Vladimir Petukhin concludes that the insert with the mention of deities appeared no earlier than the 12th century. Since the name Simargl is spelled as Sim and Regl, the author of the Word may not have understood which characters were being referred to.

Mokosh is mentioned in the Old Rus&#x27; work &quot;Sermon by Saint Gregory&quot;, which is a reworking of the 4th century teaching of Constantinople patriarch Gregory of Nazianzus. The unknown Old Rus&#x27; author used the condemnation of the Greek gods, supplementing it with a text condemning the Slavic gods. An early edition of the &quot;Sermon&quot; is preserved in three handwritten copies from the 15th century and is variously dated by different researchers: the 1060s (Anichkov), the 12th century (Łowmiański, Rybakov), as well as dates considered unlikely by Vasilyev: late 13th - early 14th century (Slavists Sreznevsky, Galkovsky), 14th century (Mansikka). According to Rybakov, &quot;Sermon by Saint Gregory&quot; was a direct translation, but Danilevsky points out that the Word only partially reflects the Greek original. The original is called &quot;On the Theophany&quot;. Danilevsky notes that it is not known exactly which variant of Gregory Nazianzin&#x27;s text was used by the Old Russian author himself. It is also unknown how reliable the information about Slavic gods contained in the &quot;Sermon&quot; is. Excerpt from the Novgorod Sophia Library manuscript No. 1295 from the 15th century:
To those gods the Slavic people makes offerings too, and to vily, and Mokosh, Diva, Perun, Khors, Rod and Rozhanitsy, to the vampires and to the beregyni, and to Pereplut, for whom they drink in horns while pouring around. [...] The Taurian sacrifices made by the first born sons to the idols, the sacrificial blood of the Laconians spilt from wounds, which is their punishment, and with which they bathed the goddess, Yecate, whom they considered a virgin. And they worship Mokosh, and Kyla, and Malakiya, that is masturbation, saying: Buyakini. [...] Following holy baptism, they rejected Perun, but even after accepting Christ, in the border areas they still pray to the accursed Perun, and to Khors, and Mokosh and vil. And they do it secretly...
– &quot;Sermon by Saint Gregory, Found in the Comments, on How the Ancient Nations, When Pagan, Worshipped Idols and Offered Sacrifices to Them, and Continue to Do So Now&quot;
Mansikka notes that the meaning of the word &quot;Diva&quot; is unknown. Perhaps it is a literal translation of the Greek Δἰος (&quot;Dios&quot;), or the text should be read as &quot;Mokosh-Deva&quot; (&quot;Mokosh-Virgin&quot;). According to Danilevsky, what was meant was the [masculine] Div. Zubov comments that there is also an opinion that considers Diva to be the feminine version of Div, but analyzing the text, he concludes that the more correct variant is &quot;Mokosh-Deva&quot;, despite the original Дивѣ (&quot;Divě&quot; ()), instead of the expected *Дѣвѣ (&quot;*Děvě&quot; ()). The schoolar attributes this to the Novgorodian origin of &quot;Sermon&quot; and the fact that in the dialect the sound [ѣ] can turn into [i]. Thus, the term &quot;Diva&quot; becomes an epithet-definition of Mokosh &quot;according to the Hellenistic model&quot;, regardless of whether Mokosh was a virgin in the original pagan depictions. In favor of this interpretation, according to the scholar, is the fact that the word &quot;Diva&quot; is not mentioned anywhere else. Rybakov and Zubov define &quot;Yecate&quot; as Hekate, believing that the author of the &quot;Sermon&quot; saw some parallels between Hekate and Mokosh. The term &quot;malakiya&quot; is of Greek origin and means onanism. From its proximity to Mokosh, Ilyinsky concludes that Mokosh was associated with sexual activity. 

Slavist Aleksander Brückner rejected the identification of Mokosh with &quot;malakiya&quot;, as the text shows that they are two different things. According to Mansikka, &quot;and they worship Mokosh, and Kyla&quot; is an insertion made on the basis of the consonance of &quot;Mokosh&quot; with &quot;malakiya&quot;. Danilevsky literally translates the word &quot;Kyla&quot; as &quot;hernia&quot;, but he himself believes, as do many other scholars, that it is more likely to be considered a distortion of the word &quot;vila&quot;. Galkovsky viewed &quot;buyakini&quot; as a vila, which he associated with Mokosh. The term &quot;buyakini&quot; is associated by Leo Klejn with the words , , meaning &quot;pogost&quot;, &quot;cemetery&quot;, and the &quot;buyakini&quot; themselves, if not a copyist&#x27;s error, are understood by Klejn as participants in funeral rites who practiced orgiastic rituals. In Klejn&#x27;s reconstruction, Perun was a dying-and-rising god, and these rituals were a sacred drama of resurrecting a dead god or his reincarnation, and the purpose of the &quot;buyakini&quot; was not onanism, but the extraction of semen for ritual purposes. Danilevsky points out, however, that the Greek original says &quot;in honor of bliss and fearlessness&quot;, where the latter word was translated as &quot;courage&quot;, and the form &quot;buyakini&quot; appeared only as a result of consonance (in relation to &quot;malakini&quot;). Anichkov believes that the text consists of late insertions.

The philologist Nikolai Tikhonravov, in the fourth volume of Chronicles of Russian Literature and Antiquity, cites the text in Moscow synodal manuscript No. 954 from the 14th century, fol. 33; Galkovsky did not find this text and concluded that either Tikhonravov was mistaken or the manuscript numbers had been changed. Excerpt:
He is not speaking to pagans, but to peasants. Many Christians set meals for idols and fill cups for demons. Who are these idols? The first idol is the rozhanitsa. The great prophet Isaiah speaks of them, crying out in a loud voice: Oh, woe to those who set a meal for the rozhanitsa and fill cups for the demons! The other [meal] is given to the vilas and Mokosh, and they do not pray openly, but secretly call on idolatrous women; and not only poor people, but also the wives of rich husbands. Using the troparion of the holy Theotokos during an idolatrous meal is very bad.


Linguists Vladimir Toporov and Vyacheslav Ivanov distinguish the category of idol worshippers as the priestesses of Mokosh, but in turn Zubov concludes: the text is a reference to the &quot;Sermon of Isaiah&quot;, and the vilas and Mokosh are a contemporaneous insertion close to &quot;Sermon by Saint Gregory&quot;.

The work &quot;Sermon by the Holy Father Saint John Chrysostom&quot; is a compilation and is based specifically on &quot;Sermon by Saint Gregory&quot;. Generally, the text dates to the 13th century, and historian Igor Danilevsky dates it to the end of the 11th century, and is known from the manuscript from St. Sophia Cathedral of Veliky Novgorod No. 1262 from the 14th-15th centuries and other copies. Excerpt according to the oldest of these:
Men who have forgotten the fear of God from neglect by renouncing baptism, approach idols and start to make sacrifices to the thunder and lightning, the sun and moon, and others, to Perun, Khors, the vily and Mokosh, to vampires and the beregyni, whom they call three times nine sisters. And others believe in Svarozhits and Artemid, to whom ignorant men pray. They sacrifice cockerels to them.
– &quot;Sermon by the Holy Father Saint John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople, on How the First Pagans Believed in Idols&quot;
In the &quot;Life of Vladimir&quot; preserved in the Bulgarian oldest copy from the 13th century, after the story of Vladimir&#x27;s baptism in Kherson, it is said: &quot;And he came to Kyiv, beating the idols of Perun, Khurs, Dazhbog and Mokosh and other idols&quot;. The work goes back to &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;.

In the &quot;Hypatian Codex&quot;, under the date 1071, we read that “at the same time” a volkhv appeared in Kyiv to whom five deities appeared. He claimed that within five years the Dnieper would begin to flow backwards, and the Rus&#x27; land would &quot;pass&quot; into the hands of the Greeks. Scholars equated these deities with the Kyiv pantheon, in which they believed there were six. Explaining this contradiction, Anichkov excluded Mokosh from this list, as he considered her a borrowed deity. Łowmiański also excluded Mokosh because he was of the opinion that she was originally a demon and was added later to the Vladimir pantheon, while Rybakov rejected Simargl. Vasilyev explains this by the fact that Dazhbog bore the double name of Dazhbog-Khors. However, Petrukhin believes that the prophecy of the volkhv in Kyiv is not due to traces of paganism, but events in 1068-1069, when rebellious peasants threatened the princes to burn the city and go to the land of Greece. &quot;Five gods&quot; were the five planets whose astrological position and referred to by the magician.

An annalistic edition of &quot;The Tale of the Battle with Mamai&quot;, written perhaps in the early 15th century, describes Mamai&#x27;s defeat: &quot;The impious ... King Mamai, seeing his destruction, began to call upon his gods: Perun, Salavat, Mokosh and Gursa&quot;. Here the form of Mokosh&#x27;s name is given in the masculine gender. In the main and most widely circulated editions of the &quot;Tale&quot;, the god Mokosh is absent. Vasilyev notes that the list of gods is most similar to their list in the &quot;Sermon by the Holy Father Saint John Chrysostom&quot;.

=== Sources from the 16th-17th centuries ===
There are Polish chronicles relating to East Slavic paganism and mentioning Mokosh, but researchers consider them secondary, as they are based on Old East Slavic sources. In the 16th-century work &quot;De origine et rebus gestis Polonorum libri XXX&quot; by historian Martin Kromer, Mokosh is mentioned among other gods as &quot;Mocosi&quot;. In the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of the historian Maciej Stryjkowski, published in 1582, in a list of gods whose names are passed down in distorted form, Mokosh is noted as &quot;Makosz&quot;. Mansikka notes that the chronicle itself was compiled from other Polish sources and contains &quot;some fantasies and fabrications&quot;.

According to one of the confessional questions in the 16th century &quot;Rule of Saint Sava&quot;, the priest had to ask: &quot;Have you wandered with impious women and prayed to the vilas, and Rod, and the rozhanitsy, and Perun, Khors, Mokosh, and drank and ate?&quot;. Three years of penance with bowing was imposed for the aforementioned sin. According to Anichkov, the mention of Perun, Chors and Mokosh was added as an insertion. The same question was included in the work from the early 16th century, where two years of penance were imposed for a positive answer to this question. The 16th century asks: “Did you go to Mokusha?&quot;. Many researchers believe that under the term &quot;Mokusha&quot; means &quot;witch doctor&quot;. Akhnikov explained it with the word &quot;to beg, to whine&quot;, changed to &quot;to enchant&quot;, &quot;to conjure&quot;. According to ethnographer Elpidifor Barsov, in the he possessed, the question was: &quot;Did you go to Mokosha?&quot;. Shakhmatov refers to an unpublished &quot;Word on the Beginning of the Rus&#x27; Land&quot; in the 16th century inventory of the Rumyantsev Museum No. 358, where the sentence &quot;and Prince Vladimir came to crush the idols of Mokosh and others&quot; is found.

A work from a collection dating back to the 16th century, which publisher Izmail Sreznevsky calls &quot;The Spiritual Instruction of Children&quot;, and historian calls &quot;Sermon of Saint John Chrysostom&quot;, contains the following instruction:
Hide yourselves from God invisible, people praying to the lineage and rodzanice, Perun and Apollo, and Mokosha and peregynia, and do not approach any god, nor any vile sacrifices.
Mansikka believes that the names of mythological figures come from a certain work condemning pagans, close to the &quot;Sermon by Saint Gregory&quot;.

The chapter &quot;On the idols of Vladimir&quot; from the Piskari manuscript No. 153 of the late 17th century lists the statues installed by Vladimir. This work is not original and ancient, as it was based on the chapter &quot;On the idols&quot; from the &quot;Kievan Synopsis&quot;, probably created by the historian Innocent Gizel. The chapter &quot;On the idols of Vladimir&quot; is similar in content to the text &quot;On the idols of Rus&quot;&#x27; in the &quot;Hustyn Chronicle&quot; of 1670. Both chapters were written under the influence of Polish chronicles and contain the names of the gods in a distorted form. Excerpt from Piskari manuscript no. 153:
Also other idols were many, by name Outlad or Oslad, Korsh or Khors, Dashub or Dazhb, Strib or Stribog, Simargl or Simurgl, and Makosh or Mokosh; to them, to the demons, the ignorant people, like to a God, offered sacrifices and praises. This abomination prevailed throughout the state of Vladimir.
The &quot;Hustyn Chronicle&quot; similarly lists the gods, including Mokosh. Mansikka writes that these chronicles are more detailed than the original, and notes that the scribe chose to supplement them with his own notes and insertions. All three works eventually return to &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;.

&quot;The Sermon from the Holy Gospel&quot; in manuscript No. 784 from the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius lists sins of the body and soul. Among the sins of the soul are mentioned:
[To] learn astronomy and believe in casting [spells] and in false writings, and in Hellenistic books, and in fairy tales, and in &quot;ustryatsu&quot;, and in Mokosh, and in &quot;snosudets&quot;, divination by birds, in thunder and in kolyada, and in all the &quot;martoloi&quot; and damned who make evil days and hours.
There is a variant where in place of &quot;Mokosh&quot; is the word basket &quot;fate&quot;, according to Rybakov the word &quot;Mokosh&quot; instead of &quot;kosh&quot; was just a scribe&#x27;s error, and he translates the words &quot;snosudets&quot;, &quot;ustryatsu&quot; and &quot;martoloi&quot; as &quot;volkhovnik&quot;, &quot;divination&quot; and &quot;astrologers&quot;, respectively. Anichkov considered the words &quot;ustryatsu&quot; and &quot;Mokosh&quot; to be insertions.

In the &quot;Ukrainian Life of Vladimir&quot; of the XVII century among the list of his gods Mokosh is recorded as &quot;Moksha&quot;. In the &quot;Ukrainian Prologue Life of Vladimir&quot; from the manuscript of the Rumyantsev Museum No. 325 of the XVII century tells how Vladimir beat his gods, among them the deity Moksha, and drowned them in the Dnieper. This work, like &quot;Life of Vladimir&quot;, goes back to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;.

== Attempts at reconstruction ==
According to the Slavist Grigoriy Ilyinsky, ancient Rus&#x27; sources do not provide any information except the name of Mokosh. In his opinion, toponymic traces are equally unreliable and explanatory, and some conclusions about the nature of the goddess can only be drawn on the basis of folklore and ethnographic evidence. Later, philologist Aleksandr Strakhov wrote the features of Mokosh, like the rest of the pagan pantheon, are known &quot;not from medieval sources, but from numerous reconstructions and observations of scholars-bellerists of the 19th and 20th centuries&quot;.

=== Early studies ===
In early scholarly literature, Mokosh was considered in various ways: Slavist compared Mokosh with Astarte, and the Slavist Lubor Niederle likened her to Aphrodite. Ethnographer M. Nikiforovsky considered her the goddess of winds and water. According to historian Dmitri Schoeppingk, Mokosh&#x27;s functions were transferred to Saint Elijah because he is called &quot;wet&quot;. Slavist Nikolai Galkovsky assumed because Mokosh is mentioned together with the vilas that according to him are called &quot;buyakini&quot; in the &quot;Sermon by Saint Gregory&quot;), Mokosh was the spirit of the deceased residing in water. Archaeologist Aleksandr Velikhanov, referring to Sanskrit, said Mokosh and Simargl were the same deity. Slavist Vatroslav Jagić did not consider Mokosh a deity at all. Folklorist Alexander Krappe likened Mokosh to the biblical Moloch. In &quot;History of Russia&quot;, historian Vasily Tatishchev stated: &quot;Mokos, the god of cattle&quot;. Galkovsky said the Czechs had a rain and moisture deity with a similar name, to whom they offered prayers and sacrifices in times of severe drought. Archaeologist Boris Rybakov noted Galkovsky does not refer to the source of this information. In 1839, ethnographer Żegota Pauli ssid the Czechs and Moravians had a deity called &quot;Makosla&quot;, &quot;Makosh&quot;, &quot;Mokosh&quot;, which they worshipped in times of drought. He compared this deity to Mokosh, while referring to it as &quot;Mokta&quot; or &quot;Moksha&quot;, and considered them the same rain deity.

=== Mokosh and Mokosha, Mokusha ===

According to ethnographic data, a reconstruction of the function of the goddess was carried out. At the end of the 19th century, in the journal &quot;&quot;, ethnographer Mikhail Gerasimov published ethnographic data from the Cherepovetsky Uyezd, which noted the villagers beliefs about a demon and domovoy by the name of . Later, Gerasimov said Mokosha was not a domovoy. She lives in every hut in the and is imagined as a woman with a big head and long arms. Mokosha likes to spin sliver at night, left by women without prayer. That is why there is a prohibition in the village of Bolshoy Dvor in Dmitrovsky District: &quot;Don&#x27;t leave your linen, or Mokosha will spin it&quot;. Ethnographer Elpidifor Barsov provided information from the Olonets Governorate about the belief in a spirit called , who during Great Lent goes among the people spinning wool at night and shearing sheep. 

When unsheared sheep scrape out their excess wool, it was said: &quot;Oh, Mokusha has sheared the sheep&quot;. When they sleep and the spindle &quot;&quot;, it is said: &quot;Mokusha spun&quot;. When Mokusha leaves the house, she might slam the spindle into and beam. The offering to her was a piece of wool left in the shears for the night. If Mokusha is not satisfied, she can cut off some of the housewives&#x27; hair. This image of an impure force corresponds to the kikimora, whose depictions are widespread, mainly in northern Russia, and who is sometimes understood as a domovoy. She is described as an ugly woman who mostly lives the home. She uses objects to make sounds and acts at night when people are sleeping. She is deterred by prayer. The kikimora&#x27;s main occupation is harming householders and spinning. Mokusha can shear sheep, but she does it poorly and can be appeased with a special sacrifice. Many other mythological figures of folk Christianity are associated with spinning: Saint Barbara, Theotokos, Paraskeva Friday, notsnitsa and rusalka. A rusalka could be called ; demons could be called &quot;mokosh&quot; or &quot;mokush&quot;. In the Yaroslavl Governorate, an &quot;economic, troublesome man&quot; could be referred to as a , while in the Vyatka Governorate a &quot;hardworking person&quot; was called a &quot;shishimory&quot;. Kikimora was also known in Novgorod and Vologda Governorate as &quot;mokrukha&quot; because she left a wet mark at the spinning site.

Based on the consonance of the names, Gerasimov and Barsov said Mokosh, Mokosha and Mokusha are identical. This proposal was supported by a number of other researchers, who attributed several functions—love, birth, connection with the night, spinning, raising sheep and the feminine sphere— Among them were linguist Max Vasmer and historian Leo Klejn. Barsov believed Mokosh was associated with sheep farming, wool, yarn, female braids and the feminine sphere in general, and that she was a companion of Veles. According to Ilyinsky, Mokosh is the goddess of spinning, weaving and other household chores, and the patroness of matchmaking, marriage and sexual relations, &quot;weaving&quot; meaning bringing lovers together. Historian and philologist Michal Téra recognized her as the Earth-Mother, who patronized women and was a Slavic variant of the “Indo-European trifunctional goddess.” Linguist Vladimir Toporov, in an attempt to explain the resemblance to kikimora, said there was a demonization of the goddess, which reduced Mokosh to the level of kikimora. 

Philologist Nikolai Zubov brought Mokosh and kikimora closer together through the second element in the latter&#x27;s name: &quot;-mora&quot;, which he said originated from the Proto-Slavic stem &quot;*mor-&quot; and can mean &quot;swamp, standing water&quot;. Through the functions of spinning and fate, a connection has been suggested with similar deities: the Germanic Norns, the Greek Moirai and the Baltic goddess Laima. Zubov suggested a connection between Mokosh and the moon because in European folklore, the moon can be associated with spinning and procreation. According to him, long-armedness is associated with the epithet &quot;long-armed&quot; of Iranian gods and rulers, prince Yuri Dolgorukiy and the princes of Chernigov, who may have borne this nickname. Marina Vlasova suggests a connection between Mokosh and the rusalkas and the Theotokos, although she noted: &quot;it is difficult to characterize with sufficient precision the relationship between the images of Mokosh and Mokosha spinning at home&quot;.

Historian Henryk Łowmiański and linguist Stanisław Urbańczyk made the opposite reconstruction, believing Mokosh was originally a demon in the 10th-11th centuries, and Nikon of Caves included her in the annalistic pantheon of &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; as an insert due to the lack of information about the real gods. In keeping with Łowmiański&#x27;s idea, Nikon included the names of the deities surrounding him in Tmutarakan, and the name of Mokosh, who in Slavic lands was &quot;held in great esteem as a demon&quot;. According to the historian Vladimir Petrukhin, Tmutarakan was not a source of pagan syncretism, remaining a Greek and Christian city.

According to philologist Evgeny Anichkov, the name &quot;Mokoshá&quot; is of Finno-Ugric origin. The name &quot;Mokoshá&quot;, according to linguists Toporov and Ivanov, may be an deverbal formation from the Proto-Slavic &quot;*mok-oši-ti&quot;, which they understood to mean &quot;to bustle, to potter, to putter&quot;, but this hypothesis has not been supported and the word probably has a later Russian origin.

Although many scholars have linked etymological and ethnographic reconstructions, later researchers have noted that they do not relate to each other in any way. Łowmiański criticized that because the function of spinning could not be the main one.

==== Łuczyński&#x27;s reconstruction ====
Based on information about &quot;going to Mokosh&quot; as an oracle or fortune teller, Łuczyński interpreted Mokosh as the goddess of fate and destiny; this interpretation was confirmed by dialect dictionaries, which often record the phrase &quot;to go to [a oracle]&quot;. According to Łuczyński: &quot;God is not Mokosh, [he] consoles with something&quot;, as an antithesis, i.e. Mokosh is the one who &quot;consoles&quot;, gives luck, good fortune. She was also supposed to rule the weather, such as rain, as an extension of her rulership over fate. The depiction of Mokosh in dialects of Russia, including the vocabulary of the Old Believers, reflects the goddess&#x27; association with birth and the determination of fate of newborns. Mokosh was also associated with the household and feminine activities; she was patron of women, probably married women in particular, as indicated by the fact married women were &quot;visiting&quot; Mokosh, which could express the psychosocial context of the worship of this goddess. Based on the above characteristics, Łuczyński concluded the closest counterpart to Mokosh is the Baltic Laima, who was associated with water and fate—when Laima was on a hill, she foretold good fate; when she was in the marshes, by the water, she foretold bad fate. Latvian toponyms include the hydronyms &quot;Lainuma-zers&quot; (&quot;Laima&#x27;s lake&quot;), &quot;lainuma-purvs&quot; (&quot;Laima&#x27;s swamp&quot;), divination (the Rambynas stone that was used to foretell the future was Laima&#x27;s &quot;house&quot;), and the birth of children and determining their fate. Unlike Laima, Mokosh did not have patronage of agriculture.

=== Comparison with Paraskeva Friday ===

It was later suggested Mokosh was related to Paraskeva Friday (Russian: ); Friday and Wednesday were associated with the Passion of Jesus, and were accompanied by fasting and folk Christian bans on work, especially women&#x27;s work, such as spinning, sewing, washing, and dishwashing. There were also bans on children and sexual activity. The ban on spinning extended to Sunday and Friday, which was called &quot;bloody day&quot; in Polesia and was widely considered an unlucky time. In folk Christianity, Pyatnitsa was personified as a mythical female figure. The same was true of Wednesday and Sunday. These personifications had the same functions as the Pyatnitsa. The prohibitions were motivated by a number of considerations related to the threat of harm to the spinner, her family, and her dead ancestors. For example, according to beliefs recorded in Polesia, Pyatnitsa in the form of a woman with loose hair would torture whoever broke the ban by suffocating them in their sleep. According to another belief, in the &quot;next world&quot;, spindles will enter the mouth and eyes. A ban on spinning on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday has also been reported elsewhere.

The mythological Friday has been correlated with Paraskeva Pyatnitsa, whose cult developed from that of the saints Paraskeva of Iconium and Paraskeva of the Balkans, whose names from Byzantine Greek translate as &quot;Friday&quot;. In addition to Friday&#x27;s prohibitions and injunctions, and its association with spinning, Paraskeva was associated with marriage, childbearing, curing diseases and water springs, because of which she was called the &quot;mother of earth and water&quot;. There are legends of an icon of Paraskeva appearing in a spring, after which the spring became healing. Sacrifices were made to Paraskeva by throwing coins, ribbons, shirts, handkerchiefs, towels or sheep&#x27;s wool and thread into water on Elijah&#x27;s Friday. These items could be thrown directly into the water or left next to the inscription &quot;for mother Pyatnica for the apron!&quot;. In Ukraine in the 19th century, the &quot;Mokrid&quot; ritual was recorded, during which a tether was thrown into a well. In this ritual, Pyatnitsa was represented by a woman with loose hair. The saint was closely associated with wells, on which her icons could be placed.

There is a widespread view among researchers Paraskeva Pyatnitsa replaced Mokosh in Christian times, which is why Vladimir Toporov believed Mokosh was popular among women following Christianization. Friday itself began to be understood as the day of the goddess Mokosh based on the dedication of this day to Venus by the Romans and Frigg by the Germans. Researcher and historian Eve Levin noted this approximation does not stand up to criticism because elements of the Paraskeva cult have Christian origins rather than pagan ones, and the cult is known in Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece and, Romania, whereas Mokosh is known only from East Slavic sources. The earliest East Slavic sources speak of Paraskeva as the patron of merchants rather than women. The basis of Paraskeva&#x27;s association with spinning were parables depicting her as a maiden. In them, she strikes blind her tormentor then heals him, making her the patroness of those suffering from eye diseases. In the 14th and 15th centuries, Paraskeva&#x27;s relics rested in Ternovo and Belgrade, where local water sources were linked to her. The only function that has no obvious Christian origin is the patronage of childbirth, but according to Levin, this is a natural development of the patronization of women&#x27;s labor and healing. The Eastern Orthodox Church supported the cult of Paraskeva, although it considered its folk interpretation &quot;heretical&quot;, saying on Wednesday and Friday, one was not supposed to stop working but only fast and refrain from sex. The correspondence between Mokosh and Paraskeva is also rejected by philologists Aleksandr Strakhov and . Historian Leo Klejn, criticizing the concept of Thursday as Perun&#x27;s day, said the Slavs borrowed the seven-day week from the Romans and Byzantines, who in turn borrowed it from the Near East, naming the days of the week after the planets and gods dedicated to them by distance in the Ptolemaic system, whereby Friday, which is dedicated to Venus, was the seventh day. Germainc peoples later borrowed and interpreted the names of the week&#x27;s days. The qualities of Paraskeva, Venus, and Freya are opposite; Paraskeva patronizes proper female behavior rather than sexual activity.

==== The theory of basic myth ====
Linguists Vladimir Toporov and Vyacheslav Ivanov created the theory of basic myth, which reconstructed the Proto-Slavic myth of a battle between a storm god and a chthonic serpent. The first deity was correlated with Perun, the second with Veles, and there was also a female figure. Toporov said Mokosh was a Proto-Slavic deity and correlates this figure with her. The kidnapping of cattle, people or Perun&#x27;s wife by Veles caused enmity between the gods; after Veles is defeated with an arrow, abundant rain falls on the earth. According to Toporov, Mokosh is Perun&#x27;s wife because Perun opens the list of gods and Mokosh closes it. He points to a connection between Thursday as the even day dedicated to Perun/Veles and the odd day, Friday, as dedicated to Mokosh. In a 19th-century Ukrainian intimate song, there is a reference to the relationship between Mokosh and Pokhvist, whom Toporov understands as Perun, who was associated with wind. Toporov and Ivanov supported Teodolius Witkowski&#x27;s assumption the toponyms &quot;Muukus&quot; and &quot;Prohn&quot; in the same circle and correlated with Mokosh and Perun, respectively, speak of the relationship between the deities. Comparisons between the toponyms &quot;Peryn&quot; and &quot;Mokošin Vrch&quot;, both of which mean an elevated place, have been made. The Baltic toponyms &quot;Perkuno kalnas&quot; (&quot;mountain of Perkun&quot;) and &quot;Laumes kalnas&quot; (&quot;mountain of Laima&quot;), and &quot;Laume dauba&quot; (&quot;ravine of Laima&quot;) have been compared with the Belarussian &quot;Mokoshino boloto&quot;. 

By identifying the prophet Elijah with Perun, they point to the existence in folk beliefs of the prophet&#x27;s companion, Saint Macrina, who was associated with moisture and ultimately with Mokosh. To prove Mokosh&#x27;s promiscuity, Toporov cites several parallels; the association of Paraskeva Pyatnitsa with Mokosh is linked with Mokosh&#x27;s promiscuity because Paraskeva could be depicted with loose hair. He correlated the term meaning an evil woman with Mokosh. One of the sermons against paganism mentions Mokosh, and there is an earlier question about debauchery with ungodly women. Friday&#x27;s prohibitions correlate with a motif of a woman who lost her children as a result of violating the prohibitions, particularly that of using &quot;fire&quot;, a decoction of ashes. In Baltic mythology is a myth of a celestial wedding, according to which the goddess of the morning star Aušrinė is an adulterer. Toporov reconstructs the relationship between Mokosh and Veles: Thursday, in his view, was also the day of Veles and is correlated with Friday. Mokosh shares with Veles a common connections to water, wool, and the pit motif. Based on this, Toporov reconstructed the myth of Mokosh&#x27;s adultery with Veles and Perun&#x27;s subsequent punishment of her children. For the betrayal, Perun punishes Mokosh&#x27;s children with fire because Mokosh&#x27;s element water does not frighten her. According to Toporov, it is possible the cult of Mokosh may have enjoyed special reverence in Moscow based on the semantics of the toponym and theonym of Mokosh, and because Moscow is mentioned for the first time in the chronicles in connection with a meeting of the princes on Friday, April 4. It has been proposed to identify Mokosh with Baba Yaga and the goddess Laima through her function as a maiden.

Leo Klein considers this theory to be a stretch and based on speculation, and disputes the idea Thursday and Friday were dedicated to gods. Later research has rejected any link between Mokosh and Paraskeva. Henryk Łowmiański said the proximity of Perun and Mokosh is due to a literary connection and has no evidentiary value. The &quot;Ukrainian intimate song&quot; from the 19th century cited by Toporov is &quot;The Tale of the God Pokhvist&quot;, on the basis of which an opinion &quot;the memory of Mokosh in Ukraine was preserved until the middle of the 19th century&quot; has arisen in academia. The 19th-century scholars Mykola Kostomarov and Alexander Pypin refused to acknowledge the text&#x27;s authenticity. Philologist considers the work to be a forgery created by the writer . The religious academic Andrey Beskov commented Ivanov and Toporov showed &quot;surprising credulity&quot; in believing in the authenticity of the text. The hypothesis of Mokosh&#x27;s marriage to Perun, like the theory of the main myt, has not found full support in the scientific community. Historian wrote Mokosh&#x27;s features rather testify to a possible marriage with Veles.

==== Rybakov&#x27;s reconstruction ====
Archaeologist Boris Rybakov, who supported the reconstruction of Mokosh through identification with Paraskeva and her etymology, which is false, deduced Mokosh&#x27;s name translates as &quot;Mother of Fate, Good Harvest&quot;, characterizing her as a virgin goddess, goddess of fertility, water, patroness of women&#x27;s labor and virgin fate. He considers Mokosh identical to the West Slavic goddess Zhiva and to Mat Zemlya, and correlates Mokosh with the image of the Paleolithic Mother Goddess, saying the cult of Mokosh originated in the Paleolithic era. On the basis of the Christian apocrypha &quot;On Twelve Fridays&quot;, Rybakov said every Friday was a celebration of Mokosh; there were twelve special Fridays of the year, the most important of which fell on November 1-8.

Analyzing &quot;Sermon by Saint Gregory&quot;, Rybakov wrote the author equated Mokosh with the goddess Yecate, identifying the latter as Hekate. He said the approximation occurred on the basis Hekate was understood to be a deity associated with the afterlife and was surrounded by dogs, whereas in the sources, Mokosh is adjacent to Simargl and the oxen, which Rybakov interpreted as a sacred dog associated with crops and &quot;rusalky&quot; (the souls of the dead). From this, he deduced the cult of Mokosh corresponded to the &quot;middle phase of the cult of Hekate&quot;, which was agrarian.

Rybakov believed the Zbruch idol depicted Mokosh with a horn in her hand, which in his opinion is a symbol of abundance associated with fertility. According to Leon Klejn, the female figure below Mokosh in the middle row should be connected to the image above. Above her shoulder is a small figure, which Klejn interprets as a child, spirit or soul, and on this basis concludes this spirit is not related to the functions of the goddess according to Rybakov.

Embroideries of Finno-Ugric peoples (Vepsians, Karelians, Izhorians), and Russian Northerners depict anthropomorphic figures with raised or partially lowered arms, combined with geometrized trees, birds, horses and horsemen. Sometimes, the human figures are framed by elements resembling buildings. Rybakov supported archaeologist Lev Dinces&#x27; conjecture the figure between the horses on these North Russian embroideries represents Mokosh. Rybakov interprets the structures depicted on the embroideries as pagan temples. Ethnographer Grigory Bazlov noted the existence of other embroideries in which, in his opinion, the central figures have beards and wear what Rybakov thought to be a dress, which Bazlov interpreted as a kaftan, concluding the central figures were men and that some of the figures have male genitalia. Folklorist Natalya Kozlova wrote there are only two examples with a male figure, and rejected the opinion of male genitalia because &quot;the style of embroidery is conventional and schematic&quot;, and therefore &quot;does not give grounds for accurate attribution of details&quot;. According to Klejn, the figure in the center represents the Sun and he rejects Rybakov&#x27;s proposed character identifications.

=== Family ===

The sources make no mention of Mokosh&#x27;s family connections. According to Vladimir Toporow, Mokosh was the wife of Perun. According to the theory of basic myth created by Toporow and Vyacheslav Ivanov, Mokosh cheated on Perun with Veles and was later punished by him. Later academics reject that myth. Łuczyński, who also rejects the Slavic version of the basic myth proposed by Toporov, also links Mokosh to Perun. For the hypothetical early Proto-Slavic pantheon, he reconstructs Proto-Mokosh as the daughter of Zema (Earth) and Div (Heaven), sister of Usa (Dawn), Proto-Yarilo (Morning Star), Men (Moon) and Sul (Sun). For the later stage, he reconstructs Mokosh as the wife of Perun, both of whom parented Morana and Yarilo. Witkowski, on the basis the villages of &quot;Prohn&quot; and &quot;Mukus&quot;, the names of which are supposed derived from Perun and Mokosh, were from each other, concluded the villages &quot;must indicate cult connections&quot;. According to the historian Roman Rabinovich, Mokosh&#x27;s features are evidence of a possible marriage to Veles.

== Neopaganism ==
Mokosh, also known as Makosh, is revered in Slavic neopaganism as the goddess of the earth, fate, harvest, and women&#x27;s labor. Neopagans consider Mokosh to be a miraculous maiden, the personification of female nature, and the great mother of all living beings. The fifth day of the week is dedicated to women and Mokosh. Communities consisting mainly of women often choose Mokosh as an object of worship. According to the Russian author Alexander Asov, the gods determine the place and time of a person&#x27;s birth, and their fate is woven by the goddess Makosh. Asov said her sign is a ten-pointed red star on a blue background. 

According to the neopagan author Vadim Kazakov, Veles is the son of Svarog and Mokosh, and Dola and Nedola are Mokosh&#x27;s younger sisters. Veles may also be considered Mokosh&#x27;s husband. Another husband of Mokosh may be Stribog, with whom she has a daughter Kupala and a son Yarilo. Another neopagan author and &quot;volkhv&quot; (wise man) Nikolai Spyransky considers Mokosh to be one of the rozhanitsy. The neopagan community, the Kingdom of Mokosh was named after the goddess. The community holds two festivals that are dedicated to the goddess; spring Mokosh is celebrated on March 24 and autumn Mokosh ih celebrated on September 24. In the Union of Slavic Communities of the Slavic Native Faith (USCSNF), chicken is consumed as the ritual food at feasts in honor of Mokosh.

The ritual calendar of the &quot;Veles circle&quot; association, which includes the &quot;Rodolubiye&quot; community, includes the holiday of the Day of Mokosh or Earth Day, which is celebrated on May 9 when Mother Earth awakens after winter. On this day, the goddess is still resting and must not be disturbed by plowing, hoeing, or pile driving. The summer festival Mokosh&#x27;s Svyatki or Mokrida is celebrated on July 19, when the Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates the day of Macrida. The Dożynki or Obzhynki is celebrated on August 15, and is dedicated to the gathering of the end of the harvest, for which Dazhbog and Mokosh are thanked. The goddess is considered the mother of the harvest and offerings of fruit are made to her on this day. The harvest festival falls on the Orthodox feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God. On this day, Russians celebrated the harvest festival and the beginning of autumn days. In other parts of Russia, the harvest festival was held on August 16 at the Bread Spas, which is also known as Nut Spas, Linen Spas or Water Spas, and is understood in neopaganism as a festival of Mokosh, the lady of the waters, in which women should take small offerings consisting of flax and yarn to a well. The Orthodox Church celebrates the Transfiguration of Jesus on this day. 

The festival of &#x27; (women&#x27;s summer), is a series of days from September 1 to 7 that were dedicated to Mokosh. The Day of Rod and Rozhanitsy in Slavic tradition falls on the Nativity of Mary, and is a celebration of family, harvest, and home. It is a time to sum up and welcome autumn in honor of the goddess Mokosh, who in this context is known as the Mother of Autumn. During the &#x27; festival, which coincides with the autumnal equinox, there is a ritual of thanksgiving for the harvest, which includes a ceremony in honor of Mokosh as she walks the fields toward the sun, where Mother Earth is presented with a ceremonial korovai cake. On this day, the &quot;svarga&quot; is closed and the gods rest until spring. The autumn day of Mokosh is celebrated on October 28, when the earth is believed to fall into winter sleep. After sunset, the priestesses of Mokosh, usually three in number, untangle the &quot;sliver of fate&quot;; they put threads into a cup of enchanted water and predict the future after watching the threads unravel. This holiday coincides with the Orthodox day of Paraskeva Friday.

The volkhvs of the &quot;Veles Circle&quot; developed the Small Circle of Svarog with the dedication of each month to a specific deity; the fifth month May is dedicated to Mokosh and Zhiva, and the eleventh month November to Mokosh and Dark Mara. The author Veleslav (Ilya Cherkasov) identified divine allocations related to the four seasons, days, world directions and elements. The allotments of Veles and Mokosh are associated with autumn, evening, sunset, and air.

On the feast of Kupala Night, women decorate birch trees with ribbons and wreaths of flowers. Neopagans interpret these decorations as an ancient form of sacrifice because the young tree is a symbol of Mother Earth or Mokosh. Nearby, a Yarilo doll made of green branches and hammered into the ground, dressed in ornate embroidery with sacred symbolism, is prepared and given food. The doll and the tree symbolically personify newlyweds.

Mokosh is mentioned in the &quot;Book of Veles&quot;, which the scientific community considers a forgery created by the writer in the 20th century. In the story of pagan Bacchanalia on page 32 in the 1994 edition of the &quot;Book of Veles&quot;, following Asov&#x27;s translation, &quot;green leaves and mokoshans&quot; are mentioned; green leaves are associated with Mokosh, which the translator understands as &quot;green leaves and seaweed&quot;. In the list of pagan gods on pages 302-304, the name of Mokosh does not appear.

According to the cultural scholars Harald Haarmann and Orlando Figes, the concept of Mother Russia is linked to the earth, &quot;mythical femininity&quot;, and motherhood due to the original correspondence of the words &quot;Russia&quot; and &quot;earth&quot; (, &quot;zemlya&quot;) with the grammatical feminine gender and the greater prevalence of depictions of Russia as a motherland rather than a fatherland. Russia&#x27;s feminine identity is also drawn from folklore, Russian poetry, and literary idioms, indicating the antiquity of the tradition of the connection between femininity and the earth, which was academics eventually elevated to the image of Mokosh as Mat Zemlya.

Mokosha Mons, a &quot;mons&quot; (mountain) on Venus, is named after Mokosh.

In modern culture, the names of East Slavic deities are used as advertising names. In particular, the name Mokosh or Makosh is used as an ergonym, especially in the names of companies related to agriculture, crafts, cosmetology, and tailoring because in popular culture, Mokosh is understood as the goddess of female crafts. Religious scholar Andrey Beskov noted company naming is often based on pseudoscientific speculation.

Higher School of Economics (HSE) staff investigated the linguosemiotic aspect of Russian folk culture. To study it, they conducted an association survey in which among the proposed words, the name &quot;Mokosh&quot; was represented by a variant of &quot;Makosh&quot;. Respondents did not notice this change in spelling, which is probably due to the de-etymologization of the deity&#x27;s name in contemporary literature containing its variants &quot;Maketa&quot;, &quot;Makosh&quot;, &quot;Makosha&quot;, &quot;Mokosh&quot;, and &quot;Mokosha&quot;. , there is no established spelling for this name.

<doc id="600076" wikidata="Q982848" url="?curid=600076" title="Orhan Veli Kanık">
<text>Orhan Veli Kanık or Orhan Veli (14 April 1914 – 14 November 1950) was a Turkish poet. Kanık is one of the founders of the Garip Movement together with Oktay Rıfat and Melih Cevdet. Aiming to fundamentally transform traditional form in Turkish poetry, he introduced colloquialisms into the poetic language. Besides his poetry, Kanık crammed a large volume of works including essays, articles and translations into just 36 years.

Orhan Veli shunned everything old in order to be able to bring about a new &#x27;taste&#x27;, refusing to use syllable and aruz meters. He professed to regarding rhyme primitive, literary rhetoric techniques such as metaphor, simile, hyperbole unnecessary. Set out &quot;to do away with all tradition, everything that bygone literatures taught&quot;, although this desire of Kanık limits the technical possibilities in his poetry, the poet broke new grounds for himself with the themes and personalities he covered and the vocabulary he employed. He brought the poetic language closer to the spoken language by adopting a plain phraseology.
In 1941 his poems embodying these ideas were published in a poetry volume named &quot;Garip&quot;, released jointly with his friends Oktay Rıfat and Melih Cevdet, which led to the emergence of the Garip movement. This movement had a huge influence especially between the years 1945–1950 on Republican era Turkish verse. The &quot;Garip&quot; poetry is accepted as a touchstone in Turkish verse for its both destructive and constructive effects.

At first Kanık mostly was found peculiar, he was criticized harshly, and heaped upon much opprobrium because of the innovations he introduced to poetry. Although Orhan Veli&#x27;s tradition-transgressing works were first received with bemusement and dismay, and were subject to derision and contempt later, they have always aroused interest. This interest however, eventually led to an increase in understanding of, and affection and admiration for the poet. Sait Faik Abasıyanık called attention to this aspect of Orhan Veli&#x27;s public standing identifying him as &quot;a poet who was much scrutinized, at times mocked, at times embraced, then again rejected, to be once again acclaimed; who achieved both great fame and notoriety in his time&quot;.

Although he stands out with his Garip period poems, Orhan Veli had eschewed writing poetry of a &quot;single type&quot;. Kanık had been renewing himself and searching without cease throughout his career in literature, a long adventure of poetry in a short life, that consists of different stages. Oktay Rıfat has explained this by saying: &quot;Orhan lived in his very short lifetime an adventure in poetry equal to a few generations of French poets. Turkish poetry became head to head with European poetry thanks to his pen.&quot;, and &quot;A transformation which several generations back to back could maybe achieve, he completed in a few years.&quot;

== Life ==

=== Childhood and education ===
Orhan Veli Kanık was born at number 9 Çayır Alley on the İshak Ağa Climb in Yalıköy Beykoz, on 14 April 1914. His father, Mehmet Veli, was the son of Fehmi Bey, a merchant from İzmir, while his mother was Fatma Nigar, Hacı Ahmet Bey&#x27;s daughter from Beykoz. According to the population registry, his birth name is Ahmet Orhan, but he came to be known as Orhan Veli after his father before a Surname Law was enacted in Turkey. His father, Veli Kanık was a clarinetist in the Imperial Military Band at the time of his marriage. He became a conductor when the band moved to Ankara to become the Presidential Symphony Orchestra after the declaration of Republic in Turkey. Because of this new position, as well as that of a professor of harmony in Music Teachers&#x27; School (later Ankara State Conservatory) he lived in Ankara between the years 1923–1948. Veli Bey also served for a while as a director at Ankara Radio during this period. Later on he moved to Istanbul Conservatory to serve as a member of its scientific board, and he also worked as an audio specialist in İstanbul Radio. Orhan Veli had two younger siblings: journalist Adnan Veli Kanık of Vatan Newspaper and Füruzan Yolyapan. It appears the poet also had a baby sister named Ayşe Zerrin who died in Ankara at the age of one.
Orhan Veli spent his childhood years in Beykoz, Beşiktaş and Cihangir. He started at the kindergarten class of Anafartalar Elementary School in Akaretler during the days of Armistice. After a year however, he was enrolled as a boarding student in Galatasaray High School. He was circumcised at a mass ceremony organized by Caliph Abdülmecit in the Yıldız Palace when was seven. In 1925 after completing fourth grade he left Galatasaray High School to move with his mother to Ankara on his father&#x27;s wish. There he was enrolled in the Gazi Elementary School. After a year he moved to Ankara High School for Boys as a boarder. Kanık suffered several health problems in his childhood. At five he was badly burnt and had to receive treatment for a prolonged period. He contracted measles at nine, and scarlet fever when he was seventeen years old.

Kanık&#x27;s interest in literature began in elementary school years. A story of his was published in the magazine &quot;Çocuk Dünyası&quot; (Child&#x27;s World) at this time. He met his lifelong friend Oktay Rıfat Horozcu in seventh grade. He would make friends with Melih Cevdet Anday a few years later, at a student show in a Community Center. In Kanık&#x27;s first year of high school Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar was his teacher and an early mentor providing advice and guidance. The poet published a magazine named &quot;Sesimiz&quot; (Our Voice) with his friends Oktay Rıfat and Melih Cevdet during his high school years. This stage in the artist&#x27;s life was when he learned and gained an appreciation of the rules and harmony of the traditional aruz meter, and wrote his first poems.

He also exhibited an interest in theater while in high school. He had parts in several public performances, in the play &quot;Aktör Kin&quot; starring Raşit Rıza, as &quot;Üstad-ı Sanî&quot; in Ahmet Vefik Paşa&#x27;s Moliere adaptation &quot;Zor Nikâh&quot; (Le Mariage forcé) staged by Ercüment Behzat Lav in the Ankara Community Center, and as the &quot;father&quot; in Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;Monna Vanna&quot;. Kanık would keep up his involvement in theater in later years as a translator, translating many plays into Turkish.

The poet graduated from high school in 1932. He was enrolled in the philosophy chair of Istanbul University&#x27;s Department of Literature. In 1933 he was elected the president of the Department of Literature Students&#x27; Association. He dropped out of the university in 1935 without obtaining his degree. He continued with his teacher&#x27;s assistant position at the Galatasaray High School for another year after dropping out of college.

=== Later life and literary career ===
Kanık moved to Ankara and was hired at Telegraph Department International Orders Bureau of the PTT, the Turkish national mail and telegraph service. He got together with his old friend Oktay Rıfat and Melih Cevdet, and the trio began writing poetry in a similar style. In 1936 Orhan Veli&#x27;s poems &quot;Oaristys&quot;, &quot;Ebabil&quot;, &quot;Eldorado&quot;, &quot;Düşüncelerimin Başucunda&quot; were published in the &quot;Varlık&quot; magazine upon Nahid Sırrı Örik&#x27;s suggestion. In the magazine Orhan Veli and his friends were introduced with these words: &quot;Varlık is boosting its cadre of poets with new and powerful young pens. Orhan Veli, whose four poems you may read below, manifests a mature art even though he has never been published before. In our future issues he will bespeak better the new breath he and his friends Oktay Rıfat, Melih Cedet and Mehmet Ali Sel are bringing to our poetry.&quot;

These first poems were followed by others, some of which were published under the alias Mehmet Ali Sel. Between 1936 and 1942 his poetry and essays were published in the magazines &quot;İnsan&quot;, &quot;Ses&quot;, &quot;Gençlik&quot;, &quot;Küllük&quot;, &quot;İnkılâpçı Gençlik&quot; as well as Varlık. Because of the form, structure and content of his works from the early days of this period, he was seen as a syllabic verse poet. After 1937 however, Kanık, like Horozcu and Anday, began publishing new style poems.

In 1939 Orhan Veli was in a car accident with his friend Melih Cevdet, as a result of which he was in a coma for twenty days. Melih Cevdet was driving the car they were in when it rolled off the top of Çubuk Dam. In May 1942 the Garip collection was published. This volume included 24 poems from Orhan Veli, along with 16 by Melih Cevdet and 20 by Oktay Rıfat. Orhan Veli had also penned the sensational introduction of the volume. Garip marks the beginning of the Garip movement, also known as the &quot;Birinci Yeni&quot; (the First New). Kanık, Horozcu and Anday were adopting a radical stance rejecting both the syllabist tradition and Ahmet Haşim&#x27;s poetry that preceded them, and Nazım Hikmet&#x27;s social-realist verse. The poetry and the introduction of the Garip volume caused controversy in the Turkish literary world. A specific line by Orhan Veli became a focus of dispute: &quot;Yazık oldu Süleyman Efendi&#x27;ye&quot;. Some denounced it, and there were also some charges of plagiarism, yet on the other hand a number of critics found it to be one of the most eloquently written lines in Turkish. All the surrounding debate popularized the line to the point that, according to Nurullah Ataç, &quot;it was in all the ferries, trams, coffeehouses&quot;, indeed becoming an idiomatic expression. Another line by the poet that has been at least as popular in daily language is &quot;Bir de rakı şişesinde balık olsam&quot; (..one more thing, would that I were a fish in a bottle of rakı), which Orhan Veli had written specifically to satirize Ahmet Haşim&#x27;s famous line &quot;Göllerde bu dem bir kamış olsam (Would that in this moment I were a cane of reed in the lakes)&quot;.

He left PTT in 1942 for his mandatory military service. He served until 1945 in Kavakköy in Gallipoli. During this time only six poems of his were published. He was discharged in 1945 as a lieutenant and started working in the Translations Department of the Ministry of Education. His translations from French were published in the Classics series of the Ministry. He published a volume of poetry titled &quot;Vazgeçemediğim&quot; in February 1945, and a second edition of Garip containing only his poetry in April. These were followed by &quot;Destan Gibi&quot; in 1946 and &quot;Yenisi&quot; in 1947.

With the departure of Hasan Âli Yücel as the minister of education following the 1946 elections, the Translations Office he had founded lost its prominence in the ministry. Kanık resigned shortly after. In later years he would point to the discomfort of the oppressive atmosphere that had taken over the ministry with the incoming minister Reşat Şemsettin Sirer as the reason for his resignation. He started writing essays and reviews in the newspapers &quot;Hür&quot; and &quot;Zincirli Hürriyet&quot; published by Mehmet Ali Aybar. In 1948 he translated La Fontaine&#x27;s tales into Turkish and published his &quot;Yolcu Notları&quot; in the &quot;Ulus&quot; newspaper.

Gatherings with friends such as Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu, Abidin Dino, Necati Cumalı, Sabahattin Eyüboğlu, Oktay Rıfat and Melih Cevdet, who had all found themselves in a similar situation after the changes in the Ministry of Education, led to the idea of bringing out a new magazine together at the end of 1948. Financially supported by Mahmut Dikerdem the literary magazine &quot;Yaprak&quot; was a biweekly. Orhan Veli was the publisher and the editor in chief, which got him deeply involved with the financial health of the publication, at one point even causing him to sell his coat to cover costs. He had had to sell the paintings given to him as gifts by Abidin Dino to pay for bringing out the very last issue. &quot;Yaprak&quot;&#x27;s first issue came out on 1 January 1949, and it was continued for 28 issues in total until June 1950, bringing to public works by many writers and poets including Cahit Sıtkı Tarancı, Sait Faik Abasıyanık, Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca, Cahit Külebi. In &quot;Yaprak&quot; Orhan Veli&#x27;s intellectual and opinion leader aspects besides his position as a poet also came to light. He opinionated on the upcoming elections in the magazine. Socially conscious poetry by Oktay Rıfat and Melih Cevdet were published. In the same time period Orhan Veli, Oktay Rıfat and Melih Cevdet campaigned for Nazım Hikmet&#x27;s release from prison, holding a three-day hunger strike. During 1949 Orhan Veli adapted Nasreddin Hoca tales into verse, published his last volume of poetry &quot;Karşı&quot; and co-translated Charles Lamb adaptations of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;the Merchant of Venice&quot; into Turkish with Şehbal Erdeniz.

=== Death ===
After Yaprak was shuttered Kanık moved back to Istanbul. He was visiting Ankara for a couple of weeks when on 10 November 1950 he fell down a hole in the street dug by the municipality works, hurt seemingly lightly. He returned to Istanbul two days later. On 14 November he felt sick while having lunch at a friend&#x27;s house and was admitted to hospital. He was misdiagnosed and treated for alcohol poisoning, slipping into a coma at 20:00 the same evening. He died of a brain aneurysm at 23:30 in Cerrahpaşa Hospital, Istanbul.

For the 38th anniversary of his death a sculpture of him was inaugurated in Aşiyan Asri Cemetery where he is buried. In 1998 two more sculptures were made featuring him, this time in Vişnezade. He is featured in Gürdal Duyars &quot;Şairler Sofası&quot; which was erected in a park of the same name. The sculpture features him in a composition that also includes 6 other famous Turkish poets. In the same park Namık Denizhans sculpture of Orhan Veli was also erected.

<text>A Gugelhupf (also &quot;Kugelhupf&quot;, &quot;Guglhupf&quot;, &quot;Gugelhopf&quot;, , and, in France, &quot;kouglof&quot; , &quot;kougelhof&quot;, or &quot;kougelhopf&quot;, is a cake traditionally baked in a distinctive ring pan, similar to Bundt cake, but leavened with baker&#x27;s yeast. 

There are three main types: cocoa; plain with a hint of vanilla and lemon zest; and a marbled combination of the two. It is especially popular as a traditional cake in Central Europe. In the cuisine of the Pennsylvania Dutch it is known as &quot;Deitscher Kuche&quot; (German cake).
In late Medieval Austria, a Gugelhupf was served at major community events such as weddings, and was decorated with flowers, leaves, candles, and seasonal fruits. The name persisted through the Austro-Hungarian Empire, eventually becoming standardized in Viennese cookbooks as a refined, rich cake, flavored with rosewater and almond. Many regional variations exist, testifying to the widespread popularity of the Gugelhupf tradition.

The Gugelhupf was the sweet chosen to represent Austria in the Café Europe initiative of the Austrian presidency of the European Union, on Europe Day 2006.

==Etymology==

The word&#x27;s origin is disputed.

The old, South German name combines the Middle High German words &quot;Gugel&quot; (see also gugel, a long-pointed hood) derived from Latin &quot;cucullus&quot;, meaning hood or bonnet, and &quot;Hupf&quot;, which literally means &quot;to hop&quot; or &quot;to jump&quot;. The Brothers Grimm wrote that the &quot;hupf&quot; may be a reference to the &quot;jumping&quot; of the dough caused by the yeast, but no firm etymological evidence exists for this. The earliest known Gugelhupf recipe, in Marx Rumpolt&#x27;s 1581 cookbook, describes a &quot;Hat Cake&quot; with the distinctive shape and ornamentation recommendation, suggesting a similarity or intentional imitation of the shape of a medieval hat.

In the Chuvash language, there is a dish called &quot;&quot;Kugel Huplu&quot; - and it translates as a &quot;Closed Pie (kugăl - pie, huplu - closed)&quot;, perhaps the name &quot;Kugel hupf&quot;&quot; was brought by the Huns (Ogur) tribes to Europe. Also, the Chuvash, being descendants of the Volga Bulgars, often traded on the Volga with Scandinavian and German tribes, as described in the &quot;Notes of Ibn Fadlan&quot;.

It is spelled in Hungarian, (Cyrillic: ) in Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian, in Alsatian, in French and in Romanian. In Western Slovenia, it is also known as , and in Central and Eastern Slovenia, .

In Upper Austria, it is known as &quot;Wacker&quot; or &quot;Wacka&quot;. It is called in Czech and Slovak, and &quot;babka&quot; in Polish. In Slovenia, the standard word is .

==Description==
Gugelhupf is made with a soft yeast dough, baked in a high, creased, toroidal pan. Depending on the region it can contain raisins, almonds or sometimes also Kirschwasser cherry brandy. Traditional Gugelhupf always contains some dried fruit, usually raisins, and sometimes other dried fruits like sour cherries can be soaked in orange juice or liquor. Some regional varieties (Czech, Hungarian and Slovak) are filled with a layer of sweetened ground poppy seeds or chocolate filling similar to Jewish babka.

It is not closely related to the Christmas cake in Italy known as the pandoro nor to the American Bundt cake as that is not yeast based. Sometimes a regular pound cake or a marble cake made without yeast but baked in a Gugelhupf pan is also called Gugelhupf.

<text>State Library Victoria (SLV) is the state library of Victoria, Australia. Located in Melbourne, it was established in 1854 as the Melbourne Public Library, making it Australia&#x27;s oldest public library and one of the first free libraries in the world. It is also Australia&#x27;s busiest public library and, as of 2023, the third busiest library globally.

The library has remained on the same site in the central business district since it was established fronting Swanston Street, and over time has expanded to cover a block bounded also by La Trobe, Russell, and Little Lonsdale streets. The library&#x27;s collection consists of over five million items, which in addition to books includes manuscripts, paintings, maps, photographs and newspapers, with a special focus on material from Victoria, including the diaries of the European founders of present-day Melbourne John Batman and John Pascoe Fawkner, the folios of colonial explorer James Cook, and items related to Ned Kelly, notably his armour and the original Jerilderie Letter.

==History==
===19th century===

In 1853, the decision to build a combined library, museum and gallery was made at the instigation of Governor of Victoria Charles La Trobe and Sir Redmond Barry. A competition was held, won by the recently arrived architect Joseph Reed, whose firm and its successors went on to design most of the later extensions, as well as numerous 19th-century landmarks such as the Melbourne Town Hall, and the Royal Exhibition Building.

On the same day of 3 July 1854, the recently inaugurated Governor Sir Charles Hotham laid the foundation stone of both the new library complex and the University of Melbourne. The library&#x27;s first stage (the central part of the Swanston Street wing) opened on 11 February 1856, with a collection of 3,800 books chosen by Mr Justice Barry, the President of Trustees. Augustus H. Tulk, the first librarian, was appointed three months after the opening. The Melbourne Public Library as it was then known was one of the first free public libraries in the world, open to anyone over 14 years of age, so long as they had clean hands.

The complex of buildings that now house the Library was built in numerous stages, housing various library spaces, art galleries and museum displays, finally filling the entire block in 1992. In 1860 Joseph Reed designed a grand complex for the whole block including a domed section facing Russell Street to House the Museum and Gallery, painting a broad canvas that was more or less followed over the next century.

The next stage was the south part of the front wing, opened in 1859, including the elaborate first floor Queen&#x27;s Reading Room (now Queen&#x27;s Hall). The northern part (now Hansen Hall) was added complete in 1864 by Abraham Linacre, but the classical portico was not built until 1870.

A number of temporary halls and a pagoda were built in 1866 for the Intercolonial Exhibition of Australasia just behind the front wing. From 1870, some of these housed the Industrial &amp; Technological Museum of Victoria (I&amp;T Museum). That year, author, journalist and bohemian figure Marcus Clarke joined the library staff, serving as sub-librarian from 1874 until his death in 1881.

The Library Museums and National Gallery Act 1869 formed a single body to run the Public Library of Victoria, National Gallery of Victoria (NGV), National Museum of Victoria, and the then embryotic I&amp;T Museum.

In 1875 the McArthur Gallery was built to house the NGV.

Barry Hall, along Little Lonsdale Street, was built in 1886. This now houses the Wheeler Centre. In 1887, the Buvelot Gallery opened for the NGV, (the gallery was later known as Swinburne Hall). It now houses the Arts Reading Room.

1892 saw extensive expansion on the site. In that year, what is now the Cowen Gallery (was Stawell Gallery) and Victoria Gallery (was La Trobe Gallery) opened for NGV use. The Lending Library opened. And what is now the Redmond Barry Reading Room was built to house the I&amp;T Museum. In 1899, this was taken over by the National Museum, which renamed it McCoy Hall after Frederick McCoy, its first director. The I&amp;T Museum was put into storage.

===20th century===

In 1909, most of the remaining Intercolonial Exhibition buildings were closed and the Great Hall was demolished. On part of the land they occupied, Baldwin Spencer Hall was built (now the &quot;Russell Street Welcome Zone&quot;), and work began on the library&#x27;s famed Domed Reading Room. Opened in 1913, it was designed by Bates, Peebles and Smart, the successor to Joseph Reed&#x27;s firm, now known as Bates Smart. Its construction led to much less use of Queen&#x27;s Hall, which led to it becoming the home of a reborn I&amp;T Museum in 1915.
The reading room was refurbished and reopened in 2003 as the La Trobe Reading Room, with the dome&#x27;s skylights that had been hidden behind copper sheathing since 1959 again revealed.

In 1928 the South Rotunda opened. The McAllan Gallery on the LaTrobe Street side was built in 1932. In 1940, the North Rotunda opened.

The Public Library, National Gallery and Museums Act 1944 organisationally separated the four major cultural institutions, while they continued to share the one site.

In 1959, the dome&#x27;s skylights were covered in copper sheets due to water leakage, creating the dim atmosphere that characterised the Library for decades.

In 1963, the south-west courtyard next to the dome became a planetarium. (This space is now the Pauline Gandel Children&#x27;s Quarter.)

In 1965, the La Trobe Library was opened to house the Library&#x27;s Australiana collections. This building later became the Conference Centre and Theatrette.

The National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) moved to a new home in St Kilda Road in 1968. This led to the I&amp;T Museum moving out of Queen&#x27;s Hall and into the NGV&#x27;s buildings. Queen&#x27;s Hall returned to Library use.

In 1971 the Lending Library closed. Melbourne&#x27;s CBD was to be without a public lending library until the opening of the City Library in 2004.

Public Record Office Victoria was once the Archives Department of the Library. In 1973 the Public Records Act established the Public Record Office as the state&#x27;s archive authority, independent of the Library. The Office moved to Laverton in 1977, then to North Melbourne in 2004. PROV now frequently supplies exhibits for the Old Treasury Building museum.
In 1973, construction began on Museum station (now Melbourne Central station), which, upon completion in 1981, provided direct heavy rail access to the State Library for the first time. The National Museum and what was now known as the Science Museum of Victoria merged in 1983 to form the Museum of Victoria, filling the Russell St end of the site. Part of this combined museum was moved to Spotswood to form Scienceworks in 1992, with the bulk of the galleries remaining until 1997. At that time the remaining museum closed temporarily before part reopened elsewhere as the Immigration Museum in 1998, and the rest as the Melbourne Museum in 2000.

The Library underwent major refurbishments between 1990 and 2004, designed by architects Ancher Mortlock &amp; Woolley. The project cost approximately A$200 million.

In 1995, the north-west courtyard next to the dome was glassed in to become a reading room (and later the Genealogy Centre, and now the Conversation Quarter). In 1998, the north-east courtyard was glassed in to become the Newspaper Reading Room (and is now the Ideas Quarter).

The NGV returned to the Library building from 1999 to 2002, occupying the Russell Street halls while its St Kilda Road buildings were renovated.

The reading room closed in 1999 to allow for renovation, when the skylights were reinstated.

By the late 1990s, on Sundays between 2.30 pm and 5.30 pm, a speakers&#x27; forum took place on the library forecourt. Orators took turns in speaking on various subjects, and it was a popular location for protest meetings and a rallying point for marches.

===21st century===

A building redevelopment included the creation of a number of exhibition spaces which opened between 2001 and 2003. Some of these are used to house permanent exhibitions &quot;The Mirror of the World: Books and Ideas&quot; and &quot;The Changing Face of Victoria&quot;, as well as a display from the Pictures Collection in the Cowen Gallery. As a result of the redevelopment, State Library Victoria could now be considered one of the largest exhibiting libraries in the world.

The now renamed La Trobe Reading Room reopened in 2003. Also in 2003, the final dome-side courtyards were enclosed and became the Arts Reading Room (now the Create Quarter) and Experimedia (now Pauline Gandell Children&#x27;s Quarter).

In February 2010, the southern wing of the library building on Little Lonsdale Street was reopened as the Wheeler Centre, part of Melbourne&#x27;s city of literature initiative.

In 2015 the Library embarked on a five-year, million redevelopment project, Vision 2020, to transform its public spaces, programs and facilities to better meet the changing needs of the community. On 29 April 2015 the Minister for Creative Industries Martin Foley announced that the 2015–16 State Budget would provide million towards the redevelopment of State Library Victoria, including the restoration of the Queen&#x27;s Hall, the creation of a rooftop garden terrace, a dedicated children&#x27;s and youth space, and the opening up 40 per cent more of the building to the public. In late 2017, the library&#x27;s contribution of million from donations was eventually raised. In September 2018, the main Swanston Street entrance was temporarily closed and replaced by the newly refurbished Russell Street and La Trobe Street entrances.

In December 2019 the Library officially completed its Vision 2020 redevelopment project. A huge amount of space left vacant for nearly 20 years was again open to the public.

In 2024, the Library faced controversy for canceling online writing workshops aimed at teenagers, reportedly due to the host authors&#x27; pro-Palestine views in the Israel-Gaza war, despite the official reason being a &quot;child and cultural safety review&quot;.

== Forecourt ==

The grassy lawn in front of the library&#x27;s grand entrance on Swanston Street is a popular lunch-spot for the city&#x27;s workers and students at the adjacent RMIT University. Originally enclosed by a picket fence, then by a wrought iron fence and gates in the 1870s, the space was opened up with the removal of the fence and the creation of diagonal paths in 1939.

The forecourt includes a number of statues. A pair of bronze lions flanked the entry from the 1860s until they were removed in 1937 due to deterioration. A memorial statue of Sir Redmond Barry, Q.C., by James Gilbert and built by Percival Ball was installed on the central landing of the main stairs in 1887. Flanking the entrance plaza are Saint George and the Dragon, by the English sculptor Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm, installed in 1889 and Jeanne d&#x27;Arc (Joan of Arc), a replica of the statue by French sculptor Emmanuel Frémiet, installed in 1907. World War I commemorative statues &#x27;Wipers&#x27; and &#x27;The Driver&#x27; were at the centre points of the 1939 diagonal paths, but were relocated to the ground of the Shrine of Remembrance in 1998. A statue of Charles La Trobe, by Australian sculptor Peter Corlett, was installed in 2006 in the north east corner of the lawn.

In 2012, the Dromkeen Foundation and Scholastic Australia gifted the entire Dromkeen Collection, along with the Dromkeen archive, to State Library Victoria. The collection includes a number of sculptures featuring children&#x27;s book characters that are installed in the Library forecourt.

The forecourt is often used for rallies and protests.

==Reading rooms and other spaces==

===The dome (La Trobe Reading Room and Dome Gallery)===

The landmark Domed Reading Room was opened in 1913, and was designed by Norman G. Peebles of Bates Smart. Its six storey high octagonal space was designed to hold over a million books and up to 600 readers; as of 2024 it can house 32,000 books and 320 readers at its desks. It is 34.75 metres in both diameter and height, and its oculus is nearly 5 metres wide. The dome was the largest in the world on completion.

In 2003, the area under the dome was officially renamed the La Trobe Reading Room, and now houses the Library&#x27;s Australiana collection, previously held in the 1965 La Trobe Building. The Dome Gallery in Level 4 houses the free permanent exhibition &quot;World of the book&quot;. Level 5 housed the long-running exhibition &quot;The changing face of Victoria&quot; until its closure on 6 February 2022. Level 6 provides visitors with a view of the reading room below.

The dome is also home to the Victorian Indigenous Research Centre.

===The Ian Potter Queen&#x27;s Hall===
The central portion of the Ian Potter Queen&#x27;s Hall opened in 1856 as the Library&#x27;s original reading room, above the ground floor rooms below. After the opening of the larger Domed Reading Room in 1913, it was less used. In 1915, it became the home of the Industrial and Technological Museum, which remained here until 1969. It became a reading room of the Library again at this time. It closed to the public in 2003 due to disrepair before being renovated and reopening in 2019 as a mixed-use study space containing Victorian young adult literature. After hours, the Ian Potter Queen&#x27;s Hall functions as a special events venue.

===Redmond Barry Reading Room===

Located at the eastern end of the library, the Redmond Barry Reading Room is home to the library&#x27;s contemporary collection of books, magazines and periodicals with the mezzanine housing folio-size books and providing additional independent study desks. It was built in 1893 as the home for the Industrial and Technological Museum.

==Collections and services==
=== Exhibitions ===
The Library has a permanent exhibition, &quot;World of the Book&quot;. The exhibition features more than 300 rare, remarkable, historically significant items in the State Collection, celebrating the unique place books have in our culture. The Library also mounts special exhibitions of the Library collection and of international loans. 2022-23&#x27;s &quot;The Rest Is Up To You: Melbourne Fringe Festival 1982-2042&quot; was the Library&#x27;s most popular exhibition on record. It was co-curated with the Melbourne Fringe Festival and featured innovative display of oral history recordings about the festival in celebration of its 40th anniversary, as well as items from the Melbourne Fringe archive held by the Library. In 2023, &quot;MIRROR: New views on photography&quot; was the first exhibition at an Australian cultural institution to embed sign language throughout. The exhibition showcases over 140 photographs from the State Collection, alongside creative responses from emerging and established Victorian storytellers.
In October 2023, the Library opened &quot;Luminous: A thousand years of Hebrew manuscripts&quot;. This is the third in a series of exhibitions at the Library featuring major international loans and about the significance of books and the written word to various cultures. &quot;Luminous&quot; follows &quot;The Medieval Imagination&quot; in 2008, which looked at European manuscripts, and 2012&#x27;s &quot;Love and Devotion&quot;, which focused on Persian manuscripts.

The Library&#x27;s first born-digital exhibition was launched in 2023. &quot;Beyond the Book: A journey through the Treasures of the Emmerson Collection&quot; used state-of-the-art photogrammetry techniques to digitally capture rare books about the English Civil War in extreme detail. The exhibition was the result of an Australian Research Council linkage project. The Library worked with the Australian National University, the University of Newcastle and the Victoria University of Wellington | Te Herenga Waka.

=== Events ===
The Library&#x27;s contemporary and heritage spaces are often used for major cultural events, such as Melbourne Writers Festival, Melbourne Fashion Week, Art After Dark, Blak &amp; Bright Literary Festival and YIRRAMBOI.

=== Ask a Librarian ===
State Library Victoria offers a free reference enquiry service called Ask a Librarian. Onsite and online visitors to the Library can seek help with research questions including family history research.

=== eResources ===
Many of the library&#x27;s eResources are available from home to any Victorian registered as a State Library Access member. Databases include multi-subject magazine and journal article databases; newspaper archives of most major Australian and international papers; and specialist subject databases. There are thousands of eBooks in the Library&#x27;s collection.

=== Photographs ===
The library&#x27;s collection numbers 1,253,543 photographs. These have been subject to an extensive digitising program. Out-of-copyright images, that do not have cultural sensitivities, are made available as freely downloadable TIF format.

=== &quot;The La Trobe Journal&quot; ===
This publication was founded by the Friends of State Library Victoria in 1968 to promote interest in the Library&#x27;s Australiana collection (then housed in the &quot;La Trobe Library&quot;). In 1998, the State Library Victoria Foundation became the sponsor of the journal, enabling the publication to expand considerably. From 2014 the journal has been published by State Library Victoria and is published once a year in December.

===Chess Collection===
The library houses a wide range of materials dedicated to the history, study and practice of chess. It contains a collection of items from the Anderson Chess Collection, one of the three largest public chess collections in the world. In addition to bookshelves containing an extensive range of books and periodicals relating to chess, the room has game tables with chessboards and pieces, and a few glass cabinets containing historical chess paraphernalia. The Chess Room was closed in February 2017 with collections temporarily moved to the LaTrobe Reading Room. In 2019, the chess collection and game sets were relocated to the renovated Ian Potter Queen&#x27;s Hall.

==National eDeposit (NED)==
As a member library of National and State Libraries Australia (NSLA), the organisation collaborated on the creation of the national edeposit (NED) system, which enables publishers from all over Australia to upload electronic publications as per the 2016 amendment to the &quot;Copyright Act 1968&quot; and other regional legislation relating to legal deposit, and makes these publications publicly accessible online (depending on access conditions) from anywhere via Trove. As CEO of State Library Victoria and Chair of NSLA, Kate Torney played an important role on the steering committee, which met 100 times during the two-year build phase of the project.

==In popular culture==
The exterior of the Library is prominently featured at the conclusion of the post-World War III-set movie &quot;On the Beach&quot;.

Rock band Faker shot the music video for their 2005 single &quot;Hurricane&quot; in the La Trobe Reading Room.

The La Trobe Reading Room was featured in the 2012 film &quot;Any Questions for Ben?&quot;, in the scene in which Ben discusses the prospect of addressing his alma mater with his mentor, Sam.

The La Trobe Reading Room is the setting for a confrontation between Justin Theroux&#x27;s character Kevin Garvey and a librarian in the fourth episode of the third season of the critically acclaimed HBO drama series &quot;The Leftovers&quot;.

Parts of the Library were used for the SBS series &quot;Safe Home&quot;.

<doc id="600090" wikidata="Q1151014" url="?curid=600090" title="Mithraeum">
<text>A Mithraeum , sometimes spelled Mithreum and Mithraion (), is a temple erected in classical antiquity by the worshippers of Mithras. Most Mithraea can be dated between 100 BC and 300 AD, mostly in the Roman Empire.

The Mithraeum was either an adapted natural cave, cavern, or building imitating a cave. Where possible, the Mithraeum was constructed within or below an existing building, such as the Mithraeum found beneath the Basilica of San Clemente in Rome. While most Mithraea are underground, some feature openings in the ceiling to allow light to enter, a reminder of the connection to the universe and the passage of time. The site of a Mithraeum may also be identified by its singular entrance or vestibule, which stands across from an apse at the back of which stands an altar on a pedestal, often in a recess, and its &quot;cave,&quot; called the &quot;Spelaeum&quot; or &quot;Spelunca&quot;, with raised benches along the side walls for the ritual meal. Many mithraea that follow this basic plan are scattered over much of the Roman Empire&#x27;s former territory, mainly where the legions were stationed along the frontiers (such as Britain). Others may be recognized by their characteristic layout, even though converted into crypts beneath Christian churches.

From the structure of the Mithraea, it is possible to surmise that worshippers gathered for a common meal seated on the benches lining the walls.

&quot;Finally, the ubiquity of the Mithraeums’ distinctive banqueting benches implies the ubiquity of the cult meal as the &quot;liturgie ordinaire.&quot;&quot;

The Mithraeum primarily functioned as an area for initiation, into which the soul descends and exits. The Mithraeum itself was arranged as an &quot;image of the universe&quot;. Some researchers note that this movement, especially in the context of mithraic iconography (see below), seems to stem from the Neoplatonic concept that the &quot;running&quot; of the sun from solstice to solstice is a parallel for the movement of the soul through the universe, from pre-existence, into the body, and then beyond the physical body into an afterlife.

<doc id="600094" wikidata="Q221852" url="?curid=600094" title="Fahrenheit 9/11">
<text>Fahrenheit 9/11 is a 2004 American documentary film directed and written by, and starring filmmaker, director, political commentator and activist Michael Moore. The subjects of the film are the presidency of George W. Bush, the Iraq War, and the media&#x27;s coverage of the war. In the film, Moore states that American corporate media were cheerleaders for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and did not provide an accurate or objective analysis of the rationale for the war and the resulting casualties there.

The title of the film alludes to Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1953 novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, a dystopian view of the future United States, drawing an analogy between the autoignition temperature of paper and the date of the September 11 attacks; one of the film&#x27;s taglines was &quot;The Temperature at Which Freedom Burns&quot;.

The film debuted at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, where it was awarded the Palme d&#x27;Or, the festival&#x27;s highest award. It received generally positive reviews from critics, but it also generated intense controversy, particularly including disputes over its accuracy. The film became the highest-grossing documentary of all time, grossing over $220 million (although it was later surpassed by &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s This Is It&quot; in 2009). A follow-up, titled &quot;Fahrenheit 11/9&quot;, about the presidency of Donald Trump, was released in September 2018.

==Synopsis==
The documentary begins by suggesting that friends and political allies of George W. Bush at Fox News Channel tilted the election of 2000 by prematurely declaring Bush the winner. It then suggests that the handling of the voting controversy in Florida constituted election fraud.

The documentary then segues into the September 11 attacks of 2001. Moore says that Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center on his way to an elementary school in Florida. Bush is then shown sitting in an Emma E. Booker Elementary School classroom with children. When told that a second plane has crashed into the World Trade Center and that the nation is &quot;under attack&quot;, Bush allows the students to finish their book reading, and Moore notes that he continued reading &quot;The Pet Goat&quot; for nearly seven minutes.

Moore then discusses the complex relationships between the U.S. government and the Bush family; between the bin Laden family, the Saudi Arabian government, and the Taliban, which span over three decades. Moore then states that the United States government had evacuated 24 members of the bin Laden family on a secret flight shortly after the attacks, without subjecting them to any form of interrogation.

Moore moves on to examine George W. Bush&#x27;s Texas Air National Guard service record. Moore contends that Bush&#x27;s dry-hole oil well attempts were partially funded by the Saudis and by the bin Laden family through the intermediary of James R. Bath, whose name is shown to have been blacked out from Bush&#x27;s records. Moore alleges that these conflicts of interest suggest that the Bush administration does not serve in the interests of Americans. The movie continues by suggesting ulterior motives for the War in Afghanistan, including a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean.

Moore suggests that the Bush administration induced a climate of fear among the American population through the mass media. Moore then describes purported anti-terror efforts, including government infiltration of pacifist groups and other events, and the signing of the USA PATRIOT Act.

The documentary then turns to the subject of the Iraq War, comparing the lives of the Iraqis before and after the invasion. The citizens of Iraq are portrayed as living relatively happy lives prior to the country&#x27;s invasion by the U.S. Armed Forces. The film also takes pains demonstrating war cheerleading in the U.S. media and the general bias of journalists, with quotes from news organizations and embedded journalists. Moore suggests that atrocities will occur in Iraq and shows footage depicting U.S. abuse of prisoners.

Later in the film, Lila Lipscomb appears with her family after hearing of the death of her son, Sgt. Michael Pedersen, who was killed on April 2, 2003, in Karbala. Anguished and tearful, she begins to question the purpose of the war.

Tying together several themes and points, Moore compliments those serving in the U.S. military. He claims that the working class of America are always the first to join the Army, so that the people better off do not have to join. He states that those valuable troops should not be sent to risk their lives unless it is necessary to defend America. The credits roll while Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; plays. (Moore had originally intended to use the Who&#x27;s &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; but was denied permission by Pete Townshend).

Moore dedicated the film to his friend who was killed in the World Trade Center attacks and to those servicemen and women from Flint, Michigan that have been killed in Iraq: &quot;Michael Pedersen, Brett Petriken and all the soldiers from the Flint area who have died in the Iraq War ... Bill Weems and the 2973 who died on 9/11/01 ... and the countless thousands who have died in Afghanistan and Iraq as a result of our actions.&quot;

==Production==
Originally planned to be financed by Mel Gibson&#x27;s Icon Productions (which planned to give Michael Moore eight figures in upfront cash and potential backend),
&quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; was later picked up by Miramax Films and Wild Bunch in May 2003 after Icon Productions had abruptly dropped the financing deal it made. Miramax had earlier distributed another film for Moore, &quot;The Big One&quot;, in 1997.

At that time, Disney was the parent company of Miramax. According to the book &quot;DisneyWar&quot;, Disney executives did not know that Miramax agreed to finance the film until they saw a posting on the &quot;Drudge Report&quot;. Michael Eisner (the CEO of Disney at that time) called Harvey Weinstein (co-chairman of Miramax at that time) and ordered him to drop the film. In addition, Disney sent two letters to Weinstein demanding Miramax drop the film. Weinstein felt Disney had no right to block the releasing of &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; since the film&#x27;s $6 million budget was well below the level at which Miramax needed to seek Disney&#x27;s approval, and it would not be rated NC-17. But Weinstein was in contract negotiations with Disney, so he offered a compromise that he would drop the film if Disney did not like it. Disney responded by having Peter Murphy send Weinstein a letter stating that the film&#x27;s $6 million budget was only a bridge financing and Miramax would sell off its interest in the movie to get those $6 million back; according to the same letter, Miramax was also expected to publicly state that it would not release the film.

After &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; was nearly finished, Miramax held several preview screenings; they were &quot;testing through the roof&quot;. Weinstein informed Eisner that &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; was finished, and Eisner was surprised by the fact that Miramax had continued making the film. Weinstein asked several Disney executives (including Eisner) to watch the film, but all declined; Disney stated again that Miramax would not release the film, and Disney also accused Weinstein of hiding &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; by keeping it off production reports. Disney sent production vice President Brad Epstein to watch &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; on April 24, 2004. According to Weinstein, Epstein said he liked the film; but according to the report Epstein sent to the Walt Disney Company board of directors, Epstein explicitly criticized it. Eisner told Weinstein that Disney&#x27;s board had decided not to allow Miramax to release the film. Weinstein was furious and he asked George J. Mitchell (chairman of Disney at that time) to see the film, but Mitchell declined. Weinstein asked lawyer David Boies to help find a solution; the Weinsteins and Moore had also hired Chris Lehane to consult on the film&#x27;s release strategies. Lehane suggested to reveal Disney&#x27;s decision to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported about Disney&#x27;s decision on May 5, 2004. Disney stated that both Moore&#x27;s agent (Ari Emanuel) and Miramax were advised in May 2003 that Miramax would not be permitted to distribute the film. Disney representatives said Disney had the right to veto any Miramax film if it appeared that its distribution would be counterproductive to the interests of the company; indeed, Disney had blocked Miramax from releasing two films before: &quot;Kids&quot; and &quot;Dogma&quot;.

Because of these difficulties, distribution was first secured in numerous countries outside the U.S. On May 28, 2004, after more than a week of talks, Disney announced that Miramax film studio founders Harvey and Bob Weinstein had personally acquired the rights to the documentary after Disney declined to distribute it. The Weinsteins agreed to repay Disney for all costs to that point, estimated at $6 million. They also agreed to be responsible for all costs to finish the film and all marketing costs not paid by any third-party film distributors. A settlement between the Weinsteins and Disney was also reached so that 60% of the film&#x27;s profit would be donated to charity.

The Weinsteins established Fellowship Adventure Group to handle the distribution of this film. Fellowship Adventure Group joined forces with Lions Gate Entertainment (which had released two other Miramax-financed films &quot;O&quot; and &quot;Dogma&quot;) and IFC Films to release it in the United States theatrically. (Fellowship Adventure Group also handled the film&#x27;s U.S. home video distribution through Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment). Moore stated that he was &quot;grateful to them now that everyone who wants to see it will now have the chance to do so.

After being informed that the film had been given an R rating by the Motion Picture Association of America, Moore appealed the decision, hoping to obtain a PG-13 rating instead. Moore&#x27;s lawyer, former Governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, was not allowed to attend the hearing. The appeal was denied on June 22, 2004, and Cuomo contended that it was because he had been banned from the hearing. Some theaters chose to defy the MPAA and allow unchaperoned teenagers to attend screenings.

==Release==
The film was released theatrically by The Fellowship Adventure Group through a distribution arrangement with Lions Gate Entertainment. On the opening weekend of June 25–27, 2004, the film generated box-office revenues of $23.9 million in the United States and Canada, making it the weekend&#x27;s top-grossing film. Its opening weekend earned more than the entire U.S. theatrical run of any other feature-length documentary (including Moore&#x27;s previous film, &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;). The film released in the United Kingdom on July 2, 2004, and in France on July 7, 2004.

Moore has credited part of the theatrical success to the efforts of conservative groups to pressure theaters not to run the film, conjecturing that these efforts backfired by creating publicity. There were also efforts by liberal groups such as MoveOn.org encouraging attendance, in order to defy their political opponents&#x27; contrary efforts.

&quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; was screened in a number of Middle Eastern countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, and Egypt, but was immediately banned in Kuwait. &quot;We have a law that prohibits insulting friendly nations&quot;, said Abdul-Aziz Bou Dastour of the Kuwaiti Information Ministry. The film was not shown in Saudi Arabia as public movie theaters were not permitted from 1983 until 2017. The Saudi ruling elite subsequently launched an advertising campaign spanning nineteen US cities to counter criticism partly raised in the film. Democratic members of the Coalition Provisional Authority in U.S.-occupied Iraq had the film screened at the Republican Palace in Baghdad.

In Cuba, bootlegged versions of the film were shown in 120 theaters, followed by a prime-time television broadcast by the leading state-run network. It had been widely reported that this might affect its Oscar eligibility, since the film was broadcast on television less than nine months after its theatrical release. However, soon after that story had been published, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences issued a statement denying this, saying, &quot;If it was pirated or stolen or unauthorized we would not blame the producer or distributor for that&quot;. In addition, Wild Bunch, the film&#x27;s overseas distributor for Cuba, issued a statement denying a television deal had been struck with Cuban Television. The issue became moot when Moore decided to forgo Oscar eligibility, in favor of a pay-per-view televising of the film on November 1, 2004.

===Critical reception===
The film was received positively by critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 82% based on 237 reviews, with an average rating of 7.33/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;Extremely one-sided in its indictment of the Bush administration, but worth watching for the humor and the debates it&#x27;ll stir.&quot; It also received a score of 67 on Metacritic, based on 43 reviews.

Film critic Roger Ebert, who gave the documentary three and a half stars out of four, said that the film &quot;is less an exposé of George W. Bush than a dramatization of what Moore sees as a failed and dangerous presidency&quot;, adding: &quot;Moore brings a fresh impact to familiar material by the way he marshals his images&quot;.

Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described the film as &quot;rambling, troubling and sometimes rousing&quot;, and wrote: &quot;At its best, &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; is an impressionist burlesque of contemporary American politics that culminates in a somber lament for lives lost in Iraq. But the good stuff—and there&#x27;s some extremely good stuff—keeps getting tainted by Mr. Moore&#x27;s poison-camera penchant for drawing dark inferences from dubious evidence.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put it on its end-of-the-decade, &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;Michael Moore&#x27;s anti-Bush polemic gave millions of frustrated liberals exactly what they needed to hear in 2004—and infuriated just about everyone else. Along the way, it became the highest-grossing documentary of all time.&quot;

===Commercial performance===
Grossing over $222 million total worldwide, the film is the highest grossing documentary of all time according to Box Office Mojo. The film had a general release in the United States and Canada on June 23, 2004. It has since been released in 42 more countries. On Al-Jazeera in August 2012, Moore claimed that the movie &quot;grossed about half a billion dollars&quot; worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film released by Lionsgate until it was surpassed by &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; in 2012.

===Home media===
&quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; was released to DVD and VHS on October 5, 2004, an unusually short turnaround time after theatrical release. In the first days of the release, the film broke records for the highest-selling documentary ever. About two million copies were sold on the first day, most of which (1.4 million) were sold as rentals.

A companion book, &quot;The Official Fahrenheit 9/11 Reader&quot;, was released at the same time. It contains the complete screenplay, documentation of Moore&#x27;s sources, audience e-mails about the film, film reviews, and articles.

===Initial television presentations===

The two-hour film was planned to be shown as part of the three-hour &quot;The Michael Moore Pre-Election Special&quot; on iN DEMAND, but iN DEMAND backed out in mid-October. Moore later arranged for simultaneous broadcasts on November 1, 2004, at 8:00 p.m. (EST) on Dish Network, TVN, and the Cinema Now website and material prepared for &quot;The Michael Moore Pre-Election Special&quot; was incorporated into &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11: A Movement in Time&quot;, which aired that same week on The Independent Film Channel.

The movie was also shown on basic cable television in Germany and Austria on November 1, 2004, and November 2, 2004. In the UK, the film was shown on Channel 4 on January 27, 2005. In Hungary, it was shown on RTL Klub, a commercial channel, on September 10, 2005, on m1, one of the national channels, on August 13, 2006, on m2, the other national channel, on September 1, 2006. In Denmark, it was shown on Danmarks Radio (normally referred to as just DR), which is Denmark&#x27;s national broadcasting corporation, on April 11, 2006. In Norway, it was shown on NRK, the national broadcasting corporation, on August 27, 2006. The film was screened in New Zealand on September 9, 2006, on TV ONE, a channel of TVNZ. The next day, the Dutch network Nederland 3 aired the film. In Belgium, it was shown on Kanaal 2 on October 12, 2006. In Brazil, it aired on October 10, 2008, on TV Cultura, the São Paulo public broadcasting network.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; was released on October 5, 2004, by Rhino Entertainment.

==Awards==
===Palme d&#x27;Or===
In April 2004, the film was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 57th Cannes Film Festival. After its first showing in Cannes in May 2004, the film received a 15–20 minute standing ovation; Harvey Weinstein, whose Miramax Films funded the film, said, &quot;It was the longest standing ovation I&#x27;ve seen in over 25 years&quot;.

On May 22, 2004, the film was awarded the Palme d&#x27;Or. It was the first documentary to win that award since Jacques Cousteau&#x27;s and Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;The Silent World&quot; in 1956. Just as his much publicized Oscar acceptance speech, Moore&#x27;s speech in Cannes included some political statements:

I have a sneaking suspicion that what you have done here and the response from everyone at the festival, you will assure that the American people will see this film. I can&#x27;t thank you enough for that. You&#x27;ve put a huge light on this and many people want the truth and many want to put it in the closet, just walk away. There was a great Republican president who once said, if you just give the people the truth, the Republicans, the Americans will be saved. […] I dedicate this Palme d&#x27;Or to my daughter, to the children of Americans and to Iraq and to all those in the world who suffer from our actions.

Some conservatives in the United States, such as Jon Alvarez of FireHollywood, commented that such an award could be expected from the French. Moore had remarked only days earlier that: &quot;I fully expect the Fox News Channel and other right-wing media to portray this as an award from the French. […] There was only one French citizen on the jury. Four out of nine were American. […] This is not a French award, it was given by an international jury dominated by Americans.&quot; The jury was made up of four North Americans, four Europeans, and one Asian.

Responding to suggestions that the award was political, Moore said: &quot;Quentin [Tarantino] whispered in my ear, &#x27;We want you to know that it was not the politics of your film that won you this award. We are not here to give a political award. Some of us have no politics. We awarded the art of cinema, that is what won you this award and we wanted you to know that as a fellow filmmaker.&#x27;&quot; In comments to the prize-winning jury in 2005, Cannes director Gilles Jacob said that panels should make their decision based on filmmaking rather than politics. He expressed his opinion that though Moore&#x27;s talent was not in doubt, &quot;it was a question of a satirical tract that was awarded a prize more for political than cinematographic reasons, no matter what the jury said&quot;. Interviewed about the decision four years later, Tarantino responded: &quot;As time has gone on, I have put that decision under a microscope and I still think we were right. That was a movie of the moment – &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; may not play the same way now as it did then, but back then it deserved everything it got.&quot;

===People&#x27;s Choice Award===
The film won additional awards after its release, such as the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture, an unprecedented honor for a documentary.

===Golden Raspberry Awards===
Nine months after &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; received the Palme d&#x27;Or, George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, and Condoleezza Rice won the Worst Actor, Worst Supporting Actor, and Worst Screen Couple (Bush/Rice) at the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards (&quot;Razzies&quot;) because of their mishandling of the 9/11 attacks and the Iraq War. Britney Spears, who appeared in the film in a pre-recorded interview where she expressed her support for Bush, won the Golden Raspberry for Worst Supporting Actress.

==Controversies==
The film generated criticism and controversy after its release shortly before the 2004 United States presidential election. British-American journalist Christopher Hitchens contended that &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; contains distortions and untruths. This drew several rebuttals, including an eFilmCritic article and a Columbus Free Press editorial. Former Democratic mayor of New York City Ed Koch, who had endorsed President Bush for re-election, called the film propaganda &quot;for its many blatant lies&quot;.

==Moore&#x27;s expectations for the 2004 presidential election==
The film was released in June 2004, less than five months before the 2004 presidential election. Michael Moore, while not endorsing presidential candidate John Kerry, stated in interviews that he hoped &quot;to see Mr. Bush removed from the White House&quot;. He also said that he hoped his film would influence the election: &quot;This may be the first time a film has this kind of impact&quot;. However, some political analysts did not expect it to have a significant effect on the election. One Republican strategist stated that Moore &quot;communicates to that far-left sliver that would never vote for Bush&quot;, and Jack Pitney, a government professor at Claremont McKenna College, suspected that the main effect of the film would be to &quot;turn Bush-haters into bigger Bush-haters&quot;. Regardless of whether the film would change the minds of many voters, Moore stated his intention to use it as an organizing tool, and hoped that it would energize those who wanted to see Bush defeated in 2004, increasing voter turnout. Notwithstanding the film&#x27;s influence and commercial success, George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004.

Because Moore had opted to have it played on television prior to the 2004 election, the film was ruled ineligible to compete for the Best Documentary Feature in the Academy Awards.

==Lawsuit==
In February 2011, Moore sued producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein for US$2.7 million in unpaid profits from the film, stating that they used &quot;Hollywood accounting tricks&quot; to avoid paying him the money. They responded that Moore had received US$20 million for the film and that &quot;his claims are hogwash&quot;. Eventually, Bob and Harvey Weinstein reached a settlement with Moore for undisclosed amounts and terms.

==Subsequent film==
On September 6, 2018, Moore released a film entitled &quot;Fahrenheit 11/9&quot; about the 2016 United States presidential election and the subsequent presidency of Donald Trump. The title is reference to the original film, with the date 9/11 being reversed to 11/9.

<text>Alexander James Naughtie (surname pronounced ; born 9 August 1951) is a British radio presenter and journalist, known for presenting on BBC Radio 4. From 1994 to 2015, he was one of the main presenters of the &quot;Today&quot; programme. In his 21 years on &quot;Today&quot;, Naughtie had anchored every BBC Radio UK election results programme from 1997 onwards. He also worked on every US presidential election from 1988 to 2012.

==Early life and career==
James Naughtie was born to Alexander and Isabella Naughtie and brought up in Milltown of Rothiemay, near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. He was educated at Keith Grammar School, the University of Aberdeen and then Syracuse University in New York. He is a Fellow of the British-American Project, which endeavours to strengthen connections between the US and the UK.

Naughtie began his career as a journalist in 1975 at the Aberdeen &quot;Press &amp; Journal&quot;, moving to the London offices of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; in 1977. The following year he joined the paper&#x27;s Westminster staff, and became its Chief Political Correspondent. In 1981, he worked for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as the Laurence Stern fellow on its national staff. He joined &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1984, and became its Chief Political Correspondent in 1985.

==Radio presenter==

In 1985, Naughtie moved into radio presenting, hosting &quot;The Week In Westminster&quot; before moving to &quot;The World At One&quot; in 1988. He has also made several radio documentaries and series and has written three books, &quot;Playing the Palace: A Westminster Collection&quot;, &quot;The Rivals: The Intimate Story of a Political Marriage&quot;, and &quot;The Accidental American: Tony Blair and the Presidency&quot;.

Naughtie has been a presenter of the televised &quot;Proms&quot; since 1992, and has also presented opera programmes such as Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Opera News&quot;. He is also the host of Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Bookclub&quot;.

In 1994 he became one of the main presenters of Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme. Shortly before the 2005 General Election he opened a question to Labour politician Ed Balls &quot;If we win the election...&quot;, quickly correcting himself to say &quot;if you win the election&quot;. The incident led to accusations of bias towards the Labour Party and a failure to be neutral. Lord Tebbit said of the incident: &quot;How often a slip of the tongue betrays the true thoughts in the mind of the speaker. We could all see the shape of the cat in the bag, but Mr Naughtie has now let it out for all to see.&quot; He has a distinctive Scottish accent which has been named as the &quot;best voice to wake up to&quot; in a comparative survey. His practice of asking particularly long questions is sometimes noted by commentators.

Throughout June, July and August 2012, and in early September 2012, he presented &quot;The New Elizabethans&quot; on Radio Four, a programme about notable people under the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. It has dealt with various famous names, including Richard Doll, Philip Larkin, Elizabeth David, Margot Fonteyn, Peter Hall, Cicely Saunders, John Lennon and Paul McCartney and Tim Berners-Lee. The final week of the programme dealt with Tony Blair, Fred Goodwin, Rupert Murdoch, Simon Cowell and finished with the Queen herself.

On 16 July 2013, it was announced that Naughtie&#x27;s presentational role on &quot;Today&quot; would be temporarily reduced, as he was to become a presenter of &quot;Good Morning Scotland&quot; for two days a week in the run up the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. He returned to his usual role on &quot;Today&quot; in time for the 2015 general election.

In July 2015 he announced, via the BBC, that in early 2016 he would retire from regular presenting duties on the programme and would, instead, be its &#x27;Special Correspondent&#x27; with &#x27;responsibility for charting the course of the constitutional changes at the heart of the UK political debate&#x27;, as well as the BBC News&#x27;s Books Editor, contributing a book review to the Saturday morning editions of &quot;Today&quot;. &quot;After 21 years, I can turn off that 3am alarm at last,&quot; the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; quoted Naughtie as saying. He presented his last edition of &quot;Today&quot; on 16 December 2015.

In 2016–17, Naughtie earned £150,000 – £199,999 as a BBC contributor. In 2018–19, his BBC earnings were in the £170,000 – £174,999 band.

In 2024, James Naughtie made an appearance as himself on ITV&#x27;s drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office.

===Jeremy Hunt gaffe===
On 6 December 2010, Naughtie was co-presenting the &quot;Today&quot; programme, and trailing the guests who would be interviewed after the 8am news bulletin. Introducing Jeremy Hunt, the Culture Secretary, he inadvertently replaced the &quot;H&quot; at the beginning of &quot;Hunt&quot; with a &quot;C&quot;. Choking on his words, he was clearly embarrassed by the mistake, and gave a full apology once he had recovered. However, only an hour later, another BBC presenter, Andrew Marr, made the same mistake when discussing Naughtie&#x27;s error.

==Awards and positions==
Naughtie was named as journalist of the year at the 1984 Scottish Press Awards. He was voted Sony Radio Awards Radio Personality of the Year in 1991 and Voice of the Listener &amp; Viewer Award in 2001. He is a member of the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission and a United Kingdom advisory board member for the British-American Project, which exists to promote the British-American relationship.

Naughtie was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Stirling in 2001, and installed as its Chancellor on 9 October 2008, succeeding Dame Diana Rigg when her ten-year term ended.

Naughtie chaired the judges of the inaugural 2010 Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine.

In 2017 Naughtie gave the Hugh Cudlipp Lecture. In his speech he referred to the Trump presidency thus: &quot;There hasn’t been in living memory in western democracy a threat to freedom of the press of the kind we see there.&quot;

Naughtie was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March 2017.

== Personal life ==
Naughtie is married to Eleanor Updale, author of the Montmorency series of books and a former producer of &quot;The World at One&quot;. They have three children, and live in London and Edinburgh.

<doc id="600100" wikidata="Q677388" url="?curid=600100" title="Sambre–Oise Canal">
<text>The Canal de la Sambre à l&#x27;Oise () is a canal in northern France. It forms a connection between the canalised river Sambre (Meuse basin) at Landrecies and the Oise (Seine basin) at La Fère. The canal is long, and has 38 locks. The junction made at La Fère is with a branch of the Canal de Saint-Quentin, while the Canal latéral à l&#x27;Oise is joined 10.5 km further downstream at Chauny. It was used by the standard Freycinet-gauge &quot;péniches&quot;, long, and in beam, carrying up to 250 tonnes. The canal, also a popular waterway for boats heading south from the Netherlands and Belgium to the central French waterways, had to be closed in 2006 when two aqueducts were found to be in danger of failing. Funding has been put in place by the owner, Voies Navigables de France, and the local authorities, with support from the State. The canal was reopened in July 2021.

== World War I battle ==
The Sambre–Oise Canal saw one of the last Allied victories of World War I before the Armistice with Germany which came into effect at 11.00 am on 11 November 1918.

The forcing of the Sambre–Oise Canal took place on 4 November 1918. Participating in the operation were the 2nd Battalion Royal Sussex, as well as the 2nd Manchesters, to which the poet Wilfred Owen belonged. The Lancashire Fusiliers also took part in the battle. The British forces were to cross some fields surrounded by high hedges, then cross the canal at a point where there was a lockhouse. The Germans had this area defended with machine guns and rifle teams.

As the 2nd Battalion advanced on the canal, the Royal Engineers placed small footbridges across the lock. Some Royal Sussex Regiment men actually climbed up onto the lock gates, one of them firing his Lewis gun from the hip as he went. Eventually the British managed to take the lockhouse and pushed on to their final objective near the Étreux road.

Wilfred Owen, officer and poet, was killed as he crossed the Sambre–Oise Canal at the head of a raiding party: Owen&#x27;s death occurred only a week before the war ended.

<text>Stage fright or performance anxiety is the anxiety, fear, or persistent phobia that may be aroused in an individual by the requirement to perform in front of an audience, real or imagined, whether actually or potentially (for example, when performing before a camera). Performing in front of an unknown audience can cause significantly more anxiety than performing in front of familiar faces. In some cases, the person will suffer no such fright from this, while they might suffer from not knowing who they&#x27;re performing to. In some cases, stage fright may be a part of a larger pattern of social phobia (social anxiety disorder), but many people experience stage fright without any wider problems. Quite often, stage fright arises in a mere anticipation of a performance, often a long time ahead. It has numerous manifestations: stuttering, tachycardia, tremor in the hands and legs, sweaty hands, facial nerve tics, dry mouth, and dizziness.

==People and situations==
Stage fright can occur in people of all experiences and backgrounds, from those who are completely new to being in front of an audience to those who have done so for years. It is commonly recognized in the population. Stage fright may, for example, have a negative impact on the individual&#x27;s performance, such that it affects their confidence during job interviews, presentations, etc. It also affects athletes, teachers, actors, comedians, musicians, and politicians. Many people with no other problems in communication can experience stage fright, but some people with chronic stage fright also have social anxiety or social phobia which are chronic feelings of high anxiety in any social situation. Stage fright can also be seen in school situations, like stand-up projects and class speeches. 

==Effects==
When someone starts to feel the sensation of being scared or nervous they start to experience anxiety. According to a Harvard Mental Health Letter, &quot;Anxiety usually has physical symptoms that may include a racing heart, a dry mouth, a shaky voice, blushing, trembling, sweating, lightheadedness, and nausea&quot;. It triggers the body to activate its sympathetic nervous system. This process takes place when the body releases adrenaline into the blood stream causing a chain of reactions to occur. This bodily response is known as the &quot;fight or flight&quot; syndrome, a naturally occurring process in the body done to protect itself from harm. &quot;The neck muscles contract, bringing the head down and shoulders up, while the back muscles draw the spine into a curve. This, in turn, pushes the pelvis forward and pulls the genitals up, slumping the body into a classic fetal position&quot;. This is also noted to have effects on sexual performance and physiology, which can be sometimes attributed to psychological barriers.

In trying to resist this position, the body will begin to shake in places such as the legs and hands. Several other things happen besides this. Muscles in the body contract, causing them to be tense and ready to attack. Second, &quot;blood vessels in the extremities constrict&quot;. This can leave a person with the feeling of cold fingers, toes, nose, and ears. Constricted blood vessels also gives the body extra blood flow to the vital organs.

Negative emotionality indicated more than 50% of individual variations in performance anxiety in musicians, according to research on performance anxiety and the roles of personality and experience in musicians. Additionally, a discussion revealed that many years of formal education might counteract the performance anxiety linked to personality type. Given various conditions, performance anxiety reduced with time, indicating that the diary style of self-monitoring may have therapeutic benefits. 

==Treatment==
Propranolol is occasionally prescribed off-label to treat performance anxiety. As a beta blocker drug, propranolol prevents adrenaline (epinephrine) released during the &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; bodily response from attaching to the heart, lungs and other parts of the body. This reduces or eliminates the physical symptoms of performance anxiety including increased heart rate (tachycardia), rapid breathing (hyperventilation), dry mouth, trembling, shaky voice, and sweating. Propranolol is not an officially approved treatment for performance anxiety; however, past studies and patient experiences indicate the drug is effective at reducing physical symptoms. Propranolol does not help with the mental symptoms of anxiety including the emotional feeling of nervousness since the drug does not alter the neurochemistry of the brain unlike typical medications prescribed for other forms of anxiety such as antidepressants.

There are also ways to treat performance anxiety without the use of medication. Relaxing the body with deep breaths, mentally preparing oneself, and redirecting one&#x27;s attention are techniques that may help with minimizing stage fright. Although it is a common assumption that alcohol can be used to relieve anxiety, other forms of treatment prove to be much better at treating stage fright. Alcohol consumption may actually affect one&#x27;s performance and lead to lapses in memory and overall absent-mindedness.

==Notable people==

Many well-known public performers have been afflicted with stage fright and were able to overcome their problem, including Ariel Pink, Al Jolson, Lily Pons, Brian Wilson, Virginia O&#x27;Brien, Michael Gambon, Grimes, Lorde, Carly Simon, Jason Alexander, Mose Allison, Maya Angelou, David Brenner, Peter Coyote, Olympia Dukakis, Richard Lewis, Roy Orbison, Barbra Streisand, Adele, David Warner, Niall Horan, Frankie Howerd, Mike Yarwood, Ian Holm, Lady Gaga, Mariah Carey, Frankie Boyle, Peter Gabriel, Donald Fagen, John Lydon, Meg White (which was so extreme that it led to her early retirement from the music industry) and Amanda Seyfried.

In some cases, famous stars have struggled to cope with their anxiety. Hugh Grant said on starring in the 2007 film &quot;Music and Lyrics&quot; that he &quot;did the whole film full of lorazepam.&quot;

Not every performer suffers from stage fright. Ethel Merman said:

<text>Svetovit, also known as Sventovit and Svantovit amongst other variants, is the god of abundance and war, and the chief god of the Slavic tribe of the Rani, and later of all the Polabian Slavs. His organized cult was located on the island of Rügen, at Cape Arkona, where his main temple was also located. According to the descriptions of medieval chroniclers, the statue representing this god had four heads, a horn and a sword, and to the deity himself were dedicated a white horse, a saddle, a bit, a flag, and eagles. Once a year, after the harvest, a large festival was held in his honor. With the help of a horn and a horse belonging to the god, the priests carried out divinations, and at night the god himself rode a horse to fight his enemies. His name can be translated as &quot;Strong Lord&quot; or &quot;Holy Lord&quot;. In the past it was often mistakenly believed that the cult of Svetovit originated from St. Vitus. Among scholars of Slavic mythology, Svetovit is often regarded as a Polabian hypostasis of Pan-Slavic god Perun. His cult was destroyed in 1168.

== Etymology ==
In Latin records, this theonym is notated as , , , , , , and others, and in Old Icelandic as and .

Scholars agree on the reading of the Latin records; the digraphs ⟨an⟩ and ⟨en⟩ indicate a Slavic nasal vowel. In the first part of the theonym, there is an Old Polabian continuation of the Proto-Slavic adjective (with a nasal [e]). At the Old Polabian stage, at least in northern dialects, as a result of the transition of [ę] into [ą] (nasal [a]), &quot;*svętъ&quot; passed into Old Polabian dialectal &quot;*svąt-&quot;. On this basis, the Old Polabian dialectal theonym is reconstructed as &quot;*Svątevit&quot;.

In English publications god&#x27;s name is being transcribed as &quot;Svantovit&quot; (from reconstructed Old Polabian &quot;*Svątevit&quot;), &quot;Sventovit&quot; or &quot;Svetovit&quot; (from hypothetical Common Slavic &quot;*Svętovitъ&quot;).

The prevailing view in the literature is that in Proto-Slavic language meant &quot;strong, mighty&quot;, and only under the influence of Christianity did it acquire the religious meaning of &quot;holy, sacred&quot;. Such a view was held by Aleksander Brückner, Stanisław Rospond and many others.

Nowadays, however, this view is sometimes criticized and it is suggested that the meaning of &quot;holy, sacred&quot; should be considered original, Proto-Slavic. Against the influence of Christianity on the meaning of the word is contradicted primarily by its etymology: the closest cognates are Lithuanian &quot;šventas&quot; and Old Prussian &quot;swints&quot; &quot;holy, sacred&quot;, which, like PS &quot;*svętъ&quot;, are derived from the Proto-Balto-Slavic . Also closely related is the Avestan &quot;holy, sacred&quot; and Sanskrit . Also further related are the Proto-Germanic &quot;offering, sacrifice&quot;, and possibly Thracian *θιντ and Proto-Celtic &quot;*penta&quot;. The Slavic word and words related to it ultimately come from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;to celebrate&quot;. Rick Derksen reconstructs PS meaning of &quot;*svętъ&quot; as &quot;holy, sacred&quot;, Wiesław Boryś as &quot;being the object of religious reverence, worship&quot;.

In academic literature, the theonym is traditionally divided morphologically as &quot;Sveto-vit&quot; – in the second part there is supposed to be a suffix &quot;-vit&quot; (hypothetical PS &quot;*-vitъ&quot;) meaning &quot;lord, ruler, hero&quot;. The suffix is supposed to derive from &quot;warrior, hero&quot; of Germanic etymology. Some researchers, however, have rejected the connection of the suffix with &quot;*vitędzь&quot; precisely because of the Germanic origin of the word; some scholars have linked the suffix to the word &quot;to invite, to wish health&quot;, or the hypothetical verb &quot;*viti&quot;. Depending on which original meaning of the word &quot;*svętъ&quot; a given scholar takes, the theonym is translated, for example, as &quot;Strong hero&quot;, &quot;Strong ruler and lord&quot;, or &quot;Holy victor&quot;, &quot;Holy lord&quot;. Some scholars also divide the theonym as &quot;Svet-ovit&quot;, where the suffix &quot;-ovit&quot; means &quot;one who has much (of something)&quot;, &quot;characterized by (something)&quot;, and the theonym Svetovit is supposed to mean &quot;The one with much that is holy&quot;.

=== Other propositions ===
Brückner found the interpretation of the name problematic. He eventually suggested a possible connection with the hypothetical Old Polish word &quot;świętowity&quot; &quot;holy, sacred&quot;, but this interpretation was rejected by Stanisław Urbańczyk. The source material, however, confirms the existence of this type of words in Slavic languages, cf. Belarusian dialectal , Russian , Ukrainian &quot;holy, sacred&quot;, also probably Old Polish &quot;*świętowa&quot; &quot;holy, sacred&quot;, all from Slavic &quot;*svętovy&quot;. If this etymology is correct, the theonym consists of the adjective &quot;*svętovy&quot;, and the suffix &quot;*-itъ(jь)&quot;.

It has also been proposed that the meaning of the first part of the theonym should be translated, for example, as &quot;world&quot;, or &quot;light&quot; (PS &quot;*světъ&quot;), but this interpretation has been rejected by linguists. A completely incorrect reading is &quot;Sviatovid&quot; / &quot;Svietovid&quot; (Polish &quot;Światowid&quot;) &quot;God seeing the four directions of the world&quot; invented by 19th century Polish Romantics, where the suffix is supposed to be &quot;-vid&quot; &quot;to see&quot; (cf. Polish &quot;widzieć&quot; &quot;to see&quot;).

== Sources ==
Svetovit is mentioned by three sources: the main information is given by Helmold&#x27;s &quot;Chronica Slavorum&quot; and Saxo Grammaticus’s &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;; he is also mentioned by &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot;.&quot;&quot; Saxo writes most extensively about Svetovit, his description of this god is the longest known text on the beliefs of the Slavs. Excerpt from Saxo&#x27;s description:
In the city center there was a flat space, where a temple made of wood could be found, which was very elegantly crafted, worthy of veneration not only because of the magnificence of its decorations, but also because of the divinity of the image placed inside. The outside perimeter of the building gleamed with a well-maintained covering, which consisted of shapes of different things painted in a crude, primitive style. Only one entry door could be seen. However, the temple itself was closed off by two enclosures, of whose walls the outside set was covered by a red roof; the interior, on the other hand, which was supported over four pillars, shone with wall hangings instead of walls, and did not share any structure with the exterior except the roof and a few beams.
In the temple, an enormous statue, which exceeded any type of human body in size, left one stunned, with its four heads and equal number of necks, of which two seemed to look at the chest and another two at the back. And of the two located on the front as well as the two on the back, one seemed to be gazing to the right and the other to the left. They had close-shaved beards and very short hair, such that one could think that the maker had imitated the Rani’s style of doing their hair. In its right hand it held a horn decorated with several types of metal, that the priest who was an expert in their rites would fill each year with pure wine, in order to make predictions about the coming year’s harvest through the state of the liquor itself. On the left there was a bow in the arm turned towards the side. There was a sculpted tunic that fell to its feet, which, made of different types of wood, connected to the knees with a junction that was so invisible that the point of union could only be discovered after a very careful examination. The feet were at ground level, with the base hidden below the floor. Not very far away were some bridles and a chair for the statue, and many emblems of the deity. The admiration for these things was further increased by a sword of an astonishing size, whose scabbard and hilt, in addition to excellent embossed decorations, were also covered in splendid silver.
Every year, every man and woman paid a coin as a donation for the worship of this idol. The idol was also given a third of the loot and the results of plundering, as if they had been attained and taken for his protection. This same god had three hundred horses and the same number of men who served as warriors on them, and all of their earnings, obtained through arms or robbery, were given to the custody of the priest, who, using the profits from these things, would create different types of emblems and various adornmentsfor the temple, and store them in tightly closed chests, in which, in addition to abundant money, a large amount of purple cloth had accumulated, eaten by time. There could also be seen an enormous amount of public and private donations, given by the fervent offerings of those who asked the deity for favors.
This deity also had in many other places other temples, which were governed by priests of a lower rank with less power. In addition to this, it had in its possession its own private horse, which was white, and whose mane and tail hair it was considered a bad omen to cut. Only one priest was allowed to feed it and ride it, so that the use of the divine animal was not seen as less valuable by being more frequent. In the opinion of the Rani, it was believed that Svetovit—that was the name of the idol—waged war against the enemies of his cult on this horse. The most important argument supporting this was that, when the horse remained in the stable the entire night, very often he would appear in the morning covered with sweat and mud, as if, returning from exercising, he had traveled long distances.

== Svetovit and Saint Vitus ==
According to some scholars, the theonym &quot;Svetovit&quot; allegedly derives from &quot;Saint Vitus&quot;, because in Slavic languages both names sound very similar. Supporters of this theory cite Helmold, who cites the so-called &quot;Corvey legend&quot; in two versions (in the first version, he calls it an , in the second, he calls it a ) according to which the tribe of the Rani living on the island of Rügen was Christianized in the ninth century, and then abandoned Christianity and idolized Saint Vitus:
For an old relation of our ancestors tells that in times of Ludovicus II a group of monks famous for their holiness left Corvey. Hungry for the salvation of the Slavs, they insisted on suffering dangers and death in order to preach the word of God. After passing through many provinces, they arrived at those who were called Rani or Rujani and lived in the middle of the sea. That is the home of error and the seat of idolatry. After faithfully preaching the word of God, they won over the entire island, where they even founded an oratory in honor of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and in memory of Saint Vitus, who is the patron saint of Corvey. Later, the situation having changed with permission from God, the Rani moved away from the faith and, immediately driving out the priests and the Christians, changed religion for superstition. For they worshiped Saint Vitus, who we revere as a martyr and servant of Christ, as a god, setting creatures over the creator. There is no other barbarism under heaven more horrifying to Christians and priests; they only rejoiced in the name o Saint Vitus, to whom they even dedicated a temple and a statue with a very significant cult and they attribute especially to him the primacy of the gods. They ask of him prophetic answers regarding all the provinces of the Slavs, and pay sacrificial tribute annually. Not even the traders who coincidentally arrive at those places can sell or buy anything if they do not first make an offering of some precious object from their wares to the god and only then can they make their goods available to the public at the market. They honor their high priest no less than they would a king. And thus, from the time that they renounced their first faith, this superstition perseveres among the Rani until the present.

Such a view was expressed by Evelino Gasparini, or Henryk Łowmiański, but Łowmiański rejected the authenticity of the legend. Instead, he proposed a hypothesis according to which the cult of St Vitus was supposed to have spread from Prague to Brenna – from there came Drahomira, the mother of Wenceslaus I, the founder of St. Vitus&#x27; Church in Prague – where it was accepted as a deity by tolerant Slavs, and after the fall of Brenna it was supposed to have reached Rügen.

The view of the Christian origin of Svetovit is rejected by most scholars and historians. It is generally believed that this legend was invented in the 12th century to justify political claims to Rügen, already known since the mid-11th century. First of all, it is impossible that there was a Christianization of Polabia in the ninth century, let alone of Rügen in the ninth century – the first documents attesting the Christianization of Rügen appear only after the fall of the Slavic Arkona in 1168, although chroniclers of the time were eager to describe the Christianization of any pagans – the Christianization of Rügen is not mentioned by Widukind of Corvey (&quot;The Deeds of the Saxons&quot;), nor by Adam of Bremen (&quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot;). There is also an argument against such borrowing by given names of similar construction, e.g. &quot;Milovit&quot;, &quot;Radovit&quot;, &quot;Siemovit&quot;, etc. It is also unclear why the Slavs would consider an unpopular saint as a chief deity. The cult of St. Vitus itself was transferred to the Polabian region from Prague, not from Corvey.

The origin of this legend is unclear. Helmold mentions a Christianizing mission to Rügen, but makes no mention of a tribute, and the monastery makes no mention of a mission, but mentions the right to collect a tribute from Rügen. The first to mention the loss of Corvey&#x27;s right to Rügen was Abbot (d. 1071), but this is probably a later interpolation. The first reliable, albeit indirect, information about the Rügen tribute was given by the &quot;Annales Corbeienses&quot;, which describe the expedition of Duke Lotar III in 1114 against the Lutici union. The defeated Circipanians tribe admitted that they had once paid tribute in the form of fox skins or coins to St. Vitus in Corvey (where his relics had been located since 836). According to Łowmiański, this confession to paying tribute was a fabrication to appease Lotar&#x27;s wrath, since there is no evidence whatsoever that the Circipanians paid tribute before that date. According to Roman Zaroff, however, this information is also a forgery; according to Janisław Osięgłowski, the legend originated around 1110-1114 and was started by monks from Corvey who knew the Slavic language and participated in Lotar&#x27;s war expedition. When they learned about the island and the benefits that could be derived from its possession, the similarity of the words &quot;Svetovit&quot; and &quot;Saint Vitus&quot; prompted them to create the legend, claims, however, that the legend may have originated even earlier, but it was not practically applied for the first time until 1114. According to , the information about Svetovit, whose cult prevailed among the Pomeranian Slavs after the fall of Rethra, may have reached Corvey through merchants charged with donations to Svetovit, or returning prisoners of war who were kidnapped by . The person who translated the theonym was able to translate the first part of the theonym as corresponding to Latin &quot;sanctus&quot;, but was unable to translate the second part (&quot;-vit&quot;), which, with the medieval tendency toward etymologization, resulted in a legendary identification.

=== In Serbia ===
Some publications claim that Svetovit was also worshipped in Serbia (and Croatia), as evidenced by the holiday of &quot;Vidovdan&quot; (literally &quot;St. Vitus Day&quot;). This holiday, which was originally associated with St. Vitus, was forgotten over time and began to regain its popularity in 1818 after the publication of Vuk Karadžić&#x27;s &quot;Srpski rječnik&quot;, where Vidovdan is mentioned as the day of the Battle of Kosovo. Since the mid-19th century, with the rise of Serbian romanticism, this holiday among all Serbs began to symbolize the nation&#x27;s heroism in the fight against the Ottoman Empire. In 1864 the holiday returned to the church calendar, but at that time the holiday was mainly treated as a day to commemorate the battle of Kosovo and the death of Prince Lazar. For this reason, there were even claims in the scholarly literature that Vidovdan is not related to St. Vitus at all.

At the end of the 19th century, in his book Natko Nodilo attributes the cult of Svetovit to all Slavs, whose cult was to be deliberately replaced by a saint with a similar name to facilitate Christianization. Based on this book, Miodrag Popović argues for the pagan origin of the holiday. Popović is later referred to by , according to whom Vidovdan is a festival of the deity &quot;Vid&quot;, and the Kosovo myth developed alongside the cult of this deity, as well as ethnologists Dušan Bandić and Mila Bosić. Even today, the view of the cult of Svetovit among Serbs and Croats comes up for discussion; his name is often stylized as &quot;Svetovid&quot; or &quot;Vid&quot; to make the name similar to toponymy and other proper names (e.g. &quot;Vidova Gora&quot;), which are supposed to be remnants of his cult. However, the theory of the knowledge of the god Svetovit in the South Slavs cannot be accepted – it is widely believed in the scholarly community that the god Svetovit was known only to the Polabian Slavs and did not have a pan-Slavic range, and the Serbo-Croatian toponymy and proper names refer to St. Vitus ().

== Cult ==
Once a year there was a big feast in honor of the god. The day before, the priest would clean the temple, taking care not to let out any breath inside the temple, so as not to defile the presence of the god with human breath. The feast was held after the harvest. After the crowd gathered in front of the temple, animals were sacrificed and then a feast was held. The next day the crowd gathered in front of the temple and the priest checked the amount of alcohol in the horn situated in the statue of the god – if there was a lack of alcohol poured earlier, it predicted a crop failure and the priest ordered to make provisions, if there was no lack the priest predicted a good harvest for the next year. Then the priest poured out the liquor from the horn under the statue&#x27;s feet and poured fresh liquor asking for prosperity for himself and the people. The priest would finish the ritual by taking a large gulp from the horn, then refilling it again and placing it in the statue.

There is also a well-known ritual connected with a round cake seasoned with honey of a large size, which the priest would put in front of him and ask the people gathered in front of him if they could see him. When the crowd answered that they had seen it, the priest wished them that they would not be able to see him the following year, which amounted to a wish for a larger harvest.

The priest admonished the people to offer sacrifices to the god to ensure prosperity. The Slavs voluntarily gave one coin a year to Svetovit. The god was also given ⅓ of the captured armor of enemies. Neighboring kings were also said to have made gifts to the deity, such as a Danish king named , probably Sweyn III of Denmark, who offered him a precious cup. Merchants who came to trade on the island of Rügen were taxed in honour of Svetovit.

A white horse was sacrificed to Svetovit. The god himself was supposed to ride this horse at night to fight his enemies, which was proved by the fact that in the morning the horse was drowsy and dirty. The horse could only be ridden by a priest to not diminish the value of the horse, and pulling a hair from its mane or tail was considered a sin. The horse was also used for divination: the priests set up three rows of spears with the spearheads downwards, where each row of spears was crossed with each other, if the horse crossed these rows of spears with its right foot first, it meant good luck in a planned battle or attack, if with the left first, the battle was called off.

Saxo states that a flag (, cf. &quot;flag, banner, ensign, pennant&quot;) and &quot;eagles&quot; was also dedicated to the god. Saxo does not describe what exactly the &quot;eagles&quot; were, but they were located on two sides of a flag, which was located on the gate tower (towards the east) of the only entrance to the gord on Arkona, however the chronicler describes the flag in more detail: it was supposed to be of large size, and to be of a unique color. The flag was also a kind of emblem of the Rugians, and it was revered as almost divine, being sacred and belonging to a deity. According to the chronicler, the flag gave the people who possessed it the ability to plunder cities, destroy temples or houses without suffering consequences, and to execute judgments. The gate, which had a flag and eagles on it, was probably an altar of sorts. This stall was burned during the siege of Arkona.

The cult of Svetovit officially ended in June 1168 after the capture of Arkona by the Danes led by King Valdemar I and Bishop Absalon.
(Valdemar) caused the antique statue of Svetovit, which is venerated throughout the country of the Slavs, to be taken out and ordered that a rope be placed around its neck and it be dragged among the entire army in view of the Slavs and, once it was reduced to kindling, that it be tossed into the fire. And he destroyed the temple with all of its cultural apparatuses and looted the shrine’s rich treasure. And he ordered them to abandon the error into which they had been born and to accept the worship of the true God (…).

The fortress where the temple was located was on the island of Rügen, on the northeastern peninsula of Wittow, at the edge of Cape Arkona. The remains of the temple have not survived to modern times, having been swallowed up by the sea. During recent archaeological investigations (20th and 21st centuries), merchant and military objects were found, confirming the high status of the castle, as well as the remains of human sacrifices.
== Comparative mythology and interpretations ==
Horse riding is present throughout many other Slavic mythologies. Rituals involving round cake are also Pan-Slavic, and documented in Ukraine, Belarus, Herzegovina, and Bulgaria. Divination by means of a horse, or hippomancy, was also known to the Germanic peoples (according to Tacitus), the Balts, the Rus and in the Avestrian religion. Not breathing in the temple also appears in Zoroastrianism, where it was done to avoid contaminating the sacred fire. The eagles on either side of the flag are analogous to Polish seals, where a representation of a prince is placed between two eagles, and which were often also on the prince&#x27;s helmet to show power. The use of flags in a religious context by the Polabian was written about earlier by Thietmar (the flag of Svarozhits in Rethra and the flag of an unknown goddess of the Lutici).

Aleksander Gieysztor made a broad comparative mythology of Svetovit and other Indo-European deities, which led him to consider Svetovit as the chief and thunder god, the Polabian hypostasis, the &quot;mask&quot; of Perun. The four heads of Svetovit correspond to the number 4, which is associated with thunder gods: in the Balts Thursday was associated with Perkun, in the Romans Thursday was called &quot;Iovis dies&quot; (&quot;Jupiter&#x27;s day&quot;), and in the Germanic people &quot;Donnerstag&quot;/&quot;Thursday&quot; (&quot;Thor&#x27;s day&quot;). In the Balts, women were not allowed to do certain jobs on Thursdays, and marriages contracted on this day would be happy. In addition, Perkun ruled the four directions of the world and had four faces. The ritual of sacrificing alcohol to Svetovit is connected with the function of the chief god: the Vedic Indra drank a lot of soma, which gave him strength, Jupiter was sacrificed a grape, and the Germanic Odin drank the best honey mead. He regards the horn of Svetovit as a symbol of power, compares the ritual of exchanging alcohol to the ritual dedicated to Jupiter in the first century BC described by Marcus Terentius Varro, wine and the very rallying from the drink is supposed to be common to many Indo-Europeans. Round cakes are of Indo-European origin – in Rome round cakes were called &quot;summanalia&quot;, which gave rise to the nickname &quot;Jupiter Summanus&quot;, and round cakes were also used in rituals in India. The association of Svetovit with the harvest is also linked to the festival of Jupiter, &quot;epulum Iovis&quot;, held on September 13, associated with the end of the harvest. He compares divination predicting success in war by means of a horse and spear to the spears of Mars hidden in his &quot;sacrarium&quot; in Regia, the movement of which foretold peace or war. The declaration of war itself, however, belonged to Jupiter – his priest performed the ceremony of declaring war, which ended with the throwing of a spear (&quot;hasta ferrata&quot;) into enemy territory. In addition to Svetovit, the hypostasis of Perun, according to him, is also to be Yarovit and Ruyevit.

Svetovit as a hypostasis of Perun was also considered by Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov. There was a temple of Perun in Peryn. The statue of this god was in the middle of a circle, four bonfires oriented to the four directions of the world were placed on the edges of the circle, and four additional hearths were placed between them. Each main hearth could serve as an altar dedicated to a different hypostasis of Perun; the eastern hearth had more coal than the others. According to Ivanov and Toporov, this may correspond to the four heads of Svetovit and the four columns in the temple, and the eastern orientation of the temple at Arkona.

Svetovit was also recognized by Radoslav Katičić as the Polabian hypostasis of Perun. He rejected the alleged cult of &quot;Svetovid&quot;, or &quot;Vid&quot; in Serbia as unjustified, but regardless of this theory he recognizes that St. Vitus in Serbia replaced the cult of Perun, as indicated by his worship of this saint.

On the other hand, considered Svetovit to be the god of vegetation and fertility, who also possessed solar qualities – he was a sun-hero, possessing a white horse. With time he acquired warlike qualities. According to Aleksander Brückner, Svetovit, Triglav, Svarog and Dazhbog are one and the same deity worshipped under different names; Stanisław Urbańczyk believed that Svetovit replaced Svarog, Svarozhits or Perun.

=== &quot;Wolin Svetovit&quot; ===
Scholars have also linked to Svetovit a figurine, the so-called Wolin Svetovit, found on the island of Wolin, on which four faces are carved looking in four directions. The figurine is tall and was found in a house, which was located near a building interpreted as a probable temple. It is dated to the second half of the 9th century.

=== Zbruch idol ===

Some scholars see an analogy to Svetovit in an idol from Zbruch, the so-called &quot;Sviatovid&quot;. This statue was found in 1848 from the bottom of the Zbruch River, a tributary of the Dniester. It is a quadrangular limestone pillar, generally dated to the 9th-10th centuries. On the top are four faces facing the four directions of the world. Below, the four sides are covered with reliefs, which are often interpreted as specific deities, which are divided into three levels, which are sometimes interpreted as a cosmological division. However, there are disagreements about the interpretation of the statue, as well as divergent views about its dating, the very belonging to Slavic culture is also subject to criticism.

== In archeology ==

=== In Altenkirchen ===
In the church in Altenkirchen ( from Arkona), in the 13th-century wall of the sacristy, there is a granite slab measuring 1.19 × 1.68 m depicting a man with a moustache, wearing a cap and a long robe, holding a large horn. The slab is dated to the 10th-11th centuries, although it was not set into the wall until the 13th century or later; according to David Chytraeus, the stone was already there in 1586 and was called (&quot;Jaromir&#x27;s stone&quot;). In the 18th century the slab was surrounded by the black painted inscription (&quot;St. Vitus or Svantevit&quot;), nowadays almost completely erased. Chytraeus, following a local legend, believed the slab to be a representation of Svetovit – a belief that persisted in Rügen folk tradition until the 19th century.

Some scholars believed that the slab was, for example, a reused tombstone of some Christian, such as Jaromir&#x27;s brother, Tetzlav. However, this is considered unlikely nowadays: the lack of Christian symbolism, the depreciative position (lying down, head down), and the horn and mustache, which were attributes of the god, indicate that this slab depicts Svetovit.
=== In Bergen ===
In the context of Svetovit there is also a similar sized granite slab built into the outer wall of . The slab carves a figure (the so-called &quot;Monk&quot;) with folded arms on his chest in which he holds a cross. However, the cross is most likely located in place of a horn that had been carved earlier, analogous to the one in the Altenkirchen bas-relief.
== In Rodnovery ==
Nowadays there are religious associations referring to the ancient religion of the Slavs. The community that refers to the cult of Svetovit is Native Polish Church. Members of this religious association acknowledge the existence of the supreme god (henotheism), which is Svetovit. In this context, this community refers to the words of Helmold and Procopius according to which the Slavs knew the concept of the supreme god.

<text>Mana Wahine Te Ira Tangata was a small and short-lived political party in New Zealand. It was established by Alamein Kopu, a member of the New Zealand Parliament who had left her original party (the Alliance). After a short time as an independent MP, Kopu established Mana Wahine as her own party. It was officially registered on 12 June 1998.

The name &quot;Mana Wahine Te Ira Tangata&quot; is difficult to translate, but essentially refers to dignity or respect for women. Kopu claims that the party was intended to support Māori women, promoting a Māori form of feminism. Critics of Alamein Kopu, however, did not see the party as a genuine ideological organization. Rather, they saw a more cynical reason for the party&#x27;s creation – as leader of a party rather than an independent, Kopu was entitled to $80,000 in additional funding. Jim Anderton, leader of Kopu&#x27;s former party, said that the creation of Mana Wahine smelled of corruption, a sentiment which was echoed by several other politicians.

Kopu (and thus Mana Wahine) closely followed the National Party government of Jenny Shipley. National, having recently ended its coalition with the New Zealand First party, was highly interested in finding additional parliamentary support. It is sometimes claimed that National&#x27;s influence was instrumental in gaining Mana Wahine official recognition as a party, and many members of the Opposition claimed that National offered this help in return for Mana Wahine&#x27;s vote – Trevor Mallard, a Labour Party MP, openly called it a &quot;bribe&quot;.

Mana Wahine contested only two elections. The first was the Taranaki-King Country by-election in 1998. The Mana Wahine candidate, Mary Gilmore, received 7 of the 20,225 valid votes. In the 1999 general election, Mana Wahine failed to submit a party list, with Kopu saying that she missed the deadline by just minutes. The party nevertheless contested twelve electorate seats, gaining a total of 1,082 votes across the country, which would have been nowhere near enough to qualify for MMP in any event. None of the party&#x27;s candidates came anywhere close to being elected; Kopu herself contested the Waiariki electorate, and gained sixth place with 1.70% of the vote.

On 12 February 2001, Mana Wahine was removed from the list of registered political parties at its own request.

<doc id="600118" wikidata="Q1322850" url="?curid=600118" title="Status register">
<text>A status register, flag register, or condition code register (CCR) is a collection of status flag bits for a processor. Examples of such registers include FLAGS register in the x86 architecture, flags in the program status word (PSW) register in the IBM System/360 architecture through z/Architecture, and the application program status register (APSR) in the ARM Cortex-A architecture.

The status register is a hardware register that contains information about the state of the processor. Individual bits are implicitly or explicitly read and/or written by the machine code instructions executing on the processor. The status register lets an instruction take action contingent on the outcome of a previous instruction.

Typically, flags in the status register are modified as effects of arithmetic and bit manipulation operations. For example, a Z bit may be set if the result of the operation is zero and cleared if it is nonzero. Other classes of instructions may also modify the flags to indicate status. For example, a string instruction may do so to indicate whether the instruction terminated because it found a match/mismatch or because it found the end of the string. The flags are read by a subsequent conditional instruction so that the specified action (depending on the processor, a jump, call, return, or so on) occurs only if the flags indicate a specified result of the earlier instruction.

Some CPU architectures, such as the MIPS and Alpha, do not use a dedicated flag register. Others do not implicitly set and/or read flags. Such machines either do not pass &quot;implicit&quot; status information between instructions at all, or they pass it in an explicitly selected general purpose register.

A status register may often have other fields as well, such as more specialized flags, interrupt enable bits, and similar types of information. During an interrupt, the status of the thread currently executing can be preserved (and later recalled) by storing the current value of the status register along with the program counter and other active registers into the machine stack or some other reserved area of memory.

==Common flags==
This is a list of the most common CPU status register flags, implemented in almost all modern processors.

==Other flags==
On some processors, the status register also contains flags such as these:

==CPU architectures without arithmetic flags==
Status flags enable an instruction to act based on the result of a previous instruction. In pipelined processors, such as superscalar and speculative processors, this can create hazards that slow processing or require extra hardware to work around them.

Some very long instruction word processors dispense with the status flags. A single instruction both performs a test and indicates on which outcome of that test to take an action, such as Compare &quot;a&quot; with &quot;b&quot; and Jump to &quot;c&quot; if Equal. The result of the test is not saved for subsequent instructions.

Another alternative to the status register is for processor instructions to deposit status information in a general-purpose register when the program requests it. MIPS, AMD 29000, DEC Alpha, and RISC-V are examples of architectures that provide comparison instructions that store the comparison result in a general-purpose register, as a single bit or a numeric value of 0 or 1. Conditional branches act based on the value in the general-purpose register.

Usually, comparison instructions test equality or signed/unsigned magnitude. To test for other conditions, a program uses an equivalence formula. For example, MIPS has no &quot;carry bit&quot; but a program performing multiple-word addition can test whether a single-word addition of registers overflowed by testing whether the sum is lower than an operand:
 # alow = blow + clow
 addu alow, blow, clow
 # set tmp = 1 if alow &lt; clow, else 0
 sltu tmp, alow, clow
 addu ahigh, bhigh, chigh
 addu ahigh, ahigh, tmp

The codice_1 instruction sets codice_2 to 1 or 0 based on the specified comparison of its two other operands. (Here, the general-purpose register codice_2 is not used as a status register to govern a conditional jump; rather, the possible value of 1, indicating carry from the low-order addition, is added to the high-order word.)

This scheme becomes less convenient when adding three or more words, as there are two additions when computing codice_4, either of which may generate a carry, which must be detected with two codice_1 instructions. Fortunately, those two carries may be added to each other without risk of overflow, so the situation stabilizes at five instructions per word added.

<text>A leaf spring is a simple form of spring commonly used for suspension in wheeled vehicles. Originally called a &quot;laminated&quot; or &quot;carriage spring&quot;, and sometimes referred to as a semi-elliptical spring, elliptical spring, or cart spring, it is one of the oldest forms of vehicle suspension. A leaf spring is one or more narrow, arc-shaped, thin plates that are attached to the axle and chassis in a way that allows the leaf spring to flex vertically in response to irregularities in the road surface. Lateral leaf springs are the most commonly used arrangement, running the length of the vehicle and mounted perpendicular to the wheel axle, but numerous examples of transverse leaf springs exist as well.

Leaf springs can serve multiple suspension functions: location, springing, and to some extent damping as well, through interleaf friction. However, this friction is not well controlled, resulting in stiction and irregular suspension motions. For this reason, some manufacturers have used mono-leaf springs.

==Operation and basic design==
A leaf spring takes the form of a slender arc-shaped length of spring steel of a rectangular cross-section. In the most common configuration, the centre of the arc provides the location for the axle, while loops formed at either end provide for attaching to the vehicle chassis. For very heavy vehicles, a leaf spring can be made from several leaves stacked on top of each other in several layers, often with progressively shorter leaves. The longest leaf is also known as the main, master, or No. 1 leaf, with leaves numbered in descending order of length. The eyes at the end of the leaf spring are formed into the master leaf. In general, aside from the main leaf, the other leaves are tapered at each end. Sometimes auxiliary or rebound leaves are part of the main spring pack, in which case the auxiliary leaf closest to the main leaf is No. 1, the next closest is No. 2, etc. The leaves are attached to each other through the centre bolt, which is at or near the mid-point along the length of the leaf spring. To ensure that leaves remain aligned laterally, several methods can be used, including notches and grooves between leaves or external clips.

Spring steels were discovered to be most efficient at approximately 1% carbon content. Individual leaf thickness is specified by the Stubbs or Birmingham gauge, with typical thicknesses ranging between (6 to 3/8 or 00 gauge). The material and dimensions should be selected such that each leaf is capable of being hardened to have a fully martensitic structure throughout the entire section. Suitable spring steel alloys include 55Si7, 60Si7, 65Si7, 50Cr4V2, and 60Cr4V2.

===Characteristics===

The two ends of a leaf spring usually are formed into round eyes or eyelets, through which a fastener connects each end of the spring to the vehicle frame or body. Some springs terminated in a concave end, called a &quot;spoon end&quot; (seldom used now), to carry a swivelling member instead. One eye is usually fixed but allowed to pivot with the motion of the spring, whereas the other eye is fastened to a hinge mechanism that allows that end to pivot and undergo limited movement. A leaf spring can either be attached directly to the frame at both eyes or attached directly at one end, usually the front, with the other end attached through a shackle: a short swinging arm. The shackle takes up the tendency of the leaf spring to elongate when compressed and thus makes the suspension softer. The shackle provides some degree of flexibility to the leaf spring so that it does not fail when subjected to heavy loads. The axle is usually fastened to the middle of the spring by U-bolts.

The leaf spring acts as a linkage to hold the axle in position and thus separate linkages are not necessary. The result is a suspension that is simple and strong. Inter-leaf friction dampens the spring&#x27;s motion and reduces rebound, which, until shock absorbers were widely adopted, was a very significant advantage over helical springs. However, because the leaf spring is also serving to hold the axle in position, soft springs—i.e. springs with low spring constant—are not suitable. The consequent stiffness, in addition to inter-leaf friction, makes this type of suspension not particularly comfortable for the riders.

===Types===

There are a variety of leaf springs, usually employing the word &quot;elliptical&quot;. &quot;Elliptical&quot; or &quot;full elliptical&quot; leaf springs, patented in 1804 by the British inventor Obadiah Elliott, referred to two circular arcs linked at their tips. This was joined to the frame at the top centre of the upper arc, the bottom centre was joined to the &quot;live&quot; suspension components, such as a solid front axle. Additional suspension components, such as trailing arms, would usually be needed for this design, but not for &quot;semi-elliptical&quot; leaf springs as used in the Hotchkiss drive. That employed the lower arc, hence its name. 

&quot;Quarter-elliptic&quot; springs often had the thickest part of the stack of leaves stuck into the rear end of the side pieces of a short ladder frame, with the free end attached to the differential, as in the Austin Seven of the 1920s. As an example of non-elliptic leaf springs, the Ford Model T had multiple leaf springs over its differential that were curved in the shape of a yoke. As a substitute for dampers (shock absorbers), some manufacturers laid non-metallic sheets in between the metal leaves, such as wood.

Elliot&#x27;s invention revolutionized carriage design and construction, removing the need for a heavy perch and making transportation over rough roadways faster, easier, and less expensive.


A more modern implementation is the parabolic leaf spring. This design is characterized by fewer leaves whose thickness varies from centre to ends following a parabolic curve. The intention of this design is to reduce inter-leaf friction, and therefore there is only contact between the leaves at the ends and at the centre, where the axle is connected. Spacers prevent contact at other points. Aside from weight-saving, the main advantage of parabolic springs is their greater flexibility, which translates into improved ride quality, which approaches that of coil springs; the trade-off is reduced load carrying capability. They are widely used on buses for improved comfort.

A further development by the British GKN company and by Chevrolet, with the Corvette, among others, is the move to composite plastic leaf springs. Nevertheless, due to the lack of inter-leaf friction and other internal dampening effects, this type of spring requires more powerful dampers/shock absorbers.

Typically when used in automobile suspension the leaf both supports an axle and locates/partially locates the axle. This can lead to handling issues (such as &quot;axle tramp&quot;), as the flexible nature of the spring makes precise control of the unsprung mass of the axle difficult. Some suspension designs use a Watts link (or a Panhard rod) and radius arms to locate the axle and do not have this drawback. Such designs can use softer springs, resulting in a better ride. Examples include the various rear suspensions of Austin-Healey 3000s and Fiat 128s.

==History==

The earliest known leaf springs began appearing on carriages in France in the mid-17th century in the form of the two-part elbow spring (as the illustrated example from Lisbon), and later migrated to England and Germany, appearing on the carriages of the wealthy in those countries around 1750. Dr. Richard Lovell Edgeworth was awarded three gold medals by the Society of English Arts and Manufacturers in 1768 for demonstrating the superiority of sprung carriages. By 1796, William Felton&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise on Carriages&quot; showed that leaf springs were being marketed regularly by the late 18th century carriage industry.

Obadiah Elliot is credited with inventing the modern leaf spring with his 1804 patent on elliptical leaf springs, which brought him significant recognition and revenue, and engineers began studying leaf springs to develop improved designs and manufacturing processes. The mechanics and deflection of leaf springs were developed by Clark (1855), Franz Reuleaux (1861), and G.R. Henderson (1894). Improved steel rolling processes, process instruments, and spring steel alloys were developed during the latter half of the 19th century as well, making the manufacture of leaf springs more consistent and less expensive.
Leaf springs were very common on automobiles until the 1970s when automobile manufacturers shifted primarily to front-wheel drive, and more sophisticated suspension designs were developed using coil springs instead. Today leaf springs are still used in heavy commercial vehicles such as vans and trucks, SUVs, and railway carriages. For heavy vehicles, they have the advantage of spreading the load more widely over the vehicle&#x27;s chassis, whereas coil springs transfer it to a single point. Unlike coil springs, leaf springs also locate the rear axle, eliminating the need for trailing arms and a Panhard rod, thereby saving cost and weight in a simple live axle rear suspension. A further advantage of a leaf spring over a helical spring is that the end of the leaf spring may be guided along a definite path. In many late 1990s and early 2000s trucks, the leaf spring is connected to a Hinkle Beam ball joint.
The leaf spring also has seen modern applications in cars. For example, the 1963 Chevrolet Corvette Sting Ray uses a transverse leaf spring for its independent rear suspension. Similarly, 2016 Volvo XC90 has a transverse leaf spring using composite materials for its rear suspension, similar in concept to the front suspension of the 1983 Corvette. This arrangement uses a straight leaf spring that is tightly secured to the chassis at the centre; the ends of the spring are bolted to the wheel suspension, allowing the spring to work independently on each wheel. This suspension is smaller, flatter and lighter than a traditional setup.

===Heat treatment===

# Heating for hardening: Any metal, or alloy which can be hard drawn, or rolled to fairly high strength and retains sufficient ductility to form, may be used for springs, or any alloy which can be heat treated to high strength and good ductility before, or after forming may be used. For special spring properties such as good fatigue life, non-magnetic characteristics, resistance to corrosion, elevated temperatures and drift require special considerations. leaves are heated to critical temperature in an Oil-fired hardening furnace. Usually temperature maintained is between 850°C and 950°C.
# Cambering: The top leaf is known as the master leaf. The eye is provided for attaching the spring with another machine member. The amount of bend that is given to the spring from the central line, passing through the eyes, is known as camber. The camber is provided so that even at the maximum load the deflected spring should not touch the machine member to which it is attached. The camber shown in the figure is known as positive camber. The central clamp is required to hold the leaves of the spring. Machine used for this operation is Hydraulic press. Leaves are bent to required radius using a press. All the leaves are tested for required radius using cambering gauges.
# Quenching : Hot bent leaves kept in tray and quenched in oil bath to get martensite structure. Martensite is the hardest form of steel crystalline structure. Martensite is formed in carbon steels by rapid cooling that is quenching of austenite form of iron. The machine used is a conveyorised quench oil bath. The fire point of quenching oil is about 200°C and it is seen to that the oil temperature does not exceed 80°C. After quenching, the structure of the leaf spring becomes very hard and this property is not required. But this process is required to set the leaves to the correct radius after cambering. To remove hardness, tempering is done.
# Tempering: Tempering is a process of heat treating, which is used to increase the toughness. Quenched leaves are reheated to drop hardness to the required level. An electrically heated temperature furnace is used for this process. Hardness of the leaves is determined using Brinell hardness testing, a process that also relieves stresses. The temperature inside the machine is maintained between 540 and 680°C. The tempering process involves heating of leaves below their re-crystallization temperature then cooling them using water or air.

==Other uses==
===By blacksmiths===

Because leaf springs are made of relatively high quality steel, they are a favourite material for blacksmiths. In countries such as India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Philippines, Myanmar and Pakistan, where traditional blacksmiths still produce a large amount of the country&#x27;s tools, leaf springs from scrapped cars are frequently used to make knives, kukris, and other tools. They are also commonly used by amateur and hobbyist blacksmiths.

===In trampolines===

Leaf springs have also replaced traditional coil springs in some trampolines (known as soft-edge trampolines), which improves safety for users and reduces risk of concussion. The leaf springs are spaced around the frame as &#x27;legs&#x27; that branch from the base frame to suspend the jumping mat, providing flexibility and resilience.

===Clutches===
The &quot;diaphragm&quot; common in automotive clutches is a type of leaf spring.

<text>Tim Sebastian (born 13 March 1952) is an English television journalist and novelist. He is the moderator of &quot;Conflict Zone&quot; and &quot;New Arab Debates&quot; on Deutsche Welle. He previously worked for the BBC, where he hosted &quot;Doha Debates&quot; and was the first presenter of &quot;HARDtalk&quot;. Sebastian also presented Bloomberg TV&#x27;s &quot;The Outsider&quot;, an India-focused debating programme.

He won the Richard Dimbleby Award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1981, and was twice designated &quot;Royal Television Society Interviewer of the Year&quot; in the United Kingdom — once in 2000 and again in 2001.

==Early life and education==
Sebastian was born in London, England. He was educated at Westminster School, a fee-paying independent school in Central London. He holds a BA degree in Modern Languages from New College, Oxford and speaks both German and Russian.
He has a Diploma in Journalism Studies from Cardiff University, graduating in 1974.

==Journalist career==
Sebastian began his journalism career at Reuters in 1974, moving to the BBC as foreign correspondent in Warsaw in 1979. He became BBC&#x27;s Europe correspondent in 1982. At that time in 1983 in Wrocław, during Martial law in Poland, Tim Sebastian interviewed Kornel Morawiecki, the leader of the Polish anti-Soviet and anti-communist underground organization Fighting Solidarity, hiding from the Polish security service.

Between 1984 and 1985 (until his expulsion from the USSR in 1985) he was BBC&#x27;s correspondent for Moscow; he then reported from Washington between 1986 and 1989.

Sebastian has worked for &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, and has contributed to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

==Television hosting==
Notable &quot;Hard Talk&quot; interviews with world leaders included US Presidents Bill Clinton Donald Trump and Jimmy Carter, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Singapore&#x27;s first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, and the last leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev. He currently hosts &quot;Conflict Zone&quot;, a one-on-one interview show on Deutsche Welle&#x27;s international English-language channel.

=== Debate moderator ===
Sebastian is a frequent moderator of major conferences, seminars and forums across the globe.

He was the chairman of &quot;The Doha Debates&quot;, a Qatar Foundation programme that was broadcast monthly on BBC World News where it was the highest-rated weekend programme. The &quot;Debates&quot; were founded by Sebastian in 2004 and their fifth series began in September 2008.

Following the political and social unrest in Egypt and Tunisia in early 2011, Tim Sebastian founded &quot;The New Arab Debates&quot;, which have been held in Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan and were broadcast on Deutsche Welle English as well as regional television channels. The debates are also held in Arabic and hosted by Egyptian TV presenter Mai El Sherbiny.

==Awards==
In 1982, Sebastian was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Richard Dimbleby Award and was named Television Journalist of the Year by the Royal Television Society. Additionally he has twice won the Royal Television Society&#x27;s Interviewer of the Year Award for his &quot;HARDtalk&quot; interviews.

==Personal life==
His daughter is CNN journalist Clare Sebastian.

<text>RMS &quot;Scythia&quot; was a Cunard ocean liner. She sailed on her maiden voyage in 1921, and became a troop and supply ship during the Second World War. &quot;Scythia&quot; was the longest serving Cunard liner until 4 September 2005, when her record was surpassed by &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;.

==History==
After heavy losses during the First World War, Cunard Line embarked on an ambitious building programme. It decided to build &quot;intermediate&quot;, ships rather than the large liners it had previously employed. &quot;Scythia&quot; was the first ship in this new fleet, and building began in 1919. &quot;Scythia&quot; was built for the services between Liverpool and Queenstown in the British Isles to New York and Boston, in the United States. A luxury liner designed to appeal to American tourists, in the mid-1920s, she began sailing from New York to the Mediterranean.

&quot;Scythia&quot; was requisitioned at the end of 1939, left Liverpool on 24 September 1940 with 48 children bound for Boston, sponsored by readers of the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot; newspaper, part of a wider British evacuation programme under the Children&#x27;s Overseas Reception Board.

She became a troop ship on 1 November 1940, and sailed from Liverpool to the Middle East carrying the 1st King&#x27;s Dragoon Guards. She then saw service carrying evacuees from Liverpool to New York. In 1942, &quot;Scythia&quot; took part in the Allied invasion of French North Africa. On 23 November she was struck by an aerial torpedo. Her crew managed to get her to harbour at Algiers, and she suffered only five casualties out of a complement of 4,300 men.

&quot;Scythia&quot; was salvaged and taken to New York for repair in January 1943, and afterwards ferried American troops to Europe. At the end of the war she took many US troops back from Europe, many of them accompanied by their new brides, before sailing to India to bring home UK troops from the war in the East. She was also a war bride ship taking Canadian war brides and their children from Liverpool to Pier 21 in Halifax in the early part of 1946. One of her last missions as a troop ship was to bring the 1st King&#x27;s Dragoon Guards home to Liverpool, on 11 March 1948.

Later in 1948, &quot;Scythia&quot; was handed to the International Refugee Organisation to take refugees from Europe to Canada. In 1950 she became a passenger ship again, sailing from Britain to Canada and later to New York. Again in 1957 the Scythia was used to transport Hungarian refugees to Canada (departed Southampton England 19 Jan 1957), landing in Halifax, Nova Scotia at Pier 21 (Canada&#x27;s equivalent to Ellis Island in New York).

Her final route was around the North Sea. In 1958, after 37 years of service, &quot;Scythia&quot; was delivered to ship breakers Thos. W. Ward at Inverkeithing by her final Master, Geoffrey Thrippleton Marr.

<doc id="600132" wikidata="Q2154202" url="?curid=600132" title="Mary of Scotland (film)">
<text>Mary of Scotland is a 1936 American historical drama film starring Katharine Hepburn as the 16th-century ruler Mary, Queen of Scots. Directed by John Ford, it is an adaptation of the 1933 Maxwell Anderson play, with Fredric March reprising the role of Bothwell, which he also performed on stage during the run of play. The screenplay was written by Dudley Nichols. Ginger Rogers wanted to play this role and made a screen test, but RKO rejected her request to be cast in the part feeling that the role was not suitable to her image.

==Plot==
In 1561, Mary Stuart, the young widow of Francis II of France, sets sail for her native Scotland to re-establish herself as monarch. In spite of attempts by her politically insecure cousin, Queen Elizabeth of England, to prevent her from reaching Scotland, Mary lands safely with her Italian secretary, David Rizzio, and rides to Holyrood Palace near Edinburgh.

Immediately upon her arrival, Mary is confronted by her half brother, James Stewart, the Earl of Moray, who is the leader of the country&#x27;s ruling noblemen, and is questioned about her devotion to Catholicism and her refusal to marry. While the noblemen select a council for Mary, the queen is denounced publicly as a &quot;wicked&quot; Catholic by John Knox, an outspoken Protestant leader. Knox&#x27;s accusations are countered by the equally eloquent Earl of Bothwell, who in spite of his own Protestantism, pledges his loyalty to Mary and demands that he be named Scotland&#x27;s military chief.

Enraged by Mary&#x27;s success at charming her court, Elizabeth plots with Throckmorton, the new Scottish ambassador, to use Moray against her. At the same time, Rizzio encourages Mary to wed Lord Darnley, a Catholic who is the heir to the English crown after Elizabeth. Although she loves Bothwell, Mary rejects his proposal and marries the foppish Darnley. Soon after, Mary&#x27;s council tries to force her to dismiss Rizzio and, when she refuses, goads the sexually frustrated Darnley into accusing the Italian of adultery. In Mary&#x27;s bedroom, a group of Scottish lords murder Rizzio and, as a drunken Darnley watches, force the queen to sign a false confession of infidelity. Aided by Bothwell&#x27;s loyal troops, Mary and Darnley escape and thwart Moray and Elizabeth&#x27;s conspiracy.

A year after Mary gives birth to a boy, James, a still discontented Darnley threatens to disown his son as his legitimate heir. Before he is able to carry out his plan, however, Darnley is burned alive in his private refuge, which is destroyed by planted explosives. As Knox damns Bothwell as Darnley&#x27;s murderer, the earl &quot;kidnaps&quot; Mary and, in defiance of the council, secretly marries her. Twenty days later, Moray abducts baby James, and the rebel lords attack Holyrod Castle. Outnumbered by Moray&#x27;s troops, Bothwell finally agrees to leave Scotland if Mary is allowed to remain queen. In spite of his promises, Moray forces Mary to abdicate and, after imprisoning her, makes himself regent.

Eventually Mary escapes and, believing Elizabeth to support her cause, flees to England. Elizabeth, however, takes Mary prisoner and, after Bothwell dies a mad man in a Danish jail, puts her on trial for treason. Crushed by the news of Bothwell&#x27;s death, Mary eagerly accepts her inevitable condemnation and refuses to renounce the Stuart claim to the English throne, even when offered clemency by Elizabeth. Satisfied that she has enjoyed a more rewarding life than the ambitious Elizabeth, Mary faces her execution with courage.

== Cast ==
== Accuracy ==

The film does not keep close to the historical truth, portraying Mary as a wronged martyr and her third husband (James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell) as a romantic hero. While it is true that Bothwell was well known as a philanderer, his last marriage to Mary was genuine. Regarding Mary&#x27;s historical status, the false imprisonment by Elizabeth I and Anglo Protestant intrigue in Scotland did undermine her claim to the throne of Scotland and the throne of England, making her a direct threat to Elizabeth I.

At the beginning of the movie, Mary is described as the legitimate heir of Henry VIII, when in fact she was the heir of James V. Her claim to the English throne is through Henry. She had legitimate claims to both thrones and was Elizabeth&#x27;s heir. Due to Henry&#x27;s marriage annulment to Elizabeth&#x27;s mother Anne Boleyn, she was considered by many to be illegitimate. As the granddaughter of Margaret of Tudor (daughter of King Henry VII of England), Mary was considered by many to be the legitimate heir to England&#x27;s throne as well as Scotland&#x27;s.

== Reception ==

Contemporary reviews were generally positive. Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote it had a &quot;blend of excellence and mere adequacy.&quot; He wrote that the film had &quot;depth, vigor and warm humanity&quot; but had scenes which &quot;lack the vitality they possessed in the play&quot;, and considered Hepburn&#x27;s characterization of the title role rather too soft in comparison with the historical Mary. &quot;Variety&quot; praised the &quot;extra-strong cast&quot; and Ford&#x27;s &quot;sure-footed&quot; direction. Hepburn&#x27;s performance was described as &quot;not really Mary Stuart but rather Katie Hepburn. And that is all in the film&#x27;s favor because it humanizes it all and makes it that much more nearly acceptable.&quot; However, the review also found the film too long and the ending too sad, and conceding it could not end any other way without &quot;completely corrupting history.&quot; &quot;Impressive historical drama finely acted and produced with all-around distinction&quot;, reported &quot;Film Daily&quot;. &quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot; called the film &quot;a splendidly powerful drama&quot; with a &quot;sincere, intelligent and genuine&quot; performance by Hepburn. Russell Maloney reviewed the film negatively in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, writing that despite its high production values, &quot;it has little or nothing to do with Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s play. Any other historical drama of the period could have been sandwiched in between these scenes and it wouldn&#x27;t have made a bit of difference.&quot; Of Hepburn&#x27;s performance, Maloney wrote that she had &quot;the cards stacked against her from the very start, because pageantry naturally interferes with characterization.&quot;

The film is not regarded well by critics today, and in its time, it was a box office flop, causing a loss of $165,000. This was Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s second flop in a row, causing her to being labeled &quot;box office poison&quot; in the late 1930s, leading to (after a two-year screen absence) her move to MGM for her comeback in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; in 1940.

<text>Catherine Henriette de Balzac d&#x27;Entragues, Marquise de Verneuil (1579–1633) was the favourite mistress of Henry IV of France after Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrées died: her sister Marie-Charlotte de Balzac d’Entragues was also a mistress of the king. She was the daughter of Charles Balzac d&#x27;Entragues and his wife Marie Touchet, who was formerly the sole mistress of Charles IX of France.

== Royal mistress ==
Catherine Henriette de Balzac was raised at a time when women often sought to become a royal mistress to royalty, and her mother Marie had previously been a mistress to Charles IX before her birth.

Ambitious, pretty and intriguing, by her late teens she had succeeded in becoming a mistress to Henry IV. While Henry was still deeply grieving over the death of Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrées, she induced him into a written promise to marry her. This led to bitter scenes of jealousy and arguing at the court when shortly afterwards Henry married Marie de&#x27; Medici instead.

Terribly infuriated and feeling betrayed, she carried her spite so far as to be deeply compromised in a conspiracy against the king in 1608, but escaped with only a slight punishment after the plot was foiled, and in 1608 Henry took her back into favour again as one of his mistresses.

She was later involved in the Spanish intrigues which preceded the death of the King in 1610. Upon the King&#x27;s death, his wife, Marie de&#x27; Medici, was named Regent by Parliament, and immediately exiled Catherine from the royal court. She lived 23 years after Henri&#x27;s death, dying in 1633 at the age of 54.

==Children==
She had two children with the king:

<text>The SEAT Marbella (codenamed &quot;141A&quot;) was a badge-engineered Fiat Panda produced by SEAT from 1980 to 1986 (initially called the SEAT Panda), in the company&#x27;s Landaben plant in the Spanish city of Pamplona (from February 1980 until 29 April 1983, when its production ended in that plant) and also in the Zona Franca plant in Barcelona. After the break in the partnership between SEAT and Fiat, the former&#x27;s model was restyled and renamed SEAT Marbella. It received a slight restyling in 1983, with a new grille and other slight differences. 

==History==
The &quot;Marbella&quot; badge was first used for the 1983 model year, on a luxurious version of the SEAT Panda.

After a second, more thorough restyling in December 1986, it received the SEAT Marbella nameplate (codenamed &quot;28&quot; for SEAT Marbella and &quot;028A&quot; for SEAT Marbella box) and was produced by SEAT until 1998 in the company&#x27;s Zona Franca plant in Spain. The end of Marbella production in 1998 also meant the end of vehicle production in that factory. The SEAT model did not receive the mechanical and cosmetic tweaks (such as the loss of front window quarter-lights) applied to Fiat Pandas &quot;Mark II&quot;s from 1986 but was instead subjected to those from SEAT.

===Differences===

The obvious differences between a Panda and a Marbella are at the front and back of the car where head and tail lights and boot panels are different, the Marbella gaining a pronounced slope to the front panel.

The Marbella featured a boot with capacity of 272 litres, expandable to 1,088 litres when the rear seats are folded.

==Powertrain==
Mechanically, the Panda borrowed heavily from the Fiat &quot;parts bin&quot;, using engines and transmissions from the Fiat 127. The engine is an inline four-cylinder with 40 PS (29 kW) and 903 cc. This proved adequate for this light car which weighed in at about 680 kg. A kit to make a more powerful SEAT Panda Abarth version was also on offer, sold in Spain by a company called Apicsa. Shortly after introduction, a smaller-hearted version corresponding to the Italian two-cylinder model was added. Called the &quot;Panda 35&quot;, it had a smaller 843 cc version of the engine, a development of the engine originally fitted to the SEAT 850 beginning in the mid-sixties. To set it further apart from the &quot;45&quot;, a lower compression rate was chosen. Nonetheless, the smaller engine had to work that much harder to keep up, and in practice the fuel economy savings were negligible.

When the Marbella was introduced in December 1986, the smaller 843 cc version continued to be available. This low-priced version produced only at 5,600 rpm and was not available with the five-speed transmission. Top speed for the bigger engine was , while the 850 could only reach . 903 cc version of the engine later got electronic injection and reduced its size to 899 cc.

===Equipment levels===
Several differently labeled models were produced during the lifetime of the car, with few corresponding significant changes in specifications. Common models include the L, Special, XL, GL, and GLX, but there were many &quot;special editions&quot;, especially later in the life of the Marbella. In September 1989 the &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot; specials were added, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;CLX&quot;, and &quot;Jeans&quot; joined in September 1990. Various export markets also received market specific editions, such as the &quot;Le Jouet&quot; series marketed in France in the early nineties.

==Derivatives==

===Commercial version===

====SEAT Terra (24/024A, 1987–1996)====
A van version of the Marbella, called the SEAT Terra (codenamed &quot;24&quot; for SEAT Terra and &quot;024A&quot; for SEAT Terra box), was produced in Spain from 1987 to 1996 when this model was meant to be replaced from its successor, the SEAT Inca. The SEAT Terra shared the underpinnings and front of the Marbella, but the back was replaced by a large, high metal box; there was also a load rack above the cab roof. It was very popular in Spain, and was also available in export markets.

====SEAT Trans====
Before this, a van based on the Marbella&#x27;s predecessor (the SEAT Panda) was also available until 1986. In much the same configuration as the Terra, it was called the SEAT Trans and was extremely similar to the Fiat Panda&#x27;s commercial version .

===Popemobile===

In 1982 SEAT produced in its plant in Zona Franca a popemobile car, a modified version derived from the SEAT Panda, which was used during the Pope John Paul II&#x27;s 1982 visit in Spain. That specific vehicle was an &#x27;all-open-air&#x27; car with a grab handle in front so that the Pope could stand still to greet the crowds, while the vehicle was in motion. In that car the Pope entered the FC Barcelona Camp Nou soccer stadium driving through the assembled crowds celebrating mass for a congregation of over 121,000 on 17 November 1982.

===Emelba derivatives===
The Spanish company &quot;Emelba&quot; produced several derivative models from the SEAT Panda among others:
* Emelba Elba Cinco puertas (5-door), the sole 5-door version of the SEAT Panda
* Emelba Pandita 4x4
* Emelba Chato/903
* a SEAT Panda equipped with a Daihatsu diesel engine
==Concept cars==
In the 1991 Frankfurt Motorshow, SEAT presented the SEAT Marbella Playa concept car.

==Motorsport==

The SEAT Panda/Marbella has not only taken part and won podium positions in various race events, but also has formed its own &#x27;Copa Panda&#x27; one-make rally series, a rally trophy - created in 1980 by SEAT and its motorsport competition director at the time José Juan Pérez de Vargas, standing next to the brand&#x27;s &#x27;Copa Fura&#x27; circuit cup - which was addressed to young drivers aiming to come close to the motorsport experience.

The most renowned rally driver who emerged from that competition series was the Spanish Carlos Sainz, the winner in the first edition of the &#x27;Copa Panda&#x27; rally. Due to his win SEAT granted to him as an award a SEAT Panda 45 Grupo 2 rally car, under which he won his first title in the first already season of the &#x27;Copa Panda&#x27; championship in 1982.

Together with the integration of the Spanish brand to the Volkswagen group, SEAT was able to strengthen even more its involvement in motorsport activities with the formation of the SEAT Sport department in 1985. Since the SEAT Panda model had been replaced in SEAT&#x27;s range by the SEAT Marbella in 1986, it was the time that the &#x27;Copa Panda&#x27; cup should be succeeded too by the &#x27;Copa Marbella&#x27; one. The &#x27;Copa Marbella&#x27; formed part of the Spanish Rally Championship gravel schedule during eight years, to be ultimately superseded by the &#x27;Copa Ibiza&#x27; rally series. In the &#x27;Campeonato de España de Rallyes de Tierra&#x27; championship it was the SEAT Marbella Proto, a car powered by a supercharged 1.3 L 4-cylinder motor derived from the VW Polo G40 equipped with a compressor delivering a horsepower of 140 hp, under which SEAT won the 1988 championship title while in the next season Antonio Rius on the wheel of the Marbella won the two-wheel drive class. In the following years the Marbella was also driven by many drivers among which Àlex Crivillé, Juan Garriga and Jordi Tarrés, with the latter competing successfully against much more powerful cars - like the Lancia Delta - on the driver&#x27;s seat of a 620 kg lightweight Marbella.

<text>Georg August Schweinfurth (29 December 1836 – 19 September 1925) was a Baltic German botanist and ethnologist who explored East Central Africa.

==Life and explorations==
He was born at Riga, Latvia, then part of the Russian Empire. He was educated at the universities of Heidelberg, Munich and Berlin (1856–1862), where he particularly devoted himself to botany and palaeontology.

Commissioned to arrange the collections brought from Sudan by Adalbert von Barnim and Robert Hartmann, his attention was directed to that region; and in 1863, he travelled round the shores of the Red Sea, repeatedly traversed the district between that sea and the Nile, passed on to Khartoum, and returned to Europe in 1866.

In 1866, botanist A.Braun published &quot;Schweinfurthia&quot; which is a genus of flowering plants from Africa and Asia, belonging to the family Plantaginaceae and named in Georg August Schweinfurth&#x27;s honour.

His researches attracted so much attention that in 1868 the Berlin-based Alexander von Humboldt Foundation entrusted him with an important scientific mission to the interior of East Africa. Starting from Khartoum in January 1869, he went up the White Nile to Bahr-el-Ghazal, and then, with a party of ivory dealers, through the regions inhabited by the Diur (Dyoor), Dinka, Bongo and Niam-Niam; crossing the Congo-Nile watershed he entered the country of the Mangbetu (Monbuttu) and discovered the river Uele (March 19, 1870), which by its westward flow he knew was independent of the Nile. Schweinfurth formed the conclusion that it belonged to the Chad system, and it was several years before its connection with the Congo was demonstrated.

The discovery of the Uele was Schweinfurth&#x27;s greatest geographical achievement, though he did much to elucidate the hydrography of the Bahr-el-Ghazal system. Of greater importance were the very considerable additions he made to the knowledge of the inhabitants and of the flora and fauna of Central Africa. He described in detail the cannibalistic practices of the Mangbetu, and his discovery of the pygmy Aka people settled conclusively the question as to the existence of dwarf races in tropical Africa. Unfortunately, a December 1870 fire in his camp destroyed nearly all that he had collected. He returned to Khartoum in July 1871 and published an account of the expedition, under the title of &quot;Im Herzen von Afrika&quot; (Leipzig, 1874; English edition, The Heart of Africa, 1873, new ed. 1878).

In 1873-1874 he accompanied Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs in his expedition into the Libyan Desert. Settling at Cairo in 1875, he founded a geographical society, under the auspices of the Khedive Ismail, and devoted himself almost exclusively to African studies, historical and ethnographical. In 1876, he travelled into the Arabian Desert with Paul Güssfeldt, and continued his explorations therein at intervals until 1888, and during the same period made geological and botanical investigations in the Fayum, in the valley of the Nile. In 1889 he returned to Berlin; but he visited the Italian colony of Eritrea in 1891, 1892 and 1894. Schweinfurth died in Berlin.

The accounts of all his travels and researches have appeared either in book or pamphlet form or in periodicals, such as &quot;Petermanns Mitteilungen&quot;, the &quot;Zeitschrift für Erdkunde&quot;. Among his works may be mentioned &quot;Artes Africanae: Illustrations and Descriptions of Productions of the Industrial Arts of Central African Tribes&quot; (1875).

==Scientific Legacy==
*The eastern chimpanzee &quot;Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii&quot; is named after him. Botanical specimens collected by Schweinfurth are cared for at multiple institutions, including the Kew Herbarium, Plantentuin Meise, the Swedish Museum of Natural History, and the National Herbarium of Victoria, Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria.

<text>Vincent &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Coll (born Uinseann Ó Colla, July 20, 1908 – February 8, 1932) was an Irish-American mob hitman in the 1920s and early 1930s in New York City. Coll gained notoriety for the alleged accidental killing of a young child during a mob kidnap attempt.

== Early years ==
Coll was born in Gweedore, an Irish-speaking district, in County Donegal in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. He was related to the notorious Curran family, and his family emigrated to the U.S. the following year as steerage passengers on board the S/S &quot;Columbia&quot;, sailing from port of Derry to the port of New York, April 3 to 12, 1909. Coll was a distant relative of the former Northern Ireland Assemblywoman Bríd Rodgers.

At age 12, Coll was first sent to a reform school. After being expelled from multiple Catholic reform schools, he joined The Gophers street gang. Run-ins with the law were almost inevitable. Vincent soon developed a reputation for being a wild child of the streets. At age 16, he was arrested for carrying a gun, and by the age of 23 he had been arrested a dozen times. In the late 1920s, he started working as an armed guard for the illegal beer delivery trucks of Dutch Schultz&#x27;s mob.

== Mob assassin and kidnapper ==
Coll&#x27;s ruthlessness made him a valued enforcer to Schultz at first. As Schultz&#x27;s criminal empire grew in power during the 1920s, he employed Coll as an assassin. At age 19 Coll was charged with the murder of Anthony Borello, the owner of a speakeasy, and Mary Smith, a dance hall hostess. Coll allegedly murdered Borello because he refused to sell Schultz&#x27;s bootleg alcohol. The charges were eventually dismissed, and many suspect this to have been due to Schultz&#x27;s influence. Schultz was not happy about Coll&#x27;s actions. In 1929, without Schultz&#x27;s permission, Coll robbed a dairy in the Bronx of $17,000. He and his gang posed as armed guards to gain access to the cashier&#x27;s room. Schultz later confronted Coll about the robbery, but rather than being apologetic, Coll demanded to be an equal partner; Schultz declined.

By January 1930, Coll had formed his own gang and was engaged in a shooting war with Schultz. One of the earliest victims was Peter Coll, Vincent&#x27;s older brother, who was shot dead on May 30, 1931, while driving down a Harlem street. Coll subsequently went into a rage of grief and vengeance. Over the next three weeks he gunned down four of Schultz&#x27;s men. In all, around 20 men were killed in the bloodletting; the exact figure is hard to pin down; New York was also in the midst of the vicious Castellammarese War at the same time. It was mayhem on the streets of Manhattan, and the police often had difficulty in deciding which corpse belonged to which war.

On June 2, Coll and his gang broke into a garage owned by Schultz and destroyed 120 vending machines and 10 trucks. As the war continued, Vincent Coll and his gang killed approximately 20 of Schultz&#x27;s men. To finance his new gang, Coll kidnapped rival gangsters and held them for ransom. He knew that the victims would not report the kidnappings to police; they would have a hard time explaining to the Bureau of Internal Revenue why the ransom cash had not been reported as income. One of Coll&#x27;s best-known victims was gambler George &quot;Big Frenchy&quot; DeMange, a close associate of Owney Madden, boss of the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen Irish Mob. According to one account, Coll telephoned DeMange and asked to meet with him. When DeMange arrived at the meeting place, Coll kidnapped him at gunpoint. He released DeMange 18 hours later after receiving a ransom payment.

== Alleged child killing ==
On July 28, 1931, Coll allegedly participated in a kidnapping attempt that resulted in the shooting death of a child. Coll&#x27;s target was bootlegger Joseph Rao, a Schultz underling who was lounging in front of a social club. Several children were playing outside an apartment house. A large touring car pulled up to the curb, and several men pointed shotguns and submachine guns towards Rao and started shooting. Rao threw himself to the sidewalk, and four young children were wounded in the attack. One of them, five-year-old Michael Vengalli, later died at Beth David Hospital. After the Vengalli killing, New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker dubbed Coll a &quot;mad dog&quot;.

On October 4, 1931, after an extensive manhunt, New York police arrested Coll at a hotel in the Bronx. He had dyed his hair black and grown a mustache and was wearing horn-rimmed glasses. He surrendered peacefully. During a police lineup, a defiant Coll said that he had been in Albany, New York, for the past several months and refused to answer any other questions without an attorney present. On October 5, a grand jury in New York City indicted Coll for the Vengalli murder.

The Coll trial began in December 1931. He retained famed defense lawyer Samuel Leibowitz. Coll claimed that he was miles away from the shooting scene and was being framed by his enemies. He added that he would love to tear the throat out of the person who killed Vengalli. The prosecution case soon fell apart. Their sole witness to the shooting, George Brecht, admitted on the witness stand to having a criminal and mental health record, and to making similar testimony in a previous murder case in St Louis, Missouri. At the end of December, the judge issued a directed verdict of not guilty for Coll.

Immediately after the Vengalli verdict, a New York City police inspector told Coll that the police would arrest him whenever he was spotted in New York City. He was soon rejailed for carrying a gun. When the inspector referred to Coll as a baby killer, Coll hotly replied, &quot;I&#x27;m no baby killer&quot;. Soon after his acquittal, Coll married Lottie Kreisberger, a fashion designer in New York.

== Failed hit ==
In September 1931, between the killing of young Vengalli and his acquittal for that death, Coll was hired by Salvatore Maranzano, who had recently declared himself &quot;capo di tutti i capi&quot;, to murder Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, the new acting boss of the Mafia family of the same name. Tommy Lucchese alerted Luciano that he was marked for death. Months earlier, Luciano had ended the Castellammarese War by ordering the assassination of his own boss, Joseph Masseria, which left Maranzano as the most powerful boss in the Five Families. Maranzano soon decided, however, that Luciano was a threat. On September 10, Maranzano summoned Luciano, Vito Genovese and Frank Costello to his office at the 230 Park Avenue in Manhattan. Certain that Maranzano planned to murder them, Luciano decided to act first. He sent four Jewish hitmen whose faces were unknown to Maranzano and his enforcers. They had been secured with the aid of Luciano&#x27;s close associates Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel. Disguised as government agents, two of the gangsters disarmed Maranzano&#x27;s bodyguards. The other two, aided by Lucchese, who went along to point Maranzano out, stabbed the Sicilian boss multiple times and then finished him off by shooting him.

According to the 1963 testimony of government witness Joseph Valachi, Maranzano had paid Coll $25,000 for all three murders in advance, but when Coll arrived at Maranzano&#x27;s office that same day intending to kill Luciano, Genovese, and Costello, he found Lucchese and the four Jewish hitmen fleeing the scene. After learning from them that Maranzano was dead, Coll left the building.

== Gangland death ==
Both Dutch Schultz and Owney Madden had put a $50,000 bounty on Vincent Coll&#x27;s head. At one point, Schultz had actually walked into a Bronx police station and offered &quot;a house in Westchester&quot; to whoever killed Coll.

On February 1, 1932, four or five gunmen invaded a Bronx apartment which Coll was rumored to frequent and opened fire with pistols and submachine guns. Three people (Coll gangsters Patsy Del Greco and Fiorio Basile and bystander Emily Tanzillo) were killed. Three others were wounded. Coll himself did not show up until 30 minutes after the shooting.

A week after the Bronx shootings, at 12:30 am on February 8, Coll was using a phone booth at a drug store at Eighth Avenue and 23rd Street in Manhattan. He was reportedly talking to Madden, demanding $50,000 from the gangster under the threat of kidnapping his brother-in-law. Madden kept Coll on the line while it was traced. Three men in a dark limousine soon arrived at the drug store. While one waited in the car, two others stepped out. One man waited outside while the other walked inside the store. The gunman told the cashier, &quot;Keep cool, now&quot;, drew a Thompson submachine gun from under his overcoat and opened fire on Coll in the glass phone booth. Coll died instantly. The killers took off in their car. They were chased unsuccessfully up Eighth Avenue by a foot patrolman who had heard the gunshots and commandeered a passing taxi, but the car got away.
A total of 15 bullets were removed from Coll&#x27;s body at the morgue; more may have passed through him. Coll was buried next to his brother Peter at Saint Raymond&#x27;s Cemetery in the Bronx. Dutch Schultz sent a floral wreath bearing a banner with the message &quot;From the boys&quot;.

== Aftermath ==
Coll&#x27;s killers were never identified. Dutch Schultz attorney Dixie Davis later claimed that gangster Bo Weinberg was the getaway driver of the limousine. Another suspect was one of Coll&#x27;s own men, Edward Popke aka Fats McCarthy. The submachine gun that killed Coll was found a year later in the possession of a Hell&#x27;s Kitchen gunman named &quot;Tough&quot; Tommy Protheroe, who used it during a 1933 saloon killing. On May 16, 1935, Protheroe and his girlfriend Elizabeth Connors were shot and killed by unknown triggermen in Queens.

Dutch Schultz continued to operate his rackets for only a few more years. On October 23, 1935, Schultz was killed at the Palace Chophouse in Newark, New Jersey. He was supposedly murdered on orders from Luciano and the new National Crime Syndicate.

Coll&#x27;s widow, Lottie, was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon and sentenced to six months. She refused to leave prison following her parole because she feared the people who had killed her husband would also murder her.

In 1935 Owney Madden, still under police scrutiny for the Coll killing, moved to Arkansas, where he died in 1965.

<text>Louise Elizabeth Redknapp (née Nurding; born 4 November 1974), professionally known as Louise, is an English singer, dancer and media personality. She was a member of Eternal, an R&amp;B girl group which debuted in 1993 with their quadruple-platinum studio album &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot;. In 1995, she departed from the group for a solo career. Aside from music, Redknapp has presented several television shows and was a judge on the UK version of &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;. She was married to the English former footballer Jamie Redknapp. In 2016, Redknapp reached the final in the fourteenth series of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. Redknapp&#x27;s memoir entitled &quot;You&#x27;ve Got This: And Other Things I Wish I Had Known&quot; was released in 2021.

Redknapp has released four studio albums: &quot;Naked&quot; (1996), &quot;Woman in Me&quot; (1997), &quot;Elbow Beach&quot; (2000) and, following a 17-year hiatus from recording, &quot;Heavy Love&quot; (2020). Redknapp&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was released on 2 June 2023 and contains reimagined versions of her past singles plus five new songs. Her fifth studio album, &quot;Confessions&quot;, is due for release in May 2025; a preceding single, &quot;Confession&quot;, was released in February 2025. As of 2025, Redknapp has sold over 5 million records in the UK and 15 million records worldwide, as a solo artist.

==Early life and education==
Redknapp was born Louise Elizabeth Nurding in Lewisham, London. Her father was a builder and her mother worked at Gatwick Airport. Redknapp and her two younger brothers grew up in Eltham, London, and Oxted, Surrey. She describes herself as having come from a single-parent family with her mother.

At the age of 11, Redknapp won a scholarship to the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London, where she met her future Eternal colleague Kéllé Bryan on her first day.

==Career==
===1989–1995: Career beginnings and Eternal===
While out clubbing at the age of 15, Redknapp met the music manager Oliver Smallman of First Avenue Management, who was forming an all-girl group. She subsequently introduced Denis to Kéllé Bryan. Kéllé and Redknapp, together with sisters Easther and Vernie Bennett, formed the band Eternal in 1992. The group performed R&amp;B, and recorded a number of hits during the 1990s. Eternal&#x27;s debut single &quot;Stay&quot; entered the UK charts at number sixteen and climbed to number four. Redknapp left the group in 1995 to pursue a solo career, amid unsubstantiated rumours that she was forced to leave because a radio station in the United States dedicated to black music would not promote the racially mixed group. Redknapp says that she left because she was miserable and homesick.

===1995–1997: &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Woman in Me&quot;===
In late 1995, Redknapp signed a record deal with First Avenue management and EMI Records. Now professionally known simply as &quot;Louise&quot;, her debut solo single was the orchestral ballad &quot;Light of My Life&quot; (which reached number eight on the UK charts). Her second solo release, &quot;In Walked Love&quot; (previously a hit from the self-titled 1992 album by the dance/pop group Exposé), fared less well and missed the UK top ten. However, Redknapp&#x27;s third single, &quot;Naked&quot;, turned things around and became her biggest hit to date, peaking at number five in the UK. Redknapp&#x27;s debut solo album, also entitled &quot;Naked&quot;, was subsequently released in 1996 on the back of the single&#x27;s success. The album received lukewarm reviews, but nevertheless peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart. It was later certified Platinum by the BPI for over 400,000 copies sold in the UK alone and over a million copies worldwide. Two further singles were released: &quot;Undivided Love&quot; (UK No. 5) and &quot;One Kiss from Heaven&quot; (UK No. 9).

In 1997, Redknapp returned with the single &quot;Arms Around the World&quot;, which reached number four in the UK. Her second solo album, &quot;Woman in Me&quot;, peaked at number five in the UK and went on to gain platinum status in the UK and sold over a million units worldwide. The album also made an impact across Europe, charting in a number of countries. To support and celebrate the success of the album, Redknapp embarked on a UK-wide &#x27;sell-out&#x27; arena tour of over twenty dates, including Wembley Arena. &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Round Again&quot; (a cover of a song by the Average White Band) was the second single released from the album, which reached number ten. She was voted &quot;Sexiest Woman in the World&quot; by the readers of &quot;SKY Magazine&quot; in 1997.

===1998–2001: &quot;Elbow Beach&quot; and &quot;Changing Faces&quot;===
At the start of 1998, Redknapp&#x27;s career was at a high point: her second album had gone platinum, she was on the cover of magazines such as &quot;Smash Hits&quot; and &quot;GQ&quot;, and she had been voted Sexiest Woman in the World by the readers of &quot;FHM&quot; magazine.

In 1998, Redknapp focused on making what she described as her &quot;most personal album to date&quot;, &quot;Elbow Beach&quot;, released in 2000. Redknapp was more involved in the process of this album than her previous two, co-writing all 12 tracks and co-producing most of them.

The lead single from &quot;Elbow Beach&quot;, the R&amp;B-styled &quot;2 Faced&quot; went straight into the charts at number three, and became Redknapp&#x27;s highest-charting single. Despite initial hype and critical praise, total sales for &quot;Elbow Beach&quot; were weaker than the previous two productions, and the album peaked at number twelve. 

After &quot;Elbow Beach&quot; was released, Redknapp had one album left on her five-album deal with EMI (including Eternal&#x27;s &quot;Always and Forever&quot;). In 2001, the label decided to release a greatest hits compilation, incorporating all of her top ten hit singles (including those she had performed with Eternal), called &quot;Changing Faces – The Best of Louise&quot;. The collection featured three new tracks, including a cover of Five Star&#x27;s 1987 hit &quot;The Slightest Touch&quot;. The album peaked at number nine in the UK, and she embarked on the second solo tour of her career.

EMI later released a second greatest hits album entitled &quot;Finest Moments&quot;, with a slightly different track listing.

===2002–2016: &quot;Lil&#x27; Lou&quot; and Music hiatus===
In 2002, Redknapp signed with Positive Records (a division of Universal Music) to record her fourth solo album. The album, titled &quot;Lil&#x27; Lou&quot; was due for release in 2004 alongside the double A-side &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Kiss&quot;/&quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, which peaked at number five and raised money for Tickled Pink/Breast Cancer Care. Redknapp has submitted &quot;about 10 or 12 tracks&quot; for the album to the label. However, due to the singer becoming pregnant with her son Charley, the album was never released. The album would also have included Redknapp&#x27;s first duet with boy band 3rd Wish on the track &quot;Don&#x27;t Ever Change&quot;. 

Later, on 15 September 2023, Louise released the &quot;Lil&#x27; Lou&quot; extended play, which featured five previously-unreleased songs originally recorded for the unreleased album. The EP debuted and peaked at number 73 on the UK Albums Downloads Chart one week later. 

In the July 2004 edition of &quot;FHM&quot; magazine, Redknapp was named the &quot;Sexiest Woman of the Decade&quot;.

===2017–2024: &quot;Heavy Love&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===
In August 2017, Redknapp posted a picture of herself in the recording studio on her Instagram account, showing that she had been working on new music. On 13 September 2017, Redknapp revealed she would be returning to the music industry by announcing her first live show in more than 15 years at Under The Bridge in London on 22 December 2017. Titled &#x27;Intimate &amp; Live&#x27;, the show had enough demand for tickets selling out in under 5 minutes, leading promoters and Redknapp to announce additional dates for January 2018 in Manchester, Glasgow, and Birmingham. On 1 February 2018, Warner/Chappell UK confirmed Redknapp had signed a deal with them to release new material later in the year. In February 2019, Redknapp announced she had signed a global record deal with ADA / Warner Music. On 25 March 2019, Redknapp announced that her fourth solo album &quot;Heavy Love&quot; would be released on 18 October 2019. The lead single, &quot;Stretch&quot;, was released on 26 March 2019 to critical acclaim. She then released follow-up singles &quot;Lead Me On&quot;, &quot;Small Talk&quot;, &quot;Breaking Back Together&quot;, &quot;Not the Same&quot; and &quot;Hurt&quot; as a bonus single after announcing &quot;Heavy Love&quot; was to be pushed back to a 2020 release.

On 10 November 2022, Redknapp released the single &quot;Super Magic&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Fault&quot; magazine, Redknapp shared, &quot;I wanted to make music I loved rather than just ticking a box for what worked in the industry. I think I’ve forever had to fight to prove myself [...] I’m still fighting to prove myself. I feel that the hardest hurdle is to keep on knocking down those doors to prove myself.&quot; &quot;Super Magic&quot; is Redknapp&#x27;s first release under BMG. It debuted at number 89 on the UK Official Singles Downloads Chart Top 100 on 18 November 2022.

On 12 January 2023, Redknapp announced that her &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection, spanning thirty years in the music industry, would be released in June 2023. The compilation will contain five new songs, including a cover of Janet Jackson&#x27;s 1997 single &quot;Together Again&quot;. In the same month, Louise revealed she had been cast as Teen Angel in the summer 2023 production of &quot;Grease&quot;. Louise released reimagined versions of her singles &quot;Just A Step From Heaven&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot; as promotional singles from her &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation. Her single &quot;High Hopes&quot; was released on 27 April 2023. On 1 June 2023, Louise performed in concert at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire; Michelle Gayle appeared as a guest and former Eternal bandmate Kéllé Bryan made a surprise appearance on stage to perform 1994 single &quot;Crazy&quot;. Louise&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was released on 2 June 2023.

On 25 September 2023, it was reported that Redknapp and her former bandmate Kéllé Bryan had pulled out of a purported Eternal reunion tour scheduled for 2024 after a row occurred because their former bandmates, sisters Easther and Vernie Bennett, purportedly refused to play at LGBTQ and Pride events over objections that the trans community had “hijacked” Pride.

===2025-present: &quot;Confessions&quot;===
On 13 February 2025, Louise released the single &quot;Confession&quot;, and announced her fifth studio album, &quot;Confessions&quot;, would be released in May 2025.

==Television career ==
On television, Redknapp has presented editions of &quot;SMTV Live&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Soccer Aid: Extra Time&quot;, &quot;This Morning&quot;, three series of the revived &quot;The Clothes Show&quot; for UKTV Style, and in March 2007 the controversial documentary &quot;The Truth About Size Zero&quot; for ITV.

==Other endeavours==
In 2003, Redknapp published a magazine called &quot;Icon&quot;, aimed solely at professional sports stars and celebrities with then-husband Jamie Redknapp and former footballer Tim Sherwood. They later sold the magazine to another publisher.

A family court in central London granted a decree nisi for divorce after 19 years of marriage on 29 December 2017.

===Charity work===
In 2003, Redknapp&#x27;s double A-side single &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Kiss/Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, was released to raise money for Breast Cancer Care&#x27;s &quot;Tickled Pink&quot; campaign. She also participated in a celebrity edition of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; in 2008, to raise money for charity.

<text>Mary Somerville ( ; , formerly Greig; 26 December 1780 – 29 November 1872) was a Scottish scientist, writer, and polymath. She studied mathematics and astronomy, and in 1835 she and Caroline Herschel were elected as the first female Honorary Members of the Royal Astronomical Society.

When John Stuart Mill organized a massive petition to Parliament to give women the right to vote, he made sure that the first signature on the petition would be Somerville&#x27;s.

When she died in 1872, &quot;The Morning Post&quot; declared in her obituary that &quot;Whatever difficulty we might experience in the middle of the nineteenth century in choosing a king of science, there could be no question whatever as to the queen of science&quot;. One of the earliest uses of the word scientist was in a review by William Whewell of Somerville&#x27;s second book &quot;On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences&quot;. However, the word was not used to describe Somerville herself; she was known and celebrated as a mathematician or a philosopher.

Somerville College, a college of the University of Oxford, is named after her, reflecting the virtues of liberalism and academic success that the college wished to embody. She is featured on the front of the Royal Bank of Scotland polymer £10 note launched in 2017 along with a quotation from her work &quot;On the Connection of the Physical Sciences&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Somerville, the daughter of Vice-Admiral Sir William George Fairfax, was related to several prominent Scottish houses through her mother, Margaret Charters. She was born at the manse of Jedburgh, the home of her maternal aunt and the Rev. Dr. Thomas Somerville (1741–1830) (author of &quot;My Own Life and Times&quot;). Her childhood home was at Burntisland, Fife, where her mother was from.

Somerville was the second of four surviving children (three of her siblings had died in infancy). She was particularly close to her oldest brother Sam. The family lived in genteel poverty as her father&#x27;s naval pay remained meagre, despite his rise through the ranks. Her mother supplemented the household&#x27;s income by growing vegetables, maintaining an orchard and keeping cows for milk. Her mother taught her to read the Bible and Calvinist catechisms. When her household chores were done Mary was free to roam among the birds and flowers in the garden.

In her autobiography Somerville recollects that on her father&#x27;s return from sea he said to his wife, &quot;This kind of life will never do, Mary must at least know how to write and keep accounts&quot;. Ten-year-old Mary was then sent to an expensive boarding school in Musselburgh, where she learned the first principles of writing, rudimentary French and English grammar. Upon returning home, she:

During bad weather Somerville occupied herself with reading the books in her father&#x27;s library, including Shakespeare, as well as with &quot;domestic duties.&quot; Such duties &quot;occupied a great part of my time; besides, I had to shew my sampler, working the alphabet from A to Z, as well as the ten numbers, on canvas&quot;. Her aunt Janet came to live with the family and reportedly said to her mother &quot;I wonder you let Mary waste her time in reading, she never shews [sews] more than if she were a man.&quot; Somerville was then sent to the village school to learn plain needlework, where she found herself annoyed that her &quot;turn for reading was so much disapproved of, and thought it unjust that women should have been given a desire for knowledge if it were wrong to acquire it.&quot; Several times each week the village school master came to teach Mary at home. In her &quot;Personal Recollections&quot; Somerville notes that the boys learned Latin at the village school, while &quot;it was thought sufficient for the girls to be able to read the Bible; very few even learnt writing.&quot;
At age 13 her mother sent her to writing school in Edinburgh, where she improved her writing skills and studied arithmetic. Back in Burntisland she taught herself sufficient Latin to read the books in the home library. While visiting her aunt in Jedburgh she met her uncle, Dr. Thomas Somerville. She gathered her courage to tell him that she had been learning Latin. Dr. Somerville assured her that in earlier times many women had become elegant scholars. He then proceeded to enable her to improve her Latin by reading Virgil with her. While staying with another uncle, William Charters, in Edinburgh, Somerville was sent to a dancing school, where she learned manners and how to curtsey. She also accompanied her uncle and aunt on their visits to the Lyell family in Kinnordy; Charles Lyell later became a celebrated geologist and Somerville&#x27;s friend.

Somerville&#x27;s father was a Tory, but she was a Liberal, made so by the &quot;unjust and exaggerated abuse of the Liberal party. From my earliest years my mind revolved against oppression and tyranny, and I resented the injustice of the world in denying all those privileges of education to my sex which were so lavishly bestowed on men.&quot; At the time, slaves still worked to harvest sugar in the West Indies and in protest Somerville and her oldest brother Sam would refuse to take sugar in their tea.
At Burntisland, where she stayed the summer with her uncle and aunt, Somerville had access to elementary books on algebra and geometry. She spent the summer learning to play the piano. In addition to the piano she learned Greek so she could read Xenophon and Herodotus in their original versions. On her return to Edinburgh she was allowed to attend the academy of painter Alexander Nasmyth, which had opened for ladies. When Nasmyth advised another student to study Euclid&#x27;s Elements to gain a foundation in perspective, astronomy and mechanical science, Somerville spotted an opportunity. She thought the book would help her understand &quot;Navigations&quot; by John Robertson.

She continued in the traditional role of a daughter in a well-connected family, attending social events and maintaining a sweet and polite manner, which led to her nickname as &quot;the Rose of Jedburgh&quot; among Edinburgh socialites. Meanwhile, a young tutor came to stay with the family in Burntisland to educate her younger brother Henry. The tutor, Mr. Craw, was a Greek and Latin scholar, and Somerville asked him to purchase elementary books on algebra and geometry for her. He presented Somerville with Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; and &quot;Algebra&quot; by John Bonnycastle. Somerville would rise early to play the piano, painted during the day, and stayed up late to study Euclid and algebra. When Lord Balmuto, a family friend, invited her to visit his family, Somerville saw her first laboratory. She also spent some time with the Oswalds family in Dunnikeir, whose daughter, a bold horsewoman who impressed Somerville, became a Greek and Latin scholar and married Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin.

Winters were usually spent in Edinburgh. In the winter of 1796 Somerville made her first appearance at a ball under the care of Lady Burchan. Her first dancing partner was the Earl of Minto.

In the autumn of 1797 her father was caught up in a mutiny while serving as flag-captain under Admiral Duncan on . Despite the mutiny, the Battle of Camperdown was won by the British. Her father was knighted and made Colonel of Marines. Her eldest brother died at the age of 21 in Calcutta while serving in the East India Company&#x27;s military service. The family had hoped he would make a sufficient fortune in a few years to enable him to return home.

==Marriage and studies==
In 1804 Somerville met her first husband, Lieutenant Samuel Greig. Her distant cousin, a son of Admiral Samuel Greig, he was commissioner of the Russian navy and Russian consul for Britain. They married and had two children, one of whom, Woronzow Greig, would become a barrister and scientist. They lived in London, but it was not a happy time for Somerville. Her husband did not think much of women&#x27;s intellectual capacity. Indeed, Greig &quot;possessed in full the prejudice against learned women which was common at that time.&quot; Instead, Somerville took lessons in French, which was considered more appropriate. When her husband died in 1807 she was still nursing their youngest child and she returned to Scotland.

Her inheritance from Greig gave her the freedom to pursue intellectual interests. By that time she had studied plane and spherical trigonometry, conic sections and James Ferguson&#x27;s &quot;Astronomy&quot;. Somerville also read Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot;. John Playfair, professor of natural philosophy at University of Edinburgh, encouraged her studies and through him she began a correspondence with William Wallace, with whom she discussed mathematical problems.

Somerville began solving mathematical problems posed in the mathematical journal of the Military College at Marlow and eventually made a name for herself after solving a diophantine problem, for which she was awarded a silver medal in 1811. Somerville published five solutions in Volumes 3 and 4 of the &quot;Mathematical Repository&quot; under the pseudonym &#x27;A Lady&#x27;. Two of her solutions demonstrated her early adoption of differential calculus—her contribution to the circulation and visibility of calculus in early 19th-century Britain.

Wallace suggested that she study the writings of French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, which summarised the theory of gravity and collected the mathematical results established in the 50 years since &quot;Principia&quot; had been published. Somerville said that studying Laplace&#x27;s work gave her the confidence to persevere in her mathematical studies. She extended her studies to astronomy, chemistry, geography, microscopy, electricity and magnetism. At the age of 33 she bought herself a library of scientific books. These included Louis-Benjamin Francœur&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Mechanics&quot;, Sylvestre François Lacroix&#x27; &quot;Algebra&quot; and &quot;Calculus Treatise&quot;, Jean-Baptiste Biot&#x27;s &quot;Analytical Geometry and Astronomy&quot;, Siméon Denis Poisson&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Mechanics&quot;, Joseph-Louis Lagrange&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Analytical Functions&quot;, Leonhard Euler&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Algebra&quot; and &quot;Isoperimetrical Problems&quot;, Alexis Clairaut&#x27;s &quot;Figure of the Earth&quot;, Gaspard Monge&#x27;s &quot;Application of Analysis to Geometry&quot;, and François Callet&#x27;s &quot;Logarithmus&quot;.

In her &quot;Personal Recollections&quot; Somerville expressed the opinion that mathematical science was at a low ebb in Britain, due to a reverence for Newton that prevented scientists from adopting calculus. On the Continent astronomical and mechanical science had reached a high degree of perfection. In her opinion this deadlock was not broken until 1816, when Charles Babbage, John Herschel and George Peacock published a translation of the lectures of Sylvestre Lacroix, then a state-of-the-art calculus textbook.

While staying with her family in Scotland, Somerville became acquainted with several leading intellectual lights, such as Henry Brougham. In 1812 she married another cousin, Dr William Somerville (1771–1860), inspector of the Army Medical Board, with whom she had four children. He encouraged and aided her in the study of the physical sciences. In 1817 her husband was elected to the Royal Society and together they moved in the leading social circles of the day. Somerville was well known to scientists, as well as to leading writers and artists. Painter J. M. W. Turner knew that Somerville and her husband&#x27;s family were neighbors of the writer Walter Scott. She wrote, &quot;I shall never forget the charm of this little society, especially the supper-parties at Abbotsford, when Scott was in the highest glee, telling amusing tales, ancient legends, ghost and witch stories.&quot;

In 1819 Somerville&#x27;s husband was appointed physician to Chelsea Hospital and the family moved into a government house at Hanover Square. Somerville was a friend of Anne Isabella Milbanke, Baroness Wentworth, and was mathematics tutor to her daughter, Ada Lovelace. With Somerville, Lovelace attended scientific gatherings where she met Charles Babbage. Somerville College owns a letter from Babbage to Somerville inviting her to view his &#x27;Calculating Engine&#x27;. Somerville frequently visited Babbage while he was &quot;making his Calculating-machines&quot;. Somerville and Lovelace maintained a close friendship and when Lovelace encountered difficulties with a mathematical calculation, she would walk to Somerville&#x27;s house and discuss the matter over a cup of tea.

In 1823 the Somervilles&#x27; youngest daughter died after an illness.

While living in London the Somervilles travelled through Europe on a number of occasions, leaving their children with their German governess. Among their travel companions was the jurist and politician Sir James Mackintosh. Before leaving London the Somervilles contacted the people they wanted to meet, which included numerous celebrated intellectuals. The Somervilles also received frequent visitors; writer Maria Edgeworth would visit them when in England.

== Science practice and writing ==
Somerville conducted experiments to explore the relationship between light and magnetism. Her first paper, &quot;The magnetic properties of the violet rays of the solar spectrum&quot;, was published in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot; in 1826. Although her conclusions were faulty, the topic was of popular interest at the time and the paper brought her to notice in scientific circles. Using a sample of silver nitrate supplied by Michael Faraday, Somerville conducted experiments on the blackening effect of sunlight, the reaction used in early experiments in photography. She later developed her technique by using an optical prism and vegetable dyes, producing an early version of the optical spectrometer. Sir David Brewster, inventor of the kaleidoscope, wrote in 1829 that Mary Somerville was &quot;certainly the most extraordinary woman in Europe – a mathematician of the very first rank with all the gentleness of a woman&quot;.

Lord Brougham asked Somerville to translate the &quot;Mécanique Céleste&quot; of Pierre-Simon Laplace for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Laplace had, in five exhaustive volumes, summed up the current state of gravitational mathematics. &quot;Mécanique Céleste&quot; was acclaimed as the greatest intellectual achievement since the &quot;Principia&quot;. Somerville produced not just a translation, but also an expanded version of the first two volumes. She wrote a standalone exposition of the mathematics behind the workings of the Solar System, of which she said &quot;I translated Laplace&#x27;s work from algebra into common language&quot;. It was published in 1831, under the title of &quot;The Mechanism of the Heavens,&quot; and it immediately made her famous. Until the 1880s &quot;Mechanism&quot; was set as a textbook for undergraduates at the University of Cambridge.

After receiving a copy of &quot;Mechanism&quot; Joanna Baillie wrote to Somerville, &quot;I feel myself greatly honoured by receiving such a mark of regard from one who has done more to remove the light estimation in which the capacity of women is too often held than all that has been accomplished by the whole Sisterhood of Poetical Damsels &amp; novel-writing Authors.&quot; The book was praised by George Peacock, Professor of the University of Cambridge, thus many of the 750 copies printed were bought in Cambridge. Reviews were favourable and Somerville received letters of congratulation from &quot;many men of science&quot;. She was elected honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy, the Bristol Philosophical Institution, and the Société de Physique et d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle de Genève in 1834. The British Crown granted her a civil pension of £200 a year in recognition of her eminence in science and literature.

Somerville was passionate about astronomy and believed it to be the most extensive example of the connection of the physical sciences in that it combined the sciences of number and quantity, of rest and motion.

In Somerville&#x27;s time the value of scientific publications depended on the currency of the information, therefore frequent editions had to be produced. Her subsequent books reflect the time that she could be free in her domestic life as her children became more independent. They also reflect the need to earn money, as the Somervilles suffered through a number of financial crises that peaked in 1835. She publicly and plausibly maintained that she wrote only for pleasure. Privately she paid considerable attention to the profitability of her books. Through personal connections she could secure John Murray as the publisher of her first book, &quot;Mechanism&quot;, and he remained her publisher throughout her long career. Murray later commented that despite having made little profit he was very pleased to have had the honour of publishing the works of such an extraordinary person. Her second book, &quot;On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences,&quot; sold 15,000 copies and established her reputation in elite science.She was among those who discussed a hypothetical planet perturbing Uranus. In the 6th edition of &quot;Connexion&quot; (1842) she wrote, &quot;If after the lapse of years the tables formed from a combination of numerous observations should be still inadequate to represent the motions of Uranus, the discrepancies may reveal the existence, nay, even the mass and orbit of a body placed for ever beyond the sphere of vision&quot;. Predictions were fulfilled in 1846 with the discovery of Neptune revolving at a distance of 3,000,000,000 miles from the Sun. &quot;The mass of Neptune, the size and position of his orbit in space, and his periodic time, were determined from his disturbing action on Uranus before the planet itself had been seen.&quot; &quot;Connexion&quot; ran to 10 editions, more than 9,000 copies and was its publisher&#x27;s most successful science book until &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; by Charles Darwin. It was translated into German and Italian and went through various editions in the United States.
Her book &quot;Physical Geography&quot; was published in 1848 and was the first English textbook on the subject. It remained in use until the early 20th century. &quot;Physical Geography&quot; was financially successful and brought her the Victoria Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society. Somerville followed, as she said, &quot;the noble example of Baron Humboldt, the patriarch of physical geography&quot;, and she took an extended view of geography that included the Earth, its animal, &quot;vegetable inhabitants&quot;, as well as &quot;the past and present condition of man, the origin, manners, and languages of existing nations, and the monuments of those that have been&quot;.
&quot;Physical Geography&quot; starts with describing the overall structure of planet Earth, along with a brief allusion to the location of the Earth within the Solar System. Subsequently, the book focuses on terrestrial topics, such as the most basic features of land and water, and formations such as mountains, volcanoes, oceans, rivers and lakes. Somerville goes on to discuss the elements that govern temperature, such as light, electricity, storms, the aurora and magnetism. Eventually the book turns to vegetation, birds and mammals, and their geographical distribution in the Arctic, Europe, Asia, Africa, America and the Antarctic. Somerville ends the book with a discussion of &quot;the distribution, condition, and future prospects of the human race&quot;. She emphasises the reciprocal dependencies in physical geography and the relationship between human beings and nature. In line with Victorian thinking, Somerville asserts the superiority of human beings, but maintains the interdependencies and interconnectedness of creation. &quot;Physical Geography&quot; sold more copies than any of her other books and earned Humboldt&#x27;s admiration. After receiving a copy of the book he wrote to her: &quot;You alone could provide your literature with an original cosmological work&quot;.

Her fourth book, &quot;Molecular and Microscopic Science,&quot; took 10 years to write. Published in 1869, she soon had doubts about devoting herself to popularising science, instead of concentrating on mathematics alone. Of the book she said: &quot;In writing this book I made a great mistake, and repent it - Mathematics are the natural bent of my mind. If I had devoted myself exclusively to that study, I might probably have written something useful, as a new era had begun in that science.&quot; Regardless, the book was another success. It gave an up-to-date description of the latest discoveries revealed through the microscope and was published in two volumes and three parts. In the first part Somerville explained the latest thinking on atoms and molecules, the second covered plant life, while the third explored animal life. The book included 180 illustrations, which caused her publisher great expense.

She was elected to the American Geographical and Statistical Society in 1857 and the Italian Geographical Society in 1870, and was made a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Death==

From 1833 onwards Somerville and her husband spent most of their time in Italy. Somerville maintained correspondence with a large number of leading scientists and remained engaged in current debates on facts and theories.

In 1868, four years before her death at 91, she was the first person to sign John Stuart Mill&#x27;s unsuccessful petition for female suffrage. In her autobiography Somerville wrote that &quot;British laws are adverse to women&quot;. She detailed the obstacles she had faced in obtaining an education as a young girl, though she did not speculate on the nature of the problem. During her lifetime agitation had grown for women&#x27;s access to higher education. In 1875 astronomer Maria Mitchell was told by a college president that he &quot;would hire a woman scientist if she was as good as Mary Somerville&quot;.
Somerville died at Naples on 29 November 1872, and was buried there in the English Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In the year following Somerville&#x27;s death, her autobiographical &quot;Personal Recollections&quot; was published, consisting of reminiscences written during her old age. Over 10,000 pages are in the Somerville Collection of the Bodleian Library and Somerville College, Oxford. The collection includes papers relating to her writing and published work, and correspondence with family members, scientists and writers, as well as other figures in public life. Also included is substantial correspondence with the Byron and Lovelace families.

Her shell collection was given to Somerville College, Oxford by her descendants.

Somerville Square in Burntisland is named after her family and marks the site of their home.

Somerville College, Oxford, was named after Somerville, as are Somerville House, Burntisland, where she lived for a time, and Somerville House, a high school for girls in Brisbane, Australia. One of the Committee Rooms of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh has been named after her.

Somerville Island (), a small island in Barrow Strait, Nunavut, was named after her by Sir William Edward Parry in 1819.

The Somerville Club was founded in 1878 in London, by 1887 it was re-established as the New Somerville Club, and it disappeared by 1908.

The vessel was launched in 1835 at Liverpool. She traded with India for Taylor, Potter &amp; Co., of Liverpool, and disappeared with the loss of all aboard in late 1852 or early 1853.
Mary Somerville is featured in miniature in The English Bijou Almanack, 1837, with poetry by Letitia Elizabeth Landon.

5771 Somerville (1987 ST1) is a main-belt asteroid discovered on 21 September 1987 by E. Bowell at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, and named after her. Somerville crater is a small lunar crater in the eastern part of the Moon. It lies to the east of the prominent crater Langrenus. It is one of a handful of lunar craters named after women.

In February 2016 Somerville was shortlisted, along with Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell and civil engineer Thomas Telford, in a public competition run by the Royal Bank of Scotland to decide whose face should appear on the bank&#x27;s new £10 notes, to be issued in 2017. Later that month RBS announced that she had won the public vote, held on Facebook. The banknotes, bearing her image, were issued in the second half of 2017.

On 2 February 2020, Google celebrated her with a Google Doodle.

On 1 April 2022, a satellite named after Somerville (ÑuSat 26, COSPAR 2022–033) was launched into space as part of the Satellogic Aleph-1 satellite constellation.

==Children==
From her first marriage she had a son, Woronzow Greig (1805–1865), named after Count Semyon Vorontsov, the Russian ambassador in London who had appointed Samuel Greig as his Consul General. Woronzow married Agnes Graham but all their children died at birth or in infancy.

From her second marriage she had three daughters and one son: Margaret Farquhar Somerville (1813–1823; died in childhood), Thomas Somerville (1814–1815; died in infancy), Martha Charters Somerville (1815–1879) and Mary Charlotte Somerville (1817–1875). Her two surviving daughters spent most of their lives caring for Mary.

<doc id="600173" wikidata="Q7875318" url="?curid=600173" title="USS Wasp (1775)">
<text>USS &quot;Wasp&quot; was originally a merchant schooner named &quot;Scorpion&quot;, built at Baltimore, and purchased under authority from the Second Continental Congress dated 2 December 1775 by Col. Benjamin Harrison sometime between 2 and 18 December 1775, the first US naval ship to be given that name. She was outfitted in Baltimore from December 1775 to early 1776; and commissioned in December 1775 or January 1776, Capt. William Hallock in command.

&quot;Wasp&quot; set sail from Baltimore on 14 January 1776 in company with and a convoy of ships bound for the Delaware Capes. By virtue of their voyage to meet Commodore Esek Hopkins&#x27; squadron at the Delaware Capes, &quot;Wasp&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; appear to be the first ships of the Continental Navy to get to sea. They joined Hopkins&#x27; squadron on 13 February; and, four days later, the first American squadron to put to sea began its maiden voyage.

Interpreting his orders rather liberally, by ignoring those portions which related to operations in the Chesapeake Bay and along the southern coast of the colonies, Hopkins led his fleet directly to the Bahamas. The ships, minus &quot;Hornet&quot; and , arrived at Abaco in the Bahamas on 1 March, and Hopkins began laying plans for the raid on New Providence. The fleet ran in to attempt a landing at the port of Nassau but failed to achieve surprise. The landing, therefore, went forward several miles to the east of the town. &quot;Wasp&quot; and covered the Marines as they went ashore, but their guns never fired because the landing was not opposed. That afternoon, the landing force took Fort Montague and the following day captured the town of Nassau and Fort Nassau. They took a large quantity of cannon—close to 90 pieces, and 15 brass mortars—but the governor had managed to foil the mission in its primary objective by spiriting away the bulk of the gunpowder which had been stored there. Hopkins had to settle for 24 casks of powder out of the 174 originally stored there. The cannon and other military stores captured, however, more than justified the enterprise.

The fleet remained at Nassau for about two weeks loading the booty of war. So large was the take that several local ships had to be pressed into service to carry the materiel back to North America. Hopkins&#x27; squadron finally hoisted sail on 17 March and set course for New England. &quot;Wasp&quot;, however, parted with the main fleet and made her way independently back to the Delaware capes and thence into port at Philadelphia, where she arrived on 4 April.

After repairs at Philadelphia, &quot;Wasp&quot; returned to duty in the Delaware River and Bay. On 5 May, two British men-of-war, the 44-gun and the 28-gun , entered the bay with several prizes. In the face of these two formidable enemies, &quot;Wasp&quot; retreated into Christiana Creek, but came out again on the 8th to join a force of galleys in attacking &quot;Roebuck&quot; after she had run aground. During the ensuing engagement, the Continental schooner captured the British brig &quot;Betsey&quot; and took her into Philadelphia where the British officers were placed in jail.

The schooner continued to operate on the Delaware River and Bay and along the nearby Atlantic coast for the remainder of her career.
On 28 June, she engaged in the Battle of Turtle Gut Inlet to salvage the cargo of &quot;Nancy&quot;.
Near the end of the year, she took three more prizes—&quot;Leghorn Galley&quot; late in October, &quot;Two Brothers&quot; in December, and an unnamed sloop that same month. She also recaptured &quot;Success&quot;, an American ship previously taken by HMS &quot;Roebuck&quot;.

Into the fall of 1777, &quot;Wasp&quot; continued her operations in the vicinity of the Delaware Capes until November when she and four other ships unsuccessfully engaged the British force under Admiral Sir Richard (&quot;Black Dick&quot;) Howe. Philadelphia had already fallen to Admiral Howe&#x27;s brother, General Sir William Howe, late in September, but American forces retained control of the river below the city until losing that engagement. Following the clash, &quot;Wasp&quot; was run aground, set afire, and destroyed when her gunpowder exploded.

<text>The is a mid-size/large family car built in Derbyshire, United Kingdom by the Japanese automaker Toyota from October 1997 to August 2018. It was the direct successor to the European Carina E and was available as a four-door saloon, five-door liftback and estate.

The Avensis was introduced in 1997, to create a more modern name when compared with the Carina E. The &quot;Avensis&quot; name is derived from the French term &quot;avancer&quot;, meaning &quot;to advance&quot; or &quot;move forward&quot;. The Avensis was not sold in North America, and it is related to the Scion tC coupé. It also shared a platform with the Allion and Premio and was available at Japanese dealership network &quot;Toyota Netz Store&quot;.

An MPV called the Avensis Verso (Ipsum in Japan and previously the Picnic in other markets) was built in Japan on a separate platform.

== First generation (T220; 1997) ==
Toyota introduced the Avensis nameplate on its new model, which was launched at the end of 1997. The car was actually an extensive facelift of the previous generation Carina E, with the platform and engines carried over, and a restyled body. The car was built at the Burnaston factory in Derby. At the same time, production of the five-door Toyota Corolla also started at the British plant.

The first generation Avensis had the option of four engines (1.6-, 1.8- and 2.0-litre petrol and a 2.0-litre turbo-diesel) and three body styles (saloon, hatchback and estate). The station wagon was essentially the Japanese-market second generation Toyota Caldina. All of the range gave solid build quality, excellent reliability, a spacious comfortable interior, generous equipment, smooth ride quality and good refinement, but very little in the way of excitement.

The model received a facelift in August 2000. The engines were fitted with variable valve timing, satellite navigation was included as a standard feature along the range and the sporty Avensis 2.0 L &quot;SR&quot; (with body kit and tuned suspension) was added but overall sales remained low.

The Avensis was also sold in South America. In Argentina and Brazil, it was sold as the Toyota Corona (as seen on brochures), but in Chile and Peru, it was sold as the Corona Avensis. In Greece, the Toyota Corona model name had long been synonymous with &quot;taxi&quot;, so Avensis&#x27; sold for taxi use received &quot;Toyota Corona&quot; badging until the 2000 facelift. Models for private use and post-facelift taxis were Avensis, just like in the rest of Europe.

== Second generation (T250; 2003) ==
The second generation Avensis was launched in February 2003, in an all new format; this time it offered more in the way of driver involvement and visual appeal. It was launched in Japan in saloon and estate form in October 2003, replacing the V50 series Vista and Vista Ardeo. Like the Echo/Yaris and Corolla, it was penned by the company&#x27;s design studio in France. Production officially began on 6 January 2003. Following the withdrawal of the Camry in 2004 (2005 in Switzerland), the Avensis became the largest Toyota saloon sold in Western Europe.

Trim levels in the United Kingdom were T2, T3-S, T3-X, T4, T Spirit, T180 and TR. There is also a special edition, based on the T2 called the Colour Collection. In Ireland, there were five trim levels – Terra, Aura, Strata, Luna and Sol. In Japan, the Avensis is sold as 2.0 Xi, 2.0 Li (later replaced by 2.4 Li) and 2.4 Qi. Only the base model 2.0 Xi is offered with four-wheel drive.

This is first and only generation of Avensis sold in Egypt and Morocco, not in Persian Gulf countries.

In the 2004 European Car of the Year contest, the Avensis came in fourth place behind the Fiat Panda (winner), Mazda3 (second) and the Volkswagen Golf (third). However, it won the 2004 Semperit Irish Car of the Year. &quot;What Car?&quot; also awarded the Avensis as the &quot;Best Family Car&quot; for 2004 and 2005.

=== Facelift ===
In 2006, the Avensis received a mid-career facelift. Exterior cosmetic changes include a slightly redesigned logo, a new front grille with double concave lines (including a new darker grille treatment on higher trim levels), new headlamps and rear combination lamps, revised front bumpers and front fog lights, door mirror with turn signals adoption, new tyres, a new wheel design (in two colours) and a new wheel cap design, and five changed body colours. Toyota describes the cosmetic changes as strengthening the family connection with the Corolla and Yaris, and allowing the Avensis to maintain a premium look while giving it a sportier appearance.

Inside, the dashboard materials are revised, the beige interior is replaced by a new grege interior, the instrumentation is revised, the design of the switches is changed, the passenger seat is now height adjustable, alcantara seats are available, and the seats become 60:40 split folding. The Hi-Fi, which previously had a CD and tape player, now only accepts CDs but also plays MP3s. The central screen containing the information of the on-board computer has been removed in favour of a compartment (as on the previous entry-level) and is now integrated into the meters facing the driver.

From a structural point of view, the underbody is reinforced. Finally, the 2.0L D4D diesel engine is replaced by the 2.0L D4D engine. This, coupled to a six-speed manual gearbox, has lowered fuel consumption, emissions, and gives a quoted time of 10.5 seconds.

=== Safety ===
In 2003, the Avensis became the first Japanese vehicle to receive a five-star rating under the Euro NCAP&#x27;s redone testing, with 34 total points it also became the highest rated vehicle they had tested. In 2003, the Avensis also became the first vehicle sold in Europe with a knee airbag.

=== Engines ===
The 1.6-, 1.8- and 2.0-litre petrol and 2.0-litre turbo-diesel engines were carried over from the previous Avensis, and the 2.4-litre four-cylinder from the Camry was also added to the range. This was the first Avensis to be exported to Japan. Due to the Camry Wagon ending production, the Avensis Wagon is exported to New Zealand, in both 1.8- and 2.0-litre forms. In the United Kingdom, there were no 1.6-litre versions available.

The original 115 PS (85 kW) D-4D diesel engine has been complemented with a 2.2 L D-4D in 136 PS (2AD-FTV) and 177 PS (2AD-FHV) versions. Newer versions have dropped the &quot;D-4D&quot; and &quot;2.0&quot; badging from the front wings and tailgate respectively.

From 2005, the 2.4 L version was fitted with a 5-speed automatic transmission.

== Third generation (T270; 2009) ==
The third generation Avensis was revealed at the 2008 Paris Motor Show. It went on sale in January 2009. Like the previous model, it is built at Toyota&#x27;s Burnaston plant in Derbyshire, England. This generation is available in saloon or estate styles only. The third generation Avensis full-year sales goal was of 115,000 vehicles.

Toyota ED2 initially designed the Avensis giving it a more sleek and athletic stance. It has a for the saloon and for the wagon body. Other design goals were to create the most comfortable suspension in its class while still offering sporty handling. The Avensis continued to use front MacPherson struts and rear double wishbones. Unlike the previous generation Avensis models, there is no five door hatchback body style in this lineup, in favour of saloon and estate body styles.

Major options include bi xenon HID headlamps, Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS), and adaptive cruise control.

The Avensis wagon began being imported again to Japan in mid-2011, with 2.0-litre 4-cylinder engine and CVT transmission in Li and Xi variants. The Avensis wagon was discontinued in Japan on 27 April 2018.

=== First facelift (2012–2015) ===
The Avensis underwent a facelift in January 2012. This included a revised front grille and modified tail lamps. The changes were first shown in September 2011 at the Frankfurt Motor Show before sales started in January 2012.

=== Second facelift (2015–2018) ===
A further facelift was shown in March 2015 at the Geneva Motor Show. The facelifted vehicle was officially launched in June 2015. This included a revised front grille, rear view, headlamps and taillamps and a new interior. In addition to the new &quot;Toyota Safety Sense&quot;, new engines were also shown. The 1.6-litre diesel replaces the previous 2.0-litre engine.

=== Safety ===
For safety, seven airbags are standard, including two front row side torso airbags, two side curtain airbags for both rows, and a driver&#x27;s knee airbag. For rear collisions, active front headrests designed to help reduce whiplash are standard as well as brake lamps that flash under emergency braking. Vehicle Stability Control+ (VSC+) applies torque to the steering wheel to aid the driver in steering. A Pre-Collision System (PCS) becomes optional which includes Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Lane Keeping Assist (LKA).

The Avensis received a five-star rating under the latest Euro NCAP ratings scheme with an 81% overall score and a 90% score for adult occupant safety.

=== Engines ===
The Avensis offers three petrol and four diesel engine options. Petrol engines are sourced from Toyota&#x27;s Deeside Engine Plant. The new engines feature more power and lower emissions. The new ZR engines became the first to introduce Toyota&#x27;s &quot;Valvematic&quot; technology.

==== Petrol ====
*1.6-litre 1ZR-FAE 2008–2018
*1.8-litre 2ZR-FAE 2008–2018
*2.0-litre 3ZR-FAE 2008–2018, 2008–2011 (Germany)

All engines are mated to a six-speed manual transmission while the 1.8 L and 2.0 L petrol engines are available with a &quot;Multidrive S&quot; CVT transmission. The 2.2-litre D-4D 150 hp engine is available with a six-speed automatic transmission.

=== Motorsports ===
On 2 August 2010, it was announced the British Touring Car Championship&#x27;s NGTC prototype car would be built around the Toyota Avensis.

Series organiser TOCA, which would fully introduce the new low-cost NGTC technical regulations in 2011, said that the Japanese manufacturer would supply a donor car and a new body shell to the programme. The Avensis was used by Speedworks Motorsport, driven by Tom Ingram, until the end of the 2018 season.

== Discontinuation ==
The Avensis was discontinued in the United Kingdom in August 2018 and across Europe in late 2018. It was partially replaced by the slightly larger XV70 series Camry, which is based on the TNGA-K platform.

== Nameplate usage for other models ==
=== Avensis Verso ===

The Avensis Verso was a large MPV introduced in 2001 using the Avensis nameplate, with room for seven occupants and only initially available with 2.0-litre engines. The Avensis Verso&#x27;s platform preceded the second generation model. The Avensis Verso was the back-to-back winner of Australia&#x27;s &quot;Best People Mover&quot; award in 2002 and 2003. The Avensis Verso continued to be available alongside the second-generation Avensis until 2006.

<text>Jamie Frank Redknapp (born 25 June 1973) is an English former professional footballer who was active from 1989 until 2005. He is a pundit at Sky Sports and an editorial sports columnist at the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. A technically skillful and creative midfielder, who was also an accurate and powerful free-kick taker, Redknapp played for AFC Bournemouth, Southampton, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur, captaining the latter two. He also gained 17 England caps between 1995 and 1999, and was a member of England&#x27;s squad that reached the semi-finals of Euro 1996. His 11 years at Liverpool were the most prolific, playing more than 237 league games for the club and being involved in winning the 1995 Football League Cup final.

In a career that was blighted by a succession of injuries, Redknapp was as famous for his media profile off the field as much as on it. He married the pop singer Louise in 1998. Redknapp comes from a well-known footballing family. His father is the football manager Harry Redknapp. He is also a cousin of Frank Lampard, and a nephew of former West Ham United coach Frank Lampard Sr.

==Club career==
===Summary===
Redknapp was born in Barton on Sea, Hampshire and started his career by joining Tottenham Hotspur as a youth player but turned down their offer of a professional contract, deciding to play for AFC Bournemouth under his father, manager Harry Redknapp. He went on to play for Liverpool where Redknapp would be remembered for his best performances. After that Redknapp returned and played seasons for Tottenham Hotspur then finally joined Southampton, where he played under his father for a second time. Redknapp was also capped 17 times by England, scoring one goal.

===AFC Bournemouth===
Redknapp started out on the road to professional football as a schoolboy at Tottenham Hotspur but began his professional career, at the age of 16, in 1989 at Bournemouth, then managed by his father, Harry. He made 13 appearances for the club before attracting the attention of Liverpool, who signed him on 15 January 1991. Kenny Dalglish had paid £350,000 for Redknapp, who was still only 17 at the time. He was one of the most expensively signed teenagers in English football around this time.

===Liverpool===

Redknapp was one of the last players to be signed by manager Kenny Dalglish before his surprising resignation on 22 February 1991 and later became the youngest Liverpool player to appear in European competition, at 18 years 120 days when making his Liverpool debut against Auxerre in the UEFA Cup on 23 October 1991, by which time Liverpool were being managed by Graeme Souness. This record was broken by Phil Charnock thirteen months later.

Redknapp&#x27;s first goal for Liverpool came in his league debut on 7 December 1991 when he featured as a 63rd-minute substitute for Jan Mølby in a 1–1 draw with Southampton at the Dell.

Following Dalglish&#x27;s departure, Redknapp was part of a transitional Liverpool team under Graeme Souness. He spent most of his first years as a substitute or in the reserves, missing the 1992 FA Cup final triumph and only becoming a regular first-team player in the 1993–94 season, at the expense of Mark Walters. At this time, Redknapp had also become one of the mass-marketed poster boy icons of the newly developing Premier League where, alongside other photogenic young players like Manchester United players Ryan Giggs and Lee Sharpe, he was used in commercials, advertising spots and for the league&#x27;s promotional purposes in merchandising and sales, with the result being that football stars had become idols on par with rock stars and pop stars, by and around the mid to late 1990s.

Redknapp&#x27;s contributions peaked during the 1998–99 season as he created numerous chances and scored 10 goals under new boss Gérard Houllier. Redknapp became vice- and then full club captain by 1999–2000 following the departures of John Barnes, Steve McManaman and Paul Ince.

His contributions helped the club back into the top three of the Premier League but a knee injury curtailed his involvement in the 2000–01 season and in a bid to cure long-standing injury troubles he underwent knee surgery under renowned knee specialist Dr Richard Steadman in the United States. As a result, Redknapp was unable to participate in the whole of the club&#x27;s cup treble campaign which yielded the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. Although injured, as the club captain he was called up by his teammates to receive the FA Cup with vice-captain Robbie Fowler at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. He made his comeback from injury during the pre-season tour before the 2001–02 season.

Redknapp&#x27;s return did not last long as he was again struck by injury. On 27 October 2001 he played and scored in a 2–0 win over Charlton Athletic at The Valley, and then 3 days later he played what would prove to be his last game for the Merseyside club against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League. He had played 308 times for the Reds and scored 41 goals, becoming a favourite amongst Liverpool fans, who included him at number 40 in the 2006 poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Redknapp was allowed to join Glenn Hoddle&#x27;s Tottenham Hotspur on a free transfer on 18 April 2002 with just a couple of fixtures remaining of the 2001–02 season. He made his debut at the beginning of the following campaign when he played on 17 August 2002 in the 2–2 league draw with his former club Liverpool&#x27;s rival Everton at Goodison Park. Redknapp&#x27;s pass into the path of Matthew Etherington allowed Etherington to score his first Premier League goal.

Redknapp scored his first goal for the club a week later on 26 August 2002 in the 1–0 league win over Aston Villa at White Hart Lane. Redknapp played 49 times for Spurs scoring 4 goals in his years with the club before becoming his father Harry&#x27;s first signing for Southampton on 4 January 2005.

===Southampton===
The 31-year-old joined Southampton&#x27;s fight against relegation on a free transfer and made his debut on 5 January 2005 in the 3–3 league draw with Fulham at St Mary&#x27;s. Redknapp&#x27;s only goal for the club came three days later in the 3–1 FA Cup 3rd round victory over Northampton Town at Sixfields Stadium.

Redknapp was rarely fully fit during his brief spell at the Saints and was not able to prevent them from being relegated to the Championship after 27 successive seasons of top flight football.

At the end of the season, on 19 June 2005, the 31-year-old Redknapp decided to retire from the game due to his constant injury problems and on the advice of his medical specialists.

==International career==
England manager Terry Venables gave Redknapp his international debut on 6 September 1995 in the 0–0 international friendly with Colombia at Wembley. The game is probably best remembered for his mishit cross that produced René Higuita&#x27;s famous &#x27;scorpion kick&#x27;. It ranked 94th in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Sporting Moments&quot; in 2002.

Redknapp was capped 17 times for England but played just 39 minutes at a major tournament, which was during the Euro 96 campaign when he appeared as a substitute against Scotland in the group stage. Rob Smyth later wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Redknapp&#x27;s &quot;slick passing greased some slow-moving wheels&quot;. Injury ruled him out of contention for both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000.

His only international goal came on 10 October 1999 in the 2–1 friendly victory against Belgium at the Stadium of Light, Sunderland.

==Coaching==
On 21 September 2007, Chelsea reportedly approached Redknapp to become Avram Grant&#x27;s assistant, as Chelsea&#x27;s owner billionaire Roman Abramovich looked to shake up Stamford Bridge&#x27;s coaching staff, though no appointment was forthcoming.

On 11 December 2008, it was announced Jamie Redknapp would become coach of Chelsea reserves two days a week whilst studying for his UEFA coaching badges. The vacancy arose after former Chelsea reserves coach Brendan Rodgers was hired by Championship outfit Watford.

==Media career==
Redknapp began his career in 2004 as a studio-based pundit on BBC during the European Championships. Since retiring he had gone into punditry full-time and is a regular studio pundit on Sky Sports alongside former England teammate Gary Neville. He is also a regular columnist on the Sky Sports website.

In 2005, Redknapp launched a bi-monthly magazine with his wife Louise and former teammate Tim Sherwood named &quot;Icon Magazine&quot;, aimed at professional footballers and their families.

In 2010, he was made host and mentor on the Sky1 show &quot;Football&#x27;s Next Star&quot;, and a team captain in the Sky1 sports game show &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;.

Redknapp has received significant attention for his repeated overuse and misuse of the word &quot;literally&quot;, in quotes such as &quot;he literally chopped him in half in that challenge&quot;, &quot;Alonso and Sissoko have been picked to literally sit in front of the back four&quot;, &quot;Drogba literally destroyed Senderos today&quot;, &quot;in his youth, Michael Owen was literally a greyhound&quot;, &quot;he had to cut back inside onto his left, because he literally hasn&#x27;t got a right foot&quot;, &quot;Martin Jol&#x27;s head is literally on the chopping block&quot; and &quot;these balls now – they literally explode off your feet&quot;. In 2010, he was presented with the Foot in Mouth Award from the Plain English Campaign for his poor use of English.

On 22 April 2021, chat show &quot;Redknapp&#x27;s Big Night Out&quot; premieried on Sky One, presented by Jamie and Harry Redknapp with comedian Tom Davis.

==Personal life==
Redknapp&#x27;s father is football manager Harry Redknapp, and his mother is Sandra Harris. He has one older brother, Mark, who is a model. Redknapp is the maternal cousin of Frank Lampard, whose father is former West Ham United player and Harry&#x27;s former managerial assistant Frank Lampard Sr.

Redknapp grew up on the south coast as his father was coaching Bournemouth at that time. He attended Twynham School in Christchurch and started playing in the Sunday league youth teams with his brother.

On 29 June 1998, Redknapp married pop singer Louise Nurding. They have two sons. After 19 years of marriage, Jamie and Louise Redknapp were granted a divorce on 29 December 2017.

On 18 October 2021, Redknapp married model Frida Andersson, at Chelsea Register Office in London. The couple have one son.

<text>Cool World is a 1992 American adult live-action/animated hybrid fantasy film directed by Ralph Bakshi and written by Michael Grais and Mark Victor. Starring Kim Basinger, Gabriel Byrne and Brad Pitt, it tells the story of a cartoonist who finds himself in a cartoon-like universe he believes he created, where he is seduced by one of the characters, a femme fatale who wants to become human.

Following the success of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988) and his own professional resurgence in television in the late 1980s, Bakshi conceived it as a horror film. He brought the idea to Paramount Pictures, and became attached to direct; it was his first feature film in nearly a decade, and intended as his comeback. However, interference from producer Frank Mancuso Jr. led to an extensive rewrite from Michael Grais, Mark Victor, and an uncredited Larry Gross. As a result, relations between Bakshi, Mancuso, and the studio deteriorated, and the film had a highly tumultuous production.

&quot;Cool World&quot; was released by Paramount on July 10, 1992. Upon its release, the film was a critical and commercial failure. It was criticized for its story, acting, and the effects combining animation and live-action; however, the soundtrack and visuals received praise. The film was a box-office bomb, grossing $14 million against a budget of $28 million. Despite its poor reception, &quot;Cool World&quot; developed a cult following.

==Plot==

In 1945 Las Vegas, World War II veteran Frank Harris returns to his mother and invites her to a ride on his motorcycle. The two are involved in a traffic collision where Frank&#x27;s mother dies. Afterwards, Frank is inadvertently transported to a cartoon-like alternate universe called &quot;Cool World&quot;, where he restarts his life as a detective for Cool World&#x27;s local police department.

Forty-seven years later, underground cartoonist Jack Deebs is released from a ten-year prison sentence for murdering a man he found in bed with his wife. During his imprisonment, he created a series of comics called Cool World based on recurring visions of his, prominently featuring femme fatale Holli Would. Holli&#x27;s wish is to escape Cool World and become a real person, which is possible when &quot;doodles&quot; (slang for Cool World&#x27;s inhabitants) have sexual intercourse with &quot;noids&quot; (slang for humans). However, Frank and his doodle partner Nails keep a vigilant eye on Holli to ensure that the two dimensions do not intertwine.

Shortly after his release, Jack is transported to Cool World and smuggled into a local nightclub by Holli and her henchmen. Frank aggressively confronts Jack, explaining that Cool World has existed long before he created his series. He also warns him that writing implements, such as his fountain pen, are lethal to the doodles; and to abstain from having sex with Holli, as her transforming into a noid can be dangerous for both dimensions. Despite these warnings, Frank himself is in love with another doodle, Lonette, but limits himself to platonic advances. Jack succumbs to Holli&#x27;s advances and she proceeds to seduce and has sex with him, transforming her into a noid. Holli steals Jack&#x27;s pen to entrap Nails, and leaves with Jack for the real world.

In the real world, Holli is excited and overwhelmed experiencing real sensations. Due to her presence there, she and Jack spontaneously flicker in between noid and doodle forms. While contemplating their situation, Holli tells Jack about the &quot;Spike of Power&quot;, an artifact which was the cause of Frank being transported into Cool World and placed on top of the Union Plaza Hotel by a doodle who crossed into the real world, and admits she wants to use it to remain in her noid form permanently. When Jack displays skepticism about the idea, Holli abandons him to search for the spike on her own.

Frank learns what has happened and returns to the real world, where he reluctantly teams up with Jack to stop Holli. They arrive at the hotel as Holli begins to climb to the top of the tower. In his pursuit, Frank is pushed off the building to his death by Holli. As she seizes the spike, she releases a multitude of monstrous doodles into the real world, affecting her surroundings. The Spike also transforms Jack into a superhero-like doodle, and, in the ensuing chaos, frees Nails from the pen.

Although enticed to begin a new life in the real world with Holli, Jack returns the Spike to its rightful place, sending him, Holli and the invading doodles back from whence the creatures came and restoring the balance between their dimensions. Nails brings Frank&#x27;s body back to Cool World, where he and Lonette mourn his loss. However, as she finds out from Nails that Holli was briefly in her doodle form when she killed Frank, she explains that a noid killed by a doodle in the real world can be reborn as a doodle in Cool World. Frank is transformed into a doodle, allowing him to continue his relationship with Lonette. Meanwhile, Jack begins planning his new life together with Holli, to her dismay.

==Production== 
===Development===
Following a career resurgence with &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot; in the late 1980s, in 1990, Ralph Bakshi concepted a new film project involving a cartoonist who created a comic book while in prison that makes him an underground &quot;star&quot;. The cartoonist would go on to have sexual intercourse with a femme fatale &quot;doodle&quot; named &quot;Debbie Dallas (a play on the title of the pornographic film, &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot;)&quot; and father a hybrid child with her; half-cartoon, and half-human. The child, growing up resenting its father for abandoning it, would grow up and go on to make a pilgrimage to the real world to try to hunt down its father and kill him. Ralph pitched the idea as a live-action animated horror film to Paramount Pictures, where he had served as the final head of the studio&#x27;s animation division some years earlier. Bakshi stated that Paramount Pictures &quot;bought the idea in ten seconds.&quot; In addition to Bakshi himself writing his own screenplay going off of his concept, Michael Grais and Mark Victor, along with an uncredited Larry Gross wrote several drafts of the screenplay based on Bakshi&#x27;s original concept. Grais has accused Bakshi of lying about his contribution, noting he and Victor won repeated arbitrations regarding their credits. Producer Frank Mancuso Jr. — son of Paramount president Frank Mancuso Sr. — became attached as producer, leading Paramount to greenlight the film in November 1990. A long-running rumor attached to the film is that when Bakshi discovered that his original concept had been re-written behind his back without his knowledge or permission, he got into a physical altercation with Frank Mancuso Jr. that involved him punching the producer in the mouth. However, in a 2022 phone interview with Kevin E. G. Perry of &quot;The Independent&quot;, Bakshi put that rumor to rest, saying, &quot;I never punched Frank Mancuso Jr. [...] That was just a rumour. I yelled at him a couple of times, but that wasn&#x27;t his fault. I like Frank. I never punched him. Can you set that straight?&quot;

===Casting and production===
Bakshi had originally intended to cast Pitt and Drew Barrymore in the film&#x27;s leading roles. Instead, the studio insisted on casting bigger box office draws, leading to Basinger and Byrne being cast in late January 1991. The role of Frank was created for Pitt. Principal photography lasted from March 15 to April 19, 1991, with scenes being filmed both in Las Vegas and at soundstages at Paramount in Los Angeles.

The relationship between Bakshi and Paramount quickly deteriorated during production. Mancuso convinced Paramount that the film&#x27;s potential R rating from the MPAA in the United States, which would restrict attendance from anyone under 17 without a parent or guardian, would be too risky. Hence why Mancuso hired Larry Gross to revise the screenplay to target a more general PG-13 MPAA rating, and presented it on the first day of production. Bakshi stated he felt &quot;backstabbed&quot; by Mancuso. Bakshi also claimed Basinger had approached him and Mancuso during production to rewrite the film herself because she &quot;thought it would be great [...] if she would be able to show this picture in hospitals to sick children [...] I said, &#x27;Kim, I think that&#x27;s wonderful, but you&#x27;ve got the wrong guy to do that with.&#x27;&quot;

===Animation style===
Bakshi&#x27;s animation was done on the Paramount lot. The film&#x27;s animators were never given a screenplay, instead told by Bakshi to &quot;do a scene that&#x27;s funny, whatever you want to do!&quot;

The visual design of the live-action footage was intended to look like &quot;a living, walk-through painting,&quot; a visual concept Bakshi had long wanted to achieve. The film&#x27;s sets were based upon enlargements of designer Barry Jackson&#x27;s paintings. The animation was strongly influenced by Fleischer Studios (whose cartoons were released by Paramount in the 1930s and 1940s) and Terrytoons (where Bakshi once worked, and whose Mighty Mouse character was also adapted into a series by Bakshi). The artwork by the character Jack Deebs was drawn by underground comix artist Spain Rodriguez.

==Soundtrack==
A soundtrack album, &quot;Songs from the Cool World&quot;, featuring recordings by My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, Moby, Ministry, The Future Sound of London, and others, was released in 1992 by Warner Bros. Records. It included the track &quot;Real Cool World&quot; by David Bowie, his first original solo material in roughly three years; the song was written exclusively for the film. The soundtrack received stronger reviews from critics than the film itself, including a four-star rating from AllMusic. Mark Isham&#x27;s original score for &quot;Cool World&quot;, featuring a mixture of jazz, orchestral pieces, and electronic remixes, and performed by the Munich Symphony Orchestra, was released on compact disc by Varèse Sarabande, and in complete form in 2015 by Quartet. It also received positive reviews.

==Promotion==
Paramount focused the film&#x27;s promotion both on being as Bakshi&#x27;s comeback, and the hypersexual imagery of Holli Would. It was considered by some pundits as misaimed. Paramount&#x27;s marketing president Barry London noted the film &quot;unfortunately did not seem to satisfy the younger audience it was aimed at.&quot; Designer Milton Knight recalled that premiere audiences &quot;actually wanted a wilder, raunchier &quot;Cool World&quot;.&quot;

Several different licensed video games based on the film were created by Ocean Software. The first game was developed by Twilight and released in 1992 for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and DOS. Two different games were released in 1993 for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES, alongside a Game Boy version of the former. A four-issue comic book prequel to the film was published as a miniseries by DC Comics. It featured a script by Michael Eury and art work by Stephen DeStefano, Chuck Fiala, and Bill Wray.

===Controversy===
In July 1992, Paramount&#x27;s marketing campaign of the film created controversy by altering the Hollywood Sign to include a tall cutout of Holli Would. The studio&#x27;s request was initially denied by the City of Los Angeles, but reversed once Paramount gave $27,000 to the city, and an additional $27,000 for cleanup after the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Local residents were angered by the sign&#x27;s alteration, largely due to the sexualized image of Holli, and launched a failed lawsuit against the city to stop the alteration. In a letter to the city&#x27;s Recreation and Park Board, commission officials wrote that they were &quot;appalled&quot; by the board&#x27;s approval of the alterations: &quot;...the action your board has taken is offensive to Los Angeles women and is not within your role as custodian and guardian of the Hollywood sign. The fact that Paramount Pictures donated a mere $27,000 to Rebuild L.A. should not be a passport to exploit women in Los Angeles.&quot; Protestors picketed the unveiling of the altered sign.

== Reception ==

===Box office===
&quot;Cool World&quot; opened sixth at the North American box office, with $5.5 million. Although set to expand to more theaters in its second weekend, Paramount stunned exhibitors by immediately ceasing advertising for the film. Its lifetime gross was US$14.1 million, barely more than half its reported US$28 million budget.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 4% based on 51 reviews, with an average rating of . The consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Cool World&quot; throws a small handful of visual sparks, but they aren&#x27;t enough to distract from the screenplay&#x27;s thin characters and scattered plot.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 28 based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;C&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

&quot;Variety&quot; reviewer Brian Lowry compared the film to an extended music video, praising the soundtrack and visuals, but panning the story. The plot was heavily derided by other reviewers, with a review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; saying &quot;[T]he plot makes almost no sense.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the wrote for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; that the film &quot;misses one opportunity after another ... [it is] a surprisingly incompetent film.&quot; Leonard Maltin panned the film as &quot;too serious to be fun, too goofy to take seriously; lead characters unlikable and unappealing. Looks like a Roger Corman version of &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot;.&quot; Chris Hicks for &quot;Deseret News&quot; described it as &quot;a one-joke movie – and it&#x27;s a dirty joke. [...] And much of what&#x27;s going on here seems more angry and nasty than inspired or funny.&quot; The film&#x27;s acting and effects were singled out by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reviewer Hal Hinson, who wrote her performance made him wonder &quot;whether Kim Basinger is more obnoxious as a cartoon or as a real person&quot;, and felt that the combination of animation and live action was unconvincing.

In 1997, John Grant wrote in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Fantasy&quot; that &quot;Cool World&quot; &quot;stands as one of the fantastic cinema&#x27;s most significant achievements, an &#x27;Instauration fantasy&#x27; that reveals greater depths with each viewing.&quot; In 2005, animation historian Jerry Beck described the film as being &quot;for adults and Bakshi completists only&quot;. He wrote the film &quot;has a great premise, a great cast, and the best animation he&#x27;s ever been involved with&quot;, but critiquing it as a &quot;pointless rehash of many of Ralph&#x27;s favorite themes, and the story literally goes nowhere&quot;.

In some interviews after the release of the film, Bakshi denounced the film, saying &quot;I thought if I did the animation well, it would be worth it, but you know what? It wasn&#x27;t worth it.&quot; Bakshi also stated that he &quot;had a lot of animators there that I&#x27;d brought in and I thought that maybe I could just have fun animating this stuff, which I did.&quot; In 2022, he stated &quot;I used to disparage it, but not anymore&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Cool World&quot; has some of the best animation I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;
The film garnered a Razzie Award nomination for Kim Basinger as Worst Actress.

<doc id="600198" wikidata="Q540500" url="?curid=600198" title="Eternal (group)">
<text>Eternal are a British R&amp;B girl group formed in 1992, with the line-up originally consisting of sisters Easther and Vernie Bennett, with Kéllé Bryan and the latter&#x27;s friend and classmate Louise Nurding (later and better known as Louise Redknapp), who were also recruited into the group by the label. 

The group became an international success, selling around 10 million records worldwide. Nurding left the group before the release of their second album to focus on her solo career with the same label. Bryan left the group under undisclosed circumstances in 1998. The Bennett sisters were the only members left when the group disbanded in 2000.

Eternal made a brief comeback in 2013, with Bryan returning to the group, only for the group to disband once again in 2014. They were considered the UK&#x27;s answer to the American girl group En Vogue.

Eternal&#x27;s 1993 debut album &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot; peaked at number two on the UK Album Chart and went four-times platinum in the UK. In 1997, they reached number one on the UK Singles Chart with &quot;I Wanna Be the Only One&quot;, which won them the 1997 Mobo Award for Best Single. They also received seven Brit Award nominations. In total they achieved 15 UK Top 20 hits between 1993 and 1999.

==Career==
===1992–1995: Formation, &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot; and Louise&#x27;s departure===
Eternal were formed in 1992 by music manager Oliver Smallman of First Avenue Management, after which Eddie Gordon showed him how the success of En Vogue was built in the United Kingdom. Eternal were quickly signed to EMI Records and released their debut single, &quot;Stay&quot;, in September 1993. The song was a success and it reached number four in the UK Singles Chart. Easther and Vernie Bennett were scouted in a nightclub in London and eventually found Louise Nurding. The trio began working together and recording until Nurding introduced her longtime friend Kéllé Bryan to the management and joined the group.

Eternal released their debut album, &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot; in November 1993, and it reached number two in the UK Albums Chart. The album sold over one million copies in the United Kingdom, and confirmed as four times platinum, making it one of 1994&#x27;s biggest selling albums and the year&#x27;s biggest-selling debut album. They were named Best Group at the &quot;Smash Hits&quot; Poll Winners Party and were nominated for four Brit Awards. Nurding decided to leave the group before the recording of Eternal&#x27;s second album, and went on to pursue a successful solo career. In a 2014 interview, Vernie Bennett stated that the group were &quot;gutted&quot; when Nurding announced she was leaving and it was suggested that Bryan also leave to form a duo with Nurding, which Bryan stated she did not wish to do.

===1995–1998: Trio line-up: &quot;Power of a Woman&quot;, &quot;Before the Rain&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===
Following Nurding&#x27;s departure, the group decided not to replace her and carried on as a trio. &quot;Power of a Woman&quot; was the first album as a trio, and entered the UK chart at number six. It produced four hit singles, &quot;Power of a Woman&quot;, &quot;I Am Blessed&quot; (which they performed for Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in 1995), a remixed version of &quot;Good Thing&quot; and a remixed version of &quot;Secrets&quot;. All continued Eternal&#x27;s tally of Top 10 UK hits.

In 1997, Eternal achieved their first ever UK number one, a duet with BeBe Winans, &quot;I Wanna Be the Only One&quot;, which became the second most played song on UK Radio in 1997, and stayed at the top spot for one week. It was taken from their third album &quot;Before the Rain&quot;, which also included &quot;Don&#x27;t You Love Me&quot;. The album peaked at number three in the UK.

Eternal&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package was released in the latter part of 1997, peaking at number two on the UK Albums Chart and becoming the highest-selling hits package of the year. In 2013, Eternal&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was confirmed as being the biggest selling best-of album by a girl group in the UK. It featured their last top-10 single &quot;Angel of Mine&quot;, which reached number four. &quot;Angel of Mine&quot; became an EP that featured four different mixes, including a remix by veteran party producer Frankie Cutlass and a cover of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s track &quot;Dreams&quot; featuring Grand Puba and Sadat X.

===1998–2000: Duo line-up: Bryan&#x27;s departure, self-titled album, and split===
In 1998, a week after their Party in the Park performance, Bryan was controversially dismissed by the Bennett sisters via fax from their solicitor. Their reasons cited &quot;a breakdown in professional relations&quot;. A short time later, Bryan was diagnosed with lupus and was forced to abandon plans for a solo career. Easther &amp; Vernie were thought to have recruited a new member, TJ Arlette, but this now seems firmly disputed by Vernie in this instagram comment asking ‘who is this Tj’ The sisters carried on as a duo. &quot;What&#x27;Cha Gonna Do&quot; was released from their fourth album &quot;Eternal&quot; and hit number 16. With lack of promotion, the album charted at number 87. The next single &quot;I Cry Real Tears&quot; was expected to be released in April 2000, with a new version of the song; however, the single was scrapped due to poor sales of the album and Eternal were released from their recording deal with EMI. Internationally, the track &quot;Free to Live&quot; was released and translated to &quot;Libre para vivir&quot;, which had moderate success in some European countries. The last televised performance by Eternal was on &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; in 2000 where the Bennett sisters performed the track &quot;He Is&quot;.

===2013–2014: &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;===
In 2006, it was announced that Eternal would be reforming for a live reunion tour alongside other acts including Boyz II Men. Although only Kéllé Bryan and Easther Bennett would be part of the project (Vernie Bennett was pregnant at the time and Nurding — now known as Louise Redknapp following her marriage to Jamie Redknapp — was busy with her solo career). In an interview around the time Bryan claimed that the band had been offered numerous record deals over the past few years since the group had split up. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the tour was cancelled. In 2011, Vernie joined online social networking site Twitter. This news gave hope to many fans that eventually Eternal would be making a comeback at some point in the future.

Eternal officially confirmed in late 2013 that they would be reforming for the ITV2 documentary &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, although Louise Redknapp would not be rejoining the group. Redknapp confirmed in an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; that Eternal was reforming without her. Following the announcement of the group&#x27;s reformation, their 1997 Greatest Hits album climbed to number 1 on the ITunes hip hop chart in January 2014. Following the group&#x27;s episode airing, their Greatest Hits album entered at number 27 in the official ITunes chart. The group reformed to perform a concert at the Hammersmith Apollo in March 2014, where they performed alongside BeBe Winans for their hit single &quot;I Wanna Be the Only One&quot;.

===2023-2024: Second reunion; New Lineup===
On 23 September 2023 the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that the group had planned to reunite for a tour in 2024. This would have been the first time that the group&#x27;s original line-up had played together since Redknapp left the group to begin her solo career. However, Bryan and Redknapp pulled out of the reunion tour, reportedly due to the Bennett sisters&#x27; refusal to perform at LGBTQ Pride events.

On March 2024, it was announced singer Christel Lakhdar would be joining the Bennett Sisters as the new member of Eternal and carrying on with the reunion plans. 

On July 6th, the new lineup of Eternal made their official return at the SuperBoxx festival, marking the band&#x27;s first performance in over decade. 

Recently on their official instagram page, the band announced various upcoming gigs for 2025, with a One off Live concert taking place in Scala, London on April, 30th. 

==Solo careers==
Louise Redknapp () was the first member of &quot;Eternal&quot; to leave to pursue a solo career, releasing several Top 10 singles and albums and performing two UK tours from 1995 to 2003. She has also presented a number of television shows, including &quot;The Clothes Show&quot;, &quot;Something for the Weekend&quot; and &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;.

Kéllé Bryan experienced minor success after leaving Eternal in the form of a no. 14 single called &quot;Higher Than Heaven&quot; in October 1999, but her debut solo album, &quot;Breakfast in Bed&quot;, was never released. A second single, &quot;I Wanna Know&quot;, was cancelled due to further health issues. She went on to launch her own artist management company, Red Hot Entertainment and finished as the female runner-up on the reality TV show &quot;Love Island&quot;. She also diversified into acting, appearing in the BBC sitcom series &quot;Me and Mrs Jones&quot; (2012) with Neil Morrisey, before joining the British soap opera &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; as series regular Martine Deveraux.

Easther Bennett teamed up with reggae band Aswad to record a cover of Diana King&#x27;s &quot;Shy Guy&quot;, which was released as a single in August 2002 and peaked at No. 62 on the UK Singles Chart. She also recorded a solo cover of the classic song &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, which appeared on many &quot;Love&quot; themed compilations around 2002/3 including &quot;The All-Time Classic Tearjerkers&quot;. She also features on the Peter Cox cover of the Marvin Gaye song &quot;Your Precious Love&quot;. She then decided to turn to songwriting and has written for many different artists, including Girls Aloud. Easther also sings backing vocals on the Dina Carroll tracks &quot;This Time&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Stranger&quot; (1993) along with her sister Vernie.

Vernie Bennett stepped out of the limelight following the split of Eternal. She went back to finish studying law and her Bar Vocational Course. Vernie was called to the Bar in 2005 and, in 2006, gave birth to her first child. In August 2010, she signed with ASM Artist Management. She has performed with sister Easther at James Ingham&#x27;s Jog On for Cancer event for Cancer Research UK in 2015. She has also appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;All Star Mr &amp; Mrs&quot; with her husband Bryan.

<doc id="600199" wikidata="Q2721109" url="?curid=600199" title="Gendo Ikari">
<text>is a fictional character from the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; franchise, created by Gainax. In the original anime series with the same name, Gendo is the supreme commander of the special agency Nerv, which is dedicated to the study and annihilation of Angels, a series of mysterious enemies of humans. Gendo is grief-stricken by the sudden death of his wife Yui, and abandons his son Shinji Ikari to devote himself to a plan named Human Instrumentality Project. Years later, Gendo asks Shinji to pilot a giant mecha named Evangelion; his pragmatic, cold, and calculating attitude leads him to use any means to achieve his personal goals. He also appears in the franchise&#x27;s animated feature films and related media, video games, the original net animation &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School&quot;, the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films, and the manga adaptation by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto.

The character, who was originally conceived as a modern version of Victor Frankenstein, is inspired by the personal experiences of the series&#x27; production staff, reflecting the absent, emotionally detached Japanese father figure. &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; director Hideaki Anno&#x27;s abusive father particularly influenced Gendo; the director also took inspiration from psychoanalytic concepts, especially the Freudian Oedipus complex, for his development.

Critics have negatively received Gendo, describing him as one of the meanest characters and one of the nastiest parents in Japanese animation history. Reviewers criticized his unscrupulous, abusive ways, while others were more appreciative of his role in spin-offs and the manga adaptation of the series. Reviewers appreciated Gendo&#x27;s role in the theatrical saga &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;, and particularly in the film &quot;&quot; (2021), and commented positively on his character development. Gendo&#x27;s typical pose with hands clasped at mouth level has become popular, and has been homaged in other anime and manga. Merchandise on the character has also been released.

==Conception==

Hideaki Anno, the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; anime series director and main screenwriter, took Gendo&#x27;s name from a character in a failed Gainax studio project, an anime that was planned before &quot;Evangelion&quot; but was never produced. For his bachelor name, he chose the word ; for his married name, he chose , to connect to the names of other characters in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, inspired by nautical jargon and ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The character was designed by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, mangaka of the comic version of the series. Sadamoto was influenced by the British television series &quot;UFO&quot; and modeled his relationship with Kozo Fuyutsuki on that between Commander Ed Straker and Colonel Alec Freeman from the classic series.

The show&#x27;s production staff chose interpersonal communication, specifically intergenerational communication, as a central theme of the series to reflect on the lack of communication and relational difficulties of the modern world. For the psychology of the character, the protagonist&#x27;s father who is unable to emotionally communicate with his son, the director took inspiration from his personality, just like all the other characters in the series. The special agency Nerv, in particular, was conceived as a metaphor for Gainax studio; Anno also described Gendo as a representation of his shadow, the dark, unconscious side of an individual&#x27;s psyche. The director stated he did not conceive Gendo as a concrete father with a blood tie to his son but as a representation of society, adding; &quot;I don&#x27;t think I projected that much [into him]&quot;.

Gendo was influenced by the personal experiences of staff members, including that of Hideaki Anno, whose father injured his left leg with a power saw in a youthful accident, forcing him to wear a prosthesis. According to Anno himself, his father became emotionally unstable as a result of the accident and he grew up in a tense family environment, marked by physical and emotional punishment from his father. 
According to Kazuya Tsurumaki, assistant director of the series:

In the early design stages of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, Gainax decided to portray Gendo as a &quot;mysterious person in behavior and words&quot;, a staunch defender of the Instrumentality Project, expressive, tumultuous, akin to a twenty-first-century Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Over time, he would become obsessed with research, justifying any means to achieve his goal to the point of transforming his own body and becoming a digitized human being. His goal, however, would be benevolent, in the belief he could realize a utopian dream capable of bringing true equality among people. In the first episode of the series, Gendo would have called Shinji to fight against an Angel named Raziel, and in the fourth episode, titled , he would have ignored his son on his birthday, but these ideas were discarded during the show&#x27;s production.

The writers originally intended Gendo would not have participated in a survey expedition to Antarctica, as in the final scenario; the original draft had him involved in a mysterious accident that would cause the Dead Sea to evaporate, as revealed in the twentieth episode of the show. In the finale, Gendo&#x27;s true goals and the true purpose of the Instrumentality Project would be revealed; the ruins of a place called , which is never mentioned in the final version, would be revealed. The conclusion originally planned by the staff also included a scene in which Gendo, separating from his son Shinji, would have said , similarly to the ending of the previous Gainax studio work, &quot;&quot;.

=== Voice ===
Fumihiko Tachiki voiced Gendo in the original series, in the later films, spin-offs, video games and the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; saga. Tachiki found it difficult to empathize with or understand &quot;Evangelion&quot; and Gendo, and wondered &quot;whether I hated or loved Gendo&quot;. Tachiki was confused during the recordings; he failed to frame Gendo&#x27;s laconic phrases and intentions, and was forced to ask how to recite his lines and interpret a particular phrase. He stated; &quot;Honestly, when I first started the television series, I’d only just been exposed to the story. It turned out to be tough; I really agonized about how to make the character come across. I can&#x27;t say it was a pleasant experience&quot;. During recording sessions for the original series and the 1997 feature films, he received support from the staff, and Hideaki Anno and the sound director coached and directed him.

Tachiki encountered similar difficulties for the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; saga, and in particular for the third installment, &quot;&quot; (2012), which was dubbed almost twenty years after the original series. However, Tachiki, while disconcerted by the futuristic setting and plot changes, was helped by his accumulated experience and greater maturity, due to which he acted more frankly and serenely than in the classic series. For the last installment of the saga, &quot;&quot; (2021), Tachiki remained surprised by the script, having to go over his lines several times while looking at the still-incomplete drawings of the film. The first voice-recording sessions focused on his dialogue with Fututsuki, with a colleague older than him, which allowed him to relax more during the recording phase. Despite the changes in Gendo&#x27;s characterization, the staff did not ask Tachiki to dub him emotionally but naturally, without passion and particular tension. Even in the case of &quot;Thrice Upon a Time&quot;, he had difficulties, given the change of direction. Tachiki&#x27;s throat hurt while he was recording a complicated scene in which he shouts Yui&#x27;s name and had to raise his voice; the production asked him to convey all his emotions and feelings at that moment.

In the North American A.D. Vision version of the series and the 1997 films, Gendo is voiced by Tristan MacAvery, except for additional parts in the director&#x27;s cut and &quot;Rebuild&quot;, in which he is played by John Swasey. MacAvery had difficulties when dubbing the last two episodes, which are entirely set in Shinji&#x27;s inner world; &quot;I had no idea what was going on [in the last two episodes]. I had to figure how I should read the part, flat or philosophical&quot;. MacAvery and the other actors said there was nothing wrong with the English translation since the Japanese original was &quot;incomprehensible&quot;. Ray Chase voiced Gendo in the Netflix dub, while Swasey reprised his role for the Amazon Prime Video &quot;Rebuild&quot; dub.

== Appearances ==
=== &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; ===
Gendo Ikari, originally named Gendo Rokubungi, is presented at the beginning of the series as a cold man head of the special agency Nerv, deputy to the annihilation of the Angels. His parents are never named in the series, and no details are given about his childhood and adolescence. His past is explored in the twenty-first episode of the series. In 1999, when he is thirty-two years old, Gendo is arrested and designates Professor Kozo Fuyutsuki, a lecturer at Kyoto University, as his guarantor. After being exonerated at the hands of the professor, Gendo becomes romantically involved with Yui Ikari, a brilliant researcher and student of Fuyutsuki. The professor does not approve Gendo&#x27;s actions, suspecting ulterior motives on his part. Yui is linked to a secret organization named Seele, and rumors say Gendo&#x27;s only interest is to get close to Seele and exploit Yui&#x27;s talent. To secretly carry out Seele&#x27;s plans, Gendo participates in a research group known as the Katsuragi expedition, which leaves for Antarctica to conduct experiments regarding a mechanism known as the S² engine. On September 12, 2000, Gendo leaves Antarctica with other members of the group, including a man named Lorenz Keel, head of Seele. The next day, in an apparent coincidence, a gigantic natural disaster known as the Second Impact occurs. After marrying Yui, Gendo changes his surname in Ikari and, along with other members of Seele and Professor Fuyutsuki, participates in a United Nations-organized expedition to investigate the Second Impact. A little later, Seele assigns Gendo the role of director of the Laboratory for Artificial Evolution, with the task of directing a secret plan known as Project E.

In 2003, Professor Fuyutsuki collects information about the Second Impact and arrives at the Artificial Evolution Laboratory, threatening the director to make public the truth. Gendo takes him to a bunker below the Laboratory, the headquarters of an organization known as Gehirn, and invites him to collaborate &quot;to build the new history of mankind&quot;. After careful consideration, Fuyutsuki accepts the offer. The following year, Gendo attends an experiment to activate an Eva called Unit 01; due to an accident, Yui disappears and Gendo decides to leave his son Shinji to a guardian. A week after his wife&#x27;s disappearance, Gendo tells Fuyutsuki about the Human Instrumentality Project, which he describes as &quot;the path to godhood that none have ever succeeded in before&quot;. From that moment his goal changes and becomes that of reaching his deceased wife again. In 2010 the Gehirn is disbanded and replaced with the special agency Nerv.

In 2015, after years of silence, Gendo summons Shinji to the city of Tokyo-3 to let him pilot the Eva-01 and face the Angels. He keeps a cold attitude towards his son. Following the battle against the sixth Angel Gaghiel, a man named Ryoji Kaji gives Gendo a small, embryo-like object that is identified as the first Angel Adam. Gendo later implants the embryo in the palm of his right hand. Meanwhile, discrepancies arise between the commander and the Seele, both of which are intent on starting the Human Instrumentality Project. Gendo, unlike the Seele, decides to cause a &quot;forbidden union&quot; between Adam, implanted in his body, and the second Angel Lilith, whose soul is kept inside a girl named Rei Ayanami. After the defeat of the last Angel, Gendo attempts to reunite with Yui, betraying Seele. To implement the plan, he enters the deepest section of the headquarters, Terminal Dogma, with Rei and inserts his right hand into the girl&#x27;s body so she can absorb Adam&#x27;s embryo. Rei, however, betrays Gendo&#x27;s expectations and joins the second Angel against his will, causing his plans to fail. During Instrumentality, Gendo meets the spirit of his wife and is devoured by a projection of the Eva-01.

=== &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; ===

Gendo returns as a primary character in &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; and appears in the first installment of the saga, &quot;&quot; (2007). His character remains virtually identical to that in the anime, summoning Shinji to pilot Evangelion Unit-01. In the movie &quot;&quot; (2009), the second installment of the &quot;Rebuild&quot; tetralogy, his relationship with his son appears better than that in the original anime and manga. In the film&#x27;s opening sequences, Gendo and Shinji visit Yui&#x27;s grave, despite communication difficulties, and later begin to more sincerely communicate their feelings and spend more time together, building a more affectionate relationship than their animated counterparts. Shinji, in particular, begins to connect with his parent through the nudging and encouragement of Misato Katsuragi and, to an even greater extent, Rei Ayanami, who tries to bring the two closer together by cooking them dinner. Anno originally thought of using a similar idea for the fourth episode of the television series, &quot;Hedgehog&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, but the proposal was shelved during production.

In the following installment, &quot;&quot; (2012), set fourteen years after the previous one, Gendo continues to pursue his Instrumentality as the commander of the Nerv, apparently reduced to Vice Commander Fuyutsuki and a boy named Kaworu Nagisa. The man also presents a more aged appearance than in the classic series. In the course of the film, Gendo comes into conflict with Wille, a company headed by Misato Katsuragi created to destroy the Nerv, and orders Shinji to pilot the Eva 13, maintaining the same aloof attitude as fourteen years earlier.

In the movie &quot;&quot; (2021), Gendo, having injected an object called the Key of Nebuchadnezzar into his body, transcends humanity and enters Eva-13 to initiate the Human Instrumentality Project, and accomplish deicide and Additional Impact, fighting with Eva-01 and Shinji inside it. Unit 01 and Unit 13, defined by Gendo as units of &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;despair&quot; respectively, are tuned and synchronized with each other; Shinji loses the fight and argues with Gendo instead of using force. Gendo speaks to his son, revealing his lonely childhood in which he was fond of the piano and not very sociable until he met his future wife. For a long time, Gendo had a connection with Mari, and at the end of the trial, he resolves his suffering by embracing Shinji and asking him for forgiveness. Eva-01 and Eva-13 inflict themselves with spears, and Gendo and Yui sacrifice themselves to allow their son to continue living, reuniting for one last time.

In the last two chapters of &quot;Rebuild&quot;, Gendo wears different glasses that cover his eye sockets, an idea that came from Mahiro Maeda, who wanted to give the impression Gendo was falling into darkness. Maeda, considering the eyes as the mirror of an individual&#x27;s mind, wanted Gendo to have no human perspective and projected Anno onto Gendo during production, wondering what Anno&#x27;s childhood had been like. Megumi Hayashibara, Rei Ayanami&#x27;s voice actress, said she sometimes recognized Anno in Gendo&#x27;s character and sometimes in Shinji&#x27;s. Anno himself stated he no longer felt as close to Shinji as he once did, identifying more with Gendo. At the beginning of production, assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki instructed mecha designer Ikuto Yamashita to create a scenario in which Gendo and Shinji would clash for eternity, even after losing their bodies.

=== In other media ===

In a scene from the last episode of the animated series, a parallel universe is presented with a different story than the previous episodes; in the alternative reality, Gendo appears as a normal man who is reading a newspaper in a kitchen, and cohabits with Shinji and his wife Yui. According to his newspaper, Antarctica still exists and no accident occurred at the South Pole. A similar version of events occurs in the manga &quot;Shinji Ikari Raising Project&quot;. In the original net parody anime &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School&quot;, Gendo is the principal at a school named Tokyo-3 Municipal academy &quot;Nerv&quot;, attended by Shinji, Asuka, Rei, and the other &quot;Evangelion&quot; characters; he is also portrayed as a less-negative character and as a calm, strict father who act as though he has a crush on Ritsuko but still loves his wife, with whom he has a good relationship.

The manga version, which was written and illustrated by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, introduces more differences in Gendo&#x27;s characterization and development. Sadamoto tried to portray Gendo in a more balanced way compared to Hideaki Anno&#x27;s Gendo; although putting him in a negative light, Sadamoto tried to better explain the reasons for Yui&#x27;s attraction towards him, emphasizing his stubbornness and representing Fuyutsuki as a rebel. In the manga, Gendo leaves his son with his aunt and uncle, whereas in the animated series the identity of the guardian to whom he entrusts Shinji is not revealed. In the anime, Gendo has Adam&#x27;s embryo implanted in the palm of his right hand, whereas in Sadamoto&#x27;s version he swallows it, thus developing the ability to extend an AT Field, a directional force field characteristic of Angels and Evangelion. Unlike the original series, the confrontation with the Angel Bardiel culminates in the death of Toji Suzuhara. Gendo feels no remorse; his attitude arouses the ire of his son, who tries to punch him. He saves Shinji during an attack by the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, telling him he was jealous of him since birth because he suddenly became the center of his wife&#x27;s attention and affection. In the last chapters, he also shoots Dr. Akagi, telling her &quot;I loved you&quot; and is in turn killed by the doctor. Before he dies, he sees Yui again during the Instrumentality, and remembers the moment when he first saw his son; Yui tells him that Shinji is the fruit of their love, and Gendo passes away.

==Characterization==
Gendo Ikari is a mysterious, emotionally closed, austere, determined, calculating, ruthless, and unscrupulous man. His innate pragmatism and his phlegmatic, selfish character, lead him to use any means to achieve his goals, even if it means hurting other people&#x27;s feelings. The only people who seem to understand his thoughts are the vice-commander of the Nerv, Kozo Fuyutsuki, and Dr. Ritsuko Akagi, who shares his philosophy. Gendo flaunts a detached attitude with his subordinates, keeping calm and cool-headed in all circumstances and sticking to his plans. He is confident in his war strategies; to implement them he often takes the place of the United Nations as if he considered it his right, not hesitating to use Shinji and Ayanami. His Japanese voice actor Fumihiko Tachiki, however, stated; &quot;[Gendo] is not just cold or immoral. I don’t know how to articulate it, but I feel that he shows a strength that’s unique to humans.&quot;

To carry out his plans, Gendo uses his subordinate Ryoji Kaji and embarks on a secret affair with Dr. Naoko Akagi, a scientist and researcher, taking advantage of her scientific talents. He does not actually love the woman, since he considers Dr. Akagi a tool for Instrumentality and being able to meet Yui, whom he cannot forget. Naoko, realizing Gendo is exploiting her, commits suicide in 2010, after which he enters into a sexual relationship with her daughter, Ritsuko. Ritsuko also realizes Gendo is using her, saying that from the beginning the man never had any real expectations for her.

Gendo is indifferent to his son&#x27;s life but shows an attachment to Rei, to whom he is closer and more intimate. Gendo constantly devotes himself to the Instrumentality Project following his wife&#x27;s sudden death, trying at all costs to meet her again. In the fifteenth episode of the series, he visits her symbolic tomb with his son, claiming &quot;Yui made me know that something irreplaceable to me&quot;. On other occasions, he shows a human character; during the battle against the Angel Matarael, he helps his men to manually operate the Evangelion units, while shortly after the defeat of the Angel Sahaquiel, he praises Shinji. Gendo disappoints his son&#x27;s expectations during the battle against the Angel Bardiel, in which he has the Evangelion 03 unit destroyed without remorse, wounding and mutilating its pilot Toji Suzuhara, Shinji&#x27;s friend.

According to an encyclopedia named &quot;Evangelion Chronicle&quot;, Gendo&#x27;s behavior can be interpreted as a &quot;reverse manifestation of affection&quot;: not wanting to hurt his son, he turns away from him. A pamphlet for the film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; likens their relationship to Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s porcupine&#x27;s dilemma. Gendo&#x27;s path has its climax during Instrumentality, in which he meets Yui again and asks his son&#x27;s forgiveness just before dying. He is then devoured by Eva-01; according to Yūichirō Oguro, editor of extra materials from the home video editions of the series, the Eva-01 visible in the sequence may be an illusion and the scene may symbolize Gendo&#x27;s success in becoming one with his wife.

===Cultural references and themes===
According to cultural critic Hiroki Azuma, Gendo&#x27;s uniform is an homage to Leiji Matsumoto&#x27;s series &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, while his pose with joined hands has been compared to that of Gargoyle, the antagonist of &quot;Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water&quot;. Gendo&#x27;s motto, &quot;The hands of the clock cannot turn back&quot;, is also similar to a phrase from an earlier Gainax work; &quot;If the overflowed water could be poured out again&quot; from &quot;GunBuster&quot;. Japanese critic Akio Nagatomi compared Gendo to Kōichirō Ōta, also called &quot;Coach&quot;, and his son Shinji to Noriko from &quot;Gunbuster&quot;. Gendo has also been interpreted as a reflection of Shinji and as a representation of paternalism. Critics have interpreted the Nerv as a patriarchal society that is commanded by an austere, dictatorial man who gives unquestionable orders, far from his son. Writer Andrea Fontana compared the series&#x27; theme of Oedipal conflict between fathers and sons to other works in the mecha genre, such as those by director Yoshiyuki Tomino, while Anime News Network&#x27;s Jonny Lobo compared the conflict between Shinji and Gendo to the world presented by the OVA &quot;Megazone 23&quot;, in which parental figures are almost absent; according to him, however, &quot;Megazone&quot; protagonist Shogo Yahagi rebels against the government, the &quot;de facto&quot; enforcer of patriarchy, rather than an individual like Gendo. It is left to the viewer&#x27;s sensibilities to decide whether the series supports or critiques the &quot;machista&quot; masculinity model, attempting to refute the intrinsic value of the patriarchal view.

Gendo&#x27;s egocentricity has been associated by Japanese psychiatrist Kōji Mizobe with a narcissistic personality disorder. Moreover, U.S. writer Susan J. Napier, noting Angels are &quot;explicitly associated&quot; with Gendo throughout the series, has interpreted the enemies as father figures. Hideaki Anno himself described Gendo as a metaphor for the &quot;system&quot; and the limits imposed by society; he intentionally depicted Gendo and the Angels as &quot;amorphous&quot; entities, since society and the concept of the enemy are undefined for him. Writer Mark MacWilliams also described the series as a portrait of childhood loneliness in a broken society where the father is constantly working, comparing this depiction to the Japanese family context and children growing up in the 1990s before the collapse of the speculative bubble.

In a draft of the twenty-fourth episode of the series, which was shelved during production, Kaworu Nagisa&#x27;s character would compare Gendo to Paul, the protagonist of Erich Wolfgang Korngold&#x27;s opera &quot;Die tote Stadt&quot;, a character who locks himself in his home after the death of his wife, building a &quot;Temple of the Past&quot; with her belongings; and later meets a young woman who looks similar to his late wife and falls in love with her. The Nerv base would be a &quot;Temple of the Past&quot; built by Gendo. In the director&#x27;s-cut version of the episode, Seele also links Gendo&#x27;s Instrumentality scenario to the myth of Pandora&#x27;s box, which, as in the ancient Greek myth, Gendo metaphorically opens causing an uncontrollable catastrophe and releasing all of the world&#x27;s evils, with only hope which remains at the bottom of the box.

The series includes Gendo&#x27;s dialogues about religion and the value of science, themes already present in other works by Hideaki Anno. Scholar Mariana Ortega compared Yui to a Madonna nursing Shinji and protecting him from Gendo, whom she associated with the Gnostic figure of the demiurge. For the Japanese critic Kotani Mari, Gendo assumes the connotations of the Supreme Being of Gnosticism, also named Monad. He has also been compared to Satan, Go Nagai&#x27;s &quot;Devilman&quot; antagonist; unlike Seele, who follows a plan based on faith in the Dead Sea Scrolls, Gendo wants to become a God himself, like a fallen angel who rebels against God.

According to the book &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Unofficial Guide&quot;, written by Kazuhisa Fujie and Martin Foster, a different spelling of the word can be translated as &quot;conduct&quot; and &quot;words and behavior&quot;. This detail, together with the name of his son Shinji, which is phonetically similar to the word , &quot;God-man&quot;, a Japanese epithet of Jesus Christ, and that of Rei Ayanami, which in &quot;kanji&quot; can be rendered as , could be linked to the Christian Trinity and to the philosophical concept of &quot;Logos&quot;, which in &quot;Evangelion&quot; seems to become an attribute of God the Father. In such a perspective, Rei represents the Holy Spirit, Shinji God the Son, and Gendo the God the Father, referring to the first verses of the Gospel of John: &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&quot; (John 1:1). Writer Gerald Alva Miller also described Gendo&#x27;s Instrumentality as an attempt to &quot;return to Edenic bliss&quot;.

Throughout the series, Gendo becomes the object of sexual desire for Dr. Naoko Akagi and at the same time for her daughter Ritsuko, in a modern retelling of the Electra complex. In the film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, he shoots his former lover Ritsuko Akagi, telling her, &quot;Dr. Akagi, actually...&quot;. The last part of the line was silently rendered, leaving it to the viewer to imagine the missing words; according to the interpretation of some fans, Gendo says &quot;I need you&quot; or &quot;I needed you&quot;, in reference to &quot;I need you&quot;, the title of the second half of the movie. Further reference to psychoanalysis is detectable in his relationship with Rei Ayanami, to whom Gendo is emotionally close, a clone of his deceased wife, and has a tense relationship with his son. &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; can therefore be seen as a reinterpretation of the Oedipus legend and as a story focused on the Oedipus complex postulated by Sigmund Freud. Anno himself compared &quot;Evangelion&quot; to Ryū Murakami&#x27;s novel &quot;Ai to gensō no fascism&quot;, whose protagonist Toji Suzuhara attempts to kill the Japanese prime minister, whom he finds similar to his father, and rapes his mother, who in the novel is Japan itself. Anno also described &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; as a story in which the Oedipal rivalry between Gendo and his son is resolved in the last episode; the Eva represents a mother figure, while Gendo and the first Angel Adam represent the fathers of a &quot;multi-layered Oedipus complex,&quot; in which Shinji &quot;kills his father&quot; and takes his mother away from him.

==Cultural impact==
===Popularity===
After the conclusion of the series, Gendo emerged as the sixteenth-most-popular male character of the time in the 1996 Anime Grand Prix, a large survey conducted annually by the Japanese magazine &quot;Animage&quot;. The following year he rose to fourteenth place in the same poll, becoming the fourth-most-popular male character in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. In February 1998, the magazine ranked him sixty-fifth among the hundred-most-popular anime characters. Gendo was also ranked in several surveys of the most-attractive anime characters in different categories, as well as in a Goo Ranking survey in which he was elected the third-most-hated father in Japanese animation. The character also appeared in rankings on &quot;Evangelion&quot; most-beloved characters, usually in the top ten.

===Critical reception===
Gendo&#x27;s character has elicited negative opinions from critics and animation fans. The magazine &quot;Wired&quot; named him among the &quot;worst relatives in television series&quot;, calling him &quot;the most monstrous father ever&quot;. THEM Anime Reviews&#x27; Tim Jomes described him as a &quot;creepy&quot;, frightening, &quot;God complex&quot;-plagued, and unpleasant man. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; and writers at Comic Book Resources listed him among the least-likable characters in the series, criticizing his abusive ways. Comic Book Resources&#x27; Jacob Buchalter similarly ranked Gendo as the second-worst character in &quot;shōnen&quot; anime. Zac Bertschy, a reviewer for Anime News Network, criticized the character&#x27;s manipulative, self-centered attitude, calling him a &quot;giant douchebag&quot; and defended his son Shinji, whom he says has been unfairly criticized by fans of being cowardly or wimpy. Bertschy, however, praised his characterization, naming him among the most-memorable antagonists in the history of Japanese animation: &quot;Gendo Ikari is the worst dad ever imagined, and so it logically follows that he is also the most memorable villain. It&#x27;s just science. I don&#x27;t make the rules&quot;. Comic Book Resources&#x27; Michael Iacono similarly named Gendo, for his &quot;diabolical brilliance, all-or-nothing attitude, and deeply flawed character traits&quot;, among the best antagonists in anime history.

Several reviewers have criticized his development. Anime News Network&#x27;s Lynzee Loveridge described Gendo&#x27;s betrayal and actions in the film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; as &quot;shocking&quot;, listing them among eight betrayals that have shocked the audience. &quot;Sci Fi Weekly&quot; Tasha Robinson was disappointed with the series finale, saying it does not fully explore Gendo&#x27;s motivations and abilities. Anime News Network&#x27;s Kenneth Lee also noted Shinji, willing to die during the fight against the Eva-04, has a similar determination to his father Gendo, saying; &quot;it is rather frightening and interesting to see so many possible parallels between the characters&quot;, which &quot;remain inconclusive&quot;, criticizing the series for leaving &quot;a group of suppositions that will never be answered&quot;.

Other reviewers were more appreciative of his role in spin-offs and the manga adaptation of the series. &quot;Kotaku&quot;&#x27;s Richard Eisenbeis appreciated the developments and insights into Gendo&#x27;s past introduced in Sadamoto&#x27;s manga version, which he said are clearer and more interesting than the original series. This view is echoed by Carlos Santos from Anime News Network, who praised the changes in the spin-off comic &quot;The Shinji Ikari Raising Project&quot; which, according to Santos, with its comic moments and less dark-and-twisted backgrounds than the animated series, would offer a more serene and enjoyable image of Gendo as a &quot;hapless, comedic father which is good for a few chuckles&quot;.

Gendo&#x27;s role in &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; also drew criticism and praise. Anime News Network&#x27;s Justin Sevakis praised the film&#x27;s opening scene, in which he visits Yui&#x27;s grave with Shinji, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s a warmness here, a feeling of great affection that wasn&#x27;t so prevalent in the original [series]&quot;. Conversely, Comic Book Resources&#x27;s Angelo Delos Trinos negatively received Gendo&#x27;s role in &quot;Rebuild&quot;, deeming the character too powerful. &quot;Anime Reign&quot; magazine criticized Gendo&#x27;s new role in &quot;Evangelion 3.0&quot; as underdeveloped and shadowy. A diametrically opposite opinion was expressed by Nicole MacLean of THEM Anime Reviews; Browne stated she greatly appreciated the dynamism of the fight between Gendo&#x27;s &quot;egotistical genius&quot; and his former Wille subordinates, which &quot;suits this franchise perfectly&quot;.

Other reviewers have praised Gendo&#x27;s role in the last installment of the saga, &quot;&quot;, in which his motivations and psychology, and his relationship with Shinji are analyzed. Vulture.com wrote; &quot;To longtime &quot;Eva&quot; fans, Gendo explaining himself feels monumental&quot;. Anime News Network&#x27;s Richard Eisenbeis wrote; &quot;&quot;Thrice Upon a Time&quot; makes great strides in expanding and developing his character&quot;. Eisenbeis also described its focus on Gendo as &quot;the most important element of the film ... Even if you still hate Gendo by the end of this exploration, it&#x27;s hard not to empathize with him&quot;. Reviewers lauded the film for giving the character more depth, and the conflict with Shinji has a central part in the plot&#x27;s development. According to IGN&#x27;s Devin Meenan, &quot;Rebuild&quot; brings a closure to the character &quot;that the original lacked&quot;. Thrillist&#x27;s Kambole Campbell described the emotional openness of Gendo and the other characters as &quot;moving&quot;, while &quot;IndieWire&quot; lauded the fact the father-son dynamic is a central part of the story, culminating in &quot;some of the most emotionally raw moments &quot;Evangelion&quot; has ever put on screen&quot;.

===Merchandise and legacy===
Gendo has been used to produce merchandising items, such as sunglasses and eyeglasses, collectible models, shirts, and culinary products. Gendo has appeared in video games and spin-offs based on the original animated series, and in media unrelated to the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; franchise, such as in the &quot;Million Arthur&quot; video games, &quot;Monster Strike&quot;, and &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;. The character was used for campaigns of Japan Racing Association and for advertisements of the Schick razor company, a collaboration that attracted the attention of animation fans and was renewed years after the first advertising video. In 2011, he also inspired an attraction at the Japanese amusement park Fuji-Q Highland.

In 2015, Gendo was used along with other characters from the series for features on the 500 &quot;Type Eva&quot;, a high-speed train dedicated to &quot;Evangelion&quot;. Famous people, including Minoru Takashita, president of the AnimeJapan company; Takashi Kawamura, mayor of Nagoya; and economist Takkaki Mitsuhashi, who founded a Cosplay Party for the 2010 Japanese House of Councillors election, have paid homage to Gendo by cosplaying as him. Gendo has also inspired the pose of a character that appears in the opening sequence of the video game &quot;Evil Factory&quot;, developed by Neople.

According to &quot;Vice&quot;&#x27;s Ricardo Contreras, Gendo&#x27;s image and austere face have achieved notoriety and have reached non-animation-fan audiences, becoming &quot;one of the most easily recognizable images of anime on the internet&quot;. On the web, Gendo is often associated with the phrase; &quot;Get in the fucking robot, Shinji&quot;, which has also gone viral. The phrase has become an internet meme and has been used for merchandise items dedicated to the series. Screen Rant&#x27;s Adam Beach noted Ragyō Kiryūin&#x27;s office in &quot;Kill la Kill&quot; is similar to Gendo&#x27;s. Bleeding Cool similarly interpreted a line by Quentin Quire from &quot;X-Men&quot; comic as a reference to the &quot;Get in the robot&quot; meme. Holland Novak from &quot;Eureka Seven&quot; has also been compared with Gendo. Fans have renamed his characteristic pose, with his hands joined at face height, the &quot;Gendo pose&quot;, which has been copied, homaged, and parodied in other animated series, such as Taizo Haisegawa in &quot;Gintama&quot;, which is also voiced by Fumihiko Tachiki, &quot;&quot;, by Stella in &quot;Rose Guns Days&quot;, by Nifuji Hirotaka in &quot;&quot;, and by Hayato in an official crossover episode between &quot;Evangelion&quot; and &quot;Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion&quot;.

<doc id="600201" wikidata="Q469797" url="?curid=600201" title="Piet Joubert">
<text>Petrus Jacobus Joubert (20 January 1831 – 28 March 1900), better known as Piet Joubert (&quot;Slim Piet&quot;, Smart Pete), was a South African politician who served as the commandant–general of the South African Republic from 1880 to 1900. He also served as Vice-President to Paul Kruger from May 1883 to October 1884 and from May 1896 until his death. He served in First Boer War, Second Boer War, and the Malaboch War.

==Early life==
Joubert was born in the district of Prince Albert, British Cape Colony, a descendant of a French Huguenot who fled to South Africa soon after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV. Left an orphan at an early age, Joubert migrated to the Transvaal, where he settled in the Wakkerstroom district near Laing&#x27;s Nek and the north-east corner of the Colony of Natal. There he not only farmed with great success, but turned his attention to the study of the law.

==Political career==
The esteem in which his shrewdness in both farming and legal affairs was held led to his election to the Volksraad as member for Wakkerstroom early in the sixties, Marthinus Pretorius being then in his second term of office as president. In 1870 Joubert was again elected, and the use to which he put his slender stock of legal knowledge secured him the appointment of attorney-general of the republic. In 1875 he acted as president during the absence of T. F. Burgers in Europe. He served as the Chairman of Volksraad from 1873 on. 

==First Boer War==
During the first British annexation of the Transvaal, Joubert earned for himself the reputation of a consistent irreconcilable by refusing to hold office under the government, as Paul Kruger and other prominent Boers were doing. Instead of accepting the lucrative post offered him, he took a leading part in creating and directing the agitation which led to the First Boer War (1880–1881), eventually becoming, as commandant-general of the Boer forces, a member of the triumvirate that administered the provisional Boer government set up in December 1880 at Heidelberg.

He was in command of the Boer forces at Laings Nek, Ingogo, and Majuba Hill, subsequently conducting the earlier peace negotiations that led to the conclusion of the Pretoria Convention.

==Later political career==
In 1883 he was a candidate in the Transvaal presidential election, but received only 1,171 votes as against 3,431 cast for Kruger. After losing to Kruger again in the 1888 elections, he ran against Kruger for a third time in the 1893 elections, standing as the representative of the comparatively progressive section of the Boers, who wished in some measure to redress the grievances of the Uitlander population which had grown up on the Rand. The poll (though there is good reason for believing that the voting lists had been manipulated by Kruger&#x27;s agents) was declared to have resulted in 7911 votes being cast for Kruger and 7246 for Joubert. After a protest Joubert acquiesced to Kruger&#x27;s continued presidency.

He stood again in 1898, but the Jameson raid had occurred meantime and the voting was 12,858 for Kruger and 2,001 for Joubert. Joubert&#x27;s position had then become much weakened by accusations of treachery and of sympathy with the Uitlander agitation. He was a South African Freemason.

He was elected twice as the Vice President, first time in May 1883. However, he resigned in October 1884 due to differences with Paul Kruger with respect to the policy in British Bechuanaland. Joubert was elected second time as Vice President after the death of Nicolaas Smit in May 1896 and he served until his own death on 28 March 1900.

==Second Boer War==
He took little part in the negotiations that culminated in the ultimatum sent to Great Britain by Kruger in 1899, and though he immediately assumed nominal command of the operations on the outbreak of hostilities, he gave up to others the chief share in the direction of the war, through his inability or neglect to impose upon them his own will. His cautious nature, which had in early life gained him the sobriquet of &quot;Slim Piet&quot; (Clever Piet), joined to a lack of determination and assertiveness that characterized his whole career, led him to act mainly on the defensive; and the strategically offensive movements of the Boer forces, such as Elandslaagte and Willow Grange, appear to have been neither planned nor executed by him.

===Death===
On 28 November 1899, during a raid south of the Tugela river in Natal, Joubert was thrown from his horse and suffered internal injuries. As the war went on, physical weakness led to Joubert&#x27;s virtual retirement, and, though two days earlier he was still reported as being in supreme command, he died at Pretoria from peritonitis on 28 March 1900. Sir George White, the defender of Ladysmith, summed up Jouberts character when he called him &quot;a soldier and a gentleman, and a brave and honourable opponent&quot;.

==Honours==
The town of Pietersburg (now named Polokwane) in the northern region of the then Transvaal Republic (current Limpopo province) was named after Piet Joubert. Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem upon his death, &quot;Piet Joubert&quot;, wherein he absolved him from complicity in instigating the war, and held his colleagues to account (excerpt):

&lt;poem&gt;With those that bred, with those that loosed the strife,
 He had no part whose hands were clear of gain;
But subtle, strong, and stubborn, gave his life
 To a lost cause, and knew the gift was vain.&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="600204" wikidata="Q7322515" url="?curid=600204" title="Ricardian (Richard III)">
<text>Ricardians are people who dispute the negative posthumous reputation of King Richard III of England (reigned 1483–1485). Richard III has long been portrayed unfavourably, most notably in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot;, in which he is portrayed as murdering his 12-year-old nephew Edward V to secure the English throne for himself. Ricardians believe these portrayals are false and politically motivated by Tudor propaganda.

==Beliefs==
Ricardians accept as facts: that first the young king Edward V was placed under the protection of his uncle Richard III; that Richard III himself was then crowned as the new king instead of young Edward V; and finally that the young king disappeared at some point over the coming years, never to be seen again. However, they dispute the initial common assumption by many, that Richard III was personally responsible for the disappearance (or perhaps murder) of Edward V.

Richard III&#x27;s reign lasted for only two years, and his short reign came to a violent end on 22 August 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth; the last battle of the War of the Roses. In the aftermath of the battle, Richard III&#x27;s body was not given a proper state funeral, and the location of his remains was soon forgotten; there was even a belief, now proved false, that they had been thrown into the River Soar in Leicester following the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Ricardians assert that many of the original assumptions about Richard III&#x27;s motives and likely responsibility relating to these events were not supported by the facts of the day, that these assumptions were most probably instead the result of the political claims of his successors, and that they were most probably mistaken assumptions.

The two most notable societies of Ricardians are the Richard III Society, and the Richard III Foundation, Inc. A third much smaller Ricardian organisation, composed of &quot;collateral descendants&quot; of Richard III, was the Plantagenet Alliance. In 2012, the Richard III Society was instrumental in leading an archaeological effort to positively locate and identify the long-lost remains of Richard III, which resulted in the discovery and retrieval of the remains from beneath a Leicester car park. Subsequently, much popular historical interest was generated in this historical period. Such historical interest resulted in the review and publication of many articles and documents regarding Richard&#x27;s reign, which have contributed to the scholarship of latter 15th-century England. After their discovery, Richard III&#x27;s remains were first scientifically evaluated, then formally re-interred within the interior of Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015. Their re-interment occurred amidst days of solemn ceremonies and pageantry.

===Notable Ricardians===

Ricardian historiography includes works by Horace Walpole and by Sir George Buck, who was the king&#x27;s first defender, after the Tudor period.

Ricardian fiction includes Josephine Tey&#x27;s &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot; and Sharon Kay Penman&#x27;s &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot;. Elizabeth George writes of the fictional discovery of an exonerating document in her short story &quot;I Richard&quot;. Science fiction writer Andre Norton, in the 1965 novel &quot;Quest Crosstime&quot;, depicted an alternate history in which Richard III won at Bosworth and turned out to be one of England&#x27;s greatest kings, &quot;achieving the brilliance of the Elizabethan era two generations earlier&quot;.

Other notable Ricardians include:
* Laurence Olivier, actor

==Richard III Society==
The Richard III Society was founded in 1924 by Liverpool surgeon Samuel Saxon Barton (1892-1957) as The Fellowship of the White Boar, Richard&#x27;s badge and a symbol of the Yorkist army in the Wars of the Roses. Its membership was originally a small group of interested amateur historians whose aim was to bring about a re-assessment of the reputation of Richard III.

The society became moribund during the Second World War. In 1951, Josephine Tey published her detective novel &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot;, in which Richard&#x27;s guilt is examined and doubted. In 1955, Laurence Olivier released his film of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;, which at the beginning admitted that the play was based on legend, and a sympathetic, detailed biography of Richard was published by Paul Murray Kendall, all of which went some way towards re-invigorating the society.

The Fellowship of the White Boar was renamed The Richard III Society in 1959.

In 2012, the society, working in partnership with the University of Leicester and Leicester City Council, exhumed a skeleton at the site of the former Greyfriars Church that was later confirmed to be that of the King.

Philippa Langley, the secretary of the Scottish Branch of the Richard III Society, inaugurated the quest for King Richard&#x27;s lost grave as part of her ongoing research into the controversial monarch. Her project marked the first-ever search for the grave of an anointed King of England. For their role in the exhumation, Langley and John Ashdown-Hill were awarded the MBEs in recognition of their services to &quot;the Exhumation and Identification of Richard III&quot; (&quot;London Gazette&quot;) in the 2015 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

==The Richard III Foundation, Inc.==
The Foundation is a US educational organization. The aims of the Foundation are to study, share and stimulate interest in the life and times of King Richard III and the Wars of the Roses.

Its website states, &quot;The Foundation seeks to challenge the popular view of King Richard III by demonstrating through rigorous scholarship that the facts of Richard’s life and reign are in stark contrast to the Shakespearian caricature.&quot;

Their aim is to identify and translate documents and texts that shed new insight into this important period of history.

==Plantagenet Alliance==
The Plantagenet Alliance was a grouping of 15 individuals who claimed to be &quot;collateral [non-direct] descendants&quot; of Richard III, and have been described as a &quot;Ricardian fan club&quot;. The group, formed for the purpose, unsuccessfully campaigned during 2013 and 2014 to have Richard re-interred at York Minster rather than Leicester Cathedral, believing that that was his wish. During the campaign, the group failed to attract enough support to petition parliament.

<text>Kalifornia is a 1993 American road thriller film directed by Dominic Sena, in his feature film directorial debut. It stars Brad Pitt, Juliette Lewis, David Duchovny, and Michelle Forbes. The film tells the story of a journalist (Duchovny) and his photographer girlfriend (Forbes) traveling cross-country to research serial killings, who unwittingly carpool with a psychopath (Pitt) and his childlike girlfriend (Lewis).

Filmed in Georgia and rural inland California in the spring of 1992, &quot;Kalifornia&quot; premiered at the Montreal World Film Festival on August 27, 1993, where it was awarded two competition prizes. It was released theatrically the following week in the United States, but was a box office bomb, grossing $2.4 million against a nearly $9 million budget. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its art house sensibility, while others dismissed it as a violent exploitation film. Despite this, the film&#x27;s acting was largely praised, and critic Roger Ebert heralded the performances of Pitt and Lewis among the best he had ever seen. The film was nominated for three Saturn Awards in 1994, including for Best Horror Film.

==Plot==
Brian Kessler is a graduate student and journalist whose article about serial killers has gotten him an offer for a book deal. He and his girlfriend Carrie Laughlin, an avant garde photographer, decide to relocate to California in hopes of enriching their careers. The two plot their journey from Louisville, Kentucky, to Los Angeles, planning to visit infamous murder sites along the way which Carrie can photograph for Brian&#x27;s book. Short on funds, Brian posts a ride-share ad on the university campus.

Meanwhile, psychopathic parolee Early Grayce has just lost his job. His parole officer learns of this and comes to the trailer park where Early lives with his naïve girlfriend Adele Corners. Early refuses the officer&#x27;s offer of a job as a janitor at the university, saying he wants to leave the state, but the officer pressures him into keeping his appointment for the job interview. When Early arrives at the campus, he sees the ride-share ad and calls Brian, who agrees to meet him the following day. Early sends Adele ahead, then murders his landlord before joining her to wait for Brian and Carrie. Carrie is reluctant about riding with the couple given their rough appearance, but Brian encourages her to give them a chance. On the road, unbeknown to his companions, Early murders a man in a gas station bathroom and steals his money. When they arrive at their first hotel, Early cuts Adele&#x27;s long hair shorter to try to match Carrie&#x27;s.

At another hotel, Early invites Brian out to play pool, leaving Adele and Carrie alone together. Adele explains that her mother did not approve of her relationship because Early had just been released from prison. She reveals to Carrie that she suffered a vicious gang rape and that she views Early as her protector, even though he sometimes &quot;punishes&quot; her. While the two women drink beer, Adele also admits that Early forbids her to smoke or drink. Meanwhile, at a local bar, Early assaults a man who confronts Brian. Later during the road-trip, Early introduces Brian to pistol shooting in a remote, unnamed location.

Carrie is alarmed by Brian&#x27;s growing fascination with Early, and by Brian&#x27;s nonchalant response to the news that Early is a convicted felon. After catching Early and Adele having sex in the car, she gives Brian an ultimatum: either they rid themselves of the pair, or she will leave. At a desert gas station, Carrie glimpses a news report about Early being a suspected murderer. Early kills the gas station attendant in front of Carrie and continues the trip with the couple as hostages. At an abandoned mine camp, the party encounter two police officers whom Early shoots and kills. They next come to the home of an elderly couple in the desert. Early beats the man to death, but Adele allows the woman to flee.

When Early confronts Adele about freeing the woman, she hits him in the face with a cactus and chastises him, after which he shoots her to death. He then knocks Brian unconscious before kidnapping Carrie, driving her to the abandoned Dreamland nuclear testing site on the California-Nevada border. Early forces Carrie to dress in Adele&#x27;s clothes, and the film implies that he rapes her off-camera. Brian regains consciousness, and the elderly woman gives him the keys to her truck. He follows Early to the test site and attacks him, hitting him in the face with a shovel. Brian finds Carrie, who appears to be in shock, handcuffed to a bed in an abandoned house. Early, who was only stunned, attacks Brian and they struggle. Early is hit over the head by Carrie with the limb from a nuclear test mannequin. When he continues the attack, Brian shoots and kills him.

Some time later, Brian and Carrie are living in an oceanfront house in Malibu. As Brian sifts through tapes made with his voice recorder during their trip, Carrie tells him that a gallery in Venice is interested in her art. Brian responds by suggesting they go out to celebrate. As they depart, Brian unintentionally leaves a recording running, which reveals a &quot;thank you&quot; message Adele covertly left at the end of a tape.

==Cast==
==Critical analysis==
In &quot;Lost Highways: An Illustrated History of Road Movies&quot; writers Jack Sargeant and Stephanie Watson note that the film presents doubled images of the two couples, &quot;contrary rituals of affirmation&quot; between Early and Adele, and Brian and Carrie, which demonstrate their social and class-related disparities. Sargeant and Watson also interpret the character of Carrie as an androgyne that &quot;offers a threat to order&quot; in the dynamics among Early, Adele, and Brian.

Film scholar Charles Derry views &quot;Kalifornia&quot; as part of a historical trend of serial killer films released in the early 1990s, popularized by the success of Jonathan Demme&#x27;s &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991).

==Production==
===Conception===
Originally titled &quot;California&quot;, the script was written by Tim Metcalfe with Stephen Levy in 1987. Metcalfe later commented their intentions were &quot;to scare an audience, to comment on our national obsession with &#x27;true crime&#x27; stories, and to punish myself for my morbid preoccupation with the subject of murder and murderers.&quot; The script was optioned in November 1990 by Propaganda Films, by request of director Dominic Sena. Sena would go on to mention his positive impression on the script was mainly based on the premise and the character of Early Grayce.

Between November 1990 and March 1991, Metcalfe completed two rewrites of the script to implement changes requested by Sena and Propaganda Films. The characters of Brian and Carrie were given professions as a writer and a photographer, respectively, while retaining the original premise to share a ride with a serial killer. Metcalfe disagreed on the direction the script was being developed, while Sena and the producers found his rewrites &quot;uninspiring&quot;. In March 1991, Metcalfe was fired from the project.

Without the budget to hire another writer, Sena, along with his two producers, spent another year writing ten subsequent drafts of the script. Their contributions included the voice-over narration of the character of Brian, along with a change of tone from a black comedy to a more violent thriller. Sena maintained the rewrites helped them to secure the cast, as well as an increase to the originally proposed budget of $4.5 million.

===Casting===
Brad Pitt was cast as the violent Early Grayce, as he had been seeking out a role that was at odds with the wholesome &quot;pretty boy&quot; image he had portrayed in &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; (1991) and &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; (1992). Juliette Lewis was cast in the role while still completing production on Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1991), and had been in a relationship with Pitt at the time. In the role of Carrie, Michelle Forbes was cast after she completed an audition in Los Angeles, as Sena felt she possessed the cool aloofness of the character. The role of Brian Kessler was the last to be cast, with David Duchovny ultimately receiving the role after several screen tests with Pitt, Lewis, and Forbes.

===Filming===
Filming of &quot;Kalifornia&quot; began in the late spring of 1992. Some of the film&#x27;s early scenes were shot in an old industrial area west of downtown Atlanta and in the Castleberry Hill neighborhood, after which the production moved westward through various locations in California. On June 28, 1992, while filming at a gas station in rural California, the production was temporarily halted following a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.

Sena recalled the shoot being extremely difficult, with the shooting schedule sometimes allowing only one day in certain locations. According to Sena, throughout the production, Pitt and Lewis, who were a couple at the time, would go home and work on lines together during the evenings. Producer Steve Golin recounted during the shoot that &quot;all four of [the main cast] have been so pro, I&#x27;ve been impressed. They have been working ridiculous hours under conditions that are not star-like. The hotels in the desert are not luxurious; they get a room with a swamp cooler, they don&#x27;t even have air conditioning. It&#x27;s a rough show.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
A soundtrack CD for the film was released by Polydor Records on August 3, 1993.

Additional songs
Other songs featured in the film that are not included on the soundtrack include &quot;89 Lines&quot; by Daniel O&#x27;Brien, &quot;Seven Days&quot; by Hugh Harris, &quot;Playin&#x27; in the Dirt&quot; by Heather Myles, &quot;Strong Enough&quot; by Sheryl Crow, &quot;Come Home&quot; by Pere Ubu, &quot;(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66&quot; by Asleep at the Wheel, &quot;Symphony No. 8 in F Major Op. 93&quot; by Ludwig van Beethoven and Brad Pitt partially singing part of Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

==Release==
===Box office===
After premiering at the Montreal World Film Festival in August 1993, &quot;Kalifornia&quot; was released theatrically in the United States on September 3, 1993 at 359 theaters. The film was a box office bomb, only grossing $2,395,231 against an $8.5 million budget. The film opened at number 17 at the U.S. box office during its opening weekend with a $1.1 million gross, averaging $3,228 per theater.

===Critical response===

&quot;Kalifornia&quot; received generally mixed reviews. It holds a 59% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an average score of 6.2/10, sampled from 32 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Visually strong and featuring a potently feral performance from Brad Pitt, &quot;Kalifornia&quot; is a tonally uneven thriller marked by all-too-obvious themes&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 49 out of 100, determined from 17 critics&#x27; reviews, signifying &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Film scholar Robert Cettl noted in his book &quot;Serial Killer Cinema&quot; that, upon its release, &quot;&quot;Kalifornia&quot; was both praised as an insightful demystification of the serial killer, and vilified as a glorification of nihilistic violence.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; lauded the film, awarding it a full four stars and describing it as &quot;unflinchingly honest, and so well acted that for most of the film I abandoned any detachment and just watched it as if I were observing the lives of real people.&quot; Ebert went on to note that Pitt and Lewis give &quot;two of the most harrowing and convincing performances I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; also praised the performances of the lead cast and likened the film to Charles Laughton&#x27;s &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; (1955), deeming it &quot;an extremely handsome production imbued with a chilling, surrealistic sensibility.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;an exercise in contrasting personalities, with Ms. Lewis&#x27;s Adele by far the most arresting,&quot; but added that the film &quot;is indeed good-looking, with its striking desert landscapes nicely photographed by Bojan Bazelli, and with costumes by Kelle Kutsugaras that say everything -- and more -- about the people who wear them. If looks were everything, maybe they&#x27;d be on the right track.&quot;

Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; heralded the film&#x27;s aesthetic elements, writing that it &quot;is so beautifully filmed by Bojan Bazelli, and so skillfully edited, that its art house surface belies its exploitation content, making this a trip through a cool world rather than a cruel one.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Gene Siskel echoed a similar sentiment regarding the relationship between the film&#x27;s artistic merit and its representation of violence, noting: &quot;[&quot;Kalifornia&quot; is] yet another terribly violent film about a serial killer. And although the script suffers from an ending that doesn&#x27;t have that much to say that&#x27;s fresh about remorseless murderers, the trip is worth taking because we meet four indelible characters in one compelling scene after another.&quot; Joe Brown of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was dismissive of the film on the grounds of its violent material, deeming it a &quot;new nadir in nauseating nihilism&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kenneth Turan noted that though the film is visually &quot;slick and stylish&quot;, it &quot;doesn&#x27;t make the encroaching mayhem any easier to take,&quot; and felt that the performances of Pitt and Lewis registered as &quot;mannered and even a trifle repetitive&quot;.

Some critics, such as Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, felt certain elements of the script were &quot;preposterous&quot;, while the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Mark Caro deemed it a &quot;pretentious B movie&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; made similar criticisms, writing that, &quot;from its inception, &quot;Kalifornia&quot;...  throws all dramatic sense out the window,&quot; and ultimately described it as a &quot;a film-school thesis gone disastrously wrong.&quot; Owen McNally of the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;, though praising of the performances, wrote: &quot;If you hop aboard this sick, unjoyful ride, you&#x27;d better bail out early. Unsafe at any speed, this dramatic vehicle goes up in flames, consumed by a lethally defective mix of pomposity and pretension.&quot;

===Home media===
PolyGram Home Video first released &quot;Kalifornia&quot; on VHS and DVD on November 18, 1997. The DVD edition featured both unrated and theatrical cuts of the film in pan and scan and widescreen aspect ratios. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Home Entertainment released the film again on DVD in 2000 before reissuing the unrated cut alone on Blu-ray and DVD in August 2010. On March 5, 2019, Shout! Factory released a 2-disc special edition Blu-ray of the film under their Shout! Select label, featuring both the unrated and theatrical cuts, as well as a new interview with director Dominic Sena. This edition marks the first time the theatrical cut has been made available on Blu-ray. Additionally, an unrated version of the film was also released on LaserDisc in widescreen format.

==Accolades==
==Related works==
Following the completion of the film, DC Comics commissioned a comic book adaptation from writer Chuck Dixon and artist Duncan Fegredo. Fegredo recalled the 32-page adaptation was planned to be released as a supplementary for the film&#x27;s video release. The adaptation was never published, though it got as far as the completion of some coloring work done by Danny Vozzo. Fegredo has speculated this was due to the demise of Gramercy Pictures, a production company involved handling the rights. An uncolored version, complete with Fegredo&#x27;s original cover art, has since been uploaded to the Internet.

<doc id="600210" wikidata="Q2037188" url="?curid=600210" title="Otonabee River">
<text>The Otonabee River is a river in Peterborough County in Central Ontario, Canada. The river flows from Katchewanooka Lake, at the north end of the community of Lakefield, through the city of Peterborough to Rice Lake. It is in the Great Lakes Basin and forms part of the Trent-Severn Waterway.

==Etymology==
The river is called &quot;Odoonabii-ziibi&quot; in the Ojibwe language. Otonabee comes from the words &quot;ode&quot; which means &quot;heart&quot; and &quot;odemgat&quot; that comes from &quot;boiling water&quot;. It translates into &quot;the river that beats like a heart in reference to the bubbling and boiling water of the rapids along the river&quot;.

==Course==
The river begins at Katchewanooka Lake on the north side of the community of Lakefield in the municipality of Selwyn, and flows south over the Lakefield (Trent-Severn lock 6) dams and locks. After leaving the community to the Peterborough city limits, the river forms the border between Selwyn and the municipality of Douro–Dummer. The river continues south, passing through the dams associated with four more locks, enters the city of Peterborough, and passes under Faryon Bridge at Trent University. Just south of the university, the Trent-Severn departs via a south-bound canal to the Peterborough Lift Lock east of the river, while the river continues south to the west. It passes over several hydroelectricity dams and generating stations, and passes into the centre of the city of Peterborough, as close as to downtown, as it reaches Little Lake. The Trent-Severn waterway rejoins the river there, exiting from Ashburnham Lock. The river leaves Little Lake at Scotts Mills lock &amp; dam, and heads south, passes under Ontario Highway 7, passes into the municipality of Otonabee–South Monaghan, and snakes its way without any other locks or dams to reach its mouth at Rice Lake, which flows via the Trent River to Lake Ontario.

The total length of the river is , and the distance from Little Lake to Rice Lake about . The drainage basin, not including Katchewanooka Lake or other lakes further upstream, is .

==Hydrology==
Some areas of Peterborough along the Otonabee are prone to flooding following heavy rains, such as happened on July 15, 2004 when 240 mm (7.3 in) fell in some locations in under twenty-four hours.

==History==
Both Susanna Moodie and Catharine Parr Traill lived on farms near Katchewanooka Lake.

==Economy==
Trent University operates its own hydroelectric plant on the river.

==Islands==
Cow Island is located to the west of the mouth of the Otonabee River.

<doc id="600211" wikidata="Q1800890" url="?curid=600211" title="Chemong Lake">
<text>Chemong Lake, or Lake Chemong, (pronounced &quot;shi-MONG, from the Anisnaabemowin gchi-maang, meaning &quot;big lake&quot;)&quot; is a lake northwest of Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, near the town of Bridgenorth. The lake extends from near Fowlers Corners north to near Curve Lake. Lake Chemong has a length of and a width of .

Chemong is also a part of the Kawartha lakes water system and the Trent-Severn Waterway.

==Geography==
===Communities===
Communities along and near the lakeshore include Bridgenorth, Selwyn on the east, and Ennismore on the west.

There is a causeway which crosses the lake, connecting Bridgenorth and Ennismore by road. This causeway is called the James A. Gifford Causeway.

===Tri-lake water system===
Chemong Lake is part of a tri-lake water system consisting of Chemong Lake, Buckhorn Lake, and Pigeon Lake. The tri-lake area is host to several popular fishing tournaments throughout the open fishing season. The most common game fish in the lake are smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, walleye, yellow perch, Carp, Muskellunge as well as a number of Panfish. Commercial and recreational fishing has caused the introduction of Zebra mussels, which change the ecosystem by filtering the water and making it clearer. Some fish, such as Walleye, dislike the clear water and have become less abundant.

===Lake islands===
There are a number of small islands on the lake, including Big Island, Goat Island and Kelly Island. Most of the islands have cottages or are commonly used as impromptu campsites. Rocky shoals surround these islands - boaters should approach with care.

==Name history==
The earliest map, from 1790, called the lake &quot;Wubscommoug&quot;, which was also spelled &quot;Wabuskummug&quot;, an Ojibwa word meaning &quot;place of clay earth&quot; or mud. Over the next century the name went through many changes and spelling variations, such as Shebaugh-tick-wyong/Shebaugh-tick-wayong East Lake (1816), Cimung/Cheemaun/Chemong/Shemong, and Cicibatigweyong. In the 19th century, Mud Lake was the official name, referring to the clay mud bottom of the lake.

By 1902, the name Chemung Lake became the common name, and on October 14, 1965, this became the official name. Despite the official designation, it was often spelled with an &quot;o&quot; instead of an &quot;u&quot;. But in 1978, Chemung Lake was officially changed to Chemong Lake by the Ontario 
Geographic Names Board.

The lake was called Chemong, which is an Ojibwa word meaning &quot;canoe&quot;, because when Europeans first approached the aboriginal village by canoe, the locals would shout &quot;Chemong, Chemong&quot;.

<doc id="600214" wikidata="Q4383488" url="?curid=600214" title="Thomas Lord Cromwell">
<text>Thomas Lord Cromwell is an Elizabethan history play, depicting the life of Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, the minister of King Henry VIII of England.

The play was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 11 August 1602 by William Cotton and was published in quarto later the same year by bookseller William Jones, for whom it was printed by Richard Read. The title page of Q1 specifies that the play was acted by The Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, and attributes the play to a &quot;W. S.&quot; A second quarto (Q2) was printed in 1613 by Thomas Snodham. The Q2 title page repeats the data of Q1, though the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men are now the King&#x27;s Men (the name change having occurred in 1603).

The &quot;W. S.&quot; of the quartos was first identified as William Shakespeare when publisher Philip Chetwinde added the play to the second impression of his Shakespeare Third Folio in 1664. Modern scholars reject the Shakespearean attribution; speculation, relying on common initials, has shone on Wentworth Smith and William Sly as possible alternatives. Individual critics have also suggested Thomas Heywood and Michael Drayton as possible authors—suggestions unsupported by firm evidence.

Indeed, scholars have disagreed about almost every aspect of the play; it has been dated as early as 1582–83 and as late as 1599–1600. The play is primarily political commentary—or religious propaganda. Baldwin Maxwell argued that the play has a discontinuous nature: the first half, through Act III scene ii, is dramaturgically well-crafted, while the second half is disorganized and loosely put together. Maxwell interpreted this as indicating that the extant text was the telescoped condensation of a two-part original; alternatively, others have suggested that the play is a collaboration between two unequal partners, or a work that was left incomplete by its original creator and finished by another hand.

==In Performance==

In 2020, the Beyond Shakespeare Company released online a play-reading and discussion of &quot;The Life and Death of Thomas Cromwell&quot;.

<text>The &#x27;Burbs is a 1989 American black comedy film directed by Joe Dante, and starring Tom Hanks, Bruce Dern, Carrie Fisher, Rick Ducommun, Corey Feldman, Wendy Schaal, Henry Gibson, and Gale Gordon. The film was written by Dana Olsen, who made a cameo appearance in the film.

The film pokes fun at suburban environments and their sometimes eccentric dwellers, featuring a family man who suspects the &quot;eccentric&quot; new neighbors are hiding a dark secret. A modest financial success which earned mixed critical reviews, the film is now regarded as a cult classic.

==Plot==
Suburban homeowner Ray Peterson is home on a week-long vacation. Late one night, he hears strange noises coming from the basement of his new and reclusive neighbors, the Klopeks. Ray and his other neighbors—nosy Art Weingartner, Vietnam War veteran Mark Rumsfield and teenager Ricky Butler—gradually suspect the Klopeks may be ritualistic murderers. On another night, they observe the youngest Klopek cart an oversized garbage bag to their curbside garbage can and aggressively mash it down. Later that night, during a rainstorm, Ray sees the Klopeks digging in their backyard. In the morning, Ray, Mark, and Art search the garbage truck for human remains after the Klopeks&#x27; trash is collected, but find nothing.

Mark&#x27;s wife Bonnie finds their neighbor Walter&#x27;s dog Queenie running loose. Worried about the elderly man, Ray, Art, Ricky, and the Rumsfields enter Walter&#x27;s house and find overturned chairs and Walter&#x27;s toupée, but no Walter. Ray collects Queenie, leaves a note for Walter, slips the toupée back in through the mail slot, and sees one of the Klopeks watching him from their house. Ray and Art theorize that the Klopeks may have used Walter as a human sacrifice, becoming further convinced when Ray&#x27;s dog Vince digs up a human femur from along the Klopeks&#x27; fence line. Ray&#x27;s wife Carol, tired of the men&#x27;s behavior, organizes a welcome visit to the Klopeks. While the Petersons and Rumsfields meet Hans, Reuben, and Dr. Werner Klopek, Art snoops around the Klopeks&#x27; backyard and is chased out by their large dog Landrue. Afterward, Ray reveals to Art and Mark that he found Walter&#x27;s mail and toupée at the Klopeks&#x27;, proving they had been in Walter&#x27;s house.

The next day, Ray sends Carol and their son Dave to visit Carol&#x27;s sister. When the Klopeks leave, Art and Ray enter their backyard to search for Walter&#x27;s corpse while Mark acts as lookout. Finding nothing in the yard, Art and Ray break into the Klopeks&#x27; basement, discover what appears to be a crematorium, and dig deep into the floor in search of human remains. The Klopeks return, accompanied by the police after having seen their basement lights on. Ray strikes a gas line with his pickaxe; Art escapes before the house explodes, and Ray emerges from the flames scorched and disheveled just as Carol returns home.

Walter arrives home during the commotion, having spent a few days in the hospital due to palpitations. He had asked the Klopeks to collect his mail for him, and they had mistakenly gathered up his toupée as well. Ray declares that he and the others were wrong about the Klopeks, and climbs into an ambulance. Werner enters and accuses Ray of having seen a human skull in the basement furnace, revealing that the Klopeks murdered the previous homeowners so they could live in their house. Werner attempts to lethally inject Ray as Hans drives the ambulance away. Their struggle causes the ambulance to crash into Art&#x27;s house, ejecting Werner and Ray, who then makes a citizen&#x27;s arrest. Ricky uncovers human skeletal remains in the Klopeks&#x27; car trunk. The Klopeks are arrested, and charges against Ray are dropped. Ray states that he and his family are going away for a while, and asks Ricky to watch over the neighborhood.

==Cast==
Additional minor roles were played by Dick Miller and Robert Picardo as garbagemen Vic and Joe; Franklyn Ajaye and Rance Howard as detectives; Bill Stevenson, Gary Hays, and Carey Scott as Ricky&#x27;s friends; and Kevin Gage and Dana Olsen as policemen.

==Production==
===Writing===
Screenwriter Dana Olsen based the script on experiences from his own childhood: &quot;I had an ultranormal middle-class upbringing, but our town had its share of psychos. There was a legendary hatchet murder in the thirties, and every once in a while, you&#x27;d pick up the local paper and read something like &#x27;LIBRARIAN KILLS FAMILY, SELF.&#x27; As a kid, it was fascinating to think that Mr. Flanagan down the street could turn out to be Jack the Ripper. And where there&#x27;s fear, there&#x27;s comedy. So I approached &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot; as &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot; meet Charles Manson.&quot;

Olsen&#x27;s script attracted producer Larry Brezner, who brought it to Imagine Films. It was greeted with a warm reception from Imagine co-founder Brian Grazer: &quot;I liked the concept of a regular guy taking a vacation in his own neighborhood, plus it was funny and well written. It suddenly dawned on me that Joe Dante would be fantastic [as a director] because it&#x27;s a mixture of comedy, horror, and reality.&quot;

Dante, who had directed &quot;Gremlins&quot; and &quot;Innerspace&quot;, and his partner, Michael Finnell, were immediately impressed by the concept of the movie. Dante, who specialized in offbeat subject matter, was intrigued by the blending of real-life situations with elements of the supernatural: &quot;When I tell people about the story, a remarkable number say, &#x27;On my grandmother&#x27;s block, there were people like that. They never mowed their lawn, and they never came out, and they let their mail stack up, and nobody knew who they were.&#x27; And I must confess that in my own neighborhood there&#x27;s a house like that, falling to wrack and ruin. I think this is perhaps a more common event than most people are aware of.&quot;

Dante had been developing &quot;Little Man Tate&quot; (later made by Jodie Foster) but that project collapsed when offered the script which was then called &quot;Bay Window&quot;. Dante recalled, &quot;I liked the characters. But the script ended with the hero being killed and driven away in an ambulance by a guy that he’s been persecuting through the movie, the guy who then turns out to really be guilty. And the fact that the guy is guilty turns out to be sort of a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; surprise, an O. Henry twist ending. And I thought, “Well, that’s OK.” But then they decided that we wanted to hire Tom Hanks. And suddenly, it was like, “Well, you know we can’t kill Tom Hanks. What are we going to do? We&#x27;ll have to change it”.&quot;

===Casting===
Dante, Brezner, and Finnell agreed that Tom Hanks would be the most suitable actor to portray the married Ray Peterson, a conservative man who tries to introduce excitement into his life by investigating the activities of his strange neighbors. Dante referred to Hanks as &quot;the reigning everyman, a guy that everybody can identify with&quot;, comparing him to James Stewart. Brezner echoed this sentiment, saying &quot;Hanks is an actor capable of acting funny rather than funny acting. He also has no problem with transition from comedy to Pathos, as he showed in &quot;Nothing in Common&quot;, and he&#x27;s now proving himself as one of the country&#x27;s most versatile actors.&quot;

Hanks accepted the role of Ray with enthusiasm, later saying &quot;What&#x27;s so bizarrely interesting about this black psychocomedy is that the stuff that goes on in real life in a regular neighborhood will make your hair stand up on the back of your neck.&quot; He was also intrigued by his character&#x27;s distinctive personality traits: &quot;Sometimes there&#x27;s more of an opportunity to create than others. Here&#x27;s a guy with a great life – a nice house, a wife, a beautiful tree, a nice neighborhood – and he&#x27;s happy. Next day, he hates it all. I thought something must&#x27;ve happened to him offstage. And that&#x27;s the challenge for me of the part: to communicate Ray&#x27;s offscreen dilemma. One of the reasons Ray doesn&#x27;t go away on vacation is because it&#x27;s another extension of the normalcy he&#x27;s fallen into. So he thinks he&#x27;ll try a more Bohemian thing, which is to just hang around the house. With a week&#x27;s worth of free time on his hands, Ray is drawn into the pre-occupations of his neighbors, who always seem to be at home. But what I did is just back-story embellishment that any actor will do. Perhaps from my repertory experience. I don&#x27;t ask a director for motivation. If he says, &#x27;Go over to the window&#x27;, I find the reason myself.&quot;

Hanks found admiration for Dante&#x27;s directorial style, saying &quot;Joe has a stylized, visionary way of looking at the entire movie. It&#x27;s pure film-making – the story is told from the camera&#x27;s point of view, and that&#x27;s a type of movie I haven&#x27;t made.&quot; Dante, in turn, praised his star. &quot;The most impressive thing about Tom Hanks as a comic actor is how effortless he makes it seem. He actually is very diligent about his acting, but his comic sense of what is going to work – and what isn&#x27;t – is really unparalleled.&quot; Dante&#x27;s laid-back, casual style encouraged improvisation among the actors. He noted, &quot;Tom doesn&#x27;t like to do scenes the way they&#x27;re always done. He goes out of his way to put a different spin on everything and his being good as he is and as open as he is encouraged the other actors to do the same. It set a tone for the movie that made it a lot of fun to make.&quot;

===Filming===
&quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot; was filmed entirely at Universal Studios over ten weeks in the summer of 1988, mainly on the Colonial Street set on the back lot, which served as the Mayfield Place cul-de-sac. &quot;I can&#x27;t think of many pictures since &quot;Lifeboat&quot; that all take place in the same area,&quot; Dante said as production got under way. &quot;There was a lot of temptation to broaden it and go outside the neighborhood, but it seemed to violate the spirit of the piece. It&#x27;s almost the kind of thing that could be a stage play except that you could never do on-stage what we&#x27;ve done in this movie.&quot; The Colonial Street set had been used in 1987&#x27;s &quot;Dragnet&quot;, also starring Hanks. At the time &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot; began production, it was being used as the location for &quot;The New Leave It to Beaver&quot; television series. To ensure the set would fit the tone of his film, Dante said, &quot;I asked [production designer] James Spencer, a veteran of &quot;Poltergeist&quot; and &quot;Gremlins&quot;, if he thought he could turn that street into the neighborhood we needed in that period of time.&quot; Spencer rose to the challenge, and within a few days they began work on sketching out the proposed designs for the sets. Spencer observed, &quot;We had to be on the spot. Due to the lack of time, it would have been ludicrous to do our drawing elsewhere.&quot; The orchestral soundtrack for the film was composed by Jerry Goldsmith.

Dante recalled &quot;we shot, in fact, three endings for the picture. None of them, I think, really worked. But also, because of the writers’ strike, we had to sort of make it up as we were going along.&quot; Dante says the preview audience did not like the original ending which was more critical of the lead characters, so he changed it.
==Release==

===Box office===
The film opened at number 1 with $11,101,197 in its opening weekend (February 17–20, 1989). Overall, in the US, the film made $36,601,993 and $49,101,993 worldwide.

===Critical reaction===
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it two out of four stars, writing &quot;&quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot; tries to position itself somewhere between &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, but it lacks the dementia of the first and the wicked intelligence of the second and turns instead into a long shaggy dog story.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot; a negative review, calling it &quot;as empty as something can be without creating a vacuum&quot;. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 56% based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot; has an engaging premise, likable cast, and Joe Dante at the helm – so the mixed-up genre exercise they produce can&#x27;t help but feel like a disappointment.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Home media===
Arrow Video released &quot;The &#x27;Burbs&quot; on Blu-ray in 2014 in the UK with a new 2K scan of the inter-positive. The edition included a commentary by screenwriter Dana Olsen, a newly commissioned feature-length documentary titled &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood: The Making of ″The ″Burbs″&quot;. In the United States, the film was first given a Blu-ray release in 2016 by Universal Studios. However, this release was criticized for poor quality and being a bare bones release. In 2018, Shout! Factory re-released the film on Blu-ray with the transfer and majority of the special features from the 2014 Arrow release from the UK.

The soundtrack album received a release on LP record in 2018 on the Waxwork Records label, as an expanded double-LP package. Additional music used in the film but not included on the soundtrack albums includes &quot;Machine&quot; by Circus of Power; &quot;Se Sei Qualcuno è Colpa Mia&quot; by Ennio Morricone; &quot;Questa o Quella&quot; by Enrico Caruso; and &quot;Locked in a Cage&quot;, &quot;Make Some Noise&quot;, and &quot;Bloodstone&quot; by Jetboy.

==Future==
A series remake is in development at Peacock. Keke Palmer is headlining the series, with Brian Grazer and Seth MacFarlane producing through Imagine Entertainment and Fuzzy Door Productions respectively.

<text>Robert Alexander Spiers (27 September 1945 – 8 December 2008) was a Scottish television director and producer. Spiers worked on many sitcoms, including &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; and &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, and won two British Academy Television Awards for &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; and &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. He also directed the films &quot;That Darn Cat&quot;, &quot;Spice World&quot;, and &quot;Kevin of the North&quot;.

==Life and career==
Born in Glasgow, Scotland, he attended Southgate College in the 1960s. &quot;Jock&quot;, as he was affectionately known at the time, organised several student trips from the college to mainland Europe, including Brussels and Cologne, during this period. He was also already an accomplished tennis player, having achieved a very high national standard during the time he lived in Scotland.

Spiers joined the staff of the BBC in 1970, working as an assistant floor manager and later a production assistant, before eventually working his way up to become a director and producer. As a director he worked on several high-profile programmes, such as &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; (also producing) and &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;, all sitcoms, a genre with which he became particularly associated. During the 1970s he met his wife, Annie.

It was because of his talent for directing comedy that he was chosen to handle the second series of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; in 1979, which already had an enormous reputation on the basis of its initial six episodes in 1975, and it won him his first BAFTA award. Spiers subsequently provided a commentary for all the episodes he directed of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; when the series was released on DVD. Shortly after he directed the series and the unbroadcast pilot of &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, Spiers left the staff of the BBC to work as a freelance director.

Throughout the 1980s, he worked on a number of programmes, of particular note being Channel 4&#x27;s anthology comedy series &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; and the BBC sketch shows &quot;French and Saunders&quot; and &quot;A Bit of Fry and Laurie&quot;. He began his association with writer Steven Moffat in 1989, directing over half of the episodes of the teen comedy drama series &quot;Press Gang&quot; (1989–1993) for the ITV network. According to Moffat, Spiers was the &quot;principal director&quot; taking an interest in the other episodes and setting the visual style of the show. Spiers particularly used tracking shots, sometimes requiring more dialogue to be written to accommodate the length of the shot. The other directors would come in and &quot;do a Spiers&quot;. Spiers then directed all twelve episodes of Moffat&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Joking Apart&quot; (1993, 1995). The show won the Bronze Rose of Montreux and was entered for the Emmys.

His association with comedians Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders from directing their sketch show led to him working on individual projects from each of them during the 1990s. With French he worked on the macabre comedy anthology series &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot;, with some episodes written by Moffat (such as &quot;Overkill&quot;). He helmed Saunders&#x27; &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; throughout the decade, the show having originated in a sketch from an episode of &quot;French and Saunders&quot; which had also been directed by Spiers. &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; won Spiers his second BAFTA award.

Spiers directed the pop group the Spice Girls in their film &quot;Spiceworld&quot; (1997). He had been working in America on the Disney film &quot;That Darn Cat&quot; at the peak of the Spice Girls&#x27; popularity, and was unaware of the group when first offered the job of directing &quot;Spiceworld&quot; until friend Jennifer Saunders advised that he take it. He arrived at a meeting with them in a New York hotel unaware of what they looked like. He also directed two episodes of the Australian ABC series &quot;The Adventures of Lano and Woodley&quot;.

He died of cancer in December 2008 in Widecombe, Devon at a family home after a long illness.

<text>The Birth of Merlin, or, The Child Hath Found his Father is a Jacobean play, probably written in whole or part by William Rowley. It was first performed in 1622 at the Curtain Theatre in Shoreditch. It contains a comic depiction of the birth of the fully grown Merlin to a country girl, and also features figures from Arthurian legend, including Uther Pendragon, Vortigern, and Aurelius Ambrosius.

==Authorship==
The 1662 first edition of &quot;The Birth of Merlin&quot; was a quarto printed by Thomas Johnson for the booksellers Francis Kirkman and Henry Marsh; it attributed the play to William Shakespeare and William Rowley. &quot;Merlin&quot; is thus one of two plays published in the seventeenth century as a Shakespearean collaboration, the other being &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;. Most scholars reject the attribution to Shakespeare and believe that the play is Rowley&#x27;s, perhaps with a different collaborator. The play has occasionally been revived in the modern era, for example at Theatr Clwyd.

&quot;The Birth of Merlin&quot; shares a significant relationship with &quot;Cupid&#x27;s Revenge,&quot; a play in the Beaumont and Fletcher canon. Large-scale resemblances in plotting – the missing prince, the ruler and his heir who both fall in love with the same woman – could be explained through derivation from common sources; but these larger-scale elements are supported by multiple specific lines and passages that occur in both plays.

The early critics who first discovered these commonalities took them as evidence that Beaumont and Fletcher had a hand in the authorship of &quot;The Birth of Merlin&quot;. This view, however, has not been accepted by the consensus of scholars and critics, since apart from the cited common passages, there is no evidence of Beaumont&#x27;s or Fletcher&#x27;s authorship in the play. The common passages appear to be best explained as the type of borrowings sometimes found in works of the era (the borrowings from Thomas North&#x27;s translation of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, for example) that have no bearing on questions of authorship. Though the dates of authorship for both plays are uncertain, it seems likely that &quot;Cupid&#x27;s Revenge&quot; is the earlier work, and that the author or authors of &quot;Merlin&quot; borrowed from the Beaumont-Fletcher play.

==Characters==
* Aurelius – king of Britains
* Uther – prince, brother and heir of Aurelius 
* Donobert – a British nobleman
* Constantia and Modestia – daughters of Donobert
* Cador and Edwin – suitors to Constantia and Modestia 
* Artesia – a Saxon princess and chief ambassador, later Aurelius&#x27; queen-consort
* Edol – a dissident British courtier and enemy of Vortigern 
* a Christian British Hermit
* Joan Go-to&#x27;t – an unwed, pregnant, British commoner
* a fat Clown – Joan&#x27;s loyal brother
* a Devil – poorly disguised as a courtier, and father of Joan&#x27;s child
* Lucina – a pagan goddess 
* the Fates – three pagan goddesses
* Merlin – full-grown child born to Joan in the middle of the play
* Vortigern – a king in Wales and a Saxon ally
* Saxon emissaries, later courtiers – among them a pagan priest-magician
* British courtiers
* Welch courtiers

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Birth of Merlin&quot; possesses a three-level plot, a structure common in plays of its era.
* The main plot has royal characters concerned with statecraft and national welfare.
* The subplot has aristocratic and genteel characters concerned with personal values and personal fulfilment.
* The comic subplot has common characters whose concerns are largely sensual.

The play is rich with visual effects of varying types, including gods and devils, magic, and masque-like spectacles. It was clearly designed to provide broad, colourful, fast-paced entertainment, rather than to reflect on real-world life.

===Opening===
Unusually, the play is staged to begin on its second level: The opening scene introduces the nobleman Donobert, his daughters Constantia and Modestia, and their suitors Cador and Edwin, and begins the story of Modestia&#x27;s conflict between her desire for a religious vocation versus social pressures to marry. The famous characters of Arthurian romance do not appear until the second scene, which introduces King Aurelius and his royal court. The British are flush with a recent victory over the invading Saxons, though they are troubled by the absence of the king&#x27;s missing brother, Uther.

Saxon emissaries arrive at court to negotiate a peace; they are led by the Saxon princess Artesia. Aurelius instantly falls in love with Artesia, and in his infatuation grants the Saxons very generous peace terms, despite the objections of his courtiers and the criticism of a holy hermit who interjects his own opposition. (Before the scene ends, Modestia consults the Hermit about her personal spiritual difficulty.)

===The forest===
The first scene in Act II introduces the otherwise-unnamed Clown and his very pregnant sister, Joan Go-to&#x27;t. References through the play identify the fat Clown as a type-role that Rowley repeatedly wrote into the play for himself. The Clown&#x27;s sister has gotten pregnant by yielding to the advances of a mysterious stranger; she and the Clown are now wandering through the forest, searching for the father of the child, or at least &quot;a&quot; father for the child.

Sister and brother – Joan and the Clown – stumble upon Prince Uther wandering through the same forest, distracted and disconsolate after having caught sight of a woman with whom he instantly fell in love. Overhearing this, the Clown solicits Uther as a potential husband for Joan, much to the prince&#x27;s outrage. As he beats them, their cries are heard by courtiers searching for the prince, who interrupt the scene and carry Uther back to court. The Clown and Joan are left to continue their search.

===Back at court===
At court, Aurelius&#x27;s infatuation with Artesia has led to a sudden marriage. One British noble, Edol, is so outraged that he flees the court to nourish his opposition. The court now blends British and Saxon influences, though not smoothly or happily. The Hermit has a contest of power with a Saxon magician; the Christian Hermit triumphs over pagan magic. Prince Uther enters, and sees that the woman who has caused his distraction is now his brother&#x27;s wife and the new British queen. Aurelius recognises the situation, and withdraws in anger and jealousy.

In Act III, the Clown and Joan have reached the court in their search for her child&#x27;s father. They confront various courtiers, with comically unsuccessful results. Finally, though, they encounter the actual father: Though Joan sees him as a handsome courtier, the Clown can recognise him for the devil, &quot;his feet and head horrid&quot;. Joan pursues him, and the Clown loyally follows her. In the second-level plot, Modestia embraces her religious vocation; in a familial confrontation, Modestia&#x27;s defence of her choice is so persuasive that her sister Constantia is converted to the spiritual life and rejects her suitor, just as Modestia has done. Donobert is outraged, but urges Cador and Edwin not to give up on his daughters yet.

===Back in the forest and the birth of Merlin===
In a cave in a forest, the Devil summons Lucina and the Fates to attend Joan as she gives birth to Merlin. The Clown catches up, to meet his sister and his new-born nephew, a fully grown Merlin the Magician. Merlin introduces his Clown-uncle to his Devil-father; the Devil predicts a dramatic future for his newborn son. In the British court, the Saxons are plotting treason; Artesia manipulates Uther&#x27;s romantic interest and Aurelius&#x27;s jealousy to bring about a fissure between the two, though her plans are partially frustrated by the British nobles. The two factions separate and prepare for war.

Meanwhile, Merlin, Joan, and the Clown have made their way to Wales, where King Vortigern, a Saxon ally, is having trouble building a castle. To keep the edifice from continual collapse, the Welsh must sacrifice a &quot;fiend-begotten child&quot;; therefore they are pleased and relieved when Merlin appears. Merlin, however, foretells Vortigern&#x27;s imminent defeat at the hands of Edol and the British. A series of battle scenes portray Edol&#x27;s victory, culminating in a spectacular special-effect scene in which Merlin prophesies on a blazing comet.

===Dénouement===
Act V provides a swift wind-up of the various plots. Merlin seals his devil-father within the earth, and leads his mother away to a life of repentance. Donobert accepts his daughters&#x27; religious commitment to the solitary and celibate life. The British defeat the treacherous Saxons, who have assassinated Aurelius. Uther is now the British king, aided by Merlin.

<text>The Taebaek Mountains () are a mountain range that stretches across North Korea and South Korea. They form the main ridge of the Korean peninsula.

==Geography==
The Taebaek mountains are located along the eastern edge of the peninsula and run along the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula. The Hwangnyong Mountain in North Korea (1268 meters) forms the northern end of the range. Busan lies at the southern end of this mountain range, thus making the mountain range a total length of over 500 kilometers, averaging about 1000 meters in height.

Prominent peaks of the range include Mount Seoraksan (1,708 m), Mount Kumgangsan (1,638 m), Mount Taebaeksan (1,566.7 m) and Mount Odaesan (1,563 m). To the east, the mountain range falls steeply into the sea, but to the west, there are more gentle slopes. Many spurs stretch southwest. The most important rivers of South Korea, the Han River and the Nakdong River, both originate in the Taebaek Mountains.

==Ecology==
Many of the slopes are extensively covered in forests.

==Industry==
Economically, the Taebaek mountains are important for the mining of iron, coal, tungsten, fluorite, and limestone.

==Attractions==
Manggyeongsa Temple in Hyeol-dong Taebaek, Gangwon-do Province at an altitude of 1,460 meters on Mount Taebaeksan, is a temple built to enshrine the statue of the Bodhisattva of wisdom. It was built by Jajang, a Silla Dynasty monk. The &quot;Dragon Spring&quot; at the entrance of the temple is known as the highest spring in Korea.

The 2018 Winter Olympics took place in Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do, located in the mountains.

Taebaek is also a name of a poomsae that is performed by the 3rd Dan black belts in Tae Kwon Do. Taebaek is mostly practised in Southern South Korea.

<text>Meera Syal FRSL (born Feroza Syal; 27 June 1961) is an English comedian, writer, playwright, singer, journalist and actress. She rose to prominence as one of the team that created &quot;Goodness Gracious Me&quot; and by portraying Sanjeev&#x27;s grandmother, Ummi, in &quot;The Kumars at No. 42&quot;. She has become one of the UK&#x27;s best-known Asian personalities.

She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1997 New Year Honours and in 2003 was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to drama and literature.

In 2023, she was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship.

== Early life ==
Syal was born on 27 June 1961 in Wolverhampton and grew up in Essington, Staffordshire, a mining village a few miles to the north. Her Indian Punjabi parents, Surinder Syal (father) and Surinder Kaur (mother), came to the United Kingdom from New Delhi. When she was young, the family moved to Bloxwich, north of Walsall.

This landscape, and the family&#x27;s status as the only Asian family in the small Midlands mining village of Essington, were later to form the backdrop to her novel (later filmed) &quot;Anita and Me&quot;, which Syal described in a 2003 BBC interview as semi-autobiographical. She attended Queen Mary&#x27;s High School in nearby Walsall and then studied English and Drama at Manchester University, graduating with a Double First.

== Acting and writing career ==
In 2023, she was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship, its highest accolade, for her career on screen. During her studies in Manchester, Syal joined the Stephen Joseph Studio, acting and later writing stage plays. On graduation, she had secured a place to study for an MA in drama and psychotherapy at the University of Leeds, and then to study for a PGCE to teach. However, she had also co-written the one-woman play &quot;One of Us&quot; with Jackie Shapiro, in which Syal performed all fifteen parts, about a West Midlands-born ethnic Indian girl who ran away from home to become an actress. First performed at the Stephen Joseph Studio, she then performed it at the National Student Drama Festival where it won a prize to perform at the Edinburgh International Festival, where it also won a prize. As a result, a director from the Royal Court Theatre contacted Syal, and asked her to perform in a play at the Royal Court on a three-year contract.

Syal wrote the screenplay for the 1993 film &quot;Bhaji on the Beach&quot;, directed by Gurinder Chadha, of &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; fame. In 1996 she played Miss Chauhan, a high school football coach in the film &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot;. She was on the team that wrote and performed in the BBC comedy sketch show &quot;Goodness Gracious Me&quot; (1996–2001), originally on radio and then on television. She was a scriptwriter on A.R. Rahman and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Bombay Dreams&quot; and she played the grandmother Sushila in the International Emmy-award-winning series &quot;The Kumars at No. 42&quot;, which ran for seven series, reviving the character in 2021 for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Gossip and Goddesses with Granny Kumar&quot;.

In October 2008, she starred in the BBC Two sitcom &quot;Beautiful People&quot;. This role, as Aunty Hayley, continued in 2009. Syal starred in the eleventh series of &quot;Holby City&quot; as consultant Tara Sodi. In 2009, she guest starred in &quot;Minder&quot; and starred in the film &quot;Mad, Sad &amp; Bad&quot;. In 2010, she played Shirley Valentine in a one-woman show at the Menier Chocolate Factory, later transferring to Trafalgar Studios. In the same year she played Nasreen Chaudhry in two episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; alongside Matt Smith.

Syal&#x27;s memoir is due to be published in 2025.

== Other notable appearances ==
Syal is an occasional singer, having achieved a number one record with Gareth Gates and her co-stars from &quot;The Kumars at No. 42&quot; with &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot;, the Comic Relief single. She earlier (1988) provided vocals for a bhangra version of &quot;Then He Kissed Me&quot;, composed by Biddu and with the Pakistani pop star Nazia Hassan, as part of the short-lived girl band Saffron. In June 2003 she appeared as a guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; programme with a selection of music by Nitin Sawhney, Madan Bala Sindhu, Joni Mitchell, Pizzicato Five, Sukhwinder Singh, Louis Armstrong and others. The luxury she chose to ease her life as a castaway was a piano.

Having studied English at university and penned two novels and a variety of scripts and screenplays, Syal was chosen as one of the guests on &quot;The Cultural Exchange&quot; slot of &quot;Front Row&quot; on 30 April 2013, when she nominated &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; by Harper Lee as a piece of art work which she loved.

As a journalist, she writes occasionally for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

== Awards and recognition ==
Syal won the National Student Drama Award for performing in &quot;One of Us&quot; which was written by Jacqueline Shapiro while at university. She won the Betty Trask Award for her first book &quot;Anita and Me&quot; and the Media Personality of the Year award at the Commission for Racial Equality&#x27;s annual &quot;Race in the Media&quot; awards in 2000. She was given the Nazia Hassan Foundation award in 2003.

In 2011–12, Syal was appointed visiting professor of contemporary theatre at St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford. She has an honorary degree from SOAS, University of London and from the University of Roehampton.

She received her CBE insignia from the Prince of Wales on 6 May 2015 at Buckingham Palace.

In 2017, Syal was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

In May 2023, she received the BAFTA Fellowship, regarded as the highest accolade of the British Academy Television Awards.

== Personal life ==
Syal married journalist Shekhar Bhatia in 1989; they divorced in 2002. Their daughter, Milli Bhatia, is associate director of the Royal Court Theatre. In January 2005, Syal married her frequent collaborator, Sanjeev Bhaskar, who plays her grandson in &quot;The Kumars at No. 42&quot;; the marriage ceremony took place in Lichfield register office, Staffordshire. They have a son, born in 2005.

In 2004, Syal took part in one episode of the BBC series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, which investigated her family history. Syal discovered that both her grandfathers were supporters of the Indian independence movement: one as a communist journalist, the other as a Punjab protester who was briefly imprisoned in the Golden Temple.

Syal&#x27;s brother is investigative journalist Rajeev Syal, who covers Whitehall, writing stories for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

In February 2009, Syal was one of a number of British entertainers who signed an open letter printed in &quot;The Times&quot; protesting against the persecution of Baháʼís in Iran.

In January 2011, Syal took part in the BBC Radio 4 programme My Teenage Diary, discussing growing up as the only British Asian girl in a small English town, feeling overweight and unattractive.

<text>Manhunter is a 1986 American thriller film directed and written by Michael Mann. Based on the 1981 novel &quot;Red Dragon&quot; by Thomas Harris, it stars William Petersen as FBI profiler Will Graham. Also featured are Tom Noonan as serial killer Francis Dollarhyde, Dennis Farina as Graham&#x27;s FBI superior Jack Crawford, and Brian Cox as incarcerated killer Hannibal Lecktor. The film focuses on Graham coming out of retirement to lend his talents to an investigation on Dollarhyde, a killer known as the Tooth Fairy. In doing so, he must confront the demons of his past and meet with Lecktor, who nearly killed Graham.

&quot;Manhunter&quot; focuses on the forensic work carried out by the FBI to track down killers and shows the long-term effects that cases like this have on profilers such as Graham, highlighting the similarities between him and his quarry. The film features heavily stylized use of color to convey this sense of duality, and the nature of the characters&#x27; similarity has been explored in academic analysis of the film. It was the first film adaptation of Harris&#x27; &quot;Hannibal Lecter&quot; novels, as well as the first adaptation of &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, which later became the basis for a film of the same name in 2002.

Opening to mixed reviews, &quot;Manhunter&quot; fared poorly at the box office at the time of its release, making only $8.6 million in the United States. It has been reassessed in more recent reviews and now enjoys a more favorable reception, as both the acting and the stylized visuals have been appreciated better in later years. Its resurgent popularity has seen it labelled as a cult film.

== Plot ==
Will Graham is a former FBI criminal profiler who has retired following a mental breakdown after being attacked by a serial killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecktor, whom he captured. Graham is approached at his Florida home by his former FBI superior Jack Crawford, who is seeking help with a new serial killer case. Promising his wife that he will do nothing more than find evidence and not risk physical harm, Graham agrees to visit the most recent crime scene in Atlanta, where he tries to enter the mindset of the killer, dubbed the Tooth Fairy by the police for the bite marks left on his victims.

Having found the killer&#x27;s fingerprints, Graham meets with Crawford, and they are accosted by tabloid journalist Freddy Lounds. Graham pays a visit to Lecktor, a former psychiatrist, in his cell and asks for his insight into the killer&#x27;s motivations. Lecktor agrees to look at the case file. Later, Lecktor obtains Graham&#x27;s home address by deceit while ostensibly making a phone call to his attorney.

Graham travels to the first crime scene in Birmingham, Alabama. He is contacted by Crawford, who patches Graham through to Frederick Chilton, Lecktor&#x27;s warden, who has found a note in Lecktor&#x27;s personal effects. They realize it is from the Tooth Fairy, expressing admiration for Lecktor and an interest in Graham. Crawford brings Graham to Washington, where a missing section of the note is analyzed to determine what Lecktor removed. They discover an instruction to communicate through the personals section of the &quot;National Tattler&quot;, Lounds&#x27;s newspaper.

The FBI intends to plant a fake advertisement to replace Lecktor&#x27;s, but without the proper book code the Tooth Fairy will know it is fake. They let the advertisement run as it is, and Graham organizes an interview with Lounds, giving a false and derogatory profile of the Tooth Fairy to incite him. After a sting operation fails to catch the killer, Lounds is kidnapped by the Tooth Fairy. Lounds is forced to tape-record a statement before being set on fire in a wheelchair, his flaming body rolled into the parking garage of the &quot;National Tattler&quot; as a warning.

The FBI decodes Lecktor&#x27;s coded message to the Tooth Fairy: it is Graham&#x27;s home address with an instruction to kill Graham and his family. Graham rushes home to find his family safe but terrified. After the FBI moves Graham&#x27;s family to a safe house, he explains to his son Kevin why he retired previously.

At his job in a St. Louis film lab, Francis Dollarhyde—the Tooth Fairy—approaches a blind co-worker, Reba McClane, and offers her a ride home. They go to Dollarhyde&#x27;s home, where Reba is oblivious to the fact that Dollarhyde is watching home-movie footage of his planned next victims. The following night, Graham realizes the Tooth Fairy&#x27;s murders are driven by a desire for acceptance. Meanwhile, Dollarhyde watches as Reba is escorted home by another co-worker. He murders the man and abducts Reba.

Searching for a connection between the murdered families, Graham realizes that the killer must have seen their home movies; he brought bolt cutters to a home with a padlock in a home video. Graham and Crawford identify the lab in St. Louis where the films were processed. After determining which employees have seen these films, he and Crawford travel with a police escort to Dollarhyde&#x27;s home. Inside, Dollarhyde prepares to kill Reba with a piece of glass. Seeing that Dollarhyde has someone with him, Graham lunges through a window. He is subdued by Dollarhyde, who retrieves a shotgun and shoots two police officers and injures Crawford. Wounded in the firefight, Dollarhyde returns to the kitchen, where he is killed by Graham. Graham, Reba, and Crawford are tended to by paramedics and Graham returns home to his family.

== Cast ==

* William Petersen as FBI Agent Will Graham. Richard Gere, Mel Gibson and Paul Newman were considered for the role, but Mann cast Petersen after seeing footage from &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; Petersen spent time with officers of the Chicago Police Department researching for his role. Additionally, Petersen had a small role as a bouncer in Mann&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Thief&quot;.
* Tom Noonan as Francis Dollarhyde, whose name is spelled differently from the novel&#x27;s &quot;Dolarhyde.&quot; Noonan credits his ability to improvise during rehearsals for his casting. He took up bodybuilding to prepare physically for the part. He began preparation for his role by studying other serial killers, but quickly rejected this approach. While shooting the film, Noonan remained in character at all times, keeping away from cast members playing his pursuers.
* Dennis Farina as FBI Agent Jack Crawford. Farina had already worked with Mann before, making his acting debut in the 1981 film &quot;Thief&quot; before starring in &quot;Crime Story&quot; and in several episodes of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. Farina had already read the novel &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, and was called to audition at the same time as Brian Cox.
* Brian Cox as Dr. Hannibal Lecktor. Actors John Lithgow, Mandy Patinkin, and Brian Dennehy, and director William Friedkin were also considered for the part of Lecktor, whose name was changed from the novel&#x27;s &quot;Lecter.&quot; Cox based his performance on Scottish serial killer Peter Manuel. Cox was asked to audition with his back turned to the casting agents, as they felt they needed to focus on the power of his voice when considering him for the part.
* Kim Greist as Molly Graham. Greist has previously worked with Mann on an episode of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.
* Joan Allen as Reba McClane. In preparation for her role, Allen spent time with the New York Institute for the Blind, learning to walk through New York blindfolded. She had previously worked with co-star William Petersen on stage, in the 1980 Steppenwolf Theatre Company production of &quot;Balm in Gilead&quot;.
* Stephen Lang as Freddy Lounds. Lang had previously starred in &quot;Band of the Hand&quot;, on which Mann was executive producer. He went on to appear in the Mann-produced &quot;Crime Story&quot; with Farina and in Mann&#x27;s 2009 film &quot;Public Enemies&quot;.

== Production ==
=== Pre-production ===
The film was originally going to be called &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, like the novel. Michael Mann, who called the new title &quot;inferior,&quot; said that producer Dino De Laurentiis made the change after Michael Cimino&#x27;s film &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;, produced by De Laurentiis, bombed at the box office in 1985. William Petersen has commented that another reason for the change was to avoid any suggestion that it might be a martial arts film. &quot;At the time, Bruce Lee was knocking out &quot;Dragon&quot; movies, and Dino, in his wisdom, decided people would think it was a kung-fu movie,&quot; he later recalled. Brian Cox, who played jailed killer Hannibal Lecktor, has also expressed disdain for the film&#x27;s title, calling it &quot;bland&quot; and &quot;cheesy.&quot; The word &quot;manhunter&quot; appeared in Stephen King&#x27;s influential review of the &quot;Red Dragon&quot; novel published by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in late 1981.

David Lynch was an early consideration for the director&#x27;s role, having still been under contract to De Laurentiis after making &quot;Dune&quot;. However, Lynch rejected the role after finding the story to be &quot;violent and completely degenerate.&quot;

William Petersen worked with the Chicago Police Department Violent Crimes Unit and the FBI Violent Crimes Unit in preparation for the role of Will Graham, talking to the officers and reading some of their crime files. He spoke to the investigators on the Richard Ramirez case about how they coped with the effects these disturbing cases had on them and how they learned to &quot;compartmentalize&quot; their working and personal lives. &quot;Of course you don&#x27;t really turn it off,&quot; he recalled. &quot;At the end of the day, even if you&#x27;re just a regular policeman, it takes a toll.&quot;

During the three years he spent working on the script, Michael Mann also spent time with the FBI&#x27;s Behavioral Science Unit, where he claimed to have met people very like the character of Will Graham. This level of research led Brent E. Turvey to describe the film as &quot;one of the most competent blends of cutting-edge forensic science and criminal profiling at the time.&quot; Mann also spent several years corresponding with imprisoned murderer Dennis Wayne Wallace. Wallace had been motivated by his obsession for a woman he barely knew, and believed that Iron Butterfly&#x27;s &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot; was &quot;their song.&quot; This connection inspired Mann to include the song in the film.

Tom Noonan, who played killer Francis Dollarhyde, initially researched other serial killers to study for the role, but was repulsed by it. He then decided to play the character with the sense that he felt he was doing right by his victims, not harming them. &quot;I wanted to feel this guy was doing the best he could,&quot; Noonan explained, &quot;that he was doing this out of love.&quot; Noonan credits his casting to improvisation during his audition, recalling that he was reading lines alongside a young woman. During a reading of the scene featuring the torture of Freddy Lounds, Noonan noticed that the woman began to seem frightened, and deliberately tried to scare her more. He believed that this is what secured the role for him.

Joan Allen, who played Dollarhyde&#x27;s blind love interest Reba McClane, recalls meeting with representatives of the New York Institute for the Blind in preparation for her role. She spent time walking around New York wearing a mask over her eyes to get accustomed to walking as though she were blind.

John Lithgow, Mandy Patinkin, William Friedkin, and Brian Dennehy were all considered for the role of Hannibal Lecktor, but Brian Cox was cast after being recommended to Mann by Dennehy. Cox based his portrayal on Scottish serial killer Peter Manuel, who he said &quot;didn&#x27;t have a sense of right and wrong.&quot; Cox has also suggested that his selection was due to his nationality, claiming that characters who are &quot;a little bit nasty&quot; are best played by Europeans. Mann kept the role of Lecktor very short, believing that it was &quot;such a charismatic character that [he] wanted the audience almost not to get enough of him.&quot; For the role of Will Graham, De Laurentiis had expressed interest in Richard Gere, Mel Gibson and Paul Newman, but Mann, having seen footage of William Petersen&#x27;s role in &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot;, championed Petersen for the part.

=== Filming ===
Petersen has claimed in an interview that one of the film&#x27;s scenes forced the crew to adopt a guerrilla filmmaking approach. The scene in which Petersen&#x27;s character Will Graham falls asleep while studying crime scene photographs during a flight required the use of an airplane during shooting. Michael Mann had been unable to gain permission to use a plane for the scene and booked tickets for the crew on a flight from Chicago to Florida. Once on board, the crew used their equipment, checked in as hand luggage, to shoot the scene quickly, while keeping the plane&#x27;s passengers and crew mollified with &quot;Manhunter&quot; crew jackets.

Cinematographer Dante Spinotti made strong use of color tints in the film, using a cool &quot;romantic blue&quot; tone to denote the scenes featuring Will Graham and his wife, and a more subversive green hue, with elements of purple or magenta, as a cue for the unsettling scenes in the film, mostly involving Dollarhyde. Petersen has stated that Mann wanted to create a visual aura to bring the audience into the film, so that the story would work on an interior and emotional level. Mann also made use of multiple frame rates in filming the climactic shootout: different cameras recording the scene at 24, 36, 72 and 90 frames per second, giving the final scene what Spinotti has called an &quot;off-tempo&quot; and &quot;staccato&quot; feel.

During principal photography, Noonan asked that no one playing his victims and pursuers be allowed to see him, while those he did speak to should address him by his character&#x27;s name, Francis. The first time Noonan met Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window during the filming of the climactic fight scene. Noonan admits that, because of his request, the atmosphere on set became so tense that people actually became afraid of him.

He had begun body-building to prepare for the role and felt that his size intimidated the crew when filming began, as the first scene to be shot was his character&#x27;s interrogation and murder of another. Noonan claims that this led him to take separate flights and stay in separate hotels from the rest of the cast. While on the film&#x27;s sets, he would remain in his trailer alone in the dark to prepare himself, sometimes joined by a silent Mann.

Petersen recalled filming the climactic shoot-out scene at the end of principal photography, when most of the crew had already left the production because of time constraints. With no special effects crew to provide the blood spatter for the gunshots, Petersen described how the remaining crew would blow ketchup across the set through hoses when such effects were needed. Joan Allen related that Mann simulated the impacts of bullets in Dollarhyde&#x27;s kitchen by throwing glass jars across the surfaces so they would shatter where he needed them to. One of these broken jars left a shard of glass embedded in Petersen&#x27;s thigh during filming. The pool of blood forming around Noonan&#x27;s character at the end of this scene was intended to allude to the &quot;Red Dragon&quot; tattoos worn by the character in the novel. This shot left Noonan lying in the corn syrup stage blood for so long that he became stuck to the floor.

Ted Levine, who later played Buffalo Bill in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, crashed &quot;Manhunter&quot;″s wrap party to spend time with Petersen, whom he knew from their days in Chicago theater. Levine was later invited to audition for &quot;Crime Story&quot; as a result of meeting Mann at this party.

=== Post-production ===
Spinotti has commented on how Mann&#x27;s use of mise en scène when framing shots evokes &quot;the emotional situation in the film at that particular time,&quot; noting the director&#x27;s focus on the particular shape or color of elements of the set. He has also drawn attention to the scene in which Graham visits Lecktor in his cell, pointing out the constant position of the cell bars within the frame, even as the shots cut back and forth between the two characters. &quot;There is nothing in &quot;Manhunter&quot; ... which is just a nice shot,&quot; says Spinotti. &quot;[It] is all focused into conveying that particular atmosphere; whether it&#x27;s happiness, or delusion, or disillusion.&quot; This &quot;manipulation of focus and editing&quot; has become a visual hallmark of the film.

Despite having initially filmed the scenes involving Francis Dollarhyde with an elaborate tattoo across Noonan&#x27;s chest, Mann and Spinotti felt that the finished result seemed out of place and that it &quot;trivialize[d] the struggle&quot; the character faced. Mann cut the scenes in which the character appeared bare-chested, and quickly re-shot additional footage to replace what had been removed. Spinotti noted that in doing so, scenes which he felt had been captured with a &quot;beautiful&quot; aesthetic were lost, as the production did not have the time to recreate the original lighting conditions.

Petersen had difficulty ridding himself of the Will Graham character after principal photography wrapped. While rehearsing for a play in Chicago, he felt the old character &quot;always coming out&quot; instead of his new role. To try and rid himself of the character, Petersen went to a barbershop where he had them shave his beard, cut his hair and dye it blond so that he could look into the mirror and see a different person. At first, he felt it was due to the rigorous shooting schedule for &quot;Manhunter&quot;, but later realized that the character &quot;had creeped in.&quot;

== Soundtrack ==

&quot;Manhunter&quot;″s soundtrack &quot;dominates the film,&quot; with music that is &quot;explicitly diegetic the entire way.&quot; Steve Rybin has commented that the music is not intended to correlate with the intensity of the action portrayed alongside it, but rather to signify when the viewer should react with a &quot;degree of aesthetic distance&quot; from the film, or be &quot;suture[d] into the diegetic world&quot; more closely. The soundtrack album was released in limited quantities in 1986, on MCA Records (#6182). It was not, however, released on compact disc at the time, but only on cassette tape and vinyl record.

In March 2007, a two-CD set titled &quot;Music from the Films of Michael Mann&quot; was released, featuring four tracks from &quot;Manhunter&quot;: The Prime Movers&#x27; &quot;Strong As I Am,&quot; Iron Butterfly&#x27;s &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,&quot; Shriekback&#x27;s &quot;This Big Hush,&quot; and Red 7&#x27;s &quot;Heartbeat.&quot; In March 2010, Intrada Records announced that they were releasing the &quot;Manhunter&quot; soundtrack on CD for the first time, with an extra track, &quot;Jogger&#x27;s Stakeout&quot; by The Reds.

The Reds were contacted about contributing to the film&#x27;s soundtrack after submitting their music for possible use on &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. They recorded their score over a period of two months, in studios in Los Angeles and New York City. They recorded 28 minutes of music for the film. Several cues were replaced later with music by Shriekback and Michel Rubini. &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; by Pink Floyd and &quot;I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)&quot; by The Electric Prunes have both been cited by The Reds&#x27; vocalist Rick Shaffer as influences on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Mann selected &quot;Strong as I Am&quot; by The Prime Movers for the film and later funded the filming of a music video for the song&#x27;s release as a single.

Music in the film&#x27;s screen credits which are not listed above were never included until the release of the double LP on Waxwork Records in July 2018:
== Themes ==
Visually, &quot;Manhunter&quot; is driven by strong color cues and the use of tints, including the hallmark blue of Mann&#x27;s work. Dante Spinotti has noted that these visual cues were meant to evoke different moods based on the tone of the scenes in which they were used: cool blue tones were used for the scenes shared between Will Graham and his wife Molly, and unsettling greens and magentas were used for the scenes with the killer Francis Dollarhyde.

Steven Rybin has observed that &quot;blue is associated with Molly, sex, and the Graham family home,&quot; while green denotes &quot;searching and discovery,&quot; pointing out the color of Graham&#x27;s shirt when the investigation begins and the green tone of the interior shots in the Atlanta police station. John Muir suggests that this helps identify the character of Graham with the &quot;goodness&quot; of the natural world, and Dollarhyde with the city, &quot;where sickness thrives.&quot; This strongly stylized approach drew criticism from reviewers at first, but has since been seen as a hallmark of the film and viewed more positively.

Academic studies of the film tend to draw attention to the relationship between the characters of Graham and Dollarhyde, noting, for example, that the film &quot;chooses to emphasize the novel&#x27;s symbiotic relationships between Graham, Lecter and Dolarhyde by visual techniques and screen acting where subtlety plays a key role.&quot; In his book &quot;Hearths of Darkness: The Family in the American Horror Film&quot;, Tony Williams praises the depth of the film&#x27;s characterizations, calling Dollarhyde a &quot;victim of society&quot; and his portrayal &quot;undermining convenient barriers between monster and human.&quot;

Philip L. Simpson echoes this sentiment in his book &quot;Psycho Paths: Tracking the Serial Killer through Contemporary American Film&quot;, calling &quot;Manhunter&quot; a &quot;profoundly ambiguous and destabilizing film&quot; which creates &quot;uncomfortable affinities between protagonist and antagonist.&quot; Mark T. Conard&#x27;s &quot;The Philosophy of Film Noir&quot; follows this same idea, claiming that the film presents the notion that &quot;what it takes to catch a serial killer is tantamount to being one.&quot;

== Release ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Manhunter&quot; was released in the United States on 15 August 1986. It opened in 779 theaters and grossed $2,204,400 in its opening weekend. The film eventually grossed a total of $8,620,929 in the US, making it the 76th highest-grossing film that year. Because of internal problems at De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, the UK premiere was postponed for over a year. It was screened in November 1987 as part of the London Film Festival and saw wide release on 24 February 1989. In France, &quot;Manhunter&quot; was screened on 9 April at the 1987 Cognac Festival du Film Policier, where it was awarded the Critics Prize. It was also shown at the 2009 Camerimage Film Festival in Łódź, Poland. On 19 March 2011, it was screened at Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its release. Michael Mann was present for discussion at the event.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Manhunter&quot; was released in a widescreen edition on laserdisc in 1986. It was released on VHS several times, including by BMG in October 1998 and by Universal Studios in 2001. It has been available on DVD in various versions. Anchor Bay released a two-DVD limited, numbered, edition in 2000, disc one being the Theatrical version and extras, disc two being the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut.&quot; An individual release of the first disc [Theatrical version] from the two-disc set was released at the same time. In 2003 Anchor Bay released the &quot;Restored Director&#x27;s Cut,&quot; overseen by Mann, which is very close to the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; on the 2000 disc but omits one scene. It features a commentary track by Mann.

MGM, current holders of the rights to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Hannibal&quot;, released the theatrical cut of &quot;Manhunter&quot; on DVD in a pan-and-scan format in 2004. In January 2007, the same version was released by MGM in a widescreen format, for the first time on DVD, as part of &quot;The Hannibal Lecter Collection&quot;, along with &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Hannibal&quot;. &quot;Manhunter&quot; was also released by itself in September 2007. The studio re-released &quot;The Hannibal Lecter Collection&quot; on Blu-ray in September 2009. In 2016, Shout! Factory released both the theatrical and director&#x27;s cut on Blu-ray.

== Reception ==
On its release, &quot;Manhunter&quot; was met with mixed reviews. At first, it was seen as too stylish, owing largely to Mann&#x27;s 1980s trademark use of pastel colors, art-deco architecture and glass brick. A common criticism in the initial reviews was that the film overemphasized the music and stylistic visuals. Petersen&#x27;s skill as a lead actor was also called into question. Particularly critical of the film&#x27;s stylistic approach was &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which called attention to Mann&#x27;s &quot;taste for overkill,&quot; branding his stylized approach as &quot;hokey&quot; and little more than &quot;gimmicks.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; writer Dave Kehr remarked that Mann &quot;believes in style so much that he has very little belief left over for the characters or situations of his film, which suffers accordingly,&quot; adding that the film&#x27;s focus on style serves to &quot;drain any notion of credibility&quot; from its plot.

Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was critical of the film&#x27;s visuals and soundtrack, comparing it unfavourably with &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and describing it as a &quot;chic, well-cast wasteland&quot; that &quot;delivers very little.&quot; The film&#x27;s stylistic similarity to &quot;Miami Vice&quot; was also pointed out by &quot;Film Threat&quot;&#x27;s Dave Beuscher, who felt it was the chief reason for the film&#x27;s poor box office results. Writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Steve Winn derided the film, claiming its lack of a strong lead role caused it to &quot;fall apart like the shattered mirrors that figure in the crimes.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; was more favorable in its review, praising the &quot;intelligent camerabatics&quot; and &quot;bold, controlled color scheme.&quot; Leonard Maltin gave the film three stars, calling it &quot;gripping all the way through and surprisingly nonexploitive,&quot; although adding that &quot;the holes start to show through&quot; if looked for &quot;too carefully.&quot; &quot;Manhunter&quot; was, however, nominated for the 1987 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture.

Modern appreciation of the film has seen its standing among critics improve. Salon.com called Mann&#x27;s original the best of the Lecter series, and &quot;Slate&quot; magazine described it as &quot;mesmerizing,&quot; positing that it directly inspired television series such as &quot;Millennium&quot; and &quot;&quot;, though calling attention to its &quot;&quot;Miami-Vice&quot;-like overreliance on synthesized sludge.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; called it &quot;the most aestheticised film of the 1980s,&quot; and noted its &quot;chilly integrity.&quot; British television channel and production company Film4 called it &quot;the most refined screen adaptation of Harris&#x27; books,&quot; although they found the film&#x27;s contemporary soundtrack &quot;dated.&quot; Sky Movies echoed this sentiment, summing up their review by saying &quot;although it still remains a classic, the film has dated slightly.&quot;

Retrospective reviews tend to be less critical of the stylized visuals: the BBC&#x27;s Ali Barclay called the film &quot;a truly suspenseful, stylish thriller,&quot; awarding it four out of five stars, and Nathan Ditum described it in &quot;Total Film&quot; as &quot;complex, disturbing and super-stylish,&quot; adding that the 2002 remake could not compete with it. &quot;Empire&quot; editor Mark Dinning gave the film five stars out of five, praising the &quot;subtlety&quot; of the acting and the &quot;neon angst&quot; of the visuals. Dinning also said that, compared to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, &quot;Manhunter&quot; was &quot;arguably the finer hour for cinema&#x27;s most alluring psychopath&quot;. Television channel Bravo named Dollarhyde&#x27;s interrogation of Freddy Lounds as one of its 30 Even Scarier Movie Moments in 2007, and Noonan&#x27;s portrayal of Dollarhyde was praised by Simon Abrams of UGO Networks as &quot;a highlight of his career.&quot;

Despite the low gross on its initial release, &quot;Manhunter&quot; grew in popularity by the 2000s and has been mentioned in several books and lists of cult films. These reappraisals often cite the success of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and its sequels as the reason for the increased interest in &quot;Manhunter&quot;, while still favoring the earlier film over its successors. 

== Legacy ==
&quot;Manhunter&quot;″s focus on the use of forensic science in a criminal investigation has been cited as a major influence on several films and television series that have come after it—most notably &quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot;, also featuring William Petersen, which was &quot;inspired, or at least influenced&quot; by the forensics scenes in &quot;Manhunter&quot;. Petersen&#x27;s sympathetic portrayal of profiler Will Graham has also been noted as helping to influence a &quot;shift in the image of the pop-culture FBI agent&quot; that would continue throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The film has also been noted as a thematic precursor to the series &quot;Millennium&quot;, &quot;John Doe&quot;, &quot;Profiler&quot;, and &quot;The X-Files&quot;, and to films such as &quot;Copycat&quot;, &quot;Switchback&quot;, &quot;The Bone Collector&quot;, &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;Fallen&quot;.

&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, a film adaptation of Harris&#x27; next Lecter novel, was released in 1991. However, none of the cast of &quot;Manhunter&quot; reprise their roles in the later film, although actors Frankie Faison and Dan Butler appear in both films as different and unrelated characters. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was followed in turn by a sequel: &quot;Hannibal&quot;; two prequels: &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Hannibal Rising&quot;; and two television series: CBS&#x27;s &quot;Clarice&quot;, and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Hannibal&quot;.

Of these later films, &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (2002), adapted from the same novel as &quot;Manhunter&quot;, was released to a generally positive critical reception and successful box office receipts, making $209,196,298 on a $78 million budget. Based on 2000s reviews, &quot;Red Dragon&quot; currently has a 69% rating from 191 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, and a 60% rating based on 36 reviews on Metacritic. &quot;Manhunter&quot;″s cinematographer Dante Spinotti also served as the director of photography on this version.

<text>Sumatriptan, sold under the brand name Imitrex among others, is a medication used to treat migraine headaches and cluster headaches. It is taken orally, intranasally, or by subcutaneous injection. Therapeutic effects generally occur within three hours.
Its primary effect as a serotonin 5-HT1B/5-HT1D receptor agonist can create common side effects such as chest pressure, fatigue, vomiting, tingling, and vertigo. Serious side effects may include serotonin syndrome, heart attacks, strokes, and seizures. With excessive use, medication overuse headaches may occur. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. The mechanism of action is not entirely clear. It is in the triptan class of medications.
Sumatriptan was patented in 1982 and approved for medical use in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 95th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6million prescriptions. It is also available as the combination product sumatriptan/naproxen.

==Medical uses==
Sumatriptan is effective for ending or relieving the intensity of migraine and cluster headaches. It is most effective when taken early after the start of the pain. Injected sumatriptan is more effective than other formulations.

Oral sumatriptan can be used also in the treatment of post-dural puncture headache.

==Adverse effects==
Overdose of sumatriptan can cause sulfhemoglobinemia, a rare condition in which the blood changes from red to green, due to the integration of sulfur into the hemoglobin molecule. If sumatriptan is discontinued, the condition reverses within a few weeks.

Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan injection or tablets. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.

The most common side effects reported by at least 2% of patients in controlled trials of sumatriptan (25-, 50-, and 100-mg tablets) for migraine are atypical sensations (paresthesias and warm/cold sensations) reported by 4% in the placebo group and 5–6% in the sumatriptan groups, pain and other pressure sensations (including chest pain) reported by 4% in the placebo group and 6–8% in the sumatriptan groups, neurological events (vertigo) reported by less than 1% in the placebo group and less than 1% to 2% in the sumatriptan groups. Malaise/fatigue occurred in less than 1% of the placebo group and 2–3% of the sumatriptan groups. Sleep disturbance occurred in less than 1% in the placebo group to 2% in the sumatriptan group.

=== Interactions ===
Concurrent use with other triptans or ergot-containing medications within 24 hours can result in additive vasoconstriction. Increased systemic exposure to sumatriptan can occur if used within 2 weeks after a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported with co-administration of triptans and serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

==Pharmacology==

=== Mechanism of action ===

Sumatriptan is molecularly similar to serotonin (5-HT), and is a 5-HT receptor (types 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B) agonist. Sumatriptan&#x27;s primary therapeutic effect is related in its inhibition of the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), likely through its 5-HT1D/1B receptor-agonist action. This has been substantiated by the efficacy of more recently developed CGRP targeting drugs and antibodies developed for the preventive treatment of migraine. How agonism of the 5-HT1D/1B receptors inhibits CGRP release is not fully understood. CGRP is believed to cause sensitization of trigeminal nociceptive neurons, contributing to the pain experienced in migraine.

Sumatriptan is also shown to decrease the activity of the trigeminal nerve, which presumably accounts for sumatriptan&#x27;s efficacy in treating cluster headaches. The injectable form of the drug has been shown to abort a cluster headache within 30 minutes in 77% of cases.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Sumatriptan is administered in several forms: tablets, subcutaneous injection, and nasal spray. Oral administration (as succinate salt) has low bioavailability, partly due to presystemic metabolism—some of it gets broken down in the stomach and bloodstream before it reaches the target arteries. A rapid-release tablet formulation with the same bioavailability but a high concentration can achieve therapeutic effects on average 10–15 minutes earlier than other oral formulations. When injected, sumatriptan is faster-acting (usually within 10 minutes), but the effect lasts for a shorter time. Sumatriptan is metabolised primarily by monoamine oxidase A into 2-{5-[(methylsulfamoyl)methyl]-indole-3-yl}acetic acid, which is then conjugated to glucuronic acid. These metabolites are excreted in the urine and bile. Only about 3% of the active drug may be recovered unchanged.

There is no simple, direct relationship between sumatriptan concentration (pharmacokinetics) per se in the blood and its anti-migraine effect (pharmacodynamics). This paradox has, to some extent, been resolved by comparing the rates of absorption of the various sumatriptan formulations, rather than the absolute amounts of drug that they deliver.

==History==
In 1991, Glaxo received approval for sumatriptan, which was the first available triptan.

In July 2009, the US FDA approved a single-use jet injector formulation of sumatriptan. The device delivers a subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan, without the use of a needle. Autoinjectors with needles have been previously available in Europe and North America.

Phase III studies with an iontophoretic transdermal patch (Zelrix/Zecuity) started in July 2008. This patch uses low voltage controlled by a pre-programmed microchip to deliver a single dose of sumatriptan through the skin within 30 minutes. Zecuity was approved by the US FDA in January 2013. Sales of Zecuity have been stopped following reports of skin burns and irritation.

== Society and culture ==
=== Legal status ===
In the United States, it is available only by medical prescription. It is available over the counter in many states in Australia. The product requires labelling by a pharmacist and is only available in packs of two without a medical prescription. However, it can be bought over the counter in the UK and Sweden.

In Russia, versions of sumatriptan which are not registered in the State Register of Medicines may be regarded as narcotic drugs (derivatives of dimethyltryptamine).

===Generics===
Glaxo patents for sumatriptan expired in February 2009. At that time, Imitrex sold for about $25 a pill. Par Pharmaceutical then introduced generic versions of sumatriptan injection (sumatriptan succinate injection) 4- and 6-mg starter kits and 4- and 6-mg filled syringe cartridges, and 6-mg vials soon after.

Mylan Laboratories Inc., Ranbaxy Laboratories, Sandoz (a subsidiary of Novartis), Dr. Reddy&#x27;s Laboratories, and other companies have been producing generic versions of sumatriptan tablets in 25-, 50-, and 100-mg doses. Generic forms of the drug are available in U.S. and European markets after Glaxo&#x27;s patent protections expired in the respective countries. A nasal spray form of sumatriptan known as AVP-825 has been developed by Avanir and is generically available in some countries.

=== Controversy ===
According to the American Headache Society, &quot;Patients frequently state that they have difficulty accessing triptans prescribed to them.&quot; In the U.S. triptans cost from $12 to $120 each, and more than 80% of U.S. health insurance plans place a limit on the amount of pills available to a patient per month, which has been called &quot;arbitrary and unfair.&quot;

<text>Korossy is a Hungarian surname. Some variations of the spelling of this surname are as follows: Kőrösi, Kőrösy, Kőrössi, Kőrössy, Körösi, Körösy, Körössi, Körössy, Korosi, Korosy, Korossi, and Korossy.

The surname appears to be based on the Hungarian word &quot;körös&quot;. By definition, the word means round/circular. Geographically, it is the name of a river (Körös) as well as the Hungarian name of the town of Križevci, Croatia. In addition, the Hungarian towns of Kiskőrös and Nagykőrös are often commonly referred to as &quot;Kőrös&quot; – as &quot;ő&quot; is simply the long variant of &quot;ö&quot; with the difference being almost negligible.

Following Hungarian grammar rules, the addition of the letter &quot;i&quot; to the end of some words implies a belonging, hence the word &quot;Körösi&quot; would translate to &quot;of/from Körös&quot;.

In the late Middle Ages, it was common for Hungarian noble families with names derived in a similar way from a toponym to spell their names with &quot;y&quot; at the end instead of &quot;i&quot;, and/or with a doubled consonant before it. Thus was the surname Körösi changed to Körösy / Körössi / Körössy by some families. Later the name has also been anglicized, by dropping the diacritics from the letters &quot;ö&quot; and &quot;ő&quot;, by families migrating to countries where the alphabet did not support these letters.

Notable people with the surname include: 
*Anita Potocskáné Kőrösi (1981–), Hungarian politician
*Csaba Kőrösi (1958–), Hungarian diplomat
*Albert Kálmán Kőrössy (1869–1955), Hungarian architect
*János Kőrössy (1926–2013), Romanian jazz musician
*Joseph Körösi (1811–1868), Hungarian-born Austrian industrialist

<text>Margaret (; 5 July 1522 – 18 January 1586) was Duchess of Parma from 1547 to 1586 as the wife of Duke Ottavio Farnese and Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1559 to 1567 and from 1578 to 1582. She was the illegitimate daughter of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and Johanna Maria van der Gheynst. She had briefly been Duchess of Florence from 1536 to 1537 by her first marriage to Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Florence. 

== Biography ==
Margaret&#x27;s mother, Johanna Maria van der Gheynst, a servant of Count Charles de Lalaing, Seigneur de Montigny, was a Fleming. Margaret was brought up in Mechelen, under the supervision of two powerful Spanish and Austrian Habsburg Imperial family relatives, her great-aunt, the Archduchess Margaret of Austria, and her aunt Mary of Austria, who were successive governors of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1507 to 1530 and from 1530 to 1555, respectively.
Her early life followed a strict routine set forth by her father, Charles V, who used his daughter as part of his plans to secure his empire.

In 1527, the year she turned five, she became engaged to the nephew of Pope Clement VII, Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Florence, to assist her father&#x27;s ambition in gaining influence in Italy. The marriage negotiations had been initiated in 1526, and in 1529, the agreement was officially signed by her father and the Pope. In 1529, Margaret was acknowledged by her father and allowed to assume the name Margaret of Austria, and in 1533, the 11-year-old girl was brought to live in Italy and educated in the courts of Florence, Rome, and Parma. There, she was taught skills that helped her grow as an independent woman. As Margaret did not spend much time with her husband, she used this time to become exposed to the surrounding Italian culture. Though she was multi-lingual, she preferred the Italian language for the rest of her life.

On 13 June 1536 in Florence, she married Alessandro, who was assassinated on 6 January 1537. On 4 November 1538 in Rome, the 15-year-old widow married Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma, the 14-year-old grandson of Pope Paul III. At first she refused to marry him. Although the union proved an unhappy one, it gave her years of experience in Rome, and produced twin sons, one of whom died in infancy. She would continue her studies of the arts and politics while being married to Ottavio. The couple lived separately for much of their lives, and Margaret maintained her own court and chapel. She was in a somewhat difficult position, as the Pope and the Emperor argued about authority over Parma. In 1555, the Farnese family were acknowledged as rulers of Parma by Spain in exchange for the custody of her son.
In 1555, she left Italy for the Habsburg Netherlands, where she left her son in the care of her half-brother Philip II. Philip appointed her Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands when he left in 1559 for Spain. As governor, Margaret faced the rising storm of discontent against the Inquisition and Spanish despotism, and Philip had left her but nominal authority. He was determined to pursue his own arbitrary course, and the result was the revolt of the Netherlands. Margaret was forced to adjust herself to the advice of Cardinal Granvelle, Philip&#x27;s choice for her chief councilor, who would grow to be greatly disliked in the Habsburg Netherlands. After Granvelle&#x27;s exile from the Habsburg Netherlands in 1564, Margaret was forced to rely on the grandees in her Council. In 1565, an opposition party was formed from the Dutch nobility. Margaret received its complaints and, having no army to put down the dissenters, promised to stop religious repression. In 1566, Iconoclastic riots took place all over the Habsburg Netherlands but she managed to quell them, with the help of her stadtholders Philip of Noircarmes (who subjugated the cities of Tournai and Valenciennes) in Hainaut and William of Orange in Holland. The next year, Philip sent her military help led by the Duke of Alba. Margaret warned Philip that actions by Alba would lead to catastrophe, but instead of trying to stop Alba, she resigned when she learned that Alba&#x27;s power of attorney, granted by Philip, superseded her own.

In 1567, Margaret retired to L&#x27;Aquila in Italy. She was appointed Governor of Abruzzo and Viceroy of Naples,where she had inherited a domain from her late husband. She acted as the adviser to her son and to her royal bastard half-brother, John of Austria. In 1578, her son Alexander Farnese was appointed to the office of governor-general of the Habsburg Netherlands; Philip appointed her his co-regent, intending that they would balance each other. However, they were unable to work together, and Margaret retired to Namur in 1582. She was given permission by Philip to return to Italy in 1583. She died in Ortona in 1586 and was buried in the church of S. Sisto in Piacenza.

Charlie R. Steen describes her as &quot;a woman dedicated to compromise and conciliation in public affairs.&quot; 

She personally asked to Pope Paul III to authorize the veneration of the Seven archangels while Antonio del Duca did the same under the protection of the Colonna family.

== Issue ==

Margaret and her second husband Ottavio had:
* Charles Farnese (, , ; 27 August 1545 – September 1545), heir to the Duchy of Parma.
* Alexander Farnese (27 August 1545 – 3 December 1592), 3rd Duke of Parma; married Infanta Maria of Portugal and had issue.

==Coat of arms==
Margaret of Austria, as Duchess of Florence and Parma, chose for her device a pearl shining from its shell, with the motto, &quot;Decus allatura coronae&quot; (&quot;About to bring glory to the crown&quot;).

<doc id="600261" wikidata="Q83755" url="?curid=600261" title="Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio">
<text>Liaozhai zhiyi, sometimes shortened to Liaozhai, known in English as Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio, Strange Tales from Make-Do Studio, or literally Strange Tales from a Studio of Leisure, is a collection of Classical Chinese stories by Qing dynasty writer Pu Songling, comprising close to 500 stories or &quot;marvel tales&quot; in the &quot;zhiguai&quot; and &quot;chuanqi&quot; styles, which according to some critics, served to implicitly criticise societal problems. Written over a period of forty years from the late 1600s and ending in the early 1700s, it circulated in manuscripts that were copied and recopied among the author&#x27;s friends but did not appear in print until 1766. Since then, many of the critically lauded stories have been adapted for other media such as film and television.

==Publication history==
Pu assembled the nearly five hundred short and lengthy tales over a period of forty years between the early 1670s and the early 1700s. As was the convention of his time, Pu titled his work using the sobriquet &quot;Liaozhai&quot; (), translated into English as the &quot;Studio of Conversation&quot; or &quot;Studio of Leisure&quot;.

The scholar Zhang Peiheng () writes that the original &quot;Liaozhai&quot; comprised eight volumes, the earliest completed around 1681 and the latest completed between 1707 and 1714. The compilation was first circulated in scribal copies but it was not published until after the author&#x27;s death in 1715. Around 1693, Shandong financial commissioner Yu Chenglong reportedly offered Pu a thousand taels in exchange for his &quot;Liaozhai&quot; manuscript, but Pu declined his offer.

The final manuscript was &quot;carefully preserved&quot; by the Pu family after his death, with many different individuals, including the local magistrate, requesting to make copies of it. The earliest surviving print version of &quot;Liaozhai&quot; was printed in 1766 in Hangzhou by publisher Zhao Qigao (), who claimed that Pu originally intended for his anthology to be titled &quot;Tales of Ghosts and Foxes&quot; (). Although Zhao also alleged that his publication was based on the &quot;original manuscript&quot; as was copied by a friend, it did not contain all the stories found in the original manuscript; in the preface to his publication, he writes, &quot;I have expunged simple and brief notes which are dull and commonplace, forty-eight in all.&quot; Moreover, Zhao censored stories that had &quot;brief references to sensitive topics&quot;. Nonetheless, the Zhao edition was well-received and was first republished by scholar Li Shixian () in 1767.

At some point after 1871, Pu Jieren (), a seventh-generation descendant of Pu Songling, had the original manuscript, which was reportedly made up of twenty volumes, rebound in eight volumes. They were then kept in two boxes, one of which disappeared &quot;under circumstances which are still obscure&quot;. In 1950, the Pu family donated the surviving four volumes, which contained some 237 short stories, to the Liaoning Provincial Library.

==Themes==
Unlike much Chinese and Western horror fiction, the &quot;scary stories&quot; in &quot;Liaozhai&quot; are not intended to be frightening, but to blur the borders between the supernatural and everyday reality, using physical and psychological detail to make the move between these realms seem natural. These tales, which are &quot;works rich in romanticism&quot;, explore the philosophical concept of &quot;qing&quot; (情), the passionate and emotional entanglement of the world, be it human or supernatural.

==Literary significance==
&quot;Liaozhai zhiyi&quot; is the most acclaimed Chinese &quot;supernatural tales&quot; collection since the three major Ming dynasty &quot;hua&quot; (話) collections, which are the &quot;Jiandeng Xinhua&quot; (剪燈新話) by Qu You, the &quot;Jiandeng Yuhua&quot; (剪燈餘話) by Li Changqi, and the &quot;Mideng Yinhua&quot; (覓燈因話) by Shao Jingzhan; these three had a far-reaching impact across East Asia.

Early commentary on &quot;Liaozhai&quot; regarded it as a &quot;superior but typical example&quot; of the &quot;zhiguai&quot; genre. Subsequent critics and writers disagreed with such a view, instead focusing on the allegorical nature of the stories instead; for instance, Yu Ji, who was Zhao Qigao&#x27;s secretary, wrote in his preface to Zhao&#x27;s edition of &quot;Liaozhai&quot;: &quot;... saying that it differs little from collections of rare phenomena or strange tales is a very shallow view and one that greatly contradicts the author&#x27;s intent.&quot; Pu&#x27;s grandson, Pu Lide (), viewed the work as &quot;an act of serious self-expression&quot;.

Still later critics in the nineteenth century focused on the &quot;literary style and narrative technique&quot; of &quot;Liaozhai&quot;. Qing dynasty critic Dan Minglun () writes in the preface to his 1842 interlinear commentary of &quot;Liaozhai&quot;: &quot;From &quot;Liaozhai&quot;, I also gained insight into literary methods.&quot; Around the same period, &quot;Liaozhai&quot; also attracted critical attention from Western writers, for example, Samuel Wells Williams mentioned &quot;Liaozhai&quot; in his writings as &quot;a perfect work with pure language and elegant style&quot; and its &quot;beautiful writing style&quot; has also received praises from the likes of William Frederick Mayers and Karl Gützlaff.

Since the 20th century, its literary status was further elevated. Guo Moruo said of &quot;Liaozhai&quot; that &quot;The writing of ghosts and demons is superior to all others; the satire on corruption and tyranny is penetrating to the marrow.&quot; Yuken Fujita of Keio University wrote in 1954 that &quot;Among the many literary works that are descended from ancient Chinese fiction [i.e. &quot;Bowuzhi&quot;, &quot;Soushen Ji&quot;, &quot;Shishuo Xinyu&quot;, &quot;Lieyi Zhuan&quot;, &quot;Shi Yi Ji&quot;, etc.], it [&quot;Liaozhai&quot;] has already established a reputation as the most outstanding short story collection.&quot; Hiromasa Imai describes &quot;Liaozhai&quot; as &quot;the pinnacle of ghost literature.&quot; &quot;Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio&quot; was also listed by Jorge Luis Borges as one of his favorite books.

==Influence==
Following &quot;Liaozhai zhiyi&quot;&#x27;s critical and commercial success, other well-received &quot;wonder tale&quot; and &quot;fantasy&quot; story collections also soon appeared, creating a publishing craze for such literature in China well into the 19th century. Some notable major collections include Yuan Mei&#x27;s &quot;Zibuyu&quot; (&quot;What the Master Would Not Discuss&quot;, 1788), Shen Qifeng&#x27;s &quot;Xie Duo&quot; (1791), Ji Yun&#x27;s &quot;Yuewei caotang biji&quot; (&quot;Notes of the Thatched Abode of Close Observations&quot;, 1789-1798 &amp; 1800) and Wang Tao&#x27;s &quot;Songyin manlu&quot; (1875).

====Giles&#x27;s translation====
John Minford and Tong Man describe Herbert Giles&#x27;s translation as &quot;prudish&quot;, because he chose not to translate &quot;anything connected with sex, procreation, blood, sometimes indeed the human body in any of its aspects&quot; and often made &quot;extraordinary lengths to cover up his traces, showing considerable craft and cunning.&quot; In the Giles translation fox spirits wish to chat and share tea with people rather than trying to seduce and engage in sexual intercourse, and romantic partners at most exchange kisses. They wrote that &quot;Giles was a creature of his time&quot; since he was required to follow Victorian Era morality, and urged readers to &quot;not get Giles&#x27; bowdlerising of &quot;Liao-chai&quot; out of proportion.&quot; They added that &quot;the widely distributed Commercial Press (HK) edition of the stories makes many of the same prudish cuts as Giles.&quot;

Minford and Tong Man write that people have continued reading Giles&#x27;s translations even though they &quot;have been at best quietly tolerated, more often derided, and dismissed as orientalist bowdlerisations...&quot; Lydia Chiang describes Minford and Tong Man&#x27;s essay as a &quot;post-Saidian re-evaluation&quot; that compares the Giles translation to traditional and modern Chinese representations of the story.

===German===
Martin Buber made the first German translation of the work, included within his &quot;Chinesische Geister- und Liebesgeschichten&quot;. Buber had assistance from a person named Wang Jingdao. Buber stated in the preface of his translation that his translation had portions previously untranslated in Giles work because Giles, according to the &quot;English custom&quot;, had &quot;omitted or paraphrased all passages which seemed to him indecorous&quot;. The &quot;Chinesische Geister- und Liebesgeschichten&quot; was translated into English by Alex Page, published in 1991 by the Humanities Press.

===Other translations===
Vasily Mikhaylovich Alekseyev published an acclaimed translation of Pu Songling&#x27;s stories in Russian in two volumes, &quot;Fox&#x27;s Wiles&quot; (1922) and &quot;The Wizard Monks&quot; (1923). It has been cited as the most accomplished translation of the book into a foreign language. The book was translated into Manchu as &quot;Sonjofi ubaliyambuha Liyoo jai jy i bithe&quot;. Lodovico Nicola di Giura (1868–1947) produced a complete Italian translation of the 1766 edition.

==Illustrated editions==
In the 19th century, colorful and fully illustrated collector&#x27;s editions of &quot;Liaozhai zhiyi&quot; also circulated onto the literary scenes. These exquisitely mounted illustrated &quot;Liaozhai&quot; are now collected by major libraries and museums around the world, such as the National Library of China and Library of Congress.

==Adaptations==
* &quot;Liaozhai Zhiyi&quot; has inspired many Chinese film adaptations, including those by King Hu (&quot;Painted Skin&quot;, &quot;A Touch of Zen&quot;), Gordon Chan (&quot;Painted Skin, Mural&quot;), Ching Siu-tung (&quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; series) and the Taiwanese director Li Han-Hsiang (&quot;The Enchanting Shadow&quot;).

<text>Sokcho (; ) is a city and major tourist hub located in the northeast of Gangwon Province, South Korea.

== History ==
From around the 3rd century to the early 5th century AD, Sokcho was part of Dongye. Originally a sparsely inhabited fishing village on the shores of Lake Cheongchoho, it became a major port due to its location on the Sea of Japan. Sokcho later became a mineral transfer port in 1937.

When the Korean peninsula was divided into two countries following World War II, Sokcho was placed under North Korean control, before being captured by the South Korean army on August 18, 1951. Since the Korean Armistice Agreement (1953), it has been a part of South Korea.

==Tourism==

===Seoraksan National Park===

Seoraksan National Park is located in the vicinity of Sokcho and attracts local and international tourists. The city is known for its beach, natural hot springs, golf courses, and fine fishery products.

===Lakes===
Sokcho is home to two lakes, Yeongrangho and Cheongchoho. Y&quot;eongrangho&quot; lake is renowned for its beauty. The reflection of Mt. Seorak and Ulsanbawi are particularly popular.

Marina Yacht is located in Cheongchoho Lake Park and provides yachting tours on the Sea of Japan. The tours start and finish at Cheongcho Marina, passing Seorakdaegyo Bridge, and Dongmyeonghang Port, Jodo. Marina Yacht rents boats to people with a boat license; it also has a café.

Yeongrangho Hwarangdo Center provides various experiences, including horse riding. Daepo harbour is located in Daepo-dong, Sokcho. Its attractions include a sea fountain and beach cable car.

===Buddhist temples===

There are a number of well-preserved Buddhist temples in the area around Sokcho. The main building of the &quot;Sinheungsa&quot; temple (&quot;Geukrakbojeon&quot;) is a major tourist destination (originally built in the 15th century). Also notable is the &quot;Hyangseongsaji samcheung seoktap -&quot; a three-storey pagoda of 4.3 metres. It dates from 652 and is located at the site of the &quot;Hyangseongsa&quot; temple. &quot;Yeonggeumjeong&quot;, a pavilion built on the shores of Sokcho, is popular for its views of the sunrise.

===Traditional village===

Abai village near Seoraksan was originally established to house North Korean refugees due to the separation of Korea. Consequently, many of the inhabitants have relatives in North Korea. The village has seen increased tourism due to the popularity of Korean Drama &quot;Autumn in My Heart&quot; on KBS.

===Festivals===
In 1999, the Gangwon International Tourism Expo was held in Sokcho. In July 2016, Sokcho became one of the few locations in South Korea where &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; could be played due to government restrictions on mapping data. Players flocked to the city, causing public transport tickets to sell out. Many tourists are also attracted by the close proximity of the DMZ.

==Infrastructure==

===Airport===

Sokcho used to have its own airport, linking the city to Seoul. Currently, the city is served by the Yangyang International Airport.

===Station===
The opening of KTX Gyeonggang Line has made it convenient for travellers to visit Gangwon Province, a 86-minute train ride from Seoul.

===Stadium===
*Sokcho Stadium

== Food ==

Sokcho&#x27;s traditional market, established in 1953 as the Sokcho Tourist &amp; Fishery Market, offers a variety of items for sale, including fresh fish, dried fish, and various vegetables. It was recently included in the Korea Tourism Organization&#x27;s list of &quot;Best Traditional Markets for Foreign Tourists&quot;. The market is notable for its vibrant atmosphere, where visitors can observe fishmongers bargaining with local shoppers.

Sokcho is known for Hoe, which is a raw fish. The coastal waters provide good fishing grounds for Ojingeo, Myeongtae, Gwangeo and Godeungeo.

Sundubu can be found in the streets of the tofu towns such as Sinheung Sundubu and Haksapyeong Sundubu — it is made from Seoraksan and water from the Sea of Japan.

Sokcho offers a unique twist to Sundae (not the eponymous dessert) by using Ojingeo instead of pork intestines. The Ojingeo-sundae consists of squid stir-fry, made with noodles and blood sausage, with carrots, onions, seaweed and spices mixed together, covered with thin fried egg yolk.

==Culture==
Local cuisine can be experienced in the various food districts of the city. &quot;Foodtown&quot; is a two block area dedicated to restaurants where visitors can find mainly Korean style beef pork and chicken restaurants. Daepo harbor, outside of Sokcho on the road to Yangyang offers more than 100 individual mini restaurants serving diverse seafood dishes. An own unique stuffed squid dish, Abai Sundae, can be found in Abai village.

In October Sokcho comes to life with the Seorak Cultural Festival, which includes parades, stage shows, contests, races and various other forms of entertainment. The rice cake making sampling contests are particularly popular. Another unusual event is the Gaet-Bae, or raft, race. Two teams propel the rafts across the course by pulling on long handled hooks catching the cable that straddles the deck of each raft.

==Climate==
Sokcho straddles the line between a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) and a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;).

<doc id="600277" wikidata="Q444306" url="?curid=600277" title="Kathy Burke">
<text>Katherine Lucy Bridget Burke (born 13 June 1964) is an English actress and comedian. She appeared in sketch shows such as &quot;French and Saunders&quot; (1988–1999), played a recurring role as Magda on the BBC sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; (1992–2012), and performed frequent collaborations with fellow comedian Harry Enfield. From 1999 to 2001, she starred as Linda La Hughes on the BBC sitcom &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&quot;, for which she received a British Comedy Award and two BAFTA nominations.

Burke made her film debut in the 1982 drama &quot;Scrubbers&quot;. For her portrayal of Valerie in the 1997 film &quot;Nil by Mouth&quot;, she won Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Her other film appearances include &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; (1986), &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; (1998), &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998), &quot;This Year&#x27;s Love&quot; (1999), &quot;Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large&quot; (2000), &quot;The Martins&quot; (2001), &quot;Anita and Me&quot; (2002) and &quot;Once Upon a Time in the Midlands&quot; (2002). Having spent most of the 2000s concentrating on her work as a theatre director, she returned to film roles in the 2010s with &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (2011), &quot;Pan&quot; (2015) and &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot; (2016). Starting from 2019, Burke fronted a series of documentaries for Channel 4: &quot;Kathy Burke&#x27;s All Woman&quot; (2019), &quot;Kathy Burke: Money Talks&quot; (2021) and &quot;Kathy Burke: Growing Up&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Burke was born at the Royal Free Hospital, London, on 13 June 1964, and was brought up in Islington, North London, by her Irish Catholic parents Paddy and Bridget. She has two elder brothers. Her mother, known as Bridie, died of cancer when Burke was two years old. She lived with her father, a builder who was an alcoholic, and attended the Maria Fidelis Convent School, a secondary school in Euston, until she was 16 years old. She then studied at the Anna Scher Theatre School in Islington.

==Career==
Burke&#x27;s first role was in the 1982 film &quot;Scrubbers&quot;, directed by Swedish actress Mai Zetterling and featuring Pam St. Clement, Robbie Coltrane, Miriam Margolyes, Honey Bane, Debby Bishop and Eva Mottley. The film was set in a young offenders&#x27; institute for girls and was seen as a female version of the film &quot;Scum&quot;.

Burke appeared in a non-speaking role in a 1985 public information film about heroin addiction. The following year she appeared in a non-speaking role as &#x27;witness in doorway&#x27; in an award-winning advert for &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s &#x27;Points of View&#x27;.

Burke first became familiar to television audiences as a player of minor roles in sketches by better-known performers such as Harry Enfield, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders. Early TV work included regular appearances on the chat show &quot;The Last Resort&quot; hosted by Jonathan Ross on UK Channel 4 in the mid-1980s, playing the characters &#x27;Tina Bishop&#x27; and &#x27;Perry the Pre-pubescent Schoolboy&quot;. Bishop was a continually pregnant &quot;expert&quot; offering advice on household chores, always with disastrous results. Both Perry and Tina (renamed &quot;Waynetta Slob&quot;) later re-appeared as recurring sketch characters in Harry Enfield programmes. Along with French and Saunders, she has contributed to two Comic Relief charity singles. She first appeared as a member of Bananarama parody band Lananeeneenoonoo in 1989, and then as a member of Spice Girls look-alike band the Sugar Lumps in 1997. 

In real life Burke was a big fan of Morrissey and appeared in the video for his 1989 single &quot;Ouija Board, Ouija Board&quot; and later in the 2002 Channel 4 documentary &quot;The Importance of Being Morrissey&quot;. On the 7 November 2023 episode of her &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will There&#x27;s a Wake&quot; podcast, with Dolly Alderton as her guest, Burke admitted &quot;&quot;We don&#x27;t like Morrissey anymore...because he&#x27;s a racist wanker&quot;. Alderton shared Burke&#x27;s disappointment with Morrissey&#x27;s views with Burke adding &quot;We idolise these people...but then people are three-dimensional and you get to know what they really think about life and it&#x27;s just always a disappointment.&quot;&quot; 

She became successful in her own right and although mainly associated with comedy, she has played several serious roles including that of Queen Mary Tudor in the film &quot;Elizabeth,&quot; which was released in 1998.

In 1994 Burke was awarded the Royal Television Society Award for Best Actress, for her performance as the mute Martha in the 1993 BBC TV series &quot;Mr. Wroe&#x27;s Virgins&quot;. The series was directed by Danny Boyle and is based on Jane Rogers&#x27; book about John Wroe.

Burke won the Best Actress award at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for her role in the gritty drama &quot;Nil by Mouth&quot;. Burke was so convinced she would not win that she made no plans to attend the ceremony; when told shortly beforehand she had won, she found her passport was out of date. The film also earned her a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role. From 1999 to 2001 she appeared as Linda La Hughes in the BBC TV series &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&quot; (which she developed with writer Jonathan Harvey) where she was nominated for three British Comedy Awards (winning one), two BAFTA TV Awards and a National Television Award for her performance. In 2000, she appeared in the cult film &quot;Love Honour and Obey&quot; with Ray Burdis, and as Perry in the comedy film &quot;Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large.&quot;

In 2003, she was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.

Beginning in 2001, she refrained from acting and began theatre directing; something she considers to be one of her true passions. She said in an interview with Dawn French in &quot;Dawn French&#x27;s Girls Who Do Comedy&quot; that she no longer felt the same creative energy associated with acting that she used to have (she described it as a &quot;feeling in my belly&quot;) and that this was the reason she had stopped acting. However, since then, she has done some voiceover work, including UK TV adverts for Ski yoghurt (2005) and the voice of Rita&#x27;s mum in the animated film &quot;Flushed Away&quot; (2006). She also appeared in the 2007 Christmas Special of &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot; as Nan&#x27;s daughter Diane.

In February 1990, she wrote and directed &quot;Mr Thomas&quot; at the Old Red Lion Theatre. It was filmed and shown on Channel 4 the next year.

In 2007, Burke contracted Clostridioides difficile while in hospital for an operation, resulting in her having to pass directing duties on &quot;Dying for It&quot; at the Almeida Theatre (which starred Charlie Condou and Sophie Stanton who she worked with on &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&quot;).

In 2009, Burke made her television directorial debut with the BBC Three sketch show series &quot;Horne &amp; Corden&quot;, starring Mathew Horne and James Corden.

Burke wrote and appeared as a nun in the short autobiographical film &quot;Better Than Christmas&quot; for Sky 1&#x27;s &quot;Little Crackers&quot;, a collection of comic shorts that aired in December 2010. On 19 January 2012, it was announced that Burke had written her first TV series; her short for &quot;Little Crackers&quot; had led to the four-part series &quot;Walking and Talking&quot;, based on her teenage years. Burke appeared as a nun in each episode of the series, which aired in the summer of 2012 on Sky Atlantic.

In 2011, Burke played Connie Sachs in the film adaptation of the novel &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot;. She was long-listed for a BAFTA nomination for her performance as Supporting Actress in 2012.

Burke appeared in the 2015 Peter Pan prequel film &quot;Pan&quot;,as Mother Barnabas. In November 2015, Burke presented the BBC topical news panel show &quot;Have I Got News for You.

In 2019, Burke starred in her own self-titled three-part documentary &quot;Kathy Burke&#x27;s All Woman&quot;. The programme aired on Channel 4 and focused on the stereotypes and expectations of modern women. Burke touched on subjects such as marriage, pregnancy and cosmetic surgery.

In 2021, Burke appeared as a guest judge in series 3 of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race UK&quot;.

Burke directed ITV&#x27;s four-part murder mystery series &quot;Holding&quot;, which premiered on 14 March 2022 and is based on Graham Norton&#x27;s novel of the same name.

in 2022 Burke started a podcast called &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will, There&#x27;s a Wake&quot;. In the podcast Burke talks a guest through how the guest believes (or hopes) they will die and what they want to be done for their funeral. Notable guests have been Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, Emerald Fennell and Steve McQueen. The podcast is produced by Sony Music Entertainment.

<text>Yangyang County () is in Gangwon Province, South Korea. The county is located in the northeast of the country in Gangwon-do. Its population is about 31,000 (2004).

The Yangyang area is well known for its pine mushrooms (&quot;song-i&quot;), its fish—particularly salmon—and its sunrises.

==Overview==

In 2002, Yangyang opened its own airport, serving Gangneung to the south and Sokcho to the north. It was intended for the many tourists attracted by the Seorak-san national park. The airport was closed in 2009 due to a lack of passengers, but reopened a year later.

The county is proud to unite the five major religions of Korea: Confucianism, Buddhism, Shamanism, Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. There are sites for all these faiths in Yangyang. &quot;Seonghwangsa&quot; is a shamanistic altar which was traditionally used for sacrificial rites. &quot;Yangyang Hyanggyo&quot; is a Confucian school built in 1340. Today the school mainly serves as a shrine, but classes are still held there. In 1921, &quot;Yangyang Cathedral&quot; was built. During the Korean War it was burnt to the ground but rebuilt afterwards.

The county is also proud of its five-day market. It is the largest traditional market in the area and renowned for the quality of its produce. The market is held on days ending in 4 and 9.

<doc id="600291" wikidata="Q271848" url="?curid=600291" title="Diane Varsi">
<text>Diane Marie Antonia Varsi (February 23, 1938 – November 19, 1992) was an American film actress best known for her performances in &quot;Peyton Place&quot; – her film debut, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award – and the cult film &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot;. She left Hollywood to pursue personal and artistic aims, notably at Bennington College in Vermont, where she studied poetry with poet and translator Ben Belitt.

==Early life==
Varsi was born in San Mateo, California, a suburb of San Francisco, the daughter of Beatrice (née DeMerchant) and Russell Varsi. Varsi unsuccessfully tried to become a model and a restaurant hostess in her teen years. While in high school, she was called an &quot;oddball&quot; by her classmates. She often was truant from school to visit San Francisco, so was labeled a &quot;rebel&quot;. She dropped out of school in her junior year at age 15, failing in all studies, and saying: &quot;I was bored. I didn&#x27;t like the social sides – the cliques.&quot; Around the same time, she married an 18-year-old. Their marriage was annulled before her son Shawn was born.

She joined the San Francisco ballet in the 1950s and initially planned to become a folk singer. She later hitchhiked to Los Angeles with a friend.

==&quot;Peyton Place&quot;==

Despite having only experience as an actress in a stage production of &quot;Gigi&quot;, she made her screen debut at age 18 as Allison MacKenzie in &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1957), receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. The following year, Varsi shared the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress with Sandra Dee and Carolyn Jones. Several famous actresses were tested for the main role in the big-budget film, until the then-unknown Varsi was cast in May 1957. She was discovered by producer Buddy Adler, who immediately put her under contract at 20th Century Fox.

==Career==
By the time she was cast, Varsi already had an agent and had been searching for film roles for a long while, without any luck. She made rounds at several studios, but according to the actress, they all thought she was suitable for character parts only. She was even dropped by her agent in 1956, because he saw no future in her career.

Before &quot;Peyton Place&quot; was released, Adler cast Varsi opposite Don Murray in &quot;From Hell to Texas&quot; (1958). She appeared in the films &quot;Ten North Frederick&quot; (1958) and &quot;Compulsion&quot; (1959). While filming &quot;Ten North Frederick&quot;, Varsi suffered a nervous breakdown, collapsed, and was hospitalized. She later said: &quot;I&#x27;m still trying to find myself. It&#x27;s still hard for me to separate illusion from reality...I don&#x27;t know whether acting is the form of creativity best for me.&quot;
Varsi rejected the role of Meg in the comedy film &quot;Holiday for Lovers&quot; in January 1959. On March 18, 1959, she suddenly left Hollywood, abandoning her contract. &quot;I&#x27;m running away from destruction,&quot; she explained, saying it concerned other people, as well. A week later she elaborated, &quot;Hollywood is too impressed with superficial cheapness.&quot; Nevertheless, her contract with Fox did not expire until 1965. Her sudden walkout was for a long time rumored to be a publicity stunt to promote the sequel to &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot; (1961), to which Varsi was attached.

By walking out of her contract, Varsi&#x27;s inclusion in plans for several films was cancelled, including a starring role in &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; (1959). After leaving Hollywood, Varsi participated in local San Francisco theater productions. At some point thereafter, she made her way to New York long enough to successfully audition for the Actors Studio, which she would attend at least briefly in 1965. Varsi returned to film acting in the late 1960s, but by this time she was no longer offered major roles and subsequently referred to the movies she made in this period as &quot;cheap films of little merit&quot;. Although producers were curious about her, she said, they would not hire her. Her later films include the influential cult film &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot; (1968); &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; (1971), which Varsi described as her favorite; and an &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot;, titled &quot;The People&quot; (1972). In 1970, she was a supporting actress to Shelley Winters in Bloody Mama; Robert DeNiro also appeared in the film as one of Ma Barker&#x27;s sons. Of &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;, the actress said: &quot;This is the kind of thing I always wanted to do. It comes very late to me. It&#x27;s been a long time to wait.&quot; She was apprehensive about playing the role, saying: &quot;I felt too inadequate to do [&quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;]. It&#x27;s so intense, the responsibility.&quot;

==Personal life==
While in Hollywood, Varsi was known for being unglamorous, wearing no makeup or expensive clothes. She avoided Hollywood parties and was quoted as saying: &quot;I&#x27;d rather meet Aldous Huxley than Clark Gable.&quot; Her fellow Fox actors remembered her as &quot;a frightened, birdlike girl who was bewildered by her sudden success&quot; and as &quot;disillusioned by the way certain studio officials treated her&quot;. She dated Russ Tamblyn, her co-star in &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, following the film&#x27;s release.

From November 26, 1956, to August 29, 1958, Varsi was married to James Dickson, whom she made her manager while working as an actress. She then married Michael Hausman on May 21, 1961; they had a daughter, Willo.

==Death==
On November 19, 1992 in Los Angeles, Varsi died of respiratory failure at the age of 54. She also suffered from Lyme disease. She is buried at Mount Tamalpais Cemetery in San Rafael, California.

<text>Serge Daney (; June 4, 1944, Paris – June 12, 1992) was a French movie critic. He was a major figure of &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; which he co-edited in the late 1970s. He also wrote extensively about films, television, and society in the newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; and founded the quarterly review &quot;Trafic&quot; shortly before his death. Highly regarded in French and European film criticism circles, his work remained little known to English-speaking audiences until recent translations. A first book-long interview, &quot;Postcards from the Cinema&quot;, was published in 2007 and a collection of his writings prior to 1982, &quot;The Cinema House and the World&quot;, was published in 2022.

==Biography==
At the Lycée Voltaire in Paris, Daney received his first film teachings from Henri Agel, one of the most respected critics of the time. With two high school friends, Louis Skorecki and Claude Dépêche, he founded a short-lived film magazine called &quot;Visages du cinéma&quot; which only saw two editions, on Howard Hawks (containing Daney&#x27;s first published text - a review of &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; called &quot;An Adult Art&quot;) and on Otto Preminger.

In 1964, Daney joined the French film magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; with a series of interviews of American film directors (notably Howard Hawks, Leo McCarey, Josef von Sternberg and Jerry Lewis) conducted with Jean Louis Noames (aka Louis Skorecki) during a trip to Hollywood. He writes regularly for the magazine which was moving on from its &quot;yellow cover” beginnings (the time of André Bazin, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Éric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette - roughly 1951-1959) and was about to enter a period of heavy theoretical debates and radical political engagement after 1968.

Between 1968 and 1971, Daney also makes a series of travels to India, Morocco and Africa and starts lecturing cinema at the Censier University (Paris III). After &quot;Cahiers&quot;’ failure to create a “Revolutionary Cultural Front”, Daney took the responsibility of the magazine in 1973, supported by Serge Toubiana. Together, they operated a &quot;return to cinema&quot; for the magazine and also invited thinkers from outside the field of cinema: Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière and Gilles Deleuze. He had frequent exchanges with Félix Guattari, Roland Barthes, and Claire Denis as well. 

In 1981, Daney left &quot;Cahiers&quot; for the French daily newspaper &quot;Libération&quot;, to which he had contributed occasionally since its creation in 1973. Writing first about cinema, his focus turns more and more towards television. In 1987, for a hundred days, he wrote daily about French television in a column called “The wage of the channel hopper”. From 1988 to 1991, he wrote a column on how films look when they are shown on television. He also wrote small pamphlets increasingly critical of television programs before he abandoned writing about television altogether in 1991, after a critical analysis of the television coverage of the Gulf War.

Daney went on to found the quarterly film magazine &quot;Trafic&quot; in which he wrote four pieces before dying of AIDS in June 1992.

Daney had other passions such as tennis and bullfights.

==Bibliography==
Daney published four books during his lifetime which are collections of his articles:
* &quot;La Rampe&quot; (Gallimard/Cahiers du cinéma, 1983) - translated in English as &quot;Footlights&quot; (Semiotexte(e), MIT Press, 2023).
* &quot;Ciné-journal&quot; (Cahiers du cinéma, 1986)
* &quot;Le Salaire du zappeur&quot; (P.O.L., 1988)
* &quot;Devant la recrudescence des vols des sacs à main&quot; (Aléas, 1991)

He also published a little-known book called &quot;Procès à Baby Doc, Duvalier père et fils&quot;, a 1973 polemic against the Duvalier regime in Haiti written under the pseudonym Raymond Sapène.

In the years after his death, several other books have been released:
* &quot;L&#x27;exercice a été profitable, Monsieur&quot; (P.O.L, 1993), a collection of the notes he took while watching French television in the early 1990s.
* &quot;Persévérance&quot; (P.O.L, 1994), Daney&#x27;s last project for a complete book for which he wrote the first chapter - the rest being the transcript of an interview with Serge Toubiana. It has been translated in English as &quot;Postcards from the Cinema&quot; (Berg, 2007).
* &quot;L&#x27;amateur de tennis&quot; (P.O.L, 1994), a selection of articles he wrote in Liberation about tennis matches.
* &quot;L’itinéraire d&#x27;un ciné-fils&quot; (Editions Jean-Michel Place, 1999), the transcript of the eponymous TV documentary.

Daney&#x27;s complete writings (i.e. those not in the books above) have been published in French by P.O.L: 
* &quot;La maison cinéma et le monde 1: Le temps des Cahiers (1962-1981)&quot;. An English translation was published in 2022 as &quot;The Cinema House and the World&quot; (Semiotext(e), MIT Press, 2022).
* &quot;La maison cinéma et le monde 2: Les années Libé 1 (1981-1985)&quot;
* &quot;La maison cinéma et le monde 3: Les années Libé 2 (1986-1991)&quot;
* &quot;La maison cinéma et le monde 4: Le moment Trafic (1991-1992)&quot;

<doc id="600295" wikidata="Q9003150" url="?curid=600295" title="Villas-Bôas brothers">
<text>Orlando (1914–2002) and his brothers Cláudio (1916–1998) and Leonardo Villas-Bôas (1918–1961) were Brazilian brothers who worked in indigenous activism. In 1961 they succeeded in getting the entire upper Xingu legally protected, making it the first massive indigenous area in all South America, and the prototype for dozens of similar reserves all over the continent.

==Pioneers==

The explorer John Hemming wrote that the Villas-Bôas were pioneers in many ways. They were almost the first non-missionaries to live permanently with the natives; and they treated them as their equals and friends. They persuaded tribes to end internecine feuds and unite to confront the encroaching settlement frontier. The Villas-Bôas were the first to appreciate the value of politics and the media in furthering the indigenous cause. They also devised a policy of &quot;change, but only at the speed the Indians want&quot;.

In the 1950s, Brazilian explorer and defender of indigenous people, Cândido Rondon, supported the Villas-Bôas brothers&#x27; campaign, which faced strong opposition from the government and the ranchers of Mato Grosso and led to the establishment of the first Brazilian National Park for indigenous people along the Xingu River in 1961.

Robin Hanbury-Tenison, from Survival International, wrote in 1971 that &quot;The Xingu is the only closed park in Brazil, which means that it is the only area in which Indians are safe from deliberate or accidental contact with undesirable representatives of Western civilization. This is due entirely to the Villas-Bôas brothers and the total dedication of their lives to this work over the last 25 years.&quot; Since 1971, more indigenous parks and reserves have been created, such as the Tumucumaque National Park (38,800 km2) in northern Pará state, but the Xingu park (26,400 km2) remains the most important of them.

The anthropologist Shelton Davis wrote that &quot;The Villas-Bôas brothers further argued that it was the responsibility of the federal government to provide a secure protective buffer, in the form of closed Indian parks and reserves, between Indians and the frontiers of national society. In time, the three brothers believed, Indians would integrate into Brazilian national society. This process of integration, however, should be a gradual one and should guarantee the Indians’s survival, ethnic identities and ways of life.&quot;

In the foreword of the book &quot;Xingu: the Indians, Their Myths&quot; the anthropologist Kenneth S. Brecher wrote that

It is now almost 30 years since the Villas-Bôas brothers (...) led the expedition known as &#x27;Brazil&#x27;s march to the West&#x27; which was intended to open up the heart of the interior for colonization. They were overwhelmed by the beauty and cultural richness of the network of Xingu tribes which they discovered, and when the expedition disbanded they remained in the jungle to protect the Xinguanos from the land speculators, state senators, diamond prospectors, skin hunters, and rubber gatherers who had followed in their wake. (...) That the Xingu tribes continue to exist, in fact to thrive, is due largely to the extreme dedication, intelligence, cunning, and physical strength of these brothers.

==Personal lives and deaths==
Of the 11 siblings, the three brothers banded together in their pioneering work, later supported by their younger brother Alvaro.

Orlando died in 2002. When a major chief dies, the Xingu Indians hold a great funerary festival (the Kuarup) in his honour. They did this for Orlando even though he was white. He had two sons, Noel and Orlando.

Claudio was born on December 8, 1916, in Botucatu, São Paulo and died of a stroke in his São Paulo apartment on March 1, 1998. Indians called him &quot;The Father&quot; and by 1994 there were 6000 Indians in 18 settlements from different tribes.
Leonardo died in 1961 at age 43.

Álvaro was born 1926 in São Paulo and worked with his brothers in the Xingu area from 1961 to 1962. He then settled in São Paulo, where he provided logistical support to his brothers&#x27; missions in the country&#x27;s interior. He assumed the presidency of FUNAI (Fundação Nacional do Índio) for a short period in 1985. Died in Bauru, São Paulo, on August 22, 1995.

==Awards and legacy==
Two of the Villas-Bôas brothers, Orlando and Cláudio, were jointly awarded the Royal Geographical Society’s gold medal in 1967, as much for their geographical explorations as for their humanitarian work. They also received the GEO prize from the president of Germany, Richard von Weizsäcker and the ex-Chancellor of West Germany Willy Brandt in 1984, in recognition of their humanitarian work. The two were twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971 and again in 1975.

Matupá Airport, in Matupá, Mato Grosso, Brazil is named after the brother Orlando.

The Villas-Bôas brothers are the main protagonists in Cao Hamburger&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Xingu&quot;.

In April 2014 the Brazilian graffiti artist Speto created an extensive artwork dedicated to the Villas-Bôas titled &quot;3 Brothers&quot; on 14 concrete pillars of the elevated metro track of Krieau station in Vienna commissioned by Wiener Linien and KÖR Kunst im öffentlichen Raum. Honoring the brothers&#x27; legacy, Speto painted characters from Brazilian mythology like Boitatá, Iara or Boto and tribal pattern designs on the pillars of the subway line. To this end he employed graphic styles of the Brazilian Literatura de Cordel.

<doc id="600296" wikidata="Q95072" url="?curid=600296" title="RahXephon">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series created and directed by Yutaka Izubuchi. The series follows 17-year-old Ayato Kamina, his ability to control a mecha known as the RahXephon, and his inner journey to find a place in the world. His life as a student and artist in Tokyo is suddenly interrupted by a mysterious stalker, strange planes invading the city and strange machines fighting back.

The series was animated by Bones and it aired on Fuji TV for twenty-six episodes from January to September 2002. It was produced by Fuji TV, Bones, Media Factory and Victor Entertainment. The series received critical acclaim and was subsequently translated, released on the DVD and aired in several other countries, including the United States. A 2003 movie adaptation &quot;&quot; was directed by Tomoki Kyoda, with plot changes and new scenes. The series was also spun into novels, an extra OVA episode, an audio drama, a video game, illustration books and an altered manga adaptation by Takeaki Momose.

Director Izubuchi said &quot;RahXephon&quot; was his attempt to set a new standard for mecha anime, as well as to bring back aspects of 1970s mecha shows like &quot;Reideen The Brave&quot;.

==Setting==
The backstory of &quot;RahXephon&quot; is a fight against multi-dimensional invaders known as Mulians (known as ). The Mu are visually indistinguishable from humans, however they carry a genetic marker called the &quot;Mu phase&quot; which turns their blood blue and causes some memory loss when they mature.

The story reveals that two Mu floating cities appeared above Tokyo and Sendai around the end of 2012. The ensuing conflict between Mu and humans escalated into nuclear warfare, and the Mu enveloped Tokyo and the outlying suburbs within a spherical barrier resembling Jupiter, referred by outsiders as &quot;Tokyo Jupiter&quot; (&quot;Tōkyō Jupita&quot;). The barrier has a time dilating effect, which causes time inside Tokyo Jupiter to slow down to one-fifth compared to the outside time, and allowed the Mu to secretly take control of Tokyo, using the area as their base of operations. The goal of the human forces outside of Tokyo Jupiter is to build up their strength to penetrate through and invade Tokyo Jupiter and stop the Mu while surviving their attacks.

Although &quot;RahXephon&quot; is part of the mecha genre of anime, its &quot;mechas&quot; are not mechanical. The mechas, used by the Mu and called Dolems, are made out of clay, like golems. Each is bound to a certain Mulian; however, some are also bound to certain human hosts, called &quot;sub-Mulians&quot;.

The dominant theme of &quot;RahXephon&quot; is the music changing the world. The Dolems are animated by a mystical force connected to music; most of the controlling Mulians appear to be singing. A Dolem attacks while singing, and sometimes the attack is the song itself. The RahXephon can also attack by having its pilot—the &quot;instrumentalist&quot;—sing a note. This unleashes force waves that cause massive destruction. Each Mulian Dolem has an Italian name referring to musical notations, such as, &quot;Allegretto&quot;, &quot;Falsetto&quot;, or &quot;Vivace&quot;. The ultimate goal of the RahXephon is to &quot;tune the world.&quot; Izubuchi says the name &quot;RahXephon&quot; lacked a real meaning, but that he now explains it as composed of &quot;Rah&quot; as the origin of Ra according to Churchward, &quot;X&quot; as the unknown variable or X factor, and &quot;-ephon&quot; as a suffix for instrument from &quot;&quot;.

==Plot==
The most important plot line of the series is the unusual relationship between Ayato Kamina and Haruka Shitow. Although Haruka appears to be a stranger to Ayato at first, the series reveals that they knew each other from before the beginning of the story.

Ayato is a boy who was unknowingly conceived with the help of the &quot;Bähbem Foundation&quot; living in Tokyo with his adoptive mother, Maya Kamina. Ayato had met Haruka on a trip outside of Tokyo, and they continued to see each other when they returned to school in Tokyo. At this time, Haruka&#x27;s family name was &quot;Mishima&quot;.

However, during what later became known as the Tokyo Jupiter incident, Haruka and her pregnant mother were away on a holiday trip while Ayato was caught inside the city. Years later, after giving birth to Haruka&#x27;s sister Megumi, Haruka&#x27;s mother remarried and their family name became &quot;Shitow&quot;. Meanwhile, Maya modified Ayato&#x27;s memories to make him forget Haruka. The series makes clear that all of the humans within Tokyo Jupiter are subject to the same kind of mental control, thinking that they are all that&#x27;s left of mankind after a devastating war. Ayato is haunted by visions of Haruka, which he manifests in his art. Ixtli, RahXephon&#x27;s soul, also adopts Haruka&#x27;s appearance and family name (&quot;Mishima&quot;) to guide Ayato, but takes a different given name—&quot;Reika&quot;.

The story begins as Tokyo comes under attack by invading aircraft while a mysterious woman, later revealed to be Haruka, stalks Ayato. By this point, Haruka has grown considerably older than Ayato and everyone else who is inside of Tokyo Jupiter because of the time dilation. Because of this and her now having a different last name, Ayato does not recognize Haruka and also initially does not fully trust her, but he gradually re-discovers his love for her as the series progresses, and he learns of everything that has happened. At the end of the series, Ayato&#x27;s RahXephon merges with Quon&#x27;s, allowing him to modify the past by &quot;re-tuning the world&quot; to make it so that he and Haruka are never separated. In the final sequence of the series, the adult Ayato is seen with his wife Haruka and their infant daughter Quon.

==Characters==

:&quot;This section represents the story from the television series and may differ from other works.&quot;
At the beginning of &quot;RahXephon&quot;, Ayato Kamina is a modest 17-year-old living in Tokyo. He is an average student, who enjoys painting and spending time with his classmates Hiroko Asahina and Mamoru Torigai. He has affectionate relationship with his mother, strained by her long-hour work.

During the sudden attack on Tokyo, Ayato hears the singing of his classmate Reika Mishima. She leads him to a giant egg containing the RahXephon. Haruka Shitow, an agent of the defense research agency &quot;TERRA&quot; (acronym for &quot;Tereno Empireo Rapidmova Reakcii Armeo&quot;, broken Esperanto for &quot;Earth Empire Rapid Response Army&quot;), brings Ayato and the RahXephon to their headquarters.

Ayato moves in with Haruka&#x27;s uncle Professor Rikudoh and pilots the RahXephon against the attacking Dolems. Quon Kisaragi, a mysterious girl living with chief researcher Itsuki, seems to share some of Ayato&#x27;s artistic talent. Ernst von Bähbem of the &quot;Bähbem Foundation&quot; sponsors TERRA through the &quot;Federation&quot;, the successor of the United Nations.

While most characters are introduced by the end of episode 7, &quot;RahXephon&quot; continues to characters development and reveals their mysteries and relationships through heavy use of foreshadowing.

==Dolems==
&quot;Dolems&quot;, or , are enormous mecha-like beings that are used as powerful weapons by the Mulians. The name &quot;Dolem&quot; is derived from &quot;golem&quot;. It is also a reference to the first three notes in the C major scale, &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;, and the Italian word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;to ache&quot;.

In &quot;RahXephon&quot; Dolems are designated by TERRA as &quot;D1&quot;. The smaller fighters &quot;Dotem&quot; (with &quot;T&quot; instead of &quot;L&quot;) are designated as &quot;D2&quot;.

Dolems are made of clay, like golems, but are animated by a quasi-mystical force connected to music, as most of the controlling Mulians appear to be singing. A Dolem attacks while singing, and sometimes the attack is the song itself. Each D1 Dolem is bound to a Mulian who controls it. Some Dolems are also bound to human hosts called &quot;sub-Mulians&quot; or &quot;Dolem hosts&quot; who anchor to the Dolems in the human dimension, making it possible for the Mulian controller to take over the body of the host. These bonds are so strong that destroying a Dolem can kill both the Mulian controlling it and the human host. When destroyed, a Dolem disintegrates into blue blood and clay.

==Production and media==
&quot;RahXephon&quot; was initially produced as a TV series. A manga version, novels, soundtracks and an audio drama were published during the original broadcast. A movie, an OVA episode, art books, and guide books were also created. Characters, mecha and story from &quot;RahXephon&quot; were featured in three video games.
===TV series===
Yutaka Izubuchi was a successful anime supervisor and designer focusing on costume, character and mechanical design, notably in the &quot;Gundam&quot; and &quot;Patlabor&quot; series. His friend and former Sunrise colleague Masahiko Minami, producer and president of Bones, had suggested Izubuchi to direct something.

Izubuchi finally agreed and &quot;RahXephon&quot; became his first directing job. Izubuchi returned to the classic mecha shows of the 1970s and 1980s and wanted to make a show of that type updated with advances in anime production as well as adding his own personal ideas. He wanted to &quot;set a new standard in the field&quot; of mecha anime to show his &quot;own standard&quot; and capabilities as a creator-showrunner.
Media Factory, Fuji TV. and Victor Entertainment joined Bones as production partners. After planning the story and designing characters and locations, a core group was expanded to a full production staff that completed the show, primarily working together — a departure from the trend of outsourcing anime production.

The original music, except for the opening theme, is composed by Ichiko Hashimoto; she was initially approached to compose some of the score and replied that she wanted to compose all of it. She also plays Maya and performs the closing theme together with her sister Mayumi. The opening theme &quot;Hemisphere&quot; is composed by Yoko Kanno and sung by Maaya Sakamoto, who plays Reika. Hashimoto&#x27;s compositions range from piano sonatas and acoustic chamber music to experimental jazz, hard rock, and ambience that crosses the border into sound design. She also includes more mainstream jazz and orchestral music played with both acoustic and electronic instruments.

===Movie===
A television movie version of &quot;RahXephon&quot; called &quot;Pluralitas Concentio&quot; was directed by Tomoki Kyoda, who had directed three episodes of the TV series and acted as assistant director with Soichi Masui. Izubuchi acted as Chief Director on this movie, but was not heavily involved in its production. Most of the staff members involved with the TV series worked on the movie, and it was distributed by Shochiku. The producers were Masahiko Minami, Shiro Sasaki, Maki Horiuchi, Kenji Shimizu, and Tatsuji Yamazaki.

The movie quickly reveals mysteries that were developed slowly in the TV series and makes changes to the plot. It begins with a prologue showing previously unseen events, followed by a couple of expository scenes. The final 30 minutes contain the most plot changes and new scenes, ending with a new epilogue. The rest of the movie consists mainly of abridged scenes from the original series, sometimes with characters replaced or with different motivations and dialogue. The link between the Kamina and Mishima families and other storylines that were prominent in the original TV series were reduced or removed. One prominent distributor promoted the movie as an &quot;encore&quot;—an extra performance at the end of the series, rather than as a replacement.

===Manga===

The manga was illustrated and written by Takeaki Momose. Momose was one of the candidates for character designer on the series, but Izubuchi wanted Akihiro Yamada to do the original designs, and Hiroki Kanno got the job of adapting them for animation. With the manga Momose got the opportunity to re-design the characters into his own style and make changes in characterization and story, as well as adding &quot;fan service&quot;. It was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;seinen&quot; manga magazine &quot;Monthly Sunday Gene-X&quot; from August 18, 2001, to November 19, 2002.

The scenario of the manga adaptation is similar to &quot;RahXephon&quot; series with some minor and major differences. In the anime series, Reika is a mysterious and distant figure; in the manga Reika is a more comical figure who grew up as Ayato&#x27;s adoptive sister with a darker origin. The anime series shows Megumi competing with Haruka for Ayato&#x27;s affections, while this role is taken by Reika in the manga. The rate of time dilation is also different in the manga version, as the year outside Tokyo is 2033 instead of 2027.

==Reception==
The anime series originally aired on stations in the Fuji Television network and its affiliates, except in the Kansai region where independent UHF stations aired it instead. Starting with episode 10, some stations moved the series from the afternoon to after midnight, but other stations moved it from late night to afternoon. &quot;RahXephon&quot; thus remained both a &quot;late night anime&quot; and afternoon anime throughout its original run.

According to its distributor, the series &quot;captivated millions in Japan&quot; and &quot;[drew] in viewers by the tens of thousands.&quot; The series won the award for best anime television series at the 7th Animation Kobe fair. It was considered popular enough that a TV movie version was commissioned and aired.

Internationally, the series was translated and released on DVD. It was purchased for airing by television stations and made available on video on demand services in several countries. In the United States, the DVDs were released around the theatrical release of another Bones production, &quot;Cowboy Bebop: The Movie&quot;. The distributor claimed that &quot;RahXephon&quot; was met with &quot;strong sales and extraordinary critical response in the U.S.&quot;

===TV series reviews===
The series was generally well received by English-language reviewers. While some reviewers only judged the show on its own merits, others compared it with varying favor against shows such as &quot;Brain Powerd&quot;, &quot;Megazone 23&quot;, and &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;.

Protoculture Addicts editor Claude J. Pelletier chose &quot;RahXephon&quot; as one of the top 3 anime television series of 2002, and Miyako Matsuda agreed, noting mystery, technology, and romance. Christian Nutt of Anime Jump offered a contrary opinion: &quot;RahXephon&#x27;s characters fell flat and the grind of its scenario didn&#x27;t inspire much curiosity, despite some initially awesome ideas&quot;. En Hong, on the other hand, found the characters to be skilfully developed and believable as &quot;self-conscious entities and not just parts to be filled for the story to progress&quot;, and Charles Solomon called them &quot;engaging&quot;.

Mike Toole of Anime Jump was impressed by the music, animation and character design; as was Protoculture&#x27;s Martin Ouellette. Solomon noted the &quot;strikingly original mecha designs&quot; and Anime Boredom&#x27;s John Huxley noted the &quot;unusual yet elegant&quot; mecha and the &quot;fluid computer-enhanced&quot;—but not CGI-looking—animation.

&quot;RahXephon&quot;&#x27;s &quot;brief but not unwelcome&quot; comic moments went over well with Huxley, and he found the romance &quot;a million miles away from the cheery antics of &quot;Love Hina&quot; or &quot;Ranma ½&quot;&quot; and &quot;for the most part thoroughly believable&quot;.

Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD found the final episodes beautiful both in visual style and story, &quot;with the raw emotions coming out of it, in both languages&quot;. Huxley also liked the conclusion: &quot;Despite falling short of the mark in a few areas this is a satisfying conclusion to a good series.&quot; On the plot resolution he wrote that &quot;RahXephon&quot; &quot;keeps the audience guessing right up until the final credits and beyond&quot; but that &quot;the clues are all there&quot; for the viewer to piece together. Anime News Network columnist Zac Bertschy called &quot;RahXephon&quot; a &quot;paragon of responsible storytelling (...) No loose strings are left; we see the conclusion of every character’s storyline.&quot; He added that the English voice work &quot;raised the bar across the board.&quot;

===Movie reviews===
The TV movie had a more mixed reception than the TV series. Christian Nutt was not excited about the TV series but found the movie to be better: Despite &quot;too much cutting and chopping&quot;, he wrote that &quot;the creators have done the best they can with the material.&quot; He added: &quot;the last scene is very touching. It&#x27;s a big improvement over the TV show.&quot; Efrain Diaz Jr. of IGN called the movie a &quot;valiant effort&quot;, but preferred the TV series and asked &quot;why even bother with the movie?&quot;

Carlo Santos, writing for Anime News Network, recommended the movie both as an &quot;endcap to a remarkable series&quot; and as a sample for those yet to watch it. While Chris Beveridge also recommended the movie as an addition to the series, he did not recommend it as a sample for newcomers, &quot;since some of the best revelations are given away so quickly...&quot;

Indeed, reviewers who were not familiar with the series complained about the movie&#x27;s lack of coherence. Mitchell Hattaway of DVD Verdict &quot;got lost about ten minutes in&quot;, considered the movie a waste of money for anybody but &quot;RahXephon&quot; completists and wrote that &quot;Bones Animation Studio is guilty of contempt for its audience.&quot; Janet Crocker of Animefringe was confused by the plot as well, but was less confused on the second viewing and looked forward to watching the TV series. She called the movie &quot;intellectually refreshing and visually beautiful&quot; and recommended it &quot;even to non-mecha people like me&quot;.

===Book reviews===
Eduardo M. Chavez of Anime on DVD was not impressed by the first volume of the manga, especially when compared to the TV series; he rated it &quot;C minus&quot;, though he said it could have worked as a &quot;parody dōjinshi&quot;. After the disappointment of volume one, Chavez was pleasantly surprised by the story in the following volumes, and called it a &quot;story that grew up with its characters&quot;, giving it a &quot;B plus&quot;.
The five-volume novelization was translated to English, but the other novels were not. This translation was marred by a lack of copy editing in the first volume, which was rated &quot;D&quot; by Santos. The situation was somewhat improved in the second volume, but reviewers did not recommend the novelization as an alternative to the animated versions — only as a source for learning more about the characters and their internal motivations.

==Comparisons with other anime==
Some reviewers and the director have compared &quot;RahXephon&quot; with other anime shows. Some of these shows also have staff common with &quot;RahXephon&quot;.

===&quot;Reideen the Brave&quot;===
The director of &quot;RahXephon&quot; has said this series is meant to be a sort of modern-day &quot;Reideen&quot;. As such there are similarities between &quot;Raideen&quot; and &quot;RahXephon&quot;, particularly in the titular &quot;robots&quot;.
* The monsters in both shows are made from earth and rock which is brought to life.
* Akira Hibiki and Ayato Kamina both have mothers who are from a race called the &quot;Mu&quot;. This in turn means that both Akira and Ayato have Mu blood.
* Akira and Ayato both &quot;meld&quot; into a surface in order to enter the cockpit of their respective robot. Akira enters via Reideen&#x27;s forehead; Ayato can enter the RahXephon both directly and through a portal that is separate from the body of the RahXephon.
* The Raideen and the RahXephon both are portrayed as intelligent, sentient beings and possess similar general aesthetics, particularly the human-like face that is covered on the sides. Both can attack with their voices, and can form a bow with arrows as well as a sword that protrudes out of their right arms.

Both have appeared in the &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; series, taking particular significance in &quot;Super Robot Wars MX&quot; where many characters note that &quot;Reideen&quot; and &quot;RahXephon&quot; are similar existences, and &quot;Reideen the Brave&quot; has since been remade into &quot;Reideen&quot;. The two also appear together in &quot;Super Robot Wars: Scramble Commander the 2nd&quot;.

===&quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;===
While some English-language reviewers did not mention the popular mecha anime &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; in their reviews of &quot;RahXephon&quot;, others compared the two explicitly. Some reviewers noted similarities between the series&#x27; protagonists and their style and execution of events. John Huxley noted an episode with &quot;soul searching&quot; sequences reminiscent of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; with a &quot;hint of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;&quot;.

After reviewing the first five episodes, Mike Pinsky of DVD Verdict wrote that much of &quot;RahXephon&quot; was &quot;ripped off completely&quot; from &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; and although finding it to be a good show, he ruled that &quot;This &quot;Evangelion&quot; Lite tastes good enough, but is much less filling.&quot; Christian Nutt of Anime Jump had seen the entire show when he wrote that &quot;One of my least favorite aspects of &quot;RahXephon&quot; is its aping of &quot;Evangelion&quot;&quot;. In Protoculture Addicts Miyako Matsuda agreed that the shows were similar, but compared the two in &quot;RahXephon&#x27;s&quot; favor: &quot;it is very similar to Evangelion, but in many ways more original and exotic.&quot; In the same magazine, Martin Ouellette went as far as calling &quot;RahXephon&quot; and &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; &quot;imitation&quot;, but was so impressed that he exclaimed &quot;the imitation has surpassed the original!&quot;

Some reviewers favoured &quot;RahXephon&quot; because of its more active protagonist and clearer ending: &quot;Like &quot;Evangelion&quot;, you have to bend and warp your brain around this thing, but unlike &quot;Evangelion&quot;, if you think about it, it all makes sense&quot; wrote Zac Bertschy. Huxley praised &quot;RahXephon&quot; for including action sequences in the ending, providing &quot;a more balanced experience&quot;. &quot;RahXephon&#x27;s&quot; story and complex relationships were planned and written early in the production cycle. In contrast, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;″s director stated that he did not know how the show would end, and production was influenced by the reactions that TV executives and viewers had to previous episodes. Although John Oppliger suggested stronger candidates for similarities than &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, he thought &quot;RahXephon&quot;&#x27;s similarity to &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; was intentional: 

John Huxley found &quot;several similarities&quot; with &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, but wrote that there were &quot;many, more significant differences&quot;, and concluded that &quot;RahXephon&quot; &quot;deserves to be recognised outside of its comparisons to a certain Hideaki Anno animation.&quot;

Some dialogue in the &quot;RahXephon&quot; anime series is reminiscent of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;; for instance, protagonist Ayato&#x27;s very first line in the show is &quot;Everything is all right with the world&quot;, which closely resembles the line &quot;All&#x27;s right with the world&quot; from Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;Song from Pippa Passes&quot;, which serves as the motto of &quot;Eva&quot;&#x27;s secret organization Nerv.

===Production connections===
Anno and Izubuchi, the chief directors of each show, both designed mecha appearing in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; (1988) and they worked together on the &quot;Cutie Honey&quot; (2004) live action movie. Izubuchi had also made some design drafts of the Evangelion units, but did not make the final designs. They gave an interview for one of the &quot;RahXephon&quot; guide books, and have a relationship that can be described as being old drinking buddies. Mitsuo Iso, a writer and key animator on &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, wrote and directed the &quot;RahXephon&quot; episode &quot;The Children&#x27;s Night&quot;; Yoji Enokido wrote the screenplay for &quot;RahXephon&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Interested Parties&quot; and &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;″s &quot;The Day Tokyo-3 Stood Still&quot;. Takeshi Honda was also an animator on both shows. Gainax was one of many companies contracted for in-between animation work on episodes 6 and 26. Although no Japanese voice actors from &quot;Evangelion&quot; voiced characters in the Japanese version of &quot;RahXephon&quot;, both shows were re-dubbed into English by ADV Films, and both Allison Keith and Tiffany Grant voiced regular characters in both series.

===Other anime===
* AnimeNation&#x27;s John Oppliger noted influences from &quot;Escaflowne&quot;, &quot;Evangelion&quot;, &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot; and &quot;especially &quot;Megazone 23&quot;&quot;
* Charles Solomon compared the premise of &quot;RahXephon&quot; with that of &quot;Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure&quot;, but found &quot;RahXephon&quot; to be &quot;better plotted and executed&quot;.
* Huxley found the Dolems to be &quot;the star of the show with their bizarre, slightly disturbing designs&quot; reminiscent of &quot;Grey&quot;.
* Anime Jump reviewer Mike Toole compared &quot;RahXephon&quot; with &quot;Brain Powerd&quot; on account of the &quot;excellent music&quot;, design and a &quot;frustratingly large cast and Byzantine plot&quot;, but found &quot;RahXephon&quot; &quot;more focused&quot;. He thus disagreed with his colleague, Christian Nutt, who wrote that &quot;[&quot;Brain Powerd&quot;] may not be as sexy, but it features a more heartfelt and original story&quot;.

After &quot;RahXephon&quot;, Izubuchi went back to design work. His assistant director, Tomoki Kyoda, became chief director on &quot;Eureka Seven&quot;. Mitsuo Iso went on from his experience on &quot;RahXephon&quot; to become the chief director of &quot;Dennō Coil&quot;. &quot;RahXephon&quot; has been referenced by at least one other anime series, which was also produced by Bones.

When asked whether robot anime following &quot;RahXephon&quot; had &quot;lived up to the new era&quot; Izubuchi answered &quot;Partially yes and partially no&quot; and regretted the focus being on financially safer remakes instead of on new creations.
