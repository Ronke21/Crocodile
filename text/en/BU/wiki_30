<doc id="593701" wikidata="Q3082644" url="?curid=593701" title="List of bomber aircraft">
<text>[[Bomber|Bomber aircraft]] are military aircraft primarily designed for air-to-surface attack, on either ground or sea targets. This list does not include airships used for bombing and does not aim to include attack aircraft primarily intended for different roles. There are bound to be some overlap in roles and designs and some multirole combat aircraft could appear in more than one list. There are separate lists of fighter aircraft, ground attack aircraft and trainers. This list does not include fictional aircraft .

<doc id="593702" wikidata="Q2915372" url="?curid=593702" title="Bronte, New South Wales">
<text>Bronte is a beachside Eastern Suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Bronte Beach is located 7 kilometres east of the Sydney central business district, in the Waverley Council local government area of the Eastern Suburbs.

Bronte Beach sits on Nelson Bay, surrounded by Bronte Park. Bronte offers scenic cliff-top walking paths south to Coogee via the Waverley Cemetery and north to Bondi Beach, via Tamarama and Mackenzies Bay. The cliff-top path offers views which extend from Ben Buckler in the north to Malabar in the south. Bronte is located about 2.5¬†km south of Bondi Beach.

The suburb has previously been declared the best of 641 Sydney suburbs by the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Good Suburbs Guide in 2008.&quot;

==History==
===First Australian history===
There is no clear evidence for the name or names of the indigenous bands or clans who were the original custodians of the area prior to the 1788 European settlement of Australia. Most sources agree on the Cadigal, but some sources name the Biddigal and Birrabirragal bands as well. There was a large natural &quot;bogey hole&quot; at the southern end of the beach, the name of which derived from the local Aboriginal term for &quot;swimming place&quot;, but the original bogey hole was substantially destroyed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the current bogey hole was articially constructed in the early 20th century.

Owing to the devastating effects of the European invasion on Aboriginal peoples, including forced displacement and the catastrophic impact of introduced European diseases such as smallpox, most or all of the original indigenous inhabitants of the area were killed by disease or forced to move further inland during the late 18th and early 19th century, resulting in the near-total loss of indigenous cultural knowledge about the area, and this had been compounded by the massive residential and commercial development of the area, which has destroyed nearly all archaeological evidence of the indigenous occupation and use of the land and seashore around what is now known as &quot;Nelson Bay&quot;.

===Modern history===

Robert Lowe, who later became Viscount Sherbrooke, bought of land from Mortimer Lewis, the English-born Australian Colonial Architect who was given a free grant of most of the frontage in the area in the 1830s. His home was completed in 1845 and was named &quot;Bronte House&quot;, for Lord Nelson, who was the Duke of Bronte, a place in Sicily, Italy. The house, a single-storey stone bungalow located in Bronte Road, is owned by Waverley Council and leased to private tenants who hold open days a few times a year. It is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register and on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.

Lowe became a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. He later moved back to England where he became a writer with &quot;The Times&quot;.

===Trams===

The former Bronte tram line branched from the North Bondi via Bondi Junction line at Bondi Junction, running down Bronte Road and MacPherson Street to Bronte Beach. A feature of this line was the final approach to Bronte Beach in a rock cutting leading to the Pacific Ocean cliff tops. The line opened to Waverley in 1890, then to Bronte in 1911. Electric services started to Waverley in 1902, then Bronte in 1911. Through services ran from Circular Quay or Railway Square. The line was closed in 1960 and replaced by a bus service that follows the route between Bronte and Bondi Junction of bus 378 (440 from 2015 and 379 from early 2018).

== Heritage listings ==
Bronte has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 470 Bronte Road: &quot;Bronte House&quot;
* St Thomas Street: Waverley Cemetery

==Demographics==
According to the of Population, there were 7,166 residents in Bronte. In Bronte, 65.2% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were England 8.1%, New Zealand 2.6%, United States of America 1.8% and South Africa 1.6%. 81.2% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included French at 1.7%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 47.3%, Catholic 21.9% and Anglican 10.4%.

==Culture==

In recent years Bronte&#x27;s eating scene has developed, with the introduction of several popular restaurants in and in close proximity to Macpherson St. 

==Sport and recreation==

Bronte has an important surfing culture. The Bronte Surf Lifesaving Club was founded in 1903 and claims to be the oldest surf lifesaving club in the world. An annual long-distance ocean swimming event is held in December each year between Bondi Beach and Bronte.

According to &quot;The Dictionary of Sydney&quot;, it is believed that the famous swimming style generally known as the &quot;Australian crawl&quot; was first seen at Bronte Baths in 1899.

Bronte is represented in one of the most popular sporting competitions across Australia, the National Rugby League competition, by the local team the Sydney Roosters, officially the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club (ESDRLFC).

The Bronte Splashers Winter Swimming Club claims to be the oldest Winter Swimming club in the world founded in 1921 and compete against Bondi Icebergs Winter Swimming Club, South Maroubra Dolphins Winter Swimming Club, Cronulla Polar Bears Winter Swimming Club, Maroubra Seals Winter Swimming Club, Coolangatta Surf Life Saving Club, Clovelly Eskimos Winter Swimming Club, Coogee Penguins Winter Swimming Club, Wollongong Whales and Cottesloe Crabs in the Winter Swimming Association of Australia Championships.

<doc id="593703" wikidata="Q183425" url="?curid=593703" title="Abdominal pain">
<text>Abdominal pain, also known as a stomach ache, is a symptom associated with both non-serious and serious medical issues. Since the abdomen contains most of the body&#x27;s vital organs, it can be an indicator of a wide variety of diseases. Given that, approaching the examination of a person and planning of a differential diagnosis is extremely important.

Common causes of pain in the abdomen include gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome. About 15% of people have a more serious underlying condition such as appendicitis, leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, diverticulitis, or ectopic pregnancy. In a third of cases, the exact cause is unclear.

==Signs and symptoms==
The onset of abdominal pain can be abrupt, quick, or gradual. Sudden onset pain happens in a split second. Rapidly onset pain starts¬†mild and gets worse over¬†the next few minutes. Pain that gradually intensifies only after several hours or even days has passed is referred to as gradual onset pain.

One can describe abdominal pain as either continuous or sporadic and as cramping, dull, or aching. The characteristic of cramping abdominal pain is that it comes in brief waves, builds to a peak, and then abruptly stops for a period during which there is no more pain. The pain flares up and off periodically. The most common cause of persistent dull or aching abdominal pain is edema or distention of the wall of a hollow viscus. A dull or aching pain may also be felt due to a stretch in the liver and spleen capsules.

==Causes==
The most frequent reasons for abdominal pain are gastroenteritis (13%), irritable bowel syndrome (8%), urinary tract problems (5%), inflammation of the stomach (5%) and constipation (5%). In about 30% of cases, the cause is not determined. About 10% of cases have a more serious cause including gallbladder (gallstones or biliary dyskinesia) or pancreas problems (4%), diverticulitis (3%), appendicitis (2%) and cancer (1%). More common in those who are older, ischemic colitis, mesenteric ischemia, and abdominal aortic aneurysms are other serious causes.

===Acute abdomen===
Acute abdomen is a condition where there is a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain requiring immediate recognition and management of the underlying cause. The underlying cause may involve infection, inflammation, vascular occlusion or bowel obstruction.

The pain may elicit nausea and vomiting, abdominal distention, fever and signs of shock. A common condition associated with acute abdominal pain is appendicitis. Here is a list of acute abdomen causes:
===By system===
A more extensive list includes the following:
* Gastrointestinal
** GI tract
*** Inflammatory: gastroenteritis, appendicitis, gastritis, esophagitis, diverticulitis, Crohn&#x27;s disease, ulcerative colitis, microscopic colitis
*** Obstruction: hernia, intussusception, volvulus, post-surgical adhesions, tumors, severe constipation, hemorrhoids
*** Vascular: embolism, thrombosis, hemorrhage, sickle cell disease, abdominal angina, blood vessel compression (such as celiac artery compression syndrome), superior mesenteric artery syndrome, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome
*** Digestive: peptic ulcer, lactose intolerance, celiac disease, food allergies, indigestion
** Glands
*** Bile system
**** Inflammatory: cholecystitis, cholangitis
**** Obstruction: cholelithiasis
*** Liver
**** Inflammatory: hepatitis, liver abscess
*** Pancreatic
**** Inflammatory: pancreatitis
* Renal and urological
** Inflammation: pyelonephritis, bladder infection
** Obstruction: kidney stones, urolithiasis, urinary retention
** Vascular: left renal vein entrapment
* Gynaecological or obstetric
** Inflammatory: pelvic inflammatory disease
** Mechanical: ovarian torsion
** Endocrinological: menstruation, Mittelschmerz
** Tumors: endometriosis, fibroids, ovarian cyst, ovarian cancer
** Pregnancy: ruptured ectopic pregnancy, threatened abortion
* Abdominal wall
** muscle strain or trauma
** muscular infection

==Mechanism==

Abdominal pain can be referred to as visceral pain or peritoneal pain. The contents of the abdomen can be divided into the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. The foregut contains the pharynx, lower respiratory tract, portions of the esophagus, stomach, portions of the duodenum (proximal), liver, biliary tract (including the gallbladder and bile ducts), and the pancreas. The midgut contains portions of the duodenum (distal), cecum, appendix, ascending colon, and first half of the transverse colon. The hindgut contains the distal half of the transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, and superior anal canal.

Each subsection of the gut has an associated visceral afferent nerve that transmits sensory information from the viscera to the spinal cord. The visceral sensory information from the gut traveling to the spinal cord, termed the visceral afferent, is non-specific and overlaps with the somatic afferent nerves, which are very specific. Therefore, visceral afferent information traveling to the spinal cord can present in the distribution of the somatic afferent nerve; this is why appendicitis initially presents with T10 periumbilical pain when it first begins and becomes T12 pain as the abdominal wall peritoneum (which is rich with somatic afferent nerves) is involved.

==Diagnosis==
A thorough patient history and physical examination is used to better understand the underlying cause of abdominal pain.

The process of gathering a history may include:
* Identifying more information about the chief complaint by eliciting a history of present illness; i.e. a narrative of the current symptoms such as the onset, location, duration, character, aggravating or relieving factors, and temporal nature of the pain. Identifying other possible factors may aid in the diagnosis of the underlying cause of abdominal pain, such as recent travel, recent contact with other ill individuals, and for females, a thorough gynecologic history.
* Learning about the patient&#x27;s past medical history, focusing on any prior issues or surgical procedures.
* Clarifying the patient&#x27;s current medication regimen, including prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, and supplements.
* Confirming the patient&#x27;s drug and food allergies.
* Discussing with the patient any family history of disease processes, focusing on conditions that might resemble the patient&#x27;s current presentation.
* Discussing with the patient any health-related behaviors (e.g. tobacco use, alcohol consumption, drug use, and sexual activity) that might make certain diagnoses more likely.
* Reviewing the presence of non-abdominal symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, vaginal bleeding) that can further clarify the diagnostic picture.
* Using Carnett&#x27;s sign to differentiate between visceral pain and pain originating in the muscles of the abdominal wall.

After gathering a thorough history, one should perform a physical exam in order to identify important physical signs that might clarify the diagnosis, including a cardiovascular exam, lung exam, thorough abdominal exam, and for females, a genitourinary exam.

Additional investigations that can aid diagnosis include:
* Blood tests including complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, electrolytes, liver function tests, amylase, lipase, troponin I, and for females, a serum pregnancy test.
* Urinalysis
* Imaging including chest and abdominal X-rays
* Electrocardiogram

If diagnosis remains unclear after history, examination, and basic investigations as above, then more advanced investigations may reveal a diagnosis. Such tests include:
* Computed tomography of the abdomen/pelvis
* Abdominal or pelvic ultrasound
* Endoscopy or colonoscopy

==Management==
The management of abdominal pain depends on many factors, including the etiology of the pain. Some behavioural changes implemented to prevent pain include: resting after a meal, chewing food completely and slowly, and avoiding stressful and high excitement situations after a meal. Such at home strategies may reduce the need to seek professional assistance via prevention of future abdominal pain. In the emergency department, a person presenting with abdominal pain may initially require IV fluids due to decreased intake secondary to abdominal pain and possible emesis or vomiting. Treatment for abdominal pain includes analgesia, such as non-opioid (ketorolac) and opioid medications (morphine, fentanyl). Choice of analgesia is dependent on the cause of the pain, as ketorolac can worsen some intra-abdominal processes. Patients presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain may receive a &quot;GI cocktail&quot; that includes an antacid (examples include omeprazole, ranitidine, magnesium hydroxide, and calcium chloride) and lidocaine. After addressing pain, there may be a role for antimicrobial treatment in some cases of abdominal pain. Butylscopolamine (Buscopan) is used to treat cramping abdominal pain with some success. Surgical management for causes of abdominal pain includes but is not limited to cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and exploratory laparotomy.

===Emergencies===
Below is a brief overview of abdominal pain emergencies.
==Outlook==
One well-known aspect of primary health care is its low prevalence of potentially dangerous abdominal pain¬†causes. Patients with abdominal pain have a higher percentage of unexplained complaints (category &quot;no diagnosis&quot;) than patients with other symptoms (such as dyspnea or chest pain). Most people who suffer from stomach pain have a benign issue, like dyspepsia. In general, it is discovered that 20% to 25% of patients with abdominal pain have a serious condition that necessitates admission to an acute care hospital.

==Epidemiology==
Abdominal pain is the reason about 3% of adults see their family physician. Rates of emergency department (ED) visits in the United States for abdominal pain increased 18% from 2006 through to 2011. This was the largest increase out of 20 common conditions seen in the ED. The rate of ED use for nausea and vomiting also increased 18%.

==Special populations==
===Geriatrics===
More time and resources are used on older patients with abdominal pain than on any other patient presentation in the emergency department (ED). Compared to younger patients with the same complaint, their length of stay is 20% longer, they need to be admitted almost half the time, and they need surgery 1/3 of the time.

Age does not reduce the total number of T cells, but it does reduce their functionality. The elderly person&#x27;s ability to fight infection is weakened as a result. Additionally, they have changed the strength and integrity of their skin and mucous membranes, which are physical barriers to infection. It is well known that older patients experience altered pain perception.

The challenge of obtaining a sufficient history from an elderly patient can be attributed to multiple factors. Reduced memory or hearing could make the issue worse. It is common to encounter stoicism combined with a fear of losing one&#x27;s independence if a serious condition is discovered. Changes in mental status, whether acute or chronic, are common.

===Pregnancy===
Unique clinical challenges arise when pregnant women experience abdominal pain. First off, there are many possible causes of abdominal pain during pregnancy. These include intraabdominal diseases that arise incidentally during pregnancy as well as obstetric or gynecologic disorders associated with pregnancy. Secondly, pregnancy modifies the natural history and clinical manifestation of numerous abdominal disorders. Third, pregnancy modifies and limits the diagnostic assessment. For instance, concerns about fetal safety during pregnancy are raised by invasive exams and radiologic testing. Fourth, while receiving therapy during pregnancy, the mother&#x27;s and the fetus&#x27; interests need to be taken into account.

<text>Sir Ranulph Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, 3rd Baronet (born 7 March 1944), commonly known as Sir Ranulph Fiennes () and sometimes as Ran Fiennes, is a British explorer, writer and poet, who holds several endurance records.

Fiennes served in the British Army for eight years, including a period on counter-insurgency service while attached to the Army of the Sultanate of Oman. He later undertook numerous expeditions and was the first person to visit both the North Pole and South Pole by surface means and the first to completely cross Antarctica on foot. In May 2009, at the age of 65, he reached the summit of Mount Everest.

According to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; in 1984, he was the world&#x27;s greatest living explorer. Fiennes has written numerous books about his army service and his expeditions as well as books on explorers Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton.

==Early life and education==

Fiennes was born in Windsor, Berkshire, on 7 March 1944, nearly four months after the death of his father, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Ranulph Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes. Whilst commanding the Royal Scots Greys in Italy Fiennes&#x27; father trod on a German anti-personnel S-mine and died of his wounds eleven days later in Naples on 24 November 1943. He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Fiennes&#x27; mother was Audrey Joan (died 2004), younger daughter of Sir Percy Newson. Fiennes inherited his father&#x27;s baronetcy, becoming the 3rd Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes baronet at his birth.

After the war his mother moved the family to South Africa, where he remained until he was 12. While in South Africa he attended Western Province Preparatory School in Newlands, Cape Town. Fiennes then returned to be educated at Sandroyd School, Wiltshire, and then at Eton College.

==Career==
===Officer===
After failing to gain entry into the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Fiennes attended Mons Officer Cadet School. After completing several months&#x27; training, on 27 July 1963 he was granted a short service commission in his late father&#x27;s former regiment, the Royal Scots Greys. He was later seconded to the Special Air Service where he specialised in demolitions.

Offended by the construction of an ugly concrete dam built in Castle Combe, Wiltshire, by 20th Century Fox for the production of the 1967 film &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;, Fiennes with others plotted to blow up the dam but the police foiled the plan. Fiennes was fined ¬£300 for conspiring to cause a public mischief, and ¬£200 for unlawfully possessing explosives; he and a co-conspirator were dismissed from the SAS. He was initially posted to another cavalry regiment but was eventually permitted to return to the Royal Scots Greys.

Fiennes spent the last two years of his army career seconded to the Sultan of Oman&#x27;s Armed Forces. At the time, Oman was experiencing a growing communist insurgency supported from neighbouring South Yemen. After familiarisation, he commanded the Reconnaissance Platoon of the Muscat Regiment, seeing extensive active service in the Dhofar War. He led several raids deep into rebel-held territory on the Djebel Dhofar and was decorated for bravery by the Sultanate. After eight years&#x27; service Fiennes relinquished his commission on 27 July 1971.

===Expedition leader===
Since the 1960s Fiennes has been an expedition leader. He led expeditions up the White Nile on a hovercraft in 1969 and on Norway&#x27;s Jostedalsbreen Glacier in 1970. A notable trek was the Transglobe Expedition he undertook between 1979 and 1982, when he and two fellow members of 21 SAS, Oliver Shepard and Charles R. Burton, journeyed around the world on its polar axis, using surface transport only. Nobody else has ever done so by any route before or since.

As part of the Transglobe Expedition, Fiennes and Burton completed the Northwest Passage. They left Tuktoyaktuk on 26 July 1981 in an 18¬†ft open Boston Whaler and reached Tanquary Fiord on 31 August 1981. Their journey was the first open boat transit from West to East and covered around 3,000 miles (2,600 nautical miles or 4,800¬†km), taking a route through Dolphin and Union Strait following the south coast of Victoria Island and King William Island, north to Resolute Bay via the Franklin Strait and Peel Sound, around the south and east coasts of Devon Island, through Hell Gate and across Norwegian Bay to Eureka, Greely Bay and the head of Tanquary Fiord. Once they reached Tanquary Fiord, they had to trek a further 150 miles via Lake Hazen to Alert before setting up their winter base camp.

In 1992 Fiennes led an expedition that discovered what may be an outpost of the lost city of Iram in Oman. The following year he joined nutrition specialist Mike Stroud to become the first to cross the Antarctic continent unsupported; they took 93 days. A further attempt in 1996 to walk to the South Pole solo, in aid of the Breast Cancer Campaign, was unsuccessful due to a kidney stone attack and he had to be rescued from the operation by his crew.

In 2000 he attempted to walk solo and unsupported to the North Pole. The expedition failed when his sleds fell through weak ice and Fiennes was forced to pull them out by hand. He sustained severe frostbite to the tips of all the fingers on his left hand, forcing him to abandon the attempt. On returning home, his surgeon insisted the necrotic fingertips be retained for several months before amputation, to allow regrowth of the remaining healthy tissue. Impatient at the pain the dying fingertips caused, Fiennes cut them off himself with an electric fretsaw, just above where the blood and the soreness was.

Despite suffering from a heart attack and undergoing a double coronary artery bypass operation just four months before, Fiennes joined Stroud again in 2003 to complete seven marathons in seven days on seven continents in the Land Rover 7x7x7 Challenge for the British Heart Foundation. &quot;In retrospect I wouldn&#x27;t have done it. I would not do it again. It was Mike Stroud&#x27;s idea&quot;. Their series of marathons was as follows:

:::* 26 October ‚Äì Race 1: Patagonia ‚Äì South America
:::* 27 October ‚Äì Race 2: Falkland Islands ‚Äì &quot;Antarctica&quot;
:::* 28 October ‚Äì Race 3: Sydney ‚Äì Australia
:::* 29 October ‚Äì Race 4: Singapore ‚Äì Asia
:::* 30 October ‚Äì Race 5: London ‚Äì Europe
:::* 31 October ‚Äì Race 6: Cairo ‚Äì Africa
:::* 1 November ‚Äì Race 7: New York City ‚Äì North America

Originally Fiennes had planned to run the first marathon on King George Island, Antarctica. The second marathon would then have taken place in Santiago, Chile. However, bad weather and aeroplane engine trouble caused him to change his plans, running the South American segment in southern Patagonia first and then hopping to the Falklands as a substitute for the Antarctic leg.

Speaking after the event, Fiennes said the Singapore Marathon had been by far the most difficult because of high humidity and pollution. He also said his cardiac surgeon had approved the marathons, providing his heart-rate did not exceed 130 beats per minute. Fiennes later said that he forgot to pack his heart-rate monitor, and therefore did not know how fast his heart was beating.

In June 2005, Fiennes had to abandon an attempt to be the oldest Briton to climb Mount Everest when, in another climb for charity, he was forced to turn back as a result of heart problems, after reaching the final stopping point of the ascent. In March 2007, despite a lifelong fear of heights, Fiennes climbed the Eiger by its North Face, with sponsorship totalling ¬£1.8¬†million to be paid to the Marie Curie Cancer Care Delivering Choice Programme. Kenton Cool first met Fiennes in 2004, and subsequently guided him in the Alps and Himalayas.
In 2008 Fiennes made his second attempt to climb Mount Everest, getting to within of the summit before bad timing and bad weather stopped the expedition. On 20 May 2009 Fiennes reached the summit of Mount Everest, becoming the oldest British person to achieve this. Fiennes also became the first person to have climbed Everest and crossed both polar ice-caps. Of the other handful of adventurers who had visited both poles, only four had successfully crossed both polar icecaps: Norwegian B√∏rge Ousland, Belgian Alain Hubert and Fiennes. In successfully reaching the summit of Everest in 2009 Fiennes became the first person to achieve all three goals. Ousland wrote to congratulate him. Fiennes continues to compete in UK-based endurance events and has seen recent success in the veteran categories of some Mountain Marathon races. His training nowadays consists of regular two-hour runs around Exmoor.

In September 2012 it was announced that Fiennes was to lead the first attempt to cross Antarctica during the southern winter, in aid of the charity Seeing is Believing, an initiative to prevent avoidable blindness. The six-man team was dropped off by ship at Crown Bay in Queen Maud Land in January 2013, and waited until the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s autumnal equinox on 21 March 2013 before embarking across the ice shelf. The team would ascend onto the inland plateau, and head to the South Pole. The intention was for Fiennes and his skiing partner, Dr Mike Stroud, to lead on foot and be followed by two bulldozers dragging industrial sledges.

Fiennes had to pull out of the Coldest Journey expedition on 25 February 2013 because of frostbite and was evacuated from Antarctica.

===Author===
Fiennes&#x27; career as an author has developed alongside his career as an explorer: he is the author of 24 fiction and non-fiction books, including &quot;The Feather Men&quot;. In 2003, he published a biography of Captain Robert Falcon Scott which attempted to provide a robust defence of Scott&#x27;s achievements and reputation, which had been strongly questioned by biographers such as Roland Huntford. Although others have made comparisons between Fiennes and Scott, Fiennes says he identifies more with Lawrence Oates, another member of Scott&#x27;s doomed Antarctic team.

===Political views===
Fiennes stood for the Countryside Party in the 2004 European elections in the South West England region ‚Äì fourth on their list of six. The party received 30,824 votes ‚Äì insufficient for any of their candidates to be elected. Contrary to some reports, he has never been an official patron of the UK Independence Party. He is also a member of the libertarian pressure group The Freedom Association. In August 2014, Fiennes was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

===Media appearances===
As a guest on the British motoring television programme &quot;Top Gear&quot;, as a &quot;Star in a Reasonably Priced Car&quot;, his test track lap time, in a Suzuki Liana was 1:51, putting him 26th out of 65. He also appeared in the Polar Special episode, casually berating the three hosts for their flippant attitude toward the dangers of the Arctic.

According to an interview on &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Fiennes was considered for the role of James Bond during the casting process, making it to the final six contenders, but was rejected by Cubby Broccoli for having &quot;hands too big and a face like a farmer&quot;, and Roger Moore was eventually chosen. Fiennes related this tale again during one of his appearances on &quot;Countdown&quot;, in which he referred also to a brief film career that included an appearance alongside Liz Fraser.

Between 1 and 5 October 2012, and again from 13 to 19 November 2013, Fiennes featured on the Channel 4 game show &quot;Countdown&quot; as the celebrity guest in &#x27;Dictionary Corner&#x27; and provided interludes based on his life stories and explorations.

Fiennes was an expert guest commentator on the PBS documentary &quot;Chasing Shackleton&quot; which aired in January 2014. Fiennes makes a number of corporate and after dinner speeches.

In 2019, Fiennes appeared in a three part National Geographic documentary &quot;Egypt with the World&#x27;s Greatest Explorer&quot; (also titled &quot;Fiennes Return to Egypt&quot;) with his cousin and actor Joseph Fiennes that re-traced his first expedition in Egypt back in the 1960s.

==Personal life==
Fiennes married his childhood sweetheart, and fellow adventurer, Virginia (&quot;Ginny&quot;) Pepper on 9 September 1970. They ran a country farm estate on Exmoor, Somerset, where they raised cattle and sheep. Ginny built up a herd of Aberdeen Angus cattle while Fiennes was away on his expeditions. She was the first woman to receive the Polar Medal in recognition of her research work into VLF radio propagation. She also conceived, organised and participated in the Transglobe Expedition. The two remained married until her death from stomach cancer in February 2004.

Fiennes embarked on a lecture tour, where in Cheshire he met Louise Millington, whom he married at St Boniface&#x27;s Church, Bunbury, one year and three weeks after Ginny&#x27;s death. A daughter, Elizabeth, was born in April 2006. He also has a stepson named Alexander. In 2007 Millington was interviewed by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to help raise money for the Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital in Cheshire.

On 6 March 2010, Fiennes was involved in a three-car collision in Stockport which resulted in minor injuries to himself and serious injuries to the driver of another car. He had been in Stockport to participate in the annual High Peak Marathon in Derbyshire as part of a veterans&#x27; team known as Poles Apart that, despite the freezing conditions, managed to win the veterans&#x27; trophy in just over 12 hours.

In 2003, shortly after boarding a flight to Scotland from Bristol Airport, Fiennes suffered a heart attack and later underwent emergency bypass surgery.

Fiennes is a member of the Worshipful Company of Vintners and the Highland Society of London and holds honorary membership of the Travellers Club.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1970, while serving with the Omani Army, Fiennes received the Sultan&#x27;s Bravery Medal. He has also been awarded a number of honorary doctorates, the first in 1986 by Loughborough University, followed in 1995 by University of Central England, in 2000 by University of Portsmouth, 2002 by Glasgow Caledonian University, 2005 by University of Sheffield, 2007 by University of Abertay Dundee and September 2011 by University of Plymouth. Fiennes later received the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Medal.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1982 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

Fiennes was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1993 for &quot;human endeavour and for charitable services&quot;: in 2015 it was reported his expeditions have raised ¬£16¬†million for good causes.

In 1986, Fiennes was awarded the Polar Medal for &quot;outstanding service to British Polar exploration and research.&quot; In 1994 he was awarded a second clasp to the Polar Medal, having visited both poles. He remains the only person to have received a double clasp for both the Arctic and Antarctica.

In the 2007 &quot;Top Gear: Polar Special&quot; the presenters travelled to the Magnetic North Pole in a Toyota Hilux. Fiennes was called in to speak with the presenters after their constant joking and horseplay during their cold weather training. As a former guest on the show who was familiar with their penchant for tomfoolery, Fiennes bluntly informed them of the grave dangers of polar expeditions, showing pictures of his own frostbite injuries and presenting what remained of his left hand. Sir Ranulph was given recognition by having his name placed before every surname in the closing credits: &quot;&quot;Sir Ranulph Clarkson, Sir Ranulph Hammond, Sir Ranulph May&quot;...&quot;.

In May 2007, Fiennes received ITV&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Britons&quot; Award for Sport beating fellow nominees Lewis Hamilton and Joe Calzaghe. In October 2007 Fiennes ranked 94th (tied with five others) in a list of the &quot;Top 100 living geniuses&quot; published by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

In late 2008/early 2009, Fiennes took part in a new BBC programme called &quot;Top Dogs: Adventures in War, Sea and Ice&quot;, in which he teamed with fellow Britons John Simpson, the BBC News world affairs editor, and Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the round-the-world yachtsman. The team undertook three trips, with each team member experiencing the other&#x27;s adventure field. The first episode, aired on 27 March 2009, saw Fiennes, Simpson and Knox-Johnston go on a news-gathering trip to Afghanistan. The team reported from the Khyber Pass and the Tora Bora mountain complex. In the other two episodes they undertook a voyage around Cape Horn and an expedition hauling sledges across the deep-frozen Frobisher Bay in the far north of Canada.

In 2010, Fiennes was named as the UK&#x27;s top celebrity fundraiser by Justgiving, after raising more than ¬£2.5 million for Marie Curie Cancer Care over the previous two years ‚Äì more than any other celebrity fundraiser featured on JustGiving.com during the same period.

In September 2011, Fiennes was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Science from Plymouth University and, in July 2012, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Glamorgan.

In December 2012, Fiennes was named one of the &quot;Men of the Year&quot; for 2012 by &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine.

In October 2014 it was announced that Fiennes would receive an honorary Doctorate of Science, from the University of Chester, in recognition of &quot;outstanding and inspirational contribution to the field of exploration&quot;.

On 14 July 2022, the documentary film &quot;Explorer&quot; was released, which focused on Fiennes and his exploits and includes both contemporary and archive footage.

<text>Subpixel rendering is a method used to increase the effective resolution of a color display device. It takes advantage of each pixel&#x27;s composition of individually addressable red, green, and blue components adjacent on the display matrix, called subpixels, and uses them as rendering units instead of pixels.

Subpixel rendering is primarily used for text rendering on standard DPI displays.

Despite the inherent color anomalies, it can also be used to render general graphics.

== History ==

The origin of subpixel rendering as used today remains controversial. Apple Inc., IBM, and Microsoft patented various implementations with certain technical differences owing to the different purposes their technologies were intended for.

Microsoft had several patents in the United States on subpixel rendering technology for text rendering on RGB Stripe layouts. The patents 6,219,025, 6,239,783, 6,307,566, 6,225,973, 6,243,070, 6,393,145, 6,421,054, 6,282,327, 6,624,828 were filed between October 7, 1998, and October 7, 1999, and expired on July 30, 2019. Analysis of the patent by FreeType indicates that the idea of subpixel rendering is not covered by the patent, but by the actual filter used as a last step to balance the color. Microsoft&#x27;s patent describes the smallest filter possible that distributes each subpixel value to an equal amount of R,G, and B pixels. Any other filter will either be blurrier or will introduce color artifacts.

Apple was able to use it in Mac OS X due to a patent cross-licensing agreement.

== Characteristics ==

A single pixel on a color display is made of several subpixels, typically three arranged left-to-right as red, green, and blue (RGB). The components are easily visible when viewed with a small magnifying glass, such as a loupe. These pixel components appear as a single color to the human eye because of blurring by optics and spatial integration by nerve cells in the eye. However, the eye is much more sensitive to the location. Therefore, turning on the G and B of one pixel and the R of the next pixel to the right will produce a white dot, but it will appear to be 1/3 of a pixel to the right of the white dot that would be seen from the RGB of only the first pixel. Subpixel rendering takes advantage of this to provide three times the horizontal resolution of the rendered image, though it has to blur this image to produce the correct color by ensuring the same amount of red, green, and blue are turned on as when no subpixel rendering is being done.

Subpixel rendering does not necessitate the use of antialiasing, and gives a smoother result regardless of whether antialiasing is used or not since it artificially increases the resolution. However, it introduces color aliasing since subpixels are colored. Subsequent filtering applied to remove the color artifacts is a form of antialiasing, although its purpose is not smoothing jagged shapes as in conventional antialiasing.

Subpixel rendering requires the software to know the layout of the subpixels. The most common reason it is wrong is monitors that can be rotated 90 (or 180) degrees, though monitors are manufactured with other arrangements of the subpixels, such as BGR or in triangles, or with 4 colors like RGBW squares. On any such display the result of incorrect subpixel rendering will be worse than if no subpixel rendering was done at all (it will not produce color artifacts, but it will produce noisy edges).

== Implementations ==

=== Apple II ===
Steve Gibson has claimed that the Apple II, introduced in 1977, supports an early form of subpixel rendering in its high-resolution (280√ó192) graphics mode. The Wozniak patent only used 2 &quot;sub-pixels&quot;. The bytes that comprise the Apple II high-resolution screen buffer contain seven visible bits (each corresponding directly to a pixel) and a flag bit used to select between purple/green or blue/orange color sets. Each pixel, since it is represented by a single bit, is either on or off; there are no bits within the pixel itself for specifying color or brightness. Color is instead created as an artifact of the NTSC color encoding scheme, determined by horizontal position: pixels with even horizontal coordinates are always purple (or blue, if the flag bit is set), and odd pixels are always green (or orange). Two lit pixels next to each other are always white, regardless of whether the pair is even/odd or odd/even, and irrespective of the value of the flag bit. This is an approximation, but it is what most programmers of the time would have in mind while working with the Apple&#x27;s high-resolution mode.

Gibson&#x27;s example claims that because two adjacent bits make a white block, there are in fact two bits per pixel: one which activates the purple left half of the pixel, and the other which activates the green right half of the pixel. If the programmer instead activates the green right half of a pixel and the purple left half of the next pixel, then the result is a white block that is 1/2 pixel to the right, which is indeed an instance of subpixel rendering. However, it is not clear whether any programmers of the Apple II have considered the pairs of bits as pixels‚Äîinstead calling each bit a pixel.

The flag bit in each byte affects color by shifting pixels half a pixel-width to the right. This half-pixel shift was exploited by some graphics software, such as HRCG (High-Resolution Character Generator), an Apple utility that displayed text using the high-resolution graphics mode, to smooth diagonals.

=== ClearType ===
Microsoft announced its subpixel rendering technology, called ClearType, at COMDEX in 1998. Microsoft published a paper in May 2000, &quot;Displaced Filtering for Patterned Displays,&quot; describing the filtering behind ClearType. It was then made available in Windows XP, but it was not activated by default until Windows Vista. (Windows XP OEMs, however, could and did change the default setting.)

=== FreeType ===

FreeType, the library used by most current software on the X Window System, contains two open source implementations. The original implementation uses the ClearType antialiasing filters and carries the following notice: &quot;The colour filtering algorithm of Microsoft&#x27;s ClearType technology for subpixel rendering is covered by patents; for this reason the corresponding code in FreeType is disabled by default. Note that subpixel rendering per se is prior art; using a different colour filter thus easily circumvents Microsoft&#x27;s patent claims.&quot;

FreeType offers a variety of color filters. Since version 2.6.2, the default filter is &quot;light&quot;, a filter that is both normalized (value sums up to 1) and color-balanced (eliminate color fringes at the cost of resolution).

Since version 2.8.1, a second implementation exists, called &quot;Harmony&quot;, that &quot;offers high quality LCD-optimized output without resorting to ClearType techniques of resolution tripling and filtering&quot;. This is the method enabled by default. When using this method, &quot;each color channel is generated separately after shifting the glyph outline, capitalizing on the fact that the color grids on LCD panels are shifted by a third of a pixel. This output is indistinguishable from ClearType with a light 3-tap filter.&quot; Since the Harmony method does not require additional filtering, it is not covered by the ClearType patents.

===CoolType===

Adobe created their own subpixel renderer called CoolType, allowing them to display documents the same way across various operating systems: Windows, MacOS, Linux etc. When it was launched around the year 2001, CoolType supported a wider range of fonts than Microsoft&#x27;s ClearType, which at the time was limited to TrueType fonts, whereas Adobe&#x27;s CoolType also supported PostScript fonts (and their OpenType equivalent as well).

=== macOS ===

Mac OS X (later OS¬†X, now macOS) used to use subpixel rendering as well, as part of Quartz 2D. However, it was removed after the introduction of Retina displays. Unlike Microsoft&#x27;s implementation, which favors a tight fit to the grid (font hinting) to maximize legibility, Apple&#x27;s implementation prioritizes the shape of the glyphs as set out by their designer.

He sang lead vocals on several of their hits, including &quot;Just What I Needed&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, &quot;Moving in Stereo&quot;, and &quot;Drive&quot;. He also had a moderate solo hit with &quot;Stay the Night&quot;.

Orr was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Cars in 2018.

== Early life ==
Benjamin Orzechowski was born in Lakewood, Ohio to immigrant parents. His mother, Elizabeth (&quot;n√©e&quot; Al≈æbeta Benov√°), was Carpatho-Rusyn, born in present-day Koj≈°ov, Slovakia, and his father, Charles Orzechowski, was of Polish origin, born in present-day Ukraine. Both were devout Byzantine Rite Catholics and Ben&#x27;s mother would not allow him to drive his first car until the local clergy had blessed it. His family actively supported his musical endeavors. He became proficient in several instruments including the guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, and drums.

Known locally as &quot;Benny 11 Letters&quot;, he grew up in Lakewood, Ohio, and Parma, Ohio and attended Valley Forge High School before joining local band the Grasshoppers in 1964.

== Career ==

=== The Grasshoppers: 1964‚Äì1965 ===
Formed in Cleveland, Ohio, the Grasshoppers were an instrumental-based foursome. Their featured band members were Louis Pratile (lead guitar), Jerry Zadar (bass guitar), and Sid Turner (drummer). They were joined by the then-seventeen-year-old Orzechowski, who became their lead singer, rhythm guitarist, and sometimes doubled as a drummer.

In 1965, the Grasshoppers released two singles on the Sunburst label: &quot;Mod Socks&quot; and &quot;Pink Champagne (and Red Roses)&quot;, the latter written by Orzechowski.

The Grasshoppers (and later the Mixed Emotions) were also the house band on the &quot;Big 5 Show&quot;, more commonly known as &quot;Upbeat&quot;, a musical variety television show produced by WEWS-TV in Cleveland.

=== Mixed Emotions: 1966 ===
The Grasshoppers dissolved in 1966 when two of the band members were drafted into the U.S. Army. Orzechowski then played in the band Mixed Emotions, which featured Joe Kurelic (drummer), Chris Kamburoff (rhythm guitar), David Gardina (bass guitar), and Jimmy Vince with Orzechowski (lead guitar) as lead vocalists. The band recorded three unreleased tracks: &quot;Forever You Have My Heart&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Do My Cryin&#x27; In The Rain&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;.

He later joined another band, the Colours. Eventually Orzechowski was drafted as well, although he received a deferment after approximately a year and a half in the Army.

=== Various groups: ID Nirvana, Leatherwood ===
Orr first met Ric Ocasek in Cleveland in the mid-1960s, after Ocasek saw Orr performing with the Grasshoppers on the &quot;Big 5 Show&quot;. A few years later, Orr moved to Columbus, Ohio, where he and Ocasek formed a musical partnership that would continue in various incarnations (until the breakup of the Cars in 1988). In the late 1960s, they formed the bands ID Nirvana and Leatherwood, performing in and around Ohio State University.

=== Milkwood: 1970‚Äì1972 ===
In the early 1970s, after moving to Boston, Massachusetts, the two musicians formed the folk trio Milkwood with guitarist Jim Goodkind. The group was named after a Dylan Thomas poem called &quot;Under Milkwood&quot;. In 1972, the group released one album, &quot;How&#x27;s the Weather?&quot; under Paramount Records which failed to chart. From the list of songs on the album, Orr wrote &quot;Lincoln Park&quot;.

=== Various groups: Ocasek &amp; Orr, Richard and the Rabbits ===
Remaining in Boston, the duo Ocasek and Orr then formed another band, Richard and the Rabbits, featuring keyboardist Greg Hawkes.

=== Cap&#x27;n Swing: 1975‚Äì1976 ===
This was followed by another Ocasek and Orr band, Cap&#x27;n Swing, &quot;an almost famous band&quot;. The additional band members included guitarist Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes, Todd Roberto, Danny (Schliftman) Louis, and Glenn Evans.

They would perform songs such as &quot;City Lights&quot;, &quot;Jezebel&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Moonlight&quot;, &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Come Back Down&quot;. A few of these songs would make an appearance in the early days of the Cars, in 1977. In later years, there was a CD released labeled the &quot;Jezebel&quot; album, which contained demos.

After the group broke up in 1976, Orr, Ocasek, Hawkes, Easton and drummer David Robinson formed the Cars.

=== The Cars: 1977‚Äì1988 ===

As a member of the Cars, Orr sang lead vocal on some of the band&#x27;s best-known songs, including their first hit in the top 40, &quot;Just What I Needed&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, and &quot;Drive&quot;, their highest-charting single in the United States.

Orr&#x27;s work with the Cars spanned eleven years and six studio albums culminating with &quot;Door to Door&quot;, before the group disbanded in 1988. Afterwards, he and the other members pursued solo work.

=== Solo career ===

Orr released his only solo album, &quot;The Lace&quot;, in 1986. He cowrote the music and lyrics with his long-time girlfriend Diane Grey Page, who also sang backing vocals and appeared on the album&#x27;s back cover.

The album featured a top-40 pop and top-10 album rock hit, &quot;Stay the Night&quot;. An accompanying music video for the song was played in heavy rotation on MTV. A second single, &quot;Too Hot to Stop&quot;, was also released, but did not chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, although it reached No. 25 on the album rock chart.

In the late 1980s, Orr worked with Joni Mitchell&#x27;s husband Larry Klein, who coproduced &quot;The Lace&quot;. Orr provided backing vocals for &quot;Number One&quot; and &quot;The Beat of Black Wings&quot; for Mitchell&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, Orr recorded tracks with guitarist John Kalishes for an unreleased follow-up album to &quot;The Lace&quot;, including a rendition of Stan Meissner&#x27;s &quot;River of Fire&quot;. Although the album was never officially released, multiple tracks exist.

=== Various groups: ORR Band, Voices of Classic Rock, Big People ===
From 1998 until his death in 2000, Orr performed with his own band ORR and two side bands, Voices of Classic Rock with Mickey Thomas and John Cafferty, and cover band Big People with Pat Travers, Jeff Carlisi (of 38 Special), Derek St. Holmes (of Ted Nugent&#x27;s band) and Liberty DeVitto (of Billy Joel&#x27;s band).

== Personal life ==
Orr was married twice and had one son.

== Illness and death ==
In April 2000, Orr was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and hospitalized. However, he continued to perform with the band Big People throughout that summer at music festivals and state fairs. He reunited with the Cars one last time in Atlanta for an interview that was included in the Rhino Records concert video &quot;The Cars Live&quot;.

Orr died from the disease at his home in Atlanta on October 3, 2000, at the age of 53. He had made his final public appearance on September 27, performing with Big People in Alaska. Bandmates Jeff Carlisi, Derek St. Holmes and Rob Wilson were at Orr&#x27;s bedside when he died.

Ric Ocasek wrote and recorded the song &quot;Silver&quot; as a musical tribute to Orr. It appeared on Ocasek&#x27;s 2005 solo album &quot;Nexterday&quot;. The Cars reunited ten years after Orr&#x27;s death and released their seventh studio album, &quot;Move Like This&quot;, in May 2011. Orr was given special thanks in the liner notes: &quot;Ben, your spirit was with us on this one.&quot;

<doc id="593711" wikidata="Q916928" url="?curid=593711" title="Newell Highway">
<text>Newell Highway is a national highway in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. It provides the major road link between southeastern Queensland and Victoria via central NSW and as such carries large amounts of freight. At in length, the Newell is the longest highway in NSW, and passes through fifteen local government areas.

The highway is named in honour of H. H. Newell, the first Commissioner for Main Roads in New South Wales (1932‚Äì1941). It is designated route A39 for its entire length.

==Route==
From its northern terminus at Goondiwindi in Queensland, where it meets the Cunningham and Leichhardt Highways, and forms the southward extension of Cunningham Highway from Warwick and Brisbane, the Newell runs south across the Queensland-New South Wales border through Boggabilla, Moree, Narrabri, Coonabarabran, Gilgandra, Dubbo, Parkes, Forbes, West Wyalong, Narrandera, Jerilderie, and . Its southern terminus is where it crosses the Murray River (part of the border between New South Wales and Victoria) at Tocumwal and becomes Goulburn Valley Highway in Victoria, to eventually join Hume Highway at Seymour. The highway runs generally north‚Äìsouth, parallel to the coast of NSW but about inland, and is the most direct road link from Victoria to southeastern Queensland, bypassing the more urbanised and congested coastal areas of the state, and in doing so avoiding the difficult coastal topography of the New South Wales North Coast, traversed by Pacific Highway.

The terrain that the highway traverses is generally flat to gently undulating, with long, straight sections joined by the occasional curved section. However, passing through the Warrumbungle Range, there are steeper grades and tighter curves than on the rest of the highway.

The Newell intersects the following highways: Bruxner (at Boggabilla), Carnarvon and Gwydir (at Moree), Kamilaroi (at Narrabri), Oxley (east) (north of Coonabarabran), Castlereagh and Oxley (west) (at Gilgandra), Golden and Mitchell (at Dubbo), Mid-Western (east) at Marsden), Mid-Western (west) at West Wyalong), Sturt (at Gillenbah) and Riverina (at Finley).

Newell Highway is located entirely west of the Great Dividing Range, running largely along the foot of the western slopes of the range, and as such crosses nine major rivers, all west-flowing from the Great Dividing Range. From north to south these rivers are the Macintyre (at Goondiwindi), the Gwydir (10¬†km north of Moree), the Mehi (at Moree), the Namoi (near Narrabri), the Castlereagh (at Coonabarabran and again at Gilgandra), the Macquarie (at Dubbo), the Lachlan (at Forbes), the Murrumbidgee (at Narrandera), and the Murray (at Tocumwal). Some sections of the Newell Highway are subject to periodic flooding from these rivers, particularly north of Moree, at Dubbo, and south of Narrandera.

Other than short four-lane lengths within some of the urban areas through which it passes, Newell Highway is a single carriageway, two-lane road, although there are many overtaking lanes, with further overtaking lanes under construction for the next four years from 2021.

Traffic volumes along Newell Highway vary from around 1,200 to 4,000 vehicles per day in rural areas. In Dubbo, the largest urban centre through which the highway passes, average daily traffic volumes are in the order of 20,000 vehicles a day. Many heavy vehicles use the Newell Highway ‚Äì between 26 per cent and 52 per cent of all traffic, depending on the point along the highway. At one point in the Riverina region of NSW, the highway carries approximately 1,900 vehicles daily, of which about 32 per cent is heavy vehicles; while at another point in the north of the state, which carries the largest number of heavy vehicles, on average a truck passes every 60 seconds, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The speed limit on most rural sections of the highway is .

==History==
Before its declaration, Newell Highway existed as a collection of unrelated roads, many gazetted as separate entities. The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW). Main Road No. 6 was declared as part of Mid-Western Highway from West Wyalong and Marsden, Main Road No. 11 was declared as part of Oxley Highway from Gilgandra to Coonabarabran, Main Road No. 56 was declared from Gilgandra, Dubbo, Parkes and Forbes (and continuing northwards via Coonamble eventually to Walgett, and southwards via Cowra, Yass and Canberra eventually to the intersection with Queanbeyan-Braidwood Road, today Kings Highway, at Queanbeyan), Main Road No. 63 was declared from Boggabilla to the state border with Queensland at Goondiwindi (and continuing southwards via Yetman to Warialda and Bingara to the intersection with Great Northern Highway, today New England Highway, at Tamworth), Main Road No. 126 was declared from Boggabilla via Moree and Bellata to Narrabri (and continuing southeast via Boggabri and Gunnedah to Qurindi), Main Road No. 229 was declared from Wagga-Hay Road (today Sturt Highway) in Narrandera, via Jerilderie and Finley to the state border with Victoria at Tocumwal, Main Road No. 235 was declared from Forbes to Marsden (and continuing southwards via Morangarell and Stockinbingal to Cootamundra), and Main Road No. 243 was declared from Narranderra to Grong Grong (and continuing eastwards via Coolamon, Cootamundra and Harden to Bowning). With the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, these were amended to State Highways 6 and 11, Trunk Roads 56 and 63 and Main Roads 126 and 229 and 235 and 243 on 8 April 1929.

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the MRB in 1932, later declared Trunk Road 72 from the intersection with State Highway 12 (Gwydir Highway) in Moree via Bellata to Narrabri (and continuing southeast via Boggabri to Gunnedah) and Main Road 338 from Moree to Boggabilla, on 18 July 1933; the northern end of Main Road 126 was truncated to meet State Highway 11 (Oxley Highway) at Gunnedah. State Highway 17 was declared on 16 March 1938, from the intersection with State Highway 16 (later known as Bruxner Highway) at Boggabilla (which subsumed Trunk Road 63, declared on the same day) to the intersection with Gwydir Highway at Moree (subsuming Main Road 338), then from Moree via Narrabri to the intersection with Oxley Highway near Coonabarabran, then from Gilgandra via Dubbo, Parks and Forbes to the intersection with Mid-Western Highway at Marsden, then from West Wyalong via Ardlethan to the intersection with Sturt Highway at Narrendera, then from Narrandera, Jerilderie and Finley to the state border with Victoria at Tocumwal, subsuming Main Road 229; the northern ends of Trunk Roads 56 and 72 were truncated to meet State Highway 17 at Forbes and Narrabri respectively, Main Road 235 was truncated to meet State Highway 17 at Marsden, and Main Road 243 was truncated to meet State Highway 17 at Grong Grong, as a result. State Highway 17 was named &quot;Newell Highway&quot; on 2 July 1941, in honour of H. H. Newell, Commissioner for Main Roads 1932‚Äì41, following his death in office.

At the time of the gazettal of State Highway 17, it followed existing roads as far as possible, but between Coonabarabran and Narrabri and between Narrandera and West Wyalong no road existed. The section through the Pilliga Scrub between Coonabarabran and Narrabri was constructed during 1941‚Äì42 as a wartime defence project, and the section between Narrandera and West Wyalong was constructed in 1946‚Äì49. In 1952 the ultimate gazetted route of the highway between Narrandera and West Wyalong was altered from its original 1938 gazetted route.

Some sections of Newell Highway run concurrent along other highways. From north to south these are the Gwydir at Moree, the Kamilaroi at Narrabri, the Oxley (from 10¬†km north of Coonabarabran to Gilgandra), the Castlereagh through Gilgandra, the Mid-Western between Marsden and West Wyalong, and the Riverina (185 m through Finley). Previously, the declaration of Newell Highway was discontinuous, breaking where it shared concurrencies with these highways. As a consequence of its declaration as a National Highway in 1992, to simplify funding and administrative purposes, it was redeclared to form one continuous highway on 15 January 1993, breaking other highway declarations it shares concurrencies with.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Newell Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 17, from the state border with Queensland at Goondiwindi to the state border Victoria at Tocumwall.

Newell Highway was signed National Route 39 across its entire length in 1965. The Whitlam government introduced the federal &quot;National Roads Act 1974&quot;, where roads declared as a National Highway were still the responsibility of the states for road construction and maintenance, but were fully compensated by the Federal government for money spent on approved projects. As an important interstate link between the capitals of Queensland and Victoria, Newell Highway was declared a National Highway in 1992, and was consequently re-allocated National Highway 39. With both states&#x27; conversion to the newer alphanumeric system between 2005 and 2013, its route number was updated to route A39 for the highway within Queensland in 2005, and eventually within New South Wales in 2013.

Completion of the sealing of the full length of the highway occurred in 1972.

Town centre bypasses have been provided in Moree, Dubbo, Parkes and West Wyalong (heavy vehicle route). A town bypass at Ardlethan has also been constructed.

<doc id="593718" wikidata="Q250765" url="?curid=593718" title="Isorhythm">
<text>Isorhythm (from the Greek for &quot;the same rhythm&quot;) is a musical technique using a repeating rhythmic pattern, called a &quot;talea&quot;, in at least one voice part throughout a composition. &quot;Taleae&quot; are typically applied to one or more melodic patterns of pitches or &quot;colores&quot;, which may be of the same or a different length from the &quot;talea&quot;.

==History and development==

Isorhythms first appear in French motets of the 13th century, such as in the &quot;Montpellier Codex&quot;. Although 14th-century theorists used the words &quot;talea&quot; and &quot;color&quot;‚Äîthe latter in a variety of senses related to repetition and embellishment‚Äîthe term &quot;isorhythm&quot; was coined in 1904 by musicologist Friedrich Ludwig, initially to describe the practice in 13th-century polyphony. Ludwig later extended its use to the 14th-century music of Guillaume de Machaut. Subsequently, Heinrich Besseler and other musicologists expanded its scope further as an organizing structural element in 14th- and early 15th-century compositions‚Äîin particular, motets. Some of the earliest works organized around isorhythms are early 14th-century motets by various composers in an illuminated manuscript of the &quot;Roman de Fauvel&quot;. Two of the era&#x27;s most important composers of isorhythmic motets are Phillipe de Vitry and Guillaume de Machaut. Machaut&#x27;s second motet, , is an example of typical 14th-century use of isorhythm.

Isorhythm is a logical outgrowth of the rhythmic modes that governed most late medieval polyphony. Discarding modal-rhythmic limitations, isorhythm became a significant organizing principle of much of 14th-century French polyphony by extending the &quot;talea&quot; of an initial section to the entire composition in conjunction with variation of a corresponding &quot;color&quot;. &quot;The playful complexity of ...[&quot;taleae&quot;] that mixes mensuration and undergoes diminution by half‚Äîbecame a typical, even a defining feature of motets in the 14th century and beyond&quot;.

===Example===
The structural diagram shows the isorhythmic tenor voice of a late 14th-century motet, &quot;Sub arturo plebs / Fons citharizantium / In omnem terram&quot; by Johannes Alanus (&quot;c.&quot; late 14th century), featuring threefold isorhythmic diminution.

* Staff 1: preexisting Gregorian &quot;cantus firmus&quot; melody, from the first antiphon for the first nocturn of the commons for Apostles, &quot;In omnem terram exivit sonus eorum&quot; (&#x27;their voice has gone out into all the world&#x27;). The cantus firmus of the motet is a perfect fifth higher than the original chant; notes used for the tenor marked in red. 
* Staff 2: isorhythmic tenor as notated in mensural notation. Numbers 1‚Äì3 and brackets indicate three rhythmically identical sequences (&quot;taleae&quot;). The three mensuration signs in the beginning define the pattern of diminution, indicating &quot;tempus perfectum cum prolatione maiore, tempus perfectum cum prolatione minore&quot; and &quot;tempus imperfectum cum prolatione minore&quot;, respectively. (In the manuscript these signs are in fact found at the end of the line, together with a repetition sign.) 
* Staves 3‚Äì5: abbreviated transcription into modern notation. Each line represents one full repetition of the tenor&#x27;s melody (&quot;color&quot;), including the three &quot;taleae&quot; in each, resulting in a nine-part structure. (Within each &quot;color&quot;, only the first few notes of each &quot;talea&quot; are rendered here.) The three mensuration signs in the line above correspond to the change in time signatures: , , .

During the decades following and into the 15th century, upper voices became increasingly involved in isorhythmic organization. Many compositions became isorhythmic in all voices, a practice known as &quot;panisorhythm&quot;. In such compositions, the length of the color and talea are often unequal, causing the repetition of the melody in differing rhythmic patterns. As an example, if the &quot;color&quot; includes nine notes and the &quot;talea&quot; five, the &quot;color&quot; would have to be repeated five times before the two schemes again realign. Examples can be found in motets and Mass movements by John Dunstable, Johannes Ciconia and Guillaume Du Fay.

A 15th-century mass by a composer known only as Pycard found in the Old Hall manuscript (named for the English town in which it was eventually discovered), demonstrates the high sophistication and complexity of panisorhythmic techniques. The lower parts have a recurring &quot;color&quot; and &quot;talea&quot; that unite the composition. The upper parts have four different &quot;talea&quot;, one for each major section of the composition. The rhythmic relationship between upper and lower parts changes as the music progresses. Each quarter note in the lower part equals 4 quarter notes in the upper parts, creating an uneven ratio of 4:9 that causes the parts to lose synchronization. The lower part then steadily contracts in a series of Pythagorean proportions (12:9:8:6) until the parts come back into alignment.

As an analytical concept, isorhythm has proven valuable for understanding musical practices in other cultures; for example, the peyote culture songs of certain North American Indian groups and the music of India and Africa.

<text>Lord Howe Island Marine Park is the site of Australia&#x27;s and the world&#x27;s most southern coral reef ecosystem. The island is 10¬†km in length, 2¬†km wide and consists of a large lagoonal reef system along its leeward side, with 28 small islets along its coast. In 1999, the waters within three nautical miles of Lord Howe Island (465.45¬†km2) were declared a marine park under the &quot;NSW Marine Park Act&quot; 1997 to protect its unique marine biodiversity, with the park currently being managed by the New South Wales Marine Parks Authority. Both Lord Howe Island and Balls Pyramid are incorporated within the three nautical miles protected by the state marine park. Both marine parks complement the island&#x27;s status as a World Heritage Site.

Lord Howe Island is located approximately northeast of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Lord Howe Island is remote, has a biologically diverse marine system with a high degree of endemism. Lord Howe Island Marine Park was declared after it was recognised as an area with outstanding natural values, an extraordinary array of marine habitats and biodiversity, rich maritime cultural heritage and social and economic importance to the island community, giving it both national and international importance.

== History of management ==

=== Establishment of the Marine Park ===
The marine park was declared on 26 February 1999 under the &quot;Marine Parks Act&quot; 1997, with a zoning plan commencing on 1 December 2004 to protect the important natural and cultural values of the park while providing a range of sustainable uses. Due to its isolated geographic location, small size and limited access, there are a number of threats to biodiversity that require management. The marine park status helps protect marine biodiversity from fishing pressure and population pressure.

A range of scientific, social, cultural and economic information was collated to design the zoning plan. In August 2001 an Issues Paper was released for public comment and submissions reviewed. In June 2002, a draft zoning plan document was established outlining a number of options for zoning, incorporating the submissions gained through the public comment period, advice taken from the Lord Howe Island Marine Park Advisory Committee and a review of relevant information. This plan was released for public comment in December 2003 with a finalised zoning plan and implementation of marine park zones commencing on 1 December 2004. The waters from 3‚Äì12 nautical miles were declared a federal marine park on 21 June 2000, see Lord Howe Island Marine Park (Commonwealth waters).

=== Management practices ===
In 1999, the Commonwealth&#x27;s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) was enacted. The EPBC Act provides guidance about regional biodiversity conservation priorities through the implementation of the marine bioregional planning process. This process conserves marine biodiversity by considering the whole ecosystem a species is in and how different species interact in the marine environment. This process identified the regional conservation priorities in a number of different marine regions and identified the marine reserves to be added to Australia&#x27;s National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. Lord Howe Island Marine park was identified as requiring protection.

To protect the various marine conservation values associated with the waters around Lord Howe Island, the New South Wales government proclaimed the Lord Howe Island Marine Park in 1999. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 2004 that a zoning scheme came into force due to lengthy negotiations with stakeholders. This zoning scheme partitioned the coastal waters of Lord Howe Island to permit different human uses, in order to minimise the threat to marine conservation values.

The objectives of the zoning plan under the &quot;Marine Parks Act&quot; 1997 include: 1) to conserve marine biological diversity and marine habitats, 2) to maintain ecological processes, 3) where consistent with the preceding, to provide for ecologically sustainable use of fish and marine vegetation, and 4) to provide opportunities for public appreciation, understanding and enjoyment.

The zoning plan for the Lord Howe Island Marine Park provides various levels of biodiversity protection, regulating activities according to zones. 73.2% of the Marine Park, known as Habitat Protection Zones, allows most forms of fishing: charter boat and recreational, but excludes spearfishing. The other 26.8% of the Marine Park are zoned as seven Sanctuary Zones, where fishing, anchoring and other harmful human activities are excluded. While 0.004% (1.7ha) of the marine park is considered a Special Purpose Zone used for special management needs, specifically to allow limited fish feeding. Lord Howe Island Marine park does not contain any General Use zones, like other Marine Parks in New South Wales. The zoning plan also contains regulations on specific activities and provides additional protection on species of particular importance.

The zoning plan gives protection to important natural and cultural values of the marine park, while allowing sustainable use including swimming, surfing, charter and recreational fishing, scuba diving, sailing, boating and research. Visitor numbers are restricted on the island to control impacts to the Marine Park.

== Climate ==
Lord Howe Island has a temperate climate, with mean water temperatures of 25¬†¬∞C in summer and 18¬†¬∞C in winter. Annual rainfall is 1650¬†mm in the lowland parts of the island.

Lord Howe Island&#x27;s climate is moderated by oceanic air currents and mild sea temperatures. The island can be windy as the salt laden wind comes predominantly from the southeast and northeast and the mean wind speed is highest in late winter and spring.

== Biodiversity values ==

=== Geomorphology ===
Lord Howe Island is regarded as having high geological, geomorphological and geodiversity values, many of which extend to the habitats of the marine park. Lord Howe Island is situated at the southernmost limit of coral reef formation, receiving both tropical and temperate open ocean carbon environments. Slowly, over time Lord Howe Island is moving into reef forming seas due to the northward migration of Australia&#x27;s tectonic plate, which is moving 5‚Äì6¬†cm north per year.

A white sedimentary rock known as calcarenite is locally important within the marine park as it makes up the central and northern regions of the island to below sea level in several places. Calcarenite is formed through the cementing of calcareous algae, coral fragments and sand. Dating has indicated that calcarenite was deposited in the past 350,000 years during the Pleistocene period.

The beach and shallow-water calcarenites indicate a sea level around 2‚Äì3 m above the present level during the last interglacial period (130,000-70,000 years ago, Pleistocene). Little evidence of reefs during this time can be seen as they may have occupied locations similar to those of modern reefs or were largely destroyed following emergence once the sea level fell.

The fringing reef on the windward western coastline of Lord Howe Island absorbs wave energy and acts as a breakwater preventing storm surges from eroding the low lying central region of the island. The sheltered lagoon contains a number of different reef habitats, dominated by sand, lagoonal corals, gravel sheets, algal flats and patch reefs.

=== Ecology ===
The high conservation significance of Lord Howe Island and its waters is recognised by its inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1982. Conservation values relating to the marine park include the unique combination of tropical and temperature reef taxa, both flora and fauna. These unique taxa include a number of species at the limits of their distribution, reflecting the extreme latitude of the coral reef ecosystem, making Lord Howe Island Marine Park the southernmost true coral reef in the world.

Lord Howe Island Marine Park is also home to a high diversity of marine benthic algae, fishes and marine invertebrates and is associated with high levels of endemicity. Lord Howe Island was only discovered by humans in 1778, consequently the original flora and fauna has remained relatively untouched.

==== Flora ====
Three distinct marine habitat community types have been identified within the Marine Park: coral reefs, macroalgal beds, and offshore/open coast communities. The distribution of these depends on wave exposure. The Lord Howe Island Group supports more than 305 benthic algae species, including 47 endemic species. Hence, approximately 15% of the benthic algal species are endemic to the Lord Howe Island Marine Park. Also, two species of non-endemic sea grasses are found within the marine park: Eelgrass, &quot;Zostera muelleri&quot; subsp &quot;capricorni&quot; and Paddleweed, &quot;Halophila ovalis&quot;.

==== Fauna ====
The marine life comprise both subtropical and temperate species due to its location and influence of the southerly flowing East Australian Current (EAC). As a consequence, the waters surrounding Lord Howe Island show rich and unique biodiversity. An extensive barrier coral reef protects a broad sheltered lagoon and sandy beach on the western side of the island, while fringing reef occurs immediately offshore of the beaches on the eastern side.

The Lord Howe Island Group supports a diverse inshore fish fauna with greater than 400 species recorded. 10% of the marine inshore fish species are known to be endemic, meaning they are only found at Lord Howe Island, while 8% of the 110 species of echinoderms are also endemic. A wide variety of seabirds roost and nest on the island but feed on schools of fish and squid. This diversity reflects the mixing of tropical species with temperate species and the range of marine environments present.

== Human impacts, environmental issues and threats ==
It is becoming widely known that the world&#x27;s marine biodiversity is under threat due to overexploitation and degrading human activities, such as pollution rapidly changing species habitat and leading to species loss. Two species of plants, nine terrestrial birds, one bat and four invertebrate species have become locally extinct.

Isolated islands are under a disproportionate level of threat due to their small range and high level of endemic taxa. Even small human-induced disturbances can lead to species extinction. Key threatening processes relevant to the Lord Howe Island Marine Park include anthropogenic climate change, and entanglement in or ingestion of anthropogenic debris in marine environments.

Anthropogenic climate change is listed as a Key Threatening Process under the NSW &quot;Threatened Species Conservation (TSC) Act&quot; 1995 while loss of climatic habitat caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases is listed under the &quot;Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act&quot;. Climate change is likely to alter sea surface temperatures which can have severe consequences for seabird breeding.

There has been significant growth in people pressure over time. Visitor numbers have increased significantly as has the amount of available accommodation options. From 1988 to 2000 the Lord Howe Island population grew by 13%, the number of dwellings increased by 55% and the number of visitors increased by nearly 100%.

=== The marine littoral zone ===
Lord Howe Island has 37¬†km of shoreline or littoral zone, with only eight kilometres readily accessible. This eight kilometres has been most heavily impacted as most of the forest has been cleared to the edge of the beach, removing the buffer to strong prevalent winds, impacting the forest behind.

=== The lagoon ===
The lagoon is six kilometres long and 1.5¬†km wide and contains the largest of Lord Howe Island&#x27;s coral reef system, assessed as having World Heritage values. The main identified threats to the marine environment are the impact of water quality welling up in the lagoon from groundwater, the potential changes of turbidity affecting the clarity of water in the lagoon, the impact from anchor damage (outside as well as inside the lagoon), overfishing particularly of the slower growing fish species which inhabit the drop-off, and dramatic water temperature changes causing coral bleaching and death of other marine species.

== Results of management ==
To abate human influence on marine biodiversity worldwide, marine parks are becoming widely advocated as a tool for conserving biodiversity and managing overfishing. Elsewhere, protected areas such as marine reserves have been attributed to increased species densities, biodiversity, species growth, biomass, and reproductive output. It is a similar case for the Lord Howe Island Marine Park

Species habitat is typically used as the major component of designing marine parks: if a number of habitat classes are protected, so are the species within them, hence effectively protecting and hopefully in turn increasing marine biodiversity. This is the goal of the marine park at Lord Howe Island.

A study conducted in 2010, six years after the implementation of zoning showed the mean number of fish species, density and biomass of fishes is typically higher in sanctuary zones than in habitat protection zones where fishing is allowed. The mean cover of hard corals was also higher in sanctuary zones.

Sanctuary zones have been found successful in protecting key species and biomass, though longer term datasets and further research into increasing subtidal macro algal communities in sanctuary zones is required.

A review of other research following the implementation of the Marine Park has outlined a number of successes and negative outcomes. This research found the Galapagos shark, &quot;Carcharhinus galapagensis&quot; increased in number in sanctuary zones, while there was an increase in abundance of the endemic double header wrasse, &quot;Coris bulbifrons&quot;, bluefish, &quot;Girella cyanea&quot; and the spotted sawtail, &quot;Prionurus maculates&quot;, in sanctuary zones.

Negative outcomes have shown populations of the habitat modifying urchin, &quot;Centrostaphanus rodgersii&quot;, increased threefold between 2006-2010 and densities of the second most abundant urchin, &quot;Heliocidaris tuberculata&quot;, has doubled. If sea urchins become overpopulated, they can have major impacts on reef systems through overgrazing of important algae. Other negatives include a large and significant decline in population of bluefish within habitat protection zones.

While there will continue to be both success and failures following the implementation of the marine park, the successes will continue to outweigh the failures until such time that equilibrium within the marine ecosystem is reached, this can take up to 20 years from the date of implementation.

<doc id="593723" wikidata="Q512602" url="?curid=593723" title="Androcles">
<text>Androcles (, alternatively spelled Androclus in Latin) is the main character of a common folk tale about a man befriending a lion.

The tale is included in the Aarne‚ÄìThompson classification system as type 156. The story reappeared in the Middle Ages as &quot;The Shepherd and the Lion&quot; and was then ascribed to Aesop&#x27;s Fables. It is numbered 563 in the Perry Index and can be compared to Aesop&#x27;s &quot;The Lion and the Mouse&quot; in both its general trend and in its moral of the reciprocal nature of mercy.

== Classical tale ==
The earliest surviving account of the Androcles episode is found in Aulus Gellius&#x27;s 2nd century &quot;Attic Nights&quot;. The author relates there a story told by Apion in his lost work &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;/Œë·º∞Œ≥œÖœÄœÑŒπŒ±Œ∫Œ¨ &quot;(Wonders of Egypt)&quot;, the events of which Apion claimed to have personally witnessed in Rome. In this version, Androclus (going by the Latin variation of the name) is a runaway slave of a former Roman consul administering a part of Rome. He takes shelter in a cave, which turns out to be the den of a wounded lion, from whose paw he removes a large thorn. In gratitude, the lion becomes tame towards him and henceforward shares his catch with the slave.

After three years, Androclus craves a return to civilization but is soon imprisoned as a fugitive slave and sent to Rome. There, he is condemned to be devoured by wild animals in the Circus Maximus in the presence of an emperor who is named in the account as Gaius Caesar, presumably Caligula. The most imposing of the beasts turns out to be the same lion, which again displays its affection toward Androclus. After questioning him, the emperor pardons the slave in recognition of this testimony to the power of friendship, and he is left in possession of the lion. Apion, who claimed to have been a spectator on this occasion, is then quoted as relating:

Afterwards we used to see Androclus with the lion attached to a slender leash, making the rounds of the tabernae throughout the city; Androclus was given money, the lion was sprinkled with flowers, and everyone who met them anywhere exclaimed, &quot;This is the lion, a man&#x27;s friend; this is the man, a lion&#x27;s doctor&quot;.

The story was repeated a century later by Claudius Aelianus in his work &quot;On the Nature of Animals&quot;.

However, an alternative version of the start of the story was related by Thomas Keightley in the introduction to his book on Classical mythology. In explanation of the origin of a temple to &#x27;The Gaping Dionysos&#x27; on the island of Samos, a story was told by Pliny the Elder of its foundation by a Samian named Elpis who encountered a gaping lion on the African seashore and freed it of a bone in its teeth that was preventing its feeding. Thereafter the lion shared a portion of its prey with Elpis until his departure.

==Later use==

Later versions of the story, sometimes attributed to Aesop, began to appear from the mid-sixth century under the title &quot;The Shepherd and the Lion&quot;. In Chr√©tien de Troyes&#x27; 12th-century romance, &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;, the knightly main character helps a lion that is attacked by a serpent. The lion then becomes his companion and helps him during his adventures. A century later, the story of taking a thorn from a lion&#x27;s paw was related as an act of Saint Jerome in the Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine (). Afterwards the lion joins him in the monastery and a different set of stories follows.

The later retelling, &quot;Of the Remembrance of Benefits&quot;, in the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot; (Deeds of the Romans) of about 1330 in England, has a mediaeval setting and again makes the protagonist a knight. In the earliest English printed collection of Aesop&#x27;s Fables by William Caxton, the tale appears as &quot;The lyon &amp; the pastour or herdman&quot; and reverts to the story of a shepherd who cares for the wounded lion. He is later convicted of a crime and taken to Rome to be thrown to the wild beasts, only to be recognised and defended from the other animals by the one that he tended.

A Latin poem by Vincent Bourne dating from 1716‚Äì17 is based on the account of Aulus Gellius. Titled &quot;Mutua Benevolentia primaria lex naturae est&quot;, it was translated by William Cowper as &quot;Reciprocal kindness: the primary law of nature&quot;.

George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; (1912) makes Androcles a tailor; he is also given Christian beliefs for the purposes of the play, which on the whole takes a sceptical view of religion. The first film adaptation of the story in the US was also made in 1912. Afterwards there were several others for both cinema and TV. Rob Englehart&#x27;s &quot;The Lion, the Slave and the Rodent&quot; (2010) was a much later American approach to the fable. A one-act chamber opera for five voices, it combined the story of Androcles with the fable of &quot;The Lion and the Mouse&quot;.

==Artistic depictions==
===Prints and paintings===
Renaissance prints of the story are based on the Classical accounts. Agostino Veneziano depicts the slave Androcles being freed by the emperor in a work from 1516‚Äì17 now in the LACMA collection. There is also an early pen and wash drawing by Baldassare Peruzzi dating from the 1530s in the Hermitage Museum. Dependent on the account by Aulus Gellius, it depicts Androcles walking through a doorway with the lion on a lead at his heel. Other artists have preferred the scene of Androcles pulling the thorn from the lion&#x27;s paw, as in Bernhard Rode&#x27;s print of 1784. A later American example is Walter Inglis Anderson&#x27;s block print scroll of 1950, which was based on his 1935 painting.

Paintings of the subject began in the 18th century. That by Charles Meynier, which was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1795, is now lost. However, a study for the painting has recently been discovered and shows Androcles as a nearly naked warrior brandishing his sword in the stadium while the lion lies on the ground and is ‚Äì following the account of Aulus Gellius ‚Äì &quot;gently licking his feet&quot;. There are also studies for an unachieved painting by American artist Henry Ossawa Tanner dating from his student years in 1885-86. They include a lion licking its paw and a kneeling and grey-bearded Androcles. At mid-century in 1856 comes &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; by the English artist Alexander Davis Cooper (1820‚Äì95). There a young man in Arab dress looks towards the viewer as he walks across a desert landscape with his hand in the lion&#x27;s mane.

In the 20th century, Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me depicted Androcles in a painting tentatively dated 1902 and now in the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires). There Androcles is sitting cross-legged on the floor of the cave as he draws the thorn from the lion&#x27;s paw while it roars in agony. Briton Riviere&#x27;s 1908 painting of him standing to perform the same task is in the Auckland Art Gallery. Another approach was to show the earlier incident of Androcles surprised in the cave by the lion&#x27;s entrance. This was the subject chosen by Vassily Rotschev (d.1803) soon after returning to Russia from training in Rome. It was also the choice of the Chinese painter Xu Beihong. His &quot;Slave and Lion&quot; dates from a stay in Berlin during the early 1920s and shows the lion entering the mouth of a cave while Androcles cowers against the wall.

===Sculptures===
Androcles also became a sculptural subject. Jan Pieter van Baurscheit the Elder&#x27;s sandstone statue, executed between 1700 and 1725, is now at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and shows a triumphant figure bestriding a very small lion that rears up to look at him. Its frisky behaviour brings to mind Aulus Gellius&#x27; description of the lion &quot;wagging his tail in a mild and caressing way, after the manner and fashion of fawning dogs&quot;. In 1751 the English monumental sculptor Henry Cheere created two white marble chimneypieces showing the slave bending over the lion&#x27;s paw to draw out the thorn. One is in the Saloon at West Wycombe Park, and the other is now in the Lady Lever Art Gallery. A continental example by Jean-Baptiste Stouf was sculpted in 1789 and is now only known through the modern bronze reproduction at the Ashmolean Museum. Formerly it was in the Louvre and showed Androcles tending the lion&#x27;s paw.

In the 19th century Androcles became a subject for French table ornaments. One from 1820 shows him sword in hand in the arena as the lion crouches at his feet, while another from 1825 has him tending the injured paw. About 1898, Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, who was soon to paint that scene too, produced a sculpture of Androcles leading the lion about on his tour of the Roman taverns. Titled &quot;Le Mendiant&quot; (the beggar), it is made of bronze gilt and shows the former slave standing with one hand on the lion&#x27;s mane and a begging bowl at his feet. On its stand is the inscription &quot;Date obolum Androcli&quot; (spare a penny for Androclus). In the 20th century the American sculptor Frederick Charles Shrady incorporated the theme of removing the thorn from the paw into a modernistic design.

===Medals===
The legend has figured on medals for various reasons over the course of four centuries. One attributed to Gioacchino Francesco Travani, using a design by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, was struck in 1659. It depicts on one side a relief bust of Pope Alexander VII surrounded by an acanthus leaf border. On the reverse a lion prostrates itself at the feet of an armed Androcles. The complimentary Latin inscription reads &#x27;Domenico Jacobacci to the generous prince: Even a wild animal remembers a favor&#x27;. Jacobacci was the donor of the medal, which commemorates a pope who had been generous in rebuilding parts of Rome. The lion represents the grateful city paying homage at the feet of the &#x27;warrior&#x27; on its behalf.

The image of the grateful beast was a natural choice for the medals awarded in yearly recognition of prize-winners at the Royal Dick Veterinary College in Edinburgh. Struck in copper and silver during the 1890s, they picture Androcles kneeling to relieve the suffering lion. In the background are a cliff on the left and palm trees on the right; Androcles is depicted with African features. A more schematic representation now forms the logo of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Utrecht University.

In the 20th century, the Dutch Medal of Recognition 1940‚Äì1945 also pictured the scene of relieving the lion and was awarded to those who aided the Dutch during the period of World War II, or afterwards helped those who had suffered from the German occupation. The subject was chosen because a lion was the national symbol. The theme of gratitude is reinforced by the inscription about the edge: &quot;Sibi benefacit qui benefacit amico&quot; (He benefits himself who benefits a friend).

<text>Boxing in the 1920s was an exceptionally popular international sport. Many fights during this era, some 20 years away or so from the television era, were social events with many thousands in attendance, both men and women. 

World heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey dominated the sport through much of the decade. He won the title in 1919, keeping it until 1926. He lost the title to Gene Tunney in 1926, but many of his fights were historic, such as his defenses against Georges Carpentier, Luis Firpo and Tom Gibbons, a fight which almost bankrupted the town of Shelby, Montana. His 1927 rematch against Tunney became known in boxing history as &quot;The Long Count Fight&quot;. Dempsey became a household name, and he dated and married Hollywood actresses. He was, along with Babe Ruth, Red Grange, Bill Tilden and Bobby Jones, one of the so-called &quot;Big Five of sports&quot;.
Other important boxers included Benny Lynch (from western Scotland). Panama Al Brown was the first Hispanic to become a world champion.

Because airlines lacked the structured schedules of the modern days, many boxers had to make their way to important fights by train. 

In 1921, the National Boxing Association was formed. It was the predecessor of what is known now as the WBA. Tex Rickard was the leading promoter of the day, and he has been compared to P.T. Barnum and Don King.

<text>The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (often referred to as, &quot;The Fusiliers&quot;) is an infantry regiment of the British Army, part of the Queen&#x27;s Division. Currently, the regiment has two battalions: the 1st Battalion, part of the Regular Army, is an armoured infantry battalion based in Tidworth, Wiltshire, and the 5th Battalion, part of the Army Reserve, recruits in the traditional fusilier recruiting areas across England. The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers was largely unaffected by the infantry reforms that were announced in December 2004, but under the Army 2020 reduction in the size of the Army, the 2nd Battalion was merged into the first in 2014.

==History==
The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers was formed on 23 April 1968 as part of the reforms of the British Army that saw the creation of &#x27;large infantry regiments&#x27;, by the amalgamation of the four English Fusilier regiments:

*Royal Northumberland Fusiliers
* Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers
* Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)
* Lancashire Fusiliers

The 3rd Battalion of the regiment saw active service in Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991. All battalions were also deployed to Northern Ireland on Operation Banner multiple times.

In 2003, the 1 Fusiliers battlegroup was at the forefront of the coalition invasion of Iraq, ultimately occupying the city of Basra. Over the next decade, the regiment carried out multiple operational tours of Iraq.

In 2006, elements of the 2nd Battalion were deployed to Afghanistan to support the International Security Assistance Force. Deployed to the town of Now Zad in Helmand Province, they rapidly found themselves fighting off a sustained Taliban attack that lasted for 107 days - the longest siege of British troops since World War II. Over the following years, elements of the regiment deployed on several occasions to Afghanistan and saw heavy fighting. Most recently, the entire 1st Battalion deployed to Nahri Saraj District in Helmand in 2013, where they took part in mounted and dismounted infantry operations.

The regiment received a reserve battalion, the 5th battalion, through the redesignation of the Tyne-Tees Regiment, on 1 April 2006.

In September 2014, the 2nd Battalion was amalgamated with the 1st Battalion under Army 2020, forming just one regular battalion - an armoured infantry battalion under 1st Armoured Infantry Brigade.

==Structure==

===1st Battalion===
The 1st Battalion is an armoured infantry battalion based in Tidworth Camp, Wiltshire. Equipped with the Warrior IFV, the battalion is part of the army&#x27;s 3rd Division and is held at high readiness as part of the army&#x27;s armoured war-fighting reserve. In 2016, the battalion was the army&#x27;s Lead Armoured Battlegroup and was held at extremely high readiness in case it was required to deploy anywhere in the world at short notice. The battalion is highly experienced with multiple deployments in the last two decades to Bosnia, Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. Many soldiers from the 2nd Battalion joined the 1st Battalion on the merger, increasing the operational experience within the ranks. More recently, the 1st Battalion deployed around the world on exercise in places as diverse as Brunei, Kenya, the Baltic States and Canada.

The 1st Battalion also regularly works in support of the civil powers in the UK. In 2013, large elements of the battalion were deployed to Wraysbury and the surrounding area to support the flood relief efforts.

The battalion won the Army Boxing Championships in 2016, beating the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment in the final.

===5th Battalion===
The 5th Battalion is a Reserve battalion with its headquarters in the northeast of England. As a battalion within the 3rd (United Kingdom) Division, the 5th Battalion specialises in armoured infantry operations and has deployed all over the world on operations and on exercise both as a formed unit and as individual augmentees to the 1st Battalion. The 5th Battalion is now paired with the 1st Battalion and continues to support them in operations and on exercise.

5th Battalion maintains subunits at the following locations:
* RHQ - Newcastle upon Tyne
* HQ Company - Anzio House, Newcastle
* A Company - Birmingham
* C (London) Company - Balham and Blackheath
* W (Gallipoli) Company - Bolton and Bury
* X Company - Newcastle upon Tyne and Hexham
* Z Company - Alnwick and Cramlington
* Anti-Tank Platoon - Blackheath
* Recce Platoon - Alnwick

==Hackle==
As a Fusilier regiment, the Fusiliers wear a hackle ‚Äì the red-over-white hackle of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers. This distinction was originally a white plume which, according to regimental tradition, men of the 5th Regiment of Foot had taken from the headdress of fallen French troops at St. Lucia in December 1778. In 1829, King George IV ordered the white plume to be worn by all infantry regiments, and in order not to take away from the 5th (Northumberland) Regiment of Foot&#x27;s peculiar distinction and reflecting the &quot;gallantry of the exploits&quot; it commemorated &#x27; (according to legend the original plumes were stained red with the blood of their foes), their plume was differentiated by being made &quot;half red and half white, the red uppermost, instead of the plain white feather worn by the rest of the army per the 1829 order, as a peculiar mark of honour.&quot;

==Victoria Crosses==
The combined Victoria Crosses of the Fusiliers and its ancestor regiments total fifty five. Of particular note are the first and last Victoria Crosses of the First World War - won by Lt Dease and Pte Godley at Mons in 1914 and Sgt Pearse in North Russia in 1919 - and the famous &quot;Six VCs Before Breakfast&quot; won at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915.

==Mascot==
The regiment&#x27;s traditional mascot is an Indian Blackbuck Antelope called Bobby, inherited from the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers. However, Indian Blackbuck Antelopes are now protected under animal welfare rules and the Regiment has not been allowed one for several years. As a substitute, the Regiment uses an Otterhound called George, who holds the rank of Fusilier and attends all the major parades in which the Regiment is involved.

==Roses==
To mark certain Regimental Days, the Fusiliers wear roses in their headdress and bedeck the Battalion Colours with garlands. The tradition comes from their victory at the Battle of Minden, where, according to legend, soldiers marched at dawn to battle through rose fields and so went into action with the roses adorning their headdress. On St Georges Day, they wear red and white roses. On Minden Day, they wear red and yellow roses. New Fusilier Officers also must eat a rose at their first Minden Dinner on joining the Regiment.

==Colours==
The Queen‚Äôs Colour of each battalion of the regiment is identical except for the battalion numeral. The field of this Colour is blue which is the same as the facing colour of the Regiment. The Regimental title is in gold in a crimson circle within a Union Wreath of roses, thistles and shamrocks. The Regimental title is in gold in a crimson circle within a Union Wreath of roses, thistles and shamrocks. St George within the Garter, which is the centre badge, is on a crimson ground within the circle. The whole is ensigned with St Edward‚Äôs Crown. Forty battle honours, 20 in respect of World War I and 20 in respect of World War II, are borne on scrolls in gold in three groups of six honours on each horizontal arm of St George‚Äôs Cross and one group of four honours on the lower vertical arm of the Cross. Honours are emblazoned in chronological order by theatres across the horizontal arm of the Cross and vertically on the lower arm of the Cross. The fringe is of crimson and gold alternate strands. Honorary distinction badges of the four former regiments are borne in each canton of the Colour:
* The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers - The United red and white rose slipped ensigned with the Royal Crest, in the upper canton nearer the pike.
* Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers - On a mount vert an Antelope statant argent, attired, tufted, ducally gorged and rope reflexed over the back, in the upper canton further from the pike.

* Royal Fusiliers - On a mount vert the White Horse of Hanover, in the lower canton nearer the pike.
* Lancashire Fusiliers - The red rose of Lancaster with two petals uppermost, in the lower canton further from the pike and The Sphinx, superscribed on a scroll ‚ÄòEgypt‚Äô, immediately below the tie of the large laurel wreath bearing the Battle Honour scrolls.
Finally, thirty-eight battle honours, which were borne on the Regimental Colours of the four former regiments, are emblazoned on gold scrolls placed on the branches of a large laurel wreath outside the Union Wreath.

The Drummer‚Äôs Colour (or Wilhelmstahl Colour) is of gosling green silk edged with gold, embroidered with St George and the Dragon in the centre, with red scrolls edged with gold, above and below. The motto of the Northumberland Fusiliers ‚ÄòQUO FATA VOCANT‚Äô is, on the upper scroll, and the word ‚ÄòNORTHUMBERLAND‚Äô between V REGT, also in gold, on the lower scroll. A wreath of green laurel with red berries and the ‚Äòslipped‚Äô red and white rose surmounted by a crown in the four corners, makes up the design. This unusual third colour is traditionally carried by the youngest drummer on the annual St George&#x27;s Day parade.

==Band==
A volunteer regimental band is sported by the 5th Battalion, based at the St George&#x27;s Army Reserve Centre. Officially known as the Band and Corps of Drums, it consists of 30 servicemen who marching in the full dress uniform of the regiment and performs by permission of the Commanding Officer of Fifth
Fusiliers. The corps of drums have a role in the band, leading parades and performing their black light show.

Until the Strategic Defence Review of 1998 the Regiment had two Territorial Army bands: the Northumberland Band of the 6th Battalion and the Warwickshire Band of the 5th Battalion. After the review, the Northumberland Band became the Northumbria Band of the Tyne-Tees Regiment while the Warwickshire Band was removed from the TA establishment and continued as a civilian band. In 2006, it was renamed to the Band of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. The Lancashire
Association Band of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers is also a volunteer band of the regiment.

===Previous active duty bands===
In April 1968, each of the four regular battalions inherited a battalion band. In November 1969, the 4th battalion band was merged into the other three bands. The regiment chose to form two full size bands in 1984; one being titled as &quot;The Duke of Kent&#x27;s Band&quot; and the other as &quot;The St George&#x27;s&quot; Band.

<text>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-8 &quot;Utka&quot; (, &quot;duck&quot;) was a Soviet experimental aircraft. Built of wood, the aircraft was designed and built in 1945 to test the novel canard configuration. It also used a tricycle undercarriage, the first used by the OKB. It was modified to test a variety of vertical stabilizer and wingtip configurations and was later used as a liaison aircraft for many years by the design bureau.

==Design and development==
Nicknamed &quot;Utka&quot; (&quot;duck&quot;), as the word &quot;canard&quot; (referring to its small forward wing) is French for &quot;duck&quot;, and with the Russian aeronautics term for a canard wing being described as a &quot;duck&quot; scheme (—Å—Ö–µ–º–∞ &quot;—É—Ç–∫–∞&quot;), the MiG-8 was an experimental aircraft designed and built by the OKB to evaluate the stability and handling of the canard configuration in conjunction with swept wings. This design has benefits in a jet-powered aircraft as it leaves the rear of the fuselage clear of interference from the jet&#x27;s exhausts. To test the concept the MiG-8 was powered by a Shvetsov M-11 five-cylinder radial engine, with a pusher propeller.

==Operational history==
The aircraft was used as a testbed for developing the swept wing of the MiG-15, and afterwards continued to fly as a communications/utility aircraft for the OKB. Being made of wood and fabric, it was very light and reportedly a favorite among MiG OKB test pilots for its docile, slow-speed handling characteristics.

<doc id="593737" wikidata="Q1505049" url="?curid=593737" title="S/MIME">
<text>S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a standard for public-key encryption and signing of MIME data. S/MIME is on an IETF standards track and defined in a number of documents, most importantly . It was originally developed by RSA Data Security, and the original specification used the IETF MIME specification with the de facto industry standard PKCS¬†#7 secure message format. Change control to S/MIME has since been vested in the IETF, and the specification is now layered on Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), an IETF specification that is identical in most respects with PKCS¬†#7. S/MIME functionality is built into the majority of modern email software and interoperates between them. Since it is built on CMS, MIME can also hold an advanced digital signature.

== Function ==
S/MIME provides the following cryptographic security services for electronic messaging applications:
* Authentication
* Message integrity
* Non-repudiation of origin (using digital signatures)
* Privacy
* Data security (using encryption)
S/MIME specifies the MIME type codice_1 (smime-type &quot;enveloped-data&quot;) for data enveloping (encrypting) where the whole (prepared) MIME entity to be enveloped is encrypted and packed into an object which subsequently is inserted into an application/pkcs7-mime MIME entity.

== S/MIME certificates ==
Before S/MIME can be used in any of the above applications, one must obtain and install an individual key/certificate either from one&#x27;s in-house certificate authority (CA) or from a public CA. The accepted best practice is to use separate private keys (and associated certificates) for signature and for encryption, as this permits escrow of the encryption key without compromise to the non-repudiation property of the signature key. Encryption requires having the destination party&#x27;s certificate on store (which is typically automatic upon receiving a message from the party with a valid signing certificate). While it is technically possible to send a message encrypted (using the destination party certificate) without having one&#x27;s own certificate to digitally sign, in practice, the S/MIME clients will require the user to install their own certificate before they allow encrypting to others. This is necessary so the message can be encrypted for both, recipient and sender, and a copy of the message can be kept (in the sent folder) and be readable for the sender.

A typical &quot;basic&quot; (&quot;class 1&quot;) personal certificate verifies the owner&#x27;s &quot;identity&quot; only insofar as it declares that the sender is the owner of the &quot;From:&quot; email address in the sense that the sender can receive email sent to that address, and so merely proves that an email received really did come from the &quot;From:&quot; address given. It does not verify the person&#x27;s name or business name. If a sender wishes to enable email recipients to verify the sender&#x27;s identity in the sense that a received certificate name carries the sender&#x27;s name or an organization&#x27;s name, the sender needs to obtain a certificate (&quot;class 2&quot;) from a CA, who carries out a more in-depth identity verification process, and this involves making inquiries about the would-be certificate holder. For more detail on authentication, see digital signature.

Depending on the policy of the CA, the certificate and all its contents may be posted publicly for reference and verification. This makes the name and email address available for all to see and possibly search for. Other CAs only post serial numbers and revocation status, which does not include any of the personal information. The latter, at a minimum, is mandatory to uphold the integrity of the public key infrastructure.

== S/MIME Working Group of CA/Browser Forum ==
In 2020, the S/MIME Certificate Working Group of the CA/Browser Forum was chartered to create a baseline requirement applicable to CAs that issue S/MIME certificates used to sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt email. That effort is intended to create standards including:
* Certificate profiles for S/MIME certificates and CAs that issue them
* Verification of control over email addresses
* Identity validation 
* Key management, certificate lifecycle, CA operational practices, etc.

Version 1 of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly‚ÄêTrusted S/MIME Certificates was published on January 1, 2023 by the CA/Browser Forum. It defined four types of S/MIME certificate standards. Mailbox‚Äêvalidated, Organization‚Äêvalidated, Sponsor‚Äêvalidated and Individual‚Äêvalidated.

== Obstacles to deploying S/MIME in practice ==

* S/MIME is sometimes considered not properly suited for use via webmail clients. Though support can be hacked into a browser, some security practices require the private key to be kept accessible to the user but inaccessible from the webmail server, complicating the key advantage of webmail: providing ubiquitous accessibility. This issue is not fully specific to S/MIME: other secure methods of signing webmail may also require a browser to execute code to produce the signature; exceptions are PGP Desktop and versions of GnuPG, which will grab the data out of the webmail, sign it by means of a clipboard, and put the signed data back into the webmail page. Seen from the view of security this is a more secure solution.
* S/MIME is tailored for end-to-end security. Logically it is not possible to have a third party inspecting email for malware and also have secure end-to-end communications. Encryption will not only encrypt the messages, but also the malware. Thus if mail is not scanned for malware anywhere but at the end points, such as a company&#x27;s gateway, encryption will defeat the detector and successfully deliver the malware. The only solution to this is to perform malware scanning on end user stations &quot;after&quot; decryption. Other solutions do not provide end-to-end trust as they require keys to be shared by a third party for the purpose of detecting malware. Examples of this type of compromise are:
** Solutions which store private keys on the gateway server so decryption can occur prior to the gateway malware scan. These unencrypted messages are then delivered to end users.
** Solutions which store private keys on malware scanners so that it can inspect messages content, the encrypted message is then relayed to its destination.
* Due to the requirement of a certificate for implementation, not all users can take advantage of S/MIME, as some may wish to encrypt a message without the involvement or administrative overhead of certificates, for example by encrypting the message with a public/private key pair instead.

Any message that an S/MIME email client stores encrypted cannot be decrypted if the applicable key pair&#x27;s private key is unavailable or otherwise unusable (e.g., the certificate has been deleted or lost or the private key&#x27;s password has been forgotten). However, an expired, revoked, or untrusted certificate will remain usable for cryptographic purposes. Indexing of encrypted messages&#x27; clear text may not be possible with all email clients. Neither of these potential dilemmas is specific to S/MIME but rather cipher text in general and do not apply to S/MIME messages that are only signed and not encrypted.

S/MIME signatures are usually &quot;detached signatures&quot;: the signature information is separate from the text being signed. The MIME type for this is codice_2 with the second part having a MIME subtype of codice_3. Mailing list software is notorious for changing the textual part of a message and thereby invalidating the signature; however, this problem is not specific to S/MIME, and a digital signature only reveals that the signed content has been changed.

== Security issues ==
On May 13, 2018, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) announced critical vulnerabilities in S/MIME, together with an obsolete form of PGP that is still used, in many email clients. Dubbed EFAIL, the bug required significant coordinated effort by many email client vendors to fix. Mitigations for both Efail vulnerabilities have since been addressed in the security considerations section of .

<text>Cockatoo Island Wareamah is a UNESCO World Heritage Site at the confluence of the Parramatta River and Lane Cove River in Sydney Harbour, New South Wales, Australia.

Cockatoo Island is the largest of several harbour islands that were once heavily timbered sandstone knolls. Originally the Island rose to above sea level and was but it has been extended to and is now cleared of most vegetation. Called &quot;Wa-rea-mah&quot; by the Indigenous Australians who traditionally inhabited the land prior to European settlement, the island may have been used as a fishing base, although physical evidence of Aboriginal heritage has not been found on the island.

Between 1839 and 1869, Cockatoo Island operated as a convict penal establishment, primarily as a place of secondary punishment for convicts who had re-offended in the colonies.

Cockatoo Island was also the site of one of Australia&#x27;s biggest shipyards, operating between 1857 and 1991. The first of its two dry docks was built by convicts. Listed on the National Heritage List, the island is significant for its demonstration of the characteristics of a long-running dockyard and shipbuilding complex, including evidence of key functions, structures and operational layout. Cockatoo Island contains the nation&#x27;s most extensive and varied record of shipbuilding, and has the potential to enhance understanding of maritime and heavy industrial processes in Australia from the mid-19th century.

In July 2010, UNESCO proclaimed Cockatoo Island as a World Heritage Site, and has been managed by the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust since 2001.

== Recent use and activities ==
The island is managed by the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust which is also responsible for seven other lands around Sydney Harbour. The Harbour Trust is revitalising the island as a landmark harbour attraction with cultural events and heritage interpretation. Today Cockatoo Island retains some remnants of its past. Its prison buildings have been World Heritage listed, part of a serial listing of 11 Australian Convict Sites.

Although some large workshops, slipways, wharves, residences and other buildings remain, major buildings were demolished after Cockatoo Island closed as a dockyard in 1991. As the remaining buildings contain few of their original industrial artefacts and none of the remaining industrial heritage including the docks, caissons and cranes is operational, it is difficult to currently see how the island functioned as a dockyard for over a century.

In late March 2005 the Harbour Trust, in partnership with an event organiser, held the Cockatoo Island Festival. The event put the island on Sydney&#x27;s cultural map and initiated a range of cultural activities including contemporary art installations, exhibitions and festivals.

The Harbour Trust opened a camp and glampsite on the island in 2008. The camp ground attracts some 20,000 campers a year and is a popular spot for watching Sydney&#x27;s renowned New Year&#x27;s Eve fireworks. In 2010, the island attracted a capacity crowd of over 2000 campers to view NYE fireworks. Other island holiday accommodation consists of five renovated houses and apartments with harbour and city views.

Sydney Ferries services Cockatoo Island as part of its Woolwich/Balmain ferry route and Parramatta RiverCat route. Day visitors are welcome, and can picnic, barbecue, visit the cafe, wander at leisure or take an audio or guided tour. Cockatoo Island is open daily and there is no admission charge.

Regular events and art installations are a feature of the island.

Cockatoo Island has grown into a versatile cultural venue on Sydney&#x27;s cultural calendar. In 2008, it was a major venue partner of the 16th Biennale of Sydney, attracting over 80,000 visitors over 12 weeks. In 2010, the event attracted over 156,000 people. In 2009, Cockatoo Island hosted the Sydney Festival&#x27;s &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; music festival. The two-day festival included twenty-four bands over four stages across the island, and was curated and headlined by Nick Cave, attracting an audience of over 11,000. The island hosted the World&#x27;s Funniest Island Comedy Festival in October 2009, with 200 comedy acts appearing over a weekend, attracting over 8,000 visitors.

The island is also increasingly used as a venue for private events both large and small. Part of films &quot;Unbroken (film)&quot; and the blockbuster &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; were filmed there in 2008. Reality television programs have also used the island as a location.

Cockatoo Island was the site of a temporary public artwork which resembled the shadow of Captain Cook&#x27;s commemorative statue in Sydney. This piece named &#x27;Shadow on the Land, an excavation&#x27; by Nicholas Galanin excavated an outline of the statue on a grass patch, created for the 2020 Biennale of Sydney (22nd edition).

== Early history ==
Before the arrival of Europeans, Cockatoo Island was used by the indigenous Australian people of Sydney&#x27;s coastal region. In 1839 it was chosen as the site of a new penal establishment by the Governor of the colony of New South Wales, Sir George Gipps. Between 1839 and 1869 the island was used as a convict prison. Initially, prisoners were transferred to Cockatoo Island from Norfolk Island, and were employed constructing their barracks and rock-cut silos for storing the colony&#x27;s grain supply. By 1842, approximately of grain were stored on the island.

Later, quarrying on the island provided stone for construction projects around Sydney, including the seawall for Circular Quay. Between 1847 and 1857, convicts were used to dig the Fitzroy Dock, Australia&#x27;s first dry dock, on the island. An estimated of rock was excavated with forming the dock itself.

In 2009, an archeological dig on the island uncovered convict era punishment cells under the cookhouse. These cells give a valuable insight into the conditions convicts lived under on the island.

One prisoner on Cockatoo Island was the Australian bushranger, Captain Thunderbolt, who escaped in 1863 to begin the crime spree which made him famous. It is alleged that his wife swam across to the island with tools to effect his escape, following which they both swam back to the mainland. There is no significant evidence to support this claim.

From 1871 to 1913 facilities on the island often referred to the name Biloela instead of Cockatoo Island to avoid the stigma of the island&#x27;s convict past.

=== Fitzroy Graving Dock ===

The dock was designed by Gother Kerr Mann, the island&#x27;s Civil Engineer, and built between 1847 and 1857 utilising convict labour. The foundation stone of its ashlar lining was laid on 5 June 1854 by Governor Charles Augustus FitzRoy, with the dock being named in his honour. When completed in 1857, the dry dock was in length and in breadth, with an entrance wide. was the first sailing vessel to enter the dock in December 1857. The Fitzroy Dock was lengthened in 1870‚Äì1880 to .

=== Number 1 (Sutherland) Dock ===

The dock was constructed under the supervision of the engineer Louis Samuel between 1882 and 1890. The dock was named after John Sutherland, the Secretary for Public Works and was large enough to accommodate ships of . The dock was modified in 1913 and in 1927 to accommodate Royal Australian Navy ships.

=== Industrial School, Reformatory and Gaol ===
In 1864, the island was split between the NSW Department of Prisons and the Public Works Department, which expanded the dockyard around the foreshores. In 1869, the convicts were relocated to Darlinghurst Gaol and the prison complex became an Industrial School for Girls and also a Reformatory.

== Cockatoo Island Dockyard ==
Shipbuilding began on Cockatoo Island in 1870. In 1913, Cockatoo Island was transferred to the Commonwealth Government to become the Naval Dockyard of the Royal Australian Navy. Over a period of several years prior to World War I, five slipways were either upgraded or constructed in the island, with Numbers 1 and 2 still retained by the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust.

The torpedo boat destroyer was the first naval ship launched at Cockatoo Island, after being built in the United Kingdom, disassembled, then sent to the Australian shipyard for reassembly. During World War I, the dockyard built, repaired and refitted many ships. At its peak during the war, some 4,000 men were employed on the island.

In 1933, Cockatoo Island was leased to the Cockatoo Docks &amp; Engineering Company for 21 years. The lease was renewed in 1954 for a further 20 years and again in 1972 for 21 years.

In 1995, community action played an important role in the preservation of the place. A group &quot;&#x27;&quot;Friends of Cockatoo Island&quot;&quot;&#x27; was founded by Jack Clark and his wife Mary Shelley Clark, to fight for the preservation of the Island and other former Defence sites around Sydney Harbour. Their and other group&#x27;s campaigns resulted in the Federal Government&#x27;s decision to establish the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust which aimed to protect many Harbour sites including the Cockatoo Island.

== Heritage listings ==
In July 2010, at the 34th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, Cockatoo Island and ten other Australian sites with a significant association with convict transportation were inscribed as a group on the World Heritage List as the Australian Convict Sites. The listing explains that the eleven sites present &quot;the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts&quot;. Of the eleven sites, as well as Cockatoo Island, the Hyde Park Barracks, Old Great North Road, and Old Government House at Parramatta are also within the Sydney region.

Parts of Cockatoo Island are the subject of other heritage listings. Listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List are:

*Cockatoo Island Industrial Conservation Area
*Prison Barracks Precinct
**Convict Barracks Block
**Military Guard Room
**Mess Hall
*Underground Grain Silos
*Biloela House precinct
*Fitzroy Dock
*Sutherland Dock
*Power House &amp; Pump House

== Cockatoo Island events ==
Since 2005, Cockatoo Island has hosted a number of major events. They range from collaborations with the Sydney Writers&#x27; Festival to an international freestyle motocross competition. A summary is provided in the following table:

== Planning and projects ==
Stewardship of Cockatoo Island was handed to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust in 2001 to plan a new chapter for the island as publicly owned urban park. In 2003 the Harbour Trust completed a comprehensive plan for Cockatoo Island and other sites around Sydney Harbour managed by the Trust. The initial plan, approved by the Minister in 2003, proposed the revitalisation of Cockatoo Island as a landmark harbour attraction with the revival of maritime activities, the interpretation of its rich colonial and industrial heritage, and the creation of parklands and spaces for cultural events. In 2010, the Harbour Trust produced a revised management plan for the island.

=== Urban Islands ===
In 2009 the Urban Islands masterclass was taught &quot;by 3 groups of international emerging architects on and about the controversial site of Cockatoo Island&quot;:

Cross disciplinary creativity, experimental tactics and broad based participation are needed to inject Cockatoo Island with renewed life. The proposals developed in the 12-days play an active role in generating tangible proposals for Cockatoo Island, producing outcomes such as large-scale installations, futurologist proposals, media activism experiments, and greater harbour master planning visions.

One of the masterclass leaders was Geoff Manaugh, author of the influential BLDGBLOG. A second masterclass was planned for 2011.

== Transport ==
When a working dockyard, Sydney Ferries Limited and its successors operated services from Circular Quay to the island at shift changeover times.

In April 2007, the wharf reopened for a three-month trial coinciding with the reopening of the island as a tourist attraction. Since then services have expanded, and today it is served by Sydney Ferries Parramatta River services operating between Circular Quay and Parramatta. It is also the terminus for all stops Cockatoo Island ferry services from Circular Quay. The single wharf is served by First Fleet and RiverCat class ferries.

<text>In music, a cloud is a sound mass consisting of statistical clouds of hundreds or thousands of microsounds and characterized first by the set of elements used in the texture, secondly density, the number of events within a time period. Clouds may include ambiguity of rhythmic foreground and background or rhythmic hierarchy.

Examples include:
*Iannis Xenakis&#x27;s &quot;Concret PH&quot; (1958), &quot;Bohor I&quot; (1962), &quot;Persepolis&quot; (1971), and many of his pieces for traditional instruments
*Gy√∂rgy Ligeti&#x27;s &quot;Clocks and Clouds&quot; (1972‚Äì3)
*La Monte Young&#x27;s &quot;The Well Tuned Piano&quot;
*Bernard Parmegiani&#x27;s &quot;De natura sonorum&quot; (1975)

Clouds are created and used often in granular synthesis. Musical clouds exist on the &quot;meso&quot; or formal time scale. Clouds allow for the interpenetration of sound masses first described by Edgard Var√®se including smooth mutation (through crossfade), disintegration, and coalescence.

Curtis Roads suggests a taxonomy of cloud morphology based on atmospheric clouds: cumulus, stratocumulus, stratus, nimbostratus, and cirrus; as well as nebulae: dark or glowing, amorphus or ring-shaped, and constantly evolving.

<doc id="593755" wikidata="Q709204" url="?curid=593755" title="Sapporo Agricultural College">
<text>was a school in Sapporo, Hokkaid≈ç established in September 1875 for the purpose of educating students in the agriculture industry.

==History==

The first president of the college was Zusho Hirotake. 

Dr. William Smith Clark, a graduate of Amherst College and the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (MAC) was appointed as the vice president of the college.
 Clark taught in Sapporo only eight months
 but left a deep impact on the students. Specifically, his parting words, &quot;Boys, be ambitious,&quot; have become among the most famous phrases in Japan. He was accompanied by three other MAC alumni, David P. Penhallow, William Penn Brooks and William Wheeler.
 Cecil Peabody was a professor of mathematics (circa 1878 to 1882). 

This college is well known in Japan as a successful Japanese-English immersion school, which produced many good English speakers and writers. The early graduates, especially Classes 1880‚Äì1885, played a directional role in modernizing Japan.

In September 1907, it became the College of Agriculture under Tohoku Imperial University in Sendai.

In April 1918, the Hokkaido Imperial University was established, and Sapporo Agricultural College was transferred to it.

Hokkaido Imperial University was renamed Hokkaido University in December 1947, a name it retains to this day, and Sapporo Agricultural College became its Faculty of Agriculture.

<text>NetLogo is a programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) for agent-based modeling.

==About==
NetLogo was designed by Uri Wilensky, in the spirit of the programming language Logo, to be &quot;low threshold and no ceiling&quot;. It teaches programming concepts using agents in the form of &quot;turtles&quot;, &quot;patches&quot;, &quot;links&quot; and the &quot;observer&quot;. NetLogo was designed with multiple audiences in mind, in particular: teaching children in the education community, and for domain experts without a programming background to model related phenomena.
Thousands of scientific articles have been published using NetLogo.

The NetLogo environment enables exploration of emergent phenomena. It comes with an extensive models library including models in a variety of domains, such as economics, biology, physics, chemistry, psychology, and system dynamics. NetLogo allows exploration by modifying switches, sliders, choosers, inputs, and other interface elements. Beyond exploring, NetLogo allows authoring new models and modifying extant models.

NetLogo is open source and freely available from the NetLogo website. It is in use in a wide variety of educational contexts from elementary school to graduate school. Many teachers make use of NetLogo in their curricula. NetLogo is also widely used in scientific research having been used in several thousand research papers. 

NetLogo was designed and authored by Uri Wilensky, director of Northwestern University&#x27;s Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling (CCL).

== Other features ==

In addition to agent-based modeling, NetLogo also includes basic support for dynamic system modeling.

== Books ==

Several books have been published about NetLogo.

==Technical foundation==
NetLogo is free and open-source software, released under a GNU General Public License (GPL). Commercial licenses are also available. It is written in Scala and Java and runs on the Java virtual machine (JVM). At its core is a hybrid interpreter/compiler that partially compiles user code to JVM bytecode.

NetLogo Web is a version that runs on JavaScript, instead of the JVM, so models may be run in a web browser. However, it does not have all features of the desktop version, and the official website advises that the &quot;desktop version of NetLogo is recommended for most uses&quot;.

==Examples==
A simple multiagent model in NetLogo is the Wolf-Sheep Predation model, which is shown in the screenshot above. It models the population growth of a predator/prey system over time. It has the following characteristics:

* There are two breeds of turtles, called &quot;sheep&quot; and &quot;wolves&quot;.
* Sheep and wolves move randomly and have limited energy.
* Wolves and sheep lose energy by moving. If a wolf or sheep has zero energy, it dies.
* Sheep gain energy by eating grass.
* Wolves gain energy by eating sheep.
* Both wolves and sheep can reproduce, sharing energy with their offspring.

==HubNet==

HubNet is a technology that uses NetLogo to run participatory simulations in the classroom. In a participatory simulation, a whole group of users takes part in enacting the behavior of a system. Using an individual device, such as a networked computer or Texas Instruments graphing calculator, each user acts as a separate, independent agent.
One example of a HubNet activity is &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot;, which models the economic problem called the tragedy of the commons.

<doc id="593758" wikidata="Q67951467" url="?curid=593758" title="Dichromacy">
<text>Dichromacy (from Greek &quot;di&quot;, meaning &quot;two&quot; and &quot;chromo&quot;, meaning &quot;color&quot;) is the state of having two types of functioning photoreceptors, called cone cells, in the eyes. Organisms with dichromacy are called dichromats. Dichromats require only two primary colors to be able to represent their visible gamut. By comparison, trichromats need three primary colors, and tetrachromats need four. Likewise, every color in a dichromat&#x27;s gamut can be evoked with monochromatic light. By comparison, every color in a trichromat&#x27;s gamut can be evoked with a combination of monochromatic light and white light.

Dichromacy in humans is a color vision deficiency in which one of the three cone cells is absent or not functioning and color is thereby reduced to two dimensions.

==Perception==

Dichromatic color vision is enabled by two types of cone cells with different spectral sensitivities and the neural framework to compare the excitation of the different cone cells. The resulting color vision is simpler than typical human trichromatic color vision, and much simpler than tetrachromatic color vision, typical of birds and fish.

A dichromatic color space can be defined by only &quot;two&quot; primary colors. When these primary colors are also the unique hues, then the color space contains the individuals &quot;entire&quot; gamut. In dichromacy, the unique hues can be evoked by exciting only a single cone at a time, e.g. monochromatic light near the extremes of the visible spectrum. A dichromatic color space can also be defined by non-unique hues, but the color space will not contain the individual&#x27;s entire gamut. For comparison, a trichromatic color space requires three primary colors to be defined. However, even when choosing three pure spectral colors as the primaries, the resulting color space will never encompass the entire trichromatic individual&#x27;s gamut.

The color vision of dichromats can be represented in a 2-dimensional plane, where one coordinate represented brightness, and the other coordinate represents hue. However, the perception of hue is not directly analogous to trichromatic hue, but rather a spectrum diverging from white (neutral) in the middle to two unique hues at the extreme, e.g. blue and yellow. Unlike trichromats, white (experienced when both cone cells are equally excited) can be evoked by monochromatic light. This means that dichromats see white in the rainbow.

==Humans==

Dichromacy in humans is a form of color blindness (color vision deficiency). Normal human color vision is trichromatic, so dichromacy is achieved by losing functionality of one of the three cone cells. The classification of human dichromacy depends on which cone is missing:

* Protanopia is a severe form of red-green color blindness, in which the L-cone is absent. It is sex-linked and affects about 1% of males. Colors of confusion include blue/purple and green/yellow.
* Deuteranopia is a severe form of red-green color blindness, in which the M-cone is absent. It is sex-linked and affects about 1% of males. Color vision is very similar to protanopia.
* Tritanopia is a severe form of blue-yellow color blindness, in which the S-cone is absent. It is much rarer than the other types, occurring in about 1 in 100,000, but is not sex-linked, so affects females and males at similar rates. They tend to confuse greens and blues, and yellow can appear pink.

===Diagnosis===

The three determining elements of a dichromatic opponent-color space are the missing color, the null-luminance plane, and the null-chrominance plane. The description of the phenomena itself does not indicate the color that is impaired to the dichromat, however, it does provide enough information to identify the fundamental color space, the colors that are seen by the dichromat. This is based on testing both the null-chrominance plane and null-luminance plane which intersect on the missing color. The cones excited to a corresponding color in the color space are visible to the dichromat and those that are not excited are the missing colors.

===Color detecting abilities of dichromats===

According to color vision researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin (including Jay Neitz), each of the three standard color-detecting cones in the retina of trichromats ‚Äì blue, green and red ‚Äì can pick up about 100 different gradations of color. If each detector is independent of the others, the total number of colors discernible by an average human is their product (100¬†√ó¬†100¬†√ó¬†100), &quot;i.e.&quot; about 1¬†million; Nevertheless, other researchers have put the number at upwards of 2.3¬†million. The same calculation suggests that a dichromat (such as a human with red-green color blindness) would be able to distinguish about 100¬†√ó¬†100¬†=¬†10,000 different colors, but no such calculation has been verified by psychophysical testing.

Furthermore, dichromats have a significantly higher threshold than trichromats for colored stimuli flickering at low (1¬†Hz) frequencies. At higher (10 or 16¬†Hz) frequencies, dichromats perform as well as or better than trichromats. This means such animals would still observe the flicker instead of a temporally fused visual perception as is the case in human movie watching at a high enough frame rate.

==Mammals==
Until the 1960s, popular belief held that most mammals outside of primates were monochromats. In the last half-century, however, a focus on behavioral and genetic testing of mammals has accumulated extensive evidence of dichromatic color vision in a number of mammalian orders. Mammals are now usually &quot;assumed&quot; to be dichromats (possessing S- and L-cones), with monochromats viewed as the exceptions.

The common vertebrate ancestor, extant during the Cambrian, was tetrachromatic, possessing 4 distinct opsins classes. Early mammalian evolution would see the loss of two of these four opsins, due to the nocturnal bottleneck, as dichromacy may improve an animal&#x27;s ability to distinguish colors in dim light. Placental mammals are therefore‚Äìas a rule‚Äìdichromatic.

The exceptions to this rule of dichromatic vision in placental mammals are old world monkeys and apes, which re-evolved trichromacy, and marine mammals (both pinnipeds and cetaceans) which are cone monochromats. New World Monkeys are a partial exception: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the owl monkeys are cone monochromats, and both sexes of howler monkeys are trichromats.

Trichromacy has been retained or re-evolved in marsupials, where trichromatic vision is widespread. Recent genetic and behavioral evidence suggests the South American marsupial &quot;Didelphis albiventris&quot; is dichromatic, with only two classes of cone opsins having been found within the genus &quot;Didelphis&quot;.

<doc id="593761" wikidata="Q813197" url="?curid=593761" title="Simon (game)">
<text>Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley. Much of the assembly language code was written by Charles Kapps, who taught computer science at Temple University and also wrote one of the first books on the theory of computer programming. &quot;Simon&quot; was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.

==History==
Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison were introduced to Atari&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Touch Me&quot; at the Music Operators of America (MOA) trade show in 1976. Baer said of the product, &quot;Nice gameplay. Terrible execution. Visually boring. Miserable, rasping sounds.&quot; The prototype built by Baer used the low-cost Texas Instruments TMS 1000 microcontroller chip, which was in many games of the 1970s. Lenny Cope, who was one of Ralph H. Baer&#x27;s partners, programmed the core of the game, titled &quot;Follow Me&quot; at the time. Baer developed the tones of the game, inspired by the notes of a bugle. When they pitched the demo, an 8-by-8-inch console, to the Milton Bradley Company the name of the game was changed to &quot;Simon&quot;. Simon debuted in 1978 at a retail price of $24.95 () and became one of the top-selling toys that Christmas shopping season. : &quot;Microcomputer controlled game&quot;, was granted in 1980. Milton Bradley soon capitalized on the original with both the smaller-sized &quot;Pocket Simon&quot; and the expanded, eight-button &quot;Super Simon&quot;.
Many variants of &quot;Simon&quot; have been made since Hasbro acquired Milton Bradley in the 1980s, building on the possibilities offered by advances in technology. The original &quot;Super Simon&quot; was reinvented in 2003 as a hexagonal unit with six buttons, which was only released in Europe. 2000 saw &quot;Simon Squared&quot; (or &quot;Simon2&quot;), a unit with the four traditional buttons on one side, and a set of eight smaller buttons on the other. In 2004, Hasbro released the &quot;Simon Stix&quot;. The game features two electronic sticks (modeled after drumsticks), an emphasis on the musical part of the game, and features four levels of play.

In 2005, Hasbro released &quot;Simon Trickster&quot; (also known as &quot;Simon Tricks&quot; in Europe and in the UK, and as &quot;Simon Genius&quot; in Brazil), which features four game modes, in a similar fashion to another Hasbro game, &quot;Bop It&quot;, and colored lenses instead of buttons. &quot;Simon Classic&quot; mode plays up to 35 tones (notes). &quot;Simon Bounce&quot; is similar to &quot;Simon Classic&quot;, but instead the colors of the lenses change. &quot;Simon Surprise&quot; is one of the most difficult games in the unit. Every lens becomes the same color and the player has to memorize the location. &quot;Simon Rewind&quot; requires the player to memorize the sequence backwards. During each game, the player is paid a compliment after a certain number of tones is completed. On reaching five and eleven tones, the computer will randomly choose &quot;Awesome!&quot;, &quot;Nice!&quot;, &quot;Sweet!&quot; or &quot;Respect!&quot;. On reaching 18 tones, the game will play a victory melody three times. On reaching the ultimate 35 tones, the game will play the victory melody again and will say &quot;Respect!&quot;. If the player fails to memorize the pattern or fails to press the right color within the time limit, the game will play a crashing sound and the game will say &quot;Later!&quot;.

In 2011, Hasbro introduced &quot;Simon Flash&quot;. In this version, the game is played with four cube-shaped electronic modules that the player must move around depending on the game mode.

In 2013, Hasbro reinvented Simon once again with &quot;Simon Swipe&quot;. The game was demonstrated at the New York Toy Fair 2014 and released that summer. The game is a circular unit that looks like a steering wheel. It has been extended from four buttons to eight touchscreen buttons, which are flattened out on the unit. The game features four game modes, called &quot;Levels&quot; (the main game), &quot;Classic&quot;, &quot;Party&quot; and &quot;Extreme&quot;. The player has to go through all sixteen levels to beat the game. &quot;Classic&quot;, &quot;Party&quot; and &quot;Extreme&quot; levels focus on one pattern getting longer and longer until the player is out. A smaller version of the game, called &quot;Simon Micro Series&quot;, was introduced in the fall of 2014. This version has only two game modes called &quot;Solo&quot; and &quot;Pass It&quot; and features 14 levels and four buttons. There is also a version of&quot; Simon&quot; created by Basic Fun known as the &quot;Touch Simon&quot;. This version has an LCD screen and plays melodies at specific parts of the game.

In 2016, Hasbro launched the follow-up to &quot;Simon Swipe&quot; with &quot;Simon Air&quot;. The game was announced at a Hasbro press conference before the 2016 New York Toy Fair. This version of &quot;Simon&quot; uses motion sensors, similar to those in Mattel&#x27;s &quot;Loopz&quot; line of games. The game has three game modes: &quot;Solo&quot;, &quot;Classic&quot; and &quot;Multiplayer&quot;. A button-pressing version of Simon was also released in the US, with an aesthetic recalling that of the 1970s and 1980s models.

In 2017, Hasbro released &quot;Simon Optix&quot;, a headset game with motion sensor technology similar to &quot;Simon Air&quot;. Multiple &quot;Optix&quot; units can wirelessly interconnect for multiplayer gameplay; the first &quot;Simon&quot; game to do so.

==Gameplay==
The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases. (This is only one of the games on the device; there are actually other games on the original.)

&quot;Simon&quot; is named after the simple children&#x27;s game of Simon Says, but the gameplay is based on Atari&#x27;s unpopular &quot;Touch Me&quot; arcade game from 1974. Simon differs from &quot;Touch Me&quot; in that the &quot;Touch Me&quot; buttons were all of the same color (black) and the sounds it produced were harsh and grating.

&quot;Simon&quot;&#x27;s tones, on the other hand, were designed to always be harmonic, no matter the sequence, and consisted of an A major triad in second inversion, resembling a trumpet fanfare:
* E (blue, lower right);
* C‚ôØ (yellow, lower left);
* A (red, upper right).
* E (green, upper left, an octave lower than blue);

Some of the original 1978 models used an alternative set of tones, forming the B‚ô≠ minor triad:
* B‚ô≠ (blue, lower right);
* D‚ô≠ (yellow, lower left);
* F (red, upper right).
* B‚ô≠ (green, upper left, an octave higher than blue);

&quot;Simon&quot; was later re-released by Milton Bradley ‚Äì now owned by Hasbro ‚Äì in its original circular form, though with a translucent case rather than plain black. It was also sold as a two-sided &quot;Simon Squared&quot; version, with the reverse side having eight buttons for head-to-head play, and as a keychain (officially licensed by Fun4All) with simplified gameplay (only having Game 1, Difficulty 4 available). Other variations of the original game, no longer produced, include &quot;Pocket Simon&quot; and the eight-button &quot;Super Simon&quot;, both from 1980. Nelsonic released an official wristwatch version of &quot;Simon&quot;.

Later versions of the game included a pocket version of the original game in a smaller, yellow, oval-shaped case. Another iteration, &quot;Simon Trickster&quot;, plays the original game as well as variations in which the colors shift around from button to button (&quot;Simon Bounce&quot;), the buttons have no colors at all (&quot;Simon Surprise&quot;) and the player must repeat the sequence backwards (&quot;Simon Rewind&quot;). A pocket version of &quot;Simon Trickster&quot; was also produced.

In the 2014 version of &quot;Simon&quot; called &quot;Simon Swipe&quot;, the notes are as follows: 
* G (blue, lower right);
* C (yellow, lower left);
* E (red, upper right).
* G (green, upper left, an octave higher than blue)

The swiping sounds are presented with sliding between notes. The bigger the slide, the bigger the swipe will be. The exact notes and sound effects were also used for a smaller version called &quot;Simon Micro Series&quot;. The sounds were then recreated for &quot;Simon Air&quot; and &quot;Simon Optix&quot;.

==Clones==
As a popular game, &quot;Simon&quot; inspired many imitators. Atari released a handheld version of &quot;Touch Me&quot; in 1978, with multicolored buttons and pleasant musical tones. Though named for the older arcade game, the handheld &quot;Touch Me&quot; contained &quot;Simon&quot;&#x27;s three game variations and four difficulty levels, albeit with limits of 8, 16, 32 and 99 instead of 8, 14, 20 and 31. Even its button layout mirrored that of &quot;Simon&quot; (though upside-down), with blue in the upper left, yellow in the upper right, red in the lower left and green in the lower right. Its only unique features were an LED score display, similar to that of its arcade counterpart, and its small size, similar to that of a pocket calculator.

Other clones include:
* &quot;Monkey See, Monkey Do&quot;, which featured a similar casing as that of &quot;Simon&quot;, except that the buttons were oval-shaped.
* Tiger Electronics&#x27; &quot;Copy Cat&quot; in 1979, re-released with a transparent case in 1988 and using buzzers. 
** Repackaged and released by Sears as &quot;Follow Me&quot;.
** Released as &quot;Copy Cat Jr.&quot; in 1981, and as &quot;Pocket Repeat&quot; by Tandy Computers and Radio Shack.
* Castle Toy&#x27;s &quot;Einstein&quot; in 1979.
* &quot;Genius&quot;, launched in the 80s in Brazil, by Brinquedos Estrela.
* &quot;Space Echo&quot; by an unknown company.
* Makezine has a DIY version that requires soldering.
* Another DIY version called &quot;Electronic Memory Game&quot; based on ARM Cortex microcontrollers
* The &quot;Game A&quot; mode of the second game in the Game &amp; Watch handheld series &quot;Flagman&quot; (Silver, 5th Jun 1980). &quot;Game B&quot; is the same, but does not play in a sequence, while the player has a limited time to press the corresponding number lit up.
* &quot;R2-D2 Ditto Droid&quot;, a &quot;Star Wars&quot; version featuring R2-D2 sounds and &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed graphics by Tiger Electronics, 1997.
* VTech&#x27;s &quot;Wizard.&quot;
* A side quest in both the SNES and Game Boy Advance versions of &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot; that involves freeing creatures called &quot;Banana Birds&quot; using buttons on each system&#x27;s controller.
* Soviet Elektronika IE-01 Ivolga, nearly an exact visual replica of &quot;Simon&quot;.
*Oddworld games, in which the playable character must progress by completing certain puzzles with a sequence of sounds.

The same gameplay also appears on multi-game handhelds such as:
*Tiger Electronics&#x27; &quot;Brain Warp&quot; and &quot;Brain Shift&quot; games: instead of tones, the game unit issues a recorded voice that calls out colors and numbers in Game 4 - Memory Match. &quot;Brain Shift&quot; has two memory games, Game 2 (&quot;Memory Shift&quot;) and Game 3 (&quot;Who Shift&#x27;s It?&quot;), that call out colors. 
* Mego Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Fabulous Fred&quot; (Game 3, &quot;The Memory Game&quot;).
* Parker Brothers&#x27; &quot;Merlin&quot; (Game 3, &quot;Echo&quot;).
* Atari also included a nine-button version of &quot;Touch Me&quot; as game variations 1-4 (out of 19) on the 1978 &quot;Brain Games&quot; cartridge for the Atari 2600.
* A fan-made version of &quot;Simon&quot; was unofficially made available for modded Wiis in 2008.
* A Harry Potter wand released in 2001 called &quot;Harry Potter Magic Spell Challenge&quot; had Simon gameplay and voice commands: &quot;Wingardium&quot; (to tilt the wand down) and &quot;Leviosa&quot; (to tilt the wand up.).
* Toytronic&#x27;s GOTCHA!, a similar handheld with 8 buttons instead of 4, produced in a rounded &quot;big&quot; version and a smaller, &quot;pocket&quot; one

==Audio==
Some versions of the game have tones that play as long as the button is depressed, but others have a constant sound duration. Some versions feature audio themes, such as animals (cat/dog/pig/cow), xylophone, football and space sounds, some of which make the game easier to play. Some versions also have a sound on/off setting, which can make the game harder with only visual cues.

==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Simon&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1980&quot;, praising it as &quot;the original electronic &#x27;follow the leader&#x27; game&quot; with &quot;Simon&quot; as &quot;a cheerful fellow&quot; who &quot;talks to you in sequences of musical tones and lights&quot;.

<text>An auto rickshaw is a motorized version of the pulled rickshaw or cycle rickshaw. Most have three wheels and do not tilt. They are known by many other terms in various countries, including 3wheel, Adaidaita Sahu, Keke-napep, Maruwa, auto, baby taxi, bajaj, bao-bao, chand gari, CNG, easy bike, jonnybee, lapa, lapa-lapa, mototaxi, pigeon, pragya, tuk-tuk, tukxi, tum-tum and tempo.

The auto rickshaw is a common form of transport around the world, both as a vehicle for hire and for private use. They are especially common in countries with tropical or subtropical climates since they are usually not fully enclosed, and they are found in many developing countries because they are relatively inexpensive to own and operate. There are many different auto rickshaw designs. The most common type is characterized by a sheet-metal body or open frame resting on three wheels; a canvas roof with drop-down side curtains; a small cabin at the front for the driver operating handlebar controls; and a cargo, passenger, or dual purpose space at the rear. Another type is a motorcycle that has an expanded sidecar or, less often, is pushing or pulling a passenger compartment.

As of 2019, Bajaj Auto of India is the world&#x27;s largest auto rickshaw manufacturer, selling 780,000 during the 2019 fiscal year.

== Origin ==
In the 1930s Japan, which was the most industrialized country in Asia at the time, encouraged the development of motorized vehicles including less expensive three-wheeled vehicles based on motorcycles. The Mazda-Go, a 3-wheel open &quot;truck&quot; released in 1931, is often considered the first of what became auto rickshaws. Later that decade the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of Japan distributed about 20,000 used three-wheelers to Southeast Asia as part of efforts to expand its influence in the region. They became popular in some areas, especially Thailand, which developed local manufacturing and design after the Japanese government abolished the three-wheeler license in Japan in 1965.

Production in Southeast Asia started from the knockdown production of the Daihatsu Midget, which was introduced in 1959. An exception is the indigenously modified Philippine tricycle, which originates from the Rikuo Type 97 motorcycle with a sidecar, introduced to the islands in 1941 by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II.

In Europe, Corradino D&#x27;Ascanio, aircraft designer at Piaggio and inventor of the Vespa, came up with the idea of building a light three-wheeled commercial vehicle to power Italy&#x27;s post-war economic reconstruction. The Piaggio Ape followed suit in 1947.

== Regional variations ==

=== Africa and the Middle East ===

==== Egypt ====
Locally named the &quot;tuktuk&quot;, the rickshaw is used as a means of transportation in most parts of Egypt. It is generally rare to find in some affluent and newer parts of cities such as New Cairo and Heliopolis; and on highways due to police control and enforcement.

==== Gaza ====
Together with the recent boom of recreational facilities in Gaza for the local residents, donkey carts have all but been displaced by tuk-tuks in 2010. Due to the ban by Egypt and Israel on the import of most motorised vehicles, the tuk-tuks have had to be smuggled in parts through the tunnel network connecting Gaza with Egypt.

====Iraq====
Due to extreme congestion in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities combined with the insensible cost of vehicles in relation to frequent violence, rickshaws have been imported from India in large numbers to provide taxi service and other purposes, in stark contrast to previous attitudes of the pre-U.S. 2003 invasion eras with rickshaws being disdained and sedans being held in high regard as a status symbol. Rickshaws have been noted for being instrumental in political protest revolts.

==== Madagascar ====
In Madagascar, man-powered rickshaws are a common form of transportation in a number of cities, especially Antsirabe. They are known as &quot;posy&quot; from &quot;pousse-pousse&quot;, meaning &quot;push-push&quot;. Cycle rickshaws took off since 2006 in a number of flat cities like Toamasina and replaced the major part of the posy, and are now threatened by the auto rickshaws, introduced in 2009. Provincial capitals like Toamasina, Mahajanga, Toliara, and Antsiranana are taking to them rapidly. They are known as &quot;bajaji&quot; in the north and &quot;tuk-tuk&quot; or &quot;tik-tik&quot; in the east, and are now licensed to operate as taxis. They are not yet allowed an operating licence in the congested, and more polluted national capital, Antananarivo.

==== Nigeria ====
The auto rickshaw is used to provide transportation in cities all over Nigeria. Popularity and use varies across the country. In Lagos, for example, the &quot;keke&quot; (Hausa for bicycle) is regulated and transportation around the state&#x27;s highways is prohibited while in Kano it&#x27;s popularly known as &quot;Adaidaita Sahu&quot;. 
==== South Africa ====
Tuk-tuks, introduced in Durban in the late 1980s, have enjoyed growing popularity in recent years, particularly in Gauteng. In Cape Town they are used to deliver groceries and, more recently, transport tourists.

==== Sudan ====
Rickshaws, known as &quot;Raksha&quot; in Sudan, are the most common means of transportation, followed by the bus, in the capital Khartoum.

==== Tanzania ====
Locally known as &quot;bajaji&quot;, they are a common mode of transportation in Dar es Salaam, and many other cities and villages.

====Uganda====
A local delivery company called as Sokowatch in 2020 began a pilot project using electric tuk-tuks, to cut pollution.

==== Zimbabwe ====
Hende Moto EV &amp; Taxi company was founded in 2019 by Devine Mafa, an American-Zimbabwean businessman. Hende Moto taxis were first introduced in Zimbabwe as the first vehicle manufactured by Zimbabwean three-wheeler manufacturing company Hende Moto Pvt Ltd. The first Hende Moto Taxi was introduced in Kwekwe in August 2019, and thereafter in Victoria Falls City and then Harare in 2019. Hende Moto is also the manufacturer of the first Zimbabwean-made electric passenger three-wheeled vehicle. It operates on a lithium-ion battery that has a range of 70 miles on a 6-hour charge.

=== South Asia ===
====Afghanistan====
Auto rickshaws are very common in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, where they are popularly decorated in art and colors. They are also popular in the northern city of Kunduz.

==== Bangladesh ====

Auto rickshaws (locally called &quot;baby taxis&quot; and more recently &quot;CNGs&quot; due to their fuel source, compressed natural gas) are one of the more popular modes of transport in Bangladesh mainly due to their size and speed. They are best suited to narrow, crowded streets, and are thus the principal means of covering longer distances within urban areas.

Two-stroke engines had been identified as one of the leading sources of air pollution in Dhaka. Thus, since January 2003, traditional auto rickshaws were banned from the capital; only the new natural gas-powered models (CNG) were permitted to operate within the city limits. All CNGs are painted green to signify that the vehicles are eco-friendly and that each one has a meter built-in.
==== India ====

Most cities offer auto rickshaw service, Although cycle rickshaws and hand-pulled rickshaws are also available but rarely in certain remote areas, as all other cities began using auto rickshaws.
 Many state governments have launched an initiative of women-friendly rickshaw service called the Pink Rickshaws driven by women. The drivers are known as the Rickshaw-wallah, &quot;auto-wallah&quot;, &quot;tuktuk-wallah&quot; or &quot;auto-kaara&quot; in places like Kerala. Auto-rickshaws are also known as tempos in some parts of India.

Auto rickshaws are used in cities and towns for short distances; they are less suited to long distances because they are slow and the carriages are open to air pollution. Auto rickshaws (often called &quot;autos&quot;) provide cheap and efficient transportation. Modern auto rickshaws run on electricity as government pushes for e-mobility through its FAME-II scheme, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) due to government regulations and are environmentally friendly compared to full-sized cars.

To augment speedy movement of traffic, auto rickshaws are not allowed in the southern part of Mumbai.

India is the location of the annual Rickshaw Run.

There are two types of auto rickshaws in India. In older versions the engines were below the driver&#x27;s seat, while in newer versions engines are in the rear. They normally run on petrol, CNG, or diesel. The seating capacity of a normal rickshaw is four, including the driver&#x27;s seat. Six-seater rickshaws exist in different parts of the country, but the model was officially banned in the city of Pune on 10 January 2003 by the Regional Transport Authority (RTA).

Apart from this, modern electric auto rickshaws, which run on electric motors and have high torque and loading capacity with better speed, are also gaining popularity in India. Many auto drivers moved to electric three-wheelers as the prices of CNG or Diesel is very high and that type of auto rickshaw is much costlier compared to the electric auto rickshaw. The Government is also taking actions to convert current CNG and diesel rickshaws to electric rickshaws.

CNG autos in many cities (e.g. Delhi, Agra) are distinguishable from the earlier petrol-powered autos by a green and yellow livery, as opposed to the earlier black and yellow appearance. In other cities (such as Mumbai) the only distinguishing feature is the &#x27;CNG&#x27; print found on the back or side of the auto. Some local governments are considering four-stroke engines instead of two-stroke versions.

Notable auto rickshaw manufacturers in India include Bajaj Auto, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, Piaggio Ape, Atul Auto, Kerala Automobiles Limited, TVS Motors and Force Motors.

In Delhi there also used to be a variant powered by a Harley-Davidson engine called the &quot;phat-phati&quot;, because of the sound it made. The story goes that shortly after Independence a stock of Harley-Davidson motorbikes were found that had been used by British troops during World War II and left behind in a military storage house in Delhi. Drivers purchased these bikes, added on a gear box (probably from a Willys jeep), welded on a passenger compartment that was good for four to six passengers, and put the unconventional vehicles onto the roads. A 1998 ruling of the Supreme Court against the use of polluting vehicles finally signed the death warrant of Delhi&#x27;s phat-phatis.

 India has about 2.4 million battery-powered, three-wheeled rickshaws on its roads. Some 11,000 new ones hit the streets each month, creating a US$3.1 billion market. Manufacturers include Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd. and Kinetic Engineering. A prerequisite for the adoption to electric vehicles is the availability of charging stations; as of early 2024, India had 12,146 public EV charging stations operational across the country.

Generally rickshaw fares are controlled by the government, however auto (and taxi) driver unions frequently go on strike demanding fare hikes. They have also gone on strike multiple times in Delhi to protest against the government and High Court&#x27;s 2012 order to install GPS systems, and even though GPS installation in public transport was made mandatory in 2015, as of 2017 compliance remains very low.

The 200¬†cc variant of the Bajaj Auto auto rickshaw was used in the 2022 Rickshaw Run to set the record for the world&#x27;s highest auto rickshaw, over the Umling La Pass, at 

==== Nepal ====
Auto rickshaws were a popular mode of transport in Nepal during the 1980s and 1990s, until the government banned the movement of 600 such vehicles in the early 2000s. The earliest auto rickshaws running in Kathmandu were manufactured by Bajaj Auto.

Nepal has been a popular destination for the Rickshaw Run. The 2009 Fall Run took place in Goa, India and ended in Pokhara, Nepal.

==== Pakistan ====
Auto rickshaws are a popular mode of transport in Pakistani towns and are mainly used for travelling short distances within cities. One of the major manufacturers of auto rickshaws is Piaggio. The government is taking measures to convert all gasoline powered auto rickshaws to cleaner CNG rickshaws by 2015 in all the major cities of Pakistan by issuing easy loans through commercial banks. Environment Canada is implementing pilot projects in Lahore, Karachi, and Quetta with engine technology developed in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada that uses CNG instead of gasoline in the two-stroke engines, in an effort to combat environmental pollution and noise levels.

In many cities in Pakistan, there are also motorcycle rickshaws, usually called &quot;chand gari&quot; (moon car) or &quot;chingchi&quot;, after the Chinese company Jinan Qingqi Motorcycle Co. Ltd who first introduced these to the market.

There are many rickshaw manufacturers in Pakistan. Lahore is the hub of CNG auto rickshaw manufacturing. Manufacturers include: New Asia automobile Pvt, Ltd; AECO Export Company; STAHLCO Motors; Global Sources; Parhiyar Automobiles; Global Ledsys Technologies; Siwa Industries; Prime Punjab Automobiles; Murshid Farm Industries; Sazgar Automobiles; NTN Enterprises; and Imperial Engineering Company.
==== Sri Lanka ====
Auto rickshaws, commonly known as three-wheelers, tuk-tuks (), autos, or trishaws can be found on all roads in Sri Lanka transporting people or freight. Sri Lankan three-wheelers are of the style of the light Phnom Penh-type. Most of the three-wheelers in Sri Lanka are a slightly modified Indian Bajaj model, imported from India though there are few manufactured locally and increasingly imports from other countries in the region and other brands of three-wheelers such as Piaggio Ape. Three-wheelers were introduced to Sri Lanka for the first time around 1979 by Richard Pieris &amp; Company. a new gasoline powered tuk-tuk typically costs around , while a newly introduced Chinese electric model cost around . Since 2008, the Sri Lankan government has banned the import of all 2-stroke gasoline engines due to environmental concerns. Ones imported to the island now are four-stroke engines. Most three-wheelers are available as hired vehicles, with few being used to haul goods or as private company or advertising vehicles. Bajaj enjoys a virtual monopoly in the island, with its agent being David Pieries Motor Co, Ltd. A few three-wheelers in Sri Lanka have distance meters. In the capital city it is becoming more and more common. The vast majority of fares are negotiated between the passenger and driver. There are 1.2 million trishaws in Sri Lanka and most are on financial loans.

In Sri Lanka, tourists are able to drive a tuktuk. Through the Automobile Association of Ceylon, tourists are able to get a temporary Recognition Permit which allows them to drive a three-wheeler legally.

=== Southeast Asia ===
==== Cambodia ====
In Cambodia, a passenger-carrying three-wheeled vehicle is known as from the French &quot;remorque&quot;. It is a widely used form of transportation in the capital of Phnom Penh and for visitors touring the Angkor temples in Siem Reap. Some have four wheels and is composed of a motorcycle (which leans) and trailer (which does not). Cambodian cities have a much lower volume of automobile traffic than Thai cities, and tuk-tuks are still the most common form of urban transport. There are more than 6,000 tuk-tuks in Phnom Penh, according to the Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association (IDEA), a union that represents tuk-tuk drivers among other members.

==== Indonesia ====
In Indonesia, auto rickshaws are popular in Jakarta as &quot;Bajay&quot;, Java, Medan and Gorontalo as &quot;Bentor&quot;, and some parts of Sulawesi and other places in the country. In Jakarta, the auto rickshaws are called &quot;Bajay&quot; or &quot;Bajaj&quot; and they are the same to as the ones in India but are colored blue (for the ones which use compressed natural gas) and orange (for normal gasoline fuel). The blue ones are imported from India with the brand of Bajaj and TVS and the orange ones are the old design from 1977. The orange ones uses two-stroke engines as their prime mover, while the blue ones use four stroke engines.
The orange bajaj has been banned since 2017 due to emission regulations. The Bajaj is one of the most popular modes of transportation in the city. Outside of Jakarta, the &quot;bentor&quot;-style auto rickshaw is ubiquitous, with the passenger cabin mounted as a sidecar (like in Medan) or in-front (like the ones in some parts of Sulawesi) to a motorcycle.
==== Philippines ====

In the Philippines, a similar mode of public transport is the &quot;tricycle&quot; (Filipino: &quot;traysikel&quot;; Cebuano: &quot;traysikol&quot;). Unlike auto rickshaws, however, it has a motorcycle with a sidecar configuration and a different origin. The exact date of its appearance in the Philippines is unknown, but it started appearing after World War 2, roughly at the same time as the appearance of the jeepney. It is most likely derived from the Rikuo Type 97 military motorcycle used by the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines starting at 1941. The motorcycle was essentially a licensed copy of a Harley-Davidson with a sidecar. However, there is also another hypothesis which places the origin of the tricycle to the similarly built &quot;trisikad&quot;, a human-powered cycle rickshaw built in the same configuration as the tricycle. However, the provenance of the trisikad is also unknown. Prior to the tricycles and trisikad, the most common means of mass public transport in the Philippines is a carriage pulled by horses or carabaos known as the kalesa (&quot;calesa&quot; or &quot;carromata&quot; in Philippine Spanish). The pulled rickshaw never gained acceptance in the Philippines. Americans tried to introduce it in the early 20th century, but it was strongly opposed by local Filipinos who viewed it as an undignified mode of transport that turned humans into &quot;beasts&quot;.

The design and configuration of tricycles vary widely from place to place, but tends towards rough standardization within each municipality. The usual design is a passenger or cargo sidecar fitted to a motorbike, usually on the right of the motorbike. It is rare to find one with a left sidecar. A larger variant of the tricycle with the motorcycle in the center enclosed by a passenger cab with two side benches is known as a &quot;motorela&quot;. It is found on the islands of Mindanao, Camiguin, and Bohol. Another notable variant is the tricycles of the Batanes Islands which have cabs made from wood and roofed with thatched cogon grass. In Pagadian City, tricycles are also uniquely built with the passenger cab slanting upwards, due to the city&#x27;s streets that run along steep hills.

Tricycles can carry three passengers or more in the sidecar, one or two pillion passengers behind the driver, and even a few on the roof of the sidecar. Tricycles are one of the main contributors to air pollution in the Philippines, which account for 45% of all volatile organic compound emissions since majority of them employ two-stroke engines. However, some local governments are working towards phasing out two-stroke tricycles for ones with cleaner four-stroke engines.

Tuk-Tuks have now been accepted as Three-Wheeled Vehicles by the Land Transportation Office (Philippines) as distinct from tricycles and are now seen in Philippine streets. Electric versions are now seen especially in the city of Manila where they are called e-trikes. Combustion engine tuktuks are locally distributed by TVS Motors and Bajaj Auto through dealerships

==== Thailand ====
The auto rickshaw, called tuk-tuk (, ) in Thailand, is a widely used form of urban transport in Bangkok and other Thai cities. The name is onomatopoeic, mimicking the sound of a small (often two-cycle) engine. It is particularly popular where traffic congestion is a major problem, such as in Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima. In Bangkok in the 1960s, these were called samlaws, and they are still popularly called that today.

Bangkok and other cities in Thailand have many tuk-tuks which are a more open variation on the Indian auto rickshaw. About 20,000 tuk-tuks were registered as taxis in Thailand in 2017. Bangkok alone is reported to have 9,000 tuk-tuks.

Tuk-tuk hua kob (‡∏ï‡∏∏‡πä‡∏Å ‡πÜ ‡∏´‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏Å‡∏ö, , literally: frog-headed tuk tuk) is a unique tuk tuk with a cab looking like a frog&#x27;s head. Only Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya and Trang have vehicles like this.

in 2018, MuvMi, an electric tuk-tuk ride hailing service launched in Bangkok.

===East Asia===
==== China ====
Various types of auto rickshaw are used around China, where they are called sƒÅn l√∫n chƒì (‰∏âËΩÆËΩ¶) and sometimes sƒÅn b√®ng z«ê (‰∏âËπ¶Â≠ê), meaning three wheeler or tricycle. They may be used to transport cargo or passengers in the more rural areas. However, in many urban areas the auto rickshaws for passengers are often operated illegally as they are considered unsafe and an eyesore. They are permitted in some towns and cities, however. The Southeast Asian word tuk tuk is transliterated as d≈´ d≈´ chƒì (ÂòüÂòüËΩ¶, or beep beep car) in Chinese.

=== Europe ===

==== France ====
A number of tuk-tuks (250 in 2013 according to the Paris Prefecture) are used as an alternative tourist transport system in Paris, some of them being pedal-operated with electric motor assist. They are not yet fully licensed to operate and await customers on the streets. V√©lotaxis were common during the Occupation years in Paris due to fuel restrictions.

==== Italy ====
Auto rickshaws have been commonly used in Italy since the late 1940s, providing a low-cost means of transportation in the post‚ÄìWorld War II years when the country was short of economic resources. The Piaggio Ape (Tukxi), designed by Vespa creator Corradino D&#x27;Ascanio and first manufactured in 1948 by the Italian company Piaggio, though primarily designed for carrying freight has also been widely used as an auto rickshaw. It is still extremely popular throughout the country, being particularly useful in the narrow streets found in the center of many little towns in central and southern Italy. Though it no longer has a key role in transportation, Piaggio Ape is still used as a minitaxi in some areas such as the islands of Ischia and Stromboli (on Stromboli no cars are allowed). It has recently been re-launched as a trendy-ecological means of transportation, or, relying on the role the Ape played in the history of Italian design, as a promotional tool.

====Portugal====
Tuk Tuks are used in the main touristic cities and regions of the country, specially in Lisbon and the sunny region of Algarve, as a novel form of transport for visitors during the tourist season.

==== United Kingdom ====
In 2006 a British travel writer Antonia Bolingbroke-Kent and her friend Jo Huxster travelled with an auto rickshaw from Bangkok to Brighton. With this 98 days&#x27;
trip they set a Guinness World Record for the longest journey ever with an auto rickshaw.
In October 2022, Gwent police spent ¬£40,000 on four tuk tuk vehicles in order to help fight crime.

==== Montenegro ====
Tuk Tuk Montenegro has implemented tours with electric tuk-tuks in Kotor, Montenegro in 2018.

=== North America ===
==== El Salvador ====
The &quot;mototaxi&quot; or &quot;moto&quot; is the El Salvadoran version of the auto rickshaw. These are most commonly made from the front end and engine of a motorcycle attached to a two-wheeled passenger area in back. Commercially produced models, such as the Indian Bajaj brand, are also employed.

==== Guatemala ====
In Guatemala tuk-tuks operate, both as taxis and private vehicles, in Guatemala City, around the island town of Flores, Peten, in the mountain city of Antigua Guatemala, and in many small towns in the mountains. From 2005 to present the tuk-tuks have been prevalent in Lago de Atitl√°n towns such as Panajachel and Santiago Atitl√°n. While tuk-tuks continue to serve as a prevalent form of transportation in Antigua and Lake Atitlan their use throughout the country as a whole has declined.

==== United States ====
In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States Post Office (replaced in 1971 by the United States Postal Service) used the WestCoaster Mailster, a close relative of the tuk-tuk. Similar vehicles remain in limited use for parking enforcement, mall security, and other niche applications. After a short time on the market (Mid-2000s to 2008) in the United States, the vehicles failed to gain popularity in the United States, and as a result, are no longer available. The Manufacturer Bajaj cited the manual transmissions aboard the three-wheelers as the reason for poor sales. As a result of modifications that made the machines EPA and DOT compliant, the vehicles that were sold are still street-legal.

Auto rickshaws are rarely seen in the United States, However there are companies that operate them as taxis, affordable transportation services, or rentals, usually in urban areas like Tuk Tuk Chicago in Chicago, Capital Tuk-Tuk in Sacramento, eTuk Ride Denver in Denver, the Boston rickshaw company in Boston and several more.

The New York Police Department (NYPD) operates auto rickshaws that they call ‚Äúthree-wheel patrol scooters‚Äù. The patrol scooters are used for parking and traffic enforcement on city streets and to patrol places that most cars can&#x27;t ‚Äì like the narrow paths in Central Park. The NYPD patrol scooters started being replaced in 2016 with Smart Fortwos. The NYPD believes that the Smart Fourtwos are safer, more comfortable, and more affordable, than the three-wheel patrol scooters due to the Smart Fourtwos coming with features that the patrol scooters lack like air conditioning, and airbags, while also costing about $6,000 less. The Smart Fortwos can also be driven on highways if needed. The Smart Fortwos are also said to be more ‚Äúapproachable‚Äù and ‚Äúfriendlier looking‚Äù which helps with public relations.

==== Cuba ====
In Cuba, the autorickshaws are small and look like a coconut, hence the name Cocotaxi. 

==== Mexico ====
Some auto rickshaws have been and are still used in Mexico, Such as in Rickshaws in Mexico City.

=== South America ===
==== Peru ====
In Peru, a version of this vehicle is called a motocar or mototaxi.

==== Bolivia ====
Auto Rickshaws are seen in Bolivia.

==== Argentina ====
Auto rickshaws are often used as taxi for hires.

==== Brazil ====
Uber allows auto rickshaws to be used by drivers.

==== Colombia ====
Tuk tuks or moto-taxis are used in some towns and cities in Colombia such as Jard√≠n in Antioquia.
=== Australia and Oceania ===

==== Australia ====
Ikea did a trial run using Electric Auto Rickshaws in Sydney, Australia to deliver packages to customers from May to August 2023.

A company called Just Tuk&#x27;n Around using both pedal powered rickshaws and electric auto rickshaws carries tourists around in Airlie Beach.

A company using auto rickshaws called Tuk Tuk NZ used to operate in Wellington.

A company using auto rickshaws called Kiwi Tuk Tuk used to operate in Auckland.

== Fuel efficiency and pollution ==
In July 1998, the Supreme Court of India ordered the government of Delhi to implement CNG or LPG (Autogas) fuel for all autos and for the entire bus fleet in and around the city. Delhi&#x27;s air quality has improved with the switch to CNG. Initially, auto rickshaw drivers in Delhi had to wait in long queues for CNG refueling, but the situation improved following an increase in the number of CNG stations. Gradually, many state governments passed similar laws, thus shifting to CNG or LPG vehicles in most large cities to improve air quality and reduce pollution. Certain local governments are pushing for four-stroke engines instead of two-stroke ones. Typical mileage for an Indian-made auto rickshaw is around of petrol. Pakistan has passed a similar law prohibiting auto rickshaws in certain areas. CNG auto rickshaws have started to appear in huge numbers in many Pakistani cities.

In January 2007 the Sri Lankan government also banned two-stroke trishaws to reduce air pollution. In the Philippines there are projects to convert carbureted two-stroke engines to direct-injected via Envirofit technology. Research has shown LPG or CNG gas direct-injection can be retrofitted to existing engines, in similar fashion to the Envirofit system. In Vigan City majority of tricycles-for-hire as of 2008 are powered by motorcycles with four-stroke engines, as tricycles with two-stroke motorcycles are prevented from receiving operating permits. Direct injection is standard equipment on new machines in India.

In March 2009 an international consortium coordinated by the International Centre for Hydrogen Energy Technologies initiated a two-year public-private partnership of local and international stakeholders aiming at operating a fleet of 15 hydrogen-fueled three-wheeled vehicles in New Delhi&#x27;s Pragati Maidan complex. As of January 2011, the project was nearing completion.

Hydrogen internal combustion (HICV) use in three-wheelers has only recently being started to be looked into, mainly by developing countries, to decrease local pollution at an affordable cost. At some point, Bajaj Auto made a HICV auto rickshaw together with the company &quot;Energy Conversion Devices&quot;. They made a report on it called &quot;Clean Hydrogen Technology for 3-Wheel Transportation in India&quot; and it stated that the performance was comparable with CNG autos. In 2012, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra showcased their first HICV auto rickshaw, called the Mahindra HyAlfa. The development of the hydrogen-powered rickshaw happened with support from the International Centre for Hydrogen Energy Technologies.

== World records ==
On 16 September 2022, at 11:04¬†a.m. (Indian Standard Time), a Canadian team (Greg Harris and Priya Singh) and a Swiss team (Michele Daryanani and Nevena Lazarevic) set the world record for the highest altitude at which an auto rickshaw has ever been driven. The world record was officially recognized and certified by Guinness World Records on October 10, 2024. The two teams set the record by driving to the summit of Umling La Pass at an altitude of .

The two teams were participating in the Rickshaw Run (Himalayan Edition), an event promoted by The Adventurists, where teams drive auto rickshaws from the Thar desert town of Jaisalmer in Rajasthan to the Himalayan town of Leh in Ladakh. Rickshaw Run teams are given the start and finish lines, but are otherwise unsupported and left to their own navigational choices in completing the approximately 2,300¬†km journey.

The road at Umling La Pass was constructed by India&#x27;s Border Roads Organization and completed in 2017. Guinness World Records certified the road as the highest motorable road in the world.

<text>Wast Water or Wastwater () is a lake located in Wasdale, a valley in the western part of the Lake District National Park, England. The lake is almost long and more than wide. It is a glacial lake, formed in a glacially &#x27;over-deepened&#x27; valley. It is the deepest lake in England at . The surface of the lake is about above sea level, while its bottom is over below sea level. It is owned by the National Trust.

==Surroundings==
The head of the Wasdale Valley is surrounded by some of the highest mountains in England, including Scafell Pike, Great Gable and Lingmell. The steep slopes on the southeastern side of the lake, leading up to the summits of Whin Rigg and Illgill Head, are known as the &quot;Wastwater Screes&quot; or on some maps as &quot;The Screes&quot;. These screes formed as a result of ice and weathering erosion on the rocks of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, that form the fells to the east of the lake, towards Eskdale. They are approximately , from top to base, the base being about below the surface of the lake.

A path runs the length of the lake, through the boulders and scree fall at the base of the craggy fell-side. On the northwestern side are the cliffs of Buckbarrow (a part of Seatallan) and the upturned-boat shape of Yewbarrow. Wast Water is the source of the River Irt which flows into the Irish Sea near Ravenglass.

Both the lake and Wasdale Screes are protected as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and under European Union law as Special Areas of Conservation.

==Name origin and pronunciation==
&quot;Wastwater&quot; comes from &quot;Wasdale&quot; plus English &quot;water&quot;. &quot; &#x27;Wasdale lake&#x27; or &#x27;the lake of Vatns√°, lake river&#x27;. The present name rather curiously contains the reflexes of both Old Norse &#x27;vatn&#x27; &#x27;water&#x27;, &#x27;lake&#x27;, and Old English &#x27;w√¶ter&#x27; &#x27;water&#x27;, with the meaning &#x27;lake&#x27; probably influenced by the Old Norse &#x27;vatn&#x27;.

The valley is pronounced as in &quot;was&quot;, not with a hard &quot;a&quot;: the name of the lake similarly but with a soft &quot;s&quot; as in &quot;thou wast&quot;. The lake is named &quot;Wast Water&quot; on Ordnance Survey maps but &quot;Wastwater&quot; is used with roughly equal frequency, including by its owner, the National Trust, along with the Cumbria Tourist Board, and the Lake District National Park Authority.

==Points of interest==

===The Lady in the Lake===
In 1976, &quot;The Wasdale Lady in the Lake&quot;, Margaret Hogg, was murdered by her husband and her body was disposed of in the lake. She was found after eight years, with her body preserved like wax due to the lack of oxygen in the water.

===Underwater gnomes===
In February 2005 it was reported that a &quot;gnome garden&quot; complete with picket fence had been placed in the lake as a point of interest for divers to explore. It was removed from the bottom of Wastwater after three divers died in the late 1990s. It is thought the divers spent too much time too deep searching for the ornaments. Police divers report a rumour that the garden had been replaced at a depth beyond the lowest the police were allowed to dive.

PC Kenny McMahon, a member of the North West Police Underwater Search Unit, said 

===Water extraction===
Water was first pumped from the lake during World War II to supply the Royal Ordnance Factory at Drigg. It is pumped to the nearby Sellafield nuclear facility as an industrial water supply. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is allowed to extract from the lake a maximum of a day to use on that site.

===Favourite view===
On 9 September 2007, Wast Water was announced as the winner of a vote to determine &quot;Britain&#x27;s Favourite View&quot; by viewers of ITV.

<text>The North Shore is a region within Northern Sydney, in New South Wales, Australia, generally referring to suburbs located on the northern side of Sydney Harbour up to Berowra, and suburbs between Middle Harbour and the Lane Cove River. The term &quot;North Shore&quot;, used to describe this region of Sydney is customary, not legal or administrative, and is often subjective.

Due to the area&#x27;s greenery and manicured lawns, it has earned the nickname the &#x27;Leafy North Shore&#x27;.

== History ==
The region now referred to as the North Shore was home to a number a clans of the Eora. These included the Cammeraygal people whose traditional lands were located within what are now the Lower North Shore local government areas of North Sydney, Willoughby, Mosman, Manly and Warringah local government areas. The Cammeraygal people lived in the area until the 1820s and are recorded as being in the northern parts of the Sydney region for approximately 5,800 years. The Lower North Shore suburb of Cammeray takes its name from the clan, although the Cameragal clan was centred around, Kayyeemy, or Manly Cove.

Other clans included:
*Boregegal at Bradleys Head
*Cannalgal at Manly Beach
*Birrabirrigal at The Spit
*Gorualgal at Georges Head in Mosman

After the British establishment of Sydney in 1788, settlement on the North Shore of the harbour was quite limited. One of the first settlers was James Milson who lived in the vicinity of Jeffrey Street in Kirribilli, directly opposite Sydney Cove. The north shore was more rugged than the southern shore and western areas of the harbour and had limited agricultural potential. The early activities in the area included tree felling, boatbuilding and some orchard farming in the limited areas of good soil. The North Shore railway line was built in the 1890s. Access to the Sydney CBD, located on the southern shore of the harbour remained difficult until the completion of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932. This led to the commencement of the development of suburbs on the North Shore.

Four of the five local government areas that form the Lower North Shore (the City of Willoughby and the municipalities of Mosman, Lane Cove and North Sydney) were created from the Parish of Willoughby, a cadastral unit used for land titles that was created in the early years of European settlement. &quot;North Sydney&quot; was formerly known as St. Leonards.

== Geography ==

The &quot;North Shore&quot; is a term used to describe a region of Northern Sydney. It is a customary term, not administrative or legal, and its boundaries are not definitive. Generally, the &quot;North Shore&quot; includes the peninsula north of Sydney Harbour and is bounded in the west by the Lane Cove River/National Park, in the north west by the M1 motorway to Newcastle, in the southeast by Middle Harbour, and in the northeast by Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. East and north of this boundary are the Northern Beaches region and to the west is the general Northern Sydney region.

Local government areas within the North Shore include City of Willoughby, Municipality of Lane Cove, North Sydney Council, Municipality of Mosman, Ku-ring-gai Council, Municipality of Hunter&#x27;s Hill, and some suburbs of City of Ryde and Hornsby Shire.

In this conception, the North Shore roughly corresponds with the cadastral parishes (used for land title purposes) of the Willoughby (in the south) and Gordon (in the north).

However, these boundaries are not fixed, and those suburbs that sit close to the boundary between, for example, the cadastral Parish of Gordon and the neighbouring Parish of Manly Cove in the east, may be identified in different contexts as part of either the Upper North Shore region or the Northern Beaches region. The entirety of the Lane Cove National Park and its adjoining suburbs to the north are generally regarded as part of the North Shore region, such as the suburbs of Thornleigh, Pennant Hills and Beecroft. Likewise, while the Municipality of Hunters Hill is west of the Lane Cove River and in the Parish of Hunters Hill, the suburbs in that parish along the northern shore of the Parramatta River are sometimes referred (especially in commercial contexts) as part of the Lower North Shore.

Most of the North Shore suburbs are part of the Hornsby Plateau, a large sandstone plateau overlaid by a system of ridges and gullies. The Plateau begins north of the Port Jackson and runs up until the Hawkesbury River. Thus much of the North Shore is hilly with many steep valleys running down into the harbour and the rivers on either side.

Parks and areas of sclerophyll forest are present throughout the area. The Lane Cove National Park, Garigal National Park and Sydney Harbour National Park contain remnant bushland along the Lane Cove River, Middle Harbour and Sydney Harbour respectively. Bushwalking, abseiling and bouldering opportunities can be found around Lindfield and North Turramurra. Gordon has one of Sydney&#x27;s largest bat colonies in a bat reserve leading to Middle Harbour.

=== Upper North Shore ===

The &quot;Upper North Shore&quot; usually refers to all suburbs within the local government area of Ku-ring-gai, and a small area of Hornsby Shire, situated between Lane Cove National Park and Ku-ring-gai National Park, or suburbs between Boundary Street, Roseville and the M1 Motorway in Wahroonga. It is located to the north-west of the Sydney CBD. It roughly corresponds with the cadastral Parish of Gordon. Sometimes, all suburbs adjoining the upper section of Lane Cove National Park are considered part of the Upper North Shore.

According to Australian Bureau of Statistics data collected from the Australian census of 2016, the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council, which makes up almost the entirety of the Upper North Shore region, is the wealthiest local government area in Australia.

In 2015, the NSW government proposed merging Ku-ring-gai Council and Hornsby Council. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the Hornsby and Ku-ring-gai local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers on the North Shore following backlash from members of the community and court proceedings.

=== Lower North Shore ===
The &quot;Lower North Shore&quot; usually refers to the land that is located to the north of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, between Lane Cove River and Middle Harbour and as far north as Boundary Street, Roseville, or all suburbs within the local government areas of Mosman Council, City of Willoughby, Municipality of Lane Cove, North Sydney Council, Municipality of Hunter&#x27;s Hill and some suburbs of City of Ryde. The Lower North Shore roughly corresponds with the Parish of Willoughby, a cadastral unit used for land title purposes.

In 2016, the NSW government proposed merging three of the four lower north shore councils (Mosman, Willoughby, and North Sydney councils). In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the North Sydney, Willoughby and Mosman local government areas. The other lower north shore council, Lane Cove, was similarly proposed to be merged with nearby Hunters Hill and Ryde councils, but that plan was also eventually abandoned.

The Lower North Shore suburbs adjacent to Sydney Harbour include Mosman, Cremorne Point, Neutral Bay, Kirribilli, Milsons Point, Lavender Bay, McMahons Point, Waverton, Wollstonecraft, Woolwich and Greenwich.

Port Jackson, including the Parramatta River, Lane Cove River, Sydney Harbour, and Middle Harbour, defines the region&#x27;s southernmost extent.

== Transport ==

The main road routes on the North Shore are Military Road, the Pacific Highway, the Warringah Expressway as well as parts of the Pennant Hills Road, Ryde Road, Epping Road and Mona Vale Road. Smaller but major arterial roads on the Upper North Shore include the Eastern Arterial Road/Archbold Road at St Ives, East Killara and East Lindfield, the Comenarra Parkway at Thornleigh, Wahroonga, Turramurra, South Turramurra and West Pymble, as well as Lady Game Drive at West Pymble, Gordon, Killara, Lindfield and West Chastwood, providing access to major commercial hubs such as Chatswood.

Much of the North Shore is accessible to railway transport with the North Shore railway line providing rail services between the Sydney central business district, North Sydney and Hornsby via Chatswood. The Sydney Metro Northwest serves the suburbs of Chatswood, North Ryde, Macquarie Park, Macquarie University and Epping before continuing to in the Hills District, replacing the previous Epping to Chatswood railway line after almost 10 years of service. The remaining Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest stage to the Lower North Shore and , is projected to be completed in 2024. The completed metro line will provide rapid transit between North West Sydney and South West Sydney via the Lower North Shore.

Many bus routes also serve the area, particularly the lower North Shore, and ferries connect many of the harbourside suburbs with Circular Quay in the central business district. CDC NSW provide frequent bus services to the Upper North Shore. Buses on the Lower North Shore are mainly operated by the Busways out of Willoughby Bus Depot.

== Commercial areas ==
Significant commercial and retail centres on the North Shore include North Sydney, Crows Nest, Chatswood, St Leonards, Neutral Bay, St Ives and Hornsby.

The North Shore&#x27;s largest commercial centres are at North Sydney and Chatswood. A number of international companies have their Australian or Asia‚ÄìPacific Headquarters in this part of Sydney. North Sydney does not have any of Sydney&#x27;s major shopping centres, however, it has a number of speciality stores and caf√©s. Chatswood is one of the largest retail precincts in Sydney, and has a large amount of high density residential buildings. It is home to large shopping centres such as Westfield Chatswood and Chatswood Chase. Adjacent to Lane Cove National Park, Macquarie Park is home to one of Sydney&#x27;s largest shopping centres, Macquarie Centre. Macquarie Park also has a substantial amount of high density residential buildings and office space. St Leonards is another large commercial area featuring mostly office space and apartments.

== Attractions ==
The Lower North Shore has many unique landmarks such as: The Sydney Harbour Bridge, Taronga Zoo in Mosman, Admiralty House (Sydney residence of the Governor-General of Australia), Kirribilli House (Sydney residence of the Prime Minister of Australia), Luna Park, and Balmoral Beach. At a Sydney or local level, however, landmarks are more plentiful and include: The Lane Cove Azalea Beds, Blues Point Tower, Eden Gardens, the Balmoral Rotunda, the Stanton Library in North Sydney, Lane Cove Plaza, Zenith Towers at Chatswood, Northpoint Tower in North Sydney, Cammeray suspension bridge at Cammeray, Echo Point Park in Roseville Chase, the Royal North Shore Hospital, the Hornsby Water Clock, and &#x27;The Forum&#x27; in St Leonards.

The region is home to hundreds of parks and reserves, including Sydney Harbour National Park and the Lane Cove National Park. Major local sports grounds include North Sydney Oval, the region&#x27;s largest in capacity, and Chatswood Oval.

== Events and celebrations ==

The North Shore holds a number of festivals/events throughout the year, including: Tartan Day at Lane Cove, the Guringgai Festival honouring northern Sydney&#x27;s Aboriginal people, the Moocooboola Festival at Hunters Hill, the Mosman Festival, Lane Cove&#x27;s Cammeraygal Festival, and Chinese New Year at Chatswood. Mosman, North Sydney, Willoughby also hold an annual art prize. All local government areas in the region and around the country celebrate Australia Day, which is on 26 January.

The Willoughby Spring Festival is held throughout the Willoughby local government area, in September each year. The festival lasts for a month and features over 40 events including live music/entertainment, exhibitions, cultural celebrations, business events and many more community activities. The highlight is the annual Willoughby Street Fair where the Chatswood CBD is taken over by market stalls, performers, dancers and musicians. The StreetFair features the Willoughby Street Parade which included over 1,000 participants in 2007.

== Media ==
The local newspapers are the &quot;Sydney Observer&quot;, &quot;Hornsby and Upper North Shore Advocate&quot;, &quot;The North Shore Times&quot;, &quot;The Mosman Daily&quot;, &quot;Northern District Times&quot; and the North Shores&#x27; local lifestyle publication &quot;Northside&quot;.

==Sport==
The North Shore is represented by Rugby League club, the North Sydney Bears, some residents (Particularly younger generations) in this area also subscribe their loyalty to the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles (Based on the nearby Northern Beaches area), as North Sydney were excluded from the NRL after the 1999 season, but formed a joint venture with Manly to create the Northern Eagles, however, this only lasted 2 seasons and the licence was reverted to Manly Warringah, effectively leaving the North Shore without NRL representation. However, there have been on going efforts to return the Bears to the top flight, either as the Central Coast Bears, in Perth, or as simply ‚ÄúBears‚Äù. In Rugby union, the area is represented in the Shute Shield by the Northern Suburbs Rugby Club, and the Gordon Rugby Football Club

== Politics ==
Throughout history and on all three levels of politics (federal, state and local), the North Shore has been a stronghold for the Liberal Party, the main centre-right, liberal conservative party in Australia. However, in recent years, teal independents (centrist or centre-left independents who are economically liberal, but environmentally and socially progressive, most of whom are women, whose campaigns are mostly funded by Climate 200, an organisation founded and headed by businessman Simon Holmes √† Court that advocates for climate action) have won gained support in the area. However, on the state level, the Liberal Party has managed to hold off challenges from teal candidates. Similar trends are present in Sydney&#x27;s Eastern Suburbs and on the Northern Beaches, as well as in some parts of Melbourne.

== Climate ==
Like the rest of the Sydney basin, the North Shore has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen &quot;Cfa&quot;). Turramurra receives one of the highest rainfalls in the Sydney area, with an average of per year. The inland parts of the North Shore are somewhat cooler than other areas of the surrounding Sydney basin in the winter months, particularly the CBD, and the further inland the area (particularly the Upper North Shore), the cooler the weather.

<doc id="593773" wikidata="Q1367055" url="?curid=593773" title="Unimodular matrix">
<text>In mathematics, a unimodular matrix &quot;M&quot; is a square integer matrix having determinant +1 or ‚àí1. Equivalently, it is an integer matrix that is invertible over the integers: there is an integer matrix &quot;N&quot; that is its inverse (these are equivalent under Cramer&#x27;s rule). Thus every equation , where &quot;M&quot; and &quot;b&quot; both have integer components and &quot;M&quot; is unimodular, has an integer solution. The &quot;n&quot;‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ&quot;n&quot; unimodular matrices form a group called the &quot;n&quot;‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ&quot;n&quot; general linear group over formula_1, which is denoted formula_2.

==Examples of unimodular matrices==
Unimodular matrices form a subgroup of the general linear group under matrix multiplication, i.e. the following matrices are unimodular:
* Identity matrix
* The inverse of a unimodular matrix
* The product of two unimodular matrices

Other examples include:
* Pascal matrices
* Permutation matrices
* the three transformation matrices in the ternary tree of primitive Pythagorean triples
* Certain transformation matrices for rotation, shearing (both with determinant 1) and reflection (determinant ‚àí1).
* The unimodular matrix used (possibly implicitly) in lattice reduction and in the Hermite normal form of matrices.
* The Kronecker product of two unimodular matrices is also unimodular. This follows since formula_3 where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are the dimensions of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, respectively.

==Total unimodularity==
A totally unimodular matrix
(TU matrix) is a matrix for which every square submatrix has determinant 0, +1 or ‚àí1. A totally unimodular matrix need not be square itself. From the definition it follows that any submatrix of a totally unimodular matrix is itself totally unimodular (TU). Furthermore it follows that any TU matrix has only 0, +1 or ‚àí1 entries. The converse is not true, i.e., a matrix with only 0, +1 or ‚àí1 entries is not necessarily unimodular. A matrix is TU if and only if its transpose is TU.

Totally unimodular matrices are extremely important in polyhedral combinatorics and combinatorial optimization since they give a quick way to verify that a linear program is integral (has an integral optimum, when any optimum exists). Specifically, if &quot;A&quot; is TU and &quot;b&quot; is integral, then linear programs of forms like formula_4 or formula_5 have integral optima, for any &quot;c&quot;. Hence if &quot;A&quot; is totally unimodular and &quot;b&quot; is integral, every extreme point of the feasible region (e.g. formula_6) is integral and thus the feasible region is an integral polyhedron.

===Common totally unimodular matrices===
1. The unoriented incidence matrix of a bipartite graph, which is the coefficient matrix for bipartite matching, is totally unimodular (TU). (The unoriented incidence matrix of a non-bipartite graph is not TU.) More generally, in the appendix to a paper by Heller and Tompkins, A.J. Hoffman and D. Gale prove the following. Let formula_7 be an &quot;m&quot; by &quot;n&quot; matrix whose rows can be partitioned into two disjoint sets formula_8 and formula_9. Then the following four conditions together are sufficient for &quot;A&quot; to be totally unimodular:
* Every entry in formula_7 is 0, +1, or ‚àí1;
* Every column of formula_7 contains at most two non-zero (i.e., +1 or ‚àí1) entries;
* If two non-zero entries in a column of formula_7 have the same sign, then the row of one is in formula_8, and the other in formula_9;
* If two non-zero entries in a column of formula_7 have opposite signs, then the rows of both are in formula_8, or both in formula_9.
It was realized later that these conditions define an incidence matrix of a balanced signed graph; thus, this example says that the incidence matrix of a signed graph is totally unimodular if the signed graph is balanced. The converse is valid for signed graphs without half edges (this generalizes the property of the unoriented incidence matrix of a graph).

2. The constraints of maximum flow and minimum cost flow problems yield a coefficient matrix with these properties (and with empty &quot;C&quot;). Thus, such network flow problems with bounded integer capacities have an integral optimal value. Note that this does not apply to multi-commodity flow problems, in which it is possible to have fractional optimal value even with bounded integer capacities.

3. The consecutive-ones property: if &quot;A&quot; is (or can be permuted into) a 0-1 matrix in which for every row, the 1s appear consecutively, then &quot;A&quot; is TU. (The same holds for columns since the transpose of a TU matrix is also TU.)
4. Every network matrix is TU. The rows of a network matrix correspond to a tree , each of whose arcs has an arbitrary orientation (it is not necessary that there exist a root vertex &quot;r&quot; such that the tree is &quot;rooted into &quot;r&quot;&quot; or &quot;out of &quot;r&quot;&quot;).The columns correspond to another set &quot;C&quot; of arcs on the same vertex set &quot;V&quot;. To compute the entry at row &quot;R&quot; and column , look at the &quot;s&quot;-to-&quot;t&quot; path &quot;P&quot; in &quot;T&quot;; then the entry is:
* +1 if arc &quot;R&quot; appears forward in &quot;P&quot;,
* ‚àí1 if arc &quot;R&quot; appears backwards in &quot;P&quot;,
* 0 if arc &quot;R&quot; does not appear in &quot;P&quot;.
See more in Schrijver (2003).

5. Ghouila-Houri showed that a matrix is TU iff for every subset &quot;R&quot; of rows, there is an assignment formula_18 of signs to rows so that the signed sum formula_19 (which is a row vector of the same width as the matrix) has all its entries in formula_20 (i.e. the row-submatrix has discrepancy at most one). This and several other if-and-only-if characterizations are proven in Schrijver (1998).

6.
Hoffman and Kruskal
proved the following theorem. Suppose formula_21 is a directed graph without 2-dicycles, formula_22 is the set of all dipaths in formula_21, and formula_7 is the 0-1 incidence matrix of formula_25 versus formula_22. Then formula_7 is totally unimodular if and only if every simple arbitrarily-oriented cycle in formula_21 consists of alternating forwards and backwards arcs.

7. Suppose a matrix has 0-(formula_291) entries and in each column, the entries are non-decreasing from top to bottom (so all ‚àí1s are on top, then 0s, then 1s are on the bottom). Fujishige showed
that the matrix is TU iff every 2-by-2 submatrix has determinant in formula_30.

8. Seymour (1980) proved a full characterization of all TU matrices, which we describe here only informally. Seymour&#x27;s theorem is that a matrix is TU if and only if it is a certain natural combination of some network matrices and some copies of a particular 5-by-5 TU matrix.

===Concrete examples===
1. The following matrix is totally unimodular:

:formula_31

This matrix arises as the coefficient matrix of the constraints in the linear programming formulation of the maximum flow problem on the following network:

2. Any matrix of the form
:formula_32
is &quot;not&quot; totally unimodular, since it has a square submatrix of determinant¬†‚àí2.

==Abstract linear algebra==
Abstract linear algebra considers matrices with entries from any commutative ring formula_33, not limited to the integers. In this context, a unimodular matrix is one that is invertible over the ring; equivalently, whose determinant is a unit. This group is denoted formula_34. A rectangular formula_35-by-formula_36 matrix is said to be unimodular if it can be extended with formula_37 rows in formula_38 to a unimodular square matrix.

Over a field, &quot;unimodular&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;non-singular&quot;. &quot;Unimodular&quot; here refers to matrices with coefficients in some ring (often the integers) which are invertible over that ring, and one uses &quot;non-singular&quot; to mean matrices that are invertible over the field.

<doc id="593774" wikidata="Q1540426" url="?curid=593774" title="Pacific Highway (Australia)">
<text>Pacific Highway is a national highway and major transport route of along the east coast of Australia from Sydney to Brisbane. It is an integral part of Highway 1 which circumnavigates the Australian continent. At its inception, the highway was a single carriageway between Sydney and Brisbane. In Australian culture and as a tourist drive, it remains so. Over time, segments of the highway have been relegated from the route and, or, renamed and between 1996 and 2020, the highway was upgraded to the standards of a controlled-access highway (motorway). 

== Location ==
Pacific Highway can be broken into the following sections:
* Brisbane to New South Wales / Queensland border: completely replaced by Pacific Motorway
* New South Wales / Queensland border to Brunswick Heads: upgraded to motorway standard as part of the 1996 Upgrade Masterplan and renamed Pacific Motorway in 2013
* Brunswick Heads to Hexham: conversion to dual carriageway or freeway standards completed in 2020, as part of the 1996 Upgrade Masterplan.
* Hexham to Wahroonga: replaced by Pacific Motorway (also known as Sydney‚ÄìNewcastle Freeway and formerly the F3 Freeway) as the national route between Wahroonga and Beresfield in sections between 1965 and 1993.
* Wahroonga to Sydney CBD: divided metropolitan road, formerly a Metroad route; the route via M2 (Lane Cove Tunnel and M2 Hills Motorway) and NorthConnex as a motorway alternative.

=== Gazette definition ===
Since the most recent declaration of the highway in the April 2010 gazette, the New South Wales section of the highway is officially made up of four separate sections: Warringah Freeway, North Sydney to Gosford Interchange near Kariong; Henry Parry Drive, Wyoming to Pacific Motorway at Ourimbah Interchange; Wyong Road, Tuggerah to Hunter Street, Wickham; and Maitland Road, Warrabrook to the state border with Queensland. Since February 2013, the freeway section of the highway north of Brunswick Heads is also concurrently gazetted and is named and signposted Pacific Motorway. South of here, the section between Brunswick Heads and Bruxner Highway near Ballina is also signposted Pacific Motorway, however, it is not declared as so in the gazette as of February 2019, therefore it remains as only Pacific Highway in the gazette. Confusingly, former sections of the highway removed from the gazette, such as between Gosford and Tuggerah, are still signposted as Pacific Highway.

Major cities and towns along Pacific Highway include: Gosford, Wyong, Newcastle, Taree, Port Macquarie, Kempsey, Coffs Harbour, Grafton, Ballina and Byron Bay, all in New South Wales; and Gold Coast in Queensland.

Major river crossings include the Hawkesbury, Hunter, Myall (just to the east of Bulahdelah), Manning (south of Coopernook), Hastings (west of Port Macquarie), Macleay (just to the east of Frederickton), Nambucca (near Macksville), Bellinger (near Raleigh), Clarence (via the Harwood Bridge near Maclean), Richmond (at Ballina), Brunswick, and Tweed rivers.

===Sydney to Kariong===
From Sydney, Pacific Highway starts as the continuation of Bradfield Highway at the northern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, immediately north of the Sydney central business district, and is the main route as far as the suburb of Wahroonga. From the Harbour Bridge to Gore Hill Freeway at Artarmon, no route number has been assigned. From Gore Hill Freeway to Wahroonga, the Pacific Highway is designated route A1. When the Warringah Freeway was built in the late 1960s, southbound traffic was diverted through North Sydney via Mount Street. In October 1985 it was again diverted via Berry Street.

From Wahroonga, Pacific Highway is mostly parallel to the freeway until Kariong (at which point it diverts into the Central Coast through Gosford and Wyong). The section of the highway from Cowan to Kariong follows a scenic winding route with varying speed limits of either .

===Kariong to Hexham===
The section of what was formerly Pacific Highway from Wiseman&#x27;s Ferry Road junction at Kariong, through to Pacific Highway exit at Gosford (adjacent to Brian McGowan Bridge), has been redeclared as Central Coast Highway with route number A49. The highway then continues north without a route number through the Central Coast suburbs of Ourimbah and Wyong as a regional route, before meeting with a spur of Pacific Motorway near Doyalson numbered as route A43. At this point Pacific Highway is signed route A43 for most of its length, and is a four-six lane regional highway passing Lake Macquarie and on through the suburbs of the cities of Lake Macquarie and Newcastle before rejoining route A1 at Hexham.

From Bennetts Green to Sandgate it is supplemented by the Newcastle Inner City Bypass, through New Lambton and Jesmond. Two sections of the bypass, Bennetts Green-Rankin Park and Jesmond-Sandgate, are of motorway standard.

===North of Hexham===

From Hexham, Pacific Highway passes up the NSW north coast to Brunswick Heads where it becomes Pacific Motorway through to Brisbane.

===Former sections ===
Former sections of Pacific Highway were created when the sections were removed from the gazette definition, or were bypassed by new sections of Pacific Highway. However, as mentioned, some former sections of Pacific Highway that were removed from gazette definition continue to be referred and signposted as Pacific Highway.

====Removed from gazette definition====
Between Sydney and Hexham or Newcastle, some sections of the highway were re-gazetted as other roads and/or not gazetted as part of Pacific Highway anymore. However, many of these are still referred to and signposted as Pacific Highway.

The first two sections of the highway to be removed from the gazette was the Calga to Kariong section and a section in Gosford between Racecourse Road/Etna Street and Brian McGowan Bridge in November 1996. The remaining section within Gosford, between Kariong and Brian McGowan Bridge, was re-gazetted and renamed Central Coast Highway in August 2006. These changes resulted in the previously undivided section between Ourimbah and Sydney to be split into two: Kariong to Sydney, and Ourimbah to Wyoming.

The April 2010 gazette removed the sections between Racecourse Road/Etta Street and Henry Parry Drive/Pemmel Street in Gosford, between Ourimbah and Tuggerah, and between Hunter Street and Industrial Drive in Newcastle from the existing declaration of the highway, but redeclared the section between Calga and Kariong. , this is the most recent gazette to redefine the declaration of Pacific Highway. Even though these three removed sections are not gazetted as part of Pacific Highway anymore, street signage continues to show &quot;Pacific Highway&quot; and maps often show both the current road name and &quot;Pacific Highway&quot; together.

In Queensland, Pacific Highway used to go into Brisbane, however, most sections have been renamed to other roads or highways. For example, the section of Pacific Highway between Coolangatta and Currumbin is now part of Gold Coast Highway.

====Bypassed====
Sections of the highway between Hexham and the Queensland/NSW border that were bypassed and replaced by new sections of Pacific Highway, were renamed and downgraded to local roads, and are no longer part of Pacific Highway. As the new sections are just bypasses, this meant that the section between Hexham and Queensland border is still a continuous route. Prominent bypassed sections of the highway between Hexham and the border include:
*the former section Twelve Mile Creek and Taree through Stroud and Gloucester, with the new route over mostly dirt roads gazetted in 1952. The affected roads were upgraded over a number of years, including the construction of major bridges to replace the low-level crossing at Nabiac and the ferry at Karuah. The upgrading of the northern section was completed first and through traffic ran temporarily over the road between Bulahdelah and Booral. The southern part from Bulahdelah to Twelve Mile Creek via Karuah was completed about 1960. The old section was later renamed Bucketts Way.
*the former section through Kempsey and Frederickton which included the site of the Kempsey bus crash. This section was replaced by a new freeway bypass and bridge over the Macleay River in 2013 and 2016, and was renamed the Macleay Valley Way.
*the former between Eungai Creek and Raleigh via Macksville and Nambucca Way. This section was bypassed in 2016 and 2018 and was renamed Giinagay Way
*the former section between Glenugie and Maclean via Grafton which included the site of the Grafton bus crash. This section was replaced by a new alignment of the highway in 2020 and was renamed Big River Way.

In May 2009, the portion of the Tugun Bypass (newly opened in June 2008) within New South Wales boundaries was declared as the new alignment of Pacific Highway between Tweed Heads interchange and the Queensland border. The older bypassed alignment along Tweed Heads Bypass (opened 1992) towards the border at Coolangatta was gazetted as Gold Coast Highway instead, extending the already existing Gold Coast Highway in Queensland, into New South Wales. The Tugun Bypass was handed over to the NSW government in June 2018. The section of the bypassed highway within Queensland borders between Stewart Road and Gold Coast Highway was officially renamed Tugun-Currumbin Road, but is signposted as Stewart Road.

==History==

Initially, the primary mode of transport connecting the coastal areas between Sydney and Brisbane was by boat. However, a continuous inland route from Newcastle to Brisbane via the Northern Tablelands had been in existence since the 1840s. A direct coastal route between Sydney and Newcastle was not completed until 1930, and completion of the sealing of the Pacific Highway did not occur until 1958 (at Koorainghat, south of Taree). The last of the many ferries across the coastal rivers was not superseded by a bridge until 1966 (the Harwood Bridge across the south channel of the Clarence River, the north channel having been bridged in 1931).

Between 1925 and 1930 the Main Roads Board of New South Wales reconstructed and sealed a route between Hornsby and Calga that had been abandoned some forty years earlier, to provide a direct road link between Sydney and Newcastle. In addition, a replacement route from Calga into the gorge of Mooney Mooney Creek and up to the ridge at Kariong above Gosford was also required. This new Sydney‚ÄìNewcastle route via Calga and Gosford was some shorter than the previous route via Parramatta, McGraths Hill, Maroota, Wisemans Ferry, Wollombi and Cessnock. At first, the old Peats Ferry was reinstated to cross the Hawkesbury River, with construction of the bridge not beginning until 1938, due to the Great Depression. Due to the onset of the Second World War, the Peats Ferry Bridge was not completed until May 1945.
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later the Department of Main Roads, and eventually Transport for NSW). Great Northern Highway was declared (as Main Road No. 9), running from North Sydney via Hornsby, Peat&#x27;s Ferry, Gosford, Swansea and Newcastle to Hexham (still under construction), and North Coast Highway was declared (as Main Road No. 10), running from Hexham, Stroud, Gloucester, Taree, Port Macquarie, Kempsey, Coffs Harbour, South Grafton, Ballina, Byron Bay, Mullumbimby, and Murwillumbah to Tweed Heads, on the same day, 8 August 1928. With the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, these were amended to State Highways 9 and 10 on 8 April 1929.

In Queensland, there existed a series of local roads, which could be used by early motor vehicle owners to drive from Brisbane to the state border at Tweed Heads, but these roads were not designed for cars, and hence the journey was more like an adventure, only undertaken by the experienced motorist. The railway line to Southport and Tweed Heads was the preferred mode of transport. It wasn‚Äôt until 1920 when Queensland‚Äôs Main Roads Board was formed that the idea of linking these roads together to form one continuous route was proposed. Construction of the new road began shortly afterwards, and involved connecting the old local roads together and upgrading some of the existing roads. It was declared as the Pacific Highway in December 1930, although the final part of the highway (the Logan River bridge) wasn‚Äôt opened until July of the next year. In New South Wales, a section of State Highway 9 (Great Northern Highway) from Hexham to Sydney, was re-declared as part of as State Highway 10; its entire length (including North Coast Highway from Hexham to the state border with Queensland, and the newly added section of Great Northern Highway) was renamed Pacific Highway to match Queensland&#x27;s declaration on 26 May 1931; The Great Northern Highway was truncated to meet the Pacific Highway at Hexham (and was later renamed to New England Highway in 1933).

Until the 1990s most road freight between Sydney and Brisbane passed along the New England Highway instead, due to the easier topography of the Northern Tablelands it traverses. Between 1950 and 1967, traffic on Pacific Highway quadrupled due to the attraction of coastal towns between Sydney and Brisbane for retirement living and tourism.

===1989 Grafton and Kempsey bus crashes===
Two major coach accidents on Pacific Highway in 1989 near Grafton (in which 21 people died) and at Clybucca near Kempsey (in which 35 people died) resulted in a public outcry over the poor quality of the road and its high fatality rate. Pacific Highway was never part of the federally funded system of National Highways. This appears to be because when the federal government funding of the &#x27;national highway&#x27; system began in 1974, the longer New England Highway was chosen rather than Pacific Highway as the Sydney‚ÄìBrisbane link, due to its easier topography and consequent lower upgrade costs.

===1990s===
In 1994, the Roads and Traffic Authority considered the environmental impact statement of a proposal for a toll road between Coolongolook and Possum Brush. The proposal was from Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Ltd and Travers Morgan Pty Ltd.

Until December 1997, a short section of the highway between Ourimbah and Kangy Angy was used by Sydney‚ÄìNewcastle Freeway traffic as there was no freeway alternative. This section of Pacific Highway was designated as part of National Route 1 and subsequently National Highway 1. It was also upgraded to dual carriageway in the early 1970s. Due to the shared freeway and highway traffic, the at-grade interchanges between the freeway and the highway at Ourimbah and Kangy Angy became bottlenecks during peak times. In December 1997, the Ourimbah Creek Road to Kangy Angy stage of the freeway, located 150¬†m west of the highway, opened to traffic. The new freeway section was one of the last sections of the freeway to be completed and was referred to as the &quot;missing link&quot; of the freeway. Pacific Highway was bypassed and reduced to one lane per direction, and the northbound carriageway and bridge over Ourimbah Creek north of Palmdale Road were removed. The at-grade interchange between the freeway and the highway at Kangy Angy was also removed.

The section of the highway from Cowan to Kariong follows a scenic winding route with varying speed limits, typically . This section was damaged quite severely during severe weather in June 2007. Five people died when a bridge over Piles Creek collapsed and the entire section was closed due to subsidence further south. The road was reopened in 2009 when the Holt-Bragg Bridge was opened, named after the family that had perished.

The New South Wales section of Pacific Highway from Brunswick Heads to the state border with Queensland was re-declared as part of Pacific Motorway in February 2013.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this Act, Pacific Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 10, across all four of its gazetted sections, from the state border with Queensland (via Pacific Motorway) to North Sydney.

===2000s and beyond===
Pacific Highway was signed National Route 1 across its entire length in 1955. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, this was replaced with route M1 for sections classified as a motorway, and route A1 for sections classified as a highway (except between Hexham and Wahroonga, where it is designated route A43 through most of the Central Coast between Hexham and Doyalson, and route B83 between Kariong and Wahroonga).

===1996 upgrade masterplan===
====Four lane dual carriageway standard====

The highway was heavily used by interstate traffic and its upgrade was beyond the resources of the New South Wales government alone. The NSW and federal governments argued for years about how the responsibility for funding the highway&#x27;s upgrade should be divided between themselves, only coming up with a mutually acceptable upgrade package just after the 1996/97 financial year.

As part of a joint New South Wales and federal funding arrangement and upgrade masterplan, single carriageway sections from Tweed Heads to Hexham were progressively converted to freeway or dual carriageway standards commencing in 1996. At the time, the plan targeted to have Pacific Highway upgraded to dual carriageway by 2016. The strategy divided the remaining sections into three levels of priority:
* Priority 1: Tweed Heads to Ballina, Port Macquarie to Hexham, Woolgoolga to Raleigh
* Priority 2: Raleigh to Port Macquarie
* Priority 3: Ballina to Woolgoolga

In the meantime, numerous sections of existing single carriageway road were upgraded by re-alignments and safety improvement work including the addition of overtaking lanes, pavement widening and median barriers. Overall the highway became safer and travelling times were substantially reduced, particularly during holiday periods..

The four-lane dual carriageway upgrade of the highway was completed in December 2020. Continuous dual carriageway, much of it freeway standard, now extends from in Newcastle to the Queensland border. As of completion, about 15¬†billion have been invested in the upgrade by the federal and state governments, and fatalities have dropped by more than 75% since the upgrade started in 1996.

====Coffs Harbour Bypass====
The Coffs Harbour Bypass is a realignment of Pacific Highway that will bypass the city of Coffs Harbour, including up to 12 sets of traffic lights. It is being built as a four-lane motorway with three tunnels. It is the last section of the Pacific Highway Upgrade, and is being funded by the state and federal governments. The project was granted planning approval by the state government in November 2020 and the federal government in December 2020. Tenders for its construction were let in June 2022, with major construction commencing in early 2023. It is expected to be open to traffic in late 2026.

====Motorway standard upgrade====
The highway was upgraded to dual carriageway that is either an arterial standard (Class A) or a motorway standard (Class M). The Class M sections between Woolgoolga and Ballina are:
*Thrumster to Eungai Rail
*Congarinni to Boambee
*Woolgoolga to Halfway Creek
*Glenugie to Harwood
*Woodburn to Pimlico

Following the dual carriageway upgrade, the only remaining project of the Pacific Highway Upgrade is the Coffs Harbour Bypass. Additionally, the M1 to Raymond Terrace project, which is classified as a separate project, will be a motorway extending and connecting the Pacific Motorway (Sydney to Newcastle section) to the upgraded Pacific Highway at Raymond Terrace. Construction formally commenced in January 2024 and is expected to be completed by 2028.

==== Projects ====
==== Funding issues ====
In 2007 mounting pressure was placed on the federal government to provide additional funding for the highway. On 10 October 2007 the Federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services pledged $2.4¬†billion in funding for the highway, subject to dollar for dollar funding by the NSW state government. However, the NSW state government refused to match funding. In the lead up to the 2007 federal election, then opposition leader Kevin Rudd pledged $1.5¬†billion in funding. As part of Auslink 2 (Nation Building Program), the federal government announced in its 2009 federal budget that $3.1¬†billion would be spent on the highway up until 2014 at which time just 63% of the highway would be duplicated. The NSW government will spend just $500¬†million over that same period, with $300¬†million cut as a result of the 2008 mini budget.

From time to time, there are proposals in the media for the private sector to build a fully controlled-access high-speed tollway between Newcastle and the Queensland border, possibly using the BOT system of infrastructure provision. Nothing eventuated from these proposals.

===Other upgrades===
Other sections of Pacific Highway (between Hexham and Sydney) have been upgraded or proposed to be upgraded:
* The section of Pacific Highway between Ourimbah Street and Parsons Road at is being duplicated , including a rail bridge over the Sydney to Newcastle rail line.
* Since December 2020, the section (Maitland Road) between Newcastle Inner City Bypass and New England Highway is being proposed to be widened from four lanes to six lanes.

==Former route numbers==
Pacific Highway was signed National Route 1 along its entire length in 1955. Over time, as road projects reallocated the route, or bypassed it entirely, these remaining sections were replaced with others. Former road routes of Pacific Highway have included:
* National Route 1 (1955‚Äì2013): ‚Äì
* National Route 1 (1955‚Äì1988) / State Route 111 (1988‚Äì2013): ‚Äì
* National Route 1 (1955‚Äì1979) / State Route 83 (1979‚Äì2013): ‚Äì
* National Route 1 (1955‚Äì1993) / Metroad 1 (1993‚Äì2013): ‚Äì
* National Route 1 (1955‚Äì1992) / State Route 14 (1992‚Äì1998) / Metroad 10 (1998‚Äì2007): ‚Äì
* National Route 1 (1955‚Äì1992): ‚Äì

== Safety ==

The Pacific Highway was one of the most dangerous and deadly stretches of road in Australia, partly due to its high traffic levels. Between 1995 and 2009, over 400 people died on the highway. In 1989, two separate bus crashes, the Grafton bus crash (in which 21 people died) and the Kempsey bus crash (in which 35 died) on the highway were two of the worst road accidents in Australia&#x27;s history. In 2010, 38 people died on Pacific Highway, and in 2011, 25 people. Over the past 15 years, the New South Wales Roads &amp; Traffic Authority reports that about 1,200 people have been injured each year.

In January 2012, a ute swerved into the path of a B-double truck, which then veered off-road and crashed into two houses at Urunga. 11-year-old boy Max McGregor, who was sleeping in one of the houses, and the ute driver died from the incident. Another seven people were taken to Coffs Harbour Hospital. It was found that the ute driver had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.245, five times over the limit, equal to more than 25 standard drinks. The section of the highway through Urunga was bypassed in 2016.

Much of the danger of Pacific Highway lay in the fact that it contained long stretches of undivided road along which all types of vehicles, including private automobiles, buses, vans and trucks, simultaneously travelled at speeds approaching and in excess of . The undivided sections carried a high risk of head-on collisions. This was relieved to an extent by the provision of regular passing lanes, but these did not fully cope with the high level of traffic during holiday periods. After the 1989 crashes, the investigating coroner, Kevin Waller, recommended that the highway be fully divided along its entire length. Motorists surveyed by the National Roads and Motorists&#x27; Association (NRMA) voted Pacific Highway the worst road in New South Wales in 2012.

==Major intersections==

The major intersections of Pacific Highway, spread over on the eastern seaboard of New South Wales comprise a mix of freeway grade-separated conditions, suburban and urban roads.

: Ewingsdale Road (B62)
: Bruxner Highway (B60)
: Big River Way (B76) ‚Äì towards Gwydir Highway
: Big River Way (B91) ‚Äì towards Summerland Way

<text>Taree () is a city on the Mid North Coast, New South Wales, Australia. It and nearby Cundletown were settled in 1831 by William Wynter. Since then it has grown to a population of 26,381, and commands a significant agricultural district. Situated on a floodplain by the Manning River, it is 16¬†km from the Tasman Sea coast, and 317¬†km north of Sydney.

Taree is within the local government area of Mid-Coast Council, the state electorate of Myall Lakes and the federal electorate of Lyne.
Established in 1854 as a private town, it was proclaimed a municipality in 1885 and a city in 1981.

==Name==
The name Taree is derived from &quot;tareebit&quot;, a Biripi word meaning &quot;tree by the river&quot;, or more specifically, the Sandpaper Fig (&quot;Ficus coronata&quot;).

==History==
The Biripi were the indigenous people of what is now known as Taree. The Aboriginal population of the Manning River was relatively dense before colonisation by Europeans.

In 1826, Assistant Surveyor Henry Dangar was instructed by John Oxley as Surveyor General (and a shareholder in the Australian Agricultural Company) to survey the land between Port Stephens and the Hastings River. During this expedition, Dangar identified that Harrington Lake was a river with two entrances to the sea. Later in 1826, the river was named the Manning River by Robert Dawson for the Deputy Governor of the Australian Agricultural Company, William Manning.

In 1829, Governor Darling proclaimed the division of the settlement of the colony of New South Wales into Nineteen Counties. The northern limit of the settlement was declared to be the Manning River.

Taree was laid out as a private town in 1854 by Henry Flett, the son-in-law of William Wynter who had originally settled the area in 1831. had been set aside for the private township and 40 lots were initially sold. Taree was declared a municipality on 26 March 1885 and the first municipal council was elected by the residents. In the early 1800s the road from Newcastle to Port Macquarie came via Gloucester and forded the river near Wingham. Boats could not go further upstream than this due to narrowing of the river and rapids. Hence a town formed at Wingham, about a day&#x27;s ride from Gloucester. Timber getting, especially cedar, ensured goods were brought to Wingham and then shipped to Newcastle and beyond by boat. Coopernook similarly formed a local shipping hub. In 1844, the government of New South Wales had established Wingham as its administrative centre. When the North Coast railway line came through in 1913, it initially terminated at Taree. Even before the rest of the line was completed it became apparent that it was safer to send goods by rail to Newcastle and Sydney rather than hazarding the bar at the outlet to the river at Harrington where many ships had been lost. Although connected to the railway, sea transport continued to dominate along the North Coast until the 1930s. This changed when the Martin Bridge replaced the ferry across the Manning River in 1940. River traffic significantly reduced after this, ensuring Taree&#x27;s place as the centre of business.

The oldest surviving building in Taree is the old St Paul&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, built-in 1869 in the Victorian Gothic Revival style, next door to the current building, in Albert Street.

A record breaking rain event in March 2021 lead to flooding in the town, sweeping debris such as a water tank and shipping container into the Manning River which struck the Martin Bridge. The river peaked at 5.7 metres, inundating properties in Taree South and Glenthorne and falling just short of the historical high of 6 metres in 1929.

In the 24 hours to 9¬†am on 7 July 2022, a record 305¬†mm of rain was recorded in town. Since records began in 1881, this was the wettest day in the history of Taree.

<text>Holland Park is an area of Kensington, on the western edge of Central London, that lies within the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and largely surrounds its namesake park, Holland Park. 

Colloquially referred to as &#x27;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&#x27;, Holland Park is among the most expensive residential areas in London and the United Kingdom. Past and present residents include David and Victoria Beckham, Sir Elton John, David Cameron, Ed Sheeran, Sir Richard Branson, and Robbie Williams, among others. The small neighborhood is further home to the embassies of several countries, including Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Greece, Jordan, Russia and Lebanon.

The area is principally composed of tree-lined streets with large Victorian mansions and contains shops, cultural tourist attractions such as the Design Museum, luxury spas, hotels, and restaurants along Holland Park Avenue and Kensington High Street.

== Location and boundaries ==
Holland Park is located between Notting Hill and South Kensington, west of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. While there are no official boundaries, the Holland Ward was historically bounded by Kensington High Street to the south, Holland Road to the west, Holland Park Avenue to the north, and Kensington Palace Gardens to the east.

Adjacent districts are Notting Hill to the north, Earl&#x27;s Court to the south, and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to the west.

==History==

The district was rural until the 19th century, and most of the area now referred to by the name Holland Park was formerly the grounds of a Jacobean mansion called Cope Castle. In the later decades of that century the owners of the house sold off the more outlying parts of its grounds for residential development, and the district which evolved took its name from the house. Large parts of Holland Park were constructed between 1860 and 1880 by master builders William and Francis Radford, who were contracted to build over 200 houses in the area. Notable 19th-century residential developments in the area include the Royal Crescent and Aubrey House. It also included some small areas around the fringes which had never been part of the grounds of Holland House, notably the Phillimore Estate (there are at least four roads with the word Phillimore in their name) and the Campden Hill Square area.

In the late 19th century, a number of notable artists and art collectors (including Frederic Leighton, P.R.A. and Val Prinsep), known as the Holland Park Circle, lived in the area, especially in Melbury Road and Holland Park Road.

===Lansdowne House===
Lansdowne House, at Lansdowne Road. is a Grade II listed eight-storey building which was originally constructed in 1902‚Äì04 by Scottish architect William Flockhart, for South African mining magnate Sir Edmund Davis. The building contained apartments and artists&#x27; workshops. Among the artists who had studios in the building in the early decades of the 20th century were Charles Ricketts, Charles Haslewood Shannon, Glyn Philpot, Vivian Forbes, James Pryde, and Frederick Cayley Robinson, who are commemorated on a blue plaque on the building.

The building underwent significant alterations. When, in 1957, record producer Denis Preston was looking for a property in which to set up a recording studio, his assistant engineer Joe Meek found the premises, which had unusually high ceilings and a basement squash court, suitable for conversion into a studio. Preston, Meek and (a year later) engineer Adrian Kerridge then established the studio, and made their first recordings there in 1958. The studio was London&#x27;s first independent music recording studio. In 1962, an enlarged control room overlooking the studio floor was opened. Kerridge later became the studio&#x27;s owner. The studios closed in 2006 and the building was subsequently converted into 13 self-contained apartments, while retaining a small recording studio.

==The public park==
The park covers about , with a northern half of semi-wild woodland, central section of formal garden areas, and southernmost section used for sport.

Holland House is now a fragmentary ruin, having been devastated by incendiary bombing during the Second World War in 1940, but the ruins and the grounds were bought by London County Council in 1952 from the last private owner, the 6th Earl of Ilchester. Today the remains of the house form a backdrop for the open air Holland Park Theatre, which is the home of Opera Holland Park. To the immediate south of the park is the former site of the Commonwealth Institute, now home to the Design Museum.

The park contains a caf√©, as well as the Belvedere Restaurant that is attached to the orangery, a giant chess set, a cricket pitch, tennis courts, two Japanese gardens - the Kyoto Garden (1991) and Fukushima Memorial Garden (2012), a youth hostel, a children&#x27;s playground, squirrels and peacocks. In 2010, the park set aside a section for pigs whose job was to reclaim the area from nettles etc., in order to create another meadow area for wildflowers and fauna. Cattle were used subsequently to similar effect.

The Holland Park Ecology Centre (2013), operated by the borough&#x27;s Ecology Service, provides environmental education programmes including nature walks, talks, programmes for schools, and outdoor activity programs for children.

In the northwest of the park near Abbotsbury Road, installed in 2000, is the outdoor sculpture &quot;Tortoises with Triangle and Time&quot; by Wendy Taylor, commissioned by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea for the Millennium.

<doc id="593784" wikidata="Q450059" url="?curid=593784" title="Monochromacy">
<text>Monochromacy (from Greek &quot;mono&quot;, meaning &quot;one&quot; and &quot;chromo&quot;, meaning &quot;color&quot;) is the ability of organisms to perceive only light intensity without respect to spectral composition. Organisms with monochromacy lack color vision and can only see in shades of grey ranging from black to white. Organisms with monochromacy are called monochromats. Many mammals, such as cetaceans, the owl monkey and the Australian sea lion are monochromats. In humans, monochromacy is one among several other symptoms of severe inherited or acquired diseases, including achromatopsia or blue cone monochromacy, together affecting about 1 in 30,000 people.

==Humans==
Human vision relies on a duplex retina, comprising two types of photoreceptor cells. Rods are primarily responsible for dim-light scotopic vision and cones are primarily responsible for day-light photopic vision. For all known vertebrates, scotopic vision is monochromatic, since there is typically only one class of rod cell. However, the presence of multiple cone classes contributing to photopic vision enables color vision during daytime conditions.

Most humans have three classes of cones, each with a different class of opsin. These three opsins have different spectral sensitivities, which is a prerequisite for trichromacy. An alteration of any of these three cone opsins can lead to colorblindness.

# Anomalous trichromacy, when all three cones are functional, but one or more is altered in its spectral sensitivity.
# Dichromacy, when one of the cones is non-functional and one of the red-green or blue-yellow opponent channels are fully disabled.
# Cone monochromacy, when two of the cones are non-functional and both chromatic opponent channels are disabled. Vision is reduced to blacks, whites, and greys.
# Rod monochromacy (Achromatopsia), when all three of the cones are non-functional and therefore photopic vision (and therefore color vision) is disabled.

Monochromacy of photopic vision is a symptom of both Cone Monochromacy and Rod Monochromacy, so these two conditions are typically referred to collectively as monochromacy.

=== Rod monochromacy ===

Rod monochromacy (RM), also called congenital complete achromatopsia or total color blindness, is a rare and extremely severe form of an autosomal recessively inherited retinal disorder resulting in severe visual handicap. People with RM have a reduced visual acuity, (usually about 0.1 or 20/200), have total color blindness, photo-aversion and nystagmus. The nystagmus and photo-aversion usually are present during the first months of life, and the prevalence of the disease is estimated to be 1 in 30,000 worldwide. Since patients with RM have no cone function, they lack photopic vision, relying entirely on their rods and scotopic vision, which is necessarily monochromatic. They therefore cannot see any color but only shades of grey.

=== Cone monochromacy ===

Cone monochromacy (CM) is a condition defined by the exhibition of only one class of cones. A cone monochromat can have good pattern vision at normal daylight levels, but will not be able to distinguish hues.

As humans typically exhibit three classes of cones, cone monochromats can hypothetically derive their photopic vision from any one of them, leading to three categories of cone monochromats:

#Blue cone monochromacy (BCM), also known as S-cone monochromacy, is an X-linked cone disease. It is a rare congenital stationary cone dysfunction syndrome, affecting less than 1 in 100,000 individuals, and is characterized by the absence of L- and M-cone function. BCM results from mutations in a single red or red‚Äìgreen hybrid opsin gene, mutations in both the red and the green opsin genes or deletions within the adjacent LCR (locus control region) on the X chromosome.
#Green cone monochromacy (GCM), also known as M-cone monochromacy, is a condition where the blue and red cones are absent in the fovea. The prevalence of this type of monochromacy is estimated to be less than 1 in 1 million.
#Red cone monochromacy (RCM), also known as L-cone monochromacy, is a condition where the blue and green cones are absent in the fovea. Like GCM, the prevalence of RCM is also estimated at less than 1 in 1 million.

Cone Monochromats with normal rod function can sometimes exhibit mild color vision due to conditional dichromacy. In mesopic conditions, both rods and cones are active and opponent interactions between the cones and rods can afford slight color vision.

According to Jay Neitz, a color vision researcher at the University of Washington, each of the three standard color-detecting cones in the retina of trichromats can detect approximately 100 gradations of color. The brain can process the combinations of these three values so that the average human can distinguish about one million colors. Therefore, a monochromat would be able to distinguish about 100 colors.

==Mammals==
Until the 1960s, popular belief held that most mammals outside of primates were monochromats. In the last half-century, however, a focus on behavioral and genetic testing of mammals has accumulated extensive evidence of at least dichromatic color vision in a number of mammalian orders. Mammals are now usually assumed to be dichromats (possessing S- and L-cones), with monochromats viewed as the exceptions.

Two mammalian orders containing marine mammals exhibit monochromatic vision:
*Pinnipeds (including seals, sea lions and walruses)
*Cetaceans (including dolphins and whales)

Unlike the trichromacy exhibited in most primates, Owl monkeys (genus &quot;Aotus&quot;) are also monochromats. Several members of the family Procyonidae (raccoon, crab-eating raccoon and kinkajou) and a few rodents have been demonstrated as cone monochromats, having lost functionality of the S-cone (retaining the L-cone).

The light available in an animal&#x27;s habitat is a significant determiner of a mammal&#x27;s color vision. Marine, nocturnal or burrowing mammals, which experience less light, have less evolutionary pressure to preserve dichromacy, so often evolve monochromacy.

A recent study using through PCR analysis of genes OPN1SW, OPN1LW, and PDE6C determined that all mammals in the cohort Xenarthra (representing sloths, anteaters and armadillos) developed rod monochromacy through a stem ancestor.

<doc id="593786" wikidata="Q642215" url="?curid=593786" title="Simple Authentication and Security Layer">
<text>Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework for authentication and data security in Internet protocols. It decouples authentication mechanisms from application protocols, in theory allowing any authentication mechanism supported by SASL to be used in any application protocol that uses SASL. Authentication mechanisms can also support &quot;proxy authorization&quot;, a facility allowing one user to assume the identity of another. They can also provide a &quot;data security layer&quot; offering &quot;data integrity&quot; and &quot;data confidentiality&quot; services. DIGEST-MD5 provides an example of mechanisms which can provide a data-security layer. Application protocols that support SASL typically also support Transport Layer Security (TLS) to complement the services offered by SASL.

John Gardiner Myers wrote the original SASL specification (RFC 2222) in 1997. In 2006, that document was replaced by RFC 4422 authored by Alexey Melnikov and Kurt D. Zeilenga. SASL, as defined by RFC 4422 is an IETF &quot;Standard Track&quot; protocol and is, , a &quot;Proposed Standard&quot;.

==SASL mechanisms==
A SASL mechanism implements a series of challenges and responses. Defined SASL mechanisms include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
==SASL-aware application protocols==
Application protocols define their representation of SASL exchanges with a &quot;profile&quot;. A protocol has a &quot;service name&quot; such as &quot;ldap&quot; in a registry shared with GSSAPI and Kerberos.

 protocols currently supporting SASL include:
* Application Configuration Access Protocol
* Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
* Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol
* Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
* Internet Message Support Protocol
* Internet Relay Chat (IRC) (with IRCX or the IRCv3 SASL extension)
* Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
* libvirt
* ManageSieve (RFC 5804)
* memcached
* Post Office Protocol (POP)
* Remote framebuffer protocol used by VNC
* Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
* Subversion protocol
* Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)

<doc id="593791" wikidata="Q3348059" url="?curid=593791" title="Oberon, New South Wales">
<text>Oberon is a town located within the Oberon Council local government area, in the Central Tablelands region of New South Wales, Australia. The main industries are farming, forestry and wood products. The town usually receives snowfall during the winter months, owing to its high elevation. At the 2021 census, Oberon had a population of 3,319 people.

It is the birthplace of Greens politician Bob Brown and journalist Ken Sutcliffe, and former Penrith Panthers player Ray Blacklock. Oberon is located near Jenolan Caves and the Kanangra-Boyd National Park.

==History==
The town was permanently settled in 1839, originally named Bullock Flat, until it was renamed to Oberon in 1863.
Gold was discovered on the Fish River in 1823, leading to a population boost in the area.
The Oberon Council was formed in 1906.
The Fish River Creek Post Office opened on 1 January 1855 and was renamed Oberon in 1866.

== Heritage listings ==
Oberon has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Blue Mountains National Park: Blue Mountains walking tracks
* 124 Oberon Street: Malachi Gilmore Memorial Hall
* Tarana-Oberon railway: Oberon railway station
* Caves Road: Jenolan Caves

==Commercial area==
Oberon&#x27;s main streets are Carrington Avenue‚ÄìOberon Street and Ross Street. The town has several parks and sports facilities. Such parks include the Oberon Showground, Cunynghame Oval, and Apex Park. Oberon also has a museum on North Street. Oberon has a caravan park on Cunynghame Street off North Street, a hospital on North Street, a camping ground adjacent to the caravan park and a wood gallery on Oberon Street. Rotary Lookout is located on Abercrombie Road and to the east of the town is the Blenheim State Forest which includes walking tracks.


== Culture ==
Fishing is a pastime possible at Lake Oberon and The Reef Reserve. Oberon also has a golf club off Hume Street.

South of the town is Lake Oberon, Oberon Dam and the Fish River. There is a picnic area at the dam and a reserve with walking tracks near the lake.

Mayfield Garden is a popular botanical garden that covers 16 hectares (40 acres) of land. It is open daily, except on public holidays and there is an entry fee.

==Transport==
From 1923 to 1979, Oberon was served by a branch railway line noted for its very steep 4% gradients and very sharp 100¬†m radius curves. Following closure, that line was allowed to fall into disrepair, but has been under restoration by the volunteer organisation Oberon Tarana Heritage Railway since 2005.

===Road access===
* From Bathurst it is around southeast, along the sealed O&#x27;Connell Road.
* From Great Western Highway near Hartley it is around south-west, along the sealed Jenolan Caves and Duckmaloi Roads.
* From Goulburn it is around north, along the sealed Goulburn-Oberon Road.
* Relief maps of the area are provided by NSW Central Ranges Weather.

===Bus connection===
There is a Monday to Friday morning bus service to station where it connects with the &quot;Bathurst Bullet&quot; train to Sydney with an afternoon return connection. This replaced the previous Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday coach service to .

Weekday bus services to Bathurst are operated by Newmans, which connect with several other NSW TrainLink rail and coach services, and with Buslines local buses.

==Climate==
Oberon has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;); with mild to warm summers, cool to cold winters averaging 0¬∞ to 9¬†¬∞C and evenly-spread precipitation throughout the year. Frosts occur regularly in autumn, winter and spring, and can also occur at the height of summer. Because of its elevation and windward position on the dividing range, moderate to occasionally heavy snowfalls can be expected each year.

<doc id="593795" wikidata="Q620524" url="?curid=593795" title="Lane Cove River">
<text>The Lane Cove River, a northern tributary of the Parramatta River, is a tide-dominated, drowned valley estuary west of Sydney Harbour, located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The river winds through a bushland valley and joins Parramatta River at Greenwich and Woolwich, where together they form an arm of Sydney Harbour, and serves as a border along with Middle Harbour separating Sydney&#x27;s North Shore.

==Ecology==
The Lane Cove River rises near Thornleigh and flows generally south for about . Its catchment area is approximately .

The upper reaches are in a narrow, forested valley eroded into the North Shore Plateau. Fiddens Wharf was the site of early 19th century logging. The middle reaches are impounded by a weir just upstream of Fullers Bridge. Sections of the valley are forested and are protected within the Lane Cove National Park, an area of , formerly a State Recreation Area. The lower reaches of the Lane Cove River, downstream from the weir near Fullers Bridge, are tidal and merge into Sydney Harbour at Greenwich and Woolwich. There are significant areas of mangrove communities along the shores.

The confluence of the river with Scout Creek is in Lane Cove National Park at Cheltenham. At North Epping, still within the confines of the national park, it is joined by Devlins Creek from the south and Terrys Creek near Macquarie Park. Southwest of Killara and Lindfield, the width of the river expands, continuing south through Lane Cove River National Park, towards the suburbs of Linley Point and Riverview, before finally reaching its mouth between Greenwich Point and Woolwich, where it merges with Parramatta River and soon after becomes part of Port Jackson, more commonly known as Sydney Harbour.

Devlin Creek was named after the Devlin family, who lived in Willandra, a historical house in Ryde.

==Register of the National Estate==
The area surrounding the river, no more than wide, is called Lane Cove National Park, and is a site of ecological importance, listed on the Australian Register of the National Estate. It contains an endangered community of fungi, some species of which have still not been classified.

A popular caravan park and campground known as Lane Cove River Tourist Park is located on the western side of the valley above the river.

==Great North Walk==
The Lane Cove River is the site of many old trails and tracks, some of which have survived from logging days. They are now used for recreational purposes. Some of them have been incorporated into the Great North Walk, a long-distance walking trail from Sydney to Newcastle. This trail passes along the Lane Cove River between Boronia Avenue, Hunters Hill, and Thornleigh Oval, Thornleigh. On the east side of Thornleigh Oval, the trail makes use of Lorna Pass, a track built during the Depression of the 1930s to provide relief work. The pass was named after Lorna Brand, who raised money for the work. Another trail, the Lane Cove Valley Walk, stretches from Thornleigh to Lindfield.

==Fairyland==
From 1913 to the early 1970s, the Swan family operated a picnic area called Fairyland, which was located on the banks of the river, upstream from Epping Road. The area was originally a market garden, but the family turned it into a picnic area when they realised the commercial potential. Facilities were developed to the point where Fairyland had its own footbridge, BBQ fireplaces, boat swing, razzle dazzle ride, shelter, dance hall and wharf. The area has now returned to nature and is contained within the Lane Cove National Park. The Great North Walk passes through it.

==Cultural items of significance==

Harry Smith was a businessman who owned land in what is now the Marsfield area. Smith created a picnic area in a section of his property he called Curzon Park, which bordered the Lane Cove River and consisted of eighty acres of bushland. The picnic area has long since returned to nature, but a set of stone steps can still be seen at the top of the escarpment above the river. It is almost certain that Smith had these steps built to provide access to the picnic area. This is supported by a news item from 1899, which states that a set of stone steps went down to the picnic area.

Smith also had a quarry in the area, near the present location of Talavera Road, from which he obtained the stone to build his mansion, Curzon Hall. The latter was built circa 1899 and is located at the intersection of Balaclava and Agincourt Roads. The name Curzon came from his wife&#x27;s name: Isabella Curzon Webb. The building was purchased by the Vincentian Fathers in 1922 and turned into a Catholic seminary. In 1983 it was acquired for business purposes and became a function centre. Curzon Hall is listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register as a site of significance. Smith is remembered as a philanthropist who allowed the public to use the picnic area free of charge, and who built the public school in Marsfield. He died in 1913.

The river is known for being the site of the mysterious deaths of Dr Gilbert Bogle and Margaret Chandler on 1 January 1963. The cause of their deaths has never been established; but there is a strong theory that the two deaths may have been caused by accidental hydrogen sulphide poisoning, due to the build-up of the poisonous gas beneath the river bed that formed both naturally and by pollutants from nearby factories along the river.

== Bridges ==
Four bridges cross the Lane Cove River:
*De Burghs Bridge on A3 which connects North Ryde and West Pymble.
*Fullers Bridge on A38, which connects Chatswood and North Ryde.
*Epping Road Bridge carrying Epping Road traffic on the sides and M2 Hills Motorway in the centre, both of which connect Lane Cove to Ryde.
*Fig Tree Bridge on Burns Bay Road, which connects Lane Cove West and Hunters Hill.

The suburb&#x27;s name is derived from its namesake Greenwich, by the banks of the River Thames in London. Parramatta River had been known as the &#x27;Thames of the Antipodes&#x27; and other nearby suburbs were also named after Thames localities of Putney, Woolwich and Henley.
The Cammeraygal clan of the Dharug-speaking people of the Eora Nation were the first inhabitants of the Greenwich area, and lived along the foreshores of the harbour, hunting in the hinterland and trading with other clans.

The first known occasion when a European went to the area was in 1788, when Lieutenant Henry Ball passed through the area while returning from a trip to the Middle Harbour area. Land grants began in 1794 and industries developed in the area during the 1830s.

Aboriginal people were still present in the 1820s, but disease and displacement had driven them out by the 1860s.

Early land grants were made to Samuel Lightfoot, a convict, in 1794, and William Gore, public servant, in 1813. Gore built a road from his farm at Artarmon to Gore Cove, which was the beginning of Greenwich Road.

In the 1830s George Green and his father Amaziah bought land in Greenwich, with access to the harbour, and along with others began a shipbuilding industry on the foreshore. When Green subdivided his land in 1840, the name &#x27;Greenwich&#x27; was mentioned for the first time. 

Greenwich House‚Äîa two-storey Georgian home made from sandstone blocks‚Äîwas built on the estate of George Green in 1836 and still stands on the corner of George and St Lawrence Streets. The house was eventually sold, by the mortgage holders, to Gother Kerr Mann in 1853, and remained in that family until 1949.

The eastern tip of Greenwich is called Manns Point, after Gother Kerr Mann (1809‚Äì1899). Mann was the first Chief Commissioner for Railways, the Superintendent of convicts at Cockatoo Island and the builder of Fitzroy Dock.

By the early 1880s Greenwich Point had a post office, general store, and school, with around 16 houses. Upper Greenwich took longer to develop, with most of the area still virgin bush. But with the improvement in north shore roads, and increasing subdivision in upper Greenwich, some grander houses were built near River Road, and new estates were subdivided as Greenwich became a commuter suburb.

Between the 1880s and the 1940s a number of successful dairies operated in Greenwich, run by the Anderson, Hogan, Mather and Clarke families. The milk from Anderson&#x27;s was delivered by boat along the Lane Cove River and to the residents of Cockatoo Island. Hogan&#x27;s dairy at Chisholm Street had 300 cows by the time it closed in 1928. Clarke&#x27;s dairy was on the site of the current golf course.

Light industry was set up along the foreshores of Greenwich, including Shipbuilding, brickmaking, quarrying, and the Patent Asphaltum Company which refined bitumen and manufactured building materials. Shell opened a terminal at Gore Bay in 1901, importing and distributing petroleum products. It grew over time to include the sites of the Patent Asphaltum works, and several wharves, as well as the shale oil refining works of John Fell &amp; Co. By the late 1930s, over 500 workers were employed at the Shell site. Today fuel products unloaded at Gore Bay are transferred by an underground pipe to the Clyde Refinery.

Greenwich was the northern portal of the first tunnel under Sydney Harbour. The tunnel was dug by the New South Wales Government Railways to Birchgrove to provide a reliable way to get electricity from the Pyrmont Power Station to the tram network on the north shore. Cables had previously been laid on the floor of the harbour, but damaged by ships dragging their anchors. The tunnel was commenced in 1913 and excavated by hand, completed in 1924. Part of the tunnel is through the silt at the bottom of the river, so required constant pumping until it was allowed to flood in 1930 and abandoned from 1969. The tunnel was excavated almost entirely from the Greenwich side, as the residents on Long Nose Point at Balmain (now Birchgrove) successfully objected to the noise of the compressor powering pneumatic drills. There were both the tunnel portal and a vertical shaft nearer the water used for excavation. The tunnel passes between the floor of the harbour and the Balmain coal mine further below the harbour. The tunnel is excavated entirely through Hawkesbury sandstone which lies below the silt and sediment which form the floor of the harbour. At its lowest point, it is below sea level.

== Heritage listings ==
Greenwich has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 95 River Road: Pallister, Greenwich
* Greenwich Infants School
* Sydney Harbour railway electricity tunnel

==Education==
Greenwich Public School is a local primary school with two separate campuses located 1.5 kilometres apart. It was opened in 1876 as a provisional school, after repeated petitions from residents, and became a public school in 1880, with a new building and site in Mitchell Street in 1881. In 1909 the school moved to the site of the current infants school in Greenwich Road, and the primary school moved to Kingslangley Road in 1950. The children of former Prime Minister John Howard, attended the school.

==Transport==
Greenwich Point ferry wharf on the Parramatta River is served by Sydney Ferries Cockatoo Island ferry services between Circular Quay and Cockatoo Island. A second wharf on the Lane Cove River is served by peak-hour Captain Cook Cruises services. Busways bus route 265 from Lane Cove to North Sydney operates via Greenwich. There are also regular buses on the Pacific Highway. The closest train stations are at Wollstonecraft and St Leonards.

==Sport and recreation==
The Greenwich Village Games are held every four years featuring numerous sports and competitions held mainly at Bob Campbell Oval (Gore Creek Oval) and Lane Cove Aquatic Centre. Greenwich Sports Club, which was founded in 1936, organises football (soccer) for men, women and children and netball for girls. There are two sailing clubs as well. One is situated at the mouth of the Lane Cove River and the other off Greenwich Point.

A Scout Hall is located in the eastern side of Greenwich, and is the usual meeting place for the Greenwich/Wollstonecraft Scout group, as well as for other local organisations.

<text>The snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis) is a bird of prey within the family Accipitridae, which also includes the eagles, hawks, and Old World vultures. Its relative, the slender-billed kite, is now again placed in &quot;Helicolestes&quot;, making the genus Rostrhamus monotypic. Usually, it is placed in the Milvine kites, but the validity of that grouping is under investigation.

==Description==

Snail kites are long with a wingspan. They weigh from . There is very limited sexual dimorphism, with the female averaging only 3% larger than the male. They have long, broad, and rounded wings, which measure each. Its tail is long, at , with a white rump and undertail coverts. The dark, deeply hooked beak, measuring is an adaptation to its diet. The tarsus is relatively long as well, measuring .

The adult male has dark blue-gray plumage with darker flight feathers. The legs and cere are red. The adult female has dark brown upperparts and heavily streaked pale underparts. She has a whitish face with darker areas behind and above the eye. The legs and cere are yellow or orange. The juvenile is similar to an adult female, but the crown is streaked. Adults have red or orangish-brown irises, while juveniles have dark brown irises.

It flies slowly with its head facing downwards, looking for its main food, the large apple snails. For this reason, it is considered a molluscivore.

==Taxonomy==
Lerner and Mindell (2005) found &quot;R. sociabilis&quot; sister to &quot;Geranospiza caerulescens&quot;, and that those two along with &quot;Ictinea plumbea&quot; were basal to both the &quot;Buteogallus&quot; and &quot;Buteo&quot; clades. They concluded that &quot;Rostrhamus&quot; belonged in Buteoninae (sensu stricto) and not in Milvinae, but noted that more investigation was needed. 

==Distribution==
The snail kite breeds in tropical South America, the Caribbean, and central and southern Florida in the United States. It is resident all-year round in most of its range, but the southernmost population migrates north in winter and the Caribbean birds disperse widely outside the breeding season.

==Breeding==
It nests in a bush or on the ground, laying three to four eggs.

==Conservation==
The snail kite is a locally endangered species in the Florida Everglades, with a population of less than 400 breeding pairs. Research has demonstrated that water-level control in the Everglades is depleting the population of apple snails. However, this species is not generally threatened over its extensive range.

In fact, it might be locally increasing in numbers, such as in Central America. In El Salvador, it was first recorded in 1996. Since then, it has been regularly sighted, including immature birds, suggesting a resident breeding population might already exist in that country. On the other hand, most records are outside the breeding season, more indicative of post-breeding dispersal. In El Salvador, the species can be observed during the winter months at Embalse Cerr√≥n Grande, Laguna El Jocotal, and especially Lago de G√ºija. &quot;Pomacea flagellata&quot; apple snails were propagated in El Salvador between 1982 and 1986 as food for fish stocks, and it seems that the widespread presence of high numbers of these snails has not gone unnoticed by the snail kite.

===In the Everglades===
Due to the drainage and habitat destruction of the Everglades, they were one of the first species put on the US Fish and Wildlife Service&#x27;s endangered species list on 11 March 1967. The snail kite continued to decline, reaching a population of less than 800 in 2007. Their population gradually rebounded after the invasive snail species &quot;Pomacea maculata&quot; began to flourish in the Everglades wetlands and served as a new food source for the snail kites, reaching a count of 3,000 snail kites in 2022. Everglades conservation efforts over the course of 30 years and costing over US$20 billion also contributed to restoring native vegetation of the snail kites&#x27; habitats and flow of water in marshes.

==Diet==

This is a gregarious bird of freshwater wetlands, forming large winter roosts. Its diet consists almost exclusively of apple snails, especially the species &quot;Pomacea diffusa&quot;, &quot;P. maculata&quot; and &quot;P. paludosa&quot; in Florida, other species of &quot;Pomacea&quot; (&quot;P. doliodes&quot;) elsewhere in its range, and species of the genus &quot;Marisa&quot; (&quot;M. cornuarietis&quot;).

Snail kites have been observed eating other prey items in Florida, including other freshwater snail species (such as the banded mystery snail), crayfish in the genus &quot;Procambarus&quot;, crabs in the genera &quot;Dilocarcinus&quot; and &quot;Poppiana&quot; (&quot;P. dentata&quot;), black crappie, ring-necked snakes, small turtles (including the common musk turtle, striped mud turtle, coastal plain cooter, Florida red-bellied cooter, Florida softshell turtle, and other unidentified species), rodents and carcasses (based only on a single reported case of a dead American coot). It is believed that snail kites turn to these alternatives only when apple snails become scarce, such as during drought, but further study is needed. On 14 May 2007, a birder photographed a snail kite feeding at a red swamp crayfish farm in Clarendon County, South Carolina.

The presence of the large introduced &quot;Pomacea maculata&quot; in Florida has led the snail kites in North America to develop larger bodies and beaks to better eat the snail, a case of rapid evolution. These non-native snails provide a better food source than the smaller native snails and have had a positive effect on the kites&#x27; populations.

<doc id="593807" wikidata="Q1048615" url="?curid=593807" title="The Cyberiad">
<text>The Cyberiad (), sometimes subtitled Fables for the Cybernetic Age, is a series of humorous science fiction short stories by Polish writer Stanis≈Çaw Lem published during 1964‚Äì1979. The first collected set of stories was originally published in 1965, with an English translation by Michael Kandel first appearing in 1974.

The main protagonists of the stories are Trurl and Klapaucius, two &quot;constructor&quot; robots who travel the galaxy, constructing fantastic machines. Nearly every character is either a humanoid robot or some sort of intelligent machine, with few living creatures ever appearing. These robots have for the most part organized themselves into proto-feudal societies with strict ranks and structures. The timeline of each story is relatively constrained, with the majority of the individual tales following one or both of the two protagonists as they find and aid civilizations and people in need of their creations, advice, or intervention. Though the thematic content of the stories is broad, most focus on problems of the individual and society, as well as on the vain search for human happiness through technological means.

In 1970, the book was adapted into the opera &quot;Cyberiada&quot;. Alongside many of Lem&#x27;s other works, this book has been an inspiration for numerous films and games. There is a steel statue of Elektryba≈Çt, Trurl&#x27;s legendary electronic bard, in the Copernicus Science Centre, Warsaw.

&quot;The Cyberiad&quot; shares the peculiar robot&#x27;s universe, as well as the style, with the cycle &quot;Fables for Robots&quot;.

Despite its titular status, the word &quot;Cyberiad&quot; refers to nothing in the tales; it is used only once in an ambiguous context by Trurl&#x27;s Elektryba≈Çt.
==Trurl and Klapaucius==

Trurl and Klapaucius are &quot;constructors&quot; ‚Äî brilliant engineers capable of God-like exploits through the machines they build. The two have complete control over the physical laws of the universe; for instance, on one occasion, Trurl creates an entity capable of extracting accurate information from the random motion of gas particles, which he calls a &quot;Demon of the Second Kind&quot;, with the &quot;Demon of the First Kind&quot; being Maxwell&#x27;s demon. In another instance, the two constructors re-arrange stars near their home planet in order to advertise their services. Despite this incredible power, without their machines the two are relatively powerless, and are captured, incapacitated, and physically beaten numerous times.

The duo are both best friends and intellectual rivals. Their adventures consist of both building revolutionary machines at home and travelling the galaxy to aid those in need. Although they are firmly established as fundamentally good and righteous people through their actions, they typically demand payment for their services, usually delivered in the form of precious metals. In one story, when rewards for slaying a dragon are promised and not delivered, Trurl disguises himself in the skin of the dragon to continue harassing the local inhabitants until he can collect his payment. Despite their love of money, they prefer to aid the oppressed and help civilizations reach higher &quot;levels of development&quot; (at least by their own standards.) The machines the two build and the journeys they embark on are the basis for the greater moral lessons of the book.

==The world and its inhabitants==

Though humans are virtually nonexistent, most intelligent machines are still highly anthropomorphic in nearly every aspect; they are bipedal, divided into two sexes, experience human emotions, and at least appear to be capable of love. Robotic versions of physical and mental disabilities, old age and death, particularly in case of accidents or murder, are also common, though mechanical language is used to describe them. Death is theoretically avoidable through constant repair (and sometimes even reversible), but most machines still carry with them a deep-seated knowledge of their own mortality.

The universe of &quot;The Cyberiad&quot; is primarily pseudo-medieval, with kingdoms, knights, princesses, and even dragons existing in abundance. The level of technology of the vast majority of kingdoms also mirrors medieval times, with swords, robotic steeds, and gallows widespread. Alongside this, space travel, extremely advanced technology, and futuristic weapons and devices are available. Often the lessons of medieval chivalry are retaught in a way more applicable to the machine age.

==Themes==
The stories are individually framed as fables, with each having a set of moral themes. These themes include the randomness of existence, the imperfection of the human form, and artificial life.

Aside from the obvious themes about robotics, the work also contains more overt criticisms of the conditions under which it was written, as some stories having directly political messages. Nearly every aristocratic ruler is portrayed as inept or corrupt, ruling over their subjects with brutality and fear. This philosophy was relatively in line with the Soviet view of monarchism. However, contrasting that, a robotic analogue of Karl Marx is also put to death, not because of his ideas, but because he refused to stop attempting to implement his philosophy after his initial failure (a clear critique of the Soviet Union.) The H.P.L.D. (&quot;Highest Possible Level of Development&quot;) civilization outright states that it is impossible to force happiness on a civilization, and that it must struggle through the process of building a society itself.

A select few stories parallel more specific tropes; the tale of &quot;O kr√≥lewiczu Ferrycym i kr√≥lewnie Krystalii&quot; (&quot;Prince Ferrix and the Princess Crystal&quot;) apes the typical structure of the medieval love fairytale. The prince goes to seek the love of Princess Crystal (the sexual dimorphism of robotics is never thoroughly explained), but she says she will only marry a &quot;paleface,&quot; a term for humans in this apocalyptic future. This is also the only story in which a human is a character; though they are mentioned offhand in others, they are never treated as anything more than a myth. The prince disguises himself as a paleface to try and win her love, but when a true human is brought before her, the incredible ugliness of the human makes it obvious that the prince is only pretending. The Princess forces them to duel to the death, and Prince Ferrix easily crushes the human. However, in the process, Princess Crystal realizes how hideous humans are and falls in love with Ferrix, and the two live happily ever after, in a parody of Chivalric romance. Other parodied tropes include the Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice and the legend of King Midas. By parodying these with Robotics, Lem reevaluates the ethical and moral considerations of these myths.

==Publication history==

The whole series was published in the 1965 Polish collection by Wydawnictwo Literackie and also included stories published previously elsewhere.
* (&quot;Bajki robot√≥w&quot; Wydawnictwo Literackie 1964), translated as &quot;How the World was Saved&quot;.
* (&quot;Bajki robot√≥w&quot; Wydawnictwo Literackie 1964), translated as &quot;Trurl&#x27;s Machine&quot;.

===The Seven Sallies of Trurl and Klapaucius===

Polish title: .
All these stories were first published in the 1965 Polish collection by Wydawnictwo Literackie.
* (&quot;The first sally, or the trap of Gargantius&quot;)
* (&quot;The first sally (A), or Trurl&#x27;s electronic bard&quot;)
* (&quot;The second sally, or the offer of king Krool&quot;)

* (&quot;The sixth sally, or how Trurl and Klapaucius created a demon of the second kind to defeat the pirate Pugg&quot;)
* (&quot;The Seventh Sally or How Trurl&#x27;s Own Perfection Led to No Good&quot;)

===Translation===
In 1974, an English translation by Michael Kandel was published by Harcourt Brace. The translation has been widely regarded as hugely successful, and Kandel was nominated for numerous awards. Since the original book contained heavy wordplay and numerous neologisms, Kandel opted for a method of translation that was more free-form than a typical translation, and took heavy liberties in regards to words, sentence structure, and especially poetry. Though this inventive approach to translation can be controversial, in &quot;The Cyberiad&quot; it has been widely praised as resulting in an immensely successful final result. It has been held up by numerous scholars as a possible standard for the translations of more complex works. Lem himself heavily praised the book and approach, saying that Kandel was the &quot;best translator his work could ever have&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;The Cyberiad&quot; has been widely praised and acknowledged for its writing, humor, and allegorical nature. Most critics agree that it is a work of &quot;comic-satirical science fiction&quot;, though many have argued that the deeper themes present make it far more than a simple work of science fiction.

The book was met with praise at release, with critics applauding both the original and the renowned translation. Leslie Fiedler called the work &quot;truly amusing and profoundly disturbing at the same time&quot;. Though some critics disliked the directness of the fables, it was agreed that it was if nothing else, a sharp and amusing satire of our modern society. Later on, more critical literary analysis also praised the work, drawing attention to its sharp political messages, critique of anthropocentrism, and approach to the psychology of artificial life. It has been considered a classic of Eastern European science fiction and has become widely appreciated in both the Eastern European and broader scientific and technological communities.

The book as a whole, and some stories contained within, have been praised by numerous science fiction writers, most famously Ursula K.¬†Le Guin and Kurt Vonnegut.

An elaborate interactive Google Doodle inspired by the illustrations of Daniel Mr√≥z in &quot;The Cyberiad&quot; was created and published on November 23, 2011 in his honor for the 60th anniversary of Lem&#x27;s first published book: &quot;The Astronauts&quot;.In it, an animated character resembling Lem meets a giant robot.

==Adaptations==
In 1970, Krzysztof Meyer composed &quot;Cyberiada&quot; ‚Äì an opera to his own libretto based on selected stories.

In 1975 an animated film &quot;Maszyna Trurla&quot; (8¬†minutes) was released based on Lem&#x27;s story (director , screenplay ).

&quot;The Seventh or How Trurl&#x27;s Own Perfection Led to No Good&quot; (Polish title: ) was adapted as part of the plot for the film &quot;Victim of the Brain&quot;, there called &quot;The Perfect Imitation&quot;. This same story, in which Trurl creates a miniature mechanical kingdom for a tyrant to play with, was also an inspiration of the game &quot;SimCity&quot;.

<text>Lawrence Hill (born January 24, 1957) is a Canadian novelist, essayist, and memoirist. He is known for his 2007 novel &quot;The Book of Negroes&quot;, inspired by the Black Loyalists given freedom and resettled in Nova Scotia by the British after the American Revolutionary War, and his 2001 memoir &quot;Black Berry, Sweet Juice: On Being Black and White in Canada&quot;. &quot;The Book of Negroes&quot; was adapted for a TV mini-series produced in 2015. He was selected in 2013 for the Massey Lectures: he drew from his non-fiction book &quot;Blood: The Stuff of Life&quot;, published that year. His ten books include other non-fiction and fictional works, and some have been translated into other languages and published in numerous other countries.

Hill was born in Newmarket, Ontario, to an American couple who had immigrated to Toronto from Washington, D.C., in 1953. His father was black and his mother was white. Hill served as chair of the jury for the 2016 Scotiabank Giller Prize.

==Personal life and education==
Hill was born in 1957 in Newmarket, Ontario, the second son of Daniel G. and Donna Mae (Bender) Hill, an interracial American couple who had married in 1953 and settled in Toronto, where his father was completing his doctorate in sociology at the University of Toronto. His father, a sociologist, civil servant and activist, later became the first director and chairperson of the Ontario Human Rights Commission. Daniel Hill also served as the Ombudsman of Ontario. He published a still seminal work about Black history in Canada: &quot;The Freedom Seekers: Blacks in Early Canada&quot;.

Hill&#x27;s mother, Donna Mae Bender, came from a white Republican family in Oak Park, Illinois, and graduated from Oberlin College. She met his father in Washington, D.C., where she worked for a Democratic US Senator and became a civil rights activist. In the early 1950s in Toronto, Donna Hill worked as a human rights activist for the city&#x27;s Labor Committee for Human Rights. She lobbied the Ontario government to enact anti-discrimination legislation. She also wrote about Black Canadian history; her &quot;A Black Man&#x27;s Toronto, 1914-1980: The Reminiscences of Harry Gairey&quot; (1980) was published by the Multicultural History Society of Ontario.

Daniel and Donna Hill co-founded The Ontario Black History Society with Wilson O. Brooks and other friends. Lawrence Hill was born as the second son, and grew up with his brother Dan and sister Karen in the predominantly white Toronto suburb of Don Mills. Dan Hill became a singer-songwriter and writer, and their sister, the late Karen Hill (1958-2014), was also a writer. Her novel, short stories, poems and an essay are still to be published.

Hill&#x27;s paternal grandfather and great grandfather were university-educated, ordained ministers of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. It was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1816 as the first independent black denomination in the United States.

After attending the University of Toronto Schools, Hill earned a B.A in economics from Laval University in Quebec City. He moved temporarily to the United States to earn an M.A. in writing from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.

Lawrence Hill presently lives with his second wife, the writer Miranda Hill, in Hamilton, Ontario, and in Woody Point, Newfoundland. He has four daughters and a son. He has lived and worked in Baltimore, Maryland; Spain, and France.

==Career==
Hill taught undergraduate fiction writing while completing his M.A. at Johns Hopkins. Since completing that program, he returned to Canada, where he has taught creative writing or mentored creative writers in numerous adult education programs. These have included The Becoming Ground program at the University of British Columbia, the Humber School for Writers, Sage Hill Writing Experience, and The Banff Centre.

Hill has also served numerous times on juries granting literary awards or writing grants. He has frequently spoken at academic and social conferences, literary festivals, libraries, universities and high schools across Canada, the United States, Mexico, Europe, South America, South Africa, the Caribbean and Australia.

He is a Senior Fellow at Massey College at the University of Toronto. As of September 2016, Hill is affiliated with the University of Guelph.

==Writing career==
Hill&#x27;s first passion was running, but he was unable to realize his dreams of becoming an elite athlete and winning an Olympic gold medal in the 5,000 meters. He threw himself into writing in his teenage years and completed his first story at the early age of 14. After receiving his B.A. in economics at Laval University, Hill worked for four years as a full-time newspaper reporter for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, and later for &quot;The Winnipeg Free Press&quot;.

He became the parliamentary bureau chief for the newspaper in Ottawa, covering Parliament, the Supreme Court of Canada and a wide range of cultural, economic and social issues. Resigning from his position as parliamentary bureau chief in 1986, Hill moved to Spain to begin writing fiction full-time.

The work of his parents in the human rights movement and Black history greatly influenced Hill&#x27;s work related to identity and belonging as a writer. Hill curated and wrote the exhibit on his father for the Ontario Archives, called &quot;The Freedom Seeker: The Life and Times of Daniel G. Hill&quot;.

Hill&#x27;s nonfiction books include &quot;Trials and Triumphs: The Story of African-Canadians&quot; (1993), &quot;Women of Vision: The Story of the Canadian Negro Women&#x27;s Association&quot; (1996), his memoir &quot;Black Berry, Sweet Juice: On Being Black and White in Canada&quot; (2001), &quot;The Deserter&#x27;s Tale: The Story of An Ordinary Soldier Who Walked Away from the War in Iraq&quot; (2007), &quot;Dear Sir, I Intend to Burn Your Book: An Anatomy of a Book Burning&quot; (2013), and &quot;Blood: The Stuff of Life&quot; (2013).

Hill&#x27;s fictional works include &quot;Some Great Thing&quot; (1992), &quot;Any Known Blood&quot; (1997),&quot;The Book of Negroes&quot; (2007), and &quot;The Illegal&quot; (2015), which brought his work to broad public attention and won numerous awards.

Published in at least ten countries, &quot;The Book of Negroes&quot; won several awards, including the Rogers Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize, both CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Canada Reads&quot; and Radio-Canada&#x27;s &quot;Le Combat des livres&quot;, and the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize for Best Book. The novel has been chosen by community or academic reading programs as a central work for discussion at Dalhousie University (twice), Trent University, the Calgary Public Library, The City of Rothesay (NB), the Hamilton Public Library and the One Book One Community program linking Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge, Ontario.

&quot;The Book of Negroes&quot; was adapted as a six-part television miniseries. Hill co-wrote it with director Clement Virgo. The series featured actors Aunjanue Ellis, Cuba Gooding, Jr., and Louis Gossett Jr. Filmed in South Africa, Nova Scotia, and Ontario in early 2014, the miniseries premiered in Cannes, Toronto and New York City in the fall of 2014, began to air on CBC Television in Canada in January 2015, and was scheduled to air on BET in the US in February 2015.

Although Hill&#x27;s novel &quot;The Book of Negroes&quot; was first released in 2007 by W. W. Norton &amp; Company under the title &quot;Someone Knows My Name&quot;; the American publisher re-issued a new edition of the novel with the original title in January 2015 to build on the mini-series. BET has committed to releasing the TV miniseries in the US as &quot;The Book of Negroes&quot;. HarperCollins Australia published this novel as &quot;Someone Knows My Name&quot; in Australia and New Zealand.

Hill&#x27;s short fiction has been featured in the literary quarterlies &quot;Descant&quot; and &quot;Exile&quot;, as well as in Canadian newspapers and magazines such as &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;Toronto Life&quot;. &quot;The Walrus&quot; published Hill&#x27;s award-winning essay &quot;Is Africa&#x27;s Pain Black America&#x27;s Burden&quot;, and a short story entitled &quot;Meet You at the Door&quot;. Its January‚ÄìFebruary 2015 issue featured Hill&#x27;s essay on the creative process of adapting &quot;The Book of Negroes&quot; for the TV mini-series.

Hill served as a writer in residence with the Toronto District School Board from 2011 to 2013, visiting some twenty schools to discuss the art and business of writing with students.

Hill was selected in 2013 as CBC Massey Lecturer. In the fall of that year he delivered lectures in five Canadian cities, drawn from his non-fiction book &quot;Blood: the Stuff of Life&quot; (2013). Also aired on CBC Radio, &quot;Blood: The Stuff of Life&quot; is a personal consideration of the physical, social, cultural and psychological aspects of blood, how it defines, unites and divides us. In 2015, &quot;Blood: The Stuff of Life&quot; won the Hamilton Literary Award for Non Fiction.

He was named a Member of the Order of Canada in 2015.

His newest novel, &quot;The Illegal&quot;, was published in fall 2015. The novel has already been optioned for film treatment by Conquering Lion Pictures, the producers of the &quot;Book of Negroes&quot; miniseries. &quot;The Illegal&quot; won the 2016 edition of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, making Hill the first writer ever to win the competition twice.

<doc id="593820" wikidata="Q7969967" url="?curid=593820" title="Warrawee, New South Wales">
<text>Warrawee is a suburb on the Upper North Shore of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Warrawee is located 17 kilometres north-west of the Sydney Central Business District, in the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council. Warrawee is predominantly a residential suburb with few commercial entities. Notably, its railway station supports no commercial activities, which is uncommon on the Sydney train network. The closest thing to commercial activity is Knox Grammar School, which is no more than 200 metres from the station, although it is officially located in Wahroonga, it is located predominantly in Warrawee, and sits on the boundary of the two suburbs

The suburb should not be confused with Wirrawee, the fictional small country town in the Tomorrow series of books for young people by John Marsden, or the film derived from the first book, &quot;Tomorrow, When the War Began&quot; (2010).

==History==
The name Warrawee is believed to be an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;rest a while&quot;, &quot;stop here&quot; or &quot;to stand&quot;.

The suburb has a notable architectural history, with a number of houses designed by prominent architects. The earliest significant homes were &quot;Pibrac&quot; (1888), &quot;Cheddington&quot; (1890) and &quot;Wirepe&quot; (1893).

In 1888, the public servant and patron of exploration, Frederick Eccleston Du Faur, built his house &quot;Pibrac&quot; in Pibrac Avenue. The house was designed by John Horbury Hunt, a Canadian architect who settled in Australia and favoured the Arts and Crafts style, as well as the North American Shingle style, which he introduced to Australia. Later alterations were carried out by B.J. Waterhouse. The house is built predominantly of timber, with extensive use of timber shingles, on a sandstone base. It is considered a good example of Hunt&#x27;s work and is listed on the Register of the National Estate.

&quot;Cheddington&quot;, the oldest home in established Hastings Road, is also attributed to Horbury Hunt, constructed in brick, with a slate roof and characteristic shingling. &quot;Wirepe&quot;, designed by M.B. Halligan for architect Walter Traill, uses deep verandahs and high ceilings to elicit a homestead atmosphere, with fine corbelled chimneys and cedar shingles. The brickwork is laid in colonial bond, and the house sits at the heart of the Ku-ring-gai heritage precinct on Hastings Road.

&quot;Upton Grey&quot; (now &quot;Kooyong&quot;) was built in 1894 to a John Sulman design, and its English features are a local landmark. Across the century it has served as a government social services home, a CSIRO field station, and a boarding house for Knox Grammar School. It is now in private hands and retains features replicated at Sulman&#x27;s important &quot;Ingleholme&quot;.

&quot;Exley House&quot;, in Finlay Road, Warrawee, was designed by Harry Seidler in 1957 for Cecil Exley, an engineer with the Sydney Water Board, and his wife. The three-bedroom, two-bathroom home is the only red-brick single-storey dwelling Harry Seidler designed. It has recently been sympathetically extended.

As with all North Shore suburbs with Aboriginal names, Warrawee was the name of a railway station which was then attached to the surrounding suburb. Warrawee developed in the early 20th century as an exclusive residential district, with no shops, offices, post office, public school, churches or through roads. In 1923, Knox Grammar School was founded at Earlston, a Warrawee property across the railway line. All blocks were kept to between , and the form of houses was tightly controlled. Joseph Beresford Grant used his money to guarantee the exclusiveness of the development, and also ensured that there were no shops around the area.

==Transport==

The Pacific Highway is the main arterial road. Warrawee railway station is on the North Shore railway line on the Sydney Trains network. The railway station built in 1900 was the last one built on the North Shore Line before it was extended to North Sydney. Local residents had to fight the railway commissioners for a railway station, that is only one kilometre from Wahroonga.

At the , 3.7% of employed people travelled to work on public transport compared to 4.6% average for all of Australia, while 25.5% travelled by car (either as driver or as passenger) compared to 57.8% nationally.

CDC NSW operates one bus route through the suburb of Warrawee:

* 573: Turramurra to Sydney Adventist Hospital

== Demographics ==

At the , the suburb of Warrawee recorded a population of 3,170 people. Of these:

*Age distribution: The median age of Warrawee residents was 42 years. Children aged under 15 years made up 18.1% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 17.3% of the population.
*Ethnic diversity: More than half (57.7%) of residents were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 66.9%; the next most common countries of birth were China 10.3%, England 4.8%, India 3.3%, South Africa 3.0%, and South Korea 2.4%. The most common ancestries in Warrawee were English 34.0%, Australian 23.7%, Chinese 20.2%, Scottish 10.8%, and Irish 9.4%.
*Finances: The median weekly household income was $3,388, more than double the national median of $1,746. Real estate values were correspondingly high: the median monthly mortgage repayments were $3,500 compared to the national median of $1,863. 
; Housing : The majority (84.3%) of private dwellings were family households, 14.7% were single person households and 1.0% were group households. Separate houses accounted for 63.9% of dwellings, while 30.6% were flats or apartments and about 4.7% were semi-detached.

==Schools==
Warrawee Public School is a primary school situated about 0.5 kilometres to the south of the station in Turramurra, on the Pacific Highway. According to the school&#x27;s website, it was established in 1906. 

Knox Grammar School is predominately in the suburb of Warrawee, and sits no more than 200m from Warrawee railway station. The school lists its address as Wahroonga since the Administration Office is situated within that suburb.

<doc id="593823" wikidata="Q7785151" url="?curid=593823" title="Thirsty Merc">
<text>Thirsty Merc are an Australian pop rock band, formed in 2002 by Rai Thistlethwayte, Phil Stack (bass guitar), Karl Robertson (drums), and Matthew Baker (guitar). In 2004, Baker was replaced by Sean Carey, who was, in turn, replaced by Matt Smith in 2010. Thirsty Merc have released one¬†extended play, &quot;First Work&quot; (September 2003), and five¬†studio albums: &quot;Thirsty Merc&quot; (August 2004), &quot;Slideshows&quot; (April 2007), &quot;Mousetrap Heart&quot; (June 2010), &quot;Shifting Gears&quot; (September 2015), and &quot;Celebration&quot; (June 2022). The band have sold over 200,000 albums, toured extensively around Australia, and received national radio airplay for their tracks.

In June 2005, &quot;Billboard&quot;‚Ä≥s Christie Eliezer felt their debut album showed &quot;electric rock-, classical- and jazz-influenced pop [that] appealed to Australian radio programmers&quot;. The work reached the top-20 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified platinum by ARIA for shipment of 70,000 units by the end of 2005. &quot;Slideshows&quot; peaked at No.¬†4 in Australia‚Äîtheir highest position. It reached No.¬†38 on the New Zealand Albums Chart; however, &quot;Thirsty Merc&quot; had attained No.¬†29 in that market. The group were nominated for four ARIA Awards in 2005, and the Thistlethwayte-written track &quot;20 Good Reasons&quot; was nominated for Song of the Year at the APRA Music Awards of 2008. From 2006, their song &quot;In the Summertime&quot; was the opening theme for the Australian TV reality show &quot;Bondi Rescue&quot;.

==History==
Three of the founding members of Thirsty Merc‚ÄîMatthew Baker, Karl Robertson, and Phil Stack‚Äîhad played together in various bands in Dubbo, a regional New South Wales city. In 1996, Drown was formed with Baker on guitar, Robertson on drums, Peter Jamieson on vocals, and Stack on bass guitar. By 1998 Baker, Jamieson and Stack had split to form Twenty Two and then moved to Sydney. In 2002, Baker and Stack returned to Dubbo where Rai Thistlethwayte, from Sydney, as lead singer (later also on guitar and keyboards) and Stack worked as a live jazz duo and session musicians. They were joined by Baker and Robertson, and formed a pop rock band, initially called Thirsty; soon after they moved to Sydney and were renamed, Thirsty Merc. The band&#x27;s name came from Thistlethwayte&#x27;s 1979 Mercedes-Benz 280SEL, which was a gas-guzzler.

In October 2006 Thistlethwayte described his jazz and R&amp;B background to MusicFix and the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;rock Sinatra&quot; where &quot;[t]he outlook, I guess, is about being a young person in today&#x27;s society ... being an Australian in an American-ised, Britain-ised kind of world, where you&#x27;re trying to stay true to yourself&quot;. Baker added &quot;We contrived to make it not contrived ... Rai was all for originality in his own vision and so were we&quot;.

A car accident on 22 September 2015 at Streatham, Victoria during a Thirsty Merc tour killed the band&#x27;s stage manager and injured drummer Mick Skelton.

===2003‚Äì2004: &quot;First Work&quot;===
Thirsty Merc&#x27;s first extended play, &quot;First Work&quot;, was released on 8 September 2003 by the band&#x27;s own label, Don&#x27;t Music and was distributed by Warner Music Australia. The five-track CD was independently recorded during downtime at a studio where Thistlethwayte worked. The EP reached the top¬†100 on the ARIA Singles Chart; and its lead single, &quot;Wasting Time&quot;, achieved radio airplay on national radio stations, Triple J and Nova. The self-funded music video for the single was broadcast on Channel [V], and became the &#x27;ripe clip of the week&#x27;. At the time of recording the EP they were without a label. After extensive gigging around Sydney&#x27;s pubs, representatives from Warner had signed the band in June 2003, for the release of the EP and the follow-up single, &quot;Emancipate Myself&quot;, which was a reworked version of the EP track. It was issued in April 2004 and &quot;The Age&quot;‚Ä≥s Andrew Murfett declared that &quot;this bitter tirade wrapped in melodic hooks has become one of the biggest local radio successes of the year&quot;.

===2004‚Äì2007: Debut studio album===
On 16 August 2004 Thirsty Merc issued their debut studio album, the self-titled, &quot;Thirsty Merc&quot;, which was co-produced by the group with Lindsay Gravina (The Living End, Magic Dirt). Also that month, prior to a national tour in support of its release, Baker left and was replaced on guitar by Sean Carey (ex-Midnight Swim), whom they had met when playing a support slot to his group at a Kings Cross venue, Club 77. The album spent 48¬†weeks on the ARIA Albums Chart Top¬†50, peaking at No.¬†15, and launched the band in the Australian mainstream. &quot;dB Magazine&quot;‚Ä≥s Kelly Parish observed &quot;[e]ven though the band&#x27;s sound is predominantly rock, it has been influenced by more traditional flavours ... they have developed a very wide audience which embraces both the alternative and mainstream camps&quot;. &quot;Thirsty Merc&quot; reached No.¬†29 on New Zealand&#x27;s RIANZ Albums Chart. It was recorded and mixed on 2¬†inch tape, and then further mixed by Gravina at his Birdland Studios.

Five singles were released from &quot;Thirsty Merc&quot;: &quot;Emancipate Myself&quot;, &quot;My Completeness&quot; (August 2004), &quot;Someday, Someday&quot; (December), &quot;In the Summertime&quot; (April 2005), and &quot;When the Weather Is Fine&quot; (September). All five appeared in the ARIA Singles Chart top¬†50, with the highest charting, &quot;Someday, Someday&quot; reaching No.¬†19. Of these singles only &quot;In the Summertime&quot; reached the top¬†50 in New Zealand, where it peaked at No.¬†12. In June 2005 &quot;Billboard&quot;‚Ä≥s Christie Eliezer felt the album showed &quot;eclectic rock-, classical- and jazz-influenced pop [that] appealed to Australian radio programmers&quot;. The album was due for United States and European release in early 2006 on Atlantic Records.

&quot;In the Summertime&quot; was nominated at the ARIA Music Awards of 2005 for &quot;Best Video&quot;, while &quot;Someday, Someday&quot; was nominated for &quot;Single of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best Group&quot;, and &quot;Best Pop Release&quot;. At the ceremony in October, the group performed &quot;Someday, Someday&quot;. In 2006 Carey described the group&#x27;s style to &quot;Jet Magazine&quot;, it was &quot;Just be yourself&quot; and &quot;about being young and living in Australia. We‚Äôre not trying to be 50 Cent or anything, we‚Äôre all just boys from the country, just trying to move into the city and make our way&quot;. He listed Evermore, Crowded House, Foo Fighters and Cold Chisel as his favourite bands. In February 2007 they supported Ozzy Osbourne on the Australian leg of his national tour.

===2007‚Äì2010: &quot;Slideshows&quot;===
Thirsty Merc&#x27;s second album, &quot;Slideshows&quot;, was issued on 21 April 2007 via Warner Music Australia. It became the band&#x27;s most successful release yet, peaking at No.¬†4 in Australia, although it was less successful in New Zealand, only reaching No.¬†38. To support the release of &quot;Slideshows&quot;, Thirsty Merc toured Australia, playing an album tour in theatres nationally and then various regional tours, the biggest of which had 38 shows booked across seven weeks. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;20 Good Reasons&quot; (March 2007), reached No.¬†4 in Australia and No.¬†17 in New Zealand. In June they supported Evermore on a tour of New Zealand, showcasing their &quot;unique blend of pop rock dance-able balladry&quot;. The next three singles appeared in the top¬†100 in Australia, &quot;The Hard Way&quot; (September), &quot;Those Eyes&quot; (December), and &quot;Homesick&quot; (May 2008).

The band&#x27;s main songwriter, Thistlethwayte, inadvertently wrote a &quot;break-up album&quot;, which &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;‚Ä≥s Brett Winterford noted was unusual, &quot;that the articulate and intelligent 27-year-old has strung together 12 such stock-standard, radio-friendly songs about broken hearts&quot;. Thistlethwayte described his influences: &quot;Jazz taught me about spontaneity ... Central to jazz is improvisation. It&#x27;s also great to get that knowledge of theory, an understanding of the geeky side of music&quot; and writing advertising jingles had showed him how to &quot;do a lot of things in differing genres and recording styles‚Äîbut had to try to be authentic about it&quot;. After writing the tracks, the other members &quot;choose the songs that had the ultimate emotional impact&quot;.

===2010: &quot;Mousetrap Heart&quot;===

On 14 January 2010 Thirsty Merc announced that Carey had left the band and was replaced on guitar by Matt Smith, from afrobeat and reggae band, The Strides. Carey wanted to work as a record producer and spend more time with his wife. On 18 June 2010 Thirsty Merc released their third album, &quot;Mousetrap Heart&quot;, which was recorded mostly in Los Angeles with Matt Wallace co-producing, while two tracks were produced in Melbourne with Gravina. Bernard Zuel of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; opined that &quot;we buy, or actively avoid, songs that excite a response in us but radio wants songs that fit in, that don&#x27;t provoke strong responses, that offend the fewest people ... this [album] is a collection of extremely professional, well-considered, carefully targeted songs whose key performance indicators are ticked off one by one in a manner so efficient you suspect band meetings must have an agenda, notes secretary and double-cream biscuits for elevenses&quot;.

The band toured nationally in July 2010 to support the album, while its lead single, the title track, had appeared in May and charted in the Top¬†30 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The second single, &quot;Tommy and Krista&quot;, was released in September, which peaked at No.¬†10 in New Zealand. Another single, &quot;All My Life&quot;, was featured in the promotional clips for the 2010 AFL grand final. Its music video was directed by Adrian Van de Velde and was shot in early October in Bangkok, Thailand. The narrative is a &#x27;heroic love&#x27; set on a local military base and features Russian model-actress Maria Mazikova, together with 50 Thai army troops, an Iroquois helicopter, and a Chinook helicopter. In November &quot;Lip Magazine&quot;‚Ä≥s Shannon Andreucci reviewed a live gig, &quot;[they] are certainly no Pixies, Beatles or Sex Pistols. They&#x27;re not breaking any rules or boundaries in the revolutionary world of rock music. In fact they are perfectly happy and capable of playing within the parameters of radio friendly and commercially safe pop rock. But one thing is for sure; they go the extra mile in giving a charmingly refined and hearty live performance and that in itself should be commended&quot;.

===2022‚Äìpresent: &quot;Celebration&quot;===
On 30 May 2022 Thirsty Merc announced on their official instagram page they will release their next studio album, Celebration, on 17 June 2022. This will be accompanied with a national tour, Celebration 2022, taking place between July and September of the same year. The album features reimagined covers of well known Australian songs from different decades. The lead single, released with the album announcement, is a cover of Daryl Braithwaite&#x27;s As the Days Go By. Other confirmed songs include Who Listens To The Radio, That‚Äôs When I Think of You, Bad Habits and The Seekers&#x27;s 1966 hit Hey There, Georgy Girl.

<text>The North Shore Line is a railway line serving the North Shore in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The North Shore Line extends from Sydney Central station through the western limb of the City Circle, across the Sydney Harbour Bridge and through the North Shore area to Hornsby where it joins the Main North Line. Services on the line are primarily provided by the T1 North Shore &amp; Western Line and T9 Northern Line, with some services to Wyong during peak hours.

==History==

As early as 1874, people dreamed of a railway in the North Shore. In that year, a petition was made for a line from Pearce&#x27;s Corner (Wahroonga) to Sydney Harbour. When one local was approached, he said: &quot;If I live to be as old as Methuselah, I will never see a railway&quot;. In 1875, a committee was formed at the Greengate Hotel (Killara). The Public Works Department was opposed, saying &quot;either then or now, the line would run from nowhere to nowhere&quot;. In 1879, surveyors proved that a line between Pearce&#x27;s Corner and Blue&#x27;s Point was practical. In September of that year, the records of that survey were destroyed in the Garden Palace fire. In that year, Sir Henry Parkes tried to win votes in St Leonards by advocating a railway line and Harbour Bridge. There was much controversy where the line should terminate, and didn&#x27;t go ahead. In 1884, it was proposed that a new line to Falcon Street (Crows Nest) would be built, and tenders were called, but the first accepted tenderers, Morton and Hardy, withdrew, and eventually the tender of E. Pritchard and Co. was accepted, and the line terminated at the present St. Leonards station.

Completed in May 1889, the North Shore Line was opened on 1 January 1890 as a single track between Hornsby and St Leonards. No Sunday service was given until the line was extended to the Sydney Harbour foreshore at Milsons Point on 1 May 1893. Transport between this original Milsons Point station and central Sydney was by ferry boat.

In the meantime agitation and preparation for the extension of the line to the harbour went on, and in a Parliamentary debate it was stated by Mr. Bruce Smith, Minister for Public Works: &quot;The North Shore was peculiarly adapted for the establishment of fresh suburbs as the climate was exceptionally favourable, and if only means of communication was afforded, a large population would spring up there.&quot; Mr. Dibbs (afterwards Sir George) doubted its commercial value, said the work was farcical, and would be a sham and a failure. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in 1889 did not report favourably on the scheme for extension to Milson&#x27;s Point, but in 1890 an amended scheme was approved. Tenders for the construction to Milson&#x27;s Point were let in April, 1891, to O. McMaster, but the line was not opened till 1 May 1893. A passenger on the first train from the Point says those on board struck matches in the Lavender Bay tunnel, and a banquet was held in a marquee at Turramurra, where the Hillview now stands.

New intermediate stations were built at Waitara (20 May 1895), Warrawee (1 August 1900), Killara (10 July 1899), and Artarmon (6 July 1898). As early as 1901, a station was called for Beechworth Road (Pymble), but the Railway Commissioner at the time said that &quot;the movement is slightly premature&quot; and was never built. Most of the North Shore line was duplicated between 1900 and 1909. In 1927, the line was converted to electric operation using a 1500 volt DC, overhead supply. Electric trains on the North Shore line commenced services on 22 December.

The construction works for the Sydney Harbour Bridge necessitated truncation of the southern terminus from Milsons Point to Lavender Bay.

When the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened on 19 March 1932 a new Milsons Point station (on the bridge approach) came into operation and the North Shore Line was extended through it and over the Sydney Harbour Bridge to link with the underground lines of central Sydney. The result is that the two ends of the North Shore Line link to the Sydney railway system at Central and Hornsby.

After 1932 the original Lavender Bay station became a storage depot for electric trains, and the line connecting Lavender Bay to the North Shore line was reduced to single track. This line joins the current North Shore line at Waverton station.

In 2009, a second connection to the Main Northern line was added with the opening to the Epping to Chatswood railway line. This connecting line was removed and incorporated into the Sydney Metro in 2019.

The North Shore Line is now a major commuter artery between the North Shore and central Sydney. In early years, Old Milsons Point, Bay Road, St Leonards, Chatswood, Lindfield, Gordon, Pymble, Turramurra, Wahroonga and Hornsby stations had goods yards. All but St Leonards, Chatswood and Hornsby yards had disappeared by mid-twentieth century, and the latter three did not survive into the late twentieth century.

== Route ==
The North Shore line officially starts at Central, with a junction with the Main Suburban line south of the Flying Junctions. The line runs through Central, then goes underground alongside the City Circle, with stations at Town Hall and Wynyard. There is a crossover north of Wynyard allowing southbound trains to terminate when there is trackwork in the City Circle. After Wynyard, the line emerges onto the western side of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. On the other side of the bridge is Milsons Point station. The line continues for a short distance to North Sydney station, which has 4 platforms. The outer two tracks are for through services, while the inner two tracks are loop lines for terminating trains.

After North Sydney, the line snakes its way through Sydney&#x27;s lower North Shore, passing Waverton, Wollstonecraft, St Leonards and Artamon stations. At Waverton is the small junction with the Lavender Bay line, providing access to Lavender Bay/North Sydney Sidings. This section of line also has the sharpest curve on Sydney&#x27;s suburban network, at Wollstonecraft of . At Chatswood, there are 4 platforms, with the inner two used by Sydney Metro Northwest and formerly to enter the Epping to Chatswood rail link.

The line continues up the North Shore region, with stations at Roseville, Lindfield, Killara, Gordon, Pymble, Turramurra, Warrawee, Wahroonga and Waitara. Lindfield has an additional bay platform in the centre, used to terminate trains from the south. A similar arrangement exists at Gordon, where the centre platform is connected to a loop line that can terminate trains in both directions. After Waitara, the line proceeds to Hornsby, where there is a junction with the Main Northern Line and Hornsby Maintenance Centre.

<text>St Leonards is a suburb on the lower North Shore of Sydney, Australia. St Leonards is located north-west of the Sydney central business district and lies across the local government areas of Municipality of Lane Cove, North Sydney Council and the City of Willoughby.

==History==
St Leonards was named after English statesman Viscount Sydney of St Leonards. Originally, St Leonards applied to the whole area from the present suburb of North Sydney to Gore Hill. The township of St Leonards in 1883 is now North Sydney.

The Royal North Shore Hospital in St Leonards was opened in 1885. Sir Henry Parkes laid the foundation stone of the hospital on 18 June 1887. It moved to the present site on 10 June 1903.

St Leonards railway station is the oldest railway station on the North Shore railway line opening in 1890.

Gore Hill Cemetery was established on the Pacific Highway in 1868 and was the main burial site for the area until its closure in 1975. It is still maintained as a heritage site by the Department of Local Government and Lands, Willoughby Municipal Council and the Heritage Council of New South Wales.

After World War II, St Leonards, which had been a largely residential and industrial area, began to change. In the 1950s and 1960s, the suburb increased its urbanization and population growth, as the Greater Sydney area expanded.

From the 1960s to the 1980s, St Leonards saw a growing demand for housing, particularly from professionals and families seeking proximity to the city. This led to the construction of high-rise apartment buildings, which reshaped the suburb‚Äôs skyline. The advent of new commercial and retail developments also gave the area a more suburban feel.

North Shore Private Hospital in St Leonards opened in 1998.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, St Leonards underwent a process of gentrification, as older homes were replaced by modern apartments and office buildings. The area became more desirable to young professionals due to its proximity to the Central Business District (CBD) and the integration of mixed-use developments.

The 2010s saw St Leonards continue to evolve with major mixed-use projects, transforming the suburb&#x27;s character. High-rise apartments, commercial spaces, and retail areas became more common, contributing to its suburban feel.

==Commercial area==
St Leonards has a commercial centre that complements the role of Chatswood, Lane Cove and North Sydney as one of the centres for business on the North Shore of Sydney.

<doc id="593836" wikidata="Q930009" url="?curid=593836" title="Lane Cove">
<text>Lane Cove is a suburb on the Lower North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Lane Cove is nine¬†kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district and is the administrative centre for the local government area of the Lane Cove Council. Lane Cove West and Lane Cove North are separate suburbs.

Lane Cove occupies a peninsula on the northern side of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), at the opening of the Lane Cove River. The regional administrative and shopping hub of Chatswood is located three kilometres away, along with Macquarie Park four kilometres away.

== History ==

There are a number of possibilities of the origin of the name &#x27;Lane Cove&#x27;. The first written use of the name was by Lieutenant William Bradley after he had just sailed along the river in 1788. Some have argued that it was named after Lieutenant Michael Lane, a respected cartographer, who had once worked with Captain Cook. Others say that it was in honour of John Lane, who was the son of the London Lord Mayor at the time as well as a good friend of the first Governor, Arthur Phillip. In any case, the name stuck, and by the 1800s was being used to refer to all the land north of the river.

===Aboriginal culture===
Prior to the arrival of the First Fleet, the area in which Lane Cove is situated was inhabited by the Cam-mer-ray-gal Group of the Ku-ring-gai Aboriginal Tribe. The group, which inhabited the north shore of Port Jackson, was one of the largest in the Sydney area.

===European settlement===
Lieutenant Ralph Clark was the first European to land, a short distance from the entrance to the Lane Cove River on 14 February 1790. There were land grants in 1794 to some privates and non-commissioned officers in the New South Wales Corps, although few of these grants were actually settled as the steep, timbered land was not particularly habitable. However, Lane Cove was an excellent source for timber and other commodities that the settlers required. One early settler named William Henry (1778-1862) was granted 1,000 acres in an area which now includes much Lane Cove National Park. The grant was never confirmed due to the Rum Rebellion and Henry was thrown off the land. It is suspected that John MacArthur had schemed to ensure that William Henry suffered because he had supported William Bligh during the rebellion. During the 19th century, farms and dairies were also established. There were also many industrial and manufacturing factories constructed around Greenwich. A detailed history of the early years of Lane Cove is found in Ball. John and Pam, &quot;Revisiting the early history of Lane Cove&quot;, 2010, Oughtershaw Press, . 253 pages.

Most of the residential growth in the area however occurred after World War II when returning soldiers were granted blocks of land around Lane Cove. The land value, which was relatively cheap during this time, surged during the 1980s and 1990s when the water views, large suburban blocks, ease of transport and quiet streets became popular.

From 1900 to 1979, St Joseph&#x27;s Girls&#x27; Home operated on the Pacific Highway. About 3000 girls passed through it.

In 2005, Lane Cove briefly caught the attention of the world&#x27;s press when part of an apartment block (which is now classified as being in the new suburb of Lane Cove North) collapsed into an excavation for the Lane Cove Tunnel and a pet bird in the evacuated block was rescued by a robot.

Lane Cove North was split off to become a separate suburb on 20 January 2006.

===Former tram line===
A tram service to Lane Cove opened as an electric line from Crows Nest in February 1900, with trams connecting with other electric services at Ridge Street. It was initially opened as far as Gore Hill and extended to Lane Cove in March, 1909. Some through services operated to and from Milsons Point.

In September 1909, a new line was opened from McMahons Point to Victoria Cross, North Sydney and a new direct route was opened via what is now the Pacific Highway from Victoria Cross to Crows Nest. Services to Lane Cove and Chatswood were altered to operate to and from McMahons Point via the new direct route to Crows Nest, in conjunction with the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

In March, 1932 the Sydney Harbour Bridge with its associated railway and tramway tracks was opened and services from Lane Cove to the CBD were diverted to operate to and from Wynyard station via the Sydney Harbour Bridge route. Trams entered Wynyard station via a tunnel entrance at the south-eastern pylon of the bridge.

From Lane Cove a cross regional service to Balmoral was also available. Upon departure from the Lane Cove terminus opposite the council chambers, trams travelled north on Longueville Road turning right onto the Pacific Highway. At Crows Nest, separate lines branched left onto Falcon Street, travelling through Cammeray, Neutral Bay, Cremorne Junction and Mosman before joining Military Road. The line then split into two separate lines at the intersection of Middle Head Road and Bradleys Head Road. Turning left into Gordon Street off Middle Head Road, the line then entered on to its own off-road reservation, crossing several small residential streets as it wound its way down to Henry Plunkett Reserve, entering The Esplanade near the corner of Botanic Road and terminating near Hunters Parade.

== Heritage listings ==
Lane Cove has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 334 Burns Bay Road: Carisbrook, Lane Cove

== Commercial area ==

Although Lane Cove contains residential, it contains some commercial and industrial.

Lane Cove has a shopping centre that includes a pedestrian plaza at the eastern end of Burns Bay Road, where it meets Longueville Road. There is a Coles supermarket, a Woolworths supermarket, a Harris Farm, a pub and a number of small specialty stores in this area, as well as a large number of restaurants and cafes. At the end of Longueville Road is the Lane Cove Businessman&#x27;s Club which is the only local Club in the Area.

Several large businesses are located in Lane Cove including the Australian headquarters of statistical software company SAS, the recording house for Warner Bros., Festival Mushroom Records, as well as BlueScope&#x27;s marketing branch in Lane Cove West.

=== Lane Cove Library ===

Lane Cove Library is located at Library Walk, Lane Cove. The library received a major update with an extension/refurbishment which increased Library space from 1,203 sq m to 3,301 sq m - exceeding state benchmarks.

===Greenwich Library===
A small Branch Library is located at Greenwich.

===Lane Cove Aquatic Leisure Centre===
Lane Cove Aquatic Leisure Centre contains a 50-metre swimming pool, a 25-metre swimming pool, a shallow pool for toddlers and young children and a well-equipped gym. There are also water springs, a sauna, spa and a kiosk.

== Transport ==
The Gore Hill Freeway, which brings traffic from the city, the airport and southern suburbs connects to two major roads at Lane Cove - the Pacific Highway which travels north and Epping Road which goes north-west. The traffic problems at these intersections led to the construction of the Lane Cove Tunnel, which takes vehicles straight from the Gore Hill Expressway to the M2. Cars can now travel from the Baulkham Hills Shire to the airport without having to pass a single set of traffic lights (although there are tolls to pay in each direction). Since the opening of the Lane Cove Tunnel, two lanes of Epping Road between Mowbray Road and Lane Cove have been removed, with the left lane in each direction becoming a bus lane, reducing Epping Road in some sections to one lane in each direction for general traffic and increasing congestion. Getting in and out of Lane Cove can take 20 ‚Äì 30 minutes in a car in peak hour.

Lane Cove was the terminus of one of Sydney&#x27;s northern tram lines, which closed in the late 1950s. Trams operated to Wynyard in the city and Balmoral via Crows Nest. The current 254 bus route largely follows the city route from Longueville Road to Wynyard via Crows Nest and North Sydney. A new major bus interchange constructed at the intersection of Epping Road and Longueville Road, as part of the Lane Cove tunnel works, opened in March 2008 with approximately 25 separate bus routes (including school routes) operating from here.

<text>Thomas Kenneth Mattingly II (March 17, 1936 ‚Äì October 31, 2023) was an American aviator, aeronautical engineer, test pilot, rear admiral in the United States Navy, and astronaut who flew on Apollo 16 and Space Shuttle STS-4 and STS-51-C missions.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Mattingly was scheduled to fly on the Apollo 13 mission, but three days before launch, he was replaced by Jack Swigert because he was exposed to German measles (which Mattingly did not contract). Mattingly flew as Command Module Pilot for Apollo 16 and made 64 lunar orbits, making him one of 24 people to fly to the Moon. Mattingly and his Apollo 16 commander, John Young, are the only people to have flown to the Moon and also a Space Shuttle mission. (Fred Haise, Mattingly&#x27;s originally scheduled crewmate for Apollo 13, performed atmospheric flight testing of the Space Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests.)

During Apollo 16&#x27;s return flight to Earth, Mattingly performed an extravehicular activity (EVA) to retrieve film cassettes from the exterior of the spacecraft, the command and service module. It was the second &quot;deep space&quot; EVA in history, at great distance from any planetary body. it remains one of only three such EVAs which have taken place, all during the Apollo program&#x27;s J-missions.

== Early life and education ==
Thomas Kenneth Mattingly II was born on March 17, 1936, in Chicago, Illinois, to Thomas Kenneth Mattingly (1903‚Äì1995) and Constance Mason Mattingly (; 1905‚Äì1997). His father, who had been hired by Eastern Airlines soon after his son&#x27;s birth, moved the family to Hialeah, Florida. Aviation became part of Mattingly&#x27;s life from a very young age; he later recalled that his &quot;earliest memories...all had to do with airplanes&quot;.

Mattingly was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout. He graduated from Miami Edison High School in 1954, and went on to receive a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Auburn University in 1958. He was also a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity (Epsilon Alpha chapter).

== Military career ==
Mattingly was commissioned in the U.S. Navy as an ensign in 1958 and received his aviator wings in 1960. He was then assigned to Attack Squadron Thirty-five (VA-35) at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia, and flew Douglas A-1H Skyraider propeller aircraft aboard the aircraft carrier from 1960 to 1963. In July 1963, he was transferred to Heavy Attack Squadron Eleven (VAH-11) at Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida, where he flew Douglas A-3B Skywarrior jet aircraft for two years and deployed aboard .

While Mattingly was based at Sanford, a fellow officer invited him along on a mission to take aerial photos of the Cape Canaveral launch of Gemini 3 (carrying Mattingly&#x27;s future Apollo 16 Commander John W. Young) from the air. 

During his second cruise, Mattingly attempted to join the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, but the cruise ended after the class started. However, he was selected to attend the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California, where future astronauts Edgar Mitchell and Karol J. Bobko were his classmates and his instructors included Charles Duke, his Apollo 16 crewmate, and Henry W. Hartsfield Jr., whom Mattingly later commanded on STS-4.

== NASA career ==
=== Selection and training ===
On September 10, 1965, NASA began the selection process for the fifth astronaut group. From a pool of 351 applicants, NASA picked 159 candidates who met the basic qualifications, including being United States citizens born on or after December 1, 1929, who were no more than six feet tall. They were also required to have at least 1,000 hours of flight time in jet aircraft. Mattingly had previously shown little interest and inclination to apply for the astronaut program, but his views changed at the Air Force Test Pilot School where he and his classmates were offered the chance to apply for either NASA or the United States Air Force (USAF) Manned Orbiting Laboratory program. Mattingly and Mitchell chose the latter and were rejected. The deadline for applying for the NASA group had passed, but one of their instructors was able to get NASA to accept their applications. On the interview panel the astronaut office representatives were John W. Young and Michael Collins, who were at that time in training as prime crew for Gemini 10. Mattingly later recollected that he was &quot;perplexed&quot; by Young. Collins asked Mattingly how he felt about the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, to which Mattingly replied that he thought it was a &quot;fun aircraft&quot; but without worth in combat. Collins appeared to dislike the answer and Mattingly felt he had blown his chance. However, after the conclusion of the selection process, Mattingly was called by NASA&#x27;s Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton with an offer to become an astronaut.

At the time of his selection, Mattingly had 2,582 hours of flight experience, including 1,036 hours in jet aircraft. He also had a bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering or in the physical or biological sciences as required by the initial qualifications. From the 100 military personnel and 59 civilian candidates, NASA selected 19 to join the group for training as astronauts.

Mattingly, a lieutenant in the Navy, was a student at the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards AFB, California, when NASA selected him as an astronaut in April¬†1966.

=== Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 ===

At first, Mattingly was part of the support crew for Apollo 8. Mattingly served as CAPCOM during Apollo 8&#x27;s second television transmission and subsequent preparation for trans-Earth injection.

Mattingly then trained in parallel with Bill Anders for Apollo 11 as backup command module pilot, because Anders was going to retire from NASA in August¬†1969 and, in case of mission delay, would be unavailable.

=== Apollo 13 ===

Mattingly was to be the Command Module Pilot on the Apollo 13 mission. Originally, Jim Lovell, Mattingly and Fred Haise were scheduled to fly on Apollo 14 but his crew was switched to Apollo 13 so that the commander of the other crew, Alan Shepard, who was grounded during Project Gemini could train longer. Three days prior to launch, he was removed from the mission because he had been exposed to German measles (which he never contracted) and was replaced by the backup CM pilot, Jack Swigert. As a result, he missed the dramatic in-flight explosion that crippled the spacecraft. However, Mattingly played a large role in helping the crew solve the problem of power conservation during re-entry.

=== Apollo 16 ===
The swapout from Apollo 13 placed Mattingly on the crew that flew Apollo 16 (April¬†16‚Äì27, 1972), the fifth crewed lunar landing mission. The crew included John Young (Commander), Mattingly (Command Module Pilot), and Charlie Duke (Lunar Module Pilot). The mission assigned to Apollo¬†16 was to collect samples from the lunar highlands near the crater Descartes. While in lunar orbit the scientific instruments aboard the Command/Service Module &quot;Casper&quot; extended the photographic and geochemical mapping of a belt around the lunar equator. A combined total of 26 separate scientific experiments were conducted in lunar orbit and during cislunar coast.

During the return leg of the mission, Mattingly carried out an extravehicular activity (EVA) to retrieve film and data packages from the science bay on the side of the service module. Although the mission of Apollo¬†16 was terminated one day early out of concern over several spacecraft malfunctions, all major objectives were accomplished.

=== Space Shuttle flights ===

Following his return to Earth, Mattingly served in astronaut managerial positions in the Space Shuttle development program.

Mattingly was named to command STS-4, the fourth and final orbital test flight of the , launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June¬†27, 1982, with Henry W. Hartsfield Jr., as the pilot. This seven-day mission was designed to further verify ascent and entry phases of shuttle missions; perform continued studies of the effects of long-term thermal extremes on the orbiter subsystems; and conduct a survey of orbiter-induced contamination on the orbiter payload bay. Additionally, the crew operated several scientific experiments located in the orbiter&#x27;s cabin and in the payload bay. These experiments included the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System experiment designed to investigate the separation of biological materials in a fluid according to their surface electrical charge. This experiment was a pathfinder for the first commercial venture to capitalize on the unique characteristics of space. The crew is also credited with effecting an in-flight repair which enabled them to activate the first operational &quot;Getaway Special&quot; (composed of nine experiments that ranged from algae and duckweed growth in space to fruit fly and brine shrimp genetic studies). STS-4 completed 112 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on July¬†4, 1982. Mattingly and Hartsfield were greeted by President Ronald Reagan after the landing; Reagan recognized the pair, both graduates of Auburn University, as &quot;you two sons of Auburn&quot; in his welcoming speech.

STS-51-C, the first Space Shuttle Department of Defense mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January¬†24, 1985. The crew included Mattingly (spacecraft commander), Loren Shriver (pilot), James Buchli and Ellison Onizuka (Mission Specialists), and Gary Payton (DOD Payload Specialist). STS-51-C performed its DOD mission which included deployment of a modified Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) vehicle from the . Landing occurred on January¬†27, 1985.

== Post-NASA career ==
In 1985, Mattingly retired from NASA, then retired from the Navy the following year with the two-star rank of Rear admiral (upper half), and entered the private sector. He worked as a Director in Grumman&#x27;s Space Station Support Division. He then headed the Atlas booster program for General Dynamics in San Diego, California. At Lockheed Martin he was vice president in charge of the X-33 development program. He then worked at Systems Planning and Analysis in Virginia.

Mattingly logged 7,200 hours of flight time, including 5,000 hours in jet aircraft. 

Mattingly was a member of many organizations. He was an associate fellow, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; fellow, American Astronautical Society; and member, Society of Experimental Test Pilots, and the U.S. Naval Institute.

== Personal life and death==
In 1970, he married Elizabeth Dailey. They had one child.

Mattingly died in Arlington, Virginia, on October 31, 2023, at age 87. NASA announced his death two days later on November 2.

== Awards and honors ==
Mattingly was a recipient of numerous awards. He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal (2); Johnson Space Center Certificate of Commendation (1970); JSC Group Achievement Award (1972); Navy Distinguished Service Medal; Navy Expeditionary Medal; National Defense Service Medal; NASA Space Flight Medal; Navy Astronaut Wings; Society of Experimental Test Pilots Ivan C. Kincheloe Award (1972); Delta Tau Delta Achievement Award (1972); Auburn Alumni Engineers Council Outstanding Achievement Award (1972); American Astronautical Society Flight Achievement Award for 1972; AIAA Haley Astronautics Award for 1973; F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale awarded him the V. M. Komarov Diploma in 1973; Department of Defense Distinguished Service Medal (1982).

Mattingly was inducted with a group of Apollo astronauts into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983. He was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997. His name also appears on The Astronaut Monument in H√∫sav√≠k, Iceland, commemorating 32 Apollo astronauts who were sent to Iceland for geological training in the 1960s. 

== In media ==
Mattingly was portrayed by Gary Sinise in the 1995 movie &quot;Apollo 13&quot; and by ≈Ωeljko Ivanek in the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;. Interviews with Mattingly were also used as part of the narrative track on the 1989 documentary film &quot;For All Mankind&quot;.

<text>Collinsia is a genus of about 20 species of annual flowering plants, consisting of the blue eyed Marys and the Chinese houses. It was traditionally placed in the snapdragon family Scrophulariaceae, but following recent research in molecular genetics, it has now been placed in a much enlarged family Plantaginaceae.

The genus is endemic to North America, and is named in honor of Zacchaeus Collins, a Philadelphia botanist of the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century. Many of the 20 species may be found in California.

Two species, &quot;Collinsia parviflora&quot; (smallflower blue eyed Mary) and &quot;Collinsia violacea&quot; (violet blue eyed Mary), had medicinal uses among American Indian peoples.

Species include:

*&quot;Collinsia antonina&quot;
*&quot;Collinsia bartsiifolia&quot;
*&quot;Collinsia callosa&quot;
*&quot;Collinsia childii&quot;
*&quot;Collinsia concolor&quot;

<text>Jean Baptiste Andr√© Dumas (; 14 July 180010 April 1884) was a French chemist, best known for his works on organic analysis and synthesis, as well as the determination of atomic weights (relative atomic masses) and molecular weights by measuring vapor densities. He also developed a method for the analysis of nitrogen in compounds.

== Biography ==
Dumas was born in Al√®s (Gard), and became an apprentice to an apothecary in his native town. In 1816, he moved to Geneva, where he attended lectures by M. A. Pictet in physics, C. G. de la Rive in chemistry, and A. P. de Candolle in botany, and before he had reached his majority, he was engaged with Pierre Pr√©vost in original work on problems of physiological chemistry and embryology. In 1822, he moved to Paris, acting on the advice of Alexander von Humboldt, where he became professor of chemistry, initially at the Lyceum, later (1835) at the √âcole polytechnique. He was one of the founders of the √âcole centrale des arts et manufactures (later named √âcole centrale Paris) in 1829.

In 1832 Dumas became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. From 1868 until his death in 1884 he would serve the academy as the permanent secretary for its department of Physical Sciences. In 1838, Dumas was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The same year he became correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands and, when that became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851, he joined as a foreign member. Dumas was president of Soci√©t√© d&#x27;encouragement pour l&#x27;industrie nationale from 1845 to 1864. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1860.

After 1848, he exchanged much of his scientific work for ministerial posts under Napol√©on III. He became a member of the National Legislative Assembly. He acted as minister of agriculture and commerce for a few months in 1850‚Äì1851, and subsequently became a senator, president of the municipal council of Paris, and master of the French mint, but his official career came to a sudden end with the fall of the Second Empire.
Dumas was a devout Catholic who would often defend Christian views against critics.

Dumas died at Cannes in 1884, and is buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris, in a large tomb near the back wall. His is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel tower.

== Scientific work ==

Dumas was one of the first to criticise the electro-chemical doctrines of J√∂ns Jakob Berzelius, which, at the time his work began, were widely accepted as the true theory of the constitution of compound bodies, and opposed a unitary view to the dualistic conception of the Swedish chemist. In a paper on the atomic theory, published in 1826, he anticipated to a remarkable extent some ideas which are frequently supposed to belong to a later period; and the continuation of these studies led him to the ideas about substitution (metalepsis) which were developed about 1839 into the theory (Older Style Theory) that in organic chemistry there are certain types which remain unchanged even when their hydrogen is replaced by an equivalent quantity of a halide element. The classification of organic compounds into homologous series was advanced as one consequence of his researches into the acids generated by the oxidation of the alcohols.

Dumas also showed that kidneys remove urea from the blood.

===Vapour densities and atomic masses===

Dumas perfected the method of measuring vapor densities which was also important in determining atomic weights (see below). A known amount of the substance being analyzed was put into a previously weighed glass bulb, which was then sealed and heated in water to vaporize the substance. The pressure was recorded with a barometer, and the bulb is allowed to cool to determine the mass of the vapor. The universal gas law was then used to determine the moles of gas within the bulb.

In an 1826 paper, he described his method for ascertaining vapour densities, and the redeterminations which he undertook by its aid of the atomic weights of carbon and oxygen proved the forerunners of a long series which included some thirty of the elements, the results being mostly published in 1858‚Äì1860. He showed &quot;in all elastic fluids observed under the same conditions, the molecules are placed at equal distances&quot;.
He also determined the atomic weight of samarium, one of the rare earth elements.

Dumas established new values for the atomic mass of thirty elements, setting the value for hydrogen to 1.

===Determination of nitrogen===

In 1833, Dumas developed a method for estimating the amount of nitrogen in an organic compound, founding modern analysis methods. He made important revisions to the existing combustion methods with a sophisticated pneumatic trough. These revisions were the flushing of the combustion tube with carbon dioxide and the addition of potassium hydroxide in the pneumatic trough. Flushing with carbon dioxide eliminated the nitrogen present in the air that previously occupied the combustion tube, eliminating the need for correction due to nitrogen in the air. The potassium hydroxide dissolved the passing carbon dioxide gas, which left nitrogen as the only gas in the collection tube.

===Theory of substitution and theory of chemical types===

At the Tuileries palace in Paris, guests at a soir√©e began reacting adversely to a gas suddenly emitted by the candles. Alexandre Brongniart asked his son-in-law, Dumas, to investigate. Dumas found that the coughing and dangerous fumes were caused by chlorine present in the candle wax. Chlorine had been used to whiten the candles, and Dumas concluded that it must have combined during the candle-making process. This led Dumas to investigate the behavior of chlorine substitution in other chemical compounds.

One of the most important research projects of Dumas was that on the action of chlorine on acetic acid to form trichloroacetic acid ‚Äì a derivative of essentially the same character as the acetic acid itself, though a stronger acid. Dumas extended this to a theory (sometimes considered a law) which states that in an organic compound, a hydrogen atom may be substituted for any halogen.

In his published paper on the subject, Dumas introduces his theory of types. Since the trichloracetic acid retained similar properties to acetic acid, Dumas reasoned that there were certain chemical structures that remained comparatively unchanged even if one atom were changed within them. The basis of this theory rests in the natural history of organism classification, which Dumas learned under the botanist de Candolle. This new theory challenged Berzelius&#x27;s previous theory of electrochemical dualism and was also a competitor of radical theory.

==Family==

He married Herminie Brongniart, daughter of Alexandre Brongniart, in 1826.

<text>Chatswood is a suburb in the Lower North Shore of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia, 10¬†kilometres north of the Sydney central business district. It is the administrative centre of the local government area of the City of Willoughby. 

==History== 

Chatswood was named after Charlotte Harnett, wife of then Mayor of Willoughby and a pioneer of the district, Richard Harnett, and the original &quot;wooded&quot; nature of the area. The moniker derives from her nickname &quot;Chattie&quot; and was shortened from Chattie&#x27;s Wood to Chatswood in the mid-1800s.

Residential settlement of Chatswood began in 1876 and grew with the opening of the North Shore railway line in 1890 and also increased with the opening of the Harbour Bridge in 1932.

Chatswood Post Office opened on 1 August 1879, closed in 1886 and reopened in 1887.

By 1900, Chatswood was easily accessible by public transport. In 1898, the electric tram line, running along Willoughby Road and Penshurst Street, had reached Victoria Avenue, and in 1908, it was extended to Chatswood railway station. In 1903 the council chambers moved from Mowbray Road to Victoria Avenue.

At this time Chatswood&#x27;s history contained orchards and dairy farms on the west side of the train station as well as factories, such as Dairy Farmers Inc and Three Threes Pickle Factory on what was then Gordon Road (now the Pacific Highway). Although now predominantly a commercial and residential area, Chatswood has an industrial past. Other factories included; Ferguson Transformers, after which Ferguson Lane is named, and the Caroma factory (formerly Marshman Brothers), now converted to residential units and a small garden park. In the eastern part of the suburb, along Scott&#x27;s Creek, there were several tanneries; the last of these closed in 1992. There is still an area with some light industry in the eastern part of the suburb.

Chatswood was declared a town centre in 1983 and a city in 1989.

Chatswood established itself as a key centre for Asian communities in the 1990s. The suburb became known for its East Asian businesses, including grocery stores, restaurants and markets. Today, Chatswood is a predominantly Asian suburb, with a significant proportion of the population of Chinese, Korean, Japanese and increasingly, other Southeast Asian backgrounds.

Another small but well-laid out park, with an industrial heritage theme, is the Mashman Park on Victoria Avenue at Septimus Street. This park pays tribute to the Mashmans brick and tile works that once stood there. Chatswood is close to Lane Cove National Park.

The Garden of Remembrance, near the railway station, commemorates the fallen men of the suburb who fought in the Boer War, World War 1, World War 2, The Korean War and Vietnam War. The roses were all grown from original cuttings of briar roses taken from the Somme region of France where more than one million soldiers were wounded or lost their lives at The Battle of Somme in 1916.
At the centre of the Garden stands the Willoughby Council Peace Tablet, which commemorates the signing of The Treaty of Versailles in 1918.

<doc id="593854" wikidata="Q255800" url="?curid=593854" title="Susan Peters">
<text>Susan Peters (born Suzanne Carnahan; July 3, 1921 ‚Äì October 23, 1952) was an American actress who appeared in more than twenty films over the course of her decade-long career. Though she began her career in uncredited and ing√©nue roles, she would establish herself as a serious dramatic actress in the mid-1940s.

Born in Spokane, Washington, Peters was raised by her widowed mother in Portland, Oregon, and, later, Los Angeles. Upon graduating from Hollywood High School, she studied acting with Austrian theater director Max Reinhardt, and signed a contract with Warner Bros. Pictures. She appeared in numerous bit parts before earning a minor supporting role in &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; (1940). She made her last film for Warner Bros. in 1942, the film noir &quot;The Big Shot&quot; opposite Humphrey Bogart and Richard Travis; after its release, Warner opted not to renew her contract.

In 1942, Peters appeared in a supporting role in &quot;Tish&quot;, which resulted in her signing a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). The same year, she had a featured role in the Mervyn LeRoy-directed drama &quot;Random Harvest&quot;, which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress and established her as a serious dramatic performer. Peters went on to appear as the lead in numerous films for MGM, including roles in the romantic comedy &quot;Young Ideas&quot; (1943), and several war films: &quot;Assignment in Brittany&quot; (1943), &quot;Song of Russia&quot; (1944), and &quot;Keep Your Powder Dry&quot; (1945).

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1945, Peters&#x27; spinal cord was damaged from an accidental gunshot wound, leaving her permanently paraplegic. She returned to film, portraying a villainess who used a wheelchair in &quot;The Sign of the Ram&quot; (1948). Peters then transitioned to theater, appearing as Laura Wingfield in a critically acclaimed 1949 production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, which was slightly altered to allow Peters to perform in a wheelchair. She followed this with a production of &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, in which she portrayed physically disabled poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning. By 1952, however, Peters had had clinical depression for several years due to the dissolution of her marriage and her limited career options. In late 1952, she began starving herself, which combined with her paralysis led to chronic kidney infections and pneumonia. She died of ensuing health complications that year at age 31.

==Life and career==
===19211939: Early life===
Peters was born Suzanne Carnahan on July 3, 1921, in Spokane, Washington, the elder of two children born to Robert and Abby Carnahan. Her father was a civil engineer of Irish descent, while her mother was of French descent, and a grand-niece of Robert E. Lee. Peters had one younger brother, Robert Jr., born in 1923. Shortly after her birth, the Carnahan family moved to Portland, Oregon. In 1928, her father was killed in a car accident in Portland, after which the family relocated to Seattle, Washington, and later to Los Angeles to live with Peters&#x27; maternal French-born grandmother, Maria Patteneaude, a dermatologist.

Peters was educated at Laird Hall School for Girls, the LaRue School in Azusa, California, and Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy in Los Angeles. During her years in high school, she worked after hours in a Los Angeles department store, earning money to help support her mother and brother. Peters&#x27; mother supported herself and her two children by working in a dress shop and managing an apartment building. &quot;We were poor but we managed, and we had fun,&quot; Peters recalled of her upbringing. She was an avid swimmer and tennis player, and also grew up riding horses; her talent as an equestrian allowed her to earn additional income by breaking and showing other people&#x27;s horses.

Peters transferred to Hollywood High School during her senior year, and began taking drama classes in which she opted to enroll in place of cooking courses: &quot;I took a drama course instead of a cooking course because I thought it was easier,&quot; Peters said. &quot;Acting meant money, and [my family] needed money.&quot; While still in high school, she signed with a talent agent. She graduated from Hollywood High School in June 1939, along with Jason Robards, Sheila Ryan, and Dorothy Morris as members of her graduating class. With a newfound interest in acting, Peters earned a scholarship to the Max Reinhardt School of Dramatic Arts.

While performing in a showcase production of Philip Barry&#x27;s &quot;Holiday&quot; at the Reinhardt School, Peters was spotted by a talent scout for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who gave her a walk-on part in George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;Susan and God&quot; (1940). During the shoot, Peters was reportedly so nervous that she fainted in front of the camera. Despite her apprehension on set, Peters became a prot√©g√©e of Cukor, who personally assigned her to private acting lessons with drama coach Gertrude Vogler. Cukor believed Peters had star potential, but needed to not &quot;talk through [her] nose.&quot; He later recalled that she reminded him of &quot;a young Katharine Hepburn. Not as aggressive as Kate, but that same finishing school appearance and drive.&quot;

===19401941: Contract with Warner Bros.===

In early 1940, Peters screen tested for Warner Bros. Pictures, who subsequently offered her a contract. Then credited under her birth name, Suzanne Carnahan, Peters was cast in various small parts in Warner Bros. films; many of these were uncredited bit parts or walk-on roles, such as in &quot;River&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Talked Too Much&quot;, &quot;Money and the Woman&quot;, and &quot;Always a Bride&quot; (all released in 1940). She had her first credited role in the big-budget Western film &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; (1940), opposite Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. In the film, Peters portrayed a young woman from Boston in love with a Kansas military officer. During the press junkets to promote the film, Peters found interviews overwhelming, and later admitted: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t a good sport. I locked myself in my compartment during most of the trip.&quot;

After &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot;, Peters had small roles in &quot;The Strawberry Blonde&quot;, &quot;Meet John Doe&quot;, &quot;Here Comes Happiness&quot; (1941), and &quot;Scattergood Pulls the Strings&quot; (all 1941), the latter of which earned her favorable reviews. She then had a lead role as an ing√©nue in the comedy &quot;Three Sons o&#x27; Guns&quot; (1941), followed by a dramatic part playing the girlfriend of a convict in &quot;The Big Shot&quot; (1942), opposite Richard Travis and Humphrey Bogart. She was also in shorts such as &quot;Young America Flies&quot; (1940) and &quot;Sockaroo&quot; (1941). At the urging of the studio (who initially suggested she change her name to Sharon O&#x27;Keefe), she dropped her birth name and took the stage name Susan Peters. By 1942, however, Warner Bros. chose not to renew her contract.

===19421944: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and critical success===

Several months after being dropped by Warner Bros., Peters was contacted by MGM to test for a supporting role in the film &quot;Tish&quot; (1942), a loose adaptation of a series of stories by Mary Roberts Rinehart. She won the role and also signed a contract with the studio. At the time, Peters was one of the most screen-tested actresses in Hollywood. While filming &quot;Tish&quot;, Peters met future husband, actor Richard Quine, with whom she also starred in her second film with MGM, &quot;Dr. Gillespie&#x27;s New Assistant&quot; (1942), alongside Van Johnson. Quine and Peters later married on November 7, 1943, at Westwood Community Church in West Los Angeles. 
After completing &quot;Andy Hardy&#x27;s Double Life&quot; (1942) in which she appeared with Mickey Rooney in the very short final scene, Mervyn LeRoy cast Peters in the drama &quot;Random Harvest&quot; (also 1942), in which she portrayed a young woman who falls in love with her step-uncle. The film was one of the top 25 highest-earning films of the year, and Peters&#x27; performance garnered her critical acclaim, earning her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

The success of &quot;Random Harvest&quot; led MGM to give Peters lead roles in other major pictures such as &quot;Assignment in Brittany&quot; (1943), in which she portrayed a French peasant girl. This was followed with a minor but top-billed credit in the comedy &quot;Young Ideas&quot; (1943) with Herbert Marshall and Mary Astor, directed by Jules Dassin. She was subsequently cast as the female lead in &quot;Song of Russia&quot; (1943) opposite Robert Taylor. The role earned her further excellent notices, with a review in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; noting her as &quot;a dramatic actress of the first rank.&quot; The film however was controversial, as its portrayal of the Soviet Union was interpreted by some audiences and critics as being favorable and of a pro-Communist stance.

In early 1944, Peters was one of ten actors and actresses who were elevated from &quot;featured player&quot; status to the studio&#x27;s official &quot;star&quot; category; the others included Esther Williams, Laraine Day, Kathryn Grayson, Van Johnson, Margaret O&#x27;Brien, Ginny Simms, Robert Walker, Gene Kelly, and George Murphy. An official portrait taken of MGM&#x27;s contracted players during this period prominently features Peters sharing the front row with the head of the studio himself, Louis B. Mayer, and alongside such actors as James Stewart, Mickey Rooney, Margaret Sullavan, Katharine Hepburn, Hedy Lamarr, and Greer Garson. In late 1944, Peters filmed &quot;Keep Your Powder Dry&quot;, a war drama co-starring Lana Turner and Laraine Day, in which she portrayed the humble wife of a soldier.

===19451950: Injury and career decline===
On January 1, 1945, Peters and husband Quine, along with his cousin and cousin&#x27;s wife, went on a duck hunting trip in the Cuyamaca Mountains near San Diego. At one point during the trip, a 22-caliber rifle discharged accidentally, and the bullet lodged in her spine. She was rushed to Mercy Hospital, roughly away, and underwent emergency surgery. The injury to her spinal cord left her permanently paralyzed from the waist down, and she was required to use a wheelchair for the rest of her life. &quot;Keep Your Powder Dry&quot; premiered three months after the incident, on March 8, 1945. Peters&#x27; mother, who had maintained a bedside vigil during her stay in the hospital, died nine months later in December 1945, which left Peters even more distraught.
MGM continued to pay Peters a $100 weekly salary and medical expenses, but, unable to find suitable projects, she subsequently left the studio. She later recalled: &quot;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer kept sending me Pollyanna scripts about crippled girls who were all sweetness and light, which I kept turning down. Two years after my accident, I gave up and broke my contract. I won&#x27;t trade on my handicap.&quot; Among the projects offered to her were Joe Pasternak and Henry Koster&#x27;s &quot;The Unfinished Dance&quot; (1947), a remake of Jean Beno√Æt-L√©vy&#x27;s &quot;Ballerina&quot;. In the film, Peters was offered the role of a ballerina who receives a spinal injury that leaves her unable to perform, but she declined. Just prior to her injury, she had begun filming the drama &quot;The Outward Room&quot;. The film&#x27;s producers considered completing the project with stand-ins and refitting the script to allow Peters to appear in a wheelchair, but the project was ultimately shelved.

Upon leaving MGM, Peters was approached for numerous acting jobs on radio programs. She guest-starred on a December 11, 1945, episode of &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; opposite previous film co-star Van Johnson. In 1946, Peters and husband Quine adopted a son, Timothy Richard. The same year, Peters made her first public appearance since her accident at Ciro&#x27;s in West Hollywood, attending the debut of Desi Arnaz and His Orchestra along with her close friend Lucille Ball. Ball and Arnaz urged Peters to continue seeking acting work. Actor and friend Charles Bickford suggested that Peters option the novel &quot;The Sign of the Ram&quot; by Margaret Ferguson, which centers on a disabled woman who manipulates those around her. Upon discussing the novel with her agent, Peters pitched the idea to Columbia Pictures, who were enthusiastic about making a film adaptation.

Production on &quot;The Sign of the Ram&quot; began in July 1947 with director John Sturges, and Peters told reporters that she had never played a character &quot;with the emotional range that this character has. It was a real challenge for me.&quot; The film&#x27;s production was difficult, as Peters had to have Quine on set to care for her son. After production ended, Peters separated from Quine, claiming that he was cruel and would not speak to her for days at a time. Their divorce was finalized on September 10, 1948. &quot;The Sign of the Ram&quot; was released in March 1948, and critic Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film an unfavorable review, writing: &quot;The fortitude of Susan Peters in returning to the screen after a cruelly crippling accident, suffered three years ago, is worthy of a more substantial token of respect than it‚Äîand she‚Äîreceives in &quot;The Sign of the Ram&quot;, a Columbia picture which came to Loew&#x27;s State yesterday. And the talents of several other actors of competence who are with her in this film are deserving of fuller protection against embarrassment than any of them get.&quot; In light of her divorce and facing a lack of opportunity as an actress, Peters began having chronic depression at this time.

In 1949, she was cast as Laura in a touring stage production of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; (reportedly with blessings from Tennessee Williams) which had its debut June 27, 1949, in Norwich, Connecticut. The play was slightly altered under Williams&#x27;s supervision in order for Peters to be allowed to perform the part in a wheelchair. She received a standing ovation during the play&#x27;s opening night, and the production toured throughout the East Coast. The following year, in 1950, she was cast in a stage production of Rudolph Besier&#x27;s &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, playing the disabled poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, which earned her positive critical reception among press.

In March 1951, Peters signed onto the live NBC-TV television drama &quot;Miss Susan&quot;, in which she played an attorney who used a wheelchair. Peters shot the series live five days per week in Philadelphia from March 12 to December 28, 1951, after which it was canceled when her health began to decline.

===19511952: Health problems and death===
After the cancellation of &quot;Miss Susan&quot;, Peters began a relationship with Robert Clark, a U.S. Army colonel, and the two announced their engagement to be married; however, Clark broke off the engagement, which sent Peters into a deeper depression. She relocated to Lemon Cove, California, to live on her brother&#x27;s cattle ranch, and her health began to steadily decline. In mid-1952, Peters was admitted to a hospital in Exeter, California, to undergo a skin graft procedure, after which she returned to her brother&#x27;s home and lived in seclusion. She had plans to resume another touring stage production of &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; the following year, but her strength had dwindled and she struggled to put on weight.

In August 1952, Peters told her physician, Dr. Manchester: &quot;I&#x27;m getting awfully tired. I think it possibly would be better if I did die.&quot; Over the following two months, she began starving herself. Peters died on October 23, 1952, at Memorial Hospital in Visalia, California, at the age of 31. Her doctor attributed her death to a chronic kidney infection, a complication caused by her paralysis, and bronchial pneumonia. He also noted that her death was hastened by self-induced dehydration and starvation because, in the last few weeks of her life, Peters had &quot;lost interest&quot; in eating and drinking and had &quot;lost the will to live&quot;.

Peters&#x27; funeral was held on October 27 in Glendale, California, after which she was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park next to her mother. At the time of her death, Peters&#x27; son Timothy was living with her ex-husband. Her estate was worth $6,000 ().

==Legacy==
Much of the public assessment and discussion of Peters has hinged on her paralysis and its impact on her life and career: Media historian Hal Erickson considered Peters &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s most promising young actresses&quot; of the 1940s, who &quot;courageously attempted a comeback&quot; despite her health problems. Film scholar Gene Blottner similarly praised Peters as a &quot;brilliant actress,&quot; as did John Charles of Turner Classic Movies, who deemed her paralysis &quot;one of the worst tragedies to affect the Hollywood acting community during the 1940s.&quot; For her contribution to motion pictures, Peters was posthumously awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1601 Vine Street.

<doc id="593872" wikidata="Q5586031" url="?curid=593872" title="Gordon railway station, Sydney">
<text>Gordon railway station is a heritage-listed suburban railway station located on the North Shore line, serving the Sydney suburb of Gordon. It is served by Sydney Trains T1 North Shore line and T9 Northern line services. Situated on St Johns Avenue, the station was designed and built by the New South Wales Department of Railways in 1909. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

==History==
In 1887, tenders were called for construction of a branch line extending south from Hornsby to the North Shore. The section between Hornsby and St Leonards was opened on 1 January 1890. Stations provided at the opening of the line included Chatswood and St Leonards. A single line was constructed at the time. The line between St Leonards and Milson&#x27;s Point (the terminus at the edge of the harbour) was completed 1 May 1893.

Gordon railway station was opened on 1 January 1890. In 1909 the single line was duplicated between Hornsby and St. Leonard&#x27;s. At Gordon, during the duplication the original single platform and station building were replaced by a new island platform with a standard brick island-platform style station building. The island platform served the Up North Shore line and the Down North Shore line. A third platform was built at Gordon (the Local Platform) adjacent to the Up line. This platform allowed for termination of local trains at Gordon. At the time of duplication, an overhead footbridge and booking office was built which allowed local residents to cross from one side of Gordon to the other and allowed access to the platforms via sets of steps.

A goods siding (adjacent to the Down line), crossovers and a signal box on the platform (part of the station building) completed the track arrangement.

Originally southbound services used Platform 1 with Platform 2 a terminal road with a buffer stop at the northern end. In the early 1990s, the station was reconfigured with Platform 2 becoming the main southbound platform and Platform 1 the terminal road. Timetable changes in the late 2010s meant that southbound services began reusing Platform 1, with Platform 2 returning to a terminal road again.

Since the 1990s, a number of car parks have been built. In 2014, the bus stop on the station&#x27;s western side was demolished to make way for a three-storey carpark and bus interchange. The new interchange opened in early June 2015.

The station was upgraded with the provision of lifts in 2005.

== Description ==
===Buildings and structures===
The buildings comprise a station building, including a signal box, and platforms 2/3, completed ; an overhead booking office, completed ; and station building and platform 1, completed in 1993.

Other structures include a footbridge, completed in 1909; platforms, completed in 1909; and modern steel shelters.

===Context===
Gordon Railway Station is located east of the Pacific Highway at Gordon. The station includes three platforms; an early 20th century overhead walkway and booking office with modern lift towers on the northern side; an early 20th century station building on an island platform; a reconstructed late 19th century timber waiting room; and an easement approximately 10m wide on either side of the railway tracks, which has been landscaped. The station is accessed via modern stairs and disabled ramp from either side of the station. There is a commercial strip on the western side of the Pacific Highway immediately across the road from the station.

===Station building ()===
Exterior: Located on the island platform (Platform 2/3) the station building is a good representative example of the standard railway design A8-A10 station buildings along the Northern line. Walls are red face brick, tuck pointed with moulded rendered string course, architraves and window sills. The gabled roof is modern corrugated steel, and the ends are timber boarded. The lower pitched awnings over the platform are supported on cast iron awning brackets springing from moulded rendered corbels. One face brick chimney with rendered top is sited along the ridge line. At the northern end of the building is located a brick signal box with encircling sliding 6-paned windows on three sides under the main roof line. The exterior of the station is largely in original condition, with no additional openings or infilled elements.

Interior: The interior of the Platform 2/3 station building contains a high degree of original fabric and layout. Original internal details include mini-orb ceiling, ceiling roses, plastered wall finishes with moulded dado, and door and window joinery including 16-paned coloured glass sashes. The floor has been replaced with concrete, and modern fluorescent lighting installed. The interior of the signal box is painted brick to window sill height and timber boarded above the windows, with a mini orb ceiling and timber floor. Fittings include the 28 lever frame, key box, 1927 Indicator board, 1969 indicator board, original timber desk and bells.

===Overhead booking office===
Exterior: The timber framed and weatherboard clad booking office was constructed in 1910 and located on the overhead platform. It has a gabled roof of modern corrugated iron steel with finials. The roof overhang and projecting gable on the southern side provides a sheltered area for ticket purchasing, and features timber boarded ceiling and rose. Two modern ticket windows have been inserted into original openings with decorative timber architraves remaining. Other modern ticket machines have been recessed into the building in new openings with profiled timber architraves. Two new steel and glass lifts are located on the north side of the building and overbridge. New access structures to these lifts have been constructed in a similar style and material to the original booking office, and feature coloured glass panels. The lift access structure on the eastern side includes two small commercial tenancies, only one of which is presently occupied.

Interior: Internally the original layout of the building appears to have been largely altered. Timber panelled wall linings appear original, although the battened plaster ceiling is not. Air-conditioning ducts and fluorescent lights are modern. Doors are timber panelled and windows are 4 or 6-paned sash, which all appear to be original.

===Station building (1993)===
A small timber-framed structure reconstructed in 1993 based on the design of the original 1890 waiting room. The structure is clad externally with timber weatherboards and has a skillion roof of corrugated steel. The structure is open with exposed framing, concrete floor and timber bench.

===Footbridge===
Dating from 1909 the footbridge has a steel haunched beam construction supported on steel trestles. The two bay structure spans two tracks on the eastern side and one track on the western side of the rail corridor. Markings of imported British steel manufacturers are visible, both Lanarkshire, and Dorman Long &amp; Co., Middlesbrough. The concourse has a concrete deck and modern steel balustrades. Modern concrete steps on steel supports provide access to the island platform. Similar steps and disabled ramp provide access to the streets on either side of the station.

===Platforms===
The island platform (Platform 2/3) at Gordon was built in 1909 as part of the line duplication for the Northern line, and has brick faces and an asphalt platform surface. The overhead booking office and footbridge are located approximately at the halfway point of the platform, with the station building located at the southern end. Platform 1 also has brick faces and an asphalt surface and is likely to date from the same period.

===Modern steel structures===
As part of the upgrading of the station in which lifts were installed, steel framed shelters were installed at the northern end of both platforms.

===Landscape===
Both the eastern and western lengths of the rail corridor are landscaped with several mature trees and shrubs including poplars, jasmine, jacaranda, palms, agapanthus, camellias and lawned areas.

===Moveable items===
*1914‚Äì1918 Honour Roll (overhead platform)
*1927 and 1969 timber indicator boards still in use (overhead platform)
*Cast iron drinking fountain (Platform 2/3)

=== Condition ===

As at 26 October 2010, the overhead Booking Office was in good condition. Also in good condition were the two station buildings (Platform 2/3) and (Platform 1), the footbridge, the platforms, and the landscape. The modern steel shelters were assessed as being in very good condition.

The archaeological potential is considered low. The station group retains a high level of integrity, with sympathetic modern additions.

=== Modifications and dates ===
*1927: Electrification of the North Shore line between Milson&#x27;s Point and Hornsby was opened on 15 August 1927.
*1928: Full electric services were provided 15 July 1928, and included services at Gordon. With electrification came automatic signalling and most signal boxes were closed. However, Gordon Signal Box remained in service until recent years (as with other North Shore signal boxes including North Sydney, Chatswood, Lindfield) due to the need for local control of terminating trains. When the principal signal control centres were opened at Sydney and Hornsby, these local signal boxes were closed, including Gordon. With electrification of the North Shore line, a relatively small 1500 V DC substation was built adjacent to the down North Shore line at Gordon.
*1990s: The former Gordon substation was replaced by a modern DC substation on the opposite side of the line and the original substation building (brick) was demolished.
*n.d: Some relatively modern additions such as shelters / awnings have been provided on the island platform.

== Heritage listing ==
As at 26 October 2010, Gordon Railway Station Group is significant at a state level as an excellent representative example of an early 20th century suburban station building group located on the North Shore line, which retains a high degree of integrity and quality in its architectural detail. The station group demonstrates the importance of the role of the railway in opening up the areas of the northern suburbs of Sydney for settlement at this time. It is able to evoke an earlier era of rail travel through its grouping of the original Platform 2/3 station building, platforms and booking office, along with sympathetic later additions.

The station contributes to the cohesive character of the North Shore line, characterised by its early 20th century railway architecture, generally in landscaped settings, which demonstrates the rapid construction of this section of the rail network. Gordon station stands out in the North Shore group of stations, due to its overhead booking office, which is an unusual feature in this region.

Gordon railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Gordon Railway Station is historically significant at a state level. Opened in 1890, Gordon Station was one of the first stations along the North Shore line, and demonstrates the role of the railway in facilitating the rapid subdivision and development of the northern suburbs of Sydney. The elements that contribute to this significance include the 1909-1910 station building, booking office, overhead walkway, and platforms.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

As a complex, Gordon Railway Station is of state aesthetic significance as a fine example of an early 20th Century railway station along the North Shore line, which retains a high degree of integrity and quality of detail. The elaborate nature of its architectural detail is perhaps indicative of the importance of Gordon Railway Station as an early intermediate terminus along the North Shore line. This station building contributes to the cohesive group of 20th century railway architecture which is characteristic of the northern section of the rail network, and demonstrates the rapid historical construction of the North Shore line. The reconstructed waiting room contributes to the general early 20th century character of the Gordon Railway Station, and is a physical record of one of the earliest structures at the station, although in itself it has little heritage value.

The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

Gordon Railway Station has social significance as evidenced by the community involvement during the design and construction of the new lifts and access arrangements. Local historical societies are also known to include the station complex in historical tours of the local area, thereby demonstrating the high esteem held by particular members of the community for the Gordon Railway Station.

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The location of the booking office on the overbridge is rare along the North Shore line, which is perhaps indicative of the importance of Gordon Railway Station as an early terminus along this line.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

Gordon Railway Station is of representative significance at a state level as an early 20th century railway station complex. Elements that contribute to this significance include the 1909 station building, overbridge and platforms. The footbridge is a good representative example of such structures, of which 28 were constructed in Metropolitan Sydney, with a number still remain within the metro network. The brick station building on the island platform is a good and intact representative example of early 20th century station building constructed along the North Shore line.
