<text>The Bentley Continental GT is a grand touring car manufactured and marketed by the British company Bentley Motors since 2003. A two-door coupé or convertible, and has four seats, it was the first new Bentley released after the company&#x27;s acquisition by Volkswagen AG in 1998, and the first Bentley to employ mass production manufacturing techniques. It was later joined by the Bentley Continental Flying Spur, a four-door saloon car variant.

==Origin==
In 1994, Rolls-Royce Motors who at that time owned the Bentley brand, previewed a convertible concept car at the Geneva Motor Show – the Concept Java. The car was designed to be a smaller, more affordable Bentley, yet still exclusive in order to maintain the integrity of the brand. It was to appeal to a new range of potential buyers and generate increase sales volume for Rolls-Royce. At the time the current Bentley Continental R was an ultra-exclusive £180,000 in the UK, within reach of a very select market, selling only 200–300 units a year. The Concept Java never went into production in the form seen in 1994, although 13 cars were made for the Sultan of Brunei. However, the Bentley Continental GT realised the concept of the Java as a more affordable Bentley, manufactured in much larger volumes.

==First generation (2003–2011)==

The vehicle debuted in 2002 at the Paris Motor Show, followed by Le Mans, the 2003 Goodwood Festival of Speed and the 2003 annual Bentley Drivers Club meeting at Silverstone. The car differed from the previous Continental R &amp; T models in terms of its concept: although much of the car is hand assembled, it is a mass-produced car made in significantly larger numbers. It is not a coach-built car. The price at launch was less than half the price of the Continental R, giving the car a wider customer base.

The Continental GT is equipped with a 6.0 litre twin-turbocharged W12 engine, which produces a DIN-rated power output of at 6,100 rpm, and torque of at 1,600–6,100 rpm. A Torsen-based permanent four-wheel drive is standard. It can accelerate from in 4.8 seconds, and go on to reach a top speed of .

Early models include a choice of 6 body colours (Diamond Black, Burnt Oak, Cypress, Neptune, Spruce, and Umbrian Red), 8 hide colours (Beluga, Burnt Oak, Laurel, Nautic, Portland, Saffron, Savannah, Saddle), 5 veneer types (Burr Oak, Burr Walnut, Dark Stained Walnut, Madrona, Piano Black) and 4 carpet and seatbelt colours (Beluga, Burnt Oak, Laurel, Nautic). The dashboard clock was made by Swiss luxury watchmaker Breitling.

<text>The Ferrari 360 (Type F131) is a two-seater, mid-engine, rear wheel drive sports car manufactured by Italian automotive manufacturer Ferrari from 1999 until 2004. It succeeded the Ferrari F355 and was replaced by the Ferrari F430 in 2004.

== Development history ==
Ferrari partnered with Alcoa to produce an entirely new all-aluminum space-frame chassis that was 40% stiffer than its predecessor&#x27;s which had utilized steel. The design was 28% lighter despite a 10% increase in overall dimensions. Along with a lightweight frame the new Pininfarina body styling deviated from traditions of the previous decade&#x27;s sharp angles and flip-up headlights. The V8 engine has a 3.6-litre capacity, a flat-plane crankshaft, and titanium connecting rods. The engine generates a power output of . According to Ferrari, weight was reduced by and the 0 to acceleration time improved from 4.7 to 4.5 seconds. 

The first model to be produced was the 360 Modena, followed later by the 360 Spider and a special edition, the Challenge Stradale. The Challenge Stradale was the high-performance road-legal version of the 360 produced by the factory, featuring carbon ceramic brakes (from the Enzo), track-tuned suspension, aerodynamic gains, weight reduction, power improvements and revised gearbox software among its track-focused brief. There were 8,800 Modenas and 7,565 Spiders produced worldwide. There were 4,199 built for the US market—1,810 Modenas (coupes) and 2,389 Spiders (convertibles). Of those numbers, there were only 469 Modenas and 670 Spiders that were produced with a gated 6-speed manual transmission as opposed to the &quot;F1&quot; single-clutch automated manual transmission.

In addition to this were the low-volume factory race cars and a one-off Barchetta variant. The race cars were all derived from the 360 Modena and for the first time produced as a separate model in their own right (compared to being a retrofit kit in previous years). While the Barchetta was based on the Spider variant. The first race car was the 360 Modena Challenge, used in a one-make series; the factory-built racing cars were prepared by the official tuner, , who also developed the 360 N-GT. The N-GT was a 360 Challenge car evolved even further to compete in the FIA N-GT racing class alongside other marques such as Porsche.

==Road models==

===Modena===
The first model of the 360 to be produced was the Modena, named after the town of Modena, the birthplace of Enzo Ferrari. Transmission options were a 6-speed manual transmission, or the electrohydraulic-actuated &quot;F1&quot; automated manual transmission with a gearbox built by Graziano Trasmissioni. 

The 360 Modena went into production in 1999 and remained in production until 2005 when it was replaced by the F430. The Modena was followed two years later by the 360 Spider, Ferrari&#x27;s 20th road-going convertible which at launch overtook sales of the Modena. Other than weight, the Spider&#x27;s specifications matched those of the Modena almost exactly.

===Spider===
The Ferrari 360 Spider was unveiled at the 2000 Geneva Motor Show.

The 360 was designed with a convertible variant in mind; since removing the roof of a coupe reduces the torsional rigidity, the 360 was built for strength in other areas. Ferrari designers strengthened the sills, stiffened the front of the floorpan and redesigned the windscreen frame. The rear bulkhead had to be stiffened to cut out engine noise from the cabin. The convertible&#x27;s necessary dynamic rigidity is provided by additional side reinforcements and a cross brace in front of the engine. Passenger safety is ensured by a strengthened windscreen frame and roll bars.

The 360 Spider displays a curvilinear waistline. The fairings imply the start of a roof, and stable roll bars are embedded in these elevations. Due to use of light aluminium construction throughout, the Spider weighs in only heavier than the coupé.

As with the Modena version, its V8 generating a power output of is on display under a glass engine cover. The engine — confined in space by the convertible&#x27;s top&#x27;s storage area — acquires additional air supply through especially large side air intakes. The intake manifolds were moved towards the centre of the engine between the air supply conduits in the Spider&#x27;s engine compartment, as opposed to lying apart as with the Modena. In terms of performance, the 0- acceleration time was slightly slower due to the slight weight increase, and the top speed was reduced.

Despite the car&#x27;s mid-mounted V8 engine, the electrically operated top is able to stow into the compartment when not in use. The convertible top was available in black, blue, grey and beige colours.

===Barchetta===
The Ferrari 360 Barchetta (serial number 120020) is a one-off based on the Ferrari 360 Spider which was commissioned by Gianni Agnelli in 2000 as a wedding present for the then Fiat chairman and president of Ferrari, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo. The car bears heavy resemblance to its donor with the only differences being the removal of the soft top system and roll bars, different engine cover and the addition of a visor in place of a windshield for better airflow over the car. Performance of the car remains the same as its donor and the car features Argento Nurburgring exterior paint with red pinstriping. The interior is black leather with cream fabric and features fabric seats with matching stitching, the words 360 Barchetta embroidered on the dashboard and a paddle-shift gearbox.

===Challenge Stradale===
Inspired by the 360 Modena Challenge racing car series, the Challenge Stradale is the track-focused iteration of the 360 Modena which followed on in concept from the track focused F355 &quot;Fiorano&quot;, which featured the &quot;Fiorano Handling Pack&quot; introduced in the final year of the Ferrari F355. The focus in development of the car was primarily on improving its track performance credentials by concentrating on handling, braking and weight reduction characteristics, which are essential in pure racing cars. Ferrari engineers designed the car from the outset with a goal of 20% track day use in mind and 80% road use. With only a small improvement in engine power from the Modena (and boasting an improved power-to-weight ratio), the Challenge Stradale accelerates from 0 to in 4.1 seconds according to Ferrari. Systematic improvements were achieved to the setup and feel of the whole car; throttle response from the digital throttle was ratcheted up and feedback through the steering wheel was enhanced. Ceramic brakes borrowed from the Enzo, some lower weight parts and a FHP handling pack, enabled the Challenge Stradale to claim a 3.5 second improvement per lap of its Fiorano Circuit compared to the Modena.

In total, the Challenge Stradale is up to lighter than the standard Modena if all the lightweight options are specified such as deleted radio, lexan (plexiglass) door windows and Alcantara fabric (instead of the leather option). As much as was saved by lightening the bumpers, stripping the interior of its sound deadening and carbon mirrors and making the optional Modena carbon seats standard. Resin Transfer Moulding was utilised for the bumpers and skirts, a carry over from the Challenge cars which resulted in lighter bumpers than those on the Modena. The engine and transmission weight was lightened by through the use of a smaller, lighter weight sports exhaust back box and valved exit pipes. The Challenge Stradale also got Brembo carbon ceramic brakes as standard (which later became standard fitment on the F430) which shaved off the curb weight and improved handling by reducing unsprung weight and completely eliminating brake fade, as well as lightweight wheels specially made by BBS. Cars fitted with the centre console stereo option, sub speaker box behind the seats and glass side windows re-gained approximately over the best selected options.

==Race models==

===360 Challenge===

Based on the 360 Modena road car, the 360 Challenge was an extensively reworked, track-oriented model intended to compete in Ferrari&#x27;s one-make racing series called the Ferrari Challenge.
It was only available with the electrohydraulic-actuated automated manual transmission. At the time of launch, Ferrari claimed the 360 Challenge accelerated from 0 to in 3.9 seconds (0.6 seconds quicker than the standard 360 Modena F1) and could corner and brake significantly faster than the road car due to added aerodynamic elements. Brembo racing provided the upgraded Gold coloured calipers and larger floating 2-piece discs, while Bosch provided the race-oriented ABS software. The exhaust system was lightened substantially and was one of the main contributions to the increased power output over the standard engine (as ignition mapping was claimed to virtually be the same). For the road cars (even the Challenge Stradale) Ferrari used a valve system that made the car more socially acceptable at lower revs (and therefore able to pass drive-by noise tests).

Less than 200 were made and marketed by Ferrari as a pure race car, requiring purchasers to enter their Ferrari 360 Challenge into the Ferrari Challenge race series as a condition of sale.

Unlike the previous Challenge race series, which utilised an F355 road car with a dealer-installed &#x27;challenge upgrade&#x27; kit, the 360 Challenge was a factory-built track car. The enhanced driving characteristics and substantial weight reduction meant the car could comfortably outperform its road-going counterpart even though power from the 3.6-litre engine was claimed to be similar.

The 360 Challenge featured a stripped-down race-oriented interior with the stereo, electric windows and locks, soundproofing, airbags, air-conditioning, and even the handbrake removed. The seats and restraints were replaced by a single carbon-fibre racing seat and FIA approved restraint harnesses, and a roll cage was fitted for safety along with a fire suppression system. The instrument cluster was reworked with a monochrome LCD to display vital engine data. The adaptive suspension of the road car was replaced by adjustable racing dampers, while larger brakes with extra cooling ducts were added.

====Official performance figures====

===360 N-GT===
The Ferrari 360 N-GT was a 360 Challenge race car tuned by Michelotto for the N-GT category of the FIA GT Championship. It was the fastest version of the Ferrari 360 with the engine generating a power output of over when derestricted. The 360 N-GT was capable of a top speed of around with a 0– acceleration time of around 3 seconds. It was the final car built through a Ferrari-Michelotto collaboration. The most recent major victory achieved by a 360 Michelotto was by SB Race Engineering at the 2011 Britcar Championship, where the 360 N-GT, as on many occasions, outperformed the newer F430 GT.

In 2002, a 360 N-GT was driven in the Australian Nations Cup Championship for GT style cars. Run by Prancing Horse Racing to replace the teams 360 Challenge and driven by highly successful Australian race driver John Bowe, the car would eventually place 3rd in the 2002 championship. Bowe and Steve Beards then finished 3rd in the N-GT at the 2002 Sandown 500. Their team mates for the race, Brad Jones and PHR Scuderia&#x27;s Indonesian millionaire team owner Maher Algadrie, failed to finish after only completing 88 laps in their N-GT Ferrari. During the dry/wet Top 10 Runoff for pole position, Bowe and Jones unfortunately got caught in the wet part leaving them only 4th and 5th on the grid, ironically behind the 360 Challenge class G2 car of their 3rd placed team mate Paul Morris who had somewhat better weather conditions for his lap, and part-time driver Sam Newman who got the only dry lap in the runoff and put his PHR Scuderia 360 Challenge on pole by some 6.0448 seconds.

PHR then entered the Ferrari in the 2002 Bathurst 24 Hour race at the famous Mount Panorama Circuit, where Brad Jones put the 360 N-GT on pole position. After running in 2nd place behind the 7.0-litre Holden Monaro 427C which would go on to win the race outright, the 360 N-GT lost its oil pressure shortly after taking the lead when the Monaro had to pit to replace a flat front tyre. PHR then did an engine change in just 3 hours, only to have the replacement engine also lose oil pressure with Paul Morris in the car just under 3 hours later ending their race just before midnight. Bowe then finished 2nd in the 2003 Nations Cup Championship before the car was raced one last time in the 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour, where it was run by Austrian-based team BE Racing. Driven by David Brabham, Andrea Montermini, Klaus Engelhorn and Philipp Peter, the Ferrari qualified in 7th place and after running 3rd for a number of hours behind the Holden Monaros, was retired on lap 287.

===360 GT===

The Ferrari 360 GT is a race version of the 360 Modena developed by the &quot;Ferrari Corse Clienti&quot; department in Maranello, in collaboration with Michelotto Automobili to compete in the FIA N-GT class.
Team JMB Giesse raced the cars during the 2001 FIA GT Championship season and won the N-GT Cup for Drivers and the N-GT Cup for Teams.

From 2002 to 2004, Ferrari produced and sold 20 360 GTs to customers through their Corse Clienti department.

The 3.6-litre V8 engine was tuned to generate a power output of which was a significant improvement over the 360 Challenge cars.

Significant additional weight reduction efforts were taken over the regular 360 Challenge cars such as lightening the wiring loom (saving 7 kg alone) as well as removing all unnecessary weight like air-conditioning brackets and doors which were now made from one-piece of carbon fibre along with the front compartment lid.

The Final results of all the weight reduction in the 360 GT&#x27;s kerb weight was over the 360 Challenge cars (1,070 kg or 2,354 lbs). Ballast was used to bring the car back up to the regulation limit of .

===360 GTC===

The Ferrari 360 GTC has been developed to replace the previous 360 GT. With a kerb weight of (with ballast), it was built since 2004 by Ferrari Corse Clienti department in collaboration with Michelotto Automobili to compete in the N-GT class. It made use of recent evolutions successfully race tested on the Ferrari 360 GT, with a sequential six-speed gearbox and a further improved Magneti Marelli electronics package. The aerodynamics are substantially different from the 360 GT, given that the 360 GTC had been newly homologated by FIA/ACO from the Challenge Stradale, taking up from its basic elements: front bumper, side skirts, engine cover and double rear end. Wind tunnel research has led to a new system for the rear wing, with a notable improvement in vertical downforce. The performance of the 90-degree V8 engine has been improved in terms of fuel consumption.

In 2009, a privately owned Veloqx-Prodrive Racing 360 raced de-restricted, fully tuned variations of the GT-C in endurance races around the world including Silverstone, Sebring and Le-Mans.

The original 360GT&#x27;s power output was at 8,750 rpm, the GTC bettered that raising peak power to while still breathing through the mandatory air restrictors.

== Reviews ==
Chris Harris reported that the 360 Modena press car was &quot;ludicrously quick&quot; (two seconds faster to than the customer car they tested) and sounded more like a racing car than a street car, but the other cars were different. While performance claims for the 360 were equal to or higher than the previous model, when &quot;Car and Driver&quot; tested a stock 360 it proved heavier and slower than its predecessor&#x27;s claimed performance from five years before, this however can likely be attributed to choice of options fitted to the test car. Also US federal requirements for crash protection added weight back in for US designated models.

<text>Daniel Thomas Barry (born December 30, 1953) is an American engineer, scientist, television personality, and a retired NASA astronaut. He was a contestant on the CBS reality television program &quot;&quot;, as well as on &quot;BattleBots&quot; on ABC. He was at Singularity University from 2009 to 2012, where he was co-chair of the Faculty of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics and the chair of the graduate summer program. He is also a co-founder of Fellow AI, a telepresence robotics company, and the founder and president of Denbar Robotics.

==Early life and education==
Barry is a 1971 graduate of Bolton High School in Alexandria, Louisiana. He is a member of the Theta Chi fraternity.

Barry graduated in 1975 with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. He graduated in 1980 with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science from Princeton University after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Correlated X-ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy of photoreceptor membranes&quot; In 1982, he graduated with a Doctor of Medicine degree from the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami in Miami.

==Career==
Following graduate school at Princeton University, Barry was a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow in physics at Princeton. He then attended the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami, where he graduated in 1982. He completed an internship and a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation residency at the University of Michigan in 1985. He was appointed as an assistant professor in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and in the Bioengineering Program at the University of Michigan in 1985, and his tenure was approved by the Regents in 1992. He spent the summers of 1985–87 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, supported by the Grass Foundation for work in skeletal muscle physiology and as the Associate Director of the Grass Foundation Fellowship Program (1986–87). His research primarily involves biological signal processing, including signal processing theory, algorithms, and applications to specific biological systems. The applications include acoustic signals generated by contracting skeletal muscle, electrical signals from muscle, and heart sounds. He has also worked in prosthetic design. Barry&#x27;s work has been supported by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Grass Foundation, and the American Heart Association of Michigan. He has five patents, over 50 articles in scientific journals, and has served on two scientific journal editorial boards.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in March 1992, Barry reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He completed one year of training and qualified for assignment as a mission specialist on Space Shuttle flight crews. Dr. Barry has worked on primary payload development, the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), portable computing issues for Space Shuttle, Chief of Astronaut Appearances, flight clinic ombudsman, source board member for the NASA Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI), Astronaut Office representative to NASDA, the Japanese Space Agency, and a tour of duty with the Office of Biological &amp; Physical Research, NASA Headquarters, Washington D.C. A veteran of three space flights, STS-72 (1996), STS-96 (1999), and STS-105 (2001), Barry logged over 734 hours in space, including 4 spacewalks totaling 25 hours and 53 minutes. He retired from NASA in April 2005 whereupon he started Denbar Robotics and continues to serve as president.

==Spaceflight experience==

STS-72 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (January 11–20, 1996) was a 9-day flight during which the crew retrieved the Space Flyer Unit (launched from Japan 10-months earlier) and deployed and retrieved the OAST-Flyer. Barry performed a 6-hour, 9 minute spacewalk designed to demonstrate and evaluate techniques to be used in the assembly of the International Space Station. Mission duration was 142 Earth orbits, traveling 3.7 million miles in 214 hours and 41 seconds. On this mission, Barry and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata were the first people to play Go in space; for this achievement, Barry received the honorary award of Ni Dan rank by the Nihon Kiin making him one of only four Western Go players to receive such an award. Barry and Wakata used a special Go set, which was named Go Space, designed by Wai-Cheung Willson Chow.

STS-96 &quot;Discovery&quot; (May 27 to June 6, 1999) was the first mission to dock with the International Space Station. It was a ten-day mission during which the crew delivered four tons of logistics and supplies in preparation for the arrival of the first crew to live on the station. The mission was accomplished in 153 Earth orbits, traveling 4 million miles in 235 hours and 13 minutes. Barry performed a spacewalk for 7 hours and 55 minutes.
STS-105 &quot;Discovery&quot; (Aug 10–22, 2001) was the eleventh mission to the International Space Station. While at the orbital outpost, the STS-105 crew delivered the Expedition 3 crew, attached the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, and transferred over 2.7 metric tons of supplies and equipment to the station. Barry and Patrick G. Forrester performed two spacewalks totaling 11 hours and 45 minutes of EVA time. STS-105 also brought home the Expedition 2 crew. The STS-105 mission was accomplished in 186 orbits of the Earth, traveling over 4.9 million miles in 285 hours and 13 minutes.

==Post-NASA career==
===&quot;Survivor&quot;===

In 2006, Barry was a contestant on &quot;&quot;, the 12th season of the reality competition series &quot;Survivor&quot;. He started in the older male tribe and immediately bonded with Terry Deitz due to their common flying backgrounds. When the four tribes were reduced to two, Barry and Deitz made an all-male alliance with Austin Carty and Nick Stanbury from the younger tribe. Barry also bonded with Ruth-Marie Milliman, which led to her being blindsided when she was voted out in Episode Four. He reconciled with his alliance-mates and finally revealed to Stanbury his background as an astronaut in Episode Six. When the Casaya tribe won the combined Reward/Immunity Challenge in that episode and sent Sally Schumann to Exile Island (making her immune from the Tribal Council vote), Barry&#x27;s fate was sealed. Carty and Stanbury were allied, so when Deitz voted against him, Barry was voted out 3–1.

===&quot;Battlebots&quot;===
Barry competed on the televised robot combat tournament &quot;Battlebots&quot; revival series on ABC, with his combat robot &quot;Black Ice&quot;, a shooter pusher wedge bot. He premiered in 2016 with robot combat partner Dr. Dan Parrish in the tournament.

==Personal life==
Barry is married to neurobiologist and author Susan R. Barry. They have two children, who both work in robotics.

<doc id="596622" wikidata="Q1477053" url="?curid=596622" title="Arzelà–Ascoli theorem">
<text>The Arzelà–Ascoli theorem is a fundamental result of mathematical analysis giving necessary and sufficient conditions to decide whether every sequence of a given family of real-valued continuous functions defined on a closed and bounded interval has a uniformly convergent subsequence. The main condition is the equicontinuity of the family of functions. The theorem is the basis of many proofs in mathematics, including that of the Peano existence theorem in the theory of ordinary differential equations, Montel&#x27;s theorem in complex analysis, and the Peter–Weyl theorem in harmonic analysis and various results concerning compactness of integral operators.

The notion of equicontinuity was introduced in the late 19th century by the Italian mathematicians Cesare Arzelà and Giulio Ascoli. A weak form of the theorem was proven by , who established the sufficient condition for compactness, and by , who established the necessary condition and gave the first clear presentation of the result. A further generalization of the theorem was proven by , to sets of real-valued continuous functions with domain a compact metric space . Modern formulations of the theorem allow for the domain to be compact Hausdorff and for the range to be an arbitrary metric space. More general formulations of the theorem exist that give necessary and sufficient conditions for a family of functions from a compactly generated Hausdorff space into a uniform space to be compact in the compact-open topology; see .

==Statement and first consequences==
By definition, a sequence formula_1 of continuous functions on an interval is &quot;uniformly bounded&quot; if there is a number such that

:formula_2

for every function belonging to the sequence, and every . (Here, must be independent of and .)

The sequence is said to be &quot;uniformly equicontinuous&quot; if, for every , there exists a such that

:formula_3

whenever for all functions in the sequence. (Here, may depend on , but not , or .)

One version of the theorem can be stated as follows:

:Consider a sequence of real-valued continuous functions defined on a closed and bounded interval of the real line. If this sequence is uniformly bounded and uniformly equicontinuous, then there exists a subsequence that converges uniformly. 
:The converse is also true, in the sense that if every subsequence of itself has a uniformly convergent subsequence, then is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous.

===Immediate examples===

====Differentiable functions====
The hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied by a uniformly bounded sequence of differentiable functions with uniformly bounded derivatives. Indeed, uniform boundedness of the derivatives implies by the mean value theorem that for all and ,

:formula_4

where is the supremum of the derivatives of functions in the sequence and is independent of . So, given , let to verify the definition of equicontinuity of the sequence. This proves the following corollary:

* Let be a uniformly bounded sequence of real-valued differentiable functions on such that the derivatives are uniformly bounded. Then there exists a subsequence that converges uniformly on .

If, in addition, the sequence of second derivatives is also uniformly bounded, then the derivatives also converge uniformly (up to a subsequence), and so on. Another generalization holds for continuously differentiable functions. Suppose that the functions are continuously differentiable with derivatives . Suppose that are uniformly equicontinuous and uniformly bounded, and that the sequence is pointwise bounded (or just bounded at a single point). Then there is a subsequence of the converging uniformly to a continuously differentiable function.

The diagonalization argument can also be used to show that a family of infinitely differentiable functions, whose derivatives of each order are uniformly bounded, has a uniformly convergent subsequence, all of whose derivatives are also uniformly convergent. This is particularly important in the theory of distributions.

====Lipschitz and Hölder continuous functions====
The argument given above proves slightly more, specifically

* If is a uniformly bounded sequence of real valued functions on such that each &quot;fn&quot; is Lipschitz continuous with the same Lipschitz constant :

::formula_5

:for all and all , then there is a subsequence that converges uniformly on .

The limit function is also Lipschitz continuous with the same value for the Lipschitz constant. A slight refinement is

* A set of functions on that is uniformly bounded and satisfies a Hölder condition of order , , with a fixed constant ,

::formula_6

:is relatively compact in . In particular, the unit ball of the Hölder space is compact in .

This holds more generally for scalar functions on a compact metric space satisfying a Hölder condition with respect to the metric on .

==Generalizations==

===Euclidean spaces===
The Arzelà–Ascoli theorem holds, more generally, if the functions take values in -dimensional Euclidean space , and the proof is very simple: just apply the -valued version of the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem times to extract a subsequence that converges uniformly in the first coordinate, then a sub-subsequence that converges uniformly in the first two coordinates, and so on. The above examples generalize easily to the case of functions with values in Euclidean space.

=== Compact metric spaces and compact Hausdorff spaces ===
The definitions of boundedness and equicontinuity can be generalized to the setting of arbitrary compact metric spaces and, more generally still, compact Hausdorff spaces. Let &quot;X&quot; be a compact Hausdorff space, and let &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) be the space of real-valued continuous functions on &quot;X&quot;. A subset is said to be &quot;equicontinuous&quot; if for every &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; and every , &quot;x&quot; has a neighborhood &quot;Ux&quot; such that

:formula_7

A set is said to be &quot;pointwise bounded&quot; if for every &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;,

:formula_8

A version of the Theorem holds also in the space &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) of real-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space &quot;X&quot; :

:Let &quot;X&quot; be a compact Hausdorff space. Then a subset F of &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is relatively compact in the topology induced by the uniform norm if and only if it is equicontinuous and pointwise bounded.

The Arzelà–Ascoli theorem is thus a fundamental result in the study of the algebra of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space.

Various generalizations of the above quoted result are possible. For instance, the functions can assume values in a metric space or (Hausdorff) topological vector space with only minimal changes to the statement (see, for instance, , ):

:Let &quot;X&quot; be a compact Hausdorff space and &quot;Y&quot; a metric space. Then is compact in the compact-open topology if and only if it is equicontinuous, pointwise relatively compact and closed.

Here pointwise relatively compact means that for each &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;, the set is relatively compact in &quot;Y&quot;.

In the case that &quot;Y&quot; is complete, the proof given above can be generalized in a way that does not rely on the separability of the domain. On a compact Hausdorff space &quot;X&quot;, for instance, the equicontinuity is used to extract, for each ε = 1/&quot;n&quot;, a finite open covering of &quot;X&quot; such that the oscillation of any function in the family is less than ε on each open set in the cover. The role of the rationals can then be played by a set of points drawn from each open set in each of the countably many covers obtained in this way, and the main part of the proof proceeds exactly as above. A similar argument is used as a part of the proof for the general version which does not assume completeness of &quot;Y&quot;.

===Functions on non-compact spaces===
The Arzela-Ascoli theorem generalises to functions formula_9 where formula_10 is not compact. Particularly important are cases where formula_10 is a topological vector space. Recall that if formula_10
is a topological space and formula_13 is a uniform space (such as any metric space or any topological group, metrisable or not), there is the topology of compact convergence on the set formula_14 of functions formula_9; it is set up so that a sequence (or more generally a 
filter or net) of functions converges if and only if it converges &quot;uniformly&quot; on each compact subset of formula_10. Let formula_17 be the subspace of
formula_14 consisting of continuous functions, equipped with the topology of compact convergence.
Then one form of the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem is the following:

:Let formula_10 be a topological space, formula_13 a Hausdorff uniform space and formula_21 an equicontinuous set of continuous functions such that formula_22 is relatively compact in formula_13 for each formula_24. Then formula_25 is relatively compact in formula_17.

This theorem immediately gives the more specialised statements above in cases where formula_10 is compact
and the uniform structure of formula_13 is given by a metric. There are a few other variants in terms of
the topology of precompact convergence or other related topologies on 
formula_14. It is also possible to extend the statement to functions that are only continuous when restricted to the sets of a covering of formula_10 by compact subsets. For details one can consult Bourbaki (1998), Chapter X, § 2, nr 5.

===Non-continuous functions===
Solutions of numerical schemes for parabolic equations are usually piecewise constant, and therefore not continuous, in time. As their jumps nevertheless tend to become small as the time step goes to formula_31, it is possible to establish uniform-in-time convergence properties using a generalisation to non-continuous functions of the classical Arzelà–Ascoli theorem (see e.g. ).

Denote by formula_32 the space of functions from formula_10 to formula_13 endowed with the uniform metric

:formula_35

Then we have the following:

:Let formula_10 be a compact metric space and formula_13 a complete metric space. Let formula_38 be a sequence in formula_32 such that there exists a function formula_40 and a sequence formula_41 satisfying
::formula_42
::formula_43
:Assume also that, for all formula_44, formula_45 is relatively compact in formula_13. Then formula_38 is relatively compact in formula_32, and any limit of formula_38 in this space is in formula_50.

==Necessity==
Whereas most formulations of the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem assert sufficient conditions for a family of functions to be (relatively) compact in some topology, these conditions are typically also necessary. For instance, if a set F is compact in &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), the Banach space of real-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space with respect to its uniform norm, then it is bounded in the uniform norm on &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) and in particular is pointwise bounded. Let &quot;N&quot;(&quot;ε&quot;, &quot;U&quot;) be the set of all functions in F whose oscillation over an open subset &quot;U&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot; is less than &quot;ε&quot;:

:formula_51

For a fixed &quot;x&quot;∈&quot;X&quot; and &quot;ε&quot;, the sets &quot;N&quot;(&quot;ε&quot;, &quot;U&quot;) form an open covering of F as &quot;U&quot; varies over all open neighborhoods of &quot;x&quot;. Choosing a finite subcover then gives equicontinuity.

==Further examples==
* To every function that is -integrable on , with , associate the function defined on by

::formula_52

:Let be the set of functions corresponding to functions in the unit ball of the space . If is the Hölder conjugate of , defined by , then Hölder&#x27;s inequality implies that all functions in satisfy a Hölder condition with and constant .

:It follows that is compact in . This means that the correspondence defines a compact linear operator between the Banach spaces and . Composing with the injection of into , one sees that acts compactly from to itself. The case can be seen as a simple instance of the fact that the injection from the Sobolev space formula_53 into , for a bounded open set in , is compact.

*When is a compact linear operator from a Banach space to a Banach space , its transpose is compact from the (continuous) dual to . This can be checked by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem.

:Indeed, the image of the closed unit ball of is contained in a compact subset of . The unit ball of defines, by restricting from to , a set of (linear) continuous functions on that is bounded and equicontinuous. By Arzelà–Ascoli, for every sequence in , there is a subsequence that converges uniformly on , and this implies that the image formula_54 of that subsequence is Cauchy in .

*When is holomorphic in an open disk , with modulus bounded by , then (for example by Cauchy&#x27;s formula) its derivative has modulus bounded by in the smaller disk If a family of holomorphic functions on is bounded by on , it follows that the family of restrictions to is equicontinuous on . Therefore, a sequence converging uniformly on can be extracted. This is a first step in the direction of Montel&#x27;s theorem.
* Let formula_55 be endowed with the uniform metric formula_56 Assume that formula_57 is a sequence of solutions of a certain partial differential equation (PDE), where the PDE ensures the following a priori estimates: formula_58 is equicontinuous for all formula_59, formula_58 is equitight for all formula_59, and, for all formula_62 and all formula_63, formula_64 is small enough when formula_65 is small enough. Then by the Fréchet–Kolmogorov theorem, we can conclude that formula_66 is relatively compact in formula_67. Hence, we can, by (a generalization of) the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, conclude that formula_68 is relatively compact in formula_69

<text>The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;LR) was formed in 1847 when the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway joined with authorised but unbuilt railway companies, forming a proposed network from Manchester to Grimsby. It pursued a policy of expanding its area of influence, especially in reaching west to Liverpool, which it ultimately did through the medium of the Cheshire Lines Committee network in joint partnership with the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and the Midland Railway.

Its dominant traffic was minerals, chiefly coal, and the main market was in London and the south of England. It was dependent on other lines to convey traffic southward. The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) was an exceptionally hostile partner, and in later years the allied itself with the Great Northern Railway. Passenger traffic, especially around Manchester, was also an important business area, and well-patronised express trains to London were run in collaboration with the . Nevertheless, the was never greatly profitable.

For many years its general manager, and then chairman, was Edward Watkin, a dynamic leader who sometimes allowed personal vanity to drive his priorities. Watkin was determined that the should get its own route to London, and this became the scheme for the London Extension, a fearfully expensive project that risked alienating friendly companies. The London extension scheme changed the character of the completely and dominated its final years. In 1897 the company changed its name to &quot;The Great Central Railway&quot;, and it was under that company name that the London Extension was opened in 1899.

==Origin==
The Sheffield, Ashton under Lyne and Manchester Railway (SA&amp;MR) had opened throughout on 23 December 1845. Its line ran through the Woodhead Tunnel, a little over 3 miles in length. The line connected with the Manchester and Birmingham Railway at its western end, and had a basic terminus in Sheffield at Bridgehouses. There was a branch from Dinting to Glossop, and another from Guide Bridge to Stalybridge. The had been short of money during construction, and the Woodhead Tunnel was built as a single track to save money.

As the Railway Mania took hold, it became evident that enlargement of the network dominated by a railway company was key to competitive survival, and in 1846 the had been authorised, by the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. cclxviii) of 27 July 1846, to amalgamate with three as-yet unbuilt railways: they were:

* The Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway had been authorised by the Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. l) of 30 June 1845 to build from Gainsborough to Grimsby. At Gainsborough it was to connect with the proposed Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway, and this justified the word &quot;Sheffield&quot; in its title. A further act of Parliament, the Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway (Lincoln Extension) Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. xcix) of 26 June 1846 authorised a branch from Wrawby South Junction at Barnetby down to Lincoln, and an extension from there to Newark, on the Great Northern Railway; and in addition a branch to Barton-on-Humber from Brocklesby and a branch to Cleethorpes from Grimsby.
* The Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway was authorised by the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. ccciv) of 3 August 1846 to build from Sheffield to Gainsborough.
* The was also authorised by the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. cccxix) on 3 August 1846, connect with the at Clarborough Junction, east of Retford, and to run south-east to Sykes Junction, north of Lincoln, where it joined the Great Northern Railway and ran by running powers into Lincoln.

The amalgamation took effect on 1 January 1847, and the combined company was named the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. It had headquarters at Manchester London Road station. The first board meeting of the amalgamated company took place on 6 January 1847.

==Canals==
As well as the railway interest, the new acquired a considerable canal network. The Sheffield, Ashton under Lyne and Manchester Railway had acquired three canals in March 1846; they were 
* the Ashton Canal (connecting Manchester, Ashton, Stalybridge and Stockport);
* the Peak Forest Canal, which ran from Ashton to Whaley Bridge, and which had a plateway extension to Dove Holes; and
* the Macclesfield Canal, which left the Peak Forest Canal at Marple and had a long southward main line through Macclesfield and Congleton to join the Trent and Mersey Canal.

These canals cost the company £33,608 annually in guaranteed payments to the original proprietors.

The Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway had already purchased the Sheffield Canal and it was vested in the on 22 July 1848 by the Sheffield Canal Purchase Act 1848 (11 &amp; 12 Vict. c. xciv), and the acquired the Chesterfield Canal on 9 July 1847.

==First years 1847–1849==



In 1847 the railway network of the consisted of nothing more than the network of the , with one small addition. On the first day of 1847 a short spur connection was opened from the Sheffield terminal to the Sheffield station of the Midland Railway (former Sheffield and Rotherham Railway). At this time the Midland approached from the Rotherham direction only, and it had a terminal station adjacent to Wicker, and named after that thoroughfare. The short connecting link was steeply graded and almost entirely in tunnel; it was only used for wagon exchange purposes.

Having now taken over three large railway schemes that were authorised but not yet started, the had to let large contracts for construction. In February 1847 nearly half a million pounds worth of work was commissioned; the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway main line from Woodhouse (near Sheffield) to Gainsborough, the Grimsby line to Market Rasen, and a second bore of the Woodhead Tunnel. The eastward construction from the Bridgehouses terminus across Sheffield was started in May 1847.

The soon ran short of money, and a loan of £250,000 had to be negotiated; deliveries of locomotives were slowed, as were certain infrastructure improvements; the stations at Dog Lane, Hazlehead, Oxspring and Thurgoland were closed to passenger traffic as from 1 November 1847. One new station was provided, at Dinting, at the Glossop branch junction. The original Dinting station was closed after an interval. In its first year of operation, the had paid a 5% dividend on ordinary stock. This fell to % for the first half of 1848, since when there were no further payments for six years.

Progress continued on building the line between Grimsby and New Holland. The Grimsby-Louth line of the East Lincolnshire Railway (now leased to the Great Northern Railway) was nearing completion too, and both lines opened on 1 March 1848. There was a through train service between New Holland and Louth, operated equally by both companies. A pier in length had been provided at New Holland, which was the terminal of a ferry service to Hull. It was promised that &quot;the rails of the New Holland line will be continued to the extremity of the pier&quot;.

Next opening was from a junction at Ulceby (about halfway between New Holland and Grimsby) to Brigg, and a second arm of that line to Market Rasen. These sections opened on 1 November 1848.

Notwithstanding the difficult financial conditions, the network as originally planned was completed during 1849, except for the new station at Sheffield (still under construction), the Leverton branch (as the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Extension Railway was now called) and certain dock works at Grimsby. There was an impressive succession of openings: the Barnetby-Lincoln line was opened on 1 February 1849, and the section from Sheffield to Beighton, where a junction was made with the Midland Railway, was opened on 12 February 1849. passenger trains ran through to Eckington on the Midland Railway from Beighton. A triangular junction was formed at New Holland, leading to a branch to Barton on Humber, opened on 1 March 1849. On 2 April 1849 the section between Brigg and Gainsborough was opened. There was a triangular junction at Ulceby: the eastern side of the triangle had been in use since before July 1848.

The final link, from Woodhouse junction, on the Sheffield-Beighton junction section, to Gainsborough, was formally opened on 16 July 1849. A special train conveying the Directors ran from Liverpool to Grimsby in five hours. The line was opened to the public the following day, 17 July 1849.

There were two stations at Stalybridge: the former station and one belonging to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR). The companies agreed to rationalise, with the station handling all passenger business, and the all the goods business. The necessary junctions between the two routes at Stalybridge were ready on 1 July 1849, and on 1 August two new junctions with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) were brought into use as well, end-on at Stalybridge with the new line from Huddersfield, and at Guide Bridge station, with the line from Heaton Norris.

At the end of 1849, the network amounted to 159 miles, with an additional 110 miles of canal.

==Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway==
The Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Junction Railway (MSJ&amp;AR) had originally been conceived to connect the Sheffield, Ashton under Lyne and Manchester Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The Manchester and Birmingham Railway (M&amp;BR) would benefit too from the connection. It was authorised on 21 July 1845 as an independent private company, with three shareholders: the , the and the Earl of Ellesmere. His share was bought out in 1847 and the two railway companies had merged into the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway and the London and North Western Railway respectively, so that the was wholly and equally owned by the and the . The line was to be in two parts. The South Junction part was to connect the London Road station of the (used by the ) with the former Liverpool and Manchester Railway (now ) at Ordsall Lane. This connected the hitherto separate networks east and west of Manchester. The other part was the seven-mile line to Altrincham.

The line opened between Oxford Road, Manchester, and Altrincham on 20 July 1849, and it was extended back to London Road in July 1849, and from Altrincham to Bowdon in August 1849, or September 1849.

The network was now complete. As well as enabling a busy local passenger service, in time the line formed a strategic link, later enabling the to pass Manchester and penetrate westwards.

==James Allport==
In May 1849, George Hudson, the so-called Railway King, had fallen from power as his underhand methods were exposed. The politics of the large railway companies shifted considerably, as Hudson&#x27;s successors, particularly Captain Mark Huish of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), engaged in schemes to gain advantage over neighbouring lines. The directors saw that it was no longer practicable to control their company&#x27;s day-to-day activities from the board, and the decided to appoint a general manager. The board selected James Joseph Allport, appointed at a salary of £1,200 a year. Due to existing commitments he was not able to take up the post until 1 January 1850. Allport&#x27;s appointment at what seemed to some to be a high salary caused some shareholder disquiet.

==The Great Northern Railway==

The Great Northern Railway was building its main line in stages, and on 4 September 1849 it opened its Doncaster-Retford line. At Retford the trains used the station until its own station there was opened. This took place on 1 August 1852 after completion of the Retford-Peterborough section of the main line, which crossed that of the on the flat. An act of Parliament of 24 July 1851, the (14 &amp; 15 Vict. c. cxiv), permitted the to run over the to cross the River Trent at Gainsborough, and also to enter the eastern end of the Great Northern Railway station at Lincoln by means of a spur from Durham Ox Junction, on the line from Market Rasen. On 1 July 1859 the brought into use the Whisker Hill curve at Retford, which enabled its passenger trains to use the Great Northern station: the Retford station closed on the same date.

==The Euston Square Confederacy==
Mark Huish had taken over at the ; he was a master of commercial chicanery. He achieved domination of the Midland Railway and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway by means of traffic pooling agreements, and the alliance became known as the Euston Square Confederacy. There were good relations between the Great Northern Railway and the , and Huish saw that completion of the line from Peterborough to Doncaster, connecting with the at Retford, as well as the Gainsborough connection, would encourage a co-operation that would abstract traffic from his allies. He manipulated Allport and the into joining a traffic agreement that contained clauses hostile to any collaboration with the ; this was approved on 16 January 1850.

==Improvements 1850 to 1852==

The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway opened a line from Huddersfield to Penistone on 1 July 1850; passenger trains began to run over it into Huddersfield.

The Leverton line, leading towards Lincoln, was opened on 7 August 1850, forming a shortened route between Retford and Lincoln. It was supposed to enable trains to run through to Lincoln over the , and in return for the to reach Sheffield; however because of its traffic agreement with the , the felt obliged to try to frustrate the arrangement.

At the end of May 1851 a contract was concluded with the Electric Telegraph Company which, for about £5 per mile per annum, undertook to install lines between Manchester, Sheffield, New Holland, Grimsby and Lincoln, providing not only the equipment but the clerks to operate it at the principal stations.

In July 1851 through carriages by three trains a day were introduced between Sheffield (Bridgehouses) and London (Euston Square) via Beighton, Eckington, the Midland Railway, and the .

A considerable step forward was taken when the new Sheffield station (in due course named &quot;Victoria&quot;) was opened on 15 September 1851. It was very commodious; the Bridgehouses station was converted to a goods depot.

The second bore of the Woodhead tunnel opened for traffic on 2 February 1852; its beneficial effect on train operating was felt immediately, and the removal of the pilot engine alone saved £800 a year.

On 18 March 1852 a banquet was held at Grimsby to celebrate the completion of the &#x27;s dock; it entered public use in May and a branch from Grimsby Town station to the Docks and Pier stations, with two miles of internal dock lines, were ready on 1 August 1853.

The Etherow and Dinting Vale viaducts on the original line had both been strengthened with extra tie rods in the middle 1850s. They were insured respectively for £4,000 and £6,000, but now drastic repairs were required: all of the timber arches in both structures were to be replaced by wrought iron girders at a cost of £28,700 from November 1859. Not long afterwards the contractor system of permanent way maintenance came to an end when it was discovered that a contractor had got into serious financial difficulty; the work was brought in-house.

The first quadruple-track section of the , between Gorton and Ashburys, were drawn up in 1860. Negotiations were required with the over the use of the proposed widened lines between Ardwick junction and London Road. The were to vacate the original pair of tracks and be given the exclusive use of the two new lines on the northern side, except in the case of accidents, and have access across the to the line. Although this seemed to be agreed smoothly enough with the , that company later used its primacy at London Road and the need for trains to cross to the southern side there, as a means of obstructing expansion.

James Allport resigned on 20 July 1853, effective at the end of September; he went to the Midland Railway. A shareholders&#x27; consultative committee had been set up and was require to be involved in strategic decisions of the company; it appears that Allport considered this to be an infringement of his role.

Edward William Watkin took over in his place on 1 January 1854. He had been the assistant of Huish at the and he revealed that the latter, in spite of the Euston Square agreement, had been negotiating with the for a territorial division between the two companies, to the detriment of the . Dow refers to this as &quot;deplorable duplicity&quot; by Huish.

Watkin had a challenge before him; at this time traffic receipts were falling short of fixed obligations by about £1,000 a week. Huish resumed his attempts at coercion. Members of the and boards met at Rugby on 20 July 1854. It was agreed that the two railways should be worked as one interest with a scheme for sharing income and expenses. The treaty was regarded as continuous and subject only to seven years&#x27; notice of termination by either side. The agreement was finalised on 29 July 1854. Later in the year the offered to perform the whole of the &#x27;s passenger and parcels business at London Road station, including collection and delivery by van, for £600 a year. This was accepted and the withdrew its staff. It was a move that the came to regret.

Financially, 1855 was not a good year for the . Trade generally had been adversely affected by the blockade of the Baltic ports, owing to the Crimean War. Passenger traffic showed decreases in all categories except second class. In the same year the maintenance of permanent way was changed from direct to contractors.

==The end of the Euston Confederacy==
In the 1856 session of Parliament, the North Western Railway (a small company unconnected with the London and North Western Railway) was applying for running powers over part of the . In the course of the examination of witnesses, the illegal &quot;common-purse&quot; agreement which existed between the London and North Western and the Midland Railway was exposed. Euston Square was now vulnerable to a Chancery suit, and, in the spring of 1857 a director of the Great Northern Railway filed a petition in Chancery. The position was indefensible and Euston Square had no option but to terminate the arrangement; this was done on 12 May 1857. The Euston Square Confederacy was neutralised.
Huish attempted further duplicity in trying to agree a sharing of traffic with the Great Northern Railway, but that company saw the danger and refused. The decided to sever all agreements with the , and to form an alliance with the Great Northern Railway. The process to conclude these things took some time, but it resulted in transfer of the Manchester to London express passenger service to the route via Retford and the Great Northern Railway, in the same journey time as formerly via the . Of course much mineral traffic followed this transfer. Some of the track between Wadsley Bridge and Oughty Bridge still had the original stone-block sleepered track, and this had to be hastily modernised. (At the beginning of 1858 an inspection indicated that the last of the stone block sleepers in the main line had gone).

The continued to use underhand tactics of all kinds to frustrate the smooth operation of and trains, especially at Manchester. The warfare continued despite the efforts of neutral railway companies to mediate, and it was not until 12 November 1858 that a peaceful agreement was concluded. Throughout the process, Huish had been pursuing personal antagonistic objectives, and had steadily lost the confidence of his own board, and on 11 September 1858 his resignation was accepted.

==Domestic branch lines==

===Penistone to Barnsley branch===
Towards the end of 1851 the Board had considered the restarting of the Barnsley branch construction, which had been promised but never proceeded with. In the meantime, other companies had connected the town: the Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley, Wakefield, Huddersfield and Goole Railway and the South Yorkshire Railway. It was at last completed, opening in three stages, from 15 May 1854 to 12 February 1857.

===Birley coal branch===
The Birley coal branch, turning west from Woodhouse and miles in length, was brought into use in June 1855.

===Hyde branch and extension to New Mills===
The opened a branch to Hyde from Newton, on the main line on 1 March 1858. Newton station had been called Newton &amp; Hyde (now Hyde North), and an omnibus service to Hyde itself had been operated at one time. (The Hyde station is now Hyde Central.) Parliamentary sanction was given in 1858 to extend the Hyde branch to Compstall Bridge, then a local centre of industry. In fact the extension was from Hyde to Marple, with intermediate stations at Woodley and Romiley; it opened on 5 August 1862.


A further extension looked advantageous, and this was conceived as a nominally independent company, the &#x27; (MNM&amp;HJR). Sponsored by the it was authorised by the &#x27; (23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. xv) on 15 May 1860. It was to extend to New Mills with a branch from there to Hayfield. From Marple to New Mills the line opened for goods on 1 July 1865 and for passengers on 1 February 1867. Meanwhile, the Midland Railway was building a line up from near Miller&#x27;s Dale, joining the at New Mills; it opened on 1 October 1866. This gave the Midland Railway access to the system, and thereby to Manchester. The Marple, New Mills and Hayfield Junction Railway Company was acquired by the on 5 July 1865 under the (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. ccxlviii).

==Oldham, Ashton and Guide Bridge Railway==
The had sought the support of the and for the construction of a south-to-north line from Guide Bridge to Oldham, connecting with those companies&#x27; lines. The Oldham, Ashton and Guide Bridge Railway (OA&amp;GBR) was authorised on 10 August 1857, with capital of £140,000. The was anxious to secure the commitment of the to the project, partly to disarm plans to build their own line there. The had at first expressed preparedness to support the line, but in negotiations which dragged into 1858 the as clearly determined to keep the out, and the withdrew. Accordingly, on 30 June 1862 the was leased to the and . Each subscribed £50,000.

By the end of March 1860 the line had been finished between Guide Bridge and the junction with the near Ashton-under-Lyne, but unusually wet weather delayed the completion of the remainder. On 31 July 1861 the line was opened formally. Passenger trains started running on 26 August, the providing the locomotives and carriages; goods traffic did not start until 1 February 1863.

==Reaching toward Liverpool==
Liverpool was a prime seaport with a huge volume of international and coastwise trade, and was consequently of strategic importance for railways in the region. The reached as far west as Manchester, and was joint owner of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway. The began to consider how it might reach Liverpool without dependency of the , which was generally hostile and obstructive.

===St Helens Railway===
The St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway had been built to convey minerals south from St Helens to the River Mersey. It had opened on 21 February 1833, and its route included rope worked inclines. It amalgamated with the Sankey Brook Navigation, forming the St Helens Canal and Railway by an act of Parliament, the St. Helens Canal and Railway Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. cxvii), of 21 July 1845. The construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway showed that merely acting as a feeder to waterborne transport was no longer competitive.

John Meadows Rendel, the engineer of Birkenhead docks, recommended the development of a dock at Garston, on the Mersey south of Liverpool, and a connecting railway. This was authorised in 1846; it diverged from the original line to Runcorn Gap just north of the Mersey and ran west to Garston. It opened on 1 July 1852, and the dock at Garston opened on 21 July 1853. A line eastwards to Warrington was built from a junction with the new line, and was opened on 1 February 1853.

===Warrington and Altrincham Junction Railway===
The Warrington and Altrincham Junction Railway (W&amp;AJR) was authorised by the Warrington and Altrincham Junction Railway Act 1851 (14 &amp; 15 Vict. c. lxxi) on 3 July 1851. It was to make a line from the St Helens Railway at Warrington to Timperley Junction (facing Manchester) on the . The and the St Helens Railway were closely associated, sharing directors.

The changed its name to the Warrington and Stockport Railway by an act of Parliament, the Warrington and Stockport Railway Act 1853 (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. cxxii), on 4 August 1853 when it got powers to extend eastwards to Stockport. On 1 May 1854 it opened its line between Timperley, on the , and Warrington, and the St Helens Railway was extended a short distance from its Warrington terminal to meet the Warrington and Stockport line at Arpley station, in 1854. On 13 August 1859 the Warrington and Stockport Railway was leased to the and St Helens companies jointly, and on 14 June 1860 the St Helens company&#x27;s line from Warrington to Garston was leased to the .

=== Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway ===
The Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway was authorised on 15 May 1860 by the Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway Act 1860 (23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. xvi) to make a line from Woodley, on the line between Newton &amp; Hyde and Marple stations. It opened on 12 May 1863, giving access to Stockport round the south side of Manchester. An east to south connection from Godley to Woodley was later constructed, enabling through running from the Sheffield direction to Woodley; it opened on 1 February 1866. This short line was vested in the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) on 10 August 1866.

===Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway trains to Liverpool===
The now had access to Garston over the St Helens line, from the . At first the St Helens company worked the line, but the working was taken over by the from 1 October 1856. From 1 February 1858 the in collaboration with the ran express trains between Garston and London; an &quot;express omnibus&quot; connection was provided over the five miles between Garston and Liverpool. In 1858 and 1859 an steamer, brought round from the River Humber service, made the connection instead. Yet the could set London passengers and goods down in the centre of Liverpool, and the gap from Garston made the and service unattractive.

From September 1859, the changed its routing: through coaches and goods wagons were worked over the &#x27;s Liverpool &amp; Manchester line, via Newton-le-Willows, and both the and opened offices at various stations in Liverpool, including Lime Street, Wapping and Waterloo. This arrangement was better than the use of the Garston terminal, but it involved a heavy dependency on the , and that company was not a comfortable partner. In March 1861 the held a meeting to generate support for a new railway northwards from Garston. The outcome was the Garston and Liverpool Railway, which received its act of Parliament, the Garston and Liverpool Railway Act 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. xxxv), on 17 May 1861. It was to be a four-mile double track line with a terminus at Queen&#x27;s Dock, although this was altered to Brunswick Dock in 1862. Meanwhile, the had leased the St Helens Railway from 1860, and absorbed it in 1864, as part of its own plan for an improved route from Liverpool to the south, avoiding the detour via Newton le Willows.

The line from Garston to Brunswick Dock opened on 1 June 1864. This was still not entirely satisfactory, for Brunswick Dock station was not in central Liverpool. The Liverpool Central Station Railway Act 1864 (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. ccxc) of 29 July 1864 permitted a &quot;difficult and costly&quot; further extension to a new Liverpool Central Station. The extension line was floated as a separate company named the Liverpool Central Station Railway. Negotiations for land acquisition in the prime districts of Liverpool were protracted, and took until 1869, and the first construction contract was not awarded until July 1870, six years after authorisation, and the &quot;daunting&quot; task began.

===London and North Western Railway hostility===
The Great Northern Railway and the had running powers from Timperley to Garston over the , mandated in the original Garston and Liverpool Railway Act 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. xxxv). This gave the partners a through Manchester – Liverpool route; they already had powers for access to Lime Street, Waterloo and Wapping. These various running powers and the impending extension to Liverpool Central began to antagonise the , which became belligerent. In October 1864 it locked the / booking clerks out of their offices at Waterloo; this was followed by closure of the Wapping office; papers there were ransacked. In January 1865 the allies were told to withdraw staff from Lime Street and send traffic only via Warrington. Two daily passenger trains continued to use Lime Street, but the did not show them in the timetable, refused to service the coaches, and would not allow local Liverpool – Manchester passengers to board them. They were withdrawn in October 1865, losing money heavily.

==Cheshire Lines==
As well as the push towards Liverpool, Watkin wanted the to expand into the industrial, chemical and mineral areas of the Cheshire Plain as well. It did so by encouraging a number of apparently independent companies.

===Cheshire Midland Railway===
The Cheshire Midland Railway was authorised by an act of Parliament, the Cheshire Midland Railway Act 1860 (23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. xc), on 14 June 1860, to build a line from Altrincham on the to Northwich. It opened from Altrincham to Knutsford on 12 May 1862, and from Knutsford to Northwich on 1 January 1863.

===West Cheshire Railway===
The West Cheshire Railway was incorporated by the West Cheshire Railways Act 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. cxliii) on 11 July 1861. Although a line from Northwich to Chester had been proposed, the powers were limited to a line as far as Mouldsworth, then running north to Helsby. In 1862 a second attempt to get approval for the line to Chester was also refused, although a short branch to Winsford was allowed. Construction was rather delayed, and the line from Northwich to Helsby opened for goods traffic on 1 September 1869, and for passenger trains on 22 June 1870; the Winsford branch opened in 1870.

===Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway===
In concert with the Great Northern Railway, the promoted the Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway (ST&amp;AJR). It was authorised by an act of Parliament, the Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway Act 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. clxxv), of 22 July 1861, to build from Stockport (on the Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway) to a junction at Broadheath on the Warrington and Stockport Railway, with a spur to Timperley on the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway, facing away from Manchester. The opened from Portwood, east of Stockport, to Deansgate Junction, on the , on 1 December 1865. A short spur (Skelton Junction to Broadheath Junction) connected to the Warrington and Stockport Railway, opening on 1 February 1866. This line gave access south-west of Manchester avoiding the congestion of the approaches to the conurbation. The line was managed by a joint committee of the and the .

==Resignation of Watkin==
Watkin had interests in railways outside the and, being granted three months leave of absence to recover his health, agreed to examine the affairs of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada. The was once again on the verge of an association with the and, possibly the , that would resolve its financial problems. However an event in the final months of 1861, during his absence, upset his plans. The Midland Railway was determined to find a path into Manchester. It was already building an extension to Buxton from Rowsley but the was proceeding into Buxton from the other direction. One day, it is said, some directors of the met James Allport and others, while the latter were prospecting an alternative route. The upshot was that the agreed to share their line from New Mills with the Midland, the latter extending their line to meet it. This, which was later approved as the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies&#x27; Committee, threatened to cause a schism with the , who saw this as bad faith regarding their co-operative agreement with the . Clearly the could not countenance another major line in their territory, but Watkin was incensed, and tendered his resignation. Dow refers to Watkin&#x27;s behaviour as &quot;petulance which smacked unpleasantly of his departed tutor Huish&quot;. Robert George Underdown was immediately appointed General Manager.

It was obvious that Watkin regretted his departure from the General Managership of the . He retained directorial posts but was glad to attain the Chairmanship of the company on 27 January 1864.

The company&#x27;s financial performance had long been disappointing: ordinary dividends from 1846 until 1899 never exceeded % for a whole year and for nine years were in default.

==Establishment of the Cheshire Lines Committee==
The Great Northern Railway (Cheshire Lines) Act 1863 (26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. cxlvii) allowed the and the to regulate traffic on lines built, or proposed to be built in the Cheshire area. The Midland Railway was something of a latecomer to the area and became a natural ally of the and the GNR locally, and was admitted to the controlling group.

The Cheshire Lines Transfer Act 1865 (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. cccxxvii) of 5 July 1865 therefore allowed the Midland Railway to join in the committee which it did in 1866. The Cheshire Lines Act 1867 (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. ccvii) of 15 August 1867 named the resultant group as the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) and gave it complete autonomy.

The constituent companies absorbed by the committee were;

* The Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway;
* The Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway;
* The West Cheshire Railway;
* The Cheshire Midland Railway;
* The Garston and Liverpool Railway.

The powers of the Liverpool Central Station Railway were acquired on 30 July 1866.

Smith and Anderson describe the rolling stock:

Initially the hired carriages and wagons from the owning partners, but soon purchased its own rolling stock. By the grouping of 1923 it had nearly 600 coaches and over 4,000 goods vehicles on its books. Many of the former were used on Liverpool-Manchester expresses and they exuded luxury. Handsome composites built by the Lancaster Carriage &amp; Wagon Company had first class compartments lined in mahogany and upholstered with green or brown velvet, whilst the exceptionally fine coaches supplied by Great Central workshops (in 1914) featured first class accommodation finished in walnut and sycamore with fittings of oxidised copper and deep blue cloth seats. Such opulence was understandable in view of the popularity of the service, but this was only possible because of the extension to Liverpool Central.

==Chester and West Cheshire Junction Railway==
The West Cheshire Railway had been denied direct access to Chester in 1861 and 1862. Finally an act of 5 July 1865, the Chester and West Cheshire Junction Railway Act 1865 (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. ccxcii) authorised the Chester and West Cheshire Junction Railway to build from the West Cheshire Railway at Mouldsworth to a new Chester station, named Northgate. The company was acquired by the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) on 10 August 1866. Construction was greatly delayed, and the line was opened on 2 November 1874 for goods trains and on 1 May 1875 for passengers.

==Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies&#x27; Committee==
The Marple, New Mills and Hayfield Junction Railway (MNM&amp;HJR), sponsored by the was incorporated on 15 May 1860. It opened as far as New Mills on 1 July 1865 (goods) and 1 February 1867 (passengers). Meanwhile, the Midland Railway had built a line up from Miller&#x27;s Dale, joining the at New Mills, and opening on 1 October 1866. This gave the Midland Railway access to Manchester, and the regarded it as an ally. The inbound journey for Midland trains was via Romiley, Hyde and Guide Bridge. The MNM&amp;HJR company was acquired by the on 5 July 1865.

On 16 July 1866 the Manchester and Stockport Railway was incorporated, sponsored by the . This sanctioned a line of miles from Ashburys to Brinnington Junction on the Stockport and Woodley (now ) line, with a branch of miles from Reddish junction to Romiley on the New Mills line. It was conceived chiefly to give the Midland Railway access into Manchester, and it was intended that the Midland would adopt joint ownership of the line, as well as the existing line between Hyde Junction and New Mills. Midland trains started to use London Road from 1 February 1867. On 24 June 1869 the still unfinished Manchester and Stockport Railway, and the line from Hyde to New Mills, and the branch from New Mills to Hayfield, were vested jointly in the and the Midland, from then onwards known as the Sheffield and Midland Committee Lines. Like the , this committee was a corporate body owning physical assets.

==South Yorkshire Railway==
The South Yorkshire Railway (SYR) had established a small network primarily oriented to mineral traffic, opened from Doncaster to Swinton in 1849, and to Barnsley in 1851. On 10 September 1859 the opened from Doncaster and Keadby. Already in 1861 the had carried a million tons of coal. On 23 June 1864 the was authorised to lease the for 999 years. The got a follow-up act of Parliament, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (Purchase, &amp;c.) Act 1865 (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. ccxlviii), on 5 July 1865 which provided for an extensive interchange of running powers with the Midland Railway. The was to connect from Barnsley on to the Midland main line by means of a new branch to Cudworth, and then continue northwards to the West Riding &amp; Grimsby Railway near Oakenshaw.

The had started the process of reaching Hull, having agreed with the North Eastern Railway (NER) to construct such a line, the portion finishing at Thorne. That line opened on 2 August 1869 and the started running through to Hull over the . The southern fork to Keadby opened on the same day.

On 16 July 1874 the South Yorkshire Railway and River Dun Company&#x27;s Vesting Act 1874 (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. cxxxi) dissolved the , transferring it to the absolutely. 76 route miles of railway and 60 miles of canal transferred to ownership.

===Cleethorpes===
On 6 April 1863 the Cleethorpes extension from Grimsby was opened; it was a single line, later doubled in 1874.

===Scunthorpe line===
In 1858 ironstone deposits were discovered at Frodingham, a few miles east of the River Trent, where Keadby was located on the west side. The Trent, Ancholme and Grimsby Railway was sponsored by the and the together to fill in the gap from Keadby to Barnetby. It was authorised by the Trent, Ancholme and Grimsby Railway Act 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. clvi), and required a bridge at Althorpe to cross the Trent. The line opened to goods on 1 May 1866 and passengers on 1 October 1866. The Frodingham ironstone resource gave rise to the massive Scunthorpe ironworks.

==West Riding and Grimsby Joint Railway==
The West Riding and Grimsby Joint Railway was promoted by the South Yorkshire Railway (SYR) in 1862 as the West Riding, Hull and Grimsby Railway, extending from Wakefield to a junction with the at Stainforth, with a branch from Adwick to Doncaster. Hull and Grimsby were included in the title as distant objectives, rather than places to be included in the network: the was separately planning a line to Hull, and already ran to Keadby with aspirations to continue to Grimsby. Hull was omitted from the title by the time of incorporation on 7 August 1862.

The Great Northern Railway was alarmed by the interest that the was taking in the line: it was leasing the . The appeared to be friendly with the Great Eastern Railway, which the was at pains to keep out of the area. After much negotiation the West Riding and Grimsby Railway (Transfer) Act 1866 (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. clxii) authorised the and the to become joint owners of the line. The settlement gave the running powers over existing lines north-west of Wakefield. The direct benefit to the was a route from Doncaster to Wakefield avoiding dependency on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.

The Doncaster – Adwick – Wakefield part of the was opened in February 1866, but the section from Adwick junction to Stainforth junction was delayed until the finished its Doncaster – Thorne direct line, in November 1866.

==Independent access to Liverpool==

Notwithstanding the construction of the Garston and Liverpool line, the could only get access to Liverpool by running over a lengthy section of the from Timperley Junction to Garston. Watkin saw that this was untenable, and determined to build an independent line. He deposited a bill for a new line from Old Trafford (on the on the edge of Manchester) to a junction with the Garston and Liverpool line near Cressington, as well as a link from Timperley to Glazebrook, joining the proposed line. The Old Trafford to Garston line was sanctioned by the (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. ccclxxviii) of 6 July.
In 1866 authorisation was given for a slight change to the point of junction at Old Trafford, and for a loop line to give a Warrington station in the town; the original plan was a straight route some distance out on the north side. The (unbuilt) line was vested in the on 16 July 1866 by the (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. cxci), thus making the Midland and Great Northern each responsible for one-third of its £750,000 share capital. The construction was not easy; at last on 1 March 1873 the first section, from Timperley to Cressington junction, near Garston, was opened for goods traffic; on 14 May a short spur to the at Allerton was opened. Passenger services started on 1 August 1873. The remaining section, from Cornbrook junction to Glazebrook junction was opened on 2 September. The two sections added 33 route miles of line to the system.

After a difficult construction period, Liverpool Central station opened on 1 March 1874. The passenger service from there to Manchester was sixteen trains each way, increasing steadily over subsequent decades. The passenger business at Brunswick station was discontinued from 1 March 1874. A connection to the dock lines was put in during 1884: a major traffic was bunkering coal for liners: in Great Central days the RMS Lusitania and RMS Mauretania needed 6,000 tons of coal for a trans-Atlantic crossing.

==North Liverpool Lines==
The still lacked practicable access to the northern docks at Liverpool, and having spent several years considering how an affordable route could be created, obtained the North Liverpool Lines Act 1874 of 30 July 1874. This sanctioned an eleven-mile branch from Hunt&#x27;s Cross on the main line to a terminus at Sandhills and a two and a quarter-mile connection from Fazakerley to the at Aintree. Triangular junctions were to be created by spurs from Hunt&#x27;s Cross East to Halewood North and Fazakerley West to North.

In 1878 the name Huskisson was adopted in place of Sandhills for the terminus. The line opened on 1 December 1879, although the spurs at the junctions took until 1888.
The two-mile section from Walton on the Hill to Huskisson opened for goods traffic on 1 July 1880. Passenger trains from Liverpool Central via Walton on the Hill were run from 2 August 1880, but they were an abject failure and were discontinued on 1 May 1885.

==Macclesfield==

The Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway was incorporated on 14 June 1864 to build a line from Marple Wharf Junction, on the Sheffield &amp; Midland Joint line, to its own Macclesfield terminus, a distance of ten miles. It opened the line to passengers on 2 August 1869, and to goods in March 1870. A connection to the North Staffordshire Railway for goods traffic was made on 3 August 1871.

The company was vested in the and NSR on 25 May 1871, and the joint owners opened a new station, Macclesfield Central, on 1 July 1873.

==Manchester Central station and the South District Railway==
The was progressing towards having its own independent terminus, Manchester Central, authorised by an act of Parliament of 1872. The station opened on 9 July 1877. Immediately the introduced an hourly express service to Liverpool, with a journey time of 45 minutes. The first station was a temporary building and the permanent structure was opened on 1 July 1880.

The South District Railway had been authorised by an act of Parliament of 5 August 1873, to build from the Liverpool Extension Railway at Throstle Nest Junction (east of Trafford Park Station) via Chorlton-cum-Hardy, and Didsbury to Alderley. It never reached Alderley, and the company was acquired by the Midland Railway on 12 August 1877. It opened to Heaton Mersey () on 1 January 1880, giving the Midland Railway access to the lines and Central station.

The was able to build a line from Fairfield junction (facing east) to Chorlton junction passing round the south of Manchester giving the direct access from the east to the South District Line and Manchester Central station. It opened on 1 October 1891 from Chorlton Junction to Fallowfield, and the portion of the South District Line between Chorlton Junction and Throstle Nest Junction was transferred to the on the same day. The line was extended to Fairfield Junction on 2 May 1892.

==Wigan Junction Railways==

Expanded colliery activity around West Leigh and Wigan encouraged the and the Midland Railway, working collaboratively as the Sheffield and Midland Committee to plan a line to get access. The scheme materialised as the Wigan Junction Railways, making a junction with the west of Glazebrook and running north-west; junctions were planned with the and Lancashire Union Railway on the approach to Wigan. The company was incorporated on 16 July 1874. It was slow to make progress and the Midland withdrew its financial support; the ensured that the line was solvent, to prevent it from falling into the hands of the . It opened from Glazebrook to Strangeways Hall Colliery, immediately west of Hindley, 16 October 1879; the working the goods and mineral traffic. Connections with the at Amberswood East and West Junctions were made in July 1880. A passenger service was started on 1 April 1884; the line was extended to a temporary terminus at Darlington Street, on the edge of Wigan. A quarter-mile extension of the line to Wigan Central station was opened on 3 October 1892. The company was later taken over by the Great Central Railway.

==Southport and Cheshire Lines Extension Railway==
In 1878 municipal authorities in Southport asked the to extend the North Liverpool line from Aintree to Southport. In 1880 the set up a separate company for the purpose and a bill was prepared for a Southport and Cheshire Lines Extension Railway; it passed as the Southport and Cheshire Lines Extension Railway Act 1881 (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. cxciii) on 11 September 1881. The line opened on 1 September 1884, to Birkdale, and throughout on 18 August 1882. It was worked by the Cheshire Lines Committee although it retained its separate identity.

==The Liverpool, St Helens and South Lancashire Railway==
After the Wigan Junction Railways opened in 1879, a branch from them to St Helens was promoted locally, as the St Helens and Wigan Junction Railway. It was authorised on 22 July 1885, and the supported it financially. It was renamed the Liverpool, St Helens and South Lancashire Railway on 26 July 1889, but the possibility extending it beyond St Helens to Liverpool gradually faded. It opened for goods traffic on 1 July 1895, and a passenger service started on 3 January 1900. It was worked by the .

==Wrexham, Mold and Connah&#x27;s Quay Railway==
The Wrexham, Mold and Connah&#x27;s Quay Railway (WM&amp;CQR) had established itself as a carrier of minerals from the Brymbo area west of Wrexham to the River Dee and to the main lien railways nearby. In 1881 it proposed to cross the river and expand into the Wirral, but the scheme was unsuccessful for the time being.

It was revived and in 1884 a crossing of the Dee was authorised. The London and North Western Railway was unhelpful, and the asked the for financial assistance. The agreed to build from the at Hawarden, on the south side of the Dee, crossing the river and swinging east to run to Chester. The part of this was called the Chester and Connah&#x27;s Quay Railway; it was authorised on 31 July 1885. At Chester it connected to the Cheshire Lines Committee network giving the access from its own network further east. The Dee crossing, by means of the Hawarden Bridge, was a huge structure: it was opened on 3 August 1889, and the line from Chester to Connah&#x27;s Quay, crossing the bridge, was opened on 31 March 1890. A Chester to Wrexham passenger service of three trains a day was started, worked by the .

The and the together built a line from Hawarden to Bidston, connecting there with the Wirral Railway. The line was called the North Wales and Liverpool Railway. The relied on heavy financial support from the , which had acquired a majority share holding in the Wrexham company. The Bidston line opened for goods trains on 16 March 1896, and passenger services (to Seacombe via Bidston) followed on 18 May 1896, worked by the but using hired locomotives. The did not have running powers over the Wirral Railway at Bidston, so the worked the line itself, using hired engines hired to them, but with their numbers painted out and numbers added.

==Growth of mineral traffic==
Mineral traffic, especially coal, had long been dominant in the business of the . In the final three decades of the nineteenth century, the volume of mineral trade expanded considerably, and overwhelmed the capacity of the network to carry it. Following serious complaint by the business community, a series of widenings was carried out.

==The London extension==
From 1883 at the latest Watkin had considered that the should try to extend to London, which was the principal market for coal from its area. The means of achieving this were not obvious, but on 26 July 1889 parliamentary permission was obtained for a line from Beighton, where the crossed the Midland Railway, to Annesley, and a branch to Chesterfield. This was the first step on the road to London. The years 1890–1894 were dominated by the campaign for the London extension.

When it had been won, Watkin withdrew from the centre of the railway stage. Dow says:

&quot;To his successors Watkin left the well-nigh impossible task of making pay a line which Sir John Clapham, a contemporary economic historian, described as &#x27;a belated, and almost entirely superfluous, product of the original era of fighting construction&#x27;.&quot;

Construction of the so-called Derbyshire lines, which were to extend the to the Great Northern at Annesley junction and its trains to Nottingham proceeded: the first section from Beighton to Staveley Works opened on 1 December 1891; on 4 June 1892 the section from Staveley Town to Chesterfield was opened. Then from Staveley Town to Annesley junction was opened on 24 October 1892; coal and goods trains began running to Nottingham; Colwick, instead of Doncaster, now became the exchange point with the for coal bound for the south.

Watkin&#x27;s clear intention now was to get a line to London, using the Metropolitan Railway for the southernmost lap, but he knew that he risked warfare with allied railways, especially the Great Northern Railway, if he did not tread carefully. On 16 September 1889 he wrote to the Great Northern Railway (GNR), consulting its chairman about the &#x27;s possible reaction. He suggested that the could avoid necessary piecemeal widenings of its own main line by joining a traffic agreement with the for London traffic. Watkin&#x27;s diplomacy deserted him, however, when he wrote again adding a second &quot;string to your bow would give great strength and profit to the Great Northern, and would in all senses be better than wasting your shareholders&#x27; capital on the plastering of your old line.&quot;
The went ahead on its own, and after a false start obtained royal assent in the (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. lxxix) for the line to Marylebone on 28 March 1893. The line would need £6 million of capital. (In fact the outturn was about double that figure.) The times were bad for raising money. By now Watkin had had enough of railway politics, and his health was imperfect. He wrote resigning his chairmanship on 19 May 1894; it was accepted on 25 May.

In 1896 the London extension was progressing, and thought was given to changing the company&#x27;s name. On 27 March 1896 &quot;Manchester, Sheffield and London&quot; was considered, but then &quot;Central&quot; or &quot;Great Central&quot;. The Central London Railway objected, but to no avail. &quot;Great Central Railway&quot; was decided upon, and the new title was assumed on 1 August 1897 under section 80 of the Great Central Railway Act 1897 (60 &amp; 61 Vict. c. liv).

There was still much to do on the London extension and associated railways. The ordinary dividend paid by the had been poor for many years, and the huge expenditure on the London extension would need to be serviced. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway had been a west-to-east railway, handing over much of its lucrative traffic to partner railways or in some cases to hostile companies. Soon it would have its own line to London, and would earn revenue from mineral traffic to the southern counties. In addition it would serve some of the great towns of the Midlands and the northern Home Counties.

The narrative of the next years appears in the article Great Central Railway.

==Locomotive works==
The locomotive works was situated at Gorton, Manchester, opened in 1849. They were known as &quot;The Tank&quot;.

==Principal railway stations==
*Manchester Central
*Sheffield Victoria
*Lincoln Central
*Grimsby

==Docks==
Grimsby docks, in later days named &quot;the largest fishing port in the world&quot; (but also with a large trade in timber) became part of the railway at its inception. It was opened in 1801, using the natural harbour. Once it became railway property, the increased the facilities by starting to construct a New Dock covering 25 acres (10 ha) in 1846; it was opened on 18 April 1852. Over the years more docks were added.

At Hull the had a goods depot on Kingston Street, established 1879, built by and rented from the North Eastern Railway. The site of the goods station has been redeveloped as an ice arena, Hull Arena.

==Locomotive engineers==
*1846–1854 Richard Peacock
*1854–1859 W. G. Craig
*1859–1886 Charles R Sacre
*1886–1893 Thomas Parker
*1893–1897 Harry Pollitt (served the GCR until 1900)

==MS&amp;LR locomotives==
*Class D5 4-4-0 1894–1897 six of the class were built
*Class D7 4-4-0 1887–1894 operated the express trains, Manchester to London (Kings&#x27; Cross, via Retford and G.N.R. line)
*Class D8 4-4-0 1888
*Class E2 2-4-0 1888 3 built for the Manchester-Grantham expresses
*Class F1 2-4-2T 1889–1893 39 built
*Class F2 2-4-2T 10 built
*Class J8 0-6-0
*Class J9 0-6-0
*Class J12 0-6-0
*Class J10 0-6-0
*Class J62 0-6-0ST 1897

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 12 December 1870, a goods train was being marshalled at Barnsley, and part of the train was left on a falling gradient of 1 in 119. The wagons were inadequately secured. When other wagons were fly-shunted on to them, they ran away down the gradient and collided with a passenger train at station. Fifteen persons were killed and 59 injured.
*On 16 July 1884, an express passenger train was derailed between and , Yorkshire due to the fracture of the crank axle on the locomotive hauling it. Nineteen people were killed.

<doc id="596630" wikidata="Q5075340" url="?curid=596630" title="Charles B. Wang Center">
<text>The Charles B. Wang Center, located at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York, in Suffolk County, on Long Island, is a building dedicated to understanding Asian and American cultures, and the interactions of these cultures with other world cultures. The center was completed in 2002, and was designed by P.H. Tuan. Building of the center was intended to be funded by Charles B. Wang through a $52 million donation to Stony Brook University, which was then the largest ever private donation to a school in the State University of New York system. Actual construction costs far exceeded the original donation, becoming a source of controversy among students and faculty at the time.

The building covers 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2), and is noted for its interior architecture. The building holds numerous conference halls, classrooms (although no classes have been held in the building), auditoriums, a chapel, and an East Asian food court for students. Thus far, the center has been the location for numerous presentations, as well as films, and conferences that deal with multicultural issues.

== History ==
In 1996, Wang announced a donation of $25 million for the construction of an Asian American center on the campus of Stony Brook University. Wang, a graduate of Queens College, chose to donate to Stony Brook University because of its internationally renowned computer science program and its location near the Long Island headquarters of Computer Associates, Inc., his company. Wang was also close friends with Shirley Strum Kenny, Stony Brook&#x27;s president at the time and the former Queens College president. The donation was the largest ever to a State University of New York campus, and Stony Brook University leased a four-acre plot to Wang for the construction of a 25,000-square-foot building.

The construction of the center was met with delays and ultimately fell three years behind schedule as the original plan of a 25,000-square-foot building increased to a 120,000-square-foot complex. The building became controversial for appearing to prioritize Asian cultures over others, Computer Associates&#x27; business practices, and Wang&#x27;s close ties to Kenny. The center formally opened on Tuesday, October 22, 2002 with a ceremony from New York governor George Pataki.

== Architecture ==
The building was designed by architect P.H. Tuan of Oyster Bay, New York. The building is made of brick and white translucent glass panels designed to symbolize rice paper, which were used for windows in ancient Asian architecture. An 80-foot octagonal tower protruding from the center of the building&#x27;s roof, which contains 20 roof lights and 56 layers of steel, was designed after an abstract pagoda. In the center&#x27;s outdoor gardens, an arched bridge with steps is reminiscent of Shanghai temples.

On the first floor of the Wang Center is an East Asian food court named Jasmine, which includes dining options such as bibimbap, poke bowls and other Chinese, Japanese and Korean foods. In 2019, a 550-square foot Pan-Asian mini grocery store, the Jasmine Market, opened, selling international grocery items, snacks, and beverages.

== Mission ==

The Charles B. Wang Center initiates and collaborates with academic departments, student groups, community organizations, and individuals in presenting the public with a multifaceted, intellectually sound, and humane understanding of East Asian cultures, and their relationship to other cultures.

The Wang Center is also a presenting venue for events of cultural, professional and intellectual calibre that are initiated by and involve the various components of Stony Brook University, Long Island communities and organizations, as well as other regional, national, and international constituencies. The Wang Center is non-partisan and non-sectarian, and upholds the values of pluralism, democracy, and equality.

== Bridge across cultures ==

The Charles B. Wang Center building is adorned with a 100-foot octagonal pagoda, a structure traditionally associated with Chinese temples. 

Architect PH Tuan has captured Wang&#x27;s ideals in a building resonant with the traditions of East Asian design. Spare gray walls, pierced with three red trellis entrances, invite the visitor to explore the treasures of the interior. Within, Tuan has unified the elements of interior space, the outdoors, and the enclosing sky, using wide expanses of glass to frame traditional East Asian gardens, pools, and bridges. The Center has the capability to link scholars and researchers from all over the world in real time, and it welcomes many cultural and artistic activities, especially those that reflect the cultures of East Asia. Scholars, students, international business people, and East Asian-American communities use the facility to build bridges of understanding, exchange information, and celebrate their cultural identities.

The main ceremonial entrance leads across an ornamental pool into a spacious reception area. The three-story space is filled with natural light and the sound of fountains that flow from 12 Chinese Zodiac sculptures into the south pool. To the north of the lobby is an expansive outdoor garden, while more intimate interior galleries lie west and south. These are designed as a showcase for cultural displays and art exhibitions of varying sizes. A 239-seat theater hosts audiences for the performing arts and other events. Well equipped with conference facilities, the Center holds two mid-sized lecture halls that are wired for laptops and the most current audiovisual presentations.

<text>Patrick Pierre Roger Baudry (born March 6, 1946, in Cameroon) is a retired lieutenant colonel in the French Air Force and a former CNES astronaut. In 1985, he became the second French citizen in space, after Jean-Loup Chrétien, when he flew aboard NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle mission STS-51-G.

==Personal==
Baudry was born in Douala (French Cameroon) and is married with three children from another union. His hobbies include mechanical sports, such as motorcycling and car racing. He also enjoys running marathons, playing squash, skiing, shooting, windsurfing, and sky diving. Baudry is also a wine connaisseur. His parents were part of the French resistance during the Second World War and his family was rewarded the Resistance Medal for their courage and effort during the war.

==Education==
* Prytanée National Militaire, 1967
* French Airforce Academy &quot;École de l&#x27;Air&quot;, 1969

==Experience==
Baudry completed flight training at Salon-de-Provence and Tours, France, receiving his wings in 1970. Served as a fighter pilot in Fighter Squadron 1/11 &quot;Roussillon&quot; on F100 and Jaguar, and completed numerous operational missions in several countries of Africa. He entered the &quot;Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School&quot; at Boscombe Down, England, in 1978, and was awarded the Patuxent Trophy at the completion of the course. He was assigned to the Flight Test Center in Brétigny-sur-Orge, France, in 1979, where he flew various test projects on fighter and attack-type aircraft which included flying the different types of Mirages, Jaguar, and Crusader.

He has logged more than 4,000 hours flying time – 3,300 in jet aircraft – and has flown over 100 different types of aircraft – F-100, F-104, F-4, A-8, T-33, Lightning, Harrier, Hunter, Canberra, Jaguar, all types of Mirages, Mystère 4, Vautour, and other aircraft.

Baudry holds an airline transport pilot license. He worked for some time after his space flight for Airbus as a test pilot, and is now retired in the Aquitaine region.

==CNES experience==
Baudry became a CNES astronaut candidate in June 1980. For two years, he trained at CNES and at Star City near Moscow. He was a member of the back-up crew for the French-Soviet Soyuz T-6 Intercosmos mission and was trained for scientific experiments in the fields of physiology, biology, materials processing in space, and astronomy. Baudry is a CNES expert for crewed space flight activities and participates in the analysis of decisions and study of definition for the future &quot;Hermes&quot; space aircraft.

==Spaceflight experience==

Baudry flew as a payload specialist on STS-51-G Discovery (June 17–24, 1985). STS-51-G was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The international crew aboard Discovery deployed communications satellites for Mexico (Morelos), the Arab League (Arabsat), and the United States (AT&amp;T Telstar). They deployed and later retrieved the SPARTAN satellite, which performed 17 hours of x-ray astronomy experiments while separated from the Space Shuttle. In completing this flight, Baudry traveled 2.5 million miles in 112 Earth orbits, logging over 169 hours in space.

==Organizations==

<text>Jay Daniel Bouwmeester (born September 27, 1983) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman. He played seventeen seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Florida Panthers, Calgary Flames and St. Louis Blues. He was a first round selection, third overall, of the Panthers at the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. He was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team in 2003 and played seven seasons in the Panthers organization before being traded to the Calgary Flames in 2009, with which he played four seasons. Bouwmeester was then traded to the Blues in 2013. He held one of the longest iron man streaks in NHL history as he appeared in 737 consecutive regular season games between 2004 and 2014.

He played in the 2007 and 2009 NHL All-Star Games. Bouwmeester won the Stanley Cup as a member of the Blues in 2019, becoming the twenty-ninth member of the Triple Gold Club.

Internationally, Bouwmeester has represented Canada numerous times. He appeared in three consecutive World Junior Championships between 2000 and 2002, winning a silver and two bronze medals. He made his debut with the senior national team in 2003, winning the first of two consecutive World Championship titles. Bouwmeester was a member of the 2004 World Cup of Hockey championship team and won a gold medal with Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics.

==Early life==
Bouwmeester was born September 27, 1983, in Edmonton, Alberta. He is the son of Dan and Gena Bouwmeester, and has an older sister, Jill. His father is a school teacher and coach in Edmonton, and played defence for the University of Alberta Golden Bears hockey team. Bouwmeester was a naturally gifted player; his father said he could handle a hockey stick at an early age, and learned to skate shortly after he learned to walk. An all-around athlete, Bouwmeester also played baseball and soccer competitively, and ran track, played volleyball and basketball at school. However, he had natural talent for hockey and learned to play on a backyard hockey rink his father maintained and in the basement of the family home. As a youth, he played in the 1996 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Edmonton.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
Bouwmeester played bantam and midget hockey with the Edmonton South Side Athletic Club, winning the Alberta midget championship in 1997–98. He was selected by the Medicine Hat Tigers first overall at the Western Hockey League&#x27;s (WHL) 1998 Bantam Draft, and appeared in eight games with the Tigers in the 1998–99 WHL season.

He joined the Tigers full-time in 1999–2000, scoring 34 points in 64 games as a 16-year-old. His offensive totals improved in his next two WHL seasons: 53 in 2000–01 and 61 in 2001–02. He was named to the WHL&#x27;s East All-Star team, and was considered a candidate to be selected first overall at the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. Instead, he was taken third overall by the Florida Panthers, behind Rick Nash and Kari Lehtonen.

===Florida Panthers===
Bouwmeester made his NHL debut with the Panthers at the start of the 2002–03 Season, and appeared in all 82 games for Florida, a franchise rookie record. He scored his first NHL goal on November 11, 2002, against the Chicago Blackhawks, and finished the season with 4 goals and 16 points. He was named to the 2003 NHL All-Rookie Team on defence.
He improved to 20 points in 61 games in 2003–04, though he missed 18 games with a foot injury. The 2004–05 NHL lockout forced him to play in the American Hockey League (AHL) that season. He joined the Panthers&#x27; AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage, but experienced difficulties adapting to playing in the minor leagues. Despite struggling to generate offence, Bouwmeester participated in the AHL All-Star Game, and was loaned to the Chicago Wolves when it became evident the Rampage would not qualify for the playoffs. Bouwmeester and the Wolves reached the Calder Cup Finals, where they lost to the Philadelphia Phantoms.

Bouwmeester experienced a break-out season after the NHL resumed play in 2005–06, scoring 5 goals, 41 assists and 46 points in 82 games, all career highs, and was invited to join Team Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics in place of injured defenceman Scott Niedermayer. He made news that off-season in his hometown of Edmonton when he was arrested for driving under the influence, a charge he pleaded guilty to the following summer.

Bouwmeester again appeared in all 82 games for the Panthers in 2006–07 and set a new career high with 12 goals. He appeared in his first NHL All-Star Game, representing the Panthers in the game held in Dallas, Texas.

Bouwmeester improved again to 15 goals in 2007–08 while again playing in every game for the Panthers, and led the NHL in average ice time at 27:28 minutes per game. He signed a new one-year, $4.875 million contract as a restricted free agent following the season, turning down the Panthers&#x27; long-term offers in the hopes of becoming an unrestricted free agent at the expiry of his new contract.

Another 15-goal season followed in 2008–09. He played in all 82 games and succeeded Andrew Brunette as the NHL&#x27;s ironman when the latter player was forced out of the Minnesota Wild line-up with injury. He appeared in his second All-Star Game, scoring a goal. As the season approached its end, the Panthers were fighting for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference but were unable to convince Bouwmeester to sign a contract extension. Despite numerous offers from other teams for his services, Florida general manager Jacques Martin chose not to trade Bouwmeester. He and the Panthers struggled to end the season and failed to qualify for the playoffs.

===Calgary Flames===

Unable to come to terms with Bouwmeester, the Panthers traded his negotiating rights to the Calgary Flames in exchange for the negotiating rights to defenceman Jordan Leopold and a third-round draft pick (used to select Josh Birkholz) in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. The trade gave the Flames four days with which they had exclusive rights to negotiate with Bouwmeester before he became an unrestricted free agent and gained the ability to negotiate with any team. Hours before that deadline expired, Bouwmeester and the Flames agreed to a five-year, $33 million contract.

The Flames struggled to score for much of the 2009–10 NHL season, and Bouwmeester was no exception—he finished the year with just three goals and rarely served as an offensive catalyst for Calgary. However, he did not miss a game for the Flames and while his consecutive games played streak sat at 424 following the season, Bouwmeester also held the active record for most games played without reaching the Stanley Cup playoffs, at 553. He continued to score at a rate below his time in Florida, recording 24 points in 2010–11 and 29 in 2011–12. He led the team in ice time both years, averaging nearly 26 minutes per game. Bouwmeester broke the NHL record for consecutive games played by a defenceman on March 15, 2011, when he appeared in his 486th consecutive game, surpassing Kārlis Skrastiņš.

===St. Louis Blues===
Calgary failed to reach the playoffs in both seasons, and while Bouwmeester&#x27;s offensive production increased in the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season—he had 6 goals and 15 points in 33 games for Calgary and again led the team in ice time—he also reached 750 career games without appearing in the playoffs. With the Flames entering a rebuilding phase, Bouwmeester agreed to waive his no-trade clause and accepted a trade on April 1, 2013. He was traded to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for prospects Mark Cundari, Reto Berra and a first-round draft pick in 2013. He described leaving Calgary as &quot;bittersweet&quot;, calling the city a great place to play, but expressed hope he would finally reach the playoffs with the Blues. He achieved this goal after the Blues clinched a playoff spot in their third-last game of the season, and the 762nd of Bouwmeester&#x27;s career. In so doing, he avoided breaking Olli Jokinen&#x27;s NHL record of 799 career games before making his playoff debut (Jokinen was surpassed by Ron Hainsey two years later).

The Blues and Bouwmeester agreed to a five-year, $27 million contract extension prior to the 2013–14 season. He recorded 37 points for the Blues during the season, his highest total since 2008–09 with the Panthers. Bouwmeester&#x27;s iron man streak ended early in the 2014–15 season after he missed the Blues&#x27; November 23, 2014, contest against the Winnipeg Jets. He suffered a &quot;lower body injury&quot; after skating into a rut in the ice in the previous game against the Ottawa Senators. The streak ended at 737 consecutive games, the fifth-longest in NHL history at that date.

After 1,112 career games, Bouwmeester was made a healthy scratch for the first time on October 20, 2018, a 4–1 win against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Bouwmeester returned to the lineup the next game. 
Bouwmeester and the Blues struggled during the first half of the season, ultimately replacing head coach Mike Yeo with Craig Berube, but had a late-season turnaround and ultimately clinched a playoff berth on March 29, 2019. On April 8, 2019, the Blues re-signed Bouwmeester (a pending unrestricted free agent) to a one-year, $3.25 million contract extension. The Blues late-season turnaround culminated with a victory in the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals, the first in the St. Louis Blues&#x27; 52-year history. Bouwmeester recorded seven assists in 26 playoff games while averaging nearly 25 minutes of ice time per game. Now having won the Stanley Cup, Bouwmeester became the twenty-ninth member of the Triple Gold Club, having won two gold medals in World Championships and an Olympic gold medal previously.

====In-game cardiac arrest and retirement====
On February 11, 2020, during the first period of a game versus the Anaheim Ducks at the Honda Center in Anaheim, Bouwmeester went into cardiac arrest and collapsed on the bench during a television time out following a long shift with the score tied 1–1 at the time. The remainder of the game (which was a 4–2 win for St. Louis) was played on March 11. On February 14, 2020, Bouwmeester had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) procedure to restore his heart&#x27;s normal rhythm.

Similar incidents have been seen in the NHL in the 21st century. Jiří Fischer of the Detroit Red Wings suffered a cardiac arrest on the bench during a game in November 2005, and Rich Peverley, at the time a member of the Dallas Stars, also suffered a cardiac arrest on the bench during a game in March 2014. In November 2016, Craig Cunningham collapsed from cardiac arrest during a pre-game skate while playing for the Arizona Coyotes&#x27; AHL affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners. All three players survived the incidents.

Bouwmeester officially announced his retirement from hockey on January 11, 2021, exactly 11 months after his cardiac arrest incident.

==International play==






Bouwmeester played in three World Junior Championships with the Canadian junior team. He became the youngest player to ever represent Canada at the tournament when he won a bronze medal at the 2000 tournament at the age of 16 years, 3 months. He recorded two assists in 2001 as Canada won another bronze medal. In 2002, Bouwmeester and the Canadian team won the silver medal, losing the championship game to Russia, 5–4.

Bouwmeester&#x27;s first appearance with the senior team came at the 2003 World Championships. He finished second in scoring amongst defencemen with seven points, and was named the tournament&#x27;s best defenceman and an all-star as he helped Canada win the gold medal. Bouwmeester won a second gold medal at the 2004 World Championship, contributing three points in nine games. He scored the championship winning goal in a 5–3 victory over Sweden. He was a late addition to Canada&#x27;s entry at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, invited to replace the injured Chris Pronger. He appeared in four games as Canada won the tournament.

Bouwmeester again joined the team as an injury replacement at the 2006 Winter Olympics after Scott Niedermayer was forced out of the tournament. He appeared in six games, scoring no points, as Canada lost in the quarter-finals. Bouwmeester appeared again with the national team at the 2008 World Championship. He played in all nine games, settling for the silver medal after Russia defeated Canada in the final.

Bouwmeester participated in Canada&#x27;s summer camp in advance of the 2010 Winter Olympics, but his struggles in the weeks leading up the team being announced resulted in his being left off the final roster. However, he was selected as a reserve by Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics should an injury occur during the tournament. Bouwmeester played in all six of Canada&#x27;s games at the 2014 Winter Olympics, contributing one assist and winning the gold medal.

==Playing style==
Bouwmeester is best known for his skating ability. His coach with the Medicine Hat Tigers, Rick Carriere, said his ability to move the puck up the ice and score meant Bouwmeester could have played in the NHL at the age of 15. He is a capable offensive player from his defensive position and frequently joined offensive rushes while with Florida, but failed to do so as often in his first season in Calgary, resulting in much lower offensive output. In his later seasons with St. Louis, Bouwmeester was used mostly as a stay-at-home defensemen and recorded less offensive output. One criticism of Bouwmeester’s game is his lack of physicality despite his large size. Commentator Ken Campbell argued it has prevented him from becoming one of the game&#x27;s elite defencemen. During the 2008-09 season, Bouwmeester registered 69 hits, which ranked last among defensemen who logged more than 25 minutes of ice-time per game. He is frequently among the NHL leaders in ice time per game and one of the most durable.

<text>Charles Eldon Brady Jr. (August 12, 1951 – July 23, 2006) was an American physician, a captain in the United States Navy and a NASA astronaut. He spent 16 days in space on the Space Shuttle&#x27;s STS-78 flight in 1996.

Brady specialized in sports medicine and worked as team physician at several universities before joining the US Navy in 1986. There he became a flight surgeon, serving with the Blue Angels flight demonstration squad from 1988–1990. In 1992 he was selected for NASA&#x27;s astronaut program and completed training to prepare for space flight. After serving in the astronaut program, he returned full-time to the Navy and served as flight surgeon at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in the San Juan Islands before retiring in the Pacific Northwest.

==Early life and education==
Brady was born in Pinehurst, North Carolina, to Ann and Charles Brady, Sr. He grew up in the small town of Robbins, where his father was a physician. Brady attended local public schools, graduating from North Moore High School in Robbins in 1969. He had become an Eagle Scout and received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.

Brady studied pre-med at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1971. He received his medical degree from Duke University in 1975. From Duke, he went to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville for his internship.

==Career==
In 1978 Brady started as the team physician in sports medicine for Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. He continued in sports medicine and family practice for the next seven years, working as a team physician at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina.

===Military career===
He joined the U.S. Navy in 1986, receiving training as a flight surgeon at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. In June 1986 Brady reported to Carrier Air Wing Two on board the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Ranger&quot;; he was assigned to Attack Squadron 145 (VA-145) and Aviation Electronic Countermeasures Squadron 131 (VAQ-131).

In 1988 Brady was selected for the Blue Angels, the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, and served with them as flight surgeon through 1990. He was serving in Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 129 (VAQ-129) when he learned he had been selected for the astronaut program.

===NASA career===
Brady was selected by NASA in March 1992 and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He was qualified for selection as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. Technical assignments included: working technical issues for the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch; flight software testing in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); astronaut representative to the Human Research Policy and Procedures Committee; deputy chief for Space Shuttle astronaut training; and chief for Space Station astronaut training in the Mission Operations Division. He flew on STS-78 in 1996 and logged over 405 hours, more than 16 days, in space.

As an astronaut and amateur radio enthusiast, callsign N4BQW, Brady was one of the pioneers of the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX), and a member of the American Radio Relay League.

====STS-78====
STS-78 launched on June 20, 1996, and landed 16 days and 21 hours later on July 7, 1996, becoming the longest Space Shuttle mission to date. (Later that year the STS-80 mission broke that record by nineteen hours). The Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission served as a model for future studies on board the International Space Station. The mission included studies sponsored by ten nations, and five space agencies, and the international crew included a Frenchman, a Canadian, a Spaniard, and an Italian.

While with NASA, Brady held a number of jobs with the agency&#x27;s astronaut office. He was chief of space station astronaut training before leaving to return to Navy duty, where he reached the rank of captain. He enjoyed canoeing, kayaking, tennis, biking, and amateur radio operating.

==Later years==
In 2000, Brady was assigned as flight surgeon to Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in Washington state. He retired from the Navy in March 2006, after suffering for years from a severe kind of arthritis. He had enjoyed an active outdoor life and made several expeditions with a ham radio group to small islands in the South Pacific.
Brady died on July 23, 2006. He was survived by his fiancée, Susen Oseth, their son, Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Brady III, his mother Ann Brady, and sister Jery Ann Kennedy. His father was deceased. When NASA announced his death, it said he had suffered from a lengthy illness, and this was reported by most major sources. A few days later, the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; reported the county sheriff&#x27;s statement that Brady had died of self-inflicted wounds after suffering a long illness related to arthritis. He was buried near his father in Robbins, North Carolina.

It was not until a year later, in the context of reporting on other astronauts, that the media reported more widely that Brady had committed suicide. NASA internal emails related to Brady, which were released under the Freedom of Information Act, documented health issues and noted there was an investigation of his suicide, including interviews with family and friends.

<text>Three Men and a Baby is a 1987 American comedy film directed by Leonard Nimoy. It stars Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg, and Ted Danson as three bachelors as they attempt to adapt their lives to de facto fatherhood with the arrival of the love child of one of the men. The script was based on the 1985 French film &quot;Trois hommes et un couffin&quot;.

The film was the biggest American box office hit of that year, surpassing &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; and eventually grossing $167 million in the United States and Canada and $240 million worldwide. The film won the 1988 People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Comedy Motion Picture. The film had received a sequel &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady&quot; (1990), which also featured Selleck, Guttenberg and Danson. A remake was announced in for Disney+ with Zac Efron among the cast.

==Plot==
Architect Peter Mitchell, cartoonist Michael Kellam, and actor Jack Holden are happy bachelors in their shared New York apartment, with frequent parties and flings while decorating the . The movie begins with Peter celebrating his birthday, the next day, a baby named Mary arrives on the trios doorstep with a note revealing she is the result of Jack&#x27;s with an actress named Sylvia during a Stratford Festival Shakespearean production a year prior.

Jack is in Turkey shooting a B movie, and makes arrangements with a director friend to have a package delivered to the apartment. Jack asks his roommates to keep the delivery a secret per his friend&#x27;s wishes; when Mary arrives, they believe she is the &quot;package&quot;.

Peter and Michael are totally befuddled how to care for Mary, and Peter leaves to buy supplies. Their landlady Mrs. Hathaway delivers a small box – the actual &quot;package&quot; of heroin – which Michael tosses aside. They learn to care for Mary, including diaper changes, baths, and feedings. Peter tries to get help from his on/off girlfriend, Rebecca, but she showed no interest. Taking care of her has even interfered in their daily work schedule.

Four days later, two drug dealers arrive at the apartment for the package. Peter and Michael mistakenly give them Mary, along with a can of powdered milk the dealers believe is the heroin. Peter discovers the actual package; realizing the mix-up, he runs downstairs but trips, spilling the package&#x27;s contents. He gathers up the drugs and confronts the men outside, causing a scuffle. A police officer on horseback intervenes; Peter rescues Mary, but the dealers flee with the can of powdered milk. The officer detains Peter and Michael at the apartment until Sgt. Melkowitz, a narcotics officer, arrives to question them. Jack calls from Turkey, but Peter and Michael are unable to talk openly as they are being recorded. They successfully hide the drugs, learning that Jack&#x27;s friend Paul Milner is a drug dealer. A suspicious Melkowitz puts them under surveillance.

Mrs. Hathaway babysits Mary while Peter and Michael go to work. Returning home, they find Mrs. Hathaway bound and gagged and the apartment ransacked by the dealers, but Mary safe; a note threatens, &quot;Next time we&#x27;ll take the baby&quot;. Peter and Michael continue to care for Mary, adjusting to &#x27;fatherhood&#x27; and growing attached.

Peter incapacitates an intruder late at night, who turns out to be Jack, returning early after his movie role was cut. Jack assures Peter and Michael he knew nothing about the heroin or Milners dealings. He initially denies his connection to Mary, but Sylvia&#x27;s note convinces him he is Mary&#x27;s father. Peter and Michael, now competent caregivers, are exhausted and frustrated from their around the clock babysitting, and pass all duties to a bewildered Jack, refusing to help him. Jack tries to get help from his mother, but she refuses him. After letting Jack suffer for a while, Michael and Peter help him, and together the three bachelors share babysitting duties. They even installed a telephone in their bathroom shower after failing to contact Jack the first time.

Later they receive a news clipping in the mail – Milner has been attacked by the drug dealers and hospitalized – with another threat: &quot;Don&#x27;t let this happen to you!&quot; Peter, Michael, and Jack formulate a plan to trap the dealers, arranging a meeting. Jack, disguised as a pregnant woman, leaves the building with Mary, while Peter and Michael leave in a cab, followed by undercover officers, but manage to lose them in another cab driven by Jack. Peter meets with the dealers at the top floor of a construction site while Jack is manning the power breakers to the elevators and watching Mary. Michael, hidden in the vents, records Peter&#x27;s conversation with the dealers but loses his balance and falls into the room, and a chase ensues. They manage to trap the dealers in an elevator as the police arrive. With the recording, they prove their innocence to Melkowitz, and the dealers are arrested.

Peter, Michael, and Jack fully embrace their role as Mary&#x27;s guardians, until Sylvia arrives to take Mary with her to London. After she leaves with Mary, the three realize how desperately they miss the baby. Racing to the airport, they just miss Sylvia&#x27;s plane for London. Defeated, they return home to find Sylvia and Mary at their doorstep. Sylvia tearfully says she doesn&#x27;t want to give up acting but must if she has to raise Mary alone. They invite her and Mary to move in; she accepts, and the four live happily with the baby. They even added a new mural to their front entrance with the front pushing a stroller with Mary in it.

==Cast==
==Production==
Mary was played by twins Lisa and Michelle Blair.

The soundtrack included the Peter Cetera song &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Girl&quot;, which was used for the movie&#x27;s big music montage sequence, the Miami Sound Machine song &quot;Bad Boy&quot;, which opened it, and the John Parr song &quot;The Minute I Saw You&quot;, which ended the film.

==Urban legend==

Just over an hour into the final cut of the film, there is a scene that shows Jack and his mother (played by Celeste Holm) walking through the home with Mary. As they do so, they pass a background window on the left-hand side of the screen, and a black outline that appears to resemble a rifle pointed downward can be seen behind the curtains. As they walk back past the window 40 seconds later, a human figure can be seen in that window. A persistent urban legend began circulating August 1990 (shortly before the sequel, &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady&quot;, premiered) that this was the ghost of a boy who had been killed in the house where the film (or this scene) was filmed. The most common version of this myth was that a nine-year-old boy committed suicide with a shotgun there, explaining why it was vacant: because the grieving family left. This notion was discussed on the first episode of &quot;TV Land: Myths and Legends&quot; in January 2007, and was referenced in &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;, a second-season episode of the TV series &quot;Supernatural&quot;.

The ghost rumours were widely believed for years, and the image, though chilling in retrospect, was taken out of context. This serves as a testament to how a ghost story can become exaggerated over time and ultimately accepted as truth.

The figure is actually a cardboard cutout &quot;standee&quot; of Jack, wearing a tuxedo and top hat, that was left on the set. It was created as part of the storyline, in which he, an actor, appears in a dog food commercial, but this portion was cut from the final version of the film. The standee does show up later in the film, when Jack stands next to it as Sylvia comes to reclaim Mary. Snopes.com contends that the one in the first scene looks smaller than it does in the later scene because of the distance and angle of the shot, and because the curtains obscure its outstretched arms. As for the contention that a boy died in the house, all the indoor scenes were shot on a Toronto sound stage, and no kind of residential dwellings were used for interior filming.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The critical response to &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; was generally positive. On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 67% based on reviews from 70 critics, and an average rating of 5.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Like the French farce it&#x27;s based on, &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; is too self-satisfied with scatalogical humor to qualify as a bundle of joy, but the role of makeshift daddy brings out the best in Tom Selleck&quot;. Metacritic gave the film a score of 61 based on 16 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, despite noting several aspects he saw as flaws, praised the film, remarking: &quot;Because of Selleck and his co-stars... the movie becomes a heartwarming entertainment&quot;. He gave it 3 (out of four) stars. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;this story is about four babies, not just one&quot; and &quot;the film bubbles along in a funny if predictable way, with a lot more gags than the earlier film managed&quot;.

===Box office===
The film opened in theaters on Wednesday, November 25, 1987. It grossed $168 million in the United States and Canada and $72 million internationally for a worldwide gross of $240 million. It was notable for the Walt Disney Studios since it was the first production from the studio to gross over $100 million domestically in its initial run and its highest-grossing film at the time until surpassed in 1990 by &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. It was the highest-grossing film of 1987 domestically, with an estimated 42 million tickets sold in the US.

==Legacy==
The film was followed by a 1990 sequel titled &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady&quot; which also featuring Selleck, Guttenberg and Danson. Guttenberg spoke about the two films in 2023, saying he felt the first was the strongest of the two films.

Selleck said in 2010, Disney had spoken to him about a potential third film tentatively titled &quot;Three Men and a Bride&quot;. Selleck later mentioned in 2013 that the third film &quot;seemed to be real, and then it disappeared.&quot; while a Disney spokesman said that a new &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; entry was in development as of 2013.
A remake was announced in 2020 for the Disney+ streaming service with Zac Efron set to be in the cast. Maurice &quot;Mo&quot; Marable was chosen to direct the reboot in January 2021. Marable stated than when &quot;you go back and you watch the original &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; you go, &quot;times have changed.&quot;&quot; Marable continued that &quot;guys are not as stupid as they were back in the day. The cast will be very diverse, that&#x27;s the only way I would do it. As of 2023, Marable was still set to direct the remake as his first feature film.

When asked about a reboot of the series, Guttenberg responded that he was not excited about it, saying that the audiences would prefer a sequel as they wanted to be reminded of a &quot;better time. When you see a sequel, it reminds you what happened before. And you can come back to that.&quot;

===Adaptations===
While direct inspiration has never been confirmed, the television show &quot;Baby Daddy&quot;, an American sitcom that premiered in 2012 on ABC Family, has been compared to the film.

This film also served as inspiration for other adaptations, and was remade in several regions:
* &quot;Balache Baap Brahmachari&quot; (1989) Marathi film
* &quot;Thoovalsparsham&quot; (1990) in Malayalam
* &quot;Chinnari Muddula Papa&quot; (1990) in Telugu
* &quot;Thayamma&quot; (1991) in Tamil
* &quot;Asathal&quot; (2001) in Tamil
* &quot;Heyy Babyy&quot; (2007) in Hindi
* &quot;3 Dads&quot; (2017) in Japanese

<text>A recommender system (RecSys), or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing &quot;system&quot; with terms such as &quot;platform&quot;, &quot;engine&quot;, or &quot;algorithm&quot;), is a subclass of information filtering system that provides suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user. Recommender systems are particularly useful when an individual needs to choose an item from a potentially overwhelming number of items that a service may offer.

Typically, the suggestions refer to various decision-making processes, such as what product to purchase, what music to listen to, or what online news to read.
Recommender systems are used in a variety of areas, with commonly recognised examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services, product recommenders for online stores, or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders. These systems can operate using a single type of input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books and search queries. There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating. Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators, and financial services.

A content discovery platform is an implemented software recommendation platform which uses recommender system tools. It utilizes user metadata in order to discover and recommend appropriate content, whilst reducing ongoing maintenance and development costs. A content discovery platform delivers personalized content to websites, mobile devices and set-top boxes. A large range of content discovery platforms currently exist for various forms of content ranging from news articles and academic journal articles to television. As operators compete to be the gateway to home entertainment, personalized television is a key service differentiator. Academic content discovery has recently become another area of interest, with several companies being established to help academic researchers keep up to date with relevant academic content and serendipitously discover new content.

== Overview ==
Recommender systems usually make use of either or both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, as well as other systems such as knowledge-based systems. Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user&#x27;s past behavior (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in. Content-based filtering approaches utilize a series of discrete, pre-tagged characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties.

The differences between collaborative and content-based filtering can be demonstrated by comparing two early music recommender systems, Last.fm and Pandora Radio.
* Last.fm creates a &quot;station&quot; of recommended songs by observing what bands and individual tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those against the listening behavior of other users. Last.fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user&#x27;s library, but are often played by other users with similar interests. As this approach leverages the behavior of users, it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique.
* Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist (a subset of the 400 attributes provided by the Music Genome Project) to seed a &quot;station&quot; that plays music with similar properties. User feedback is used to refine the station&#x27;s results, deemphasizing certain attributes when a user &quot;dislikes&quot; a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user &quot;likes&quot; a song. This is an example of a content-based approach.

Each type of system has its strengths and weaknesses. In the above example, Last.fm requires a large amount of information about a user to make accurate recommendations. This is an example of the cold start problem, and is common in collaborative filtering systems. Whereas Pandora needs very little information to start, it is far more limited in scope (for example, it can only make recommendations that are similar to the original seed).

Recommender systems are a useful alternative to search algorithms since they help users discover items they might not have found otherwise. Of note, recommender systems are often implemented using search engines indexing non-traditional data.

Recommender systems have been the focus of several granted patents, and there are more than 50 software libraries that support the development of recommender systems including LensKit, RecBole, ReChorus and RecPack.

== History ==

Elaine Rich created the first recommender system in 1979, called Grundy. She looked for a way to recommend users books they might like. Her idea was to create a system that asks users specific questions and classifies them into classes of preferences, or &quot;stereotypes&quot;, depending on their answers. Depending on users&#x27; stereotype membership, they would then get recommendations for books they might like.

Another early recommender system, called a &quot;digital bookshelf&quot;, was described in a 1990 technical report by Jussi Karlgren at Columbia University,

and implemented at scale and worked through in technical reports and publications from 1994 onwards by Jussi Karlgren, then at SICS,
and research groups led by Pattie Maes at MIT, Will Hill at Bellcore, and Paul Resnick, also at MIT, whose work with GroupLens was awarded the 2010 ACM Software Systems Award.

Montaner provided the first overview of recommender systems from an intelligent agent perspective. Adomavicius provided a new, alternate overview of recommender systems. Herlocker provides an additional overview of evaluation techniques for recommender systems, and Beel et al. discussed the problems of offline evaluations. Beel et al. have also provided literature surveys on available research paper recommender systems and existing challenges.

== Approaches ==

=== Collaborative filtering ===
One approach to the design of recommender systems that has wide use is collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past. The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items. By locating peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current user or item, they generate recommendations using this neighborhood. Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model-based. A well-known example of memory-based approaches is the user-based algorithm, while that of model-based approaches is matrix factorization (recommender systems).

A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an &quot;understanding&quot; of the item itself. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems. For example, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) approach and the Pearson Correlation as first implemented by Allen.

When building a model from a user&#x27;s behavior, a distinction is often made between explicit and implicit forms of data collection.

Examples of explicit data collection include the following:
* Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.
* Asking a user to search.
* Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.
* Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them.
* Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes (see &quot;Rocchio classification&quot; or other similar techniques).

Examples of implicit data collection include the following:
* Observing the items that a user views in an online store.
* Analyzing item/user viewing times.
* Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online.
* Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer.
* Analyzing the user&#x27;s social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes.

Collaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems: cold start, scalability, and sparsity.
* Cold start: For a new user or item, there is not enough data to make accurate recommendations. Note: one commonly implemented solution to this problem is the multi-armed bandit algorithm.
* Scalability: There are millions of users and products in many of the environments in which these systems make recommendations. Thus, a large amount of computation power is often necessary to calculate recommendations.
* Sparsity: The number of items sold on major e-commerce sites is extremely large. The most active users will only have rated a small subset of the overall database. Thus, even the most popular items have very few ratings.

One of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y), an algorithm popularized by Amazon.com&#x27;s recommender system.

Many social networks originally used collaborative filtering to recommend new friends, groups, and other social connections by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends. Collaborative filtering is still used as part of hybrid systems.

=== Content-based filtering ===

Another common approach when designing recommender systems is content-based filtering. Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user&#x27;s preferences. These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user&#x27;s likes and dislikes based on an item&#x27;s features.

In this system, keywords are used to describe the items, and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items similar to those that a user liked in the past or is examining in the present. It does not rely on a user sign-in mechanism to generate this often temporary profile. In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user, and the best-matching items are recommended. This approach has its roots in information retrieval and information filtering research.

To create a user profile, the system mostly focuses on two types of information:

# A model of the user&#x27;s preference.
# A history of the user&#x27;s interaction with the recommender system.

Basically, these methods use an item profile (i.e., a set of discrete attributes and features) characterizing the item within the system. To abstract the features of the items in the system, an item presentation algorithm is applied. A widely used algorithm is the tf–idf representation (also called vector space representation). The system creates a content-based profile of users based on a weighted vector of item features. The weights denote the importance of each feature to the user and can be computed from individually rated content vectors using a variety of techniques. Simple approaches use the average values of the rated item vector while other sophisticated methods use machine learning techniques such as Bayesian Classifiers, cluster analysis, decision trees, and artificial neural networks in order to estimate the probability that the user is going to like the item.

A key issue with content-based filtering is whether the system can learn user preferences from users&#x27; actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types. When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using, the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended. For example, recommending news articles based on news browsing is useful. Still, it would be much more useful when music, videos, products, discussions, etc., from different services, can be recommended based on news browsing. To overcome this, most content-based recommender systems now use some form of the hybrid system.

Content-based recommender systems can also include opinion-based recommender systems. In some cases, users are allowed to leave text reviews or feedback on the items. These user-generated texts are implicit data for the recommender system because they are potentially rich resources of both feature/aspects of the item and users&#x27; evaluation/sentiment to the item. Features extracted from the user-generated reviews are improved metadata of items, because as they also reflect aspects of the item like metadata, extracted features are widely concerned by the users. Sentiments extracted from the reviews can be seen as users&#x27; rating scores on the corresponding features. Popular approaches of opinion-based recommender system utilize various techniques including text mining, information retrieval, sentiment analysis (see also Multimodal sentiment analysis) and deep learning.

=== Hybrid recommendations approaches ===

Most recommender systems now use a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and other approaches. There is no reason why several different techniques of the same type could not be hybridized. Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways: by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them; by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa); or by unifying the approaches into one model. Several studies that empirically compared the performance of the hybrid with the pure collaborative and content-based methods and demonstrated that the hybrid methods can provide more accurate recommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem, as well as the knowledge engineering bottleneck in knowledge-based approaches.

Netflix is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems. The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).

Some hybridization techniques include:
*Weighted: Combining the score of different recommendation components numerically.
*Switching: Choosing among recommendation components and applying the selected one.
*Mixed: Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation.
*Cascade: Recommenders are given strict priority, with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones.
*Meta-level: One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model, which is then the input used by the next technique.

==Technologies==

=== Session-based recommender systems ===
These recommender systems use the interactions of a user within a session to generate recommendations. Session-based recommender systems are used at YouTube and Amazon. These are particularly useful when history (such as past clicks, purchases) of a user is not available or not relevant in the current user session. Domains, where session-based recommendations are particularly relevant, include video, e-commerce, travel, music and more. Most instances of session-based recommender systems rely on the sequence of recent interactions within a session without requiring any additional details (historical, demographic) of the user. Techniques for session-based recommendations are mainly based on generative sequential models such as recurrent neural networks, transformers, and other deep-learning-based approaches.

=== Reinforcement learning for recommender systems ===

The recommendation problem can be seen as a special instance of a reinforcement learning problem whereby the user is the environment upon which the agent, the recommendation system acts upon in order to receive a reward, for instance, a click or engagement by the user. One aspect of reinforcement learning that is of particular use in the area of recommender systems is the fact that the models or policies can be learned by providing a reward to the recommendation agent. This is in contrast to traditional learning techniques which rely on supervised learning approaches that are less flexible, reinforcement learning recommendation techniques allow to potentially train models that can be optimized directly on metrics of engagement, and user interest.

=== Multi-criteria recommender systems ===
Multi-criteria recommender systems (MCRS) can be defined as recommender systems that incorporate preference information upon multiple criteria. Instead of developing recommendation techniques based on a single criterion value, the overall preference of user u for the item i, these systems try to predict a rating for unexplored items of u by exploiting preference information on multiple criteria that affect this overall preference value. Several researchers approach MCRS as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and apply MCDM methods and techniques to implement MCRS systems. See this chapter for an extended introduction.

=== Risk-aware recommender systems ===
The majority of existing approaches to recommender systems focus on recommending the most relevant content to users using contextual information, yet do not take into account the risk of disturbing the user with unwanted notifications. It is important to consider the risk of upsetting the user by pushing recommendations in certain circumstances, for instance, during a professional meeting, early morning, or late at night. Therefore, the performance of the recommender system depends in part on the degree to which it has incorporated the risk into the recommendation process. One option to manage this issue is &quot;DRARS&quot;, a system which models the context-aware recommendation as a bandit problem. This system combines a content-based technique and a contextual bandit algorithm.

=== Mobile recommender systems ===

Mobile recommender systems make use of internet-accessing smartphones to offer personalized, context-sensitive recommendations. This is a particularly difficult area of research as mobile data is more complex than data that recommender systems often have to deal with. It is heterogeneous, noisy, requires spatial and temporal auto-correlation, and has validation and generality problems.

There are three factors that could affect the mobile recommender systems and the accuracy of prediction results: the context, the recommendation method and privacy. Additionally, mobile recommender systems suffer from a transplantation problem – recommendations may not apply in all regions (for instance, it would be unwise to recommend a recipe in an area where all of the ingredients may not be available).

One example of a mobile recommender system are the approaches taken by companies such as Uber and Lyft to generate driving routes for taxi drivers in a city. This system uses GPS data of the routes that taxi drivers take while working, which includes location (latitude and longitude), time stamps, and operational status (with or without passengers). It uses this data to recommend a list of pickup points along a route, with the goal of optimizing occupancy times and profits.

=== Generative recommenders ===
Generative recommenders (GR) represent an approach that transforms recommendation tasks into sequential transduction problems, where user actions are treated like tokens in a generative modeling framework. In one method, known as HSTU (Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Units), high-cardinality, non-stationary, and streaming datasets are efficiently processed as sequences, enabling the model to learn from trillions of parameters and to handle user action histories orders of magnitude longer than before. By turning all of the system’s varied data into a single stream of tokens and using a custom self-attention approach instead of traditional neural network layers, generative recommenders make the model much simpler and less memory-hungry. As a result, it can improve recommendation quality in test simulations and in real-world tests, while being faster than previous Transformer-based systems when handling long lists of user actions. Ultimately, this approach allows the model’s performance to grow steadily as more computing power is used, laying a foundation for efficient and scalable “foundation models” for recommendations.

== The Netflix Prize ==
One of the events that energized research in recommender systems was the Netflix Prize. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix sponsored a competition, offering a grand prize of $1,000,000 to the team that could take an offered dataset of over 100 million movie ratings and return recommendations that were 10% more accurate than those offered by the company&#x27;s existing recommender system. This competition energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms. On 21 September 2009, the grand prize of US$1,000,000 was given to the BellKor&#x27;s Pragmatic Chaos team using tiebreaking rules.

The most accurate algorithm in 2007 used an ensemble method of 107 different algorithmic approaches, blended into a single prediction. As stated by the winners, Bell et al.:

Predictive accuracy is substantially improved when blending multiple predictors. &quot;Our experience is that most efforts should be concentrated in deriving substantially different approaches, rather than refining a single technique.&quot; Consequently, our solution is an ensemble of many methods.

Many benefits accrued to the web due to the Netflix project. Some teams have taken their technology and applied it to other markets. Some members from the team that finished second place founded Gravity R&amp;D, a recommendation engine that&#x27;s active in the RecSys community. 4-Tell, Inc. created a Netflix project–derived solution for ecommerce websites.

A number of privacy issues arose around the dataset offered by Netflix for the Netflix Prize competition. Although the data sets were anonymized in order to preserve customer privacy, in 2007 two researchers from the University of Texas were able to identify individual users by matching the data sets with film ratings on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). As a result, in December 2009, an anonymous Netflix user sued Netflix in Doe v. Netflix, alleging that Netflix had violated United States fair trade laws and the Video Privacy Protection Act by releasing the datasets. This, as well as concerns from the Federal Trade Commission, led to the cancellation of a second Netflix Prize competition in 2010.

== Evaluation ==
=== Performance measures ===
Evaluation is important in assessing the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms. To measure the effectiveness of recommender systems, and compare different approaches, three types of evaluations are available: user studies, online evaluations (A/B tests), and offline evaluations.

The commonly used metrics are the mean squared error and root mean squared error, the latter having been used in the Netflix Prize. The information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall or DCG are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method. Diversity, novelty, and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation. However, many of the classic evaluation measures are highly criticized.

Evaluating the performance of a recommendation algorithm on a fixed test dataset will always be extremely challenging as it is impossible to accurately predict the reactions of real users to the recommendations. Hence any metric that computes the effectiveness of an algorithm in offline data will be imprecise.

User studies are rather a small scale. A few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches, and then the users judge which recommendations are best.

In A/B tests, recommendations are shown to typically thousands of users of a real product, and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations. The effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as conversion rate or click-through rate.

Offline evaluations are based on historic data, e.g. a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies.

The effectiveness of recommendation approaches is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users&#x27; ratings in the dataset. While a rating is an explicit expression of whether a user liked a movie, such information is not available in all domains. For instance, in the domain of citation recommender systems, users typically do not rate a citation or recommended article. In such cases, offline evaluations may use implicit measures of effectiveness. For instance, it may be assumed that a recommender system is effective that is able to recommend as many articles as possible that are contained in a research article&#x27;s reference list. However, this kind of offline evaluations is seen critical by many researchers. For instance, it has been shown that results of offline evaluations have low correlation with results from user studies or A/B tests. A dataset popular for offline evaluation has been shown to contain duplicate data and thus to lead to wrong conclusions in the evaluation of algorithms. Often, results of so-called offline evaluations do not correlate with actually assessed user-satisfaction. This is probably because offline training is highly biased toward the highly reachable items, and offline testing data is highly influenced by the outputs of the online recommendation module. Researchers have concluded that the results of offline evaluations should be viewed critically.

=== Beyond accuracy ===
Typically, research on recommender systems is concerned with finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms. However, there are a number of factors that are also important.

*Diversity – Users tend to be more satisfied with recommendations when there is a higher intra-list diversity, e.g. items from different artists.

*Recommender persistence – In some situations, it is more effective to re-show recommendations, or let users re-rate items, than showing new items. There are several reasons for this. Users may ignore items when they are shown for the first time, for instance, because they had no time to inspect the recommendations carefully.
*Privacy – Recommender systems usually have to deal with privacy concerns because users have to reveal sensitive information. Building user profiles using collaborative filtering can be problematic from a privacy point of view. Many European countries have a strong culture of data privacy, and every attempt to introduce any level of user profiling can result in a negative customer response. Much research has been conducted on ongoing privacy issues in this space. The Netflix Prize is particularly notable for the detailed personal information released in its dataset. Ramakrishnan et al. have conducted an extensive overview of the trade-offs between personalization and privacy and found that the combination of weak ties (an unexpected connection that provides serendipitous recommendations) and other data sources can be used to uncover identities of users in an anonymized dataset.

*User demographics – Beel et al. found that user demographics may influence how satisfied users are with recommendations. In their paper they show that elderly users tend to be more interested in recommendations than younger users.
*Robustness – When users can participate in the recommender system, the issue of fraud must be addressed.
*Serendipity – Serendipity is a measure of &quot;how surprising the recommendations are&quot;. For instance, a recommender system that recommends milk to a customer in a grocery store might be perfectly accurate, but it is not a good recommendation because it is an obvious item for the customer to buy. &quot;[Serendipity] serves two purposes: First, the chance that users lose interest because the choice set is too uniform decreases. Second, these items are needed for algorithms to learn and improve themselves&quot;.
*Trust – A recommender system is of little value for a user if the user does not trust the system. Trust can be built by a recommender system by explaining how it generates recommendations, and why it recommends an item.
*Labelling – User satisfaction with recommendations may be influenced by the labeling of the recommendations. For instance, in the cited study click-through rate (CTR) for recommendations labeled as &quot;Sponsored&quot; were lower (CTR=5.93%) than CTR for identical recommendations labeled as &quot;Organic&quot; (CTR=8.86%). Recommendations with no label performed best (CTR=9.87%) in that study.

=== Reproducibility ===
Recommender systems are notoriously difficult to evaluate offline, with some researchers claiming that this has led to a reproducibility crisis in recommender systems publications. The topic of reproducibility seems to be a recurrent issue in some Machine Learning publication venues, but does not have a considerable effect beyond the world of scientific publication. In the context of recommender systems a 2019 paper surveyed a small number of hand-picked publications applying deep learning or neural methods to the top-k recommendation problem, published in top conferences (SIGIR, KDD, WWW, RecSys, IJCAI), has shown that on average less than 40% of articles could be reproduced by the authors of the survey, with as little as 14% in some conferences. The articles considers a number of potential problems in today&#x27;s research scholarship and suggests improved scientific practices in that area.
More recent work on benchmarking a set of the same methods came to qualitatively very different results whereby neural methods were found to be among the best performing methods. Deep learning and neural methods for recommender systems have been used in the winning solutions in several recent recommender system challenges, WSDM, RecSys Challenge.
Moreover, neural and deep learning methods are widely used in industry where they are extensively tested. The topic of reproducibility is not new in recommender systems. By 2011, Ekstrand, Konstan, et al. criticized that &quot;it is currently difficult to reproduce and extend recommender systems research results,&quot; and that evaluations are &quot;not handled consistently&quot;. Konstan and Adomavicius conclude that &quot;the Recommender Systems research community is facing a crisis where a significant number of papers present results that contribute little to collective knowledge [...] often because the research lacks the [...] evaluation to be properly judged and, hence, to provide meaningful contributions.&quot; As a consequence, much research about recommender systems can be considered as not reproducible. Hence, operators of recommender systems find little guidance in the current research for answering the question, which recommendation approaches to use in a recommender systems. Said and Bellogín conducted a study of papers published in the field, as well as benchmarked some of the most popular frameworks for recommendation and found large inconsistencies in results, even when the same algorithms and data sets were used. Some researchers demonstrated that minor variations in the recommendation algorithms or scenarios led to strong changes in the effectiveness of a recommender system. They conclude that seven actions are necessary to improve the current situation: &quot;(1) survey other research fields and learn from them, (2) find a common understanding of reproducibility, (3) identify and understand the determinants that affect reproducibility, (4) conduct more comprehensive experiments (5) modernize publication practices, (6) foster the development and use of recommendation frameworks, and (7) establish best-practice guidelines for recommender-systems research.&quot;

== Artificial intelligence applications in recommendation ==

Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in recommendation systems are the advanced methodologies that leverage AI technologies, to enhance the performance recommendation engines. The AI-based recommender can analyze complex data sets, learning from user behavior, preferences, and interactions to generate highly accurate and personalized content or product suggestions. The integration of AI in recommendation systems has marked a significant evolution from traditional recommendation methods. Traditional methods often relied on inflexible algorithms that could suggest items based on general user trends or apparent similarities in content. In comparison, AI-powered systems have the capability to detect patterns and subtle distinctions that may be overlooked by traditional methods. These systems can adapt to specific individual preferences, thereby offering recommendations that are more aligned with individual user needs. This approach marks a shift towards more personalized, user-centric suggestions.

Recommendation systems widely adopt AI techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. These advanced methods enhance system capabilities to predict user preferences and deliver personalized content more accurately. Each technique contributes uniquely. The following sections will introduce specific AI models utilized by a recommendation system by illustrating their theories and functionalities.

=== KNN-based collaborative filters ===
Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most commonly used recommendation system algorithms. It generates personalized suggestions for users based on explicit or implicit behavioral patterns to form predictions. Specifically, it relies on external feedback such as star ratings, purchasing history and so on to make judgments. CF make predictions about users&#x27; preference based on similarity measurements. Essentially, the underlying theory is: &quot;if user A is similar to user B, and if A likes item C, then it is likely that B also likes item C.&quot;

There are many models available for collaborative filtering. For AI-applied collaborative filtering, a common model is called K-nearest neighbors. The ideas are as follows:
# Data Representation: Create a n-dimensional space where each axis represents a user&#x27;s trait (ratings, purchases, etc.). Represent the user as a point in that space.
# Statistical Distance: &#x27;Distance&#x27; measures how far apart users are in this space. See statistical distance for computational details
# Identifying Neighbors: Based on the computed distances, find k nearest neighbors of the user to which we want to make recommendations
# Forming Predictive Recommendations: The system will analyze the similar preference of the k neighbors. The system will make recommendations based on that similarity

=== Neural networks ===
An artificial neural network (ANN), is a deep learning model structure which aims to mimic a human brain. They comprise a series of neurons, each responsible for receiving and processing information transmitted from other interconnected neurons. Similar to a human brain, these neurons will change activation state based on incoming signals (training input and backpropagated output), allowing the system to adjust activation weights during the network learning phase. ANN is usually designed to be a black-box model. Unlike regular machine learning where the underlying theoretical components are formal and rigid, the collaborative effects of neurons are not entirely clear, but modern experiments has shown the predictive power of ANN.

ANN is widely used in recommendation systems for its power to utilize various data. Other than feedback data, ANN can incorporate non-feedback data which are too intricate for collaborative filtering to learn, and the unique structure allows ANN to identify extra signal from non-feedback data to boost user experience. Following are some examples:
* Time and Seasonality: what specify time and date or a season that a user interacts with the platform
* User Navigation Patterns: sequence of pages visited, time spent on different parts of a website, mouse movement, etc.
* External Social Trends: information from outer social media

==== Two-Tower Model ====

The Two-Tower model is a neural architecture commonly employed in large-scale recommendation systems, particularly for candidate retrieval tasks. It consists of two neural networks:

* User Tower: Encodes user-specific features, such as interaction history or demographic data.
* Item Tower: Encodes item-specific features, such as metadata or content embeddings.

The outputs of the two towers are fixed-length embeddings that represent users and items in a shared vector space. A similarity metric, such as dot product or cosine similarity, is used to measure relevance between a user and an item.

This model is highly efficient for large datasets as embeddings can be pre-computed for items, allowing rapid retrieval during inference. It is often used in conjunction with ranking models for end-to-end recommendation pipelines.

=== Natural language processing ===
Natural language processing is a series of AI algorithms to make natural human language accessible and analyzable to a machine. It is a fairly modern technique inspired by the growing amount of textual information. For application in recommendation system, a common case is the Amazon customer review. Amazon will analyze the feedbacks comments from each customer and report relevant data to other customers for reference. The recent years have witnessed the development of various text analysis models, including latent semantic analysis (LSA), singular value decomposition (SVD), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), etc. Their uses have consistently aimed to provide customers with more precise and tailored recommendations.

==Specific applications==
===Academic content discovery===
An emerging market for content discovery platforms is academic content. Approximately 6000 academic journal articles are published daily, making it increasingly difficult for researchers to balance time management with staying up to date with relevant research. Though traditional tools academic search tools such as Google Scholar or PubMed provide a readily accessible database of journal articles, content recommendation in these cases are performed in a &#x27;linear&#x27; fashion, with users setting &#x27;alarms&#x27; for new publications based on keywords, journals or particular authors.

Google Scholar provides an &#x27;Updates&#x27; tool that suggests articles by using a statistical model that takes a researchers&#x27; authorized paper and citations as input. Whilst these recommendations have been noted to be extremely good, this poses a problem with early career researchers which may be lacking a sufficient body of work to produce accurate recommendations.

=== Decision-making ===

In contrast to an engagement-based ranking system employed by social media and other digital platforms, a bridging-based ranking optimizes for content that is unifying instead of polarizing. Examples include Polis and Remesh which have been used around the world to help find more consensus around specific political issues. Twitter has also used this approach for managing its community notes, which YouTube planned to pilot in 2024. Aviv Ovadya also argues for implementing bridging-based algorithms in major platforms by empowering deliberative groups that are representative of the platform&#x27;s users to control the design and implementation of the algorithm.

===Television===
As the connected television landscape continues to evolve, search and recommendation are seen as having an even more pivotal role in the discovery of content. With broadband-connected devices, consumers are projected to have access to content from linear broadcast sources as well as internet television. Therefore, there is a risk that the market could become fragmented, leaving it to the viewer to visit various locations and find what they want to watch in a way that is time-consuming and complicated for them. By using a search and recommendation engine, viewers are provided with a central &#x27;portal&#x27; from which to discover content from several sources in just one location.

<doc id="596649" wikidata="Q5074431" url="?curid=596649" title="Charitable contribution deductions in the United States">
<text>Charitable contribution deductions for United States Federal Income Tax purposes are defined in section 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code as contributions to or for the use of certain nonprofit enterprises.

==Exclusions of certain amounts from deduction==
Certain portions of the market value of non-cash donations, such as short-term capital gains, are made non-deductible by I.R.C. 170(e)(1)(A).

==Organization eligibility==
An organization must meet certain requirements set forth in the code. Some organizations must also file a request with the Internal Revenue Service to gain status as a tax-exempt non-profit charitable organization under section 501(c)(3) of the tax code.

A non-exhaustive list of organizations that may meet the Federal requirements are as follows:

*Synagogues, churches and other religious organizations;
*A fraternal order or lodge
*An organization of war veterans
*Any level of government if the contribution is made for exclusively public purposes
*An organization dedicated to the improvement of public health in the U.S. or abroad

There are both public and private charities. Public charities are far more common.

==Effect of benefit to donor==
Contributions to charitable organizations are deductible to the donor, &quot;unless&quot; the donee organization uses any of its net earnings to benefit a private shareholder, or if it attempts to in any way influence political campaigns or legislation.

A contribution to a charitable organization need not be fully a &quot;gift&quot; in the statutory sense of the word to be deductible to the donor. The donor&#x27;s allowable deduction will be reduced, however, by the amount of the &quot;substantial benefit&quot; conferred upon them as a result of their contribution. 

To illustrate, suppose that the American Cancer Society is hosting a formal dance as a fund-raiser (the ACS is a certified charitable organization). Further suppose that the fair market value of a ticket to the dance is $75, and that the donor pays $375 to purchase a ticket. The donor may claim only a $300 deduction, because the amount contributed ($375) is reduced by the amount of the benefit that he received ($75, the fair market value of the ticket). This holds true even if the donor does not actually attend the dance. 

The taxable income of the donor is reduced by $300. If the donor&#x27;s income was in the 35% income tax bracket both before and after the deduction, the donor&#x27;s tax liability (amount of taxes owed to the government) is reduced by $105.

==Types of contributions==
The particular tax consequences of a donor&#x27;s charitable contribution depends on the &quot;type&quot; of contribution that he makes. A taxpayer may contribute services, cash, or property to a charity. There are a number of traps, especially that donations of short-term capital gains are generally not tax deductible.

===Services===
If the donor is contributing his services to a charity, he is not entitled to a deduction for those services. He is however, entitled to deduct his unreimbursed expenses that he incurred in rendering them (except for child care expenses, which are considered non-deductible personal expenses).

====Example====
Joy is a professional soccer player who lives in San Diego. She decides to volunteer her time at a non-profit (certified charity) soccer camp, located in Los Angeles for a week. In the ordinary course of things, Joy would charge $10,000 for these services, plus costs of transportation, board, and child care. Assume that Joy&#x27;s driving costs (gas money, oil change, etc.) amount to $150, the cost of a hotel room for the week is $400, and the cost of child care for her two kids is $500 for the week.

Joy is not entitled to deduct the $10,000 value of &quot;free services&quot; that she performed. Nor is she entitled to deduct the $500 of child care expenses incurred in the week she was volunteering. However, Joy &quot;may&quot; deduct the $150 car expenses, as well as the $400 hotel expenses incurred in her time volunteering at the camp, for a total deduction of $550.

===Cash===
If the donor is contributing cash to the charity, the general rule is that there is only one limitation on the total amount that he is entitled to deduct: He may deduct his contribution only to the extent that it does not exceed 50% of his adjusted gross income. Any amount not deducted in the year he makes the contribution may be carried forward and taken the next year for up to five years. Ordinary assets and short-term capital gain assets (&quot;see below&quot;) are treated like cash for purposes of the 50% cap.

====Example====
To illustrate, suppose that the donor has an adjusted gross income of $100,000. In the year 2004, he gives $60,000 in cash to the American Cancer Society. The donor may deduct &quot;only&quot; $50,000 in 2004. Why? Because anything over that amount is in excess of 50% of his adjusted gross income. The remaining $10,000 (60,000 total donation minus 50,000 deducted in 2004) carries forward to 2005, at which point he may deduct it.

===Property===
If the donor is contributing appreciated property, he is entitled to deduct the &quot;value&quot; of that property on his tax return for that year. Neither he nor the donee organization will pay tax on the appreciation in the property.

As is common in federal income taxation, there are several special rules and limitations that apply:

====Ordinary income-producing property and short-term capital gain property====
If the property that the donor is contributing would have produced either only an ordinary gain or a short-term capital gain had he sold it, then he may deduct only his adjusted basis in the contributed property. The taxpayer may not deduct contributions in an amount greater than 50% of his adjusted gross income (AGI) in the year of donation. Any excess may be carried forward for up to five years and may be deducted subject to the same limitations.

=====Example=====
Abby, our taxpayer, owns a sporting goods store. Her business is doing well so she decides to donate some of last season&#x27;s inventory to The Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation, a certified charitable organization.

Abby&#x27;s adjusted gross income this year is $700,000. The fair market value of Abby&#x27;s donated inventory is $600,000. Her adjusted basis in the inventory is $400,000. If Abby had sold the inventory, she would have recognized an ordinary gain of $200,000 (fmv of $600,000 minus adjusted basis of $400,000).

To determine the amount that she may deduct as a charitable contribution, Abby must subtract the ordinary gain inherent in the inventory (the $200,000) from the inventory&#x27;s fair market value (the $600,000). Thus, the amount of Abby&#x27;s gift is $400,000 (fmv of $600,000 minus inventory&#x27;s inherent ordinary gain of $200,000).

But remember, since 50% of Abby&#x27;s AGI is $350,000 she may deduct no more than that. Howeverassuming her AGI remains at least $100,001 and that she makes no charitable contributions at all &quot;next year&quot;she may carry over the $50,000.

====Long-term capital gain property====
Charitable donations to public charities and private foundations are subject to overall caps of 50% and 30%, respectively. For example, if a taxpayer contributes cash or short term capital gain property to a public charity, and that cash and property is greater than 50% of his or her adjusted gross income, then any additional contribution (including long term capital gain property) to any charity in that same year can not be deducted.

If a donor is contributing property that would have yielded a long-term capital gain in a sale, then the deduction for the contribution is limited to 30% of donor&#x27;s adjusted gross income in the year of donation if the donee is a public charity, and limited to 20% if the donee is a private foundation. Contributions over the respective AGI thresholds may be carried forward for five years, and may be deducted in subsequent years pursuant to the same restrictions. This restriction helps certain investors avoid giving themselves into such a low bracket that the tax value of the donation is impaired.

====Short-term capital gain property====
A trap for the unwary U.S. investor with an asset on which there have been gains in value who contributes the asset before the gains become long-term. The premature gift forfeits deduction of the short-term gains. The asset can be deducted only up to the amount of its basis, and not up to the amount of its appreciated market value. Only an investor who holds the asset until the capital gains have become long-term is allowed to deduct the appreciated market value.

Internal Revenue Code 170(e)(1)(A) provides: 

(e) Certain contributions of ordinary income and capital gain property 

(1) General rule
The amount of any charitable contribution of property otherwise taken into account under this section shall be reduced by the sum of

(A) the amount of gain which would not have been long-term capital gain if the property contributed had been sold by the taxpayer at its fair market value (determined at the time of such contribution)...

====Short-term capital loss property====
A further trap awaits the unwary U.S. investor who donates depreciated assetsassets on which there have been losses in valueto charity. The gift actually forfeit the tax deductibility of the capital losses, and only the depreciated (low) market value at the time of the gift is allowed to be deducted, rather than the higher basis. However an investor can instead sell the depreciated assets before considering a donation. An investor who sells can realize the resultant capital loss, which may then be deducted under the applicable capital loss rules. The cash proceeds after liquidating the depreciated asset may of course be donated to charity and deducted following the sale, but the tax advantages of making such donation are no better or worse than in any cash donation to charity. In any case, such a course leaves the investor more after-tax assets to donate if so inclined.

<doc id="596650" wikidata="Q1142897" url="?curid=596650" title="Sandinista!">
<text>Sandinista! is the fourth studio album by the English punk rock band the Clash. It was released on 12 December 1980 as a triple album containing 36 tracks, with 6 songs on each side. It crosses various genres including funk, reggae, jazz, gospel, rockabilly, folk, dub, rhythm and blues, calypso, disco, and rap. For the first time, the band&#x27;s songs were credited to the Clash as a group, rather than to Joe Strummer and Mick Jones. The band agreed to a decrease in album royalties in order to release the 3-LP at a low price.

The title refers to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and its catalogue number, &#x27;FSLN1&#x27;, refers to the abbreviation of the party&#x27;s Spanish name, &quot;Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional&quot;.

&quot;Sandinista!&quot; was mostly well received, though there was criticism towards the large size of the triple album. &quot;Sandinista!&quot; is the lowest charting album for the Clash in their native United Kingdom. However, the album was influential in the punk rock movement with its experimental sound and was voted best album of the year in the Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. In 2020 it was ranked number 323 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; and &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 85 on its &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot; list.

==Background and recording==
The album was recorded over most of 1980, in London, Manchester, Jamaica and New York. It was produced by the band (primarily Mick Jones and Joe Strummer), recorded and mixed by Bill Price, and engineered by Jeremy &quot;Jerry&quot; Green (Wessex Sound Studios), J. P. Nichols (Electric Lady Studios), Lancelot &quot;Maxie&quot; McKenzie (Channel One Studios), and Bill Price (Pluto + Power Station Studios). Dub versions of some of the songs and toasting was done by Mikey Dread, who had first worked with the band for their 1980 single &quot;Bankrobber&quot;. With &quot;Sandinista!&quot; the band reached beyond punk and reggae into dub, rhythm and blues, calypso, gospel and other genres. The album clearly displays the influence of reggae musician and producer Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry (who had worked with the band on their 1977 single &quot;Complete Control&quot; and who had opened some of the band&#x27;s shows during its stand at Bond&#x27;s in New York in 1980), with a dense, echo-filled sound on even the straight rock songs.

When recording began in New York, bass guitarist Paul Simonon was busy making a film called &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains&quot;, and he was replaced briefly by Ian Dury and the Blockheads bassist Norman Watt-Roy; this later caused some bad feeling when Watt-Roy and keyboard player Mickey Gallagher, a fellow Blockhead, claimed they were responsible for co-composing the song &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, as the song was based on a tune of theirs. Watt-Roy and Gallagher would subsequently be given a co-writing credit. Dread, too, was upset that he was not credited as the album&#x27;s producer, although he was credited with &quot;Version Mix&quot;. Other guests on the album include singer Ellen Foley (Jones&#x27; partner at the time), guitarist Ivan Julian formerly of the Voidoids, harmonica player Lew Lewis (formerly of Eddie and the Hot Rods), and Strummer&#x27;s old friend and musical collaborator Tymon Dogg, who plays violin, sings on and wrote the track &quot;Lose This Skin&quot;; he later joined Strummer&#x27;s band the Mescaleros. Gallagher&#x27;s children also made appearances: his two sons, Luke and Ben, singing a version of &quot;Career Opportunities&quot; from the band&#x27;s first album, and his daughter Maria singing a snippet of &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot;, from &quot;London Calling&quot;, at the end of the track &quot;Broadway&quot;.

This is also the only Clash album on which all four members have a lead vocal. Drummer Topper Headon made a unique lead vocal contribution on the song &quot;Ivan Meets G.I. Joe&quot;, and Simonon sings lead on &quot;The Crooked Beat&quot;.

The song &quot;Up in Heaven (Not Only Here)&quot; borrowed some lyrics from the Phil Ochs song &quot;United Fruit&quot; featured on the album &quot;Sings for Broadside&quot; (released 1976).

==Release==
According to Joe Strummer, the decision to release a triple-LP was their way of mocking CBS for resisting their desire to release &quot;London Calling&quot; as a double album, then releasing Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s double album &quot;The River&quot; less than a year later. Strummer took pleasure in the abundance, saying &quot;It was doubly outrageous. Actually, it was triply outrageous.&quot; Mick Jones said, &quot;I always saw it as a record for people who were, like, on oil rigs. Or Arctic stations. People that weren&#x27;t able to get to the record shops regularly.&quot;

The band&#x27;s wish to release the album at a low price was also met with resistance, and they had to forgo any royalties on the first 200,000 copies sold in the UK and a 50% cut in royalties elsewhere.

Four singles were released from the &quot;Sandinista!&quot; sessions in the UK: &quot;Bankrobber&quot; (which did not appear on the album), &quot;The Call Up&quot;, &quot;Hitsville UK&quot;, and &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;. A single disc promotional sampler called &quot;Sandinista Now!&quot; was sent to press and radio. The side one track listing was &quot;Police on My Back&quot;, &quot;Somebody Got Murdered&quot;, &quot;The Call Up&quot;, &quot;Washington Bullets&quot;, &quot;Ivan Meets G.I. Joe&quot; and &quot;Hitsville U.K.&quot;. The side two track listing was &quot;Up in Heaven (Not Only Here)&quot;, &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, &quot;The Leader&quot;, &quot;Junco Partner&quot;, &quot;One More Time&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Sinners&quot;.

The song &quot;Washington Bullets&quot; was lyricist Joe Strummer&#x27;s most extensive—and most specific—political statement to date. In it, Strummer name checks conflicts or controversies from around the world; namely in Chile, Nicaragua, Cuba, Afghanistan and Tibet. (In reference to the first three, Strummer seems to side with what he sees as popular leftist movements or governments, while in the latter two, he sharply criticises the policy of Moscow&#x27;s and Beijing&#x27;s communist governments for what he sees as their imperialist actions). The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of &quot;Sandinista!&quot; calls &quot;Washington Bullets&quot;, along with &quot;The Equaliser&quot; and &quot;The Call Up&quot;, &quot;the heart of the album&quot;.

The original, 3-disc vinyl release of &quot;Sandinista!&quot; included a tri-fold lyric sheet titled &quot;The Armagideon Times, no. 3&quot; (a play on &quot;Armagideon Time&quot;, the B-side from the single &quot;London Calling&quot;.) &quot;Armagideon Times&quot;, nos. 1 and 2 were Clash fanzines. The lyric sheet featured cartoons credited to Steve Bell, as well as hand-written (but still legible) lyrics of all the original songs. The 2-CD release contains a facsimile of the lyric sheet considerably reduced in size.

The cover photo of the band was taken by Pennie Smith, in Camley Street, behind St Pancras railway station.

==Reception==

In the UK, initial reviews were mostly poor. In the &quot;NME&quot; Nick Kent wrote that &quot;the record simply perplexes and ultimately depresses&quot;. Upset, the Clash approached editor Neil Spencer to have the record re-reviewed. The request was denied. &quot;None of the other reviews in the music press, bar Robbi Millar&#x27;s in &quot;Sounds&quot;, thought much of the record, either. &quot;The Face&quot; magazine mercilessly took the piss out of it.&quot;

In the US, the story was a bit different. John Piccarella, in a review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; headlined &quot;The Clash Drop the Big One&quot;, argued that in effect, the band said &quot;to hell with Clash style, there&#x27;s a world out there.&quot; Some critics have argued that the album would have worked better as a less ambitious, smaller project, while Piccarella (in his &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review) and others think of the album as a breakthrough that deserves comparison to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot;. Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;If this is their worst—which it is, I think—they must be, er, the world&#x27;s greatest rock and roll band&quot;.

The triple album was included in several &quot;best of the year&quot; critics&#x27; polls in 1981. It was voted first place in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1981 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. According to CMJ, &quot;Sandinista!&quot; was the second most-played album of 1981 on American college radio. Dave Marsh noted that it was a record whose topic was as many years ahead of its time as its sound. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; included &quot;Sandinista!&quot; on its 2000 list of the &quot;10 Essential Political-Revolution Albums&quot;. In 2018, &quot;Sandinista!&quot; was ranked at number 144 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of the 200 best albums of the 1980s. In 2020, the album was ranked at number 323 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

&quot;The Sandinista! Project&quot;, a tribute to the album featuring the Smithereens, Camper Van Beethoven, Jon Langford and Sally Timms (Mekons), Amy Rigby, Katrina Leskanich (of Katrina and the Waves), Wreckless Eric, Willie Nile, Matthew Ryan, Stew, Mark Cutler, Sex Clark Five, Sid Griffin &amp; Coal Porters, Haale, the Blizzard of 78 featuring Mikey Dread, Ruby on the Vine, and many others, was released on 15 May 2007, on the 00:02:59 Records (a label named after a lyric from the &quot;Sandinista!&quot; song &quot;Hitsville U.K.&quot;). The album also features a collaboration by Soul Food and Mickey Gallagher on &quot;Midnight Log&quot;.

&quot;Sandinista!&quot; is remembered as an important influence for the Chilean rock band Los Prisioneros. The band members discovered the album in the austral summer of 1981 through a special report in Radio Concierto. Jorge González recalls he found it &quot;advanced&quot; and &quot;Martian&quot; and that &quot;it taught me to do music&quot;.

Kurt Cobain of Nirvana referenced the album negatively as his first introduction to punk rock stating, &quot;I went to borrow the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Sandinista!&quot; from the library [...] &#x27;if this is punk rock, I&#x27;m not sure I like it.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Mark Neil Brown (born November 18, 1951) is an American engineer, retired colonel in the United States Air Force and former NASA astronaut. Brown spent a total of ten days in space, over two Space Shuttle missions.

==Personal life==
Brown was born November 18, 1951, in Valparaiso, Indiana, to Mr. and Mrs. Richard S. Brown. His recreational interests include fishing, hiking, jogging, all sports and chess. He married the former Lynne A. Anderson of River Grove, Illinois; they have two daughters.

==Education==
* 1969: Graduated from Valparaiso High School, Valparaiso, Indiana
* 1973: Received a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana
* 1980: Received a Master of Science degree in astronautical engineering from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology of Air University, Dayton, Ohio

==Air Force experience==
Following graduation from Purdue in 1973, Brown was commissioned in the U.S. Air Force and received his pilot wings at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, in 1974. He was then assigned to the 87th Fighter Interceptor Squadron at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base, Michigan, where he flew both T-33 and F-106 aircraft. Brown graduated from the Squadron Officer School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, in 1975. He was transferred to the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and earned his master&#x27;s degree in astronautical engineering in 1980. Two years later, he graduated from the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.

==NASA career==
Brown was assigned to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1980. Assigned as an engineer in the Flight Activities Section, he participated in the development of contingency procedures for use aboard the Space Shuttle and served as an attitude and pointing officer. Brown supported STS-2, STS-3, STS-4, STS-6, STS-8 and STS-41-C in the Flight Activity Officer/Staff Support Room of the Mission Control Center.

Brown became an astronaut in June 1985 after being selected in May 1984, and qualified for assignment as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. In December 1985, he was assigned to the crew of STS-61-N, a Department of Defense mission which was canceled due to the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. During 1986 and 1987, he was an astronaut member of the solid rocket booster redesign team. In February 1988, Brown was assigned to STS-28, flying on 8 August 1989, after which he served as astronaut member on the Space Station Freedom program, which was later canceled. He next flew on STS-48 on 12 September 1991. Brown had logged over 249 hours in space after flying two missions.

On his first space flight, Brown was a mission specialist on the crew of STS-28. The orbiter &quot;Columbia&quot; was launched from Kennedy Space Center on August 8, 1989. The mission carried Department of Defense payloads and a number of secondary payloads. After 80 orbits of the Earth, this five-day mission concluded with a dry lakebed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on 13 August 1989.

Brown also flew on STS-48 aboard &quot;Discovery&quot; on 12 September 1991. This was a five-day mission during which the crew deployed the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) which is designed to provide scientists with their first complete data set on the upper atmosphere&#x27;s chemistry, winds and energy inputs. The crew also conducted numerous secondary experiments ranging from growing protein crystals to studying how fluids and structures react in weightlessness. The mission was accomplished in 81 orbits of the Earth and concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base on September 18, 1991.

Brown left NASA in July 1993 and retired from the U.S. Air Force to head the Space Division office of General Research Corporation in Dayton, Ohio.

<text>Equinox International was a multi-level marketing company founded in 1991 and headed by Bill Gouldd. In 1996, Equinox was listed #1 on Inc Magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 fastest-growing private companies in the United States.

The company and its founder came under scrutiny for its business practices; starting in 1997, investors, the FTC, and several states brought suit charging Equinox was an illegal pyramid scheme rather than a legitimate business.

On 25 April 2000, the Federal Trade Commission issued a notice that Equinox International settled a court case with a penalty of $40 million in restitution. Gouldd was required to surrender substantial holdings, but retained (among other things) over a million dollars worth of real estate.

Equinox International was ordered dissolved in April 2000. As part of the settlement, Gouldd was also &quot;permanently restrained and enjoined from engaging, participating or assisting in any multi-level marketing program.&quot;

<text>Rockbitch were a British rock band, composed mostly of female, lesbian and bisexual members, who performed nude and incorporated sexual acts and Pagan rituals into their performances.

==History==
Rockbitch was originally formed in 1984 as Cat Genetica by bassist Amanda Smith-Skinner (&quot;the Bitch&quot;) and guitarist Tony Skinner (&quot;the Beast&quot;). The band was later renamed Red Abyss, in 1989, and drew band members from the matriarchal, polyamorous, pagan, feminist community of which Smith-Skinner was a member.

Rockbitch became infamous not only for performing live sex acts but also doing so with audience members via &quot;The Golden Condom&quot;. During their shows, a condom was tossed into the crowd; whoever caught it (male or female) was taken backstage for sexual acts with band members. The band&#x27;s official website describes all of the women band members as &quot;lesbian or bisexual&quot; and that there are &quot;no exclusive monogamous couples&quot; among its members. The band engaged in kissing, oral sex (male and female), and vaginal penetration via fingers, tongues, toys, and penises. They have stated on their website that they are tested every four months for sexually transmitted diseases and infections, including HIV and AIDS, and have rules around sexual contact. These rules include but are not limited to: only engaging in oral sex and penetration with a condom and not engaging in anal sex &quot;outside the community&quot;. They&#x27;ve stated that no one in their community has caught any sexually transmitted disease.

The members of the band lived together as a polyamorous commune in a house in France.

In 1997, Rockbitch made tabloid headlines after they played at a school for pre-teen children, although for this particular concert they changed their name to &quot;Rocky Beaches&quot;, wore modest clothes, and sang non-sexual songs.

Babe stated in 2002, &quot;Rockbitch had no problem with lads out for seeing breasts, as they were a component of the audience, there were always others seeing the deeper meaning and both groups had a good time. They generally made up for a great combined atmosphere&quot;.

In 2003, the band received a Lifetime Achievement award from the Sexual Freedom Awards.

==Activism and philosophy==
Members lent their voices to female and sexual issues, were winners of the yearly prize at the Sex Maniacs Ball (now Night of the Senses) founded by Tuppy Owens, openly voiced their admiration for sexual politics icons such as Annie Sprinkle and Betty Dodson, and generally advocated open female sexuality as a healthy part of human nature. In an extension of the 1970s&#x27; feminist statement that ‘the personal is the political’, they stated that no feminist movement was complete without female sexuality being re-examined, redefined and expressed in whatever shape it took by women themselves. They saw rock music as the perfect medium to do so, as it had been the arena for the expression of masculine sexuality for so long, whereas women&#x27;s bodies were often a marketing spice to add interest to a product rather than a source of personal empowerment.

The group described themselves as having a free-love and pansexual communal philosophy. The band&#x27;s lead guitarist, &quot;Babe&quot;, stated in 2004 that, &quot;we believe in liberating people through free and open sexuality&quot;.

==Dissolution==
After the release of its first studio album, &quot;Motor Driven Bimbo&quot;, Rockbitch were increasingly pressured to censor their stage performances by their record company. They refused and successfully negotiated a release from their contract.

A second, goth-influenced album, titled &quot;Psychic Attack&quot;, was never released.

The band took care never to break any laws regarding the content of their stage shows in any country or territory. Continued attention from British police about their sexually-driven themes and performances combined with local council opposition to their adult-only shows. Underhanded pressure on venue owners regarding liquor and performance licences resulted in difficulties performing live, even when venue owners were positive towards the band. Tours were booked and then dates pulled with only days to spare. The frustration and problems this created led to Rockbitch ceasing to perform live for a time from 2002. The band would perform live again in August 2004.

Rockbitch were the subject of many documentaries and featured in many shows. Amongst others, Rockbitch were the subject of a 30-minute documentary on BBC Choice the same year. A further, hour-long documentary was broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK in 2003. Award-winning director Norman Hull made ‘This is Rockbitch’ in 2003. They can still be spotted in repeats of Sexcetera.

In 2005, the entire latter-day Rockbitch lineup emerged under the name MT-TV. This was a music-only project, with none of the sex or nudity of the Rockbitch days, but it incorporated stage theatrics and provided sociosexual-based political comment through its lyrics. After a UK tour in summer 2005, they performed throughout the United States. The first part of their US tour was documented on the DVD &#x27;Shevolution&#x27;, released by Blackwing Films in 2006.

The most recent program, released in 2017, is a Swedish documentary on the rise in popularity of witchcraft and its feminist connections. The first film crew to be allowed access behind the commune walls since the cessation of the Rockbitch live performances, the documentary contains a recap of their musical career, and provides insight into their pagan/witchcraft roots with how it underpinned their music and interviews with Babe.

Amanda and Jo subsequently went on to form the band Syren with singer/songwriter Erin Bennett, who joined the Rockbitch commune in 2006.
In 2012, Jo died of breast cancer. Amanda gave up her musical career shortly after. Erin Bennett subsequently continued as a solo artist with a backing band that contains some ex-members of Rockbitch, discarding the name Syren and performing as Erin Bennett and the EB Band. In the last two years, the band have undergone a complete rebranding and are now touring as a prog rock band under the name EBB.

Julie, the lead singer of Rockbitch, continues her musical career under the name Krow, creating hard dance music in the style of Noise Terror Punk EDM. Her music and video were also featured in the Swedish documentary.

<doc id="596663" wikidata="Q41184" url="?curid=596663" title="Clinical lycanthropy">
<text>Clinical lycanthropy is a rare psychiatric syndrome that involves a delusion that the affected person can transform into, has transformed into, or is a non-human animal. Its name is associated with the mythical condition of lycanthropy, a supernatural affliction in which humans are said to physically shapeshift into wolves. The term is used by researchers mostly in the broader sense of transformation into animals in general, that, strictly speaking, is described as zoanthropy.

==Signs and symptoms==
Affected individuals believe that they are in the process of transforming into an animal, or have already transformed into an animal. Clinical Lycanthropy has been associated with the altered states of mind that accompany psychosis, the mental state that typically involves delusions and hallucinations, with the transformation only seeming to happen in the mind and behavior of the affected person.

A 1988 study on clinical lycanthropy from the McLean Hospital reported on a series of cases, and proposed some diagnostic criteria by which clinical lycanthropy could be recognised:

* A patient reports in a moment of lucidity or reminiscence that they sometimes feel as an animal or have felt like one.
* A patient behaves in a manner that resembles animal behavior, for example howling, growling, or crawling.

According to these criteria, either a delusional belief in current or past transformation or behavior that suggests a person thinks of themselves as transformed is considered evidence of clinical lycanthropy. The authors note that, although the condition seems to be an expression of psychosis, there is no specific diagnosis of mental or neurological illness associated with its behavioral consequences.

Clinical lycanthropy is not specific to an experience of human-to-wolf transformation. A wide variety of creatures have been reported as part of the shape-shifting experience. A 2004 review of the medical literature lists over thirty published cases of clinical lycanthropy, only the minority of which have wolf (Lycanthropy) or dog (Cynanthropy) themes. Canines are certainly not uncommon, although the experience of being transformed into other animals such as a hyena, cat, horse, bird, or tiger has been reported on more than one occasion.

Transformation into frogs, and even bees, has been reported in some instances. The term &quot;ophidianthropy&quot; refers to the delusion that one has been transformed into a snake, of which two case studies have been reported. 

In Japan, transformation into foxes and dogs was common (:ja:狐憑き, :ja:犬神). A 1989 case study described how one individual reported a serial transformation, experiencing a change from human to dog, to a horse, and then to a cat, before returning to the reality of human existence after treatment. There are also reports of people who experienced transformation into an animal only listed as &quot;unspecified.&quot;

==Proposed mechanisms==

Clinical lycanthropy is a very rare condition and is largely considered to be an idiosyncratic expression of a psychotic or dissociative episode caused by another condition such as dissociative identity disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or clinical depression. It has also been associated with drug intoxication and withdrawal, cerebrovascular disease, traumatic brain injury, dementia, delirium, and seizures.

However, there are suggestions that certain neurological conditions and cultural influences may result in the expression of the human-animal transformation theme that defines the condition.

===Neurological factors===
One important factor may be differences or changes in parts of the brain known to be involved in representing body shape (e.g., see proprioception and body image). A neuroimaging study of two people diagnosed with clinical lycanthropy showed that these areas display unusual activation, suggesting that when people report their bodies are changing shape, they may be genuinely perceiving those feelings.

===Treatment===
Because clinical lycanthropy is strongly associated with psychotic disorders, antipsychotic medication is often an effective treatment. It may also be treated with antidepressants or mood stabilizers, in cases in which it is a symptom of depression or bipolar disorder. Patients with clinical lycanthropy may also benefit from a cultural approach to treatment, as the syndrome is generally agreed to be culture-bound.

==Related disorders==
Clinical lycanthropy is a type of delusional misidentification syndrome of the self, and it often overlaps with other delusional misidentification syndromes. For example, there is a case study of a psychiatric patient who had both clinical lycanthropy and Cotard delusion.

In rare cases, individuals may believe that other people have transformed into animals. This has been termed &quot;lycanthropic intermetamorphosis&quot; and &quot;lycanthropy spectrum.&quot; A 2009 study reported that, after the consumption of the drug MDMA (Ecstasy), a man displayed symptoms of paranoid psychosis by claiming that his relatives had changed into various animals such as a boar, a donkey, and a horse.

==History==
Catherine Clark Kroeger has written that several parts of the Bible refer to King Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s behavior in the book of Daniel 4 as being a manifestation of clinical lycanthropy. Neurologist Andrew J. Larner has written that the fate of Odysseus&#x27;s crew due to the magic of Circe may be one of the earliest examples of clinical lycanthropy.

It is believed that the Armenian king Tiridates III also had this disorder. He was cured by Gregory the Illuminator.

According to Persian tradition, the Buyid prince Majd al-Dawla was experiencing an illusion that he was a cow. He was cured by Ibn Sina.

Notions that lycanthropy was due to a medical condition go back to the seventh century, when the Alexandrian physician Paulus Aegineta attributed lycanthropy to melancholia or an &quot;excess of black bile&quot;. In 1563, a Lutheran physician named Johann Weyer wrote that werewolves had an imbalance in their melancholic humour and exhibited the physical symptoms of paleness, &quot;a dry tongue and a great thirst&quot; as well as sunken, dim and dry eyes. 

Even King James VI and I in his 1597 treatise &quot;Daemonologie&quot; does not blame werewolf behaviour on delusions created by the Devil but &quot;an excess of melancholy as the culprit which causes some men to believe that they are wolves and to &#x27;counterfeit&#x27; the actions of these animals&quot;. The perception of an association between mental illness and animalistic behaviour can be traced throughout the history of folklore from many different countries.

== Case examples ==
On August 15, 2016, Martin County Florida Sheriff&#x27;s Office deputies found a 19-year-old male on top of a bloodied 59-year-old man, gnawing on his face, eating pieces of flesh, and making growling sounds. Officers tased, repeatedly kicked, and ultimately required a police dog&#x27;s assistance in subduing the 19-year-old. Inside the garage of the home on Southeast Kokomo Lane, just north of the Palm Beach County line, deputies found a 53-year-old woman, beaten, bloodied and unresponsive. Ultimately both the 59-year-old man and 53-year-old woman would die from their injuries. In the weeks ahead of this incident, the 19-year-old told family members he believed he was either half-man, half-horse or half-man, half-dog. Clinical psychologist Dr. Phillip Resnick later assessed the 19-year-old as having clinical lycanthropy.

A 20-year-old man was admitted to a mental hospital due to his increasingly agitated and erratic behaviors. During his initial evaluation, he was guarded and preoccupied. He had no previous psychiatric history. Over the next few days, he displayed increasingly psychotic, animal-like behaviors. These behaviors included howling loudly, running abruptly, and crawling on all fours. He appeared to be internally stimulated. When asked about these behaviors, he was initially evasive but eventually admitted that he believed he was a werewolf and would periodically transform into a wolf. He started believing this after having visions of &quot;the Devil&quot; years before and reported hearing random voices. The patient was started on ziprasidone and his symptoms gradually responded and his animal-like behaviors eventually ceased altogether.

A 25-year-old man was sent for treatment during a period of excessive hand-washing, irritable behavior, decreased sleep, and acting like a buffalo. The patient reported that he had engaged in sexual activity with his buffalo and believed that buffalo cells had entered his body and were transforming him into a buffalo. He began obsessively washing his hands and genitals in order to avoid the transition. He saw himself as having buffalo body parts and became preoccupied about his appearance. He then began to act as a buffalo by nodding his head, crawling on all fours, and seeking out hay and grass to eat. He was ultimately diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder with delusional beliefs. He was treated with fluoxetine and risperidone, and after 6 months of pharmacotherapy, his body dysmorphia and hand-washing were both reduced.

<doc id="596664" wikidata="Q5488399" url="?curid=596664" title="Frank Melville Jr. Memorial Library">
<text>The Frank Melville Jr. Memorial Library is the main library at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York. It is named for the father of philanthropist Ward Melville, who donated 400 acres of land and money to establish Stony Brook University in 1957. It originally opened in July 1963 and has massively expanded since its original construction. The library was dedicated to Melville in 1971.

The library currently holds over two million volumes, over 300 databases, 70,000 electronic journals, 10,000 electronic books, 10,000 compact disks and 6,000 films. The six-story building encompasses roughly 682,000 square feet of space and is in use by over fifty different administrative and academic departments. Numerous retail companies ranging from Shop Red West (one of the university&#x27;s bookstores) to Starbucks are housed in the Melville Library.

==History==
Originally constructed in 1962 as a modest sized three-story building, the library opened its doors as the State University Library in July 1963 with capacity for 700 students. It was renovated almost immediately with numerous construction projects shortly after; in 1967, work began on the &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot;, connecting the library to the Stony Brook Union. Plans to connect the two buildings with the Fine Arts Center were not completed until 10 years after ground was broken, giving the structure its name. The Bridge to Nowhere was completed in 1977 and demolished in 2002.

In 1969, architect Ervin Y. Galantay spearheaded a new design for the library, adding four separate five-story wings around the original structure as well as a glass atrium that connected the original building to its new areas. After another massive renovation in 1971 that nearly quadrupled the square footage of the library, it was dedicated to Frank Melville Jr., Ward Melville&#x27;s father.
In April 2002, a steel sculpture by graphic designer Milton Glaser was installed outside the library facing the Academic Mall.

It holds more than 2.1 million bound volumes and over four million rolls of microfilm. The library is a member of the Association of Research Libraries, a consortium of the top 120 research libraries in the country. The library has a Special Collections Department which houses over 16,000 rare books, 800 antique and hand-drawn maps, and over 150 collections, including the papers of Senator Jacob K. Javits, the Environmental Defense Archive, and the William Butler Yeats Microfilmed Manuscripts Collection.

In 2016 the North and Central Reading Rooms were renovated and modernized with new furniture and technology improvements to become a &quot;knowledge commons.&quot; The redesign included adding new independent study areas, more natural light, better acoustics, new flooring, more electrical outlets, and new computer workstations.

==Description==
The building consists of six floors, and a commuter lounge, and is located on the Academic Mall of the university. There are also separate branch libraries in Math, Physics &amp; Astronomy, Chemistry, Music, Computer Science, and Marine Science. The Library also contains offices for different academic departments, as well as classrooms, computer labs, a career center and a bookstore.

Shop Red West, one of the university&#x27;s bookstores, is located in the basement of the Melville Library. After a longtime partnership with Barnes &amp; Noble, the university reached a contract with Follett Corporation in 2018 to manage its bookstores and electronic catalog. The bookstore, then a Barnes &amp; Noble, moved to the Melville Library from the Stony Brook Union in 1986.

In 2016, Amazon@StonyBrook opened, becoming the first Amazon pick-up location in the state of New York and only the 15th college in the United States to offer an Amazon pick-up location. However, the facility closed in November 2020 after four years.
In 2017, a Starbucks coffee shop opened in the basement adjacent to Shop Red West. The 2,842-square foot location cost $1.4 million to make and seats 70. An existent storage facility had to be demolished in order to make room.

<doc id="596667" wikidata="Q1452386" url="?curid=596667" title="Frederick Wilhelm Kaltenbach">
<text>Frederick Wilhelm Kaltenbach (March 29, 1895 – October 1945) was an American who broadcast Nazi propaganda from Germany during World War II.

==Early life==
Kaltenbach was born in Dubuque, Iowa, and was raised in Waterloo, Iowa. His father was John Kaltenbach, who had emigrated to the United States from Germany in 1891 and was naturalized in 1896.
After graduating from East High School, Waterloo, Kaltenbach and his brother Gustav went on a cycling tour of Germany and were there when World War I broke out in August 1914. They were detained on suspicion of espionage until December 1914, when they were released. Despite that experience, Kaltenbach became an admirer of Germany and its people.

On his return Kaltenbach enrolled in Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, and studied there for three years. In June 1918, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Coastal Artillery. Kaltenbach was honorably discharged from the US Army in April 1919.
He resumed his education at Iowa State Teachers College, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1920. Kaltenbach worked for the next seven years as an appraiser before becoming a teacher. His first teaching post was in Manchester, Iowa. In 1931 he was offered a position at Dubuque&#x27;s Senior High School teaching business law, economics, and debate. In the early 1930s he earned a master&#x27;s degree in history from the University of Chicago.

==Introduction to Nazism==

In 1933, Kaltenbach won a scholarship at the University of Berlin and took a two-year leave of absence from his employment to pursue his doctorate. While in Germany he became an ardent follower of the Nazi movement.

On his return to the United States, Kaltenbach resumed teaching in Dubuque. In 1935 he started a club for boys based on the Hitler Youth movement, the Militant Order of Spartan Knights. It held secret initiation rituals and the boys wore brown military-style uniforms. Because of the concern of parents, Kaltenbach&#x27;s teaching contract was terminated in June 1936.

Kaltenbach then left for Germany where he worked as a freelance writer and translator and on occasion for the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft, German State Radio.

In February 1939 he married a German national, Dorothea Peters, and they honeymooned in the United States. There he took every opportunity to speak in favor of the Nazi cause, but, after a hostile confrontation at a lecture he gave at the Russell-Lamson Hotel in Waterloo in May 1939, he hastily returned to Germany. He was soon hired as a broadcaster for Nazi propaganda.

==Lord Hee-Haw: propagandist for Nazi Germany==

Back in Germany, Kaltenbach became a full-time broadcaster reading news bulletins for the RRG&#x27;s USA Zone. From 1940 to 1941 he broadcast &quot;Letters to Iowa&quot; to the United States directed at the American Midwest. His programs consisted of anti-Roosevelt, anti-British and pro-isolationism propaganda in the form of fictional letters back home. Kaltenbach believed that his role was also to warn Americans of the dangers of Bolshevism and saw himself as one who could clarify the Nazi philosophy while minimizing criticism of Hitler. 

He cultivated a simple and homey style and was one of several English-speaking propagandists for Germany that were referred to by the nickname Lord Hee-Haw, analogous to the British-directed propagandists who were dubbed Lord Haw-Haw. Kaltenbach opened each program with &quot;Greetings to my old friend, Harry in Iowa&quot;, and delivered his propaganda messages in the form of advice, such as, &quot;Don&#x27;t let the British drag America into this thing [the war in Europe], Harry.&quot; After the United States entered the war against Germany on December 11, 1941, Kaltenbach&#x27;s broadcasts aimed at undermining US morale and the national will to prosecute a protracted war with Germany. 

Kaltenbach also broadcast with another American collaborator, Max Koischwitz, as Jim of &quot;Jim and Johnny&quot;, a humorous dialogue program in which the title characters traded propaganda-laden wisecracks.

==Charges of treason==
On July 26, 1943, Kaltenbach, along with Max Otto Koischwitz, Jane Anderson (&quot;The Georgia Peach&quot;), Edward Delaney, Constance Drexel, Robert Henry Best, Douglas Chandler and Ezra Pound, was indicted by a District of Columbia grand jury on charges of treason.

==Disillusionment with Nazism==

In the months following Kaltenbach&#x27;s US indictment for treason in 1943, the frequency of his radio broadcasts diminished and his position as the leading American broadcaster was taken by two collaborators, Mildred Gillars and Douglas Chandler.

From 1944, Kaltenbach&#x27;s health declined as he began to suffer from heart problems and asthma. He also became disenchanted with Hitler and Nazism, often refusing to broadcast and going on strike, sometimes for months at a time. This alienated his fellow American collaborators and resulted in confrontation, especially with their British colleague, William Joyce, on whom the Lord Haw-Haw nickname had finally settled.

Towards the end of the war, Kaltenbach attempted to ingratiate himself with anti-Nazi elements and religious elements associated with Pastor Martin Niemöller.

He could still be heard intermittently in North America and by American forces in Europe up to early 1945.

==Capture and death==

After Germany surrendered on May 8, 1945, his wife reported to the US Army that her husband had been arrested at the family home in Berlin by Soviet troops on May 15, 1945. The Soviets refused American requests to surrender custody and later reported that Kaltenbach had died in Soviet Special Camp 2 in Buchenwald at an unspecified date in October 1945. The State Department agreed and the US District Court dismissed the indictment against Kaltenbach on April 13, 1948.

<doc id="596673" wikidata="Q1347659" url="?curid=596673" title="Epping Forest District">
<text>Epping Forest District is a local government district in Essex, England. It is named after the ancient woodland of Epping Forest, a large part of which lies within the district. The district covers northeastern parts of the urban area of London, including the suburban towns of Epping, Loughton, Waltham Abbey, Chigwell, and Buckhurst Hill, as well as rural areas beyond it. The district is situated in the west of the county, bordering north-eastern Greater London.

The administrative headquarters of Epping Forest District Council are in the town of Epping. Neighbouring districts are Brentwood, Broxbourne, Chelmsford, East Hertfordshire, Enfield, Harlow, Havering, Redbridge, Uttlesford and Waltham Forest. In 2021 it had a population of 134,909.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of three former districts and most of a fourth, all of which were abolished at the same time:
*Chigwell Urban District (which included Loughton and Buckhurst Hill as well as Chigwell itself)
*Epping and Ongar Rural District (except the five parishes of Blackmore, Doddinghurst, Kelvedon Hatch, Navestock and Stondon Massey, which went to Brentwood)
*Epping Urban District
*Waltham Holy Cross Urban District

The new district was named Epping Forest after the ancient woodland of that name, much of which falls within the district. The woodland is in turn named after the town of Epping.

Since 1974 there have been some changes to the district&#x27;s boundary with Greater London:
* In 1994, , which now form Enfield Island Village, were transferred to the London Borough of Enfield
* In 1995 a small area around Grange Hill and Roding Valley stations was transferred to the London Borough of Redbridge.

==Governance==
Epping Forest District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Essex County Council. The district is also entirely covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative control since 2006.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2001 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election and a subsequent change of allegiance in June 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2024 the council has comprised 54 councillors representing 18 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) elected each time for a four-year term of offices. Essex County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no district council elections.

The district straddles three parliamentary constituencies of Epping Forest, Brentwood and Ongar, and Harlow.

===Premises===
Epping Forest District Council is based at the Civic Offices at 323 High Street, Epping.

When the council was first created it inherited four sets of offices from its predecessors and functions were initially divided between them:
*Council Offices, Old Station Road, Loughton from Chigwell Urban District Council.
*25 Hemnall Street, Epping from Epping Urban District Council.
*323 High Street, Epping from Epping and Ongar Rural District Council.
*Town Hall, Highbridge Street, Waltham Abbey from Waltham Holy Cross Urban District Council.

The council subsequently built a large new building, Epping Civic Offices, adjoining the original converted house at 323 High Street in Epping. The new building was designed by Richard Reid and built between 1987 and 1992. It was designated a Grade II listed building in 2017.

==Geography==
The north-east of the district is rural and sparsely populated for an area so close to London; this area includes Chipping Ongar and surrounding villages. The south-west of the district closer to the boundary with Greater London is more suburban and is dominated by Loughton, the largest town in the district. Most of the district has a wide range of architectural styles and periods. Loughton adjoins the woodland of Epping Forest to the west and is separated by farms, rivers and golf courses from other settlements in other directions. As an example of conserved physical geographic landscapes, the Roding Valley and Three Forests Way (one end of the Stort Valley Way and the other end connecting to the Harcamlow Way in Hatfield Forest and National Nature Reserve, Essex which is north of Epping Forest District.

The River Roding runs through the eastern portion of the district, with the Lea Valley in the west.

Buckhurst Hill, Chigwell, Waltham Abbey and Loughton, although they are not within Greater London, are included in the Office for National Statistics definition of the Greater London Built-up Area.

Epping Forest district is bounded by the Harlow, Uttlesford, Chelmsford and Brentwood districts of Essex, the East Hertfordshire and Broxbourne districts of Hertfordshire, and the London boroughs of Havering, Redbridge, Waltham Forest and Enfield.

== Transport ==

=== Rail ===
Roydon railway station on the West Anglia Main Line is the only National Rail station within the district, which lies on the district boundary with East Hertfordshire. Sawbridgeworth railway station on the same line lies directly west of the district, within Hertfordshire, as does Waltham Cross railway station, which serves the district&#x27;s town of Waltham Abbey. These stations are served by Greater Anglia trains either between London Liverpool Street and Ely, and London Stratford and Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, with direct connections to destinations such as Broxbourne, Tottenham Hale, Audley End and Cambridge.

The London Underground Central line passes through the southern portion of Epping Forest. Epping, Theydon Bois, Debden and Loughton stations in the borough fall in London fare zone 6, with Buckhurst Hill in zone 5 and Roding Valley, Chigwell and Grange Hill in zone 4.

The Central line provides the district with direct connections with East London, The City, the West End, and West London. Transport for London manages the London Underground network.

A former portion of the Central line between Epping and Chipping Ongar, via North Weald and Blake Hall, is part of the Epping Ongar Railway.

=== Road ===
Two motorways meet in the district - the M25 London Orbital motorway and the M11 motorway.

<text>Sigue Sigue Sputnik were a British new wave band formed in 1982 by former Generation X bassist Tony James. The band have had three UK top-40 hit singles, including &quot;Love Missile F1-11&quot; and &quot;21st Century Boy&quot;.

The band&#x27;s music, image and inspiration drew from a range of electronic and glam bands such as Suicide and the New York Dolls.

== History ==
=== Early years ===

The band, which is often just called &quot;Sputnik&quot;, was formed by Tony James, ex-bassist of the defunct Generation X, and Neal X (Whitmore), who recruited singer Martin Degville. Degville was a clothes designer and supplied the band&#x27;s wardrobe, and YaYa, the store where he worked, became the band&#x27;s base. Their first gig was in Paris, supporting Johnny Thunders, with James&#x27; former Generation X colleague and then drummer for Thunders, Mark Laff, on drums.

Mick Jones, formerly of the Clash, worked with the band as live sound engineer, helped manipulate their sound, and appeared with them when they opened for New Model Army. Fachtna O&#x27;Kelly, manager of the Boomtown Rats who had provided much of the band&#x27;s equipment, provided the band with the name Sigue Sigue Sputnik, as a supposed reference to a Russian street gang and meaning, in rough translation &quot;burn, burn satellite&quot; (&quot;sigue&quot; coming from a form of the Russian verb сжигать, meaning burn, and Sputnik referencing the first man-made satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957). The band&#x27;s sound was, according to James, arrived at by accident, when he inadvertently mixed elements of film soundtracks with their demo track &quot;Love Missile F1-11&quot; while putting together a video compilation from his favourite films.

=== Commercial success (1984–1989) ===
Interest in the band increased sharply in 1984 after James was interviewed by the &quot;NME&quot;, with several record companies sending representatives to their next performance at the Electric Cinema in London, and they were invited to perform on &quot;The Tube&quot;. The band were signed by EMI, with the band themselves claiming in the press that they had signed for £4 million, though in fact revealed to be £350,000. James wanted the band to be produced by David Bowie or Prince, with the latter rejecting the offer because the band&#x27;s material was &quot;too violent.&quot; Also shortlisted were John Carpenter and Giorgio Moroder because of their soundtrack work. The band&#x27;s first single, the Moroder-produced &quot;Love Missile F1-11&quot;, was released in February 1986, and reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart, number 2 in South Africa and was a major hit in several countries in Europe and Asia. Its popularity was boosted by its inclusion in the John Hughes film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. The samples used in the single had not received copyright clearance, and were replaced in the US version, a move that James says &quot;killed the record&quot; in America.

Their second single, &quot;21st Century Boy&quot; reached number 20 in the UK, a relative disappointment James blamed on audiences tiring of the band due to overexposure in the media. Despite largely negative reviews, their debut studio album, &quot;Flaunt It&quot;, also produced by Moroder, made the top ten in the UK, and reached 96 in the US. The album included paid commercials between tracks, James stated prior to its release that they would sell 20–to-30-second advertising slots for between $2,500 and $7,000. He explained this by saying &quot;commercialism is rampant in society. Maybe we&#x27;re a little more honest than some groups I could mention,&quot; and &quot;our records sounded like adverts anyway&quot;. Advertisements that did sell (including spots for &quot;i-D Magazine&quot; and Studio Line from L&#x27;Oréal) were complemented by ironic spoof ads including one for the Sputnik corporation itself claiming that &quot;Pleasure is our Business&quot;. A subsequent tour was characterised by poor ticket sales and crowd violence, but James claimed the tour was also affected by an alleged vendetta by the UK tabloid Daily Mirror, which created a negative public perception of the band as a live act.

It was two years before the band followed this up, and subsequent releases fared less well. The Stock Aitken Waterman produced &quot;Success&quot; peaked at number 31 in late 1988, with James blaming the track&#x27;s underperformance on its generic pop production and a poor quality video. The singles that followed peaked outside the top 40. Second album &quot;Dress for Excess&quot; peaked at number 53 in the UK but sold well in Brazil. The band split up in July 1989, with James joining The Sisters of Mercy later that year. Chris Kavanagh went on to Big Audio Dynamite II joining Mick Jones. Mayhew formed Mayhem Deranged.

A collection of early demo recordings from 1984 and 1985, along with three tracks from 1990, &quot;First Generation&quot;, was released in 1991.

=== Reunions ===

In 1995, James and X formed a new version of the band with Christopher Novak (vocals) and John Green (keyboards). Their song &quot;Cyberspace Party&quot; was a hit in Japan; an album, &quot;Sputnik: The Next Generation&quot;, was also released there, selling 50,000 copies. In 1998, with Degville back on vocals and with Claudia Cujo on drums, the band started to perform again, resulting in the 2000 release of &quot;Piratespace&quot;.

In 2004, Degville left the band to pursue a solo career and has performed as Sputnik 2/ Sputnik 2 – The Future and Sigue Sigue Sputnik Electronic, self-releasing tracks under those and his own name over the years through www.sputnik2.com and other digital sites. In 2016, a 12&quot; vinyl version of a track called &quot;Timex Kid&quot; was released under the Sigue Sigue Sputnik Electronic name.

Neal X is a member of the Marc Almond band, and went on to form his own group, the Montecristos, which released its debut album &quot;Born to Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot; in 2015 following a successful crowd funding project.

Tony James formed the group Carbon/Silicon with Mick Jones which has released a number of free tracks digitally via www.carbonsilicon.com as well as selling music commercially, including the 2007 album release &quot;The Last Post&quot;.

James claimed he had chosen his bandmates for their looks, and the band&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Fleece the World&quot;. James billed the band as &quot;Hi-tech sex, designer violence, and the fifth generation of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;.

The themes and imagery in the band&#x27;s songs were often influenced by futuristic, dystopian or post-apocalyptic films such as &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;The Terminator&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and the &quot;Mad Max&quot; trilogy. Visually, their image included fishnet masks and brightly coloured hair.

<text>Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA)
is a term associated with Microsoft products that refers to the SPNEGO, Kerberos, and NTLMSSP authentication protocols with respect to SSPI functionality introduced with Microsoft Windows 2000 and included with later Windows NT-based operating systems. The term is used more commonly for the automatically authenticated connections between Microsoft Internet Information Services, Internet Explorer, and other Active Directory aware applications.

IWA is also known by several names like &quot;HTTP Negotiate authentication&quot;, &quot;NT Authentication&quot;, &quot;NTLM Authentication&quot;, &quot;Domain authentication&quot;, &quot;Windows Integrated Authentication&quot;, &quot;Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication&quot;, or simply &quot;Windows Authentication&quot;.

==Overview==
Integrated Windows Authentication uses the security features of Windows clients and servers. Unlike Basic Authentication or Digest Authentication, initially, it does not prompt users for a user name and password. The current Windows user information on the client computer is supplied by the web browser through a cryptographic exchange involving hashing with the Web server. If the authentication exchange initially fails to identify the user, the web browser will prompt the user for a Windows user account user name and password.

Integrated Windows Authentication itself is not a standard or an authentication protocol. When IWA is selected as an option of a program (e.g. within the &quot;Directory Security&quot; tab of the IIS site properties dialog) this implies that underlying security mechanisms should be used in a preferential order. If the Kerberos provider is functional and a Kerberos ticket can be obtained for the target, and any associated settings permit Kerberos authentication to occur (e.g. Intranet sites settings in Internet Explorer), the Kerberos 5 protocol will be attempted. Otherwise NTLMSSP authentication is attempted. Similarly, if Kerberos authentication is attempted, yet it fails, then NTLMSSP is attempted. IWA uses SPNEGO to allow initiators and acceptors to negotiate either Kerberos or NTLMSSP. Third party utilities have extended the Integrated Windows Authentication paradigm to UNIX, Linux and Mac systems.

==Supported web browsers==
Integrated Windows Authentication works with most modern web browsers, but does not work over some HTTP proxy servers. Therefore, it is best for use in intranets where all the clients are within a single domain. It may work with other web browsers if they have been configured to pass the user&#x27;s logon credentials to the server that is requesting authentication. Where a proxy itself requires NTLM authentication, some applications like Java may not work because the protocol is not described in RFC-2069 for proxy authentication.

* Internet Explorer 2 and later versions.
* In Mozilla Firefox on Windows operating systems, the names of the domains/websites to which the authentication is to be passed can be entered (comma delimited for multiple domains) for the &quot;&quot;network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris&quot; (for Kerberos) or in the &quot;network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris&quot; (NTLM) Preference Name on the &quot;about:config&quot; page. On the Macintosh operating systems this works if you have a kerberos ticket (use negotiate). Some websites may also require configuring the &quot;network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris&quot;&quot;.
* Opera 9.01 and later versions can use NTLM/Negotiate, but will use Basic or Digest authentication if that is offered by the server.
* Google Chrome works as of 8.0.
* Safari works, once you have a Kerberos ticket.
* Microsoft Edge 77 and later.

==Supported mobile browsers==
iOS natively supports Kerberos via Kerberos Single Sign-on extension. Configuring the extension enables Safari and Edge to use Kerberos.

Android has SPNEGO support in Chrome which is adding Kerberos support with a solution like Hypergate Authenticator.

<text>The Borough of Basildon is a local government district with borough status in Essex, England. It is named after its largest town, Basildon, where the council is based. The borough also includes the towns of Billericay and Wickford and surrounding rural areas.

The borough borders the City of Chelmsford to the north, the Borough of Brentwood to the west, the Thurrock unitary authority area to the south, the Borough of Castle Point to the south-east, and Rochford District to the north-east.

==History==
Billericay Urban District was created in 1934. In 1955 it was renamed Basildon Urban District to reflect the growth of Basildon, which had been designated a new town in 1949. In the 1990’s Basildon applied to become a unitary authority but this was declined, with the government asserting that the divergent interests of the three main towns meant any change to the status quo should involve splitting the borough; with Billericay and Wickford joining the districts of Brentwood and Rochford respectively.

Urban districts were abolished on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. On this date, a new non-metropolitan district called Basildon was created, covering the whole area of the former Basildon Urban District plus the small part of the neighbouring Thurrock Urban District which fell within the designated area for Basildon New Town.

The district was awarded borough status in 2010, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor, with Mo Larkin being appointed the first mayor.

==Governance==


Basildon Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Essex County Council. Parts of the borough are also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2024 election, with Labour the largest party. An administration of Labour and the independent councillors subsequently formed to run the council.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Basildon. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2009 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council was:
The six independents sit together as a group. The next election is due in May 2028.

===Premises===
The council has its headquarters at the Basildon Centre on St Martin&#x27;s Square in Basildon Town Centre. The building was purpose-built for the council in 1989 at a cost of £17.5 million. It was formally opened on 14 November 1989 by Jack Cunningham, the Shadow Leader of the House of Commons. The building also contains the town&#x27;s library.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2024, the council has comprised 42 councillors representing 14 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held in three out of every four years, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) elected each time for a four-year term of office. Essex County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

==Towns and parishes==

There are nine civil parishes in the borough. The town of Basildon itself is an unparished area, as is a small area west of Wickford. The parish councils for Billericay and Wickford are styled &quot;town councils&quot;, whilst that for Great Burstead and South Green is styled a &quot;village council&quot;. The civil parishes are:
*Billericay
*Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet
*Great Burstead and South Green
*Little Burstead
*Noak Bridge
*Ramsden Bellhouse
*Ramsden Crays
*Shotgate
*Wickford
==Geography==

The district has three main urban areas: Basildon, Billericay and Wickford. Proposals to move Billericay and Wickford to other districts, leaving Basildon district more focused on the new town, were considered in the 1990s but rejected.

The new town of Basildon grew to absorb four earlier settlements: Laindon, Basildon, Vange and Pitsea (from west to east) which have merged with other minor hamlets.

The remaining land, approximately half of the district is designated as green belt, has several sites of special scientific interest. Two are around Billericay and the remainder are to the south of Basildon New Town. There are also wildlife areas of varying sizes around most of the district, except in the East.

The source of the River Crouch is in the district. The river runs across the district, through Wickford before it leaves the district.

The district is linked well by road and rail with significant surrounding destinations, including London.

In the west of the Basildon district, the Dunton Plotlands is an area of small plots of land used as weekend cottages or smallholdings inhabited during the mid twentieth century.

=== List of settlements ===
It contains the towns of:

* Basildon (the administrative headquarters)
** Laindon
** Langdon Hills
** Pitsea
** Vange
* Billericay
* Wickford

Villages within the district are:
* Bowers Gifford
* Crays Hill
* Dunton Wayletts
* Great Burstead
* Havering&#x27;s Grove (part)
* Little Burstead
* Nevendon
* North Benfleet
* Ramsden Bellhouse
* Shotgate
* Great Berry

==Regeneration plans==
Basildon District is a prosperous business location and has in recent years seen significant inward investment and jobs growth. Throughout Basildon District there are major developments planned estimated to total nearly £2 billion. These include:

*The regeneration of Basildon, Wickford, Pitsea, and Laindon Town Centres
*A new Sporting Village and improvements to playing pitches and sports facilities throughout the District to make Basildon the Centre for Sport in South Essex. The sporting village is expected in 2010, and is being highly sought after as an Olympic training base for one of the top teams, including the Russians. Its combined benefits, of having some of the top facilities so close to London, including one of the few Olympic (50m) size pools in the UK, will make it a true asset to whatever team(s) use it.
*The creation of a health and education research centre near Basildon and Thurrock University Hospital and FE College
*Investment in the Basildon Enterprise Corridor, the largest business area in the Thames Gateway outside London, home to 45,000 jobs and over 5,000 businesses, including Ford, Selex, Visteon, Case New Holland, First Data Europe, International Financial Services Limited, RBS, and Starbucks
*The creation of one of the largest wetland nature reserves in Europe in the Thames Marshes by the RSPB, Land Restoration Trust, Basildon District Council and Veolia
*A strategic review of the District&#x27;s housing, with investment in housing estates such as Craylands, Five Links and Felmores to create first class places to live

Coordinating and promoting this programme of investment is the Basildon Renaissance Partnership which was set up in 2003 by Basildon District Council. Its partners also include the East of England Development Agency, English Partnerships, Essex County Council, and the Thames Gateway South Essex Partnership with support from the Department for Communities and Local Government.

The BBC noted the council had decided to sell for £1 a plot of land it bought next to the golf course for £1m in order to build a 4 star hotel. The Conservative leader described the sale as doomed to failure.

==Transport==
The district is connected to London and Southend via two train operators: c2c and Abellio Greater Anglia. The route operated by c2c is the London, Tilbury and Southend line. Three principal stations of the railway line are in the district: Basildon railway station, Laindon railway station and Pitsea railway station

The former Great Eastern service (now Abellio Greater Anglia) operates on the Shenfield to Southend Line. Trains stop at Billericay and Wickford railway station. At Wickford, the Crouch Valley Line diverges from the Shenfield to Southend line.

Three primary routes are within the district. The A127 goes through its centre, the A13 goes through the south-east at Pitsea. Both these primary routes connect the district with Greater London and Southend-on-Sea. At Bowers Gifford at a terminus of the A13&#x27;s primary status there is a junction with the beginning of primary status for the A130 with runs along a small section of the western boundary of the district. The A130 connects the district with Chelmsford. The A129 is the major road link between Billericay and Wickford, which are linked via A-Roads to the urban area of Basildon, Pitsea and Laindon by the A176 and the A132, respectively.

<text>Sir Malik Ghulam Muhammad (20 April 1895 – 29 August 1956) was a Pakistani politician and economist who served as the third governor-general of Pakistan from 1951 to 1955.

Educated at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), he joined the Indian Civil Service as a chartered accountant at the Indian Railway Accounts Service before being promoted to join the Ministry of Finance under Liaquat Ali Khan in 1946. After the Independence of Pakistan in 1947, he joined the Liaquat administration as the country&#x27;s first Finance Minister where he helped draft the first five-year plans to alleviate the national economy. He co-founded Mahindra &amp; Mohammed in 1945 (later Mahindra &amp; Mahindra in 1948) with Jagdish Chandra Mahindra and Kailash Chandra Mahindra.

Following the assassination of prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan in 1951, Malik was invited to be the Governor-General by Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin who himself took over the government as Prime Minister. Nationwide violence in the aftermath of the language movement in East Bengal and religious riots in Lahore made him dismiss the Nazimuddin administration using the reserve powers to restore stability. In 1955, he was forced to resign from the post of Governor-General due to worsening of his health conditions by then-Interior Minister Iskandar Ali Mirza, who himself took control of the office. After resignation, he fought a brief but unsuccessful battle with his illness, that ultimately resulted in his death in 1956.

His personal image is viewed negatively by Pakistan&#x27;s historians, criticized for giving rise to political intrigue, undermining the civilian control of the military by authorizing martial law in Pakistan, and devaluing nascent democratic norms by sacking the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan during Prime Minister Bogra&#x27;s tenure.

==Biography==

===Family background and education===

Malik Ghulam Muhammad was born in a Kakazai family, in suburban neighbourhood near Mochi Gate, in Lahore, Punjab, India. After completing his schooling in Lahore, he went to Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh to attend the MAO College of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), and was a roommate of Nazir Ahmed, a physicist and a bureaucrat. At AMU he gained a BA degree in accountancy.

===Civil service and business interests===

After graduating from AMU, he joined the Audit and Accounts Service in March 1920. In January 1921, he received his first official appointment as assistant audit officer with the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. Upon its merger into the East Indian Railway in 1925, Muhammad was briefly appointed a government executor of accounts with the Bengal and North Western Railway, serving in this capacity from January to November. Having earned a reputation as an able and competent accountant, he was then appointed to the Indian Railway Board before becoming the Controller of General Supplies and Purchase of the Indian Railways. From June 1932 to February 1934, he was attached to the administration of Bhopal State, and worked under its nawab, Hamidullah Khan. In March 1934, he returned to government service and was appointed deputy accountant-general (posts and telegraphs); in May, he was appointed as officiating deputy director-general (posts and telegraphs, finance), and was confirmed in the appointment in January 1935. In July 1936, he was appointed as officiating financial officer in the same department, was confirmed in his appointment in April 1937 and was promoted to financial officer (communications) in October.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Muhammad was successively appointed to increasingly important positions: chief controller of stores in March 1940, controller-general of purchase in September 1940 and additional secretary to the Department of Supply in March 1941.
His wartime services as a professional accountant were recognized by the British government that year when he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1941 Birthday Honours list. In May 1942, Muhammad was assigned to the Hyderabad State administration, in which he served as an advisor to the Nizam of Hyderabad.

In 1945, he helped co-found the Mahindra and Mohamed Steel Company together with steel industrialists, JC Mahindra and KC Mahindra where Muhammad served the company&#x27;s chartered accountant. In 1945–47, the company initially registered as the Mahindra &amp; Mohammad, and started the licensed production of the Willys jeeps in Bombay as Muhammad looked after the company&#x27;s revenue and finances.

After World War II, he was asked by Nawab of Bahawalpur, Sir Sadeq Mohammad Khan V to represent him at the Round Table Conferences, and during this time, he began formatting political relations with Liaquat Ali Khan. He left Hyderabad to join the Ministry of Finance in 1946. In the 1946 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours List, the last honours list in which Indian civil servants were recognised, he received a knighthood.

==Finance Minister (1947–51)==

In 1946–47, Muhammad left Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and joined the Ministry of Finance as a Cabinet Secretary under Finance Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, assisting him in drafting and preparing India&#x27;s first union budget.

After witnessing the Partition of India in 1947, he decided to acquire the citizenship of Pakistan and permanently settled in his native city, Lahore, on 14 August 1947. He was brought up in the Liaquat administration when Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan appointed him as country&#x27;s first Finance Minister. He presented the first budget and submitted the draft of the First Five-Year Plans in 1948.

In 1949, Muhammad invited leaders of the Muslim world to the International Islamic Economics Organization in Pakistan, where he emphasised the idea of a Muslim economic bloc. During this time, he survived the fatal attack of paralysis that made him unable to talk or move effectively and began experiencing with poor health conditions.

==Governor-General==

As early as 1951, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan had made a decision of removing Finance Minister Ghulam Muhammad due to his continuing worsening health conditions. However, the decision was not taken due to the assassination of Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan in October 1951. On 17 October 1951, Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin nominated himself to succeed as Prime Minister, appointing his own cabinet, and consequently resigned his position as Governor-General of Pakistan and recommended King George VI to appoint Muhammad to succeed him as Governor-General.

In 1953, Muhammad represented Pakistan at the Coronation of Elizabeth II in Westminster Abbey alongside the Governors-General from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Union of South Africa and Dominion of Ceylon. Upon returning to Pakistan, he witnessed the agitation caused by the language movement in Dacca in East Pakistan, and the series of anti-Qadiyani protests in Lahore, Punjab in Pakistan. Both events led him to use the reserve powers awarded by the Government of India Act 1935 against Prime Minister Nazimuddin, effectively dismissing his administration only to be replaced with diplomat M. A. Bogra.

In 1954, the Constituent Assembly made legislative attempts to try changing the 1935 act to establish checks and balances on the Governor-General&#x27;s powers. In response, Muhammad dismissed the Constituent Assembly, an action that was challenged in the Sindh High Court by Maulvi Tamizuddin, the Speaker of the Assembly. The Sindh High Court&#x27;s Chief Justice Sir George Constantine ruled the Governor-General&#x27;s decision unlawful, but the ruling was overturned by the Federal Court of Pakistan, led by Chief Justice Muhammad Munir, in a split decision.

Historians consider this action the beginning of viceregal politics in Pakistan, in which the military and civil bureaucracy, not elected officials, would gain increasing influence over the country&#x27;s policymaking.

During this time, Muhammad&#x27;s health began to deteriorate, and paralysis spread through his whole body, forcing him to take a leave of absence in 1955 to seek treatment in the United Kingdom. In his capacity, he appointed Interior Minister Iskandar Ali Mirza as acting Governor-General, but Mirza dismissed him from his post in order to take his place, supported by the Constituent Assembly&#x27;s legislators.

==Death==

On 29 August 1956, Malik Ghulam Muhammad died and was buried in Karachi in Foji Qabristan, next to Christian&#x27;s Graveyard, Gora Qabristan in Karachi.

<text>Pumpkinhead is a 1988 American supernatural horror film. It was the directorial debut of special effects artist Stan Winston. The film has built up a cult following since its release. The first in the &quot;Pumpkinhead&quot; franchise, it was followed by a direct-to-video sequel, two TV film sequels, and a comic book series. The film was originally called &quot;Vengeance: The Demon&quot; and it was inspired by a poem written by poet Ed Justin. The film inspired a video game called &quot;&quot;.

Production on a reboot from Paramount Players was announced in 2021.

== Plot ==
In 1957, Tom Harley waits inside his farm cabin with his wife and his son, Ed. A doomed man seeks sanctuary at Tom&#x27;s cabin, but Tom refuses and threatens to shoot him if he does not leave. Watching through a window, Ed witnesses the man being caught and killed by a monster.

In the present, Ed Harley is a widowed father and owns a small store in the country. He leaves his young son, Billy, alone while he runs an errand. A group of teenage campers stop by at Harley&#x27;s, and, while riding their dirt bikes, they mortally injure Billy by accident. One teen, Steve, stays with the boy until his father&#x27;s return; the &#x27;killer&#x27; flees the scene with his girlfriend, while the rest leave to find a phone. At their cabin, the campers fight about whether or not to call the police. Joel, who is personally responsible for the boy&#x27;s injury and is on probation for a similar incident, rips out the phone cord, knocks one of his friends unconscious and locks him and a girl in the closet to stop them from contacting the authorities.

Ed goes to see a witch named Haggis and offers her gold, but she says that she cannot wake the dead. Instead, Ed says that he wants revenge; the witch agrees to help, but warns him that vengeance comes with a terrible price. On her orders, Ed goes to an old graveyard in the mountains, digs up a corpse, and brings it back to the witch&#x27;s home. The witch uses blood from father and son to resurrect the corpse, which rises as a gigantic, spindly demonic monster referred to as &quot;Pumpkinhead&quot; by the locals.

Back at the cabin, Joel begins to experience remorse for his actions and decides to turn himself in to the police. The monster, however, has already arrived. One of the girls, Maggie, hears a voice whispering her name. Seemingly hypnotized, she follows the voice outside the cabin. Steve brings her out of her trance, but Pumpkinhead kills him. Ed experiences the murder through the monster&#x27;s eyes. While the campers search for Steve, Pumpkinhead drags away Maggie, and Ed again experiences the ensuing murder. He returns to the witch and begs her to stop the monster&#x27;s actions. The witch, however, tells him that nobody can stop Pumpkinhead and Ed will die if he interferes with the killing spree.

Joel confronts Pumpkinhead with a machete, but it swats him aside and drags away Kim, whom it drops from a fatal height. The three remaining campers unsuccessfully beg the locals for help. Ed arrives and shoots Pumpkinhead, but when Joel checks to see if the creature is still alive, it grabs a fallen rifle and impales him with it. A local boy, Bunt, helps the two remaining campers, Tracey and Chris, reach an abandoned church in the woods. Bunt relates the legend of the monster Pumpkinhead, explaining that the monster avenges one who was wronged. If anyone tries to stop Pumpkinhead or help his victims, that person becomes marked, too. Chris&#x27;s dirt bike fails to start after Pumpkinhead removes the drive chain; he lifts up the bike, with Chris still on it, and throws it against a tree. He then drags Chris back to Harley&#x27;s house, where Tracey, Bunt, and Ed have taken shelter.

Pumpkinhead captures Bunt. Ed stumbles out of the barn but is accidentally stabbed in the arm by a pitchfork. Both Ed and Pumpkinhead cry out in pain, and Pumpkinhead releases Bunt. Ed notices that Pumpkinhead&#x27;s head is turning more human as Ed himself appears more monstrous, then realizes that he and Pumpkinhead are one; the only way for Ed to kill the monster is to die himself.

Pumpkinhead grabs Tracey by the neck, but before he can kill her, Ed shoots himself in the head. Pumpkinhead momentarily collapses to the ground, then grabs Bunt again. Tracey takes the gun and Ed begs her to finish him off. Ed, now fully metamorphosed, appears to menace Tracey. She shoots him until both he and Pumpkinhead fall to the ground dead. Tracey, Bunt, and Chris then watch as Pumpkinhead bursts into flames. Later that night, the witch buries Ed in Pumpkinhead&#x27;s grave, ready to wait for the next person seeking revenge, and still wearing the necklace his son Billy made him.

== Cast ==
==Production==

&quot;Pumpkinhead&quot; was inspired by a poem by Ed Justin. The De Laurentiis Entertainment Group sent Stan Winston the script only expecting him to do the special creature effects, but Winston instead saw in the project as an opportunity to make it his directorial debut. Given Winston was then busy refining the story, he gave free reins regarding design to artists Alec Gillis, Shane Mahan, John Rosengrant and Tom Woodruff Jr., the last of whom also wore the Pumpkinhead suit. Winston&#x27;s experience regarding creature work enabled the effects not to use too much of the limited $3 million budget. Filming took place in Los Angeles, California.

== Release ==
The film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by United Artists in October 1988 and again in January 1989. In total, it grossed $4,385,516 total at the domestic box office.

The film was released on VHS in the US by MGM/UA Home Entertainment in May 1989 and again in April 1995. MGM released the film on DVD twice: once in 2000 as a standard edition and again in 2008 in a 20th Anniversary Edition featuring an audio commentary and over an hour of featurettes. It was released on Blu-ray by Scream Factory in September 2014. In October 2023, Scream Factory released a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray of the film.

== Reception ==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Pumpkinhead&quot; holds an approval rating of 65%, based on 23 reviews, and an average rating of 5.73/10. Its consensus reads: &quot;With effects work and solid direction from Stan Winston -- and Lance Henriksen adding welcome gravitas -- &quot;Pumpkinhead&quot; is a creature feature that stands a cut above&quot;.

Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;As a technician, Winston clearly knows how to make a monster, but as a director he&#x27;s yet to learn how to bring one to life&quot;. Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film has poor writing and acting, but it is surprisingly polished for a B movie. Chris Willman of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that, despite its poor writing, the premise is interesting, but it&#x27;s not executed as well as &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; rated it 2/5 stars and called it a &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; clone with &quot;little atmosphere and no surprises&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; rated it 2/5 stars and wrote that the film&#x27;s second half becomes tedious because of its overdone slasher formula.

In a 1992 retrospective, Jon Nalick of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as &quot;a well-executed film in a genre that is littered with dimwitted slasher flicks&quot;. Bloody Disgusting rated the film 4/5 stars and called it &quot;a gothic story of love, loss, vengeance, and redemption&quot;. Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central rated the film 4/5 stars and wrote that film &quot;stands as a timeless, dark fairy tale&quot;. Reviewing the 2000 DVD release, G. Noel Gross of DVD Talk rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote that the film is &quot;too good to pass over&quot;, despite its lackluster presentation. Nick Nunziata also criticized the 2000 DVD release and wrote that the film does not hold up. Nick Schager of The A.V. Club called it an endearing pulp film that lacks subtlety. Reviewing the film on Blu-ray, Ken Hanley of &quot;Starlog&quot; said it is &quot;one hell of an impressive directorial debut&quot;. Writing in &quot;Horror Films of the 1980s&quot;, critic John Kenneth Muir called it &quot;a meditation on vengeance&quot; that is &quot;surprising and rewarding&quot; for its rejection of vigilante justice, a popular theme in the 1980s.

== Legacy ==
Despite being a box office disappointment, &quot;Pumpkinhead&quot; has become a cult film. In 2013, Tyler Doupe included Pumpkinhead in his list of Underrated Horror Killers at Fearnet, and &quot;Fangoria&quot; included it in their 101 Best Horror Movies You&#x27;ve Never Seen.

=== Sequels and reboot ===
A sequel, &quot;Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings&quot;, was released directly to video in 1994. It was directed by Jeff Burr. Two additional sequels, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, were filmed in 2006 as made for television movies. They were broadcast on Syfy in October 2006 and in February 2007, respectively.

A reboot of the series has been reported to be in development and was to be produced by &quot;Saw&quot; executive producer Peter Block. Nate Atkins was set to write the script for the reboot. By November 2021, a reboot was in the works at Paramount Players, with a script ready and that a director would be announced &quot;in the coming months&quot;.

=== Comic book ===
In 1993, Dark Horse Comics published a &quot;Pumpkinhead&quot; comic book series called &quot;Pumpkinhead: The Rites of Exorcism&quot;. The comic was supposed to be a four-part mini-series but only two issues were published. The second one ended in a cliffhanger leaving readers with the prospect of a winged Pumpkinhead that would have appeared in the third issue.

Dynamite Entertainment began publishing a five issue &quot;Pumpkinhead&quot; limited series, written by Cullen Bunn and illustrated by Blacky Shepherd, in February 2018.

=== Video game ===
In 1995, Electronic Arts published a first-person shooter computer game for Microsoft Windows called &quot;&quot;. The game was poorly received.

=== Model kits ===
In 1991, GEOmetric Design, Inc. produced and marketed the first licensed Pumpkinhead model kit. It featured the demon on a display base depicting a portion of a burned out church. The model kit was sculpted by American artist Randy Bowen. The kit was discontinued when GEOmetric Design released its &quot;Pumpkinhead: The Metamorphosis&quot; kit in 1994. Sculpted by Japanese artist Takayuki Takeya (竹谷 隆之), the second kit was based on the Pumpkinhead sequel story written by Carducci and Gerani and published in the Dark Horse Comics series. The kit included a glossy, full-color booklet that concluded the canceled comic.

In 2005, Sideshow Collectibles released a Pumpkinhead maquette.

=== Music ===
The horror punk band The Misfits released a song entitled &quot;Pumpkin Head&quot;, which was featured on their album &quot;Famous Monsters&quot;, released in 1999.

<text>Wilhelm Julius Foerster (16 December 1832 – 18 January 1921) was a German astronomer. His name can also be written Förster, but is usually written &quot;Foerster&quot; even in most German sources where &#x27;ö&#x27; is otherwise used in the text.

== Biography ==
A native of Grünberg, Silesia, he studied at the University of Berlin and Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn, and worked as Johann Franz Encke&#x27;s assistant. In 1860, he co-discovered asteroid 62 Erato with Oskar Lesser, the first co-discovery on record. He became professor of astronomy at the University of Berlin in 1863. After Encke&#x27;s death in 1865, he became director of the Berlin Observatory and served in this position until 1904. Foerster also taught the popular geologist Alfred Wegener astronomy.

In 1868 he was appointed director of the commission established by the North German Confederation, and continued from 1871 by the German Empire, for the determination of standards of measurement. In this capacity, he superintended the reorganization of the German system of weights and measures on the metric basis. He was elected president of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in 1891.

In 1888–89, Foerster co-founded the Urania in Berlin, an institution for astronomical education that reached out to the wider public. Foerster continued to be interested in popularizing the natural sciences.

In 1892, he assisted in the founding of the German Society for Ethical Culture (GSEC; ), in which Albert Einstein also participated. He was also a member of the German Peace Society (), and resisted the rise in nationalism brought about by the outbreak of World War I. While he was among the 93 German intellectuals in signing the &quot;Aufruf an die Kulturwelt&quot; manifesto in support of the war, Foerster was one of only four intellectuals to sign the &quot;Aufruf an die Europäer&quot; counter-manifesto (the others were Albert Einstein, the philosopher Otto Buek, and its author, the physiologist Georg Friedrich Nicolai).

== Legacy ==

The asteroid 6771 Foerster is named after him, and so is the Wilhelm-Foerster-Sternwarte (Wilhelm Foerster Observatory; IAU code 544).

<text>Gas chromatography (GC) is a common type of chromatography used in analytical chemistry for separating and analyzing compounds that can be vaporized without decomposition. Typical uses of GC include testing the purity of a particular substance, or separating the different components of a mixture. In preparative chromatography, GC can be used to prepare pure compounds from a mixture.

Gas chromatography is also sometimes known as vapor-phase chromatography (VPC), or gas–liquid partition chromatography (GLPC). These alternative names, as well as their respective abbreviations, are frequently used in scientific literature.

Gas chromatography is the process of separating compounds in a mixture by injecting a gaseous or liquid sample into a mobile phase, typically called the carrier gas, and passing the gas through a stationary phase. The mobile phase is usually an inert gas or an unreactive gas such as helium, argon, nitrogen or hydrogen. The stationary phase can be solid or liquid, although most GC systems today use a polymeric liquid stationary phase. The stationary phase is contained inside of a separation column. Today, most GC columns are fused silica capillaries with an inner diameter of and a length of . The GC column is located inside an oven where the temperature of the gas can be controlled and the effluent coming off the column is monitored by a suitable detector.

== Operating principle ==

A gas chromatograph is made of a narrow tube, known as the &quot;column&quot;, through which the vaporized sample passes, carried along by a continuous flow of inert or nonreactive gas. Components of the sample pass through the column at different rates, depending on their chemical and physical properties and the resulting interactions with the column lining or filling, called the &quot;stationary phase&quot;. The column is typically enclosed within a temperature controlled oven. As the chemicals exit the end of the column, they are detected and identified electronically.

== History ==
===Background===
Chromatography dates to 1903 in the work of the Russian scientist, Mikhail Semenovich Tswett, who separated plant pigments via liquid column chromatography.

===Invention===
The invention of gas chromatography is generally attributed to Anthony T. James and Archer J.P. Martin. Their gas chromatograph used partition chromatography as the separating principle, rather than adsorption chromatography. The popularity of gas chromatography quickly rose after the development of the flame ionization detector.
Martin and another one of their colleagues, Richard Synge, with whom he shared the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, had noted in an earlier paper that chromatography might also be used to separate gases. Synge pursued other work while Martin continued his work with James.

===Gas adsorption chromatography precursors===
German physical chemist Erika Cremer in 1947 together with Austrian graduate student Fritz Prior developed what could be considered the first gas chromatograph that consisted of a carrier gas, a column packed with silica gel, and a thermal conductivity detector. They exhibited the chromatograph at ACHEMA in Frankfurt, but nobody was interested in it.
N.C. Turner with the Burrell Corporation introduced in 1943 a massive instrument that used a charcoal column and mercury vapors. Stig Claesson of Uppsala University published in 1946 his work on a charcoal column that also used mercury.
Gerhard Hesse, while a professor at the University of Marburg/Lahn decided to test the prevailing opinion among German chemists that molecules could not be separated in a moving gas stream. He set up a simple glass column filled with starch and successfully separated bromine and iodine using nitrogen as the carrier gas. He then built a system that flowed an inert gas through a glass condenser packed with silica gel and collected the eluted fractions.
Courtenay S.G Phillips of Oxford University investigated separation in a charcoal column using a thermal conductivity detector. He consulted with Claesson and decided to use displacement as his separating principle. After learning about the results of James and Martin, he switched to partition chromatography.

===Column technology===
Early gas chromatography used packed columns, made of block 1–5 m long, 1–5 mm diameter, and filled with particles. The resolution of packed columns was improved by the invention of capillary column, in which the stationary phase is coated on the inner wall of the capillary.

== Physical components ==
=== Autosamplers ===

The autosampler provides the means to introduce a sample automatically into the inlets. Manual insertion of the sample is possible but is no longer common. Automatic insertion provides better reproducibility and time-optimization.Different kinds of autosamplers exist. Autosamplers can be classified in relation to sample capacity (auto-injectors vs. autosamplers, where auto-injectors can work a small number of samples), to robotic technologies (XYZ robot vs. rotating robot – the most common), or to analysis:
* Liquid
* Static head-space by syringe technology
* Dynamic head-space by transfer-line technology
* Solid phase microextraction (SPME)

=== Inlets ===

The column inlet (or injector) provides the means to introduce a sample into a continuous flow of carrier gas. The inlet is a piece of hardware attached to the column head.

Common inlet types are:
* S/SL (split/splitless) injector – a sample is introduced into a heated small chamber via a syringe through a septum – the heat facilitates volatilization of the sample and sample matrix. The carrier gas then either sweeps the entirety (splitless mode) or a portion (split mode) of the sample into the column. In split mode, a part of the sample/carrier gas mixture in the injection chamber is exhausted through the split vent. Split injection is preferred when working with samples with high analyte concentrations (&gt;0.1%) whereas splitless injection is best suited for trace analysis with low amounts of analytes (&lt;0.01%). In splitless mode the split valve opens after a pre-set amount of time to purge heavier elements that would otherwise contaminate the system. This pre-set (splitless) time should be optimized, the shorter time (e.g., 0.2 min) ensures less tailing but loss in response, the longer time (2 min) increases tailing but also signal.
* On-column inlet – the sample is here introduced directly into the column in its entirety without heat, or at a temperature below the boiling point of the solvent. The low temperature condenses the sample into a narrow zone. The column and inlet can then be heated, releasing the sample into the gas phase. This ensures the lowest possible temperature for chromatography and keeps samples from decomposing above their boiling point.
* PTV injector – Temperature-programmed sample introduction was first described by Vogt in 1979. Originally Vogt developed the technique as a method for the introduction of large sample volumes (up to 250 μL) in capillary GC. Vogt introduced the sample into the liner at a controlled injection rate. The temperature of the liner was chosen slightly below the boiling point of the solvent. The low-boiling solvent was continuously evaporated and vented through the split line. Based on this technique, Poy developed the programmed temperature vaporising injector; PTV. By introducing the sample at a low initial liner temperature many of the disadvantages of the classic hot injection techniques could be circumvented.
* Gas source inlet or gas switching valve – gaseous samples in collection bottles are connected to what is most commonly a six-port switching valve. The carrier gas flow is not interrupted while a sample can be expanded into a previously evacuated sample loop. Upon switching, the contents of the sample loop are inserted into the carrier gas stream.
* P/T (purge-and-trap) system – An inert gas is bubbled through an aqueous sample causing insoluble volatile chemicals to be purged from the matrix. The volatiles are &#x27;trapped&#x27; on an absorbent column (known as a trap or concentrator) at ambient temperature. The trap is then heated and the volatiles are directed into the carrier gas stream. Samples requiring preconcentration or purification can be introduced via such a system, usually hooked up to the S/SL port.

The choice of carrier gas (mobile phase) is important. Hydrogen has a range of flow rates that are comparable to helium in efficiency. However, helium may be more efficient and provide the best separation if flow rates are optimized. Helium is non-flammable and works with a greater number of detectors and older instruments. Therefore, helium is the most common carrier gas used. However, the price of helium has gone up considerably over recent years, causing an increasing number of chromatographers to switch to hydrogen gas. Historical use, rather than rational consideration, may contribute to the continued preferential use of helium.

=== Detectors ===
Commonly used detectors are the flame ionization detector (FID) and the thermal conductivity detector (TCD). While TCDs are beneficial in that they are non-destructive, its low detection limit for most analytes inhibits widespread use. FIDs are sensitive primarily to hydrocarbons, and are more sensitive to them than TCD. FIDs cannot detect water or carbon dioxide which make them ideal for environmental organic analyte analysis. FID is two to three times more sensitive to analyte detection than TCD.

The TCD relies on the thermal conductivity of matter passing around a thin wire of tungsten-rhenium with a current traveling through it. In this set up helium or nitrogen serve as the carrier gas because of their relatively high thermal conductivity which keep the filament cool and maintain uniform resistivity and electrical efficiency of the filament. When analyte molecules elute from the column, mixed with carrier gas, the thermal conductivity decreases while there is an increase in filament temperature and resistivity resulting in fluctuations in voltage ultimately causing a detector response. Detector sensitivity is proportional to filament current while it is inversely proportional to the immediate environmental temperature of that detector as well as flow rate of the carrier gas.

In a flame ionization detector (FID), electrodes are placed adjacent to a flame fueled by hydrogen / air near the exit of the column, and when carbon containing compounds exit the column they are pyrolyzed by the flame. This detector works only for organic / hydrocarbon containing compounds due to the ability of the carbons to form cations and electrons upon pyrolysis which generates a current between the electrodes. The increase in current is translated and appears as a peak in a chromatogram. FIDs have low detection limits (a few picograms per second) but they are unable to generate ions from carbonyl containing carbons. FID compatible carrier gasses include helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and argon.

In FID, sometimes the stream is modified before entering the detector. A methanizer converts carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide into methane so that it can be detected. A different technology is the polyarc, by Activated Research Inc, that converts all compounds to methane.

Alkali flame detector (AFD) or alkali flame ionization detector (AFID) has high sensitivity to nitrogen and phosphorus, similar to NPD. However, the alkaline metal ions are supplied with the hydrogen gas, rather than a bead above the flame. For this reason AFD does not suffer the &quot;fatigue&quot; of the NPD, but provides a constant sensitivity over long period of time. In addition, when alkali ions are not added to the flame, AFD operates like a standard FID. A catalytic combustion detector (CCD) measures combustible hydrocarbons and hydrogen. Discharge ionization detector (DID) uses a high-voltage electric discharge to produce ions.

Flame photometric detector (FPD) uses a photomultiplier tube to detect spectral lines of the compounds as they are burned in a flame. Compounds eluting off the column are carried into a hydrogen fueled flame which excites specific elements in the molecules, and the excited elements (P,S, Halogens, Some Metals) emit light of specific characteristic wavelengths. The emitted light is filtered and detected by a photomultiplier tube. In particular, phosphorus emission is around 510–536 nm and sulfur emission is at 394 nm. With an atomic emission detector (AED), a sample eluting from a column enters a chamber which is energized by microwaves that induce a plasma. The plasma causes the analyte sample to decompose and certain elements generate an atomic emission spectra. The atomic emission spectra is diffracted by a diffraction grating and detected by a series of photomultiplier tubes or photo diodes.

Electron capture detector (ECD) uses a radioactive beta particle (electron) source to measure the degree of electron capture. ECD are used for the detection of molecules containing electronegative / withdrawing elements and functional groups like halogens, carbonyl, nitriles, nitro groups, and organometalics. In this type of detector either nitrogen or 5% methane in argon is used as the mobile phase carrier gas. The carrier gas passes between two electrodes placed at the end of the column, and adjacent to the cathode (negative electrode) resides a radioactive foil such as 63Ni. The radioactive foil emits a beta particle (electron) which collides with and ionizes the carrier gas to generate more ions resulting in a current. When analyte molecules with electronegative / withdrawing elements or functional groups electrons are captured which results in a decrease in current generating a detector response.

Nitrogen–phosphorus detector (NPD), a form of thermionic detector where nitrogen and phosphorus alter the work function on a specially coated bead and a resulting current is measured.

Dry electrolytic conductivity detector (DELCD) uses an air phase and high temperature (v. Coulsen) to measure chlorinated compounds.

Mass spectrometer (MS), also called GC-MS; highly effective and sensitive, even in a small quantity of sample. This detector can be used to identify the analytes in chromatograms by their mass spectrum. Some GC-MS are connected to an NMR spectrometer which acts as a backup detector. This combination is known as GC-MS-NMR. Some GC-MS-NMR are connected to an infrared spectrophotometer which acts as a backup detector. This combination is known as GC-MS-NMR-IR. It must, however, be stressed this is very rare as most analyses needed can be concluded via purely GC-MS.

Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) represents the most recent development in gas chromatography detectors. Most chemical species absorb and have unique gas phase absorption cross sections in the approximately 120–240 nm VUV wavelength range monitored. Where absorption cross sections are known for analytes, the VUV detector is capable of absolute determination (without calibration) of the number of molecules present in the flow cell in the absence of chemical interferences.

Olfactometric detector, also called GC-O, uses a human assessor to analyse the odour activity of compounds. With an odour port or a sniffing port, the quality of the odour, the intensity of the odour and the duration of the odour activity of a compound can be assessed.

Other detectors include the Hall electrolytic conductivity detector (ElCD), helium ionization detector (HID), infrared detector (IRD), photo-ionization detector (PID), pulsed discharge ionization detector (PDD), and thermionic ionization detector (TID).

== Methods ==
The method is the collection of conditions in which the GC operates for a given analysis. Method development is the process of determining what conditions are adequate and/or ideal for the analysis required.

Conditions which can be varied to accommodate a required analysis include inlet temperature, detector temperature, column temperature and temperature program, carrier gas and carrier gas flow rates, the column&#x27;s stationary phase, diameter and length, inlet type and flow rates, sample size and injection technique. Depending on the detector(s) (see below) installed on the GC, there may be a number of detector conditions that can also be varied. Some GCs also include valves which can change the route of sample and carrier flow. The timing of the opening and closing of these valves can be important to method development.

=== Carrier gas selection and flow rates ===
Typical carrier gases include helium, nitrogen, argon, and hydrogen. Which gas to use is usually determined by the detector being used, for example, a DID requires helium as the carrier gas. When analyzing gas samples the carrier is also selected based on the sample&#x27;s matrix, for example, when analyzing a mixture in argon, an argon carrier is preferred because the argon in the sample does not show up on the chromatogram. Safety and availability can also influence carrier selection.

The purity of the carrier gas is also frequently determined by the detector, though the level of sensitivity needed can also play a significant role. Typically, purities of 99.995% or higher are used. The most common purity grades required by modern instruments for the majority of sensitivities are 5.0 grades, or 99.999% pure meaning that there is a total of 10 ppm of impurities in the carrier gas that could affect the results. The highest purity grades in common use are 6.0 grades, but the need for detection at very low levels in some forensic and environmental applications has driven the need for carrier gases at 7.0 grade purity and these are now commercially available. Trade names for typical purities include &quot;Zero Grade&quot;, &quot;Ultra-High Purity (UHP) Grade&quot;, &quot;4.5 Grade&quot; and &quot;5.0 Grade&quot;.

The carrier gas linear velocity affects the analysis in the same way that temperature does (see above). The higher the linear velocity the faster the analysis, but the lower the separation between analytes. Selecting the linear velocity is therefore the same compromise between the level of separation and length of analysis as selecting the column temperature. The linear velocity will be implemented by means of the carrier gas flow rate, with regards to the inner diameter of the column.

With GCs made before the 1990s, carrier flow rate was controlled indirectly by controlling the carrier inlet pressure, or &quot;column head pressure&quot;. The actual flow rate was measured at the outlet of the column or the detector with an electronic flow meter, or a bubble flow meter, and could be an involved, time consuming, and frustrating process. It was not possible to vary the pressure setting during the run, and thus the flow was essentially constant during the analysis. The relation between flow rate and inlet pressure is calculated with Poiseuille&#x27;s equation for compressible fluids.

Many modern GCs, however, electronically measure the flow rate, and electronically control the carrier gas pressure to set the flow rate. Consequently, carrier pressures and flow rates can be adjusted during the run, creating pressure/flow programs similar to temperature programs.

=== Stationary compound selection ===
The polarity of the solute is crucial for the choice of stationary compound, which in an optimal case would have a similar polarity as the solute. Common stationary phases in open tubular columns are cyanopropylphenyl dimethyl polysiloxane, carbowax polyethyleneglycol, biscyanopropyl cyanopropylphenyl polysiloxane and diphenyl dimethyl polysiloxane. For packed columns more options are available.

=== Inlet types and flow rates ===
The choice of inlet type and injection technique depends on if the sample is in liquid, gas, adsorbed, or solid form, and on whether a solvent matrix is present that has to be vaporized. Dissolved samples can be introduced directly onto the column via a COC injector, if the conditions are well known; if a solvent matrix has to be vaporized and partially removed, a S/SL injector is used (most common injection technique); gaseous samples (e.g., air cylinders) are usually injected using a gas switching valve system; adsorbed samples (e.g., on adsorbent tubes) are introduced using either an external (on-line or off-line) desorption apparatus such as a purge-and-trap system, or are desorbed in the injector (SPME applications).

=== Sample size and injection technique ===

==== Sample injection ====
The real chromatographic analysis starts with the introduction of the sample onto the column. The development of capillary gas chromatography resulted in many practical problems with the injection technique. The technique of on-column injection, often used with packed columns, is usually not possible with capillary columns. In the injection system in the capillary gas chromatograph the amount injected should not overload the column and
the width of the injected plug should be small compared to the spreading due to the chromatographic process. Failure to comply with this latter requirement will reduce the separation capability of the column. As a general rule, the volume injected, Vinj, and the volume of the detector cell, Vdet, should be about 1/10 of the volume occupied by the portion of sample containing the molecules of interest (analytes) when they exit the column.

Some general requirements which a good injection technique should fulfill are that it should be possible to obtain the column&#x27;s optimum separation efficiency, it should allow accurate and reproducible injections of small amounts of representative samples, it should induce no change in sample composition, it should not exhibit discrimination based on differences in boiling point, polarity, concentration or thermal/catalytic stability, and it should be applicable for trace analysis as well as for undiluted samples.

However, there are a number of problems inherent in the use of syringes for injection. Even the best syringes claim an accuracy of only 3%, and in unskilled hands, errors are much larger. The needle may cut small pieces of rubber from the septum as it injects sample through it. These can block the needle and prevent the syringe filling the next time it is used. It may not be obvious that this has happened. A fraction of the sample may get trapped in the rubber, to be released during subsequent injections. This can give rise to ghost peaks in the chromatogram. There may be selective loss of the more volatile components of the sample by evaporation from the tip of the needle.

=== Column selection ===
The choice of column depends on the sample and the active measured. The main chemical attribute regarded when choosing a column is the polarity of the mixture, but functional groups can play a large part in column selection. The polarity of the sample must closely match the polarity of the column stationary phase to increase resolution and separation while reducing run time. The separation and run time also depends on the film thickness (of the stationary phase), the column diameter and the column length.

=== Column temperature and temperature program ===
The column(s) in a GC are contained in an oven, the temperature of which is precisely controlled electronically. (When discussing the &quot;temperature of the column,&quot; an analyst is technically referring to the temperature of the column oven. The distinction, however, is not important and will not subsequently be made in this article.)

The rate at which a sample passes through the column is directly proportional to the temperature of the column. The higher the column temperature, the faster the sample moves through the column. However, the faster a sample moves through the column, the less it interacts with the stationary phase, and the less the analytes are separated.

In general, the column temperature is selected to compromise between the length of the analysis and the level of separation.

A method which holds the column at the same temperature for the entire analysis is called &quot;isothermal&quot;. Most methods, however, increase the column temperature during the analysis, the initial temperature, rate of temperature increase (the temperature &quot;ramp&quot;), and final temperature are called the temperature program.

A temperature program allows analytes that elute early in the analysis to separate adequately, while shortening the time it takes for late-eluting analytes to pass through the column.

== Data reduction and analysis ==

=== Qualitative analysis ===

Generally, chromatographic data is presented as a graph of detector response (y-axis) against retention time (x-axis), which is called a chromatogram. This provides a spectrum of peaks for a sample representing the analytes present in a sample eluting from the column at different times. Retention time can be used to identify analytes if the method conditions are constant. Also, the pattern of peaks will be constant for a sample under constant conditions and can identify complex mixtures of analytes. However, in most modern applications, the GC is connected to a mass spectrometer or similar detector that is capable of identifying the analytes represented by the peaks.

=== Quantitative analysis ===

The area under a peak is proportional to the amount of analyte present in the chromatogram. By calculating the area of the peak using the mathematical function of integration, the concentration of an analyte in the original sample can be determined. Concentration can be calculated using a calibration curve created by finding the response for a series of concentrations of analyte, or by determining the relative response factor of an analyte. The relative response factor is the expected ratio of an analyte to an internal standard (or external standard) and is calculated by finding the response of a known amount of analyte and a constant amount of internal standard (a chemical added to the sample at a constant concentration, with a distinct retention time to the analyte).

In most modern GC-MS systems, computer software is used to draw and integrate peaks, and match MS spectra to library spectra.

== Applications ==
In general, substances that vaporize below 300 °C (and therefore are stable up to that temperature) can be measured quantitatively. The samples are also required to be salt-free; they should not contain ions. Very minute amounts of a substance can be measured, but it is often required that the sample must be measured in comparison to a sample containing the pure, suspected substance known as a reference standard.

Various temperature programs can be used to make the readings more meaningful; for example to differentiate between substances that behave similarly during the GC process.

Professionals working with GC analyze the content of a chemical product, for example in assuring the quality of products in the chemical industry; or measuring chemicals in soil, air or water, such as soil gases. GC is very accurate if used properly and can measure picomoles of a substance in a 1 ml liquid sample, or parts-per-billion concentrations in gaseous samples.

In practical courses at colleges, students sometimes get acquainted to the GC by studying the contents of lavender oil or measuring the ethylene that is secreted by &quot;Nicotiana benthamiana&quot; plants after artificially injuring their leaves. These GC analyse hydrocarbons (C2-C40+). In a typical experiment, a packed column is used to separate the light gases, which are then detected with a TCD. The hydrocarbons are separated using a capillary column and detected with a FID. A complication with light gas analyses that include H2 is that He, which is the most common and most sensitive inert carrier (sensitivity is proportional to molecular mass) has an almost identical thermal conductivity to hydrogen (it is the difference in thermal conductivity between two separate filaments in a Wheatstone Bridge type arrangement that shows when a component has been eluted). For this reason, dual TCD instruments used with a separate channel for hydrogen that uses nitrogen as a carrier are common. Argon is often used when analysing gas phase chemistry reactions such as F-T synthesis so that a single carrier gas can be used rather than two separate ones. The sensitivity is reduced, but this is a trade off for simplicity in the gas supply.

Gas chromatography is used extensively in forensic science. Disciplines as diverse as solid drug dose (pre-consumption form) identification and quantification, arson investigation, paint chip analysis, and toxicology cases, employ GC to identify and quantify various biological specimens and crime-scene evidence.

<doc id="596708" wikidata="Q467079" url="?curid=596708" title="American Top 40">
<text>American Top 40 (abbreviated to AT40) is an internationally syndicated, independent song countdown radio program created by Casey Kasem, Don Bustany, Tom Rounds, and Ron Jacobs. The program is currently hosted by Ryan Seacrest and presented as an adjunct to his weekday radio program, &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot;.

Originally a production of Watermark Inc. (later a division of ABC Radio known as ABC Watermark, now Cumulus Media Networks which merged with Westwood One), &quot;American Top 40&quot; is now distributed by Premiere Networks (a division of iHeartMedia). Nearly 500 radio stations in the United States, the Armed Forces Network, and multiple other stations worldwide air &quot;American Top 40&quot;, and the show streams through several venues, including iHeartMedia&#x27;s own iHeartRadio app.

Co-creator Kasem hosted the original &quot;American Top 40&quot; from its inauguration on July 4, 1970, until August 6, 1988. Shadoe Stevens took over the program on August 13, 1988, and hosted until January 28, 1995, when the original program came to an end. Three years later, Kasem teamed up with Premiere&#x27;s predecessor AMFM Radio Networks to relaunch &quot;American Top 40&quot;. Kasem, who had spent nine years hosting his own countdown &quot;Casey&#x27;s Top 40&quot; for Westwood One, returned to hosting his creation on March 28, 1998. Seacrest took over &quot;American Top 40&quot; on January 10, 2004, following Kasem&#x27;s retirement from the series.

Currently, &quot;American Top 40&quot; with Seacrest airs in two formats, with one distributed to Contemporary Hit Radio (Top 40) stations and the other to Hot Adult Contemporary stations. However, there is no distinction made between the two shows on air. There are also two classic editions of the original &quot;American Top 40&quot; distributed every weekend, featuring past Kasem-hosted shows from the 1970s and 1980s.

In its early years, &quot;American Top 40&quot; used the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts to compile the countdown, touting it as &quot;the only source&quot;. The program subsequently switched to being based on &quot;Radio and Records&quot; airplay data upon its late 1990s return, until R&amp;R was folded into Billboard in 2009. The current source for the &quot;American Top 40&quot; charts are unpublished mainstream Top 40 and hot adult contemporary charts compiled by Mediabase (who had been the chart data supplier for &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;).

==History==

===1970–1988: First Casey Kasem era===
&quot;American Top 40&quot; began on the Independence Day weekend in 1970, on seven radio stations, the first being KDEO in El Cajon, California (now KECR), which broadcast the inaugural show the evening of July 3, 1970. &quot;Billboard&quot; reported prior to the release of the show that it had been sold to stations in 10 radio markets. Kasem was reportedly inspired by &quot;Make Believe Ballroom&quot;, a radio show that was nationally syndicated in the 1940s and popularized the concept of a disc jockey playing current popular recorded music on the air.

The chart data broadcast for the premiere show actually included the top 40 songs from the week ending July 11, 1970. The first show featured the last time both Elvis Presley and the Beatles had songs simultaneously in the Top 10. It was originally distributed by Watermark Inc., and was first presented in mono until February 24, 1973, when the first stereo vinyl copies were distributed. In early 1982, Watermark was purchased by ABC Radio and &quot;AT40&quot; became a program of the &quot;ABC Contemporary Radio Network&quot;. The program was hosted by Kasem and co-created by Kasem; Don Bustany, Kasem&#x27;s childhood friend from Detroit, MI; radio veteran Tom Rounds; and 93/KHJ Program Director Ron Jacobs, who produced and directed the various production elements. Rounds was also the marketing director; the initial funder was California strawberry grower Tom Driscoll.

The show began as a three-hour program written and directed by Bustany, counting down the top 40 songs on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 Singles chart. The show quickly gained popularity once it was commissioned, and expanded to a four-hour-program on October 7, 1978, to reflect the increasing average length of singles on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 chart. The producing staff expanded to eight people, some of them still in the business: Nikki Wine, Ben Marichal, Scott Paton, Matt Wilson, Merrill Shindler, Guy Aoki, Ronnie Allen, and Sandy Stert Benjamin. (Bustany retired from &quot;AT40&quot; in 1989; beginning in 1994, he hosted a political talk show on listener-sponsored KPFK.) By the early 1980s, the show could be heard on 520 stations in the United States and at its zenith, the show was broadcast on 1,000-plus stations in some 50 countries. In the 1980s, it aired in the United Kingdom on Signal Radio, DevonAir, Radio 210, County Sound, Chiltern Radio, Northants 96, Radio Tees, Saxon Radio and Fox FM and was also transmitted on Manx Radio. Kasem told the New York Times in 1990 &quot;I accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative. That is the timeless thing.&quot;

====Features of the Kasem-era shows====
During Kasem&#x27;s run as host, the &quot;AT40&quot; show had a number of popular and distinguishing features, some of which Kasem had done for some time at such stations as KRLA in Los Angeles:

* Number jingles: Occasionally, a song was preceded by a brief audio clip of a group of singers announcing the song&#x27;s position on the chart (e.g. &quot;Number 40!&quot;). This was especially common for the first song played in each hour of the show and often for the first song after a commercial break, but was usually not done for the number-one song (which was usually introduced with a drum roll), or for songs preceded by a story. The &quot;number&quot; jingles were updated and re-recorded from time to time, and by the mid-1980s, the show began using two sets of &quot;number&quot; jingles: the standard set, to be used with up-tempo songs; and a softer alternative set, usually used with low-key or romantic songs.
* Long Distance Dedication: This feature evolved from a spoken-word 45 single that Kasem had recorded in 1964, &quot;Letter from Elaina&quot;, in which a girl wrote to Kasem about her encounter with the Beatles.

In a 2007 Valentine&#x27;s Day special edition of &quot;American Top 10&quot; (and explained earlier in Rob Durkee&#x27;s book &quot;American Top 40: The Countdown of the Century&quot;), Kasem explained that the LDD feature was intended to be part of the show from the beginning. He knew, however, that it was going to take some time before a listener wrote in with a request and let the process proceed organically. Kasem&#x27;s patience proved correct, as staffer Matt Wilson found such a letter while checking the show&#x27;s mail in August 1978. The listener asked Kasem to play the song &quot;Desiree&quot; by Neil Diamond, which he dedicated to his girlfriend of the same name who was moving to West Germany to live with her family on an Army base. The request was fulfilled on the weekend of August 26, 1978; when that show was rebroadcast the weekend of August 25–26, 2007, Kasem recorded two optional segments (played at the discretion of the station) in which he did phone interviews with the man and his former girlfriend about the LDD. Most shows featured two long distance dedications, usually with one during each half of the show. (Sometimes, a song currently in the countdown was requested as a LDD; in such cases, Kasem would typically read the dedication first, and sometimes not even announce the song&#x27;s chart status until after the song was played.) This feature endured on &quot;AT40&quot; into Shadoe Stevens&#x27; run as host of the show, from 1988 to 1995, and also followed Kasem on his Westwood One shows, first as &quot;Request and Dedication&quot;, and then back to LDD when he returned to &quot;AT40&quot; in 1998. Long Distance Dedications were dropped after Ryan Seacrest became host in 2004, but they continued as part of Kasem&#x27;s adult contemporary countdowns.
* Great Radio Stations: Once an hour, generally halfway into the hour, Kasem relayed three or four radio stations that carried &quot;AT40&quot;, beginning each list with &quot;&quot;American Top 40&quot; is heard in the fifty states and around the world every week on great radio stations like ... &quot;. In the first few years of the program, Kasem said &quot;coast to coast&quot; instead of &quot;in the fifty states.&quot; One foreign &quot;AT40&quot; affiliate, or mention of Armed Forces Radio, was often included, usually as the last station in the list. In addition, new &quot;AT40&quot; affiliates were mentioned at the top of one of the hours (never the first hour). The multiple station mentions became a regular feature in 1972; prior to then, only one station was mentioned per hour. The first station mentioned on &quot;AT40&quot; was KMEN (now KKDD) in San Bernardino, California, on the August 29, 1970, program.
* Sign-off: After the number-one song was played, the bumper music began playing, and over that, Kasem typically reported that week&#x27;s chart date and read the end credits, then signed off with what became his, and the show&#x27;s, unofficial motto: &quot;Keep your feet on the ground, and keep reaching for the stars.&quot; Beginning with the show of June 25, 1977, he usually added &quot;and keep your radio tuned right where it is&quot;, as a way to help its affiliated stations improve listener loyalty; this phrase would be retired in 1984, but returned to the show when the &quot;AT40&quot; brand name was revived in the late 1990s (Kasem had also used it on &quot;Casey&#x27;s Top 40&quot; and its Adult Contemporary-format spinoffs). Guest hosts would be prohibited from using Kasem&#x27;s sign-off, but still used the &quot;keep your radio tuned right where it is&quot; phrase when its usage was in effect. Even his sign-on and sign-off music became popular, as &quot;Shuckatoom&quot; (composed by James R. Kirk) became a highly requested song, although it was never used apart from the show; &quot;Shuckatoom&quot; was first used to close &quot;AT40&quot; with the &quot;Top 40 Rock &amp; Roll Acts of the 1950s&quot; on October 4, 1975, and first used to open &quot;AT40&quot; on November 8, 1975.
* AT40 Archives: In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Kasem began a review of each number-one single of the 1970s played in chronological order at the rate of three per week spaced throughout the broadcast. When completed, he began a similar review of the each number-one single of the 1960s.

===1988–1995: Shadoe Stevens era===
In 1988, Kasem left the show over contract concerns with ABC and signed with Westwood One to host a competing weekly countdown. Industry trade paper &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported that the main disputes between Kasem and Watermark/ABC were over his salary (which Westwood One tripled upon his signing), because of declining ratings and a smaller group of stations airing the show. Kasem&#x27;s final &quot;AT40&quot; show, the 940th in the series, aired on August 6, 1988. Kasem was replaced by Shadoe Stevens, whose first &quot;American Top 40&quot; show aired on August 13, 1988, on 1,014 stations.

Later, Stevens and &quot;AT40&quot; lost a significant number of affiliates when, on January 21, 1989, Kasem&#x27;s Westwood One show launched. The program, titled &quot;Casey&#x27;s Top 40&quot;, used the weekly chart survey published by &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; (&quot;R&amp;R&quot;, which is based on radio airplay) instead of the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; chart &quot;AT40&quot; was still using (which at the time was based on record sales). Further complications arose when some stations that stayed with Stevens also added Kasem&#x27;s new show.

In an attempt to win back an audience, &quot;AT40&quot; tried new features, including interview clips, music news, top 5 flashbacks, and previews of upcoming chart hits (called the &quot;&quot;AT40&quot; Sneek Peek&quot;). It also stopped using the Hot 100 chart, switching first to the Hot 100 Airplay chart and finally to the Mainstream Top 40 chart. Later still, the countdown would use what was called a &quot;No Nuttin&#x27;&quot; gimmick that drew criticism; at various points of the show, a song would start immediately after the jingle for its position on the chart was played and Stevens would not offer any commentary until it concluded.

ABC kept &quot;American Top 40&quot; in its syndication lineup despite the continued lack of improvement in ratings, but in 1994 the network finally decided to cut its losses. ABC announced that after the July 9, 1994 edition of the program, it would be dropping &quot;AT40&quot; from its lineup and replacing it with &quot;Rick Dees Weekly Top 40&quot;. The move resulted in &quot;AT40&quot; completely disappearing from United States radio, as no network picked it up for distribution domestically. Despite this, &quot;AT40&quot; did not end production. Radio Express, the show&#x27;s international distributor, kept the program alive for the overseas markets that had not dropped the series after ABC&#x27;s cancellation.

On the weekend of January 28, 1995, the final episode of the original &quot;AT40&quot; was broadcast.

===1998–2004: &quot;American Top 40&quot; returns; second Casey Kasem era===
Two years later, in 1997, two separate and coincidental series of events would lead not only to the revival of &quot;American Top 40&quot;, but would also see the return of Kasem to host it.

When Kasem left ABC Radio in 1988, the branding still belonged to him and show co-creator Don Bustany through their joint production company. In order to continue using the name after Kasem&#x27;s contract with ABC Watermark expired, ABC would pay Kasem and Bustany a licensing fee. If, at any point in the future, &quot;AT40&quot; was to be cancelled, ABC would be required to attempt to use the branding in some form within a set period of time; if they did not, the network would lose the opportunity to continue licensing the brand and control of it would revert to Kasem and Bustany.

Bustany, however, decided to resign from the countdown shortly after Shadoe Stevens took over as the host. He would have no further involvement in production afterward. The agreement remained in force, though, and ABC eventually would be forced to return the branding rights in 1997 without making any sort of attempt to use them after the original &quot;AT40&quot; concluded in 1995; this resulted in Kasem acquiring sole control of the brand.

Meanwhile, Kasem&#x27;s contract at Westwood One was due for renewal and the relationship between the two sides was becoming contentious. After Kasem&#x27;s initial contract expired in 1993, Westwood One renewed it for four more years. Kasem had launched an adult contemporary countdown in 1992 as a companion to &quot;Casey&#x27;s Top 40&quot; called &quot;Casey&#x27;s Countdown&quot;, and in 1994 he added a third countdown for hot adult contemporary stations titled &quot;Casey&#x27;s Hot 20&quot;.

Things were not all positive, though. Westwood One had been acquired by Infinity Broadcasting Corporation in 1993, which put Kasem in the same fold as radio personalities such as Howard Stern. Then, in 1996, Infinity Broadcasting was purchased by CBS. Kasem grew frustrated that no effort had been made to cross promote his shows over CBS’ airwaves, and had also complained that he was not given as much promotion as he initially had been getting when he joined up with Westwood One in 1989, especially now that he was hosting three weekly programs for the network instead of one. Westwood One, meanwhile, did not feel that &quot;Casey&#x27;s Top 40&quot; was producing as much advertising revenue as it had been when Kasem&#x27;s contract was up for renewal four years earlier; the program did not have as many affiliates by 1997 as it had in 1993, and the two largest media markets (New York and Los Angeles) had dropped the program several years earlier. Another sticking point between the two sides, other than Kasem&#x27;s salary demands, was that Westwood One was not willing to let Kasem change the name of &quot;Casey&#x27;s Top 40&quot; to &quot;American Top 40&quot;.

The sides eventually put aside their differences, with Westwood One deciding that losing Kasem to a competitor was not worth their trouble and Kasem signed on for one more year in December 1997. However, after the February 21, 1998, edition of his weekend countdowns, Kasem disappeared from the airwaves without notice and, unbeknownst to Westwood One, with no intention of returning to work.

Chancellor Media, the media company founded by Roy Masters, and Kasem began negotiations to relaunch &quot;AT40&quot; for its newly launched syndication service called AMFM Radio Networks. A deal was finalized shortly after Kasem&#x27;s abrupt departure from Westwood One in which Chancellor would become owners of the &quot;AT40&quot; franchise and Kasem would return as host. Westwood One filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Kasem.

The revival of &quot;AT40&quot; premiered the weekend of March 28, 1998, one week after Westwood One finally cancelled the three countdowns Kasem was hosting for them after four weeks without him. Chancellor also brought Kasem&#x27;s AC countdowns to their network, with both now being branded as &quot;American Top 20&quot; (see Spin-off programming below). Masters sold Chancellor/AMFM to Clear Channel Communications (the predecessor of what is now iHeartMedia) in 1999, at which point &quot;AT40&quot; and other syndicated shows from AMFM Radio Networks were transferred into Premiere Radio Network.

The resurrected &quot;American Top 40&quot; kept the &quot;Radio and Records&quot; CHR/Pop chart previously used for &quot;Casey&#x27;s Top 40&quot; and was used as the basis for the show for the majority of this period.

In December 2003, as part of a new deal with Premiere Radio Networks, Kasem announced that he would retire from hosting &quot;American Top 40&quot; so he could focus on his duties hosting Hot AC and AC versions of the show, &quot;American Top 20.&quot; He also announced that the new host of &quot;AT40&quot; would be Ryan Seacrest, an afternoon DJ host from KYSR who was rapidly gaining stardom from his hosting of the successful music reality TV show &quot;American Idol&quot;.

Kasem&#x27;s last show as host of &quot;AT40&quot; aired on the weekend of January 3/4, 2004. His final No. 1 was Outkast&#x27;s &quot;Hey Ya!&quot;, which hit the top of the chart on the weekend of December 13, 2003.

===Since 2004: Ryan Seacrest era===

On January 10, 2004, American Idol host Ryan Seacrest took over the hosting duties of &quot;American Top 40&quot; from Kasem, although Kasem would continue to host &quot;American Top 20&quot; and &quot;American Top 10&quot; until his retirement in July 2009. With the host change, &quot;AT40&quot; underwent a makeover, using a new theme song and introducing several new features.

The show also began using a new chart that used no recurrent rule. On the first show with Ryan Seacrest, this led to several older songs reappearing after having dropped off many weeks earlier. Over the long term, it meant songs could spend long runs for about a year on the chart even after they went to recurrent status on other published charts. &quot;Here Without You&quot; by 3 Doors Down set a longevity record in 2004 for the CHR show by lasting 50 weeks before finally falling off. In 2006, &quot;Scars&quot; by Papa Roach would go on to tie the record. In 2011, Taio Cruz set &quot;AT40&quot; all time longevity record with his song &quot;Dynamite&quot;. This hit remained on the chart for 72 weeks, from July 2010 to November 2011. The record has since been broken by Rema &amp; Selena Gomez‘s song “Calm Down”, which remained on the chart for 75 weeks, from November 2022 to April 2024. On the Hot AC version of AT40, &quot;Use Somebody&quot; by Kings of Leon set the all-time record in 2011 at 117 consecutive weeks. &quot;American Top 40&quot; also became more interactive, involving online song voting and e-mail. In December 2006, the series&#x27; website was revamped, and the online song voting was discontinued in favor of publishing the Hot AC chart. The website also includes a toll-free number where fans can make requests and &quot;shoutouts&quot;, as they would to a local radio station, and by 2009 replayed clips of shoutouts became part of the show. Online song voting was later reinstated, with results of votes on &quot;American Top 40&quot; website factored into the chart rankings. AT40 was also expanded to social media through Twitter and Facebook where listeners from around the world will request a song to be included in the &quot;AT40&quot; Extra segment, as well as their own mobile application which is available for free download on the Apple AppStore for iOS devices and on Google Play for Android devices.
In March 2010, Premiere Radio Networks announced that &quot;American Top 5,&quot; a condensed daily top-5 countdown, would begin airing as part of the daily radio program &quot;On Air&quot;, also hosted by Seacrest.

In March 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Seacrest started to host &quot;AT40&quot; from his house; the show also included pre-recorded messages from artists thanking healthcare workers and encouraging listeners to stay home, practice social distancing, and to keep in touch with loved ones.

In August 2020, the show rebranded their logo for the 50th anniversary. It features lines similar to those on the edges of vinyl records. It was changed again in September 2021;
 the same month, Premiere announced the show had been renewed through 2025 with Seacrest as host.

, &quot;American Top 40&quot; is produced by Easton Allyn and Jennifer Sawalha, and engineered by James Rash.

==Competition==
&quot;American Top 40&quot; has faced numerous competitors since its debut in 1970. These include &quot;The Weekly Top 30 with Mark Elliott&quot; (1979–1982); several Dick Clark-hosted shows starting in 1981 with the &quot;National Music Survey&quot; and &quot;Countdown America&quot;, the latter of which was originally hosted by former R&amp;R CHR editor John Leader and later by Clark; &quot;Rockin&#x27; America Top 30 Countdown&quot; with then Z100 Program Director and personality Scott Shannon; and the &quot;Rick Dees Weekly Top 40&quot;, which has run continuously since 1983 with Rick Dees as host. Numerous other shows following the same format, both in the general top-40 category and in various specific radio formats, have aired over the course of &quot;AT40&#x27;s&quot; history as well. In addition to Dees&#x27; show, Mario Lopez, Carson Daly, and (in overseas via &quot;World Chart Show&quot;) Mike Savage, all host competing countdown shows targeted at the pop top 40 market.

==Rebroadcast of older shows==

===AT40 flashback===
From December 2000 to December 2002, many radio stations aired reruns of 1980–88 episodes under the title &quot;American Top 40 Flashback&quot;. The show was syndicated by Premiere Radio Networks. In its early weeks the shows were the original four-hour format of an &quot;American Top 40&quot; episode, but after the first month and a half the show was reduced to three hours. Although the national syndication of &quot;American Top 40 Flashback&quot; ceased in December 2002, radio station WMMX in Dayton, Ohio, continued to carry &quot;American Top 40 Flashback&quot; on Saturday mornings until the premiere of &quot;Casey Kasem&#x27;s &#x27;American Top 40: The 80s&quot;.

===Casey Kasem&#x27;s American Top 40: The 1970s and 1980s===
On August 4, 2006, XM Satellite Radio began replays of the original 1970s and 1980s &quot;AT40&quot; shows with Kasem that were digitally remastered from the original vinyl LPs and open-reel master tapes by Shannon Lynn of Charis Music Group. The event began with a weekend long marathon of original shows, with AT40 then being added as a regular show on two of XM&#x27;s Decades channels, &quot;The 70s on 7&quot; and &quot;The 80s on 8&quot;. With the merger of Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, these &quot;AT40&quot; shows began airing on both services on November 15, 2008. On the 70s on 7, it replaced the &#x27;Satellite Survey&#x27;, a Top 30 countdown of 1970s hits, produced by Sirius and hosted by Dave Hoeffel. On the 80s on 8, it replaced &#x27;The Big 40&#x27; countdown produced by Sirius and hosted by Nina Blackwood. As of October 11, 2009, Sirius XM replaced the &quot;AT40&quot; countdown on 80s on 8 and debuted a revised version of &#x27;The Big 40&#x27; countdown now co-hosted by three of the five original MTV VJs: Nina Blackwood, Mark Goodman and Alan Hunter (Martha Quinn was a fourth co-host from 2009 to 2015).

Sirius XM &quot;70s on 7&quot; currently runs &quot;AT40&quot; each Saturday at 12 pm with encore broadcasts the following Sunday at 9 am and at 12 midnight (Eastern Time). Most show dates roughly correspond to the current week in real time. A random episode is also featured on J.J.Walker&#x27;s show on &quot;70s on 7&quot; Thursdays at 9 pm ET. The mix of &quot;AT40&quot; episodes being run on XM include the year-end countdowns, which are typically run in two parts: the first half ( 100 through 51) in one time slot, and then the second half ( 50 through 1) in the following time slot. The AT40 specials are also part of XM&#x27;s rotation; for instance, &quot;&quot;AT40&quot; Goes to the Movies&quot; aired prior to the 2007 Academy Awards, and on February 24, &quot;The Top 40 Acts of the 80s So Far&quot; aired on XM 80s the first week of July 2007. Also, &quot;The Top 40 Songs of the Disco Era (1974–1979)&quot; aired on Sirius XM &quot;70s on 7&quot; the second weekend of July 2011. As of the weekend of February 11, 2023, the 6am and noon Saturday editions were discontinued and replaced by a single 9 am Saturday airing, with the Sunday airing moved to noon Eastern time.

From October through early November 2006, oldies radio station KQQL in Minneapolis/St. Paul, which is owned by iHeartMedia, ran a series of &quot;American Top 40&quot; episodes from the 1970s. Aside from one week, when the station attempted to air a four-hour episode from 1979 in the three-hour time slot (resulting in the show getting cut off at No. 11 and the top 10 not being heard), this test run was largely successful. Because of the success, Premiere Radio Networks decided to launch &quot;Casey Kasem&#x27;s &quot;American Top 40&quot;: The 1970s&quot; into national syndication featuring the three-hour shows from 1970 to 1978, and the last three hours of shows originally aired from October 1978 through December 1979. (One original four-hour program, first aired in October 1978, was edited into a three-hour program for re-airing in 2007, and the four-hour &quot;Disco Hits&quot; special from July 1979 with the first hour optional was aired in 2008, but until the fall of 2010, no other program from the last 15 months of the 1970s was included in the &quot;&quot;AT40&quot;: The 70s&quot; package. Starting in late 2010, Premiere began airing three-hour versions of four-hour &quot;AT40s&quot; from 1978 to 1979, beginning the broadcasts at the start of the countdown&#x27;s second hour; during the spring of 2012, Premiere began making the first hour of these programs &quot;optional,&quot; meaning that stations can choose to air all four hours of the four-hour programs, or just the last three.) Starting in 2012, whenever programs from 1970 to 1972 were scheduled to air, Premiere began offering affiliates the option of airing a later 1970s program instead (typically, a corresponding year from seven years later, or 1977–1979).

The 1980s version premiered on April 8, 2007, replacing the &quot;American Top 40 Flashback&quot; reruns. The shows are available in either their full original four-hour format, or an abbreviated three-hour version that omits the first hour of the show. To date, the latest program to air as part of the &quot;&quot;AT40&quot;: The 80s&quot; package has been August 6, 1988 – Kasem&#x27;s last show with the original program. Because the rights to Shadoe Stevens-era episodes were held by Cumulus Media, no programs from August 13, 1988, to 1995 have been re-aired as part of this or any similar block.

Newly produced extra segments hosted by voiceover talent Larry Morgan are available for use at stations&#x27; discretion. Prior to Kasem leaving Premiere Radio, these segments were hosted by his son Mike; when the series first began, these segments were hosted by one of Kasem&#x27;s former guest hosts, Ed McMann. These extra segments are also heard on the 80s show. KQQL was the first to sign on, airing programs beginning on December 30, 2006. Typically, the &quot;optional extras&quot; were songs that had yet to enter the top 40 of the Hot 100. However, some songs never reached the top 40 but had since become popular at classic hits/oldies/classic rock stations or certain novelty songs that were popularized by certain media events like the &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot; cliffhanger (recorded by Gary Burbank) and the Chicago Bears 1985–86 NFC win and the team itself recording a rap tune about going to the Super Bowl, while others were tributes to performers who had just died. For early 1970s programs, some of the &quot;optional extras&quot; were actually extras (i.e., &quot;oldies&quot;) that were originally a part of the original program; in this case, Kasem&#x27;s original commentary and introduction of the song were kept intact, in lieu of Morgan&#x27;s voiceover.

In March 2008, XM Satellite Radio rebranded the XM broadcasts with the &quot;Casey Kasem&#x27;s American Top 40&quot; name and logo used for terrestrial broadcasts, although XM still aired the commercial-free broadcasts, while Premiere Radio carried edited and recut broadcasts with commercials.

While Premiere Radio does not officially re-air programs other than the aforementioned 70s and 80s charts, most radio stations re-air the 1998-2003 Casey Kasem-hosted charts, often with the original commercials intact alongside local commercials. Since 2024, a channel airing the 1999-2003 charts, without any commercials, became available on iHeartRadio under the name &quot;American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: 90s and 2000s&quot; and using the Shadoe Stevens-era logo.

==Chart data used by &quot;American Top 40&quot;==

===&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine===
&quot;AT40&quot; used the top 40 songs from the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart from the show&#x27;s inception in 1970 to November 23, 1991. The chart was widely regarded as the industry standard for tracking the popularity of singles, and was thus a natural choice to be used. Kasem would frequently announce during the show that &quot;Billboard&quot; was the only source for the countdown. While using these charts worked well for the first half of the 1970s, as music changed during the decade and disco became popular on the charts, some rock stations began to drop the show because of complaints from program directors that &quot;AT40&quot; was playing too many songs not normally heard on their stations.

This gradually became a wide schism as rock splintered into several formats in the early 1980s. As a result, &quot;AT40&quot; weekly playlist could be very diverse in the styles and formats of the songs played. Historians have noted that no one station actually played all of the songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 list, because they represented overlapping formats, such as hard rock, mainstream rock, heavy metal, dance, new wave, punk, rap, pop, easy listening/adult contemporary and country. Stations tended to specialize in only one or two of these formats and completely ignore the others.

In November 1991, &quot;American Top 40&quot; switched to the Hot 100 Airplay chart (then known as the Top 40 Radio Monitor). These songs generally scored much higher radio airplay, and some were not even released as singles (such as &quot;Steel Bars&quot; by Michael Bolton). During this time, a few songs made very high debuts, including two that almost debuted in the No. 1 spot: &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; by Mariah Carey, which entered at No. 4, and &quot;Erotica&quot; by Madonna, which entered at No. 2.

In January 1993, &quot;American Top 40&quot; switched charts again, this time to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 Mainstream chart. This chart had more mainstream hits but fewer urban, dance and rap songs.

&quot;AT40&quot; did not always use the official year-end &quot;Billboard&quot; chart during the 25 years in which the show used &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. In 1972, 1973 and 1977, as well as 1980–1984 and 1990–1994, AT40 compiled its own year-end chart. These charts were often close to &quot;Billboard&quot;″s, but &quot;AT40&quot; would use a mid-December to early-December time period while &quot;Billboard&quot;″s survey year varied from year to year. &quot;AT40&quot; matched &quot;Billboard&quot;″s No. 1 year-end song every year except 1977, 1984, 1990 and 1993.

===&quot;Radio and Records&quot; magazine===
With the show&#x27;s revival in 1998, a new chart was implemented, the top 40 portion of &quot;Radio and Records&quot; CHR/Pop top 50 chart, which was already in use on &quot;Casey&#x27;s Top 40&quot;. This chart used a recurrent rule that removed songs below No. 25 that had exceeded 26 weeks in the top 50; these removals, if they occurred in the top 40, would be reflected on the appropriate week&#x27;s program. In 1999, the rule was modified to further restrict long chart runs: songs falling below 20 with at least 20 weeks in the top 50 would now be removed.

On October 21, 2000, &quot;American Top 40&quot; began using an unpublished chart on a weekly basis for the first time in its history. The chart seemed to be a variant of the CHR/Pop chart provided by Mediabase, the data provider to &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;. The most noticeable feature of this new chart was its ambiguous recurrent rule. Songs would be removed regularly from within the top 15, seemingly regardless of the number of weeks they had spent on the chart. Additionally, the chart has resulted in songs that otherwise peaked at 41–50 on R&amp;R&#x27;s charts appearing on the &quot;AT40&quot; charts. This chart lasted until August 11, 2001, when &quot;AT40&quot; returned to the &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; pop chart. The return coincided with another modification in the recurrent rule; songs would be removed below No. 25 after three consecutive weeks without a bullet (an increase in radio plays). This change would be short-lived, as in November 2001, &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; returned to the 20 weeks/below No. 20 rule, which remained in place for the remainder of Kasem&#x27;s tenure.

== Spin-off programming ==
===Adult Contemporary countdowns===
When Kasem joined what was then AMFM Radio Networks, he had been doing two weekly countdowns for adult contemporary formatted stations. Both of these shows would find a home with him at his new syndicator and were rebranded once he joined. Both shows took the name &quot;American Top 20&quot; (&quot;AT20&quot;) and launched the same weekend as Kasem&#x27;s new &quot;AT40&quot;. He would concurrently host both shows with &quot;AT40&quot; until he handed the show over to Ryan Seacrest in January 2004, then continue as host of the AC countdowns until he retired in 2009. After Kasem retired, the Hot AC &quot;American Top 20&quot; and the Adult Contemporary &quot;American Top 10&quot; were discontinued.

In December 2004, Premiere Networks launched a version of Seacrest&#x27;s &quot;AT40&quot; for the same hot adult contemporary stations that &quot;AT20&quot; had been targeting. Although such a move made &quot;AT20&quot; redundant, Premiere continued to offer Hot AC countdowns hosted by both Kasem (&quot;AT20&quot;) and Seacrest (&quot;AT40&quot;) from December 2004 thru July 2009.

===Television spinoff===
From 1980 to 1992, a video version of the show entitled &quot;America&#x27;s Top 10&quot; was aired in syndication to television stations across the United States. Kasem hosted this version from 1980 to 1989. When Kasem left &quot;American Top 40&quot; in 1988, he remained as host of &quot;America&#x27;s Top 10&quot; until the end of 1989, when he would be replaced by Siedah Garrett and later Tommy Puett. Kasem returned by 1991, and the show ran until 1992.

===Other formats===
Based on the success of &quot;American Top 40&quot;, Kasem and Don Bustany created a spinoff top 40 countdown for Watermark for Country Radio called &quot;American Country Countdown&quot;, patterned after Kasem&#x27;s program. &quot;ACC&quot; premiered in 1973, and was hosted by Don Bowman from its inception until April 1978. Bob Kingsley replaced Bowman and hosted until the end of 2005, after which Kix Brooks of the late country music duo Brooks &amp; Dunn took over. Brooks hosted &quot;ACC&quot; until the end of 2024. Ryan Fox, who also works as morning DJ at KPLX in Dallas, took over hosting duties for Kix Brooks the weekend of January 4, 2025. Kingsley later moved to another program, &quot;Country Top 40&quot; which follows the same format as &quot;AT40&quot; and &quot;ACC&quot;; Kingsley died on Thursday, October 17, 2019. Both &quot;ACC&quot; and &quot;CT40&quot; remain on the air: &quot;ACC&quot; on Westwood One and &quot;CT40&quot;, now hosted by Fitz, syndicated by Hubbard Broadcasting.

After Kasem left ABC, the network launched &quot;American Gold&quot;, a spinoff oldies countdown (featuring far fewer songs, and often focusing on a particular artist) hosted by Dick Bartley. American Gold&#x27;s last show aired at the end of March 2009, replaced with another show hosted by Bartley for United Stations Radio Networks, &quot;Classic Countdown&quot;.

The &quot;American Top 40&quot; format was adapted in an Australian show titled &quot;Take 40 Australia&quot;, similarly counting down the top 40 songs in the country.

== Syndication ==
In the United States, &quot;American Top 40&quot; is available in almost every radio market in the U.S. It had at least one radio station in every state up until December 2022 when New Jersey–based WHCY converted to country music. As of December 2022, New Jersey and Rhode Island are the only two states that don&#x27;t have a local station carrying &quot;American Top 40&quot;. Rhode Island can pick up the show either from Connecticut&#x27;s WKSS or Boston&#x27;s WXKS-FM. North Jersey can still receive the show either from New York&#x27;s WHTZ or the Lehigh Valley&#x27;s WAEB. KKBT in American Samoa is the only radio station in an American territory that airs the show.

In Canada, more than 50 stations air &quot;AT40&quot;, most being owned by IHeartRadio and Golden West Broadcasting. The Move Radio stations air the show as &quot;Move Radio&#x27;s Exclusive AT40&quot; with some songs omitted and replaced with songs by Canadian artists. In 2021, Ontario-based station CKPR-FM added a special Hot AC version of the chart that included contemporary Canadian artists that also airs on CIGO-FM and CHGK-FM. This is done to follow Canadian broadcast regulations. Other Canadian stations like CKIK-FM, and CKSY-FM omit the optional extras.

In addition to the United States and Canada, &quot;American Top 40&quot; is also carried by more than several stations worldwide, including Hi FM in Oman, Amber Sound FM in England, Nile FM in Egypt, and Loud FM in Saudi Arabia.

==Censorship, offensive songs and affiliate standards==

Kasem and Watermark&#x27;s policy regarding putting &quot;American Top 40&quot; together was to always play the forty most popular songs in the United States and never to ban a record from the countdown. However, whenever songs with potentially offensive lyrical content made the top 40, Watermark would send out memos to affiliated stations alerting them of the presence of that song in the countdown and sometimes provide stations with suggestions on how to edit the song out of their &quot;AT40&quot; broadcasts.

When the show became part of Premiere Networks in 1998, a few stations airing &quot;AT40&quot; (especially in most countries around the world) opted to either change versions of each song or skipped some portions of the show for various reasons.

===Offensive content===
The first song to receive this advisory was in April and May 1971, with a spoken word piece, &quot;The Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley&quot;, by Terry Nelson and C-Company. Some better-known songs which received this treatment included &quot;Kodachrome&quot; by Paul Simon, &quot;Roxanne&quot; by The Police, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Love a Bitch&quot; by Rod Stewart, and &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&quot; by Meat Loaf.

Perhaps the most infamous of these songs was Chuck Berry&#x27;s number-one hit &quot;My Ding-a-Ling&quot;, which put some stations in the odd position of having to air &quot;AT40&quot; without playing the number-one song; at least one station, KELI in Tulsa, Oklahoma, censored out the song at its No. 1 position, replacing it with a message from station management, explaining why they chose to censor the program. The censorship of this song continued even into the twenty-first century; some stations, such as WOGL in Philadelphia, replaced this song with an optional extra when it aired a rerun of the November 18, 1972, broadcast (where it ranked at 14) on December 6, 2008.

In 1978, when Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot; (wherein Joel urged pre-marital sex by a teen Catholic girl, Virginia) was on the charts, AT40 had placed warnings in shipments to warn affiliates in highly Catholic populated areas along with a special break in the countdown for stations to substitute another song in its place. The affiliates usually used the suggestion, though some did not and no major complaints were ever heard. (Many of these memos have been reprinted in Pete Battistini&#x27;s book, &quot;American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s&quot;.)

In situations where a charting song contained offensive language and the record company was unable to provide AT40 with a clean edit of the song, the producers would often make an edit themselves. Such was a case with Bob Dylan&#x27;s Top 40 single, &quot;George Jackson&quot;, which peaked at 33 in January 1972 and appeared for two weeks on &quot;AT40&quot;. The offensive lyric in the song was, &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t take shit from no one.&quot; To rectify the problem, &quot;AT40&quot; engineer Bill Hergonson edited the lyric, which was now heard as &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t take &quot;it&quot; from no one.&quot; A similar situation occurred again in July 1975, when The Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Fight the Power&quot; was in the Top 40, but in this case, the substitute version provided by the group&#x27;s label was unsuitable, resorting to the engineer to substitute grunts and extra drum beats over the offending parts of the original record. However, this was not before AT40 erroneously played the uncensored version (with the lyric &quot;...by all this bullshit goin&#x27; down&quot;) the first two weeks on the chart, on the July 12 and 19, 1975 editions.

===Lengthy songs and double-sided hits===
Very rarely was a song on that week&#x27;s chart excluded from that week&#x27;s &quot;AT40&quot;, if so only because of time considerations—on an edition that aired the weekend of December 19, 1970, The Guess Who&#x27;s &quot;Share the Land&quot;, which ranked at No. 30 that week, was omitted from &quot;AT40&quot;, to play both sides of that week&#x27;s No. 1 Double A-side hit, George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; / &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot;. Normally when a Double A-side appeared on the charts, one side was played one week, with the other played the next week, alternating each week as long as it was in the Top 40. Similar omissions occurred in February 1974 when both the Gordon Sinclair and Byron MacGregor versions of &quot;The Americans&quot; simultaneously hit the Top 40; in each case, only one version was played each week alternately.

===Disco and rap===
According to Rob Durkee&#x27;s book &quot;American Top 40: The Countdown of the Century&quot;, Dave Morgan of WDHF (now WCHI-FM) in Chicago ghosted an edition of the program sometime in the summer of 1975. When the station&#x27;s copy of the show did not arrive in time, he used &quot;Billboard&quot;″s list and merely played the records, apparently heavily implying that the show was &quot;American Top 40&quot; without actually identifying it as such. &quot;My program director made me do it!&quot; Morgan said years later. The following year, WDHF would refuse to play &quot;AT40&quot; &quot;Fourth of July&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; special, because No. 1 hits from the pre-rock era were overabundant in the special. But while the special was a stark departure from the contemporary sound of the 1970s, Tom Rounds in his press release reminded stations that it was the United States&#x27; &quot;one and only bicentennial.&quot;

==Special Countdowns==
Occasionally &quot;American Top 40&quot; airs special countdowns in place of the regular &quot;American Top 40&quot; countdown show. These included:

===Annual Countdowns===
The top songs of the year are counted down near the turning of each year, though the format has varied over the years.

*Top 40 (over 1 week): 1971, 1973, 1999, 2010–present*
*Top 50 (over 1 week): 1979, 1994
*Top 80 (over 2 weeks): 1970, 1972
*Top 100 (over 2 weeks): 1974–78, 1980–82, 1992, 1998, 2000–09
*Top 100 (over 1 week): 1983–91, 1993

During the show&#x27;s original run, the 2-week Top 100 programs came with special instructions for editing the show into one 8-hour block. Conversely, the 1-week Top 100 programs came with instructions to split the show into two 4-hour blocks.

In 1971 and 1973, only the top 40 was counted down because of &quot;AT40&quot; Top 40 Christmas Countdowns which aired the week prior. The show did not air Christmas countdowns again until the spinoff shows &quot;American Top 20&quot; and &quot;American Top 10&quot; came into existence, as both of these spinoffs aired a &quot;Top 60 Christmas Songs&quot; special annually the two weeks immediately preceding Christmas.

Since 2010, the show has aired the same Top 40 year-end chart two weeks in a row, with the only differences being the optional AT40 Extras and re-cut announcements mentioning the Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve (which Seacrest also hosts) as a past event instead of an upcoming event. An exception to this was in 2019 when the year-end chart was aired only on the weekend before Christmas, because the decade-end chart would air the following weekend, with the normal chart resuming the first weekend of January.

===Decade-end countdowns===
In 1979, 1999, 2009 and 2019, the show aired special countdowns of the decade&#x27;s biggest hits. In 1979 and 1999, the annual year-end countdown show was cut to one week (4 hours) to accommodate the special countdown, though in 2009, they aired a third special week after their usual two-week Top 100. The decade-end shows counted down the Top 50 of the 1970s, and the Top 40s of the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. There was no decade-end countdown for the 1980s.

==Substitute hosts and guest co-hosts==
Over 50 celebrities—among them radio personalities, game show hosts, and (particularly since Ryan Seacrest took over hosting duties) charting artists—have substituted for these three throughout the show&#x27;s run. Radio announcer Charlie Van Dyke filled in for Kasem a record 31 times in the 1980s.

<text>Expectancy theory (or expectancy theory of motivation) proposes that an individual will behave or act in a certain way because they are motivated to select a specific behavior over others due to what they expect the result of that selected behavior will be. In essence, the motivation of the behavior selection is determined by the desirability of the outcome. However, at the core of the theory is the cognitive process of how an individual processes the different motivational elements. This is done before making the ultimate choice. The outcome is not the sole determining factor in making the decision of how to behave.

Expectancy theory is about the mental processes regarding choice, or choosing. It explains the processes that an individual undergoes to make choices. In the study of organizational behavior, expectancy theory is a motivation theory first proposed by Victor Vroom of the Yale School of Management.

Victor H. Vroom (1964) defines motivation as a process governing choices among alternative forms of voluntary activities, a process controlled by the individual. The individual makes choices based on estimates of how well the expected results of a given behavior are going to match up with or eventually lead to the desired results. Motivation is a product of the individual&#x27;s expectancy that a certain effort will lead to the intended performance, the instrumentality of this performance to achieving a certain result, and the desirability of this result for the individual, known as &quot;valence&quot;.

==Author==
In 1964, Victor H. Vroom developed the expectancy theory through his study of the motivations behind decision-making. This theory is relevant to the study of management.

==Key elements==
The expectancy theory of motivation explains the behavioral process of why individuals choose one behavioral option over the other. This theory explains that individuals can be motivated towards goals if they believe that there is a positive correlation between efforts and performance, the outcome of a favorable performance will result in a desirable reward, a reward from a performance will satisfy an important need, and/or the outcome satisfies their need enough to make the effort worthwhile.

Vroom introduced three variables within the expectancy theory which are valence (V), expectancy (E) and instrumentality (I). The three elements are important behind choosing one element over another because they are clearly defined: effort-performance expectancy (E&gt;P expectancy), performance-outcome expectancy (P&gt;O expectancy).

Expectancy theory has three components:
# Expectancy: effort → performance (E→P)
# Instrumentality: performance → outcome (P→O)
# Valence: V(R) outcome → reward

===Expectancy: effort → performance (E→P)===
Expectancy is the belief that one&#x27;s effort (E) will result in attainment of desired performance (P) goals, usually based on an individual&#x27;s past experience, self-confidence (self efficacy), and the perceived difficulty of the performance standard or goal.

# Self efficacy – the person&#x27;s belief about their ability to successfully perform a particular behavior. The individual will assess whether they have the required skills or knowledge desired to achieve their goals.
# Goal difficulty – when goals are set too high or performance expectations that are made too difficult. This will most likely lead to low expectancy. This occurs when the individual believes that their desired results are unattainable.
# Perceived control – Individuals must believe that they have some degree of control over the expected outcome. When individuals perceive that the outcome is beyond their ability to influence, expectancy, and thus motivation, is low.

===Instrumentality: performance → outcome (P→O)===
Instrumentality is the belief that a person will receive a reward if the performance expectation is met. This reward may present itself in the form of a pay increase, promotion, recognition or sense of accomplishment. Instrumentality is low when the reward is the same for all performances given.

Another way that instrumental outcomes work is commissions. With commissions performance is directly correlated with outcome (how much money is made). If performance is high and many goods are sold, the more money the person will make.

Factors associated with the individual&#x27;s instrumentality for outcomes are trust, control and policies:
* Trusting the people who will decide who gets what outcome, based on the performance,
* Control of how the decision is made, of who gets what outcome, and
* Policies understanding of the correlation between performance and outcomes

===Valence V(R)===
Valence is the value an individual places on the rewards of an outcome, which is based on their needs, goals, values and sources of motivation. Influential factors include one&#x27;s values, needs, goals, preferences and sources that strengthen their motivation for a particular outcome.

Valence is characterized by the extent to which a person values a given outcome or reward. This is not an actual level of satisfaction rather the expected satisfaction of a particular outcome.

The valence refers to the value the individual personally places on the rewards. -1 →0→ +1

-1= avoiding the outcome 0 = indifferent to the outcome +1 = welcomes the outcome

In order for the valence to be positive, the person must prefer attaining the outcome to not attaining it.

 Valence is one behavioral alternative, where the decision is measured on the value of the reward. The model below shows the direction of motivation, when behavior is energized:

Motivational Force (MF) = Expectancy x Instrumentality x Valence

When deciding among behavioral options, individuals select the option with the greatest amount of motivational force (MF).

Expectancy and instrumentality are attitudes (cognitions), whereas valence is rooted in an individual&#x27;s value system.

Examples of valued outcomes in the workplace include, pay increases and bonuses, promotions, time off, new assignments, recognition, etc. If management can effectively determine what their employee values, this will allow the manager to motivate employees in order to get the highest result and effectiveness out of the workplace.

==Current research==
===Management===
Victor Vroom&#x27;s expectancy theory is one such management theory focused on motivation. According to Holdford and Lovelace-Elmore, Vroom asserts, &quot;intensity of work effort depends on the perception that an individual&#x27;s effort will result in a desired outcome&quot;.

In order to enhance the performance-outcome tie, managers should use systems that tie rewards very closely to performance. Managers also need to ensure that the rewards provided are deserved and wanted by the recipients. In order to improve the effort-performance tie, managers should engage in training to improve their capabilities and improve their belief that added effort will in fact lead to better performance.
* Emphasizes self-interest in the alignment of rewards with employee&#x27;s wants.
* Emphasizes the connections among expected behaviors, rewards and organizational goals

Expectancy Theory, though well known in work motivation literature, is not as familiar to scholars or practitioners outside that field.

===Computer users===
Lori Baker-Eveleth and Robert Stone, University of Idaho in 2008 conducted an empirical study on 154 faculty members&#x27; reactions to the use of new software. It was found that ease of system use affects both self-efficacy (self-confidence) and anticipated usefulness. These in turn influenced the decision, or anticipated decision, to use the software.

Self-efficacy and outcome expectancy impact a person&#x27;s affect and behavior separately:
* Self-efficacy is the belief that a person possesses the skills and abilities to successfully accomplish something.
* Outcome expectancy is the belief that when a person accomplishes the task, a desired outcome is attained.

Self-efficacy has a direct impact on outcome expectancy and has a larger effect than outcome expectancy. Employees will accept technology if they believe the technology is a benefit to them. If an employee is mandated to use the technology, the employees will use it but may feel it is not useful. On the other hand, when an employee is not mandated, the employee may be influenced by these other factors (self-confidence and confidence in outcome) that it should be used.

The self-efficacy theory can be applied to predicting and perceiving an employee&#x27;s belief for computer use. This theory associates an individual&#x27;s cognitive state with effective behavioral outcomes.

Other constructs of the self-efficacy theory that impact attitudes and intentions to perform are:
* past experience or mastery with the task;
* vicarious experience performing the task;
* emotional or physiological arousal regarding the task;
* social persuasion to perform the task

===Models of teacher expectancy effects===
Jere Brophy and Thomas Good provided a comprehensive model of how teacher expectations could influence children&#x27;s achievement. Their model posits that teachers&#x27; expectations indirectly affect children&#x27;s achievement: &quot;teacher expectations could also affect student outcomes indirectly by leading to differential teacher treatment of students that would condition student attitudes, expectations, and behavior&quot;. The model includes the following sequence. Teachers form differential expectations for students early in the school year. Based on these expectations, they behave differently toward different students, and as a result of these behaviors the students begin to understand what the teacher expects from them. If students accept the teachers&#x27; expectations and behavior toward them then they will be more likely to act in ways that confirm the teacher&#x27;s initial expectations. This process will ultimately affect student achievement so that teachers&#x27; initial expectancies are confirmed.

In discussing work related to this model, Brophy made several important observations about teacher expectation effects. First and foremost, he argued that most of the beliefs teachers hold about student are accurate, and so their expectations usually reflect students&#x27; actual performance levels. As a result, Brophy contended that self-fulfilling prophecy effects have relatively weak effects on student achievement, changing achievement 5% to 10%, although he did note that such effects usually are negative expectation effects rather than positive effects. Second, he pointed out that various situational and individual difference factors influence the extent to which teacher expectations will act as self-fulfilling prophecies. For instance, Brophy stated that expectancy effects may be larger in the early elementary grades, because teachers have more one-on-one interactions with students then, as they attempt to socialize children into the student role. In the upper elementary grades more whole-class teaching methods are used, which may minimize expectation effects. Some evidence supports this claim; expectancy effects in Rosenthal and Jacobson&#x27;s study were strongest during the earlier grades. Raudenbush&#x27;s meta-analysis of findings from different teacher expectancy studies in which expectancies were induced by giving teachers artificial information about children&#x27;s intelligence showed that expectancy effects were stronger in grades 1 and 2 than in grades 3 through Grade 6, especially when the information was given to teachers during the first few weeks of school. These findings are particularly relevant because they show a form of the expectancy theory: how teachers have certain expectations of students, and how they treat the students differently because of those expectations.

==Criticisms==
Critics of the expectancy model include Graen, Lawler and Porter. Their criticisms of the theory were based upon the expectancy model being too simplistic in nature; these critics started making adjustments to Vroom&#x27;s model.

Edward Lawler claims that the simplicity of expectancy theory is deceptive because it assumes that if an employer makes a reward (such as a financial bonus or promotion) enticing enough, employees will increase their productivity to obtain the reward. However, this only works if the employees believe the reward is beneficial to their immediate needs. For example, a $2 increase in salary may not be desirable to an employee if the increase pushes him into a tax bracket in which he believes his net pay is actually reduced (a belief that is typically fallacious, especially in the United States). Similarly, a promotion that provides higher status but requires longer hours may be a deterrent to an employee who values evening and weekend time with their children.

As an additional example, if a person in the armed forces or security agencies is promoted, there is the possibility that he or she will be transferred to other locations. In such cases, if the new posting is far from their permanent residence where their family resides, they will not be motivated by such promotions and the results will backfire. As such, the reward is valued negatively to the person receiving it.

Lawler&#x27;s new proposal for expectancy theory does not contradict Vroom&#x27;s theory. Lawler argues that since there have been a variety of developments of expectancy theory since its creation in 1964 that the expectancy model needs to be updated. Lawler&#x27;s new model is based on four claims. First, whenever there are a number of outcomes, individuals will usually have a preference among those outcomes. Second, there is a belief on the part of that individual that their action(s) will achieve the outcome they desire. Third, any desired outcome was generated by the individual&#x27;s behavior. Fourth and finally, the actions generated by the individual were generated by the preferred outcome and expectation of the individual.

Instead of simply looking at expectancy and instrumentality, W.F. Maloney and J.M. McFillen found that expectancy theory could explain the motivation of those individuals who were employed by the construction industry. For instance, they used worker expectancy and worker instrumentality. Worker expectancy is when supervisors create an equal match between the worker and their job. Worker instrumentality is when an employee knows that any increase in their performance leads to achieving their goal.

In the chapter entitled &quot;On the Origins of Expectancy Theory&quot; published in &quot;Great Minds in Management&quot; by Ken G. Smith and Michael A. Hitt, Vroom himself agreed with some of these criticisms and stated that he felt that the theory should be expanded to include research conducted since the original publication of his book.

<text>WNCI (97.9 FM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Columbus, Ohio, featuring a top 40 (CHR) format known as &quot;WNCI 97.9&quot;. Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., the station serves the Columbus metropolitan area and is the local affiliate for &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot;. WNCI&#x27;s studios are on West Fifth Avenue on Columbus&#x27; west side, while the transmitter is atop One Nationwide Plaza in the city&#x27;s downtown. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WNCI broadcasts using HD Radio technology and streams online via iHeartRadio.

The station has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 175,000 watts, while the current maximum for Ohio radio stations is 50,000 watts. It is grandfathered at this power from before the date when the FCC set limits for FM stations. There are only six FM stations in the United States that operate with more power.

== History ==
The station signed on the air as WRFD-FM in July 1961. It had a classical music format, sharing studios with co-owned WRFD, east of Powell, Ohio. In early 1967, management changed the call sign to WNCI-FM to match its corporate ownership, Nationwide Communications, Inc. The call letter switch also marked a change in programming from primarily classical music.

In mid 1968, WNCI began programming &quot;The Young Sound&quot; format, supplied by CBS Radio, mostly vocal-oriented easy listening. In 1972, WNCI moved to the sixth floor of the new Scot&#x27;s Inn, later the Carousel Inn, at 4900 Sinclair Road. Since that time, the studios of WNCI have been relocated to various places in the Columbus area, including the Nationwide Building, The Continent, &quot;Broadcast Lake&quot; (a former quarry overlooked by several Clear Channel radio studios and the television studios of WSYX), and the current location at 2323 West Fifth Avenue.

WNCI began its Top 40 programming in 1970, although the station also broadcast an evening &quot;progressive rock&quot; album-based program beginning in the fall of 1969. From 1979 to 1982, the station attempted a full service, adult contemporary music format to compete with WTVN, adding a five-person news staff. Its slogan at the time was &quot;The Best Is At The Center,&quot; playing on its location on the FM dial. The full-service format was abandoned in 1982 and the station returned to playing Top 40 hits.

In June 1993, WNCI again morphed into a Hot AC-leaning station to compete with adult contemporary rival WSNY. This lasted for nearly a year before WNCI reverted to a CHR/Pop formatted-direction.

In 1997, Jacor Communications acquired the assets of Nationwide Communications, including WNCI, for $620 million. WNCI was once the flagship station for the 17-station Nationwide Communications, a division of the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (where its call letters derive). Jacor was acquired in 1998 by Clear Channel Communications, which today is iHeartMedia, Inc.

WNCI tends to be a mainstream, conservative contemporary hit station, at times leaning towards Adult Top 40.

WNCI formerly syndicated their “Dave &amp; Jimmy” morning show to nearby stations through United Stations Radio Networks. As of October 2, 2023, the hosts decided to end syndication of the show, rendering the morning show exclusive to WNCI, although the show is streamed nationally on the iHeartRadio app.

<text>Syed Mohammad Ali Chowdhury Bogra (19 October 1909 – 23 January 1963) was a Pakistani Bengali politician, statesman, and a diplomat who served as third prime minister of Pakistan from 1953 to 1955. He was appointed in this capacity in 1953 until he stepped down in 1955 in favour of Finance Minister Muhammad Ali.

After his education at the Presidency College at the University of Calcutta, he started his political career on Muslim League&#x27;s platform and joined the Bengal&#x27;s provincial cabinet of then-Prime Minister H. S. Suhrawardy in the 1940s. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, he joined the foreign ministry as a diplomat and briefly tenured as Pakistan&#x27;s ambassador to Burma (1948), High Commissioner to Canada (1949–1952), twice as ambassador to the United States, and as ambassador to Japan (1959–1962).

After he was recalled in 1953 from his services to Pakistan from the United States, he replaced Sir Khwaja Nazimuddin as Prime Minister in an appointment approved by then-Governor-General Sir Malik Ghulam. His foreign policy strongly pursued the strengthening of bilateral relations between Pakistan and the United States, while downplaying relations with the Soviet Union. He also pushed for a stronger military to achieve peace with India and took personal initiatives to prioritize relations with China. At home front, he successfully proposed the popular political formula that laid the foundation of the constitution in 1956 which made Pakistan a federal parliamentary republic. Despite his popular initiatives, he lost his support to then-acting governor-general Iskandar Ali Mirza who re-appointed him as Pakistani Ambassador to the United States which he served until 1959.

In 1962, he joined President Muhammad Ayub Khan&#x27;s administration as the Foreign Minister of Pakistan until his death in 1963.

==Biography==

===Family background and education===

Mohammad Ali was born in Backerganj (now Barisal), East Bengal, British India, on 19 October 1909. He was born into an elite and wealthy aristocrat family who were known as the Nawabs of Dhanbari, traditionally very close to the British monarchy. The prefix, &quot;Sahibzada&quot; (lit. Prince) is added before his name to represent the Bengali royalty which is customary to give to individuals in India.

His father, Nawabzada Altaf Ali Chowdhury, educated at the St Xavier&#x27;s College in Calcutta, was a prominent figure in Dacca and was also a local politician who served as the Vice-President of the Muslim League&#x27;s East Bengal faction. His father, Altaf Ali Chowdhury, was fond of Derby horse race, dog show, and physical sports. His grandfather, Nawab Ali Chowdhury, was also a politician who served as the first Bengali Muslim to be appointed as minister, and played a pioneering role in founding the Dhaka University along with Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah Bahadur of Dhaka.

Mohammad Ali Bogra grew up in Bogra, having studied first at the local Hastings House and then educated at the local &quot;madrassa&quot; in Calcutta. After his matriculation, Bogra went to attend the Presidency College of the Calcutta University where he secured his graduation with a BA degree in political science in 1930.

He was married twice: his first wife was Begum Hamida Mohammad Ali, with whom he had two sons. He later married Aliya Saddy in 1955. His second marriage led to widespread protests against polygamy by women organizations in the country.

==Politics (1930–1947)==

Before his entrance in the politics, the Bogra family were influential Nawabs active in Bengali politics and Muslim League as a party worker in 1930. He contested in the general elections on a Muslim League&#x27;s platform held in 1937 from Bogra constituency and sat in the Opposition in the Bengal Legislative Assembly. His uncle, Hasan Ali Chowdhury, also won the election who ran against the Muslim League&#x27;e platform. His father, Altaf Ali Chowdhury also successfully defended his constituency and was a member of the ruling Krishak Praja Party.

In 1938, he was elected as chairman of Bogra District which he served until 1942. He served in the opposition until 1943 when the Muslim League had gained political support and he was made parliamentary secretary to then-Chief Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin. In 1946, he was asked by Husyn Suhrawardy to join his cabinet and subsequently held ministerial portfolio of health, finance, and local government. As health minister, he founded the Dhaka Medical College and the Calcutta Lake Medical College.

Bogra supported the Muslim League&#x27;s call for creation of Pakistan through the partition of British India and successfully defended his constituency in the general elections held in 1945. In 1947, he joined the first Constituent Assembly. While in Dacca in 1948, he received Governor-General Muhammad Ali Jinnah and reportedly dissented on the issue of populist language movement being excluded as an official state language of Pakistan. He strongly advised Chief Minister Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin to restrain Jinnah from announcing the measure, but was rebuked.

==Diplomatic Career (1947–1952)==

===Ambassadorship to Burma, High Commissionership to Canada, and Ambassadorship to the United States===

In 1948, Bogra was asked by Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan to be appointed him as the Pakistan ambassador to the Kingdom of Egypt to head the Pakistani diplomatic mission in Cairo, which Bogra declined. Instead, he chose the diplomatic assignment in neighboring Burma and presented his credentials in Rangoon in 1948. Soon after becoming Pakistan Ambassador to Burma, his political philosophy reflected a conservative mindset and took an anti-communist stance when he supported the Burma&#x27;s military operations against the communists. In 1948, he showed concerns of communist expansion in Pakistan when he reportedly told Pakistani journalists that: &quot;even [sic] if the Burmese Government succeed in suppressing the communists, it is possible they may shift the centre of communist efforts to Pakistan.&quot;

In 1949, he left Burma when he was appointed as High Commissioner of Pakistan to Canada which he headed the diplomatic mission until 1952. In 1952, he was made Ambassador to the United States.

Watching the campaign for the 1952 United States presidency, Bogra conjectured, according to Husain Haqqani, that Pakistan could obtain economic and military aid from the United States by casting itself as a front line state in the battle to contain Soviet communism. He vigorously lobbied anticommunists in Washington, D.C. to that end. In Pakistan&#x27;s political circle, he was seen as extremely having pro-American views and had fondness of the country, the United States. He also helped negotiated the United States&#x27; officer assistance advisory to be dispatch to Pakistan, in an agreement he signed with the United States government in 1952.

In the Foreign Service society of Pakistan, Bogra gained a reputation of &quot;a man who was known for his &quot; He served as Pakistan&#x27;s ambassador until 1953 but he had become disconcern of the real situation in Pakistan when the leftwing influence began to grow and the public support for the Soviet Union was visible. Pakistani historians held him widely responsibly as one of the principle personalities putting Pakistan in the alliance of the United States against the Soviet Union.

==Prime Minister of Pakistan (1953–1955)==

===Talent ministry and foreign policy===

The issue of language movement in East in 1952, the rise of the Socialist Party in Pakistan as well as the violent riots in Lahore against the minority &quot;Ahmadiyya&quot; in 1953 were the defining factors that led to the dismissal of Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin by then-Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad on 17 April 1953.

Bogra was recalled to Karachi (then-Federal capital) from Washington DC for further consultation but Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad moved to appointed him as a new Prime Minister and the President of the Muslim League (ML), which the party had accepted. Under pressure and reluctant, he accepted the new appointment from the Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad but he was more of a diplomat than politician who was unknown to the general public. Initially, he kept the federal ministries of foreign affairs and defence until appointing a new cabinet. Upon taking over the government, Bogra dismissed the elected government of Fazlul Huq on 30 May 1954 for &quot;treasonable activities&quot;. He had appointed then-defence secretary Iskander Mirza as the governor, but this appointment only lasted a couple of months.

Prime Minister Bogra appointed a new cabinet which was known as &quot;Ministry of Talents&quot; which included General Ayub Khan, the Army Commander in Chief, as the Defence Minister and Major-General (retired) Iskander Ali Mirza as Interior Minister.

Days later, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower ordered the shipment of thousands of tons of wheat to Pakistan. Bogra was eager to strengthen military ties with the United States, however, the Americans moved cautiously to not damage their strong relations with India. His tenure saw him signing multiple treaties with the United States and brought the two countries closer.

His foreign policy was noted for strong &quot;anti-Soviet agitation&quot; which he viewed the Russians as &quot;imperialist&quot; but did not label the same for China despite both being ideologically closed. In 1955, Prime Minister Bogra led Pakistan to attend the Bandung Conference in Indonesia in 1955, which saw the first high-level contact between China and Pakistan.

Bogra addressed the Kashmir conflict with India. In 1953, he met with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on the sidelines of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London. Mohammad Ali Bogra well received Prime Minister Nehru when he paid an official visit to Karachi, and Prime Minister Bogra reciprocated the visit in New Delhi soon after. Prime Minister Bogra enjoyed warm and closer relations with Prime Minister Nehru, as both eventually agreed on the &quot;plebiscite&quot; in Indian held Kashmir (IoK), but this was not achieved due to Prime Minister Bogra losing support from the leftwing sphere of the country.

In his approach towards India, Prime Minister Bogra pushed for a stronger military to achieve peace in the subcontinent, and argued: &quot;[w]hen there is more equality of military strength, then I am sure that there will be a greater chance of settlement&quot;.

===Bogra Formula===

The Bogra Formula was a political compromise presented and proposed by Prime Minister Bogra on 7 October 1953 before the Constituent Assembly. Upon taking the control of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Secretariat, Bogra announced that drafting of the codified Constitution was his primary target, and within six months, he announced a proposal that leads to the drafting of the constitution writ.

The framework proposed the establishment of more effective bicameral parliament that would be composed of National Assembly and the Senate with equal representation from then-five provinces: Punjab, Khyber–Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Sindh, and Bengal. A total of 300 seats were to be reserved for the National Assembly on the basis of proportionate representation and 50 for the Senate that would be equal representation for all the five provinces of the country.

Under this framework, the larger number of constituencies were given to Bengal which had 165 reserved seats in contrast to Punjab which had 75, Khyber–Pakhtunkhwa, which had 24, Sindh which had 19, and Balochistan which had 17 reserved seats. Tribal areas, Karachi metropolitan area, Bahawalpur, Khairpur, Baluchistan States Union, were combined as 24 reserved seats.

In this framework, Bengal had given more seats due to its social homogeneity in the National Assembly than the combined reserved seats for the four provinces and the federal capital which, all were socially heterogeneous and ethically diverse. But combined the reserved seats in the four provinces were in balance with Bengal in the bicameral parliament. Both the houses were given equal power, and in case of a conflict between the two houses, the issue was to be presented before a joint session.

The Bogra framework also addresses the check and balance to avoid the permanent domination by any five provinces where a provision was made that if the president was elected from the four provinces then the prime minister was to be elected from East Bengal, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. The president was to be elected for a term of 5 years from the indirect elections by the Electoral College formed by both houses: National Assembly and the Senate.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan was to be given more power and institutional judicial independence that would permanently replace the Islamic clergy to decide if a law was in accordance with the basic teachings of the Koran or not.

The Bogra formulae was highly popular and widely welcomed by the people as opposed to the Basic Principles Committee led by Prime Minister Nazimuddin as it was seen as great enthusiasm amongst the masses as they considered it as a plan that could bridge the gulf between the two wings of Pakistan and would act as a source of unity for the country.

The compromise did not settled to its ground when Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad, threatened by curbing of his powers, dissolved the Constituent Assembly in 1954 with the support of Pakistan military and civil bureaucracy.

===One Unit===

Following the failure of reaching concession on Bogra Formula, he began working towards the controversial One Unit program that integrated the Four Provinces into a single nation-state and began advocating for such idea when he quoted:

===Dismissal and ambassadorship to the United States (1955–1959)===

On 4 August 1955, the Cabinet accepted Governor-General Sir Malik Ghulam Muhammad&#x27;s request for a leave of absence due to ill health. They chose Interior Minister Iskander Mirza to replace him, and he was sworn in as acting governor-general on 7 August.

Soon after the appointment, Mirza began having confrontations with Prime Minister Bogra on regional disparity though both were Bengali and were from Bengal, and forced Bogra to resign, ending Bogra&#x27;s administration. Mirza also dismissed Malik Ghulam Muhammad and sent a letter of notification to the United Kingdom to remind him of the political developments.

Mirza appointed Bogra as Pakistani Ambassador to the United States when he recalled Amjad Ali who was appointed as finance minister.

==Ayub administration==

===Foreign minister (1962–63)===

In 1959, he left the ambassadorial assignment after the then-Chief Martial Law Administrator Ayub Khan took control of the government from President Iskander Mirza in 1958. Ayub appointed Bogra foreign minister.

Soon after his appointment, he visited China where he continued talks with the Chinese leadership that eventually led to a settlement with China regarding the China–Pakistan border. As foreign minister, he guided a pro-Western policy but made efforts to improve relations with the Soviet Union after witnessing the Western and American support India during the Chinese-Indian War in 1962. After visiting Soviet Union with President Ayub, Bogra quoted: There was no such thing as friends forever or enemies forever– only national interests count.

During this time, his health became a serious issue and illness caused him to miss out the meeting over Kashmir but his deputy Zulfikar Ali Bhutto attended in the United States on 26 December 1962. In 1963, Bogra died while staying in Dacca and was buried in Bogra Nawab Palace in East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.

== Personal life ==

Ali was married twice; his first wife was Begum Hamida Mohammed Ali, and his second wife was a Lebanese lady, Aliya Begum. This marriage was controversial because it constituted polygamy, which was uncommon among the elites of Pakistan.

==Death==

Bogra died on 23 January 1963 in Dacca. Politician Ajmal Ali Choudhury offered condolences and felt &quot;deep sorrow&quot; for the sudden death.

<text>The Taurus Mountains (Turkish: &quot;Toros Dağları&quot; or &quot;Toroslar,&quot; Greek&quot;:&quot; Ταύρος) are a mountain complex in southern Turkey, separating the Mediterranean coastal region from the central Anatolian Plateau. The system extends along a curve from Lake Eğirdir in the west to the upper reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in the east. It is a part of the Alpide belt in Eurasia.

== Etymology ==
The mountain range under the current name was mentioned in &quot;The Histories&quot; by Polybius as Ταῦρος (&quot;Taûros&quot;). Heinrich Kiepert writes in &quot;Lehrbuch der alten Geographie&quot; that the name was borrowed into Ancient Greek from the Semitic (Old Aramaic) root (&quot;ṭūrā&quot;), meaning &quot;mountain&quot;.

==Geography==
The Taurus Mountains are divided into three chains from west to east as follows;
* Western Taurus (Batı Toroslar)
*Central Taurus (Orta Toroslar)
*Southeastern Taurus (Güneydoğu Toroslar)

===Western Taurus===

The Western Taurus Mountains form an arc around the Gulf of Antalya. It includes the Akdağlar, Bey Mountains, Katrancık Mountain, Kuyucak Mountains, and Geyik Mountains. The East Taşeli Plateau and Goksu River divide it from the Central Taurus Mountains. It has many peaks rising above . Mt. Kizlarsivrisi, , in the Bey Mountains is the highest peak in the Western Taurus.

===Central Taurus===
The Central Taurus Mountains are roughly defined to include northern Mersin Province and northwestern Adana Province. The highest point in the Central Taurus is Mt. Demirkazık (3,756m). The Cilician Gates or Gülek Pass has been the principal pass through the Eastern Taurus since ancient times, connecting the coastal plain of Cilicia with Central Anatolia. The Tarsus-Ankara Highway (E90, O-21) passes through it. Mountain ranges in the Central Taurus include:
*Akçalı Mountains, western
*Bolkar Mountains, central, highest peak Mt. Medetsiz 
*Aladaglar mountain range, central, highest peak Mt. Kızılkaya 
*Tahtalı Mountains or Anti-Taurus Mountains
*Munzur Mountains, eastern, highest peak Mt. Akbaba 
**Mercan mountain range, within the Munzur
===Southeastern Taurus===
The Southeastern Taurus Mountains form the northern boundary of the Southeastern Anatolia Region and North Mesopotamia. They include the Nurhak Mountains, Malatya Mountains, Maden Mountains, Genç Mountains, and Bitlis Mountains. They are in the watershed of the Euphrates River and Tigris River.
==Geology==
The Taurus Mountains were formed by the collision of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates. The predominant underlying rock is limestone. In the Aladaglar and Bolkar mountains, limestone has eroded to form karstic landscapes of waterfalls, underground rivers, and some of the largest caves of Asia. The Manavgat River originates on the southern slopes of the Beydaglari range.

==Climate==
The mountains have a Mediterranean climate, with dry summers and rainy winters. Temperatures vary with elevation, with warm winters on the lower coastal slopes and cold winters in the high mountains and in the interior.

==Flora and fauna==

At lower elevations, the predominant vegetation forest and woodland of evergreen oaks and Turkish pine (&quot;Pinus brutia&quot;), and areas of maquis shrubland. Above 1200 meters elevation are montane forests of black pine (&quot;Pinus nigra&quot;), Lebanon cedar (&quot;Cedrus libani&quot;), Taurus fir (&quot;Abies cilicica&quot;), and juniper (&quot;Juniperus&quot; spp.). The high peaks are home to alpine meadows.

==History==
===Pre-history and early Roman period===
The bull was commonly the symbol and depiction of ancient Near Eastern storm gods, hence Taurus the bull, and hence the name of the mountains. The mountains are a place of many ancient storm-god temples. Torrential thunderstorms in these mountains were deemed by the ancient Syrians to be the work of the storm-god Adad to make the Tigris and Euphrates rivers rise and flood and thereby fertilise their land. The Hurrians, probably originators of the various storm-gods of the ancient Near East, were a people whom modern scholars place in the Taurus Mountains at their probable earliest origins.

A Bronze Age archaeological site, where early evidence of tin mining was found, is at Kestel. The pass known in antiquity as the Cilician Gates crosses the range north of Tarsus.

The Amanus range in southern Turkey is where the Taurus Mountains are pushed up as three tectonic plates come together. The Amanus is a natural frontier: west is Cilicia, east is Syria. There are several passes, like the Amanian Gate (Bahçe Pass), which are of great strategical importance. In 333 BC at the Battle of Issus, Alexander the Great defeated Darius III in the foothills along the coast between these two passes. In the Second Temple period, Jewish authors seeking to establish with greater precision the geographical definition of the Promised Land, began to construe Mount Hor as a reference to the Amanus range of the Taurus Mountains, which marked the northern limit of the Syrian plain.

=== Late Roman period to present ===
During World War I, the German and Turkish railway system through the Taurus Mountains proved to be a major strategic objective of the Allies. This region was specifically mentioned as a strategically controlled objective slated for surrender to the Allies in the Armistice, which ended hostilities against the Ottoman Empire.

==Attractions==
In addition to hiking and mountain climbing, there are two ski resorts on the mountain range, one at Davras about from the two nearest towns of Egirdir and Isparta, the second is Saklıkent from the city of Antalya.

The Varda Viaduct, situated on the railway lines Konya-Adana at Hacıkırı village in Adana Province, is a railway bridge constructed in the 1910s by Germans.

<text>The Parti indépendantiste (; ) was a provincial party which advocated Quebec sovereignty in Québec, Canada in the second half of the 1980s.

==Denis Monière==

Founded by in 1985, the party was established to promote the separation of Québec from Canada. It attracted a number of purs et durs supporters of the Parti Québécois (PQ), who believed the party was not taking a strong enough position in promoting the cause of Québec independence.

Monière had previously been interim leader of the Parti nationaliste du Québec, a federal political party, following the resignation of the party’s founder. Monière was defeated in the 1984 Canadian election that brought Brian Mulroney to power.

Under Monière&#x27;s leadership, the &quot;Parti indépendantiste&quot;&#x27;s influence failed to gain momentum. The party received less than one percent of the vote in the 1985 election.

==Gilles Rhéaume==

Gilles Rhéaume became party leader in 1987. During his tenure, the party became radicalized and divided over strategy. Jacques Parizeau succeeded Pierre-Marc Johnson as leader of the PQ on March 18, 1988, and took a stronger stance on sovereignty. Many Parti indépendantiste supporters returned to the PQ fold.

Rhéaume resigned on January 8, 1990, and the Parti indépendantiste lost its registration on June 15 of the same year.

<doc id="596742" wikidata="Q1335286" url="?curid=596742" title="John Gerrard Keulemans">
<text>Johannes Gerardus Keulemans (8 June 1842 – 29 March 1912) was a Dutch bird illustrator. For most of his life he lived and worked in England, illustrating many of the best-known ornithology books of the nineteenth century.

== Biography ==
Keulemans was born in Rotterdam. As a young man he collected animal specimens for museums such as the Natural History Museum in Leiden, whose director, Hermann Schlegel, encouraged Keulemans and sent him on the 1864 expedition to West Africa. In 1869, he was persuaded by Richard Bowdler Sharpe to illustrate his &quot; Monograph of the Alcedinidae, or Family of Kingfishers&quot; (1868-1871) and to move to England, where he lived for the rest of his life. He was married twice, and had eight children by his first wife and seven children by his second wife. Only nine of his children reached adulthood. He also wrote topics on spirituality, and claimed he had a premonition at the moment of death of one of his sons. He died in Ilford, Essex (now part of Greater London) and is buried in Buckingham Road cemetery, Ilford, in an unmarked grave.

== Work ==
Keulemans regularly provided illustrations for &quot;The Ibis&quot; and &quot;The Proceedings of the Zoological Society&quot;. He illustrated many important bird books, including Buller&#x27;s &quot;A History of the Birds of New Zealand&quot; (1873, 1888), William Vincent Legge&#x27;s &quot;History of the Birds of Ceylon&quot; (1880), Daniel Giraud Elliot&#x27;s &quot;Monograph of the Bucerotidae&quot; (hornbills) (1887–1892), Henry Seebohm&#x27;s &quot;Monograph of the Turdidae (thrushes)&quot; (1902), Osbert Salvin&#x27;s &quot;Biologia Centrali-Americana&quot; (1879–1904), Edgar Leopold Layard&#x27;s &quot;Birds of South Africa&quot; (1887) and Henry Eeles Dresser&#x27;s &quot;History of the Birds of Europe&quot; (1871–1896), and a single illustration in &quot;The Journal of the Linnean Society&quot;.

One of his last great achievements was his contribution of over one hundred plates for Frederick Du Cane Godman&#x27;s &quot;Monograph of the Petrels&quot; (1907–1910). He also spent some time collecting birds in Cape Verde and West Africa.
Keulemans is credited with describing the Cape Verde swamp-warbler, &quot;Calamodyta (Acrocephalus) brevipennis&quot;. This is a drab bird about 14–16 cm., light brown above and on its flanks, and buff below. He did not publish an illustration of it, but his plate for &quot;Acrocephalus brunnescens&quot; in George Henderson&#x27;s &quot;Lahore to Yarkand&quot; (pl. XVI) is similar.
His notes and findings on the island of Principe, along with those of his colleague Dr. H. Dohrn, would eventually become the basis for a later description of a rare ibis, &quot;Lampribis rothschildi&quot; Bannerman.

The only significant biography of Keulemans is by Jan Coldewey and Tony Keulemans, &quot;Feathers to Brush&quot;, a book that includes a bibliography of the artist&#x27;s publications, a genealogical tree and appendices detailing his spiritualism, with a sample of his financial correspondence. Also of note is a contemporary obituary of Keulemans in the journal &quot;British Birds&quot; (1912). Tony Keulemans later wrote &quot;Beyond the grave&quot;, which tells the story of a remarkable discovery of a painting John Gerrard had made of his own gravestone. And finally, Tony Keulemans wrote an errata list to &quot;Feathers to Brush&quot;, which includes additional literature references and new genealogical findings.

Keulemans&#x27;s work is characterised by its consistency, showing little change over the course of his career, and focused to an extraordinary degree on the rendering of fine detail. These generalisations have also proven to be the basis for unjustified criticism of his work, since the nature of scientific illustration places a premium on consistency. Aside from this, a number of critics have rightly placed Keulemans above his contemporaries; his ability to create accurate and vivid representations of birds gave him prominence in his field.
Keulemans was prodigious in his output - he was commissioned to paint pictures of birds extensively throughout his career, and his prints were published continuously from 1867 to 1911. Keulemans&#x27; first prints appeared in two books by Francois Pollen, &quot;Contributions a l&#x27;histoire naturelle des Lemuriens&quot; (1867) and &quot;Een blik in Madagascar&quot; (1867). Some appeared after his death until 1915 (Mathews, &quot;Birds of Australia&quot;); he had rendered the images on stone well before publication of these works. A calculation of his total output gives about 4,000-5,000 published illustrations. The vast majority of these were vignettes published within octavo-size books and publications, and a great number of his works also appeared in quarto (Dresser/&quot;Europe&quot;) and in folio (Seebohm/&quot;Turdidae&quot; and DuCane Godman/&quot;Petrels&quot;). While the subject of his illustrations was almost entirely avian, he was also commissioned to create portraits of mammals, insects, and shells.

Most of the illustrations by Keulemans were produced through traditional lithography, allowing for a finished product that depicts a vivid, lifelike figure through depth and tone. Printing was carried out by the two firms of Mintern and Hanhart, and early in his career, some were printed by P. M. W. Trap. Often, the published lithographs were not coloured, and perhaps some (&quot;Journal of the Linnean Society&quot;, 1878) were not intended to be coloured. The technique of lithography made it necessary for the print to be coloured by hand. This was done by semi-skilled artisans working in an assembly line in a manner similar to stencilling. While Keulemans&#x27; talents as a draughtsman were hardly disputed by his contemporaries, often the finished, coloured plates were the subject of criticism (Sharpe/&quot;Alcedinidae&quot;). If the depicted colours did not match those of the birds, the value of the finished product was diminished.

Keulemans painted remarkable pictures of extinct birds, including Walter Rothschild&#x27;s &quot;Avifauna of Laysan, Extinct Birds&quot; (1907). Examples in the American Museum of Natural History in New York include the Choiseul crested pigeon, Kangaroo Island emu, huia, Lyall&#x27;s wren, Hawaii oo, Hawaii mamo, Oahu oo, Guadalupe petrel, and the laughing owl.

=== &quot;Onze vogels in huis en tuin&quot; (Our birds in home and garden) ===
The only work that was not only illustrated but also written by Keulemans, was &quot;Onze vogels in huis en tuin&quot; (Our birds in home and garden). It was a three volume work in Dutch that appeared between 1869 and 1876. 
* 1869: &quot;Onze vogels in huis en tuin&quot; vol. 1. 242 text pages; 70 images; 3 pages contents.
* 1873: &quot;Onze vogels in huis en tuin&quot; vol. 2. 232 text pages; 70 images; 3 pages contents.
* 1876: &quot;Onze vogels in huis en tuin&quot; vol. 3. 194 text pages; 60 images; 3 pages contents.

In this work Keulemans does write about a number of native birds, but he also describes (and paints) a number of cagebirds and aviary birds.

Keulemans is famous for his illustrations, but in this book he shows that he is a very able observer of birds in the field as well. The chapter on the common cuckoo &quot;Cuculus canorus&quot; in vol. 2, for instance, has 13 pages of text, with a number of field observations by Keulemans. In vol. 2 he describes the grey parrot (grijze roodstaartpapegaai) &quot;Psittacus erithacus&quot; in vol. 2, giving an extensive account of field observations done on the island of Príncipe in de Gulf of Guinea. Keulemans stayed there around 1865 during a year. Many other chapters of &quot;Onze vogels in huis en tuin&quot; also show that Keulemans was a careful observer of the species he painted and described.

== Interest in spiritualism ==
According to the authors of Keulemans&#x27; biography &quot;Feathers to Brush&quot;, the artist&#x27;s interest in spiritualism began with a premonition of his son Isidore&#x27;s death. In an article in the Bristol Mercury and Daily Post of 3 March 1883, Keulemans tells how he and his family were living in Paris in December 1880 when there was an outbreak of smallpox. The parents sent three of their children to London to live with their grandparents; one of the children was his favourite son Isidore, aged four. In the morning of 24 January 1881, Keulemans woke up and heard Isidore&#x27;s voice and saw his face. The apparition returned the next day, which made Keulemans very uneasy. A few days later he received a letter from London to tell him Isidore was ill, when in fact he had died exactly on the day of the first appearance of Isidore in John Gerrard&#x27;s dream.

Subsequently, Keulemans experienced further incidents increasing his belief in the supernatural, in particular which he claimed could be awakened via the painting of a bird&#x27;s eye. Keulemans began an association with the Society for Psychical Research; later he became disenchanted with the prevalence of fraud in spiritualist society, and used his scientific training to expose the trickery he saw performed by mediums.

Keulemans claimed to have visited nearly 400 séances and gave some examples of the alleged trickery in support of his criticisms. He seems not to have been opposed to Spiritualism in its philosophical or metaphysical bases, but against its pretensions as a science based on demonstrable fact.

<text>The Union populaire was a federal political party in Canada that nominated candidates in the 1979 and 1980 federal elections. The party also nominated one candidate in the 4 May 1981 by-election in the riding of Levis, Quebec.

The aim of the party was to promote the cause of independence for the Province of Quebec in federal elections.

The party gained little support, and was not supported by the Parti Québécois, the pro-independence party that formed the government of the province at the time. That party had a long-standing policy of not participating in federal politics.

The &quot;Union populaire&quot; was succeeded by the Parti nationaliste du Québec in the 1984 federal election, and subsequently by the Bloc Québécois.

Only one candidate, Andre Cote from Beauce, ran for both the UP and the Bloc; he was defeated in the 2008 election.

<doc id="596745" wikidata="Q898401" url="?curid=596745" title="Lipophilicity">
<text>Lipophilicity (from Greek λίπος &quot;fat&quot; and φίλος &quot;friendly&quot;) is the ability of a chemical compound to dissolve in fats, oils, lipids, and non-polar solvents such as hexane or toluene. Such compounds are called lipophilic (translated as &quot;fat-loving&quot; or &quot;fat-liking&quot;). Such non-polar solvents are themselves lipophilic, and the adage &quot;like dissolves like&quot; generally holds true. Thus lipophilic substances tend to dissolve in other lipophilic substances, whereas hydrophilic (&quot;water-loving&quot;) substances tend to dissolve in water and other hydrophilic substances.

Lipophilicity, hydrophobicity, and non-polarity may describe the same tendency towards participation in the London dispersion force, as the terms are often used interchangeably. However, the terms &quot;lipophilic&quot; and &quot;hydrophobic&quot; are not synonymous, as can be seen with silicones and fluorocarbons, which are hydrophobic but not lipophilic.
==Surfactants==
Hydrocarbon-based surfactants are compounds that are amphiphilic (or amphipathic), having a hydrophilic, water interactive &quot;end&quot;, referred to as their &quot;head group&quot;, and a lipophilic &quot;end&quot;, usually a long chain hydrocarbon fragment, referred to as their &quot;tail&quot;. They congregate at low energy surfaces, including the air-water interface (lowering surface tension) and the surfaces of the water-immiscible droplets found in oil/water emulsions (lowering interfacial tension). At these surfaces they naturally orient themselves with their head groups in water and their tails either sticking up and largely out of water (as at the air-water interface) or dissolved in the water-immiscible phase that the water is in contact with (e.g. as the emulsified oil droplet). In both these configurations the head groups strongly interact with water while the tails avoid all contact with water. Surfactant molecules also aggregate in water as micelles with their head groups sticking out and their tails bunched together. Micelles draw oily substances into their hydrophobic cores, explaining the basic action of soaps and detergents used for personal cleanliness and for laundering clothes. Micelles are also biologically important for the transport of fatty substances in the small intestine surface in the first step that leads to the absorption of the components of fats (largely fatty acids and 2-monoglycerides).

Cell membranes are bilayer structures principally formed from phospholipids, molecules which have a highly water interactive, ionic phosphate head groups attached to two long alkyl tails.

By contrast, fluorosurfactants are not amphiphilic or detergents because fluorocarbons are not lipophilic.

Oxybenzone, a common cosmetic ingredient often used in sunscreens, penetrates the skin particularly well because it is not very lipophilic. Anywhere from 0.4% to 8.7% of oxybenzone can be absorbed after one topical sunscreen application, as measured in urine excretions.

<doc id="596748" wikidata="Q2708628" url="?curid=596748" title="Kenneth Koch">
<text>Kenneth Koch ( ; February 27, 1925 – July 6, 2002) was an American poet, playwright, and professor, active from the 1950s until his death at age 77. He was a prominent poet of the New York School of poetry. This was a loose group of poets including Frank O&#x27;Hara and John Ashbery that eschewed contemporary introspective poetry in favor of an exuberant, cosmopolitan style that drew major inspiration from travel, painting, and music.

==Life==

Koch (pronounced &quot;coke&quot;) was born Jay Kenneth Koch in Cincinnati, Ohio. He began writing poetry at an early age, discovering the work of Shelley and Keats in his teenage years. At the age of 18, he served in WWII as a U.S. Army infantryman in the Philippines.

After his service, he attended Harvard University, where he met future New York School poet John Ashbery. After graduating from Harvard in 1948 and moving to New York City, Koch studied for and received his Ph.D. from Columbia University.

In 1951, he met his first wife, Janice Elwood, at UC Berkeley; they married in 1954 and lived in France and Italy for over a year. Their daughter, Katherine, was born in Rome in 1955 (In 1982, Katherine married poet Mark Statman, one of Koch&#x27;s former students). In 1959, he joined the faculty in the Department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia and he taught classes at Columbia for over forty years.

His first wife died in 1981; Koch married his second wife, Karen Culler, in 1994. He was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1996. Koch died from a year-long battle with leukemia in 2002.

==Career==
While a student at Harvard, Koch won the prestigious Glascock Prize in 1948. In 1962, Koch was writer in residence at the New York City Writer&#x27;s Conference at Wagner College.

The 1960s saw his first published books of poetry, but his poetry did not garner wider popular acclaim until the 1970s with his book &quot;The Art of Love: Poems&quot; (1975). He continued writing poetry and releasing books of poetry up until his death. Koch won the Bollingen Prize for &quot;One Train&quot; (1994) and &quot;On The Great Atlantic Rainway: Selected Poems 1950-1988&quot; (1994), followed closely by the Phi Beta Kappa Poetry Award winner &quot;New Addresses&quot; (2000).

In 1970, Koch released a pioneering book in poetry education, &quot;Wishes, Lies and Dreams: Teaching Children To Write Poetry&quot;. Over the next 30 years, he followed this book with other books and anthologies on poetry education tailored to teaching poetry appreciation and composition to children, adults, and the elderly.

Koch wrote hundreds of avant-garde plays over the course of his 50-year career, highlighted by drama collections like &quot;1000 Avant-Garde Plays&quot; (1988), which only contains 116 plays, many of them only one scene or a few minutes in length. His prose work is highlighted by &quot;The Red Robins&quot; (1975), a sprawling novel about a group of fighter pilots flying for personal freedom under the leadership of Santa Claus. He also published a book of short stories, &quot;Hotel Lambosa&quot; (1988), loosely based on and inspired by his world travels. He also produced at least one libretto, and several of his poems have been set to music by composers.

Koch taught poetry at Columbia University, where his classes were popular. His wild humor and intense teaching style, often punctuated by unusual physicality (standing on a table to shout lines by Walt Whitman) and outbursts of vocal performance often drawn from Italian opera, drew non-English majors and alumni. Some of the spirit of these lectures is contained in his final book on poetry education, &quot;Making Your Own Days&quot; (1998). His students included poets Ron Padgett, David Shapiro, Frank Lima, Alan Feldman, David Lehman, Jordan Davis, Jessy Randall, David Baratier, Loren Goodman, Carson Cistulli, and filmmaker Jim Jarmusch.

His poems were translated into German by the poet Nicolas Born in 1973 for the renowned &quot;red-frame-series&quot; of the Rowohlt Verlag.

Koch had a brush with the anarchist affinity group Up Against the Wall Motherfucker in early January 1968. During a poetry reading at St. Mark&#x27;s Church, a member of the group walked in and pointed a handgun at the podium, shouting &quot;Koch!&quot; before firing one blank round. The poet regained his composure and said to the &quot;shooter,&quot; &quot;Grow up.&quot;

==Poetry==

Koch asked in his poem &quot;Fresh Air&quot; (1956) why poets were writing about dull subjects with dull forms. Modern poetry was solemn, boring, and uneventful. Koch described poems &quot;Written by the men with their eyes on the myth/ And the missus and the midterms...&quot; He attacked the idea that poetry should be in any way stale.

Koch wrote of how:

 The Waste Land gave the time&#x27;s most accurate data,
 It seemed, and Eliot was the Great Dictator
 Of literature. One hardly dared to wink
 Or fool around in any way in poems,
 And critics poured out awful jereboams
 To irony, ambiguity, and tension –
 And other things I do not wish to mention.
 (Excerpt from ‘&#x27;Seasons on Earth&#x27;,’ 1987)

Though not against T. S. Eliot, Koch opposed the idea that in order to write poetry one had to be depressed or think that the world is a terrible place. His ideas were developed with close friends Frank O&#x27;Hara and John Ashbery, along with painters Jane Freilicher and Larry Rivers, among others. He once remarked that &quot;Maybe you can almost characterize the poetry of the New York School as having as one of its main subjects the fullness and richness of life and the richness of possibility and excitement and happiness.&quot; In his poem &quot;The Art of Poetry&quot; (1975) Koch offered guidelines to writing good poetry. Among his 10 suggestions are &quot;1) Is it astonishing?&quot; and &quot;10) Would I be happy to go to Heaven with this pinned on to my angelic jacket as an entrance show? Oh would I?&quot;

Koch once remarked that &quot;Children have a natural talent for writing poetry and anyone who teaches them should know that.&quot; In his poems:

#He mixed word usage with various levels of imagery;
#He set two contrasting tones next to each other, simplicity and silliness at the same time;
#He spoke to everything, animate and inanimate objects;
#He used parody of other poets to express his own views, both serious and comic.

Koch was labeled by some as just a comedic poet. He acknowledged this in an interview and offered his comments:

He gives a picture of this in &quot;To Kidding Around,&quot; where the joys of being a joker are proclaimed:

 To be rid of troubles
 Of one person by turning into
 Someone else, moving and jolting
 As if nothing mattered but today
 In fact nothing
 But this precise moment...
 (Excerpt from To Kidding Around, 2000)

==Theater==

Koch collaborated with the composer Ned Rorem on an opera, &quot;Bertha&quot;, which received its premier in 1973. His short play, &quot;George Washington Crossing the Delaware&quot;, was produced in 1962. Numerous others of his plays have been produced.

<doc id="596760" wikidata="Q7060549" url="?curid=596760" title="Norton, County Durham">
<text>Norton, also known as Norton-on-Tees, is a market town in the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees, in County Durham, England. The suburbs of Roseworth and Ragworth are notable areas of the town. Billingham Beck is to the east of the town, the beck flows to the south-east. The town also contains the areas of Wolviston and Wynyard which are to the north of the town and are wards of the town. The town had a population of 20,829 in the 2011 Census.

The area&#x27;s centre dates back to at least the Anglo-Saxon period. It was the centre of an ancient parish that once included the chapelry of Stockton, which became a separate parish in 1713.

==History==
In 1982, the chance discovery of human bones by school children playing on a rope swing near the Mill Lane area of the town, led to the unearthing of an Anglo-Saxon pagan cemetery. Excavations in 1984 revealed 120 burials (117 inhumations and 3 cremations) in graves that contained assorted personal items such as spears, belt buckles and brooches. The remains and objects collected suggest the site was dated to around AD 540–610.

To the south end of High Street, the Victoria Jubilee Memorial Cross stands where the market place was once situated. The red sandstone Anglian style cross commemorates Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1897. Further along, and on the opposite side of the High Street are the Fox almshouses, also founded in 1897 at the bequest of local brewer John Henry Fox.

Norton was an ancient parish, which also included the chapelry of Stockton, which became a separate parish in 1713. Most of the parish of Norton, including the main built-up area, was absorbed into the municipal borough and parish of Stockton in 1913. A residual civil parish of Norton, covering just the more rural western part of the old parish, continued to exist until 1 April 1968 when it was abolished and absorbed into the County Borough of Teesside along with Stockton and other areas. In 1961 the parish had a population of 416. It is now in the unparished area of Stockton-on-Tees.

==Geography==

At the north end of Norton centre there is a large village green with a duckpond, surrounded by mostly Georgian houses and cottages. The ancient parish church of St. Mary the Virgin stands on the west side of the village Green.

Norton&#x27;s wide and tree-lined High Street has a number of shops, hairdressers, boutiques, cafés, a library, photographic studio and a traditional fish &amp; chips shop, as well as a mixture of 18th century and 19th century townhouses, cottages and modern apartments. Away from the village lie the housing estates of Albany, Glebe, Crooksbarn and Norton Grange (originally Blue Hall).

== Demographics ==
==St Mary&#x27;s Church==
St Mary the Virgin, the ancient parish church that stands on the village green, is the only cruciform Anglo-Saxon church in northern England. Its crossing tower with eight triangular head windows has a battlemented top of later date, and there is a 14th-century effigy of a knight in chainmail. Residing under the church floor there is claimed to be an escape tunnel used by the Saxons and priests when in danger, though it is more probably a drainage culvert. The tunnel leads under the church floor and Norton Green, eventually surfacing in the Albany housing estate. The church floor was recently renovated and Saxon remains and artefacts were discovered in the tunnel entrance. St Mary&#x27;s was until the Reformation a Catholic church – which is true of all English churches pre-dating the Reformation.

The grave of John Walker, the inventor of friction matches, is located in the churchyard.

Norton&#x27;s Catholic population now worship at St Joseph&#x27;s in Darlington Lane. The church opened in 1933 and is part of the St Hilda Partnership within the Hexham and Newcastle Diocese.

==Red House School==
Located in the town is Red House School, an independent school established in 1929. Adjacent to St. Mary&#x27;s Church is Red House Nursery &amp; Infant School, which combines state of the art modern buildings with classrooms in the former Old Vicarage. On the opposite side of the village green resides Red House Preparatory and Main School. In May 2012, the school announced its intention to relocate to nearby Wynyard Park stating that it had outgrown its existing site in Norton. This, however, did not occur as the school decided to improve the existing site.

==Sport==
The Norton (Teesside) Sports Complex is situated on Station Road and dates back to 1847 when it was the home of Norton Cricket Club. At the club&#x27;s Centenary Dinner in 1947, the members decided to buy the ground (and a further twelve acres surrounding it) with a view to developing it into one of the finest sports complexes in the north of England. During the past few decades further land was acquired and now as well as being home to Norton Cricket Club (which play in the NYSD cricket premier league).

The complex is also home to the Billingham Synthonia Football Club and is now again home to Norton &amp; Stockton Ancients Football Club, reinstated in 2019 having folded 3 years previously in 2016.

==Notable events==
6 August 1856, John Warner and Sons cast the first bell for Big Ben, but it cracked beyond repair while being tested at Westminster. Another bell was later recast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London.

14 July 1977, Queen Elizabeth II passed through Norton by car, in front of spectators during her Silver Jubilee royal visit to the region.

11 November 2006, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Den&quot; businessman Duncan Bannatyne (who owned a house on the High Street at the time, later moving to nearby Wynyard) was married at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Norton. Celebrities at the ceremony included Anna Ryder Richardson, Cherie Lunghi, Gary McCausland, Dragons&#x27; Den presenter Evan Davis and fellow Dragons Theo Paphitis, Richard Farleigh, Simon Woodroffe and Deborah Meaden

<doc id="596794" wikidata="Q128884" url="?curid=596794" title="Cilician Gates">
<text>The Cilician Gates or Gülek Pass is a pass through the Taurus Mountains connecting the low plains of Cilicia to the Anatolian Plateau, by way of the narrow gorge of the Gökoluk River. Its highest elevation is about 1000m.

The Cilician Gates have been a major commercial and military artery for millennia. In the early 20th century, a narrow-gauge railway was built through them, and today, the Tarsus-Ankara Highway (E90, O-21) passes through them.

The southern end of the Cilician gates is about 44 km north of Tarsus and the northern end leads to Cappadocia.

==History==
Yumuktepe (modern Mersin), which guards the Adana side of the gateway, with 23 layers of occupation, is at 4,500 BCE, one of the oldest fortified settlements in the world. The ancient pathway was a track for mule caravans, not wheeled vehicles. The Hittites, Greeks, Alexander the Great, the Romans, Byzantines, Sasanians, Mongols, and the Crusaders of the First Crusade have all traveled this route during their campaigns. The Bible testifies that Saint Paul of Tarsus and Silas went this way as they went through Syria and Cilicia. The Book of Galatians speaks of the cities of Derbe, Lystra, and Iconium - cities visited by Paul on his first journey (Acts 14; Gal. 1:2), with the purpose of strengthening their churches, at the beginning of the second preaching journey (Acts 15:40-41).

The distance from the Anatolian plateau to the Cilician plain is about . In ancient times, this was a journey of nearly five days. Saint Paul spoke, according to the Bible, about being in &quot;dangers from rivers&quot; and &quot;dangers from robbers&quot; (2 Cor. 11:26). This may explain why one of the world&#x27;s oldest fortresses was built at the southeastern end of the Cilician Gates around 4500 BCE. The Army of the Ten Thousand, Alexander the Great before the Battle of Issus, Paul of Tarsus on his way to the Galatians, and part of the army of the First Crusade all passed through the Cilician Gates. The Crusaders allied themselves with the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.

Above the Gates to the southwest is Gülek Kalesi (Armenian: Kuklak; Arab: Kawlāk), a large fortification of considerable antiquity that retains evidence of Byzantine and Arab periods of occupation, but is primarily an Armenian construction of the 12th and 13th centuries. Its circuit walls and towers at the south and west cover a distance of over 450 meters. Below the Cilician Gates is the medieval Armenian fortress of Anahşa with its large horseshoe-shaped towers and three entrances. Also in the vicinity of the Gates is a fort built in the 1830s by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt during his Syrian campaign against the Ottomans.

When German engineers were working on the Baghdad Railway between Istanbul and Baghdad, they were unable to follow the steep-pitched, narrow, and tightly winding ancient track through the Gates. The series of viaducts and tunnels they built are among the marvels of railroad engineering; this route actually follows an ancient secondary road southeast from Pozantı, below Anahşa Dağı with its medieval Armenian fortress. The railroad was opened in 1918; the narrow-gauge working line moved Ottoman troops and war material to the Mesopotamian front in the closing months of World War I.

<doc id="596795" wikidata="Q910691" url="?curid=596795" title="Rigid designator">
<text>In modal logic and the philosophy of language, a term is said to be a rigid designator or absolute substantial term when it designates (picks out, denotes, refers to) the same thing in &quot;all possible worlds&quot; in which that thing exists. A designator is &quot;persistently rigid&quot; if it also designates nothing in all other possible worlds. A designator is &quot;obstinately rigid&quot; if it designates the same thing in every possible world, period, whether or not that thing exists in that world. Rigid designators are contrasted with &quot;connotative terms&quot;, &quot;non-rigid&quot; or &quot;flaccid designators&quot;, which may designate different things in different possible worlds.

==History==
The Scholastic philosophers in the Middle Ages developed a theory of properties of terms in which different classifications of concepts feature prominently.

Concepts, and the terms that signify them, can be divided into absolute or connotative, according to the mode in which they signify. If they signify something absolutely, that is, after the manner of substance, they are absolute, for example rock, lion, man, whiteness, wisdom, tallness. If they signify something connotatively, that is, with reference to a subject of inherence, i.e., after the manner of accidents, they are connotative, for example, white, wise, tall.

Both connotative and absolute concepts can be used to signify accidents, but since connotative concepts signify with a reference to a subject of inherence, they can refer to object with different definitions and properties (i.e. with different &quot;essences&quot;). For example, large, as a connotative concept, can signify objects with many distinct essences: a man, a lion, a triangle can be large.

On the other hand, absolute concepts signify objects that have the same definitions and properties. For example, the concept of gold, as an absolute concept, can signify only objects with the same definitions and properties (i.e. with the same &quot;essence&quot;).

==Proper names and definite descriptions==
The notion of absolute concepts was then revived by Saul Kripke, with the name “rigid designation”, in the lectures that became &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;, in the course of his argument against descriptivist theories of reference, building on the work of Ruth Barcan Marcus. At the time of Kripke&#x27;s lectures, the dominant theory of reference in analytic philosophy (associated with the theories of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell) was that the meaning of sentences involving proper names could be given by substituting a contextually appropriate description for the name. Russell, for example, famously held that someone who had never met Otto von Bismarck might know of him as &quot;the first Chancellor of the German Empire&quot;, and if so, his statement that (say) &quot;Bismarck was a ruthless politician&quot; should be understood to mean &quot;The first Chancellor of the German Empire was a ruthless politician&quot; (which could in turn be analysed into a series of more basic statements according to the method Russell introduced in his theory of definite descriptions). Kripke argued—against both the Russellian analysis and several attempted refinements of it—that such descriptions could not possibly &quot;mean the same thing&quot; as the name &quot;Bismarck,&quot; on the grounds that proper names such as &quot;Bismarck&quot; always designate &quot;rigidly&quot;, whereas descriptions such as &quot;the first Chancellor of the German Empire&quot; do not. Thus, for example, it &quot;might have been the case&quot; that Bismarck died in infancy. If so, he would not have ever satisfied the description &quot;the first Chancellor of the German Empire,&quot; and (indeed) someone else probably would have. It does not follow that the first Chancellor of the German Empire may not have been the first Chancellor of the German Empire—that is (at least according to its surface-structure) a contradiction. Kripke argues that the way that proper names &quot;work&quot; is that when we make statements about what might or might not have been true of Bismarck, we are talking about what might or might not have been true of &quot;that particular person&quot; in various situations, whereas when we make statements about what might or might not have been true of, say, &quot;the first Chancellor of the German Empire&quot; we &quot;could&quot; be talking about what might or might not have been true of &quot;whoever&quot; would have happened to fill that office in those situations.

The &quot;could&quot; here is important to note: rigid designation is a property of the &quot;way terms are used&quot;, not a property of &quot;the terms themselves&quot;, and some philosophers, following Keith Donnellan, have argued that a phrase such as &quot;the first Chancellor of the German Empire&quot; &quot;could&quot; be used rigidly, in sentences such as &quot;the first Chancellor of the German Empire could have decided never to go into politics.&quot; Kripke himself doubted that there was any need to recognize rigid uses of definite descriptions, and argued that Russell&#x27;s notion of scope offered all that was needed to account for such sentences. But in either case, Kripke argued, nothing important in his account depends on the question. Whether definite descriptions can be used rigidly or not, they can at least &quot;sometimes&quot; be used non-rigidly, but a proper name &quot;can only be used rigidly&quot;; the asymmetry, Kripke argues, demonstrates that no definite description could &quot;give the meaning&quot; of a proper name—although it might be used to explain &quot;who&quot; a name refers to (that is, to &quot;fix the referent&quot; of the name).

==Essentialism==
In &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;, Kripke argues that proper names and certain natural kind terms—including biological taxa and types of natural substances (most famously, &quot;water&quot; and &quot;H2O&quot;) designate rigidly. He argues for a form of scientific essentialism not unlike Aristotelian essentialism. Essential properties are common to an object in all possible worlds, and so they pick out the same objects in all possible worlds - they rigidly designate.

==Causal-historical theory of reference==

Proper names rigidly designate for reasons that differ from natural kinds terms. The reason &#x27;Johnny Depp&#x27; refers to one particular person in all possible worlds is because some person initially gave the name to him by saying something like &quot;Let&#x27;s call our baby &#x27;Johnny Depp&#x27;&quot;. This is called the initial baptism. This usage of &#x27;Johnny Depp&#x27; for referring to some particular baby got passed on from person-to-person in a giant causal and historical chain of events. That is why everybody calls Johnny Depp &#x27;Johnny Depp&#x27;. Johnny&#x27;s mother passed it onto her friends who passed it onto their friends who passed it onto their friends, and so on.

==Necessary identities==

One puzzling consequence of Kripke semantics is that identities involving rigid designators are necessary. If water is H2O, then water is &quot;necessarily&quot; H2O. Since the terms &#x27;water&#x27; and &#x27;H2O&#x27; pick out the same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which &#x27;water&#x27; picks out something different from &#x27;H2O&#x27;. Therefore, water is necessarily H2O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, but that does not affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed is that water is necessarily H2O, but &quot;conditionally&quot;, &quot;if&quot; water is H2O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it is true), then water is necessarily H2O.

<text>The German Peace Society ( (DFG)) was founded in 1892 in Berlin. In 1900 it moved its headquarters to Stuttgart. It still exists and is known as the &quot;Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft - Vereinigte KriegsdienstgegnerInnen&quot; (DFG-VK; German Peace Society - United War Resisters). It&#x27;s an organisation consisting of political pacifists and war resisters. About four to six times a year, the DFG-VK is publishing its magazine Zivilcourage.

The DFG-VK is participating in a variety of pacifist and antimilitarist alliances on a national as well as international level and is the biggest member organisation of War Resisters’ International.

==History==

On 21 December 1892, the German Peace Society was founded, claiming to be the first organisation of pacifists that represents the whole German empire. Responsible for the procedure were Alfred Hermann Fried and Bertha von Suttner, one of the most known German women of that time.

The German Peace Society was a key part of the German peace movement and played a prominent role since the mid-1890s. This was the result of growing international tensions and the rearmament of many nations that wanted to show their strength in the international race of imperialism. The German Peace Society protested against imperialism, militarism, the discrimination of minorities and the chauvinist upbringing of young people. In 1899, the German Peace Society moved their headquarters to Stuttgart. In the beginning of the 20th century, one of the most important members to this day was Ludwig Quidde, who was regularly leading the German delegation to the International Peace Congress and kept maintaining contact to other peace organisations worldwide.

In 1902, the German Peace Society counted 6.000 members in 60 local groups. Until May 1914, the number of members grew to 10.000 in almost 100 local groups. Although many of the leading members were part of the upper class, the actual base of members was deriving from a lower middle class background like small business owners, intellectuals as well as doctors, lawyers and pharmacists. However, public servants, workers or farmers were almost non-existent in the German Peace Society. In May 1914, the first women’s initiative inside the Society was established.

After the beginning of the First World War, members started to go into exile or were hiding from publicity to avoid oppression of any kind due to a general disaffirmation towards a pacifist agitation.

With the end of the First World War, the German Peace Society gained popularity amongst social democrats. However, due to the existing Stab-in-the-back myth, pacifists were also under attack and made responsible for the German loss of the war. Despite this circumstance, the number of members rose to about 30.000 by 1927. The high number in members also caused conflicts within the Society and its future path. This concerns mainly the direction of a traditional upper class pacifism (which also partly supports defensive wars) and a newly rising, more radical pacifism carried out by works and members of the lower classes which in the end, enforced their radical ideas and ended with the withdrawal of eleven board members and the new elected head Paul von Schoenaich.

In 1933, after the takeover by the NSDAP, the German Peace Society was cracked down. Leading members were either fleeing into exile, were imprisoned or killed.

After the Second World War, the German Peace Society was re-founded in 1946. Until 1948, it regained over 10.000 members.

During the Cold War, the Society had several setbacks to suffer. This included the loss of many members, the still forbidden status in the Soviet occupied territory in Germany and the rumours of being infiltrated by communists. Still, the Society played an important role on topics like the rearmament of Germany and the German &quot;Easter Protests”. In the 1950s, the main topics of the German Peace Society were peaceful co-existence, the disarmament of East and West and the practice of war objectors which was also part of a big campaign in 1972.

After the successful unification with the former &quot;International of War Resisters&quot; (IdK; Internationale der Kriegsdienstgegner) to form the DFG/Idk (West-Berlin excluded) in 1968 and the fusion with the organisation &quot;United War Resisters&quot; (VK; Verband der Kriegsdienstverweigerer ) five years later, the organisation was now working under the name &quot;Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft - Vereinigte KriegsdienstgegnerInnen&quot; (DFG-VK; German Peace Society - United War Resisters).

==Campaigns==

The German Peace Society is a member of several international initiatives and alliances such as War Resisters&#x27; International, International Peace Bureau, European Bureau for Conscientious Objection, and the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.

After the end of compulsory military service, the Society focused on the protest against advertisement for military service, especially in front of universities, schools, job markets or their yearly upcoming Tag der Bundeswehr (day of Bundeswehr). The Society advocates against a reactivation of the military service and the protection of minors that are recruited by the Bundeswehr.

In 2011, the Society founded a campaign against the delivery of weapons to states that fail to meet certain standards of human rights and international law. One of the main representatives of this campaign is Jürgen Grässlin who is also part of the board of the German Peace Society.

===Bertha-von-Suttner-Foundation===

Named after the founder of the German Peace Society, the Bertha-von-Suttner-Foundation supports scientific events and research programs as well as scientific publications and media that is supporting the idea of international cooperation, communication and peace. Head of the foundation is David Scheuing, who is also editorial journalist of the magazine &quot;Wissenschaft &amp; Frieden&quot;.

===Carl-von-Ossietzky-Fonds===

The Carl-von-Ossietzky-Fonds is a fund to support activists that came into conflict with the law through peace and anti-war activities. It helps to cover possible costs of a conviction and corresponding fees. It is named after the former secretary of the German Peace Society Carl von Ossietzky.

<text>Peter Clay Carroll (born September 15, 1951) is an American professional football coach who is the head coach for the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). He previously served as head coach for the NCAA&#x27;s USC Trojans (2001–2009) and the NFL&#x27;s New York Jets (1994), New England Patriots (1997–1999), and Seattle Seahawks (2010–2023). Carroll is the third head coach to win both a college football national championship and a Super Bowl along with Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer.

Beginning his coaching career on the NFL level, Carroll saw minimal success as head coach of the Jets and Patriots in the 1990s. Shifting to college football with USC, he revitalized the struggling program into a top-ranked contender, winning seven consecutive conference championships and an AP national championship. He also won a BCS national championship at the 2005 Orange Bowl, although the title was later vacated.

Carroll&#x27;s collegiate success prompted an NFL return in 2010 when he was hired as the head coach of the Seahawks. In 14 seasons under Carroll, the Seahawks qualified for the playoffs 10 times, clinched their division five times, made two consecutive Super Bowl appearances, and won the franchise&#x27;s first championship in Super Bowl XLVIII. The team&#x27;s Legion of Boom defense also led the league in scoring defense for four consecutive seasons during his tenure. Following the 2023 season, Carroll stepped down as head coach to take an advisory position with the Seahawks and left in 2025 to become head coach of the Raiders.

==Early life==
Carroll was born on September 15, 1951, in San Francisco, California, the son of Rita (&quot;née&quot; Ban) and James Edward &quot;Jim&quot; Carroll. Two of his paternal great-grandparents were Irish immigrants, and his Croatian maternal grandparents emigrated from around the region of Šibenik. He was raised in Greenbrae, California, and attended Greenbrae School. Carroll attended Redwood High School in Larkspur, California.

He was a multi-sport star in football (playing quarterback, wide receiver, and defensive back), basketball, and baseball, earning the school&#x27;s Athlete of the Year honors as a senior in 1969. He was inducted into the charter class of the Redwood High School Athletic Hall of Fame in April 2009.

After high school, Carroll attended junior college at the nearby College of Marin, where he played football for two years, intercepting 12 passes, before transferring to the University of the Pacific, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. At Pacific, Carroll played free safety for two years for the Tigers, earning All-Pacific Coast Athletic Association honors both years (1971–72) and earning his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in 1973. Following his senior season, Carroll was selected as Pacific&#x27;s recipient of the Charles Erb Jr. Award for Most Inspirational Player, the Tully Knoles Award for Ironman, and the Sid Robinson Award for the team&#x27;s Most Loyal Player.

Combined between Marin and UOP, Carroll finished his college career with 22 interceptions while also returning punts. After graduation, Carroll tried out for the Honolulu Hawaiians of the World Football League at their training camp in Riverside but did not make the team due to shoulder problems combined with his small size.
==Coaching career==
===Collegiate assistant (1973–1983)===
Carroll&#x27;s energetic and positive personality made a good impression on his head coach, Chester Caddas. When Caddas found out Carroll was interested in coaching, he offered him a job as a graduate assistant on his staff at Pacific. Carroll agreed and enrolled as a graduate student, earning a secondary teaching credential and Master&#x27;s degree in physical education in 1976, while serving as a graduate assistant for three years and working with the wide receivers and secondary defenders. The assistants at Pacific during this time included a number of other future successful coaches, including Greg Robinson, Jim Colletto, Walt Harris, Ted Leland, and Bob Cope. Carroll was inducted into the Pacific Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995.

After graduating from Pacific, Carroll&#x27;s colleague Bob Cope was hired by the University of Arkansas and he convinced Lou Holtz, then the head coach of the Razorbacks, to also hire Carroll. Carroll spent the 1977 season as a graduate assistant working with the secondary under Cope. During his season with Arkansas, he met his future offensive line coach Pat Ruel, also a graduate assistant, as well as the future head coach of the Razorbacks Houston Nutt, who was a backup quarterback. Arkansas&#x27; Defensive Coordinator at the time, Monte Kiffin, would be a mentor to Carroll. The Razorbacks won the 1978 Orange Bowl that season.

The following season, Carroll moved to Iowa State University, where he was again an assistant working on the secondary under Earle Bruce. When Bruce moved on to Ohio State University, he again hired Carroll to coach the secondary. The Ohio State squad made it to the 1980 Rose Bowl where they lost to USC.

When Monte Kiffin was named head coach of North Carolina State University in 1980, he brought Carroll in as his defensive coordinator and secondary coach. In 1983, Bob Cope became head coach of Pacific and brought Carroll on as assistant head coach and offensive coordinator.

===National Football League (1984–1999)===
Carroll left Pacific after a year and entered the NFL in 1984 as the defensive backs coach of the Buffalo Bills. The next year, he moved on to work with the Minnesota Vikings, where he held the same position from 1985-1989. In 1989, he was a candidate for the head coaching position at Stanford University; the position went to Dennis Green. His success with the Vikings led to his hiring by the New York Jets, where he served as defensive coordinator under Bruce Coslet from 1990-1993. Carroll and Coslet had known each other for many years by that time, as Carroll&#x27;s older brother was Coslet&#x27;s college roommate. When there was an opening for the Vikings&#x27; head coach position in 1992, he was a serious candidate but lost the position, again to Green.

In 1994, Carroll was elevated to head coach of the Jets. Known for his energy and youthful enthusiasm, Carroll painted a basketball court in the parking lot of the team&#x27;s practice facility where he and his assistant coaches regularly played three-on-three games during their spare time. The Jets got off to a 6–5 start under Carroll, but in Week 12, he was the victim of Dan Marino&#x27;s &quot;clock play&quot;—a fake spike that became a Miami Dolphins game-winning touchdown. The Jets lost all of their remaining games to finish 6–10. He was fired after one season.

Carroll was hired for the next season by the San Francisco 49ers, where he served as defensive coordinator for the following two seasons (1995–96). His return to success as the defensive coordinator led to his hiring as the head coach of the New England Patriots in 1997, replacing coach Bill Parcells, who had resigned after disputes with the team&#x27;s ownership. His 1997 Patriots team won the AFC East division title, but his subsequent two teams did not fare as well—losing in the wild card playoff round in 1998, and missing the playoffs after a late-season slide in 1999—and he was fired after the 1999 season. Patriots owner Robert Kraft said firing Carroll was one of the toughest decisions he has had to make since buying the team, stating, &quot;A lot of things were going on that made it difficult for him to stay, some of which were out of his control. And it began with following a legend.&quot; His combined NFL record as a head coach was 33–31, and he was later considered a much better fit for college football than the NFL after his success at USC.

Even though several NFL teams approached him with defensive coordinator positions, Carroll instead spent the 2000 season as a consultant for pro and college teams, doing charitable work for the NFL, and writing a column about pro football for CNNSI.com.

===USC Trojans (2000–2009)===

====Hiring====

Carroll was named the Trojans&#x27; head coach on December 15, 2000, signing a five-year contract after USC had gone through a tumultuous 18-day search to replace fired coach Paul Hackett. He was not the Trojans&#x27; first choice, and was considered a long shot as the USC Athletic Department under Director Mike Garrett initially planned to hire a high-profile coach with recent college experience. Meanwhile, Carroll, who had not coached in over a year and not coached in the college ranks since 1983, drew unfavorable comparisons to the outgoing Hackett.

USC first pursued then-Oregon State coach Dennis Erickson, who instead signed a contract extension with the Beavers; then Oregon coach Mike Bellotti, who similarly signed an extension. The search then moved to the San Diego Chargers coach Mike Riley, who had been an assistant coach at USC before later becoming the head coach of Oregon State. Stuck in contractual obligations to the Chargers (who were still in the midst of an NFL season) and hesitant about moving his family, Riley was unable to give a firm answer, opening an opportunity for Carroll, the school&#x27;s fourth choice.

Carroll actively pursued the position, as his daughter, Jaime, was then a player on the school&#x27;s successful volleyball team. After the first three primary candidates turned down the position, USC hired Carroll. Under Garrett, USC had tried to recruit Carroll to be their head coach in 1997, while he was coaching the Patriots, but Carroll was unable to take the position. The second time the opening came up, Daryl Gross, then senior associate athletic director for USC, recommended Carroll to Garrett based on his experience as a former scout for the New York Jets while Carroll coached there. Garrett cited Carroll&#x27;s intelligence, energy and reputation as a defensive specialist as reasons for his hire.

The choice of Carroll for USC&#x27;s head coaching position was openly criticized by the media and many USC fans, primarily because of USC&#x27;s stagnation under the outgoing Hackett and Carroll&#x27;s record as a head coach in the NFL and being nearly two decades removed from the college level. Garrett took particular criticism for the hire, with the press tying his future with Carroll&#x27;s after he had to fire two head coaches in four years for USC&#x27;s premiere athletic coaching position. Former NFL players (including USC alumni) such as Ronnie Lott, Gary Plummer, Tim McDonald and Willie McGinest offered their support for Carroll, who they noted had a player-friendly, easygoing style that might suit the college game and particularly recruiting. The USC Athletic Department received 2,500 e-mails, faxes and phone calls from alumni—mostly critical—and a number of donors asking for Carroll&#x27;s removal before they would donate again.

Within a year of his hiring, many prominent critics reversed course. In 2008, ESPN.com named Carroll&#x27;s hiring number 1 in a list of the Pac-10&#x27;s top ten moments of the BCS era.

====Tenure====
The criticism of Carroll became louder when Carroll&#x27;s first USC team opened the 2001 season going 2–5, with some sportswriters writing off the once-dominant Trojans, who were the only Pac-10 football team to never finish in the national top 10 during the previous decade, as a dying program. However, after the slow start, Carroll&#x27;s teams proceeded to go 67–7 over the next 74 games, winning two national championships and playing for another.

Carroll was considered one of the most effective recruiters in college football, having brought in multiple top-ranked recruiting classes; he was also known for getting commitments from nationally prominent players early in high school. His son, Brennan Carroll, was USC&#x27;s recruiting coordinator as well as the tight ends coach during the elder Carroll&#x27;s tenure as head coach. He had consistently been on the forefront of recruiting due to his ability to connect with potential players on their level, including becoming the first college coach with a Facebook page, as well as an early adopter of Twitter.

Carroll&#x27;s team won a then-school record 34 straight games from 2003 to 2005, a streak that started after a triple-overtime loss to California and ended with the national championship game against the Texas Longhorns in the 2006 Rose Bowl. Fourteen of those games were later vacated for breaking NCAA rules. During his tenure, USC broke its average home attendance record four times in a row (they play at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum); the USC home attendance average in 2001, his first season, was 57,744; by 2006, it was over 91,000. During this period, USC had a 35-game winning streak at the Coliseum, spanning 6 years (2001–2007). The streak began on October 13, 2001, with a 48–17 win over the Arizona State Sun Devils and the final victory was a 47–14 win over the Washington State Cougars on September 22, 2007. The streak ended on October 6, 2007, with a 24–23 loss to the Stanford Cardinal who was a 41-point underdog. Prior to this the last loss was on September 29, 2001, (during Carroll&#x27;s first year) to Stanford Cardinal 21–16. The success of USC football under Carroll led to a sharp rise in overall athletic department revenue, growing from $38.6 million in Carroll&#x27;s first season at USC to more than $76 million in 2007–08.

Controversy arose when USC was excluded from the National Championship Game for the 2003 season, even though ranked #1 in both the Associated Press (AP) Poll and the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll. Years later, (2008) he was asked if winning the Rose Bowl was ever not enough. &quot;No. You&#x27;ve got to understand that our mindset is to focus only on what we can control. We can only control getting to the Rose Bowl. Winning our conference and going to the Rose Bowl is what our goal is every year. Our goal isn&#x27;t about national championships, because we don&#x27;t have control of that – that&#x27;s in somebody else&#x27;s hands. We found that out years ago [2003], when we were No. 1 but then we were No. 3. We already knew that but that just proved it. If we win our games and we&#x27;re out there and they want us to go somewhere else, then we&#x27;ll go. We love the Rose Bowl.&quot;

Carroll was repeatedly approached regarding vacant head coach positions in the NFL beginning in 2002. Carroll hesitated to return to the NFL after his previous experiences, and said that his return would likely rest on control over personnel matters at a level unprecedented in the league. He had insisted over the years that he was happy at USC and that money was not an issue; he also was said to enjoy the Southern California lifestyle. When asked if he would retire at USC, Carroll responded:

When originally hired, Carroll signed a five-year contract worth approximately $1 million annually. He received a significant raise after the 2002 season and earned close to $3 million in the 2004 season, which ended with USC winning the BCS title in January 2005. He agreed to a contract extension in December 2005. His total compensation, including pay and benefits, for the 2007 fiscal year was $4,415,714.

On January 11, 2010, it was reported that Carroll would be leaving USC to coach the Seattle Seahawks. Carroll had told his players the previous evening that he would be resigning his position with the Trojans to become the new head coach of the Seattle Seahawks. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Carroll came to agreement with the Seahawks on a 5-year $33 million contract to become head coach.

====Accomplishments====

As head coach, Pete Carroll led a resurgence of football at the University of Southern California. Carroll was generally regarded as one of the top college football coaches in the country, and has been compared to College Football Hall of Fame coach Knute Rockne. Program highlights under Carroll include:
*Two BCS Championship Game appearances: 2005 win over Oklahoma and 2006 loss to Texas
*The Associated Press 2003 National Championship
*The Associated Press 2004 National Championship

*A 25–1 record in the month of November

In July 2007, ESPN.com named USC its #1 team of the decade for the period between 1996 and 2006, primarily citing the Trojans&#x27; renaissance and dominance under Carroll. In 2007, his effect on the college football landscape was named one of the biggest developments over the past decade in &quot;ESPN the Magazine&quot;. In May 2008, Carroll was named the coach who did the most to define the first 10 years of the BCS Era.

In July 2014, Carroll was announced as a member of the 2015 USC Athletic Hall of Fame class.

====NCAA sanctions and ruling====

On June 9, 2010, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Carroll, along with other active and former USC officials, had appeared in front of a ten-member NCAA Committee on Infractions the previous February. The next day, June 10, the NCAA announced sanctions against the USC football program including a two-year bowl ban, the elimination of thirty football scholarships, and forfeiture of some football victories from 2004 to 2005 (a season which had included winning the Bowl Championship Series title), and all team victories from the undefeated 2005–06 regular season, when USC lost to Texas in the BCS title game. With the vacated games removed, Carroll drops to fourth on USC&#x27;s all-time wins list, behind John McKay, Howard Jones and John Robinson. His 97 on-field wins would put him ahead of Robinson for third in Trojan history.

The allegations centered on former Trojan star Reggie Bush. Bush was found to have accepted several improper gifts, including the use of a San Diego area home for members of his family. It was reported that USC might appeal the sanctions. These sanctions have been criticized by some NCAA football writers, including ESPN&#x27;s Ted Miller, who wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s become an accepted fact among informed college football observers that the NCAA sanctions against USC were a travesty of justice, and the NCAA&#x27;s refusal to revisit that travesty are a massive act of cowardice on the part of the organization.&quot;

After Carroll announced that he was leaving for the Seahawks, he denied the possibility that the NCAA sanctions were a factor in his leaving USC to return to pro football in Seattle. &quot;Not in any way,&quot; Carroll stated, &quot;because I know where we stand. It&#x27;s just a process we have to go through. We know we&#x27;ve fought hard to do right.&quot; Carroll was hired before the sanctions were announced.

Reacting to the USC sanctions in a video produced by his new employers, Carroll said on June 10, 2010, &quot;I&#x27;m absolutely shocked and disappointed in the findings of the NCAA.&quot; He said in 2014 during a visit to USC, &quot;I thought [the NCAA&#x27;s investigation into USC] was dealt with poorly and very irrationally and done with way too much emotion instead of facts. I sat in the meetings. I listened to the people talk. I listened to the venom that they had for our program... They tried to make it out like it was something else. They made a terrible error.&quot; In 2015, he said, &quot;We had so much success and we had so much fun doing it, it was uncommon for people to understand. ... I think it rubbed people the wrong way. There was such a bitterness.&quot;

=====Reactions=====
Wrote &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; sportswriter Jerry Crowe, &quot;It&#x27;s somehow apt that the Trojans were asked to return the Grantland Rice Trophy after being stripped of the 2004 Football Writers Assn. of America national championship... Grantland Rice was the legendary early 20th century sportswriter who wrote, &#x27;When the great scorer comes/to mark against your name/He&#x27;ll write not &#x27;won&#x27; or &#x27;lost&#x27;/but how you played the game.&#x27;&quot;

Among Carroll&#x27;s critics in the media was longtime &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; sportswriter Bill Plaschke, who said that in one stroke, Carroll went

&quot;Sporting News&quot; writer Mike Florio called for the Seahawks to fire Carroll, saying that &quot;justice won&#x27;t truly be served until the only coaching Carroll ever does entails holding an Xbox controller.&quot;

On August 26, 2010, the Football Writers Association of America announced it would take back USC&#x27;s 2004 Grantland Rice Trophy and leave that year&#x27;s award vacant, the only vacancy in the over half century of the history of the award. The FWAA also said it would not consider USC as a candidate for the award for the 2010 season. New USC athletic director Pat Haden said USC would return the trophy, stating, &quot;While we know that some fans and former student-athletes may be disappointed, our central priority at this time is our overall commitment to compliance and this action is in line with the standards we have set for our entire athletic program.&quot;

===Seattle Seahawks (2010–2024)===
After the Seattle Seahawks fired head coach Jim L. Mora after the 2009 season, Carroll was rumored to be in the running for the job. On January 8, 2010, it was reported that Carroll was about to be hired as head coach of the Seahawks; the two parties were hammering out &quot;minor details&quot; in the pending contract. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Carroll was &quot;close to reaching an agreement with the Seattle Seahawks on Friday evening.&quot; On the morning of January 9, 2010, Carroll reportedly came to agreement with the Seahawks on a five-year contract that would appoint him as head coach. He was officially hired as the Seahawks&#x27; head coach on January 11. He was also named executive vice president of football operations, effectively making him the Seahawks&#x27; general manager as well. While the Seahawks had a general manager in John Schneider, he served mainly in an advisory role to Carroll, who had the final say in football matters.

====2010–2012 seasons: Early years====
In his first season, Carroll almost completely overturned the Seahawks roster, totaling over 200 transactions in the course of only one season. These moves paved the way for a 4–2 start to the 2010 season. Although Seattle faltered through the latter half of the season, the team beat their NFC West division rival St. Louis Rams in the final week of the regular season for the division championship, becoming the first 7–9 team in NFL history to win a division title. Carroll made even more history as the Seahawks later upset the then-Super Bowl Champions New Orleans Saints by a score of 41–36 during the wild-card round of the playoffs, behind running back Marshawn Lynch and the famed Beast Quake run. However, the following week at Soldier Field in Chicago, Illinois, they then fell to the Chicago Bears, whom they had defeated earlier in the season, in the Divisional Round by a score of 35–24.

In 2011, Carroll again coached the Seahawks to a 7–9 record, but it was not enough to secure a playoff spot due to the ascendance of Carroll&#x27;s old college rival coach Jim Harbaugh and division rival San Francisco 49ers, who finished with a 13–3 record. It was the first season the Seahawks had a starting quarterback other than Matt Hasselbeck in over a decade.

In his third season with the Seahawks in 2012, Carroll, along with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson, led the team to an 11–5 record, including going undefeated at home. The 2012 season was Carroll&#x27;s first winning season for the team. The Seahawks were also involved in controversy during Week 3&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Green Bay Packers in Seattle, when the replacement officials called two different results for Russell Wilson&#x27;s Hail Mary pass to wide receiver Golden Tate. The officials called the play in the Seahawks&#x27; favor, igniting a national outrage about the officiating. When the NFL referee lockout ended several days later, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged that public furor over the call accelerated the eventual resolution of the labor dispute. Carroll&#x27;s record was enough to post the team&#x27;s second playoff berth, and the Seahawks won their Wild Card Round game on the road against the Washington Redskins and fellow rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III, 24–14. Seattle lost the following week in the Divisional Round to the Atlanta Falcons at the Georgia Dome by a score of 30–28.

====2013 season: Super Bowl XLVIII run====

The Seattle Seahawks 2013 season began with four consecutive preseason wins, and commentators had them as one of the key favorites in the NFC. The regular season began with a 12–7 victory against the Carolina Panthers. The prior year&#x27;s NFC Champions and divisional rival, the San Francisco 49ers, were blown out by the Seahawks, 29–3. Winning out September, they visited the Indianapolis Colts in Indianapolis and suffered their first loss, on October 6. That was the only loss that the team would suffer until December. Heading to San Francisco for their second match-up against their divisional foe, the Seahawks had the best record in the NFC at 11–1. However, the game was in stark contrast to their first in September, as the 49ers (9–4 at that point) edged out a 19–17 win, which dropped Seattle to 11–2. The penultimate game, against the Arizona Cardinals, was Seattle&#x27;s attempt to continue their at-home winning streak to 15 games (record started in Week 2 of the 2012 season). Although the Seahawks had won their three prior meetings, including one earlier in the year, the Cardinals had steadily improved during the season. The at-home win streak did not reach 15. The Cardinals won, and Seattle suffered its third loss of the year. They bounced back against the St. Louis Rams in their finale to finish at 13–3 and finish a game above both San Francisco and Carolina, who each had twelve wins. The number one team (and playoff seed) in the NFC, Carroll matched Mike Holmgren&#x27;s 2005 season of the same record, tying for the best in Seattle history. The Seahawks defeated the New Orleans Saints in the Divisional Round of the playoffs by a score of 23–15. In the NFC Championship Game, cornerback Richard Sherman tipped a Colin Kaepernick pass into the waiting arms of Malcolm Smith to secure a 23–17 win over the San Francisco 49ers. The moment has been referred to as both &quot;The Tip&quot; and the &quot;Immaculate Deflection&quot;.

On February 2, 2014, Carroll led the Seattle Seahawks to their first Super Bowl win in franchise history after defeating the Denver Broncos, 43–8, in Super Bowl XLVIII. Carroll joined Barry Switzer and Jimmy Johnson as the only coaches to win both an NCAA championship and a Super Bowl. At age 62, Carroll was then the third-oldest coach to win a Super Bowl. Tom Coughlin was 65 when the New York Giants won Super Bowl XLVI and Dick Vermeil was 63 when the St. Louis Rams won Super Bowl XXXIV.

====2014 season: Second consecutive NFC championship====
The following season in 2014, the Seahawks started off their quest to repeat as champions with a 36–16 defeat of the Green Bay Packers on &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; in the first game of the NFL season. A Super Bowl XLVIII rematch came in Week 3, with Seattle again defeating Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos, 26–20 in overtime. However, losses to the San Diego Chargers, Dallas Cowboys, St. Louis Rams, and Kansas City Chiefs caused the defending champions to start the season with a 6–4 record, three games behind the division leading Arizona Cardinals. After a team meeting following a Week 11 loss, the Seahawks finished the regular season 6–0 to finish with a 12–4 record. As the #1 seed in the playoffs, the Seahawks beat the Carolina Panthers in the Divisional Round, 31–17, to get to their second straight NFC Championship. After trailing 19–7 to the Green Bay Packers with just over two minutes remaining in the NFC Championship, the Seahawks launched a furious comeback to force overtime. On the first possession of overtime, Russell Wilson hit wide receiver Jermaine Kearse for a game-winning touchdown that sent the Seahawks to their second straight Super Bowl. On February 1, 2015, Carroll&#x27;s Seahawks lost Super Bowl XLIX to Carroll&#x27;s former team, the New England Patriots, 28–24. With 25 seconds to go on second down and goal at the Patriots&#x27; 1-yard line, and the Seahawks trailing by four points, Carroll called for a pass play. Wilson&#x27;s pass was intercepted by Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler on the goal line, and the Patriots ran out the clock. Some have called Carroll&#x27;s play-call on the play &quot;the worst play-call in NFL history.&quot;

====2015–2017 seasons====
The 2015 offseason was one full of criticism for Carroll, Wilson, and offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell after the ending of Super Bowl XLIX. However, Carroll was praised by much of the national media for how he handled the adversity following the game. The Seahawks began the 2015 season by blowing fourth quarter leads to the St. Louis Rams, Green Bay Packers, Cincinnati Bengals, Carolina Panthers, and Arizona Cardinals. After losing at home on &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot; to the division leading Cardinals, Seattle sat at 4–5. However, Carroll rejuvenated his team enough to win their next five games, putting the Seahawks at 9–5 and clinching a playoff berth. Russell Wilson became the first quarterback to throw 19 or more touchdown passes without any interceptions over five or more wins. The Seahawks ended the regular season with a revengeful win against the Arizona Cardinals, beating the NFC West champions 36–6 on the road. Seattle entered the postseason as the #6 seed, winning its Wild Card Round against the Minnesota Vikings after Vikings kicker Blair Walsh missed a 27-yard field goal for a final score of 10–9. The Seahawks would later fall to the Carolina Panthers in the Divisional Round 31–24, after being down 31–0 at the half, and as a result, the Seahawks would not reach a third consecutive Super Bowl appearance.

On July 25, 2016, Carroll signed a three-year contract extension with the Seahawks that would keep him in Seattle through the 2019 season. Carroll&#x27;s Seahawks once again had high expectations leading into the 2016 season, but injuries to key players on both sides of the ball eventually became too much to overcome. The Seahawks were able to start the season with a 4–1 record, despite Russell Wilson playing with a hurt ankle sustained in the season opener against the Miami Dolphins. In Week 10, the Seahawks travelled to New England to play the Patriots for the first time since the Super Bowl XLIX loss, and came away with a 31–24 victory to push the Seahawks to 6–2–1. Carroll notched his 100th regular-season win the following week against the Philadelphia Eagles. The Seahawks clinched the NFC West in Week 15, following a 24–3 victory over the Los Angeles Rams. It was Carroll&#x27;s fourth NFC West division title in his seven seasons with the team, and sixth playoff appearance. In the Wild Card Round, the Seahawks dominated the Detroit Lions in a 26–6 victory. The victory extended Seattle&#x27;s playoff home game win streak to 10 consecutive wins, 6 of which have come under Carroll. The Seahawks were eliminated in the Divisional Round for the second straight year in 2016, losing 36–20 to the Atlanta Falcons. In his season-ending press conference, Carroll revealed that cornerback Richard Sherman had been playing with a &quot;significant&quot; MCL injury, which attracted attention because Sherman had not been listed on the injury report throughout the season.

In 2017, his eighth season with the Seahawks, Carroll led the team to a 9–7 record. The team finished second in the NFC West but missed out on the playoffs for only the second time in Carroll&#x27;s time with the Seahawks.

====2018–2020 seasons====
In the 2018 season, Carroll helped lead the Seahawks to a 10–6 record and a second-place finish in the NFC West. The team returned to the playoffs, where they lost 24–22 to the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card Round. On October 14, 2018, Carroll reached win number 91 over the Oakland Raiders, becoming the Seahawks&#x27; all-time wins leader (including postseason), passing Mike Holmgren with a record of 91–56–1 at that point.

On September 15, 2019, which was his 68th birthday, Carroll won his 100th game as the Seahawks head coach, defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers 28–26. Carroll&#x27;s Seahawks finished the season at 11–5, finishing second in the NFC West behind the 13–3 San Francisco 49ers. As a fifth seed in the playoffs, the Seahawks defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 17–9 in the Wild Card Round, before being eliminated in the Divisional Round by the Green Bay Packers 28–23. Carroll coached the NFC team in the 2020 Pro Bowl.

During the 2020 offseason, Carroll, along with New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick would be named as coaches for the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team.
Carroll was fined by the NFL for not properly wearing a face mask, as required for coaches during the COVID-19 pandemic, during a Week 2 game in the 2020 NFL season on September 21, 2020. On November 8, 2020, Carroll and the Seahawks agreed to a four-year contract extension. They ended the season with a 12–4 record and won their first division title since 2016, but lost to the Los Angeles Rams in the Wild Card Round.

====2021 season====
Carroll and the Seahawks named Rams passing game coordinator Shane Waldron to the offensive coordinator position. Under Waldron, Seattle&#x27;s offense got off to a hot start, with quarterback Russell Wilson completing 18 of 23 passes for 254 yards and four touchdowns as the Seahawks won 28–16 to the Indianapolis Colts, finishing with a passer rating of 152.3. The following week against the Tennessee Titans, the Seahawks lost 33–30 in overtime, after blowing a 30–16 lead in the fourth quarter. In Week 3 against the Minnesota Vikings, the Seahawks raced to a 17–7 lead early in the second quarter before their offense was shut out by the Vikings for the rest of the game; Seattle lost 30–17. In Week 5 against the Los Angeles Rams on &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;, quarterback Russell Wilson broke his finger on a sack by Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald, and he was ruled out as backup Geno Smith relieved him in the 26–17 loss.

Wilson was placed on injured reserve later that same day, missing a start for the first time in his NFL career. Carroll and the Seahawks went 1–2 in Wilson&#x27;s absence before hitting the bye week. Wilson was activated off injured reserve on November 12 ahead of their game against the Green Bay Packers. Wilson and the Seahawks were blanked in the 17–0 loss for the first time since he became their starting quarterback, completing just 20 of 40 passes for 161 yards and two interceptions.

Carroll&#x27;s Seahawks rallied to finish the season by winning four of their final six games, with one loss coming by just one point. During the season, the Seahawks&#x27; first such losing season since 2011, Carroll candidly admitted to the media that he &quot;probably wouldn&#x27;t have been here a long time&quot; without his longtime starting quarterback. Despite the disappointing season, it was reported on January 16, 2022, that Carroll and general manager John Schneider would retain their jobs for the 2022 season.

====2022–2023 seasons: Departure of Wilson and final years as Seahawks head coach====
In the offseason, Russell Wilson was traded to the Denver Broncos. Carroll later named Geno Smith the starter for the regular season opener, which would be against Wilson and the Broncos. In Week 1, the Seahawks defeated the Broncos 17–16 on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. Carroll led the Seahawks to a 9–8 finish and an appearance in the playoffs. The Seahawks&#x27; season ended in the Wild Card Round with a 41–23 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.

In 2023, Carroll again led the Seahawks to a 9–8 record. However, on the last day of the season, Seattle was eliminated from the playoffs after the Green Bay Packers, who had an identical record but held the playoff tiebreaker over the Seahawks, won over the Chicago Bears in the final game.

On January 10, 2024, Carroll and the Seahawks mutually agreed that he would step down from his head coaching role. Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald would be named as his successor later that month; he would state that he wanted to maintain the team culture first built by Carroll. Notably, Macdonald was half of Carroll&#x27;s age upon his hiring, resulting in the Seahawks going from having the oldest head coach in the league to the youngest.

====2024 season: Senior Advisor====
After stepping down as head coach, Carroll remained with the Seahawks organization but was moved to an advisor role. During the 2024 preseason, Carroll revealed that aside from a brief greeting in the parking lot, he had no contact with Macdonald, in order to let him build the team in his own vision. He also stated that he had little to do with the Seahawks, aside from watching a few of the preseason games on television, feeling it was the right thing to do to let them go. 

During the middle of the season, Carroll and Macdonald would have a non-business encounter at an NBA preseason game at Climate Pledge Arena. Macdonald was in attendance with members of the Seahawks front office, and upon learning that Carroll was there as well, decided to greet his predecessor and exchange pleasantries.

=== Las Vegas Raiders (2025–present) ===
On January 25, 2025, Carroll was hired as the head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, departing Seattle after 15 years with the Seahawks organization. Upon coaching his first game for the Raiders, he will become the oldest head coach in NFL history.

==Coaching style==
On offense, Carroll is known for using aggressive play-calling that is open to trick plays as well as &quot;going for it&quot; on 4th down instead of punting the ball away. Because of his aggressive style, the USC band gave him the nickname &quot;Big Balls Pete&quot;. At USC home games, when Carroll decided to go for it on 4th down, the USC band would start a chant of &quot;Big Balls Pete&quot; that carried over to the students section and the alumni.

On defense, Carroll favors a bend-but-don&#x27;t-break scheme of preventing the big plays: allowing opposing teams to get small yardage but trying to keep the plays in front of his defenders.

Carroll draws coaching inspiration from the 1974 book &quot;The Inner Game of Tennis&quot; by tennis coach W. Timothy Gallwey, which he picked up as graduate student at the University of the Pacific; he summarizes the philosophy he took from the book as &quot;all about clearing the clutter in the interactions between your conscious and subconscious mind&quot;, enabled &quot;through superior practice and a clear approach. Focus, clarity and belief in yourself are what allows [&quot;sic&quot;] you to express your ability without discursive thoughts and concerns.&quot; He wrote a foreword for a later edition, noting that athletes &quot;must clear their minds of all confusion and earn the ability to let themselves play freely.&quot; He also cites influences from psychologists Abraham Maslow and Carl Jung, Buddhist meditation master Chögyam Trungpa, and Zen master D. T. Suzuki.

After he was fired by the New England Patriots, Carroll read a book by former UCLA basketball coach John Wooden which heavily influenced how he would run his future program at USC: emulating Wooden, Carroll decided to engineer his program in the way that best exemplified his personal philosophy. He decided his philosophy was best summarized as &quot;I&#x27;m a competitor&quot;. As a fan of the Grateful Dead, Carroll then tied Wooden&#x27;s thoughts into those by Jerry Garcia, and decided that he wanted his football program to not be the best, but the only program following his competitive philosophy.

Carroll is known for his high-energy and often pleasant demeanor when coaching. In explaining his enthusiasm, Carroll has stated, &quot;I always think something good&#x27;s just about to happen.&quot; In a 2005 interview, Carroll explained his motivation:
Carroll has been known to plan elaborate surprises and pranks during practice to lighten the mood and reward the players; notable examples include using a Halloween practice to stage a fake argument and subsequent falling death of running back LenDale White, having defensive end Everson Griffen arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department during a team meeting for &quot;physically abusing&quot; freshman offensive linemen, and several pranks involving USC alumnus and comedic actor Will Ferrell. During practices, Carroll frequently gets involved doing drills: running sprints and routes as well as throwing the ball. Under Carroll, nearly all USC practices were open to the public, a move that was uncommon among programs; he believed that having fans at practice helped his team prepare, making mundane drills seem more interesting, causing players to perform at a high level when they know they have an audience and preparing them for larger crowds on game days.

Despite his penchant for humor, Carroll&#x27;s USC program had strictly prescribed routines that covered what players were allowed to eat, the vocabulary they used, and the theme of daily practices. Under his tenure, days had descriptive nicknames like Tell the Truth Monday, Competition Tuesday, Turnover Wednesday.

Carroll favorably compared college recruiting to any other competition, and enjoys the ability to recruit talent, which he was unable to do in the NFL. He likens being a college head coach to being both the &quot;coach and general manager.&quot; He assigned all jersey numbers to his players, an assignment he takes seriously. When he was an incoming freshman at Pacific, he wanted No. 40, the number he had worn in all sports growing up; however, Pacific had retired the number in honor of quarterback/safety Eddie LeBaron, so Carroll ended up with 46.

==Philanthropy==
After moving to Los Angeles, Carroll was affected by the number of gang-related murders taking place in poorer areas. In April 2003, Carroll helped organize a meeting with political leaders, high-ranking law enforcement officials and representatives from social service, education and faith-based communities at USC&#x27;s Heritage Hall for a brainstorming session. The result was the founding of A Better LA, a charity devoted to reducing violence in targeted urban areas of Los Angeles.

===Work with children===
In April 2009, Carroll launched CampPete.com, a multi-player online game &quot;billed as a ground-breaking Web site aimed at bringing Coach Carroll&#x27;s unique Win Forever philosophy to kids all over the country by taking advantage of one of the hottest technology trends online, the virtual world.&quot; The site, which can be accessed by creating a virtual avatar, includes arcade-style games, motivational messages from Coach Carroll and a sports trivia section as well as a collection of virtual football skills workshops for kids. A portion of the proceeds from CampPete.com go to support A Better LA.

==Personal life==
Carroll and his wife, Glena, have three children, Brennan, Jaime, and Nate. Brennan and Nate have been part of the Seattle Seahawks coaching staff.
