<text>The term periodical cicada is commonly used to refer to any of the seven species of the genus Magicicada of eastern North America, the 13- and 17-year cicadas. They are called periodical because nearly all individuals in a local population are developmentally synchronized and emerge in the same year. Although they are sometimes called &quot;locusts&quot;, this is a misnomer, as cicadas belong to the taxonomic order Hemiptera (true bugs), suborder Auchenorrhyncha, while locusts are grasshoppers belonging to the order Orthoptera. &quot;Magicicada&quot; belongs to the cicada tribe Lamotialnini, a group of genera with representatives in Australia, Africa, and Asia, as well as the Americas.

&quot;Magicicada&quot; species spend around 99.5% of their long lives underground in an immature state called a nymph. While underground, the nymphs feed on xylem fluids from the roots of broadleaf forest trees in the eastern United States. In the spring of their 13th or 17th&quot; &quot;year, mature cicada nymphs emerge between late April and early June (depending on latitude), synchronously and in tremendous numbers. The adults are active for only about four to six weeks after the unusually prolonged developmental phase.

The males aggregate in chorus centers and call there to attract mates. Mated females lay eggs in the stems of woody plants. Within two months of the original emergence, the life cycle is complete and the adult cicadas die. Later in that same summer, the eggs hatch and the new nymphs burrow underground to develop for the next 13 or 17&quot; &quot;years.

Periodical emergences are also reported for the &quot;World Cup cicada&quot; &quot;Chremistica ribhoi&quot; (every 4&quot; &quot;years) in northeast India and for a cicada species from Fiji, &quot;Raiateana knowlesi&quot; (every 8&quot; &quot;years).

==Description==

The winged imago (adult) periodical cicada has two red compound eyes, three small ocelli, and a black dorsal thorax. The wings are translucent with orange veins. The underside of the abdomen may be black, orange, or striped with orange and black, depending on the species.

Adults are typically , depending on species, generally about 75% the size of most of the annual cicada species found in the same region. Mature females are slightly larger than males.

&quot;Magicicada&quot; males typically form large aggregations that sing in chorus to attract receptive females. Different species have different characteristic calling songs. The call of decim periodical cicadas is said to resemble someone calling &quot;weeeee-whoa&quot; or &quot;Pharaoh&quot;. The cassini and decula periodical cicadas (including &quot;M. tredecula&quot;) have songs that intersperse buzzing and ticking sounds.

Cicadas cannot sting and do not normally bite. Like other Auchenorrhyncha (true) bugs, they have mouthparts used to pierce plants and suck their sap. These mouthparts are used during the nymph stage to tap underground roots for water, minerals and carbohydrates and in the adult stage to acquire nutrients and water from plant stems. An adult cicada&#x27;s proboscis can pierce human skin when it is handled, which is painful but in no other way harmful. Cicadas are neither venomous nor poisonous and there is no evidence that they or their bites can transmit diseases.

Oviposition by female periodical cicadas damages pencil-sized twigs of woody vegetation. Mature trees rarely suffer lasting damage, although peripheral twig die-off or &quot;flagging&quot; may result. Planting young trees or shrubs is best postponed until after an expected emergence of the periodical cicadas. Existing young trees or shrubs can be covered with cheesecloth or other mesh netting with holes that are in diameter or smaller to prevent damage during the oviposition period, which begins about a week after the first adults emerge and lasts until all females have died.

==Life cycle==


Nearly all cicadas spend years underground as juveniles, before emerging above ground for a short adult stage of several weeks to a few months. The seven periodical cicada species are so named because, in any one location, all members of the population are developmentally synchronized—they emerge as adults all at once in the same year. This periodicity is especially remarkable because their life cycles are so long—13 or 17 years. 

In contrast, for nonperiodical species, some adults mature each summer and emerge while the rest of the population continues to develop underground. Many people refer to these nonperiodical species as annual cicadas because some are seen every summer. This may lead some to conclude that the non-periodic cicadas have life cycles of 1&quot; &quot;year. This is incorrect. The few known life cycles of &quot;annual&quot; species range from two to 10&quot; &quot;years, although some could be longer.

The nymphs of the periodical cicadas live underground, usually within of the surface, feeding on the juices of plant roots. The nymphs of the periodical cicada undergo five instar stages in their development underground. The difference in the 13- and 17-year life cycle is said to be the time needed for the second instar to mature. When underground the nymphs move deeper below ground, detecting and then feeding on larger roots as they mature. 

The nymphs seem to track the number of years by detecting the changes in the xylem caused by abscission of the tree. This was supported experimentally by inducing a grove of trees to go through two cycles of losing and re-growing leaves in one calendar year. Cicadas feeding on those trees emerged after 16&quot; &quot;years instead of 17.

In late April to early June of the emergence year, mature fifth-instar nymphs construct tunnels to the surface and wait for the soil temperature to reach a critical value. In some situations, nymphs extend mud turrets up to several inches above the soil surface. The function of these turrets is not known, but the phenomenon has been observed in some nonperiodical cicadas, as well as other tunneling insects.

The nymphs first emerge on a spring evening when the soil temperature at around of depth is above . The crepuscular emergence is thought to be related to the fact that maximum soil temperatures lag behind maximum insolation by several hours, conveniently providing some protection for the flightless nymphs against diurnal sight predators such as birds. For the rest of their lives the mature periodical cicadas will be strongly diurnal, with song often nearly ceasing at night.

During most years in the United States this emergence cue translates to late April or early May in the far south, and late May to early June in the far north. Emerging nymphs may molt in the grass or climb from a few centimeters to more than 100 feet (30 m) to find a suitable vertical surface to complete their transformation into adults. After securing themselves to tree trunks, the walls of buildings, telephone poles, fenceposts, hanging foliage, and even stationary automobile tires, the nymphs undergo a final molt and then spend about six days in the trees to await the complete hardening of their wings and exoskeletons. Just after emerging from this final molt the teneral adults are off-white, but darken within an hour.

Adult periodical cicadas live for only a few weeks; by mid-July, all have died. Their ephemeral adult forms are adapted for one purpose: reproduction. Like other cicadas the males produce a very loud species-specific mating song using their tymbals. Singing males of the same &quot;Magicicada&quot; species tend to form aggregations called &quot;choruses&quot; whose collective songs are attractive to females. Males in these choruses alternate bouts of singing with short flights from tree to tree in search of receptive females. Most matings occur in so-called chorus trees.

Receptive females respond to the calls of conspecific males with timed wing-flicks (visual signaling is apparently a necessity in the midst of the males&#x27; song) which attract the males for mating. The sound of a chorus can be literally deafening and depending on the number of males composing it, may reach 100 dB in the immediate vicinity. In addition to their &quot;calling&quot; or &quot;congregating&quot; songs, males produce a distinctive courtship song when approaching an individual female.

Both males and females can mate multiple times, although most females seem to mate only once . After mating, the female cuts V-shaped slits in the bark of young twigs and lays about 20 eggs in each, for a total clutch of 600 or more. After about 6–10 weeks, the eggs hatch and the nymphs drop to the ground, where they burrow and begin another 13- or 17-year cycle.
==Predator satiation survival strategy==
The nymphs emerge in very large numbers at nearly the same time, sometimes more than 1.5 million individuals per acre (&gt;370/m2). Their mass emergence is, among other things, a survival trait called predator satiation. The details of this strategy are simple: for the first week after emergence the periodical cicadas are easy prey for reptiles, birds, squirrels, cats, dogs and other small and large mammals. In their present range the periodical cicadas have no effective predators, and all other animals feeding on them after emergence quickly become irrelevant with respect to their impact on total cicada populations.

Early entomologists maintained that the cicadas&#x27; overall survival mechanism was simply to overwhelm predators by their sheer numbers, ensuring the survival of most of the individuals. Later, the fact that the developmental periods were each a prime number of years (13 and 17) was hypothesized to be a predator avoidance strategy, one adopted to eliminate the possibility of potential predators receiving periodic population boosts by synchronizing their own generations to divisors of the cicada emergence period.

On this prime number hypothesis, a predator with a three-year reproductive cycle, which happened to coincide with a brood emergence in a given year, will have gone through either four cycles plus one year (12&quot; &quot;+&quot; &quot;1) or five cycles plus two years (15&quot; &quot;+&quot; &quot;2) by the next time that brood emerges. In this way prime-numbered broods exhibit a strategy to ensure that they nearly always emerge when some portion of the predators they will confront are sexually immature and therefore incapable of taking maximum advantage of the momentarily limitless food supply.

Another viewpoint turns this hypothesis back onto the cicada broods themselves. It posits that the prime-numbered developmental times represent an adaptation to prevent hybridization &quot;between&quot; broods. It is hypothesized that this unusual method of sequestering different populations in time arose when conditions were extremely harsh. Under those conditions the mutation producing extremely long development times became so valuable that cicadas which possessed it found it beneficial to protect themselves from mating with cicadas that lacked the long-development trait.

In this way, the long-developing cicadas retained a trait allowing them to survive the period of heavy selection pressure (i.e., harsh conditions) brought on by isolated and lowered populations during the period immediately following the retreat of glaciers (in the case of periodical cicadas, the North American Pleistocene glacial stadia). When seen in this light, their mass emergence and the predator satiation strategy that follows from this serves only to maintain the much &quot;longer-term&quot; survival strategy of protecting their long-development trait from hybridizations that might dilute it.

This hybridization hypothesis was subsequently supported through a series of mathematical models and remains the most widely-accepted explanation for the unusually lengthy and mathematically sophisticated survival strategy of these insects. The length of the cycle was hypothesized to be controlled by a single gene locus, with the 13-year cycle dominant to the 17-year one, but this interpretation remains controversial and unsubstantiated at the level of DNA.

===Impact on other populations===
Cycles in cicada populations are significant enough to affect other animal and plant populations. For example, tree growth has been observed to decline the year before the emergence of a brood because of the increased feeding on roots by the growing nymphs. Moles, which feed on nymphs, have been observed to do well during the year before an emergence, but suffer population declines the following year because of the reduced food source. Wild turkey populations respond favorably to increased nutrition in their food supply from gorging on cicada adults on the ground at the end of their life cycles. Uneaten carcasses of periodical cicadas decompose on the ground, providing a resource pulse of nutrients to the forest community.

Cicada broods may also have a negative impact. Eastern gray squirrel populations have been negatively affected, because the egg-laying activity of female cicadas damaged upcoming mast crops.

==Broods==
Periodical cicadas are grouped into geographic based on the calendar year when they emerge. For example, in 2014, the 13-year Brood XXII emerged in Louisiana and the 17-year Brood III emerged in western Illinois and eastern Iowa.

In 1907, entomologist Charles Lester Marlatt assigned Roman numerals to 30 different broods of periodical cicadas: 17 distinct broods with a 17-year life cycle, to which he assigned brood numbers I through XVII (with emerging years 1893 through 1909); plus 13 broods with a 13-year cycle, to which he assigned brood numbers XVIII through XXX (1893 through 1905). Marlatt noted that the 17-year broods are generally more northerly than are the 13-year broods.

Many of these hypothetical 30 broods have not been observed. Marlatt noted that some cicada populations (especially Brood XI in the valley of the Connecticut River in Massachusetts and Connecticut) were disappearing, a fact that he attributed to the reduction in forests and the introduction and proliferation of insect-eating &quot;English sparrows&quot; (House sparrows, &quot;Passer domesticus&quot;) that had followed the European settlement of North America. Two of the broods that Marlatt named (Broods XI and XXI) have become extinct. His numbering scheme has been retained for convenience (and because it clearly separates 13- and 17-year life cycles), although only 15 broods are known to survive.
Periodical cicadas that emerge outside the expected time frame are called stragglers. Although they can emerge at any time, they usually do so one or four years before or after most other members of their broods emerge. Stragglers with a 17-year life cycle typically emerge four years early. Those with a 13-year cycle typically emerge four years late. The emergence of stragglers may in theory be indicative of a brood shifting from a 17-year cycle to a 13-year one.

Brood XIII of the 17-year cicada, which reputably has the largest emergence of cicadas by size known anywhere, and Brood XIX of the 13-year cicada, arguably the largest (by geographic extent) of all periodical cicada broods, were expected to emerge together in 2024 for the first time since 1803. However, the two broods were not expected to overlap except potentially in a thin area in central and eastern Illinois (Macon, Sangamon, Livingston, and Logan counties). The next such dual emergence of these two particular broods will occur in 2245, 221 years after 2024. Many other 13-year and 17-year broods emerge during the same years, but the broods are not geographically close.
===Map of brood locations===
==Taxonomy==
=== Phylogeny ===
&quot;Magicicada&quot; is a member of the cicada tribe Lamotialnini, which is distributed globally aside from South America. Despite &quot;Magicicada&quot; being only found in eastern North America, its closest relatives are thought to be the genera &quot;Tryella&quot; and &quot;Aleeta&quot; from Australia, with &quot;Magicicada&quot; being sister to the clade containing &quot;Tryella&quot; and &quot;Aleeta&quot;. Within the Americas, its closest relative is thought to be the genus &quot;Chrysolasia&quot; from Guatemala.

=== Species ===
Seven recognized species are placed within &quot;Magicicada&quot;—three 17-year species and four 13-year species. These seven species are also sometimes grouped differently into three subgroups, the so-called Decim species group, Cassini species group, and Decula species group, reflecting strong similarities of each 17-year species with one or more species with a 13-year cycle.
===Evolution and speciation===

Not only are the periodical cicada life cycles curious for their use of the prime numbers 13 or 17, but their evolution is also intricately tied to one- and four-year changes in their life cycles. One-year changes are less common than four-year changes and are probably tied to variation in local climatic conditions. Four-year early and late emergences are common and involve a much larger proportion of the population than one-year changes. The different species are well-understood to have originated from a process of allochronic speciation, in which species subpopulations that are isolated from one another in time eventually become reproductively isolated as well.

Research suggests that in extant periodical cicadas, the 13- and 17-year life cycles evolved at least eight different times in the last 4 million years and that different species with identical life cycles developed their overlapping geographic distribution by synchronizing their life cycles to the existing dominant populations. The same study estimates that the Decim species group split from the common ancestor of the Decula plus Cassini species groups around 4 million years ago (Mya). At around 2.5 Mya, the Cassini and Decula groups split from each other.

The Sota &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) paper also calculates that the first separation of extant 13-year cicadas from 17-year cicadas took place in the Decim group about 530,000 years ago when the southern &quot;M. tredecim&quot; split from the northern &quot;M. septendecim&quot;. The second noteworthy event took place about 320,000&quot; &quot;years ago with the split of the western Cassini group from its conspecifics to the east. The Decim and the Decula clades experienced similar western splits, but these are estimated to have taken place 270,000 and 230,000&quot; &quot;years ago, respectively. The 13- and 17-year splits in Cassini and Decula took place after these events.

The 17-year cicadas largely occupy formerly glaciated territory, and as a result their phylogeographic relationships reflect the effects of repeated contraction into glacial refugia (small islands of suitable habitat) and subsequent re-expansion during multiple interglacial periods. In each species group, Decim, Cassini, and Decula, the signature of the glacial periods is manifested in three phylogeographic genetic subdivisions: one subgroup east of the Appalachians, one midwestern, and one on the far western edge of their range.

The Sota &quot;et al.&quot; data suggest that the founders of the southern 13-year cicada populations originated from the Decim group. These were later joined by Cassini originating from the western Cassini clade and Decula originating from eastern, middle, and western Decula clades. As Cassini and Decula invaded the south, they became synchronized with the resident &quot;M. tredecim&quot;. These Cassini and Decula are known as &quot;M. tredecassini&quot; and &quot;M. tredecula&quot;. More data is needed to lend support to this hypothesis and others hypotheses related to more recent 13- and 17-year splits involving &quot;M. neotredecim&quot; and &quot;M. tredecim&quot;.

==Distribution==
The 17-year periodical cicadas are distributed from the Eastern states, across the Ohio Valley, to the Great Plains states and north to the edges of the Upper Midwest, while the 13-year cicadas occur in the Southern and Mississippi Valley states, with some slight overlap of the two groups. For example, broods IV (17-year cycle) and XIX (13-year cycle) overlap in western Missouri and eastern Oklahoma. Their emergences should again coincide in 2219, 2440, 2661, etc., as they did in 1998 (although distributions change slightly from generation to generation and older distribution maps can be unreliable).

An effort sponsored by the National Geographic Society is underway as of April 2021 at the University of Connecticut to generate new distribution maps of all periodical cicada broods. The effort uses crowdsourced data and records that entomologists and volunteers collect.

==Parasites, pests and pathogens==
Although it usually feeds on oak leaf gall midge (&quot;Polystepha pilulae&quot;) larvae and other insects, the oak leaf gall mite (&quot;itch mite&quot;) (&quot;Pyemotes herfsi&quot;) becomes an ectoparasite of periodical cicada eggs when these are available. After cicadas deposit their eggs in the branches of trees, feeding mites reproduce and their numbers increase.
After cicada emergences have ended, many people have therefore developed rashes, pustules, intense itching and other mite bite sequelae on their upper torso, head, neck and arms. Rashes and itching peaked after several days, but lasted as long as two weeks. Anti-itch treatments, including calamine lotion and topical steroid creams, did not relieve the itching.

&quot;Massospora cicadina&quot; is a pathogenic fungus that infects only 13 and 17 year periodical cicadas. Infection results in a &quot;plug&quot; of spores that replaces the end of the cicada&#x27;s abdomen while it is still alive, leading to infertility, disease transmission, and eventual death of the cicada.

==Symbiosis==
&quot;Magicicada&quot; are unable to obtain all of the essential amino acids from the dilute xylem fluid that they feed upon, and instead rely upon endosymbiotic bacteria that provide essential vitamins and nutrients for growth. Bacteria in the genus &quot;Hodgkinia&quot; live inside periodical cicadas, and grow and divide for years before punctuated cicada reproduction events impose natural selection on these bacteria to maintain a mutually beneficial relationship. As a result, the genome of &quot;Hodgkinia&quot; has fractionated into three independent bacterial species each containing only a subset of genes essential for this symbiosis. The host requires all three subgroups of symbionts, as only the complete complement of all three subgroups provides the host with all its essential nutrients. The &quot;Hodgkinia&quot;–&quot;Magicicada&quot; symbiosis is a powerful example of how bacterial endosymbionts drive the evolution of their hosts.

==History==
The first known account of a large emergence of cicadas appeared in a 1633 report by William Bradford, the governor of the Plymouth Colony, which had been established in 1620 within the future state of Massachusetts. After describing a &quot;pestilent fever&quot; that had swept through the colony and neighboring Indians, the report stated:
It is to be observed that, the spring before this sickness, there was a numerous company of &quot;Flies&quot; which were like for bigness unto wasps or &quot;Bumble-Bees&quot;; they came out of little holes in the ground, and did eat up the green things, and made such a constant yelling noise as made the woods ring of them, and ready to deafen the hearers; they were not any seen or heard by the &quot;English&quot; in this country before this time; but the &quot;Indians&quot; told them that sickness would follow, and so it did, very hot, in the months of &quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;, and &quot;August&quot; of that summer. (Elaborating on an observation that Marlatt reported in 1907, Gene Kritsky has suggested that Bradford&#x27;s report is misdated, as Broods XI and XIV would have emerged in Plymouth in 1631 and 1634, respectively, while no presently known brood would have emerged there in 1633.)

Historical accounts cite reports of 15- to 17-year recurrences of enormous numbers of noisy emergent cicadas (&quot;locusts&quot;) written as early as 1733. John Bartram, a noted Philadelphia botanist and horticulturist, was among the early writers that described the insect&#x27;s life cycle, appearance and characteristics.

On May 9, 1715, Andreas Sandel, the pastor of Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;Gloria Dei&quot; Swedish Lutheran Church, described in his journal an emergence of Brood X. Pehr Kalm, a Finnish naturalist visiting Pennsylvania and New Jersey in 1749 on behalf of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, observed in late May another emergence of that brood. When reporting the event in a paper that a Swedish academic journal published in 1756, Kalm wrote: 
Kalm then described Sandel&#x27;s report and one that he had obtained from Benjamin Franklin that had recorded in Philadelphia the emergence from the ground of large numbers of cicadas during early May 1732. He noted that the people who had prepared these documents had made no such reports in other years.

Kalm further noted that others had informed him that they had seen cicadas only occasionally before the insects emerged from the ground in Pennsylvania in large swarms on May 22, 1749. He additionally stated that he had not heard any cicadas in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in 1750 in the same months and areas in which he had heard many in 1749. The 1715 and 1732 reports, when coupled with his own 1749 and 1750 observations, supported the previous &quot;general opinion&quot; that he had cited.

Kalm summarized his findings in a book translated into English and published in London in 1771, stating:

Based on Kalm&#x27;s account and a specimen that Kalm had provided, in 1758 Carl Linnaeus named the insect &quot;Cicada &quot; in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;.

Moses Bartram, a son of John Bartram, described the next appearance of the brood (Brood X) that Kalm had observed in 1749 in an article entitled &quot;Observations on the cicada, or locust of America, which appears periodically once in 16 or 17 years&quot; that he wrote in 1766. Bartram&#x27;s article, which a London journal published in 1768, noted that upon hatching from eggs deposited in the twigs of trees, the young insects ran down to the earth and &quot;entered the first opening that they could find&quot;. He reported that he had been able to discover them below the surface, but that others had reportedly found them deep.

In 1775, Thomas Jefferson recorded in his &quot;Garden Book&quot; Brood II&#x27;s 17-year periodicity, writing that an acquaintance remembered &quot;great locust years&quot; in 1724 and 1741, that he and others recalled another such year in 1758 and that the insects had again emerged from the ground at Monticello in 1775. He noted that the females lay their eggs in the small twigs of trees while above ground.

The 1780 emergence of the Brood VII cicadas (also known as the Onondaga brood) during the American Revolutionary War, coincided with the aftermath of the military operation known as the Sullivan Expedition which devastated the indigenous Onondagan communities and destroyed their crops. The sudden arrival of such a substantial quantity of the cicadas provided a source of sustenance for the Onondaga people who were experiencing severe food insecurity following the Sullivan campaigns and the subsequent brutal winter. The seemingly miraculous arrival of the cicadas is commemorated by the Onondaga as though it were an intervention by the Creator to ensure their survival after such a traumatizing, catastrophic event. 

In April 1800, Benjamin Banneker, who lived near Ellicott&#x27;s Mills, Maryland, wrote in his record book that he recalled a &quot;great locust year&quot; in 1749, a second in 1766 during which the insects appeared to be &quot;full as numerous as the first&quot;, and a third in 1783. He predicted that the insects (Brood X) &quot;may be expected again in they year 1800 which is Seventeen Since their third appearance to me&quot;. Describing an effect that the pathogenic fungus, &quot;Massospora cicadina&quot;, has on its host, Banneker&#x27;s record book stated that the insects:... begin to Sing or make a noise from first they come out of the Earth till they die. The hindermost part rots off, and it does not appear to be any pain to them, for they still continue on Singing till they die.

In 1845, D.L. Pharas of Woodville, Mississippi, announced the 13-year periodicity of the southern cicada broods in a local newspaper, the &quot;Woodville Republican&quot;. In 1858, Pharas placed the title &quot;Cicada tredecim&quot; in a subsequent article that the newspaper published on the subject. Ten years later, the &quot;American Entomologist&quot; published in December 1868 a paper that Benjamin Dann Walsh and Charles Valentine Riley had written that also reported the 13-year periodicity of the southern cicada broods.

Walsh&#x27;s and Riley&#x27;s paper, which &quot;Scientific American&quot; reprinted in January 1869, illustrated the interior and exterior characteristics of the nymphs&#x27; emergence holes and raised turrets. Their article, which did not cite Pharas&#x27; reports, was the first to describe the southern cicadas&#x27; 13-year periodicity that received widespread attention. Riley later acknowledged Pharas&#x27; work in an 1885 publication on periodical cicadas that he authored.
In 1998, an emergence contained a brood of 17-year cicadas (Brood IV) in western Missouri and a brood of 13-year cicadas (Brood XIX) over much of the rest of the state. Each of the broods are the state&#x27;s largest of their types. As the territories of the two broods overlap (converge) in some areas, the convergence was the state&#x27;s first since 1777.

In 2007 and 2008, Edmond Zaborski, a research scientist with the Illinois Natural History Survey, reported that the oak leaf gall mite (&quot;itch mite&quot;) (&quot;Pyemotes herfsi&quot;) is an ectoparasite of periodical cicada eggs. While investigating with the help of others the mysterious itchy welts and rashes that people were developing in Chicago&#x27;s suburbs after the end of a 2007 Brood XIII emergence, he attributed the event to bites by mites whose populations had quickly increased while parasitizing those eggs. Similar events occurred in Cincinnati after a Brood XIV emergence ended in 2008, in Cleveland and elsewhere in northern and eastern Ohio after a Brood V emergence ended in 2016, in the Washington, D.C., area after a Brood X emergence ended in 2021, and again in the Chicago area after the next Brood XIII emergence ended in 2024.

==Use as human food==
&quot;Magicicada&quot; species are edible when cooked for people who lack allergies to similar foods. A number of recipes are available for this purpose. Some recommend collecting the insects shortly after molting while still soft. Others exhibit preferences for emergent nymphs or hardened adults.

The insects have historically been eaten by Native Americans, who fried them or roasted them in hot ovens, stirring them until they were well browned. Marlatt wrote in 1907:

<text>Oryctolagus () is a genus of lagomorph that today contains the European rabbit and its descendant, the domestic rabbit, as well as several fossil species.

The generic name derives from (, “dug up”) and (, “hare”).

== Evolution ==
&quot;Oryctolagus&quot; first appeared at the end of the Miocene, around 6.5 MYA. Fossil remains from the middle Pliocene led to the recognition of two species, &quot;Oryctolagus lacosti&quot; in southern France and northwestern Italy and &quot;Oryctolagus laynensis&quot; in the Iberian Peninsula. This latter form is thought to be the origin of the extant species.

== Species ==
*&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot; - European rabbit
**&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus domesticus&quot; - Domestic rabbit

*†&quot;Oryctolagus lacosti&quot;
*†&quot;Oryctolagus laynensis&quot;

<text>Herkimer County Community College, or Herkimer College since 2014, is a public community college in Herkimer, Herkimer County, New York. It is part of the State University of New York system.

== History ==
The college was approved by the State University of New York in 1965, and the County Board of Supervisors authorized the college in 1966. The first class, numbering 221 freshmen, entered in the Fall of 1967 at a temporary campus in the Village of Ilion. The temporary campus was the upper floors of the Remington Arms Company. The current, permanent campus came into use in 1971.

In 2014, the college rebranded itself as Herkimer College, although it remains a two-year college.

Herkimer College offers programs leading to associate degrees or certificates in several dozen program areas. The College&#x27;s Internet Academy offers 20 degrees, three certificates and more than 150 courses, as well as support services, completely online.

Herkimer College began a new A.A.S degree in Esports Management in 2023.

The college had previously partnered with Cazenovia College to offer a bachelor&#x27;s degrees in &quot;Criminal Justice and Homeland Security&quot; and Inclusive Early Childhood on the Herkimer campus. Cazenovia, however, closed in 2023.

== Athletics ==
Herkimer&#x27;s athletic program began with five sports in 1970, under the direction of Tom LaPuma, and has grown to include 19 varsity offerings. With its growth has come great success with 60 NJCAA National Championships, 128 Region III Championships, 169 Mountain Valley Collegiate Conference championships, and 31 NJCAA Academic Team of the Year awards as of Spring 2020.

Herkimer&#x27;s men&#x27;s lacrosse team had a lengthy streak of success from the late &#x27;80s through the 2000s, winning the national championship in 1988, 1989, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 2003 and 2005. At times, several players were Iroquois, believed to be the largest Native American contingent in a collegiate lacrosse team.

The Herkimer Generals athletics program has won the National Alliance of Two-Year College Athletic Administrators (NATYCAA) Cup four times, in 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2020. The award recognizes Herkimer as first in the nation among two-year non-scholarship athletic programs.

Herkimer College has an esports team competing nationally and the college has an esports arena on campus.

<doc id="594976" wikidata="Q273995" url="?curid=594976" title="Wendy Cope">
<text>Wendy Cope (born 21 July 1945) is a contemporary English poet. She read history at St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford. She now lives in Ely, Cambridgeshire, with her husband, the poet Lachlan Mackinnon.

==Biography==
Cope was born in Erith in Kent (now in the London Borough of Bexley), where her father Fred Cope was manager of the local department store, Hedley Mitchell. She was educated at West Lodge Preparatory School in Sidcup and Farrington&#x27;s School, Chislehurst, both in Kent. After graduating from St Hilda&#x27;s College and Westminster College, Oxford, Cope spent fourteen years as a primary-school teacher. In 1981, she became Arts and Reviews editor for the Inner London Education Authority magazine, &quot;Contact&quot;. Five years later she became a freelance writer and was a television critic for &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine until 1990.

Five collections of her adult poetry have been published, &quot;Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis&quot; in 1986, &quot;Serious Concerns&quot; in 1992, &quot;If I Don&#x27;t Know&quot; in 2001, &quot;Family Values&quot; in 2011, and &quot;Anecdotal Evidence&quot; in 2018. She has also edited several anthologies of comic verse and was a judge of the 2007 Man Booker Prize.

In 1998, she was voted the listeners&#x27; choice in a BBC Radio 4 poll to succeed Ted Hughes as Poet Laureate. When Andrew Motion&#x27;s term as Poet Laureate came to an end in 2009, Cope was again widely considered a popular candidate, although she believes the post should be discontinued. Carol Ann Duffy succeeded Motion as Poet Laureate.

Cope was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours. In April 2011, the British Library purchased Cope&#x27;s archive including manuscripts, school reports and 40,000 emails, the largest email archive they have bought to date. The papers also includes 67 poetry notebooks and unpublished poems. Cope commented &quot;I wanted to find a good home for my archive. The timing was dictated because we had to move home, so we needed some money to buy a house, and the space. So this was the moment. I asked Andrew Motion what I should do, and he told me someone to approach at the British Library. I wasn&#x27;t sure they would want it, but they did.&quot; When the collection is catalogued and organised, the archive will be available to researchers.

In 2013, after 19 years of living together, Cope married Lachlan Mackinnon in a register office, although she has stated that she would have preferred a civil partnership.

In January 2019 she was the guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s long-running programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Her book choice was &quot;The Compleet Molesworth&quot; by Geoffrey Willans, her luxury item was writing materials and her favourite track was Bach&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Two Violins and Strings in D minor&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Despite her slight output, her books have sold well and she has attracted a popular following with her lighthearted, often comical poetry, as well as achieving literary credibility winning two awards and making an award shortlist over a fourteen-year period. She has a keen eye for the everyday, mundane aspects of English life, especially the desires, frustrations, hopes, confusions and emotions in intimate relationships. Dr Rowan Williams is a well known fan of her work, writing that: &quot;Wendy Cope is without doubt the wittiest of contemporary English poets, and says a lot of extremely serious things&quot;. In 2021, the poet and critic Rory Waterman published the first critical book on her work, for the Writers and Their Work series.

Three haikus from &quot;Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis&quot;, where they are presented as being written by the (fictional) Tulse Hill poet Jason Strugnell, were set by the composer Colin Matthews in 1990 as &quot;Strugnell&#x27;s Haiku&quot;.

In 2008 Cope&#x27;s poem &quot;After The Lunch&quot; was used as the lyric of the song &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; by jazz composer and musician Jools Holland and singer Louise Marshall.

==Progression of style==
Wendy Cope&#x27;s style progression spans nearly fifty years. While she has released over two dozen publications, her most well-known works are her five intermittent poetry collections: &quot;Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis&quot; (1986), &quot;Serious Concerns&quot; (1992), &quot;If I Don’t Know&quot; (2001), &quot;Family Values&quot; (2011), and &quot;Anecdotal Evidence&quot; (2018). The changes in her both her writing style and life can be tracked in these five collections.

Cope acknowledges that the first two are quite different from the latter three. She claims this is due to the major role played by her happiness in her writing, and that her first two collections were written when she was fairly unhappy. Both collections&#x27; poems vary in content, but are similar in structure. Generally, each poem features a lighthearted tone with punchline jokes and a dry, compressed wit. The punchline is often &quot;centered on men from the point of view of the single heterosexual woman&quot;. Paired with an admiration for life and the mundane, the collections garnered Cope popularity. Cope&#x27;s style and humor became so consistent that both fans and critics alike began to label pieces written in this style as &quot;Wendy Cope poems&quot; - anthems for &quot;several generations of frustrated and conflicted women&quot;. This style was admired for neat rhyme schemes, humorous observations, and unexpected politically charged strikes at concepts like marriage or the patriarchy.

The following three publications are notably darker. They have also been less popular. The wild success of &quot;Serious Concerns&quot; in the 1990s changed Cope&#x27;s life entirely. Newfound money and resources allowed her to quit teaching, dedicate herself to writing, and begin living with Mackinnon, whom she later married in 2013. As her happiness increased, her poetry changed. Free verse poems with darker tones replaced light-hearted rhyme. Cope&#x27;s allusions to her battles with depression, a theme present in all of her work, grew more frequent. The freedom of success allowed Cope to focus on more thorny issues.

&quot;Serious Concerns&quot; stands as Cope&#x27;s most popular book, even thirty years later. One top-ten list of &#x27;must read&#x27; Cope poems has all top five poems as coming from her first two collections. However, Cope herself disagrees with the concept of a &quot;Wendy Cope anthem&quot;. Cope&#x27;s favourite of her own works is &quot;Anecdotal Evidence.&quot; Her favourite of her own poems is &#x27;Flowers&#x27; from &quot;Serious Concerns.&quot; 

Her domestic love poem &#x27;The Orange&#x27; became increasingly viral from 2018, leading to Faber &amp; Faber releasing a line of accompanying merchandise for it, and publishing a new edition of her works in 2023, entitled &quot;The Orange and other poems&quot;.

<doc id="594987" wikidata="Q536691" url="?curid=594987" title="Cheez Whiz">
<text>Cheez Whiz is a brand of processed cheese sauce and spread produced by Kraft Foods. It was developed by a team led by food scientist Edwin Traisman (1915–2007). It was first sold in 1952, and, with some changes in formulation, continues to be in production today.

Orangish-yellow in color, it usually comes in a glass jar and is used as a topping for various foods, including corn chips and hot dogs. It is also frequently used as the cheese in a Philadelphia-style cheesesteak. It is marketed in Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, the United States, and Venezuela. In the United States, it has a reputation as being junk food.

== Ingredients ==

A 1953 ad in Kraft Foods’ home city, Chicago, included a label illustration listing the product’s original ingredients: “American Cheese, Water, Nonfat Dry Milk Solids, Condensed Whey, Sodium Phosphate, Cream, Worcestershire Sauce, Lactic Acid, Mustard, Salt, U.S. Certified Color--Moisture 52%, Milkfat 28%.”

As of 2016, Kraft describes Cheez Whiz as a &quot;cheese dip&quot; with the word &quot;cheese&quot; spelled correctly. According to a Kraft spokesman, the product does include cheese, but the company has chosen to list its parts—such as cheese culture and milk—instead of cheese as a component itself.
== Sizes ==
In some markets, the product has been sold in a narrow jar that tapered narrower towards the base, and sold as a spread. When Cheez Whiz is advertised as a dip or a sauce, the jars are larger and more of a squat cylindrical shape.

== Varieties ==

Varieties include:
* Cheez Whiz
* Cheez Whiz Light
* Cheez Whiz Tex Mex
* Salsa Con Queso
* Cheez Whiz Italia
* Cheez Whiz Bacon
* Cheez Whiz Pimento

Cheez Whiz can also be found in &quot;Handi Snacks&quot; products such as Ritz Cheez Whiz &#x27;n&#x27; Crackers in Canada.

Cheez Whiz was reformulated in the early 21st century. The new formula is used for Cheez Whiz Light (15.5 oz) as well as the Original Big Cheese (15 oz). The products&#x27; jars were also widened to allow dipping.

== Formula change ==

Over the years since the product&#x27;s creation, Kraft has altered its recipe due to changes in dairy sourcing and the regulatory environment, resulting in a reduction of cheese content. Kraft also made a change in the way that it lists its ingredients; away from listing components (like cheese) to listing its parts (such as milk and cheese culture). Such changes are common throughout the food industry, and are often done without announcement.

Dean Southworth, who was part of the original team that developed Cheez Whiz in the 1950s, described a jar he sampled in 2001 as tasting &quot;like axle grease&quot;.

<doc id="594990" wikidata="Q913343" url="?curid=594990" title="Psychrophile">
<text>Psychrophiles or cryophiles (adj. &quot;psychrophilic&quot; or &quot;cryophilic&quot;) are extremophilic organisms that are capable of growth and reproduction in low temperatures, ranging from to . They are found in places that are permanently cold, such as the polar regions and the deep sea. They can be contrasted with thermophiles, which are organisms that thrive at unusually high temperatures, and mesophiles at intermediate temperatures. Psychrophile is Greek for &#x27;cold-loving&#x27;, .

Many such organisms are bacteria or archaea, but some eukaryotes such as lichens, snow algae, phytoplankton, fungi, and wingless midges, are also classified as psychrophiles.

==Biology==

===Habitat===
The cold environments that psychrophiles inhabit are ubiquitous on Earth, as a large fraction of the planetary surface experiences temperatures lower than 10 °C. They are present in permafrost, polar ice, glaciers, snowfields and deep ocean waters. These organisms can also be found in pockets of sea ice with high salinity content. Microbial activity has been measured in soils frozen below −39 °C. In addition to their temperature limit, psychrophiles must also adapt to other extreme environmental constraints that may arise as a result of their habitat. These constraints include high pressure in the deep sea, and high salt concentration on some sea ice.

===Adaptations===
Psychrophiles are protected from freezing and the expansion of ice by ice-induced desiccation and vitrification (glass transition), as long as they cool slowly. Free living cells desiccate and vitrify between −10 °C and −26 °C. Cells of multicellular organisms may vitrify at temperatures below −50 °C. The cells may continue to have some metabolic activity in the extracellular fluid down to these temperatures, and they remain viable once restored to normal temperatures.

They must also overcome the stiffening of their lipid cell membrane, as this is important for the survival and functionality of these organisms. To accomplish this, psychrophiles adapt lipid membrane structures that have a high content of short, unsaturated fatty acids. Compared to longer saturated fatty acids, incorporating this type of fatty acid allows for the lipid cell membrane to have a lower melting point, which increases the fluidity of the membranes. In addition, carotenoids are present in the membrane, which help modulate the fluidity of it.

Antifreeze proteins are also synthesized to keep psychrophiles&#x27; internal space liquid, and to protect their DNA when temperatures drop below water&#x27;s freezing point. By doing so, the protein prevents any ice formation or recrystallization process from occurring.

The enzymes of these organisms have been hypothesized to engage in an activity-stability-flexibility relationship as a method for adapting to the cold; the flexibility of their enzyme structure will increase as a way to compensate for the freezing effect of their environment.

Certain cryophiles, such as Gram-negative bacteria &quot;Vibrio&quot; and &quot;Aeromonas&quot; spp., can transition into a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state. During VBNC, a micro-organism can respire and use substrates for metabolism – however, it cannot replicate. An advantage of this state is that it is highly reversible. It has been debated whether VBNC is an active survival strategy or if eventually the organism&#x27;s cells will no longer be able to be revived. There is proof however it may be very effective – Gram positive bacteria Actinobacteria have been shown to have lived about 500,000 years in the permafrost conditions of Antarctica, Canada, and Siberia.

===Taxonomic range===
Psychrophiles include bacteria, lichens, snow algae, phytoplankton, fungi, and insects.

Among the bacteria that can tolerate extreme cold are &quot;Arthrobacter&quot; sp., &quot;Psychrobacter&quot; sp. and members of the genera &quot;Halomonas&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Hyphomonas&quot;, and &quot;Sphingomonas&quot;. Another example is &quot;Chryseobacterium greenlandensis&quot;, a psychrophile that was found in 120,000-year-old ice.

&quot;Umbilicaria antarctica&quot; and &quot;Xanthoria elegans&quot; are lichens that have been recorded photosynthesizing at temperatures ranging down to −24 °C, and they can grow down to around −10 °C. Some multicellular eukaryotes can also be metabolically active at sub-zero temperatures, such as some conifers; those in the &quot;Chironomidae&quot; family are still active at −16 °C.
Microalgae that live in snow and ice include green, brown, and red algae. Snow algae species such as &quot;Chloromonas sp.&quot;, &quot;Chlamydomonas sp.&quot;, and &quot;Chlorella sp.&quot; are found in polar environments.

Some phytoplankton can tolerate extremely cold temperatures and high salinities that occur in brine channels when sea ice forms in polar oceans. Some examples are diatoms like &quot;Fragilariopsis cylindrus&quot;, &quot;Nitzchia lecointeii&quot;, &quot;Entomoneis kjellmanii&quot;, &quot;Nitzchia stellata&quot;, &quot;Thalassiosira australis&quot;, &quot;Berkelaya adeliense&quot;, and &quot;Navicula glaciei&quot;.

&quot;Penicillium&quot; is a genus of fungi found in a wide range of environments including extreme cold.

Among the psychrophile insects, the Grylloblattidae or ice crawlers, found on mountaintops, have optimal temperatures between 1–4 °C. The wingless midge (Chironomidae) &quot;Belgica antarctica&quot; can tolerate salt, being frozen and strong ultraviolet, and has the smallest known genome of any insect. The small genome, of 99 million base pairs, is thought to be adaptive to extreme environments.

==Psychrotrophic bacteria==
Psychrotrophic microbes are able to grow at temperatures below , but have better growth rates at higher temperatures. Psychrotrophic bacteria and fungi are able to grow at refrigeration temperatures, and can be responsible for food spoilage and as foodborne pathogens such as &quot;Yersinia&quot;. They provide an estimation of the product&#x27;s shelf life, but also they can be found in soils, in surface and deep sea waters, in Antarctic ecosystems, and in foods.

Psychrotrophic bacteria are of particular concern to the dairy industry. Most are killed by pasteurization; however, they can be present in milk as post-pasteurization contaminants due to less than adequate sanitation practices. According to the Food Science Department at Cornell University, psychrotrophs are bacteria capable of growth at temperatures at or less than . At freezing temperatures, growth of psychrotrophic bacteria becomes negligible or virtually stops.

All three subunits of the RecBCD enzyme are essential for physiological activities of the enzyme in the Antarctic &quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot;, namely, repairing of DNA damage and supporting the growth at low temperature. The RecBCD enzymes are exchangeable between the psychrophilic &quot;P. syringae&quot; and the mesophilic &quot;E. coli&quot; when provided with the entire protein complex from same species. However, the RecBC proteins (RecBCPs and RecBCEc) of the two bacteria are not equivalent; the RecBCEc is proficient in DNA recombination and repair, and supports the growth of &quot;P. syringae&quot; at low temperature, while RecBCPs is insufficient for these functions. Finally, both helicase and nuclease activity of the RecBCDPs are although important for DNA repair and growth of &quot;P. syringae&quot; at low temperature, the RecB-nuclease activity is not essential in vivo.

== Psychrophilic microalgae ==

Microscopic algae that can tolerate extremely cold temperatures can survive in snow, ice, and very cold seawater. On snow, cold-tolerant algae can bloom on the snow surface covering land, glaciers, or sea ice when there is sufficient light. These snow algae darken the surface of the snow and can contribute to snow melt. In seawater, phytoplankton that can tolerate both very high salinities and very cold temperatures are able to live in sea ice. One example of a psychrophilic phytoplankton species is the ice-associated diatom &quot;Fragilariopsis cylindrus&quot;. Phytoplankton living in the cold ocean waters near Antarctica often have very high protein content, containing some of the highest concentrations ever measured of enzymes like Rubisco.

== Psychrotrophic insects ==

Insects that are psychrotrophic can survive cold temperatures through several general mechanisms (unlike opportunistic and chill susceptible insects): (1) chill tolerance, (2) freeze avoidance, and (3) freeze tolerance. Chill tolerant insects succumb to freezing temperatures after prolonged exposure to mild or moderate freezing temperatures. Freeze avoiding insects can survive extended periods of time at sub-freezing temperatures in a supercooled state, but die at their supercooling point. Freeze tolerant insects can survive ice crystal formation within their body at sub-freezing temperatures. Freeze tolerance within insects is argued to be on a continuum, with some insect species exhibiting partial (e.g., &quot;Tipula paludosa&quot;, &quot;Hemideina thoracica&quot;
), moderate (e.g., &quot;Cryptocercus punctulatus&quot;), and strong freezing tolerance (e.g., &quot;Eurosta solidaginis&quot; and &quot;Syrphus ribesii&quot;&quot;)&quot;, and other insect species exhibiting freezing tolerance with low supercooling point (e.g., &quot;Pytho deplanatus&quot;).

==Psychrophile versus psychrotroph==

In 1940, ZoBell and Conn stated that they had never encountered &quot;true psychrophiles&quot; or organisms that grow best at relatively low temperatures. In 1958, J. L. Ingraham supported this by concluding that there are very few or possibly no bacteria that fit the textbook definitions of psychrophiles. Richard Y. Morita emphasizes this by using the term &quot;psychrotroph&quot; to describe organisms that do not meet the definition of psychrophiles. The confusion between the terms &quot;psychrotrophs&quot; and &quot;psychrophiles&quot; was started because investigators were unaware of the thermolability of psychrophilic organisms at the laboratory temperatures. Due to this, early investigators did not determine the cardinal temperatures for their isolates.

The similarity between these two is that they are both capable of growing at zero, but optimum and upper temperature limits for the growth are lower for psychrophiles compared to psychrotrophs. Psychrophiles are also more often isolated from permanently cold habitats compared to psychrotrophs. Although psychrophilic enzymes remain under-used because the cost of production and processing at low temperatures is higher than for the commercial enzymes that are presently in use, the attention and resurgence of research interest in psychrophiles and psychrotrophs will be a contributor to the betterment of the environment and the desire to conserve energy.

<doc id="595003" wikidata="Q5384587" url="?curid=595003" title="Equipoise (horse)">
<text>Equipoise (1928–1938) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a career which lasted from 1930 until 1935, he ran fifty-one times and won twenty-nine races. A leading two-year-old in 1930, he missed most of the next season, including two of the three American Triple Crown races through injury and illness. &quot;Ekky&quot; returned to the track in 1934 and proved to be a dominant champion, winning numerous important stakes races in the next three years. Equipoise died in 1938 after a short but promising stud career.

==Background==
Equipoise was a chestnut bred in the United States by Harry Payne Whitney and owned by his son, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. He was called the &quot;Chocolate Soldier&quot; by his fans, due to his elegance and symmetry. His sire, Pennant, won the Belmont Futurity Stakes for Harry Payne Whitney in 1913. Equipoise&#x27;s dam, Swinging, was a descendant of The Oaks winner Miami, placing him in the same Thoroughbred family as the 1897 English Triple Crown winner Galtee More and the 1902 Epsom Derby winner Ard Patrick as well as some well-known American runners, such as Intentionally and Seabiscuit.

As a yearling, Equipoise was an unimpressive individual. C. V. Whitney thought so little of the ugly duckling that he sent him to his second-string trainer, Fred Hopkins.

==Racing career==

===1930–1931: early career===
As a two-year-old, Equipoise ran sixteen times, claiming his first stakes victory when he won the Keene Memorial Stakes at Belmont Park. In September, he ran in the Belmont Futurity the most valuable two-year-old race of the season in which he was beaten a nose by Jamestown. Although Jamestown&#x27;s victory was regarded by some as having decided the identity of the best two-year-old, he did not race again in 1930, while Equipoise went on to further success. On November 5, he beat Twenty Grand by half a length with Mate a neck away in third in the Pimlico Futurity. After starting slowly, he settled the race in the straight with what the &quot;New York Times&quot; described as &quot;a brilliant burst of speed&quot; to reverse two earlier defeats by Twenty Grand. When his jockey, Sonny Workman, was asked if this was his greatest race, Workman replied: &quot;My greatest race? Hell, it may have been the greatest race anybody ever saw.&quot;

Although there were no formal awards for Thoroughbred racing in 1930, press opinion was that Equipoise&#x27;s win at Pimlico entitled him to &quot;a share of the 2 year old championship honors&quot;

Equipoise started 1931 as the favorite for the Kentucky Derby and won on his reappearance at Havre de Grace, Maryland. At the same track on April 26, he finished last of the six runners in the Chesapeake Stakes, after which he was reported to be suffering from a kidney ailment described as &quot;azoturia&quot; or &quot;blackwater&quot;. Later reports ascribed his defeat to problems with his &quot;shelly&quot; feet. In the Preakness Stakes, which was the first of the Triple Crown races in 1931, he finished fourth behind Mate. A week later, he was withdrawn from the Derby on the day of the race and did not race again that year.

===1932–1935: later career===
As a four-year-old in 1932, Equipoise won ten of his fourteen starts. On May 21, he won the Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park from Sun Meadow, with Mate third. Equipoise, who started 3/5 favorite, won by two and a half lengths despite being eased down by Workman near the finish and was received with &quot;thunderous applause&quot;. On May 31 at Arlington Park, Chicago, Equipoise set a world record of 1:34.4 for a mile when winning the Delavan Purse. In the Stars and Stripes Handicap at the same course four days later, he &quot;outclassed&quot; his opponents. On August 13, Equipoise led all the way to win the Whitney Stakes by three lengths from the three-year-old Gusto. According to the New York Times report, the win confirmed his status as the best horse in the handicap division.

At five, Equipoise won seven more races. On June 3, he gave 26 pounds to the runner-up, Okapi, in again winning the Metropolitan, living up to his reputation as the &quot;king of the handicap horses&quot;. Four days later, he ran in the Suburban Handicap carrying 132 pounds over a mile and a quarter. He won by two lengths from Osculator, with Apprentice five lengths back in third. In August, he faced the highly regarded Gallant Sir in the Hawthorne Gold Cup and won a &quot;thrilling&quot; race by two lengths to record his sixth successive win. His other wins included April&#x27;s Philadelphia Handicap at Havre de Grace Racetrack which he won again in 1934. In September he won the Saratoga Cup in which he raced beyond a mile and a quarter for the first time and won from Gusto and Keep Out.

As a six-year-old, Equipoise was kept in training with the aim of beating Sun Beau&#x27;s earnings record. In the spring, he won the Philadelphia Handicap at Havre de Grace and the Dixie Handicap at Pimlico before being rested till autumn. On November 6, he overcame a wet and muddy Belmont track (described as a &quot;sea of slop&quot;) to beat Faireno in the Whitney Gold Trophy. At the start of 1935, the seven-year-old Equipoise was sent to California for the inaugural running of the world&#x27;s richest race, the Santa Anita Handicap, which was to be his final race. He showed some promise in defeat in two prep races and started favorite despite top weight of 130 pounds against what was described as &quot;the greatest field of horses ever assembled&quot;. Equipoise&#x27;s challenge ended in disappointment: according to Sonny Workman, he &quot;simply wouldn&#x27;t run&quot; as he finished seventh to the Irish-bred Steeplechase specialist Azucar. Whitney later revealed that Equipoise had suffered a recurrence of the tendon injury which had kept him off the track in the previous summer. He was retired to stud with earnings of $338,610, the second highest in racing history up to that time.

==Assessment==
His career was greatly restricted by hoof problems, but he was still regarded by contemporary observers as the outstanding American horse of his era. Although there were no formal awards at this time, he was regarded as United States Horse of the Year in both 1932 and 1933 and as the best older horse in 1932, 1933, and 1934.

In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, which ranked only horses that ran in North America, Equipoise was ranked #21. In their book &quot;A Century of Champions&quot;, the British writers Tony Morris and John Randall placed Equipoise at #163 in their global ranking of 20th Century Thoroughbreds. Equipoise was also inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York, in 1957.

==Stud record==
Equipoise stood as a stallion for only four seasons before his death on August 4, 1938, at the age of ten. Four years later, the success of his progeny, notably the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes winner Shut Out, saw him become America&#x27;s Champion sire.

In &quot;Fugue for Tinhorns,&quot; the opening number of the musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, Equipoise is referred to as the great-grandfather of one of the song&#x27;s fictional racehorses.

&quot;...he..streaked down the street like Equipoise after a sack of oats.&quot;

Equipoise is one of the racing mice in the movie &quot;Stalag 17&quot;.

<doc id="595007" wikidata="Q1335257" url="?curid=595007" title="Warren Magnuson">
<text>Warren Grant Magnuson (April 12, 1905May 20, 1989) was an American lawyer and politician who represented the state of Washington in Congress for 44 years, first as a Representative from 1937 to 1944, and then as a senator from 1944 to 1981. Magnuson was a member of the Democratic Party. He was Washington state&#x27;s longest-serving senator, serving over 36 years. During his final two years in office, he was the most senior senator and president pro tempore.

==Early life and education==
Warren Magnuson was born in Moorhead, Minnesota. His birthdate is supposedly April 12, 1905, but the actual records of his birth are sealed. According to various sources, he never knew his birth parents; they may have died within a month of his birth, or his unmarried mother may have put him up for adoption. William Grant and Emma (née Anderson) Magnuson adopted Warren, and gave him their name. The Magnusons were second-generation Scandinavian immigrants who operated a bar in Moorhead, and adopted a daughter, Clara, a year after adopting Warren. His adoptive father left the family in 1921.

Magnuson attended Moorhead High School, where he played quarterback on the football team and was captain of the baseball team. While in high school, he ran a YMCA camp, worked on wheat farms, and delivered newspapers and telegrams in Moorhead and nearby Fargo, North Dakota. He graduated in 1923, and then enrolled at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. In 1924, he transferred to the North Dakota Agricultural College in Fargo, which he attended for a year. He then traveled through Canada for some time, riding freight trains and working with threshing crews.

Magnuson followed a high school girlfriend to Seattle, Washington, where he entered the University of Washington in 1925. He was a member of Theta Chi fraternity, and worked delivering ice as a Teamsters member under Dave Beck. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1926, and earned a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Washington School of Law in 1929. A Democrat, he first became active in politics in 1928, volunteering for A. Scott Bullitt for governor and Al Smith for president.

==Early career==
In 1929, Magnuson was admitted to the bar and joined the law office of Judge Samuel Stern in Seattle. He served as secretary of the Seattle Municipal League from 1930 to 1931 and served as a special prosecutor for King County in 1932, investigating official misconduct. He founded the state chapter of the Young Democrats of America that same year. He was a leading supporter of repealing state Prohibition laws and establishing the state Liquor Control Board.

From 1933 to 1935, Magnuson served as a member of the Washington House of Representatives from the Seattle-based 37th Legislative District. As a state legislator, he sponsored the first unemployment compensation bill in the nation. Magnuson was a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1933. He briefly served as Assistant United States District Attorney before being elected prosecuting attorney of King County, serving from 1934 to 1936.

==Congressional career==
===House of Representatives===

In 1936, as incumbent Congressman and Magnuson&#x27;s friend Marion Zioncheck showed serious mental instability and uncertainty about seeking reelection, Magnuson announced his candidacy. Two days after Magnuson entered the race, Zioncheck announced that he would not run again, and within a week Zioncheck committed suicide by jumping from his office window. With the endorsement of the influential, left-wing Washington Commonwealth Federation and support from the Seattle business community, Magnuson easily won the Democratic primary and then the general election.

In 1937, Magnuson and Senators Homer Bone and Matthew Neely introduced the National Cancer Institute Act, signed into law by Franklin Roosevelt on August 5 of that year. He was reelected in 1938, 1940, and 1942. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Magnuson staunchly supported the U.S. war effort.

Magnuson served in the United States Navy during World War II. He was aboard the aircraft carrier for several months, seeing heavy combat in the Pacific Theatre until Roosevelt ordered all congressmen on active duty to return home in 1942.

===Senate===
In 1944, Magnuson was elected to the U.S. Senate. On December 14, 1944, Governor Arthur B. Langlie appointed Magnuson to fill the vacancy created by Homer Bone&#x27;s appointment to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. He resigned from the House and started his Senate tenure a month early, gaining an advantage in seniority.

Magnuson was reelected in 1950, 1956, 1962, 1968, and 1974. He served on the Senate Commerce Committee throughout his tenure in the Senate. In his last years in the Senate, he gave up his chairmanship of the Commerce Committee to chair the Senate Appropriations Committee, as a result of the death of Senator John L. McClellan. Magnuson served most of his Senate tenure alongside his friend and colleague from Washington state, Henry M. &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson. Republican State Attorney General Slade Gorton defeated Magnuson in the 1980 election.

Magnuson was responsible for special legislation in 1949 that allowed Poon Lim, a Chinese sailor who in 1942 survived 133 days alone at sea as a castaway, to immigrate to the U.S. and become a citizen.

In August 1950, Magnuson proposed voluntary enlistment for the Japanese in the American armed forces and sent a cable request to General Douglas MacArthur on the practicality of the proposal.

In November 1961, President John F. Kennedy visited Seattle and was an honored guest at a celebration honoring Magnuson&#x27;s first 25 years in Congress. Nearly 3,000 people paid $100 each to attend the dinner.

The bill that became the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was referred to the Committee on Commerce. Magnuson played a key role in getting it to the floor and enacted into law despite vigorous opposition by Senator William Fulbright and other segregationists.

At the end of August 1966, after President Lyndon Johnson announced the nominations of Charles F. Luce for Undersecretary of the Interior, John A. Carver for Federal Power Commission membership, and David S. Black for BPA administrator, Magnuson announced the Senate Commerce committee would hold hearings on Carver&#x27;s nomination on September 1. He called Luce &quot;one of the most able, dedicated, productive public servants I know.&quot;

On November 7, 1967, Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, citing Magnuson as one of the members of Congress to &quot;have been part of the team that has brought this measure to the White House to make it the law of our land.&quot;

Magnuson attended the May 5, 1978, dedication ceremony for Riverfront Park in Spokane. Shortly after that, during a town hall meeting, President Jimmy Carter said, &quot;No one could be in a better political position than to be preceded and introduced by men like Tom Foley and Senator Warren Magnuson. I know of no one in the Congress than these two men who are more respected, more dedicated to serving their own people well, but who have also reached, because of their experience and knowledge, sound judgment and commitment, a position of national and even international renown and leadership.&quot;
===Legacy===
At least three important pieces of legislation bear Magnuson&#x27;s name: the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943 (commonly called the Magnuson Act), and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. He was also instrumental in keeping supertankers out of Puget Sound, by attaching an amendment to a routine funding reauthorization bill on the Senate and House consent calendars.

== Later years and death ==
After his defeat for reelection, Magnuson kept active in politics. He had been part of a U.N.-sponsored organization to study nuclear proliferation and lobbied the legislature to pass a flat tax for schools.

In his later years, Magnuson was beset by health problems. In 1982, he underwent surgery due to a diabetic condition, which saw several of the toes on his left foot amputated. As the decade progressed, Magnuson&#x27;s public presence dwindled appreciably. On May 20, 1989, Magnuson died from complications of diabetes and congestive heart failure at his Seattle home. He and his wife are interred in Acacia Memorial Park in Lake Forest Park, north of Seattle.

==Personal life==
In 1928, Magnuson married Eleanor Peggy &quot;Peggins&quot; Maddieux, crowned Miss Seattle the previous year. They remained together until their divorce in 1935. Magnuson dated several glamorous women, including heiress and cover girl June Millarde and actress Carole Parker. In 1964, he married Jermaine Elliott Peralta (1923–2011), widowed as a teenager, in a ceremony conducted by Rev. Frederick Brown Harris at the Omni Shoreham Hotel. The couple remained together until his death, and he helped raise Peralta&#x27;s daughter from her previous marriage, Juanita.

<text>Camille Guillaume Bigourdan (; 6 April 1851 – 28 February 1932) was a French astronomer.

== Personal life ==
Bigourdan was born at Sistels, Tarn-et-Garonne to Pierre Bigourdan and Jeanne Carrière. When his teachers and local curate recognised his intelligence, he was transferred to a local boarding school in Valence d’Agen, where he excelled. In 1870, he received his Baccalauréat with mention of &quot;Assez Bien&quot;.

He married Marie Mélanie Sophie Mouchez, the eldest daughter of Admiral Amédée Mouchez. Together, the two had nine children. The entire family, including the Mouchez cousins, would frequently vacation in Sistels until the outbreak of the First World War, after which Bigourdan would vacation alone. During these vacations, he would farm his land and visit former classmates.

He was fluent in Occitan, and spoke it when in Sistels.

== Academic and scientific career ==
Bigourdan studied at the University of Toulouse from 1870, where he received a physics degree in 1874 and a mathematics degree in 1876. To finance these studies, he taught at a boarding school.

In 1877 he was appointed by Félix Tisserand as assistant astronomer at the Toulouse Observatory, and in 1879 followed Tisserand to the Paris Observatory when the latter became director there.

In 1886, he submitted his doctoral thesis (FR: On the personal equation in double star measurements) on the measurements of 2800 double stars.

He spent many years verifying the positions of 6380 nebulae. He hoped to set a basis for future studies of the proper motion of nebulae; this turned out to be more or less in vain, since distant nebulae will not show any proper motion. However, he did discover approximately 500 new objects. These observations are published throughout 5 volumes of the &quot;Annales&quot; of the Paris observatory, over 3000 pages. Additionally, in 1894, Bigourdan discovered the asteroid 390 Alma.

Biogrourdan was an avid traveler for astronomical events; he took part in the observation of the transit of venus in Martinique in June 1882.  On the same trip, he visited St Petersburg, Kraków, Berlin and Vienna. In 1892, he visited Joal, Senegal, to observe the total eclipse of the sun on 16 April 1893.

In 1902 he participated in an effort to redetermine with greater precision the longitude difference between London and Paris. He became a member of the Bureau des Longitudes in 1903, and a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1904. Due to his interest in the transmission of time signals by wireless, he was instituted as the director of the newly founded International Time Service in 1912, which was in charge of maintaining the switch to the new Greenwich time. He remained in this position until 1928.

He described a method for adjusting equatorial mount telescopes, which was known as &quot;Bigourdan&#x27;s method&quot;.

Bigourdan won the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences in 1883 and in 1891, the Valz Prize of the same institution in 1886, and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1919. He was director of the Bureau International de l&#x27;Heure from 1919 to 1928. In 1919, he received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Société astronomique de France, the French astronomical society. In 1924, he was made president of the Académie des Sciences and the Institute of France, after serving as its vice-president in 1923.

In addition, Gifourdan discovered various lost manuscripts, particularly those of J.A.G Pingré, and contributed to numerous historical studies. He published in 1901.

<text>Stevioside is a glycoside derived from the stevia plant, which can be used as a sweetener. Evidence of benefit is lacking for long-term effects on weight loss and heart disease risks.

== Origin ==

Stevioside is the main sweetener (along with rebaudioside A) found in the leaves of &quot;Stevia rebaudiana&quot;, a plant originating in South America. Dried leaves, as well as aqueous extracts, have been used for decades as a sweetener in many countries, notably in Latin America and Asia (Japan, China). Stevioside was discovered in 1931 by French chemists who gave it its name. The sweetening power of stevioside was estimated to be about 300 times stronger than cane sugar.

== Safety ==

Since 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not objected to the use of stevia extracts and some purified steviosides, mainly stevioside and rebaudioside, as GRAS for use as an ingredient in manufactured foods.

<doc id="595014" wikidata="Q389257" url="?curid=595014" title="Battle of Arginusae">
<text>The Battle of Arginusae took place in 406 BC during the Peloponnesian War near the city of Canae in the Arginusae Islands, east of the island of Lesbos. In the battle, an Athenian fleet commanded by eight &quot;strategoi&quot; defeated a Spartan fleet under Callicratidas. The battle was precipitated by a Spartan victory, which led to the Athenian fleet under Conon being blockaded at Mytilene. To relieve Conon, the Athenians assembled a scratch force composed largely of newly-constructed ships manned by inexperienced crews. The inexperienced fleet was thus tactically inferior to the Spartans, but its commanders circumvented the problem by employing new and unorthodox tactics, which allowed the Athenians to secure a dramatic and unexpected victory. Slaves and metics who participated in the battle may have been granted Athenian citizenship.

The news of the victory itself was met with jubilation at Athens. Their joy was tempered, however, by the aftermath of the battle, in which a storm prevented the ships assigned to rescue the survivors of the 25 disabled or sunken Athenian triremes from performing their duties, and a great number of sailors drowned. A fury erupted at Athens when the public learned of that, and a bitter struggle occurred after which the assembly tried and executed as a group six of the eight commanding generals.

At Sparta, meanwhile, traditionalists who had supported Callicratidas pressed for peace with Athens since they knew that a continuation of the war would lead to the reascendence of their opponent Lysander. The party initially prevailed, and a delegation was dispatched to Athens to make an offer of peace. The Athenians, however, rejected the offer, and Lysander departed to the Aegean to take command of the fleet for the remainder of the war, which would be decided less than a year later by his total victory at the Battle of Aegospotami.

== Background ==

=== Callicratidas and Conon ===
In 406 BC, Callicratidas was appointed as the navarch of the Spartan fleet, replacing Lysander. Callicratidas was a traditionalist Spartan, distrustful of Persian influence and reluctant to ask for support from the Persian prince Cyrus, who had been a strong supporter of Lysander. Thus, Callicratidas was forced to assemble his fleet and funding by seeking contributions from Sparta&#x27;s allies among the Greek cities of the region. In this fashion, he assembled a fleet of some 140 triremes. Conon, meanwhile, in command of the Athenian fleet at Samos, was compelled by problems with the morale of his sailors to man only 70 of the more than 100 triremes he had in his possession.

Callicratidas, once he had assembled his fleet, sailed against Methymna, on Lesbos, which he laid siege to and stormed. From Methymna, Callicratidas could potentially move to capture the rest of Lesbos, which would clear the way for him to move his fleet to the Hellespont, where he would be athwart the all-important Athenian grain supply line. To defend Lesbos, Conon was forced to move his numerically-inferior fleet from Samos to the Hekatonnesi Islands near Methymna. When Callicratidas attacked him, however, with a fleet that had swollen to a size of 170 ships, Conon was forced to flee to Mytilene, where at the Battle of Mytilene, he was blockaded with his fleet after losing 30 ships in a clash at the mouth of the harbor. Besieged by land and sea, Conon was powerless to act against the vastly superior forces that surrounded him and only barely slipped a messenger ship out to Athens to carry the news of his plight.

=== Relief force ===
When the messenger ship reached Athens with news of Conon&#x27;s situation, the assembly wasted no time in approving extreme measures to build and man a relief force. The golden statues of Nike were melted down to fund the construction of the ships, and slaves and metics were enlisted to crew the fleet. To ensure a sufficiently large and loyal group of crewmen, the Athenians possibly took the radical step of extending citizenship to thousands of slaves who rowed with the fleet. Over a hundred ships were prepared and manned through these measures, and contributions from allied ships raised the fleet&#x27;s size to 150 triremes after it reached Samos. In a highly unorthodox arrangement, the fleet was commanded collaboratively by eight generals: Aristocrates, Aristogenes, Diomedon, Erasinides, Lysias, Pericles, Protomachus and Thrasyllus.

After leaving Samos, the Athenian fleet sailed to the Arginusae islands, opposite Cape Malea on Lesbos, where they camped for an evening. Callicratidas, who had sailed south to Malea with most of his fleet upon learning of the Athenians&#x27; movements, spotted their signal fires and planned to attack them by night but was prevented from doing so by a thunderstorm and so he was forced to delay his attack until morning.

== Battle ==
At dawn the next day, Callicratidas led his fleet out to meet the Athenians. He had 140 ships to match the Athenians&#x27; 150 and had left 50 to watch Conon at Mytilene. For the first time in the war, the Spartan crews and commanders were more experienced than their Athenian opposites, as the Athenians&#x27; best crews had been at sea with Conon. To counter the Spartans&#x27; superior skill and maneuverability, the Athenian commanders implemented several new and innovative tactics. Firstly, the Athenian fleet was divided into eight autonomous divisions, each commanded by one of the generals. Secondly, they arranged their fleet in a double line, instead of the traditional single line, to prevent the Spartans from using the maneuver known as the &quot;diekplous&quot; in which a trireme raced into a gap between two enemy ships and then wheeled to strike one of them in the side. If the Spartans attempted that against a double line, a ship from the second line could move up to attack the Spartan ship.

As the Athenians advanced, they extended their left flank out to sea, outflanking the Spartans. The superior Athenian numbers, combined with the tactics they had implemented, created a dangerous situation for the Spartans, and Callicratidas&#x27;s helmsman advised him to retire without a fight, but the navarch insisted on pushing on. Dividing his force into two to meet the threat of encirclement, Callicratidas led his fleet into battle. Heated fighting ensued for some time, but eventually, Callicratidas, leading the Spartan right, was killed when his ship rammed an opposing ship, and resistance on the right collapsed. The left continued to resist for longer but was unable to stand up to the entire Athenian fleet and soon joined the right wing in flight. All told, the Spartans lost some 70 ships and the Athenians 25.

== Aftermath ==
In the immediate aftermath of the battle, the Athenian commanders had to decide on which of several pressing tasks to focus their attention. Conon was still blockaded at Mytilene by 50 Spartan ships, and decisive action against those ships could lead to their destruction before they had a chance to join the remainder of Callicratidas&#x27; fleet. At the same time, however, the survivors from the 25 Athenian ships that had been sunk or disabled in the battle remained afloat off the Arginusae islands. To address both of these concerns, the generals decided that all eight of them would sail with the majority of the fleet to Mytilene, where they would attempt to relieve Conon, and the trierarchs Thrasybulus and Theramenes would remain behind with a smaller detachment to rescue the survivors. Both missions, however, were thwarted by the sudden arrival of a storm, which drove the ships back into port. The Spartan fleet at Mytilene escaped, and rescuing the drowning sailors proved impossible.

=== Trial of generals ===

At Athens, the public relief at this unexpected victory was quickly subsumed in a bitter rhetorical battle over who was responsible for the failure to rescue the sailors. When the generals learned that the public was angry over the failed rescue, they assumed that Thrasybulus and Theramenes, who had already returned to the city, were responsible, and accordingly, they wrote letters to the assembly denouncing the two trierarchs and blaming them for the disaster. The trierarchs responded successfully to the allegations brought against them, and public anger now turned against the generals instead. The eight generals were deposed from their office and ordered to return to Athens to stand trial; two of them, Aristogenes and Protomachus, fled, but the other six returned. Upon their return, they were imprisoned, and one of them, Erasinides, was brought to trial and convicted of several charges involving misconduct in office; this trial may represent an attempt by the generals&#x27; enemies to test the wind since Erasinides, who had proposed abandoning the survivors altogether during the deliberations after the battle, may have been the easiest target among the six.

The question of how the generals should be tried for their failure to rescue the survivors was then brought before the assembly. On the first day of debate, the generals won the sympathy of the crowd by placing the blame for the tragedy entirely on the storm that had thwarted the rescue attempts. Unfortunately for them, however, the first day of debate was followed by the festival of the &quot;Apaturia&quot; at which families met together. In this context, the absence of those drowned at Arginusae was painfully evident, and when the assembly next met, the initiative passed to those who wished to treat the generals harshly. A politician named Callixeinus proposed that without further debate, the assembly should vote on the guilt or innocence of the generals. Euryptolemus, a cousin of Alcibiades and several others opposed the motion on the grounds that it was unconstitutional, but they withdrew their opposition after another politician moved for the same penalty applied to the generals to be applied to them. With the opposition from the floor now silenced, the generals&#x27; accusers sought to bring their motion to a vote.

The presiding officers of the assembly were the &quot;prytaneis&quot;, randomly-selected councilmen from the tribe that was assigned to oversee the assembly in a given month. At each meeting of the assembly, one of the &quot;prytaneis&quot; was appointed &quot;epistates&quot;, or president of the assembly. By chance, the philosopher Socrates, holding public office for the only time in his life, was &quot;epistates&quot; on the day that the generals were tried. Declaring that he would &quot;do nothing that was contrary to the law&quot;, Socrates refused to put the measure to a vote. Emboldened, Euryptolemus rose again to speak and persuaded the assembly to pass a motion ordering that the generals be tried separately. Parliamentary maneuvering, however, undid the victory, and in the end, the original motion was carried. A vote was taken, and all six generals were found guilty and executed, including Pericles the Younger. The Athenians soon came to regret their decision in the case of the generals, and charges were brought against the principal instigators of the executions. The men escaped before they could be brought to trial, but Callixeinus returned to Athens several years later. Despised by his fellow citizens, he died of starvation.

=== Peace offer ===
At Sparta, the defeat at Arginusae added to a long list of setbacks since the war in the Aegean had begun in 412 BC. The fleet, now stationed at Chios, was in poor condition, Spartans at home were discouraged and supporters of Callicratidas were displeased by the notion that his rival Lysander would rise to power again if the war were to continue (Sparta&#x27;s allies in the Aegean were demanding his return). With all of those concerns in mind, the Spartan government dispatched an embassy to Athens, offering to surrender the Spartan fort at Decelea in return for peace on the basis of the status quo in the Aegean. The proposal, however, was rejected by the Athenian assembly at the urging of Cleophon. The war continued, but Athens&#x27;s decision was to prove costly less than a year later when Lysander, in command of the Spartan fleet once more, decisively defeated the Athenian fleet at Aegospotami. Within two years of the dramatic Athenian victory at Arginusae, the city of Athens surrendered, and its walls were torn down.

<doc id="595015" wikidata="Q4630979" url="?curid=595015" title="21 (drinking game)">
<text>21, Bagram, or Twenty Plus One is a drinking game. The game progresses by counting up from 1 to 21, with the player who calls &quot;21&quot; suffering a drinking penalty before the next round starts. The loser may add 1 new rule to the game, and starts the new round.

This was created in the Swan and 3 Cygnets pub in Durham City by Alan Smith, Ian Crosby, Stephen Rickaby, Andrew Barras, Paul Nicholson, Kieran Walker, Gavin Southwell, Mark Thompson, Brian Griffin, and Paul Jones. 

==Rules==
Players are arranged in a circle, facing inwards. The game begins with one player calling the direction of play by saying, &quot;I propose a game of XXXX! To my left...&quot; or &quot;To my right...&quot; followed by a sequential series of numbers beginning with one. Variations exist for the proposal of the game depending on personal rules; this is due to some variants calling for &quot;any&quot; person who says the number &quot;21&quot; to drink. For example:
* &quot;I propose a game of 21!&quot;
* &quot;I propose a game of 20...22!&quot;
* &quot;I propose a game of twenty plus one!&quot;
* &quot;I propose a game of the unspeakable number!&quot;

As the game progresses, each player in turn must recite one to four numbers, counting in sequence from where the previous player left off:
* Saying one number (e.g. &quot;one&quot;) passes the game to the next player in the circle in the initial direction.
* Saying two numbers (e.g. &quot;one, two&quot;) passes to the next player, but reverses direction.
* Saying three numbers (e.g. &quot;one, two, three&quot;) passes in the initial direction, but skips a player.
* Saying four numbers (e.g. &quot;one, two, three, four&quot;) reverses direction and skips a player. 

If a player makes a mistake, then they suffer a small to moderate drinking penalty (e.g. 2 fingers of drink) and then restart the game from 1. Mistakes include:
* Hesitating to continue the game.
* Calling the wrong number.
* Calling a number out of turn.
* Breaching any original or instated rule.

Assuming there are no mistakes, the game will continue in sequence up to 21. The player who calls 21 suffers a heavy drinking penalty (e.g. finishing their drink), creates a new rule, then restarts the game from 1.

==Additional rules==

Variations on the standard rules include:
* Prohibiting three players calling single numbers in a row.
* &quot;Doubling a double&quot; - prohibits saying two numbers after two numbers.
* &quot;Tripling a triple&quot; - prohibits either saying three numbers after three numbers, or after 2 sets of three numbers.
* &quot;Reversing into a hole&quot; - prohibits saying two numbers after three numbers.
* Prohibiting calling out a series of numbers that sum to 21 (e.g. &quot;6, 7, 8&quot; or &quot;10, 11&quot;)

Examples of new rules that could be instated by a player forced to call 21:
* Swapping two numbers around (e.g. 3 and 13 are switched)
* Replacing a number with a humorous phrase (e.g. replacing 5 with &quot;skin&quot; - causing the sequence 1, 2, 3, &quot;foreskin&quot;)
* Instating an underlying set of rules (e.g. left hand drinking)
* Thumb master - the last player to place their thumb on the table following the thumb master must drink.
* Head master - as with thumb master, but replacing the thumb with the head
* Pose master - the last player to strike a pose following the pose master must drink.

It is also commonplace to declare (either at the start of the game or as an additional rule) that the game be played according to the so-called &quot;International Drinking Rules&quot;. These are a body of generally accepted but not entirely uniform rules that players understand to apply to all drinking activity and include rules for example, that drinkers must keep their little finger up whilst drinking, only drink with their left hand and, in some circles, that using the word &quot;drink&quot; be prohibited and replaced with words such as &quot;consume&quot; or &quot;imbibe&quot;.

==Example==

Andy, Bill, Cath, Dan, Ed and Fran are sitting with Andy at 12 o&#x27;clock, and the other players arranged clockwise in alphabetical order: 

# Andy: I propose a game of 21! To my left: 1, 2. {play called to the left, but reversed immediately → Fran}
# Fran: 3. {→ Ed}
# Ed: 4, 5, 6 {skips Dan → Cath}
# Cath: 7, 8 {Cath violates the additional rule &quot;reversing into a hole&quot;! She is penalised 2 fingers of drink.
# Cath drinks
# Cath: I propose a game of 21! To my right: 1. {→ Bill}
# Bill: 2. {→ Andy}

The game ultimately finishes when all the numbers have been replaced, by rule changes instigated by the person who drinks on 21.

==Variations==
* Using Roman numerals. Replacing the Roman numerals with other humorous or explicit phrases can make the game more interesting (e.g. replace I with &quot;No&quot;, V with &quot;Daddy&quot; and X with &quot;Don&#x27;t touch me!&quot;)
* Using the binary number system.
* Replacing numbers with themed sets of phrases.

Rules for these variants are widely varied.

<doc id="595016" wikidata="Q29625928" url="?curid=595016" title="Hillman Minx">
<text>The Hillman Minx was a mid-sized family car that British car maker Hillman produced from 1931 to 1970. There were many versions of the Minx over that period, as well as badge engineered variants sold by Humber, Singer, and Sunbeam.

From the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, the Minx and its derivatives were the greatest-volume sellers of the &quot;Audax&quot; family of cars from Rootes, which also included the Singer Gazelle and Sunbeam Rapier. The final version of the Minx was the &quot;New Minx&quot; launched in 1967, which was part of the &quot;Arrow&quot; family and essentially a basic version of the Hillman Hunter. Generally, the Minx was available in four-door saloon and estate forms, with a 1496-cc engine.

The Hillman Super Minx was a slightly larger model offered during the Audax era.

Throughout the life of the Minx, there was usually an estate version—and, from 1954 to 1965, a short-wheelbase estate, the Hillman Husky, and a van derivative known as the Commer Cob.

The Minx model name was revived briefly – along with the &quot;Rapier&quot; name, as applied to the Sunbeam Rapier version of the Audax family – as a special edition late in the life of the Talbot Alpine / Talbot Solara cars, produced by Chrysler Europe after its takeover of the Rootes Group.
==Pre-WWII Minx==
The original Minx was announced to the public 1 October 1931. It was straightforward and conventional with a pressed-steel body on separate chassis and 30 bhp 1185 cc engine producing &quot;cushioned power&quot;. It was upgraded with a four-speed transmission in 1934 and a styling upgrade, most noticeably a slightly V-shaped grille. For 1935 the range was similar except that synchromesh was added to all forward gears and this Minx became the first mass-produced car with an all-synchromesh gearbox. it was designed by Rootes&#x27; technical director Captain John Samuel Irving (1880-1953), designer of Sunbeam aero engines and Sunbeam&#x27;s Golden Arrow&#x27; in conjunction with Alfred Herbert Wilde (1891–1930), recently chief engineer of Standard and designer of the Standard Nine.

The 1936 model had a new name, the Minx Magnificent, and a restyle with a much more rounded body. The chassis was stiffened and the engine moved forwards to give more passenger room. The rear panel, previously vertical, was now set at a sloping angle, and the manufacturers offered the option of a folding luggage grid attached to the rear panel for &quot;two pounds, seven shillings and sixpence&quot; (slightly under £2.40) painted. A Commer-badged estate car was added to the range.

The final pre-war model was the 1938 Minx. There were no more factory-built tourers but some were made by Carbodies. The car was visually similar to the Magnificent, with a different grille, and access to the luggage boot (trunk) was external (that on the predecessor was accessed by folding down the rear seat). There were two saloon models in the range, the basic &quot;Safety&quot; model with simple rexine trim instead of leather, no opening front quarter lights, and less luxurious trim levels. The De Luxe model had leather trim, opening quarter lights, extra trim pads, and various other comfort benefits. The 1938 model was not the final iteration before the outbreak of war, however, as the 1939 model was considerably different mechanically, with virtually the entire drivetrain improved to the extent that few parts are interchangeable with the 1938 model. This includes gearbox, differential, half shafts, steering box, and a great many other mechanical and cosmetic changes. Even the front grille, which to the casual eye looks almost identical to the 1938 model, became a pressed alloy component rather than a composite.

==Wartime Minx==

During the Second World War, British car companies produced simple Utility load carriers, the &quot;Car, Light Utility&quot; or &quot;Tilly&quot; which was later developed into the experimental Hillman Gnat. For Hillman it was the Hillman 10HP, a Minx chassis with a two-person cab and covered load area behind. The basic saloon was also produced for military and essential civilian use from 1940 to 1944.

==Minx Mark I to VIII (1945–1957)==

The Minx sold between 1945 and 1947 had the same 1185 cc side-valve engine, the same wheelbase and virtually the same shape as the prewar Minx. This postwar Minx became known as the Minx Mark I (or Minx Phase I). This was the first Minx with a protruding boot (trunk) that nodded to the Ponton, three-box design by then replacing the &#x27;flat back&#x27; look, inherited from models that had debuted in the 1930s. Between 1947 and 1948, Hillman offered a modified version they called the Minx Mark II.

A much more modern-looking Minx, the Mark III, was sold from 1948. Three different body styles were offered initially, these being saloon, estate car and drophead coupé (convertible). Beneath the metal, however, and apart from updated front suspension, little had changed: the Mark III retained the 1185 cc side-valve engine of its predecessor. Claimed power output, at , was also unchanged. However, in 1949 the old engine was bored out and compression ratio increased, for the Minx Mark IV, to 1265 cc, and power output increased by 7 per cent to . A Mark IV saloon tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; magazine in 1949 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 39.7 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £505 including taxes, the price including radio (£36), over-riders (£5) and heater (£18).

The Mark V, introduced in 1951, featured side chromium trim and a floor-mounted handbrake.

The Mark VI of 1953 featured a new grille, revised combustion chambers and a two-spoke steering wheel. A fourth body variation was added, badged as the Hillman Minx Californian, a two-door hard-top coupé with, slightly unusually, a b-pillar that wound down out of sight along with the rear side window to give an unbroken window line when all windows were fully opened: the rear window assembly was of a three-piece wrap-around form. The wheelbase and overall length of the car remained the same as those of the four-door saloon and convertible permutations. The Mark VII, also introduced in 1953, featured longer rear mudguards and a bigger boot. For the Mark VIII, in 1954, a new ohv 1390 cc engine was installed. This engine, two years later, went into the first of the new &quot;Audax series&quot; Minxes.

For a short time in the early 1950s, Hillman Minxes were sold in the US to Americans seeking better gas mileage. American reviews of the vehicle were lukewarm. 

The Mark VI to Mark VIII was produced in Japan by Isuzu between 1953 and 1956, as the Isuzu Hillman Minx, prior to their 1961 introduction of the Bellel. 

A 2-door coupé utility variant of the Minx Mark VIII was produced by Rootes Australia as the &quot;Hillman de luxe Utility&quot;, circa 1956.

==Audax design Hillman Minx (Series I to Series VI, 1956–1967)==

The Audax body was designed by the Rootes Group, but helped by the Raymond Loewy design organisation, who were involved in the design of Studebaker coupés in 1953. Announced in May 1956 the car went through a succession of annual facelifts each given a series number, replacing the mark number used on the previous Minxes. The Series I, introduced in 1956, was followed by the Series II in 1957, the Series III in 1958, the Series IIIA in 1959, the Series IIIB in 1960, the Series IIIC in 1961, the Series V in 1963 and the Series VI in 1965. There was no Series IV. Over the years the engine was increased in capacity from 1390 cc (in the Series I and II) to 1725 cc in the Series VI. A variety of manual transmissions, with column or floor change, and automatic transmissions were offered. For the automatic version, the Series I and Series II used a Lockheed Manumatic two-pedal system (really only a semi-automatic), the Series III a Smiths Easidrive, which was the first production dual-clutch transmission, while the V/VI a Borg Warner. The Series VI was fitted with an all-synchromesh gearbox.

A Series III deLuxe saloon with 1494 cc engine tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1958 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 25.4 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £794 including taxes of £265.

There were Singer Gazelle and Sunbeam Rapier variants of all these Hillman Minx models and the names were again used on derivatives in the later Rootes Arrow range. Some models were re-badged in certain markets, with the Sunbeam and Humber marques used for some exports.

The New Zealand importer/assembler Todd Motors created the Humber 80 and Humber 90, badge-engineered models based respectively on the Minx and Super Minx, to give Humber dealers a smaller car to sell alongside the locally assembled Hawk and Super Snipe. Although the 90 was identical to the Super Minx apart from badging, the cheaper 80 featured a horizontal bar grille design. The Humber 80 was acknowledged in the 1980s Roger Hall play &quot;Prisoners of Mother England&quot;, in which a newly arrived immigrant in New Zealand spots one and exclaims: &quot;Humber 80? There&#x27;s no such car!&quot;

In Australia, a Series Va model was released in 1965. It was fitted with a more powerful 1592cc engine and the all-synchromesh gearbox destined for the forthcoming Series VI model.

The Audax Minx was also built in Japan by Isuzu Motors as the Isuzu Hillman Minx, under licence from Rootes, between September 1956 and June 1964. Isuzu produced their own unique estate car version, the Isuzu Hillman Express, from 1958 to 1964.

==Super Minx (1961–1967)==
Launched late in 1961, the Hillman Super Minx was intended at one stage to replace the Minx Series III. In the event the Series III would be replaced in 1963 by the Series V, while the Super Minx was launched as a separate, albeit closely related, model.

==New Minx (1967–1970)==
A replacement Minx (sometimes identified, retrospectively, as the New Minx) took over from the Series VI in 1967. It was a reduced specification version of the Hillman Hunter. Saloon and estate versions were produced, initially equipped with a 54 bhp 1496 cc 4 cylinder engine. A 61 bhp 1725cc engine became available in 1968. The final Minx was replaced by a Hillman Hunter De Luxe model in 1970.

<text>In the field of molecular biology, the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors (PPARs) are a group of nuclear receptor proteins that function as transcription factors regulating the expression of genes. PPARs play essential roles in the regulation of cellular differentiation, development, and metabolism (carbohydrate, lipid, protein), and tumorigenesis of higher organisms.

== Nomenclature and tissue distribution ==

Three types of PPARs have been identified: alpha, gamma, and delta (beta):
* α (alpha) - expressed in liver, kidney, heart, muscle, adipose tissue, and others
* β/δ (beta/delta) - expressed in many tissues, especially in brain, adipose tissue, and skin
* γ (gamma) - although transcribed by the same gene, this PPAR, by way of alternative splicing, is expressed in three forms:
** γ1 - expressed in virtually all tissues, including heart, muscle, colon, kidney, pancreas, and spleen
** γ2 - expressed mainly in adipose tissue; it is 30 amino acids longer than γ1
** γ3 - expressed in macrophages, large intestine, white adipose tissue

=== History ===
These agents, pharmacologically related to the fibrates were discovered in the early 1980s.

PPARs were originally identified in &quot;Xenopus&quot; frogs as receptors that induce the proliferation of peroxisomes in cells in 1992.
The first PPAR (PPARα) was discovered in 1990 during the search for a molecular target of a group of agents then referred to as &quot;peroxisome proliferators&quot;, as they increased peroxisomal numbers in rodent liver tissue, apart from improving insulin sensitivity. 

When it turned out that PPARs played a much more versatile role in biology, the agents were in turn termed &quot;PPAR ligands&quot;. The best-known PPAR ligands are the thiazolidinediones.

After PPARδ (delta) was identified in humans in 1992, it turned out to be closely related to PPARβ (beta), previously described during the same year in an amphibian, &quot;Xenopus&quot;. The term &quot;PPARδ&quot; is generally used in the US, whereas the use of &quot;PPARβ&quot; has remained in Europe, where this receptor was initially discovered in &quot;Xenopus&quot;.

PPARs were so-named because they were discovered to induce peroxisome proliferation in rodents, but this induction of peroxisome proliferation is not believed to occur in humans.

== Physiological function ==
All PPARs heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and bind to specific regions on the DNA of target genes. These DNA sequences are termed PPREs (peroxisome proliferator hormone response elements). The DNA consensus sequence is AGGTCANAGGTCA, with N being any nucleotide. In general, this sequence occurs in the promoter region of a gene, and, when the &quot;PPAR&quot; binds its ligand, transcription of target genes is increased or decreased, depending on the gene. The RXR also forms a heterodimer with a number of other receptors (e.g., vitamin D and thyroid hormone).

The function of PPARs is modified by the precise shape of their ligand-binding domain (see below) induced by ligand binding and by a number of coactivator and corepressor proteins, the presence of which can stimulate or inhibit receptor function, respectively.

Endogenous ligands for the PPARs include free fatty acids, eicosanoids and Vitamin B3. PPARγ is activated by PGJ2 (a prostaglandin) and certain members of the 5-HETE family of arachidonic acid metabolites including 5-oxo-15(S)-HETE and 5-oxo-ETE. In contrast, PPARα is activated by leukotriene B4. Certain members of the 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid family of arachidonic acid metabolites, including 15(S)-HETE, 15(R)-HETE, and 15-HpETE activate to varying degrees PPAR alpha, beta/delta, and gamma. In addition, PPARγ was reported to be involved in cancer pathogenesis and growth. PPARγ activation by agonist RS5444 may inhibit anaplastic thyroid cancer growth. See for a review and critique of the roles of PPAR gamma in cancer.

== Genetics ==
The three main forms of PPAR are transcribed from different genes:
* PPARα - chromosome 22q12-13.1 (OMIM 170998)
* PPARβ/δ - chromosome 6p21.2-21.1 (OMIM 600409)
* PPARγ - chromosome 3p25 (OMIM 601487).

Hereditary disorders of all 3 of these PPARs have been described, generally leading to a loss in function and concomitant lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and/or acanthosis nigricans. Of PPARγ, a gain-of-function mutation has been described and studied: Pro12Ala, which decreases the risk of insulin resistance. It is quite prevalent, with an allele frequency of 0.03 - 0.12 in some populations. In contrast, pro115gln is associated with obesity. Certain other polymorphisms in PPAR show a high incidence in populations with elevated body mass indexes.

== Structure ==
Like other nuclear receptors, PPARs are modular in structure and contain the following functional domains:
* (A/B) - N-terminal region
* (C) &quot;DBD&quot; - DNA-binding domain
* (D) - flexible hinge region
* (E) &quot;LBD&quot; - ligand binding domain
* (F) C-terminal region

The DBD contains two zinc finger motifs, which bind to specific sequences of DNA known as hormone response elements when the receptor is activated.

The LBD has an extensive secondary structure consisting of 13 alpha helices and a beta sheet. Both natural and synthetic ligands can bind to the LBD, either activating or repressing the receptor&#x27;s activity.

== Pharmacology and PPAR modulators ==

PPARα and PPARγ are the molecular targets of a number of marketed drugs. 

For instance the hypolipidemic fibrates activate PPARα.

The anti diabetic thiazolidinediones activate PPARγ. 

The synthetic chemical perfluorooctanoic acid activates PPARα while perfluorononanoic acid activates both PPARα and PPARγ. 

Berberine inactivates PPARγ. &lt;/ref&gt;

Other natural compounds from different chemical classes activate or inactivate PPARγ.

<text>In law, an acknowledgment is a declaration or avowal of one&#x27;s own act, used to authenticate legal instruments, which may give the instrument legal validity, and works to prevent the recording of false instruments or fraudulent executions. Acknowledgment involves a public official, frequently a notary public. The party executing the legal instrument orally declares that the instrument is his or her act or deed, and the official prepares a certificate attesting to the declaration. &quot;Acknowledgments&quot; are distinct from &quot;jurats&quot;, &quot;verifications&quot;, and &quot;attestations&quot;. A jurat differs from an acknowledgment in that a jurat lacks the statement that the instrument is the act or deed of the party executing it. A verification is distinct in that it seeks to verify the factual contents of the instrument, rather than the instrument itself. Finally, an attestation occurs where a third person gives his or her name as a witness to the actual execution of an instrument. Normally, acknowledgments only serve evidentiary purposes, but some jurisdictions have made acknowledgment a requirement for recording of instruments.

<doc id="595035" wikidata="Q3041697" url="?curid=595035" title="Dusty Baker">
<text>Johnnie B &quot;Dusty&quot; Baker Jr. (born June 15, 1949) is an American retired professional baseball outfielder and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for 19 seasons with the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants, and Oakland Athletics. During his Dodgers tenure, he was a two-time All-Star, won two Silver Slugger Awards and a Gold Glove Award, and became the first NLCS MVP, which he received during the 1977 National League Championship Series. He also made three World Series appearances with the Dodgers, and was a member of the 1981 championship team.

After retiring as a player, Baker served as the manager of the Giants from 1993 to 2002, the Chicago Cubs from 2003 to 2006, the Cincinnati Reds from 2008 to 2013, the Washington Nationals from 2016 to 2017, and the Houston Astros from 2020 to 2023. Baker was named NL Manager of the Year three times with the Giants and won the 2022 World Series with the Astros. At age 73, he became the oldest manager to win a championship in one of the four major North American sports. He was also the first MLB manager to reach the playoffs and win a division title with five different teams, having accomplished both feats with each team he managed. Baker ranks seventh in MLB managerial wins and has the most wins among African-American managers. Following his retirement as a manager, Baker joined the Giants&#x27; front office.

==Early life==
Baker grew up in Riverside, California, as the oldest of five children. He earned the nickname &quot;Dusty&quot; from his mother because of his propensity for playing in a dirt spot in the backyard. His father worked as an Air Force sheet metal technician at Norton Air Force Base. Baker played a variety of sports growing up, describing basketball as his very first love while also playing sports such as baseball, with his father being his coach for Little League, although this did not stop the elder Baker from kicking his son off of teams because of his tantrums. When the younger Baker wanted to quit baseball and have a paper route, his father told him that he did not raise a son who was a quitter as a way to try to encourage him to spin his attitude in a positive direction. In 1963, when Dusty was 14 years old, the Baker family moved to Sacramento, where his father worked at McClellan Air Force Base. Baker grew up as a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers and described Tommy Davis as his hero, but the signing of Bobby Bonds in 1968 made him a fan of the San Francisco Giants.

Baker excelled in baseball, basketball, football, and track at Del Campo High School in Sacramento, California; and he was inducted into the Sac-Joaquin Section&#x27;s Hall of Fame class in 2010 for his play at Del Campo. He was offered a basketball scholarship by Santa Clara University. His father was so committed to his son going to college that he told scouts that his son would go to college and play either football or basketball, so they wouldn&#x27;t waste a draft pick on Baker. The one scout who saw something in Baker was Bill Wight, as he knew that Baker&#x27;s father and mother had gone through a divorce that worried Baker about being a potential burden to his parents.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Baker was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 1967 amateur draft. On June 19 of that year, the Braves tasked Hank Aaron to try to influence Baker to sign with the team, with Aaron promising to both Baker and his mother Christine that he would take care of Baker as if he was his own son while guaranteeing that Baker would be in the majors before his college class graduated. Baker decided to sign with the team to the anger of his father, who sued to nullify the contract (and the $15,000 signing bonus), which led to a decision where the State of California appointed a trustee over his finances until his 21st birthday. Baker did not speak to his father for three years.

As an outfielder, Baker played his first baseball games in the Texas League in Austin in the AA classification, playing nine games in 1967. He then played in the Western Carolinas League and the Florida State League (mostly in the former) before playing six games in the majors the following year. It was also during the year that Baker would serve in the Marine Corps Reserve as a motor transport mechanic for six years.

===Atlanta Braves (1968–1975)===

Baker made his debut as a call-up on September 7, 1968, against the Houston Astros. He went 0-for-1, and he appeared in five other games that year and collected two hits. He played in the minors for most of the next three seasons, playing just 45 games for the major league Braves during that time while batting over .300 for the Triple-A Richmond Braves in 1970 and 1971. Finally, Baker made the roster for Opening Day in 1972 to get a true start to his major league career. He played in 127 games while batting .321 (third best in the National League) with 143 hits, seventeen home runs and 76 runs batted in (RBI); he received votes for Most Valuable Player, finishing 22nd. It was during the 1970s that Baker played for the Yaquis de Obregón of the Mexican Pacific League in the offseason, stating it was the toughest league that he ever played in professionally. The following year, he would play in 159 games (a career high) and batted .288 while collecting 174 hits with 101 runs, 21 home runs, and 99 runs batted in with 24 stolen bases (the latter two were career highs). He played two further seasons with the Braves, batting over .255 in each as the center fielder, but it was a moment on April 8, 1974, that earned him a place in history. On that day Baker batted fifth in the lineup behind Hank Aaron. In the fourth inning, with Baker on deck, Aaron hit a shot to left field off Al Downing for his 715th home run to pass Babe Ruth in career home runs. After expressing a desire to be traded upon the closure of the 1975 season, Baker was traded along with Ed Goodson from the Braves to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Jerry Royster, Tom Paciorek, Lee Lacy and Jimmy Wynn on November 17, 1975.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (1976–1983)===
Many of Baker&#x27;s accomplishments as a player would come during his time with the Los Angeles Dodgers, where he spent the next eight seasons. His tenure began in 1976 with a meager .242 batting average in 112 games that saw him collect just 93 hits with 39 RBIs while suffering a problem with his stretched knee ligaments that required surgery after the season ended. However, he bounced back in 1977 by playing in 153 games that saw him bat .291 with 155 hits, thirty home runs and 86 runs batted in. It is believed that Baker played an integral part in the first-ever high five, which occurred between Baker and Dodgers teammate Glenn Burke on October 2, 1977, at Dodger Stadium, a story featured in the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary &quot;The High Five&quot; (2014), directed by Michael Jacobs. Vaunted historian and athletics instructor Dennis Pirkle disputes Baker&#x27;s origin of the high five.
Baker would see the postseason for the first time in his career as the Dodgers won the National League West that season. The Dodgers faced the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS. Baker proved key in Game 2 when he hit a grand slam in the fourth inning to break a 1–1 tie that the Dodgers won 7–1. His second and last home run of the series proved just as important, as he hit a two-run shot off Steve Carlton in the second inning of Game 4 in a game the Dodgers won 4–1 to clinch the National League pennant. In total, he went 5-of-14 (.357) while driving in eight runs. For his efforts, he was awarded the first-ever National League Championship Series (NLCS) Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. The Dodgers faced the New York Yankees in the 1977 World Series. Baker collected one home run in the series (Game 3) while going 7-for-24 (.292) with five runs batted in, but the Dodgers lost the Series in six games. In the 1978 season, he batted .262 while collecting 137 hits. The Dodgers and Phillies met up for a rematch. The result would be the same, as the Dodgers won the pennant in four games, and Baker went 7-of-15 (.467) with one run batted in. In the 1978 World Series, they met the Yankees again, with the same result for Baker and the Dodgers (complete with him hitting only one home run) as he batted .238 in the six-game loss.

Baker batted .274 in 1979 before improving in 1980 with heightened contact, as he batted .294 with 170 hits, 29 home runs, and 97 RBIs. He finished fourth in MVP voting while winning the Silver Slugger Award. The 1981 season was shortened by a strike that saw a first and second half division champion, but Baker and the Dodgers were not slowed down. He played in 103 games and batted a career-high .320 with 128 hits and 49 RBIs that saw him named to his first All-Star Game. He was also awarded the Silver Slugger Award and the Gold Glove Award while finishing seventh in MVP voting. The Dodgers won the first-half NL West title and thus were matched against the second-half champion in the Houston Astros. Baker batted .167 in the Division Series, but the Dodgers won in five games. In the Championship Series against the Montreal Expos, he batted .316 with three runs batted in as the Dodgers won in a closely contested five-game series to win their third pennant in four years. Facing the New York Yankees in the 1981 World Series, Baker batted just .167 with one run batted in, but the Dodgers won in six games to win the title. The following year, Baker batted .300 in 147 games with 171 hits, 23 home runs and 88 RBIs to make his second and final All-Star Game. He closed out his Dodgers career in 1983 by batting .260 with 138 hits; curiously, this was the first season since 1975 where he drew more walks than strikeouts (in this case walking a career-high 72 times with 59 strikeouts). In the NLCS, he batted .357 while hitting a home run for his fifth and final career postseason home run; the Dodgers lost in four games.

===San Francisco Giants (1984)===
He became a free agent after the season and signed with the San Francisco Giants for the 1984 season. He played 100 games that year and batted .292 with 71 hits and three home runs.

===Oakland Athletics (1985–1986)===
He was traded to the Oakland Athletics on March 24, 1985, for two minor league players. While he would play the outfield during his time there, he also played first base at times, playing 61 games of his tenure at the position while also serving as a designated hitter for 28 total games. He played 111 games in 1985 and batted .268 with fourteen home runs and 52 RBIs. He played sparingly for his final season in 1986 with 83 games and a .240 batting average. He appeared in his final game on October 4, 1986, against the Kansas City Royals; he went 0-for-1 with two walks before being taken out for a pinch-runner in the seventh inning. While the Athletics offered to send him down to Triple-A for the 1987 season, Baker elected for free agency instead and subsequently retired.

In a career that spanned nineteen years, Baker played in 2,039 games while collecting 1,981 hits, 242 home runs, and 1,013 runs batted in while never going on the disabled list. Baker is noted for his love of toothpicks, saying, &quot;Toothpicks are an excellent source of protein&quot; while chewing at least one every game. He also uses the toothpick as a way to deter the use of chewing tobacco, which he used as a player. In his final season of 1986, he began wearing a wristband (featuring his face), which he has continued to do as a manager; he has stated it is to help wipe perspiration off his forehead.

==Coaching career==

===San Francisco Giants (1988–1992)===
Baker was working as a stockbroker in 1987 when he received a call from Hank Aaron, Joe Morgan, and Frank Robinson to go to Dallas, Texas to try to get jobs for minority baseball players after they finished their playing careers, which came in the wake of controversial remarks by Dodgers general manager Al Campanis on April 6, 1987. While in Dallas trying to find jobs for players, Bob Kennedy, senior baseball operations executive for the San Francisco Giants, told Baker that Al Rosen, general manager of the Giants, asked to see Baker about a possible job. On the advice of his father, Baker, alongside his brother and daughter, set out to Lake Arrowhead to pray and seek guidance to decide whether he should see Rosen and possibly return to baseball. However, while checking into the hotel, Baker encountered Bob Lurie, owner of the Giants, which seemed a sign for Baker to take an opportunity, if offered. When Baker eventually met with Rosen, Rosen stated interest in having him serve as a first base coach, which differed from Baker stating interest in possibly being an assistant general manager because Rosen thought he would be better suited to manage on the field. Baker set out a goal to try and manage within five years or he would step down. Baker&#x27;s coaching career started as a first base coach for the Giants in 1988, and then he spent the following four years (1989–1992) as the hitting coach. In 1992, he managed the Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League.

==Managerial career==

===San Francisco Giants (1993–2002)===
In 1992, Giants manager Roger Craig was fired while Bob Quinn was named general manager (the week prior, Rosen resigned) by the new ownership that was led by Peter Magowan. On December 16, 1992, Baker was hired to manage the club, becoming the seventh black manager hired to manage a Major League Baseball team. He beat out four other candidates in John Wathan, Davey Lopes, Tom Trebelhorn, and Ron Gardenhire. In his first year as Giants manager, the team had acquired Barry Bonds the same month Baker was promoted. Baker 
would win the NL Manager of the Year award (until 2021, he was the only Giant to win the award), leading the team to a 103–59 record. However, it was not enough for a playoff berth. They had led the National League West by games on August 7, but they ended up losing the National League West to the Atlanta Braves. The Giants lost 12–1 on the final day of the season when a win could have forced a tiebreaking game with Atlanta for the division championship (the following year, a Wild Card was instituted in both leagues). It was the second-best record in baseball that year behind the 104–58 Atlanta Braves and 31 games better than their 72–90 finish the previous season. He was the first manager since Sparky Anderson (1970) to win 100 games as a rookie manager, and the fourth to do so. Since the Giants missed the playoffs (as only the division winners qualified before 1995), he also became the eighth and so far the last manager to lead a team to 100 wins without making it to the postseason.

His Giants went on to win division titles in 1997, and again in 2000; Baker won Manager of the Year honors in both of those years as well. He was the second person to win the award three times after Tony La Russa, and the first to do so with the same team all three times. His easy-going style of managing led to a description of him as a &quot;player&#x27;s manager&quot;, to where he learned Spanish to try to help relate to his players. It was also during his San Francisco tenure that the term &quot;Dustiny&quot; was coined by former Giants pitcher Rod Beck. However, the postseason would elude Baker and the Giants, as they fell in the NLDS in 1997 and 2000 while losing a tie-breaker game for the Wild Card spot in 1998.

In 2002, his Giants won 95 games and clinched the Wild Card by games. In the 2002 National League Division Series, they faced the Atlanta Braves. The two teams split the first four games before a pivotal Game 5 in Atlanta, which the Giants won 3–1 to deliver their first postseason series victory since 1989. The Giants faced the St. Louis Cardinals (who had beaten the Arizona Diamondbacks, the defending champions) in the 2002 National League Championship Series. The Giants won the series in five games for their first pennant in thirteen years, winning on a walk-off single by Kenny Lofton. They advanced to the World Series against the Anaheim Angels, who were managed by his former Dodger teammate Mike Scioscia. The teams split the first two games in Anaheim before going to San Francisco. In Game 3, they were routed 10–4, but the Giants responded with a narrow 4–3 victory in Game 4 before a big win in Game 5 by a score of 16–4. The Giants were one victory away from the championship and had two games in Anaheim to do so. The Giants struck first in Game 6, scoring three runs in the fifth inning before adding runs in the sixth and seventh innings to make it 5–0. However, the seventh would start the unraveling of the game; in the inning, starting pitcher Russ Ortiz (who had 98 pitches) allowed consecutive singles after getting one out before Baker pulled him out for Félix Rodríguez. Scott Spiezio came up to the plate and soon hit a shot to right field to narrow the score to 5–3. In the next inning, Darin Erstad hit a leadoff line-drive shot for a home run before Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson hit singles that made Baker put in Robb Nen (battling a shoulder injury for most of the year) to try and close out the inning without allowing more runs. However, a double by Troy Glaus scored the runners to give the Angels a lead they would not relinquish. The five-run deficit was the largest comeback in an elimination game in the World Series. While the Giants scored first in Game 7, the Angels scored three runs in the third inning to build a cushion on their way to a 4–1 victory.

Despite Baker&#x27;s success in San Francisco, he had an increasingly strained relationship with owner Peter Magowan, one that even the Giants&#x27; first pennant in 13 years could not mend. The Giants did not renew his contract after the season, letting him leave to manage the Chicago Cubs and hiring Felipe Alou to replace him. Baker finished his tenure with a record of 840 wins and 715 losses in the regular season and 11 wins and 13 losses in the post-season.

To date, Baker is one of only four African Americans to manage a World Series team. Cito Gaston was the first, managing the Toronto Blue Jays to championships in 1992 and 1993. Baker was the second, and Ron Washington and Dave Roberts have since joined Gaston and Baker by managing the Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Dodgers, respectively, to the World Series, with Roberts winning a championship in 2020. Baker left as the all-time winningest manager in the San Francisco era of Giants history; Bruce Bochy would later eclipse him alongside managing the Giants to World Series titles in 2010, 2012, and 2014.

===Chicago Cubs (2003–2006)===
It was speculated that Baker would be hired by the Chicago Cubs as soon as he was let go from the Giants. Cubs general manager Jim Hendry interviewed several managers for their open position such as Bob Melvin, Ken Macha, Buck Showalter and Fredi Gonzalez, but Hendry went with his first name in mind with Baker. On November 15, 2002, he was hired by the Chicago Cubs to a four-year deal to manage the team, replacing Bruce Kimm, who had taken over when Don Baylor was fired in the middle of the third 90-loss season in four years.

Baker would make a major impact in his first season as manager for the Cubs in 2003. In July of that year, Baker was the subject of some controversy when he stated that &quot;black and Hispanic players are better suited to playing in the sun and heat than white players.&quot; Baker, defending his beliefs, later said, &quot;What I meant is that blacks and Latinos take the heat better than most whites, and whites take the cold better than most blacks and Latinos. That&#x27;s it, pure and simple. Nothing deeper than that.&quot; With the help of an impressive pitching staff and big gun batters such as Sammy Sosa and Moisés Alou, the Cubs claimed their first division title in fourteen years. Baker led the Cubs to victory over the Atlanta Braves in the National League Division Series, the first postseason series victory for the team since the 1908 World Series. However, the hopes for the Cubs winning a World Series title were cut short during the 2003 National League Championship Series against the Florida Marlins. In Game 6, with Chicago, five outs away from the pennant and holding a 3–0 lead, the infamous Steve Bartman foul ball incident near the fans in left field would unravel the Cubs and derail the chance for their first World Series appearance in 58 years. The Bartman incident proved to be a distraction for fans and the media, but it was critical execution failures by the Cubs such as a wild pitch on a ball four, a fielding error on a potential inning-ending double play, and a bad throw from the outfield after a Marlins hit, which allowed the Marlins to score eight runs in that eighth inning to win the game 8–3; Cubs player Doug Glanville also stated that the loss in Game 5 (where Josh Beckett threw a two-hit shutout) was the true turning point of the series. The Marlins would go on to win Game 7 at Wrigley Field on their way to winning the 2003 World Series.

In 2004, the team was involved in a heated wild card chase with the Houston Astros but fell out of contention near the season&#x27;s end, losing six of their last eight games and missing the playoffs by three games. He also received criticism from television analyst Steve Stone, who blamed Baker for his players harassing him at team charters and hotels, which Baker waved off as being &quot;grown men&quot;. On August 30, Baker won his 1,000th game as manager with a win over the Montreal Expos, doing so in his 1,848th game.

In 2005, the Cubs lost several of their key players, most notably ace pitchers Mark Prior and Kerry Wood, to injuries. The team finished the season with a 79–83 record, marking the first time in three years that the Cubs finished with a losing record. The Cubs’ performance continued to decline in 2006 as they fell to 66–96 and finished last in the entire National League. Baker, an old-school baseball traditionalist, was scrutinized for the Cubs&#x27; declining productivity. Baker has said that putting men on base can be unimportant and merely &quot;clogging up the bases.&quot; This position has made Baker a target among the sabermetric community. It was around this time that Baker came under scrutiny for his tendency to overuse pitchers, such as with Kerry Wood and Mark Prior. Wood and Prior suffered serious arm injuries following their first full seasons under Baker. Wood and Prior averaged 122 and 126 pitches per start, respectively, in their final six regular-season starts of 2003. However, the only season where Wood was used for a full season under Baker&#x27;s tenure was in 2003, in which he pitched 211 innings, which was two innings more than he had pitched in 2002. In the next three seasons, Wood would only pitch a combined total of 226 innings due to injuries before the Cubs decided to try him as a reliever after 2006. Additionally, Wood and Prior have been quoted as not blaming Baker for what happened with his career, with Prior stating that he had to balance pitcher use with the decisions required to try and help the Cubs win games. Prior also cited him as an inspiration to stay in the game after he retired from pitching, with Baker describing baseball as a relationship.

A month after the 2006 season ended, the Cubs declined to renew Baker&#x27;s contract. They allowed Baker to address the media in a press conference in early October, where he officially announced his departure. The Cubs turned to Lou Piniella to replace Baker for the 2007 season. Baker finished his tenure with a regular-season record of 322 wins and 326 losses and a postseason record of six wins and six losses.

===Cincinnati Reds (2008–2013)===

On October 13, 2007, Baker was hired as manager of the Cincinnati Reds, replacing interim manager Pete Mackanin. He was the first black manager in Cincinnati Reds history; the Reds hired Baker on the heels of having fired Jerry Narron after another losing season (Baker became the fifth Reds manager since the year of 2003), with Baker being the first Reds manager hired with no prior ties to the organization since 1990. Baker and the Reds finished 74–88 and 78–84 in 2008 and 2009, finishing 5th and 4th in the NL Central. In 2010, the Reds enjoyed success as one of baseball&#x27;s breakout teams (which included first baseman Joey Votto being named Most Valuable Player of the National League), and on September 28, 2010, the Reds won the Central title. This championship led to their first playoff appearance in 15 years. However, the appearance was short-lived as the Reds were swept by the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS. Baker signed a two-year contract extension with the Reds on October 4, 2010.

The Reds won 97 games in 2012 to win the National League Central for the second time in three seasons (only the Washington Nationals won more games than the Reds that year in the NL). In September 2012, Baker stayed in a Chicago hospital for treatment of an irregular heartbeat. At the time, Baker had been dealing with a longstanding heart problem. The Reds clinched the 2012 Central Division championship in his absence, their second in three years and Baker&#x27;s fifth as a manager. In the 2012 National League Division Series, the Reds faced the San Francisco Giants. The Reds beat the Giants 5–2 and 9–0 in San Francisco to lead the series heading back to Cincinnati. Game 3 turned out to be a tight affair with the Reds on the wrong side of it, as a bobbled play by Scott Rolen led to the winning run by the Giants, and they tied the series with an 8–3 victory in Game 4. In Game 5, the Reds collapse became complete, as the Giants scored six runs in the fifth inning to win 6–4, making them the second team in NLDS history to blow a 2–0 series lead (after 1981) and the third team ever to blow a 2–0 lead in a best-of-five series. On October 15, 2012, he signed a two-year contract extension as manager of the Reds.

In 2013, the Reds won ninety games, but it was only good enough for a third-place finish in the division (the Cardinals won the division by seven games), and a five-game losing streak closed out the regular season. As such, they were the second Wild Card team and faced the division rival Pittsburgh Pirates (who won 94 games) in Wild Card game. Baker was fired by the Reds three days after the game. The Pirates, making their first postseason appearance since 1992, took the lead in the second inning and never relinquished it, cruising to a 6–2 victory. Reds general manager Walt Jocketty admitted the team&#x27;s latest collapse played a role in the decision to fire Baker. Baker finished his tenure with a regular season record of 509 wins and 463 losses and a 2–7 postseason record. he was the first full-time Reds manager to finish with a winning record since Jack McKeon and he is currently the last Reds manager to have a winning record . On October 22, 2013, he was replaced by Reds pitching coach Bryan Price.

===Washington Nationals (2016–2017)===

In the two year gap between jobs, Baker called multiple franchises looking to fill their respective vacancies, such as the Detroit Tigers, the Seattle Mariners, and the San Diego Padres, but only the latter even gave him a callback (they later hired Andy Green).

On November 3, 2015, Baker was named the new manager for the Washington Nationals for the 2016 season, his first managerial position since being fired by Cincinnati in 2013; he was hired to replace Matt Williams after a deal with Bud Black fell through. At the time of his hiring, he was the only black manager in Major League Baseball and had the second-highest total for most wins in MLB. Comments made shortly after his hire raised attention when he suggested his Washington Nationals should field more players of color as &quot;you&#x27;ve got a better chance of getting some speed with Latin and African-Americans.&quot; Baker said of the comments, &quot;I&#x27;m not being racist. That&#x27;s just how it is.&quot; The hire came with scrutiny that Baker would overuse pitchers as he was alleged to do before, but it was noted that his prior Reds teams featured players throwing fewer pitches, and some baseball writers have noted that there is no clear link between pitches thrown and injuries suffered.

The Nationals won the NL East in Baker&#x27;s first season with 95 wins (a twelve-game improvement), which was the third time the team had won the NL East in the last five seasons. However, the Nationals lost in the NLDS in five games against the Los Angeles Dodgers after losing Game 4 and Game 5 (in the latter game, the Nationals gave up four runs in the seventh inning in a 4–3 loss). The following season, Baker led the Nationals to another NL East Championship. However, their postseason was once again cut short after losing in the 2017 NLDS to the Chicago Cubs in five games. Game 5 saw the Nationals lead 4–1 by the time of the second inning, but the game turned wildly in the fifth inning with four runs that were all scored on two outs, which included multiple hits, a passed ball, an error, catcher&#x27;s interference, and a hit batter. While the Nationals tried to rally, the Cubs prevailed 9–8. The fifth game was the tenth time in fourteen years that a Baker-managed team had lost a &quot;close-out&quot; game with the opportunity to advance to the next round of the playoffs, which was a record; in both NLDS matchups, the Nationals had outscored their opponent but lost the series. On October 20, 2017, the Nationals announced that Baker and his entire coaching staff would not return as the team&#x27;s manager in 2018.

===Houston Astros (2020–2023)===

In 2020, Baker was one of three finalists for the Philadelphia Phillies job, alongside Joe Girardi and Buck Showalter, but Girardi got the job.

====2020====
On January 13, 2020, the manager&#x27;s job for the Houston Astros opened up, as A. J. Hinch was fired in the wake of the Astros sign stealing scandal. Candidates for the role included Showalter, John Gibbons, Joe Espada, and Will Venable. On January 29, Baker became the third manager to be hired after the age of 70 and first since Jack McKeon. Baker was also the first manager in the two-league era to have coached over 3,000 games in one league before managing a single game in the other, as this was his first managerial job in the American League. His contract was for one year with a club option for a second year.

On July 28, 2020 (four days after the shortened season started), the Astros picked up the 2021 option on Baker&#x27;s contract. On September 25, the Astros clinched a playoff spot as the sixth seed in the pandemic-shortened season. Baker became the first baseball manager to lead five teams to the postseason. He also became the first manager to lead a team that finished under .500 in the postseason to a series win, having beaten both the Minnesota Twins and the Oakland Athletics to reach the American League Championship Series (ALCS). It was the first time since 2003 that a Baker-led team had made the League Championship Series. The Astros lost to the Tampa Bay Rays in seven games after having come back from a 3–0 deficit. Baker&#x27;s appearance in Game 7 (a winner-take-all) was his ninth as manager, setting a new record for most appearances by a manager in a winner-take-all game, although Baker has only won two of those games.

====2021====
On April 22, 2021, Baker secured his 1,900th win as a manager in the regular season, becoming the 14th manager to do so with an 8–2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels. Four days later, he passed Gene Mauch for 13th on the all-time wins list with a 5–2 win over the Seattle Mariners. On April 30, he passed Casey Stengel for 12th all-time with a 9–2 win over the Tampa Bay Rays, the teams&#x27; first meeting since the previous year&#x27;s ALCS.

By winning the American League West division in 2021, Baker became the first manager in the major leagues to guide five different clubs to division titles. In the playoffs, the Astros first played the Chicago White Sox in the American League Division Series (ALDS). The White Sox were led by Tony La Russa, whom Baker had faced as manager over 200 times previously, and whose careers both had intertwined and spanned more than five decades. They met most frequently in games in the National League Central when La Russa managed the St. Louis Cardinals, and Baker managed the Cubs and Reds.

The Astros faced the Boston Red Sox in the American League Championship Series (ALCS) for the AL pennant. On October 22, 2021, the Astros won Game 6 of the series to clinch the pennant, doing so in a dramatic comeback where they had lost two of the first three games to the Boston Red Sox (who had hit three grand slams in Game 2 and 3 combined) before winning three in a row to advance to the World Series. The nineteen-year gap between World Series appearances is the second longest all-time among managers (with the only greater one being by Bucky Harris), and Baker became the ninth manager in major league history to win a pennant in both leagues. The Astros faced the Atlanta Braves in the Series and lost in six games.

====2022==== 
On November 5, 2021, Astros owner Jim Crane announced that Baker had agreed to a one-year extension to manage the club for the 2022 season. He had managed over 24 major league seasons. On May 3, 2022, Baker earned his 2,000th win as manager with a 4–0 victory over the Seattle Mariners at home in Minute Maid Park. Coincidentally, both Baker&#x27;s first win and his 2,000th win involved the father-son tandem of Peñas in the lineup, as Gerónimo Peña batted leadoff for the St. Louis Cardinals versus the Giants on April 6, 1993, and son Jeremy started the May 3 game as shortstop for the Astros. Baker became the twelfth manager and first African American manager to reach the milestone. Baker was named manager of the American League in the MLB All-Star Game played at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. The Astros won their 90th game of the season on September 11 versus the Angels, giving Baker a 12th season reaching that threshold in wins as manager. On September 19, the Astros clinched the AL West title, which is Baker&#x27;s ninth division title as manager. On September 24, the Astros won 11–10 over the Baltimore Orioles, their 100th of the season. It made Baker the fourth manager to have 100-win seasons in both the American and National League, as Baker had achieved the mark with the San Francisco Giants in 1993; Baker went 23 seasons between 100-win seasons, the longest for any manager to have multiple 100-win seasons. On October 2, the Astros won their 104th game, setting a new high in wins for a Baker-managed team. The Astros finished with a 2.90 ERA as a team, second best in MLB. When asked about what was necessary for good pitching, he stated, &quot;Control, control, control... Everybody talks about velocity all the time, but the velocity without command and control is no good.&quot;

In the 2022 postseason, the Astros were first matched up against the Seattle Mariners in the 2022 American League Division Series. The Mariners scored seven runs by the 7th inning of Game 1 and promptly scored two runs over the next 29 innings as the Astros rallied to win Game 1 and 2 before winning Game 3 in an eighteen-inning scoreless duel 1-0, as the Astros outscored the Mariners 13-9. It was Baker&#x27;s first-ever LDS sweep as manager, and it guaranteed the Astros a sixth straight appearance in the ALCS. In the 2022 American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees, the Astros won narrowly in Game 1, 2, and 4 (with one blowout win in Game 3) to complete a sweep, making them the third team to sweep the LDS and LCS since 1995. The Game 4 win on October 23 clinched the fourth pennant in the last six seasons for the Astros and it was Baker&#x27;s third pennant as a manager. It was his sixth postseason series victory with Houston, after having won three postseason matchups in his first 22 seasons.

The World Series would culminate a historic run for Baker and his Astros. They finished the year with an ERA of 0.83 that saw relievers allow five total earned runs, doing so with management of high-leverage players such as Bryan Abreu and Rafael Montero despite having a 1.15 regular season ERA (but high walk rate) in Ryne Stanek.
On November 3, Baker won his 50th postseason game as manager, becoming only the fourth in MLB history to do so. On November 5, the Astros defeated the National League champions, the Philadelphia Phillies, in Game 6 of the 2022 World Series, winning Baker his second World Series and first as a manager. At age 73, he is the oldest manager to win the World Series, surpassing Jack McKeon. It was his 28th postseason victory with the Astros, tying him with A. J. Hinch for most playoff wins as an Astro; the Astros went 11–2 in the postseason, becoming the fourth team in the Wild Card era (since 1995) to lose less than three times in the playoffs, and Houston never faced elimination at any point in their postseason; Baker won his first World Series title 40 years after winning one as a player, establishing a record for the longest gap between World Series championships by a player/manager in MLB history. He also became the third African-American manager to win a World Series after Cito Gaston (1992 and 1993) and Dave Roberts (2020).

====2023====
Baker passed Joe McCarthy for eighth all-time in wins on June 1, 2023, with a 5–2 victory versus the Los Angeles Angels. Baker was named manager of the American League team for the 2023 MLB All-Star Game, played at T-Mobile Park in Seattle. He invited former Dodgers teammate Billy North as an honorary coach, as well as Seattle manager Scott Servais, a former Giants teammate, to the coaching staff. On August 9, an 8–2 win over Baltimore earned Baker his 2,159th win as manager to pass Bucky Harris for sole possession of seventh place all-time. The Astros clinched the AL West on the final day of the season to mark the tenth division title won by a team managed by Baker while making him the first Astros manager to lead a team to the playoffs in four consecutive seasons. They faced the Minnesota Twins in the 2023 American League Division Series. The Astros victory in Game 1 of the ALDS gave Dusty Baker his 29th postseason win as the Astros skipper, passing A.J. Hinch to be the most winningest postseason manager in Astros history. They beat the Twins to set the Astros up for another trip to the ALCS, this time against the Texas Rangers. The ALCS would be noted for the home team losing every game that saw the Rangers rout Houston in Game 7. Baker announced his retirement on October 25, 2023, two days after the series ended.

==Executive career==
===San Francisco (2024–present)===
On January 18, 2024, Baker agreed to a third stint with the Giants in the front office, this time as a Special Advisor to Baseball Operations.

==Managerial record==


==Baseball career accomplishments==
*First manager in major league history to lead five different teams to division titles 
*Ninth manager to win both an AL pennant and an NL pennant.
*Twelfth manager and first African American manager with 2,000 victories, and first African American manager with 50 postseason victories
*Oldest manager to appear in, and win, the World Series (2022)

==Broadcasting career==
Baker served as an ESPN analyst during the 2006 MLB postseason and served in a similar role during the 2007 season. In 2015, Baker joined TBS as a studio analyst for the final two weeks of their regular season coverage and for their coverage of the National League playoffs.

==Personal life==

Baker was a member of the United States Marine Corps Reserve from 1969 through 1975. Baker&#x27;s son, Darren Baker, was rescued by J. T. Snow from being run over at home plate as a batboy during the 2002 World Series. In 2017, Darren was drafted in the 27th round of the MLB draft by the team his father managed at the time, the Washington Nationals. He decided to play as infielder for the California Golden Bears, and in 2021 he was drafted by the Nationals in the tenth round of the amateur draft, where this time he signed to join the organization. On the same day that Baker won his 2,000th game, his son Darren scored the winning run home for his High A team in Delaware on a sacrifice fly. 
Baker and his family reside in Granite Bay, California. 

In the winter of 2001, Baker was diagnosed with prostate cancer during a routine check-up (his father had been diagnosed with the disease eight years prior). Baker had had surgery in December of that year to remove his prostate (his fears over potentially having the cancer return led him to name his three-year-old son as a batboy to &quot;show him the world&quot;). Near the end of the 2012 baseball season, Baker was hospitalized for both an irregular heartbeat and a &quot;mini-stroke&quot;.

For some time, Baker had troubles with the Internal Revenue Service, who had determined that his investments in tax shelters for some years (as guided by his brother Victor) were to be disallowed, which would have resulted in penalties of at least a million dollars with interest. When managing the Giants, the IRS garnished his paychecks, leaving him with less than a percent of his $900,000 salary to live on a month; around the time of negotiating his contract in 1999, Magowan loaned him money in case he needed to deal with the IRS, which Baker repaid later. With the help of a tax crisis lawyer (over several years), the issue was resolved, roughly around the time the news was broken by the media in late 2002.

Baker is a member of the National Advisory Board for Positive Coaching Alliance, a national non-profit organization committed to providing student-athletes with a positive, character-building youth sports experience. Baker has appeared in several videos and webinars for this organization, all of which can be found on the group&#x27;s YouTube channel. Dusty is also owner of Baker Family Wines, along with owner and winemaker Chik Brenneman. Baker was inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame in 2015. He returned to the Giants organization in 2018 as a Special Advisor to the CEO.

==Legacy==
Due to his presence at various moments in baseball history, Baker has been frequently cited as baseball&#x27;s Forrest Gump equivalent. These moments include the following: 
*Baker was on the on-deck circle when Hank Aaron hit his record 715th career home run.
*Baker was in the home dugout at Dodger Stadium when Rick Monday prevented an American flag from getting burnt on the field on April 25, 1976. Monday would become teammates with Baker from the following season to the end of Baker&#x27;s Dodgers tenure in 1983.
*Baker was on the opposing Dodgers when Reggie Jackson hit three home runs in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series, earning himself the moniker of &quot;Mr. October&quot;. Jackson would join the Astros&#x27; front office in 2021, the second season of Baker&#x27;s tenure as the Astros&#x27; manager.
*Baker represented the final out of Nolan Ryan&#x27;s fifth no-hitter in 1981, surpassing Sandy Koufax for most career no-hitters.
*Baker was a coach for the Giants during the 1989 World Series, and was in San Francisco Candlestick Park with the team when the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area.
*Baker was manager of the Giants when Barry Bonds set the single-season home run record in 2001.
*Baker was manager of the Cubs when the Steve Bartman incident occurred during the 2003 National League Championship Series. Baker did not directly witness the play, as his view from Wrigley Field&#x27;s home dugout was obstructed.
*Baker was present as a manager for two of the three no-hitters thrown during the postseason. He was manager of the losing Reds when Roy Halladay threw a no-hitter against them in the 2010 National League Division Series, and he was manager of the winning Astros when they threw a no-hitter against the opposing Phillies in the 2022 World Series. 
*Baker was manager of the Nationals when Max Scherzer tied the single-game strikeout record on May 11, 2016. He had previously managed Kerry Wood, one of the players who is also tied for the record, during his Cubs tenure.

<text>Murat Reis the Elder (; 1534 – 1609) was an Ottoman privateer and admiral, who served in the Ottoman Navy. He is regarded as one of the most important Barbary corsairs.

== Early career ==
Born into an Albanian family on Rhodes in 1534 he began his career when he joined the crew of Dragut at a very young age. He also fought alongside Piri Reis in several expeditions. In 1534 Murat Reis accompanied Hayreddin Barbarossa to Constantinople where they were received by Suleiman I and appointed to take command of the Ottoman fleet. While in Constantinople, Murat Reis participated in the construction of new warships at the naval arsenal on the Golden Horn.

== Battle of Preveza ==

Murat Reis took part in all of the early naval campaigns of Turgut Reis. On September 25 and 26, 1538, he was assigned with the task of preventing the ships of the Holy League under the command of Andrea Doria from landing at Preveza, and he successfully repulsed them from the shoreline. On September 28, he took part in the main combat and played an important role in the Ottoman victory at the Battle of Preveza, where he fought along with Turgut Reis in the center-rear wing of the Ottoman fleet which had a Y-shaped battle configuration. He continued to accompany Turgut Reis until being assigned as the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Ocean fleet.

== Siege and conquest of Cyprus ==
In 1570 Murat Reis, in command of a fleet of 25 galleys, was assigned with the task of clearing the area between Crete, Rhodes and Cyprus for the build-up of the naval siege and eventual conquest of Cyprus. He was also assigned with the task of blocking the Venetian ships based in Crete from sailing to Cyprus and assisting the Venetian forces in that island. He continued to undertake this task until the eventual surrender of Famagusta, the final Venetian stronghold on the island.

== Canary Islands ==

In 1586 he led the first expedition of the Barbary corsairs in the Atlantic Ocean and captured several of the Canary Islands. During the attacks, among others he captured the Spanish governor of Lanzarote, who was later ransomed and released.

== Mediterranean campaigns ==
Murat Reis was later assigned with the task of controlling the lucrative trade routes between Egypt and Anatolia which were often raided by the Venetians, the French and the Maltese Knights. In 1609, he heard of the presence of a joint French-Maltese fleet of ten galleys, including the famous &quot;Galeona Rossa&quot;, a large galleon armed with 90 cannons which was known among the Ottomans as the &quot;Red Inferno&quot;, under the command of a knight named Fresine, off the island of Cyprus, and sailed there to engage them. After successfully striking the enemy ships with cannons from both long distance and close range, he severely damaged the &quot;Red Inferno&quot; and captured the ship. Six out of the ten French-Maltese galleys were captured, along with the 500 soldiers aboard, and the total of 160 cannons and 2000 muskets which they carried. During the battle Murat Reis was seriously injured. In 1609 he took part in the siege of Vlorë, during which he died. Per his own wishes he was buried in Rhodes, in the cemetery of the Murat Reis Mosque, which was named in his honour.

== Legacy ==
Several submarines of the Turkish Navy have been named after Murat Reis (see Oruç Reis-class submarine). One of the municipalities that form the City of Algiers, which was once the regional capital of the Ottoman Eyalet of Algeria (1517–1830), is named Bir Mourad Raïs (&quot;Murat Reis&#x27; well&quot;) in his honor.

Under the name &quot;&#x27;Morato Arráez&quot;, he is mentioned in several literary works of the Spanish Golden Age, for example by Miguel de Cervantes and Lope de Vega.

<doc id="595053" wikidata="Q224215" url="?curid=595053" title="Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany">
<text>Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany (Edward Augustus; 25 March 1739 – 17 September 1767) was a younger brother of George III of the United Kingdom and the second son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha.

==Early life==
The young prince was baptised Edward Augustus, at Norfolk House, by the Bishop of Oxford, Thomas Secker, and his godparents were his great-uncle Frederick William I of Prussia (for whom Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry stood proxy), Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (who was represented by Henry Brydges, Lord Carnarvon), and his maternal aunt Fredericka, Duchess of Saxe-Weissenfels (for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin, a daughter of the late James Douglas, 4th Duke of Hamilton, stood proxy). As a boy, Edward, with his brother, went through long hours of schooling in arithmetic, Latin, geometry, writing, religion, French, German, Greek and even dancing to be well rounded. 

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

Prince Edward showed an interest in naval affairs and sought permission to serve with the Royal Navy. He participated in the naval descents against the French coast taking part in the failed Raid on St Malo, which ended in the Battle of St. Cast in 1758.

He was promoted to captain of HMS &quot;Phoenix&quot; on 14 June 1759. He was made Rear-Admiral of the Blue in 1761, vice-admiral of the blue in 1762, and in 1766, only a year before his death, rising to the rank of Admiral of the Blue.

==Later life==

He was created Duke of York and Albany and Earl of Ulster by his paternal grandfather, George II, on 1 April 1760. When Edward&#x27;s brother ascended the throne on 25 October 1760 as George III, he named Edward a privy counsellor. From the time his brother became king and until the birth of the King&#x27;s first child, the future George IV, on 12 August 1762, the Duke was heir presumptive to the British throne.

On 27 July 1765, he was initiated into the Masonic Order.

In the late summer of 1767, on his way to Genoa, the Duke fell ill and had to be landed in the harbour of Monaco. Despite the care and attention he was given, he died in the Palace of Honoré III, Prince of Monaco, on 17 September. The state bedchamber where the ill duke died has since been known as the York Room.

After his death, his body was returned to London aboard , and is interred in Westminster Abbey.

==Legacy==
===Literature===
*In 1762, James Boswell published &quot;The Cub at Newmarket&quot;, a poem which he dedicated to Prince Edward, without getting his permission. Boswell met the Prince at the Newmarket races in 1760 during his first visit to London. The cub referenced in the work is Boswell himself. The dedication reads:
*Prince Edward is an important character in Norah Lofts&#x27; historical novel &quot;The Lost Queen&quot; (1969), chronicling the life of his youngest sister, Caroline Matilda, Queen Consort of Denmark and Norway as wife of King Christian VII. Edward is mentioned as having had a special link with her, stronger than with his other siblings. The book also depicts Edward as having planned shortly before his death to elope with a commoner woman with whom he was in love, marry her in Russia and never go back to Britain – which is not firmly attested in historical sources.

===Places and people named after Prince Edward===
*Prince Edward County, Virginia.
*Cape York, the tip of the Cape York Peninsula in Far North Queensland, is the northernmost point on the Australian continent.
*The Duke of York Islands (formerly ) in East New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea. They are found in St George&#x27;s Channel between New Britain and New Ireland islands and form part of the Bismarck Archipelago.
*Duke of York Island, the largest island of Duke of York Islands, Papua New Guinea.
*Prince Edward Augustus, fourth son of King George III, who was born the day after the Duke was buried at Westminster Abbey.
*Fort Edward, a town in New York located on the eastern side of the Hudson River which was formerly the site of a large British fort during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

<text>Occhiali (Giovanni Dionigi Galeni or &quot;Giovan Dionigi Galeni&quot;, also &quot;Uluj Ali&quot;, &quot;Reis&quot;, later &quot;Uluç Ali Paşa&quot; and finally Kılıç Ali Paşa; 1519 – 21 June 1587) was an Italian privateer and admiral who served as the commander of the Regency of Algiers and Grand Admiral (Kapudan Pasha) of the Ottoman fleet.

Born &quot;Giovanni Dionigi Galeni&quot;, he was also known by several other names in the Christian countries of the Mediterranean and in the literature also appears under various names. Miguel de Cervantes called him &quot;Uchali&quot; in chapter XXXIX of his &quot;Don Quixote de la Mancha&quot;. Elsewhere he was simply called &quot;Ali Pasha&quot;. John Wolf, in his &quot;The Barbary Coast&quot;, refers to him as &quot;Euldj Ali&quot;.

== Early life ==
Giovanni Dionigi Galeni was born to the seaman Birno Galeni and his wife Pippa de Cicco, in the village of (near modern Isola di Capo Rizzuto) in Calabria, southern Italy. His father wanted him to receive a religious education, but on 29 April 1536, when he was about 17, Giovanni was captured by Ali Ahmed, one of the corsair captains of Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha, and was forced to serve as a galley slave. As an oar slave in an Ottoman galley, he participated in the Battle of Preveza in 1538. Within a few years, he converted to Islam and became a corsair in the fleet of Turgut Reis by 1541. This was not unusual at the time as many Muslim corsairs (privateers) were captured slaves who converted to Islam.

He was a very able mariner and soon rose in the ranks, gaining sufficient prize booty to buy a share in a corsair brigantine sailing out of Algiers. Further success soon enabled him to become the captain and owner of a galley, and he gained a reputation as one of the boldest corsair reis on the Barbary Coast. Uluj Ali was in the fleet of Turgut Reis, one of the most famous corsairs in the Mediterranean, as well as an Ottoman admiral and Bey of Tripoli. Sailing with Turgut Reis, he also impressed the Ottoman admiral Piyale Pasha, with whom Turgut joined forces on a number of occasions. Due to his success in battles, the administration of the island of Samos in the Aegean Sea was awarded to him in 1550. In 1560, he was among the forces of Turgut Reis and Piyale Pasha during the Battle of Djerba. In 1565 he was promoted to the rank of Beylerbey (Chief Governor) of Alexandria. The same year he joined the Siege of Malta with the Ottoman Egyptian fleet, and when Turgut Reis was killed during the siege, Piyale Pasha appointed Uluj Ali to become Turgut&#x27;s successor as Bey of Tripoli. Uluj took Turgut&#x27;s body to Tripoli for burial, assumed control of the province, and was subsequently confirmed as Pasha of Tripoli by Sultan Suleiman I. In the following years he conducted numerous raids on the coasts of Sicily, Calabria and Naples.

== Pasha of Algiers ==

In March 1568, the vice-regency of Algiers fell vacant, and upon the recommendation of Piyale Pasha, Sultan Selim II appointed Uluj Ali to become the Pasha and Beylerbey of Algiers, the most powerful of the increasingly autonomous Ottoman eyalets in North Africa, which were governed by the corsair-admirals appointed by the Sultan. In October 1569 he turned upon the Hafsid Sultan Moulay Ahmad of Tunis, who had been restored to his throne by Spain. Marching overland with an army of some 5000, he quickly sent Hamid and his forces fleeing and made himself ruler of Tunis. Hamid found refuge in the Spanish fort at La Goulette outside Tunis.

In July 1570, while ostensibly en route to Constantinople to ask the Sultan for more ships and men in order to evict the Spaniards from all of North Africa, Uluj Ali encountered five Maltese galleys, commanded by Francisco de Sant Clement, then the captain-general of the Order&#x27;s galleys, near Cape Passaro in Sicily and captured four of them in the action of 1570. (Sant Clement escaped, but on returning to Malta was condemned, strangled and his body put in a sack and dumped into the harbor.) This victory caused Uluj to change his mind and return to Algiers in order to celebrate. There, in early 1571, he was faced with a mutiny of the janissaries who demanded overdue pay. He decided to put to sea, leaving the mutinous soldiers to take their pay from anyone they could find and rob. Having learned of the presence of a large Ottoman fleet at Coron in the Morea, he decided to join it. It was the fleet commanded by Müezzinzade Ali Pasha that was to meet disaster at Lepanto a few months later.

== Lepanto ==
On 7 October 1571, Uluj Ali commanded the left flank of Ali Pasha&#x27;s fleet in the Battle of Lepanto. He kept his squadron together in the melee, outmaneuvered his direct opponent, Giovanni Andrea Doria, and captured the flagship of the Maltese Knights with its great banner. When the Ottoman defeat became obvious, he succeeded in extricating his ships, and gathered up the scattered remaining ships of the Ottoman fleet (some forty galleys and fustas) and others along the way to Constantinople, where he arrived with 87 vessels. There he presented the great flag of the Knights of Malta to Sultan Selim II, who gave him the honorary title of &quot;Kılıç&quot; (&quot;Sword&quot;) and on 29 October 1571 appointed him as Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral) and Beylerbey of the Isles. He was subsequently known as &quot;Kılıç Ali Pasha&quot;.

== Kapudan Pasha (1572–1587) ==

Piyale Pasha and Kılıç Ali Pasha immediately began to rebuild the Ottoman fleet. Kılıç Ali Pasha placed special emphasis on the construction of a number of heavier ships modeled upon the Venetian galleasses, heavier artillery for the galleys, and firearms for the soldiers on board. In June 1572, now Kapudan Pasha, he set out with 250 galleys and a large number of smaller ships to seek revenge for Lepanto. He found the Christian fleet anchored in an inlet of Morea, but his strategy of trying to lure the enemy out and inflicting damage through repeated quick thrusts meant that a full-fledged battle never materialized because the Christian fleet was too cautious to be trapped and encircled.

In 1573 Kılıç Ali Pasha commanded the naval campaign on the coasts of Italy. In that same year, the regency of Algiers was transferred to Arab Ahmed, and Don Juan of Austria, the victor of Lepanto, recaptured Tunis. In July 1574, Kılıç Ali Pasha sailed to Tunis with a fleet of 250 galleys and a large army under the command of Cığalazade Sinan Pasha, captured the port fortress of La Goulette on 25 August 1574, and the city of Tunis on 13 September 1574. During this expedition, on 26 July 1574, the forces of Kılıç Ali Pasha constructed an Ottoman fortress on the coastline of Morocco, facing Andalusia in mainland Spain.

In 1576 he raided Calabria and in 1578 put down another mutiny of the janissaries in Algiers who had assassinated Arab Ahmed. In 1584 he commanded a naval expedition to Crimea. In 1585 he put down revolts in Syria and Lebanon with the Ottoman Egyptian fleet based in Alexandria.

Kılıç Ali Pasha died on 21 June 1587 in Constantinople (Istanbul). He is buried at the Kılıç Ali Paşa Mosque (1580), designed by the renowned architect Mimar Sinan.

<text>Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk (12 July 162813 January 1684) was an English nobleman and politician. He was the second son of Henry Howard, 22nd Earl of Arundel, and Lady Elizabeth Stuart. He succeeded his brother Thomas Howard, 5th Duke of Norfolk, after Thomas&#x27;s death in 1677.

==Life==
Henry Howard&#x27;s older brother Thomas contracted a fever while visiting their grandfather Thomas in Padua in 1645 that subsequently left him mentally disabled and unable to administer his own affairs. There was near unanimity in the House of Lords in persuading King CharlesII to revive the Dukedom of Norfolk for the Howard family in 1660 but, as this descended from Henry&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Thomas to his brother Thomas who was still confined to an asylum in Padua, Henry managed the duchy&#x27;s affairs in his name. 

Following the Great Fire of London in 1666, Henry Howard allowed the Royal Society to meet regularly at Arundel House. Having befriended John Evelyn, he followed Evelyn&#x27;s guidance to provide some of his grandfather&#x27;s Grecian statues to Oxford University, principally to get them out of the corrosive London air. He further agreed to bestow his grandfather&#x27;s collection of manuscripts to the Royal Society, but it initially remained at Arundel House for want of a dedicated library elsewhere.

It being felt desirable to be able to summon Henry to the Lords in his own right, he was created 1st Baron Howard of Castle Rising in 1669 and 1st Earl of Norwich in 1672, on the latter occasion obtaining the restoration of the office of Earl Marshal of England to him and to his family. Henry&#x27;s career in the Lords began inauspiciously when he announced that he had married Jane Bickerton, who had been his mistress for many years. This caused a violent family quarrel, as a result of which he went abroad for a time. Nonetheless, he wielded considerable political influence and in 1673 was able to find a safe seat in Parliament for Samuel Pepys.

After succeeding to the duchy on his brother Thomas&#x27;s death in 1677, he began to transfer his manuscript collection to Gresham College for the Royal Society buthaving become Earl Marshal in the interimhe also granted a large number of works to the library of the College of Arms overseen by that position. The two separate collections are still preserved as the Arundel Manuscripts. 

In January 1678, he took his seat in the House of Lords, but in August the first development of the Popish Plot was followed by an Act for disabling Catholics from sitting in either house of Parliament. As a sincere Roman Catholic, he would not comply with the oath recognizing the King as Head of the Church; at the same time he urged his fellow peers to do so if their consciences permitted, to ensure the survival of the House of Lords as an institution, whereupon the Lords thanked him for his &quot;good service&quot;. He withdrew to Bruges for three years. There he built a house attached to a Franciscan convent and enjoyed freedom of worship. He later gave away the greater part of his library, grounds, and rooms to the Royal Society, and the Arundelian marbles to Oxford University.

He was presented as a recusant at Thetford assizes in 1680, and felt obliged to return to England to answer the charge, which was not pursued; a previous accusation by the notorious informer William Bedloe in 1678 that he had been party to, or at least aware of a plot to kill the King, had simply been ignored.

He remained in England long enough to sit as a peer at the trial for treason of his uncle, William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford, a fellow victim of the Popish Plot. Unfortunately for Stafford, who was notoriously &quot;a man not beloved by his family&quot;, he had quarrelled with most of his relatives, including Norfolk, and with the exception of Norfolk&#x27;s eldest son, the future 7th Duke of Norfolk, the eight Howard peers present, including the 6th Duke, voted him Guilty. Stafford was beheaded on 29 December; the Duke does not seem to have interceded for his uncle&#x27;s life. He returned to Bruges for a time.

With the waning of the hysteria, he felt it safe to return home. John Evelyn in his diary for 9 May 1683 records visiting him to discuss buying some of his artworks, and gives the diarist&#x27;s very low opinion of the Duchess. From Evelyn&#x27;s description, it is clear that the Duke then had an impressive collection of &quot;cartoons and drawings of Raphael and the Great Masters&quot;.

==Marriages and issue==

About 1652, Howard married Lady Anne Somerset, daughter of Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester, and Elizabeth Dormer. They had at least four children:
* Lady Elizabeth Howard, married George Gordon, 1st Duke of Gordon
* Henry Howard, 7th Duke of Norfolk, married the Baroness Mordaunt, no issue
* Lady Frances Howard, married Sebastián Gonzalez de Andía-Irarrazaval, Marquess of Valparaiso, Viscount of Santa Clara de Avedillo, Count of Villaverde
* Lord Thomas Howard (1662–1689), married Mary Elizabeth Savile and had issue:
** Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk
** Anne Howard
** Mary Howard, married Walter Aston, 4th Lord Aston of Forfar and had issue
** Edward Howard, 9th Duke of Norfolk
** Philip Howard (ancestor of the Baron Mowbray, considered heir general of the Howard family and Talbot family)
His second wife was Jane Bickerton. She had been his mistress for many years prior to the marriage in 1676 or 1677, and its announcement caused a violent quarrel with his eldest son and heir. They had four sons, all of whom died childless, and three daughters:
* Lady Philippa Howard (1678–1731), married Ralph Standish (died in 1755), who had a daughter
* Lord George Howard, married but childless
* Lord James Howard, drowned unmarried in August 1702
* Lord Frederick Henry Howard (died 16 March 1727), married but childless
* Lady Catherine Howard, a nun in Flanders.

The peerages created for him died out with his grandson the 9th Duke in 1777, though the current Baron Mowbray descends from the 9th Duke&#x27;s brother. The 10th and 11th Dukes of Norfolk, who inherited the associated peerages and office of Earl Marshal, descended from his brother Lord Charles Howard of Greystoke, and the 12th and later Dukes from his brother Lord Bernard Howard of Glossop.

<text>Edward William Fitzalan-Howard, 18th Duke of Norfolk, (born 2 December 1956), styled Earl of Arundel between 1975 and 2002. He is a British peer who holds the hereditary office of Earl Marshal. As Duke of Norfolk, he is the most senior non-royal peer in the peerage of England. He is also the titular head of the House of Howard.

==Background and education==
Norfolk is the son of Miles Francis Stapleton Fitzalan-Howard, 17th Duke of Norfolk, and his wife Anne Mary Teresa Constable-Maxwell. He was educated at Ampleforth College, a Roman Catholic independent school, before going up to Lincoln College, Oxford.

He has a brother and three sisters. His only brother, Lord Gerald Fitzalan-Howard, runs the Carlton Towers estate with his wife, Emma Fitzalan-Howard. The Duke&#x27;s eldest sister is the Countess of Balfour. His second sister, Lady Carina Fitzalan-Howard, is the widow of broadcaster David Frost. His third and youngest sister is the actress Marsha Fitzalan.

==Career==

Norfolk worked with various companies, and from 2000 to 2002 was Deputy Earl Marshal. Upon the death of his father in 2002, he inherited the late Duke of Norfolk&#x27;s peerages and the position of Earl Marshal. He was a Cub Scout while at school at Ampleforth College and currently holds two appointments in the Scout Movement. He was the President of 1st Arundel (Earl of Arundel&#x27;s Own) Scout Group in 2010, and still serves as President of the Arundel &amp; Littlehampton District Scouts up to present. He is also Patron of West Sussex County Scouts. In June 2003, he was awarded the Medal of Merit for Services by the Scout Movement. He is an Honorary Fellow of St Edmund&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

Norfolk was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) in the 2022 Birthday Honours.

As a member of the House of Lords, he has cast only twelve votes, mostly against hunting restrictions.

As hereditary Earl Marshal, he was responsible for the arrangement of the 19 September 2022 state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II and the accession and coronation of King Charles III.

==Personal life==
The Duke lives at Arundel Castle.
As a result of driving offense he committed in April 2022, he was disqualified from driving for six months until September of same year. He also had several motoring convictions where he incurred an excess of penalty points, resulting in a driving ban. His barrister argued in mitigation that he needed the ability to drive to organise the coronation of King Charles III.

==Family==
A Roman Catholic, the Duke of Norfolk is recognised by the Vatican as England&#x27;s senior representative of the faith. The Duke, then Earl of Arundel, married Georgina Susan Gore on 27 June 1987 at Arundel Cathedral. Together, they have three sons and two daughters:

* Henry Miles Fitzalan-Howard, Earl of Arundel (3 December 1987) who married Cecilia Mary Elizabeth &quot;dei Conti&quot; (of the Counts) Colacicchi, &quot;Nobile&quot; di Anagni on 16 July 2016. They have three daughters.
* Lady Rachel Fitzalan-Howard (10 June 1989)
* Lord Thomas Fitzalan-Howard (14 March 1992)
* Lady Isabel Fitzalan-Howard (7 February 1994)
* Lord Philip Fitzalan-Howard (14 July 1996)

The Duke and Duchess separated in 2011, but were reconciled by 2016, only to split up again; their divorce became final in 2022.

On 12 November 2022, the Duke married Francesca Herbert (née Bevan), former wife of The Hon. Henry Herbert, second son of the 7th Earl of Carnarvon.

<text>Alicia Mabel Partnoy (born 1955 in Bahía Blanca, Argentina) is a human rights activist, poet, college professor, and translator.

After Argentinian President Juan Perón died, the students from the left of the Peronist political party organized with fervor within the country&#x27;s universities and, along with workers, were persecuted and imprisoned. There was a military coup in 1976 and people began to disappear. Partnoy was one of those who suffered through the ordeals of becoming a political prisoner. She became an activist of the Peronist Youth Movement while attending Southern National University (see Education).

She was taken from her home, leaving behind her 18-month-old daughter, on January 12, 1977, by the Argentinian Army and imprisoned at a concentration camp named The Little School (&quot;La Escuelita&quot;). For three and a half months, Partnoy was blindfolded. She was brutally beaten, starved, molested, and forced to live in inhuman conditions. She was moved from the concentration camp to the prison of Villa Floresta in Bahía Blanca where she stayed for six months only to be transferred to Villa Devoto prison in Buenos Aires. She spent two and a half years as a prisoner of conscience, with no charges.

In 1979, she was forced to leave the country, coming to the U.S. as a refugee with her daughter where they were reunited with her husband in Seattle, Washington. In 1985, she told her story of what had happened to her at The Little School in an eponymous book. The world began to open its eyes to the treatment of women in reference to the disappearances of Latin Americans.

Alicia Partnoy has testified before the United Nations, the Organization of American States, Amnesty International, and the Argentine Human Rights Commission. Her testimony is recorded in a compilation of testimonials by the National Commission for the Investigation of the Disappeared. She currently lives in Los Angeles, California, CA and teaches at Loyola Marymount University.

In June 2007, a collection of her poems appeared in the second issue of the avant-garde Hebrew poetry and criticism magazine Daka rendered by Eran Tzelgov.

== Education ==
Alicia Partnoy worked towards a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Literature at the Universidad Nacional del Sur, in Bahía Blanca, Argentina. After her three years as a political prisoner, once in exile, she continued her studies at the University of the District of Columbia and at the American University, where she obtained a Certificate in Translation. She holds a Master&#x27;s degree and a PhD from the Catholic University of America.

== Career ==
Over the years, Alicia Partnoy has served as part-time lecturer and visiting professor at several institutions. Since 1998 she has been at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California, where she is a professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures.

== Publications ==
Alicia Partnoy is the author, translator or editor of twelve books and a chapbook.

Partnoy&#x27;s most famous work is her book &quot;The Little School: Tales of Disappearance and Survival in Argentina&quot;, written originally in Spanish (&quot;La Escuelita: Relatos testimoniales&quot;), but published in her home country, Argentina, twenty years after the English edition was released in the U.S. and England. A French translation has been published by Zinnia Editions, and a Bengali translation by an alternative publishing house in Kolkata, was published in 2015. A Hebrew translation is forthcoming.

Partnoy also authored the following poetry collections: &quot;Flowering Fires / Fuegos florales, Venganza de la manzana / Revenge of the Apple,&quot; and &quot;Volando bajito / Little Low Flying,&quot; as well as the chapbook &quot;Ecos lógicos y otros poemares&quot; and, with her daughter Ruth Irupé Sanabria, the children&#x27;s book &quot;¡Escuchá! Cuentos y versitos para los más chiquitos,&quot; which includes poetry and short stories sent to Ruth from the Villa Devoto prison where her mother was held prisoner.

Additionally, Partnoy edited the books &quot;Para mi hija Silvia / For My Daughter Silvia&quot; (by author Evangelina Arce, a mother of Ciudad Juarez)&quot;, Las ramas hacia el mundo: antología familiar, You Can&#x27;t Drown the Fire: Latin American Women Writing in Exile,&quot; and, with Christina Fialho and Kristina Shull, &quot;Call Me Libertad: Poems between Borders.&quot;

Partnoy has written numerous academic articles and has contributed chapters to &quot;Women Writing Resistance: Essays on Latin America and the Caribbean, Loss and Hope: Global, Interreligious and Interdisciplinary Perspectives,&quot; and &quot;Representing Humanity in an Age of Terror.&quot;

Partnoy most recently co-authored with Martina Ramirez &quot;Happier as a Woman: Transforming Friendships, Transforming Lives.&quot;

== Recognition and awards ==
Alicia Partnoy&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;Flowering Fires / Fuegos florales&quot; translated into English by Gail Wronsky, received the First Settlement House American Poetry Prize in 2014. The Washington Independent Review of Books selected it as one of the Best 18 Books of and About Poetry of 2015.

&quot;The Little School&quot; was included in The London Times Best Sellers List in 1987. It was selected as Writer&#x27;s Choice of the Pushcart Foundation, twice, by Bobbie Ann Mason and Tobias Wolff. In Argentina, in 2011 the Spanish language edition received the Special Jury Prize/Elegidos Alija (Argentine Section of IBBY-International Board on Books for Young People) and it won CONABIP&#x27;s bid (Argentine National Commission for Public Libraries) to be selected as one of 137 titles to be purchased and donated to Argentina&#x27;s 1,100 public libraries.

Most recently, it was selected as “the book” for the Santa Barbara City College Program SBCC Reads in 2018.

<text>Sara Jane Moore (née Kahn; born February 15, 1930) is an American woman who attempted to assassinate U.S. president Gerald Ford in 1975. She was given a life sentence for the attempted assassination and she was released from prison on December 31, 2007, after serving 32 years. Moore and Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme are the only women who have attempted to assassinate an American president; both of their assassination attempts were on Gerald Ford and both of them took place in California within three weeks of one another.

==Background==
Moore was born in Charleston, West Virginia, the daughter of Ruth (née Moore) and Olaf Kahn. Her paternal grandparents were German immigrants. Moore had been a nursing school student, Women&#x27;s Army Corps recruit, and accountant. Divorced five times, she had four children before she turned to revolutionary politics in 1975. Moore comes from a Christian background. She later began practicing Judaism.

Moore&#x27;s friends said that she had a fascination and an obsession with Patricia Hearst. After Hearst was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), Hearst&#x27;s father, Randolph Hearst, created the organization People In Need (PIN) to feed the poor, as a response to the SLA&#x27;s claims that the elder Hearst was &quot;committing &#x27;crimes&#x27; against &#x27;the people. Moore, a volunteer bookkeeper for PIN, had been serving as an FBI informant there until the moment she attempted to assassinate Ford.

==Attempted assassination of Gerald Ford==


Moore had been evaluated by the Secret Service earlier in 1975, but agents decided that she posed no danger to the president. The 45-year-old had been picked up by police on an illegal-handgun charge the day before the Ford incident, but was released. The police confiscated her .44-caliber Charter Arms Bulldog revolver and 113 rounds of ammunition. 

Moore&#x27;s assassination attempt took place in San Francisco on September 22, 1975, just 17 days after Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme&#x27;s attempted assassination of Ford. She was standing in the crowd across the street from the St. Francis Hotel, and she was about away from Ford when she fired a single shot at him with a .38 caliber revolver. She was using a gun which she bought in haste that same morning and as a result, she did not know that the sights were 15 cm (6 inches) off the point-of-impact at that distance, causing her to narrowly miss.

After realizing that she had missed, Moore raised her arm again, and Oliver Sipple, a former Marine, dove toward her and grabbed her arm, possibly saving Ford&#x27;s life. Sipple said at the time: &quot;I saw [her gun] pointed out there and I grabbed for it. [...] I lunged and grabbed the woman&#x27;s arm and the gun went off.&quot; The bullet from the second shot ricocheted and hit John Ludwig, a 42-year-old taxi driver. Ludwig survived. U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti, who sentenced Moore, voiced his opinion that Moore would have killed Ford had she had her own gun, and it was only &quot;because her gun was faulty&quot; that the president&#x27;s life was spared.

During an interview which she conducted in 2009, Moore stated that her motive was to spark a violent revolution in order to bring change to America.

==Trial and imprisonment==
Moore pleaded guilty to attempted assassination and was sentenced to life in prison. At her sentencing hearing Moore stated: &quot;Am I sorry I tried? Yes and no. Yes, because it accomplished little except to throw away the rest of my life. And, no, I&#x27;m not sorry I tried, because at the time it seemed a correct expression of my anger.&quot; She served her term at the federal women&#x27;s prison in Dublin, California, where she worked in the UNICOR prison labor program for $1.25 per hour as the Lead Inmate Operating Accountant. Moore had the Federal Bureau of Prisons register number 04851-180.

In 1979, Moore escaped, but she was captured several hours later.

During an interview which he conducted in 2004, Ford described Moore as &quot;off her mind&quot; and he also stated that he continued to make public appearances, even after two attempts on his life within such a short period of time, because &quot;a president has to be aggressive, has to meet the people.&quot;

===Release===
On December 31, 2007, at age 77, Moore was slated to be released from prison on parole after serving 32 years of her life sentence. Ford had died from natural causes on December 26, 2006, one year and five days before her release. Moore had later stated that she regretted the assassination attempt, saying she was &quot;blinded by her radical political views&quot;. Moore was released under a federal law that makes parole mandatory for inmates who have served at least 30 years of a life sentence and have maintained a satisfactory disciplinary record. When asked about her crime in an interview, Moore stated, &quot;I am very glad I did not succeed. I know now that I was wrong to try.&quot;

In February 2019, at age 89, Moore was arrested for violating her parole by failing to tell her parole officer about a trip which she went on outside the country; she was subsequently released in August 2019.

==Media==
On May 28, 2019, Moore appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; program, her first television appearance since she left prison on parole.

Moore also discussed her 1979 escape from prison. She revealed that an inmate told her, &quot;when jumping the fence just put your hand on the barbed wire, you&#x27;ll only have a few puncture wounds.&quot; She went on to say, &quot;If I knew that I was going to be captured several hours later, I would have stopped at the local bar just to get a drink and a burger.&quot;

Excerpts from an interview with Moore by Latif Nasser appear on an episode of the radio program &quot;Radiolab&quot; titled &quot;Oliver Sipple&quot;, which was released on September 22, 2017. In the interview, Moore discusses the scene from the day she attempted to assassinate President Ford and her perspective of being stopped by Oliver Sipple.

==In popular culture==
Moore is a character in Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman&#x27;s musical &quot;Assassins&quot;, which is about presidential assassins, both successful and unsuccessful. Moore, John Wilkes Booth, Charles J. Guiteau and Leon Czolgosz appear in &quot;The Gun Song&quot;.

A biography of Moore called &quot;Taking Aim at the President&quot; was published in 2009 by Geri Spieler, a writer who had a correspondence with Moore for 28 years.

&quot;Suburban Fury&quot;, a 2024 Robinson Devor documentary about Moore, filmed after her release from prison, was selected to screen in the Main Slate section of the 2024 New York Film Festival.

<doc id="595089" wikidata="Q3370543" url="?curid=595089" title="Office of National Drug Control Policy">
<text>The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is a component of the Executive Office of the President of the United States.

The director of the ONDCP, colloquially known as the drug czar, heads the office. &quot;Drug czar&quot; was a term first used in the media by Richard Nixon in 1971. In addition to running the ONDCP, the director evaluates, coordinates, and oversees both the international and domestic anti-drug efforts of executive branch agencies and ensures that such efforts sustain and complement State and local anti-drug activities. The Director advises the President regarding changes in the organization, management, budgeting, and personnel of federal agencies that affect U.S. anti-drug efforts; and regarding federal agency compliance with their obligations under the National Drug Control Strategy, an annual report required by law. Prior to Rahul Gupta taking office in November, 2021, the most recent director was James. W. Carroll, who took over from former director Michael Botticelli. The fiscal year 2011 National Drug Control Budget proposed by the Obama administration devoted significant new resources to the prevention and treatment of drug abuse. These resources were complemented by an aggressive effort to enhance domestic law enforcement, interdiction, and supply control programs. New resources, $340 million, were added to the prevention and treatment of drug use.

== Programs ==

The programs directed by the ONDCP include:
* the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program
* the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, a current domestic government substance abuse prevention campaign in the US
* the Drug Free Communities Program
* Anti-doping activities
* World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) dues

== Congressional issues ==
=== Bipartisan support for drug czar ===
The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, which created the Office of National Drug Control Policy, was the product of bi-partisan support. It was co-sponsored in the House of Representatives by parties&#x27; leaders, Tom Foley and Robert Michel, and it passed by margins of 346–11 and 87–3 in the House and Senate, respectively. Upon signing the law, Ronald Reagan said, &quot;This bill is the product of a bipartisan effort.&quot;

=== Funding ===
In September 2002, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended that salaries and expenses at ONDCP be reduced from $26.6 million in fiscal 2006 to $11.5 million in fiscal 2007, to &quot;more closely reflect actual performance.&quot; Committee members said they would request funding for a study of ONDCP by the National Academy of Public Administration. They also ordered a Government Accountability Office study on the distribution of grants. Plus, they directed the Director to provide quarterly updates on travel expenditures, staffing levels and plans for future hirings.

In 2011, the ONDCP requested funding for 98 full-time employees, 64 (65.31%) of whom would be paid at either GS-15, GS-14, or SES pay grades, or more than $105,211.00 yearly, being adjusted for Washington, D.C. cost of living expenses.

=== High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Program ===
In 2005, the Bush administration proposed transferring the $225 million High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Program from ONDCP to the Department of Justice. The program gives additional money to designated areas with chronic illicit drug problems. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Many lawmakers oppose the transfer for fear the program would become less of a priority.&quot;

=== Anti-legalization Policy ===
By law, the drug czar must oppose any attempt to legalize the use (in any form) of illicit drugs. According to the &quot;Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998&quot; the director of the ONDCP
(12) shall ensure that no Federal funds appropriated to the Office of National Drug Control Policy shall be expended for any study or contract relating to the legalization (for a medical use or any other use) of a substance listed in schedule I of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and take such actions as necessary to oppose any attempt to legalize the use of a substance (in any form) that –

1. is listed in schedule I of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812); and
2. has not been approved for use for medical purposes by the Food and Drug Administration;

The Government Accountability Office has found that this law authorizes the ONDCP to disseminate information in order to oppose legalization:
Finally, apart from considerations of whether any particular law has been violated, you have asked whether the Deputy Director&#x27;s letter disseminated misleading information in connection with statements relating to the debate over legalization of marijuana. Clearly, the Deputy Director&#x27;s statements reflect one perspective regarding marijuana – a perspective that is disputed by others with different viewpoints. However, ONDCP is specifically charged with the responsibility for &quot;taking such actions as necessary to oppose any attempt to legalize the use&quot; of certain controlled substances such as marijuana – a responsibility which logically could include the making of advocacy statements in opposition to legalization efforts. The Deputy Director&#x27;s statements about marijuana are thus within the statutory role assigned to ONDCP. Given this role, we do not see a need to examine the accuracy of the Deputy Director&#x27;s individual statements in detail.

==Effectiveness of ONDCP==
=== Extent of drug use in the U.S. ===
In September 2006, the office reported that the 2005 survey of 67,500 people found that 8.1 percent reported using an illicit drug in the 30 days prior to being asked about their drug use, which equates to 19.7 million people nationwide (age 12 and older). The percentage was up slightly compared to 2004. Youth drug use declined for the third year in a row. While the ONDCP measures their efficacy against prior use statistics within the U.S., they do not publicize how these statistics compare against other countries at the time in their communications to the press. In 2008, ONDCP reported that actual youth drug use, as measured as the percent reporting past month use, declined from 19.4% to 14.8% among middle and high school students between 2001 and 2007.

===Anti-marijuana advertising===
In August 2001, the office told a Congressional committee that its National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign &quot;has been the most visible symbol of the federal government&#x27;s commitment to drug prevention,&quot; and that the office was &quot;investing $7 million a year in performance measurement to determine the effectiveness&quot; of the campaign. The statement by said &quot;We believe there is a strong body of evidence that indicates the campaign is working, as planned, to change drug attitudes, intentions and use.&quot;

In 2002, according to a multiyear study by the research firm hired by the office, teenagers exposed to federal anti-drug ads were no less likely to use drugs for having viewed them, and some young girls said they were even more likely to give drugs a try. Walters blamed poor ads that weren&#x27;t resonating with teenagers. Walters promised in Senate testimony in 2002 that he would show results within a year or admit failure, and Congress agreed to extend the campaign through 2003 while cutting funding for the ads from $170  million in 2002 to $150 million in 2003. An entirely new advertising campaign was created.

In February 2005, a research company hired by the office and the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported that the government&#x27;s ad campaign aimed at dissuading teens from using marijuana, a campaign that cost $1.4 billion between 1998 and 2006, did not work: &quot;greater exposure to the campaign was associated with weaker anti-drug norms and increases in the perceptions that others use marijuana.&quot; The research company was paid $42.7 million for the five-year study. After the February 2005 report was received, the office continued the ad campaign, spending $220 million on the anti-marijuana ads in fiscal years 2005 and 2006.

=== Other ===
According to the University of Michigan&#x27;s annual Monitoring the Future report, the number of young people using drugs in the U.S. declined by 7 percent between 2001 and 2006, though there is no evidence to suggest that government anti-drug programs that were started at the turn of the millennium helped cause this drop.

While cocaine production in Colombia initially decreased with the onset of Plan Colombia, the United Nations declared that in 2005, despite record levels of eradication by the U.S., coca production increased to about .

==Controversies==
=== Paying for anti-drug messages in television shows ===
In the spring of 1998, the ONDCP began offering additional advertising dollars to networks that embedded anti-drug messages in their programming. They developed an accounting system to decide which network shows would be valued and for how much. Receiving advance copies of scripts, they assigned financial value to each show&#x27;s anti-drug message. Then they would suggest ways that the networks could increase the payments they would get. The WB network&#x27;s senior vice president for broadcast standards Rick Mater admitted, &quot;The White House did view scripts. They did sign off on them – they read scripts, yes.&quot;

Running the campaign for the ONDCP was Alan Levitt, who estimated that between 1998 and 2000 the networks received nearly $25 million in benefits.

One example was with Warner Brothers&#x27; show, &quot;Smart Guy&quot;. The original script portrayed two young people using drugs at a party. Originally depicted as cool and popular, after input from the drug office, &quot;We showed that they were losers and put them [hidden away to indulge in shamed secrecy] in a utility room. That was not in the original script.&quot;

Other shows including &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; and &quot;7th Heaven&quot; also put anti-drug messages into their stories.

In 2000, the Federal Communications Commission, in response to a complaint by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, sent inquiries to five major television networks about these practices. The House Committee on Government Reform&#x27;s Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources held hearings on the matter on July 11, 2000. In December of that year, the FCC ruled that the networks should have identified the Office of National Drug Control Policy as the sponsor of the television programs.

=== State and local decriminalization ballot measures ===
In December 2002, the Marijuana Policy Project, filed a complaint with the Nevada Secretary of State accusing the Drug Czar John Walters of illegally campaigning against its 2002 ballot initiative to decriminalize possession of up to 3 ounces of cannabis in that state. Specifically, MPP argued that Nevada campaign finance laws required the Drug Czar to reveal how much taxpayer money he had spent to defeat the initiative. In April 2003, the Nevada Attorney General concluded that the Drug Czar was not required to comply with Nevada&#x27;s campaign finance laws. MPP filed a writ of mandamus as an appeal of the decision. The Nevada Supreme Court issued an order declaring that MPP had &quot;set forth issues of arguable merit&quot; in its writ; however, on August 18, 2004, the Court declared that it was &quot;not satisfied that [the] court&#x27;s intervention by way of extraordinary relief is warranted&quot;.

A February 24, 2005 MPP press release announced that the group had filed similar complaints in Montana, Oregon, and Alaska, accusing the Drug Czar of failing to make legally required campaign expense disclosures:
:&quot;On October 5, 2004, the drug czar traveled to Oregon for the purpose of opposing Measure 33, a ballot measure designed to expand the state&#x27;s medical marijuana program. On October 6, ONDCP Deputy Director Scott Burns traveled to Montana to campaign against Initiative 148, the medical marijuana measure passed by voters in November. And on October 13 and 14, Burns traveled to Alaska to oppose Measure 2, a measure to allow the state to tax and regulate the sale of marijuana. All of these trips were widely reported in the local press as being campaign stops in opposition to the reform initiatives.&quot;

=== Use of video news releases ===
In 2005, the Government Accountability Office found that the ONDCP had violated domestic propaganda and publicity prohibitions by preparing prepackaged news stories that did not disclose to television viewers that the government had produced them, had illegally spent appropriations to develop, produce and distribute the covert propaganda but use of the term &quot;Drug Czar&quot; in the &quot;Video News Releases&quot; had not constituted unlawful self-aggrandizement.

ONDCP supporters such as Representatives Tom Davis and Mark Edward Souder have dismissed such criticism on the grounds that the ONDCP is expressly authorized by law to conduct anti-drug media campaigns. According to Susan A. Poling, managing associate general counsel at the GAO, &quot;What is objectionable about these is the fact the viewer has no idea their tax dollars are being used to write and produce this video segment.&quot;.

=== 2017 reported shutdown ===
As early as February 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; had reported that the Trump administration was considering eliminating the office, and other programs responsible for a total of $2.5 billion of domestic spending.
In May, the office&#x27;s website was blanked and Politico and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; both reported that the office was about to be drastically defunded. Later the office&#x27;s website was unblanked.

<text>Iomega Corporation (later LenovoEMC) was a company that produced external, portable, and networked data storage products. Established in the 1980s in Roy, Utah, United States, Iomega sold more than 410 million digital storage drives and disks, including the Zip drive floppy disk system. Formerly a public company, it was acquired by EMC Corporation in 2008, and then by Lenovo, which rebranded the product line as LenovoEMC, until discontinuation in 2018.

== History ==
Iomega started in Roy, Utah, U.S. in 1980, with the original founders Jerome Paul Johnson, David Bailey, and David Norton. Its headquarters were moved to San Diego, California in 2001. For many years, it was a significant name in the data storage industry. Iomega&#x27;s most famous product, the Zip drive, offered relatively large amounts of storage on portable, high-capacity floppy disks. The original Zip disk&#x27;s 100MB capacity was a huge improvement over the decades-long standard of 1.44MB standard floppy disks. The Zip drive became a common internal and external peripheral for IBM-compatible and Macintosh personal computers. However, Zip drives sometimes failed after a short period, which failure was commonly referred to as the &quot;click of death.&quot; This problem, combined with competition from CD-RW drives, caused Zip drive sales to decline dramatically, even after introducing larger 250MB and 750MB versions. Iomega eventually launched a CD-RW drive.

Without the revenue from its proprietary storage disks and drives, Iomega&#x27;s sales and profits declined considerably. Iomega&#x27;s stock price, which was over $100 at its height in the 1990s, fell to around $2 in the mid-2000s. Trying to find a niche, Iomega released devices such as the HipZip MP3 player, the FotoShow Digital Image Center, and numerous external hard drives, optical drives, and NAS products. None of these products were successful.

In 2012, reporter Vincent Verweij of Dutch broadcaster Katholieke Radio Omroep revealed that at least 16,000 Iomega NAS devices were publicly exposing their users&#x27; files on the Internet. This was due to Iomega having disabled password security by default. KLM, ING Group, and Ballast Nedam all had confidential material leaked in this manner. Iomega USA acknowledged the problem and said future models (starting February 2013) would have password security enabled by default. The company said it would clearly instruct users about the risks of unsecured data.

===Acquisition by EMC===

On April 8, 2008, EMC Corporation announced plans to acquire Iomega for . The acquisition was completed in June 2008, making Iomega the SOHO/SMB arm of EMC. EMC kept the Iomega brand name alive with products such as the StorCenter NAS line, ScreenPlay TV Link adapter, and v.Clone virtualization software (a Iomega-branded version of VMware&#x27;s Player virtualization-solution).

===Joint venture with Lenovo: LenovoEMC===

In 2013, EMC (before the Dell purchase) formed a joint venture with Chinese technology company Lenovo, named LenovoEMC, that took over Iomega&#x27;s business. LenovoEMC rebranded all of Iomega&#x27;s products under its name. LenovoEMC designed products for small and medium-sized businesses that could not afford enterprise-class data storage. LenovoEMC was a part of a broader partnership between the two companies announced in August 2012. The partnership also included an effort to develop x86-based servers and allowing Lenovo to act as an OEM for some EMC hardware. LenovoEMC was a part of Lenovo&#x27;s Enterprise Products Group before it ultimately dissolved with the EMC Dell acquisition.

In November 2013, Lenovo announced the construction of a research and development facility near São Paulo, Brazil. This facility was dedicated to enterprise software and supporting LenovoEMC&#x27;s development of high-end servers and cloud storage. Construction would cost $100 million and about 100 people would be employed at the facility. It would be located in the University of Campinas Science and Technology Park, about 60 miles from São Paulo. Later in 2016 the Brazil facility was downscaled and relocated elsewhere.

== Products ==
Iomega designed and manufactured a range of products intended to compete with and ultimately replace the 3.5&quot; floppy disk, notably the Zip drive. Initial Iomega products connected to a computer via SCSI or parallel port; later models used USB and FireWire (1994).

===PX4-400d===
The 400d was a multi-bay network-attached storage (NAS) device. The 400d was powered by an Intel Atom processor running at 2.13 gigahertz, had 2 gigabytes of RAM, and a SATA 3 controller capable of moving data at 6 gigabits per second. The HDMI-out function enabled monitoring live feeds from surveillance cameras. The unit can be set up and managed without a PC using an external display, keyboard, and mouse. The 400d is LenovoEMC&#x27;s first product sold with its LifeLine 4.1 software, which added functions such as a domain mode, enhanced Active Directory support and a more robust SDK. McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator was included for centralized security management. All THINK-branded systems from Lenovo pre-installed with Windows 8.1 included LenovoEMC Storage Connector in order make discovery and set-up of the 400d and other LenovoEMC NAS devices smoother.

===Lenovo Beacon Home Cloud Centre===
At the 2014 International CES, LenovoEMC announced the Lenovo Beacon Home Cloud Centre. The Beacon is a storage device that allows remote sharing of data such as music, pictures, and video. The Beacon allows music and video streaming to multiple devices. Android phones and tablets can be used to control the Beacon. It also has an HDMI port to allow connection to a television or monitor. Up to 6 terabytes of storage, RAID 0 and 1, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth are all supported.

<text>Osteomyelitis (OM) is an infection of bone. Symptoms may include pain in a specific bone with overlying redness, fever, and weakness. The feet, spine, and hips are the most commonly involved bones in adults.
The cause is usually a bacterial infection, but rarely can be a fungal infection. It may occur by spread from the blood or from surrounding tissue. Risks for developing osteomyelitis include diabetes, intravenous drug use, prior removal of the spleen, and trauma to the area. Diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms and basic laboratory tests as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. This is because plain radiographs are unremarkable in the first few days following acute infection. Diagnosis is further confirmed by blood tests, medical imaging, or bone biopsy.
Treatment of bacterial osteomyelitis often involves both antimicrobials and surgery. Treatment outcomes of bacterial osteomyelitis are generally good when the condition has only been present a short time. In people with poor blood flow, amputation may be required. Treatment of the relatively rare fungal osteomyelitis as mycetoma infection entails the use of antifungal medications. In contrast to bacterial osteomyelitis, amputation or large bony resections is more common in neglected fungal osteomyelitis (mycetoma) where infections of the foot account for the majority of cases. About 2.4 per 100,000 people are affected by osteomyelitis each year. The young and old are more commonly affected. Males are more commonly affected than females. The condition was described at least as early as the 300s BC by Hippocrates. Prior to the availability of antibiotics, the risk of death was significant.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms may include pain in a specific bone with overlying redness, fever, and weakness and inability to walk especially in children with acute bacterial osteomyelitis. Onset may be sudden or gradual. Enlarged lymph nodes may be present.
In fungal osteomyelitis, there is usually a history of walking bare-footed, especially in rural and farming areas. Contrary to the mode of infection in bacterial osteomyelitis, which is primarily blood-borne, fungal osteomyelitis starts as a skin infection, then invades deeper tissues until it reaches bone.

==Cause==
Acute osteomyelitis almost invariably occurs in children who are otherwise healthy, because of rich blood supply to the growing bones. When adults are affected, it may be because of compromised host resistance due to debilitation, intravenous drug abuse, infectious root-canaled teeth, or other disease or drugs (e.g., immunosuppressive therapy). The most commonly affected areas for children are the long bones, and for adults, the feet, spine, and hips. 

Osteomyelitis is a secondary complication in 1–3% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. In this case, the bacteria, in general, spread to the bone through the circulatory system, first infecting the synovium (due to its higher oxygen concentration) before spreading to the adjacent bone. In tubercular osteomyelitis, the long bones and vertebrae are the ones that tend to be affected.

&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is the organism most commonly isolated from all forms of osteomyelitis.

Osteomyelitis is often caused by &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. In infants, &quot;S. aureus&quot;, Group B streptococci and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; are commonly isolated; in children from one to 16 years of age, &quot;S. aureus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, and &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; are common. In some subpopulations, including intravenous drug users and splenectomized patients, Gram-negative bacteria, including enteric bacteria, are significant pathogens.

The most common form of the disease in adults is caused by injury exposing the bone to local infection. &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is the most common organism seen in osteomyelitis, seeded from areas of contiguous infection. But anaerobes and Gram-negative organisms, including &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;E. coli&quot;, and &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot;, are also common. Mixed infections are the rule rather than the exception.

Systemic mycotic infections may also cause osteomyelitis. The two most common are &quot;Blastomyces dermatitidis&quot; and &quot;Coccidioides immitis&quot;.

In osteomyelitis involving the vertebral bodies, about half the cases are due to &quot;S. aureus&quot;, and the other half are due to tuberculosis (spread hematogenously from the lungs). Tubercular osteomyelitis of the spine was so common before the initiation of effective antitubercular therapy, it acquired a special name, Pott&#x27;s disease.

The &quot;Burkholderia cepacia&quot; complex has been implicated in vertebral osteomyelitis in intravenous drug users.

==Pathogenesis==
In general, microorganisms may infect bone through one or more of three basic methods
* Via the bloodstream (&quot;haematogeneously&quot;) – the most common method
* From nearby areas of infection (as in cellulitis), or
* Penetrating trauma, including iatrogenic causes such as joint replacements or internal fixation of fractures, leading to a fracture-related infection, or secondary periapical periodontitis in teeth.
The area usually affected when the infection is contracted through the bloodstream is the metaphysis of the bone. Once the bone is infected, leukocytes enter the infected area, and, in their attempt to engulf the infectious organisms, release enzymes that lyse the bone. Pus spreads into the bone&#x27;s blood vessels, impairing their flow, and areas of devitalized infected bone, known as &quot;sequestra&quot;, form the basis of a chronic infection. Often, the body will try to create new bone around the area of necrosis. The resulting new bone is often called an involucrum. On histologic examination, these areas of necrotic bone are the basis for distinguishing between acute osteomyelitis and chronic osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is an infective process that encompasses all of the bone (osseous) components, including the bone marrow. When it is chronic, it can lead to bone sclerosis and deformity.

Chronic osteomyelitis may be due to the presence of intracellular bacteria. Once intracellular, the bacteria are able to spread to adjacent bone cells. At this point, the bacteria may be resistant to certain antibiotics. These combined factors may explain the chronicity and difficult eradication of this disease, resulting in significant costs and disability, potentially leading to amputation. The presence of intracellular bacteria in chronic osteomyelitis is likely an unrecognized contributing factor in its persistence.

In infants, the infection can spread to a joint and cause arthritis. In children, large subperiosteal abscesses can form because the periosteum is loosely attached to the surface of the bone.

Because of the particulars of their blood supply, the tibia, femur, humerus, vertebrae, maxilla and the mandibular bodies are especially susceptible to osteomyelitis. Abscesses of &quot;any&quot; bone, however, may be precipitated by trauma to the affected area. Many infections are caused by &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, a member of the normal flora found on the skin and mucous membranes. In patients with sickle cell disease, the most common causative agent is &quot;Salmonella&quot;, with a relative incidence more than twice that of S. aureus.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is complex and relies on a combination of clinical suspicion and indirect laboratory markers such as a high white blood cell count and fever, although confirmation of clinical and laboratory suspicion with imaging is usually necessary.

Radiographs and CT are the initial method of diagnosis, but are not sensitive and only moderately specific for the diagnosis. They can show the cortical destruction of advanced osteomyelitis, but can miss nascent or indolent diagnoses.

Confirmation is most often by MRI. The presence of edema, diagnosed as increased signal on T2 sequences, is sensitive, but not specific, as edema can occur in reaction to adjacent cellulitis. Confirmation of bony marrow and cortical destruction by viewing the T1 sequences significantly increases specificity. The administration of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast enhances specificity further. In certain situations, such as severe Charcot arthropathy, diagnosis with MRI is still difficult. Similarly, it is limited in distinguishing avascular necrosis from osteomyelitis in sickle cell anemia.

Nuclear medicine scans can be a helpful adjunct to MRI in patients who have metallic hardware that limits or prevents effective magnetic resonance. Generally a triple phase technetium 99 based scan will show increased uptake on all three phases. Gallium scans are 100% sensitive for osteomyelitis but not specific, and may be helpful in patients with metallic prostheses. Combined WBC imaging with marrow studies has 90% accuracy in diagnosing osteomyelitis.

Diagnosis of osteomyelitis is often based on radiologic results showing a lytic center with a ring of sclerosis. Culture of material taken from a bone biopsy is needed to identify the specific pathogen; alternative sampling methods such as needle puncture or surface swabs are easier to perform, but cannot be trusted to produce reliable results.

Factors that may commonly complicate osteomyelitis are fractures of the bone, amyloidosis, endocarditis, or sepsis.

===Classification===
The definition of osteomyelitis (OM) is broad, and encompasses a wide variety of conditions. Traditionally, the length of time the infection has been present and whether there is suppuration (pus formation) or osteosclerosis (pathological increased density of bone) are used to arbitrarily classify OM. Chronic OM is often defined as OM that has been present for more than one month. In reality, there are no distinct subtypes; instead, there is a spectrum of pathologic features that reflects a balance between the type and severity of the cause of the inflammation, the immune system, and local and systemic predisposing factors.
* Suppurative osteomyelitis
** Acute suppurative osteomyelitis
** Chronic suppurative osteomyelitis
*** Primary (no preceding phase)
*** Secondary (follows an acute phase)
* Non-suppurative osteomyelitis
** Diffuse sclerosing
** Focal sclerosing (condensing osteitis)
** Proliferative periostitis (periostitis ossificans, Garré&#x27;s sclerosing osteomyelitis)
** Osteoradionecrosis

OM can also be typed according to the area of the skeleton in which it is present. For example, osteomyelitis of the jaws is different in several respects from osteomyelitis present in a long bone. Vertebral osteomyelitis is another possible presentation.

==Treatment==
Osteomyelitis often requires prolonged antibiotic therapy for weeks or months. A PICC line or central venous catheter can be placed for long-term intravenous medication administration. Some studies of children with acute osteomyelitis report that antibiotic by mouth may be justified due to PICC-related complications. It may require surgical debridement in severe cases, or even amputation. Antibiotics by mouth and by intravenous appear similar.

Due to insufficient evidence it is unclear what the best antibiotic treatment is for osteomyelitis in people with sickle cell disease as of 2019.

Initial first-line antibiotic choice is determined by the patient&#x27;s history and regional differences in common infective organisms. A treatment lasting 42 days is practiced in a number of facilities. Local and sustained availability of drugs have proven to be more effective in achieving prophylactic and therapeutic outcomes. Open surgery is needed for chronic osteomyelitis, whereby the involucrum is opened and the sequestrum is removed or sometimes saucerization can be done. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been shown to be a useful adjunct to the treatment of refractory osteomyelitis.

Before the widespread availability and use of antibiotics, blow fly larvae were sometimes deliberately introduced to the wounds to feed on the infected material, effectively scouring them clean.

There is tentative evidence that bioactive glass may also be useful in long bone infections. Support from randomized controlled trials, however, was not available as of 2015.

Hemicorporectomy is performed in severe cases of Terminal Osteomyelitis in the Pelvis if further treatment won&#x27;t stop the infection.

==History==
The word is from Greek words ὀστέον &quot;osteon&quot;, meaning bone, μυελός &quot;myelos&quot; meaning marrow, and -ῖτις &quot;-itis&quot; meaning inflammation. 

In 1875, American artist Thomas Eakins depicted a surgical procedure for osteomyelitis at Jefferson Medical College, in an oil painting titled &quot;The Gross Clinic&quot;.

Canadian politician and premier of Saskatchewan Tommy Douglas suffered from osteomyelitis as a child, and in 1910, underwent several surgeries, which the surgeon performed for free in exchange for allowing his medical students to observe the procedures (which Douglas&#x27;s parents could not have otherwise afforded). This experience convinced him that medical care should be free for everyone. Douglas became known as the Canadian &quot;Father of Medicare.&quot;

===Fossil record===

Evidence for osteomyelitis found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists, specialists in ancient disease and injury. It has been reported in fossils of the large carnivorous dinosaur &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot;. Osteomyelitis has been also associated with the first evidence of parasites in dinosaur bones.

<doc id="595095" wikidata="Q6754420" url="?curid=595095" title="Mar Saba letter">
<text>The Mar Saba letter is a Greek document which scholar Morton Smith reported in 1960 that he had discovered in the library of the Mar Saba monastery in 1958. The document has been lost and now only survives in two sets of photographs. The text purports to be an epistle of Clement of Alexandria and contains the only known references to a &quot;Secret Gospel of Mark&quot;.

==Discovery and disappearance==
In 1960, Morton Smith announced the discovery of a previously unknown letter with authorship attributed to Clement of Alexandria. Smith stated that while cataloging documents at the ancient monastery of Mar Saba in the summer of 1958, he discovered the text of the letter handwritten into the endpapers of Isaac Vossius&#x27; 1646 printed edition of the works of Ignatius of Antioch. This letter is consequently referred to as the Mar Saba letter of Clement of Alexandria. In 1973 he published a book on the subject, followed by a second book for a popular audience in 1974.

Smith&#x27;s books reproduced black-and-white photographs which he stated he had taken at the time of the discovery. In 1976 a group of four scholars visited Mar Saba, and viewed the manuscript. This visit remained unknown until 2003 when one of the party, Guy Stroumsa, published an account of the visit. In 1977, the volume containing the manuscript was taken to the library of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem. That same year, the manuscript pages were removed from the bound volume by the librarian Kallistos Dourvas, to be photographed and kept separately. These photographs were published in 2000. Subsequent attempts by scholars to view the manuscript have been unsuccessful. Paleographers, working from Smith&#x27;s photographs, have assigned dates from the late seventeenth to the early nineteenth centuries.

==Text==

The letter, addressed to one Theodore, discusses a &quot;Secret Gospel of Mark&quot; and quotes two excerpts from this gospel, one of which mentions &quot;the mystery of the kingdom of God.&quot; Clement begins by commending Theodore&#x27;s actions against the Carpocratians. He then turns to address questions posed by Theodore regarding the Gospel of Mark, a secret variant of which the Carpocratians claim to have. Clement admits to knowledge of a second secret or mystical version of the gospel, written by Mark for &quot;those being perfected&quot;. However, he asserts that the version promoted by the Carpocratians is not an accurate representation of this; they have corrupted the original with their own false additions. To illustrate this, two ostensibly genuine excerpts from the gospel are supplied. The letter breaks off abruptly as Clement begins to explain the passages.

==Controversy over authenticity==
Scholars Philip Jenkins and Robert M. Price noticed parallels between The Secret Gospel of Mark and a novel by James Hunter published in 1940 entitled &quot;The Mystery of Mar Saba&quot;. In 1980 the Mar Saba letter was included in the revision of the standard edition of works of Clement of Alexandria: Otto Stählin and Ursula Treu, &quot;Clemens Alexandrinus&quot;, vol. 4.1: Register, 2nd ed. (Berlin:Akademie-Verlag, 1980), XVII–XVIII.

Nevertheless, doubts have been expressed about its authenticity. In a 1975 review of Smith&#x27;s book, Quentin Quesnell raised doubts about the original manuscript and suggested that it was a forgery executed sometime between 1936 and 1958. Though Quesnell did not specifically accuse Smith, in the view of Charles W. Hedrick he &quot;broadly hinted&quot; that Smith was the culprit. When Quesnell wrote this, no scholar other than Smith had reported having seen the manuscript. 

In 2005 Stephen Carlson published &quot;Gospel Hoax: Morton Smith&#x27;s Invention of Secret Mark&quot;, which also asserted that the manuscript was a hoax. By this time independent confirmation of the manuscript&#x27;s existence and appearance had been presented by Hedrick and others; Carlson argued that Smith had himself written the text into the book.

Earlier in the same year, Scott G. Brown published &quot;Mark&#x27;s Other Gospel: Rethinking Morton Smith&#x27;s Controversial Discovery&quot;. In this book he wrote that the Secret Gospel of Mark was an authentic writing of the evangelist.

Many scholars who accept the letter as a copy of an ancient manuscript believe that it is not the work of the historical Clement. There seems to have been another pseudo-Clement, who was mentioned in the Decretum Gelasianum as &quot;the other Clement of Alexandria.&quot; The central element of initiation and progress to &quot;the innermost sanctuary of that truth hidden by seven veils&quot; is common to Gnostic writings and to the mystery religions of the period.

Whether the document is a forgery, and if so who the forger might be, remains unresolved.

<text>John Allen Paulos (born July 4, 1945) is an American professor of mathematics at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He has gained fame as a writer and speaker on mathematics and the importance of mathematical literacy. Paulos writes about many subjects, especially of the dangers of mathematical innumeracy; that is, the layperson&#x27;s misconceptions about numbers, probability, and logic.

==Early life==
Paulos was born in Denver, Colorado and grew up in Chicago, Illinois and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he attended high school. After his Bachelor of Mathematics at University of Wisconsin (1967) and his Master of Science at University of Washington (1968), he received his PhD in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1974). In an interview he described himself as lifelong skeptic. He volunteered for the Peace Corps in the seventies.

==Career==


His academic work is mainly in mathematical logic and probability theory.

His book &quot;Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences&quot; (1988) was a bestseller and &quot;A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper&quot; (1995) extended the critique. In his books Paulos discusses innumeracy with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more quantitative way.

He has also written on other subjects often &quot;combining disparate disciplines&quot;, such as the mathematical and philosophical basis of humor in &quot;Mathematics and Humor&quot; and &quot;I Think, Therefore I Laugh&quot;, the stock market in &quot;A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market&quot;, quantitative aspects of narrative in &quot;Once Upon a Number&quot;, the arguments for God in &quot;Irreligion&quot;, and most recently &quot;bringing mathematics to bear on...biography&quot; in &quot;A Numerate Life&quot;.

Paulos also wrote a mathematics-tinged column for the UK newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; and is a Committee for Skeptical Inquiry fellow.

Paulos has appeared frequently on radio and television, including a four-part BBC adaptation of &quot;A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper&quot; and appearances on the Lehrer News Hour, 20/20, Larry King, and David Letterman.

In 2001 Paulos taught a course on quantitative literacy for journalists at the Columbia University School of Journalism. The course stimulated further programs at Columbia and elsewhere in precision and data-driven journalism.

His long-running &quot;ABCNews.com&quot; monthly column &quot;Who&#x27;s Counting&quot; deals with mathematical aspects of stories in the news. All the columns over a 10- year period are archived here.

He is married, father of two, grandfather of four.

Paulos tweets frequently at @JohnAllenPaulos.

==Awards==
Paulos received the 2013 JPBM (Joint Policy Board for Mathematics) Award for Communicating Mathematics on a Sustained Basis to Large Audiences.

Paulos received the 2003 AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) Award for Promoting the Public Understanding of Science and Technology.

In 2002 he received the University Creativity Award at Temple University.

Paulos&#x27; article &quot;Counting on Dyscalculia,&quot; which appeared in Discover Magazine in 1994, won a Folio Award that year.

<text>Alma () is a Nephite prophet in the Book of Mormon. Initially a priest who serves in the court of King Noah, when a prophet named Abinadi preaches to the court Alma concurs with Abinadi and affirms that what the prophet said is true. For this, Noah banishes Alma and tries to have him killed. After leaving the court, Alma goes on to found a church among Noah&#x27;s subjects. He eventually leads these churchgoers out from Noah&#x27;s lands, through a sojourn under Lamanite rule, and to the land of Zarahemla, where their ancestors had come from a few generations earlier, where Alma becomes high priest of the Nephites&#x27; church.

Alma is sometimes referred to as Alma the Elder to avoid confusion with his son, also named Alma, who is often called Alma the Younger.

==Synopsis==
During the reign of King Noah in the land of Nephi, Alma is one of several priests in his service. When a prophet named Abinadi speaks before the court and condemns Noah and his people for their wickedness, Alma believes Abinadi and affirms that what Abinadi says about them is accurate. For this, Noah banishes Alma and tries to have him killed.

Alma escapes Noah&#x27;s agents and repents of his sins. In hiding, he writes down what Abinadi taught and propagates this gospel, organizing subsequent followers into a church that he founds. Alma gathers these followers to a place called the Waters of Mormon, where he secretly teaches them and baptizes them en masse. Alma and his church are discovered. Noah prepares an army to attack them. Knowing ahead of time about the impending attack, Alma and his followers flee, traveling into the wilderness, eventually settling in a land called Helam.

An army of Lamanites later discover and conquer Helam, subjugating with Alma his people, and appoint Amulon (a former priest of King Noah, alongside Alma) to oversee the occupation.

===Return to Zarahemla===

As the years passed, Alma and his people were discovered by the Lamanites and enslaved, placed under the authority of Amulon—a former priest of King Noah now united with the Lamanites—who began to persecute Alma&#x27;s people, “put[ting] tasks upon them, and put[ting] task-masters over them” (). Finally, Alma&#x27;s people escaped the Lamanites and were led by God through the wilderness for twelve days until they arrived in the land of Zarahemla, then the chief Nephite population center. The people of Alma joyfully united with the Nephites and helped to strengthen the church of Christ in Zarahemla. Zarahemla&#x27;s King Mosiah soon authorized Alma to serve as the first high priest over the Church in Zarahemla. Alma continued in this capacity for many years.

When Alma&#x27;s son, Alma the Younger, and the four sons of King Mosiah came of age they rebelled against the church and &quot;were numbered among the unbelievers&quot; (). However, as they went about to destroy the church an angel appeared and, in an experience similar to that of Saul on the road to Damascus, they were all converted. Like Saul, their subsequent efforts on behalf of the church overshadowed their previous efforts to destroy the church.

Before dying, Alma bestows leadership of the Nephite church to his son.

<doc id="595111" wikidata="Q2964809" url="?curid=595111" title="Chris Murphy (Canadian musician)">
<text>Christopher Michael Murphy (born November 7, 1968) is a Canadian musician and a member of the rock band Sloan.

==Early life==
Murphy was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. His family moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, where his father obtained a Ph.D. from the University of Virginia. He later moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he attended Halifax West High School and the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design.

==Musical career==
Murphy originally formed Sloan with Jay Ferguson. Murphy is the band&#x27;s primary bassist, occasionally switching to drums or guitar, and is one of the band&#x27;s two main singers; he sings lead on about 40 percent of the band&#x27;s songs and backup harmony vocals on most of the others.

Murphy has written several Sloan songs that have been released as singles, including &quot;Underwhelmed&quot; (from the album &quot;Smeared&quot;), &quot;Coax Me&quot; (from &quot;Twice Removed&quot;), &quot;G Turns to D&quot; (from &quot;One Chord to Another&quot;), &quot;She Says What She Means&quot; (from &quot;Navy Blues&quot;), &quot;The Other Man&quot; (from &quot;Pretty Together&quot;), and &quot;The Rest of My Life&quot; (from &quot;Action Pact&quot;).

In 1995, while Sloan was on a hiatus, Murphy toured and recorded as the drummer for The Super Friendz.

Murphy hosted a show on CBC Radio 3 with Sloan bandmate Jay Ferguson from December 2005 through November 2006. The show was also broadcast on Sirius Satellite Radio channel 94.

In 2010, Murphy served as a music performance supervisor for the film &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. The World&quot;, tasked with making sure the actors knew how to play their own instruments for the camera. One character, Young Neil, is seen wearing a Sloan t-shirt during one scene; another character, Todd Ingram, plays a red Fender Mustang Bass with white racing stripe, similar to Murphy&#x27;s.

In 2013, Murderecords released a 7-inch single by The Certain Someones, a supergroup featuring Chris Murphy, Matt Murphy of The Super Friendz, and Jale&#x27;s Jennifer Pierce.

In 2015, Murphy formed the supergroup Tuns with Matt Murphy and Mike O&#x27;Neill of The Inbreds.

In 2016, Murphy, along with Steven Page (Barenaked Ladies), Moe Berg (The Pursuit of Happiness), and Craig Northey (Odds), formed the group The Trans-Canada Highwaymen; they performed their first show in Niagara in July that year, and toured across Canada in 2017. Their live set consisted of cover songs by member&#x27;s bands (Sloan, Odds, Pursuit of Happiness, Barenaked Ladies).

In 2018, Murphy and his bandmates from Sloan set out on a 30-date tour in support of their twelfth album together.

In August 2019, it was announced that Murphy had formed a supergroup called Anyway Gang with Sam Roberts and members of Hollerado and Tokyo Police Club.

Murphy and Joel Plaskett collaborated on the production of &quot;Prize for Writing&quot;, a posthumous album by singer-songwriter Matthew Grimson, which was recorded in 1995 but not commercially released until 2020.

==Personal life==
Murphy and his girlfriend, Rebecca Mendoza, have two sons, Francisco and Santiago.

In July 2009, Murphy was hit by a car in a hit and run collision while riding his bicycle in Toronto, breaking his collarbone. The incident lent its name to Sloan&#x27;s subsequent release, the &quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot; EP.

On January 27, 2021, Murphy announced on Instagram that he was diagnosed with Bell&#x27;s palsy earlier that month. He was optimistic that he would fully recover in the months ahead.

<text>The Darla Moore School of Business is the official business school of the University of South Carolina. Founded in 1919, the Moore School is located in Columbia, South Carolina and currently enrolls over 5,500 undergraduate and 800 graduate students in degree-seeking programs, including bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctorate degrees. The school is well known for its consistent high rankings in its program for international business.

==History==
The University of South Carolina (USC) began efforts to open a school of commerce as early as 1914. USC founded the school in 1919 and dean George Olson firmly established the school by the early 1920s. The school grew with the university, and by 1958, the school established the Master of Business Administration program. By 1963, AACSB gave the school full accreditation.
The Professional Master of Business Administration (then called MBA-ETV) started in 1970. The Professional MBA program allows people in South Carolina to receive an MBA by taking part-time classes at remote locations and over the internet. Then in 1974 the school established its Master of International Business (MIBS). National publications hold the program in high esteem and the program continuously garners high rankings in international business.

In 1998, Wall Street financier and USC graduate Darla Moore donated $25 million to the business school. In her honor the school was renamed Darla Moore School of Business, although sometimes shortened to the Moore School.

The school combined its MIBS and MBA programs to form the International MBA program in 2002. The same year, the school started offering a specialization in international business for undergraduate students as a major.

On April 23, 2004 the Moore School announced another gift by Darla Moore. She donated $45 million with the challenge to the university to match that sum.

On September 22, 2011, the University of South Carolina broke ground on the new Darla Moore School of Business on Assembly Street next to the Carolina Coliseum. The new Darla Moore School of Business includes 35 classrooms and 136 offices for university faculty.

==Facilities==
In August 2014, the Moore School took occupancy of its new home located at the corner of Assembly and Greene streets in downtown Columbia, SC.

The main level houses a visitors&#x27; center, a cafe, a trading room, and an open-air courtyard.

==Academics==

===Rank and reputation===

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its 2021 annual survey &quot;America’s Best Colleges Guide&quot; ranked the Moore School&#x27;s undergraduate international business degree first in the United States. In the specialty of international business, the publication ranked the school No. 1 in the United States, a position the school has held for twenty-two years.

On the national level, in the latest ranking of graduate programs by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, the Moore School continued as the #1 American university in the international business category. The publication ranked the school #62 in the US in overall graduate business education. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; ranked the Moore School 49th out of 51 national business schools in a &quot;Regional Ranking&quot; in the September 20, 2007 edition of the &quot;Journal&quot;. In the 2010 QS Global 200 Business Schools Report, the Darla Moore School of Business was placed 28th in North America. In the 2010 Public Accounting Report, the Masters of Accounting program was ranked 25th in the country.

===Programs===

====Undergraduate====
After four years of study, undergraduate students finish their careers at the Darla Moore School of Business with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree. The program consist of 121 credit hours and combines a strong liberal arts background with practical business education. The core curriculum that every student studies includes marketing, management, finance and management science. After the core, usually in their junior year, students can choose a major or majors from the following areas: accounting, finance (corporate, investments, or financial services track), insurance and risk management, international business, management (entrepreneurship or human resources track), economics, marketing, management science (business information systems or global supply chain and operations management track), and real estate.

The Undergraduate International Business major at the Moore School solidifies its international business rankings.

====Graduate====

=====MBA programs=====
International MBA

The International Masters of Business Administration at the Darla Moore School of Business combines traditional business education with intensive language training in one of eight languages – Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, or Spanish. In addition to the language tracks, the global track allows students to study the business and cultural issues of regions around the world without learning a language other than English. All tracks are 20–22 months, with the exception of Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese, which require 29–34 months of study to give students added exposure to the more complex languages and cultures of these countries. Students may also volunteer with the Peace Corps during the IMBA program, extending the program length to approximately 48 months. Students must be accepted separately to the Peace Corps&#x27; Masters&#x27; International Program.

Students begin the program with an intensive core of business courses. The core lasts from July to December. In January, students begin language training in the country that natively speaks the language they are learning. Then around April 1, students begin a mandatory internship, ideally in the language they studied.

After their internships are completed, students in both the language and global tracks return to the Moore School to continue their business education. Students take elective classes during their final two semesters either at USC or they may choose to complete a one-semester exchange.

Professional MBA

The Moore School designed the Professional MBA program as a part-time, 28-month MBA program for working professionals. Students have the options of taking classes in 20 locations throughout SC and one location in Charlotte, NC. Some classes are also broadcast over South Carolina&#x27;s public television system, ETV. The professors that teach in the program are the same professors who teach full-time students.

=====Other programs=====
Master of Accountancy

The Master of Accountancy program is designed for students who have an undergraduate degree in accounting from an accredited university. It is open to anyone who satisfies the school&#x27;s admission standards regardless of their undergraduate major.

Master of Arts in Economics

Graduate course offerings in economics include business economics, human capital and manpower economics, quantitative economics, public finance, money and banking, economic history, economic theory, developmental economics, international economics, and industrial organization and public policy.

Masters of Human Resources

The MHR Program consists of 36 hours of course work plus a required six-hour internship. All internships are professional level, last at least eight weeks (most last 12 or more) and provide on-the-job experience in an actual human resources environment. Limited enrollment (approximately 30-35 new students per year) and small class size provide students with individualized attention.

Master of International Business

The Master of International Business Program is an interdisciplinary program that combines international business with international studies.

====Doctoral====
For those students who wish to enter academia, the Moore School offers two basic doctoral programs: Ph.D. in Business Administration and Ph.D. in Economics. These programs have a large amount of flexibility to suit the needs of each students. Graduates currently hold positions at University of Memphis, Cambridge University, Indiana University, University of Houston–Clear Lake, College of Charleston, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Furman University, East Carolina University, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, the International Monetary Fund, BellSouth, and Bank of America.

<doc id="595118" wikidata="Q1671978" url="?curid=595118" title="REV (disk)">
<text>REV is a removable hard disk storage system from Iomega, released in 2004.

The small removable disks store 35, 70, or 120 gigabytes (GB) and are hard-drive technology. Like a standard hard drive, the REV system uses a flying head to read and write data to a spinning platter. The removable disks contained the platter, spindle, and motor, while the drive heads and drive controller are contained within the REV drive. The drives allow for data transfer rates of about 25 megabytes (MB) per second.

The REV was available as an external desktop model with FireWire, SCSI or USB 2.0 interfaces, an internal model with SCSI, ATAPI, or SATA interfaces, or an external server model which features a cartridge autoloader and SCSI interface. Iomega also offered a 320 GB network-attached storage appliance which features a built-in REV. The drives are compatible with Macintosh, Windows, and Linux operating systems, although some only with particular models or interfaces.

This product, especially the server model, was marketed as a replacement of tape drive technology for enterprise data backup, with claims of higher reliability, greater speed, and random access capability.

The REV was in many ways a successor to Iomega&#x27;s Jaz drive, which uses a similar removable hard-disk-platter concept. However the Jaz design does not put the drive motor in the disk case.

The disks are formatted with the UDF file system on Windows and Unix/Linux. On Apple systems, they may be formatted as HFS+ or UDF in Mac OS X.

A &quot;seemingly&quot;-similar competing technology is RDX Technology. A key distinction, however, is that the REV drive heads and drive controller remain inside the drive when the hard-disk platter is removed from it. In RDX Technology, the drive heads are contained within the cartridge along with the platter and are removed along with it.

The drives suffer from poor reliability and high failure rates of both the disk mechanism and power supply units (on the external versions). Faced with cheaper, smaller, higher capacity and more reliable USB 2.5&quot; portable hard drives, the REV format was discontinued:
* 35 GB - August 31, 2009
* 70 GB - December 14, 2009
* 120 GB - January 25, 2010

<text>Samuel Joseph Byck (January 30, 1930 – February 22, 1974) was an American hijacker and attempted assassin. On February 22, 1974, he attempted to hijack a plane flying out of Baltimore/Washington International Airport, intending to crash into the White House in the hopes of killing President Richard Nixon. During the incident, Byck killed a policeman and a pilot, but was shot and wounded by another policeman before dying by suicide.

== Early life ==
Born to poor parents in South Philadelphia, Byck dropped out of high school in the ninth grade in order to support his impoverished family. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1954 and was honorably discharged in 1956. He married shortly thereafter, and fathered four children.

== Background ==
In 1972, Byck began to suffer from severe bouts of depression after his wife divorced him and he had several job-related financial failures. He admitted himself to a psychiatric ward, for a two-month stay. Byck began to harbor the belief that the Nixon administration was conspiring to oppress the poor.

Byck came to the notice of the Secret Service in 1972, when he threatened Nixon, whom he had resented since the Small Business Administration had turned down his loan application. Byck had also sent tape recordings to various Jewish public figures (including scientist Jonas Salk, Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut, and composer Leonard Bernstein) and had tried to join the Black Panthers. The Secret Service considered Byck to be harmless, and no action was taken at that time.

== Assassination attempt ==
In early 1974, Byck made his decision to assassinate Nixon and started to stalk him and follow his movements via news outlets. He planned to assassinate Nixon by hijacking an airliner and crashing it into the White House on a day when Nixon would be there. It has been suggested (for instance, by the 2004 film dramatization of his life) that Byck was inspired by news reports of the landing at the White House by U.S. Army soldier Robert K. Preston in a stolen UH-1B Huey helicopter on February 17.

Because he was already known to the Secret Service and his legal attempts to purchase a firearm might have resulted in increased scrutiny, Byck stole a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 17 .22-caliber revolver from his friend to use in the hijacking. Byck also made a bomb out of two gallon containers of gasoline and an igniter. All through this process, Byck made audio recordings explaining his motives and his plans; he expected to be considered a hero for his actions and wanted to fully document his reasons for the assassination.

On Friday morning, February 22, 1974, Byck drove to the Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Shortly after 7:00 a.m. EST, he shot and killed Maryland Aviation Administration policeman George Neal Ramsburg before storming a DC-9, Delta Air Lines Flight 523 to Atlanta, which he chose because it was the closest flight that was ready to take off. Pilots Reese Loftin and Fred Jones immediately complied with Byck&#x27;s orders and calmly tried to reassure him that they would cooperate. Loftin told Byck they could not take off with the doors to the aircraft open, and then alerted the control tower and summoned police assistance while Byck left to close them. After the pilots told him they still could not take off until wheel blocks were removed, he shot them both and grabbed a nearby passenger, ordering her to &quot;fly the plane&quot;. Jones died as he was being removed from the aircraft after the event was concluded; Loftin survived the attack. Byck told a flight attendant to close the door, or he would blow up the plane. An Anne Arundel County Police Department officer attempted to shoot the tires of the aircraft to prevent its takeoff, but the bullets fired from their police-issued revolvers failed to penetrate the aircraft&#x27;s tires and ricocheted, some hitting the wing of the plane.

After a standoff between Byck and police on the jetway, Anne Arundel County police officer Charles Troyer fired four shots through the aircraft door at Byck with a .357 Magnum revolver taken from the dead Ramsburg. Two of the shots penetrated the thick window of the aircraft door and wounded Byck; before the police could gain entry to the plane, Byck shot himself fatally in the head.

Byck lived for a few minutes, dying after saying &quot;help me&quot; to one of the policemen who entered the plane after he had been shot. A briefcase containing the gasoline bomb was found under his body. The plane never left the gate, and Nixon&#x27;s schedule was not affected by the assassination attempt, although he was in the White House at the time.

It was subsequently discovered that Byck had sent a tape recording detailing his plan, which he called &quot;Operation Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, to news columnist Jack Anderson. A review of records disclosed that Byck had been arrested twice for protesting in front of the White House without a permit and that he later dressed in a Santa Claus suit for another protest. Loftin, the flight&#x27;s captain, recovered and resumed flying airliners several years later.

In 1987, the Federal Aviation Administration produced a document entitled &quot;Troubled Passage: The Federal Aviation Administration During the Nixon–Ford Term 1973–1977&quot;, which mentioned Byck&#x27;s failed hijacking: &quot;though Byck lacked the skill and self-control to reach his target, he had provided a chilling reminder of the potential of violence against civil aviation. Under a more relaxed security system, his suicidal rampage might have begun when the airliner was aloft.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Byck was buried at the Mount Jacob Cemetery in Glenolden, Pennsylvania.

After Byck&#x27;s failed assassination attempt and subsequent death, he faded into relative obscurity except among members of security organizations; one of the long-term consequences of Byck&#x27;s failed hijacking was that it helped spur, along with several other failed and successful hijackings, the implementation of new security measures for airlines and airports.

The &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot; mentioned Byck&#x27;s attempted assassination of Nixon on page 561 in note 21:

== In popular culture ==
Byck is one of the (failed) assassins portrayed in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s and John Weidman&#x27;s 1991 musical &quot;Assassins&quot;. His role in the musical is built largely around his tapes sent to Leonard Bernstein and other public figures, which he is depicted recording during two scene-length monologues, the first addressed to Bernstein and the second to Nixon himself. Byck also wears a Santa Claus suit throughout the play in reference to an incident where he did so while protesting Nixon on Christmas Eve in 1973.

A film based on his story, &quot;The Assassination of Richard Nixon&quot;, was released in 2004. The film starred Sean Penn as Bicke (the surname spelling having been changed).

<doc id="595121" wikidata="Q898835" url="?curid=595121" title="Dutch process cocoa">
<text>Dutch processed cocoa, Dutched cocoa, or alkalized cocoa, is cocoa solids that have been treated with an alkalizing agent to reduce the natural acidity of cocoa, giving it a less bitter taste (and darker colour) compared to &quot;natural cocoa&quot; extracted with the Broma process. It forms the basis for much of modern chocolate, and is used in ice cream, hot chocolate, and baking.

Alkalizing agents employed vary, but include potassium carbonate (E501), sodium carbonate (E500), and/or sodium hydroxide (E525).

Dutching greatly reduces the levels of certain phytochemicals in cocoa.

== History ==
The Dutch process was developed in the early 19th century by Dutch chocolate maker Coenraad Johannes van Houten, whose father Casparus was responsible for the development of the method of removing fat from cocoa beans by hydraulic press around 1828, forming the basis for cocoa powder. These developments greatly expanded the use of cocoa, and reduced the oiliness that was previously associated with cocoa.

== Colour ==
The quantity of alkalizing agent is not specified on the ingredients on cocoa powder. However, this may be estimated by comparing the brown shades between different products. Higher quantities of alkalizing agents will produce cocoa that is darker than cocoa with lower quantities.

== Cooking properties ==
Dutch processed cocoa has a neutral pH, and is not acidic like natural cocoa, so in recipes that use sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) as the leavening agent (which relies on the acidity of the cocoa to activate it), an acid must be added to the recipe, such as cream of tartar or the use of buttermilk instead of fresh milk. There is no need to add acidity when Dutch processed cocoa is used in recipes that use baking powder instead of soda for leavening.

==Reduction of phytochemicals==

===Caffeine===
Dutched cocoa contains 3 times less caffeine:
* 100 grams unsweetened cocoa powder processed with alkali contains 78 mg.
* 100 grams unsweetened cocoa powder without alkali (un-dutched) contains 230 mg.

===Antioxidants and flavonols===
Compared to other processes, Dutch process cocoa contains lower amounts of flavonols (antioxidants). The effect this has on nutritional value is disputed. Professor Irmgard Bitsch of the Institut für Ernährungswissenschaft, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen claims that the reduction of antioxidants due to the process is not significant and enough polyphenols and procyanidins remain in the cocoa. One study determined that 60% of natural cocoa&#x27;s original antioxidants were destroyed by light dutching and 90% were destroyed by heavy dutching. Natural cocoa has such high levels of antioxidants that even a 60% reduction leaves it high on the list of antioxidant-rich foods.

<doc id="595133" wikidata="Q336668" url="?curid=595133" title="Johan Svendsen">
<text>Johan Severin Svendsen (30 September 184014 June 1911) was a Norwegian composer, conductor and violinist. Born in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway, he lived most of his life in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Svendsen&#x27;s output includes two symphonies, a violin concerto, a cello concerto, and the Romance for violin, as well as a number of Norwegian Rhapsodies for orchestra. At one time Svendsen was an intimate friend of the German composer Richard Wagner and Icelandic composer Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson.

==Life==
Svendsen&#x27;s father was a music teacher and military bandmaster, who taught him both the violin and clarinet. He began playing in orchestras at age nine when he learned violin, and began composing by age eleven. At fifteen he enlisted in the military band at Akershus Fortress, playing clarinet, flute, trombone, and percussion among other instruments. By the time he finished school, he was working as an orchestral musician, and occasionally made short concert tours as a violinist. In Lübeck, on one of his tours, he came to the attention of a wealthy merchant who made it possible for him to study from 1863 to 1867 at the Leipzig Conservatory. He began his studies with Ferdinand David, but problems with his hand forced him to switch to composition, which he studied with Carl Reinecke. He completed his studies in Leipzig in 1867, receiving first prize in composition. During this period, Svendsen had a son out of wedlock, Johann Richard Rudolph (1867–1933).

Gradually his attention turned to conducting. After spending time in Paris (1868–70) and Leipzig (1870–72), he returned to Christiania. One of his students in Christiania was pianist Bertha Tapper. In the summer of 1871, he went to New York City to marry Sarah (Sally, later changed to Bergljot) Levett Schmidt, whom he had met in Paris. He was conductor of the Musical Society Concerts in Christiania (1872–77), then spent three years in Germany, Italy, England and France. He returned to teach and conduct in Kristiania (1880–1883). In 1883, he was appointed principal conductor of the Royal Theater Orchestra in Copenhagen, where he lived until his death.

In 1884, he and his wife separated, and she moved to Paris. Their relationship had been chaotic for several years. A famous anecdote would have it that in 1883, in a fit of anger, she had thrown the only copy of his Symphony No. 3 in the fire. This incident was used by Henrik Ibsen in &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;. If anything was caught up in the fire at all, it is rather unlikely it was anything near a complete symphony. However, some sketches, most likely for a symphony, were found by conductor Bjarte Engeset in 2007. They were elaborated and orchestrated by Bjørn Morten Christophersen and premiered by the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra and Engeset in 2011. 

Following a divorce from Sarah (10 December 1901), he married (23 December 1901) Juliette Haase, with whom he had been living and had three children. His younger son from this marriage was the famous Danish actor Eyvind Johan-Svendsen (1896–1946).

In stark contrast to his more famous contemporary and close friend, Edvard Grieg, Svendsen was famous for his skill of orchestration rather than that of harmonic value. While Grieg composed mostly for small instrumentation, Svendsen composed primarily for orchestras and large ensembles. His most famous work is his &quot;Romance&quot; for violin and orchestra, Op. 26. He was very popular in Denmark and Norway during his lifetime, both as a composer and a conductor, winning many national awards and honors. However this popularity did not translate into acceptance into the international repertory of classical music. He died in Copenhagen, aged 70.

Svendsen&#x27;s first published work, the String Quartet in A minor, Op. 1, achieved great popular success. He quickly followed with the String Octet, Op. 3 and String Quintet, Op. 5, both of which added to his early fame. All of Svendsen&#x27;s chamber music was written while he was at the Leipzig Conservatory, yet these works are not considered student works. By general consensus, Svendsen was regarded as one of the most talented students then at the Conservatory. His works won prizes and received public performances to much acclaim.

<text>Nova Gradiška is a town located in the Brod-Posavina County of Croatia, population 14,229 (2011). It is located in the historic region of Slavonia, near the border to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The first word in the name means &quot;New&quot;, and there&#x27;s also an &quot;Old&quot; Gradiška nearby, the village of Stara Gradiška and the Bosnian town of Gradiška.

==History==

Nova Gradiška is often referred to as &quot;The Youngest Town&quot;.

The town of Nova Gradiška was founded in 1748 as an outpost in the Military Frontier and was first named Friedrichsdorf in German. Already in 1750 it was renamed Neu-Gradischka which later became Nova Gradiška in Croatian. The Hungarian name is Újgradiska.

Before 1881, Nova Gradiška (named &quot;NEU-GRADISKA&quot; before 1850) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia after the compromise of 1867), in the Slavonian Military Frontier, Gradiskaner Regiment N°VIII.

The first building constructed was the church of Saint Tereza, which is an important monument of baroque architecture in Slavonia. The old core of the town comprises the church of Saint Terezija and the old court house and prison from the 18th century.

Between 1881 and 1918, Nova Gradiška was a district capital in the Požega County of the Kingdom.

==Communications==
The town is located on the M104 railway line, frequently served by passenger trains at the local Nova Gradiška railway station. The A3 motorway also passes nearby. The highway and railway are part of the Pan European corridor X. Bus traffic within the town as well as suburban traffic is very well developed. There is also a connection to Požega via the D51 road and the nearby border crossing to Bosnia and Herzegovina, located in Stara Gradiška.

==Settlements==
The administrative area of Nova Gradiška includes the following settlements:
* Kovačevac, population 669
* Ljupina, population 987
* Nova Gradiška, population 11,821
* Prvča, population 752

==Politics==
===Minority councils===
Directly elected minority councils and representatives are tasked with consulting tasks for the local or regional authorities in which they are advocating for minority rights and interests, integration into public life and participation in the management of local affairs. At the 2023 Croatian national minorities councils and representatives elections Serbs of Croatia fulfilled legal requirements to elect 15 members minority councils of the Town of Nova Gradiška.

==Tourism==
Here are several hotels and other tourist resorts present. The Tourist board is also present and well developed in Nova Gradiška. There are a number of townfaires. Some of the most important ones are:

* Carnival festivities &quot;Pokladne svečanosti&quot;
* Flower show &quot;Izložba cvijeća&quot;
* The Folklore Show (&quot;međužupanijska smotra folklora&quot;)

* Fishfaire (&quot;fišijada&quot;)

==Religion==
Maria Theresa granted the rights for construction of the Roman Catholic Chapel of Teresa of Ávila in Nova Gradiška in 1756. The church was damaged by the forces of the Republic of Serbian Krajina during the Croatian War of Independence. In the 19th century the new Church of Virgin Mary on the town square was initiated. Aulic Council prevented the authorities of the Slavonian Military Frontier from destroying the church with intention to build a school at its place.

Historically, there were also two Serbian Orthodox Churches in Nova Gradiška, one of them destroyed during World War II and one during the Croatian War of Independence. Those were the Church of Saint Nicholas and the Church of the Holy Trinity. The Church of the Holy Trinity was the central orthodox church located at the town square. It was erected in 1824 at the spot of an earlier wooden church from 1755. The church was destructed by the Ustasha regime in 1941. The new neo-Byzantine Church of the Holy Trinity was complete in 1982 but it was detonated 9 times and destroyed during the Croatian War of Independence. The second church of Saint Nicholas was constructed in 1818 on the local cemetery, it was reconstructed in 1866 but it was also destroyed during the Croatian War of Independence.

==Local electronic media==
Croatian Radio Nova Gradiška () is the local radio station.

<text>Olympic Stadium is the name usually given to the main stadium of an Olympic Games. An Olympic stadium is the site of the opening and closing ceremonies. Many, though not all, of these venues actually contain the words &quot;Olympic Stadium&quot; as part of their names, such as stadiums in Amsterdam, Berlin, Helsinki and Paris. Olympic Stadium may also be named a multi-purpose stadium which hosts Olympic sports.

In the case of the Summer Olympic Games, athletics competitions and the football final are traditionally held in the Olympic Stadium. Exceptions to this have occurred though at the 1900, 1996, 2012, 2016, and 2024 Summer Olympics as well as at the 2010 and 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games.

Early Winter Olympic Games often used figure skating venues as focal points. These were often designated as the Olympic Stadium, usually hosting the opening and closing ceremonies.

A number of stadiums have been used in more than one Olympics in cities that have held the Games more than once. For instance, Lysgårdsbakken was the main stadium of a Winter Olympics and a Winter Youth Olympic Games (YOG). Bergiselschanze was the main stadium of two Winter Olympics and one Winter YOG. Olympiahalle jointly shared the Olympic Stadium role with Bergiselschanze during the two Winter Olympics, but not during the Winter YOG.

Only one stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, has been the main stadium of two Summer Olympics, and it is going to be the main stadium a record third time in the 2028 Games. In addition to the inaugural Summer Olympics, the Panathinaiko Stadio was also the main stadium of the only Intercalated Games held. The National Stadium in Tokyo was the main stadium that hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics (the first in Asia), but the 2020 Games was hosted in a new stadium on the same site. Beijing National Stadium was the main stadium of two Olympics, but with a special distinction: it was the only stadium to have been such at both a Summer and a Winter Olympics opening and closing ceremonies.

A number of stadiums have hosted events at subsequent Olympics. In the 2004 Athens Games, the Panathinaiko Stadio hosted the archery competition and was the finish of both women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s marathon events. The Vélodrome de Vincennes, the main stadium of the 1900 Summer Olympics, was the track cycling venue of the 1924 Paris Games. Similarly, the Stade Yves-du-Manoir, the 1924 Games main stadium, was used for the field hockey tournaments at the 2024 Summer Olympics. The London Games of 2012 were not opened and closed at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium, the site of the 1948 Olympic Stadium, but instead at a new stadium in Stratford. Wembley was, however, the venue for some 2012 Olympic football matches, including both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s finals. Likewise, the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which was the centrepiece stadium for the 1956 games, later hosted the first games of the Sydney 2000 football tournament. Lake Placid&#x27;s 1932 Olympic Stadium was utilized in the 1980 Lake Placid games as the speed skating venue. Olympiahalle hosted figure skating and short-track speed skating during the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics. Stockholm Olympic Stadium hosted equestrian events for the 1956 Summer Olympics (while the 1956 Games were held in Melbourne, Australia, quarantine restrictions prevented equestrian events from being held domestically, thus Stockholm, Sweden hosted the 1956 equestrian competitions).

<doc id="595142" wikidata="Q7068015" url="?curid=595142" title="Nuclear War (card game)">
<text>Nuclear War is a collectible common-deck card game designed by Douglas Malewicki and originally published in 1965 that is a satirical simulation of an end-of-the-world scenario fought mostly with nuclear weapons. It is currently (as of 2012) published by Flying Buffalo, and has inspired several expansions. 

==Development==
Doug Malewicki designed the game in 1964. The game was rereleased in the late 1970s by Flying Buffalo, which released the two expansion sets &quot;Nuclear Escalation&quot; and &quot;Nuclear Proliferation&quot;. During the late 1990s, Flying Buffalo also released a 47 card set in randomized shrinkwrapped booster packs covered by a title card.

== Gameplay ==
The game is a multiplayer game, with each player having a small cardboard playmat upon which cards are placed and revealed. It is intended to be played by 3 or more players, but can also be played with only 2.

At the start of a game, each player is dealt a number of &quot;population cards,&quot; ranging in denomination from 1 million to 25 million people. Players must protect their population, as the total loss of population leads to player elimination. They are then dealt a number of cards, which may be of the following types:

*Secrets which usually steal or reduce another player&#x27;s population.
*Propaganda which steal another player&#x27;s population, but have no effect once war has started.
*Delivery Systems usually missiles and bombers, which stay in play ready to hold a warhead. Later expansion sets add submarines and other options.
*Warheads which are fitted to a Delivery System, or discarded if there is not one available for them.
*Specials which are usually defensive cards to shoot down incoming missiles, or cards to increase the devastation caused by attacks.

Initially, players take turns playing secrets. Once all players have played all secrets and replaced cards from the deck they can announce &#x27;no secrets&#x27; and place two cards face down. Players then take turns during which they will play a third face-down card, and then reveal the oldest face-down card (first in, first out) and resolve it. Secrets and propaganda cards are resolved immediately upon being exposed, while missile launches take more than one turn to properly set up.

The game begins in a Cold War, in which no one is yet at war and propaganda cards have full effect. Once players have a warhead fitted to a delivery system (for example by revealing a missile on one turn, then revealing a warhead on their next turn), they must launch an attack. When someone launches an attack, the threat of war is imminent. If the attack is successful, resulting in a nuclear detonation, (regardless if actual appreciable loss of life takes place) &quot;war is declared,&quot; the Cold War is over, and propaganda cards are now worthless until a player is eliminated, at which time the Cold War resumes.

A truly successful attack reduces the target player&#x27;s population; (bomb shelters and other civil defenses may mitigate against this); when a player&#x27;s population reaches zero due to nuclear war, they may launch an immediate retaliatory attack (called &quot;final retaliation&quot;) but they are noted as defeated. Often, a final retaliation will end another player&#x27;s game, leading to a final retaliation by that player, and so on. Hence, in some cases, many players can be defeated in a series of tragedy in a single turn (via this mutual assured destruction method). If a player is knocked out with a propaganda card, no retaliation is allowed. However, if a player is eliminated by a secret while war is not declared, final retaliation is allowed.

The object of the game is to be the sole player remaining after all attacks are resolved. More often, final retaliation strikes remove all players in a chain reaction. Also, if the one and only 100-megaton bomb is exploded full force (not a &quot;MIRV&quot; device) and strikes a nuclear stockpile (very unlikely), a chain reaction ensues that destroys all life on the planet: everybody loses. If all players are eliminated from play, then there is no winner. Alternatively, a variant scoring system has been developed that determines a winner via a point system — 1 point for a knock out, 2 points for a propaganda knock out, 3 points for a retaliation knock out, a variable number of points for position depending on number of players, and finally 2 points for surviving (with the survivor not necessarily being the points winner). This point system is seen by some game enthusiasts as a betrayal of the original sense of purpose for this game: to illustrate that nuclear war is a winless proposition no matter what.

The delivery systems in the game reflect some of those in the American arsenal at the time each set was released, including the Polaris, Atlas and Saturn rockets. Other available delivery systems include the XB-70 Valkyrie deep penetration bomber, which had been cancelled several years prior to the base game&#x27;s release, but which had two operational prototypes at the time; and the Convair B-58 Hustler, out of service for 35 years by the time it was introduced in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;.

== Expansions ==
Flying Buffalo has released a number of expansions, many of which can be played separately or with the original game. Each expansion highlights the worries of the end-of-the-world scenarios—including actual, theoretical, and feared weapons—at the time of their releases.

;&quot;Nuclear Escalation&quot; (1983): Adds deterrents and defensive capabilities, space platforms, the &quot;glow-in-the-dark nuclear death die&quot;, and more.
;&quot;Nuclear Proliferation&quot; (1992): Each player now represents a different country with unique special powers. Adds submarines, atomic cannons, and more.
;&quot;Nuclear War Booster Packs&quot; (1995): Packs of 8 random cards from a set of 47 new cards.
;&quot;Nuclear War Bonus Pack #1&quot;: 9 new countries, warhead cards, a set of population cards, a bumper sticker, and a player assistance chart.
;&quot;Nuclear War Bonus Pack #2 — India/Pakistan War Variant&quot; (1999): Combines the &quot;Nuclear War&quot; game with the &quot;India Rails&quot; game.
;&quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot; (2004): More cards for the game including new cards usable as either a missile or a warhead and a Deluxe Population deck featuring characters from &quot;Nodwick&quot;, &quot;Kenzer &amp; Company&quot; and &quot;Dork Tower&quot;.
;&quot;Nuclear War Bonus Pack #3&quot;: Same as Bonus Pack #1 but with new style of deluxe population cards from &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;.

==Reception==
In the December 1980 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 34), Steve Jackson commented, &quot;This is NOT an &#x27;introductory&#x27; wargame – it&#x27;s not a wargame at all. It&#x27;s a card game. Recommended for a quick social game or for when everyone is too sleepy to play anything complex.&quot;

In the December 1993 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 200), Allen Varney considered &quot;Nuclear War&quot; a classic. &quot;It’s a sin for a multi-player design to throw out a player before the game is over, but in this venerable game, that’s the whole point.&quot;

&quot;Scrye&quot;, in 2003, described it as a &quot;classic off-color game&quot;. Though its popularity had waned by the 1990s, they noted &quot;it&#x27;s still one of the best card games out there.&quot;

*&quot;Nuclear Proliferation&quot; - Origins Award for &quot;Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame of 1992&quot;
*&quot;Nuclear War&quot; - inducted into the Origins Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame

In 1999 &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named &quot;Nuclear War&quot; as one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Best Card Games&quot;. Editor Scott Haring said &quot;Back when people were well-and-truly scared of the possibility of nuclear vaporization (I guess today either the threat is lessened, or it&#x27;s become old hat), &quot;Nuclear War&quot; dared to make fun the possibility of mankind&#x27;s dreaded nightmare via a card game.&quot;

<doc id="595145" wikidata="Q185662" url="?curid=595145" title="Dry distillation">
<text>Dry distillation is the heating of solid materials to produce gaseous products (which may condense into liquids or solids). The method may involve pyrolysis or thermolysis, or it may not (for instance, a simple mixture of ice and glass could be separated without breaking any chemical bonds, but organic matter contains a greater diversity of molecules, some of which are likely to break).

If there are no chemical changes, just phase changes, it resembles classical distillation, although it will generally need higher temperatures. Dry distillation in which chemical changes occur is a type of destructive distillation or cracking.

==Uses==
The method has been used to obtain liquid fuels from coal and wood. It can also be used to break down mineral salts such as sulfates () through thermolysis, in this case producing sulfur dioxide (SO2) or sulfur trioxide (SO3) gas which can be dissolved in water to obtain sulfuric acid. By this method sulfuric acid was first identified and artificially produced. When substances of vegetable origin, e.g. coal, oil shale, peat or wood, are heated in the absence of air (dry distillation), they decompose into gas, liquid products and coke/charcoal. The yield and chemical nature of the decomposition products depend on the nature of the raw material and the conditions under which the dry distillation is done. Decomposition within a temperature range of 450 °C to about 600 °C is called carbonization or low-temperature degassing. At temperatures above 900 °C, the process is called coking or high-temperature degassing. If coal is gasified to make coal gas or carbonized to make coke then coal tar is among the by-products.

===Wood===
When wood is heated above 270 °C it begins to carbonize. If air is absent, the final product (since there is no oxygen present to react with the wood) is charcoal. If air (which contains oxygen) is present, the wood will catch fire and burn when it reaches a temperature of about 400–500 °C and the fuel product is wood ash. If wood is heated away from air, first the moisture is driven off. Until this is complete, the wood temperature remains at about 100–110 °C. When the wood is dry its temperature rises, and at about 270 °C, it begins to spontaneously decompose. This is the well known exothermic reaction which takes place in charcoal burning. At this stage evolution of the by-products of wood carbonization starts. These substances are given off gradually as the temperature rises and at about 450 °C the evolution is complete. The solid residue, charcoal, is mainly carbon (about 70%) and small amounts of tarry substances which can be driven off or decomposed completely only by raising the temperature to above about 600 °C.

In the common practice of charcoal burning using internal heating of the charged wood by burning a part of it, all the by-product vapors and gases escape into the atmosphere as smoke. The by-products can be recovered by passing the off-gases through a series of water to yield so-called wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid) and the non-condensible wood gas passes on through the condenser and may be burned to provide heat. The wood gas is only usable as fuel, and consists typically of 17% methane; 2% hydrogen; 23% carbon monoxide; 38% carbon dioxide; 2% oxygen and 18% nitrogen. It has a gas calorific value of about 10.8 MJ/m3 (290 BTU/cu.ft.) i.e. about one third the value of natural gas. When deciduous tree woods are subjected to distillation, the products are methanol (wood alcohol) and charcoal. The distillation of pine wood causes Pine tar and pitch to drip away from the wood and leave behind charcoal. Birch tar from birch bark is a particularly fine tar, known as &quot;Russian oil&quot;, suitable for leather protection. The by-products of wood tar are turpentine and charcoal.

Tar kilns are dry distillation ovens, historically used in Scandinavia for producing tar from wood. They were built close to the forest, from limestone or from more primitive holes in the ground. The bottom is sloped into an outlet hole to allow the tar to pour out. The wood is split into dimensions of a finger, stacked densely, and finally covered tight with dirt and moss. If oxygen can enter, the wood might catch fire, and the production would be ruined. On top of this, a fire is stacked and lit. After a few hours, the tar starts to pour out and continues to do so for a few days.

<text>Edward Latimer Beach Jr. (April 20, 1918 – December 1, 2002) was a United States Navy submarine officer and author.

During World War II, he participated in the Battle of Midway and 12 combat patrols, earning 10 decorations for gallantry, including the Navy Cross. After the war, he served as the naval aide to the President of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and commanded the first submerged circumnavigation.

Beach&#x27;s best-selling novel, &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot;, was made into the 1958 film of the same name. The son of Captain Edward L. Beach Sr. and Alice Fouché Beach, Beach Jr. was born in New York City and raised in Palo Alto, California.

==Naval career==
Beach was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1935 by Senator Hiram Johnson of California. Beach served as a regimental commander in his first class year. Beach was named as the midshipman who had done the most to promote naval spirit and loyalty in his regiment when he graduated second out of 576 in his class in 1939.

Beach was initially assigned to the heavy cruiser , before joining the newly recommissioned destroyer , which participated in the neutrality patrol in the Atlantic, the escort of the German passenger liner , the initial American occupation of Iceland, and convoy duty in the North Atlantic.

Beach was detached from &quot;Lea&quot; in September 1941 to undergo accelerated training at the Submarine Training School at the New London Submarine Base in Connecticut. He completed training, graduating first in his class, in December 1941 shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

===World War II===
During World War II, Beach served aboard the submarines and , and took command of just as the Pacific War was ending.

 After graduating from Submarine School, Beach was assigned to USS &quot;Trigger&quot; (SS-237), which was commissioned on January 30, 1942. Aboard &quot;Trigger&quot; Beach held several shipboard positions, including communications officer, engineering officer, navigator, co-approach officer, and executive officer. While aboard &quot;Trigger&quot;, he participated in the Battle of Midway and served on 10 war patrols. &quot;Trigger&quot; was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and the Navy Unit Citation during Beach&#x27;s time aboard her.

Beach was assigned to the new commissioned USS &quot;Tirante&quot; (SS-420) late in 1944. He served as executive officer under Lieutenant Commander George L. Street, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for a making a daring attack in a heavily defended Japanese harbor during &quot;Tirante&quot;″s first war patrol from March 3 to April 26, 1945. Beach received the Navy Cross for heroism during the same patrol and &quot;Tirante&quot; received the Presidential Unit Citation.

Beach assumed command of USS &quot;Piper&quot; (SS-409) at Pearl Harbor on June 25, 1945. &quot;Piper&quot; departed on her third war patrol on July 19 and entered the Sea of Japan on August 13. The war ended on August 14 and &quot;Piper&quot; was in Japanese waters when the formal surrender was signed on September 2 and started her return to Pearl Harbor the next day.

During World War II, Beach earned 10 decorations for gallantry, including the Navy Cross and three unit citations, and participated in 12 war patrols that damaged or sank 45 enemy vessels.

===Cold War===
In December 1945, Beach reported to the Department of the Navy to serve as the personal aide to Vice Admiral Louis E. Denfeld, the chief of the Bureau of Naval Personnel. In March 1947, he was attached to the Atomic Defense Section (OPNAV 36) under Rear Admiral William S. Parsons.

===USS &quot;Amberjack&quot;===
In May 1948, he was given command of , a GUPPY II modified submarine. &quot;Amberjack&quot; gained the nickname &quot;Anglejack&quot; because of its pioneering use of steep diving and surfacing angles, which was covered in the January 1950 edition of the &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine. During war games, &quot;Amberjack&quot; photographed the opposing task force&#x27;s flagship through its periscope and sent the admiral a copy inscribed with &quot;Regards from Ned Beach and the &quot;Amberjack&quot;.&quot;
===Joint Chiefs of Staff===
Beach&#x27;s tour as skipper of &quot;Amberjack&quot; was abbreviated as he was called to Washington to serve as naval aide to General Omar Bradley, the first Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in August 1949. In that post, Beach witnessed first hand the events surrounding the Revolt of the Admirals.

===USS &quot;Trigger&quot;===
Upon completing his tour of duty as Bradley&#x27;s aide in March 1951, Beach was named prospective commanding officer of the new , then under construction. Upon commissioning of &quot;Trigger II&quot;, which was named for lost during World War II, he became commanding officer of the second submarine to be completed in the new after World War II.

===The White House===
From 1953 to 1957, Beach was naval aide to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. As naval aide Beach was responsible for the management of Camp David, the White House Mess, and for the presidential yacht . Because Eisenhower had made a campaign promise to get rid of the presidential yacht, neither the efforts of Beach nor those of Mrs. Eisenhower were successful in dissuading him from that course of action. The elimination of &quot;Williamsburg&quot; proved to be a bureaucratic hassle for Beach and the Navy Department since &quot;Williamsburg&quot; was the funnel for all budgets and personnel for Camp David and the White House Mess. While working the White House, Beach volunteered to be the coordinator on the White House staff for all plans to protect the president in case of nuclear attack. Since the Secret Service in 1953 did not deem helicopter travel as safe, evacuating the president on short notice was planned by Beach via the Potomac River, several PT (patrol torpedo) boats and a high speed race down river to meet up with a waiting Navy ship. It was Beach who spearheaded the effort to get First Lady Mamie Eisenhower to christen , the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine, in 1954.

Beach was advanced to the rank of captain on October 1, 1956.

===USS &quot;Salamonie&quot;===
Beach left the White House in January 1957, and assumed command of , a fleet replenishment oiler, on March 15. He completed a deployment to the U.S. Sixth Fleet, operating in the Mediterranean Sea, in December 1957.


===USS &quot;Triton&quot;===
In January 1958, he attended the Navy&#x27;s training program for atomic reactors in order to qualify for his next command, , the nation&#x27;s fifth nuclear-powered submarine.

In November 1959, Beach took command of USS &quot;Triton&quot;, the only American nuclear-powered submarine to be equipped with two nuclear reactors. Departing New London on what was supposed to have been a &quot;shake-down&quot; cruise in February 1960, &quot;Triton&quot; began a 1960 circumnavigation of the Earth in 84 days without surfacing, covering over , an unprecedented feat. The route of &quot;Triton&quot; followed roughly that of Ferdinand Magellan in 1519–1522. The scientific and military significance of the &quot;Triton&quot; voyage was overshadowed by the U-2 Incident which broke just as USS &quot;Triton&quot; was returning.

For successfully completing its mission, &quot;Triton&quot; was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. At a special White House ceremony, Captain Beach was presented the Legion of Merit by President Eisenhower. Beach wrote about &quot;Triton&quot;″s voyage in his book &quot;Around the World Submerged: The Voyage of the Triton&quot;, published in 1962.

Following her post-shakedown availability, &quot;Triton&quot; deployed to European waters with the Second Fleet to participate in NATO exercises against British naval forces led by the aircraft carriers and under the command of Rear Admiral Sir Charles Madden. This deployment was culminated with a port visit to Bremerhaven, West Germany, the first visit by a nuclear-powered ship to a European port.

===Subron 8, National War College and OpNav===
After his tour in command of &quot;Triton&quot;, Beach commanded Submarine Squadron Eight from July 1961 to August 1962. He was next a student at the National War College, where he completed a course of study in July 1963. At the same time he earned a Master of Arts degree in international relations from George Washington University.

In May 1963, Eugene Parks Wilkinson and Beach were in competition for selection to rear admiral, and the board selected Wilkinson with Beach&#x27;s sincere congratulations.

From July 1963 to December 1966, Beach served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OpNav) preparing annual budget reports for Congress and preparing the Secretary of the Navy (Fred Korth, Paul B. Fay, and Paul H. Nitze) and the Chief of Naval Operations (George W. Anderson Jr. and David L. McDonald) for hearings before Congressional committees.

Beach retired from active duty with the rank of captain in 1966, after 27 years of service.

==Naval War College and Capitol Hill==
Beach retired from active duty in the Navy in 1966, and was appointed as the Stephen B. Luce Chair of Naval Science at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island – the first person to hold that position. During his tenure he was the editor of the &quot;Naval War College Review&quot;.

Subsequently, Beach served for seven years as staff director of the United States Senate Republican Policy Committee, and for one year as chief of staff for Senator Jeremiah Denton (R-Alabama).

==Author==

After World War II, Beach wrote extensively in his spare time, following his father, who was also a career naval officer and author. His first book, &quot;Submarine!&quot; (1952), was a compilation of accounts of several wartime patrols made by his own as well as other submarines, which &quot;Time&quot; magazine called &quot;the liveliest and most authentic account of underseas combat to come out of World War II.&quot;

In all, Beach published thirteen books, but is best known for his first novel, &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; (1955), which appeared on &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; bestseller list for several months. A movie of the same name, based loosely on the novel and starring Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster, was released by United Artists in 1958 (Beach was unhappy with the adaptation). Beach penned two sequels to &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot;: &quot;Dust on the Sea&quot; (1972), relating in detail a war patrol by &quot;Eel&quot; leading a wolfpack, and &quot;Cold is the Sea&quot; (1978), set in 1961 aboard a nuclear submarine.

In addition to &quot;Submarine!&quot;, Beach wrote several more books on naval history, including &quot;The Wreck of the Memphis&quot; (1966); &quot;United States Navy: 200 Years&quot; (1986), a general history of the Navy; &quot;Scapegoats: A Defense of Kimmel and Short at Pearl Harbor&quot; (1995); and &quot;Salt and Steel: Reflections of a Submariner&quot; (1999). &quot;Keepers of the Sea&quot; (1983) is a pictorial record of the modern navy with photography by Fred J. Maroon. For a number of years Beach was co-editor of &quot;Naval Terms Dictionary&quot; as that standard reference work passed through several editions. His last work, completed shortly before his death, was to prepare for publication his father&#x27;s manuscript of his own naval career, &quot;From Annapolis to Scapa Flow: The Autobiography of Edward L. Beach, Sr&quot; (2003).

In addition to his books, Beach was a prolific author of articles and book reviews for periodicals ranging from &quot;Blue Book&quot; to &quot;National Geographic&quot;, and &quot;Naval History&quot; to &quot;American Heritage&quot;.

<text>Chogo (died 214, r. 166–214) was the fifth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

==Background==
According to the history compilation &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, he was the son of the previous king Gaeru. He became king upon Gaeru&#x27;s death in 166 which was the 39th year of his reign.

Relations between Baekje and the rival kingdom Silla became hostile after Gaeru had given refuge to a Sillan traitor Gilseon in 165, shortly before Chogo inherited the throne.

==Reign==
Chogo began attacking Silla in 167, and captured two castles, but the Sillans drove him and his army off.

Chogo ran another campaign (188–190) against Silla, and captured several castles (Castles Mosan, Guyang, Wonsanhyang, and Yogeo). In 204, he destroyed Yocha. He also built new castles, including Castle Jeokhyeon and Sado, in captured territory, and settled people there in 210. The battles occurred around the Sobaek Mountains.

In 214, he waged war against the Mohe. He led 1.000 soldiers to capture Castle Seokmun of Mohe, but the Mohe counter-attacked in the Sulcheon region of Baekje. In July 214 Silla also invaded Baekje, and captured Castle Sahyeon.

Samguk sagi:
* 167 AD, autumn, seventh month. Troops secretly attacked two castles in Silla&#x27;s western district. He captured 1,000 men and women and then returned. Eighth month. The King of Silla dispatched Ilgilcan Heungseon at the head of 20,000 troops to come and invaded several castles in the east of the country. The Sillan King also personally led 8,000 spirited cavalrymen and accompanied Heungseon. They went as far as the Han river when the King of Baekje determined the Sillan host was impossible to repel and returned that which had been plundered earlier.
* 170 AD, spring, third month. On the last day of the month, there was a solar eclipse. Winter, tenth month. Troops were dispatched to invade the border with Silla.
* 186 AD, winter, tenth month. There were no clouds but there was lightning. A comet was seen in the northwest. It disappeared after 20 days.
* 187 AD, spring, fifth month. The wells of the capital and the Han River were all dry.
* 188 AD, spring, second month. Extensive repairs were made to the palace. Troops were dispatched to attack the Mosan Fortress () in Silla.
* 189 AD, spring, fourth month. On the first day of the month, there was a solar eclipse. Autumn, seventh month. Baekje troops fought with Silla Guyang. They were defeated and more than 500 died.
* 190 AD, spring, eighth month. Soldiers were dispatched to attack the district of Wonsan in the west of Silla. They advanced and surrounded Bugok Fortress. General Gudo of Silla then led 500 mounted troops to repel them, so Baekje forces feigned a retreat. Gudo pursued them to Wasan Fortress () where the troops turned and gave battle and had a great victory.
* 191 AD, autumn, ninth month. Chiugi (a type of comet) was seen in the horn and gullet constellations.
* 199 AD, autumn, seventh month. There was an earthquake. Troops were dispatched to attack the Sillan border.
* 204 AD, autumn, seventh month. Troops were dispatched to attack Yocha Fortress in Silla and sacked it. They killed the lord of the fortress, Seolbu. The King of Silla, Naehae of Silla, was furious and ordered Ibeolcan Rieum to become general and lead six squadrons of spirited troops to come and attack Baekje&#x27;s Saheyon Fortress. Winter, tenth month. A comet was seen in the Eastern well.
* 205 AD, autumn, seventh month. Venus intersected with the moon.
* 208 AD, autumn. Because of locusts and drought the crops did not mature. There were many incidents of thievery but the king consoled them.
* 209 AD, winter, tenth month. There was a typhoon that uprooted trees.
* 210 AD, spring, second month. The two fortresses of Jeokhyeon and Sado were built, and residents from the east were moved there. Winter, tenth month. The Malgal came and attacked Sado Fortress but were unable to take it. They burned down the fortress gate and then escaped.
* 211 AD, autumn, eighth month. In the south of the country locusts damaged the crops and the people starved. Winter, 11th month. There was no ice.
* 212 AD, summer, sixth month. On the last day of the month, there was a solar eclipse.
* 213 AD, autumn, seventh month. In the western district a man named Hoehoe caught a white deer and presented it to the King. The King deemed it a felicitous omen and gave him 100 stones of grain.
* 214 AD, autumn, ninth month. The King ordered Jin Gwa of the northern district to lead 1,000 soldiers to attack and take the Mohe castle of Seokmun. In the winter a powerful cavalry of Malgal came and attacked, coming as far as the Sul River. The King died.

==Legacy==
The 8th king Goi is said to be Chogo&#x27;s younger brother. The 13th king Geunchogo apparently took Chogo&#x27;s name to emphasize his lineage after a long rivalry between two royal factions.

** Brother: 8th King, Goi of Baekje (古爾王, ?–286) – before he became king he was known as Buyeo Goi (扶餘古爾).

<text>Elia Filippo Francesco Giuseppe Maria Millosevich (5 September 1848 in Venice, Austrian Empire – 5 December 1919 in Rome) was an Italian astronomer. He specialized in calculating the orbits of comets and asteroids, in particular 433 Eros.

He first studied at the University of Padua. His first papers, on the then-forthcoming 1874 and 1882 transits of Venus, attracted attention and got him the position of professor of nautical astronomy at the Reale Istituto di Marina Mercantile a Venezia (Venice Royal Institute of the Merchant Navy). In 1879, he was offered the position of deputy director of the Osservatorio del Collegio Romano (Observatory of the Collegio Romano), associated with the Ufficio Centrale di Meteorologia (Central Institute of Meteorology) in Rome, and from 1902 (following Pietro Tacchini&#x27;s resignation) until his death, he was its director.

For the calculation of the orbit of Eros, in 1898 and 1904 he was awarded the Prize for Astronomy (Premio per l’Astronomia) of the Italian Accademia dei Lincei. In 1911, he was awarded the Pontécoulant Prize (Prix Gustave de Pontécoulant) of the French Académie des sciences de Paris. He published over 450 smaller and larger works, and a large number of single observations of planets and comets.

In 2004, the main-belt asteroid 69961 Millosevich, discovered by the Italian astronomers Piero Sicoli and Francesco Manca, was named in his memory. The naming citation was published on July 13, 2004 ().

<doc id="595180" wikidata="Q218645" url="?curid=595180" title="Boeing WC-135 Constant Phoenix">
<text>The WC-135 Constant Phoenix is a special-purpose aircraft derived from the Boeing C-135 Stratolifter and used by the United States Air Force. Its mission is to collect samples from the atmosphere for the purpose of detecting and identifying nuclear explosions. It is also informally referred to as the &quot;weather bird&quot; or &quot;the sniffer&quot; by workers on the program and international media respectively.

==Operational history==
The WC-135 was introduced in December 1965, replacing Boeing WB-50 aircraft in the weather-reconnaissance and air-sampling mission. Ten aircraft were initially converted from C-135B transport aircraft and were placed in service with the 55th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron at McClellan Air Force Base, California, with the Military Airlift Command (MAC). Detachments were located at various bases throughout the United States and worldwide. Initially, the aircraft performed both weather reconnaissance and atmospheric sampling missions; however, in February 1974, the Air Force ordered that after 1 July 1974, WC-135s be used for atmospheric sampling missions only, thus ending the aircraft&#x27;s weather reconnaissance mission. The aircraft occasionally took on other roles throughout their careers; several aircraft were temporarily assigned to the 10th Airborne Command and Control Squadron at RAF Mildenhall in the late 1980s and early 1990s as training aircraft so that the unit could slow the accumulation of flight hours on its EC-135Hs, while others served as staff transports on an as-needed basis.

Upon retirement from frontline weather reconnaissance service in the early 1990s, five were retained for further use. Serial no. 61-2666 was converted to an NC-135 and remains in service as a testbed for RC-135 equipment upgrades. Serial no. 61-2667 was upgraded to a WC-135W, given the project name Constant Phoenix, and remains in service with the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. Serial no. 61-2674 was converted to the first OC-135B Open Skies observation aircraft, reentering service in 1993. It was later stored in 1997 and replaced with two additional aircraft also converted from WC-135s.

In 1998, a former EC-135C, serial no. 62-3582, was converted into a WC-135C, also designated Constant Phoenix.

In April 2018 it was announced that three KC-135R tanker aircraft would be converted as WC-135R Constant Phoenix aircraft to replace the two aircraft operated by the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron. The first aircraft was scheduled to be converted by L3 Technologies at Greenville, Texas starting in September 2019.

In November 2020, WC-135C, tail number 62-3582, was retired during a ceremony at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. During its 56 year career, it amassed 29,680 flight hours and 72,251 landings. During its retirement ceremony, the 55th Wing chaplain dubbed the aircraft &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Chariot&quot;, although the aircraft was never referred to by that name during its operational life.

In June 2022, the first of three planned WC-135R aircraft (serial number 64-14836) completed its maiden test flight, and was delivered to the 55th Wing on 11 July 2022. The other two were delivered in May 2023 (tail number 64-14831) and December 2023 (tail number 64-14829)

==Mission==
The WC-135B, WC-135W, and WC-135R Constant Phoenix atmospheric-collection aircraft support national-level intelligence consumers by collecting particulate debris and gaseous effluents from accessible regions of the atmosphere in support of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963. The information collected by the aircraft is utilized by Detachment 1 of the Air Force Technical Applications Center&#x27;s 21st Surveillance Squadron.

==Features==

The Constant Phoenix&#x27;s modifications are primarily related to the aircraft&#x27;s on-board atmospheric collection suite, which allows the mission crew to detect radioactive debris &quot;clouds&quot; in real time. The aircraft is equipped with external flow-through devices to collect particulates on filter paper and a compressor system for whole air samples collected in high-pressure holding spheres. Despite the different designations, both the C- and W-models carry the same mission equipment (with a front-end avionics suite similar to the RC-135V and W aircraft). In addition to its collection systems, the WC-135 is equipped with a variety of aircrew safety systems which detect ambient air inside the cabin to detect radiation which may have contaminated the inside of the cabin. The cabin also contains two sets of air filtration systems, known as the &quot;lungs&quot;, which filter all air entering the cabin of any hazardous contaminants. The WC-135R uses an improved next-generation collection suite as compared to the WC-135C/W, however the primary system functions are generally similar.

The interior seats 33 people, including the cockpit crew, maintenance personnel, and special equipment operators from the Air Force Technical Applications Center. On operational sorties, the crew is minimized to just pilots, navigator, and special-equipment operators, to reduce radiation exposure to mission-essential personnel only.

==Variants==
*WC-135B - 10 initial aircraft, converted from C-135Bs
*WC-135C - Converted from former Looking Glass EC-135C Tail Number 62-3582, carries the same equipment as WC-135W
*WC-135R - 3 converted KC-135Rs, announced in 2018 and included on the FY19 budget request. The first converted aircraft, Tail Number 64-14836, was delivered in July 2022.
*WC-135W - Re-designation of WC-135B Tail Number 61-2667 after upgrades and removal of flight engineer crew position in the 1990s.

==Operators==
* United States Air Force – Air Combat Command
**55th Wing – Offutt AFB, Nebraska
***45th Reconnaissance Squadron

===Vela Incident===
WC-135B aircraft flew 25 sorties in 1979 to try to ascertain whether a double flash in the South Atlantic that was detected by a Vela satellite was a nuclear weapons test; however, the result was inconclusive.

===North Korea===
On October 6, 2006, Japan&#x27;s Kyodo News agency reported that a US military aircraft, equipped to detect radiation from a nuclear test, took off from southern Japan. This was believed to be part of US efforts to prepare to monitor a North Korean nuclear test. On October 9, 2006, North Korea&#x27;s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that the country had performed a successful underground nuclear test. On October 13, 2006, CNN reported: &quot;The U.S. Air Force flew a WC-135 Constant Phoenix atmospheric collection aircraft on Tuesday to collect air samples from the region. A preliminary analysis of air samples from North Korea shows &#x27;radioactive debris consistent with a North Korea nuclear test&#x27;, according to a statement from the office of the top U.S. intelligence official. The statement, from the office of Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte, was sent to Capitol Hill but not released publicly. CNN obtained it from a congressional source. The national intelligence office statement said the air samples were collected Wednesday, and analysis found debris that would be consistent with a nuclear test &#x27;in the vicinity of Punggye&#x27; on Monday. The South Korean Defense Ministry told CNN that the United States has informed it that radioactivity has been detected.&quot; The aircraft was based at Offutt AFB and was sent to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa to operate during the sampling missions.

On June 17, 2009, JoongAng Daily reported, in reference to a purported May 25 nuclear test by North Korea: &quot;The U.S. Air Force twice dispatched a special reconnaissance jet, the WC-135 Constant Phoenix from Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan, to collect air samples.&quot;

On November 23, 2010, Sankei Shimbun reported that a WC-135 had been moved to Kadena Air Base in September 2010, in anticipation of a North Korean nuclear test.

On January 31, 2013, the WC-135W was reported to be conducting surveillance flights out of Kadena Air Base in anticipation of another North Korean nuclear test.

On January 6, 2016, the United States Air Force confirmed plans to soon deploy the WC-135 to test for radiation near North Korea to examine North Korea&#x27;s claim that they had successfully conducted a hydrogen-bomb test on January 5 (EST).

On September 8, 2016, it was reported that the WC-135 would soon begin surveillance flights near the Korean Peninsula after South Korean officials confirmed that North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test at approximately 0:30 UTC.

On April 12, 2017, it was deployed to Okinawa amid rising tensions with North Korea. North Korea conducted a missile test on April 3, 2017.

On May 19, 2017, two Chinese Su-30 fighter jets intercepted a WC-135 over the East China Sea, prompting a formal complaint from the Pentagon.

===Japan===
On March 17, 2011, CNN reported that the WC-135W had been deployed from Offutt AFB to Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. From there it assisted in detecting radioactive materials in the atmosphere around Japan, monitoring radioactivity released from the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant caused by the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami of March 11, 2011.

===Europe===
In 1986, multiple WC-135Bs were deployed to Europe to help monitor the air after the Chernobyl disaster.

On February 17, 2017, it was reported that the WC-135C had been deployed to RAF Mildenhall. It was conjectured that this came in response to several reports of anomalous levels of iodine-131 coming from the Norwegian-Russian Border, but as of April 10, 2017, there was no official cause of the iodine-131 release.

In late July and early August 2021 a WC-135W deployed to Europe and carried out measurements over the Baltic Sea and Sweden. A connection is suspected with the technical problems of the Russian Oscar-II-class submarine &quot;Orel&quot;, which subsequently had to be tugged back.

<text>Calcium sulfate (or calcium sulphate) is the inorganic compound with the formula CaSO4 and related hydrates. In the form of γ-anhydrite (the anhydrous form), it is used as a desiccant. One particular hydrate is better known as plaster of Paris, and another occurs naturally as the mineral gypsum. It has many uses in industry. All forms are white solids that are poorly soluble in water. Calcium sulfate causes permanent hardness in water.

==Hydration states and crystallographic structures==

The compound exists in three levels of hydration corresponding to different crystallographic structures and to minerals:
* (anhydrite): anhydrous state. The structure is related to that of zirconium orthosilicate (zircon): is 8-coordinate, is tetrahedral, O is 3-coordinate.
* (gypsum and selenite (mineral)): dihydrate.
* (bassanite): hemihydrate, also known as plaster of Paris. Specific hemihydrates are sometimes distinguished: α-hemihydrate and β-hemihydrate.

==Uses==

The main use of calcium sulfate is to produce plaster of Paris and stucco. These applications exploit the fact that calcium sulfate which has been powdered and calcined forms a moldable paste upon hydration and hardens as crystalline calcium sulfate dihydrate. It is also convenient that calcium sulfate is poorly soluble in water and does not readily dissolve in contact with water after its solidification.

===Hydration and dehydration reactions===

With judicious heating, gypsum converts to the partially dehydrated mineral called bassanite or plaster of Paris. This material has the formula CaSO4·(&quot;n&quot;H2O), where 0.5 ≤ &quot;n&quot; ≤ 0.8. Temperatures between are required to drive off the water within its structure. The details of the temperature and time depend on ambient humidity. Temperatures as high as are used in industrial calcination, but at these temperatures γ-anhydrite begins to form. The heat energy delivered to the gypsum at this time (the heat of hydration) tends to go into driving off water (as water vapor) rather than increasing the temperature of the mineral, which rises slowly until the water is gone, then increases more rapidly. The equation for the partial dehydration is:

: CaSO4 · 2 H2O   →   CaSO4 · H2O + H2O↑

The endothermic property of this reaction is relevant to the performance of drywall, conferring fire resistance to residential and other structures. In a fire, the structure behind a sheet of drywall will remain relatively cool as water is lost from the gypsum, thus preventing (or substantially retarding) damage to the framing (through combustion of wood members or loss of strength of steel at high temperatures) and consequent structural collapse. But at higher temperatures, calcium sulfate will release oxygen and act as an oxidizing agent. This property is used in aluminothermy. In contrast to most minerals, which when rehydrated simply form liquid or semi-liquid pastes, or remain powdery, calcined gypsum has an unusual property: when mixed with water at normal (ambient) temperatures, it quickly reverts chemically to the preferred dihydrate form, while physically &quot;setting&quot; to form a rigid and relatively strong gypsum crystal lattice:

:CaSO4 · H2O + H2O   →   CaSO4 · 2 H2O

This reaction is exothermic and is responsible for the ease with which gypsum can be cast into various shapes including sheets (for drywall), sticks (for blackboard chalk), and molds (to immobilize broken bones, or for metal casting). Mixed with polymers, it has been used as a bone repair cement. Small amounts of calcined gypsum are added to earth to create strong structures directly from cast earth, an alternative to adobe (which loses its strength when wet). The conditions of dehydration can be changed to adjust the porosity of the hemihydrate, resulting in the so-called α- and β-hemihydrates (which are more or less chemically identical).

On heating to , the nearly water-free form, called γ-anhydrite (CaSO4·&quot;n&quot;H2O where &quot;n&quot; = 0 to 0.05) is produced. γ-Anhydrite reacts slowly with water to return to the dihydrate state, a property exploited in some commercial desiccants. On heating above 250 °C, the completely anhydrous form called β-anhydrite or &quot;natural&quot; anhydrite is formed. Natural anhydrite does not react with water, even over geological timescales, unless very finely ground.

The variable composition of the hemihydrate and γ-anhydrite, and their easy inter-conversion, is due to their nearly identical crystal structures containing &quot;channels&quot; that can accommodate variable amounts of water, or other small molecules such as methanol.

===Food industry===
The calcium sulfate hydrates are used as a coagulant in products such as tofu.

For the FDA, it is permitted in cheese and related cheese products; cereal flours; bakery products; frozen desserts; artificial sweeteners for jelly &amp; preserves; condiment vegetables; and condiment tomatoes and some candies.

It is known in the E number series as E516, and the UN&#x27;s FAO knows it as a firming agent, a flour treatment agent, a sequestrant, and a leavening agent.

=== Dentistry ===
Calcium sulfate has a long history of use in dentistry. It has been used in bone regeneration as a graft material and graft binder (or extender) and as a barrier in guided bone tissue regeneration. It is a biocompatible material and is completely resorbed following implantation. It does not evoke a significant host response and creates a calcium-rich milieu in the area of implantation.

===Desiccant===

When sold at the anhydrous state as a desiccant with a color-indicating agent under the name Drierite, it appears blue (anhydrous) or pink (hydrated) due to impregnation with cobalt(II) chloride, which functions as a moisture indicator.

===Sulfuric acid production===
Up to the 1970s, commercial quantities of sulfuric acid were produced from anhydrous calcium sulfate. Upon being mixed with shale or marl, and roasted at 1400°C, the sulfate liberates sulfur dioxide gas, a precursor to sulfuric acid. The reaction also produces calcium silicate, used in cement clinker production.

Some component reactions pertaining to calcium sulfate:

==Production and occurrence== 
The main sources of calcium sulfate are naturally occurring gypsum and anhydrite, which occur at many locations worldwide as evaporites. These may be extracted by open-cast quarrying or by deep mining. World production of natural gypsum is around 127 million tonnes per annum.

In addition to natural sources, calcium sulfate is produced as a by-product in a number of processes:
*In flue-gas desulfurization, exhaust gases from fossil-fuel power stations and other processes (e.g. cement manufacture) are scrubbed to reduce their sulfur dioxide content, by injecting finely ground limestone:
Related sulfur-trapping methods use lime and some produces an impure calcium sulfite, which oxidizes on storage to calcium sulfate.
*In the production of phosphoric acid from phosphate rock, calcium phosphate is treated with sulfuric acid and calcium sulfate precipitates. The product, called phosphogypsum is often contaminated with impurities making its use uneconomic.
*In the production of hydrogen fluoride, calcium fluoride is treated with sulfuric acid, precipitating calcium sulfate.
*In the refining of zinc, solutions of zinc sulfate are treated with hydrated lime to co-precipitate heavy metals such as barium.
*Calcium sulfate can also be recovered and re-used from scrap drywall at construction sites.

These precipitation processes tend to concentrate radioactive elements in the calcium sulfate product. This issue is particular with the phosphate by-product, since phosphate ores naturally contain uranium and its decay products such as radium-226, lead-210 and polonium-210. Extraction of uranium from phosphorus ores can be economical on its own depending on prices on the uranium market or the separation of uranium can be mandated by environmental legislation and its sale is used to recover part of the cost of the process.

Calcium sulfate is also a common component of fouling deposits in industrial heat exchangers, because its solubility decreases with increasing temperature (see the specific section on the retrograde solubility).

==Solubility==

The solubility of calcium sulfate decreases as temperature increases. This behaviour (&quot;retrograde solubility&quot;) is uncommon: dissolution of most of the salts is endothermic and their solubility increases with temperature. The retrograde solubility of calcium sulfate is also responsible for its precipitation in the hottest zone of heating systems and for its contribution to the formation of scale in boilers along with the precipitation of calcium carbonate whose solubility also decreases when CO2 degasses from hot water or can escape out of the system.

<text>Herta Oberheuser (15 May 1911 – 24 January 1978) was a German Nazi physician and convicted war criminal who performed medical atrocities on prisoners at the Ravensbrück women&#x27;s concentration camp. For her role in the Holocaust, she was sentenced to 20 years in prison at the Doctors&#x27; Trial, but served only five years of her sentence. A survivor of Ravensbrück called Oberheuser &quot;a beast masquerading as a human&quot;.

==Education and Nazi Party membership==
In 1937, Oberheuser obtained her medical degree at the University of Bonn, Germany, having specialized in dermatology. She had a residency in the department of dermatology of the University of Düsseldorf. Soon thereafter she joined the Nazi Party as an intern, and later served as doctor for the League of German Girls. During this period, she wrote a number of antisemitic tracts that would subsequently be entered into evidence at her trial. In 1940, Oberheuser was appointed to serve as an assistant to Karl Gebhardt, then Chief Surgeon of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) and Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s personal doctor.

==War crimes==
Oberheuser and Gebhardt were posted to Ravensbrück in 1942 in order to conduct experiments on its prisoners, with an emphasis on finding better methods of treating infection. The experiments were performed by a group of doctors and nurses known as the &#x27;Hohenlychen group&#x27;, so named because they had worked at the SS sanatorium at Hohenlychen. The group conducted gruesome medical experiments, without anaesthetic, such as infecting wounds with rusty nails, broken shards of glass, dirt or sawdust; treating purposely infected wounds with sulphonamide; and removing or amputating bone, muscle, and nerve tissue to study regeneration. 

The experiments were conducted on 86 women, 74 of whom were Polish political prisoners. Five of the prisoners died as a direct result of the experiments and those who survived were often crippled for life. They were cruelly referred to not as human beings but as &quot;guinea pigs&quot; or &quot;rabbits&quot;. 

Oberheuser &quot;did a great deal of the actual work&quot;. Her duties included conducting humiliating gynaecological examinations on women arriving at the camp, selecting young, healthy Polish inmates for the human experiments to be conducted on, infecting wounds, and assisting in all surgical procedures. She was also one of the group members responsible for post operative care of the victims, but is recalled by witnesses as having done not much other than making the injuries worse. For example, one survivor Stefania Lotocka remembers Oberheuser refusing to provide water to many victims and, when she did, mixing it with vinegar. She also ordered that victims were not to be given medicine to relieve their pain. Oberheuser later tried to justify her inhumane actions and claimed that Germans had the right to experiment, because the victims were members of the Polish underground resistance against the Nazi Regime.

==Trial==
When 22 medical staff from the concentration camps were on trial in the Nuremberg &quot;Doctors&#x27; trial&quot; in 1948, Oberheuser was the only female defendant. She commented of her gender that &quot;being a woman didn&#x27;t stop me being a good National Socialist. I think female National Socialists were every bit as valuable as men in keeping alive what we believe.&quot; She and the other members of the &#x27;Hohenlychen group&#x27; had initially been captured by the British, but the Nuremberg Military Tribunal negotiated their transfer to U.S. custody to stand trial.

Oberheuser pleaded not guilty at her trial, but admitted in her affidavit that &quot;I have myself dispensed five or six injections.&quot; Like the other defendants, she denied having taken part in the mass killing of Jews. She was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Her sentence was commuted to 10 years in January 1951. She benefited from the massive protests by West German citizens and politicians over the upcoming executions of the remaining 28 war criminals who were on death row under U.S. military law and from directly petitioning the Advisory Board.

==Later life==
Oberheuser served her sentence at Landsberg Prison, and was released after just five years in April 1952 for good behaviour. She became a family doctor in Stocksee, near Kiel, in West Germany. She lost her position in August 1958 after a Ravensbrück survivor recognized her, and the interior minister of Schleswig-Holstein, Helmut Lemke, revoked her medical license and shut down her practice. Oberheuser appealed to the Schleswig-Holstein administrative court, which rejected the appeal in December 1960. She never practiced medicine again and was fined. She died in a German nursing home in 1978.

<text>Wolfgang Paul (; 10 August 1913 – 7 December 1993) was a German physicist, who co-developed the non-magnetic quadrupole mass filter which laid the foundation for what is now called an ion trap. He shared one-half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1989 for this work with Hans Georg Dehmelt; the other half of the Prize in that year was awarded to Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.

==Early life==
Wolfgang Paul was born on 10 August 1913 in Lorenzkirch, Germany. He grew up in Munich where his father was a professor of pharmaceutical chemistry. After the first few years at the Technical University of Munich, he changed to Technische Universität Berlin in 1934 where he finished his Diploma in 1937 at the group of Hans Geiger. He followed his doctorate adviser Hans Kopfermann to the University of Kiel and after being drafted to the air force he finished his PhD in 1940 at Technische Universität Berlin.

During World War II, he researched isotope separation, which is necessary to produce fissionable material for use in making nuclear weapons.

==Academic career==
For several years he was a private lecturer at the University of Göttingen with Hans Kopfermann. He became a professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Bonn and stayed there from 1952 until 1993. For two years from 1965 to 1967 he was director of the Division of Nuclear Physics at CERN. In 1970, he spent some weeks as Morris Loeb lecturer at Harvard University. 1978 He were lecturing as distinguished scientist at the FERMI Institute of the University of Chicago and in a similar position at The University of Tokyo. Since 1981, he is Professur Emeritus at the Bonn University.

==Scientific results==
He developed techniques for trapping charged particles in mass spectrometry by electric quadrupole fields in the 1950s. Paul traps are used extensively today to contain and study ions. He developed molecular beam lenses and worked on a 500 MeV electron synchrotron, followed by one at 2500 MeV in 1965. Later he worked on containing slow neutrons in magnetic storage rings, measuring the free neutron lifetime.

He humorously referred to Wolfgang Pauli as his imaginary part if their surnames were considered as complex numbers.

==Göttingen Manifesto==
In 1957, Paul was a signatory of the Göttingen Manifesto, a declaration of 18 leading nuclear scientists of West Germany against arming the West German army with tactical nuclear weapons.

==Sons==
His son Stephan Paul is a professor of experimental physics at the Technical University of Munich. His son Lorenz Paul is a professor of physics at the University of Wuppertal.

<doc id="595192" wikidata="Q2549639" url="?curid=595192" title="Warrandyte, Victoria">
<text>Warrandyte ( ) is built on the lands of the Wurundjeri people of the Woiworung language group of the Kulin Nation, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 24 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Manningham local government area. Warrandyte recorded a population of 5,541 at the .

Warrandyte is bounded in the west by the Mullum Mullum Creek and Target Road, in the north by the Yarra River, in the east by Jumping Creek and Anzac Road, and in the south by an irregular line from Reynolds Road, north of Donvale, Park Orchards and Warrandyte South.

Warrandyte was founded as a Victorian town, located in the once gold-rich rolling hills east of Melbourne, and is now on the north-eastern boundary of suburban Melbourne. Gold was first discovered in the town in 1851 and together, with towns like Bendigo and Ballarat, led the way in gold discoveries during the Victorian gold rush. Today Warrandyte retains much of its past in its surviving buildings of the Colonial period and remains a twin community with North Warrandyte, which borders the Yarra River to its north.

==Etymology==

In Australian Aboriginal mythology (see dreamtime), a Wurundjeri dreamtime story tells of a great eagle; &quot;the all powerful, ever watchful creator of the world&quot;, named &quot;Bunjil&quot;, who &quot;once gazed down upon his people from the star Altair and saw their wrong doing. Awaiting their return, with a mighty crash of thunder, he hurled down a star to destroy them&quot;. Where the star struck created a gorge in which much of the town today is located. Bunjil&#x27;s people remembered the spot, and referred to it as &quot;Warrandyte&quot;, speculated to mean &quot;that which is thrown&quot;.

==History==

In 1851, gold was first discovered in Victoria, in Warrandyte, at Anderson&#x27;s Creek, by Louis Michel, the approximate location of the site is marked by a cairn on Fourth Hill, in the Warrandyte State Park. While some mining did occur in the area throughout the peak of the gold rush, it was not until the late 19th century, after gold discoveries reduced in the more popular regions, that the area around Warrandyte was intensively mined, particularly around Fourth Hill and Whipstick Gully. Some areas continued to be mined up until the 1960s. The Warrandyte Post Office opened on 1 August 1857.

In the early 20th century, Warrandyte (mainly now North Warrandyte) became a popular destination for artists of the Heidelberg School, who sought subject matter further into the bush. This led to the development of an artists camp and small colony. Though not as substantial as the older colonies at Heidelberg and Box Hill, several artists, such as Clara Southern and Walter Withers, who were associated with the Heidelberg School, took up residence in Warrandyte. Others followed, including Penleigh Boyd, Harold Herbert, Jo Sweatman and Gus McLaren, all of North Warrandyte.

===Bushfires===
Major bushfires have swept through Warrandyte throughout history, and the town was at the centre of the Black Friday bushfires in 1939, in which 71 people lost their lives. The 1962 fires also devastated North Warrandyte. Many houses were destroyed and many lives lost. In 2009 the Black Saturday fires in Kinglake were 15 minutes away from North Warrandyte. On 9 February 2014, a bushfire broke out in Warrandyte burning approximately 10 hectares and destroying 3 houses. Major bushfires to have swept through Warrandyte include:

*1851 - 6 February &quot;Black Thursday&quot;
*1939 - 13 January &quot;Black Friday&quot;
*1962 - 14–16 January
*2014 - 9 February

==Geography==


Warrandyte is situated on the southern banks of the Yarra River. The river and hills surrounding the town were once rich in gold and the ruins of mineshafts and tunnels can be found throughout the Warrandyte State Park, amongst other locations. While the central town itself is nestled into a gorge on the river, the suburb covers a reasonably large area of land and can be divided up into the following sections:

Central Warrandyte comprises the main street of Ringwood-Warrandyte Road and Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road (Yarra Street), Pound Bend and the southern banks of the Yarra River.

Andersons Creek flows from neighbouring South Warrandyte and Warranwood into the Yarra just before the beginning of Pound Bend. This area is where several gullies converge and create a geographical hole, with Fourth Hill to the east and the hills on the eastern banks of the Mullum Mullum Creek to the west. This becomes evident when driving through Warrandyte on Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road, as the hills guide the road down towards Andersons Creek.

The Eastern banks of the Mullum Mullum Creek were home to vast orchards overflowing from neighbouring East Doncaster and as a result, much of the vegetation has been cleared. Today the area is covered in large residential properties due to local council regulations allowing land to be subdivided into larger sites. 

==Transportation==
Warrandyte is serviced primarily by the private car, however a bus service actively operates along the main roads of Ringwood-Warrandyte Road and Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road (Yarra Street).

==Community==

 The Pottery Expo at Warrandyte was instigated by local studio potter, Jane Annois in February 2001. It is now an annual event run each February, showcasing the work of selected studio ceramic artists from around Australia, along with international guest artists. Ceramicists who have exhibited in previous Expos include: Arnaud Barraud, Kevin Boyd, Csongvay Blackwood, Greg Daly, Janet DeBoos, Minna Graham, Ted Secombe and Prue Venables.
The Warrandyte Festival, one of the last remaining volunteer-run festivals in Victoria, is held every year in mid March. Typically, the festival features a variety of attractions. Many stalls sell local produce or crafts and there are numerous historical exhibits, as well as safety demonstrations by the CFA.
Warrandyte is serviced by the community newspaper Warrandyte Diary. The Diary was established in 1970 by local screenwriter Cliff Green, journalist Lee Tindale and cartoonist Jock Macneish. The Diary has provided news, information and entertainment to Warrandyte and its surrounding communities for more than 50 years. 

==Facilities==

Warrandyte has a general post office, tennis courts, a community centre, an RSL club, bed and breakfasts, restaurants, a police station, a CFA fire station, two kindergartens, two recreational ovals (AFL Football and Cricket), Andersons Creek Cemetery and a Scout hall, canoe launching ramps, a skatepark, nurseries and tearooms and the Crystal Brook Holiday Centre. It also has a thriving arts community including theatre, pottery and painting centred at the Mechanics Institute Hall.

<text>The Alberta Party (formally the Alberta Party Political Association from 1998 to 2004) is a political party in the province of Alberta, Canada. The party describes itself as centrist and pragmatic in that it is not dogmatically ideological in its approach to politics.

==History==
===Early history===
The Alberta Party began in the early 1980s as an alliance of small separatist political parties. The right side of Alberta&#x27;s political spectrum was fragmented by parties spawned in the wake of the National Energy Program and feelings that Premier Peter Lougheed had done little to prevent the economic collapse they believe it had caused. Some of these parties had already achieved some small success in attaining seats in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, though in the 1982 general election Social Credit, the Alberta Reform Movement and the Western Canada Concept lost their representation in the Legislature. The Heritage Party of Alberta, Representative Party of Alberta and the Confederation of Regions had been founded in the preceding years, which made for a total of five parties to the right of the Progressive Conservatives in 1985.

On October 30, 1990, this alliance of parties gave way to the creation of a new political party, the Alliance Party of Alberta. This change marked a transition away from trying to build a coalition of parties to full participation in electoral politics. The party participated in two by-elections, and fielded a handful of candidates in the 1993 general election but received only a small percentage of the popular vote in each case. The party did not contest the 1997 provincial election.
In 1998, the Alliance Party followed the example of the Saskatchewan Party and the Manitoba Party by changing its name to the Alberta Party Political Association, or the Alberta Party for short.

Shortly before the 2004 election, the Alberta Party attempted to merge with the Alberta Alliance Party (a different organization from the old Alliance Party of Alberta). The merged party would have adopted the Alberta Party platform, and the Alberta Party provincial council would have had seats on the Alberta Alliance Provincial Council. The deal fell through because the Alberta Party would not agree to de-register the Alberta Party name with Elections Alberta. On October 1, 2004, shortly before the general election, the party shortened its registered name to &quot;Alberta Party&quot; from &quot;the Alberta Party Political Association&quot;.

In the 2004 provincial election, the party nominated candidates in four ridings, winning a total of 2,485 votes, or 0.3% of the provincial total. The party fielded one candidate, Margaret Saunter, for the March 3, 2008 provincial election. Saunter placed last out of a field of six candidates in Edmonton-Centre.

===Ideological shift and party renewal===

After the rise of the Wildrose Alliance as Alberta&#x27;s main right-wing alternative to the governing Progressive Conservatives, the right-wing members of the Alberta Party left to join that party. This left a small group of centrists in control of the party. In 2009, former Alberta Greens deputy leader Edwin Erickson, who had been organizing a new &quot;Progress Party&quot;, was invited to run as a leadership candidate for the Alberta Party and won by acclamation. In 2010 the Alberta Party board voted to merge with Renew Alberta, a progressive and centrist group that had been organizing to form a new political party.

During the merger process, the party&#x27;s board agreed to suspend its old policy platform and start anew. To create a new platform different from its more right-wing history, in 2010 the party launched a campaign called &quot;The Big Listen&quot; in order to canvass the public for new policy ideas. The party held its first policy convention on November 13 and 14, 2010 to develop substantive policies from the ideas heard during &quot;The Big Listen&quot;. At the convention, Erickson stepped down to make way for an acting leader until a leadership contest could be held. A first set of policies was released on November 23, 2010, to coincide with the announcement of the appointment of an acting leader, Sue Huff. These policies centred on five key areas: economy, health, environment, democratic renewal, and education. On January 24, 2011, former Liberal MLA Dave Taylor announced he was joining the Alberta Party, becoming the party&#x27;s first MLA.

===2012 Alberta general election===
The party nominated 38 candidates to run in the 28th Alberta general election. None were elected.

=== Floor crossings ===
On October 30, 2017, it was announced that former NDP MLA Karen McPherson who had left the Government Caucus earlier in the month would cross to join the Alberta Party as their third ever, and second current MLA. McPherson cited the need to make transformative change in healthcare and management of the economy, as well as the feeling that she could better advocate for her constituents and use her skills and abilities better in the Alberta Party.

In January 2018, former UCP MLA Rick Fraser announced that he would be joining the Alberta Party and running for its leadership race that had been triggered when Greg Clark stepped down. Fraser cited the divisive politics of the UCP for his departure, and the need to find &quot;common sense policies&quot; that &quot;don&#x27;t divide Albertans, but rather bring them closer together.&quot;

Fraser&#x27;s joining of the Alberta Party tripled the caucus size from the results of the 2015 general election, leaving the Alberta Party as the third largest representation in the Legislature.

===2019 Alberta general election===

The Alberta Party ran a full slate of candidates for the first time. Although the party gained 9.09% of the popular vote, an increase from 2.29% in 2015, it lost all three ridings it held going into the election and won no seats in the Legislature.

== Ideology ==
For most of its history, the Alberta Party was a right-wing organization. This was until the rise of the Wildrose Alliance as Alberta&#x27;s main conservative alternative to the governing Progressive Conservatives attracted away the Alberta Party&#x27;s more conservative members. This left a small rump of comparatively less conservative members in control of the Alberta Party. In 2010, the Alberta Party board voted to merge with Renew Alberta, a progressive group that had been organizing to form a new political party in Alberta. The Alberta Party thus shed its conservative past for a more centrist political outlook. The party has been cited in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and &quot;The Economist&quot; as part of the break in one-party politics in Alberta, with &quot;the Economist&quot; calling it &quot;a split in Canada’s most powerful right-wing political machine.&quot;
==Leadership elections==
===2011 leadership election===

The party announced in January 2011 that a leadership convention would be held in Edmonton on May 28, 2011. Four candidates contested the leadership of the party: Glenn Taylor, mayor of Hinton; Tammy Maloney, a social entrepreneur; businessman Randy Royer; and Lee Easton, chair of the English program at Mount Royal University. Chris Tesarski, CEO of Sandbox Energy Corporation, was also a candidate early in the contest, but on April 15 announced he would not seek the party&#x27;s leadership, citing disagreements with some aspects of the party&#x27;s philosophy and some party members&#x27; attitudes towards his candidacy. Dave Taylor, the party&#x27;s only MLA, was also expected to run for the leadership, but did not join the campaign. At the convention, the election was decided on the first ballot when Glenn Taylor won just over 55% of the votes.

===2013 leadership election===
After Glenn Taylor stepped down on September 22, 2012, the party remained without a leader for some months. On May 29, 2013, the party announced that it would be holding a leadership vote to coincide with its Annual General Meeting on September 21, 2013, in Edmonton. Entrepreneur and 2012 Calgary-Elbow election candidate Greg Clark, and self-employed consultant and 2012 Calgary-North West candidate Troy Millington, sought the leadership. Clark won the election, receiving 87% of the 337 votes cast.

===2018 leadership election===

A leadership election was triggered when Greg Clark stepped down as leader on November 18, 2017. The election was held on February 27, 2018, after originally being scheduled to be on February 7. Stephen Mandel became the new leader of the party after achieving 66% of the vote.

=== 2021 leadership election ===
On June 30, 2019, Stephen Mandel resigned as leader of the Alberta Party. Former PC MLA Jacquie Fenske became the interim leader on February 10, 2020. The Party announced a leadership contest, with a new leader to be elected on October 23, 2021. As only one candidate submitted a valid application by the close of nominations on August 31, 2021, Barry Morishita was acclaimed as leader.

On October 15, 2023, Morishita resigned as leader of the party.

On April 14, 2024, the party announced that corporate lawyer, Lindsay Amantea, was the new interim leader.

<doc id="595197" wikidata="Q21198990" url="?curid=595197" title="Periplasm">
<text>The periplasm is a concentrated gel-like matrix in the space between the inner cytoplasmic membrane and the bacterial outer membrane called the &quot;periplasmic space&quot; in Gram-negative (more accurately &quot;diderm&quot;) bacteria. Using cryo-electron microscopy it has been found that a much smaller periplasmic space is also present in Gram-positive bacteria (more accurately &quot;monoderm&quot;), between cell wall and the plasma membrane. The periplasm may constitute up to 40% of the total cell volume of gram-negative bacteria, but is a much smaller percentage in gram-positive bacteria.

== Terminology ==
Although bacteria are conventionally divided into two main groups—Gram-positive and Gram-negative, based upon their Gram-stain retention property—this classification system is ambiguous as it can refer to three distinct aspects (staining result, cell-envelope organization, taxonomic group), which do not necessarily coalesce for some bacterial species. 
In most situations such as in this article, Gram-staining reflects the marked differences in the ultrastructure and chemical composition of the two main kinds of bacteria. The usual &quot;Gram-positive&quot; type does not have an outer lipid membrane, while the typical &quot;Gram-negative&quot; bacterium does. The terms &quot;diderm&quot; and &quot;monoderm&quot;, coined to refer to this distinction &quot;only&quot;, is a more reliable and fundamental characteristic of the bacterial cells.
All Gram-positive bacteria are bounded by a single unit lipid membrane (i.e. monoderm); they generally contain a thick layer (20-80 nm) of peptidoglycan responsible for retaining the Gram-stain. A number of other bacteria which are bounded by a single membrane but stain gram-negative due to either lack of the peptidoglycan layer (viz., mycoplasmas) or their inability to retain the Gram-stain due to their cell wall composition, also show close relationship to the Gram-positive bacteria. For the bacterial (prokaryotic) cells that are bounded by a single cell membrane the term &quot;monoderm bacteria&quot; or &quot;monoderm prokaryotes&quot; has been proposed. In contrast to gram-positive bacteria, all archetypical Gram-negative bacteria are bounded by a cytoplasmic membrane as well as an outer cell membrane; they contain only a thin layer of peptidoglycan (2–3 nm) between these membranes. The presence of both inner and outer cell membranes forms and define the periplasmic space or periplasmic compartment. These bacterial cells with two membranes have been designated as diderm bacteria. The distinction between the monoderm and diderm prokaryotes is supported by conserved signature indels in a number of important proteins (for example, DnaK and GroEL).

== Structure ==
As shown in the figure to the right, the periplasmic space in gram-negative or diderm bacteria is located between the inner and outer membrane of the cell. The periplasm contains peptidoglycan and the membranes that enclose the periplasmic space contain many integral membrane proteins, which can participate in cell signaling. Furthermore, the periplasm houses motility organelles such as the flagellum, which spans both membranes enclosing the periplasm. The periplasm is described as gel-like due to the high abundance of proteins and peptidoglycan. The periplasm occupies 7% to 40% of the total volume of diderm bacteria, and contains up to 30% of cellular proteins. The structure of the monoderm periplasm differs from that of diderm bacteria as the so-called periplasmic space in monoderm bacteria is not enclosed by two membranes but is rather enclosed by the cytoplasmic membrane and the peptidoglycan layer beneath. For this reason, the monoderm periplasmic space is also referred to as the inner-wall zone (IWZ). The IWZ serves as the first destination of translocation for proteins being transported across the monoderm bacterial cell wall.

== Function ==
In diderm bacteria, the periplasm contains a thin cell wall composed of peptidoglycan. In addition, it includes solutes such as ions and proteins, which are involved in wide variety of functions ranging from nutrient binding, transport, folding, degradation, substrate hydrolysis, to peptidoglycan synthesis, electron transport, and alteration of substances toxic to the cell (xenobiotic metabolism). Importantly, the periplasm is devoid of ATP. Several types of enzyme are present in the periplasm including alkaline phosphatases, cyclic phosphodiesterases, acid phosphatases and 5’-nucleotidases. Of note, the periplasm also contains enzymes important for the facilitation of protein folding. For example, disulfide bond protein A (DsbA) and disulfide bond protein C (DsbC), which are responsible for catalyzing peptide bond formation and isomerization, respectively, were identified in the periplasm of &quot;E. Coli.&quot; As disulfide bond formation is frequently a rate-limiting step in the folding of proteins, these oxidizing enzymes play an important role in the bacteria periplasm. In addition, the periplasm mediates the uptake of DNA in several strains of transformable bacteria. 

The compartmentalization afforded by the periplasmic space gives rise to several important functions. Aside from those previously mentioned, the periplasm also functions in protein transport and quality control, analogous to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes. Furthermore, the separation of the periplasm from the cytoplasm allows for the compartmentalization of enzymes that could be toxic in the cytoplasm. Some peptidoglycans and lipoproteins located in the periplasm provide a structural support system for the cell that aids in promoting the cell&#x27;s ability to withstand turgor pressure. Notably, organelles such as the flagellum require the assembly of polymers within the periplasm for proper functioning. As the driveshaft of the flagellum spans the periplasmic space, its length is dictated by positioning of the outer membrane as induced by its contraction, which is mediated by periplasmic polymers. The periplasm also functions in cell signaling, such as in the case of the lipoprotein RcsF, which has a globular domain residing in the periplasm and acts as a stress sensor. When RcsF fails to interact with BamA, such as in the case of an enlarged periplasm, RcsF is not exported to the cell surface and are able to trigger the Rcs signaling cascade. Periplasm size, therefore, plays an important role in stress signaling.

== Clinical significance ==
As bacteria are the responsible pathogen for many infections and illnesses, the biochemical and structural components that distinguish disease causing bacterial cells from native eukaryotic cells are of great interest from a clinical perspective. Gram-negative bacteria tend to be more antimicrobial resistant than gram-positive bacteria, and also possess a much more significant periplasmic space between their two membrane bilayers. Since eukaryotes do not possess a periplasmic space, structures and enzymes found in the gram-negative periplasm are attractive targets for antimicrobial drug therapies. Additionally, vital functions such as facilitation of protein folding, protein transport, cell signaling, structural integrity, and nutrient uptake are performed by periplasm components, making it rich in potential drug targets. Aside from enzymes and structural components that are vital to cell function and survival, the periplasm also contains virulence-associated proteins such as DsbA that can be targeted by antimicrobial therapies. Due to their role in catalyzing disulfide bond formation for a variety of virulence factors, the DsbA/DsbB system has been of particular interest as a target for anti-virulence drugs.

The periplasmic space is deeply interconnected with the pathogenesis of disease in the setting of microbial infection. Many of the virulence factors associated with bacterial pathogenicity are secretion proteins, which are often subject to post-translational modification including disulfide bond formation. The oxidative environment of the periplasm contains Dsb (disulfide bond formation) proteins that catalyze such post-translational modifications, and therefore play an important role in establishing virulence factor tertiary and quaternary structure essential for proper protein function. In addition to Dsb proteins found in the periplasm, motility organelles such as the flagellum are also essential for host infection. The flagellum is rooted in the periplasm and is stabilized by interaction with periplasmic structural components, and is therefore another pathogenesis-related target for antimicrobial agents. During infection of a host, the cell of a bacterium is subject to many turbulent environmental conditions, which highlights the importance of the structural integrity afforded by the periplasm. In particular, peptidoglycan synthesis is vital to cell wall production, and inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis have been of clinical interest for targeting bacteria for many decades. Furthermore, the periplasm is also relevant to clinical developments by way of its role in mediating the uptake of transforming DNA.

<doc id="595213" wikidata="Q7987951" url="?curid=595213" title="Western Independence Party of Saskatchewan">
<text>The Western Independence Party of Saskatchewan (often shortened to WIP of Saskatchewan or WIP-SK) was a provincial political party in Saskatchewan, Canada. It advocated for the independence of Saskatchewan and libertarian ideals. The party leader was Neil Fenske. WIP-SK was not affiliated with any federal party.

== History ==
The WIP of Saskatchewan was formed on July 12, 2003, and nominated 17 candidates for the November 5, 2003 provincial election. These candidates won a total of 2,735 votes, or 0.64% of the provincial total.

The first party president was Frank Serfas, and the first deputy leader was David Sawkiw. The party nominated eight candidates for the 2007 election, two in the 2011 election, and four in the 2016 election.

The party was not affiliated with the Western Canada Concept Party of British Columbia or the British Columbia-based Western Block Party, and has made considerable effort to distance itself from Doug Christie, the leader of those parties. Whereas Christie has been mired in controversy for defending Holocaust deniers and has been accused of being an anti-Semite, the WIP of Saskatchewan has made an explicit statement in support of the State of Israel. The WIP of Saskatchewan also has no ties with the Separation Party of Alberta, the Western Canada Party, or the Alberta Independence Party.

===De-registration===

The party was formally de-registered by Elections Saskatchewan on May 10, 2019. The party had missed the deadline to report their election expenses related to the 2018 Regina Northeast by-election. According to Fenske, missing the dealine was an &quot;oversight&quot; and the party had been lacking the manpower to function as a proper party for a few years. The party was also dealing with internal divisions. Indeed, some members who were disappointed by Fenske&#x27;s non-commitment to Western separatism had attempted to oust him as leader in the months prior to the party&#x27;s de-registration.

== Ideology ==
The WIP of Saskatchewan&#x27;s platform was libertarian and secular in nature, a distinguishing feature from some of the other separatist parties in Western Canada. It supported fiscally conservative and socially moderate policies. Though the party was originally established with a pro-independence stance, in its final years it had focused less on separatism and has instead advocated for strengthened political power at the federal level for Saskatchewan, to combat the perceived notion of Western alienation.

<doc id="595218" wikidata="Q1203120" url="?curid=595218" title="Succession to the Dutch throne">
<text>Since 1983, the crown of the Netherlands passes according to absolute primogeniture. From 1814 until 1887, a monarch could only be succeeded by their closest female relative if there were no eligible male relatives. Male-preference cognatic primogeniture was adopted in 1887, though abolished when absolute primogeniture was introduced in 1983. Proximity of blood has been taken into consideration since 1922, when the constitution was changed to limit the line of succession to three degrees of kinship from the current monarch. In a situation where the monarch is succeeded by an eligible aunt or uncle, persons previously excluded could be reintroduced into the line of succession.

In October 2021, in a letter to parliament Prime Minister Mark Rutte stated that the monarch and the heir to the throne could marry a person of the same sex without being forced to abdicate or give up their place in the line of succession.

== Line of succession ==
The list below contains all people currently eligible to directly succeed to the throne (numbered 1 to 8) and the descendants of Princess Margriet who would be eligible if she were to succeed.
* &quot;Queen Juliana (1909–2004)&quot;
** Queen Beatrix (born 1938)
*** King Willem-Alexander (born 1967)
**** (1) Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange (born 2003)
**** (2) Princess Alexia (b. 2005)
**** (3) Princess Ariane (b. 2007)
*** (4) Prince Constantijn (b. 1969)
**** (5) Countess Eloise (b. 2002)
**** (6) Count Claus-Casimir (b. 2004)
**** (7) Countess Leonore (b. 2006)
**(8) Princess Margriet (b. 1943)
*** Prince Maurits (b. 1968)
**** Anastasia van Lippe-Biesterfeld van Vollenhoven (b. 2001)
**** Lucas van Lippe-Biesterfeld van Vollenhoven (b. 2002)
**** Felicia van Lippe-Biesterfeld van Vollenhoven (b. 2005)
*** Prince Bernhard (b. 1969)
**** Isabella van Vollenhoven (b. 2002)
**** Samuel van Vollenhoven (b. 2004)
**** Benjamin van Vollenhoven (b. 2008)

==Notes==
* Beatrix&#x27;s second son, Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau, was removed from the line of succession in 2004 when he married without seeking Parliamentary approval. His two daughters, Countess Luana of Orange-Nassau van Amsberg and Countess Zaria of Orange-Nassau van Amsberg, are not in the line of succession.
* Princess Irene (Beatrix&#x27;s younger sister) was removed from the list when she married Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma, without Parliamentary approval. Approval was withheld because Carlos Hugo&#x27;s Carlist pretense to the Spanish throne threatened to cause a Constitutional crisis.
* Prince Pieter-Christiaan and Prince Floris of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven (the younger sons of Princess Margriet), were removed from the list because they had both decided not to seek Parliamentary approval for their 2005 marriages due to their remote chance of succeeding to the throne.
* Prince Maurits and Prince Bernhard of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven (the elder sons of Princess Margriet), and their descendants are not in the line because they are too distantly related to the reigning monarch. When Willem-Alexander became king on 30 April 2013, his aunt&#x27;s sons lost their succession rights and will only regain them if she succeeds to the throne – in which case her children would assume appropriate places in the line of succession.

<doc id="595226" wikidata="Q2908500" url="?curid=595226" title="Boeing C-32">
<text>The Boeing C-32 is the United States Air Force designation for variants of the Boeing 757 in military service. Two variants exist, filling different parts of the military passenger transport role. The C-32A serves the Special Air Mission, providing executive transport and broad communications capabilities to senior political officials, while the C-32B Gatekeeper provides clandestine airlift to special operations and global emergency response efforts, a role known as &quot;covered air&quot;.

The primary users of the C-32A are the vice president of the United States (using the call sign &quot;Air Force Two&quot; when aboard), the first lady, and the secretary of state. On occasion, other members of the president&#x27;s Cabinet and members of Congress have flown aboard the C-32A. The aircraft also occasionally serves as Air Force One in place of the larger VC-25A for a variety of reasons, including accessing smaller airports domestically or when the larger aircraft is not needed.

Less is known of the activities of C-32B, whose existence is not widely promoted by the Air Force, they support government airlift for crisis. The B models are former commercial 757 used for global airlift for government crisis needs. The modified aircraft were acquired to support the U.S. State Department&#x27;s Foreign Emergency Support Team, and have ties to special operations, and the U.S. Intelligence Community.

The C-32 replaced the C-137 Stratoliner, achiving double the range yet able to land on shorter runways than that aircraft. The C-137 was based on the Boeing 707, and had been in service several decades.

==C-32A==
===Development===
The C-32A is the military designation for the Boeing 757-2G4, a variant of the Boeing 757-200, a mid-size, narrow-body twin-engine jet airliner—that has been modified for government VIP transport use, including a change to a 45-passenger interior and military avionics. A contract was awarded in August 1996 for four aircraft supplemented by the smaller C-37A and later C-40 Clipper to replace the aging fleet of VC-137 aircraft. The first plane was delivered to the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland in late June 1998. Additional aircraft were acquired later.

=== Equipment and capabilities ===
The C-32As are painted in the blue and white livery, vertical stabilizer flag, and prominent &quot;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&quot; cheatline markings developed by Raymond Loewy at the behest of President Kennedy for use on Air Force One. The design is shared with most Special Air Mission aircraft. All of the C-32As are fitted with Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000 engines and are fitted with winglets for added fuel economy.

==== Appearance upgrades ====

Throughout the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations, the interiors of the C-32As were slowly refitted with more luxurious accommodations, at a cost of $16 million per aircraft. Officially, the work was requested by the Air Force, and is being completed by a division of Boeing at Air Force facilities in Oklahoma. The retrofit includes upgraded and refurbished interior elements throughout, new carpets, lighting, leather seats and wood tables in place of cloth and formica, a complete painting and cleaning, and the replacement of the double-seat configuration with a triple-seat configuration, aft of Door 3. The refit is controversial, with critics describing the spending as &quot;posh&quot; and &quot;wasteful&quot; and an effort to create &quot;flying palaces&quot;, noting that the aircraft are well into the back half of their service lives. &quot;The War Zone&quot; observed that the spending appears to have little to do with the ability of the aircraft to accomplish its mission, noting that the C-32As have been continuously upgraded with improved communications, avionics, and countermeasures throughout their service lives without criticism.

===Operational history===

The four C-32As are operated by the 1st Airlift Squadron of the 89th Airlift Wing. They are available for use by the vice-president (using call sign Air Force Two), the first lady, and members of the Cabinet and Congress (using SAM callsigns). They are also used by the president (using call sign Air Force One) if the destination is too small to support the larger VC-25As or when they are unavailable.

The aircraft also occasionally serves as Air Force One in place of the larger VC-25A when the president is traveling to domestic destinations that cannot accommodate the larger Boeing 747-derived presidential plane or if the latter is simply unavailable, or, as in President Joe Biden&#x27;s February 2023 trip to Ukraine, to throw off would-be threats.

==== Incidents ====

Several C-32As have suffered non-life-threatening equipment failures during VIP flight operations which lead to aircraft returning to Andrews Air Force Base prematurely. In 2018, First Lady Melania Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar were aboard a C-32A flying to Philadelphia when smoke filled the cabin shortly after takeoff. Journalists aboard reported being given wet towels to shield their faces from the smoke, and the flight returned to Andrews without further incident. In 2021, Vice President Kamala Harris was aboard a C-32A en route to Guatemala when the aircraft was forced to make an emergency return to Andrews over an unspecified equipment failure which delayed the trip but left all passengers and crew unharmed.

===Replacement===

The Trump administration included $6 million (~$ in ) in its 2018 federal budget proposal to study replacements for the aging C-32A. In June 2021, Pentagon leaders in the Biden administration cut funding for the study from its fiscal 2022 budget request. Instead, the Air Force redirected the nominal amount of funding to research and development contracts for three American startup companies: Exosonic and Boom Supersonic, which are developing supersonic passenger jets; and Hermeus, which is developing a hypersonic passenger aircraft. Budget documents state the revised investment “will bolster evaluation and maturation of advanced high speed transport scale aircraft with potential to expand the defense industrial base and serve as C-32A replacements at the appropriate time.” All three programs are many years away from delivery of production aircraft.

The C-32A is not planned to leave Air Mobility Command service until 2040; however, discussion of the aircraft&#x27;s age has continued, prompted by high-profile reliability issues. For the duration the C-32A will remain in the fleet, the Air Force will not pursue investment in the airframe beyond already planned modifications, according to the service&#x27;s fiscal 2022 budget request. Boeing (the sole producer which can fulfill Buy American Act purchasing restrictions for government passenger aircraft) has neglected the middle of the market since the 757 was discontinued in 2004, repeatedly shelving upgrade plans since 2014. In 2021, the company announced a clean sheet restart of plans for a successor aircraft, slated to enter service in the late 2020s.

== C-32B Gatekeeper ==

===Role===
The 45-seat C-32B Gatekeeper provides airlift to the U.S. government&#x27;s Gate Keeper (GK) mission, a special access program which provides clandestine support to foreign states through State Department Foreign Emergency Support Team missions and classified special operations and intelligence missions. The aircraft are operated by two different units, the New Jersey Air National Guard&#x27;s 150th Special Operations Squadron at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, and the 486th Flight Test Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The C-32Bs operate at the direction of the Commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, though when serving a civilian agency, approval for the use of the aircraft is on the recommendation of the committee of Deputy Secretaries of Defense with the consent of the Secretary of Defense. The development of the two aircraft emerged from the 2001 Air Force budget, where they were procured for $144.963 million (~$ in ) to fill an Air Force request for transportation capabilities for the Foreign and Domestic Emergency Support Teams. The Gate Keeper mission predates the aircraft, which are successors to previous fleets based on other models of aircraft. The planes have been spotted throughout the world, including such locations as Area 51 and the Tonopah Test Range. The C-32B became known during the George W. Bush administration for unsubstantiated theories which circulated that they were connected to the CIA&#x27;s extraordinary rendition flights, giving them the onetime nickname “torture taxi.”

=== Equipment and capabilities ===
The C-32Bs serve as on-call global transport. They differ significantly from their VIP-carrying counterparts, outfitted with advanced communications and designed for ultra long-range capability. Most cargo must be stored in the rear of the aircraft as enlarged fuel tanks replace much of the below-deck cargo hold, extending the aircraft&#x27;s unrefueled maximum range to . The craft also have an aerial refueling capability via an unmarked, unilluminated conformal Universal Aerial Refueling Receptacle Slipway Installation (UARRSI) located atop the fuselage, behind the cockpit windows, allowing the planes to remain airborne nearly indefinitely. The aircraft are also fitted with an airstair allowing passengers to deplane without access to a jet bridge or stair truck, a heavy and uncommon modification in modern commercial aviation. For additional support in austere environments, the aircraft are also fitted with a winch-based baggage loading system, designed to load baggage at airfields that do not have adequate material handling equipment available.

In 2014, the C-32Bs received audio and visual equipment upgrades, in addition to installation of upgraded satellite communications systems and secure Ku bandwidth communications management systems to replace commercial-grade Inmarsat installations, in use since 2002. Around the same time, the craft acquired an additional protruding fairing on the roof of the rear of the craft. Similar modifications have appeared on the C-32As, the presidential VC-25As, the E-4B and E-6 “doomsday planes”, and the E-11A BACN. The protrusion reportedly houses Northrop Grumman’s Multi-Role Tactical Common Data Link (MR-TCDL), a Ka and Ku band telecommunications suite designed for war zones but which has proved to be just as relevant over a disaster zone as a battlefield. The system functions as a flying wireless router and server, providing communications where traditional communications infrastructure is unavailable. Budget requests show that around 2016 the cockpit avionics were upgraded to include head up displays. Depot level maintenance on the C-32B is performed by Big Safari (the 645th Aeronautical Systems Squadron).

According to Air Force Manual 11-2C-32B (2020), at least two members of the C-32B aircrew are always armed.

===Airframes===
There are two C-32B aircraft as of 2021: 00-9001 and 02-4452. At times the Air National Guard has appeared to deny the existence of one of the two aircraft. The 2012 edition of the National Guard&#x27;s Weapons System Modernization Priorities report states &quot;the 150th Special Operations Squadron of the New Jersey Air National Guard operates the C-32B from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, NJ and is the &quot;only&quot; U.S Air Force C-32B&quot;, while all prior and successive editions describe a need to support upgrades to two aircraft. Both planes are painted gloss white, and lack any recognizable external markings other than serial numbers, although they have been spotted with &quot;United States Air Force&quot; emblazoned on the cheatline and the Air Force roundel on the tail section of the fuselage at times, and solely a small American flag on the same area of the rear fuselage at other times. There are only two identified visual differences between the two aircraft: one has larger emergency ramp openings under the doorsills, and one has the rearward window removed from the forward bank of windows on the starboard side. Both planes are known for adopting a range of different serial numbers on a regular basis to confuse their activities and identities. Numbers appearing on the aircraft in the past have included: 00-9001, 98-6006, 99-6143, 02-5001, and 02-4452.

The true identity of the older of the two aircraft is MSN 25493/523 (02-4452), originally delivered to Ansett Worldwide as N59AW on 26 February 1993, it saw service with ATA airlines as 84WA before shuffling through private brokers, and ultimately being sold to the Air Force by Kodiak Associates LLC in 2000. The later aircraft is MSN 25494/611 (00-9001), delivered to Avianca as N987AN on April 22, 1994, it passed through the hands of Raytheon E-Systems before Air Force purchase in 2001. Both aircraft are powered by Rolls-Royce RB211 engines, rather than the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000 used on the C-32A.
Sparsely marked secretive white 757s often conflated with the C-32B include N226G and N610G, a pair of 757s operated by L3Harris subsidiary L-3 Capital. The aircraft have been observed operating with various tail numbers, and previously featured the text &quot;COMCO&quot; in prominent black lettering on the tail, later replaced by a conservative blue swoosh design. The near identical equipment of the so-called COMCO aircraft, including airstair, Rolls-Royce engines, roof communications fairing, and an unexplained rectangular modification applied to the fuselage of both aircraft have fueled rumors that they are in fact C-32Bs with hasty paint or decals applied, however such claims have never been substantiated. Other similar aircraft include N119NA and N874TW, a pair of 757s based at Richmond International Airport, acquired by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2015 displaying an American flag on their tail and are distinguished from the C-32B by their winglets.
