<text>Byron Bay (Minjungbal: &quot;Cavvanbah)&quot; is a beachside town located in the far-northeastern corner of New South Wales, Australia (in Bundjalung Country). It is located north of Sydney and south of Brisbane. Cape Byron, a headland adjacent to the town, is the easternmost point of mainland Australia. At the 2021 census, the town had a permanent population of 6,330. It is the largest town of Byron Shire local government area, though not the shire&#x27;s administrative centre (which is Mullumbimby).

== History ==
Byron Bay and surrounds are located on traditional lands of the Bundjalung Nation of the Arakwal, Minjungbal and the Widjabul people who have lived by the coast for at least 22,000 years. Traditional custodians of the region believe that the land and people were created by Nguthungulli, who rests at what is now called Julian Rocks. The traditional name of the township area was &quot;Cavvanbah&quot;, meaning &quot;meeting place&quot;&quot;.&quot; Significant totems for the area include &quot;Wajung&quot; and &quot;Kabul.&quot;

In 1770 Lieutenant James Cook found safe anchorage and named Cape Byron after a fellow sailor Vice Admiral &#x27;Foul-Weather Jack&#x27; John Byron, circumnavigator of the world and grandfather of the poet Lord Byron. European settlement in the area took place in the 1830s. A massacre took place in the 1850s, south of Suffolk Park where the quarry is today.

The first industry in Byron was cedar logging from the Australian red cedar (&quot;Toona ciliata&quot;). The timber industry is the origin of the word &quot;shoot&quot; in many local names – Possum Shoot, Coopers Shoot and Skinners Shoot – where the timber-cutters would &quot;shoot&quot; the logs down the hills to be dragged to waiting ships. Timber getting became insignificant after World War I. As a result, many former timber workers became farmers.

Gold mining of the beaches was the next industry to occur. Gold was discovered in Byron Bay in 1870. Up to 20 mining leases set up on Tallow Beach to extract gold from the black sands around the 1870s.

Byron Bay has a history of primary industrial production (dairy factory, abattoirs, fishing, and whaling until 1963) and was a significant, but hazardous, sea port. The poet Brunton Stephens spoke of cattle grazing on the &quot;mossy plains&quot; of Cape Byron in a poem he penned in 1876.

The first jetty was built in 1886, and the railway was connected in 1894, and Cavvanbah became Byron Bay in 1894. Dairy farmers cleared more land and settled the area. In 1895, the Norco Co-operative was formed to provide cold storage and manage the dairy and processes meat industry. The introduction of paspalum grass improved production, and Byron Bay exported butter from its depots at Murwillumbah and Lismore to the world.

The Cape Byron Lighthouse was built in 1901 at the most easterly point on the Australian mainland. Its construction destroyed a significant Arakwal men&#x27;s ceremonial ground.

In 1930, the first meatworks opened. The smell from the meat and dairy works was appalling and the annual slaughter of migrating whales in the 1950s and 1960s made matters worse. Sand mining for monazite (zircon, uranium and thorium) between the World Wars damaged the environment further. Mining ceased in 1968 and processing in 1972.

Longboard surfers arrived in the 1960s and used natural breaks at The Pass, Watego&#x27;s, and Cosy Corner. This was the beginning of Byron Bay as a travellers&#x27; destination, and by 1973, when the Aquarius Festival was held in nearby Nimbin, its reputation as a hippy, happy, alternative town was established, although tourism facilities remained minimal. From the 1980s, tourism began to develop in earnest, with the cash-poor surfers and hippies supplemented, and to a degree supplanted, by cash-rich conspicuous consumers who in turn stimulated the development of retail precincts and accommodation more tuned to their needs.

In 1994, a native title claim was made by Arakwal Elders Lorna Kelly, Linda Vidler and Yvonne Graham. After seven years of negotiation, an Indigenous Land Use Agreement was formed with the State of New South Wales in 2001, a national first and precedent for subsequent agreements around Australia. Two further local agreements also followed.

Today, Byron Bay is one of the most up-market residential areas on the Australian east coast with the growth in multi-million dollar mansions now pushing the median value of house sales up beyond AU$1.5 million in 2017, over a 100% increase since 2013, based on 2018 data from realestate.com.au. The average house price in 2024 was AU3.6m, based 57 sales. At the same time, the town has not lost its attraction to a diverse range of visitors including surfers, backpackers and general tourists interested in the natural attractions of the area, and also supports a healthy cross section of creative persons including artists, craftspersons and musicians, while its more recent hippy/new age past is reflected to a degree in a prevalence of alternative &quot;new-age&quot; shops, &quot;spiritual&quot; services such as meditation and yoga classes, and holistic healing/&quot;wellness&quot; retreats. As at 2018, the town is cited as having around 5,000 permanent residents, while being visited by 2 million tourists each year.

A number of shipwrecks litter the bay and surrounding areas. A total 16 are known with the most famous of these being the &#x27;Wollongbar&#x27; which due to bad conditions sank off the eastern tip of Belongil beach, it now rests about from the coast and is still visible above water during low tide.

==Heritage listings==
Byron Bay has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Casino–Murwillumbah railway: Byron Bay railway station
* 61 Jonson Street: Byron Bay Post Office
* Lighthouse Road: Cape Byron Lightstation

== Population ==
According to the 2021 census, there were 10,914 people in Byron Bay.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.8% of the population.
* 63.6% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 5.6% and New Zealand 2.6%.
* 77.6% of people spoke only English at home.
* The most common response for religion was No Religion at 58.6%.

== Geology and Geography ==
Byron Bay is part of the erosion caldera of an ancient shield volcano, the Tweed Volcano, which had erupted 23 million years ago. The volcano formed as a result of the Indo-Australian Plate moving over the East Australia hotspot.
Although was named a Bay when discovered, it is in fact in geological terms a &quot;Bight&quot; as the angle of curvature from Cape Byron to Hastings point is less than 25 degrees.

== Climate ==
Byron Bay has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification) with warm summers and mild winters. Winters have daily maximums usually reaching 19.4 °C and a minimum of 12 °C. Summer can be hot, with a daily average of 27 °C. Summer evenings can be wet, cooling the day down. Due to its location on an ocean-facing cape, it is, therefore, more exposed to moist easterly flows, hence its annual rainfall above 1,500 mm, which is higher than that of Brisbane and the Gold Coast.


== Tourism ==

The town is a resort popular with both domestic and international tourists, not the least backpackers. It has several beaches that are popular for surfing and the scenery attracts skydivers. An oceanway allows visitors to walk and cycle from the centre of town to Cape Byron Lighthouse.

The area is noted for its wildlife, with whale watching a significant contributor to the local economy. Temperate and tropical waters merge here, making it a popular place for scuba diving and snorkelling. Most diving is done at Julian Rocks, 2.5 kilometres from the town and part of the Cape Byron Marine Park. Subtropical rainforests are nearby, and areas such as the Nightcap National Park and its Minyon Falls are within easy reach of the town.

Byron Bay is a popular destination for Schoolies week during late November and early December.

==Events==
Festivals held in or near Byron Bay include the Byron Bay Bluesfest at Tyagarah at Easter, Falls Festival NYE and Splendour in the Grass, the Byron Bay International Fashion Festival on 29 April each year, the Byron Bay Writers Festival, the Byron Bay Film Festival, Byron Bay Surf Festival, Byron Spirit Festival and the Byron Underwater Festival. The Byron Bay Triathlon is held on the second Saturday in May every year; 1,300 competitors from many countries enter this Olympic Distance event. The vibrant musical community has produced internationally renowned bands such as Blue King Brown, Parkway Drive and 50 Lions.

==Markets==
Byron Bay has a number of regular markets including a weekly farmers&#x27; market at the Cavanbah Centre every Thursday with over 70 local farmers selling fresh produce. There is also a Byron Community Market held on the same site on the first Sunday of each month and the Artisan Market held on Saturday evenings at Railway Park from October to Easter. There are three annual specialist Beachside Markets held in January, Easter and September.

==Transport==
A bus interchange is located west of the old railway station along Butler Street and is served by Greyhound Australia, NSW TrainLink and Premier Motor Services coach services from Sydney and Brisbane.

The privately run Byron Bay Train operates a shuttle service on a rehabilitated 3 km section of the disused Murwillimbah line between Byron Bay station in the Byron township and North Beach station, adjacent to the Elements of Byron resort. The service opened in December 2017, and uses an ex-NSWGR railmotor, converted to run exclusively on solar power using panels on top of the train and at the stations.

Until 2004, Byron Bay railway station was a stop on the Casino to Murwillumbah railway line. It was served by trains from Sydney and, for various periods, also by services originating at Casino that connected with expresses running between Sydney and South Brisbane.

An earlier local train service, known as the Byron Bay Tram conveyed passengers from about 1928 until about 1954 between the railway station and the &quot;new jetty&quot; where connections were made with passenger carrying ships of the North Coast Steam Navigation Company. Motive power was a Simplex petrol locomotive, locally known as the &quot;Green Frog&quot;, and the passenger vehicles comprised former Newcastle B2 class steam tram trailer 74B and former Sydney C class electric tram C37. After the trams stopped running both the cars went to a heritage tramway in Parramatta Park where 74B was destroyed by fire. The Simplex was built in Bedford England and went into service in 1923 shunting freight to and from the &quot;old&quot; jetty adjacent to the township and then to &quot;new&quot; jetty to the north when it was completed in 1928. Later it hauled whales from the jetty to the rendering down works, livestock to the meat works, mineral sands and meat wagons to the station for onward movement and regularly shunted Norco and other railway sidings and between these duties ran the passenger tramway until the coastal passenger shipping service stopped. The Simplex locomotive was retired in 1984 when the meat works closed and is now stored in a shed near the Kendall Street level crossing under the care of volunteers and the Byron Bay Council.

== In popular culture==

John Macgregor&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;Propinquity&quot; is partly set in Byron Bay and nearby Mullumbimby. The 2008/2009 ABC drama series &quot;East of Everything&quot;, written by Deb Cox and Roger Monk, is set in the fictional town of Broken Bay which is based on a somewhat more run-down version of Byron Bay and its surrounds, with much of the filming taking place in and around Byron Bay including obviously recognisable landmarks such as the lighthouse and local beaches. Parts of the 2014 film &quot;The Inbetweeners 2&quot; take place in Byron Bay. The town also features in the 2016 open world racing video game, &quot;Forza Horizon 3&quot; and is where the Horizon Byron Bay Festival is situated. In July 2019 Byron Bay was used in Neighbours for the return storyline for Dee Bliss.

The driver&#x27;s license of Zak in &quot;&quot; (1992) indicates that he resides in Byron Bay, suggesting that the plot of the movie occurs in Australia.

<text>Anita Page (born Anita Evelyn Pomares; August 4, 1910 – September 6, 2008) was an American film actress who reached stardom in the final years of the silent film era.

She was referred to as &quot;a blond, blue-eyed Latin&quot; and &quot;the girl with the most beautiful face in Hollywood&quot; in the 1920s. She retired from acting in 1936, but made a comeback in 1961, then she retired again. Page returned to acting 35 years later in 1996 and appeared in four films in the 2000s.

== Early life ==
Anita Evelyn Pomares was born on August 4, 1910, in Flushing, Queens, New York. Her parents were Marino Leo Pomares, who was originally from Brooklyn, and Maude Evelyn (née Mullane) Pomares. She had one brother, Marino Pomares Jr., who later worked for her as a gym instructor, and her mother worked as her secretary and her father as her chauffeur. Page&#x27;s paternal grandfather Salvador Marino Pomares, was from Cuba, and had worked as a consul in El Salvador. Her paternal grandmother Anna Muñoz was Venezuelan, of Castilian Spanish and French descent.

== Career ==
=== Silent films and early talkies ===

Page entered films with the help of friend, actress Betty Bronson. A photo of Page was spotted by a man who handled Bronson&#x27;s fan mail who was also interested in representing actors. With the encouragement of her mother, Page telephoned the man who arranged a meeting for her with a casting director at Paramount Studios. After doing a screen test for Paramount, she became among the first residents of the Chateau Marmont. Page was offered contracts by both studios and selected MGM, &quot;because they were so good for female actresses. If you ask me, MGM was &quot;the&quot; studio.&quot;

Page&#x27;s first film for MGM was the 1928 comedy-drama &quot;Telling the World&quot;, opposite William Haines. Her performance in her second MGM film, &quot;Our Dancing Daughters&quot; (1928) opposite Joan Crawford was a success and it inspired two similar films in which they also co-starred, &quot;Our Modern Maidens&quot; and &quot;Our Blushing Brides&quot;. &quot;I used to say that we&#x27;re going to be &#x27;The Galloping Grandmothers&#x27; at the rate we&#x27;re going with these pictures,&quot; she reminisced in 1993.

&quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; (1929) is considered among her more successful films, and it won Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Page transitioned to sound films, although she criticized the total loss of silent films. &quot;In my opinion, silents were much better than talkies. One thing you had was mood music, which you could have playing throughout your scene to inspire you. My favorite song was &#x27;My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice&#x27; from &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;. I never seemed to tire of it. The trouble with talkies was, they let you have the music, but they&#x27;d stop it when you had to talk, and it was always a let down for me.&quot;

When not working on films, she was busy with studio photographer George Hurrell creating publicity shots. She was one of his early subjects, and her photograph was his first to be published. MGM played up her heritage in these press releases such as this 1932 blurb: &quot;She is that rarest and most interesting type of beauty...A Spanish blonde&quot;, and dubbed her &quot;a blonde, blue-eyed Latin&quot;.

She was the leading lady to Lon Chaney, Buster Keaton, Robert Montgomery, Clark Gable and others. During the early 1930s, she was one of Hollywood&#x27;s busier actresses. She was involved romantically with Gable briefly during that time. At the height of her popularity, she was receiving more fan mail than any other female star, with the exception of Greta Garbo, and received several marriage proposals from Benito Mussolini in the mail.

=== Retirement ===
When her contract expired in 1933, she announced her retirement from acting at the age of 23. She retired as she was denied a pay rise. She made one more movie, &quot;Hitch Hike to Heaven&quot;, in 1936, and then retired fully from acting. Later, Page claimed that Irving Thalberg had offered her the starring role in three movies if she would sleep with him, which she refused.

She married composer Nacio Herb Brown in 1934. The marriage was annulled a year later because Brown&#x27;s previous divorce had not been finalized at the time they were married. She married Navy pilot Lieutenant Hershel A. House on January 9, 1937, in Yuma, Arizona. They moved to Coronado, California and lived there until his death in 1991. They had two daughters, Linda and Sandra.

=== Return to acting ===
Page came back to acting and portrayed a nun in &quot;The Runaway&quot;, completed in 1961, but she cut short her comeback. She returned to acting in 1996 after 35 years of retirement and appeared in several low-budget horror films. Film veteran Margaret O&#x27;Brien appeared in two of them.

== Later years and death ==
Page was the last living attendee of the first Academy Awards ceremony in 1929, and frequently gave interviews as the &quot;last star of the silents&quot;, appearing in documentaries about the era.

Page died in her sleep at the age of 98 on September 6, 2008, at her home in Los Angeles, where she had lived with long-time companion Randal Malone. She is buried in the Holy Cross Cemetery in San Diego.

== Legacy ==
For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Anita Page has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6116 Hollywood Boulevard.

== Personal life ==
Page said she dated Ramon Novarro, her co-star in the 1929 silent film &quot;The Flying Fleet&quot;, and he asked her to marry him but she turned him down.

Page was a Democrat who supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election. Page was a Catholic.

Anita&#x27;s second marriage was to Herschel Austin House in 1937. They lived in southern California and were together for 54 years until Herschel&#x27;s death in 1991 at the age of 84. Herschel had retired from the Navy as a rear admiral. They had two daughters, Sandra and Linda, and they are buried together under his last name.

<doc id="593879" wikidata="Q6260805" url="?curid=593879" title="John Thwaites (British politician)">
<text>Sir John Thwaites (24 May 1815 – 8 August 1870) was a British politician who was the first Chairman of the Metropolitan Board of Works and therefore the first leaders of local government in London.

==Background==
Thwaites was a native of Maulds Meaburn, Westmorland where his father was a farmer. He attended Reagill School. As the third son he was not expected to follow in his father&#x27;s stead, and went to London in 1832 to work for Henry Bardwell, a woollen draper on Holborn Hill; in 1835, he became a partner in the business, which had a base on Oxford Street. In 1842, he left to establish his own company at 18 Blackman Street in The Borough; it later moved to 61-2 Borough High Street.

==Municipal work==
His religion led Thwaites into municipal affairs. He was a Strict Baptist and preached at several locations including the Surrey Tabernacle (where he was Deacon for sixteen years), St Mary&#x27;s Newington Butts, St Paul&#x27;s Deptford and St Saviour; this led to opportunities to be a churchwarden and Guardian of the Poor. He became known for his work with the local community and was Chairman of the Guardians. Thwaites also acted to support local business: when he discovered there was a monopoly on the supply of gas in Southwark, Thwaites set up the Surrey Gas Consumers company in 1849, a mutual association of businesses, to get alternative and much cheaper supplies.

He was made a member of more than one Vestry, which handled local government for the parish, and was also delegated to the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers from Southwark. He knew the problem of sewerage (the most pressing problem in London) well enough to write a well-received and knowledgeable pamphlet about it. Politically, Thwaites supported Parliamentary Reform and the Liberal Party, especially Apsley Pellatt who was Liberal MP for Southwark. He also supported the early closing movement which campaigned to allow shopworkers more time off work.

==On the MBW==
In 1855 the Metropolitan Board of Works was established to co-ordinate work throughout London, to be composed of delegates from the Vestries. Thwaites was selected by two different Vestries to be their delegate, and his involvement across London and on the Commission of Sewers led to his election by the Board to be their Chairman on 22 December 1855. Thwaites therefore became responsible for the wholescale construction of a sewerage system, as well as street works and other infrastructure. He was fortunate in obtaining the services of Sir Joseph Bazalgette, formerly Deputy Chief Engineer to the Commission of Sewers, as the Board&#x27;s Chief Engineer.

Thwaites persuaded the Government to give responsibility for the construction of the Victoria Embankment, which was part of the new drainage, to the Metropolitan Board. A Royal Commission had recommended a special body of commissioners take responsibility. The embankment was held up by delays in the construction of the Metropolitan District Railway, and eventually Thwaites went ahead without it; the railway was put in later.

==Honours and death==
When the main drainage was complete in 1865, Thwaites was knighted. The Victoria Embankment was finally completed and opened in July 1870, a few weeks before Thwaites&#x27; death. His illness was caused partly by overwork which contributed to his problems from diabetes, but ironically, in view of his work on building London&#x27;s sewerage system, Thwaites died of cholera at his Wandsworth home. He was followed in the job of chairman by James Macnaghten Hogg MP.

As a Leader, Thwaites was respected but regarded as somewhat formal. He was nicknamed &quot;The Stiff&#x27;un&quot; by the Board&#x27;s staff. He tried to keep involved in all aspects of the Board and insisted that those who were too infirm or too old should retire. He was described as having &quot;a stony gaze and a sepulchral voice&quot;.

<doc id="593885" wikidata="Q7016159" url="?curid=593885" title="1990 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1990 New Zealand general election was held on 27 October to determine the composition of the 43rd New Zealand parliament. The governing Labour Party was defeated in a landslide, ending its two terms in office. The National Party, led by Jim Bolger, won the largest majority government in New Zealand history.

This election was the first time since 1975 that National had won the popular vote.

==Background==
The Labour Party had taken office after defeating the National Party under Robert Muldoon in the 1984 election. David Lange became prime minister and Roger Douglas became Minister of Finance. The economic program outlined by Douglas was deeply unpopular with Labour&#x27;s traditional supporters, however – deregulation, privatisation, and free trade, all opposed by the party&#x27;s more left-wing members, were a key part of the Rogernomics platform. This internal dissent was off-set somewhat by new social legislation and a strong stance against nuclear weapons.

Labour was re-elected in the 1987 election with its parliamentary majority untouched, but the internal disputes continued. Eventually Lange forced Douglas to resign in December 1988, but continued destabilisation of his leadership by Douglas had weakened Lange&#x27;s position such that he resigned eight months later. He was replaced as prime minister by Geoffrey Palmer, but Palmer failed to revive Labour&#x27;s falling popularity. Several months before the election, Palmer was replaced by Mike Moore. The National Party was performing strongly – its leader, Jim Bolger, spoke repeatedly of &quot;the Decent Society&quot;, saying that the reforms were doing significant damage to the social fabric of the country. The government was also being challenged by the NewLabour Party, founded by renegade MP Jim Anderton.

===MPs retiring in 1990===
Five National MPs and eleven Labour MPs intended to retire at the end of the 42nd Parliament.

==The election==
The date for the 1990 election was 27 October. 2,202,157 people were registered to vote, and 85.2% of these people turned out. The number of seats being contested was 97 – this was the same as in the previous election, which had the largest number of seats for any Parliament until that point.

==Summary of results==
The 1990 election eventually saw a victory for the National Party, then in opposition. National won nearly half (48%) of the vote and 67 (69%) of the seats, becoming the fourth National government. This was the highest number of seats the party had ever won, either in absolute terms or as a percentage, and by extension the largest majority government in New Zealand history. Four new (and young) National MPs: (Bill English, Tony Ryall, Roger Sowry and Nick Smith) were called the &quot;brat pack&quot; by Sir Robert Muldoon (himself one of the &quot;Young Turks&quot; of 1960).

The new Green Party gained the third-highest number of votes, but won no seats. The NewLabour Party won a single seat, due to Jim Anderton retaining the Sydenham seat he originally won as a Labour candidate.

The governing Labour Party, by contrast, suffered its worst-ever defeat since it first won power in the 1935 election, winning only 29 (30%) of the seats and 35% of the vote (its lowest percentage since 1931), and losing 27 seats. Initially it appeared that twelve ministers and the Speaker had lost their seats, but Fran Wilde scraped in on special votes. Many of Labour&#x27;s talented &quot;class of 84&quot; were swept out, though five of them, Annette King, Jim Sutton, Trevor Mallard, Richard Northey and Judy Keall, returned in 1993.

The result was primarily due to intense anger at Labour and its policies (shown by it losing 12% of the vote) rather than love of National (which only increased its vote by 4%).

<text>Rising Damp is a British sitcom, written by Eric Chappell and produced by Yorkshire Television for ITV, which was originally broadcast from 2 September 1974 until 9 May 1978. Chappell adapted the story from his 1973 stage play &quot;The Banana Box&quot;. The programme ran for four series and a spin-off feature film of the same name was released in 1980. The series won the 1978 BAFTA for Best Situation Comedy. &quot;Rising Damp&quot; was the highest-ranking ITV sitcom in the BBC&#x27;s 100 Best Sitcoms poll of 2004, coming in 27th overall.

==Premise==
&quot;Rising Damp&quot; starred Leonard Rossiter, Frances de la Tour, Richard Beckinsale and Don Warrington. Rossiter played Rupert Rigsby (originally Rooksby in the stage play), the miserly, seedy, and ludicrously self-regarding landlord of a run-down Victorian townhouse who rents out his shabby bedsits to a variety of tenants. Beckinsale played Alan Moore, a long-haired, naive, good-natured and amiable medical student who occupies the top room. Frances de la Tour played Ruth Jones, a fey, whimsical spinster and college administrator who rents another room, is approaching middle age, and with whom Rigsby is in love.

In the pilot episode, a new tenant arrives. Philip Smith (Don Warrington) is a planning student who claims to be the son of an African chief. As a black man, he brings out the ill-informed fears and knee-jerk suspicions of Rigsby. However, the landlord quickly accepts his new tenant and henceforth regards him with a wary respect; wary because of Philip&#x27;s intelligence and smooth manners, and especially because Miss Jones finds herself attracted to the handsome sophisticate.

Of these four principal actors, only Beckinsale was a new recruit – the others had all played their roles in the original stage play. Beckinsale stated that he had originally been approached to appear in the play but was unavailable, so when the part in the television series later came up, he &quot;jumped at the chance of playing Alan.&quot;

In the first series, there was another tenant, Spooner, a professional wrestler, played by Derek Newark. Rigsby gets on his bad side when he and Alan &#x27;borrow&#x27; his clothes in the episode &quot;A Night Out.&quot; Spooner made only two appearances but is mentioned in other episodes in Series 1. Other tenants occasionally move into the house but never became permanent residents, often appearing only in a single episode. Peter Bowles and Peter Jeffrey were among the actors portraying these tenants.

Frances de la Tour temporarily left the series in 1975, after appearing in four episodes of the second series, because of theatre commitments. She was replaced by Gabrielle Rose for three episodes as new tenant Brenda (she also appeared in la Tour&#x27;s last episode of 1975 &quot;Moonlight and Roses&quot;), whilst Henry McGee also stood in for one episode as new tenant and conman Seymour. Frances de la Tour returned for the final two series.

Richard Beckinsale did not appear in the fourth series due to West End theatre commitments. Eric Chappell wrote some lines into the intended first episode &quot;Fire and Brimstone&quot; to explain Alan&#x27;s absence (he had passed his exams to become a doctor) but these were cut when it was decided to broadcast the second episode &quot;Hello Young Lovers&quot; as the first episode instead.

Eric Chappell defended Rigsby by saying he &quot;was not a racist or a bigot, but he was prejudiced and suspicious of strangers. But he accepted Philip and his only concern afterwards was that he didn&#x27;t get a leg over Miss Jones.&quot; Don Warrington stated: &quot;There were certain aspects of it that were politically incorrect. On the other, you can see how it held up a mirror to the way we were living.&quot;

===Setting===
The setting is a rundown Victorian townhouse let out as bedsits in Yorkshire. The exact setting is not explicitly stated although it is implied to be Leeds, through references to Leeds United, Yorkshire Traction, the M62 and the Corn Exchange. The show was recorded entirely before a studio audience at The Leeds Studios of Yorkshire Television in Leeds and featured no scenes shot on location. The film, however, is set in and was filmed in London.

===Emphasis on personal failure===
The programme depicts closely the failing lives of three of the four main characters. Rigsby is longtime separated from his wife and has since become a seedy, ignorant man who is suspicious of anyone different from himself. Miss Jones is an unhappy spinster who is shown to be desperate for male attention (even willing, in effect, to pay for it). Alan is a medical student with a somewhat plodding intellect, socially inept and who remains a virgin throughout much of the series, despite appearing to be in his mid 20s. Philip, by contrast, is a relatively learned and emotionally intelligent man, who responds to Rigsby&#x27;s ignorance with a kind of ironic complicity, as expressed through lies reminiscing about his African life full of magic, violence and sexual promiscuity, often resulting in Rigsby making a fool of himself through his gullible willingness to believe these stories.

==Characters==
===Rupert Rigsby===
The landlord of the house, Rupert Rigsby (Leonard Rossiter) is dour, interfering and tight fisted. He has strong right-wing views which are adopted without morals or reason. For example, in the film adaptation he states that hanging should be reinstated &quot;but this time in public&quot;. Rigsby is an old-fashioned &quot;colonial type&quot; with prejudiced views. He is suspicious of anything beyond his parochial sphere of interest and, most particularly of Philip, who is suave, intelligent, well-spoken, and black. He is also jealous of Philip because he is enigmatic, adroit, charismatic, and educated, all that Rigsby aspires to be but is not. Rigsby is an ardent patriot, believing himself to be an illegitimate member of the British royal family. He also makes exaggerated and romanticised references to his military service during World War II, frequently referring to &quot;a bit of trouble with the old shrapnel&quot; and fighting at the Battle of Dunkirk: &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen fear like that since Dunkirk&quot;. He also refers to seeing action at the Battle of Anzio and being in Africa during the Second World War. Rigsby is also a tremendous snob, obsessed with being perceived as middle class. He often affects an &quot;old school tie&quot; attitude – another of his fantasies. While Rigsby tries to flirt with the upper classes, when they invariably reject him, he distances himself, declaring himself to be a &quot;self-made man&quot; and calling the prospective Conservative candidate an &quot;upper-class twit&quot; after he refers to Rigbsy&#x27;s lodging house as the &quot;unacceptable face of capitalism&quot; and accuses Rigsby of having cheated at billiards in the local Conservative club.

Seedy and furtive, Rigsby has poor interpersonal skills. His professed love of Miss Jones is mostly sexual. She rejects him due to him being married, until his marriage ends, and Miss Jones accepts his proposal.

As he pries and spies upon his tenants, Rigsby often carries Vienna, his large, fluffy, long-haired, black-and-white tomcat. Rigsby&#x27;s amiable pet, and confidant, is so named because, as Rigsby tells it, when he goes to put him out on a cold dark night, &quot;if there is another set of eyes out there, then it&#x27;s Good Night, Vienna&quot;.

Rigsby was known by his surname only for almost the entirety of &quot;Rising Damp&quot;; his first name (Rupert) was revealed in the third episode of the fourth series. Several members of Rigsby&#x27;s family - his estranged wife Veronica (Avis Bunnage), his Aunt Maud (Gretchen Franklin) and his shifty brother Ron - make guest appearances in the fourth series.

===Ruth Jones===
Miss Jones (Frances de la Tour) is a middle-aged spinster. A college administrator and well-educated, she is a dauntless romantic; like Rigsby, Miss Jones has pretensions, believing herself to be a sophisticated aesthete worthy of more satisfaction from her life. The comedy uses pathos to touch upon her frustration and disappointment; in one episode she gives money to a man she has romantic interest in, knowing full well he is conning her, but craving romantic attention to a point where she is willing to effectively pay him for it. The only male attention she has is from Rigsby, to which she is intermittently susceptible, though mostly finding his approaches an annoyance, for besides being of sexual interest, Rigsby sees Miss Jones as an upper-middle-class sophisticate and any courtship would be a social as well as sexual conquest. However, Miss Jones openly desires Philip, frequently cooking for him and inviting his company in her room, much to the annoyance and frustration of Rigsby. Unfortunately for her, this interest is not reciprocated although she finds solace in Philip&#x27;s superior intellect and good manners, and the two appear to be friends. De La Tour had in fact only just turned 30 years old when the first series was filmed in the summer of 1974.

===Alan Moore===
Alan Guy Moore (Richard Beckinsale) is a likeable young medical student. Rigsby treats him with mistrust, mainly because of Alan&#x27;s permissive, left-wing views. Alan has little luck with girlfriends but is content with his life. Alan hails from a middle-class family and appreciates music and arts. Although Alan is academically successful, socially he is somewhat inept, appearing to have few friends outside of the lodging house. Alan occasionally confides his problems in Rigsby, who is always unsympathetic. On one occasion however, Alan is defended by Rigsby, when the incandescent father of Sandra, one of his girlfriends, suspects the two of them have been having sex, Rigsby sends the man out of the house with a &quot;flea in his ear&quot;, defending Alan, apparently because Rigsby was offended the man assumed Rigsby to be Alan&#x27;s father. Alan is immature and Rigsby does become something of a strange father figure for him.

Alan did not appear in the last series of Rising Damp due to Richard Beckinsale&#x27;s other acting commitments.

===Philip Smith===
Philip Smith (Don Warrington) is a second-generation British African from Croydon, although for all of the series he claims to be an &quot;African Prince&quot; and the son of an African tribal chief. Philip&#x27;s lies about his &quot;primitive&quot; background seem most obviously an ironic response to Rigsby&#x27;s ignorant remarks, and sometimes result in moments when Rigsby&#x27;s gullibility and desperation lead to his belief in some aspect of Philip&#x27;s lore: for example, the &quot;love wood&quot; which fails to excite Miss Jones. Philip is an intelligent, educated man (more so than the moderately educated Alan and Miss Jones), he is sophisticated and suave; this makes Rigsby suspicious of him, particularly as Miss Jones openly fancies him. Philip does not reciprocate Miss Jones&#x27;s romantic interest. Warrington told &quot;The Telegraph&quot; in 2013: &quot;The difficulty for Rigsby lies in observing somebody who is exactly who he would like to be – apart from the fact that he is black – and that’s very confusing for him.&quot;

Croydon was not revealed to be the true birthplace of Philip until the film version of &quot;Rising Damp&quot; (1980). Warrington commented in Britain&#x27;s 50 Best Sitcoms on Channel 4, that this fact was planned to be a plot development in the TV series, but the death of Richard Beckinsale meant this was not possible. In fact, in the film when Phillip informed Rigsby of the fact that he was not an African Prince, Rigsby dismissed that cheerfully and said that there &quot;could have been royalty somewhere&quot; in his heritage.

==Episodes==
==Film==

A feature film version was released in 1980, reusing several storylines from the television series. As Richard Beckinsale had died the year before, Christopher Strauli was cast as a new character, art student John. The character of Alan is briefly referenced, as having left. The film&#x27;s theme song features lyrics by Eric Chappell and was released as a 7&quot; single. The B-side features comedy dialogue between Rigsby and Miss Jones.

Philip is revealed not to be a chief&#x27;s son from Africa, but from Croydon, adopting his false persona to start a new life and gain respect. When Rigsby finds out, he tells Philip that he believes he must have some royal ancestry and he does not tell the rest of the characters about his deception. This plotline is from the original stageplay &quot;The Banana Box&quot;.

==Repeats, DVD and scripts==
The series has been repeated frequently in the UK, appearing on ITV, The Family Channel (1993–96), Channel 4 (1998-2004), UK Gold (1997–98), Plus (2001–03) (formerly Granada Plus/G Plus), ITV3, and, since 2024, That&#x27;s TV.

The series aired in the United States and Canada on A&amp;E from 1991–1992. It also aired on the US version of the network prior to that, in the mid-1980s.

The complete series has been released on Region 2 DVD under the Granada Media, Cinema Club and ITV DVD labels; from 2006 to 2008, Acorn Media released it on region 1 DVD in North American markets. On screen episode titles have been added to the Region 2 DVD versions of series 1 &amp; 2. The episode titles on series 3 &amp; 4 are however original. Also, the Region 1 releases are the only ones to retain the Yorkshire Television Colour Production frontcaps/endboards, as well as the &quot;end of part one&quot; and &quot;part two&quot; ad-break captions. All of these presentation elements are edited out of the Region 2 releases.

During the 2016 Easter holiday, the entire series and film were shown on ITV3, accompanied by a brand new two-part documentary, &quot;Rising Damp Forever&quot;, featuring cast and crew recollections on the making of the show.

In November 2020, all four series of the show were made available for streaming in the U.K., U.S., and Canada via the online digital subscription service BritBox.

A guide to the show called &quot;Rising Damp: A Celebration&quot; was written by Richard Webber and published in 2001. The book features a history of the show&#x27;s development, along with an episode guide, interviews, and profiles of the people who worked on the show.

The complete scripts for the series were published by Granada Media Group in the 2002 book &quot;Rising Damp: The Complete Scripts&quot;. This collection does not include the feature film version. In his introduction, Eric Chappell writes: &quot;When I decided to publish the scripts of &quot;Rising Damp&quot; my first thought was, did I have them all? What followed was a desperate search in the loft amongst piles of mildewed papers until I found them.… The scripts were written in feverish haste by someone who didn’t really know what he was doing, and who was finding things out as he went along. I didn’t admit this at the time, even to myself. I took the view that sitcom writers fell into two categories: the quick and the dead, and I didn’t intend to be one of the latter!&quot;

In 2005, as part of ITV&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration, &quot;Rising Damp&quot; was one of six shows chosen to be represented on a Royal Mail postage stamp.

==Meaning of the title==

Rising damp is a condition caused by ground moisture rising up a masonry wall by capillary action. It often occurs where there is no damp-proof course (DPC) or where the DPC has been damaged or bridged. Older houses, such as depicted in the show, were built without damp-proof courses or with a barrier material that is liable to failure.

In the British climate, water infiltration of structures is a common problem, particularly in older houses without a basement or cellar and those constructed before the commonplace use of a damp course. Penetrating damp is visible as a darker patch on the plaster lining of the inner wall, usually starting at floor level on the ground floor and rising up from there, hence the term &#x27;rising damp&#x27;. In extreme cases, salt leached out of the wall forms crystals on the surface of the plaster as the water evaporates. The appearance of rising damp in a house suggests a degree of neglect, age, decrepitude etc.

==Home releases==

This includes the film version, since Carlton had acquired the rights to the film, and through the mergers of the various ITV companies Granada Television subsequently acquired the rights to both the Carlton and Yorkshire Television archives.

<text>Orcas Island () is the largest of the San Juan Islands of the Pacific Northwest, in northwestern Washington, United States.

==History and naming of the island==

The name &quot;Orcas&quot; is a shortened form of &quot;Horcasitas,&quot; from Juan Vicente de Güemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, the Viceroy of New Spain who sent an exploration expedition under Francisco de Eliza to the Pacific Northwest in 1791. During the voyage, Eliza explored part of the San Juan Islands. He did not apply the name Orcas specifically to Orcas Island, but rather to part of the archipelago. In 1847, Henry Kellett assigned the name to Orcas Island during his reorganization of the British Admiralty charts. Kellett&#x27;s work eliminated the patriotically American names that Charles Wilkes had given to many features of the San Juans during the Wilkes Expedition of 1838–1842. Wilkes had named Orcas Island &quot;Hull Island&quot; after Commodore Isaac Hull. Other features of Orcas Island Wilkes named include &quot;Ironsides Inlet&quot; for East Sound and &quot;Guerrier Bay&quot; for West Sound. One of the names Wilkes gave remains: Mount Constitution. Wilkes&#x27; names follow a pattern: Hull was the commander of &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; (the ) and won fame after capturing the British warship HMS &quot;Guerriere&quot; in the War of 1812. The islands were first claimed by Spain, then by Britain, who agreed, in the Treaty of Ghent signed after the War of 1812, that everything below the 49th parallel was part of the US. The Oregon territory, which then included Washington state and this island, was used jointly by the US and Britain until 1848, but border disputes specifically concerning the San Juan Islands, including the Pig War (1859), were not settled until 1871. The similarity to the name of the orca, which is popularly associated with coastal Washington state, is coincidental.

==Geography==
With an area of and a population of 6000 (2020 census), Orcas Island is slightly larger, but less populous, than neighboring San Juan Island. It is shaped like a pair of saddlebags, separated by fjord-like Eastsound, and two prominent bays, Westsound and Deer Harbor, on the southwest side. At the island&#x27;s northern end is the village of Eastsound, the largest population center on Orcas and the second largest in San Juan County.

Other, smaller hamlets on the island include Orcas Landing (where the inter-island/mainland ferry lands), West Sound (with Eastsound addresses), Deer Harbor, Rosario (with Eastsound addresses), Olga and Doe Bay. A number of former settlements no longer exist, which were mostly built up around the lime kiln and fruit growing industries.

==Island access== 

The state supports island access through the Washington State Ferries system. In addition, the island can be accessed through a variety of air, seaplane and sea charter services. Private watercraft can use public docks located near the villages around the island, and various public shoreline access points. During the summer season, there is an island shuttle van that runs from the ferry landing to Eastsound and other points.

==Arts and culture==

===Historic sites===
The island is home to two museums. The Orcas Island Historical Museum is located down town Eastsound and is the only object-based, interpretive heritage facility for the island, with a permanent collection containing approximately 6000 objects, paper documents and photographs. Crow Valley School Museum is a one-room school house built in 1888, open by appoint only.

Rosario Resort was built beginning in 1906 by Robert Moran, a former mayor of Seattle and a shipbuilder. Constructed in an Arts &amp; Crafts style, the 5-story resort was named after the Rosario Strait and contains a two-story German-style organ, operational since 1913, consisting of over 1,900 pipes. Also known as the Rosario Resort and Spa, it opened as such in 1960 and the hotel was also designed with a nautical style, containing stained glass windows, a Tiffany chandelier, and two libraries. The grounds were designed with paths and water features. Moran sold the resort in 1938 and several owners have overseen operations since.

Orcas Island is also home to three historic camps, the Camp Orkila, Four Winds Westward Ho, and Camp Indralaya.

===Media===
The &quot;Islands&#x27; Sounder&quot;, originally named the &quot;Orcas Sounder&quot;, is a weekly newspaper published in Eastsound since 1964.

==Public services==
The Orcas Island School District operates three schools on a single campus: Orcas Island Elementary School housed in the island&#x27;s historic Nellie S. Milton school building; Orcas Island Middle School; and Orcas Island High School. All of the island&#x27;s public schools are located in Eastsound.

The Orcas Island Public Library is located in Eastsound and serves a population of approximately 6,000 card holders. The Orcas Island Library District is a junior-taxing district that funds the Orcas Island Public Library&#x27;s operating budget through property taxes. The annual Library Fair sells books donated by Orcas Island residents and visitors, the proceeds of which are donated back to the Library&#x27;s operating budget.

In 2018 Orcas Island Voters approved the creation of San Juan County Public Hospital District #3 (OIHCD) and later elected five Commissioners to the board. OIHCD funds local health care services ensuring care services to locals.

== Parks ==
===Village Green===

The Village Green is located in the center of Eastsound village. The Village Green, with an expansive lawn and shade trees, picnic tables and outdoor performance stage, is the site of community gatherings, music performances, and the weekly farmer’s market.

===Buck Park===
Buck Park is located just north of the school on Mt. Baker Road. The park includes a world-class skateboard park, tennis courts, pickleball courts, baseball/softball and ultimate frisbee fields, soccer pitch, sand volleyball court, a fenced dog off-leash area, a new state-of-the-art running track, and the hub to a network of running trails and walking paths through the Eastsound area.

===Moran State Park===
Mount Constitution (elevation is the highest point in the San Juan islands. The mountain is part of Moran State Park, the largest public recreation area in the San Juan Islands, and the largest State Park in Washington. Moran State Park encompasses over of woodland and has several lakes, including Cascade Lake, Mountain Lake, Summit Lake, and Twin Lakes, and numerous waterfalls.

===Obstruction Pass State Park===
Obstruction Pass State Park is an 76-acre park with access to more than a mile of public saltwater shoreline on the south end of Orcas Island, south of Moran State Park.

===Madrona Point===
Madrona Point is a traditional burial ground which was controversially sold by the Cemetery Association in 1890. In 1989, the site was purchased out of private ownership for $2.2 million provided by the Department of the Interior. The site was returned to the Lummi Nation. The tribe agreed to manage the property as an open space open to individuals and groups under a memorandum of understanding with San Juan County. However, the Lummi Nation closed the site in 2007 citing disrespect to the land.

==In popular culture==
Two films use Orcas Island as a backdrop. The 2011 Film &quot;Your Sister&#x27;s Sister&quot; starring Emily Blunt was partially filmed on Orcas Island. While the 2022 Netflix Original film &quot;Lou&quot; is set on Orcas Island, it was not filmed on the island. In &quot;The Terminal List&quot;, Secretary of State Lorraine Hartley&#x27;s palatial family estate is located on Orcas Island.

The 2017 video game &quot;What Remains of Edith Finch&quot; takes place on the island.

Orcas Island is the setting for the book, The Girl Who Wrote in Silk, by Kelli Estes.

<doc id="593906" wikidata="Q1034320" url="?curid=593906" title="Cape Byron">
<text>Cape Byron is the easternmost point of the mainland of Australia, located in New South Wales. It is about east of the town of Byron Bay, New South Wales and projects into the Pacific Ocean at 28.6335° S, 153.6383° E. A lighthouse is situated there. It is a popular area for hiking and for whale watching. Two national parks, one a conservation area and a marine park, are on the bay.

Cape Byron has a significant influences on the open beaches to its north. Longshore drift transports sand northwards. Sand blocked by the cape drops off the continental shelf, which is very narrow here, at a rate of around 50,000 cubic metres of sand per year.

==History==

The cape was named by British explorer Captain James Cook, when he passed the area on 15 May 1770, to honour British explorer John Byron who circumnavigated the globe in HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot; from 1764 to 1766.

The MV &quot;Limerick&quot; was sunk off Cape Byron in 1943.

The Cape is part of the Cape Byron State Conservation Area.

==Cape Byron Light==

Built in 1901, the Cape Byron Lighthouse is the last of the great 19th-century Victorian era lighthouses managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS). It is constructed from concrete blocks and stands on the most easterly point of the Australian mainland.
==Cape Byron walking track==
The Cape Byron walking track winds through the Cape Byron State Conservation Area. The loop walk can be started at any point with parking available at Captain Cook Lookout, Palm Valley, Wategos Beach and the Lighthouse.

==Cape Byron Marine Park==
Cape Byron is part of the 22,000 hectare Cape Byron Marine Park, which was established in November 2002. The area is also noted for its wildlife, with the whale watching industry a significant contributor to the local economy. The park extends from Lennox Head in the south to northern bank of the Brunswick River mouth.

Cape Byron Marine Park is a multiple-use marine park which includes protected areas where fishing and collecting are prohibited, and general-use areas which support both commercial and recreational fishing. It extends from the Brunswick River to Lennox Head, and from mean high water out to three nautical miles from the coast or islands. It includes the tidal waters of the Brunswick River, Belongil and Tallow creeks. Migrating whales can typically be seen swimming past the Cape.

==Extreme points==
Australia has several other extreme points. These are Cape York, the northernmost point on the Australian mainland, South Point, the southernmost point on the Australian mainland, Steep Point, the westernmost point on the Australian mainland and Mount Kosciuszko, the uppermost point on the Australian mainland.

<doc id="593908" wikidata="Q1364905" url="?curid=593908" title="Propagation of uncertainty">
<text>In statistics, propagation of uncertainty (or propagation of error) is the effect of variables&#x27; uncertainties (or errors, more specifically random errors) on the uncertainty of a function based on them. When the variables are the values of experimental measurements they have uncertainties due to measurement limitations (e.g., instrument precision) which propagate due to the combination of variables in the function.

The uncertainty &quot;u&quot; can be expressed in a number of ways.
It may be defined by the absolute error . Uncertainties can also be defined by the relative error , which is usually written as a percentage.
Most commonly, the uncertainty on a quantity is quantified in terms of the standard deviation, , which is the positive square root of the variance. The value of a quantity and its error are then expressed as an interval . 
However, the most general way of characterizing uncertainty is by specifying its probability distribution.
If the probability distribution of the variable is known or can be assumed, in theory it is possible to get any of its statistics. In particular, it is possible to derive confidence limits to describe the region within which the true value of the variable may be found. For example, the 68% confidence limits for a one-dimensional variable belonging to a normal distribution are approximately ± one standard deviation from the central value , which means that the region will cover the true value in roughly 68% of cases.

If the uncertainties are correlated then covariance must be taken into account. Correlation can arise from two different sources. First, the &quot;measurement errors&quot; may be correlated. Second, when the underlying values are correlated across a population, the &quot;uncertainties in the group averages&quot; will be correlated.

In a general context where a nonlinear function modifies the uncertain parameters (correlated or not), the standard tools to propagate uncertainty, and infer resulting quantity probability distribution/statistics, are sampling techniques from the Monte Carlo method family. For very large datasets or complex functions, the calculation of the error propagation may be very expensive so that a surrogate model or a parallel computing strategy may be necessary.

In some particular cases, the uncertainty propagation calculation can be done through simplistic algebraic procedures. Some of these scenarios are described below.

==Linear combinations==
Let formula_1 be a set of &quot;m&quot; functions, which are linear combinations of formula_2 variables formula_3 with combination coefficients formula_4:
formula_5
or in matrix notation,
formula_6

Also let the variance–covariance matrix of be denoted by formula_7 and let the mean value be denoted by formula_8:
formula_9
formula_10 is the outer product.

Then, the variance–covariance matrix formula_11 of &quot;f&quot; is given by
formula_12

In component notation, the equation
formula_13
reads
formula_14

This is the most general expression for the propagation of error from one set of variables onto another. When the errors on &quot;x&quot; are uncorrelated, the general expression simplifies to
formula_15
where formula_16 is the variance of &quot;k&quot;-th element of the &quot;x&quot; vector.
Note that even though the errors on &quot;x&quot; may be uncorrelated, the errors on &quot;f&quot; are in general correlated; in other words, even if formula_7 is a diagonal matrix, formula_11 is in general a full matrix.

The general expressions for a scalar-valued function &quot;f&quot; are a little simpler (here a is a row vector):
formula_19
formula_20

Each covariance term formula_21 can be expressed in terms of the correlation coefficient formula_22 by formula_23, so that an alternative expression for the variance of &quot;f&quot; is
formula_24

In the case that the variables in &quot;x&quot; are uncorrelated, this simplifies further to
formula_25

In the simple case of identical coefficients and variances, we find
formula_26

For the arithmetic mean, formula_27, the result is the standard error of the mean:
formula_28

== Non-linear combinations ==

When &quot;f&quot; is a set of non-linear combination of the variables &quot;x&quot;, an interval propagation could be performed in order to compute intervals which contain all consistent values for the variables. In a probabilistic approach, the function &quot;f&quot; must usually be linearised by approximation to a first-order Taylor series expansion, though in some cases, exact formulae can be derived that do not depend on the expansion as is the case for the exact variance of products. The Taylor expansion would be:
formula_29
where formula_30 denotes the partial derivative of &quot;fk&quot; with respect to the &quot;i&quot;-th variable, evaluated at the mean value of all components of vector &quot;x&quot;. Or in matrix notation,
formula_31
where J is the Jacobian matrix. Since f0 is a constant it does not contribute to the error on f. Therefore, the propagation of error follows the linear case, above, but replacing the linear coefficients, &quot;Aki&quot; and &quot;Akj&quot; by the partial derivatives, formula_32 and formula_33. In matrix notation,
formula_34

That is, the Jacobian of the function is used to transform the rows and columns of the variance-covariance matrix of the argument.
Note this is equivalent to the matrix expression for the linear case with formula_35.

=== Simplification ===
Neglecting correlations or assuming independent variables yields a common formula among engineers and experimental scientists to calculate error propagation, the variance formula:
formula_36
where formula_37 represents the standard deviation of the function formula_38, formula_39 represents the standard deviation of formula_40, formula_41 represents the standard deviation of formula_42, and so forth.

This formula is based on the linear characteristics of the gradient of formula_38 and therefore it is a good estimation for the standard deviation of formula_38 as long as formula_45 are small enough. Specifically, the linear approximation of formula_38 has to be close to formula_38 inside a neighbourhood of radius formula_45.

=== Example ===
Any non-linear differentiable function, formula_49, of two variables, formula_50 and formula_51, can be expanded as
formula_52
If we take the variance on both sides and use the formula for the variance of a linear combination of variables
formula_53
then we obtain
formula_54
where formula_55 is the standard deviation of the function formula_38, formula_57 is the standard deviation of formula_50, formula_59 is the standard deviation of formula_51 and formula_61 is the covariance between formula_50 and formula_51.

In the particular case that Then
formula_64
or
formula_65
where formula_66 is the correlation between formula_50 and formula_51.

When the variables formula_50 and formula_51 are uncorrelated, formula_71. Then
formula_72

===Caveats and warnings===
Error estimates for non-linear functions are biased on account of using a truncated series expansion. The extent of this bias depends on the nature of the function. For example, the bias on the error calculated for log(1+&quot;x&quot;) increases as &quot;x&quot; increases, since the expansion to &quot;x&quot; is a good approximation only when &quot;x&quot; is near zero.

For highly non-linear functions, there exist five categories of probabilistic approaches for uncertainty propagation; see Uncertainty quantification for details.

====Reciprocal and shifted reciprocal====

In the special case of the inverse or reciprocal formula_73, where formula_74 follows a standard normal distribution, the resulting distribution is a reciprocal standard normal distribution, and there is no definable variance.

However, in the slightly more general case of a shifted reciprocal function formula_75 for formula_76 following a general normal distribution, then mean and variance statistics do exist in a principal value sense, if the difference between the pole formula_77 and the mean formula_78 is real-valued.

====Ratios====

Ratios are also problematic; normal approximations exist under certain conditions.

==Example formulae==
This table shows the variances and standard deviations of simple functions of the real variables formula_79 with standard deviations formula_80 covariance formula_81 and correlation formula_82 The real-valued coefficients formula_50 and formula_51 are assumed exactly known (deterministic), i.e., formula_85

In the right-hand columns of the table, formula_86 and formula_87 are expectation values, and formula_38 is the value of the function calculated at those values.

For uncorrelated variables (formula_89, formula_90) expressions for more complicated functions can be derived by combining simpler functions. For example, repeated multiplication, assuming no correlation, gives
formula_91

For the case formula_92 we also have Goodman&#x27;s expression for the exact variance: for the uncorrelated case it is
formula_93
and therefore we have
formula_94

===Effect of correlation on differences===
If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are uncorrelated, their difference &quot;A&quot; − &quot;B&quot; will have more variance than either of them. An increasing positive correlation (formula_95) will decrease the variance of the difference, converging to zero variance for perfectly correlated variables with the same variance. On the other hand, a negative correlation (formula_96) will further increase the variance of the difference, compared to the uncorrelated case.

For example, the self-subtraction &quot;f&quot; = &quot;A&quot; − &quot;A&quot; has zero variance formula_97 only if the variate is perfectly autocorrelated (formula_98). If &quot;A&quot; is uncorrelated, formula_99 then the output variance is twice the input variance, formula_100 And if &quot;A&quot; is perfectly anticorrelated, formula_101 then the input variance is quadrupled in the output, formula_102 (notice formula_103 for &quot;f&quot; = &quot;aA&quot; − &quot;aA&quot; in the table above).

==Example calculations==

===Inverse tangent function===
We can calculate the uncertainty propagation for the inverse tangent function as an example of using partial derivatives to propagate error.

Define
formula_104
where formula_105 is the absolute uncertainty on our measurement of . The derivative of with respect to is
formula_106

Therefore, our propagated uncertainty is
formula_107
where formula_108 is the absolute propagated uncertainty.

===Resistance measurement===
A practical application is an experiment in which one measures current, , and voltage, , on a resistor in order to determine the resistance, , using Ohm&#x27;s law, .

Given the measured variables with uncertainties, and , and neglecting their possible correlation, the uncertainty in the computed quantity, , is:

formula_109

<doc id="593909" wikidata="Q3476289" url="?curid=593909" title="Shaw Island">
<text>Shaw Island is the smallest of the four San Juan Islands served by the Washington State Ferries. The island has a land area of and a small year-round population of 188 (2020 census). During the summer time, weekends swell with other residents and the occasional tourist.

==History==

The island is within the historical territory of the Lummi Nation. The United States obtained Shaw Island and the rest of the San Juan archipelago by treaty in 1855, but Lummi retained certain cultural and resource rights, including fishing.

The Wilkes Expedition, in 1841, named the island after John Shaw, a United States Naval Officer. According to Bill Tsilixw James, hereditary chief of the Lummi Nation, the Lummi know the island as Sq&#x27;emenen. A San Juan Island resident proposed to the state Board of Geographic Names in 2015 that Squaw Bay be renamed Sq&#x27;emenen Bay; that proposal generated a compromise proposal from the Shaw Island Historical Society to rename the bay Reef Net Bay, in recognition of the reef net fishing historically and currently done there. The name &quot;Reef Net Bay&quot; was adopted.

===History of nuns===
There have been three Catholic religious institutes of nuns on Shaw Island. Benedictine nuns established a monastery on in the 1970s; while the Sisters of Mercy have owned an unofficial retreat on the island since the 1980s. 
Nuns of the Franciscan Sisters of the Eucharist ran the island&#x27;s only store and the ferry terminal for almost 3 decades, until 2004, when they relocated elsewhere.

==Island infrastructure and amenities==

Shaw Island has a county park, a historic general store open all year, and a post office at the ferry landing. A member-supported library and historical museum are located near the middle of the island.

The University of Washington also owns property throughout the island, notably the Cedar Rock Preserve on the south side of the island, a gift from Robert H. Ellis, Jr. The stated vision for these properties is &quot;to maintain and restore native biodiversity and ecosystem function and to facilitate education and research that is consistent with these goals&quot; and &quot;to maintain important parts of the cultural landscape.&quot;

Shoreline access is best at the Shaw Island County Park, due to its vast beachline. There are of asphalt and of gravel public roads on Shaw. The primary roads are three loops in the interior of the island, with branches to the ferry dock, Shaw Island County Park, Neck Point, and part-way to the private property of Broken Point.

==Arts and culture==

===Historical structures===
Shaw Island School District #10, has an operational historic one-room school (although a second room was later added), with classes for kindergarten through eighth grade students. Known as the Little Red Schoolhouse, it has been in continuous use since it was built in 1891 and is the longest-running school in the State of Washington. The building is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

Shaw Island also has a small membership funded library and historical museum.

===Popular culture===
Shaw Island was featured during the fifth-season episode &quot;Access&quot; of the political drama &quot;The West Wing&quot; as the site of a standoff between terrorist suspects and the US government, similar to the Waco, Texas Branch Davidian standoff.
Shaw Island was mentioned in the movie &quot;Glory&quot;.

===Tourism===
Businesses pertaining to tourism are required to maintain the character of the island as a small-scale, rural, and agricultural community through the Shaw Subarea Plan of Washington State&#x27;s Growth Management Act. These include commercial recreational facilities; transient accommodations by themselves or in combination with any commercial use, food service facilities, and transient moorage and dry storage facilities.

<doc id="593912" wikidata="Q7058150" url="?curid=593912" title="Northern Beaches">
<text>The Northern Beaches is a region within Northern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia, near the Pacific coast. This area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to Middle Harbour and north to the entrance of Broken Bay. The area was formerly inhabited by the Garigal or Caregal people in a region known as Guringai country.

The Northern Beaches district is governed on a local level by the Northern Beaches Council, which was formed in May 2016 from Warringah Council (est. 1906), Manly Council (est. 1877), and Pittwater Council (est. 1992).

==History==
The traditional Aboriginal inhabitants of the land now known as the Northern Beaches were the Garigal people of the Eora nation.
Within a few years of European settlement, the Garigal had mostly disappeared from this area mainly due to an outbreak of smallpox in 1789. Much evidence of their habitation remains especially their rock etchings in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park which borders northern beaches&#x27;s north-western side. The northern beaches region was explored early on in the settlement of Sydney, only a few weeks after the arrival of the First Fleet. However, it remained a rural area for most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, with only small settlements in the valleys between headlands. While it was geographically close to the city centre, to reach the area over land from Sydney via Mona Vale Road was a trip of more than .

Since those days, urban growth proceeded slowly until the 1960s when development accelerated because of improved roads and a general increase in living standards in the regions.

In 1906, the Warringah Shire council was formed the NSW Government Gazette, along with 132 other new Shires within New South Wales. It ran roughly from Broken Bay in the north to Manly Lagoon to the south, and by Middle Harbour Creek and Cowan Creek in the west. Pittwater was incorporated as the &quot;A Riding&quot; of Warringah Shire, however for many years there existed a sentiment held by some in A Riding, the northern Riding and the largest in Warringah, taking up more than 40% of Warringah&#x27;s land area, that they were being increasingly ignored and subject to what they considered inappropriate development and policies for their area. This culminated in 1991 when a non-compulsory postal poll of the residents of A Riding was taken over the question of a possible secession. This resulted in a 73.5% vote in favour of secession, however only 48.18% of residents took part in this vote. This vote was, however, 600 short of the total majority required. Over time, the Northern Beaches was often divided by the &quot;Lower Northern Beaches&quot;, referring to the southern end of the region, and the &quot;Upper Northern Beaches&quot;, referring to the northern end of the region (North Narrabeen to Palm Beach).

In 2016, the Local Government (Council Amalgamations) Proclamation 2016 insisted that the Northern Beaches region councils of Manly, Warringah and Pittwater become the Northern Beaches Council. This was effective from 12 May 2016.

Today, the Northern Beaches is very well part of the Sydney metropolis, however maintains an isolated environment from the other regions of Sydney including the neighbouring North Shore region. The &quot;Forest District&quot; became an unofficial district within the Northern Beaches region to describe the suburbs between Ingleside and the Upper North Shore.

== Transport ==

Public transport in the Northern Beaches is primarily provided by buses. Major bus interchanges are at Pittwater Road at Brookvale, Dee Why, Mona Vale and Manly Wharf. Buses connect to Gordon, Chatswood and North Sydney stations on the North Shore line, served by Sydney Trains North Shore &amp; Western and Northern services, as well as stations in the CBD.

B-Line buses travel from Mona Vale to Wynyard, stopping at Warriewood, Narrabeen, Collaroy, Dee Why, Brookvale, Manly Vale, Spit Junction and Neutral Bay.

Manly ferry services operated by Sydney Ferries run from Manly to Circular Quay. The privately operated Manly Fast Ferry also runs to Circular Quay.

Palm Beach Water Airport is located in Palm Beach.

==Sports==
Notable sports teams include the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles (rugby league), North Harbour Rays, Manly RUFC, Warringah Rugby Club (rugby union), Manly Warringah District Cricket Club (cricket) and Manly United FC (soccer). The Sea Eagles play in the National Rugby League, and play their home games at Brookvale Oval.

<text>The richly textured landscape of the United States is a product of the dueling forces of plate tectonics, weathering and erosion. Over the 4.5 billion-year history of the Earth, tectonic upheavals and colliding plates have raised great mountain ranges while the forces of erosion and weathering worked to tear them down. Even after many millions of years, records of Earth&#x27;s great upheavals remain imprinted as textural variations and surface patterns that define distinctive landscapes or provinces.

The diversity of the landscapes of the United States can be easily seen on the shaded relief image to the right. The stark contrast between the &#x27;rough&#x27; texture of the western US and the &#x27;smooth&#x27; central and eastern regions is immediately apparent. Differences in roughness (topographic relief) result from a variety of processes acting on the underlying rock. The plate tectonic history of a region strongly influences the rock type and structure exposed at the surface, but differing rates of erosion that accompany changing climates can also have profound impacts on the land.

There are twelve main geological provinces in the United States: Pacific, Columbia Plateau, Basin and Range, Colorado Plateau, Rocky Mountains, Laurentian Upland, Interior Plains, Interior Highlands, Appalachian Highlands, Atlantic Plain, Alaskan, and Hawaiian. Each province has its own geologic history and unique features. This article will describe each province in turn.

==Pacific Province==
This region is one of the most geologically young and tectonically active in North America. The generally rugged, mountainous landscape of this province provides evidence of ongoing mountain-building.

The Pacific Province straddles the boundaries between several of Earth&#x27;s moving plates:the source of the monumental forces required to build the sweeping arc of mountains that extends from Alaska to the southern reaches of South America. This province includes the active and sometimes deadly volcanoes of the Cascade Range and the young, steep mountains of the Pacific Border and the Sierra Nevada.

===Sierra Nevada===
Although the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range form a nearly continuous barrier along the western edge of the United States, the two ranges really have very little in common. They have been and continue to be formed by quite different geological forces and processes.

The rocks that form the backbone of the Sierra Nevada are mostly granitic rocks that formed during the Mesozoic Era, when non-avian dinosaurs roamed the Earth. At that time, an arc-shaped chain of volcanoes, similar to the present-day Cascade volcanic arc, erupted where the Sierra Nevada now stands. Rising through older Paleozoic rock, molten rock erupted at the surface as lava, but most solidified deep within the earth, forming the gray granitic rocks familiar to any Sierra traveler.

Although from a distance the Sierran rock looks quite similar, it is actually made up of many individual rock bodies that formed from repeated intrusions of magma over many millions of years.

Even as they grew, erosion was wearing away these Mesozoic Era volcanoes. By Late Cretaceous time, about 70 million years ago, the once-deep granitic rocks began to be exposed at the Earth&#x27;s surface. By a few tens of millions of years ago, so much of the upper part had worn away that the surface of the ancient range had a low relief of just a few thousand feet.

It wasn&#x27;t until quite recently, geologically speaking, that the Sierra Nevada range as we know it today began to grow. During the Miocene Epoch, less than 20 million years ago, the continental crust east of the Sierra Nevada began to stretch in an east–west direction. The crust broke into a series of north–south-trending valleys and mountain ranges: the beginning of the Basin and Range province.
Less than five million years ago, the range that we now know as the Sierra Nevada began to rise along its eastern margin. Through a combination of uplift of the Sierran block and down-dropping of the area to the east, the Sierra rose upward. Rising far more steeply to the east than the west, the entire Sierra Nevada can be thought of as an enormous tilted fault block with a long, gentle slope westward to California&#x27;s Central Valley and steep eastern slope.

Not long after the Sierra uplift began, the Earth cooled, marking the beginning of the Pleistocene (Ice Age) Epoch. Glaciers grew in the Sierra highlands and made their way down former stream channels, carving U-shaped valleys. The sheer walls and hanging valleys of Yosemite National Park are a product of this chilly past.

===Cascades Volcanic Province===
Where the Sierra Nevada ends, a chain of explosive volcanic centers, the Cascade volcanoes, begins. The Cascades Province forms an arc-shaped band extending from British Columbia to Northern California, roughly parallel to the Pacific coastline. Within this region, 13 major volcanic centers lie in sequence like a string of explosive pearls.

Although the largest volcanoes like Mount St. Helens get the most attention, the Cascades is really made up of a band of thousands of very small, short-lived volcanoes that have built a platform of lava and volcanic debris. Rising above this volcanic platform are a few strikingly large volcanoes that dominate the landscape.

The Cascades volcanoes define the Pacific Northwest section of the Ring of Fire, an array of volcanoes that rim the Pacific Ocean. As if volcanic hazards were not enough, the Ring of Fire is also infamous for its frequent earthquakes. In order to understand the origins of this concentrated band of Earth hazards, we have to slice deep into the Earth.
A slice of the Earth from the Pacific Ocean through the Pacific Northwest might look something like the adjacent image. Beneath the Cascades, a dense oceanic plate plunges beneath the North American plate; a process known as subduction. As the oceanic slab sinks deep into the Earth&#x27;s interior beneath the continental plate, high temperatures and pressures allow water molecules locked in the minerals of solid rock to escape. The water vapor rises into the pliable mantle above the subducting plate, causing some of the mantle to melt. This newly formed magma rises toward the Earth&#x27;s surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes (the Cascade Range) above the subduction zone.
A close-up look at the Cascades reveals a more complicated picture than the simple subduction zone shown in the image on the left. Not far off the coast of the North Pacific lies a spreading ridge; a divergent plate boundary made up of a series of breaks in the oceanic crust where new ocean crust is created. On one side of the spreading ridge new Pacific plate crust is made, then moves away from the ridge. On the other side of the spreading ridge the Juan de Fuca plate and Gorda plate move eastward.

There are some unusual features at the Cascade subduction zone. Where the Juan de Fuca plate sinks beneath the North American plate there is no deep trench, seismicity (earthquakes) are fewer than expected, and there is evidence of a decline in volcanic activity over the past few million years. The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates. These two plates converge at 3–4 centimeters per year at present. This is only about half the rate of convergence of 7 million years ago.

The small Juan de Fuca plate and two platelets, the Explorer plate and Gorda plate are the meager remnants of the much larger Farallon oceanic plate. The Explorer plate broke away from the Juan de Fuca about 4 million years ago and shows no evidence that it is still being subducted. The Gorda platelet split away between 18 and 5 million years ago and continues to sink beneath North America.

The Cascade Range made its first appearance 36 million years ago, but the major peaks that rise up from today&#x27;s volcanic centers were born within the last 1.6 million years (during the Pleistocene). More than 3000 vents erupted during the most recent volcanic episode that began 5 million years ago. As long as subduction continues, new Cascade volcanoes will continue to rise.

==Columbia Plateau==
The Columbia Plateau province is enveloped by one of the world&#x27;s largest accumulations of lava. Over of the Earth&#x27;s surface is covered by it, an area roughly the size of the country of Spain. The topography here is dominated by geologically young lava flows that inundated the countryside with amazing speed, all within the last 17 million years.

Over of basaltic lava, known as the Columbia River basalts, covers the western part of the province. These tremendous flows erupted between 17 and 6 million years ago. Most of the lava flooded out in the first 1.5 million years: an extraordinarily short time for such an outpouring of molten rock.
The Snake River Plain stretches across Oregon, through northern Nevada, southern Idaho, and ends at the Yellowstone Plateau in Wyoming. Looking like a great spoon scooped out the Earth surface, the smooth topography of this province forms a striking contrast with the strong mountainous fabric around it.

The Snake River Plain lies in a distinct depression. At the western end, the base has dropped down along normal faults, forming a graben structure. Although there is extensive faulting at the eastern end, the structure is not as clear.

Like the Columbia River region, volcanic eruptions dominate the story of the Snake River Plain in the eastern part of the Columbia Plateau Province. The earliest Snake River Plain eruptions began about 15 million years ago, just as the tremendous early eruptions of Columbia River Basalt were ending. But most of the Snake River Plain volcanic rock is less than a few million years old, Pliocene age (5–1.6 million years ago) and younger.

In the west, the Columbia River Basalts are just that-almost exclusively black basalt. Not so in the Snake River Plain, where relatively quiet eruptions of soupy black basalt lava flows alternated with tremendous explosive eruptions of rhyolite, a light-colored volcanic rock.

Cinder cones dot the landscape of the Snake River Plain. Some are aligned along vents, the fissures that fed flows and cone-building eruptions. Calderas, great pits formed by explosive volcanism, and low shield volcanoes, and rhyolite hills are also part of the landscape here, but many are obscured by later lava flows.

Geologists usually associate volcanic eruptions with the boundaries between colliding or diverging plates. However, the focus of volcanism at Yellowstone in the Columbia Plateau Province is far inland from the subduction zone that lies along the Oregon and Washington coast. Evidence suggests that some concentrated heat source is melting rock beneath the Columbia Plateau Province, at the base of the lithosphere (the layer of crust and upper mantle that forms Earth&#x27;s moving tectonic plates). In an effort to figure out why this area, far from a plate boundary, had such an enormous outpouring of lava, scientists established hardening dates for many of the individual lava flows. They found that the youngest volcanic rocks were clustered near the Yellowstone Plateau, and that the farther west they went, the older the lavas.
A probable explanation is that a hot spot, an extremely hot plume of deep mantle material, is rising to the surface beneath the Columbia Plateau Province. We know that beneath Hawaii and Iceland, a temperature instability develops (for reasons not yet well understood) at the boundary between the core and mantle. The concentrated heat triggers a plume hundreds of kilometers in diameter that ascends directly through to the surface of the Earth.

When the hot plume arrives at the base of the lithosphere, some of the lighter rock of the lithosphere rapidly melts. It is this molten lithosphere that becomes the basalt lavas that gush onto the surface to form the Columbia River and Snake River Plain basalts.

The track of this hot spot starts in the west and sweeps up to Yellowstone National Park. The steaming fumaroles and explosive geysers are ample evidence of a concentration of heat beneath the surface. The hot spot is stationary, but the North American plate is moving over it, creating a record of the rate and direction of plate motion.

==Basin and Range==
The Basin and Range Province includes much of western North America. In the United States, it is bordered on the west by the eastern fault scarp of the Sierra Nevada and spans over to its eastern border marked by the Wasatch Fault, the Colorado Plateau and the Rio Grande Rift. The Basin and Range Province extends north to the Columbia Plateau and south as far as the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in Mexico, though the southern boundaries of the Basin and Range are debated.

The Basin and Range province has a characteristic topography that is familiar to anyone who ventures across it. Steep climbs up elongate mountain ranges alternate with long treks across flat, dry deserts. This basic topographic pattern extends from eastern California to central Utah, and from southern Idaho into the state of Sonora in Mexico. The forces which created this distinct topography lie deep beneath the surface.
Within the Basin and Range Province, the Earth&#x27;s crust (and upper mantle) has been stretched up to 100% of its original width. The entire region has been subjected to extension that thinned and cracked the crust as it was pulled apart, creating large faults. Along these roughly north–south-trending faults mountains were uplifted and valleys down-dropped, producing the distinctive alternating pattern of linear mountain ranges and valleys of the Basin and Range province.

Although there are other types of faults in the Basin and Range province, the extension and crustal stretching that have shaped the present landscape produce mostly normal faults. The upthrown side of these faults form mountains that rise abruptly and steeply, and the down-dropped side creates low valleys. The fault plane, along which the two sides of the fault move, extends deep in the crust, usually an angle of 60 degrees. In places, the relief or vertical difference between the two sides is as much as .

As the rocky ranges rise, they are immediately subject to weathering and erosion. The exposed bedrock is attacked by water, ice, wind and other erosional agents. Rock particles are stripped away and wash down the mountain sides, often covering young faults until they rupture again. Sediment collects in the adjacent valleys, in some places burying the bedrock under thousands of feet of rock debris.

Clarence Dutton famously compared the many narrow parallel mountain ranges that distinguish the unique topography of the Basin and Range to an &quot;army of caterpillars marching toward Mexico&quot;, which is a helpful way to visualize the overall appearance of the region. The Basin and Range province should not be confused with The Great Basin, which is a sub-section of the greater Basin and Range physiographic region defined by its unique hydrological characteristics (internal drainage).

===Great Basin===

The Great Basin is the geographical and hydrological region comprising most of Nevada, southern Oregon and Idaho, western Utah, and a little of eastern California. Characterized by internal drainage, this region&#x27;s surface water sources evaporate or percolate before they can flow to the ocean.

The Basin and Range province&#x27;s dynamic fault history has profoundly affected the Great Basin&#x27;s water drainage system. Most precipitation in the Great Basin falls in the form of snow that melts in the spring. Rain that reaches the ground, or snow that melts, quickly evaporates in the dry desert environment. Some of the water that does not evaporate sinks into the ground to become ground water. The remaining water flows into streams and collects in short-lived lakes called playas on the valley floor and eventually evaporates. Any water that falls as rain or snow into this region does not escape out of it; not one of the streams that originate within this basin ever find an outlet to the ocean. The extent of internal drainage, the area in which surface water cannot reach the ocean, defines the geographic region called the Great Basin.

The Great Basin&#x27;s internal drainage results from blockage of water movement by high fault-created mountains and by lack of sufficient water flow to merge with larger drainages outside of the Great Basin. This internally-drained area occupies approximately , including most of Nevada, a large part of Utah, and portions of Idaho, California, and Oregon. Much of the present-day Great Basin would drain to the sea, just as it did in the recent Ice Ages, if there were more rain and snowfall.

==Colorado Plateau==
The Colorado Plateau is roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. The province covers an area of 337,000 km2 (130,000 mi2) within western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, southern and eastern Utah, and northern Arizona. About 90% of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries: the Green, San Juan, and Little Colorado.

The sculptured beauty and brilliant colors of the Colorado Plateau&#x27;s sedimentary rock layers have captured the imaginations of countless geologists. This is a vast region of plateaus, mesas, and deep canyons whose walls expose rocks ranging in age from billions to just a few hundred years old.

Ancient Precambrian rocks, exposed only in the deepest canyons, make up the basement of the Colorado Plateau. Most are metamorphic rocks formed deep within the Earth while continental collision on a grand scale produced the nucleus of the North American continent well over a billion years ago. Igneous rocks injected millions of years later form a marbled network through parts of the Colorado Plateau&#x27;s darker metamorphic basement.
These deeply-formed rocks were uplifted, eroded, and exposed for eons. By 600 million years ago, North America had been beveled off to a remarkably smooth surface. It is on this crystalline rock surface that the younger, more familiar layered rocks of the Colorado Plateau were deposited.

Throughout the Paleozoic Era, the Colorado Plateau region was periodically inundated by tropical seas. Thick layers of limestone, sandstone, siltstone, and shale were laid down in the shallow marine waters. During times when the seas retreated, stream deposits and dune sands were deposited or older layers were removed by erosion. Over 300 million years passed as layer upon layer of sediment accumulated.
It was not until the upheavals that coincided with the formation of the supercontinent Pangea began about 250 million years ago that deposits of marine sediment waned and terrestrial deposits dominate. The Mesozoic Era sedimentary deposits are striking. Great accumulations of dune sand hardened to form sweeping arcs in cross-bedded sandstone. Eruptions from volcanic mountain ranges to the west buried vast regions beneath ashy debris. Short-lived rivers, lakes, and inland seas left sedimentary records of their passage.

One of the most geologically intriguing features of the Colorado Plateau is its remarkable stability. Relatively little rock deformation (e.g., faulting and folding) has affected this high, thick crustal block within the last 600 million years or so. In contrast, the plateau is surrounded by provinces that have suffered severe deformation. Mountain building thrust up the Rocky Mountains to the north and east and tremendous, earth-stretching tension created the Basin and Range Province to the west and south.

Although the Basin and Range and Colorado Plateau may seem to have little in common, their geological stories are intimately intertwined. In the early part of this Era (Paleogene Period), both regions had low elevations of probably less than 1 kilometer. Geologists are still gathering evidence and debating what came next.
Beginning about 20 million years ago, during the Miocene Epoch, both the Basin and Range and Colorado Plateau regions were uplifted as much as 3 kilometers. Great tension developed in the crust, probably related to changing plate motions far to the west. As the crust stretched, the Basin and Range Province broke up into a multitude of down-dropped valleys and elongate mountains. Yet for some reason not fully understood, the neighboring Colorado Plateau was able to preserve its structural integrity and remained a single tectonic block. Eventually, the great block of Colorado Plateau crust rose a kilometer higher than the Basin and Range.

As the land rose, the streams responded by cutting ever deeper stream channels. The most well-known of these streams, the Colorado River, began to carve the Grand Canyon less than 6 million years ago. The forces of erosion have exposed the vivid kaleidoscope of rock layers that make the Colorado Plateau a mecca for rock lovers.

==Rocky Mountain System==

The Rockies form a majestic mountain barrier that stretches from Canada through central New Mexico. Although formidable, a look at the topography reveals a discontinuous series of mountain ranges with distinct geological origins.

The rocks making up the mountains were formed before the mountains were raised. The cores of the mountain ranges are in most places formed of pieces of continental crust that are over one billion years old. In the south, an older mountain range was formed 300 million years ago, then eroded away. The rocks of that older range were reformed into the Rocky Mountains.

The Rocky Mountains took shape during a period of intense plate tectonic activity that formed much of the rugged landscape of the western United States. Three major mountain-building episodes reshaped the west from about 170 to 40 million years ago (Jurassic to Cenozoic Periods). The last mountain building event, the Laramide orogeny, (about 70-40 million years ago) the last of the three episodes, is responsible for raising the Rocky Mountains.

During the last half of the Mesozoic Era, the Age of the Dinosaurs, much of today&#x27;s California, Oregon, and Washington were added to North America. Western North America suffered the effects of repeated collision as slabs of ocean crust sank beneath the continental edge. Slivers of continental crust, carried along by subducting ocean plates, were swept into the subduction zone and scraped onto North America&#x27;s edge.

About 200–300 miles inland, magma generated above the subducting slab rose into the North American continental crust. Great arc-shaped volcanic mountain ranges grew as lava and ash spewed out of dozens of individual volcanoes. Beneath the surface, great masses of molten rock were injected and hardened in place.

For 100 million years the effects of plate collisions were focused very near the edge of the North American plate boundary, far to the west of the Rocky Mountain region. It was not until 70 million years ago that these effects began to reach the Rockies.

The growth of the Rocky Mountains has been one of the most perplexing of geologic puzzles. Normally, mountain building is focused between 200 and 400 miles inland from a subduction zone boundary, yet the Rockies are hundreds of miles farther inland. Although geologists continue to gather evidence to explain the rise of the Rockies, the answer most likely lies with an unusual subducting slab.

At a &#x27;typical&#x27; subduction zone, an oceanic plate typically sinks at a fairly high angle (see above). A volcanic arc grows above the subducting plate. During the growth of the Rocky Mountains, the angle of the subducting plate may have been significantly flattened, moving the focus of melting and mountain building much farther inland than is normally expected.

It is postulated that the shallow angle of the subducting plate greatly increased the friction and other interactions with the thick continental mass above it. Tremendous thrusts piled sheets of crust on top of each other, building the extraordinarily broad, high Rocky Mountain range.

As of 60 million years ago, the Rockies were like Tibet: a high plateau, probably above sea level. Since then, erosion stripped away the high rocks, revealing the ancestral rocks beneath, and forming the current landscape of the Rockies. Periods of glaciation occurred from the Pleistocene Epoch (1.8 million–70,000 years ago) to the Holocene Epoch (fewer than 11,000 years ago). The ice ages left their mark on the Rockies, forming extensive glacial landforms, such as U-shaped valleys and cirques.

==Laurentian Upland==

Every continent has a core of very ancient metamorphic rocks. The Superior Upland Province is the southern extension of the Laurentian Upland Province, part of the nucleus of North America called the Canadian Shield. The basement rocks of the Laurentian Upland Province were metamorphosed about 2500 million years ago in a mountain-building collision of tectonic plates called the Kenoran Orogeny.

The rocks of the Superior Upland are mostly Precambrian metamorphic rocks and overlying Paleozoic rocks (Cambrian) covered by a thin veneer of glacial deposits left behind when glaciers melted at the end of the Pleistocene Ice Age. If we could strip away all of the younger rocks deposited on top of buried Precambrian basement, you would see a landscape of low relief. The topography of the Precambrian rocks is very subdued, with barely 500 feet difference between the highest point and the lowest. Clearly, this region was exposed to a very long period of erosion in the very distant past which beveled the original mountainous surface to a gently undulating surface. The present surface is not much different. Hills rise just a few hundred feet above the surrounding countryside. The highest of these, such as Rib Hill, Wisconsin, are made up mostly of resistant quartzite or granite.
The structure of Superior Upland rock is quite complex. Folds and faults, most dating back to Precambrian time, record several episodes of mountain-building. The plate collisions that formed the core of our continent left behind a striking structural trend. Ridges and valleys are strongly aligned along this northeast–southwest trend. Lake Superior is an example of this northeast–southwest structural trend. Ridges of erosion-resistant rock rise above valleys and carved into weaker rock units.

The effects of repeated glaciation have left their mark on the Superior Upland. The present glacial topography is the product of the most recent glaciation that ended just 10,000 years ago. During the Late Wisconsin, the last glaciation of the Pleistocene Epoch, a massive continental ice sheet grew first in the north, then gradually expanded southward. Several thick finger-like lobes of glacial ice engulfed the region as they moved through the Superior basin. Rocks of all sizes were plucked and scoured from farther north and carried along by the icy mass. When the continental ice sheets melt, they left behind an assortment of rock called glacial drift that covers much of the Superior Upland landscape.

==Interior Plains==
The Interior Plains is a vast region that spreads across the stable core of North America. This area had formed when several small continents collided and welded together well over a billion years ago, during the Precambrian. Precambrian metamorphic and igneous rocks now form the basement of the Interior Plains and make up the stable nucleus of North America. With the exception of the Black Hills of South Dakota, the entire region has low relief, reflecting more than 500 million years of relative tectonic stability.

Throughout the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras the mostly low-lying Interior Plains region remained relatively unaffected by the mountain-building tectonic collisions suffered by the western and eastern margins of the continent.
During much of the Mesozoic Era, the North American continental interior was mostly well above sea level, with two notable exceptions. During part of the Jurassic (208-144 million years ago), rising seas flooded the low-lying areas of the continent. Much of the Interior Plains eventually lay submerged beneath the shallow Sundance Sea.

Sediments eroding from the rising Rocky Mountains to the west washed into the sea and deposited as layered wedges of fine debris. As sand, mud, and clays accumulated, the Sundance Sea retreated northward. Preserved within the multi-hued sandstones, mudstones, and clays that made up the shoreline, are the remains of countless dinosaurs that roamed the Sundance coast.

The fossil assemblages concealed within the sedimentary layers of the Morrison Formation are among the world&#x27;s richest. In some areas, bones of many dinosaurs are concentrated in a very small area, indicating that they were carried during floods, then deposited together beside a stream.

Once again, during the Cretaceous Period (144-65 million years ago), record high sea levels flooded the continental interior with shallow seas.

The Interior Plains continued to receive deposits from the eroding Rocky Mountains to the west and Appalachian and Ozark/Ouachita Mountains to the east and south throughout the most recent Era, the Cenozoic. The flatness of the Interior Plains is a reflection of the platform of mostly flat-lying marine and stream deposits laid down in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras.

==Appalachians, Interior Highlands, and Atlantic Plains==


The rocks of the Appalachian, Ouachita, Ozark Mountains are old and share a common origin. They largely consist of sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age that were deposited on the sea floor and are presently folded and faulted. The Appalachians also have volcanic rocks and slivers of ancient sea floor. These mountains were once part of a mighty uplifted mountain range that stretch from the Appalachian Highlands through Texas.

During the earliest Paleozoic Era, the continent that would later become North America straddled the equator. The Appalachian region was a passive plate margin, not unlike today&#x27;s Atlantic Coastal Plain Province. During this interval, the region was periodically submerged beneath shallows seas. Thick layers of sediment and carbonate rock was deposited on the shallow sea bottom when the region was submerged. When seas receded, terrestrial sedimentary deposits and erosion dominated.

During the middle Ordovician Period (about 440–480 million years ago), a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain building event (Taconic orogeny) in North America. The once quiet, Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate, the Iapetus, collided with and began sinking beneath the North American craton. With the birth of this new subduction zone, the early Appalachians were born.

Along the continental margin, volcanoes grew, coincident with the initiation of subduction. Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin. As mountains rose, erosion began to wear them down. Streams carried rock debris downslope to be deposited in nearby lowlands.
This was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians. Mountain building continued periodically throughout the next 250 million years (Caledonian, Acadian, Ouachita, Hercynian, and Alleghenian orogenies). The Pangean supercontinent began to take shape. Microplates, smaller bits of crust too small to be called continents, were swept in, one by one, to be welded to the growing mass.

By about 300 million years ago (Pennsylvanian Period) Africa was approaching North American craton. The collisional belt spread into the Ozark-Ouachita region and through the Marathon Mountains of Texas. Continent vs. continent collision raised the Appalachian-Ouachita chain to lofty, Himalayan-scale ranges. The massive bulk of Pangea was completed near the end of the Paleozoic Era (Permian Period) when Africa (Gondwana) plowed into the continental agglomeration, with the Appalachian-Ouachita mountains near the core. From about 280-230 million years ago, (Late Paleozoic Era until the Late Triassic) the continent we now know as North America was continuous with Africa, South America, and Europe.

During the Late Triassic, Pangea began to be torn apart when a three-pronged fissure grew between Africa, South America, and North America. Rifting began as magma welled up through the weakness in the crust, creating a volcanic rift zone. Volcanic eruptions spewed ash and volcanic debris across the landscape as these severed continent-sized fragments of Pangea diverged. The gash between the spreading continents gradually grew to form a new ocean basin, the Atlantic. The rift zone known as the mid-Atlantic ridge continued to provide the raw volcanic materials for the expanding ocean basin.

North America was slowly pulled westward away from the rift zone. The thick continental crust that made up the new east coast collapsed into a series of down-dropped fault blocks that roughly parallel today&#x27;s coastline. At first, the hot, faulted edge of the continent was high and buoyant relative to the new ocean basin. As the edge of North America moved away from the hot rift zone, it began to cool and subside beneath the new Atlantic Ocean. This once-active divergent plate boundary became the passive, trailing edge of westward moving North America. In plate tectonic terms, the Atlantic Plain is known as a classic example of a passive continental margin.

During the rifting, South America tore away from North America and headed southward. The ocean flooded into the opening between the two continents, forming the Gulf of Mexico. A record of this rifting event remains as an indelible mark on the landscape called Mississippi Embayment. It is this embayment that ripped the dramatic gap between the southern Appalachians and the Ouachita-Ozark Highlands.

Weathering and erosion prevailed, and the mountains began to wear away. By the end of the Mesozoic Era, the Appalachian-Ouachita Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain. Sediments eroded from these highlands were carried east and southward by streams and gradually covered the faulted continental margin, burying it under a wedge, thousands of feet thick, of layered sedimentary and volcanic debris. Today most Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rock layers that lie beneath much of the coastal plain and fringing continental shelf remain nearly horizontal or tilt gently toward the sea.

During the Cenozoic, the geology of the different regions diverged. The Appalachians started to uplift, while the Ouachita and Ozarks did not. The uplift rejuvenated the streams, which rapidly responded by cutting downward into the ancient bedrock. Some streams flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many millions of years earlier. Other streams downcut so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core, carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures.

==Alaska==

Most of Alaska consists of terranes accreted by collisions with island arcs carried in over the last 160 million years. These terranes were caused by the subduction of the Farallon, Kula, and Pacific plates sequentially. Currently, the Pacific plate is subducting beneath Alaska, producing the Aleutian Arc series of volcanoes through the Alaskan Peninsula and Aleutian Islands.

One of the sutures left by terrane addition is the Denali Fault, which curves through south-central Alaska. The Denali Fault bends just north of Denali. The combination of the subduction of the Pacific plate and the bend in the Denali Fault causes Denali to be the highest mountain in North America.

==Hawaii==

The State of Hawaii consists of a chain of islands, or archipelago. The archipelago developed as the Pacific plate moved slowly northwestward over a hotspot in the Earth&#x27;s mantle at a rate of approximately per million years. Thus, the southeast island (Hawaii) is volcanically active whereas the islands on the northwest end of the archipelago are older and typically smaller, due to longer exposure to erosion. The age of the archipelago has been estimated using potassium-argon dating methods. From this study and others, it is estimated that the northwesternmost island, the Kure Atoll, is the oldest at approximately 28 million years (Ma); while Hawaii, is approximately 0.4 Ma (400,000 years). The only active volcanism in the last 200 years has been on Hawaii and on the submerged but growing volcano to the extreme southeast, Kamaʻehuakanaloa (formerly Loihi).

Almost all of the magma of the hotspot has the composition of basalt, and so the Hawaiian volcanoes are composed almost entirely of this igneous rock. There is very little coarser-grained gabbro and diabase. Nephelinite is exposed on the islands but is extremely rare. The majority of eruptions in Hawaii are Hawaiian-type eruptions because basaltic magma is relatively fluid compared with magmas typically involved in more explosive eruptions, such as the andesitic magmas that produce some of the spectacular and dangerous eruptions around the margins of the Pacific basin.

<text>Avalon Beach is a northern beachside suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is 28 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council, in the Northern Beaches region. The area was previously called Avalon, with the name Avalon Beach being assigned during a change in boundaries and names in the Pittwater region in 2012.

== History ==
The Pittwater and Northern Beaches area was formerly inhabited by the Garigal or Caregal people in a region known as Guringai country.

=== European settlement ===
Avalon was named after the mythical Avalon, a legendary island in Celtic languages mythology. According to legends, Avalon was an earthly paradise and the final resting place of King Arthur.

The first land grant in the area was to John Farrell in 1827. In 1833 a land grant was made to Australia&#x27;s first Catholic priest, John Joseph Therry, by Governor Bourke. A further grant of 280 acres made in 1837 meant that Therry&#x27;s holdings covered most of the peninsula from Newport to Whale Beach. He built a church in this area but his plans for a settlement never eventuated. Therry fought hard for the recognition of the Catholic Church in the colony. After he died, the land was left to the Jesuit order and was then sold to help finance the rebuilding of St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Sydney. In the 1920s, the area was still known as &#x27;Priest&#x27;s Flat&#x27;. Arthur J Small handled a subdivision in 1921 and chose the name Avalon. Lots were sold for £100 each and included two year&#x27;s free membership in the local golf club.

Significant housing developments took place during the 1920s. The architect Alexander Stewart Jolly designed a number of houses that were built in the Avalon area in that period. &quot;Loggan Rock&quot; was a flamboyant log cabin combined with a stone tower; the combination of logs and rocks gave rise to the name. The house is heritage-listed. &quot;Careel House&quot; is a bungalow made of stone that was quarried in the area. Nowadays it is on the Whale Beach side of the boundary. It is also heritage-listed. &quot;Hy Brasil&quot;, located near Clareville, was built in 1936, but was originally known as &quot;The Gem&quot;. Later it was bought by Ted Herman, son of the painter Sali Herman, who changed the name, using the name of a mythical island west of Ireland. It is heritage-listed. A sandstone cottage known as &quot;Wickham&quot;, designed by Walter Burley Griffin, was demolished with council approval in 1994.

Another significant development was the creation of Ruskin Rowe in 1950. This street was designed as an estate by the architect Harry Ruskin Rowe, son of the architect Thomas Rowe. Rowe created covenants to preserve the character of the estate, but they have been ignored to an extent over the years. Nevertheless, the estate is heritage-listed because of its historic significance, as well as its scientific significance in preserving the bushland environment of the area.

=== Early subdivision plans ===
==Heritage listings==
Avalon Beach has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 32 Plateau Road: Walter Burley Griffin Lodge
* 111 Whale Beach Road: Loggan Rock

==Demographics==
According to the of population, there were 10,379 residents in Avalon Beach. 74.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 9.5%, New Zealand 1.9% and United States of America 1.4%. 91.0% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religious affiliation were No Religion 53.5%, Catholic 16.7% and Anglican 15.2%.

== Commercial areas ==
Avalon Beach features an RSL club, a surf club, bowling and sailing clubs; a golf club, a supermarket, shops, offices, cafes and a cinema. Cuisines include French, Vietnamese, Italian, Mexican, American Diner, Japanese, Thai and other Asian. There is a book shop, hairdresser, artisan bakery, petrol station, Red Cross Shop, bottle shop, many real estate agents, hardware store, florists and many homewares and dress shops. It is unique in that this large commercial centre is separated from the beach only by the road, a fact which until recently was used to argue against commercialisation of the beach side buildings themselves as restaurants and cafes were already so close to the beach.

== Sport and recreation ==
Avalon Beach is a surfing beach and has a 25-metre salt water rock pool at the south end. It is renowned for its rich orange-coloured sand (that indicate the presence of iron oxide), which contrasts to the typical yellow coloured beaches in the eastern suburbs. Avalon Beach SLSC members patrol Avalon Beach. Several former surfing world champions are also past or current Avalon residents, including Ben Player.

Avalon Soccer Club, established 1982, has over 80 teams and 1000 registered players. Avalon Junior Rugby League Club has contributed several players active in the Australian National Rugby League. Avalon also has a small nine-hole golf course.

The former Pittwater Council created the Bangalley Headland Bicentennical Walk, which goes through part of the Careel Headland Reserve. The track starts at Whale Beach Road and goes to Marine Parade. The council also proposed a Plan of Management for the Bicentennial Walk in 2001, and adopted it in 2002. St Michaels Cave is an interesting coastal feature.

== Schools ==
* Barrenjoey High School
* Avalon Public School
* Maria Regina Catholic Primary School
* Montessori public school on the former grounds of Barrenjoey Highschool

== Culture/politics ==
An episode of the American television show &quot;Baywatch&quot; was shot at Avalon Beach in the late 1990s. Producers of the show, seeking to relocate from their Californian base due to cost constraints, proposed a full relocation to Avalon and promised an upgrading of the SLSC in return, painting a huge sign saying &quot;Avalon Beach&quot; across the surf club. However, following complaints from residents (supported by former world surfing champion and local property owner Mark Warren), the series moved instead to Hawaii. The anti-&quot;Baywatch&quot; supporters were led by former Pittwater mayor Alex McTaggart, who was subsequently elected to NSW State Parliament for two years.

In 2011–13 there was a move by the Avalon Beach Surf Life Saving club officials, led by Christine Hopton, to replace the existing surf club. The development went ahead despite opposition from local residents in the land and environment court.

Australian drama series &quot;Blue Water High&quot; was set at Avalon Beach, and the series was filmed there.

<doc id="593920" wikidata="Q7005121" url="?curid=593920" title="NewLabour Party">
<text>The NewLabour Party was a centre-left political party in New Zealand that existed from 1989 to 2000. It was founded by Jim Anderton, a member of parliament (MP) and former president of the New Zealand Labour Party, on 1 May 1989.

NewLabour was established by a number of Labour Party members who left the party in reaction to Rogernomics, the economic policies implemented by the Labour Party&#x27;s Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas, which saw the traditionally left-leaning Labour Party swing heavily to the new right on issues of state intervention, regulation, and taxation. Anderton, who had been among the most vocal critics of Douglas, was joined by a number of other members of the Labour Party, such as Matt Robson, Laila Harré and Phil Amos, and a number of left-wing activists, such as Bruce Jesson. Anderton was the party&#x27;s only MP before it joined the Alliance.

==Electoral success==
In the 1990 elections, NewLabour stood candidates in all electorates. The party gained a certain amount of support from disillusioned Labour voters, winning 5.16% of the vote. Anderton was NewLabour&#x27;s only successful candidate, retaining the Sydenham seat in working-class south-central Christchurch. He remained the party&#x27;s sole representative in Parliament, which was now dominated by the National Party with 67 seats out of 97.

==Alliance building==
In 1991, NewLabour and several other parties formed the Alliance, a broad left-wing coalition. Initially, NewLabour maintained a separate identity within the Alliance, keeping its own party organization intact. By 2000, however, many felt that maintaining parallel NewLabour and Alliance structures was counter-productive, and at NewLabour&#x27;s October conference, it was decided to completely assimilate the party into the larger Alliance structure, marking the end of NewLabour as an autonomous group.

== Former parliamentarians ==

MPs elected between 1991 and 2000 were members of the NewLabour Party&#x27;s faction of the Alliance.

<text>The Pillow Book is a 1996 erotic drama film written and directed by Peter Greenaway, which stars Vivian Wu as Nagiko, a Japanese model in search of pleasure and new cultural experience from various lovers. The film is a melding of dark modern drama with idealised Chinese and Japanese cultural themes and settings, and centres on body painting.

==Plot==
The film&#x27;s title, &quot;The Pillow Book&quot;, refers to an ancient Japanese diary written by Sei Shōnagon, whose actual name is believed to have been Kiyohara Nagiko, from whence the protagonist&#x27;s name in the film.

The film is narrated by Nagiko, a Japanese-born model living in Hong Kong. Nagiko seeks a lover who can match her desire for carnal pleasure with her admiration for poetry and calligraphy. The roots of this obsession lie in her youth in Kyoto, when her father would write characters of good fortune on her face. Nagiko&#x27;s father celebrates her birthday retelling the Japanese creation myth and writing on her flesh in beautiful calligraphy, while her aunt reads a list of &quot;beautiful things&quot; from Sei Shōnagon&#x27;s &quot;Pillow Book&quot;. Nagiko&#x27;s aunt tells her that when she is twenty-eight years old, the official book of observations will be officially 1000 years old, and that she, Nagiko, will be the same age as Sei Shōnagon when she had written the book (in addition to sharing her first name). Nagiko also learns around this time that her father is in thrall to his publisher, &quot;Yaji-san&quot;, who demands sexual favours from her father in exchange for publishing his work.

===Early chapters===
The publisher arranges Nagiko&#x27;s wedding to his young apprentice. Her husband, an expert archer, resents Nagiko&#x27;s love for books and her desire to read, in spite of his apprenticeship. He also refuses to indulge in her desires for pleasure, refusing to write on her body. When he discovers and reads Nagiko&#x27;s pillow book, he is extremely resentful, setting it on fire and thus setting fire to their marital home, an event which Nagiko describes to be the &#x27;first major fire of [her] life.&#x27; Insulted and enraged, Nagiko leaves him for good.

Hiding from her husband, Nagiko moves to Hong Kong. In spite of her aversion to the practice, she learns how to type to find work. Outside her apartment, a group of activists regularly protest the publishing industry for the depletion of forests due to the need to make paper.

After working as a secretary in the office of a Japanese fashion designer for a while, Nagiko&#x27;s employer takes a liking to her and makes her one of his models. As a successful fashion model, Nagiko hires a maid, as she now finally has the opportunity to explore her sexual desires of being written on. However, after several affairs, she feels dissatisfied with them all: either they have great penmanship and are lousy lovers, or vice versa.

One day, at the Cafe Typo, Nagiko&#x27;s favourite haunt, she meets Jerome, a British translator. Intrigued by his knowledge, they go to a private space where she has Jerome write on her body in various languages. In spite of her interest, Nagiko dislikes Jerome&#x27;s handwriting and orders him out. Jerome totally shocks Nagiko, however, when he asks her to teach him, offering her to write on &quot;his&quot; body. Opening his shirt, he offers Nagiko to &quot;Use my body like the pages of a book. Of &quot;your&quot; book!&quot;. Nagiko has never considered this aspect in her desires before: her lovers always write on &quot;her&quot; body. When she backs out and runs, Jerome laughs at her.

Frightened but very intrigued by Jerome&#x27;s suggestion, Nagiko has several one-night stands in which she experiments writing on their bodies. One of the activists, admirer Hoki, a Japanese photographer who adores her, begs Nagiko to take him as a lover. She explains she can&#x27;t, as his skin&#x27;s no good for writing: whenever she writes on him, the ink smears and runs. Hoki, not wanting Nagiko to keep carrying on like she is, suggests she try writing a book, offering to take it to a renowned publisher he freelances for. Nagiko likes this idea and writes her first book.

Nagiko&#x27;s book is returned, being told the book is &quot;not worth the paper it&#x27;s written on!&quot;. Insulted, Nagiko follows the address on the envelope to confront the publisher. Nagiko is shocked to discover that the publisher who rejected her work is in fact Yaji-san, her father&#x27;s old publisher. What&#x27;s more, the publisher has a young lover: Jerome.

Devising a plan, Nagiko decides that she will get to the publisher through Jerome. Meeting up with Jerome again, Nagiko discovers he has learned a few more languages, and his penmanship has greatly improved. Nagiko and Jerome spend several weeks exploring this, writing on each other and making love. Nagiko soon realises that, in Jerome, she has found the perfect lover she has been searching for: the partner with whom she can share her physical and her poetic passion, using each other&#x27;s bodies as tablets for their art.

===Writing of books 1 – 6===
Nagiko tells Jerome the truth and the whole story with the publisher. Jerome comes up with an idea: Nagiko will write her book on Jerome&#x27;s body and Jerome will take it to the publisher. Nagiko loves the idea and writes Book 1: The Book of The Agenda, in intricate characters of black, red, and gold, on Jerome, keeping her identity anonymous. The plan is a success: Jerome sees the publisher and exhibits the book on his nude body, and the impressed publisher has his scriveners copy down the text.

After telling Nagiko of the plan&#x27;s success, Jerome tells Nagiko that he&#x27;ll return to her as soon as the publisher, who was extremely aroused by the experience, lets him go. However, during his time with the publisher, Jerome appears to lose track of time and doesn&#x27;t return to Nagiko. Nagiko, jealous, impatient, and angry, searches for Jerome, eventually finding him making love with the publisher. Nagiko takes this as rejection and betrayal of the worst kind, and immediately plots revenge.

On two Swedish tourists, Nagiko writes Book 2: The Book of The Innocent and Book 3: The Book of the Idiot. Shortly afterwards, an old man is running naked through the streets from the publisher&#x27;s shop, bearing Book 4: The Book of Impotence/Old Age. Book 5: The Book of the Exhibitionist is delivered by a boorish, fat, hyperactive American (Tom Kane; who was actually more interested in Hoki than Nagiko).

Nagiko&#x27;s revenge is a success. Jerome is furiously jealous and comes to Nagiko&#x27;s home to confront her. Nagiko refuses to meet him, however, and won&#x27;t let Jerome in. Jerome&#x27;s outrage soon turns to desperation as he begs her to talk to him, but she won&#x27;t.

Jerome sinks into deep depression and meets with Hoki at the Cafe Typo, desperate to find a way to get Nagiko to forgive him. Hoki suggests that he &quot;scare&quot; Nagiko by faking suicide, similar to the fake death scene in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and gives Jerome some pills.

Arriving at Nagiko&#x27;s home while she is away, Jerome takes some of the pills, then writes a page, as if writing a book. Each time he takes some pills, he writes another page, keeping track of how many pills he takes on each page. As the pills take effect, Jerome can write no more and lies on the bed, naked, holding a copy of Sei Shōnagon&#x27;s the book of observations.

The plan is a success: when Nagiko returns home and finds Jerome, she rushes to him, eager to renew their relationship and continue their plans. However, the plan has worked too well: Jerome has overdosed on the pills and is dead. Nagiko is devastated and realises how much she loved him. On his dead body, Nagiko writes Book 6: The Book of the Lovers.

At Jerome&#x27;s funeral, his mother, a snobbish, upper-class woman, tells Nagiko that Jerome always loved things that were &quot;fashionable&quot;. When she suggests that was probably why Jerome loved Nagiko, Nagiko strikes her.

Nagiko burns her possessions and moves back to Japan. After the funeral, the publisher secretly exhumes Jerome&#x27;s body from the tomb and has Jerome&#x27;s skin, still bearing the writing, flayed and made into a grotesque pillow book of his own. Nagiko learns of the publisher&#x27;s actions and becomes distraught and outraged. She sends a letter to the publisher, still keeping her identity a secret, demanding that particular book from the publisher&#x27;s hands in exchange for the remaining books. The publisher, now obsessed with his mysterious writer and her work, agrees.

===Writing of books 7 – 13===
Nagiko, now pregnant with her and Jerome&#x27;s child, writes Book 7: The Book of The Seducer on a male messenger. The writing on him is almost destroyed and undecipherable when the publisher accidentally leaves the messenger out in the rain. Book 8: The Book of Youth is delivered as a series of photographs. A young Buddhist monk then arrives bearing Book 9: The Book of Secrets written on all his &quot;secret&quot; spots: in between his fingers and toes, the insides of his thighs, etc.; the book is presented in the form of riddles. When the next messenger arrives, he is completely bare: no writing at all. The publisher and staff search for any hint of writing on the messenger&#x27;s naked body. As the publisher dismisses him as a hoax, the man sticks out his tongue, bearing Book 10: The Book of Silence.

The activists&#x27; protests come to an end when their truck hits a young wrestler bearing Book 11: The Book of The Betrayed, right outside the publisher&#x27;s office. The next messenger (Masaru Matsuda) simply drives by the office, giving little time to copy down Book 12: The Book of False Starts.

Finally, Book 13: The Book of the Dead arrives on the body of a Sumo wrestler. In the book writing on the body of the messenger, which the publisher carefully reads, Nagiko finally reveals her identity, confronting the publisher with his crimes: blackmailing and disgracing her father, &quot;corrupting&quot; her husband, as well as Jerome, and what he&#x27;s done to Jerome&#x27;s corpse. The publisher, greatly shamed and humbled by being confronted with his guilt, hands the pillow book made of Jerome&#x27;s skin to the messenger, then has the messenger slit his throat. 
Upon recovering the book made out of Jerome&#x27;s skin, Nagiko buries it under a Bonsai tree and life goes on. She has given birth to Jerome&#x27;s child and is shown in the epilogue writing on her child&#x27;s face, like her father used to do when she was young and quoting from her own pillow book. It is now Nagiko&#x27;s 28th birthday.

Nagiko&#x27;s bi-cultural heritage plays a key role in this film. As a half-Chinese and half-Japanese woman, Nagiko navigates her dual cultures through physical and psychological exploration. Greenaway portrays this exploration subtly by mixing and switching Asian iconography.

==Cast==
==Reception==
The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. Andrew Johnston stated: &quot;Most of Greenaway&#x27;s signature visual devices (elaborate title cards, superimposed images) are employed here; but accompanied by U2 songs and traditional Asian music, instead of a Michael Nyman score, they seem fresher and more dynamic than before. The actors are required to submit completely to Greenaway&#x27;s mechanics, but there isn&#x27;t one bad performance. McGregor and Oida (as a venal publisher) are especially fine.&quot;

Reviews were mixed to positive, as it currently holds a 67% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 54 reviews with the consensus: &quot;&quot;The Pillow Book&quot; is undeniably sensual and visually ravishing, but the film&#x27;s narrative lacks the hypnotic pull of its imagery.&quot;

The film opened on 12 screens in the UK (including 6 in London), grossing £70,458 in its opening weekend and finishing in 14th place but with the highest per-screen average of £5,872. In London, it was the second highest-grossing film for the weekend behind &quot;Michael Collins&quot; with a gross of £53,925. In the US, the film opened on 7 screens and grossed $105,922, for a large per-screen average of $15,132 and went on to gross $2.4 million.

<doc id="593924" wikidata="Q1627253" url="?curid=593924" title="Observation on the Spot">
<text>Observation on the Spot (Polish title &quot;Wizja lokalna&quot; is an expression meaning crime scene reconstruction) is a social science fiction novel by Stanisław Lem. The novel is a report of Ijon Tichy&#x27;s travel to a faraway planet Entia (in Polish text: Encja) to study their civilization. This report was supposed to fix a misunderstanding arisen from Tichy&#x27;s Fourteenth Voyage to supposedly Entia (then known as Enteropia), which turned out to be a satellite of Entia, masqueraded by Entians to misguide explorers. The travel was also to verify the results of the &quot;Institute of Historiographical Computers&quot; (Polish: Instytut Maszyn Dziejowych), which use predictive modeling to overcome the speed of light limitation and get information about the state of the affairs on remote planets based on information obtained from previous expeditions.

==Description==
The major themes of the book are: the problems of the society of abundance based entirely on automated production where individuals have little to do; imposition of ethical laws through technology i.e. the &quot;ethicsphere&quot; which has made it impossible to harm individuals physically; and the ideological opposition of two dominant systems, which is basically a parody of Western World-Soviet Union split taken to the absurd.

The original novel was first printed by Wydawnictwo Literackie in 1982. It was translated into German by Hubert Schumann under the title &quot;Lokaltermin&quot; in 1987 ().

Lacking English translation, the novel title was also translated in literary criticism works as &quot;Eyewitness Account&quot; and &quot;The Scene of the Crime&quot;.

&quot;Science Fiction Studies&quot; published a collection of excerpts from Lem&#x27;s letters which show the chronology of the creation of the novel (during 1979-1981). In the first one Lem confesses that he tried to approach the subject several times in the past few years. Also, in his essay &quot;The Philosophy of Chance&quot; Lem confesses that he struggled with the novel for many years.

At the end of the novel Lem included a &quot;Polish-Polish dictionary&quot; of the neologisms used in it (named &quot;the Earthish-Earthish Glossary&quot;). In a letter to publisher Franz Rottensteiner Lem wrote about his intention to add this glossary and to include into it an explanation why these neologisms are a necessity, not just a fantastic embellishment.

==Plot summary==
The novel consists of four chapters.

===Chapters 1-3===
Chapter 1 is the setup, which leads to Tichy&#x27;s visit to the Institute of Historiographical Computers described in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 is the description of Tichy&#x27;s flight to Entia.

===Chapter 4: Tichy on Entia===
Tichy arrives on Entia to discover a unique anthropomorphic civilization divided into two major states: Kurdlandia (from &quot;kurdl&quot;) and Luzania. These names require some explanations.

&quot;Kurdl&quot; is a huge animal inhabiting the marshes of Entia. The name of the animal is Lem&#x27;s invention, used in earlier tales about Ijon Tichy. (In Polish it is &quot;kurdel&quot;, however in declensions of the word the root converts into &quot;kurdl-&quot;, hence there are no associations with the English word &quot;curdle&quot;). Michael Kandel translated it as &quot;squamp&quot; in his translation of Tichy&#x27;s 14th voyage.

The name &quot;Luzania&quot; derives from the Polish root &quot;luz-&quot; with the meaning of &quot;loose&quot;, &quot;not restrained&quot;; the choice will become clear below.

Kurdlandia&#x27;s guiding ideology is &quot;national mobilism&quot;, that is the vast majority of the population must live inside of the stomachs, various passages and internal organs of the kurdls. Kurdls walk about the marshes, guided by drivers, and their inhabitants hence are &quot;able to explore the land of their wonderful country from inside of their home kurdl&quot;, in the words of a patriotic individual that Ijon Tichy spoke to. Inhabitants of the kurdls may get out periodically (at least for 24 hours a year). Exceptions are largely confined to high government officials who live outside the marshes, on dry ground, in normal houses. Kurdlandia has no technology to speak of and is proud of it.

The other state, Luzania, constitutes a treatment of the topic of an &quot;ideal state&quot;. Luzanian&#x27;s most prominent accomplishment is the creation of &quot;ethicsphere&quot; (compare &quot;atmosphere&quot;). They have produced huge numbers of molecular sized nanobots called &quot;bystry&quot; (&quot;quickies&quot; in English) that serve to control matter in the &#x27;quickated&#x27; areas. The primary function of the &#x27;quickies&#x27; is the enforcement of the laws of ethics as physical laws (hence the word &quot;ethicsphere&quot;). Hence, it is a physical law in Luzania that it is not possible to hurt an individual physically. If you try to strike your neighbor, your hand will be stopped by the suddenly increased air viscosity, (although you will not be hurt either). If you try to drown, the water will push you out. Doing non-physical harm, such as by pestering, criticizing, and otherwise mentally tormenting people is still possible, although in such a case the &#x27;quickies&#x27; would probably help the victim to walk away from the attackers. There is a large protest movement in Luzania of people who want to end the ethicsphere, and a major element of their activities is trying to inflict harm on anybody just to prove the possibility of doing so, but they have not succeeded yet.

The &#x27;quickies&#x27; also serve to produce material goods necessary to maintain a high standard of living. Hence, there is not much of an economic life going on, although there are limits for the amount of energy individuals may spend on satisfying their needs. Many Luzanians are involved in intellectual pursuits, such as being professors, students, and government officials, but the problem of nothing productive to do stands prominent. Apparently the &#x27;quickies&#x27; are capable of some collective thought, at least for the purposes of self-replication and self-improvement, as well as in order to identify instances of potential harm to individuals (no small feat, no doubt). The artists of Luzania feel particularly slighted by the fact that &#x27;quickies&#x27; can create art of all forms of much greater quality than they can; naturally, many of them are members of the protest movement.

There exists ideological opposition between Kurdlandia and Luzania. Generally speaking, many of the people holed up in the kurdls on poor rations would have been more than happy to run away and live in plenty across the border. On the other hand, many Luzanians, especially university students and faculty, dislike the consumerism and ethical limitations of freedom under the &#x27;quickies&#x27; and call variously for the imposition of the kurdl-ism or at least for a slight rollback of the technological development and the abolition of the &#x27;quickies&#x27;, depending on the degree of radicalism of the individual. Luzanians also enjoy traveling to Kurdlandia on vacation to get out of the &#x27;quickies&#x27; areas.

The main character spends most of his time in Luzania, studying the history of the world and the current Luzanian social system. We learn about it through his words.

<text>Pittwater Council was a local government area on the Northern Beaches of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It covered a region adjacent to the Tasman Sea about north of the Sydney central business district. The area is named after Pittwater, the body of water adjacent to much of the area governed. First proclaimed in 1906 as the A Riding of Warringah Shire, the area was proclaimed as the Municipality of Pittwater on 1 May 1992. On 12 May 2016, the Minister for Local Government announced that Pittwater Council would be subsumed into the newly formed Northern Beaches Council. The last mayor of Pittwater Council was Councillor Jacqui Townsend, an independent politician.


==Suburbs and localities==
Suburbs and localities serviced by Pittwater Council were:
==History==
The Pittwater Shire was named after an estuary of Broken Bay which the shire surrounds. Broken Bay forms the mouth of the Hawkesbury River, the main river which formed the Cumberland Plain and Sydney basin. Pittwater was discovered in 1788, the year the first British colony was established in Australia. However, Pittwater and the surrounding region was inhabited for many millennia by local Aboriginal tribes and much evidence of their habitation remains especially their rock etchings in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park which borders Pittwater&#x27;s western side. Pittwater was named in about 1800 by the colony&#x27;s first governor, Arthur Phillip, honouring the then British Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger.

Pittwater in the early 19th century was developed as a new port with loading and unloading facilities erected at what is now the current Newport public wharf. As the port developed so did local industry such as sheep at Mona Vale, orchards at southern Newport and Church Point, salt from Saltpan cove and Scotland Island. During the period from the 1950s to the early 1970s, sand mining operations were undertaken in the upper reaches of McCarr&#x27;s Creek. After sand mining operations ceased, the tailings ponds were all that remained of the mining operation. Around the 1850s a school was established on the site of what is now Newport Public school. Over later periods, public (primary) schools were established at Mona Vale, Avalon and Bilgola Plateau. In 1963, Pittwater High School was opened at Mona Vale (located on Pittwater Road), Barrenjoey High School (located at the northern end of Avalon beach) was opened in 1968. During the Second World War, unlike Sydney Harbour (Port Jackson), Pittwater was not protected by a boom net. As a consequence local militia and later Australian Army were stationed at the western side of the entrance to Pittwater and were dispersed along the western shore in a network of trenches, pillboxes and gun emplacements.

Pittwater was first incorporated in 1906 when it was included as the &quot;A Riding&quot; of Warringah Shire Council. However for many years there existed a sentiment held by some in A Riding, the northern Riding and the largest in Warringah, taking up more than 40% of Warringah&#x27;s land area, that they were being increasingly ignored and subject to what they considered inappropriate development and policies for their area. This culminated in 1991 when a non-compulsory postal poll of the residents of A Riding was taken over the question of a possible secession. This resulted in a 73.5% vote in favour of secession, however only 48.18% of residents took part in this vote. This vote was, however, 600 short of the total majority required.

The Minister for Local Government at the time, Gerry Peacocke, nevertheless announced the secession of A Riding from Warringah Council, considering that those who did not vote did not have any particular inclination to how they were governed, and thus Pittwater Council was created. On 1 May 1992, The governor of New South Wales, Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair, proclaimed the establishment of the Municipality of Pittwater, the area of which roughly followed the area formerly known as &#x27;A&#x27; Riding of the Warringah Shire. Also on that day, the offices of Robert Dunn, Eric Green and Ronald Starr, former Warringah &#x27;A&#x27; Riding Councillors, were terminated with those persons forming, with others, a nine-member Provisional Council of the Municipality of Pittwater. Despite the Municipality status requiring the new council members to be titled &quot;Alderman&quot;, Pittwater obtain the permission of Minister Peacocke to continue the use of &quot;Councillor&quot; to refer to the members.

When the &quot;Local Government Act 1993&quot; came into effect from 1 July 1993, the title of the council changed from the &quot;Municipality of Pittwater&quot; to simply &quot;Pittwater Council&quot;.

===Amalgamation===
A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the Pittwater Council merge with adjoining councils. The government considered two proposals. The first proposed a merger of Pittwater Council and parts of Warringah Council to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 141,000. The alternative, proposed by Warringah Council on 23 February 2016, was for an amalgamation of the Pittwater, Manly and Warringah councils.

On 12 May 2016, the council was amalgamated with Manly and Warringah Councils to form the Northern Beaches Council.

== Council ==
===Mayors/Deputy Mayors===
===Final composition and election method===
Pittwater Council was composed of nine councillors elected proportionally as three separate wards, each electing three councillors. All councillors were elected for a fixed four-year term of office. The mayor and deputy mayor were elected annually by the councillors at the first meeting of the council. The last election was held on 8 September 2012, and the makeup of the council was as follows when it was dissolved:

===General managers===
==Demographics==
At the 2011 Census, there were people in the Pittwater local government area, of these 48.8% were male and 51.2% were female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 0.4% of the population. The median age of people in the Pittwater Council area was 42 years; notably above the national median of 37 years. Children aged 0 – 14 years made up 20.0% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 17.0% of the population. Of people in the area aged 15 years and over, 56.1% were married and 11.0% were either divorced or separated.

Population growth in the Pittwater Council area between the 2001 Census and the 2006 Census was 3.40% and in the subsequent five years to the 2011 Census, population growth was 5.54%. When compared with total population growth of Australia for the same periods, being 5.78% and 8.32% respectively, population growth in the Pittwater local government area was lower than the national average. The median weekly income for residents within the Pittwater Council area was higher than the national average.

At the 2011 Census, the proportion of residents in the Pittwater local government area who stated their ancestry as Australian or Anglo-Saxon exceeded 75% of all residents (national average was 65.2%). In excess of 57% of all residents in the Pittwater Council area nominated a religious affiliation with Christianity at the 2011 Census, which was slightly higher than the national average of 50.2%. Meanwhile, as at the Census date, compared to the national average, households in the Pittwater local government area had a significantly lower than average proportion (10.8%) where two or more languages are spoken (national average was 20.4%); and a significantly higher proportion (88.7%) where English only was spoken at home (national average was 76.8%).

==Council seal==
The seal of Pittwater Council was the result of a design competition held by the council that was won by retired Newport commercial artist Hugh Seelenmeyer. It was first used in the Manly Daily on 29 June 1991 and featured a mangrove tree surrounded by water, representing the close relationship of the area with water and bushland.

==Sister cities==
Pittwater Council&#x27;s suburb Mona Vale is sister city to the United States village of Wilmette, Illinois and they participate in an annual student exchange program between their high schools. Pittwater and Wilmette are both home to a Bahá&#x27;í House of Worship.

<doc id="593928" wikidata="Q925649" url="?curid=593928" title="Broken Bay">
<text>Broken Bay, a semi-mature tide-dominated drowned valley estuary, is a large inlet of the Tasman Sea located about north of Sydney on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia; being one of the bodies of water that separate greater Metropolitan Sydney from the Central Coast. Broken Bay is the first major bay north of Sydney Harbour in the state capital of Sydney.

Broken Bay has its origin at the confluence of the Hawkesbury River, Pittwater, and Brisbane Water and flows openly into the Tasman Sea.

The total surface area of the bay is approximately .

==Geography==
The entrance to Broken Bay lies between the northern Box Head and Barrenjoey Head to the south. Barrenjoey Lighthouse was constructed in 1881 to guide ships away from the prominent headland. The bay comprises three arms, being the prominent estuary of the Hawkesbury River in the west, Pittwater to the south, and Brisbane Water to the north. These three arms are flooded rivers (rias) formed at a time when the sea level was much lower than it is at the present day.

The Hawkesbury River flows from the confluence of the Grose and Nepean Rivers at the base of the Blue Mountains.

Pittwater extends south from Broken Bay and is the northernmost extent of the greater Sydney area. Pittwater&#x27;s calm waters make it a popular sailing area. West Head, west of Barrenjoey Head, marks the divide between Pittwater and the Hawkesbury.

Brisbane Water is the northern arm of Broken Bay and has the towns of Gosford and Woy Woy on its shores.

Lion Island, named for its profile&#x27;s resemblance to a Sphinx from some viewpoints, is located at the entrance of Broken Bay. Lion Island Nature Reserve covers the entire island, and is home to a colony of fairy penguins.


==European discovery==
James Cook recorded &quot;broken land&quot; seen north of Port Jackson just before sunset on 7 May 1770, and named it Broken Bay. However, there has been some controversy over whether what is now known as &#x27;Broken Bay&#x27; was what was sighted by Cook.

:Matthew Flinders, The colonists have called this place Broken Bay, but it is not what was so named by Captain Cook&quot;.

Ray Parkin in his book &quot;H. M. Bark Endeavour&quot; claims that the modern &#x27;Broken Bay&#x27; was passed unremarked at night, and that Cook was in fact referring to the area around Narrabeen Lagoon.
Matthew Flinders placed Cook&#x27;s &#x27;Broken Bay&#x27; at 33° 42&#x27; South, near to the mouth of Narrabeen Lagoon.

Whatever the case, Governor Phillip was the first non-Indigenous person to examine the present day Broken Bay in a longboat from the &quot;Sirius&quot; on 2 March 1788.

==Role in attack on Sydney Harbour==
On 28 November 2005, documentary film-maker Damien Lay claimed that the wreckage of &quot;M-24&quot;, a Japanese midget submarine involved in the attack on Sydney Harbour in 1942 and disappeared soon afterward, was buried under sand on the seabed, just east of Lion Island. Lay claimed to have confirmed that copper wiring found at the site was consistent with that used in similar Japanese vessels. A few weeks later, New South Wales Planning Minister Frank Sartor announced that sonar scans conducted by the New South Wales Heritage Office at the location specified had found no trace of the lost submarine.

&quot;M-24&quot; was eventually found approximately 13 kilometres south of Broken Bay, 5 kilometres off Bungan Head, proving the hypothesis that &quot;M-24&quot; chose to not draw attention to its mother submarines to the south of Sydney Harbour and instead moved north towards Broken Bay.

<text>Brisbane Water is a wave-dominated barrier estuary located in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia. Brisbane Water has its origin at the confluence of the Narara and Coorumbine Creeks, to the south–east of Gosford and travels for approximately in a southerly direction to its mouth at Broken Bay, about from the Tasman Sea, at Barrenjoey Head. A number of towns and suburbs surround the shores of Brisbane Water, including Blackwall, Booker Bay, Davistown, Empire Bay, Erina, Ettalong Beach, Gosford, Green Point, Hardys Bay, Kilcare, Kincumber, Koolewong, Phegans Bay, Point Frederick, Point Clare, Saratoga, Tascott, Wagstaffe, and Woy Woy. Contained within Brisbane Water is St Huberts Island, Rileys Island, Dunmar Island and Pelican Island; and adjoining the estuary is Brisbane Water National Park to the west and Bouddi National Park to the east. Forming part of the same tidal estuary system is a separate but connected basin, the Kincumber Broadwater, lying to the east of Davistown.

The total catchment area of the river is approximately .

The land adjacent to the Brisbane Water was occupied for many thousands of years by Australian Aboriginal peoples, the Darkinjung and Kuringgai, who used the estuary and foreshore areas for cultural purposes.

Brisbane Water was named in 1825 in honour of Sir Thomas Brisbane, a Governor of New South Wales, serving between 1820 and 1825.

== History ==
Brisbane Water is part of the traditional lands of the Darkinjung and Kuringgai aboriginal peoples. Places of significance to Aboriginal people located in the area surrounding Brisbane Water that are listed on the Register of the National Estate include Daleys Point area and Staples Lookout, west of Woy Woy. Initial colonial explorers of the area were assisted by Bungaree, a leader of the Kuringgai tribe who went on to assist Phillip Parker King and Matthew Flinders in the circumnavigation of Australia.

Twentieth century European settlement led to the development of an extensive local ferry network, including one supplying an otherwise isolated orphanage, a commuter service from Gosford to Woy Woy and a third operation dedicated to carrying farm produce. The last commuter ferries between Brisbane Water townships ceased in 1971. The only ferry service to exist now services the communities of Empire Bay, Davistown, Saratoga and Woy Woy and is operated by Central Coast Ferries.

In 1973, local residents on Rileys Island requested a green ban after a development company intended to remove all native vegetation to make way for construction on the island.

==Environment==
The Brisbane Water estuary and foreshores have particularly high scenic value and include areas of pristine vegetation and extensive views of the water from a number of locations. Beaches, inlets and bays can be distinguished in the foreground with inherent juxtaposition of bushland-covered hills in the distance. Access to existing key vantage points allows for the public to experience the landscape character of the Brisbane Water estuary and its surrounds.

With the approximate average bed level at and often as low as , Brisbane Water is considered mostly shallow, with a tidal impact of ±. The inlet narrows at a point known as The Rip, located adjacent to Ettalong Beach. The Rip has a rapid tidal current.

The oyster industry is an important part of the local economy. In terms of Sydney rock oyster production, in 2007–2008 a total of ~250,000 dozens of oysters were produced in the Brisbane Water estuary, with a total value of A$1.3 million representing approximately 3.6% of the NSW industry total for 2007–2008.

During 2009, over 110 bird species were recorded within the estuary; with sixty vulnerable and fourteen endangered animal species, and sixteen vulnerable and eight endangered plant species. Some of Brisbane Water is classified by BirdLife International as an important bird area because it has an isolated population of up to ten breeding pairs of bush stone-curlews and sometimes supports flocks of the endangered regent honeyeater and swift parrot during autumn and winter, when the swamp mahogany trees are in flower.

<doc id="593935" wikidata="Q2026669" url="?curid=593935" title="Peace on Earth (novel)">
<text>Peace on Earth ( ) is a 1985 science fiction novel by Polish writer Stanisław Lem. The novel describes, in a satirical tone, the ultimate implications of the arms race. It is a continuation of the adventures of Ijon Tichy.

== Plot summary==
The evolution of artificial intelligence has allowed major world powers to sign a rather curious treaty: the Moon is divided into national zones (proportional to each nation&#x27;s Earth real estate) and all weapons development and production must be moved there to be handled by factories. This is supposed to completely demilitarize Earth, achieving the long-sought dream of world peace. A MAD stabilizing factor is apparently preserved by the ability of countries, in case of war, to quickly ship weapons down from the Moon.

Unknown to most people, a problem arises. The ever-increasing amount of autonomy given to Moon&#x27;s automata, in order to conduct more-effective espionage in neighbors&#x27; nation facilities and also to defend one&#x27;s own, leads to localized robotic conflicts on the Moon&#x27;s surface. Eventually, after a number of events, there is a total discontinuation of any communication with the Moon. After a number of failed expeditions to reveal the truth on what is going on beneath the Moon&#x27;s surface, Ijon Tichy is called to the rescue.

Right before the return he was hit by a laser weapon which has led to his callosotomy. The resulting split personality leads to his inability to communicate properly both with the people and between the two &quot;alter egos&quot;. This results in a good deal of slapstick comedy, e.g., involving hilarious conflicts between Tichy&#x27;s left and right hand or leg. With the help of his friend, professor Tarantoga, he eventually succeeds in talking to himself.

Another consequence of Tichy&#x27;s visit is that he accidentally brings to the Earth particles of mysterious Moon dust, which turns out to be the result of military-robotic &quot;necroevolution&quot;, described in Lem&#x27;s novel &quot;The Invincible&quot; and which brings a quiet devastation of the whole Earth&#x27;s technological infrastructure and information stored in it.

==Commentary==

The title of the novel is borrowed from the title &quot;Pacem in terris&quot; encyclical issued by Pope John XXIII, and Orliński suggests that the plot was reflecting Lem&#x27;s worries about the contemporary political situation. However Lem himself wrote that contrary the impression, the intention of the book was not political fiction, but it was an attempt to envision a situation when two independent consciousnesses evolve in one brain. He explained that to this end he undertook an extensive study of professional literature and as a result the background of this plot element was 80% scientific and 20% fictional invention.

Wojciech Orliński notes that the novel is a fabularization of the ideas put forth in the &quot;Library of the 21st Century&quot;, Lem&#x27;s faux review of the (non-existing) book &quot;Weapon Systems of The Twenty First Century or The Upside-down Evolution&quot;. In fact, in Chapter 2 Tichy reads this book.

Jerzy Jarzębski observes that the finale of the novel involving the destruction of information resembles the finales of several other Lem&#x27;s novels: &quot;Professor A. Dońda&quot;, &quot;The Invincible&quot;, and &quot;Memoirs Found in a Bathtub&quot;.

<doc id="593951" wikidata="Q7869112" url="?curid=593951" title="USS Elizabeth C. Stanton">
<text>USS &quot;Elizabeth C. Stanton&quot; (AP-69) was the lead ship of her class of Second World War United States Navy transport ships, named for the suffragist and abolitionist Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

&quot;Elizabeth C. Stanton&quot; was launched on 22 December 1939 as &quot;Sea Star&quot; by Moore Dry Dock Company, Oakland, California, for Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. Richard J. Welch; renamed &quot;Mormacstar&quot; in 1940; transferred to the Navy on 13 September 1942; and commissioned on 17 September 1942.

==Service history==
Sailing from Norfolk on 24 October 1942, &quot;Elizabeth C. Stanton&quot; quickly landed her troops and equipment for the assault on North Africa on 8 November and got underway for the States within the week. After another rapid voyage to North Africa to support the troops fighting ashore, she returned to Norfolk on 24 April 1943 and the following day became flagship for amphibious exercises in Chesapeake Bay.

On 10 May 1943 &quot;Elizabeth C. Stanton&quot; sailed again for the Mediterranean, where she saw action during the invasion of Sicily on 10 July. She remained off the island discharging troops and combat cargo, and fighting off enemy aircraft for six days. She returned to Algeria to prepare for the next operation, and on 9 September landed her troops at Salerno in the initial assault. Until the end of October, she carried reinforcement troops from Bizerte and Oran to Naples for the capture and occupation of Italy, then sailed for New York and overhaul.

When &quot;Elizabeth C. Stanton&quot; returned to transport duty in January 1944, preparations were underway for the June invasion of Normandy; she made two voyages to carry troops and cargo for the huge buildup in the British Isles. On 14 March 1944 she departed Belfast for Algeria, and subsequently carried troops to Naples, taking part in amphibious exercises and antisubmarine patrols until August. Then she saw action in the initial landings on the coast of southern France. She continued to support this operation by transporting troops and cargo throughout the Mediterranean until returning to the United States on 8 November.

After overhaul at New York, &quot;Elizabeth C. Stanton&quot; sailed for the Pacific on 4 January 1945, and arrived at Espiritu Santo on 23 February. Assigned to redeploy troops in the central and southern Pacific, she sailed from Pearl Harbor to the New Hebrides, Marianas, Marshalls, Solomons, Carolines and Okinawa Gunto. Arriving at San Francisco on 11 July for repairs, she sailed again in August to transport troops for the occupation of Japan. She returned to the West Coast late in 1945. On 20 January 1946 she carried 1,800 German prisoners of war with their US Army guards from Long Beach to Liverpool and Le Havre. She returned to New York on 5 March and was decommissioned on 3 April 1946, ownership reverting to the Maritime Commission on the same day.

&quot;Elizabeth C. Stanton&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

==Return to commerce==
On 24 August 1946 the ship was returned to Moore McCormack Lines for operation until sold to Peninsular Navigation Co. on 14 February 1961 to be renamed &quot;Jacqueline Someck&quot;. The ship was sold back to Moore McCormack on 18 December 1963 to be sold again on 28 February 1964 to Windward Steamship Co. to be renamed &quot;National Seafarer&quot;. The ship was sold to interest in Japan and scrapped September 1967.

<doc id="593964" wikidata="Q281988" url="?curid=593964" title="The Sacrifice (1986 film)">
<text>The Sacrifice () is a 1986 drama film written and directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Starring Erland Josephson, the film was produced by the Swedish Film Institute. Many of the crew were alumni of Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s films, including cinematographer Sven Nykvist. &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; centers on a middle-aged intellectual who attempts to bargain with God to stop an impending nuclear holocaust. The film combines pagan and Christian religious themes; Tarkovsky called it a &quot;parable&quot;.

&quot;The Sacrifice&quot; was Tarkovsky&#x27;s third film as a Soviet expatriate, after &quot;Nostalghia&quot; and the documentary &quot;Voyage in Time&quot;, and he died shortly after its completion. He was diagnosed with cancer after filming concluded, and by 1986, was unable to attend its presentation at the Cannes Film Festival due to his illness. Like 1972&#x27;s &quot;Solaris&quot; by Tarkovsky, &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; also won the Grand Prix at the Cannes.

==Plot==
Alexander is an actor who gave up the stage to work as a journalist, critic and lecturer on aesthetics. He lives in a beautiful house with his actress wife Adelaide, stepdaughter Marta, and young son, &quot;Little Man&quot;, who is temporarily mute due to a throat operation. Alexander and Little Man plant a tree by the seaside, when Alexander&#x27;s friend Otto, a part-time postman, delivers a birthday card to him. When Otto asks, Alexander says his relationship with God is &quot;nonexistent&quot;. After Otto leaves, Adelaide and Victor, a medical doctor and a close family friend who performed Little Man&#x27;s operation, arrive and offer to take Alexander and Little Man home in Victor&#x27;s car, but Alexander prefers to stay behind and talk to his son. In his monologue, he first recounts how he and Adelaide found their house near the sea by accident, and how they fell in love with it and its surroundings, but then enters a bitter tirade against the state of modern man. As Tarkovsky wrote, Alexander is weary of &quot;the pressures of change, the discord in his family, and his instinctive sense of the threat posed by the relentless march of technology&quot;; in fact, he has &quot;grown to hate the emptiness of human speech&quot;.

The family, Victor, and Otto gather at Alexander&#x27;s house for the celebration. Their maid Maria leaves, while nurse-maid Julia stays to help with the dinner. People comment on Maria&#x27;s odd behavior. The guests chat inside the house, where Otto reveals that he is a student of paranormal phenomena, a collector of &quot;inexplicable but true incidents.&quot; Just when dinner is almost ready, the rumbling noise of low-flying jet fighters interrupts them, and soon after, as Alexander enters, a news program announces the beginning of what appears to be World War III, and possibly nuclear holocaust. His wife has a complete nervous breakdown. In despair, Alexander vows to God to renounce all he loves, even Little Man, if this may be undone. Otto advises him to slip away and lie with Maria, who Otto tells him is a witch &quot;in the best possible sense&quot;.

Alexander takes a pistol from Victor&#x27;s medical bag, leaves a note in his room, escapes the house, and rides Otto&#x27;s bike to Maria&#x27;s house. He tells her the story of when he fixed up and brought order to his mother&#x27;s garden, only to find that it lost all its beauty when he did so. She is bewildered when he makes his advances, but when he puts the gun to his temple (&quot;Don&#x27;t kill us, Maria&quot;), at which point the jet fighters&#x27; rumblings return, she soothes him and they make love while floating above her bed, though Alexander&#x27;s reaction is ambiguous.

When he wakes the next morning, in his own bed, everything seems normal. Nevertheless, Alexander sets forth to give up all he loves and possesses. He tricks the family members and friends into going for a walk, and sets fire to their house while they are away. As the group rushes back, alarmed by the fire, Alexander confesses that he set it, and runs around wildly. Maria, who until then was not seen that morning, appears; Alexander tries to approach her, but is restrained by others. Without explanation, an ambulance appears, and two paramedics chase Alexander, who appears to have lost control of himself, and drive off with him. Maria begins to bicycle away, but stops to observe Little Man watering the tree he and Alexander planted the day before. As Maria leaves, the &quot;mute&quot; Little Man, lying at the foot of the tree, speaks his only line, which quotes the opening of the Gospel of John: &quot;In the beginning was the Word. Why is that, Papa?&quot;

==Production==

===Pre-production===
&quot;The Sacrifice&quot; originated as a screenplay called &quot;The Witch&quot;, which preserved the element of a middle-aged protagonist spending the night with a reputed witch. But in this story, his cancer was miraculously cured, and he ran away with the woman. In March 1982, Tarkovsky wrote in his journal that he considered this ending &quot;weak&quot;, as the happy ending was unchallenged. He wanted personal favorite and frequent collaborator Anatoly Solonitsyn to star in this picture, as was also his intention for &quot;Nostalghia&quot;, but when Solonitsyn died from cancer in 1982, the director rewrote the screenplay into what became &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; and also filmed &quot;Nostalghia&quot; with Oleg Yankovsky as the lead.

Tarkovsky considered &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; different from his earlier films because, while his recent films had been &quot;impressionistic in structure&quot;, in this case he not only &quot;aimed...to develop [its] episodes in the light of my own experience and of the rules of dramatic structure&quot;, but also to &quot;[build] the picture into a poetic whole in which all the episodes were harmoniously linked&quot;, and because of this, it &quot;took on the form of a poetic parable&quot;.

At the 1984 Cannes Film Festival, Tarkovsky was invited to film in Sweden, as he was a longtime friend of Anna-Lena Wibom of the Swedish Film Institute. He decided to film &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; with Erland Josephson, who was best known for his work with Ingmar Bergman, and whom Tarkovsky had directed in &quot;Nostalghia&quot;. Cinematographer Sven Nykvist, a friend of Josephson and frequent collaborator with Bergman, was asked to join the production. Despite a contemporaneous offer to shoot Sydney Pollack&#x27;s &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, Nykvist later said it was &quot;not a difficult choice&quot;, and like Josephson, he became a co-producer when he invested his fees back into the film. Production designer Anna Asp, who worked on Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; and &quot;After the Rehearsal&quot; and had won an Academy Award for &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;, also joined the project, as well as Daniel Bergman, one of Ingmar&#x27;s children, who worked as a camera assistant. Many critics commented on &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; in the context of Bergman&#x27;s work.

===Filming===
While often erroneously claimed to have been shot on Fårö, &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; was actually filmed at Närsholmen on the nearby island of Gotland; the Swedish military denied Tarkovsky access to Fårö.

Alexander&#x27;s house, built for the production, was to be burned for the climactic scene, in which Alexander burns it and his possessions. The shot was very difficult to achieve, and the first failed attempt was, according to Tarkovsky, the only problem during shooting. Despite Nykvist&#x27;s protest, only one camera was used, and while shooting the burning house, the camera jammed and the footage was thus ruined.

The scene had to be reshot, requiring a very costly reconstruction of the house in two weeks. This time, two cameras were set up on tracks, running parallel to each other. The footage in the final version of the film is the second take, which lasts six minutes (and ends abruptly because the camera had run through an entire reel). The cast and crew broke down in tears after the take was completed.

===Music===
The film opens and closes with the aria &quot;Erbarme dich, mein Gott&quot; (&quot;Have mercy, my God&quot;) from Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;. The soundtrack also features &quot;shakuhachi&quot; recordings by Watazumi Doso.

===Post-production===
Tarkovsky and Nykvist performed significant amounts of color reduction on select scenes. According to Nykvist, almost 60% of the color was removed from them.
==Release==
The film opened at the Lumiere in London on 9 January 1987 and grossed £16,020 in its opening weekend.
==Reception==
===Critical response===
Since its release, reviewers have responded positively to the film; the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 86%, based on 43 reviews with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Formally impressive, visually accomplished, and narratively rewarding, &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; places a fittingly solid capstone on a brilliant filmmaking career&quot;.

In 1995, the Vatican compiled a list of 45 &quot;great films&quot;, separated into the categories of Religion, Values, and Art, to recognize the centennial of cinema. &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; was included in the first category, as was Tarkovsky&#x27;s &quot;Andrei Rublev&quot;.

Critics have commented on &quot;The Sacrifice&quot;&#x27;s religious ambiguities. Dennis Lim wrote that it is &quot;not exactly a simple allegory of Christian atonement and self-sacrifice&quot;. Catholic film critic Steven Greydanus contrasts the film&#x27;s &quot;dialectic of Christian and pagan ideas&quot; with &quot;Andrei Rublev&quot;, writing that, while Rublev &quot;[rejects] the advances of an alluring pagan witch as incompatible with Christian love&quot;, &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; &quot;juxtaposes&quot; both sensibilities. Andrew Petiprin highlights the difficulty of faith in his review.
===Awards and nominations===
The film won Tarkovsky his second Grand Prix, after &quot;Solaris&quot;, his third FIPRESCI Prize at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival, and his third Palme D&#x27;Or nomination. &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; also won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. At the 22nd Guldbagge Awards, the film won the awards for Best Film and Best Actor (Erland Josephson). In 1988, it won the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 59th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

<text>USS &quot;Dorothea L. Dix&quot; (AP-67) was a transport ship of the United States Navy named for American activist Dorothea Dix (1802–1887).

==Construction and career==
&quot;Dorothea L. Dix&quot; was launched on 22 June 1940 as &quot;Exemplar&quot; by Bethlehem Steel Company, Quincy, Massachusetts, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Miss P. J. Kalloch; transferred to the Navy on 13 September 1942; and commissioned on 17 September 1942.

===Mediterranean, 1942–1943===
Putting to sea from Cove Point, Maryland, on 23 October 1942, &quot;Dorothea L. Dix&quot; sailed with Task Force 34 (TF 34) to land Army troops and supply scout boats in the assault at Safi, French Morocco, from 8 to 12 November, during &quot;Operation Torch&quot;. She returned to Norfolk on 24 November. Between 12 December 1942 and 5 April 1943 she made two more transatlantic voyages to Oran, Algeria, carrying Army troops and nurses.

After amphibious training at Norfolk, she sailed on 8 June 1943 for Oran, arriving on 22 June. On 5 July she got underway for the invasion of Sicily, arriving off Scoglitti late on 9 July and debarking her troops and cargo early the next day under heavy air attack. She embarked wounded and one Italian prisoner and returned to Oran on 15 July. A week later she was en route to New York, arriving on 3 August to debark her passengers, German prisoners of war. A similar voyage was made to Oran between 21 August and 21 September after which she sailed on 8 October for the United Kingdom.

&quot;Dorothea L. Dix&quot; arrived at Gourock Bay, Scotland, on 17 October 1943, and sailed ten days later for Algiers where she exchanged troops for 243 survivors of and for Oran to embark Army troops. She unloaded cargo at Gourock Bay between 24 and 30 November then sailed to New York, arriving on 11 December. Between 29 December 1943 and 10 March 1944 she carried troops on two voyages from New York to Gourock Bay and Liverpool.

===Normandy landings, 1944 ===
On 23 March 1944 &quot;Dorothea L. Dix&quot; sailed from New York for Belfast, Northern Ireland, arriving on 3 April. After amphibious training in the Clyde area, she sortied with Temporary Transport Division 97 from the Isle of Portland, England, on 5 June for the invasion landings at Normandy the following day. She returned to Weymouth Bay on the 7th to debark casualties, then embarked troops in the Clyde area and tanks at Avonmouth which she carried to Naples, arriving on 16 July.

Ernest Hemingway wrote a first-hand account of the Normandy landings from the &quot;Dix&quot; for Collier&#x27;s.

===Mediterranean, 1944===
She put out from Naples on 13 August 1944 for the invasion of southern France two days later, unloading tanks and Army troops for the assault landings. She continued to support this operation by carrying French, British, and Italian as well as American troops to Baie de la Cavalaire and Marseilles from Naples and Oran until 22 October. Three days later she left Oran for New York, arriving on 8 November.
===Pacific, 1945–1946===
&quot;Dorothea L. Dix&quot; put to sea from New York on 18 December 1944, and arrived at San Francisco on 4 January 1945. Two weeks later she sailed to carry Army troops to Pearl Harbor, returning to San Francisco on 2 February. After a voyage to Attu, to transport Army troops to Aleutian Islands she proceeded to Okinawa arriving on 1 May. Here she landed support troops and embarked casualties and naval passengers for San Francisco, arriving on 27 May.

Between 10 June 1945 and 9 February 1946 &quot;Dorothea L. Dix&quot; operated on transport duty from San Francisco and other west coast ports to the Philippines, carrying replacements to the Pacific and returning veterans. She sailed to New York on 29 March 1946, was decommissioned there on 24 April 1946, and returned to the Maritime Commission for disposal the same day. In commercial service until sold 13 December 1968 to Aguilar y Peria, S.L., Spain for scrap.

==Awards==
&quot;Dorothea L. Dix&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

<text>The Wingecarribee River (Aboriginal Dharawal: &quot;Winge Karrabee&quot;), a perennial river that is part of the Hawkesbury–Nepean catchment, is located in the Southern Highlands region of New South Wales, Australia.

==Course and features==
Wingecarribee River rises on the heights at Robertson below Wingecarribee Reservoir, near the village of Glenquarry, and flows generally northwest, joined by two minor tributaries and through the Belanglo State Forest and Bangadilly National Park, before reaching its confluence with the Wollondilly River north of the locality of Tugalong, northwest of Berrima. The river descends over its course.

In its upper reaches, the feeder creeks of the Wingecarribee form the Wingecarribee Swamp, the only substantial peat bog in New South Wales. Most of the swamp has been drained and the remaining section of the swamp is the habitat of a number of endangered species. The river runs through a valley on the plateau that is home to a popular camp, Biloela.

The Moss Vale Road crosses the river at Bong Bong, between Bowral and Moss Vale. At Berrima, the river is crossed by the Hume Freeway.

The Shoalhaven Scheme pumps water from the Shoalhaven River into the Wingecarribee Reservoir and this water supply augments the water supply for greater metropolitan Sydney.

<doc id="593973" wikidata="Q1210927" url="?curid=593973" title="Warragamba Dam">
<text>Warragamba Dam is a heritage-listed dam in the outer South Western Sydney suburb of Warragamba, Wollondilly Shire in New South Wales, Australia. It is a concrete gravity dam, which creates Lake Burragorang, the primary reservoir for water supply for the city of Sydney. The dam wall is located approximately W of Sydney central business district, 4½ km SW of the town of Wallacia, and 1 km NW of the village of Warragamba.

The dam was devised as part of a collective engineering response to Sydney&#x27;s critical water shortage during World War II and was originally known as the Warragamba Emergency Scheme. Constructed between 1948 and 1960, the dam created capacity for a reservoir of and is fed by a catchment area of . The surface area of the lake covers of the now-flooded Burragorang Valley. It was designed and built by the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board. A small hydroelectric power station was incorporated into the design of the dam but has been disconnected from the grid since 2001.

The property is owned by WaterNSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The dam was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.

Drought has severely depleted the level of the dam at times: on 8 February 2007 it recorded an all-time low of 32.55555555% of capacity. On 2 March 2012, it overflowed for the first time in fourteen years. It overflowed again in 2016, March 2021, March 2022 and April 2024.

==History==
One of the first places in the Gundungurra traditional homelands that most appealed to the Anglo-Celtic settlers were the river flats of the Burragorang Valley (now flooded under Lake Burragorang). Even before the valley was officially surveyed in 1827-1828, many early settlers were already squatting on blocks that they planned to officially occupy following the issue of freehold title grants. From the Burragorang Valley and using Aboriginal pathways, other valleys to the west were occupied and developed by the settlers with construction of outstations and stock routes. These cattle entrepreneurs were then followed by cedar-wood extractors and miners.

In 1845, Paweł Strzelecki drew attention to the Warragamba River as a water supply catchment; in 1867, supporters proposed a dam.

The Gundungurra traditional owners resisted the taking of their lands, and, relying on various laws of the colony at the time, continually applied for official ownership. Although their individual claims failed, in some kind of recognition of the significance of the designated tracts of land claimed, six Aboriginal Reserves (under the control of the NSW Aborigines Protection Board) were formally declared in the Burragorang Valley. Even after these reserves were revoked, many of the traditional owners remained, quietly refusing to leave their traditional homelands.

Finally pushed into the &quot;Gully&quot;, a fringe development in West Katoomba from about 1894, the Gully community stayed together for more than 60 years until dispossessed of the Gully by the then Blue Mountains Shire Council so a group of local businessmen could develop a speedway that became known as the Catalina Race Track. The Gully people kept talking about areas of land they had walked in as children – the nearby Megalong and Kanimbla Valleys and the Burragorang Valley. They knew of the profound significance of these valleys for their parents and grandparents.

Between 1867 and 1946, supporters of Strzelecki&#x27;s proposal proposed various schemes before the site and design of the current dam received approval.

===Warragamba Emergency Scheme===
In 1910, Ernest de Burgh, Chief Engineer for Water Supply and Sewerage, in the NSW Public Works Department prepared a proposal for a dam on the Warragamba River and followed it up in 1918 with more detailed plans. His proposals were passed onto the newly formed Metropolitan Water and Sewerage and Drainage Board in 1925 when it took over from the P.W.D. The completion of the Warragamba Emergency Scheme required during its peak 1,000 waged employees at the Headworks, and a further 1,000 on the Pipeline. All buildings used in the construction of the Emergency Scheme were designed for later re-use as cottages for the future maintenance and operations personnel. Some of these buildings were relocated from elsewhere. The main works office was the original police station at the Nepean Dam site.

In 1940, a weir and water pumping station, known as the Warragamba Emergency Scheme, reached completion, just downstream of the main dam site, located on the east bank of the Warragamba River. Access to the site was along the road currently known as Weir Road. Major elements of the construction works still extant include the weir, a 10-cable cableway, shads, batching plants, roads, electrical substation, chlorination plant, maintenance staff accommodation, balance reservoir, Megarritys Bridge, water pumping station, tunnels, and associated pipelines.

===1948–1960: construction of current dam===
In 1943 the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board invited the geologist William Browne to investigate a proposed site. Browne found a more suitable site and continued as geological adviser until completion. The site was reviewed and approved by Dr John Savage, considered the pre-eminent expert in this field, and formally accepted by the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board on 2 October 1946. The Board appointed Thomas Upton as the engineer.

The Warragamba River flows through a gorge that varies in width from , and is in depth. This gorge opens at its upper end into a large valley, the Burragorang Valley. This river configuration allows for a relatively short but high dam wall, in the gorge, to impound a vast quantity of water.

Dam construction began in 1948 and was completed in 1960. The resulting dam of the Warragamba River formed Lake Burragorang, which is one of the largest reservoirs for urban water supply in the world.

The dam wall comprises of concrete. It was laid as interlocking blocks roughly on each side, which were later grouted together to form a continuous, monolithic wall. It is so large that engineers had to use two techniques to prevent the temperature from becoming too hot as the concrete set. One was to add ice to the wet concrete, the first application of this technique in Australia. The other was to embed cooling pipes into the concrete and circulate chilled water through the pipes. As a result, the dam wall was cooled in a few months instead of the estimated 100 years it would have taken to cool naturally.

==Description and recent works==
The dam impounds the Coxs, Kowmung, Nattai, Wingecarribee, Wollondilly, and Warragamba rivers, within the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment.

The dam created capacity for a reservoir of and is fed by a catchment area of . The surface area of the lake covers of the now flooded Burragorang Valley.

===Spillway===
 The main spillway has five crest gates: A central drum gate with a clear span with a pair of radial gates on each side. Each radial gate has a clear span. The drum gate is hinged along the upstream edge to the upstream crest and lowers into the dam wall to allow water to flow over it. When it is fully open, it forms a continuation of the crest profile. All gates open automatically as the dam passes full water level, or can be manually opened. The auxiliary spillway is normally closed by a series of fuse plugs that are designed to be washed away in the event of an extreme flood event.

As originally designed, the dam could safely withstand a peak inflow of , leading to a peak discharge of down the spillway. Following a 1987 and 1989 re-evaluation of the potential rainfall and flood risks, the New South Wales Government authorised for the dam wall to be raised by and constructed an auxiliary spillway on the east bank of the dam.

===Power generation===
There was also a hydroelectric power station at the dam that could generate , transmitting its output over a 132 kV transmission line to a Penrith Substation. Water levels very rarely became high enough to allow operation of the generators. By 2001, it was rarely used and was disconnected from the electricity grid.

===21st century re-engineering and enhancements===
In 2006, the Warragamba Deep Water Storage Recovery Project, part of the Metropolitan Water Plan, penetrated the base of the dam wall to allow the previously inaccessible lowest water in the reservoir to be available. This new outlet was below the minimum level required for gravity flow, which delivered water from the existing outlets. The project constructed a new pumping station downstream of the dam. The new pumping station is within the Emergency Scheme pumping station chamber. This project provided access to eight per cent more water or approximately six months of extra supply. On 15 April 2006, the project reached a major milestone when it increased the available storage from to .

Enhancements to the dam were completed in 2009, including the addition of an auxiliary spillway to manage extreme flood events.

Other recent major work includes a complete upgrade of the three passenger lifts within the dam wall, an upgrade of the travelling crest crane and a complete upgrade of the four water supply outlets in the valve house, which includes the replacement of the major valves.

===Proposed raising of dam wall===
Since 2017, WaterNSW has been working on a risk-mitigation project, aimed at protecting human life and property in the floodplain catchment area in case of major flooding, primarily by raising the dam wall by up to . Infrastructure NSW&#x27;s rationale is based on the fact that up to 134,000 people live and work on the floodplain, and urban growth could greatly increase this number in decades to come; giving the dam a greater capacity would enable holding back floodwaters before releasing it in a controlled fashion, reducing the need for urgent evacuations.

However, there are concerns for the more than 50 recognised Aboriginal heritage sites in the of World Heritage Area that would be flooded, parts of which were badly burnt in the 2019–2020 bushfires in Australia. The box gum grassy woodlands are home to threatened species of birds, including up to 50% of the remaining population of the critically endangered regent honeyeater, as well as koalas and greater gliders.

In September 2020, the New South Wales Government was ordered by the federal Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment to re-do their Indigenous heritage work, concerned that NSW has not adequately addressed the concerns of Gundungurra and other traditional owners in their cultural heritage surveys. The federal review also said that the environmental impact assessment lacked detail on how the project could affect species such as the platypus and echidna. Engineering experts have also questioned the modelling done by Infrastructure NSW.

In April 2024, after the seventh flood in 18 months in northwestern Sydney, the NSW water minister Rose Jackson proposed the idea of lowering Warragamba Dam&#x27;s storage and supplementing it with desalinated water to decrease flood danger in Sydney&#x27;s north-west. The plan would mean a proportion of the dam&#x27;s capacity would be brushed aside for flood mitigation. According to her, this will be cheaper than raising the dam&#x27;s wall by 14 metres (a proposal scrapped by the Labor government in 2023). University of Sydney water expert, Professor Stuart Khan stated that the Sydney Desalination Plant can produce 90 gigalitres of water a year, which would drop 40% of the dam&#x27;s capacity.

==Catchment==
The catchment area is . The areas closest to the lake, making up around 30% of the total catchment, are restricted access special areas. Most of the rest

Although the engineers did not design Warragamba Dam as a flood control measure, it can mitigate flooding by holding floodwaters back while the reservoir fills.

===Dam level crises and water restrictions===
There have been times when drought has seriously depleted the dam. In March 1983, Lake Burragorang&#x27;s level reached a low of 45.4% of capacity, only to reach the maximum level in the mid-1990s; as a consequence, the gates were opened (there was a significant spill in August 1998). Between 1998 and 2007 the catchment area experienced extremely low rainfall (in December 2004, the dam dropped to 38.8% of capacity, the lowest on record to date) and on 8 February 2007 it recorded an all-time low of 32.5% of capacity.

The New South Wales State Government tried to reduce this risk by implementing water restrictions and commissioned the construction of a desalination plant, at Kurnell. Heavy rains between June 2007 and February 2008 restored the dam level to around 67%. Despite this, Level 3 water restrictions remained in place until 21 June 2009.

On 30 February 2012, it was reported that the dam was likely to overflow for the first time in fourteen years, due to continuing heavy rain in the region. The dam began spilling at 18:53 (AEDT) on 2 March 2012 and again on 20 April 2012.

The dam reached full capacity on 17 August 2020, compared with it being less than half full a year previously. During a days long severe weather event, affecting much of New South Wales, it overflowed for the first time since 2016 on 20 March 2021. In March 2022, following heavy rains across NSW and Queensland, the dam once again overflowed, flooding areas downstream.

Warragamba Dam again reached 100% capacity on 26 November 2021 and began spilling following a prolonged period of rain in NSW.

==Statistical overview==


==Access and recreation==
Warragamba Dam was a popular picnic spot for Sydneysiders, but access to the public was restricted after 1999 due to A$240 million of upgrades in that time. It reopened to the public on 8 November 2009.

Access to the dam wall and terrace gardens opened from 23 December 2012 to 28 January 2013 at weekends and public holidays.

==Heritage listing==
The Emergency Scheme is representative of the collective engineering response to Sydney&#x27;s critical water shortage during the Second World War period. It was the first stage in the storage and extraction of water from the Warragamba River, and was preliminary to the Waragamba Dam. All of the components are excellent examples of the civil engineering skills of the times; the Balance Reservoir is particularly significant because it provides a stilling pool downstream of Warragamba Dam for the purpose of flood discharge; the group of five cottages associated with the construction of the dam are considered to be of high significance because they housed the operations staff between 1940 and 1959. These have since been incorporated into the Warragamba township, one of the largest townships in the Shire of Wollondilly.

The Warragamba Emergency Scheme was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999, having satisfied the following criteria:
* The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.
* This item is assessed as historically rare statewide and as well as scientifically rare statewide.

==In popular culture==
* Warragamba Slammer is a popular phrase used in Australian pubs and restaurants throughout Greater Sydney as a reference to tap water.

<text>Sir Arnold Henry Nordmeyer (born Heinrich Arnold Nordmeyer, 7 February 1901 – 2 February 1989) was a New Zealand politician and Presbyterian minister. As a member of Parliament (MP) he played a crucial role in the Labour Party, serving from 1935 to 1969. He served as minister of finance (1957–1960) and later as leader of the Labour Party and leader of the Opposition (1963–1965). Although he was a prominent statesman, Nordmeyer never ascended to the role of prime minister. 

Despite facing backlash for the 1958 &quot;Black Budget&quot; as finance minister, his political legacy primarily revolves around his economic policies, especially his introduction of New Zealand&#x27;s comprehensive national health service as minister of health (1941–1947).

==Early life==

Nordmeyer was born on 7 February 1901 in Dunedin, New Zealand. His father was a German immigrant, his mother was from Northern Ireland. He was educated at Waitaki Boys&#x27; High School, and at the University of Otago where he completed his BA. After graduating he studied theology, having always been highly religious. At university he became known for his skills in debating which were to serve him well in his later career. Although he did not join the Labour Party until 1933, he became increasingly sympathetic to the party&#x27;s views. It was at this time that he met Walter Nash who may have been influential in shaping his views in health and social policy. In 1925 Nordmeyer received his ordination as a Presbyterian minister and was appointed to a position in the small town of Kurow.

While in Kurow during the Great Depression, Nordmeyer witnessed firsthand the effects of the economic downturn on the community and people of the town, which lead him to study radical political theory in pursuit of a solution. He also became interested in the welfare of workers involved in the construction of a hydroelectric dam on the Waitaki River. He became increasingly politically active as a result witnessing both the working conditions of the labourers and the poor living conditions of the unemployed men and their families who were attracted to the area by the promise of work. At Kurow, Nordmeyer, along with local doctor and future Labour MP Gervan McMillan and school headmaster Andrew Davidson developed ideas of how to apply Christian ethics to politics to solve the miseries of unemployment, poverty and illness – ideas that were later implemented by the First Labour Government of New Zealand. It was also in Kurow that Nordmeyer met his future wife, Frances Kernahan whom he married in 1931.

==Political career==
===Member of Parliament===




Shortly before the 1935 election Nordmeyer stepped down from his church position, stating an intent to contest the Oamaru seat for the Labour Party. He was elected. The 1935 election itself was a huge victory for Labour and the party&#x27;s leader, Michael Joseph Savage, became the country&#x27;s first Labour Prime Minister.

In Parliament Nordmeyer proved to be a skilled debater but also had a somewhat troubled relationship with his party&#x27;s leadership. Nordmeyer became part of the faction led by John A. Lee who criticised Savage&#x27;s policies as too moderate. Gradually, however, Nordmeyer became disillusioned with Lee, alleging that Lee was egotistical and self-important. Nordmeyer later co-operated with more moderate politicians such as Walter Nash in drafting the party&#x27;s social security policies. He chaired both the caucus committee and the parliamentary select committee which considered the matters in more depth. Eventually the committees recommended a scheme containing a means-tested pension, universal superannuation, and free healthcare for hospital treatments, maternity care and general practitioner consultations all to be financed via direct taxation. At Nordmeyer&#x27;s insistence, the health and pensions schemes would be combined into a single measure which later became the Social Security Act 1938.

After the 1938 election that Labour won resoundingly, tensions between the moderate and extreme wings of the party became worse. Nordmeyer attempted to take a position between both groups but was generally closer to Lee&#x27;s camp than to the other. The year 1940 saw both the death of Savage and the expulsion from the Labour Party of Lee, a move which Nordmeyer opposed. He was one of the few speakers against the motion to expel Lee at the party conference that year, an action which would in later years give him a reputation for political courage. Nordmeyer nominated Gervan McMillan, an old friend from Kurow and a supporter of Lee, as the party&#x27;s new leader. McMillan, however, was defeated by Peter Fraser, Savage&#x27;s chief lieutenant.

===Cabinet minister===
In 1941 Nordmeyer became Minister of Health. In this role, which he held until 1947, he was responsible (along with Walter Nash) for introducing state subsidies for doctor&#x27;s visits. The New Zealand Branch of the British Medical Association had disagreed with the government on the process of free general practitioner consultations where they refused to accept a state fee for their services. Doctors argued that the relationship between themselves and patients was dependent on a direct payment by the patient. A compromise was eventually reached where doctors would continue to charge patients directly after which time patients could then claim a social security rebate. With this initial hurdle overcome, Nordmeyer progressed with the governments agenda over the next six years introducing further benefits for pharmaceutical prescriptions, dental care, hospital outpatients and X-ray diagnosis.

From 1947 to 1949, Nordmeyer was Minister of Industries and Commerce. He was charged with the administration of New Zealand&#x27;s comprehensive system of import licensing controls and was an advocate for the establishment of new industries and having greater protection for local industries. He also pushed for development policies designed to make New Zealand more economically self-sufficient. By this time he came to be regarded as one of the most senior members of the government.

In the 1949 election, however, Labour was defeated by the National Party under Sidney Holland. Nordmeyer himself lost his seat of Oamaru against Thomas Hayman. In late 1950 Peter Fraser died and Nordmeyer was elected in the 1951 by-election as his replacement in the seat of Brooklyn. In 1954 he won the Island Bay seat, which he held until he retired in 1969.

In the short period between Fraser&#x27;s death and Nordmeyer&#x27;s return to Parliament Walter Nash had been hastily elected leader of the Labour Party. The speed of Nash&#x27;s ascent is sometimes seen as evidence that his supporters considered Nordmeyer a threat. Nordmeyer, although he had worked with Nash before, opposed Nash&#x27;s appointment as he objected to Nash&#x27;s leadership style and considered Nash to be both autocratic and uninspiring. In 1954 Nordmeyer began a challenge for the leadership. Although Nordmeyer gained considerable backing from certain sectors of the party, Nash enjoyed strong union support and defeated the challenge in caucus on 23 June 1954.

Following the unsuccessful challenge to Nash, Nordmeyer together with Bill Anderton and Phil Connolly were called before The Labour Party National Executive and given warnings about the threat of divisiveness to the party.

===Minister of Finance===

When Labour won the 1957 election Nordmeyer was made Minister of Finance and was ranked third within the government. A short time after taking office Nordmeyer uncovered that the country was on the brink of a balance of payments crisis and decided to take strong measures in response. His first Budget (generally known as &quot;the Black Budget&quot;) introduced a number of unpopular changes, including significant tax increases. The particularly large tax increases for alcohol and tobacco, coupled with Nordmeyer&#x27;s strong religious background, created the impression that he was attempting to impose puritan-like reforms (Nordmeyer did not drink or smoke). Nordmeyer&#x27;s idea was that a short sharp corrective budget would fix the economic situation and from then on there would be nothing other than improvement until the next election.

The crisis was largely averted and the balance of payments situation was resolved favourably. As a result, the taxes were reduced in Nordmeyer&#x27;s next two budgets. However this did not quell the unpopularity of his first budget. Consequently, Labour was duly voted out of office in the 1960 election, something that many historians blame on Nordmeyer&#x27;s &quot;Black Budget&quot;.

===Leader of the Opposition===
Despite attracting considerable blame for Labour&#x27;s loss of support Nordmeyer was elected to lead the Labour Party when Nash retired in 1963. Future interim prime minister Hugh Watt became Nordmeyer&#x27;s deputy leader. His first test as leader came with a by-election in the normally safe seat of which Labour managed to retain and slightly increase their majority. This boosted confidence ahead of the where Nordmeyer led Labour to slightly increase its vote share and gain one seat from National.

The memory of the &quot;Black Budget&quot; still haunted Nordmeyer&#x27;s profile, however, and many within the party believed that it was time for &quot;a new generation&quot; to take control. In 1965 a group of Labour MP&#x27;s formed a group known as the &#x27;Mafia&#x27; who were dedicated to replacing Nordmeyer with Norman Kirk. This was due to some within the Labour caucus thinking Nordmeyer &quot;out of touch&quot; with his Members and vice versa, some considering him an autocratic loner, despite his considerable debating abilities. Over time Nordmeyer had drifted to the right of the Labour Party despite being on the left and defending Lee in the 1930s. This caused him to lose support among Labour&#x27;s more radical members. Even members on the right and those who were more appreciative of his abilities also came to the conclusion that Labour would be unelectable under Nordmeyer&#x27;s leadership. Kirk eventually emerged as the favourite candidate to succeed Nordmeyer and in a vote on 9 December 1965, Nordmeyer was defeated by 25 votes to 10. His defeat severed a link with Labour&#x27;s past as Nordmeyer, by then, was alone among his colleagues as having served in the first Labour government&#x27;s cabinet. Historians regard his replacement with Kirk as transitioning Labour into a new generation.

After his defeat Nordmeyer did not wish for a shadow cabinet position and decided to sit on the backbench, but he did offer himself again as a candidate at the . He remained a respected figure in the Labour Party for his experience and service and continued to be regarded by historians as one of the best ministers the Labour Party had produced. A later Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand quipped about Nordmeyer:

==Retirement from politics==
Nordmeyer remained in Parliament for another four years, retiring at the 1969 election. At the 1971 local-body elections he was elected a member of the Wellington Hospital Board.

Between 1971 and 1974, Nordmeyer served as president of the New Zealand Insurance Workers&#x27; Union. Nordmeyer was the first public figure to be elected president, as earlier union leaders had been full-time insurance workers. He was elected president due to the union&#x27;s desire for someone with more experience in industrial and financial fields.

Nordmeyer later held a number of government appointments after retiring from parliament. In 1970 he was appointed chairman of the Freezing Industry Disputes Committee, an appointment which led to him becoming conciliator in several other industrial areas subsequently. In 1974 he was appointed chairman of the board of the New Zealand Superannuation Corporation which was the controlling organisation for the compulsory pension savings&#x27; scheme of the Third Labour Government (led by Kirk). The posting was short-lived however as the subsequent Third National Government were to abolish the commission after winning power the next year. He then became the chairman of Maui Development Ltd and also was a director of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

Nordmeyer was one of the staunchest opponents of capital punishment and was also staunchly opposed to abortion, being a patron of New Zealand&#x27;s main anti-abortion group Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (SPUC).

Nordmeyer died in Wellington on 2 February 1989, survived by his wife Frances and their two children. His family declined the offer of a state funeral instead opting to scatter his ashes by Lake Ōhau.

==Personal life==
Nordmeyer married Frances Maria Kernahan in Oamaru on 28 October 1931. The couple had two children, Alan and Alison. Alison married Labour MP Jim Edwards. In the 1989 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Lady Nordmeyer was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for community service. Nordmeyer was a teetotaller and did not smoke.

==Honours and recognition==
In the 1970 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, for services to politics. In the 1975 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George, for public services. On 6 February 1987, Nordmeyer was the fifth appointee to the Order of New Zealand.

<doc id="593977" wikidata="Q1210845" url="?curid=593977" title="Lake Burragorang">
<text>Lake Burragorang is a man-made reservoir in the lower Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia, serving as a major water supply for greater metropolitan Sydney. The dam impounding the lake, the Warragamba Dam, is located approximately southwest of the Sydney central business district.

Lake Burragorang is within the World Heritage Site of the Greater Blue Mountains Area. The reservoir collects water from the converged flows of the Coxs, Kowmung, Nattai, Wingecarribee, Wollondilly, and Warragamba rivers and their associated tributaries, all within the Nepean and Hawkesbury River catchment.

==Pre-lake history==

Before the construction of the dam, Burragorang Valley had been inhabited by white settlers since the 19th century, and for thousands of years before, the Burragorang valley was part of the tribal lands of the Gundungarra nation, an indigenous tribe that called the Burragorang valley, along with the Blue Mountains and Megalong Valley, their tribal land. A number of farming towns (including the town of Burragorang) and coal mines were located in the area. All of these are now underwater. Construction of Warragamba dam commenced in 1948 and was completed in 1960.

==Capacity==

The reservoir&#x27;s usable capacity is . Prior to April 2006, the usable capacity was , before the Deep Water Storage Recovery project was completed. There are fears, however, that population pressures may stretch the reservoir&#x27;s ability to furnish Sydney residents with needed water well into the 21st century. The city&#x27;s population is rising by about 50,000 every year. Water restrictions (limited usage purposes and times), were imposed late in 2003 and are reapplied during serious droughts, which are expected to become more frequent.

There have been times when the reservoir has become seriously depleted. On 8 February 2007 the lake recorded an all-time low of 32.5% of capacity, although by late 2008 the water level had returned to 60% of capacity. To reduce the likelihood of a water supply failure, the NSW Government authorised the construction and operation of the Sydney Desalination Plant to augment Sydney&#x27;s water supply.

The dam reached maximum capacity and spilled in March 2012, the first time it had done so in fourteen years. This is consistent with increasingly extreme weather events, where longer periods of drought and reduced total rainfall, is expected to be punctuated with shorter, heavier and more sporadic downfalls events.

In November 2019, government proposed a $700 million plan to raise the height of the dam by 14 metres. The purpose is stated as providing flood mitigation for downstream land. Critics have alleged it may be to allow rezoning of prime agricultural in the flood zone, to residential property for commercial developers. Increasing the capacity would result in flooding large areas of native wildlife habitat, in a relatively protected water catchment area. It would also flood large areas of native vegetation, that provides a substantial carbon dioxide sink, without proposal for replacement. The announcement was made while an application for concessions to extend mining operations inside the drinking water catchment areas, is under consideration. In the first week of December 2019, the water catchment area experienced large bush fires, during a widespread and extreme fire season in Eastern Australia.

==Public access==

Lake Burragorang is surrounded by a wide exclusion zone to protect the integrity of the water supply; access into this zone is restricted. There are two access corridors for bushwalkers: Coxs River to Mount Cookem, and Belloon Pass to Yerranderie. Limited public vehicle access is allowed on fire trail W4 from Sheahys Creek to Yerranderie.

==Power station==
A hydroelectric power station at Warragamba Dam begins operating once the level in the reservoir reaches to within of full capacity. Its output is . A long drought lasting 14 years resulted in the dam water level being insufficient for it to operate from 1998 to 2012. In 2016, late 2020 and each subsequent year, it has operated as the dam has spilled on multiple occasions.

<doc id="593987" wikidata="Q3437007" url="?curid=593987" title="Robertson, New South Wales">
<text>Robertson is a town in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, Australia, in Wingecarribee Shire. The town is located on the edge of an elevated plateau (the Illawarra escarpment) about from the coast.

Robertson is known for its high annual rainfall and fertile soil. It was previously covered by an extensive temperate rainforest, most of which has been cleared for farming though remnants such as Robertson Nature Reserve still exist. The town is colloquially known as &quot;Robbo&quot; by the locals.

The town is surrounded by lush pasture used for beef and dairy production. It was once famous for cheese production; its distance from, and poor transport to, the Sydney markets meant that in the early days fresh milk was not a viable industry and so the key dairy industries were butter and cheese. The remnants of the cheese industry are seen with one of the old cheese factories remaining in the town; it has been converted into a commercial row of shops. There is also the remnants of an old butter factory at the western end of town. Robertson is now more widely known for potato growing and is the home of the &quot;Big Potato&quot;. The Big Potato was built in the 1970s by a local potato grower. Robertson is also where the 1995 movie &quot;Babe&quot; was filmed.

==History==

Robertson is named after former Premier of New South Wales Sir John Robertson, whose 1861 Land Act cleared the way for the establishment of the town. Before then it was called &quot;Yarrawa Bush&quot;.

==Population==
According to the 2021 census, there were 2,017 people living in Robertson.

At the , Robertson and its surrounding area had a population of 1,865. 76.7% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 5.6%. 89.0% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 28.9%, Anglican 25.2% and Catholic 17.2%.

Though the date varies, the Robertson Show is often held between February and April on a Friday and Saturday of each year. There are many games and showcases during the two days it is held, with &quot;The Great Australian Potato Race&quot; occurring on Saturday, alongside the demolition derby and fireworks show at night.

In spring Robertson holds a spring festival, with local gardens open to the public.

== Attractions ==
===Robertson Hotel===
Robertson is home to the &quot;Robertson Hotel&quot;, a popular hotel and wedding venue. The hotel was originally built in 1924, opening as Hotel Robertson. It had a nine-hole golf course, two tennis courts, croquet, lawn bowls, billiards, fishing, hunting, horse riding, and an onsite mechanic who looked after guests&#x27; cars during their stay. The hotel won the &quot;Most luxurious hotel in the Commonwealth&quot; award in 1925, and was the first hotel in Australia to have phone lines to every room.

The hotel was built to draw some of the Sydneysiders, who in the past retreated to the cool climate of the Southern Highlands to escape the heat of a Sydney summer and enjoy the beauty of the countryside. It was a success and the developer went on to subdivide and develop the local area, less successfully.

In 1930 the hotel was sold and marketed as an exclusive country club and renamed Ranelagh Country Club after Ranelagh Gardens in London. However, the Great Depression made those plans short-lived.

In the buildup to World War II the hotel became a WAAAF training base, serving as a signals base and a training area for budding pilots. After World War II, the hotel was used as a hospice for returned pilots.

The building sold again in 1947 and became St Anthony&#x27;s College, a Franciscan friary and seminary; it was also used as a school and accommodation house run by the monks. It was during this period that the stained glass windows, rock walls and fountains were built. These are still in the building and around the gardens and grounds.

The hotel has its own railway platform, Moss Vale – Unanderra line, which is still used today.

In 1972 the monks moved to smaller premises in Campbelltown and the building returned to its original use as a hotel, named Ranelagh House.

The hotel was sold again in late 2007, and was renamed Fountaindale Grand Manor and Ranelagh Gardens, undergoing major renovations and refurbishments. Recently it was renamed to Robertson Hotel.

In 2022, the hotel played host to the Network 10 reality game show, &quot;The Traitors&quot; - during which the contestants stayed at the hotel while playing a murder-mystery-themed game styled similar to the party game &quot;Mafia&quot;. The show returned to the hotel for the second season in 2023.

===Illawarra Fly===
On 15 March 2008, the Illawarra Fly Tree Top Walk opened to the public. It is similar to the Otway Fly, in Victoria. It is perched on the Illawarra escarpment at Knights Hill, located east of Robertson. The tree top walk is joined with an observation outdoor tower with views of Wollongong.

===The Big Potato===
Built in 1977 by local potato grower and shire councillor Jim Mauger from local soil mixed with cement, the Big Potato originally sat alone in a bare field. It was modelled on the Sebago potato and is approximately . Originally it was intended to house a museum or kiosk, but this never happened. The Big Potato, alone in its field, appears in the 1990s classic film &quot;Babe&quot;. 

During the International Year of the Potato in 2008, volunteers from the community led by Judy and Allan Hollis decided to refurbish the potato and the landscape around it. Over time they raised funds to erect picnic benches, and local nurseries pitched in with donations of plants and their labour. Artist Ben Quilty even helped plant some daffodils. 

In 2012 Mauger said that he was forced to sell the land because of rising rates that he could not afford, as the land on which it sits is zoned for commercial use. The parents of playwright and journalist Melanie Tait, who grew up in Robertson, bought the land and the potato, as it lay adjacent to their supermarket. Her father, Neil who was 62 at the time, raised a mortgage on the land, to save his business as well as the Big Potato. According to Melanie, Neil loves the Big Potato. In September 2022, the Tait family sold the land. When Melanie announced the news on Twitter, her friends responded with some witty puns, such as &quot;This news has mashed me up. I&#x27;m wedged between joy and sadness. Is there no way we could hash this out? Perhaps if we all chip in?&quot;.

The Big Potato became a source of amusement across Australia from the beginning. It has been dubbed &quot;big turd&quot; by some, and in 2010 vandals created a face on it by sticking on eyes, nose, and mouth made out of papier-mâché. It has featured in the arts and popular culture several times, including:
*1997: Featured in the feature film &quot;Babe&quot;
*2021: Voted Australia&#x27;s &quot;Shittest Big Thing&quot; in a public vote held by &quot;Shit Towns of Australia&quot;
*2022: Filming of a scene in Apple TV show ROAR, with Nicole Kidman and Judy Davis
*2022: Featured on Channel Ten show &quot;The Living Room&quot;
*2023: Featured in the feature film &quot;The Appleton Ladies&#x27; Potato Race&quot;, based on Melanie Tait&#x27;s play of the same name

== Transport ==

Robertson was served by a railway station on the Unanderra–Moss Vale railway line. The railway line is mainly used for freight. East Coast Heritage Rail operates its Cockatoo Run train on a monthly basis across the line from Sydney to Moss Vale and return (via Wollongong). Other heritage trains sometimes use the line, however no regular passenger services are present on the line.

NSW TrainLink buses travel along the Illawarra Highway, linking the Southern Highlands to Wollongong. The Illawarra Highway winds down the escarpment via the Macquarie Pass. Robertson would be impacted by an upgrade or replacement to Macquarie Pass. Despite some Illawarra and Highland residents strongly supporting an improvement to the link between Robertson and Albion Park, no government has shown any interest in such a project.

==Facilities and services==
The Robertson Rural Fire Brigade has been officially active since 5 February 1939, but is believed to have been formed by local people on 14 January, in response to catastrophic bushfires at that time.

== Heritage listings ==
Robertson has a number of heritage-listed sites, including the Wingecarribee Swamp.

<doc id="593995" wikidata="Q419197" url="?curid=593995" title="Nickeline">
<text>Nickeline or niccolite is the mineral form of nickel arsenide. The naturally-occurring mineral contains roughly 43.9% nickel and 56.1% arsenic by mass, but composition of the mineral may vary slightly.

Small quantities of sulfur, iron and cobalt are usually present, and sometimes the arsenic is largely replaced by antimony. This last forms an isomorphous series with breithauptite (nickel antimonide).

== Etymology and history ==
Medieval miners looking for copper in the German Ore Mountains would sometimes find a red mineral, superficially resembling copper ore. Upon attempting extraction, no copper was produced, and subsequently, the miners would be afflicted with mysterious illness. They blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology, Nickel (similar to &quot;Old Nick&quot;) for besetting the copper (German: Kupfer). This German equivalent of &quot;copper-nickel&quot; was used as early as 1694 (other old German synonyms are &quot;Rotnickelkies&quot; and &quot;Arsennickel&quot;).

In 1751, Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt was attempting to extract copper from kupfernickel mineral, and obtained instead a white metal which he named &quot;nickel&quot;, after the sprite. In modern German, Kupfernickel and Kupfer-Nickel designates the alloy Cupronickel.

The names subsequently given to the ore, &quot;nickeline&quot; from F. S. Beudant, 1832, and &quot;niccolite,&quot; from J. D. Dana, 1868, refer to the presence of nickel; in Latin, &quot;niccolum.&quot;

In 1971, the International Mineralogical Association recommended use of the name nickeline rather than niccolite.

== Occurrence ==
Nickeline is formed by hydrothermal modification of ultramafic rocks and associated ore deposits, and may be formed by replacement of nickel-copper bearing sulfides (replacing pentlandite, and in association with copper arsenic sulfides), or via metasomatism of sulfide-free ultramafic rocks, where metasomatic fluids introduce sulfur, carbonate, and arsenic. This typically results in mineral assemblages including millerite, heazelwoodite and metamorphic pentlandite-pyrite via sulfidation and associated arsenopyrite-nickeline-breithauptite.
Associated minerals include: arsenopyrite, barite, silver, cobaltite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, breithauptite and maucherite. Nickeline alters to annabergite (a coating of green nickel arsenate) on exposure to moist air.

Most of these minerals can be found in the areas surrounding Sudbury and Cobalt, Ontario. Other localities include the eastern flank of the Widgiemooltha Dome, Western Australia, from altered pentlndite-pyrite-pyrrhotite assemblages within the Mariners, Redross and Miitel nickel mines where nickeline is produced by regional Au-As-Ag-bearing alteration and carbonate metasomatism. Other occurrences include within similarly modified nickel mines of the Kambalda area.

== Crystal structure ==

The unit cell of nickeline is used as the prototype of a group of crystalline solids with similar crystal structures. The structure consists of two interpenetrating sublattices: a primitive hexagonal nickel sublattice and a hexagonal close-packed arsenic sublattice. Each nickel atom is octahedrally coordinated to six arsenic atoms, while each arsenic atom is trigonal prismatically coordinated to six nickel atoms. Compounds adopting the NiAs structure are generally the chalcogenides, arsenides, antimonides and bismuthides of transition metals. 
The following are the members of the nickeline group:
*Achavalite: 
*Breithauptite: 
*Freboldite: 
*Kotulskite: 
*Langistite: 
*Nickeline: 
*Sobolevskite: 
*Sudburyite: 

== Economic importance ==
Nickeline is rarely used as a source of nickel due to the presence of arsenic, which is deleterious to most smelting and milling techniques. When nickel sulfide ore deposits have been altered to produce nickeline, often the presence of arsenic renders the ore uneconomic when concentrations of As reach several hundred parts per million. However, arsenic bearing nickel ore may be treated by blending with &#x27;clean&#x27; ore sources, to produce a blended feedstock which the mill and smelter can handle with acceptable recovery.

The primary problem for treating nickeline in conventionally constructed nickel mills is the specific gravity of nickeline versus that of pentlandite. This renders the ore difficult to treat via the froth flotation technique. Within the smelter itself, the nickeline contributes to high arsenic contents which require additional reagents and fluxes to strip from the nickel metal.

<text>The Elizabeth Islands are a chain of over 20 small islands extending southwest from the southern coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts in the United States. They are located at the outer edge of Buzzards Bay, north of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, from which they are separated by Vineyard Sound, and constitute the town of Gosnold in Dukes County, Massachusetts.

==History==

The island&#x27;s creation was caused by different gravels and soils entombed inside of glaciers. The glacial movement deposited much material as they melted, thus many small islands were formed.

The islands were long known to and utilized by the Wampanoag and other indigenous peoples before European colonization. They utilized the islands for hunting and fishing. The Indigenous name, Pocutohhunkunnoh, meaning Lands End, was the inspiration for the name Cuttyhunk Island.

Europeans first learned of the islands in 1602 when the English colonizer Bartholomew Gosnold sighted them on his way to Virginia. For three weeks, they built shelter and rested on the islands. However, it was not until 1641, subsequent to the successful establishment of the first English North American colonies, that colonizers formally laid claim to and settled the islands in the name of the English Crown as part of the country&#x27;s nascent imperial expansion. At this time they renamed the islands after Elizabeth I, who had been Queen of England when the islands had first been discovered by Europeans. They named Cuttyhunk Elizabeth&#x27;s Isle. King James the First gave the islands to the Council of New England because he did not care to have them. In 1641, Thomas Mayhew the Elder, of Watertown, Massachusetts, bought the islands—along with Nantucket and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard—from William Alexander, the Earl of Stirling. James Bowdoin and his family owned the islands for over 100 years beginning in the 1700s. Finally the islands were bought by the Forbes family in the 1800s.

Before the creation of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691, the islands were part of the extinct Dukes County, New York. The first known European inhabitant was Francis Usselton, who had been banished at the time for making secret trades with the local Indians without consent from the governor.

Since the mid-1800s, the Forbes family, in the form of a family trust, own much of the island&#x27;s property.
==Geography and demographics==
The total land area of the islands is 34.55 km² (13.34 sq mi); and there was a permanent population of 75 persons as of the 2010 census, making it the smallest town in Massachusetts.

=== Named islands ===
All of the Elizabeth Islands, except Cuttyhunk and Penikese, are privately owned by the Forbes family. However, the Forbes family have other beaches open for public access including: Weepecket, Kettle Cove, West End Beach, Quicks Hole and Tarpaulin Cove.

Stretching south-west from land&#x27;s end at Falmouth, Massachusetts, the islands are:
*Nonamesset Island, the closest to the mainland. On the northern end of the island, boats can anchor in Hadley Harbor even though the island is off limits to the public. Boats will often also anchor on the outer harbor due to crowds.
*Veckatimest, a small island. The band Grizzly Bear named one of their albums off the island.
*Gull Island, a small uninhabited island.
*Uncatena Island, uninhabited as of the 2000 Census. The island is owned by the Forbes Family and is private. In the early 20th century a sidewheeler steamer ferry used the island&#x27;s name in theirs, Sidewheeler Uncatena. The ferry took people between New Bedford, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and Nantucket and was the last of its kind.
*Naushon Island, long and the largest. Composed of the main island along with the smaller Nonamesset, Monohansett, Bull, Cedar, and Bachelor islands. Owned by the Forbes&#x27; Naushon Island Trust, and while it is not generally open to the public, the Forbes family has set aside Tarpaulin Cove to the south and Kettle Cove to the north as well as Bull Island and Hadley Harbor to the northeast for public enjoyment including picknicking. 
*The Weepecket Islands, three small, publicly accessible islands north of central Naushon owned by the Forbes family. These islands offer very few places to land, are nearly obscured by water, and are home to numerous shore birds, seals and other animals.
*Pasque Island, long, owned by a subset of the Forbes family, and covered in poison ivy. A shallow tidal creek cuts part way through the island.
*Nashawena Island, long, owned by another subset of the Forbes family, it has grazing livestock.
*Baret Island, located off the north shore of Nashawena Island.
*Rock Island, located off the north shore of Nashawena Island.
*Penikese Island, located about north of Nashawena and Cuttyhunk. Penikese is owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and has a colorful history. It was the site of a groundbreaking 19th-century research facility that was the precursor to the famed Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, was the site of the state&#x27;s only leper colony in the early 20th century, and is currently a bird sanctuary and site of the Penikese Island School, a 35-year-old school for troubled teens.
*Cuttyhunk Island, farthest west in the chain, and home to most of Gosnold&#x27;s municipal population. Like Penikese, Cuttyhunk is not owned by the Forbes family, and therefore much of the island is publicly accessible.
*Gosnold Island, located in Westend Pond on Cuttyhunk Island.

=== Named channels ===

Channels with strong tidal currents, known locally as &quot;holes&quot;, separate the islands from each other and the mainland. Currents of up to are driven by the different sizes and filling rates of Vineyard Sound to the southeast and Buzzards Bay to the northwest. At high tide, water flows from Buzzards Bay to the Vineyard Sound. Near mid-tide the water stops and reverses, filling the Bay at low tide.

Listed from northeast to southwest, the named channels are:
*Woods Hole separating the mainland from Nonamesset Island
*Robinson&#x27;s Hole between Naushon Island and Pasque Island
*Quick&#x27;s Hole between Pasque Island and Nashawena Island
*Canapitsit Channel between Nashawena Island and Cuttyhunk Island.

=== Named harbors and coves ===
*Cuttyhunk Harbor is sheltered on its east by Nashawena Island on its west by Cuttyhunk Island and on its north by Penikese Island.
*Tarpaulin Cove is on the south shore of Naushon Island. The cove includes a public beach protected by the Naushon Island Trust.
*Hadley Harbor is located near Woods Hole and is made up of surrounding islands owned by the Naushon Trust. The only place visitors are allowed to land is Bull Island.

== Wildlife ==
There are many bluefish and striped bass found in the waters near all the islands. The stripers are drawn in by the rocky coastline of the islands. The abundance of different fish also brings in many different kinds of birds that can easily find pods of topwater fish.

* Stripers, or striped bass are popular gamefish in America. They are drawn to the underdeveloped coastlines and low levels of disturbance. 
* Bluefish, which are fish that live along the east coast, are also found near the islands. 
* Cattle are found on the islands of Nashawena and Naushon. 
* Harbor Seals, Grey Seals, and Harp Seals are all found on the islands and in the waters between the islands. The seals can be seen on the sandbar called Gull Island at low tide.
* Deer are found on many of the islands because they swim over from the mainland. They are also known to swim to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard when food is scarce.

== Recreation ==

=== Sightseeing ===
There are many different sights to see across the islands. Some of the most popular include Nashawena Island’s Highland Cattle, Tarpaulin Cove Lighthouse, Gay Head Cliffs, the Naval Lookout Point on Cuttyhunk, and a plethora of wildlife.

=== Bird watching ===
There are many birds found on Cuttyhunk who are the first birds migrating north in the spring and the last going south in the winter. This is because it is the last or first landmass in the bay. There are wildlife habitats located on Penikese Island that people visit to observe the birds.

=== Activities ===
On many of the public beaches and islands, it is popular to stop for a few hours and set up a picnic. People are also found snorkeling and swimming in the oceans around many of the islands.

<doc id="593999" wikidata="Q1133098" url="?curid=593999" title="Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign">
<text>Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Southern Campaign, also known as the War of Pacification in Nanzhong, was a military campaign which took place in 225 during the early Three Kingdoms period (220–280) of China. It was led by Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of the state of Shu Han, against opposing forces in the Nanzhong region (covering parts of present-day Yunnan, Guizhou and southern Sichuan). The campaign was a response to rebellions started by local governors in the Nanzhong region and intrusions by the Nanman (literally: &quot;southern barbarians&quot;).

==Background==
In October 222, Liu Bei, the founding emperor of Shu, lost the Battle of Xiaoting against Shu&#x27;s ally-turned-rival state Wu. He died in Baidicheng (in present-day Fengjie County, Chengdu) in June 223.

===Yong Kai&#x27;s rebellion===
Yong Kai (雍闓), a descendant of Yong Chi (雍齒) and an official active in the Nanzhong region, heard about Liu Bei&#x27;s death and started a rebellion against Shu rule. He killed Zheng Ang (正昂), the Shu-appointed Administrator of Jianning Commandery (建寧郡; around present-day Qujing, Yunnan), and took Zheng Ang&#x27;s successor Zhang Yi hostage. The Shu general Li Yan wrote a total of six letters to Yong Kai to dissuade him from rebelling, but Yong Kai arrogantly replied: &quot;I heard that the sky cannot have two suns and the land cannot have two rulers. Now, from a distance away, I see that the Empire has been divided into three, so I am fearful and confused and do not know whom to pledge allegiance to.&quot;

Under urging from Shi Xie and the Wu general Bu Zhi, Yong Kai agreed to pledge allegiance to Wu and he sent Zhang Yi as a captive to the Wu emperor Sun Quan to express his sincerity. In return, Sun Quan appointed him as the Administrator of Yongchang Commandery (永昌郡; covering parts of present-day western Yunnan), which was then guarded by the Shu officials Lü Kai and Wang Kang (王伉). When Yong Kai showed up to take control of Yongchang, Lü Kai and Wang Kang refused to recognise his legitimacy and led both the local government and civilians alike to resist Yong Kai and prevent him from entering Yongchang. Yong Kai then repeatedly wrote letters to them in an attempt to convince them that he was the rightful Administrator, but Lü Kai refuted Yong Kai&#x27;s claims and managed to retain control over Yongchang because the people of Yongchang highly regarded and trusted him.

===Rebellions by Gao Ding and Zhu Bao===
Around 223, as Shu was still mourning Liu Bei&#x27;s death, Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor and regent of Shu, decided to focus on domestic policy to promote stability and accumulate resources before using military force to quell the uprisings in the Nanzhong region. At the same time, he also sent Deng Zhi and Chen Zhen as diplomats to Wu to meet Sun Quan and convince him to make peace with Shu and rebuild the Shu–Wu alliance against their rival state, Wei.

In the meantime, Gao Ding (高定; or Gao Dingyuan 高定元), the chief of the Sou tribe (叟族) in Yuexi/Yuesui Commandery (越巂郡; around present-day Xichang, Sichuan) heard about Yong Kai&#x27;s rebellion and decided to join, so he killed Jiao Huang (焦璜), the Administrator of Yuexi/Yuesui appointed by the Shu government. While Zhuge Liang was planning for a military campaign against the rebels, he appointed Gong Lu as the new Administrator of Yuexi/Yuesui and sent him there to make preparations in advance. However, Gong Lu ended up being killed by Gao Ding.

Around the same time, Zhuge Liang also sent an official, Qi Xing (頎行), to conduct an investigation in Zangke Commandery (牂柯郡; around present-day Guiyang or Fuquan, Guizhou). Upon arriving in Zangke, Qi Xing detained all the lower-ranked officials for questioning. Zhu Bao (朱褒), the Shu-appointed Administrator (太守) of Zangke, had heard of the rebellions in the neighbouring Jianning and Yuexi/Yuesui commanderies, so he killed Qi Xing and joined the rebels.

===Involvement of Meng Huo and the Nanman===
After failing to capture Yongchang Commandery from Lü Kai and Wang Kang, Yong Kai turned to the Nanman tribes for help but they were unwilling to listen to him. Yong Kai then sought help from Meng Huo, a local leader with much influence and popularity among the Nanman. Meng Huo lied to the Nanman that Shu&#x27;s government had made unreasonable demands from them and successfully incited them to rebel against Shu&#x27;s rule.

==Pacifying Nanzhong==
In the spring of 225, after Shu rebuilt its alliance with Wu against their rival state Wei, Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of Shu, personally led Shu imperial forces south to pacify the Nanzhong region and quell the rebellions. Wang Lian, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s chief clerk, attempted to dissuade him from participating in the campaign, but Zhuge Liang insisted because he was worried that the Shu generals might not be competent enough to deal with the rebels on their own.

Ma Su, a close aide of Zhuge Liang, suggested that they focus on psychological warfare (i.e. winning the hearts of the people in Nanzhong) rather than conventional warfare, so as to prevent rebellions from breaking out again. Zhuge Liang readily accepted Ma Su&#x27;s advice.

The Shu emperor Liu Shan awarded Zhuge Liang a ceremonial axe and held a grand ceremony to see him off on the campaign: attendants bearing parasols made of feathers walked in front of and behind him, an entourage of 60 &quot;huben&quot; imperial guards escorted him, while drums rolled and trumpets blared in the background.

The Shu army travelled along a water route from Anshang County (安上縣; present-day Pingshan County, Sichuan) to Yuexi/Yuesui Commandery and entered the Nanzhong region. In response, Gao Ding and Yong Kai constructed several forts in Maoniu (旄牛; present-day Hanyuan County, Sichuan), Dingze (定筰; present-day Yanyuan County, Sichuan) and Beishui (卑水; southeast of present-day Zhaojue County, Sichuan) counties. Zhuge Liang then led the Shu army to Beishui County, where he hoped the rebels would converge so that he could defeat all of them in one battle. During this time, Gao Ding&#x27;s subordinate(s) killed Yong Kai. Zhuge Liang then used the opportunity to strike back and defeated Gao Ding. Gao Ding was subsequently captured and executed by beheading on the orders of Zhuge Liang.

Zhuge Liang then ordered Ma Zhong to lead troops southeast from Bodao County (僰道縣; present-day Yibin, Sichuan) to attack Zangke Commandery, and Li Hui to lead troops southwest from Pingyi County (平夷縣; northeast of present-day Bijie, Guizhou) to attack Jianning Commandery. When Li Hui reached Kunming, he lost contact with Zhuge Liang and ended up being surrounded by the rebels, who had twice as many men as he did. Li Hui then lied to the rebels, saying that he actually wanted to join them. Just as the rebels believed him and lowered their guard, he used the opportunity to strike back and move south to Panjiang (槃江) to meet up with Ma Zhong, who had just defeated Zhu Bao&#x27;s rebel forces and recaptured Zangke. Ma Zhong and Li Hui&#x27;s units rendezvoused with Zhuge Liang&#x27;s main army and prepared to attack Meng Huo, who incorporated the remnants of the rebel forces into his own.

Zhuge Liang knew that Meng Huo was popular and respected among the locals in the Nanzhong region, so he wanted to let him live. After Meng Huo was captured, Zhuge Liang showed him around the Shu camp and asked him what he thought. Meng Huo replied: &quot;Before this, I knew nothing about your army, which was why I lost. Now that you have shown me around your camp, I know the conditions of your army and will be able to defeat you easily.&quot; Zhuge Liang laughed, released him and allowed him to return for another battle. The same cycle repeated for a total of seven times. On the seventh time, Meng Huo surrendered and told Zhuge Liang: &quot;Sir, you have shown me Heaven&#x27;s might. The people of the south will never rebel again.&quot; Zhuge Liang then led his forces towards Dian Lake in triumph.

==Aftermath==
After pacifying the four commanderies of Yizhou (益州; a.k.a. Jianning 建寧), Yongchang (永昌), Zangke (牂柯) and Yuexi/Yuesui (越巂), Zhuge Liang reformed the administrative divisions to create another two commanderies, Yunnan (雲南) and Xinggu (興古), to improve the quality of the local governments in the Nanzhong region. He wanted to allow the people to self-govern those lands instead of appointing non-locals as the governors. He pointed out the problems with leaving non-locals in charge: The people in Nanzhong had recently lost their loved ones in the battles and might still harbour bitter feelings towards the Shu government; if they had non-locals to govern them, they might feel even more resentful and choose to rebel again; if non-locals were put in charge, the Shu government would need to station troops in the area to protect them.

Before completely withdrawing all Shu soldiers from the Nanzhong region, Zhuge Liang told Meng Huo and the other local leaders that he only required them to pay tribute to the Shu government in the form of gold, silver, oxen, warhorses, etc. He appointed locals such as Li Hui (from Jianning Commandery) and Lü Kai (from Yongchang Commandery) as commandery administrators. These commandery administrators were different from their predecessors in the sense that they only served as representatives of the Shu government in the region; the locals were governed by their respective local leaders and tribal chiefs.

More than ten thousand families of the Qiang (羌) tribes along with other strong foreigners from Nanzhong clans were relocated deeper into the Shu region and reorganized into five divisions. Since no enemy could resist them, they were nicknamed the &quot;Flying Army&quot; (無當飛軍). The rest of the foreigners were divided under the great clans of Nanzhong, those were: Jiao (焦), Yong (雍), Lou (婁), Cuan (爨), Meng (孟), Liang (量), Mao (毛) and Li (李). Furthermore, they were put under the command of the &quot;Five Commandants&quot; (五部) also called the &quot;Five Lords&quot; (五子). The people of Nanzhong referred to them as the &quot;Four Clans&quot; (四姓) and the &quot;Five Lords&quot; (五子).

Since many among the foreigners didn&#x27;t want to serve under them or enrich these great clans. The local prefects puts forward the policy to commerce with them gold and silk. Also, encourage trading to persuade those people to develop themselves as family division with many among them securing important hereditary positions. This policy motivates the tribal people to gather rare resources and progressively brought them under the control of the Han government until they became Han subjects.

After his campaign, Zhuge Liang recruited many talented individuals among the foreign leaders such as Cuan Xi (爨習) of Jianning Commandery, Meng Yan (孟琰) of Zhuti Commandery and Meng Huo who became his subordinates. Cuan Xi’s highest office was General Who Commands The Army (領軍將軍), Meng Yan was General Who Supports the Han (輔漢將軍) while Meng Huo was Assistant to the Imperial Counsellor (御史中丞).

Many resources were taken from Nanzhong such as gold, silver, cinnabar and lacquer while plow oxen and war horses were used to support the army and the State. Moreover, the commanders often recruited soldiers among the local people.

The people in Nanzhong never rebelled against Shu rule again for as long as Zhuge Liang was still alive. Historical books show that there were occasional revolts in this area. However, the rebellion in the region was quelled at the local government level appointed by Zhuge Liang, unlike before. In addition, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s expedition was generally successful, given the record that local influential people who were cooperative with Shu Han stabilized the area and provided Shu Han with abundant supplies and manpower.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Although historical records mentioned that Zhuge Liang captured and released Meng Huo a total of seven times throughout the campaign, no details were provided. The 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period, spends a total of about four-and-a-half chapters (87 to 91) fleshing out the details of each of the seven battles. It includes numerous fictional characters associated with Meng Huo, such as Lady Zhurong (Meng Huo&#x27;s wife), Meng You (Meng Huo&#x27;s brother) and other Nanman chieftains such as King Mulu and King Duosi. Apart from this, in the novel, the Shu generals Zhao Yun, Wei Yan and Ma Dai actively participate in the campaign, even though historically there is no mention about their involvement.

# First battle: Zhao Yun leads his troops to attack Meng Huo and defeats his army. Wei Yan captures Meng Huo and brings him before Zhuge Liang. When Meng Huo complains that he was captured through trickery, Zhuge Liang releases him and allows him to return for another battle.
# Second battle: Meng Huo builds a series of fortifications across a river and taunts the Shu forces to attack him. Ma Dai cuts off his supply route and kills Jinhuan Sanjie, Meng Huo&#x27;s subordinate who was protecting the river fortifications. Ahuinan and Dongtuna, two of Meng Huo&#x27;s subordinates, betray their master, capture him and hand him over as a prisoner to Zhuge Liang. Like before, Meng Huo complains that he did not had a chance to fight the enemy fair and square. Zhuge Liang then shows him around the Shu camp before releasing him.
# Third battle: Meng Huo&#x27;s younger brother Meng You pretends to surrender to Zhuge Liang and promises to lure Meng Huo into a trap. However, Zhuge Liang knows it is a ploy so he also pretends to play along, captures both of them in the trap, and releases them again.
# Fourth battle: When Meng Huo hears that the Shu army is planning to retreat, he gathers all his troops and attacks the Shu camp. He falls into the pit traps in the camp and ends up being captured again. Zhuge Liang releases him once more.
# Fifth battle: Meng Huo, having learnt his lesson from his previous defeats, adopts a more defensive stance. He lures the Shu forces into the poisonous marshes around the caves of his ally, King Duosi. However, Zhuge Liang manages to avoid the dangers of the marshes with the help of Meng Jie, Meng Huo&#x27;s elder brother who does not participate in Meng Huo&#x27;s rebellion against Shu. The Shu forces then defeat and kill King Duosi and capture Meng Huo again. Like before, Zhuge Liang releases Meng Huo again.
# Sixth battle: Meng Huo&#x27;s wife Lady Zhurong joins the battle and captures the Shu generals Ma Zhong and Zhang Ni. Ma Dai defeats Lady Zhurong later and captures her. Zhuge Liang releases Lady Zhurong in exchange for Ma Zhong and Zhang Ni. Meng Huo then turns to his ally King Mulu for help. King Mulu has the ability to control wild animals and direct them in battle. However, the Shu army is prepared for this and they use fire-breathing contraptions (referred to as juggernauts in some translations) to scare away the animals. King Mulu is killed in battle and Meng Huo ends up being captured again, but Zhuge Liang releases him once more.
# Seventh battle: Meng Huo turns to another ally, Wutugu, for help. Wutugu&#x27;s soldiers wear a special type of armour made of rattan which can deflect sharp blades and arrows. Zhuge Liang comes up with a plan for Wei Yan to lure Wutugu and his army into a trap in a valley, where explosives and fire traps have been set. The flammable rattan armour catches fire easily and Wutugu and his army completely perish in the valley. Meng Huo is captured once more. This time, he feels ashamed of himself and decides to surrender to Zhuge Liang and swear allegiance to Shu for the rest of his life.

==In popular culture==
A popular legend tells of how Zhuge Liang invented the &quot;mantou&quot;, a kind of steamed bun, during this campaign. It probably rose from the fact that the name &quot;mantou&quot; () is homonymous with &quot;mantou&quot; (). The story tells that, on the way back after the campaign, Zhuge Liang and the Shu army came to a swift-flowing river which defied all attempts to cross it. Locals informed him that he must sacrifice 50 men and throw their heads into the river to appease the river deity, who will then allow them to cross. As Zhuge Liang did not want to cause further bloodshed, he ordered buns shaped roughly like human heads – round with a flat base – to be made and thrown into the river. After a successful crossing, he named the bun &quot;barbarian&#x27;s head&quot;, which evolved into the present-day &quot;mantou&quot;.

<doc id="594001" wikidata="Q4827531" url="?curid=594001" title="Avalon, Victoria">
<text>Avalon (post code: 3212) is a locality situated north east of Geelong, Victoria. Its local government area is the City of Greater Geelong and its Ward is Windermere. It is located on the northern shore of Corio Bay to the southwest of the state&#x27;s capital city of Melbourne.

==Economy==
Avalon is notable for Avalon Airport, which is the site of the biennial Australian International Airshow, the largest of its kind in the southern hemisphere. Although located on the outskirts of Geelong, the airport effectively operates as a second airport for the much larger city of Melbourne.

In 2005, businessman Lindsay Fox launched plans to attract Australia&#x27;s first Disneyland theme park to the area.

When established in 2004, Jetstar had its headquarters on the grounds of Avalon Airport in Avalon, but has since relocated to the Melbourne central business district.

Major industry in the area includes a factory producing concrete railway sleepers, and the Cheetham Saltworks.

==History==
Avalon State School opened on 7 June 1913 and closed on 6 March 1950. The land was later resumed by the Commonwealth Government for the airport, while the building and residence were moved to Corio Primary School.

== Climate ==
==Population==
In the 2016 Census, there were 293 people in Avalon. 69.9% of people were born in Australia and 71.7% of people only spoke English at home. The most common response for religion was No Religion at 48.7%.

==Recreation==

Avalon Raceway is a dirt track racing venue located in the area.

In 2010 the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport was granted funding for a feasibility study to build a world class motorsports facility in the area, with the $200 million race circuit intended to become the home of the Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix after the contract to host the race at Albert Park expired in 2015. However this did not eventuate. In April 2023 the Government of Victoria announced it intended to build a new motorsport complex in Avalon.

<doc id="594003" wikidata="Q2605189" url="?curid=594003" title="David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech">
<text>William David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech (20 May 1918 – 26 January 1985), known as David Ormsby-Gore until June 1961 and as Sir David Ormsby-Gore from then until February 1964, was a British diplomat and Conservative politician.

==Early life==
William David Ormsby-Gore was born into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family on 20 May 1918 in Westminster, London, the second son of William Ormsby-Gore, 4th Baron Harlech, a Conservative politician, and Lady Beatrice Edith Mildred Gascoyne-Cecil. His maternal great-grandfather was British Prime Minister The 3rd Marquess of Salisbury. He was educated at St Cyprian&#x27;s School, Eton College and New College, Oxford.

A well-known story told of him at Eton is that, when a boy in his house killed himself, the housemaster called the boys together, and asked if any of them had any idea why this should have happened. Ormsby-Gore put up his hand and asked, &quot;Please sir, could it have been the food?&quot;

In 1939, he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery (Berkshire Yeomanry Field Regiment), served in the &#x27;Phantom&#x27; reconnaissance unit, and worked with airborne and other special units. By the end of the War, he held the rank of major on the general staff.

After the war, his father handed over to him all his land, and Ormsby-Gore farmed the 400 acres (1.6 km2) of the Woodhill Estate, Oswestry, Shropshire. In 1948, he was commissioned a Major in the Shropshire Yeomanry, but left in 1950.

==Career==
===Member of Parliament===
At the 1950 general election, he was elected Member of Parliament for Oswestry, which he remained until 1961. Under Prime Minister Anthony Eden he served briefly, from November 1956 to January 1957, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; and under Prime Minister Harold Macmillan he was from 1957 to 1961 Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. After the election of U.S. President John F. Kennedy he was appointed British Ambassador to the United States on 18 October 1961. This meant that he had to take the Chiltern Hundreds on 1 June, so that he could resign from the House.

===Ambassador to the United States===
Ormsby-Gore knew Kennedy well from his time in London, where his father Joseph P. Kennedy had served as American Ambassador. Like Macmillan, Ormsby-Gore was distantly related to Kennedy, but had a closer relationship than did Macmillan with the President-elect and his brother Robert. Six months after Kennedy took office Ormsby-Gore was in Washington, D.C. Referred to under the Kennedy administration as &quot;our kind of Ambassador&quot;, he supplied Kennedy with a stream of advice and Cuban cigars via his diplomatic bag. He was almost a resident at the White House, being more a friend of the family than a mere ambassador. After President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination there were rumours of a romance between Ormsby-Gore and Jacqueline Kennedy. In 1968 he proposed marriage to her, but, she did not accept. Ormsby-Gore was one of the pallbearers at Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s funeral along with Robert McNamara, John Glenn, W. Averell Harriman, C. Douglas Dillon, Kirk Lemoyne Billings (schoolmate of John F. Kennedy), Stephen Edward Smith (husband to Jean Ann Kennedy), David Hackett, Jim Whittaker and John Seigenthaler. Under the Lyndon B. Johnson administration relations were more formal but remained excellent; and Ormsby-Gore maintained his position after the Labour government took power in Britain in 1964.

A fierce opponent of oil-barrel politics, Ormsby-Gore&#x27;s terse dismissal of the phenomenon ran: &quot;It would indeed be a tragedy if the history of the human race proved to be nothing more than the story of an ape playing with a box of matches on a petrol dump.&quot; The extent of his influence over the Kennedy administration is disputed. Unable to persuade the American government to agree with the British line over Yemen and the Congo, or to proceed with either a negotiated settlement with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev over Berlin or the Skybolt ballistic missile programme, he nevertheless played a significant role in the Cuban Missile Crisis and ensured that Britain&#x27;s views were taken into account by the American government.

The friendships of Ormsby-Gore and Macmillan with John F. Kennedy helped secure the first Test-Ban Treaty in 1963. Macmillan and Ormsby-Gore had been attempting to achieve a test-ban treaty with the Russians for the past ten years, and won Kennedy over through letters from Macmillan and frank discussions between Ormsby-Gore and Kennedy. They persuaded him to act like a statesman and conclude Test-ban treaties with Russia and not fear being branded as an appeaser by political opponents in the United States.

Ormsby-Gore was a participant in what is referred to as a &quot;twenty-five year conversation to do with the role of a leader in a democratic society&quot;. He encouraged Kennedy to remain focused on issues relevant to the world and the future, rather than attempting to protect himself politically.

According to the Duchess of Devonshire, who travelled with the British delegation to Kennedy&#x27;s funeral in November 1963, Macmillan&#x27;s successor as Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home had wanted to appoint Ormsby-Gore as Foreign Secretary, but R. A. Butler had insisted on having this post as a condition of serving under Home. After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Ormsby-Gore became involved in a relationship with his widow Jacqueline, going on vacation with her in Cambodia. He proposed marriage to her in 1967 and was turned down. In 1968, when she married the Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, Lord Harlech was opposed and wrote to her asking her to change her mind.

===Later life===
Ormsby-Gore retired as ambassador in 1965, a year after his father died, and took his seat in the House of Lords as Lord Harlech, briefly also holding the position of deputy chairman of the Conservative Party. He also had a successful career as a television executive, founding HTV, and served as president of the British Board of Film Classification. He had an active interest in the avant-garde, and for nearly ten years, beginning in 1969, was patron of the Institute for Research in Art and Technology. In 1971–1972, he was a deputy chairman of the Pearce Commission. In 1972, with actor Stanley Baker, Harlech staged a four-day festival near Lincoln.

==Personal life==
On 9 February 1940, Lord Harlech married Sylvia Lloyd Thomas (1920–1967) daughter of Hugh Lloyd Thomas, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to France between 1935 and 1938, and Guendaline Ada Bellew. Before Lady Harlech&#x27;s death in an automobile accident on 30 May 1967, they had five children:
* Julian Hugh Ormsby-Gore (1940–1974), who died of gunshot wounds, an apparent suicide.
* Jane Teresa Denyse Ormsby-Gore (b. 1942), who was said to have had an affair with Mick Jagger during the 1960s; some consider the Rolling Stones song &quot;Lady Jane&quot; to be about her. She married Michael Rainey in 1966 (div. 1984) and lived at Brogyntyn Home Farm, Oswestry.
* Victoria Mary Ormsby-Gore (b. 1946).
* Alice Magdalen Sarah Ormsby-Gore (1952–1995), who was the girlfriend of Eric Clapton from 1969-1974. She died of a heroin overdose in 1995.
* Francis David Ormsby-Gore, 6th Baron Harlech (1954–2016), who married Amanda Jane Grieve (b. 1959), daughter of Alan Grieve.

In 1968, Lord Harlech proposed to the widowed Jacqueline Kennedy, whom he had been friends with since before her husband&#x27;s assassination. Jacqueline Kennedy declined his offer of marriage in a letter, writing: &quot;If ever I can find some healing and some comfort — it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain ... I can find that now if the world will let us.&quot; She later married Aristotle Onassis.

On 11 December 1969, Lord Harlech married American socialite Pamela Colin, daughter of a Manhattan top corporate lawyer, herself a London resident editor of &quot;Vogue&quot; and then food editor of the &quot;British Vogue&quot;. The wedding was attended by Princess Margaret, the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, the Earl and Countess of Drogheda, the Earl and Countess of Airlie, The Countess Gowrie, Lord and Lady David Cecil, Sir Fitzroy Maclean, J. J. Astor and Michael Astor. They had one daughter:

* Pandora Beatrice Ormsby-Gore (b. April 1972), who is the partner of actor Rory Kinnear, with whom she has two children.

===Death===
Lord Harlech was seriously injured in a car crash at Montford Bridge near Shrewsbury on the evening of 25 January 1985 and died at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital the following morning, aged 66. 
Senator Edward Kennedy, Jacqueline Onassis and other Kennedy family members attended his funeral and interment in Llanfihangel-y-traethau.
He was succeeded in the barony by his second and only surviving son, Francis.

Contents of Lord Harlech&#x27;s house at Glyn Cywarch, including his government despatch box containing drafts from him and numerous letters from Jackie Kennedy illustrating their close relationship, were auctioned at Bonhams in London in September 2017 on behalf of his grandson after a preview in New York. The box (whose lock had had to be filed open) and its contents sold for over $40,000.

==In popular culture==
Ormsby-Gore was portrayed by Peter Donat in the 1974 television play &quot;The Missiles of October&quot;, which was about the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

==Honours and arms==
===Honours and Crown appointments===
Ormsby-Gore was appointed to be a Deputy Lieutenant of Shropshire on 12 April 1961. As the British Ambassador to the United States, he was, on 29 June 1961, appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Knight Commander (KCMG). In 1962, he was appointed to the Order of St John as a Knight (KStJ).

<doc id="594004" wikidata="Q419201" url="?curid=594004" title="Leucite">
<text>Leucite (from the Greek word &quot;leukos&quot; meaning white) is a rock-forming mineral of the feldspathoid group, silica-undersaturated and composed of potassium and aluminium tectosilicate KAlSi2O6. Crystals have the form of cubic icositetrahedra but, as first observed by Sir David Brewster in 1821, they are not optically isotropic, and are therefore pseudo-cubic. Goniometric measurements made by Gerhard vom Rath in 1873 led him to refer the crystals to the tetragonal system. Optical investigations have since proved the crystals to be still more complex in character, and to consist of several orthorhombic or monoclinic individuals, which are optically biaxial and repeatedly twinned, giving rise to twin-lamellae and to striations on the faces. When the crystals are raised to a temperature of about 500 °C they become optically isotropic and the twin-lamellae and striations disappear, although they reappear when the crystals are cooled again. This pseudo-cubic character of leucite is very similar to that of the mineral boracite.

The crystals are white or ash-grey in colour, hence the name suggested by A. G. Werner in 1701, from &quot;λευκος&quot;, &#x27;(matt) white&#x27;. They are transparent and glassy when fresh, albeit with a noticeably subdued &#x27;subvitreous&#x27; lustre due to the low refractive index, but readily alter to become waxy/greasy and then dull and opaque; they are brittle and break with a conchoidal fracture. The Mohs hardness is 5.5, and the specific gravity 2.47. Inclusions of other minerals, arranged in concentric zones, are frequently present in the crystals. On account of the color and form of the crystals the mineral was early known as &#x27;white garnet&#x27;. French authors in older literature may employ René Just Haüy&#x27;s name amphigène, but &#x27;leucite&#x27; is the only name for this mineral species that is recognised as official by the International Mineralogical Association.

<text>Randall Allen Terry (born on April 25, 1959) is an American politician and activist. Terry founded the anti-abortion organization Operation Rescue. Beginning in 1987, the group became particularly prominent for blockading the entrances to abortion clinics; Terry led the group until 1991. He has been arrested more than 40 times, including for violating a no-trespass order from the University of Notre Dame to protest against a visit by President Barack Obama.

In 2003, Terry founded the Society for Truth and Justice and conducted a program he called Operation Witness. In 1998, he ran for Congress in Upstate New York, and in 2006, he ran for a seat in the Florida Senate. Both times, he lost in the Republican primary.

Terry ran in the 2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He was the Constitution Party nominee for president of the United States in the 2024 presidential election, and his running mate was Stephen Broden.

==Career as an activist==
In 1986, Terry was arrested for the first time for chaining himself to a sink at an abortion clinic. Terry was frequently in the news because of his activities as the leader of Operation Rescue.

Terry was named as a co-defendant in the 1994 Supreme Court case, &quot;NOW v. Scheidler&quot;, a class-action suit to compel anti-abortion leaders to compensate clinics for loss of business. Terry settled out of court with the National Organization for Women. Rather than pay the settlement, Terry promptly filed for bankruptcy, prompting Senator Charles Schumer to propose an amendment to a bankruptcy bill in Congress which would &quot;specifically ... prevent abortion opponents from using the bankruptcy code to avoid paying court fines.&quot; The amendment was not included in the final bill. In 1998, NOW obtained more than 25,000 &quot;frequent flyer miles&quot; which were held by Terry in order to help satisfy a legal judgment.

In 1990, Terry helped to organize protests outside the hospital where Nancy Cruzan was a patient, around the time when her feeding tube was removed. The group Missouri Citizens for Life was also involved in the protests, along with the Rev. Patrick Mahoney, a former Operation Rescue staffer. He was also involved in protests which were related to the Terri Schiavo case. In 1994, Terry was a named defendant in Madsen v. Women&#x27;s Health Center Inc. which ultimately made it all the way to the US Supreme Court. The Justices sided with Aware Woman Clinic and upheld a Buffer Zone. In 1998, Randall Terry ran for the United States House of Representatives in Upstate New York. Terry competed with radio station owner William &quot;Bud&quot; Walker for the Republican nomination to face Democratic incumbent Maurice Hinchey. Terry received the endorsement of Focus on the Family head James Dobson; however, national and state Republicans were not supportive of Terry&#x27;s candidacy. Terry was defeated by Walker 53% to 35%, but he was the Right to Life Party&#x27;s nominee in the general election. Terry came in third place, winning 7% of the vote, with Hinchey and Walker winning 62% and 31% respectively. In 2000, Terry and his son Jamiel promoted the candidacy of Steve Forbes in the Republican presidential primary. In June 2005, Terry announced plans to run in the primary against Florida Republican state senator James E. King, citing King&#x27;s attempt to block legislation which would have kept Terri Schiavo alive. In August 2006, in an attempt to undermine King&#x27;s support in a Republican primary the next month, Terry publicized an endorsement of King by &quot;Bill Clinton&quot; — actually, robo-calls by a professional impersonator of former president Bill Clinton. The two &quot;Clinton&quot; scripts each contained a disclaimer. One was, &quot;Hello friend, Bill Clinton here – not really!&quot; The other was &quot;This is a celebrity impersonation.&quot; Terry used the scripts and the impersonator in 43,000 calls. The &quot;no amnesty&quot; line was a reference to immigration reform proposals which were an issue in many campaigns in 2006. On September 5, 2006, Terry was defeated in the primary, with King receiving over two-thirds of the votes which were cast.
On March 20, 2009, the White House announced that President Barack Obama was going to speak at the May 17 Commencement of the University of Notre Dame. Terry declared that Notre Dame, which is one of the foremost Catholic universities in the nation, should not have allowed Obama to speak. Terry objected to Obama&#x27;s speech because Obama supports abortion rights. In an article which was published in the university&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Observer&quot;, Terry was quoted as stating that he planned to turn the commencement into &quot;a circus.&quot; On the Notre Dame campus on May 1, 2009, Terry was arrested for violating a no-trespassing order. He posted a bond of $250 at the St. Joseph County Jail, was released that same day, and was assigned a court date later that month. In a statement which he released to a Christian news service, Terry claimed that Notre Dame&#x27;s invitation to Obama was a betrayal of Catholic teaching, comparing it to Judas&#x27; betrayal of Jesus Christ.

When Kansas obstetrician George Tiller was murdered while he was serving as an usher in his Wichita church on the morning of May 31, 2009, Terry immediately issued a statement in which he denounced Tiller. On the same day, June 1, Terry released a video in which he called president Barack Obama and pro-choice politicians &quot;child killers&quot;, and he also stated that Tiller was a &quot;mass murderer&quot; who &quot;reaped what he sowed.&quot; He voiced regret that Tiller was not able to &quot;get things right with his maker&quot; and he also stated that it was unfortunate that Tiller did not get a &quot;trial of a jury of his peers and to have a proper execution.&quot; Terry&#x27;s comments provoked a backlash, and Operation Rescue released a statement disavowing any connection to Terry, specifically criticizing his statement that Tiller&#x27;s murder had &quot;the potential to propel us more quickly to our goal.&quot; In an editorial, the &quot;Albany Times-Union&quot; accused Terry of undermining the credibility of the &quot;generally peaceful&quot; anti-abortion movement.

In 2013, Terry appeared on an episode of MTV&#x27;s &quot;True Life&quot; and during his appearance on the show, he advocated the criminalization of all forms of birth control. During the course of the episode he stated, &quot;Do we want to make the pill illegal? Yes. Do we want to make the IUD illegal? Yes. The morning after pill? Yes. The patch? Yes. Anything that&#x27;s a human pesticide, they all have to be made illegal. A woman has to go to jail if she kills her baby.&quot;

Terry produces and hosts a television program titled &quot;Randall Terry: The Voice of Resistance&quot;, which airs on The Walk TV and can be seen on his website &quot;Voice of Resistance&quot;.

===2012 presidential candidacy===


In January 2011, Terry announced his intention to challenge President Barack Obama in the Democratic Party primaries for the presidential election of 2012. His campaign strategy was based upon a commercial during Super Bowl XLVI featuring graphic photographs of aborted fetuses; historically, the networks have refused all political and issue-related advertising during the Super Bowl, citing equal-time rules, and the advertisement did not air.

The attempt to air the ads led to legal action and a statement by the Democratic National Committee that Terry was not a legitimate candidate, and thus should be forbidden privileges given others running.

In December 2011, he became the physical target of candidate Vermin Supreme, who sprinkled glitter over his head during a debate, claiming he was &quot;turning Randall Terry gay.&quot;

Terry received 18% of the vote in the 2012 Democratic Oklahoma presidential primary. He also won 12 counties in the state, including the entire panhandle, and was awarded two delegates in the Democratic primary. Kansas TV station KDGL-LD channel 23, is an Independent TV station serving Southwest Kansas and the Oklahoma Panhandle. It and its sister stations carry Randall&#x27;s Walk TV program, broadcasting the length of the Panhandle. It was the only primary in which Terry won any counties or delegates. He had also appeared on the ballots in Alaska, Missouri, and New Hampshire. He received 22,858 votes or 0.3% in the Democratic primary.

===2012 congressional candidacy===
Although he lives in West Virginia, Terry paid his filing fee and ran as an independent candidate for Congress in Florida&#x27;s 20th District. Incumbent Democrat Alcee Hastings won that election with 88% of the vote on November 6, 2012.

===2024 presidential candidacy===
On March 29, 2024, Terry declared his candidacy in the 2024 United States presidential election.
He was nominated by the Constitution Party for president on April 27, 2024. He said he would not accept the nomination if Stephen Broden was not nominated for vice president. He was nominated by the Constitution Party of Oregon on May 28, 2024. Some state parties such as Nevada and Utah rejected Terry&#x27;s nomination and instead nominated convention opponent Joel Skousen.

In August 2024, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that some Democratic Party donors and operatives were assisting Terry&#x27;s ballot access efforts and seeking to promote his campaign among pro-life voters, in order to help Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by taking votes from Donald Trump.

Terry&#x27;s campaign paid for ads that aired on ABC in October, during commercial breaks for &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, and &quot;The View&quot;. They drew media attention for containing graphic photos of aborted fetuses, and narration which compared celebrities who supported abortion rights to Nazis. Because Terry met the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s definition of a &quot;legally qualified candidate&quot;, ABC was required to air the advertisements without any edits, though due to their controversial content, the network ran disclaimers noting its legal duty to broadcast them and warning viewers of the imagery within.

==Personal life==
Terry has been married twice. With his first wife Cindy, he had a daughter and then he fostered two additional daughters and a son. He adopted the two youngest foster children. He has four sons with his second wife, Andrea.

The son of public school teachers, Terry was raised in Rochester, New York. After dropping out of high school, hitch-hiking around the United States, and returning home to work in various jobs, he attended Elim Bible Institute, graduating in 1981. He later earned degrees from Empire State College and Norwich University. 

In the early 1980s, Terry married Cindy Dean, a woman who he had met in Bible school. In 1985, he met a woman who gave birth to her second child in prison and was planning to have an abortion rather than have a third child. Terry persuaded her to continue with the pregnancy and a daughter named Tila was born later that year. In 1987, Cindy and Randall Terry had a daughter together, whom they named Faith. In March 1988, they took in Tila, then aged three, and her siblings Jamiel, 8, and Ebony, 12, as foster children. All three of them are biracial; their mother was white. Terry formally adopted the two younger children in 1994 and on his résumé, he began to describe his family as: &quot;Children: One by birth and three black foster children,&quot; although Ebony had left home at the age of 16 in 1991. 

Ebony, who was not adopted by Terry, uses the surname Whetstone, but Jamiel and Tila took and retained the surname Terry. Ebony converted to Islam, a religion which Terry has preached is composed of &quot;murderers&quot; and &quot;terrorists.&quot; In 2004, Terry described his relationship with Ebony as &quot;good.&quot; However, Terry banned Tila from his home after she became pregnant outside of marriage twice by the age of 18; her first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.

In 1998, when Terry was accused of advocating racism while he was running for Congress, his son Jamiel stepped forward to defend him. In 2000, Jamiel worked with his father on Steven Forbes&#x27; campaign for the Republican nomination for U.S. president, and he campaigned with his father against gay marriage in Vermont. In 2004, Jamiel publicly announced that he was gay and he also wrote an article for &quot;Out Magazine&quot;, for which he was paid US$2,500. When he learned that the &quot;Out&quot; article was going to be published, Terry pre-empted Jamiel by writing an essay, &quot;My Prodigal Son, the Homosexual&quot;, in which he writes of pain and disappointment, blames Jamiel&#x27;s homosexuality and his other troubles on his childhood experiences, and contends that much of the &quot;Out Magazine&quot; article is false and was written by other people. Jamiel&#x27;s response was, &quot;My father&#x27;s first and foremost aim is to protect himself. He talks about how I prostitute the family&#x27;s name, but he&#x27;s used the fact that he saved my sister from abortion and rescued me from hardship in his speeches and interviews. What&#x27;s the difference?&quot;

In 2000, Terry divorced Cindy Dean, his wife of 19 years, and married his former church assistant, Andrea Sue Kollmorgen. Kollmorgen, born c. 1976, was approximately 25 years old at the time of their nuptials; As a consequence of the divorce, the home on where he had lived with Cindy and their four children was going to be sold. In 2000, some in the press unfavorably compared his decision to divorce Cindy Dean and marry Kollmorgen to the opinion which he expressed in his 1995 book, &quot;The Judgment of God&quot;: &quot;Families are destroyed as a father vents his mid-life crisis by abandoning his wife for a &#x27;younger, prettier model.&#x27; &quot; His sentiments against divorce had been so strong that when his own parents got divorced, &quot;Randall refused to let his children speak with their grandfather for three years,&quot; according to interviews which were conducted with the family by the &quot;Washington Post.&quot; 

As a result of Terry&#x27;s divorce from Cindy Dean, the pastor of the Landmark Church of Binghamton, New York, &quot;unceremoniously tossed him out&quot; although Terry had been a member there for 15 years. That church had previously censured him because he had abandoned his wife and the two children while they were still living at home in preparation for divorce, and it also censured him by claiming that he was engaging in a &quot;pattern of repeated and sinful relationships and conversations with both single and married women.&quot; After the censure and expulsion, Terry joined the Charismatic Episcopal Church, a denomination which was established in 1992. 

After a period of study which commenced in 2005, Terry formally converted to Catholicism in 2006, taking the confirmation name David Mark. After his conversion, he disavowed his first marriage and divorce, saying, &quot;There were tragic problems that were inherent to the marriage. According to Catholic doctrine as it has been taught to me, those problems made it an invalid sacrament.&quot;

In 2004, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that Terry and Cindy&#x27;s daughter was in college. Five years into his second marriage, a 2006 article in the &quot;National Catholic Register&quot; described his current family as &quot;his three, soon to be four, rambunctious young boys.&quot; Terry&#x27;s second wife, Andrea, is also an anti-abortion activist and in 2008, she was arrested for trespassing while she was leafleting a Catholic cathedral parking lot with campaign fliers for a fictitious candidate who was advocating the enslavement of African-Americans. Terry stated, &quot;The piece was intended to be incendiary and basically a satire,&quot; a protest against vehicles in the church parking lot which, he said, carried bumper stickers supporting pro-choice political candidates, particularly Rudy Giuliani.

Terry&#x27;s son Jamiel was killed in an automobile accident in November 2011. They had reportedly reconciled prior to Jamiel&#x27;s death. Terry&#x27;s daughter Tila died in 2024.

In 2012, Terry moved his family to Romney, West Virginia, to focus on his political campaign.

<text>Sandra Dee (born Alexandra Cymboliak Zuck; April 23, 1942 – February 20, 2005) was an American actress. Dee began her career as a child model, working first in commercials and then film in her teenage years. Best known for her portrayal of ingénues, Dee earned a Golden Globe Award as one of the year&#x27;s most promising newcomers for her performance in Robert Wise&#x27;s &quot;Until They Sail&quot; (1957). She became a teenage star for her performances in &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;, &quot;Gidget&quot; and &quot;A Summer Place&quot; (all released in 1959), which made her a household name.

By the late 1960s, her career had started to decline and a highly publicized marriage to Bobby Darin ended in divorce. The year of her divorce, Dee&#x27;s contract with Universal Pictures was dropped. She attempted a comeback with the 1970 independent horror film &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;, but rarely acted after this time, appearing only occasionally in television productions throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. The rest of the decade was marked by alcoholism, mental illness, and reclusiveness, particularly after her mother died in 1987. Dee sought medical and psychological help in the early 1990s and died in 2005 of complications from kidney disease.

==Life and career==
===1942–1951: Early life===
Dee was born Alexandra Zuck on April 23, 1942, in Bayonne, New Jersey, the only child of John Zuck and Mary ( Cymboliak) Zuck, who met as teenagers at a Russian Orthodox Church dance. They married shortly afterward, but divorced before Dee was five years old. She was of Carpatho-Rusyn ancestry and raised in the Orthodox faith; her son, Dodd Darin, wrote in his biographical book about his parents titled &quot;Dream Lovers&quot; that Dee&#x27;s mother Mary and her aunt Olga [later Olga Duda] &quot;were first generation daughters of a working-class Russian Orthodox couple&quot;, and Dee recalled, &quot;we belonged to a Russian Orthodox church, and there was dancing at the social events.&quot; She soon adopted the name Sandra Dee, became a professional model by the age of four and progressed to television commercials.

There has been debate as to Dee&#x27;s actual birth year. According to her son&#x27;s book, Dee was born in 1944, but she and her mother falsely inflated her age by two years to find more work modeling and acting, which she began at a very young age. Legal records, including her California divorce record from Bobby Darin, as well as the Social Security Death Index and her own cryptstone all give her year of birth as 1942. In a 1967 interview with the &quot;Oxnard Press-Courier&quot;, she acknowledged being 18 in 1960 when she first met Darin, whom she wed three months later.

It should be noted per census records for 1950, Sandra was living as a great-granddaughter of Archie Wanko along with her mother as granddaughter Mary Zuck (divorced) on Avenue A in Bayonne, NJ working as a secretary in real estate office. Sandra is reported as being 8 years old which implied YOB as 1942. Further research revealed an article of Social News in the Bayonne Times newspaper dated May 19, 1942 where (Mrs. John Zuck) aka Mary Zuck and her daughter Alexandra Zuck (1 month old) attended a birthday party for a 4-year-old boy along with other family and friends at the home on 13th St in Bayonne. If Sandra was born in 1944 as noted in her son&#x27;s book, she could not have been at a birthday party in 1942. It would appear that YOB of 1942 is correct. Other social notes in the same newspaper report various school events and dance recitals she was in during the 1940s. A 1950 article notes she was part of a group of students who performed for a Polio fund raiser in NYC at Carnegie Hall. An article in 1955 reports that Sandra Dee is a &quot;top model&quot; living in Bayonne in 9th grade in School #3 and was using the name of Sandra Douvan had recently moved to a &quot;swank hotel&quot; in NYC. It was reported she started her modeling career with Conover, was making $20 per hour and had many modeling jobs with Good Housekeekping, Glamour and the New Yorker among others and had been on at least 4 TV shows including with Eddie Fisher. She was also the Whitman Sampler poster girl. The article reports her parents moved to NYC for her career and that they put her earnings into a &quot;Trust Fund&quot; for her future. 
An article in 1956 reports she is on her way to Hollywood (Ross Hunter) and it was her late father (actually step-father) who launched her on the modeling career and that she was making $120 a day (approx. $1,400 a day in 2025 dollar value).

Dee&#x27;s parents divorced in 1950 and her mother married real estate executive Eugene &quot;Gene&quot; Douvan, who reportedly sexually abused Dee after he married her mother.

Her birth city Bayonne, named March 21, 1960 &quot;Sandra Dee Day&quot; which she attended and made stops along all the places she attended (school, church, etc.) while she was growing up until she left to live in NYC. The city honored her the entire day with many events.

Research on Eugene Victor Douvan (later Sr. having 2 sons, Eugene Jr and Robert with his first wife Stephania Curtis) reports details of illegal entry to USA via New Orleans, other last name alias.
He had heart aliments and ultimately died of same after being taken from NYC to Georgetown Hospital in Washington DC for treatment.

Mr. Douvan&#x27;s application for citizenship reveals his history of immigrating to USA, alias used, Eugene George Stewart also Frederick Von Bergner that he was living in Roosevelt, Nassau County NY at the time (application is made in Brooklyn NY) 
Various ads he placed in Bayonne newspapers advertised he was available for construction and real estate work. He was living in Bayonne with his son Robert in the 1950s. His older son had lived in Chicago and Michigan. 
Per the 1950 Census, Mary Zuck was divorced and working as a secretary in a real estate office in 1950. She and Eugene married in NYC in 1951.

===1952–1956: Modeling career===
Producer Ross Hunter claimed to have discovered Dee on Park Avenue in New York City with her mother when she was 12 years old. In a 1959 interview, Dee recalled that she &quot;grew up fast,&quot; surrounded mostly by older people, and was &quot;never held back in anything [she] wanted to do.&quot;

During her modeling career, Dee attempted to lose weight to &quot;be as skinny as the high-fashion models,&quot; although an improper diet &quot;ruined [her] skin, hair, nails—everything.&quot; Having lost weight, her body was unable to digest any food that she ate, and it took the help of a doctor to regain her health. According to Dee, she &quot;could have killed [herself]&quot; and &quot;had to learn to eat all over again.&quot;

Despite the damaging effects on her health, Dee earned $75,000 in 1956 () working as a child model in New York, which she used to support herself and her mother after the death of her stepfather in 1956. According to sources, Dee&#x27;s large modeling salary was more than what she would later earn as an actress. While modeling in New York, she attended the Professional Children&#x27;s School.

===1957–1958: Early films and Universal contract===
Ending her modeling career, Dee moved from New York to Hollywood in 1957. She graduated from University High School in Los Angeles in June 1958 at age 16. Her onscreen debut was in the 1957 MGM film &quot;Until They Sail&quot;, directed by Robert Wise. To promote the film, Dee appeared in a December issue of &quot;Modern Screen&quot; in a column by Louella Parsons, who praised Dee and compared her appearance and talent to those of Shirley Temple. Dee&#x27;s performance made her one of that year&#x27;s winners of the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress.

MGM cast Dee as the female lead in &quot;The Reluctant Debutante&quot; (1958), with John Saxon as her romantic costar. It was the first of several films in which Dee appeared with Saxon. She provided the voice of Gerda for the English dub of &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; (1957). The stress of her newfound success and the effects of sexual abuse, caused Dee to struggle with chronic anorexia nervosa, and her kidneys temporarily failed.

In 1958, Dee signed with Universal Pictures and was one of the company&#x27;s last contract players prior to the dissolution of the studio system. She had a lead role in &quot;The Restless Years&quot; (1958) for producer Ross Hunter, opposite Saxon and Teresa Wright. She followed this with another film for Hunter, &quot;A Stranger in My Arms&quot; (1959).

===1959–1965: Stardom===
Dee&#x27;s third film for Hunter was of greater impact than the first two: &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (1959), starring Lana Turner. The film became a box-office success, grossing more than $50 million. It was the highest-grossing film in Universal&#x27;s history and made Dee a household name. She was lent to Columbia Pictures to play the title role in the teenage beach comedy &quot;Gidget&quot; (1959), which was a solid hit, helping spawn the beach party genre and leading to two sequels, two television series and two television movies (although Dee did not appear in any of those).

Universal next cast Dee as a tomboy opposite Audie Murphy in the Western romantic comedy &quot;The Wild and the Innocent&quot; (1959). Warner Bros. borrowed her for another melodrama in the vein of &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;, &quot;A Summer Place&quot; (1959), opposite Troy Donahue as her romantic costar. The film was a massive hit, and that year American box office exhibitors voted Dee the 16th-most popular star in the country.

Hunter reunited Dee with Turner and Saxon in Universal&#x27;s &quot;Portrait in Black&quot; (1960), a thriller that was a financial success despite receiving harsh reviews. Dee was listed as the nation&#x27;s seventh-greatest star at the end of 1960. Peter Ustinov cast her as the lead in the Cold War comedy &quot;Romanoff and Juliet&quot; (1961) with Universal&#x27;s new heartthrob John Gavin, reuniting them from &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;.

Dee and Gavin played together again in Hunter&#x27;s popular &quot;Tammy Tell Me True&quot; (1961), in which Dee took the Tammy role originated by Debbie Reynolds. In &quot;Come September&quot; (1961), she worked with Bobby Darin in his film debut (following a cameo in an earlier film). Dee and Darin married after filming on December 1, 1960. On December 16, 1961, she gave birth to their son, her only child, Dodd Mitchell Darin (also known as Morgan Mitchell Darin).

In 1961, Dee, with three years remaining on her Universal contract, signed a new one for seven years. Dee and Darin appeared together in the Hunter romantic comedy &quot;If a Man Answers&quot; (1962). In 1963, she appeared in the final Tammy film, &quot;Tammy and the Doctor&quot;, and the hit comedy &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine&quot;, playing a character loosely based on Nora Ephron. That year, she was voted the eighth-greatest star in the country, but it was her last appearance in the top 10. Dee appeared in &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Rich&quot; (1964), a musical remake of &quot;It Started with Eve&quot;, once again for Hunter. She was reunited with Darin in &quot;That Funny Feeling&quot; (1965) before appearing in her last film at Universal under her contract with the spy comedy &quot;A Man Could Get Killed&quot; (1966).

Dee was also a singer and recorded some singles in the early 1960s, including a cover version of &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;.

===1966–1983: Career decline and later roles===
By the end of the 1960s, Dee&#x27;s career had slowed significantly, and she was dropped by Universal Pictures. She rarely acted following her 1967 divorce from Darin. In a 1967 interview with Roger Ebert, she reflected on her experience in the studio system and on the ingénue image that had been foisted on her, which she found constricting:

Look at this––[a] cigarette. I like to smoke. I&#x27;m 25 years old, and it so happens that I like to smoke. So out in Hollywood the studio press agents are still pulling cigarettes out of my hand and covering my drink with a napkin whenever my picture is taken. Little Sandra Dee isn&#x27;t supposed to smoke, you know. Or drink. Or breathe.

Dee appeared in the somewhat successful &quot;Doctor, You&#x27;ve Got to Be Kidding!&quot; in 1967. Hunter asked her to return to Universal in a co-starring role in &quot;Rosie!&quot; (1967), but the film was not a success. Dee was inactive in the film industry for several years before appearing in the 1970 American International Pictures occult horror film &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;—a loose adaptation of an H.P. Lovecraft story—as a college student who finds herself in the center of an occult ritual plot. Dee later said, &quot;The reason I decided to do &quot;Dunwich&quot; was because I couldn&#x27;t put the script down once I started reading it. I had read so many that I had to plow through, just because I promised someone. Even if this movie turns out be a complete disaster, I guarantee it will change my image.&quot; However, she refused to appear nude in the film&#x27;s final sequence that had been written in the screenplay.

Throughout the 1970s, Dee took sporadic guest-starring roles on episodes of several television series, such as &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; and &quot;Police Woman&quot;. Her final film performance occurred in the low-budget drama &quot;Lost&quot; (1983). In her later years, Dee told a newspaper that she &quot;felt like a has-been that never was.&quot;

===1984–2005: Later life and retirement===
Dee&#x27;s years in the 1980s were marked by poor health, and she became a self-described recluse after retiring from acting. At one point, she finally confronted her mother about the sexual abuse by her stepfather when she was a child, as well as her mother&#x27;s obliviousness to it. She said:

One night I couldn&#x27;t control the pressure any longer. My mother and I were at home with a few of her close friends, and she started eulogizing my stepfather. I was slowly getting more and more irate. Finally I said, &quot;Mom, shut up. A saint he wasn&#x27;t.&quot; My mother started defending him, and I said, &quot;Well, guess what your saint did to me? He had sex with me.&quot; My mother was shocked, then angry. I knew I hurt her. I wanted to. I had so much anger toward her for not doing something to help me. But she ignored me, and the subject never came up again. I realize now that my mother erased the abuse from her own mind. It didn&#x27;t exist, so she didn&#x27;t have to feel guilty.

Dee battled anorexia nervosa, depression, and alcoholism for many years, hitting a low point after her mother died of lung cancer on December 27, 1987, at age 63. Dee stated that for months she became a recluse living on soup, crackers and Scotch, with her body weight falling to only . After she began to vomit blood, her son compelled her to seek medical and psychiatric treatment. Her mental and physical condition improved, and she expressed a desire to appear in a television situation comedy, partly in order to belong to a family. She stopped drinking altogether after being diagnosed with kidney failure in 2000, which was attributed to years of heavy drinking and smoking.

In 1994&#x27;s &quot;Dream Lovers: The Magnificent Shattered Lives of Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee&quot;, Dodd Darin chronicled his mother&#x27;s anorexia and drug and alcohol problems, stating that she had been sexually abused as a child by her stepfather Eugene Douvan. The same year, Dee&#x27;s final acting credit occurred with a voice-only appearance on an episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;.

==Death==
After requiring kidney dialysis for the last four years of her life, Dee died of complications from kidney disease on February 20, 2005, at the Los Robles Hospital &amp; Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, California, at the age of 62. She is interred in a crypt at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in the Hollywood Hills.

<doc id="594014" wikidata="Q422874" url="?curid=594014" title="Argentite">
<text>In mineralogy, argentite () is cubic silver sulfide (Ag2S), which can only exist at temperatures above , , or . When it cools to ordinary temperatures it turns into its monoclinic polymorph, acanthite. The International Mineralogical Association has decided to reject argentite as a proper mineral.

The name &quot;argentite&quot; sometimes also refers to pseudomorphs of argentite: specimens of acanthite which still display some of the outward signs of the cubic crystal form, even though their actual crystal structure is monoclinic due to the lower temperature. This form of acanthite is occasionally found as uneven cubes and octahedra, but more often as dendritic or earthy masses, with a blackish lead-grey color and metallic luster.

Argentite belongs to the galena group. Cleavage, which is so prominent a feature in galena, here presents only in traces. The mineral is perfectly sectile and has a shining streak; hardness 2.5, specific gravity is 7.2–7.4. It occurs in mineral veins, and when found in large masses, as in Mexico and in the Comstock Lode in Nevada, it forms an important ore of silver. The mineral was mentioned in 1529 by G. Agricola, but the name &quot;argentite&quot; was not used till 1845 and is due to W. Haidinger. Old names for the species are &quot;Glaserz&quot;, &quot;silver-glance&quot; and &quot;vitreous silver&quot;. A related copper-rich mineral occurring e.g. in Jalpa, Zacatecas, Mexico, is known as jalpaite.

<doc id="594016" wikidata="Q728595" url="?curid=594016" title="Ranunculus asiaticus">
<text>Ranunculus asiaticus, the Persian buttercup, is a species of buttercup (&quot;Ranunculus&quot;) native to the eastern Mediterranean region, southwestern Asia, southeastern Europe (Crete, Karpathos and Rhodes), and northeastern Africa.

It is a herbaceous perennial plant growing up to 45 cm tall, with simple or branched stems. The basal leaves are three-lobed, with leaves higher on the stems more deeply divided; like the stems, they are downy or hairy. The flowers are 3–5 cm in diameter, variably red to pink, yellow, or white, with one to several flowers on each stem.

It is a protected species in some jurisdictions, including Israel and Palestine.

==Cultivation and uses==
Double-flowered forms, which are likely hybrids, are a popular ornamental plant in gardens, and widely used in floristry. Numerous cultivars have been selected, including &#x27;Bloomingdale&#x27;, &#x27;Picotee&#x27;, &#x27;Pot Dwarf&#x27;, and &#x27;Superbissima&#x27;. The plants can tolerate light frost, but are not hardy at temperatures below -10°C.

&#x27;Tecolote&#x27; and &#x27;Bloomingdale&#x27; are examples of the double-flowered plants. The single-flowered species form is not commercially cultivated on any significant scale. By contrast, the similar-looking &quot;Anemone coronaria&quot; is widely available in single-flower &#x27;De Caen&#x27; hybrid forms. However, as with &quot;Ranunculus asiaticus&quot;, the species form, which also has red single flowers, is not commercially cultivated.

==Recognition==
On March 1, 2023, Canada Post, Canada&#x27;s postal administration, issued a postage stamp depicting &quot;Ranunculus asiaticus&quot;. The stamp was issued in booklets and rolls and as a souvenir sheet.

<doc id="594024" wikidata="Q409470" url="?curid=594024" title="Pyrophyllite">
<text>Pyrophyllite is a phyllosilicate mineral composed of aluminium silicate hydroxide: Al2Si4O10(OH)2. It occurs in two forms (habits): crystalline folia and compact masses; distinct crystals are not known.

The folia have a pronounced pearly luster, owing to the presence of a perfect cleavage parallel to their surfaces: they are flexible but not elastic, and are usually arranged radially in fan-like or spherical groups. This variety, when heated, exfoliates and swells up to many times its original volume. The color of both varieties is white, pale green, greyish or yellowish; they are very soft (hardness of 1.0 to 1.5) and are greasy to the touch. The specific gravity is 2.65–2.85. The two varieties are thus very similar to talc.

==Occurrence==
Pyrophyllite occurs in phyllite and schistose rocks, often associated with kyanite, of which it is an alteration product. It also occurs as hydrothermal deposits. Typical associated minerals include: kyanite, andalusite, topaz, mica and quartz.

Deposits containing well-crystallized material are found in:
* Manuels, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, talc-like bright white appearance, high grade, no impurities; 21 million ton deposit. 
*Russia – pale green foliated masses, very like talc in appearance, are found at Beresovsk near Yekaterinburg in the Urals.
* St. Niklas, Zermatt, Valais, Switzerland
* Vaastana, Kristianstad, Sweden
* Near Ottrje, Ardennes Mountains, Belgium
* Ibitiara, Bahia, Brazil
* Nagano Prefecture, Japan
* Near Ogilby, Imperial County at Tres Cerritos, Mariposa County, and the Champion mine, White Mountains, Mono County, California, US
* Near Quartzsite, La Paz County, Arizona, US
* Large deposits at the Deep River region of North Carolina, USA
*Graves Mountain, Lincoln County, Georgia, US

In South Africa, major deposits of pyrophyllite occur within the Ottosdal region, where it is mined for the production of a variety of manufactured goods, and blocks are quarried and marketed as &quot;Wonderstone&quot; for the carving of sculptures.

==Uses==
The compact variety of pyrophyllite is used for slate pencils and tailors&#x27; chalk (French chalk), and is carved by the Chinese into small images and ornaments of various kinds. Other soft compact minerals (steatite and pinite) used for these Chinese carvings are included with pyrophyllite under the terms agalmatolite and pagodite.

Pyrophyllite is easily machineable and has excellent thermal stability, so it is added to clay to reduce thermal expansion when firing, but it has many other industrial uses when combined with other compounds, such as in insecticide and for making bricks. Pyrophyllite is also widely used in high-pressure experiments, both as a gasket material and as a pressure-transmitting medium.

<text>The Maribyrnong River is a perennial river of the Port Phillip catchment, located in the northwestern suburbs of Melbourne, in the Australian state of Victoria.

==Course==
The Maribyrnong River draws its headwaters from near Mount Macedon within the Macedon Ranges, part of the Great Dividing Range. Formed by the confluence of the Jackson Creek and the Deep Creek below , the river flows generally southward, joined by two minor tributaries before reaching its confluence with the Yarra River at , to eventually empty into Port Phillip. The river descends over its course.

===Headwaters===
The head of the Maribyrnong catchment is situated in the Macedon Ranges region of central Victoria around northwest of Melbourne City Centre. Various creeks beginning in the southern Mount Macedon area flow into Riddells Creek which in turn flows into the Jackson Creek. The Jackson Creek starts its journey northwest of Gisborne, north of Melbourne CBD. The other major tributary of the Maribyrnong is Deep Creek, which also has its headwaters in the northern and eastern parts of the Macedon Ranges. The creek has cut a deep valley through the surrounding basalt plains in its southward course, in particular as it flows through localities such as Konagaderra and Bulla. To the west of Melbourne Airport the tributaries of the Jackson Creek and the Deep Creek conjoin to form the Maribyrnong River. The Organ Pipes National Park can be found adjacent to the Jackson Creek, near the Calder Freeway, with picnic facilities and a prominent display of basaltic columns a geological formation, so named because they look like organ pipes. Swimming occurs in these upper reaches of the river, but is not recommended.

===Middle reaches===
The river flows south and west. At Keilor the river winds back on itself in a giant horseshoe bend, before winding south again at Brimbank Park. Here the river flows below the western plains. Brimbank Park forms a huge amphitheatre in the bend in the river with picnic areas, cycle and walking trails, and a café, that is usually busy on weekends and holidays. The area is rich in birdlife and native fauna. The Maribyrnong River Trail shared path starts at Brimbank Park, following mostly beside the river to near its confluence with the Yarra River in Footscray. At Avondale Heights and Essendon West residents have views over the river valley to the skyscrapers of the Melbourne CBD. Up until this area, the Maribyrnong is unusual in being one of the few large basaltic streams in Victoria. The Maribyrnong is a freshwater river as far downstream as Solomon&#x27;s Ford, Avondale Heights. Swimming in the river is not permitted downstream of the Canning Street bridge in Avondale Heights.

===Lower reaches===

The river becomes esturarine as it flows through Avondale Heights. At Maribyrnong, Melbourne&#x27;s Living Museum of the West presents information on the history of the river and the early industrial history of the site. Dolphins are sometimes sighted in the lower reaches of the river, along with many water birds, especially at Burndap Park. Footscray Park opposite the Flemington Racecourse is only metres down river from Pipemakers Park and Burndap Park, the river then meanders across the floodplain to its juncture with the Yarra River at Yarraville. The water quality of these estuarine reaches of the river is poor. Sediments show considerable pollution from past industrial activities and sewage discharge from the 20th century. Today, swimming is not recommended due to exposure to untreated sewage in run-off from these heavily urbanised areas.

==Geography==
The geographic features and tributaries of the river are listed below, tributaries in bold:

*Yarraville Wharves
*Maribyrnong Berth
*Newells Paddock Wetlands
*Burndap Lakes
*Jacks Canal
*Frogs Hollow Wetland
*Cliffs
*Steele or Rose Creek
*Grimes Flat
*Kulin Wetlands
*Taylors Creek
*Horseshoe Bend
*Gumms Corner
*Arundel Creek
*Jackson Creek / Deep Creek

==Etymology==
The river was initially named &quot;Saltwater River&quot; by early settlers, due to the tidal nature of its lower reaches. The name &quot;Maribyrnong&quot; however, is derived from &quot;mirring-gnay-bir-nong&quot; which in Woiwurrung, the language of the local Wurundjeri people, is said to mean &quot;I can hear a ringtail possum&quot; or &quot;saltwater river&quot; (&quot;Gunung&quot; or &quot;Gunnung&quot; is Woiwurrung for river, as seen in the names of other watercourses in the area, such as; Koonung Creek and Birrarung).

&quot;Marriburnong&quot; is an alternate spelling listed on a map dated from 1840.

The inner western and north-western suburbs of Melbourne are located in the vicinity of the Maribyrnong River and the river has given its name to the suburb of Maribyrnong and the local government area, the City of Maribyrnong.

==History==

The Maribyrnong River valley has been home for the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation for up to years. Human remains dated at least years old have been found along the river, with much older signs of human habitation also present.

The first Europeans to explore along the river were the party led by Charles Grimes, Deputy Surveyor-General of New South Wales, in February 1803. John Batman is likely to have explored up the river in early 1835. With the establishment of the colony of Melbourne later that year, sheep runs were soon established by Edmund Davis Fergusson and Michael Solomon in the Avondale and Sunshine areas. On Solomon&#x27;s sheep station the ford now near the west end of Canning Street in Avondale Heights soon became known as &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Ford&quot;. This was the lowest crossing on the Saltwater (Maribyrnong) River, and the furthest inland point of tidal influence. Batman is believed to have crossed the river at this point probably in the well worn steps of Aboriginals. It was for many years the only way from Melbourne to Geelong and land west.

During the second half of the 19th century much of Melbourne&#x27;s industry was located along the river, and the water quality became very degraded. With the closure of many industries since the 1960s and 1970s, much river front land has opened up to parkland and residential estates.

==Recreational use==
As the second major river in metropolitan Melbourne, the Maribyrnong plays a very important part in Melbourne&#x27;s recreation. Boating, cycling along its bike paths such as the Maribyrnong River Trail, fishing, and walking. Light bushwalking can also be done and nature watchers can observe Australian native fauna such as echidna, wallabies as well as the ubiquitous possums and flying foxes.

==Flora and fauna==

===Native species===
Many native species exist along the Maribyrnong River with many species thriving in the area. Native mammals include swamp wallabies, grey-headed flying foxes, common brushtail possums, common ringtail possums, water rats, echidnas, and platypus in the upper reaches of the river. Native reptile species include eastern brown snakes, tiger snakes, skinks, and common snakeneck turtles. Native birds include the eastern whipbird, cockatoo, rainbow lorikeet, galah, brown falcon, peregrine falcon, square-tailed kite, royal spoonbill, black swan, Pacific black duck, little pied cormorant, moorhen, and long-billed corella. There are various native frogs and native fish species include the short-finned eel, tupong, short-headed lamprey, Australian grayling, southern black bream, common galaxias, broad-finned galaxias and spotted galaxias. Starfish may also be found in the river.
===Introduced species===
Introduced species include the red fox, European rabbit, and feral cat. While introduced birds include the song thrush, common blackbird, common myna, common starling, house sparrow, spotted turtle dove, rock pigeon, and mallard. Common carp have also been introduced to the river.

==Environmental issues==
The Maribyrnong River faces various environmental issues, apart from introduced pest species, also pollution and contamination – arsenic and heavy metals from industry and litter including one trap to mitigate litter entering the river from stormwater. Today, industrial pollution still occurs due to poor chemical handling practices, improper storage, and dilapidated infrastructure. Continued land development for housing causes soil disturbance resulting in increased river turbidity.

<doc id="594037" wikidata="Q2904466" url="?curid=594037" title="Special Relationship">
<text>The Special Relationship is a term that is often used to describe the political, social, diplomatic, cultural, economic, legal, environmental, religious, military and historic relations between the United Kingdom and the United States or its political leaders. The term first came into popular usage after it was used in a 1946 speech by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Both nations have been close allies during many conflicts in the 20th and the 21st centuries, including World War I and II, the Korean War, the Cold War, the Gulf War and the war on terror.

Although both governments also have close relationships with many other nations, the level of cooperation between the UK and the US in trade and commerce, military planning, execution of military operations, nuclear weapons technology, and intelligence sharing has been described as &quot;unparallelled&quot; among major world powers. The close relationships between British and American heads of government such as Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan as well as between Tony Blair and both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have been noted. At the diplomatic level, characteristics include recurring public representations of the relationship as &quot;special&quot;, frequent and high-profile political visits and extensive information exchange at the diplomatic working level.

Some critics deny the existence of a &quot;special relationship&quot; and call it a myth. During the 1956 Suez Crisis, US President Dwight Eisenhower threatened to bankrupt the pound sterling due to Britain&#x27;s invasion of Egypt. Thatcher privately opposed the 1983 US invasion of Grenada, and Reagan unsuccessfully initially pressured against the 1982 Falklands War. Former US President Barack Obama considered German Chancellor Angela Merkel to be his &quot;closest international partner&quot; and accused British Prime Minister David Cameron of being &quot;distracted by a range of other things&quot; during the 2011 military intervention in Libya. 

There is also recognition that the imagery and language associated with the &quot;special relationship&quot; has been proliferated by the United States to describe other international relationships. For example, the US Department of State argues that &quot;France is America&#x27;s oldest friend and ally&quot;, similarly, the relationship between the United States and Canada has also been described as &quot;special&quot;. Additionally, the US-Israel relationship has commonly been considered &quot;special&quot;, by academics and politicians, since 1967. 

Following the 2016 election of Donald Trump as US president, the British government under Prime Ministers Theresa May and Boris Johnson sought to establish &quot;a new special relationship&quot; with the Trump administration. Trump claimed that his relationship with Theresa May was &quot;the highest level of special&quot;, and Trump praised Johnson as prime minister and celebrated comparisons that had been made between Johnson and himself, endorsing him during the 2019 election and referring to him as &quot;Britain Trump&quot;.

==Origins==

Although the &quot;Special Relationship&quot; between the UK and the US was perhaps most memorably emphasized by Churchill, its existence and even the term itself had been recognized since the 19th century, not least by rival powers.

The American and British governments were enemies when foreign relations between them first began, after the American colonies declared their independence from British rule, which triggered the American Revolutionary War. Relations often continued to be strained until the mid-19th century, erupting into open conflict during the War of 1812 and again verging on war when Britain almost supported the separatist Confederate States during the beginning of the American Civil War. British leaders were constantly annoyed from the 1830s to the 1860s by what they saw as American pandering to the mob, as in the Aroostook War in 1838–1839 and the Oregon boundary dispute in 1844–1846. However, British middle-class public opinion sensed a common &quot;special relationship&quot; between the two peoples based on their shared language, migrations, evangelical Protestantism, classical liberalism and extensive private trade. That constituency rejected war, which forced Britain to appease America. During the Trent Affair of late 1861, London drew the line, and Washington retreated.

Troops from both nations had begun fighting side by side, sometimes spontaneously in skirmishes overseas by 1859, and both liberal democracies shared a common bond of sacrifice during the First World War (though the US was never formally a member of the Allies but entered the war in 1917 as a self-styled &quot;Associated Power&quot;). British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s visit to the US in 1930 confirmed his own belief in the &quot;special relationship&quot; and so he looked to the Washington Naval Treaty, rather than a revival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, as the guarantee of peace in the Far East.

However, as the historian David Reynolds observed, &quot;For most of the period since 1919, Anglo-American relations had been cool and often suspicious. United States &#x27;betrayal&#x27; of the League of Nations was only the first in a series of US actions—over war debts, naval rivalry, the 1931–2 Manchurian crisis and the Depression—that convinced British leaders that the United States could not be relied on&quot;. Equally, as US President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, recalled, &quot;Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America—our common language and history ensured that. But unique did not mean affectionate. We had fought England as an enemy as often as we had fought by her side as an ally&quot;.

==Churchillian emphasis==
The outbreak of World War II provoked the rapid emergence of an unambiguously positive relationship between the two nations. The Fall of France in 1940 has been described as a decisive event in international relations, which led the Special Relationship to displace the Entente Cordiale as the pivot of the international system. During the war, one observer noted, &quot;Great Britain and the United States integrated their military efforts to a degree unprecedented among major allies in the history of warfare&quot;. &quot;Each time I must choose between you and Roosevelt&quot;, Churchill shouted at General Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French, in 1945, &quot;I shall choose Roosevelt&quot;. Between 1939 and 1945, Churchill and Roosevelt exchanged 1,700 letters and telegrams and met 11 times. Churchill estimated that they had 120 days of close personal contact. On one occasion, Roosevelt went to Churchill&#x27;s room when Churchill had just emerged from the bath. On his return from Washington, Churchill said to King George VI, &quot;Sir, I believe I am the only man in the world to have received the head of a nation naked&quot;. Roosevelt found the encounter amusing and remarked to his private secretary, Grace Tully, &quot;You know, he&#x27;s pink and white all over&quot;.Churchill&#x27;s mother was a US citizen, and he keenly felt the links between the two English-speaking peoples. He first used the term &quot;special relationship&quot; on 16 February 1944, when he said it was his &quot;deepest conviction that unless Britain and the United States are joined in a special relationship... another destructive war will come to pass&quot;. He used it again in 1945 to describe not the Anglo–American relationship alone but Britain&#x27;s relationship with both the Americans and the Canadians. &quot;The New York Times Herald&quot; quoted Churchill in November 1945:

Churchill used the phrase again a year later, at the onset of the Cold War, this time to note the special relationship between the US and the English-speaking nations of the British Commonwealth and the Empire. The occasion was his &quot;Sinews of Peace Address&quot;, delivered in Fulton, Missouri, on 5 March 1946:

In the opinion of one international relations specialist, &quot;the United Kingdom&#x27;s success in obtaining US commitment to cooperation in the postwar world was a major triumph, given the isolation of the interwar period&quot;. A senior British diplomat in Moscow, Thomas Brimelow, admitted, &quot;The one quality which most disquiets the Soviet government is the ability which they attribute to us to get others to do our fighting for us... they respect not us, but our ability to collect friends&quot;. Conversely, &quot;the success or failure of United States foreign economic peace aims depended almost entirely on its ability to win or extract the co-operation of Great Britain&quot;.

Reflecting on the symbiosis, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1982 declared: &quot;The Anglo-American relationship has done more for the defence and future of freedom than any other alliance in the world&quot;.

While most government officials on both sides have supported the Special Relationship, there have been sharp critics. The British journalist Guy Arnold (1932–2020) denounced it in 2014 as a &quot;sickness in the body politic of Britain that needs to be flushed out&quot;. Instead, he called for closer relationships with Europe and Russia so as to rid &quot;itself of the US incubus&quot;.

==Military co-operation==
The intense level of military co-operation between the UK and the US began with the creation of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in December 1941, a military command with authority over all American and British operations. After the end of the Second World War, the joint command structure was disbanded, but close military cooperation between the nations resumed in the early 1950s with the start of the Cold War. The Tizard Mission catalyzed Allied technological cooperation during World War II.

===Shared military bases===
Since the Second World War and the subsequent Berlin Blockade, the US has maintained substantial forces in Britain. In July 1948, the first American deployment began with the stationing of B-29 bombers. Currently, an important base is the radar facility RAF Fylingdales, part of the US Ballistic Missile Early Warning System although the base is operated under British command and has only one US Air Force representative, largely for administrative reasons. Several bases with a significant US presence include RAF Menwith Hill (only a short distance from RAF Fylingdales), RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall (scheduled to close in 2027), RAF Fairford (the only base for US strategic bombers in Europe), RAF Croughton (not an air base but a military communications hub) and RAF Welford (an ammunition storage depot).

Following the end of the Cold War, which was the main rationale for their presence, the number of US facilities in the UK has been reduced in number in line with the US military worldwide. However, the bases have been used extensively in support of various peacekeeping and offensive operations of the 1990s and the early 21st century.

The two nations also jointly operate on the British military facilities of Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territory and on Ascension Island, a dependency of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean. The US Navy also makes occasional use of British naval bases at Gibraltar and Bermuda, and the US Air Force uses RAF Akrotiri on Cyprus, mainly for reconnaissance flights.

===Nuclear weapons development===

The Quebec Agreement of 1943 paved the way for the two countries to develop atomic weapons side by side, the British handing over vital documents from its own Tube Alloys project and sending a delegation to assist in the work of the Manhattan Project. The Americans later kept the results of the work to themselves under the postwar McMahon Act, but after the UK developed its own thermonuclear weapons, the US agreed to supply delivery systems, designs and nuclear material for British warheads through the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.

The UK purchased first the Polaris system and then the US Trident system, which remains in use. The 1958 agreement gave the UK access to the facilities at the Nevada Test Site, and from 1963, it conducted a total of 21 underground tests there before the cessation of testing in 1991. The agreement under which the partnership operates was updated in 2004; anti-nuclear activists argued that the renewal may breach the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The US and the UK jointly conducted subcritical nuclear experiments in 2002 and 2006 to determine the effectiveness of existing stocks, as permitted under the 1998 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.

===Military procurement===
The Reagan administration offered Britain the opportunity to purchase the F-117 Nighthawk stealth aircraft while it was a black program. The UK is the only collaborative, or Level One, international partner in the largest US aircraft procurement project in history, the F-35 Lightning II program. The UK was involved in writing the specification and selection and its largest defense contractor, BAE Systems, is a partner of the American prime contractor Lockheed Martin. BAE Systems is also the largest foreign supplier to the US Defense Department and has been permitted to buy important US defense companies like Lockheed Martin Aerospace Electronic Systems and United Defense.

The US operates several British designs including Chobham Armour, the Harrier GR9/AV-8B Harrier II and the US Navy T-45 Goshawk. The UK also operates several American designs, including the Javelin anti-tank missile, M270 rocket artillery, the Apache gunship, C-130 Hercules and C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft.

==Other areas of co-operation==
===Intelligence sharing===

A cornerstone of the Special Relationship is the collecting and sharing of intelligence, which originated during the Second World War with the sharing of code-breaking knowledge and led to the 1943 BRUSA Agreement, which was signed at Bletchley Park. After the war, the common goal of monitoring and countering the threat of communism prompted the UK-USA Security Agreement of 1948. This agreement brought together the SIGINT organizations of the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and is still in place today (Five Eyes). The head of the Central Intelligence Agency station in London attends each weekly meeting of the British Joint Intelligence Committee.

One present-day example of such cooperation is the UKUSA Community, comprising America&#x27;s National Security Agency, Britain&#x27;s Government Communications Headquarters, Australia&#x27;s Defence Signals Directorate and Canada&#x27;s Communications Security Establishment, which collaborate on ECHELON, a global intelligence gathering system. Under the classified bilateral accords, UKUSA members do not spy on each other.

After the discovery of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, the CIA began to assist the Security Service (MI5) by running its own agent networks in the British Pakistani community. One intelligence official commented on the threat against the US from British Islamists: &quot;The fear is that something like this would not just kill people but cause a historic rift between the US and the UK&quot;.

===Economic policy===
The US is the largest source of foreign direct investment to the UK, and the UK is likewise the largest single foreign direct investor in the US. British trade and capital have been important components of the American economy since its colonial inception. In trade and finance, the Special Relationship has been described as &quot;well-balanced&quot;, with the City of London&#x27;s regulation in recent years attracting a massive outflow of capital from Wall Street. The key sectors for British exporters to America are aviation, aerospace, commercial property, chemicals and pharmaceuticals and heavy machinery.

British ideas, classical and modern, have also exerted a profound influence on American economic policy, most notably those of the historian Adam Smith on free trade and the economist John Maynard Keynes on countercyclical spending. American and British investors share entrepreneurial attitudes towards the housing market, and the fashion and music industries of both countries are major influences on each other. Trade ties have been strengthened by globalisation, and both governments agree on the need for currency reform in China and for educational reform at home to increase their competitiveness. In 2007, US Ambassador Robert H. Tuttle suggested to British business leaders that the Special Relationship could be used &quot;to promote world trade and limit environmental damage as well as combating terrorism&quot;.

In a press conference that made several references to the Special Relationship, US Secretary of State John Kerry, in London with UK Foreign Secretary William Hague on 9 September 2013, said:

==History==
Prior to their collaboration during World War II, Anglo–American relations had been more stand-offish. President Woodrow Wilson and Prime Minister David Lloyd George in Paris had been the first leaders of the two nations to meet face-to-face, but had enjoyed nothing that could be described as a &quot;special relationship&quot;, although Lloyd George&#x27;s wartime Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, got on well with Wilson during his time in the US and helped convince the previously skeptical president to enter World War I. Britain, previously somewhat the predominant partner out of the two countries, had found itself in a more of a secondary role beginning in 1941.

The personal relations between British prime ministers and U.S. presidents have often affected the Special Relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. The first example was the close relationship between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt, who were in fact distantly related. Churchill spent much time and effort cultivating the relationship, which had a positive impact on the war effort. Two great architects of the Special Relationship on a practical level were Field Marshal Sir John Dill and General George Marshall, whose excellent personal relations and senior positions (Roosevelt was especially close to Marshall) helped to strengthen the alliance. Major links were created during the war, such as the Combined Chiefs of Staff.

The diplomatic policy behind the Special Relationship was two-pronged, encompassing strong personal support between heads of state and equally forthright military and political aid. The most cordial personal relationships between British prime ministers and American presidents have always been those based around shared goals. Peaks in the Special Relationship include the bonds between Harold Macmillan (who like Churchill had an American mother) and John F. Kennedy; between James Callaghan and Jimmy Carter, who were close personal friends despite their differences in personality; between Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan; and more recently between Tony Blair and both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Low points in the relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. have occurred due to disagreements over foreign policy, such as Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s opposition to U.K. operations in Suez under Anthony Eden and Harold Wilson&#x27;s refusal to enter the war in Vietnam.

===Timeline===
===Churchill and Roosevelt (May 1940 – April 1945)===
When Winston Churchill entered the office of prime minister, the UK had already entered World War II. Immediately at the start of Churchill&#x27;s premiership, the Battle of Dunkirk took place.

Before Churchill&#x27;s premiership, President Roosevelt had secretively been in frequent correspondence with him. Their correspondence had begun in September 1939, at the very start of World War II. In these private communications, the two had been discussing ways in which the US might support Britain in their war effort. However, at the time when Winston Churchill assumed the office of prime minister, Roosevelt was nearing the end of his second term and making considerations of seeking election to an unprecedented third term (he would make no public pronouncements about this until the Democratic National Convention that year). From the American experience during the First World War, Roosevelt judged that involvement in the Second World War was likely to be an inevitability. This was a key reason for Roosevelt&#x27;s decision to break from tradition and seek a third term. Roosevelt desired to be president when the US would finally be drawn into entering the conflict. However, in order to win a third term, Roosevelt made the American people promises that he would keep them out of the war.

In November 1940, upon Roosevelt&#x27;s victory in the presidential election, Churchill sent him a congratulatory letter,

Having promised the American public to avoid entering any foreign war, Roosevelt went as far as public opinion allowed in providing financial and military aid to Britain, France and China. In a December 1940 talk, dubbed the &quot;Arsenal of Democracy Speech&quot;, Roosevelt declared, &quot;This is not a fireside chat on war. It is a talk about national security&quot;. He went on to declare the importance of American support of Britain&#x27;s war effort, framing it as a matter of national security for the U.S. As the American public opposed involvement in the conflict, Roosevelt sought to emphasize that it was critical to assist the British in order to prevent the conflict from reaching American shores. He aimed to paint the British war effort as beneficial to the US by arguing that they would contain the Nazi threat from spreading across the Atlantic.


To assist the British war effort, Roosevelt enacted the Lend-Lease policy and drafted the Atlantic Charter with Churchill. The US ultimately joined the war effort in December 1941, under Roosevelt&#x27;s leadership.

Roosevelt and Churchill had a relative fondness of one another. They connected on their shared passions for tobacco and liquors, and their mutual interest in history and battleships. Churchill later wrote, &quot;I felt I was in contact with a very great man, who was also a warm-hearted friend, and the foremost champion of the high causes which we served.&quot;

One anecdote that has been told to illustrate the intimacy of Churchill and Roosevelt&#x27;s bond alleges that once, while hosting Churchill at the White House, Roosevelt stopped by the bedroom in which the Prime Minister was staying to converse with him. Churchill answered his door in a state of nudity, remarking, &quot;You see, Mr. President, I have nothing to hide from you.&quot; The president is said to have taken this in good humor, later joking with an aide that Churchill was, &quot;pink and white all over.&quot; Between 1939 and 1945, Roosevelt and Churchill exchanged an estimated 1700 letters and telegrams and met with one another 11 times. On Churchill&#x27;s 70th birthday, Roosevelt wrote him, &quot;It is fun to be in the same decade as you.&quot; Beginning under Roosevelt and Churchill, the U.S. and U.K. worked together closely to establish the IMF, World Bank and NATO.

===Churchill and Truman (April 1945 – July 1945)===
Roosevelt died in April 1945, shortly into his fourth term in office, and was succeeded by his vice president, Harry Truman. Churchill and Truman likewise developed a strong relationship with one another. While he was saddened by the death of Roosevelt, Churchill was a strong supporter of Truman in his early presidency, calling him, &quot;the type of leader the world needs when it needs him most.&quot; At the Potsdam Conference, Truman and Churchill, along with Joseph Stalin, made agreements for settling the boundaries of Europe.
===Attlee and Truman (July 1945 – October 1951)===
Four months into Truman&#x27;s presidency, Churchill&#x27;s party was handed a surprise defeat at the polls, and Clement Attlee became prime minister.

The deputy in Churchill&#x27;s wartime coalition government, Attlee had been in the US at the time of Roosevelt&#x27;s death, and thus had met with Truman immediately after he took office. The two of them had come to like one another. However, Attlee and Truman never became particularly close with one another. During their coinciding tenure as heads of government, they only met on three occasions. The two did not maintain regular correspondence. Their working relationship with each other, nonetheless, remained sturdy.

When Attlee assumed the position of prime minister, negotiations had not yet been completed at the Potsdam Conference, which had begun on 17 July. Attlee took Churchill&#x27;s place at the conference once he was named prime minister on 26 July. Therefore, Attlee&#x27;s first sixteen days as prime minister were spent handling negotiations at the conference. Attlee flew to Washington in December 1950 to support Truman in standing up against Douglas MacArthur. In 1951, Truman pressured Attlee not to intervene against Mossadeq in Iran. In his time as prime minister, Attlee also managed to convince Truman to agree to greater nuclear cooperation.

===Churchill and Truman (October 1951 – January 1953)===
Churchill became prime minister again in October 1951. He had maintained his relationship with Truman during his six-year stint as Leader of the Opposition. In 1946, on invitation from Truman, Churchill visited the U.S. to deliver a speech at Westminster College in Truman&#x27;s home state of Missouri. The speech, which would be remembered as the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; speech, affected greater public attention to the schism that had developed between the Soviet Union and the rest of the Allied Powers. During this trip, Churchill lost a significant amount of cash in a poker game with Harry Truman and his advisors. In 1947, Churchill had written Truman an unheeded memo recommending that the US make a pre-emptive atomic bomb strike on Moscow before the Soviet Union could acquire nuclear weapons themselves.

Churchill and Eden visited Washington in January 1952. At the time, Truman&#x27;s administration was supporting plans for a European Defence Community in hopes that it would allow West Germany to undergo rearmament, consequentially enabling the U.S. to decrease the number of American troops stationed in Germany. Churchill opposed the EDC, feeling that it could not work. He also asked, unsuccessfully, for the US to commit its forces to supporting Britain in Egypt and the Middle East. This had no appeal for Truman. Truman expected the British to assist the Americans in their fight against communist forces in Korea, but felt that supporting the British in the Middle East would be assisting them in their efforts to prevent decolonization, which would do nothing to thwart communism. Truman opted not to seek re-election in 1952, and his presidency ended in January 1953.

===Churchill and Eisenhower (January 1953 – April 1955)===
Dwight D. Eisenhower and Churchill were both familiar with one another, as they had both been significant leaders of the Allied effort during World War II.

On January 5, 1953, when Eisenhower was president-elect, Winston Churchill had a series of meetings with Eisenhower during a visit by Churchill to the United States. Relations were strained during Eisenhower&#x27;s presidency by Eisenhower&#x27;s outrage over Churchill&#x27;s half-baked attempt to set up a &quot;parley at the summit&quot; with Joseph Stalin.
===Eden and Eisenhower (April 1955 – January 1957)===
Similarly to his predecessor, Anthony Eden had worked closely with Eisenhower during World War II.

====Suez Crisis====
When Eden took office, Gamal Abdel Nasser had built up Egyptian nationalism. Nasser seized control of the vital Suez Canal in July 1956. Eden made a secret agreement with France and Israel to invade Egypt. Eisenhower had repeatedly warned Eden that the US would not accept British military intervention. When the invasion came anyway, the US denounced it at the United Nations, and used financial power to force the British to completely withdraw. Britain lost its prestige and its powerful role in Mid-Eastern affairs, to be replaced by the Americans. Eden, in poor health, was forced to retire.
===Macmillan and Eisenhower (January 1957 – January 1961)===
Once he took office, Harold Macmillan worked to undo the strain that the Special Relationship had incurred in the preceding years. Macmillan famously quipped that it was Britain&#x27;s historical duty to guide the power of the US as the ancient Greeks had the Romans. He endeavoured to broaden the Special Relationship beyond Churchill&#x27;s conception of an English-Speaking Union into a more inclusive &quot;Atlantic Community&quot;. His key theme, &quot;of the interdependence of the nations of the Free World and the partnership which must be maintained between Europe and the United States&quot;, was one that Kennedy subsequently took up.

However, Eisenhower increased tension with the UK by sabotaging Macmillan&#x27;s policy of détente with the Soviet Union at the May 1960 Paris summit.
===Macmillan and Kennedy (January 1961 – October 1963)===
Kennedy was an anglophile. His father had previously served as the US ambassador to the UK and his sister had been Marchioness of Hartington, whose husband was incidentally the nephew of Macmillan&#x27;s wife.

British intelligence assisted the US in assessing the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy appreciated Macmillan&#x27;s steady leadership, and admired his Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

====Skybolt crisis====

The Special Relationship was perhaps tested the most severely by the Skybolt crisis of 1962, when Kennedy cancelled a joint project without consultation. Skybolt was a nuclear air-to-ground missile that could penetrate Soviet airspace and would extend the life of Britain&#x27;s deterrent, which consisted only of free-falling hydrogen bombs. London saw cancellation as a reduction in the British nuclear deterrent. The crisis was resolved during a series of compromises that led to the Royal Navy purchasing the American UGM-27 Polaris missile and construction of the Resolution-class submarines to launch them. The debates over Skybolt were top secret, but tensions were exacerbated when Dean Acheson, a former Secretary of State, challenged publicly the Special Relationship and marginalised the British contribution to the Western alliance. Acheson said:

On learning of Acheson&#x27;s attack, Macmillan thundered in public:

The looming collapse of the alliance between the two thermonuclear powers forced Kennedy into an about-face at the Anglo-American summit in Nassau, where he agreed to sell Polaris as a replacement for the cancelled Skybolt. Richard E. Neustadt in his official investigation concluded the crisis in the Special Relationship had erupted because &quot;the president&#x27;s &#x27;Chiefs&#x27; failed to make a proper strategic assessment of Great Britain&#x27;s intentions and its capabilities&quot;.

The Skybolt crisis with Kennedy came on top of Eisenhower&#x27;s wrecking of Macmillan&#x27;s policy of détente with the Soviet Union at the May 1960 Paris summit, and the prime minister&#x27;s resulting disenchantment with the Special Relationship contributed to his decision to seek an alternative in British membership of the European Economic Community (EEC). According to a recent analyst: &quot;What the prime minister in effect adopted was a &quot;hedging strategy&quot; in which ties with Washington would be maintained while at the same time a new power base in Europe was sought.&quot; Even so, Kennedy assured Macmillan &quot;that relations between the United States and the UK would be strengthened not weakened, if the UK moved towards membership.&quot;

===Douglas-Home and Kennedy (October 1963– November 1963)===
Alec Douglas-Home only entered the race to replace the resigning Macmillan as Leader of the Conservative Party after learning from the British ambassador to the US that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Quintin Hogg being prime minister. Douglas-Home, however, would only serve as prime minister for a little over a month before Kennedy was assassinated.

In England, Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in November 1963 caused a profound shock and sadness expressed by many politicians, religious leaders, and luminaries of literature and the arts. The Archbishop of Canterbury led a memorial service at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Sir Laurence Olivier at the end of his next performance called for a moment of silence, followed by a playing of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot;. Prime Minister Douglas-Home led parliamentary tributes to Kennedy, whom he called, &quot;the most loyal and faithful of allies.&quot; Douglas-Home was visibly upset during his remarks, as he was truly saddened by Kennedy&#x27;s death. He had liked Kennedy, and had begun to establish a positive working relationship with him.

After his assassination, the British government sought approval to build a memorial to President Kennedy, in part to demonstrate the strength of the Special Relationship. However, the weak popular response to its ambitious fundraising campaign was a surprise, and suggested a grassroots opposition to the late president, his policies, and the United States.

===Douglas-Home and Johnson (November 1963 – October 1964)===

Douglas-Home had a far more tense relationship with Kennedy&#x27;s successor, Lyndon B. Johnson. Douglas-Home failed to develop a good relationship with Lyndon Johnson. Their governments had a serious disagreement on the question of British trade with Cuba.

Relations between the two nations worsened after British Leyland busses were sold to Cuba, thus undermining the effectiveness of the United States embargo against Cuba. Douglas-Home&#x27;s Conservative Party lost the 1964 general election, thus he lost his position as prime minister. He had only served as prime minister for 363 days, the U.K.&#x27;s second shortest premiership of the twentieth century. Despite its unusual brevity (and due to the assassination of Kennedy), Douglas-Home&#x27;s tenure had overlapped with two US presidencies.

===Wilson and Johnson (October 1964 – January 1969)===
Prime Minister Harold Wilson recast the alliance as a &quot;close relationship&quot;, but neither he nor President Lyndon B. Johnson had any direct experience of foreign policy. Johnson sent Secretary of State Dean Rusk as head of the American delegation to the state funeral of Winston Churchill in January 1965, rather than the new vice president Hubert Humphrey. Johnson himself had been hospitalized with influenza and advised by his doctors against attending the funeral. This perceived slight generated much criticism against the president, both in the U.K. and in the U.S. And Wilson&#x27;s attempt to mediate in Vietnam, where the United Kingdom was co-chairman with the Soviet Union of the Geneva Conference, was unwelcome to the president. &quot;I won&#x27;t tell you how to run Malaysia and you don&#x27;t tell us how to run Vietnam&quot;, Johnson snapped in 1965. However, relations were sustained by U.S. recognition that Wilson was being criticised at home by his neutralist Labour left for not condemning American involvement in the war.

U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara asked Britain to send troops to Vietnam as &quot;the unwritten terms of the Special Relationship&quot;, Wilson agreed to help in many ways but refused to commit regular forces, only special forces instructors. Australia and New Zealand did commit regular forces to Vietnam.

The Johnson administration&#x27;s support for IMF loans delayed devaluation of sterling until 1967. The United Kingdom&#x27;s subsequent withdrawal from the Persian Gulf and East Asia surprised Washington, where it was strongly opposed because British forces were valued for their contribution. In retrospect Wilson&#x27;s moves to scale back Britain&#x27;s global commitments and correct its balance of payments contrasted with Johnson&#x27;s overexertions which accelerated the relative economic and military decline of the US.

===Wilson and Nixon (January 1969 – June 1970)===
By the time Richard Nixon had taken office, many issues of tension between the two nations had been resolved. This allowed for the Special Relationship to blossom.

In a speech delivered on 27 January 1970 at a state dinner welcoming the Prime Minister in his visit to the US Nixon said,

===Heath and Nixon (June 1970 – March 1974)===
A Europeanist, Prime Minister Edward Heath preferred to speak of a natural relationship&#x27;, based on shared culture and heritage&quot;, and stressed that the Special Relationship was &quot;not part of his own vocabulary&quot;.

The Heath–Nixon era was dominated by the United Kingdom&#x27;s 1973 entry into the European Economic Community (EEC). Although the two leaders&#x27; 1971 Bermuda communiqué restated that entry served the interests of the Atlantic Alliance, American observers voiced concern that the British government&#x27;s membership would impair its role as an honest broker, and that, because of the European goal of political union, the Special Relationship would only survive if it included the whole Community.

Critics accused President Nixon of impeding the EEC&#x27;s inclusion in the Special Relationship by his economic policy, which dismantled the postwar international monetary system and sought to force open European markets for US exports. Detractors also slated the personal relationship at the top as &quot;decidedly less than special&quot;; Prime Minister Edward Heath, it was alleged, &quot;hardly dared put through a phone call to Richard Nixon for fear of offending his new Common Market partners.&quot;

The Special Relationship was &quot;soured&quot; during the Arab–Israeli War of 1973 when Nixon failed to inform Heath that US forces had been put on DEFCON 3 in a worldwide standoff with the Soviet Union, and US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger misled the British ambassador over the nuclear alert. Heath, who learned about the alert only from press reports hours later, confessed: &quot;I have found considerable alarm as to what use the Americans would have been able to make of their forces here without in any way consulting us or considering the British interests.&quot; The incident marked &quot;a low ebb&quot; in the Special Relationship.

===Wilson and Nixon (March 1974 – August 1974)===
Wilson and Nixon once again concurrently served as leaders of the two nations for a six-month period spanning from the start of Wilson&#x27;s second tenure as Prime Minister until Nixon&#x27;s resignation. Wilson held Nixon in high regard. After he left office himself, Wilson praised Nixon as America&#x27;s &quot;most able&quot; president.
===Wilson and Ford (August 1974 – April 1976)===
Gerald Ford became president after Nixon&#x27;s resignation. In a toast to Wilson at a January 1975 state dinner, Ford remarked,

===Callaghan and Ford (April 1976 – January 1977)===
In April 1976, James Callaghan became prime minister after Wilson resigned the office. Ford and Callaghan were regarded as having a close relationship.

The British government saw the U.S. bicentennial in 1976 as an occasion to celebrate the Special Relationship. Political leaders and guests from both sides of the Atlantic gathered in May at Westminster Hall to mark the American Declaration of Independence of 1776. Prime Minister James Callaghan presented a visiting Congressional delegation with a gold-embossed reproduction of Magna Carta, symbolising the common heritage of the two nations. British historian Esmond Wright noted &quot;a vast amount of popular identification with the American story&quot;. A year of cultural exchanges and exhibitions culminated in July in a state visit to the United States by the Queen.

Ford lost the 1976 election. Consequentially, his presidency ended in January 1977. President Ford had never managed to visit the United Kingdom during his presidency.
===Callaghan and Carter (January 1977 – May 1979)===
After defeating the incumbent Gerald Ford in the 1976 election, Jimmy Carter was sworn in as President of the United States in January 1977. Ties between Callaghan and Carter were cordial but, with both left of centre governments being preoccupied with economic malaise, diplomatic contacts remained low key. US officials characterised relations in 1978 as &quot;extremely good&quot;, with the main disagreement being over trans-Atlantic air routes.

During Callaghan&#x27;s March 1977 visit to the White House, Carter affirmed that there was both a, &#x27;special relationship&quot; and an &quot;unbreakable friendship&quot; between the two nations, declaring that, &quot;Great Britain is still America&#x27;s mother country.&quot; During this meeting, Callaghan praised Carter for enhancing, &quot;the political tone of the world&quot;.

The economic malaise that Callaghan was facing at home developed into the &quot;Winter of Discontent&quot;, which ultimately led to Callaghan&#x27;s Labour Party losing the May 1979 general election, thus ending his tenure as prime minister.
===Thatcher and Carter (May 1979 – January 1981)===
Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher became prime minister after her party won the 1979 United Kingdom general election. Relations between President Carter and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during the year-and-a-half overlap of their leadership have often been seen as relatively cool, especially when contrasted with the kinship that Thatcher would subsequently develop with Carter&#x27;s successor Ronald Reagan. However, Carter&#x27;s relationship with Thatcher never reached the levels of strain that Reagan&#x27;s relationship would in the midst of the Falklands War.

Thatcher and Carter had clear differences in their political ideology. They both occupied relatively opposing ends of the political spectrum. By the time she had become prime minister, Thatcher had already met Carter on two previous occasions. Both of these encounters had initially left Carter with a negative impression of her. However, his opinion of Thatcher had reportedly become more placid by the time she was elected prime minister. Despite the tensions between the two, historian Chris Collins (of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation) has stated, &quot;Carter is somebody she worked hard to get along with. She had considerable success at it. Had Carter lasted two terms we might be writing about the surprising amount of common ground between the two.&quot;

Carter congratulated Thatcher in a phone call after her party&#x27;s victory in the general which elevated her to the office of prime minister, stating that the United States would, &quot;look forward to working with you on an official basis.&quot; However, his congratulations was delivered with an audibly unenthusiastic tone. In her first full letter to Carter, Thatcher voiced her assurance of full support in the ratification of the SALT II nuclear arms treaty writing, &quot;We will do all we can to assist you&quot;.

Both leaders were mutually facing great pressures during the overlap of their tenures as a national leader. Both of their nations were experiencing economic crisis due to the early 1980s recession. In addition, there was international upheaval in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Among the areas of turmoil were Afghanistan (due to the Soviet–Afghan War) and Iran (where Carter was facing a hostage crisis following the Iranian Revolution).

Both Carter and Thatcher condemned the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. They expressed concern to each other that other European nations were being too soft towards the Russians. Carter hoped that she could persuade other European nations to condemn the invasion. However, with a particularly tumultuous economic situation at home, and with most NATO members reluctant to cut trade ties with the USSR, Thatcher would only provide very weak support to Carter&#x27;s efforts to punish the USSR through economic sanctions.

Thatcher was concerned that Carter was naive about Soviet relations. Nevertheless, Thatcher played a (perhaps pivotal) role in fulfilling Carter&#x27;s desire for the U.N. adoption of a resolution demanding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Thatcher also encouraged British athletes to participate in the boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which Carter initiated in response to the invasion. However, Thatcher ultimately gave the country&#x27;s Olympic Committee and individual athletes the choice to decide whether or not they would boycott the games. The United Kingdom ended up participating in the 1980 games, albeit with a smaller delegation due to individual athletes deciding to participate in boycotting the games.

In their correspondences, Thatcher expressed sympathy to Carter&#x27;s troubled efforts to resolve the hostage crisis in Iran. However, she outright refused his request for her to decrease the presence of the British embassy in Iran. Thatcher provided Carter with praise on his handling of the US economy, sending him a letter endorsing his measures in handling economic inflation and in cutting gas consumption during the 1979 energy crisis as, &quot;painful but necessary&quot;.

In October 1979 Thatcher wrote Carter, &quot;I share your concern about Cuban and Soviet intentions in the Caribbean. This danger exists more widely in the developing world. It is essential that the Soviet Union should recognise your resolve in this matter. […] I am therefore especially encouraged by your statement that you are accelerating efforts to increase the capability of the United States to use its military forces world wide.&quot;

Also October 1979 there was a dispute over Thatcher&#x27;s government&#x27;s provision of funding for BBC&#x27;s external services. In desperation, the BBC contacted United States Ambassador Kingman Brewster Jr. to request that the US government endorse them in their fight against spending cuts. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski discussed this request with the State Department, and even drafted a letter for Carter to send Thatcher. However, Brzezinski ultimately decided against advising Carter to involve himself in the BBC&#x27;s efforts to lobby against budget cuts. During her December 1979 visit to the United States, Thatcher chastised Carter for not permitting the sale of arsenal to equip the Royal Ulster Constabulary. During this visit, she delivered a speech in which a lack of warmth towards Carter was evident. While Thatcher likely favoured her ideological counterpart Ronald Reagan to win the 1980 election (in which he defeated Carter), she was cautious to avoid voicing any such preference, even in private.

===Thatcher and Reagan (January 1981 – January 1989)===

The personal friendship between President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher united them as &quot;ideological soul-mates&quot;. They shared a commitment to the philosophy of the free market, low taxes, limited government, and a strong defence; they rejected détente and were determined to win the Cold War with the Soviet Union. However, they did have disagreements on internal social policies such as the AIDS epidemic and abortion. Thatcher summed up her understanding of the Special Relationship at her first meeting with Reagan as president in 1981: &quot;Your problems will be our problems and when you look for friends we shall be there.&quot;

Celebrating the 200th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 1985, Thatcher enthused:

Reagan, in turn, acknowledged:

In 1982, Thatcher and Reagan reached an agreement to replace the British Polaris fleet with a force equipped with US-supplied Trident missiles. The confidence between the two principals appeared momentarily strained by Reagan&#x27;s belated support in the Falklands War, but this was more than countered by the Anglophile American Defense Secretary, Caspar Weinberger, who provided strong support in intelligence and munitions. It has since been revealed that while publicly claiming neutrality in the dispute between Argentina and Britain over the Falkland Islands, Reagan had approved a top-secret plan to loan a U.S. aircraft carrier to the British in the event that Argentine forces managed to sink one of the British carriers, and had told Weinberger to: &quot;Give Maggie everything she needs to get on with it.&quot;

A July 2012 article by USNI News of the United States Naval Institute revealed that the Reagan Administration offered the use of the USS &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; as a replacement in case either of the two British carriers, and , had been damaged or destroyed during the 1982 Falklands War. This top-secret contingency plan was revealed to the staff of the Naval Institute by John Lehman, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy at the time of the Falklands War, from a speech provided to the Naval Institute that Lehman made in Portsmouth, UK on 26 June 2012. Lehman stated that the loan of &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was made in response to a request from the Royal Navy, and it had the endorsement of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. The actual planning for the loan of &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was done by the staff of the U.S. Second Fleet under the direction of Vice Admiral James Lyons, who confirmed Lehman&#x27;s revelations with the Naval Institute staff. Contingency planning envisioned American military contractors, likely retired sailors with knowledge of &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;″s systems, assisting the British in manning the U.S. helicopter carrier during the loan-out. Naval analyst Eric Wertheim compared this arrangement to the Flying Tigers. Significantly, except for U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, the U.S. Department of State was not included in the loan-out negotiations.
In 1986 Washington asked permission to use British airbases in order to bomb Libya in retaliation for the 1986 West Berlin discotheque bombing by Libyan terrorists that killed two U.S. servicemen. The British cabinet was opposed and Thatcher herself was worried it would lead to widespread attacks on British interests in the Middle East. That did not happen, and instead Libyan terrorism fell off sharply. Furthermore, although British public opinion was highly negative, Britain won widespread praise in the United States at a time when Spain and France had vetoed American requests to fly over their territories.

A more serious disagreement came in 1983 when Washington did not consult with London on the invasion of Grenada. Grenada is part of the Commonwealth of Nations and, following the invasion, it requested help from other Commonwealth members. The intervention was opposed by Commonwealth members including the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, and Canada, among others. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a close ally of Reagan on other matters, personally opposed the U.S. invasion. Reagan told her it might happen; she did not know for sure it was coming until three hours before. At 12:30 on the morning of the invasion, Thatcher sent a message to Reagan:

Reagan told Thatcher before anyone else that the invasion would begin in a few hours, but ignored her complaints. She publicly supported the U.S. action. Reagan phoned to apologize for the miscommunication, and the long-term friendly relationship endured.

In 1986, the British defence secretary Michael Heseltine, a prominent critic of the Special Relationship and a supporter of European integration, resigned over his concern that a takeover of Britain&#x27;s last helicopter manufacturer by a US firm would harm the British defence industry. Thatcher herself also saw a potential risk to Britain&#x27;s deterrent and security posed by the Strategic Defense Initiative She was alarmed at Reagan&#x27;s proposal at the Reykjavík Summit to eliminate nuclear weapons, but was relieved when the proposal failed.

All in all, Britain&#x27;s needs figured more prominently in American thinking strategy than anyone else. Peter Hennessy, a leading historian, singles out the personal dynamic of &quot;Ron&quot; and &quot;Margaret&quot; in this success:

===Thatcher and George H. W. Bush (January 1989 – November 1990)===
In his personal diary, George H. W. Bush wrote that his first impression of Thatcher was she was principled but very difficult. Bush also wrote that Thatcher, &quot;talks all the time when you&#x27;re in a conversation. It&#x27;s a one-way street.&quot;

Despite having developed a warm relation with Reagan, whom Bush had served under as vice president, Thatcher never developed a similar sense of camaraderie with Bush. At the time that Bush took office in January 1989, having won the previous November&#x27;s presidential election, Thatcher was politically under siege from both her political opposition and forces within her own party.

Bush was anxious to manage the collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe in a manner that would produce order and stability. Bush, therefore, used a 1989 trip to Brussels to demonstrate the heightened attention that his administration planned to allocate towards US–German relations. Thus, rather than giving Thatcher the precedence which Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom were accustomed to receiving from US Presidents, he met with the president of the European Commission first, leaving Thatcher, &quot;cooling her heels&quot;. This irritated Thatcher.

In 1989, after Bush proposed a reduction in US troops stationed in Europe, Thatcher lectured Bush on the importance of freedom. Bush came out of this encounter asking, &quot;Why does she have any doubt that we feel this way on this issue?&quot;

In the midst of the invasion of Kuwait, Thatcher advised Bush that, &quot;this is no time to go wobbly.&quot; Thatcher lost her premiership in November 1990. However, to Bush&#x27;s displeasure, she continued attempting to involve herself in diplomacy between the West and the Soviet Union. Bush took particular offence to a speech Thatcher gave after leaving office in which she said that she and Ronald Reagan were responsible for ending the Cold War. Thatcher gave this speech, which snubbed the contributions that others had made, before an audience that included a number of individuals who had contributed to the ending the Cold War, such as Lech Wałęsa and Václav Havel. In reaction to this speech, Helmut Kohl sent Bush a note proclaiming that Thatcher was crazy.

===Major and George H. W. Bush (November 1990 – January 1993)===
As had started becoming apparent in Thatcher&#x27;s last few years of premiership, the Special Relationship had begun to wane for a time with the passing of the Cold War, despite intensive co-operation in the Gulf War. Thus, while it remained the case that, on nearly all issues, the United States and United Kingdom remained on the same side, to a degree greater than with their other close allies, it was also the case that, with the absence of the Soviet Union as a powerful shared threat, narrower disputes were able to arise with greater tensions than they previously would have merited.
===Major and Clinton (January 1993 – May 1997)===
Democratic President Bill Clinton intended to maintain the Special Relationship. But he and Major did not prove compatible.
The nuclear alliance was weakened when Clinton extended a moratorium on tests in the Nevada desert in 1993, and pressed Major to agree to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The freeze was described by a British defence minister as &quot;unfortunate and misguided&quot;, as it inhibited validation of the &quot;safety, reliability and effectiveness&quot; of fail-safe mechanisms on upgraded warheads for the British Trident II D5 missiles, and potentially the development of a new deterrent for the 21st century, leading Major to consider a return to Pacific Ocean testing. The Ministry of Defence turned to computer simulation.

A genuine crisis in transatlantic relations blew up over Bosnia. London and Paris resisted relaxation of the UN arms embargo, and discouraged U.S. escalation, arguing that arming the Muslims or bombing the Serbs could worsen the bloodshed and endanger their peacekeepers on the ground. US Secretary of State Warren Christopher&#x27;s campaign to lift the embargo was rebuffed by Major and President Mitterrand in May 1993. After the so-called &#x27;Copenhagen ambush&#x27; in June 1993, where Clinton &quot;ganged up&quot; with Chancellor Kohl to rally the European Community against the peacekeeping states, Major was said to be contemplating the death of the Special Relationship. The following month the United States voted at the UN with non-aligned countries against Britain and France over lifting the embargo.

By October 1993, Warren Christopher was bristling that Washington policy makers had been too &quot;Eurocentric&quot;, and declared that Western Europe was &quot;no longer the dominant area of the world&quot;. The U.S. ambassador to London, Raymond G.H. Seitz, demurred, insisting it was far too early to put a &quot;tombstone&quot; over the Special Relationship. A senior U.S. State Department official described Bosnia in the spring of 1995 as the worst crisis with the British and French since Suez. By the summer, U.S. officials were doubting whether NATO had a future.

The nadir had now been reached, and, along with NATO enlargement and the Croatian offensive in 1995 that opened the way for NATO bombing, the strengthening Clinton–Major relationship was later credited as one of three developments that saved the Western alliance. The president later acknowledged,

A rift opened in a further area. In February 1994, Major refused to answer Clinton&#x27;s telephone calls for days over his decision to grant Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams a visa to visit the United States to agitate. Adams was listed as a terrorist by London. The U.S. State Department, the CIA, the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI all opposed the move on the grounds that it made the United States look &quot;soft on terrorism&quot; and &quot;could do irreparable damage to the special relationship&quot;. Under pressure from Congress, the president hoped the visit would encourage the IRA to renounce violence. While Adams offered nothing new, and violence escalated within weeks, the president later claimed vindication after the IRA ceasefire of August 1994. To the disappointment of the prime minister, Clinton lifted the ban on official contacts and received Adams at the White House on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day 1995, despite the fact the paramilitaries had not agreed to disarm. The rows over Northern Ireland and the Adams affair reportedly &quot;provoked incandescent Clintonian rages&quot;.

In November 1995, Clinton became only the second US president ever to address both Houses of Parliament, but, by the end of Major&#x27;s premiership, disenchantment with the Special Relationship had deepened to the point where the incoming British ambassador Christopher Meyer banned the &quot;hackneyed phrase&quot; from the embassy.

===Blair and Clinton (May 1997 – January 2001)===
The election of British prime minister Tony Blair in 1997 brought an opportunity to revive what Clinton called the two nations&#x27; &quot;unique partnership&quot;. At his first meeting with his new partner, the president said: &quot;Over the last fifty years our unbreakable alliance has helped to bring unparalleled peace and prosperity and security. It&#x27;s an alliance based on shared values and common aspirations.&quot;

The personal relationship between the two leaders was seen as especially close because the leaders were considered to be &quot;kindred spirits&quot; in their domestic agendas. Both Blair and Clinton had repositioned their political parties to embrace centrism, pushing their parties away from the left, a tactic each had adopted in response to successive national election losses that their parties had incurred prior their leadership. New Labour&#x27;s third Way, a moderate social-democratic position, was partly influenced by United States New Democratic thinking that Clinton had helped to usher in.

Both Blair and Clinton were, each, the first of their generation (baby boomers) to lead their respective nation. Cooperation in defence and communications still had the potential to embarrass Blair, however, as he strove to balance it with his own leadership role in the European Union (EU). Enforcement of Iraqi no-fly zones and US bombing raids on Iraq dismayed EU partners. As the leading international proponent of humanitarian intervention, the &quot;hawkish&quot; Blair &quot;bullied&quot; Clinton to back diplomacy with force in Kosovo in 1999, pushing for deployment of ground troops to persuade the president &quot;to do whatever was necessary&quot; to win.

Clinton played a key role in the peace talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1998. The partnership between Blair and Clinton would later be the focus of the 2010 film The Special Relationship.

===Blair and George W. Bush (January 2001 – June 2007)===
The personal diplomacy of Blair and Clinton&#x27;s successor, US president George W. Bush in 2001, further served to highlight the Special Relationship. Despite their political differences on non-strategic matters, their shared beliefs and responses to the international situation formed a commonality of purpose following the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. Blair, like Bush, was convinced of the importance of moving against the perceived threat to world peace and international order, famously pledging to stand &quot;shoulder to shoulder&quot; with Bush:

Blair flew to Washington immediately after 9/11 to affirm British solidarity with the United States. In a speech to the United States Congress, nine days after the attacks, Bush declared &quot;America has no truer friend than Great Britain.&quot; Blair, one of the few world leaders to attend a presidential speech to Congress as a special guest of the First Lady, received two standing ovations from members of Congress. Blair&#x27;s presence at the presidential speech remains the only time in U.S. political history that a foreign leader was in attendance at an emergency joint session of the U.S. Congress, a testimony to the strength of the U.S.–U.K. alliance under the two leaders. Following that speech, Blair embarked on two months of diplomacy, rallying international support for military action. The BBC calculated that, in total, the prime minister held 54 meetings with world leaders and travelled more than .

Blair came to be considered Bush&#x27;s strongest foreign ally in regards to the Iraq War. Blair&#x27;s leadership role in the Iraq War helped him to sustain a strong relationship with Bush through to the end of his time as prime minister, but it was unpopular within his own party and lowered his public approval ratings. Some of the British press called Blair &quot;Bush&#x27;s poodle&quot;. It also alienated some of his European partners, including the leaders of France and Germany. Russian popular artist Mikhail Nikolayevich Zadornov mused that &quot;the position adopted by Britain towards America in the context of the Iraq War would be officially introduced into Kama Sutra.&quot; Blair felt he could defend his close personal relationship with Bush by claiming it had brought progress in the Middle East peace process, aid for Africa and climate-change diplomacy. However, it was not with Bush but with California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger that Blair ultimately succeeded in setting up a carbon-trading market, &quot;creating a model other states will follow&quot;.

The 2006 Lebanon War also exposed some minor differences in attitudes over the Middle East. The strong support offered by Blair and the Bush administration to Israel was not wholeheartedly shared by the British cabinet or the British public. On 27 July, Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett criticised the United States for &quot;ignoring procedure&quot; when using Prestwick Airport as a stop-off point for delivering laser-guided bombs to Israel.

===Brown and George W. Bush (June 2007 – January 2009)===
Although British Prime Minister Gordon Brown stated his support for the United States on assuming office in 2007, he appointed ministers to the Foreign Office who had been critical of aspects of the relationship or of recent US policy. A Whitehall source said: &quot;It will be more businesslike now, with less emphasis on the meeting of personal visions you had with Bush and Blair.&quot; British policy was that the relationship with the United States remained the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;most important bilateral relationship&quot;.

===Brown and Obama (January 2009 – May 2010)===
Prior to his election as US president in 2008, Barack Obama, suggesting that Blair and Britain had been let down by the Bush administration, declared: &quot;We have a chance to recalibrate the relationship and for the United Kingdom to work with America as a full partner.&quot;

On meeting Brown as president for the first time in March 2009, Obama reaffirmed that &quot;Great Britain is one of our closest and strongest allies and there is a link and bond there that will not break... This notion that somehow there is any lessening of that special relationship is misguided... The relationship is not only special and strong but will only get stronger as time goes on.&quot; Commentators, however, noted that the recurring use of &quot;special partnership&quot; by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs could be signaling an effort to recast terms.

The Special Relationship was also reported to be &quot;strained&quot; after a senior U.S. State Department official criticised a British decision to talk to the political wing of Hezbollah, complaining that the United States had not been properly informed. The protest came after the Obama administration had said it was prepared to talk to Hamas and at the same time as it was making overtures to Syria and Iran. A senior Foreign Office official responded: &quot;This should not have come as a shock to any official who might have been in the previous administration and is now in the current one.&quot;

In June 2009 the special relationship was reported to have &quot;taken another hit&quot; after the British government was said to be &quot;angry&quot; over the failure of the US to seek its approval before negotiating with Bermuda over the resettlement to the British overseas territory of four ex-Guantanamo Bay inmates wanted by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. A Foreign Office spokesman said: &#x27;It&#x27;s something that we should have been consulted about.&#x27; Asked whether the men might be sent back to Cuba, he replied: &quot;We are looking into all possible next steps.&quot; The move prompted an urgent security assessment by the British government. Shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague demanded an explanation from the incumbent, David Miliband, as comparisons were drawn with his previous embarrassment over the US use of Diego Garcia for extraordinary rendition without British knowledge, with one commentator describing the affair as &quot;a wake-up call&quot; and &quot;the latest example of American governments ignoring Britain when it comes to US interests in British territories abroad&quot;.

In August 2009, the Special Relationship was again reported to have &quot;taken another blow&quot; with the release on compassionate grounds of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the man convicted of the 1988 Lockerbie Bombing. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said &quot;it was absolutely wrong to release Abdelbaset al-Megrahi&quot;, adding &quot;We are still encouraging the Scottish authorities not to do so and hope they will not&quot;. Obama also commented that the release of al-Megrahi was a &quot;mistake&quot; and &quot;highly objectionable&quot;.

In March 2010, Hillary Clinton&#x27;s support for Argentina&#x27;s call for negotiations over the Falkland Islands triggered a series of diplomatic protests from Britain and renewed public scepticism about the value of the Special Relationship. The British government rejected Clinton&#x27;s offer of mediation after renewed tensions with Argentina were triggered by a British decision to drill for oil near the Falkland Islands. The British government&#x27;s long-standing position was that the Falklands were British territory, with all that this implied regarding the legitimacy of British commercial activities within its boundaries. British officials were therefore irritated by the implication that sovereignty was negotiable.

Later that month, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons suggested that the British government should be &quot;less deferential&quot; towards the United States and focus relations more on British interests. According to Committee Chair Mike Gapes, &quot;The UK and US have a close and valuable relationship not only in terms of intelligence and security but also in terms of our profound and historic cultural and trading links and commitment to freedom, democracy and the rule of law. But the use of the phrase &#x27;the special relationship&#x27; in its historical sense, to describe the totality of the ever-evolving UK–US relationship, is potentially misleading, and we recommend that its use should be avoided.&quot; In April 2010, the Church of England added its voice to the call for a more balanced relationship between Britain and the United States.

===Cameron and Obama (May 2010 – July 2016)===
On David Cameron&#x27;s being appointed as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom after coalition talks between his Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats concluded on 11 May 2010, President Obama was the first foreign leader to offer his congratulations. Following the conversation Obama said:

Foreign Secretary William Hague responded to the President&#x27;s overture by making Washington his first port of call, commenting: &quot;We&#x27;re very happy to accept that description and to agree with that description. The United States is without doubt the most important ally of the United Kingdom.&quot; Meeting Hillary Clinton, Hague hailed the Special Relationship as &quot;an unbreakable alliance&quot;, and added: &quot;It&#x27;s not a backward-looking or nostalgic relationship. It is one looking to the future from combating violent extremism to addressing poverty and conflict around the world.&quot; Both governments confirmed their joint commitment to the war in Afghanistan and their opposition to Iran&#x27;s nuclear programme.

The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 sparked a media firestorm against BP in the United States. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; observed that a &quot;rhetorical prickliness&quot; had come about from escalating Obama administration criticism of BP—straining the Special Relationship—particularly the repeated use of the term &quot;British Petroleum&quot; even though the business no longer uses that name. Cameron stated that he did not want to make the president&#x27;s toughness on BP a U.S.–U.K. issue, and noted that the company was balanced in terms of the number of its American and British shareholders. The validity of the Special Relationship was put in question as a result of the &quot;aggressive rhetoric&quot;.

On 20 July, Cameron met with Obama during his first visit to the United States as prime minister. The two expressed unity in a wide range of issues, including the war in Afghanistan. During the meeting, Obama stated, &quot;We can never say it enough. The United States and the United Kingdom enjoy a truly special relationship,&quot; then going on to say, &quot;We celebrate a common heritage. We cherish common values. ... (And) above all, our alliance thrives because it advances our common interests.&quot; Cameron said, &quot;from the times I&#x27;ve met Barack Obama before, we do have very, very close – allegiances and very close positions on all the key issues, whether that is Afghanistan or Middle East peace process or Iran. Our interests are aligned and we&#x27;ve got to make this partnership work.&quot; During the meeting, both Cameron and Obama criticized the decision of the Scottish Government to release Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who was convicted of participating in the Lockerbie bombing, from prison.

In May, Obama became the fourth U.S. president to make a state visit to the U.K. and the third U.S. president (after Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton) to address both Houses of Parliament. (George W. Bush was invited to address Parliament in 2003, but declined.) He was the first US President to give a rare Westminster Hall address, in which he stressed themes of shared heritage and values, as well as multilateralism. 

In 2013, ahead of a UK Parliament vote against participating in U.S. military action in Syria, Secretary of State John Kerry remarked &quot;The relationship between the US and UK has often been described as special or essential and it has been described thus simply because it is. Foreign Secretary William Hague replied: &quot;So the United Kingdom will continue to work closely with the United States, taking a highly active role in addressing the Syria crisis and working with our closest ally over the coming weeks and months.&quot; In July 2015, after negotiations, the United Kingdom and the United States, along with China, France, the European Union, Germany, Russia agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran.

In 2015, Cameron stated that Obama calls him &quot;bro&quot; and described the &quot;special relationship&quot; between Washington and Westminster as &quot;stronger than it has ever been&quot;. In March 2016, Obama criticised the British PM for becoming &quot;distracted&quot; over the intervention in Libya, a criticism that was also aimed at the French President. A National Security Council spokesman sent an unsolicited email to the BBC limiting the damage done by stating that &quot;Prime Minister David Cameron has been as close a partner as the president has had.&quot;

===May and Obama (July 2016 – January 2017)===
The short period of relations between post-Brexit referendum newly appointed Theresa May and Obama administration was met with diplomatic tension over John Kerry&#x27;s criticism of Israel in a speech. Obama maintained his stance that the UK would be a low priority for US trade talks post-Brexit, and that the UK would be at &quot;the back of the queue&quot;.

May chose Boris Johnson to serve as her Foreign Secretary. Johnson had written an op-ed which made mention of Obama&#x27;s Kenyan heritage in a manner which critics accused of being racist. He had also previously written an op-ed about Hillary Clinton which made derisive statements that had been criticized as sexist. By the time May appointed Johnson, Clinton was the Democratic Party&#x27;s presumptive nominee in the election to elect Obama&#x27;s successor, and thus had a significant chance of being the next US president. A senior official in the US government suggested that Johnson&#x27;s appointment would push the US further towards ties with Germany at the expense of the Special Relationship with the UK.

Ultimately, before he left office, Obama stated that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been his &quot;closest international partner&quot; throughout his tenure as president. While Obama might have had a distant relationship with Prime Minister May, he reportedly maintained a strong cordial relationship with members of the British royal family.

===May and Trump (January 2017 – July 2019)===
Following the election of Donald Trump, the British government sought to establish a close alliance with the Trump administration. May&#x27;s efforts to closely associate herself with Trump proved to be strongly controversial in the United Kingdom. May was the first world leader to meet with Trump following his inauguration. May&#x27;s supporters described her visit as a bid to reaffirm the historical &quot;special relationship&quot; between the two countries. The meeting took place at the White House and lasted about an hour.

May was criticized in the UK by members of all major parties, including her own, for refusing to condemn Trump&#x27;s &quot;Muslim ban&quot; executive order. as well as for her invitation to Trump, extended in 2017, for a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II. An invitation for a state visit had not traditionally been extended so early in a presidency, however May did so in hopes of fostering a stronger trade relationship with the United States before the Brexit deadline. More than 1.8 million signed an official parliamentary e-petition which said that &quot;Donald Trump&#x27;s well documented misogyny and vulgarity disqualifies him from being received by Her Majesty the Queen or the Prince of Wales,&quot; and Jeremy Corbyn, the Leader of the Opposition Labour Party, said in Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions that Trump should not be welcomed to Britain &quot;while he abuses our shared values with his shameful Muslim ban and attacks on refugees&#x27; and women&#x27;s rights&quot; and said that Trump should be banned from the UK until his travel ban is lifted. Baroness Warsi, former chair of the Conservatives, accused May of &quot;bowing down&quot; to Trump, who she described as &quot;a man who has no respect for women, disdain for minorities, little value for LGBT communities, no compassion clearly for the vulnerable and whose policies are rooted in divisive rhetoric.&quot; London Mayor Sadiq Khan and the Conservative leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, also called for the visit to be cancelled. Trump&#x27;s invitation was later downgraded to a &quot;working visit&quot; rather than a &quot;state visit&quot;; the visit occurred in July 2018 and included a meeting with the queen, but not the ceremonies and events of a full state visit.

Despite May&#x27;s efforts to establish a beneficial working relationship with Trump, their relationship had been described as &quot;dysfunctional&quot;. It had been reported that, in their phone calls, Trump had made a habit of interrupting May.

In November 2017, Trump retweeted an anti-Muslim post from the far-right group Britain First. The move was condemned across the British political spectrum, and May said through a spokesperson that it was &quot;wrong of the president to have done this.&quot; In response, Trump tweeted, &quot;Don&#x27;t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom, We are doing just fine!&quot; The dispute between Trump and May weakened the perception of a strong &quot;special relationship&quot; under May&#x27;s leadership and undermined her efforts to craft an image of a close relationship with the United States in order to ease the passage of Brexit. Some viewed Trump&#x27;s tweets as causing significant harm to the Special Relationship.

In February 2018, Trump—in an attempt to rebuke a push by some in the U.S. Democratic Party for universal healthcare—tweeted that, &quot;thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working&quot;. Trump&#x27;s criticism of the UK&#x27;s National Health Service (NHS) was factually inaccurate; the protests in the UK that Trump referenced actually pushed for an improvement in NHS services and increases in funding, and were not in opposition to the NHS or to Britain&#x27;s universal healthcare system. The tweet furthered strained the Trump-May relationship, and May responded by declaring her pride in the UK&#x27;s health system.

In January 2018, in a televised interview with Piers Morgan, Trump criticized May&#x27;s approach to Brexit negotiations, furthering straining his relationship with her. At the 2018 G7 summit, Trump repeatedly made apparent slights towards May. Despite this, May stated that her relationship with Trump remained strong. At the 2018 Brussels summit, May sought to curry favor with Trump by supporting his complaints that other NATO members had failed to meet certain levels of defence funding.

Following the Brussels summit, Trump made his first presidential visit to the United Kingdom. His visit came at period in the United Kingdom&#x27;s political climate which had been preceded by significant tumult for May. She was receiving significant resistance to her plans for a &quot;soft Brexit&quot;, which had resulted several major resignations amongst her cabinet ministers. During his visit, in an interview with &quot;The Sun&quot;, Trump, again, spoke critically of May&#x27;s handling of Brexit negotiations. He stated that May&#x27;s proposal would likely kill the prospects of a US-UK trade agreement. These comments inflicted further damage on an already-embattled May. Trump also praised Boris Johnson (a political rival of May&#x27;s who had recently resigned from her cabinet), going as far to suggest that Johnson would make a good prime minister. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; considered that the &quot;special relationship&quot; had &quot;devolved into a greasy dumpster fire&quot; under May and Trump.

Relations between the United Kingdom and the Trump administration were further strained in 2019, after a number of confidential diplomatic cables authored by the British Ambassador to the United States, Kim Darroch, were leaked to the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;. In the cables to the Foreign Office, which dated from 2017 to 2019, Darroch reported that the Trump administration as &quot;uniquely dysfunctional&quot; and &quot;inept&quot; and that Trump &quot;radiates insecurity&quot;; the cables advised U.S. officials that dealing with Trump required them &quot;you need to make your points simple, even blunt.&quot; Darroch also wrote that Trump&#x27;s position toward Iran frequently changed, likely to political considerations. After the memos leaked, Trump said that Darroch &quot;has not served the UK well&quot; and criticizing May. May defended Darroch, stating that &quot;Good government depends on public servants being able to give full and frank advice&quot;; other British politicians, such as Nigel Farage and Liam Fox, criticized Darroch. Following Boris Johnson&#x27;s refusal to defend Darroch in a debate for the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election and Trump&#x27;s statement that he would refuse to deal with Darroch, the ambassador resigned. Both May and Corbyn praised Darroch&#x27;s service in the House of Commons and deplored that he had to resign under pressure from the United States.

===Johnson and Trump (July 2019 – January 2021)===

After May resigned, Boris Johnson won the leadership contest with Trump&#x27;s endorsement, and became prime minister. Trump praised Johnson as prime minister and celebrated comparisons that had been made between Johnson and himself, declaring, &quot;Good man. He&#x27;s tough and he&#x27;s smart. They&#x27;re saying &#x27;Britain Trump.&#x27; They call him &#x27;Britain Trump&#x27;, and there&#x27;s people saying that&#x27;s a good thing.&quot; Johnson, had, in fact, been called the &quot;British Trump&quot; by some analysts and critics. However, Boris Johnson greatly differs in social policy, and is more socially liberal. Before and after becoming prime minister, Johnson spoke complimentarily of Trump.

At the start of November, as the UK prepared for the start of its 2019 general election campaign, Trump threw his support behind Johnson and the Conservative Party, telling London radio station LBC that a government led by opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn and his Labour Party would be &quot;so bad for your country ... he&#x27;d take you into such bad places.&quot; In the same interview, Trump praised Johnson as, &quot;a fantastic man&quot;, and, &quot;the exact right guy for the times&quot;. During the election campaign, Johnson had been seen as being keen on distancing himself from Trump, who was described as &quot;deeply unpopular in the UK&quot;, with polls conducted during his presidency showing that citizens of the United Kingdom have low confidence in and approval of Trump.

Trump and Johnson, both regarded to be populists, were seen as having an overall warm relationship with one another. Analysts saw the two leaders as having some stylistic similarities. Johnson was seen as making a deliberate effort to ingratiate himself to Trump. &quot;Politico&quot; would later report, quoting a former White House official, that, before becoming prime minister, Johnson had actively worked to win Trump&#x27;s favor while serving as foreign minister by winning over some of the president&#x27;s top aides, particularly Stephen Miller. The former White House official alleged that Johnson even held a surreptitious private meetings with Miller during a trip to Washington, D.C. &quot;Politico&quot; also reported that Johnson and Trump would come to be on such close terms that Trump supplied Johnson with his personal cell phone number. Johnson and Trump shared a mutual desire to see the United Kingdom undertake a hasty Brexit. Trump had previously been critical of May&#x27;s approach to Brexit, viewing it as overly prolonged and cautious.

At the NATO summit in London in December 2019, Johnson was caught on-camera appearing to participate in mocking Trump in a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Anne, Princess Royal. After the video was publicized, Trump criticized Trudeau as &quot;two-faced&quot; but did not criticize Johnson or other leaders.

After Trump&#x27;s defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election, Ben Wallace the United Kingdom&#x27;s Secretary of State for Defence, said he would miss Donald Trump, calling him a good friend to Britain. After the January 6 United States Capitol attack, merely fourteen days before Trump was scheduled to leave office, Johnson publicly condemned Trump&#x27;s actions in relation to the event, faulting him with having encouraged the attack&#x27;s participants.

===Johnson and Biden (January 2021 – September 2022)===

Trump lost the 2020 United States presidential election. After Democrat Joe Biden was projected the victor of the election on November 7, Johnson released a statement congratulating him. Johnson indicated that he was anticipating working with Biden on shared priorities, such as climate change, trade security, and declared his belief that the United States was the United Kingdom&#x27;s most important ally. During his presidential campaign, Biden and his team reportedly did not communicate with United Kingdom officials, as they opted to avoid speaking with foreign officials in order to avoid accusations of collusion with foreign powers in case any nation engaged in foreign electoral intervention in the United States elections. On November 10, Johnson exchanged a congratulatory phone call with Biden.

====Analysis of compatibility====
Biden has been regarded as to having a less compatible personality to Johnson than Trump had. Dan Balz, noting that Johnson and Biden have different leadership styles, a generational gap in age, and that their respective political parties occupy different positions on the political spectrum, has opined that the two, &quot;are anything but natural soul mates&quot;.

After Biden was elected, there was some speculation that Biden would have a less friendly personal relationship with Johnson than Trump did. Analysts believed that Trump had more similarities to Johnson than Biden does. After Biden won, &quot;Business Insider&quot; reported that sources from Biden&#x27;s campaign had told the outlet that Biden held hostility towards Johnson, believing him to be a right-wing populist who is similar to Trump. In December 2019, Biden had publicly derided Johnson as a, &quot;kind of physical and emotional clone&quot; of Donald Trump. History related to the two leaders was cited in reports of their likely hostility. During his tenure as vice president in the Obama administration, Biden had concurred with Obama in standing in opposition to a Brexit, while Johnson was a key advocate for it. Biden is a firm supporter of maintaining the Good Friday Agreement, while Johnson had, at times, been characterized as treating as an impediment to implementing Brexit. Johnson&#x27;s past comments about Biden&#x27;s friend, political ally, and former boss Barack Obama were regarded as a source of potential animosity for Biden. Johnson&#x27;s derisive comments on Biden&#x27;s former colleague, and fellow Democrat, Hillary Clinton were also regarded as a potential source of animosity for Biden. The degree to which Johnson embraced Trump was also speculated to be a point of bother that Biden may hold. There were further reports that Johnson was viewed even more negatively by vice president-elect Kamala Harris, and that members of the Biden–Harris team did not consider Johnson to be an ally and had ruled out the possibility of a special relationship with him. Ahead of Biden&#x27;s inauguration, analysts speculated that Johnson&#x27;s priority for a post-Brexit free trade deal between the two nations would not be treated as a priority by Biden. However, some analysts speculated that the two could reach common ground on prioritizing actions to combat climate change.

While analysts generally believe Johnson to have had more political similarities to Trump than to Biden, there are several policy matters where Johnson and his Conservative Party have more common ground with Biden and his Democratic Party than Trump and his Republican Party. For example, the United Kingdom continues to support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action both nations had entered with Iran and other nations under the Cameron-Obama period, while Trump withdrew the United States from it. As president, Biden has sought to have the United States rejoin the agreement. Johnson and the Conservative Party have expressed concern over climate change, as have Biden and his Democratic Party, while Trump and his Republican Party have been sceptical towards it. On his first day as president, Biden initiated the readmittance of the United States to the Paris Agreement, which Trump had withdrawn the United States from during his presidency. Johnson praised Biden for this. Trump is critical of NATO, and, as president, had levied the threat of withdrawing the United States from it due to his belief that some member nations were not contributing enough to the organization financially. Biden and Johnson, contrarily, have shared a mutual appreciation of the organization, expressing their belief of it to be a critical component of both nations&#x27; collective defense.

====Interactions====
Biden took office on January 20, 2021. It was reported by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; that Johnson was the first European leader that Biden made a phone call to after being inaugurated as president. In the first days of his presidency, Biden&#x27;s administration expressed that the president desired to work closely with Johnson, looking to the 2021 G7 Summit and the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference as opportunities for collaboration between the two leaders.

Biden&#x27;s first overseas trip and first face-to-face meeting with Johnson was at the 2021 G7 Summit, hosted in Cornwall, England in June. Johnson described Biden as a &quot;breath of fresh air&quot;, stating &quot;there&#x27;s so much that [the US] want to do together&quot; with us. The first meeting between the two leaders included plans to re-establish travel links between the US and UK, which had been banned by the US since the start of the pandemic and to agree a deal (to be called the new Atlantic charter), which commits the countries to working together on &quot;the key challenges of this century - cyber security, emerging technologies, global health and climate change&quot;. President Biden explicitly &quot;affirmed the special relationship&quot;. That charter encompass democracy and human rights of all individuals, rules-based international order and fair trade, territorial integrity and freedom of navigation, protect innovative edge and new markets/standards, terrorism, rules-based global economy, climate crisis and health systems and health protection. Also in their talks, both leaders affirmed a commitment to maintaining the Good Friday Agreement, a matter which Biden is personally greatly concerned about. After their first meeting, both Johnson and Biden characterized their interaction as having affirmed the &quot;special relationship&quot;.

===Truss and Biden (September 2022 – October 2022)===

Liz Truss became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on September 6, 2022. President Biden said in a congratulatory tweet that he looked forward to &quot;deepening the special relationship&quot; between the US and the UK, and reinstating their commitment to support Ukraine. In a break from tradition, Truss&#x27;s first phone call as prime minister did not go to the White House, instead choosing to speak to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy before calling Biden later that evening.

===Sunak and Biden (October 2022 – July 2024)===
Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on October 25, 2022. That day, President Biden called him to congratulate him on his appointment, as well as both agreeing to support Ukraine and maintaining the Good Friday Agreement. They both also spoke about cooperation between the two countries, such as AUKUS. In March 2023, they both met – alongside Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese – at an AUKUS summit in San Diego (where Biden jokingly asked Sunak if he could come to Sunak&#x27;s California home).

===Starmer and Biden (July 2024 – January 2025)===

Keir Starmer became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on July 5, 2024. His first face-to-face meeting with President Biden took place in Washington DC on July 10, 2024 in conjunction with NATO&#x27;s 75th anniversary summit.

===Starmer and Trump (January 2025 – present) ===

Following the election of Donald Trump, Starmer released a statement congratulating him, emphasising the legendary status of the special relationship and highlighting the need to work with the new administration.

Trump and Starmer met before the former&#x27;s election as president at Mar-a-Lago, where they had dinner together. 

Upon Trump&#x27;s victory, he appointed businessman Warren Stephens as the presumptive nominee for Ambassador to the UK, awaiting Senate conformation. Starmer appointed Lord Peter Mandelson in turn as ambassador to the US, taking office shortly after Trump&#x27;s inauguration. 

Trump was inaugurated on the 20 January 2025, officially becoming president, and Mandelson was appointed ambassador officially just under a month later. 

Trump, famed for his wide promises of tariffs, seemed to avoid taxing UK goods, saying they were &#x27;out of line&#x27;, but a deal could probably be worked out between them..

Starmer visited the White House on the 27th February, and brought with him an invite from King Charles III for a second state visit to the UK at a later date.

==Public opinion==
It has been noted that secret defence and intelligence links &quot;that [have] minimal impact on ordinary people [play] a disproportionate role in the transatlantic friendship&quot; and that perspectives on the Special Relationship differ.

===Poll findings===
A 1942 Gallup poll conducted after Pearl Harbor, before the arrival of American troops and Churchill&#x27;s heavy promotion of the Special Relationship, showed the wartime ally of the Soviet Union was still more popular than the United States for 62% of Britons. However, only 6% had ever visited the United States and only 35% knew any Americans personally. In 1969, the United States was tied with the Commonwealth as the most important overseas connection for the British public, and Europe came in a distant third. By 1984, after a decade in the European Economic Community, Britons chose Europe as being the most important to them.

British opinion polls from the Cold War revealed ambivalent feelings towards the United States. Thatcher&#x27;s 1979 agreement to base US cruise missiles in Britain was approved of by only 36% of Britons, and the proportion with little or no trust in the ability of the US to deal wisely with world affairs had soared from 38% in 1977 to 74% in 1984, when 49% wanted US nuclear bases in Britain removed, and 50% would have sent American-controlled cruise missiles back to the United States. At the same time, 59% of Britons supported their own country&#x27;s nuclear deterrent, with 60% believing Britain should rely on both nuclear and conventional weapons, and 66% opposing unilateral nuclear disarmament. 53% of Britons opposed dismantling the Royal Navy&#x27;s Polaris submarines. 70% of Britons still considered Americans to be very or fairly trustworthy, and in case of war, the Americans was the ally trusted overwhelmingly to come to Britain&#x27;s aid and to risk its own security for the sake of that of Britain. They were also the two countries that were most alike in basic values such as willingness to fight for their country and the importance of freedom.

In 1986, 71% of Britons, questioned in a Mori poll the day after Reagan&#x27;s bombing of Libya, disagreed with Thatcher&#x27;s decision to allow the use of RAF bases, and two thirds in a Gallup survey opposed the bombing itself, the opposite of US opinion. The all-time low poll rating of Britain in the United States came in 1994, during the split over the Bosnian War, when 56% of Americans interviewed considered Britons to be close allies.

In a 1997 Harris poll published after Blair&#x27;s election, 63% of people in the United States viewed Britain as a close ally, up by 1% from 1996, &#x27;confirming that the long-running &quot;special relationship&quot; with America&#x27;s transatlantic cousins is still alive and well&#x27;. Canada ranked first with 73%, while Australia came third, with 48%. Popular awareness of the historic link was fading in the parent country, however. In a 1997 Gallup poll, 60% of the British public said they regretted the end of Empire and 70% expressed pride in the imperial past, 53% wrongly supposed that the United States had never been a British possession.

In 1998, 61% of Britons polled by ICM said they believed they had more in common with US citizens than they did with the rest of Europe. 64% disagreed with the sentence &#x27;Britain does what the US government tells us to do&#x27;. A majority also backed Blair&#x27;s support of Bill Clinton&#x27;s strategy on Iraq, 42% saying action should be taken to topple Saddam Hussein, with 24% favouring diplomatic action and a further 24%, military action. A majority of Britons aged 24 or over said they disliked Blair supporting Clinton over the Lewinsky scandal.

A 2006 poll of the American public showed that Britain, as an &#x27;ally in the war on terror&#x27;, was viewed more positively than any other country, and 76% of the US people polled viewed the British as an &#x27;ally in the War on Terror&#x27; according to Rasmussen Reports. According to Harris Interactive, 74% of Americans viewed Great Britain as a &#x27;close ally in the war in Iraq&#x27;, well ahead of next-ranked Canada at 48%.

A June 2006 poll by Populus for &quot;The Times&quot; showed that the number of Britons agreeing that &#x27;it is important for Britain&#x27;s long-term security that we have a close and special relationship with America&#x27; had fallen to 58% (from 71% in April) and that 65% believed that &#x27;Britain&#x27;s future lies more with Europe than America.&#x27; Only 44% agreed that &#x27;America is a force for good in the world.&#x27; A later poll during the Israel-Lebanon conflict found that 63% of Britons felt that the United Kingdom was tied too closely to the United States. A 2008 poll by &quot;The Economist&quot; showed that Britons&#x27; views differed considerably from Americans&#x27; views when asked about the topics of religion, values, and national interest. &quot;The Economist&quot; remarked:

In January 2010 a Leflein poll conducted for Atlantic Bridge found that 57% of people in the US considered the special relationship with Britain to be the world&#x27;s most important bilateral partnership, with 2% disagreeing. 60% of people in the US regarded Britain as the country most likely to support the United States in a crisis, and Canada came second on 24% and Australia third on 4%.

In May 2010, a poll conducted in the UK by YouGov revealed that 66% of those surveyed held a favourable view of the US and 62% agreed with the assertion that America was Britain&#x27;s most important ally. However, the survey also revealed that 85% of British citizens believed that the UK has little or no influence on American policies and that 62% thought that America did not consider British interests. Another poll by YouGov in September 2016 revealed that 57% still believed in the special relationship, whilst 37% did not.

In a 2021 Pew Research Center poll, 31% of American respondents picked Britain as their closest foreign policy partner, making it by far the most picked choice (Canada was a distant second with 13%).

In September 2024, Emerson College Polling conducted a survey on behalf of the Association of Marshall Scholars to gauge public perceptions of the US-UK special relationship in comparison to other international relationships. 1,100 US residents were surveyed. Under the age of 30, 36% of residents rank China above the United Kingdom as the most valuable strategic partner to the United States. Conversely, only 4% of residents over the age of 70 held the same views. 27% of young respondents perceived the UK as the United States&#x27; most valuable ally, whilst 57% of respondents over 70 felt the same way. Despite these findings, the majority of respondents perceive the relationship as &quot;very important&quot; today. This again however reflects the demographic differences as 44% of Americans under 30 held this view as compared with 74% of Americans over 70 years old.

===Iraq War===
Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, senior British figures criticized the refusal of the US government to heed British advice regarding postwar plans for Iraq, specifically the Coalition Provisional Authority&#x27;s de-Ba&#x27;athification policy and the critical importance of preventing the power vacuum in which the insurgency then developed. British Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon later stated that the United Kingdom &#x27;lost the argument&#x27; with the Bush administration over rebuilding Iraq.

===Extraordinary rendition===
Assurances made by the United States to the United Kingdom that &#x27;extraordinary rendition&#x27; flights had never landed on British territory were later shown to be false when official US records proved that such flights had landed at Diego Garcia repeatedly. The revelation was an embarrassment for British foreign secretary David Miliband, who apologised to Parliament.

===Criminal law===
In 2003, the United States pressed the United Kingdom to agree to an extradition treaty, which proponents argued, allowed for equal extradition requirements between the two countries. Critics argued that the UK was obligated to make a strong &quot;prima facie&quot; case to US courts before extradition would be granted but that extradition from the United Kingdom to the United States was only a matter of administrative decision, without &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence. That had been implemented as an antiterrorist measure in the wake of 11 September 2001 attacks. Very soon, however, it was being used by the United States to extradite and prosecute a number of high-profile London businessmen (like the NatWest Three and Ian Norris) on fraud charges. Contrasts have been drawn with the Americans&#x27; harboring of Provisional IRA volunteers in the 1970s to the 1990s and repeated refusals to extradite them to Britain. The Death of Harry Dunn who was killed by the wife of a USA CIA officer on the 27th of August 2019 also caused criticism of the extradition treaty after Anne Sacoolas, the defendant, repatriated to the US and claimed Diplomatic Immunity against charges.

On 30 September 2006, the US Senate unanimously ratified the 2003 treaty. Ratification had been slowed by complaints from some Irish-American groups that the treaty would create new legal jeopardy for US citizens who opposed British policy in Northern Ireland. &quot;The Spectator&quot; condemned the three-year delay as &#x27;an appalling breach in a long-treasured relationship&#x27;.

The United States also refused to accede to another priority of the Blair government, the treaty setting up the International Criminal Court.

===Trade policy===
Trade disputes and attendant job fears have sometimes strained the Special Relationship. The United States has been accused of pursuing an aggressive trade policy by using or ignoring World Trade Organization rules. The aspects causing most difficulty to the United Kingdom have been a successful challenge to the protection of small family banana farmers in the West Indies from large US corporations such as the American Financial Group, and high tariffs on British steel products. In 2002, Blair denounced Bush&#x27;s imposition of tariffs on steel as &quot;unacceptable, unjustified and wrong&quot;, but although Britain&#x27;s biggest steelmaker, Corus, called for protection from dumping by developing nations, the Confederation of British Industry urged the government not to start a &quot;tit-for-tat&quot;.

<text>A barrel is one of several units of volume applied in various contexts; there are dry barrels, fluid barrels (such as the U.K. beer barrel and U.S. beer barrel), oil barrels, and so forth. For historical reasons the volumes of some barrel units are roughly double the volumes of others; volumes in common use range approximately from . In many connections the term is used almost interchangeably with &quot;barrel&quot;.

Since medieval times the term as a unit of measure has had various meanings throughout Europe, ranging from about 100 litres to about 1,000 litres. The name was derived in medieval times from the French , of unknown origin, but still in use, both in French and as derivations in many other languages such as Italian, Polish, and Spanish. In most countries such usage is obsolescent, increasingly superseded by SI units. As a result, the meaning of corresponding words and related concepts (vat, cask, keg etc.) in other languages often refers to a physical container rather than a known measure.

In the international oil market context, however, prices in United States dollars per barrel are commonly used, and the term is variously translated, often to derivations of the Latin / Germanic root &quot;fat&quot; (for example &quot;vat&quot; or &quot;Fass&quot;).

In other commercial connections, barrel sizes such as beer keg volumes also are standardised in many countries.

==Dry goods in the US==

* US dry barrel: 
**Defined as length of stave , diameter of head , distance between heads , circumference of bulge outside measurement; representing as nearly as possible 7,056 cubic inches; and the thickness of staves not greater than (diameter ≈ ). Any barrel that is 7,056 cubic inches is recognized as equivalent.
* US barrel for cranberries 
** Defined as length of stave , diameter of head , distance between heads , circumference of bulge outside measurement; and the thickness of staves not greater than (diameter ≈ ). No equivalent in cubic inches is given in the statute, but later regulations specify it as 5,826 cubic inches. 
Some products have a standard weight or volume that constitutes a barrel: 
* Cornmeal, 
* Cement (including Portland cement), or 
*Sugar, 
* Wheat or rye flour, or 
* Lime (mineral), large barrel, or small barrel
* Butter and cheese in UK, 
* Salt, 

==Fluid barrel in the US and UK==
Fluid barrels vary depending on what is being measured and where. In the UK a beer barrel is . In the US most fluid barrels (apart from oil) are (half a hogshead), but a beer barrel is . The size of beer kegs in the US is based loosely on fractions of the US beer barrel. When referring to beer barrels or kegs in many countries, the term may be used for the commercial package units independent of actual volume, where common range for professional use is 20–60 L, typically a DIN or &quot;Euro keg&quot; of 50 L.

===History===

Richard III, King of England from 1483 until 1485, had defined the wine puncheon as a cask holding 84 wine gallons and a wine tierce as holding 42 wine gallons. Custom had made the 42 gallon watertight tierce a standard container for shipping eel, salmon, herring, molasses, wine, whale oil, and many other commodities in the English colonies by 1700. After the American Revolution in 1776, American merchants continued to use the same size barrels.

==Oil barrel== 


===Definitions===

In the oil industry, one barrel (unit symbol bbl) is a unit of volume used for measuring oil defined as exactly 42 US gallons, approximately 159 liters, or .

According to the American Petroleum Institute (API), a standard barrel of oil is the amount of oil that would occupy a volume of exactly at reference temperature and pressure conditions of and (or 1 atm). This standard barrel of oil will occupy a different volume at different pressures and temperatures. A standard barrel in this context is thus not simply a measure of volume, but of volume under specific conditions. ()

===Unit multiples===
Oil companies that are publicly listed in the United States typically report their production using the unit multiples Mbbl (one thousand barrels) and MMbbl (one million barrels), derived from the Latin word &quot;mille&quot; and Roman Numeral M, meaning &quot;thousand&quot;. Due to the risk of confusion The Society of Petroleum Engineers recommends in their style guide that abbreviations or prefixes M or MM are not used for barrels of oil or barrel of oil equivalent, but rather that thousands, millions or billions are spelled out. 

Using M for thousand and MM for million are in conflict with the SI convention where the &quot;M&quot; prefix stands for &quot;mega&quot; representing million, from the Greek for &quot;large&quot;. Some oil companies, particularly those based in Europe, use kb (kilobarrels, one thousand barrels), mb (megabarrels, one million barrels), and gb (gigabarrels, one billion barrels). The lower case m is used to avoid confusion with the capital M used for thousand. For the same reason, the unit kbbl (one thousand barrels) is also sometimes used.

=== Etymology === 

The first &quot;b&quot; in &quot;bbl&quot; may have been doubled originally to indicate the plural (1 bl, 2 bbl), or possibly it was doubled to eliminate any confusion with bl as a symbol for the bale. Some sources assert that &quot;bbl&quot; originated as a symbol for &quot;blue barrels&quot; delivered by Standard Oil in its early days. However, while Ida Tarbell&#x27;s 1904 Standard Oil Company history acknowledged the &quot;holy blue barrel&quot;, the abbreviation &quot;bbl&quot; had been in use well before the 1859 birth of the U.S. petroleum industry.

===Flow rate===

Oil wells recover not just oil from the ground, but also natural gas and water. The term barrels of liquid per day (BLPD) refers to the total volume of liquid that is recovered. Similarly, barrels of oil equivalent or BOE is a value that accounts for both oil and natural gas while ignoring any water that is recovered.
Other terms are used when discussing only oil. These terms can refer to either the production of crude oil at an oil well, the conversion of crude oil to other products at an oil refinery, or the overall consumption of oil by a region or country. One common term is barrels per day (BPD, BOPD, bbl/d, bpd, bd, or b/d), where 1 BPD is equivalent to 0.0292 gallons per minute. One BPD also becomes 49.8 tonnes per year. At an oil refinery, production is sometimes reported as barrels per calendar day (b/cd or bcd), which is total production in a year divided by the days in that year. Likewise, barrels per stream day (BSD or BPSD) is the quantity of oil product produced by a single refining unit during continuous operation for 24 hours.

Burning one tonne of light, synthetic, or heavy crude yields 38.51, 39.40, or 40.90 GJ (thermal) respectively (10.70, 10.94, or 11.36 MW·h), so 1 tonne per day of synthetic crude is about 456 kW of thermal power and 1 bpd of synthetic crude is about 378 kW (slightly less for light crude, slightly more for heavy crude).

===Conversion===
The task of converting a standard barrel of oil to a standard cubic metre of oil is complicated by the fact that the latter is defined by the API to mean the amount of oil that, at different reference conditions (101.325 kPa and ), occupies 1 cubic metre. The fact that the refence conditions are not exactly the same means that an exact conversion is impossible unless the exact expansion coefficient of the crude is known, and this will vary from one crude oil to another.

For a light oil with density of 850 kilogram per cubic metre (API gravity of 35), warming the oil from to might increase its volume by about 0.047%. Conversely, a heavy oil with a density of 934 kg/m3 (API gravity of 20) might only increase in volume by 0.039%. If physically measuring the density at a new temperature is not possible, then tables of empirical data can be used to accurately predict the change in density. In turn, this allows maximum accuracy when converting between standard barrel and standard cubic metre. The logic above also implies the same level of accuracy in measurements for barrels if there is a error in measuring the temperature at time of measuring the volume.

For ease of trading, communication and financial accounting, international commodity exchanges often set a conversion factor for benchmark crude oils. For instance the conversion factor set by the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude oil traded at Hardisty, Alberta, Canada is 6.29287 U.S. barrels per standard cubic metre, despite the uncertainty in converting the volume for crude oil. Regulatory authorities in producing countries set standards for measurement accuracy of produced hydrocarbons, where such measurements affect taxes or royalties to the government. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the measurement accuracy required is ±0.25%.

===Qualifiers===
A barrel can technically be used to specify any volume. Since the actual nature of the fluids being measured varies along the stream, sometimes qualifiers are used to clarify what is being specified. In the oil field, it is often important to differentiate between rates of production of fluids, which may be a mix of oil and water, and rates of production of the oil itself. If a well is producing 10 MBD (millions of barrels per day) of fluids with a 20% water cut, then the well would also be said to be producing 8,000 barrels of oil a day (bod).

In other circumstances, it can be important to include gas in production and consumption figures. Normally, gas amount is measured in standard cubic feet or standard cubic metres (for volume at STP), as well as in kg or Btu (which do not depend on pressure or temperature). But when necessary, such volume is converted to a volume of oil of equivalent enthalpy of combustion. Production and consumption using this analogue is stated in barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed).

In the case of water-injection wells, in the United States it is common to refer to the injectivity rate in barrels of water per day (bwd). In Canada, it is measured in cubic metres per day (m3/d). In general, water injection rates will be stated in the same units as oil production rates, since the usual objective is to replace the volume of oil produced with a similar volume of water to maintain reservoir pressure.

===Related kinds of quantity===
Outside the United States, volumes of oil are usually reported in cubic metres (m3) instead of oil barrels. Cubic metre is the basic volume unit in the International System. In Canada, oil companies measure oil in cubic metres, but convert to barrels on export, since most of Canada&#x27;s oil production is exported to the US. The nominal conversion factor is 1 cubic metre = 6.2898 oil barrels, but conversion is generally done by custody transfer meters on the border, since the volumes are specified at different temperatures, and the exact conversion factor depends on both density and temperature. Canadian companies operate internally and report to Canadian governments in cubic metres, but often convert to US barrels for the benefit of American investors and oil marketers. They generally quote prices in Canadian dollars per cubic metre to other Canadian companies, but use US dollars per barrel in financial reports and press statements, making it appear to the outside world that they operate in barrels.

Companies on the European stock exchanges report the &quot;mass&quot; of oil in tonnes. Since different varieties of petroleum have different densities, however, there is not a single conversion between mass and volume. For example, one tonne of heavy distillates might occupy a volume of . In contrast, one tonne of crude oil might occupy , and one tonne of gasoline will require . Overall, the conversion is usually between per tonne.

===History===
The measurement of an &quot;oil barrel&quot; originated in the early Pennsylvania oil fields. The Drake Well, the first oil well in the US, was drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859, and an oil boom followed in the 1860s. When oil production began, there was no standard container for oil, so oil and petroleum products were stored and transported in barrels of different shapes and sizes. Some of these barrels would originally have been used for other products, such as beer, fish, molasses, or turpentine. Both the barrels (based on the old English wine measure), the tierce (159 litres) and the whiskey barrels were used. Also, barrels were in common use. The 40 gallon whiskey barrel was the most common size used by early oil producers, since they were readily available at the time.

Around 1866, early oil producers in Pennsylvania concluded that shipping oil in a variety of different containers was causing buyer distrust. They decided they needed a standard unit of measure to convince buyers that they were getting a fair volume for their money, and settled on the standard wine tierce, which was two gallons larger than the standard whisky barrel. The &quot;Weekly Register&quot;, an Oil City, Pennsylvania newspaper, stated on August 31, 1866 that &quot;the oil producers have issued the following circular&quot;:

And by that means, King Richard III&#x27;s English wine tierce became the American standard oil barrel.

By 1872, the standard oil barrel was firmly established as 42 US-gallons. The 42 gallon standard oil barrel was officially adopted by the Petroleum Producers Association in 1872 and by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1882.

In modern times, many different types of oil, chemicals, and other products are transported in steel drums. In the United States, these commonly have a capacity of and are referred to as such. They are called 200 litre or 200 kg drums outside the United States. In the United Kingdom and its former dependencies, a drum was used, even though all those countries now officially use the metric system and the drums are filled to 200 litres. In the United States, the 42 US-gallon size as a unit of measure is largely confined to the oil industry, while different sizes of barrel are used in other industries. Nearly all other countries use the metric system.

Thus, the 42 US-gallon oil barrel is a unit of measure rather than a physical container used to transport crude oil.

<text>Epidote is a calcium aluminium iron sorosilicate mineral.

==Description==
Well developed crystals of epidote, Ca2Al2(Fe3+;Al)(SiO4)(Si2O7)O(OH), crystallizing in the monoclinic system, are of frequent occurrence: they are commonly prismatic in habit, the direction of elongation being perpendicular to the single plane of symmetry. The name Epidote is derived from the Greek word &#x27;epidosis&#x27;, meaning &quot;increase&quot;, in allusion to the crystal characteristic of one longer side at the base of the prism. The faces are often deeply striated and crystals are often twinned. Many of the characters of the mineral vary with the amount of iron present for instance, the color, the optical constants, and the specific gravity. The color is green, grey, brown or nearly black, but usually a characteristic shade of yellowish-green or pistachio-green. It displays strong pleochroism, the pleochroic colors being usually green, yellow and brown. Clinozoisite is green, white or pale rose-red group species containing very little iron, thus having the same chemical composition as the orthorhombic mineral zoisite. The name, due to Haüy, is derived from the Greek word &quot;epidosis&quot; (ἐπίδοσις) which means &quot;addition&quot; in allusion to one side of the ideal prism being longer than the other.

Epidote is an abundant rock-forming mineral, but one of secondary origin. It occurs in marble and schistose rocks of metamorphic origin. It is also a product of hydrothermal alteration of various minerals (feldspars, micas, pyroxenes, amphiboles, garnets, and others) composing igneous rocks. A rock composed of quartz and epidote is known as epidosite. Well-developed crystals are found at many localities: Knappenwand, near the Großvenediger in the Untersulzbachthal in Salzburg, as magnificent, dark green crystals of long prismatic habit in cavities in epidote schist, with asbestos, adularia, calcite, and apatite; the Ala valley and Traversella in Piedmont; Arendal in Norway; Le Bourg-d&#x27;Oisans in Dauphiné; Haddam in Connecticut; Prince of Wales Island in Alaska, here as large, dark green, tabular crystals with copper ores in metamorphosed limestone.

The perfectly transparent, dark green crystals from the Knappenwand and from Brazil have occasionally been cut as gemstones. The green part of several mixed-rock ornamental stones is composed of epidote. These include Unakite and Australian Dragon Bloodstone.

===Related species===
Belonging to the same isomorphous group with epidote are the REE-rich allanite (containing primarily lanthanum, cerium, and yttrium), and the manganese-rich piemontite.

Piemontite occurs as small, reddish-black, monoclinic crystals in the manganese mines at San Marcel, near Ivrea in Piedmont, and in crystalline schists at several places in Japan. The purple color of the Egyptian porfido rosso antico is due to the presence of this mineral.

Allanite and dollaseite-(Ce) have the same general epidote formula and contain metals of the cerium group. In external appearance allanite differs widely from epidote, being black or dark brown in color, pitchy in lustre, and opaque in the mass; further, there is little or no cleavage, and well-developed crystals are rare. The crystallographic and optical characters are similar to those of epidote; the pleochroism is strong with reddish-, yellowish-, and greenish-brown colors. Although not a common mineral, allanite is of fairly wide distribution as a primary accessory constituent of many crystalline rocks, gneiss, granite, syenite, rhyolite, andesite, and others. It was first found in the granite of east Greenland and described by Thomas Allan in 1808, after whom the species was named. Allanite is a mineral readily altered by hydration, becoming optically isotropic and amorphous: for this reason several varieties have been distinguished, and many different names applied. Orthite was the name given by Jöns Berzelius in 1818 to a hydrated form found as slender prismatic crystals, sometimes a foot in length, at Finbo, near Falun in Sweden. Dollaseite is less common, famous from the Ostanmossa mine in the Norberg district of Sweden.

<text>The Olivia Tremor Control were an American psychedelic band from Athens, Georgia that released two studio albums, a bonus disc, a singles collection and a live album between 1996 and 2000. The main members were Will Cullen Hart, Bill Doss, Eric Harris, John Fernandes and Peter Erchick. They combined indie rock and neo-psychedelia, taking influence from psychedelic pop bands of the 1960s, such as the Beach Boys and the Beatles.

The Olivia Tremor Control originated as a band called Cranberry Lifecycle, which was formed in Ruston, Louisiana in the late 1980s by Hart and his high school friend Jeff Mangum. The two moved to Athens, and reworked Cranberry Lifecycle songs as a new band called Synthetic Flying Machine. After Doss joined, Mangum left the band to pursue a solo project that eventually became Neutral Milk Hotel. Doss and Hart then renamed the band The Olivia Tremor Control, and recruited Fernandes, Harris, and Erchick. With this line-up, the Olivia Tremor Control released two albums: &quot;Dusk at Cubist Castle&quot; (1996) and &quot;Black Foliage&quot; (1999). Both albums received positive reviews from critics.

After the release of &quot;Black Foliage&quot;, tensions grew between Hart and Doss, and the Olivia Tremor Control broke up in 2000. Hart was hospitalized with multiple sclerosis in 2005, and when Doss went to visit him, the two reconciled and reunited the band in 2009. Partway through recording sessions for a third album, Doss died of an aneurysm in 2012. Hart died in 2024.

==History==
===Early years===
The Olivia Tremor Control originated in the late 1980s as a psychedelic band called Cranberry Lifecycle, formed in Ruston, Louisiana. It was one of many home recording projects created by high school friends Will Cullen Hart and Jeff Mangum with their friends Bill Doss and Robert Schneider. The four friends exchanged homemade cassette tapes, branding them with an imaginary record label, Elephant 6, which eventually grew into a loose musical collective. Musician Ross Beach, another Elephant 6 collaborator, describes Cranberry Lifecycle as the Elephant 6&#x27;s &quot;first collaboration of &#x27;serious&#x27; songs.&quot;

After graduating from high school, Hart and Mangum moved to Athens, Georgia to join the city&#x27;s burgeoning music scene. They formed a band called Synthetic Flying Machine, and reworked songs that were originally recorded as Cranberry Lifecycle. In the summer of 1993, Doss moved to Athens and joined Synthetic Flying Machine. The lineup consisted of Hart on electric guitar, Doss on bass guitar, and Mangum on drums. The band gained a small following due in part to the psychedelic-infused music, which differed from the prevalent grunge sound in the city. Mangum left the group shortly after its formation to focus on a solo project, which eventually became the indie band Neutral Milk Hotel. Doss and Hart renamed their group the Olivia Tremor Control, a surreal-sounding phrase with no further meaning, suggested by Mangum.

The first Olivia Tremor Control release was the extended play (EP) &quot;California Demise&quot; in 1994, which introduced many of their signature elements, including guitar effects and vocal harmonization. Although Mangum was no longer a part of the band, he still lived with Doss and Hart and was asked to play drums. After &quot;California Demise&quot;, Hart moved to Denver, while Doss moved to New York to play in the band Chocolate USA. By 1996, Doss was losing interest in Chocolate USA, and wanted to record more music with Hart. The two reconvened in Athens, and recruited multi-instrumentalists John Fernandes and Eric Harris. During this period, the Olivia Tremor Control released the 1994 split single &quot;The Olivia Tremor Control/The Apples in Stereo&quot; with the Apples in Stereo, and the 1996 EP &quot;The Giant Day&quot;.

===&quot;Music from the Unrealized Film Script: Dusk at Cubist Castle&quot;===
Doss and Hart had been working on songs for a studio album as early as 1993. Doss&#x27; ideas were more pop friendly while Hart wrote more experimental songs. Their dichotomous partnership during this era drew some comparisons to Lennon–McCartney of the Beatles, although &quot;Stereogum&quot; noted that both Fernandes and Harris retained creative input. In 1995, the Olivia Tremor Control went to Denver, Colorado to record their debut album, &quot;Music from the Unrealized Film Script: Dusk at Cubist Castle&quot; (commonly shortened to &quot;Dusk at Cubist Castle&quot;). It was recorded at Pet Sounds Studio, and was produced by Schneider.

At 74 minutes in length with 27 songs, &quot;Dusk at Cubist Castle&quot; was a large undertaking. It was purported to be the soundtrack to a fictional film, and covers a wide range of genres, including psychedelia, krautrock, noise music, and folk-rock. &quot;Dusk at Cubist Castle&quot; was released on August 6, 1996, by Flydaddy Records. The songs &quot;The Opera House&quot; and &quot;Jumping Fences&quot; were released as singles. To promote the album, the Olivia Tremor Control served as an opener for Beck, and toured with Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci in 1998. Keyboardist Peter Erchick was brought on as the fifth band member while on tour. &quot;Dusk at Cubist Castle&quot; received positive reviews from critics, who noted the intricate composition and judicious use of pop elements. It ranked at number 37 on &quot;The Village Voice&quot; year-end Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll.

Early CD pressings of &quot;Dusk at Cubist Castle&quot; included a companion album, &quot;Explanation II: Instrumental Themes and Dream Sequences&quot;, which had nine ambient songs. The liner notes for &quot;Explanation II&quot; suggested that it should be played in synchronicity with &quot;Dusk at Cubist Castle&quot; to create quadraphonic sound, although the albums are different lengths, so the effect does not actually work.

In 1997, the band appeared on John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show. Their entire appearance was recorded and released as an untitled four-track EP known as &quot;Those Sessions&quot; or &quot;John Peel Session 1997&quot;. It includes several renditions of existing songs as well as a lengthy improvised piece in a similar style to &quot;Explanation II&quot;.

===&quot;Black Foliage: Animation Music Volume One&quot;===
In the liner notes for &quot;Dusk at Cubist Castle&quot;, the Olivia Tremor Control asked fans to mail the band cassette tapes of themselves describing their dreams. These tapes served as the basis for band&#x27;s second album &quot;Black Foliage: Animation Music Volume One&quot; (commonly shortened to &quot;Black Foliage&quot;). The Olivia Tremor Control wanted to explore the concept of dreams, and the way they emulate life with unexpected deviations, such as going to work naked. &quot;Black Foliage&quot; was recorded at Pet Sounds Studio, and Schneider once again served as the producer.

Hart was influenced by the electronic sound of the 1969 White Noise album &quot;An Electric Storm&quot;, which led him to splice traditional compositions the band members had been writing with experimental electronic pieces. These splices became an important musical motif for &quot;Black Foliage&quot;. The album does not feature musical pauses or fade, and many songs eschew the standard verse–chorus form. 

&quot;Black Foliage&quot; was released by Flydaddy Records on March 23, 1999, to positive reviews. Critics highlighted the juxtaposition of pop and experimental elements, as well as the richness of the sound. To promote the album, the Olivia Tremor Control toured with opener band Bablicon, and then served as an opener for Stereolab.

In 2000, the band wrote and recorded five songs with Japanese singer Kahimi Karie, released under her name as &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;.

===Breakup, reunion, and the deaths of Doss and Hart===

After the release of &quot;Black Foliage&quot;, tensions grew between Doss and Hart. According to Doss, Hart wanted to take a hiatus from music, and was suffering from early symptoms of then-undiagnosed multiple sclerosis. The two had a falling out, and the Olivia Tremor Control broke up in 2000. The last album to be released during this period was &quot;Singles and Beyond&quot;, a compilation album featuring some of the band&#x27;s rare and out of print songs. Doss and Hart worked on other projects in the interim; Doss recorded music for his solo project The Sunshine Fix and was a member of the Apples in Stereo, while Hart formed the band Circulatory System.

Around 2005, Hart&#x27;s MS symptoms worsened, and he was admitted to a hospital. After receiving the news, Doss decided to reconcile with Hart, and the members of Olivia Tremor Control started playing music with each other on a regular basis. After a brief reunion performance at the 2005 All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival, the Olivia Tremor Control scheduled more concerts over the next few years. Fernandes said: &quot;When we got the offer to play [All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties] we were thinking about playing a few shows here and there, because everybody still lives here in town ... That went so well that we decided to do a few more.&quot; The Olivia Tremor Control officially reunited in 2009, and released two new songs over the next two years: &quot;North Term Reality&quot; and &quot;The Game You Play Is in Your Head, Parts 1, 2, &amp; 3.&quot;

On July 31, 2012, the band announced that Doss had died aged 43. &quot;Atlanta&quot; later reported the cause of death as an aneurysm. Prior to his death, the Olivia Tremor Control was recording music for an untitled album. The remaining members decided to continue performing as the Olivia Tremor Control, and another album is still in the works as of late 2023. Hart stated it would be the band&#x27;s final album, and said: &quot;We have three sides worth of songs done, though they&#x27;re not sequenced properly yet to run three sides.&quot; 

On November 29, 2024, the Olivia Tremor Control released the singles &quot;Garden of Light&quot; and &quot;The Same Place&quot;, the band&#x27;s first new music in 13 years. Hours later, it was announced that Hart died at age 53 earlier that same morning.

==Artistry==
The Olivia Tremor Control&#x27;s music combines indie rock and neo-psychedelia. In addition to traditional pop and rock instruments such as guitars and drums, the band members also play the clarinet, flute, saxophone, theremin, violin, and xylophone. While discussing the band&#x27;s dynamic sound, Paul Thompson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called it &quot;some unthinkable matchup of &quot;Revolver&quot;-era Beatles or &quot;Smile&quot;-era Beach Boys, the tornado-alley skronk of 1980s Flaming Lips and Butthole Surfers, and the surreal wooze of post-Reichian tape manipulation.&quot; Music critic Nig Hodgkins notes that the Olivia Tremor Control incorporate many elements found in psychedelic music of the 1990s, including backwards guitar echo, phasing, dreamlike vocals, and electronic sound effects.

The Olivia Tremor Control was inspired by psychedelic pop bands of the 1960s, especially the Beach Boys and the Beatles, for their singing style and the way they &quot;blended trickery and interesting sounds with pop&quot;, according to Hart. Hart notes that the band attempted to expand on the sound of 1960s psychedelic pop with modern recording technology, creating more holistic songs and avoiding what he called &quot;hippie jam sessions.&quot; Other influences include the recording techniques used by musique concrète musicians like Pierre Henry and John Cage, as well as 1990s indie rock bands like Pavement and Sebadoh. Doss said he wanted the Olivia Tremor Control&#x27;s music to instill a sense of &quot;mystery or happiness&quot; in listeners. &quot;I&#x27;m sending out a positive message, because the world needs it ... We&#x27;re reaching for something that&#x27;s hard to explain.&quot;

<text>Carolyn Sue Jones (April 28, 1930 – August 3, 1983) was an American actress of television and film. She began her film career in the early 1950s, and by the end of the decade had achieved recognition with a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;The Bachelor Party&quot; (1957) and a Golden Globe Award as one of the most promising new actresses of 1959. Her film career continued for another 20 years. In 1964, Jones began playing the role of matriarch Morticia Addams in the black and white television series &quot;The Addams Family&quot;.

==Early life==
Carolyn Jones was born in Amarillo, Texas to homemaker Chloe Jeanette Southern (1906–1979), and Julius Alfred Jones (1897–1979), a barber. After their father abandoned the family in 1934, Carolyn and her younger sister, Bette Rhea Jones, moved with their mother into her maternal grandparents&#x27; Amarillo home. Jones suffered from severe asthma that often restricted her childhood activities, and when her condition prevented her from going to the movies, she became an avid reader of Hollywood fan magazines and aspired to become an actress. She enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse in California at age 17, with her grandfather, Charles W. Baker, paying her tuition.

==Film==
After being spotted by a talent scout at the Playhouse, Jones secured a contract with Paramount Pictures and made her first film, an uncredited part in &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1952); had an uncredited bit part as a nightclub hostess in &quot;The Big Heat&quot; (1953); and a role in &quot;House of Wax&quot; (also 1953) as the woman who is converted by Vincent Price&#x27;s character into a Joan of Arc statue. She played Beth in &quot;Shield for Murder&quot; (1954), earning $500 per day for playing the role.

Jones was cast in the film &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953) in the role of Alma &quot;Lorene&quot; Burke. A bout of pneumonia forced her to withdraw; the role earned Donna Reed the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

In 1956 she appeared in &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; and in the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;, a remake of one of the director&#x27;s earlier films.

In 1958, Jones was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;The Bachelor Party&quot; (1957), and she also shared the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress with Sandra Dee and Diane Varsi, and appeared with Elvis Presley in &quot;King Creole&quot; (1958).

Jones played opposite Frank Sinatra in Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;A Hole in the Head&quot;, Dean Martin in &quot;Career&quot;, and Anthony Quinn and Kirk Douglas in &quot;Last Train from Gun Hill&quot; (all 1959). 

In the Western &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1963), she played the wife of Sheriff Jeb Rawlings (George Peppard). She appears with Peppard and Debbie Reynolds in the final speaking/singing scenes of the film.

==Television==
She made her television debut on the DuMont series &quot;Gruen Playhouse&quot; in 1952. Jones appeared in several episodes of &quot;Dragnet&quot; starring Jack Webb from 1953-1955, credited as ‘’Caroline Jones’’. She appeared in two Rod Cameron syndicated series, &quot;City Detective&quot; and &quot;State Trooper&quot;, as Betty Fowler in the 1956 episode, &quot;The Paperhanger of Pioche”. Jones also appeared on the CBS anthology series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; in the episode &quot;The Cheney Vase&quot; (1955), as a secretary assisting her scheming boyfriend Darren McGavin in attempting an art theft, and opposite Ruta Lee.

In 1957 she had the lead in the episode &quot;The Girl in the Grass&quot; on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, once again with Ray Milland and Nora Marlowe.

Jones guest-starred three times on the television series &quot;Wagon Train&quot;: in the first-season episode &quot;The John Cameron Story&quot; (1957) and in later color episodes &quot;The Jenna Douglas Story&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Molly Kincaid Story&quot; (1963). Also in 1963 she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best TV Star - Female for portraying quadruplets—one the murder victim and the others suspects—in the &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; episode &quot;Who Killed Sweet Betsy?&quot;

She guest-starred in CBS&#x27;s &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;, with James Best and Jack Mullaney, in the episode &quot;Love on Credit&quot; (1960).

In the 1962–1963 season, Jones guest-starred on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Lloyd Bridges Show&quot;, created by her second husband, television producer Aaron Spelling. While married to Spelling, she appeared on the NBC program &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;.

In 1964, Jones played Morticia Addams in the television series &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, a role which brought her a Golden Globe Award nomination and success as a comedian. She guest-starred on the 1960s TV series &quot;Batman&quot;, playing Marsha, the Queen of Diamonds, and in 1976 appeared as the title character&#x27;s mother, Hippolyta, in the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; TV series. In Tobe Hooper&#x27;s movie &quot;Eaten Alive&quot; (1976), she played a madam running a rural whorehouse. The film also featured Neville Brand, Roberta Collins, and Robert Englund. Her last role was Myrna, the scheming matriarch of the Clegg clan, on the soap opera &quot;Capitol&quot; from the first episode in March 1982 until March 1983, when she already knew that she was dying of cancer. During her occasional absences, actress Marla Adams substituted for her.

She played sporadic television roles in the 1970s including Mrs. Moore, the wife of the plantation owner in the miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;.

==Personal life==

Jones was married four times and had no children. While studying at the Pasadena Playhouse, she married Don Donaldson, a 28-year-old fellow student. The couple soon divorced. 

She converted to Judaism upon marrying Aaron Spelling; the marriage lasted from 1953 until their 1964 separation and divorce.

Her third marriage, in 1968, was to Tony Award-winning Broadway musical director, vocal arranger and co-producer Herbert Greene (who was her vocal coach); she left him in 1977.

Jones&#x27; fourth and final marriage was to Peter Bailey-Britton in 1982, lasting until her death a year later.

==Final years and death==

Jones gained the role of the power-driven political matriarch Myrna Clegg in the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;Capitol&quot; in 1981. The following year, shortly after &quot;Capitol&quot; debuted, she was diagnosed with colon cancer, and played many of her scenes in a wheelchair. The cancer spread quickly to her liver and stomach. Despite the pain, Jones finished the first season.

After being diagnosed with cancer Jones continued to work, telling colleagues that she was being treated for ulcers. After a period of apparent remission, the cancer returned in 1982.

In July 1983, she fell into a coma at her home in West Hollywood, California, where she died on August 3. Her body was cremated the next day and a memorial service was held at Glasband-Willen Mortuary in Altadena, California, on August 5. Her ashes were interred in her mother&#x27;s crypt at Melrose Abbey Memorial Park &amp; Mortuary in Anaheim, California. She donated her Morticia costume and black wig to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and a collection of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; scripts was donated by Bailey-Britton to UCLA.

<text>Novo Mesto (; ; also known by alternative names) is the seventh-largest city of Slovenia. It is the economic and cultural centre of the traditional region of Lower Carniola (southeastern Slovenia) and the seat of the City Municipality of Novo Mesto. It lies on a bend of the Krka River, close to the border with Croatia.

==Name==

Novo Mesto was attested in historical sources in 1365 as &quot;Růdolfswerde&quot; (and as &quot;Rudolfswerd&quot; in 1392 and &quot;Noua Mesta&quot; in 1419). The German name (spelled &quot;Rudolfswerth&quot; in the modern era) is a compound of the personal name &quot;Rudolf&quot; and &quot;wert&quot; &#x27;island, peninsula, land above the water&#x27;, and refers to Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, who conferred town rights upon the settlement in 1365. The parallel German name &quot;Neustadtl&quot; was also in use (attested as &quot;Newestat&quot; in 1365, and probably a translation of the Slovene name). The name used for the settlement before 1365 is unknown. The Slovene name &quot;Novo mesto&quot; literally means &#x27;new town&#x27;; names like this are common in Europe and generally refer to settlements built at a site where an older one was burned or otherwise destroyed. From 1865 to 1918, the town was officially named &quot;Rudolfovo&quot; in Slovene, based on the German name. Following World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the city became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and was officially renamed &quot;Novo mesto&quot;.

==History==
Novo Mesto has been settled since pre-history. The city is one of the most important archeological sites of the Hallstatt culture (Early Iron Age) in Europe and has been nicknamed the &quot;City of Situlas&quot; after numerous situlas found in the area.
Graben Castle on the Krka River, ancestral seat of the noble House of Graben von Stein, was first mentioned in an 1170 deed.
The town itself was founded by the Habsburg archduke Rudolf IV of Austria on 7 April 1365 as &quot;Rudolfswerth&quot;. The Austrian Habsburgs received the Carniolan March from the hands of Louis IV, the Holy Roman Emperor, King of Italy and Duke of Bavaria, in 1335 and in 1364 Rudolf &quot;the Founder&quot; proclaimed himself a Duke of Carniola. The city was connected to the Southern lands since the 1600s by the Kandija Bridge originally a wooden structure, since the 1800s an iron bridge.

During World War II, the city was controlled by Fascist Italy as part of the Province of Ljubljana until Mussolini&#x27;s downfall in 1943. It was then occupied by Nazi Germany until the end of the war.

In 1958, the authorities of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had a motorway built connecting the Slovenian capital Ljubljana and Zagreb in Croatia, which passed through Novo Mesto. The A2 motorway is today part of the European route E70. With its construction, Novo Mesto became much better connected to the rest of Slovenia and the rest of Yugoslavia, and began to grow as an important regional center.

==Demographics==
The population of Novo Mesto is predominantly ethnically Slovene. On the southeast outskirts of the town there is a Roma settlement called Žabjak, also known as Brezje.
Demographic evolution

==Climate==
Novo Mesto has a humid subtropical climate, which is influenced by several factors: the Dinaric Alps, the Alps, the Adriatic Sea, and the continental background. Despite the fact that town is close to the 46th parallel north, the climate is much warmer than places at similar latitudes in North America and East Asia. Prevailing western winds bring warm and moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Lying in partial rain shadow, precipitation is much lower than just to the west, and foehn winds blowing from southwest over the Dinaric alps can bring very warm weather in any month of the year. From the northeast, the town is exposed to cold air originating in eastern Europe and Siberia, which in winter can bring very cold and sometimes snowy weather. The coldest temperature of −25.6 °C was recorded on 17 February 1952, and the highest, 39.9 °C, on 8 August 2013. Precipitation is abundant, most of it failing as rain in warmer months, between May and November. Hail and heavy thunderstorms are very common between May and September, and snow regularly occurs between December and February. Snow is not uncommon in November and March and rare in October and April. Snow fell as early as 21 October 1971 and as late as 20 May 1969. The greatest snow depth was recorded on 17 February 1969, measuring 103 cm. The wettest year on record was 2014, with 1,482 mm of precipitation, and the driest was 2000, with 827 mm.

Novo Mesto has been a hub of artistic creation in various fields: music, literature, and visual arts. The turning point is the September 1920 exhibition named Novo Mesto Spring, which brought together artists of different genres and marks the beginning of avant-garde art in Slovenia.

===Music===
The development of music in Novo Mesto may be traced to the 16th century, with the clergy, e.g. the provost George Slatkonia, the first residential Bishop of Vienna, promulgating the development of vocal music. In 1498 Slatkonia was appointed the singing master (Singmeister) of the choir later known as the Vienna Boys&#x27; Choir.

Accelerated development took place in the 19th century with the establishment of a brass band in 1846, and the establishment of the Lower Carniola Singing Society in 1884. The society laid the foundations of the vocal music in the wider Lower Carniola area. A significant part in the musical development of the town was contributed by students and the teaching staff of the Novo Mesto Grammar School. The school had a quality singing choir led by , Aleš Ottokar and as well as a student orchestra led by . In 1886, a male choir was established in the town in the frame of the Catholic Craftsman Assistants Society. Several classical composers were connected to Novo Mesto, the best known of them being Marjan Kozina, after whom the music school of the town is named, and the expressionist composer Marij Kogoj. In the 20th century, particularly after World War II, a number of influential contemporary (jazz, rock, and pop) music groups appeared and created in the town, the most notable of them being , Dan D and others. In the early 21st century, the most popular pop-rock music group was Dan D, whereas classical music gained two important pieces of work in the frame of the George Slatkonia Vocal Academy, a chamber opera (&quot;The Baptism on the Savica&quot;) and &quot;Te Deum&quot;, a monumental cantata work.

===Literature===
The central literature personalities of Novo Mesto are the writer Janez Trdina (1830–1905), the poet Dragotin Kette (1876–1899), and the poet and essayist Anton Podbevšek (1898–1981). Trdina, after whom the central cultural venue of the town is named Janez Trdina Cultural Centre, lived in Novo Mesto in exile and wrote primarily short fictional stories about the Gorjanci hill range, which he published under the title &quot;Fairytales and Stories about Gorjanci&quot; (Bajke in povesti o Gorjancih). Kette, who lived in Novo Mesto in the time of his studies, wrote lyrical poetry, particularly dedicated to Angela Smola whom he met in the town&#x27;s chapter church. Podbevšek laid the foundations of Slovene lyrical avant-garde poetry. The youngest professional theatre in Slovenia and the first theatre in the town, established in 2005, has been named after him .

===Visual and film arts===
Novo Mesto is the birthplace of the painter and graphic artist Božidar Jakac (1899–1989), who produced one of the most extensive oeuvres of visual arts in Slovenia and was a key organiser of visual arts education and visual arts events in the country. Many of his works as well as of other well-known Slovenian artists are kept at the Jakac House in the town. Other known Novo Mesto visual artists were the painter and the architect . Several notable film artists originate from Novo Mesto, besides Jakac also the film editor Jurij Moškon, and the contemporary film directors , , Nejc Gazvoda, and .

==Religion==
On 7 April 2006, Novo Mesto became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Novo Mesto, which is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Ljubljana.

===Cathedral===
Novo Mesto Cathedral, standing on Kapitelj Hill above the town, is dedicated to Saint Nicholas and is an originally Gothic building that was rebuilt in the Baroque style in the 17th century. The main altar oil painting by Tintoretto, and the side altar paintings by the French 18th century painter Valentin Metzinger, the leading Baroque painter in Slovenia, are on display in the church.

==Economy==
Today, tourism is increasing in Slovenia, and Novo Mesto is feeling some of the effects. The Krka Valley is becoming a place for wine enthusiasts who take tours throughout the Lower Carniola region, tasting locally produced Cviček wine, which is produced by blending several different varieties of local wine.

<text>The Shakespeare apocrypha is a group of plays and poems that have sometimes been attributed to William Shakespeare, but whose attribution is questionable for various reasons. The issue is not to be confused with the debate on Shakespearean authorship, which questions the authorship of the works traditionally attributed to Shakespeare.

== Background ==

In his own lifetime, Shakespeare saw only about half of his plays enter print. Some individual plays were published in quarto, a small, cheap format. Then, in 1623, seven years after Shakespeare&#x27;s death, his fellow actors John Heminges and Henry Condell compiled a folio collection of his complete plays, now known as the First Folio. Heminges and Condell were in a position to do this because they, like Shakespeare, worked for the King&#x27;s Men, the London playing company that produced all of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

In addition to plays, poems were published under Shakespeare&#x27;s name. The collection published as &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; contains genuine poems by Shakespeare along with poems known to have been written by other authors, along with some of unknown authorship. Unattributed poems have also been assigned by some scholars to Shakespeare at various times. See below.

The apocrypha can be categorized under the following headings.

==Plays attributed to Shakespeare during the 17th century, but not included in the First Folio==

Several plays published in quarto during the seventeenth century bear Shakespeare&#x27;s name on the title page or in other documents, but do not appear in the First Folio. Some of these plays (such as &quot;Pericles&quot;) are believed by most scholars of Shakespeare to have been written by him (at least in part). Others, such as &quot;Thomas Lord Cromwell&quot; are so atypically written that it is difficult to believe they really are by Shakespeare.

Scholars have suggested various reasons for the existence of these plays. In some cases, the title page attributions may be lies told by fraudulent printers trading on Shakespeare&#x27;s reputation. In other cases, Shakespeare may have had an editorial role in the plays&#x27; creation, rather than actually writing them, or they may simply be based on a plot outline by Shakespeare. Some may be collaborations between Shakespeare and other dramatists (although the First Folio includes plays such as &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; that are believed to be collaborative, according to modern stylistic analysis). Another explanation for the origins of any or all of the plays is that they were not written for the King&#x27;s Men, were perhaps from early in Shakespeare&#x27;s career, and thus were inaccessible to Heminges and Condell when they compiled the First Folio.

C. F. Tucker Brooke lists forty-two plays conceivably attributable to Shakespeare, many in his own lifetime, but dismisses the majority, leaving only most of those listed below, with some additions.
* &quot;The Birth of Merlin&quot; was published in 1662 as the work of Shakespeare and William Rowley. This attribution is demonstrably fraudulent, or mistaken, as there is unambiguous evidence that the play was written in 1622, six years after Shakespeare&#x27;s death. It is unlikely that Shakespeare and Rowley would have written together, as they were both chief dramatists for rival playing companies. The play has been called &quot;funny, colourful, and fast-paced&quot;, but critical consensus follows Henry Tyrrell&#x27;s conclusion that the play &quot;does not contain in it one single trace of the genius of the bard of Avon&quot;, supplemented by C. F. Tucker Brooke&#x27;s suggestion that Rowley was consciously imitating Shakespeare&#x27;s style.
* &quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot; was originally published anonymously in 1600 (STC 18796). In 1619, a second edition was attributed to Shakespeare as part of William Jaggard&#x27;s False Folio. In fact, the diary of Philip Henslowe records that it was written by Anthony Munday, Michael Drayton, Richard Hathwaye, and Robert Wilson.
* &quot;A Yorkshire Tragedy&quot; was published in 1608 as the work of Shakespeare. Although a minority of readers support this claim, the weight of stylistic evidence supports Thomas Middleton.
* &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot; was published under Shakespeare&#x27;s name. Its uneven writing suggests that the first two acts are by another playwright. In 1868, Nicolaus Delius proposed George Wilkins as this unknown collaborator; a century later, F. D. Hoeneger proposed John Day. In general, critics have accepted that the last three-fifths are mostly Shakespeare&#x27;s, following Gary Taylor&#x27;s claim that by the middle of the Jacobean decade, &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s poetic style had become so remarkably idiosyncratic that it stands out—even in a corrupt text—from that of his contemporaries.&quot;
* &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; was published in quarto in 1634 as a collaboration between Shakespeare and John Fletcher, the young playwright who took over Shakespeare&#x27;s job as chief playwright of the King&#x27;s Men. Mainstream scholarship agrees with this attribution, and the play is widely accepted as a worthy member of the Shakespeare canon, despite its collaborative origins. It is included in its entirety in the Oxford Shakespeare (1986), and in the &quot;Riverside Shakespeare&quot; (1996).
* &quot;Edward III&quot; was published anonymously in 1596. It was first attributed to Shakespeare in a bookseller&#x27;s catalogue published in 1656. Various scholars have suggested Shakespeare&#x27;s possible authorship, since a number of passages appear to bear his stamp, among other sections that are remarkably uninspired. In 1996, Yale University Press became the first major publisher to produce an edition of the play under Shakespeare&#x27;s name, and shortly afterward, the Royal Shakespeare Company performed the play (to mixed reviews). In 2001, the American professional premiere was staged by Pacific Repertory Theatre, which received positive reviews for the endeavour. A consensus is emerging that the play was written by a team of dramatists including Shakespeare early in his career—but exactly who wrote what is still open to debate. William Montgomery edited the play for the Second Edition of the &quot;Complete Oxford Shakespeare&quot; (2005), where it is attributed to &quot;William Shakespeare and Others&quot;&#x27;.
* &quot;The London Prodigal&quot; was printed in 1605 under Shakespeare&#x27;s name. As it is a King&#x27;s Men play, Shakespeare may have had a minor role in its creation, but according to Tucker Brooke, &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s catholicity and psychological insight are conspicuously absent&quot;. Fleay hypothesized that Shakespeare wrote a rough outline or plot and left another playwright to the actual writing.
* &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; survives only in manuscript. Three crossed-out attributions in seventeenth century hands attribute it to Thomas Goffe, Shakespeare, and George Chapman. Professional handwriting expert Charles Hamilton attempted to argue that the play was Shakespeare&#x27;s manuscript of the lost &quot;Cardenio&quot;. However, stylistic analysis strongly indicates Thomas Middleton as the true author of &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;.
* &quot;The &quot;Charles II Library&quot; plays:&quot; in Charles II&#x27;s library, an unknown seventeenth-century person had bound together three quartos of anonymous plays and labelled them &quot;Shakespeare, vol. 1&quot;. As a seventeenth-century attribution, this decision warrants some consideration. The three plays are:
** &quot;Fair Em, the Miller&#x27;s Daughter of Manchester&quot;, written c. 1590. Another candidate for its authorship is Robert Wilson.
** &quot;Mucedorus&quot;, an extremely popular play; it was first printed in 1598 and went through several editions despite the text&#x27;s manifestly corrupt nature. As it is a King&#x27;s Men play, Shakespeare may have had a minor role in its creation or revision, but its true author remains a mystery; Robert Greene is sometimes suggested.
** &quot;The Merry Devil of Edmonton&quot;, first published in 1608. As it is a King&#x27;s Men play, Shakespeare may have had a minor role in its creation, but the play&#x27;s style bears no resemblance to Shakespeare.

==Plays attributed to &quot;W.S.&quot; during the 17th century, and not included in the First Folio==

Some plays were attributed to &quot;W.S.&quot; in the seventeenth century. These initials could refer to Shakespeare, but could also refer to Wentworth Smith, an obscure dramatist.
* &quot;Locrine&quot; was published in 1595 as &quot;Newly set forth, overseen and corrected by W.S.&quot;
* &quot;Thomas Lord Cromwell&quot; was published in 1602 and attributed to &quot;W.S.&quot; Except for a few scholars, such as Ludwig Tieck and August Wilhelm Schlegel, &quot;hardly anyone has thought that Shakespeare was even in the slightest way involved in the production of these plays.&quot;
* &quot;The Puritan&quot; was published in 1607 and attributed to &quot;W.S.&quot; This play is now generally believed to be by Middleton or Smith.

== Plays attributed to Shakespeare after the 17th century ==
A number of anonymous plays have been attributed to Shakespeare by more recent readers and scholars. Many of these claims are supported only by debatable ideas about what constitutes &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s style&quot;. Nonetheless, some of them have been cautiously accepted by mainstream scholarship.
* &quot;Arden of Faversham&quot; is an anonymous play printed in 1592 that has occasionally been claimed for Shakespeare. Its writing style and subject matter, however, are very different from those of Shakespeare&#x27;s other plays. Full attribution is not supported by mainstream scholarship, though stylistic analysis has revealed that Shakespeare likely had a hand in at least scene VIII (the play is not divided into acts). Thomas Kyd is often considered to be the author of much of &quot;Faversham&quot;, but still other writers have been proposed.
* &quot;Edmund Ironside&quot; is an anonymous manuscript play. Eric Sams has argued that it was written by Shakespeare, arguing that it is his earliest extant work, but has convinced few, if any, Shakespearean scholars.
* &quot;Sir Thomas More&quot; survives only in manuscript. It is a play that was written in the 1590s and then revised, possibly as many as ten years later. The play is included in the Second Edition of the Complete Oxford Shakespeare (2005), which attributes the original play to Anthony Munday and Henry Chettle, with later revisions and additions by Thomas Dekker, Shakespeare and Thomas Heywood. A few pages are written by an author (&quot;Hand D&quot;) whom many believe to be Shakespeare, as the handwriting and spellings, as well as the style, seem a good match. The attribution is not accepted by everyone, however, especially since six signatures on legal documents are the only verified authentic examples of Shakespeare&#x27;s handwriting.
* &quot;Thomas of Woodstock&quot;, sometimes also called &quot;Richard II, Part I&quot;, is an anonymous late-sixteenth or early-seventeenth century play depicting the events leading up to the murder of Thomas of Woodstock and which occur immediately prior to the opening scenes of Shakespeare&#x27;s history play &quot;Richard II&quot;. &quot;Thomas of Woodstock&quot; survives only as an anonymous and untitled manuscript lacking its final page (or pages), part of the Egerton Collection deposited in the British Library. Because the play describes the events immediately prior to those set forth in &quot;Richard II&quot;, some scholars have attributed the play to Shakespeare or suggested that it influenced Shakespeare&#x27;s own play. Few of its editors, however, have supported the attribution to Shakespeare. Stylistic analysis led MacDonald P. Jackson to propose Samuel Rowley as a possible author in 2001. Later scholars, most notably Michael Egan, have tried to revive the attribution to Shakespeare.
* &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot;, by Thomas Kyd, is a play with elements reminiscent of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Recent handwriting analysis suggests that portions may have been revised by Shakespeare. In 2013 the Royal Shakespeare Company published an edition attributing the play, in part, to William Shakespeare.
* &quot;A Knack to Know a Knave&quot;. Hanspeter Born has argued that Shakespeare rewrote some scenes in the romantic subplot of &quot;A Knack to Know a Knave&quot;, tentatively attributed by some scholars to Robert Greene.

==Lost plays==
* &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot;. A late sixteenth-century writer, Francis Meres, and a scrap of paper (apparently from a bookseller), both list this title among Shakespeare&#x27;s then-recently published works, but no copy of a play with this title has survived. It may have become lost, or it may represent an alternative title of an existing play, such as &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, or &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;.
* &quot;The History of Cardenio&quot;. This late play by Shakespeare and Fletcher, referred to in several documents, has not survived. It was probably an adaptation of a tale in Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. In 1727, Lewis Theobald produced a play he called &quot;Double Falshood&quot; , which he claimed to have adapted from three manuscripts of a lost play by Shakespeare that he did not name. Counter to that, a professional handwriting expert, Charles Hamilton, claimed that &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (generally considered the work of Thomas Middleton) play is actually Shakespeare&#x27;s manuscript of the lost play &quot;Cardenio&quot;. On the rare occasions when &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; has been revived on the stage, it is sometimes performed under the title &quot;Cardenio&quot;, as in the 2002 production directed by James Kerwin at the 2100 Square Foot Theater in Los Angeles, as well as a production at the Burton Taylor Theatre in 2004. In March 2010, the Arden Shakespeare imprint published an edition of &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; calling it a play by Shakespeare and Fletcher, adapted by Theobold, thus including it officially in Shakespeare&#x27;s canon for the first time. In 2013 the Royal Shakespeare Company published an edition also attributing &quot;Double Falsehood&quot;, in part, to William Shakespeare.
* The lost play called the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; is believed by a few scholars to be an early work by Shakespeare himself. The theory was first postulated by the academic Peter Alexander and is supported by Harold Bloom and Peter Ackroyd, although mainstream Shakespearean scholarship believes it to have been by Thomas Kyd. Bloom&#x27;s hypothesis is that this early version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; was one of Shakespeare&#x27;s first plays, that the theme of the Prince of Denmark was one to which he returned constantly throughout his career and that he continued to revise it even after the canonical &quot;Hamlet&quot; of 1601.

==Hoaxes==

The dream of discovering a new Shakespeare play has also resulted in the creation of at least one hoax. In 1796 William Henry Ireland claimed to have found a lost play of Shakespeare entitled &quot;Vortigern and Rowena&quot;. Ireland had previously released other documents he claimed were by Shakespeare, but &quot;Vortigern&quot; was the first play he attempted. (He later produced another pseudo-Shakespearean play, &quot;Henry II&quot;.) The play was initially accepted by the literary community—albeit not on sight—as genuine. The play was eventually presented at Drury Lane on 2 April 1796, to immediate ridicule, and Ireland eventually admitted to the hoax.

==Apocryphal poems==
Several poems published anonymously have been attributed by scholars to Shakespeare. Others were attributed to him in 17th century manuscripts. None have received universal acceptance. The authorship of some poems published under Shakespeare&#x27;s name in his lifetime has also been questioned.

===&quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot;===

&quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; is a collection of poems first published in 1599 by William Jaggard, later the publisher of Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio. Though the title page attributes the content to Shakespeare, many of the poems were written by others. Some are of unknown authorship and could be by Shakespeare. Jaggard issued an expanded edition of &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; in 1612, containing additional poems on the theme of Helen of Troy, announced on the title page (&quot;Whereunto is newly added two Love Epistles, the first from Paris to Hellen, and Hellen&#x27;s answere back again to Paris&quot;). These were in fact by Thomas Heywood, from his &quot;Troia Britannica,&quot; which Jaggard had published in 1609. Heywood protested the unauthorized copying in his &quot;Apology for Actors&quot; (1612), writing that Shakespeare was &quot;much offended&quot; with Jaggard for making &quot;so bold with his name.&quot; Jaggard withdrew the attribution to Shakespeare from unsold copies of the 1612 edition.

===&quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot;===

This poem was published as an appendix to Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets in 1609. Its authorship has been disputed by several scholars. In 2007 Brian Vickers, in his monograph, &quot;Shakespeare, &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot;, and John Davies of Hereford&quot;, attributes the &quot;Complaint&quot; to John Davies. Other scholars continue to attribute it to Shakespeare.

===&quot;To the Queen&quot;===
&quot;To the Queen&quot; is a short poem praising Queen Elizabeth, probably recited as an epilogue to a royal performance of a play. It was first attributed to Shakespeare by American scholars William Ringler and Steven May, who discovered the poem in 1972 in the notebook of Henry Stanford, who is known to have worked in the household of the Lord Chamberlain. The attribution was supported by James S. Shapiro and Juliet Dusinberre. It was included in 2007 by Jonathan Bate in his complete Shakespeare edition for the Royal Shakespeare Company. The attribution has since been challenged by Michael Hattaway, who argued that the poem is more likely to be by Ben Jonson, and by Helen Hackett, who attributes it to Thomas Dekker.

===&quot;A Funeral Elegy&quot;===
In 1989, using a form of stylometric computer analysis, scholar and forensic linguist Donald Foster attributed &quot;A Funeral Elegy for Master William Peter&quot;, previously ascribed only to &quot;W.S.&quot;, to William Shakespeare, based on an analysis of its grammatical patterns and idiosyncratic word usage. The attribution received extensive press attention from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other newspapers.

Later analyses by scholars Gilles Monsarrat and Brian Vickers demonstrated Foster&#x27;s attribution to be in error, and that the true author was probably John Ford. Foster conceded to Monsarrat in an e-mail message to the SHAKSPER e-mail list in 2002.

===&quot;Shall I Die&quot;===
This nine-verse love lyric was ascribed to Shakespeare in a manuscript collection of verses probably written in the late 1630s. In 1985 Gary Taylor drew attention to the attribution, leading to widespread scholarly discussion of it. The attribution is not widely accepted. Michael Dobson and Stanley Wells state that Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship &quot;cannot be regarded as certain&quot;.

===Epitaphs===

Shakespeare has been identified as the author of two epitaphs to John Combe, a Stratford businessman, and one to Elias James, a brewer who lived in the Blackfriars area of London. Shakespeare certainly knew Combe and is likely to have known James. A joking epitaph is also supposed to have been created for Ben Jonson.

The was on a memorial in the church of St. Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe. The memorial no longer exists but was recorded in the 1633 edition of John Stow&#x27;s &quot;Survey of London&quot;. The text is also present in the same manuscript which preserves &quot;Shall I Die&quot;, where it is ascribed to Shakespeare. The epitaph is a conventional statement of James&#x27; godly life.

The are different. One is a satirical comment on Combe&#x27;s money-lending at 10 per cent interest. The verse says that &quot;he lent money at one-in-ten, and it&#x27;s ten-to-one he&#x27;ll end up in hell&quot;. This is recorded in several variant forms in the 17th and 18th centuries, usually with the story that Shakespeare composed it extempore at a party with Combe present. Shakespeare is said to have written another, more flattering, epitaph after Combe died in 1614. It praises Combe for giving money in his will to the poor. This was said to be affixed to his tomb, which is close to Shakespeare&#x27;s. However, there is no sign of it in the surviving tomb. The first epitaph, in variations, has also been attributed to other writers, addressed to other alleged usurers.

An anecdote recorded in the mid-17th century has Jonson beginning an epitaph to himself with the conventional &quot;&quot;Here lies Ben Jonson&quot; ...&quot;, and Shakespeare completing it with the words &quot;... &quot;who while he lived was a slow thing / And now being dead is no thing.&quot;&quot;

==A counter-orthodox Shakespeare canon and chronology==

Building on the work of W. J. Courthope, Hardin Craig, E. B. Everitt, Seymour Pitcher and others, the scholar Eric Sams (1926–2004), who wrote two books on Shakespeare, edited two early plays, and published over a hundred papers, argued that &quot;Shakespeare was an early starter who rewrote nobody&#x27;s plays but his own&quot;, and that he &quot;may have been a master of structure before he was a master of language&quot;. Shakespeare found accusations of plagiarism (e.g. Greene&#x27;s &quot;beautified with our feathers&quot;) offensive (Sonnets 30, 112).

Trusting the early &#x27;biographical&#x27; sources John Aubrey and Nicholas Rowe, Sams re-assessed Shakespeare&#x27;s early and &#x27;missing&#x27; years, and argued through detailed textual analysis that Shakespeare began writing plays from the mid-1580s, in a style not now recognisably Shakespearean. The so-called &#x27;Source Plays&#x27; and &#x27;Derivative Plays&#x27; (&quot;The Famous Victories of Henry V&quot;, &quot;The Taming of a Shrew&quot;, &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot;, &quot;King Leir&quot;, etc.), and the so-called &#x27;Bad Quartos&#x27;, are (compositors&#x27; errors aside) his own first versions of famous later plays. As many of the Quarto title-pages proclaim, Shakespeare was an assiduous reviser of his own work, rewriting, enlarging and emending to the end of his life. He &quot;&quot;struck the second heat&quot; / upon the Muses&#x27; anvil,&quot; as Ben Jonson put it in the Folio verse tribute.

Sams dissented from 20th-century orthodoxy, rejecting the theory of memorial reconstruction by forgetful actors as &quot;wrong-headed&quot;. &quot;Authorial revision of early plays is the only rational alternative.&quot; The few unofficial copies referred to in the preamble to the Folio were the 1619 quartos, mostly already superseded plays, for &quot;Shakespeare was disposed to release his own popular early version[s] for acting and printing because his own masterly revision[s] would soon be forthcoming&quot;. Sams believed that Shakespeare in his retirement was revising his oeuvre &quot;for definitive publication&quot;. The &quot;apprentice plays&quot; which had been reworked were naturally omitted from the Folio.

Sams also rejected 20th century orthodoxy on Shakespeare&#x27;s collaboration, arguing that, with the exception of &quot;Sir Thomas More&quot;, &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, and &quot;Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;, the plays were solely his, though many were only partly revised. By Sams&#x27; authorship- and dating-arguments, Shakespeare wrote not only the earliest &quot;modern&quot; chronicle play, &quot;The Troublesome Reign&quot;, c. 1588, but also &quot;the earliest known modern comedy and tragedy&quot;, &quot;A Shrew&quot;, c. 1588, and the Ur-&quot;Hamlet&quot; (c. 1587–88, substantially = the 1603 Quarto).

Sams also argued, more briefly, that &quot;there is some evidence of Shakespearean authorship&quot; of &quot;&quot;A Pleasant Commodie of Fair Em the Millers Daughter, with the loue of William the Conqueror&quot;, written before 1586, and of &quot;The Lamentable Tragedie of Locrine&quot; written mid-1580s and &quot;newly set foorth, ouerseene and corrected, by W.S.&quot; in 1595.

Volume two was unfinished at the time of Sams&#x27; death.

<text>In numerical linear algebra, the QR algorithm or QR iteration is an eigenvalue algorithm: that is, a procedure to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. The QR algorithm was developed in the late 1950s by John G. F. Francis and by Vera N. Kublanovskaya, working independently. The basic idea is to perform a QR decomposition, writing the matrix as a product of an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix, multiply the factors in the reverse order, and iterate.

==The practical QR algorithm==
Formally, let be a real matrix of which we want to compute the eigenvalues, and let . At the -th step (starting with ), we compute the QR decomposition where is an orthogonal matrix (i.e., ) and is an upper triangular matrix. We then form . Note that
formula_1
so all the are similar and hence they have the same eigenvalues. The algorithm is numerically stable because it proceeds by &quot;orthogonal&quot; similarity transforms.

Under certain conditions, the matrices &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot; converge to a triangular matrix, the Schur form of &quot;A&quot;. The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are listed on the diagonal, and the eigenvalue problem is solved. In testing for convergence it is impractical to require exact zeros, but the Gershgorin circle theorem provides a bound on the error.

===Using Hessenberg form===
In the above crude form the iterations are relatively expensive. This can be mitigated by first bringing the matrix to upper Hessenberg form (which costs formula_2 arithmetic operations using a technique based on Householder reduction), with a finite sequence of orthogonal similarity transforms, somewhat like a two-sided QR decomposition. (For QR decomposition, the Householder reflectors are multiplied only on the left, but for the Hessenberg case they are multiplied on both left and right.) Determining the QR decomposition of an upper Hessenberg matrix costs formula_3 arithmetic operations. Moreover, because the Hessenberg form is already nearly upper-triangular (it has just one nonzero entry below each diagonal), using it as a starting point reduces the number of steps required for convergence of the QR algorithm.

If the original matrix is symmetric, then the upper Hessenberg matrix is also symmetric and thus tridiagonal, and so are all the . In this case reaching Hessenberg form costs formula_4 arithmetic operations using a technique based on Householder reduction. Determining the QR decomposition of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix costs formula_5 operations.

===Iteration phase===
If a Hessenberg matrix formula_6 has element formula_7 for some formula_8, i.e., if one of the elements just below the diagonal is in fact zero, then it decomposes into blocks whose eigenproblems may be solved separately; an eigenvalue is either an eigenvalue of the submatrix of the first formula_9 rows and columns, or an eigenvalue of the submatrix of remaining rows and columns. The purpose of the QR iteration step is to shrink one of these formula_10 elements so that effectively a small block along the diagonal is split off from the bulk of the matrix. In the case of a real eigenvalue that is usually the formula_11 block in the lower right corner (in which case element formula_12 holds that eigenvalue), whereas in the case of a pair of conjugate complex eigenvalues it is the formula_13 block in the lower right corner.

The rate of convergence depends on the separation between eigenvalues, so a practical algorithm will use shifts, either explicit or implicit, to increase separation and accelerate convergence. A typical symmetric QR algorithm isolates each eigenvalue (then reduces the size of the matrix) with only one or two iterations, making it efficient as well as robust.

====A single iteration with explicit shift====
The steps of a QR iteration with explicit shift on a real Hessenberg matrix formula_6 are:
# Pick a shift formula_15 and subtract it from all diagonal elements, producing the matrix formula_16. A basic strategy is to use formula_17, but there are more refined strategies that would further accelerate convergence. The idea is that formula_18 should be close to an eigenvalue, since making this shift will accelerate convergence to that eigenvalue.
# Perform a sequence of Givens rotations formula_19 on formula_16, where formula_21 acts on rows formula_22 and formula_23, and formula_21 is chosen to zero out position formula_25 of formula_26. This produces the upper triangular matrix formula_27. The orthogonal factor formula_28 would be formula_29, but it is neither necessary nor efficient to produce that explicitly.
# Now multiply formula_30 by the Givens matrices formula_31, formula_32, …, formula_33 on the right, where formula_34 instead acts on columns formula_22 and formula_36. This produces the matrix formula_37, which is again on Hessenberg form.
# Finally undo the shift by adding formula_18 to all diagonal entries. The result is formula_39. Since formula_40 commutes with formula_41, we have that formula_42.
The purpose of the shift is to change which Givens rotations are chosen.

In more detail, the structure of one of these formula_21 matrices are
formula_44
where the formula_41 in the upper left corner is an formula_46 identity matrix, and the two scalars formula_47 and formula_48 are determined by what rotation angle formula_49 is appropriate for zeroing out position formula_25. It is not necessary to exhibit formula_49; the factors formula_52 and formula_53 can be determined directly from elements in the matrix formula_21 should act on. Nor is it necessary to produce the whole matrix; multiplication (from the left) by formula_21 only affects rows formula_56 and formula_36, so it is easier to just update those two rows in place. Likewise, for the Step 3 multiplication by formula_34 from the right, it is sufficient to remember formula_22, formula_60, and formula_61.

If using the simple formula_17 strategy, then at the beginning of Step 2 we have a matrix
formula_63
where the formula_64 denotes “could be whatever”. The first Givens rotation formula_65 zeroes out the formula_66 position of this, producing
formula_67
Each new rotation zeroes out another subdiagonal element, thus increasing the number of known zeroes until we are at
formula_68
The final rotation formula_69 has formula_70 chosen so that formula_71. If formula_72, as is typically the case when we approach convergence, then formula_73 and formula_74. Making this rotation produces
formula_75
which is our upper triangular matrix. But now we reach Step 3, and need to start rotating data between columns. The first rotation acts on columns formula_76 and formula_77, producing
formula_78
The expected pattern is that each rotation moves some nonzero value from the diagonal out to the subdiagonal, returning the matrix to Hessenberg form. This ends at
formula_79
Algebraically the form is unchanged, but numerically the element in position formula_80 has gotten a lot closer to zero: there used to be a factor formula_53 gap between it and the diagonal element above, but now the gap is more like a factor formula_82, and another iteration would make it factor formula_83; we have quadratic convergence. Practically that means formula_84 iterations per eigenvalue suffice for convergence, and thus overall we can complete in formula_85 QR steps, each of which does a mere formula_86 arithmetic operations (or as little as formula_85 operations, in the case that formula_88 is symmetric).

== Visualization ==

The basic QR algorithm can be visualized in the case where &quot;A&quot; is a positive-definite symmetric matrix. In that case, &quot;A&quot; can be depicted as an ellipse in 2 dimensions or an ellipsoid in higher dimensions. The relationship between the input to the algorithm and a single iteration can then be depicted as in Figure 1 (click to see an animation). Note that the LR algorithm is depicted alongside the QR algorithm.

A single iteration causes the ellipse to tilt or &quot;fall&quot; towards the x-axis. In the event where the large semi-axis of the ellipse is parallel to the x-axis, one iteration of QR does nothing. Another situation where the algorithm &quot;does nothing&quot; is when the large semi-axis is parallel to the y-axis instead of the x-axis. In that event, the ellipse can be thought of as balancing precariously without being able to fall in either direction. In both situations, the matrix is diagonal. A situation where an iteration of the algorithm &quot;does nothing&quot; is called a fixed point. The strategy employed by the algorithm is iteration towards a fixed-point. Observe that one fixed point is stable while the other is unstable. If the ellipse were tilted away from the unstable fixed point by a very small amount, one iteration of QR would cause the ellipse to tilt away from the fixed point instead of towards. Eventually though, the algorithm would converge to a different fixed point, but it would take a long time.

=== Finding eigenvalues versus finding eigenvectors ===

It&#x27;s worth pointing out that finding even a single eigenvector of a symmetric matrix is not computable (in exact real arithmetic according to the definitions in computable analysis). This difficulty exists whenever the multiplicities of a matrix&#x27;s eigenvalues are not knowable. On the other hand, the same problem does not exist for finding eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a matrix are always computable.

We will now discuss how these difficulties manifest in the basic QR algorithm. This is illustrated in Figure 2. Recall that the ellipses represent positive-definite symmetric matrices. As the two eigenvalues of the input matrix approach each other, the input ellipse changes into a circle. A circle corresponds to a multiple of the identity matrix. A near-circle corresponds to a near-multiple of the identity matrix whose eigenvalues are nearly equal to the diagonal entries of the matrix. Therefore, the problem of approximately finding the eigenvalues is shown to be easy in that case. But notice what happens to the semi-axes of the ellipses. An iteration of QR (or LR) tilts the semi-axes less and less as the input ellipse gets closer to being a circle. The eigenvectors can only be known when the semi-axes are parallel to the x-axis and y-axis. The number of iterations needed to achieve near-parallelism increases without bound as the input ellipse becomes more circular.

While it may be impossible to compute the eigendecomposition of an arbitrary symmetric matrix, it is always possible to perturb the matrix by an arbitrarily small amount and compute the eigendecomposition of the resulting matrix. In the case when the matrix is depicted as a near-circle, the matrix can be replaced with one whose depiction is a perfect circle. In that case, the matrix is a multiple of the identity matrix, and its eigendecomposition is immediate. Be aware though that the resulting eigenbasis can be quite far from the original eigenbasis.

=== Speeding up: Shifting and deflation ===
The slowdown when the ellipse gets more circular has a converse: It turns out that when the ellipse gets more stretched - and less circular - then the rotation of the ellipse becomes faster. Such a stretch can be induced when the matrix formula_89 which the ellipse represents gets replaced with formula_90 where formula_91 is approximately the smallest eigenvalue of formula_89. In this case, the ratio of the two semi-axes of the ellipse approaches formula_93. In higher dimensions, shifting like this makes the length of the smallest semi-axis of an ellipsoid small relative to the other semi-axes, which speeds up convergence to the smallest eigenvalue, but does not speed up convergence to the other eigenvalues. This becomes useless when the smallest eigenvalue is fully determined, so the matrix must then be &quot;deflated&quot;, which simply means removing its last row and column.

The issue with the unstable fixed point also needs to be addressed. The shifting heuristic is often designed to deal with this problem as well: Practical shifts are often discontinuous and randomised. Wilkinson&#x27;s shift—which is well-suited for symmetric matrices like the ones we&#x27;re visualising—is in particular discontinuous.

== The implicit QR algorithm ==
In modern computational practice, the QR algorithm is performed in an implicit version which makes the use of multiple shifts easier to introduce. The matrix is first brought to upper Hessenberg form formula_94 as in the explicit version; then, at each step, the first column of formula_95 is transformed via a small-size Householder similarity transformation to the first column of formula_96 (or formula_97), where formula_96, of degree formula_99, is the polynomial that defines the shifting strategy (often formula_100, where formula_91 and formula_102 are the two eigenvalues of the trailing formula_103 principal submatrix of formula_95, the so-called &quot;implicit double-shift&quot;). Then successive Householder transformations of size formula_105 are performed in order to return the working matrix formula_95 to upper Hessenberg form. This operation is known as &quot;bulge chasing&quot;, due to the peculiar shape of the non-zero entries of the matrix along the steps of the algorithm. As in the first version, deflation is performed as soon as one of the sub-diagonal entries of formula_95 is sufficiently small.

===Renaming proposal===
Since in the modern implicit version of the procedure no QR decompositions are explicitly performed, some authors, for instance Watkins, suggested changing its name to &quot;Francis algorithm&quot;. Golub and Van Loan use the term &quot;Francis QR step&quot;.

== Interpretation and convergence ==
The QR algorithm can be seen as a more sophisticated variation of the basic &quot;power&quot; eigenvalue algorithm. Recall that the power algorithm repeatedly multiplies &quot;A&quot; times a single vector, normalizing after each iteration. The vector converges to an eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue. Instead, the QR algorithm works with a complete basis of vectors, using QR decomposition to renormalize (and orthogonalize). For a symmetric matrix &quot;A&quot;, upon convergence, &quot;AQ&quot; = &quot;QΛ&quot;, where &quot;Λ&quot; is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues to which &quot;A&quot; converged, and where &quot;Q&quot; is a composite of all the orthogonal similarity transforms required to get there. Thus the columns of &quot;Q&quot; are the eigenvectors.

== History ==
The QR algorithm was preceded by the &quot;LR algorithm&quot;, which uses the LU decomposition instead of the QR decomposition. The QR algorithm is more stable, so the LR algorithm is rarely used nowadays. However, it represents an important step in the development of the QR algorithm.

The LR algorithm was developed in the early 1950s by Heinz Rutishauser, who worked at that time as a research assistant of Eduard Stiefel at ETH Zurich. Stiefel suggested that Rutishauser use the sequence of moments &quot;y&quot;0T &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot; &quot;x&quot;0, &quot;k&quot; = 0, 1, ... (where &quot;x&quot;0 and &quot;y&quot;0 are arbitrary vectors) to find the eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot;. Rutishauser took an algorithm of Alexander Aitken for this task and developed it into the &quot;quotient–difference algorithm&quot; or &quot;qd algorithm&quot;. After arranging the computation in a suitable shape, he discovered that the qd algorithm is in fact the iteration &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot; = &quot;L&quot;&quot;k&quot;&quot;U&quot;&quot;k&quot; (LU decomposition), &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1 = &quot;U&quot;&quot;k&quot;&quot;L&quot;&quot;k&quot;, applied on a tridiagonal matrix, from which the LR algorithm follows.

== Other variants ==
One variant of the &quot;QR algorithm&quot;, &quot;the Golub-Kahan-Reinsch&quot; algorithm starts with reducing a general matrix into a bidiagonal one. This variant of the &quot;QR algorithm&quot; for the computation of singular values was first described by . The LAPACK subroutine DBDSQR implements this iterative method, with some modifications to cover the case where the singular values are very small . Together with a first step using Householder reflections and, if appropriate, QR decomposition, this forms the DGESVD routine for the computation of the singular value decomposition. The QR algorithm can also be implemented in infinite dimensions with corresponding convergence results.

<text>On 9 March 1847, during the Mexican–American War, the United States military made an amphibious landing and besieged the key Mexican seaport of Veracruz. The port surrendered twenty days later. The U.S. forces then marched inland to Mexico City.

==Background==
After the battles of Monterrey and Buena Vista, much of Zachary Taylor&#x27;s Army of Occupation was transferred to the command of Major General Winfield Scott in support of the upcoming campaign. That campaign, determined by Scott and other Washington officials, would be a Veracruz landing and an advance inland. Mexican military intelligence knew in advance of U.S. plans to attack Veracruz, but internal government turmoil left them powerless to send crucial reinforcements before the American assault commenced.

==Opposing forces==
==Mexican defenses==
Veracruz was considered to be the strongest fortress in North America at the time. Brigadier General Juan Esteban Morales commanded a garrison of 3,360 soldiers occupying three major forts guarding Veracruz:
* Fort Santiago – south end of town
* Fort Concepción – north end of town
** These two forts included 3,360 troops and 89 guns: artillery, 2nd and 8th infantry regiments, 3rd Light Regiment, a picket of 11th Regt., Puebla Libres, Orizaba, Veracruz, Oaxaca and Tehuantepec national guards. Battalions, sappers and enlisted marines.
* Fort San Juan de Ulúa – offshore on the Gallega Reef. Gen. Jose Durán with 1,030 troops and 135 guns: artillery, Puebla and Jamiltepec activo battalions, companies of Tuxpan, Tampico and Alvardo activo battalions.
* See Orders of Battle Mexican War.

==Landings==

The Americans arrived at Anton Lizardo, Veracruz in early March. Scott agreed with Conner&#x27;s suggestion for a landing site at Collado Beach, south of Veracruz. The 1st Regular Division under Worth was chosen to make the landing first, followed by Patterson&#x27;s volunteers and then Twiggs&#x27; regular division.

Conner&#x27;s Mosquito Fleet moved to within of the beach to supply covering fire if necessary. By 12:15 pm on 9 March, this force was off Collado Beach, followed by larger vessels over the next three hours and a signal for landing the surfboats at 5:30 pm. Just before the main force touched the beach, a gig dashed ahead, and General Worth with his staff jumped ashore. Worth&#x27;s whole division landed without firing or receiving a single shot. By 11 pm, Scott&#x27;s entire army had been brought ashore without a single man lost.

==Siege==
===Envelopment===
Once ashore Patterson&#x27;s division began marching northward to effect a complete envelopment of the city. One of Patterson&#x27;s brigades under Gideon Pillow drove off a Mexican cavalry unit at Malibrán, cutting off the Alvarado road and the city&#x27;s water supply. Quitman and Shields managed to drive off with one shot the cavalry attempting to prevent the investment. By 13 March, the U.S. had completed a siege line from Collado in the south to Playa Vergara in the north. On 17 March, siege lines were dug for Scott&#x27;s siege artillery, sufficient for taking the city but not Ulua.

===Investment===
The besiegers were plagued by sorties from the city, and Col. Juan Aguayo used the cover of a storm to slip his Alvarado garrison into Veracruz. Commodore Matthew C. Perry, Conner&#x27;s successor, returned from Norfolk, Virginia after making repairs to , on 20 March. Perry and Conner met with Scott regarding the Navy&#x27;s role in the siege, and offered six guns that were to be operated by sailors from the ships. The naval battery was constructed under the direction of Captain Robert E. Lee from the city walls.

On March 22, Morales declined a surrender demand from Scott, and the American batteries opened fire at 4:15 pm followed by those of Commander Josiah Tattnall III&#x27;s Mosquito Fleet at 5:45 pm. The Naval battery&#x27;s heavy cannonballs easily broke the coral walls. Congreve rockets were fired into the defenses and the combined fire forced the abandonment of Fort Santiago and Mexican morale began to drop as civilian deaths reached the hundreds.

On March 24, Persifor F. Smith&#x27;s brigade captured a Mexican soldier with reports that Antonio López de Santa Anna was marching an army from Mexico City to the relief of Veracruz. Scott dispatched Colonel William S. Harney with 100 dragoons to inspect any approaches that Santa Anna might make. Harney reported about 2,000 Mexicans and a battery not far away, and he called for reinforcements. General Patterson led a mixed group of volunteers and dragoons to Harney&#x27;s aid and cleared the force from their positions, chasing them to Medellin.

===Surrender===
Scott made plans for an assault on the city when on 25 March, the Mexicans called for a cease-fire to evacuate women and children which Scott refused. That night, Morales&#x27; council of war advised surrender prompting Morales to resign while General José Juan Landero assumed command. A truce was called at 8 am on 26 March while terms of surrender were negotiated and concluded by 27 March. On 29 March, the Mexicans officially surrendered their garrisons in Veracruz and Fort Ulúa and later that day, the U.S. flag flew over San Juan de Ulúa.

==Aftermath==
The obstacle to an advancement to Mexico City was removed and Scott made immediate plans to leave a small garrison at Veracruz and march inland, his first objective being Jalapa. Along the way, Scott would in fact encounter a sizable Mexican army under Santa Anna at the Battle of Cerro Gordo.

<doc id="594077" wikidata="Q1512312" url="?curid=594077" title="List of chief ministers of Tamil Nadu">
<text>The chief minister of Tamil Nadu is the chief executive of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. In accordance with the Constitution of India, the governor is a state&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; head, but &quot;de facto&quot; executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, the state&#x27;s governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given that he has the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister&#x27;s term is for five years and is subject to no term limits.

Since 1952, Tamil Nadu has had 12 chief ministers, 13 including V. R. Nedunchezhiyan, who twice acted in the role. The longest-serving chief minister, M. Karunanidhi from Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam held the office for over eighteen years in multiple tenures, while he was the one who had the largest gap between two terms (nearly thirteen years). The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam&#x27;s former general secretary J. Jayalalithaa has the second-longest tenure, and its founder M. G. Ramachandran, the first actor to become the chief minister in India has the third-longest tenure, while his wife V. N. Janaki Ramachandran has the shortest tenure (only 23 days). K. Kamaraj resigned his post of his own free will and devoted all of his energy to the revitalization of the Indian National Congress party; he was responsible for the elevation of Lal Bahadur Shastri to the position of Prime Minister of the Republic of India following the death of Jawaharlal Nehru and of Indira Gandhi following the death of Lal Bahadur Shastri. C. Rajagopalachari served as the last Governor-General of the Union of India before becoming chief minister of undivided Madras State. There have been four instances of president&#x27;s rule in Tamil Nadu, most recently in 1991.

The current incumbent is M. K. Stalin of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam since 7 May 2021.

==List of chief ministers==
The Madras Presidency, headquartered in Fort St. George, India, was a presidency of India that comprised present day Tamil Nadu, the Malabar region of North Kerala, the coastal and Rayalaseema regions of Andhra Pradesh, and the Bellary, Dakshina Kannada, and Udupi districts of Karnataka. It was established in 1653 to be the headquarters of the English settlements on the Coromandel Coast.

The territory under the presidency comprised only Madrasapattinam and its surrounding regions. But, after the Anglo-French wars and the consequent alliance between the English East India Company and the Nawab of Arcot, it was expanded to comprise the region from the Northern Circars to Cape Comorin. The governance structure also evolved from a modest secretariat with a single secretary for the Public Department in 1670 to six departments overseen by a chief secretary by 1920.

The Indian Councils Act 1861 set up the Madras Legislative Council as an advisory body, without powers, through which the colonial administration obtained advice and assistance from able and willing Indian business leaders. But membership was selected (not elected) and was not representative of the masses.

With the enactment of the Government of India Act 1919, the first legislature was formed in 1920 after general elections. The term of the legislative council was three years. It had 132 members, of whom 34 were nominated by the governor and the rest were elected. Under the &quot;Government of India Act 1935&quot;, a bicameral legislature was set up with a legislative assembly consisting of 215 members and a legislative council having 56 members. The first legislative assembly under this act was constituted in July 1937. The legislative council was a permanent body, with a third of its members retiring every 3 years and having the power to decide on bills passed by the assembly.

In 1939, the Governor-General of India declared India&#x27;s entry into World War II without consulting the Imperial Legislative Council. The Indian National Congress protested by asking all its elected representatives to resign from governments. Then it came back to power in 1946 after new provincial elections.

Madras State, the precursor to the present-day state of Tamil Nadu, was created after India became a republic on 26 January 1950. It comprised present-day Tamil Nadu and parts of present-day Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala. The first legislature of the Madras State to be elected on the basis of universal suffrage was constituted on 1 March 1952, after the general elections held in January 1952.

The state was split up along linguistic lines in 1953, carving out Andhra State. Under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the states of Kerala, and Mysore State were carved out of Madras State. Under the Andhra Pradesh and Madras Alteration of Boundaries Act, 1959, with effect from 1 April 1960, Tiruttani taluk and Pallipattu sub-taluk of Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh were transferred to Madras in exchange for territories from the Chingelput and Salem districts.

;Change in nomenclature
During the term of the fourth assembly on 18 July 1967, the house unanimously adopted and recommended that steps be taken by the state government to secure the necessary amendment to the Constitution of India to change the name of Madras State to Tamil Nadu. Accordingly, the Madras State (Alteration of Name) Act, 1968 (Central Act 53 of 1968) was passed by the Parliament of India and came into force on 14 January 1969. Consequently, the nomenclature &quot;Madras Legislative Assembly&quot; was changed to &quot;Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly&quot;. From 1967 onward, the strength of the assembly continued to remain at 234 plus a nominated member.

From 1952 to 1986, the state had a parliamentary system of government with two democratically elected houses, the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council. On 14 May 1986, the state government passed a resolution to abolish the legislative council in the state, which was then moved and adopted by the house. On 1 November 1986, Tamil Nadu became a state with a unicameral legislature, and since then, several times, the state government has taken steps to reconstitute the legislative council, but they have failed for so long. The Tamil Nadu Legislative Council has not been constituted in the state till date.

<text>Natural freshwater lakes in Australia are rare due to the general absence of glacial and tectonic activity in Australia.

== Types ==
Most lakes in Australia fall within one of five categories. Excluding lakes and lagoons created by man-made dams for water storage and other purposes, one can identify the following:
* coastal lakes and lagoons including perched lakes;
* natural freshwater inland lakes, often ephemeral and some part of wetland or swamp areas;
* the Main Range containing mainland Australia&#x27;s five glacial lakes. In Tasmania, due to glaciation, there are a large number of natural freshwater lakes on the central plateau, many of which have been enlarged or modified by hydro-electric developments;
* predominantly dry, salt lakes in the flat desert regions of the country lacking organised drainage; and
* lakes created in volcanic remnants.

<doc id="594086" wikidata="Q11865729" url="?curid=594086" title="Podiatry">
<text>Podiatry ( ), or podiatric medicine and surgery ( ), is a branch of medicine devoted to the study, diagnosis, and treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle and lower limb. The healthcare professional is known as a podiatrist. The US podiatric medical school curriculum includes lower extremity anatomy, general human anatomy, physiology, general medicine, physical assessment, biochemistry, neurobiology, pathophysiology, genetics and embryology, microbiology, histology, pharmacology, women&#x27;s health, physical rehabilitation, sports medicine, research, ethics and jurisprudence, biomechanics, general principles of orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, and foot and ankle surgery.

Podiatry is practiced as a specialty in many countries. In Australia, graduates of recognised academic programs can register through the Podiatry Board of Australia as a &quot;podiatrist&quot;, and those with additional recognised training may also receive endorsement to prescribe or administer restricted medications and/or seek specialist registration as a &quot;podiatric surgeon&quot;.

Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) data shows that a general podiatrist with a single specialty earns a median salary of $230,357, while one with a multi-specialty practice type earns $270,263. However, a podiatry surgeon makes more with a single specialty, with the median at $304,474 compared to the multispecialty of $286,201. First-year salaries around $150,000 with performance and productivity incentives are common. Private practice revenues for solo podiatrists vary widely, with the majority of solo practices grossing between $200,000 and $600,000 before overhead.

==History==

The professional care of feet existed in ancient Egypt, as depicted by bas-relief carvings at the entrance to Ankmahor&#x27;s tomb from about 2400 BC.

Hippocrates described the treatment of corns and calluses by physically reducing the hard skin and removing the cause. The skin scrapers which he invented for this purpose were the original scalpels.

Until the turn of the 20th century, podiatrists were independently licensed physicians, separate from the rest of organized medicine. Lewis Durlacher, appointed as surgeon-podiatrist to the British royal household in 1823, called for podiatry to be a protected profession.

Prominent figures including Napoleon and French kings employed personal podiatrists. President Abraham Lincoln sent his personal podiatrist, Isachar Zachrie, on confidential missions to confer with leaders of the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War.

The first podiatric society was established in New York in 1895, and still operates there today as NYSPMA. The first podiatric school opened in 1911. One year later, the British established a podiatric society at the London Foot Hospital; a school was added in 1919. The first American podiatric journal appeared in 1907, followed in 1912 by a UK journal. In Australia, professional podiatric associations were organized as early as 1924, followed by a podiatric training center and professional podiatric journal in 1939.

==Specific country practices==

===Australia===
In Australia, podiatry is considered an allied health profession and is practised by individuals licensed by the Podiatry Board of Australia.

Australia recognizes two levels of professional accreditation (General Podiatrist and Podiatric Surgeon), with ongoing lobbying for the recognition of other subspecialties. Some Commonwealth countries recognize Australian qualifications, allowing Australian podiatrists to practise abroad.

====Registration and regulation====
Australian podiatrists must register with the Podiatry Board of Australia, which regulates podiatrists and podiatric surgeons. The board also assesses foreign-trained registrants in conjunction with the Australian &amp; New Zealand Podiatry Accreditation Council (ANZPAC). It recognizes three pathways to attain specialist registration as a podiatric surgeon:

# Fellowship of the Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons
# Doctor of Podiatric Surgery, University of Western Australia
# Eligibility for Fellowship of the Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons

Until 21 November 2019, ANZPAC approved the Doctor of Podiatric Surgery program of study offered by the University of Western Australia as providing a qualification for the purpose of specialist registration as a podiatric surgeon.

====Education and training====
To enter an undergraduate Podiatric Medicine program, applicants must have completed a Year 12 Certificate with an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR). Cut-off scores from the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC) generally range from 70.00 to 95.00; prospective students who are 21 or older can instead apply directly to the university. The UWA DPM program has admission requirements of: completion of a UWA bachelor&#x27;s degree or equivalent, a minimum GPA of 5.0 from the most recent three years (FTE) of valid study, suitable GAMSAT score, and English language competency. There is no interview requirement for the DPM at UWA (applications are handled via the university).

Australian podiatrists complete an undergraduate degree ranging from 3 to 4 years of education. The first 2 years of this program are generally focused on various biomedical science subjects, including functional anatomy, microbiology, biochemistry, physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, evidence-based medicine, sociology, and patient psychology, similar to the medical curriculum. The following year focuses on podiatry-specific areas such as podiatric anatomy &amp; biomechanics, human gait, podiatric orthopaedics (the non-surgical management of foot abnormalities), podopaediatrics, sports medicine, rheumatology, diabetes, vascular medicine, mental health, wound care, neuroscience &amp; neurology, pharmacology, general medicine, general pathology, local and general anaesthesia, minor and major podiatric surgical procedural techniques such as partial and total nail avulsions, matricectomy, cryotherapy, wound debridement, enucleation, suturing, other cutaneous and electro-surgical procedures and theoretical understanding of procedures performed by orthopaedic and podiatric surgeons.

Australian podiatric surgeons are specialist podiatrists with further advanced training in medicine and pharmacology, and training in foot surgery. Podiatrists wishing to pursue specialisation in podiatric surgery must meet the requirements for Fellowship with the Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons. They must complete a 4-year degree, including 2 years of didactic study and 2 years of clinical experience, followed by a master&#x27;s degree with a focus on biomechanics, medicine, surgery, general surgery, advanced pharmacology, advanced medical imaging, and clinical pathology. They then qualify for the status of Registrar with the Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons. Following surgical training with a podiatric surgeon (3–5 years), rotations within other medical and surgeons&#x27; disciplines, overseas clinical rotations, and passing oral and written exams, Registrars may qualify for Fellowship status. Fellows are then given Commonwealth accreditation under the Health Insurance Act, recognising them as providers of professional attention for the purposes of health insurance rebates.

====Australian podiatric medical schools====
The following podiatric teaching centres are accredited by the Australian and New Zealand Podiatry Accreditation Council (ANZPAC):

* University of Western Australia
* Charles Sturt University
* La Trobe University
* University of Western Sydney
* University of South Australia
* University of Newcastle (Australia)
* Queensland University of Technology
* Central Queensland University
* Southern Cross University
* Auckland University of Technology (in New Zealand)

Some, including Charles Sturt University and University of Western Sydney, offer the degree Bachelor of Podiatric Medicine; others offer postgraduate degrees, such as the University of Western Australia&#x27;s Doctor of Podiatric Medicine, and La Trobe University&#x27;s Master of Podiatric Practice.

Two more podiatric schools are being developed, at the Australian Catholic University and the University of Ballarat.

====Prescribing of scheduled medicines and referral rights====
The prescribing rights of Australian podiatrists vary by state. All states allow registered podiatrists to use local anaesthesia for minor surgeries.

In Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales: registered podiatrists and podiatric surgeons with an endorsement of scheduled medicines may prescribe relevant schedule 4 poisons.

In Western Australia and South Australia, podiatrists with Master&#x27;s degrees in Podiatry and extensive training in pharmacology are authorised to prescribe Schedule 2, 3, 4, or 8 medicines (Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency).

In Queensland, Fellows of the Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons are authorised to prescribe a range of Schedule 4 drugs and one Schedule 8 drug.

Prescriptions written by podiatrists do not qualify for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, despite lobbying to change this.

Some referrals from podiatrists (plain x-rays of the foot, leg, knee, and femur, and ultrasound examination of soft tissue conditions of the foot) are rebated by Medicare, while others (CTs, MRIs, bone scans, pathology testing, and other specialist medical practitioners) are not eligible for Medicare rebates.

===Canada===
In Canada, the definition and scope of the practice of podiatry varies by province. A number of provinces, including British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec, accept the qualification of Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM); in Quebec, other academic designations may also register.

In 2004, Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières started the first and only program of Podiatric Medicine in Canada based on the American definition of podiatry. This program enlists 25 students yearly across Canada and leads to a DPM upon obtaining 195 credits.

The province of Ontario has been registering chiropodists since 1944, with 701 chiropodists and 54 podiatrists registered by the College of Chiropodists of Ontario as of December 31, 2019. Ontario makes a distinction between podiatrists and chiropodists. Podiatrists are required to have a DPM, whereas chiropodists need only have a post-secondary diploma in chiropody. Podiatrists, unlike chiropodists, may bill OHIP, &quot;communicate a diagnosis&quot; to their patients, and perform surgical procedures on the bones of the forefoot. Registered podiatrists who relocate to Ontario are required to register with the province and practice as a chiropodist. Ontario legislation in 1991 imposed a cap on Ontario-trained chiropodists becoming podiatrists, while grandfathering in already-practising podiatrists.

===Iran===
There are no podiatric medical schools in Iran. The Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MoHME) reviews the dossier of podiatric applicants for medical registration according to the &quot;Regulations on the Evaluation of the Educational Credentials of Foreign Graduates&quot;.

Applicants with podiatric degrees from the United States qualify for registration in Iran if they meet the following criteria:

* possession of a bachelor&#x27;s degree
* passing score on the MCAT
* completion of the podiatric curriculum of an accredited school, thereby obtaining the degree of Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM)
* completion of a one-year postgraduate training (if required by the home jurisdiction)
* passing score on relevant board examinations

===New Zealand===
New Zealand established Chiropody (shortly thereafter renamed to Podiatry) as a registered profession in 1969, requiring all applicants to take a recognized three-year course of training. The New Zealand School of Podiatry was established at Petone in 1970, under the direction of John Gallocher. Later, the school moved to the Central Institute of Technology, Upper Hutt, Wellington. Today, Auckland University of Technology is the only provider of podiatry training in New Zealand.

In 1976, podiatrists in New Zealand gained the legal right to use a local anaesthetic, and began to include minor surgical procedures on ingrown toenails in their scope of practice. They received the right to refer patients to radiologists for X-rays in 1984, and (with suitable training) to acquire licensing to take their own X-rays in 1989. Diagnostic radiographic training is now incorporated into the podiatric degree syllabus, and on successful completion of the course, graduates register with the New Zealand National Radiation Laboratory.

===United Kingdom===
The scope of practice of podiatrists in the UK varies depending on their education and training, but may include simple skin care, the use of prescription-only medicines, injection therapy, and non-invasive surgery such as nail resection and removal. Podiatrists also interface between patients and multidisciplinary teams, recognising systemic disease as it manifests in the foot and referring on to the appropriate health care professionals.

To qualify as a podiatric surgeon, a podiatrist in the UK must undertake extensive postgraduate education and training, usually taking a minimum of 10 years to complete. Appropriately qualified podiatric surgeons may perform invasive bone and joint surgery.

Legislation in the UK protects the professional titles &#x27;chiropodist&#x27; and &#x27;podiatrist&#x27;, but does not distinguish between the two. Those using protected titles must be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). Registration is normally only granted to those holding a bachelor&#x27;s degree from one of 13 recognized schools of podiatry in the UK. Professional bodies recognised by the HCPC are:
* The Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists
* The Alliance of Private Sector Practitioners 
* The Institute of Chiropodists and Podiatrists 
* The British Chiropody and Podiatry Association

In 1979, the Royal Commission on the National Health Service reported that about six and a half million NHS chiropody treatments were provided to just over one and a half million people in Great Britain in 1977, an increase of 19% over the number from three years before. Over 90% of patients receiving these treatments were aged 65 or over. At that time there were about 5,000 state registered chiropodists, but only about two-thirds worked for the NHS. The Commission agreed with the suggestion of the Association of Chief Chiropody Officers that more foot hygienists should be introduced, who could undertake, under the direction of a registered chiropodist, &quot;nail cutting and such simple foot-care and hygiene as a fit person should normally carry out for himself.&quot;

===United States===
In the United States, medical and surgical care of the foot and ankle is mainly provided by two groups: podiatrists (with a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine degree) and orthopedic surgeons (with a Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree). In most states, their scope of practice is limited to the foot and ankle; however, some states include the leg, hand, or both.

In order to be considered for admission to podiatric medical school, an applicant must first complete a minimum of 90 semester hours at the university level, or (more commonly), complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree with an appropriate emphasis. In addition, potential students are required to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). In 2019, the average MCAT for matriculants was 500 and 3.5 average undergraduate cGPA.

The DPM degree itself takes a minimum of four years to complete. The first two years of podiatric medical school are similar to training that M.D. and D.O. students receive, but with greater emphasis on the foot and ankle.

The four-year podiatric medical school is followed by a surgical residency to provide hands-on training. As of July 2013, all residency programs in podiatry were required to transition to a minimum of three years of post-doctoral training. This upgrading of training was spearheaded in California by the state Board of Podiatric Medicine (BPM) and its California Liaison Committee (CLC). BPM’s Executive Officer James H. Rathlesberger included it in the Federation of Podiatric Medical Boards’ Model Law, which he wrote before becoming FPMB president in 2000.

Podiatric residents rotate through core areas of medicine and surgery. They work in such rotations as emergency medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, behavioral medicine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, vascular surgery, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, dermatology, and podiatric surgery and medicine. Fellowship training is available after residency in such fields such as geriatrics, foot and ankle traumatology, and infectious disease.


Upon completion of their residency, podiatrist candidates are eligible to sit for examinations for certification by one of two specialty boards accredited by the Council on Podiatric Medical Education (CPME), which itself is overseen and approved by the Department of Education. These are the American Board of Podiatric Medicine (ABPM) and the American Board of Foot and Ankle Surgery (ABFAS).

ABPM certification leads to fellowship in either the American Society of Podiatric Surgeons (ASPS) or the American College of Podiatric Medicine (ACPM). ABFAS certification leads to fellowship in the ASPS or the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons (ACFAS). ABPM is recognized by CPME as certification in primary podiatric medicine and orthopaedics and the ABFAS as certification in podiatric surgery. However, hospital credentialing committees often do not distinguish between the two.

There are two surgical certifications under ABFAS: foot surgery, and reconstructive rearfoot/ankle (RRA) surgery. In order to be board-certified in RRA, the sitting candidate has to have already achieved board certification in foot surgery. To receive ABFAS certification, the candidate must pass the written examination, submit surgical logs indicating experience and variety, pass an oral examination, and complete a computer-based clinical simulation.

====Practice characteristics====
Podiatric physicians practice in a variety of different settings. Some practice solo in a private practice setting; some belong to larger group practices. There are podiatrists in larger multi-specialty practices as well (such as orthopedic groups or groups for the treatment of diabetes) or clinic practices (such as the Indian Health Service (IHS), the Rural Health Centers (RHC), or the Community Health Center (FQHC)). Some work for government organizations, such as for Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics. 

Some podiatrists have primarily surgical practices. They may complete additional fellowship training in reconstruction of the foot and ankle from the effects of diabetes or physical trauma, or practice minimally invasive percutaneous surgery for cosmetic correction of hammer toes and bunions.

====Colleges and education====
There are 11 schools of podiatric medicine in the United States. These are governed by the American Association of Colleges of Podiatric Medicine (AACPM) and accredited by the Council on Podiatric Medical Education.

* Arizona School of Podiatric Medicine at Midwestern University
* Barry University School of Podiatric Medicine
* California School of Podiatric Medicine
* Des Moines University College of Podiatric Medicine and Surgery
* New York College of Podiatric Medicine
* Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine
* Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine School of Podiatric Medicine
* Dr. William M. Scholl College of Podiatric Medicine at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science
* Temple University School of Podiatric Medicine
* University of Texas Rio Grande Valley School of Podiatric Medicine 
* College of Podiatric Medicine at Western University of Health Sciences

==Podiatric subspecialties==

Podiatrists treat a wide variety of foot and lower-extremity conditions through both nonsurgical and surgical approaches. While the terminology of subspecialties differ around the world, they generally fall into these categories:

* Reconstructive foot and ankle surgery
* Podiatric sports medicine (chronic overuse injuries and mechanical performance enhancement)
* Podiatric dermatology
* Lower extremity plastic and reconstructive surgery, limb salvage, and wound care
* Podopediatrics (podiatry in children)
* Forensic podiatry (the study of footprints, footwear, shoeprints and feet associated with crime scene investigations)

Podiatric assistants work as a part of a podiatric medical team in a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings. Worldwide, there are common professional accreditation pathways to be a podiatric assistant; for instance, in Australia, the qualification is a Certificate IV in Allied Health Assistance specialising in podiatry. Podiatric assistants may specialize in many different fields, such as:

* Podiatric nurse
* Podiatric surgical nurse
* Foot carer
* Podiatric support worker
* Podiatric technician
* Podiatric hygienist
* Foot hygienist
* Podiatric medical assistant

<text>Tuggerah Lake, an intermittently open intermediate wave dominated barrier estuary that is part of the Tuggerah Lakes, is located within the local government area in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia. The lake is located near Wyong and is situated about north of Sydney.

==Features and location==
Drawing its catchment from the Wyong River, Ourimbah Creek and Tumbi Creek, at the southern half of Tuggerah Lake, the lake is generally quite shallow with an average depth of . It is connected with the Tasman Sea through a tidal channel at its southern end known as The Entrance. It is also connected with two smaller lakes, Budgewoi Lake and through that to Lake Munmorah. Tuggerah Lake has a catchment area of and a surface area of . When full, Tuggerah Lake covers an area of around .
Heavy rains in June 2007 caused Tuggerah Lake to flood, affecting areas of Long Jetty, Killarney Vale and Chittaway Point. On the sea side of the peninsula is Norah Head and its historic lighthouse.

===Urban areas===
The lake adjoins extensive areas of suburban development. Much of the original settlement bordering the lake was oriented towards domestic tourism; with Sydney residents drawn to the area and staying in camp and early cabin-style accommodation clustered around towns of The Entrance and Long Jetty, from there spreading to Toukley on the northern lakeshore.

Many towns surround the lake including Lake Munmorah, The Entrance, Killarney Vale, Berkeley Vale, Tumbi Umbi, Wyong, Kanwal, Gorokan and Toukley.
South of The Entrance is Long Jetty, so named for the jetty built to service the first sub-division of land at The Entrance. The original jetty was washed away in a flood at Easter 1927; the present structure replaced it, built in 1927–28 to a length of . Parts of the jetty have fallen into disrepair and it requires frequent periodic repairs and replacement of its structure and decking.

===Fishing and boating===
Tuggerah Lake is well known for its recreational fishing with species such as luderick, bream, flathead and whiting caught from the shoreline and boats. Prawns can be plentiful over the summer months during the dark of the new moon. Fishing in Tuggerah Lake is generally poor during late winter and early spring, particularly when westerly winds are prevalent.

Special purpose markers (coloured yellow) around Terilbah Island and Pelican Island denote areas where net and trap fishing are restricted. Other parts of the lake may have permanent or temporary fishing restrictions in force.

Due to its large size and shallow depth strong winds can whip up a steep choppy surface that can be hazardous to small boats, however Tuggerah Lake is considered quite safe for most forms of small recreational watercraft if common sense and general safe boating practices are followed. Many parts of Tuggerah Lake are quite shallow with sand or weed flats exposed at low water. Marked channels should be navigated with care and at reduced speed. Mobile phone coverage is available across the entire lake.

==Environment==

Substantial residential and commercial development, involving excavation and alteration of native vegetation and natural watercourses in the lake catchment and hinterland, has given rise to siltation and changes in the make up of the lakebed and foreshore. During 2004 and 2005 the Tuggerah Lakes Restoration project has been attempting to restore and revive the lake system. Urbanisation and development have caused increased nutrients to build up in the lake stimulating weed growth. Restoration work has focussed on inshore removal of weed and ooze; foreshore reclamation and reinstatement; pollutant traps; and channel dredging to increase the tidal exchange of water with the sea.

Wyrrabalong National Park borders the lake and the sea separating the residential areas of Toukley and The Entrance, and preserves the last significant littoral rainforest on the Central Coast. The lake is part of the Tuggerah Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for a variety of water and woodland birds.
