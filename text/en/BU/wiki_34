<text>Proteus vulgaris is a rod-shaped, nitrate-reducing, indole-positive and catalase-positive, hydrogen sulfide-producing, Gram-negative bacterium that inhabits the intestinal tracts of humans and animals. It can be found in soil, water, and fecal matter. It is grouped with the Morganellaceae and is an opportunistic pathogen of humans. It is known to cause wound infections and other species of its genera are known to cause urinary tract infections.

&quot;P. vulgaris&quot; was one of the three species Hauser isolated from putrefied meat and identified (1885).

Over the past two decades, the genus &quot;Proteus&quot;, and in particular &quot;P. vulgaris&quot;, has undergone a number of major taxonomic revisions. In 1982, &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; was separated into three biogroups on the basis of indole production. Biogroup one was indole negative and represented a new species, &quot;P. penneri&quot;, while biogroups two and three remained together as &quot;P. vulgaris&quot;.

== Lab identification ==

According to laboratory fermentation tests, &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; ferments glucose and amygdalin, but does not ferment mannitol or lactose. &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; also tests positive for the methyl red (mixed acid fermentation) test and is also an extremely motile organism.

When &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; is tested using the API 20E identification system it produces positive results for sulfur reduction, urease production, tryptophan deaminase production, indole production, sometimes positive gelatinase activity, and saccharose fermentation, and negative results for the remainder of the tests on the testing strip.

It is referenced in the Analytical Profile Index using the nine-digit code: 047602157.

The optimal growing conditions of this organism is in a facultative anaerobic environment with an average temperature of about 40 °C.

The Becton/Dickinson BBL Enterotube II system for identification of members of the order Enterobacterales inoculated with &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; may yield the following results:
*Positive for glucose fermentation (with gas production) 
*Negative for lysine and ornithine 
*Positive for hydrogen sulfide production and indole production 
*Negative for lactose, arabinose, adonitol, sorbitol and dulcitol
*Positive for the phenylalanine test and the Harnstoff urea test 
&quot;P. vulgaris&quot; can test positive or negative for citrate. All combine for a Biocode ID of 31406, (Biocode ID 31402, 31404, 31407 all resulting in &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; with asymptomatic results) for use in the Interpretation Guide/Computer Coding and Identification System. &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; can also test urease negative in solid media (such as in Enterotube), but will be urease positive in liquid media. The CCIS code will still identify it with a negative urease test. When inoculated in a gelatin stab test, &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; is capable of hydrolysis of gelatin.

== &quot;Proteus&quot; infections ==

=== Cause and epidemiology ===
*Nosocomial infections
*&quot;P. mirabilis&quot; causes 90% of &quot;Proteus&quot; infections. 
*A surveillance study conducted between 2000 - 2005 found that women (69%) are at a higher risk for developing &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; infections.
*&quot;P. vulgaris&quot; and &quot;P. penneri&quot; are easily isolated from individuals in long-term care facilities and hospitals and from patients with underlying diseases or compromised immune systems.
*Patients with recurrent infections, those with structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, those who have had urethral instrumentation, and those whose infections were acquired in the hospital have an increased frequency of infection caused by &quot;Proteus&quot; and other organisms (e.g., &quot;Klebsiella&quot;, &quot;Enterobacter&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, enterococci, and staphylococci).
*P. vulgaris is highly resistant to antibiotics because of the plasmids present in the bacterium, making infections extremely difficult to cure. This is because the plasmids have varied drug resistant markers on them.

=== Clinical expression ===
Enterobacterales (of which &quot;Proteus &quot;is a member) and &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species are the micro-organisms most commonly responsible for Gram-negative bacteremia and sepsis.

The presence of the sepsis syndrome associated with a urinary tract infection (UTI) should raise the possibility of urinary tract obstruction. This is especially true of patients who reside in long-term care facilities, who have long-term indwelling urethral catheters, or who have a known history of urethral anatomic abnormalities.

;UTI obstruction
Urease production leads to precipitation of organic and inorganic compounds, which leads to struvite stone formation. Struvite stones are composed of a combination of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium carbonate-apatite. Struvite stone formation can be sustained only when ammonia production is increased and the urine pH is elevated to decrease the solubility of phosphate. Both of these requirements can occur only when urine is infected with a urease-producing organism such as &quot;Proteus&quot;. Urease metabolizes urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide: urea 2 NH3 + CO2. The ammonia/ammonium buffer pair has a pK of 9.0, resulting in the combination of highly alkaline, ammonia-rich urine.

Symptoms attributable to struvite stones are uncommon. More often, women present with UTI, flank pain, or hematuria, and are found to have a persistently alkaline urine pH (&gt;7.0).

== Treatments ==
Antibiotics to which &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; is known to be sensitive:

*Ciprofloxacin
*Ceftazidime
*Netilmicin
*Sulbactam or cefoperazone
*Meropenem
*Piperacillin/tazobactam
*Ampicillin/sulbactam

<doc id="594550" wikidata="Q514436" url="?curid=594550" title="List of Solar System objects by size">
<text>This article includes a list of the most massive known objects of the Solar System and partial lists of smaller objects by observed mean radius. These lists can be sorted according to an object&#x27;s radius and mass and, for the most massive objects, volume, density, and surface gravity, if these values are available.

These lists contain the Sun, the planets, dwarf planets, many of the larger small Solar System bodies (which includes the asteroids), all named natural satellites, and a number of smaller objects of historical or scientific interest, such as comets and near-Earth objects.

Many trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) have been discovered; in many cases their positions in this list are approximate, as there is frequently a large uncertainty in their estimated diameters due to their distance from Earth.

Solar System objects more massive than 1021 kilograms are known or expected to be approximately spherical. Astronomical bodies relax into rounded shapes (spheroids), achieving hydrostatic equilibrium, when their own gravity is sufficient to overcome the structural strength of their material. It was believed that the cutoff for round objects is somewhere between 100 km and 200 km in radius if they have a large amount of ice in their makeup; however, later studies revealed that icy satellites as large as Iapetus (1,470 kilometers in diameter) are not in hydrostatic equilibrium at this time, and a 2019 assessment suggests that many TNOs in the size range of 400–1,000 kilometers may not even be fully solid bodies, much less gravitationally rounded. Objects that are ellipsoids due to their own gravity are here generally referred to as being &quot;round&quot;, whether or not they are actually in equilibrium today, while objects that are clearly not ellipsoidal are referred to as being &quot;irregular.&quot;

Spheroidal bodies typically have some polar flattening due to the centrifugal force from their rotation, and can sometimes even have quite different equatorial diameters (scalene ellipsoids such as ). Unlike bodies such as Haumea, the irregular bodies have a significantly non-ellipsoidal profile, often with sharp edges.

There can be difficulty in determining the diameter (within a factor of about 2) for typical objects beyond Saturn. (See 2060 Chiron as an example) For TNOs there is some confidence in the diameters, but for non-binary TNOs there is no real confidence in the masses/densities. Many TNOs are often just assumed to have Pluto&#x27;s density of 2.0 g/cm3, but it is just as likely that they have a comet-like density of only 0.5 g/cm3.

For example, if a TNO is incorrectly assumed to have a mass of 3.59 kg based on a radius of 350 km with a density of 2 g/cm3 but is later discovered to have a radius of only 175 km with a density of 0.5 g/cm3, its true mass would be only 1.12 kg.

The sizes and masses of many of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn are fairly well known due to numerous observations and interactions of the &quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiters; however, many of the moons with a radius less than ~100 km, such as Jupiter&#x27;s Himalia, have far less certain masses. Further out from Saturn, the sizes and masses of objects are less clear. There has not yet been an orbiter around Uranus or Neptune for long-term study of their moons. For the small outer irregular moons of Uranus, such as Sycorax, which were not discovered by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flyby, even different NASA web pages, such as the National Space Science Data Center and JPL Solar System Dynamics, give somewhat contradictory size and albedo estimates depending on which research paper is being cited.

There are uncertainties in the figures for mass and radius, and irregularities in the shape and density, with accuracy often depending on how close the object is to Earth or whether it has been visited by a probe.

== Graphical overview ==

==Objects with radii over 400 km==

The following objects have a nominal mean radius of 400 km or greater. It was once expected that any icy body larger than approximately 200 km in radius was likely to be in hydrostatic equilibrium (HE). However, (r = 470 km) is the smallest body for which detailed measurements are consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium, whereas Iapetus (r = 735 km) is the largest icy body that has been found to not be in hydrostatic equilibrium. The known icy moons in this range are all ellipsoidal (except Proteus), but trans-Neptunian objects up to 450–500 km radius may be quite porous.

For simplicity and comparative purposes, the values are manually calculated assuming that the bodies are all spheres. The size of solid bodies does not include an object&#x27;s atmosphere. For example, Titan looks bigger than Ganymede, but its solid body is smaller. For the giant planets, the &quot;radius&quot; is defined as the distance from the center at which the atmosphere reaches 1 bar of atmospheric pressure.

Because Sedna and 2002 MS4 have no known moons, directly determining their mass is impossible without sending a probe (estimated to be from 1.7x1021 to 6.1×1021 kg for Sedna).

== Smaller objects by mean radius ==
=== From 200 to 399 km ===
All imaged icy moons with radii greater than 200 km except Proteus are clearly round, although those under 400 km that have had their shapes carefully measured are not in hydrostatic equilibrium. The known densities of TNOs in this size range are remarkably low (), implying that the objects retain significant internal porosity from their formation and were never gravitationally compressed into fully solid bodies.

=== From 100 to 199 km ===
This list contains a selection of objects estimated to be between 100 and 199 km in radius (200 and 399 km in diameter). The largest of these may have a hydrostatic-equilibrium shape, but most are irregular. Most of the trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) listed with a radius smaller than 200 km have &quot;&quot;assumed sizes&quot; based on a &quot;generic&quot; albedo of 0.09&quot; since they are too far away to directly measure their sizes with existing instruments. Mass switches from 1021 kg to 1018 kg (Zg). Main-belt asteroids have orbital elements constrained by (2.0 AU &lt; a &lt; 3.2 AU; q &gt; 1.666 AU) according to JPL Solar System Dynamics (JPLSSD). Many TNOs are omitted from this list as their sizes are poorly known.
=== From 50 to 99 km ===
This list contains a selection of objects 50 and 99 km in radius (100 km to 199 km in average diameter). The listed objects currently include most objects in the asteroid belt and moons of the giant planets in this size range, but many newly discovered objects in the outer Solar System are missing, such as those included in the following reference. Asteroid spectral types are mostly Tholen, but some might be SMASS.
=== From 20 to 49 km ===
This list includes few examples since there are about 589 asteroids in the asteroid belt with a measured radius between 20 and 49 km. Many thousands of objects of this size range have yet to be discovered in the trans-Neptunian region. The number of digits is not an endorsement of significant figures. The table switches from  kg to  kg (Eg). Most mass values of asteroids are assumed.
=== From 1 to 19 km ===
This list contains some examples of Solar System objects between 1 and 19 km in radius. This is a common size for asteroids, comets and irregular moons.
=== Below 1 km ===

This list contains examples of objects below 1 km in radius. That means that irregular bodies can have a longer chord in some directions, hence the mean radius averages out.
In the asteroid belt alone there are estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.9 million objects with a radius &quot;above&quot; 0.5 km, many of which are in the range 0.5–1.0 km. Countless more have a radius &quot;below&quot; 0.5 km.
Very few objects in this size range have been explored or even imaged. The exceptions are objects that have been visited by a probe, or have passed close enough to Earth to be imaged. Radius is by mean geometric radius. Number of digits not an endorsement of significant figures. Mass scale shifts from × 1015 to 109 kg, which is equivalent to one billion kg or 1012 grams (Teragram – Tg).
Currently most of the objects of mass between 109 kg to 1012 kg (less than 1000 teragrams (Tg)) listed here are near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). The Aten asteroid has less mass than the Great Pyramid of Giza, 5.9 × 109 kg.

<doc id="594554" wikidata="Q499867" url="?curid=594554" title="Visselhövede">
<text>Visselhövede () is a town in the district of Rotenburg in Lower Saxony, Germany. Nearby towns include the district capital Rotenburg, Walsrode and Verden. Larger cities within a 100 km radius are Bremen, Hanover and Hamburg. On 30 April 2024 Visselhövede had 10.116 inhabitants.

Visselhövede belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Verden, established in 1180. In 1648 the Prince-Bishopric was transformed into the Principality of Verden, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown - interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712–1715) - and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. The Kingdom of Hanover incorporated the Principality in a real union and the Princely territory, including Visselhövede, became part of the new Stade Region, established in 1823.

==Sights==
The most famous building is St. Johannis-Kirche, a protestant church named after John the Baptist. It was built of bricks in a gothic style and consecrated in 1358. The wooden clock tower measuring 23 metres in height was built in 1799. The church houses various masterpieces of art, e.g. a baroque altar dating from 1771 and a baroque organ from 1779, a baptismal font and wall paintings from the Middle Ages and a pulprit dating from 1641. The source of river Vissel can be visited in a small park behind the church. The Town Hall in the Market Place was built around 1796. In Burgstrasse, the oldest street in town, the &quot;Heimathaus&quot;, a half-timbered house which was renovated in 1999, is worth a visit. It is the cultural centre of Visselhövede.

&quot;Bürgerpark Visselseen&quot; is a public park with four lakes where two historical store houses, which had been dismantled at the former site, were reconstructed in 2006.

<text>Jack of All Trades is a half-hour-long syndicated action comedy TV series which ran for two seasons in 2000. With &quot;Cleopatra 2525&quot;, it formed the &quot;Back2Back Action Hour&quot; and both shows were notable for being the first American non-animated action series to be produced in the half-hour format since the 1970s. The show was canceled in the middle of its second season.

==Plot==
It is set at the turn of the 19th century (beginning in 1801) on the fictional French-controlled island of Pulau-Pulau in the East Indies. Jack Stiles is an American secret agent sent there by President Jefferson. While there, he meets his British contact and love interest, English spy Emilia Rothschild. Together, the two work to stop Napoleon and various other threats to the United States. To the public, Jack is seen as Emilia&#x27;s attaché (she sometimes serves as his), and in order to protect his identity as a secret agent, while acting against the enemies of America, Jack often adopts the identity of a legendary (though otherwise fictional) masked hero: &quot;the Daring Dragoon&quot;.

The show contained many ongoing gags, such as historical inaccuracies (such as Canada being a French territory rather than part of the British Empire, and Benjamin Franklin being on the 100 dollar bill during his lifetime), Jack being responsible for many important historical events but not receiving credit, Emilia inventing a miraculous invention in an obvious deus ex machina, sexual puns and innuendos, and Jack and Emilia&#x27;s ongoing romantic tension.

==Cast==
*Bruce Campbell as Jack Stiles
*Angela Dotchin as Emilia Rothschild
*Stuart Devenie as Governor Croque
*Stephen Papps as Captain Brogard
*Sheb Wooley as the voice of Jean-Claude
*Verne Troyer as Napoleon Bonaparte (recurring guest – 4 episodes)

==Production==
===Theme song===
The tune and lyrics are based on numerous period songs, such as the &quot;Marines&#x27; Hymn&quot; and &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;. The theme song was nominated for the &quot;Outstanding Main Theme Title Song&quot; Emmy in 2000, but lost to &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

===Historical figures===
Many episodes of &quot;Jack of All Trades&quot; involved parodies of historical figures. Furthering the show&#x27;s inaccuracies, some of these figures died before the show&#x27;s 1801 time period.

The following is a list of historical figures who appeared on the show:

* Thomas Jefferson (Charles Pierard) 2 episodes
* Blackbeard (Hori Ahipene) 2 episodes
* Benjamin Franklin (John Sumner)
* James Madison (Patrick Smith)
* Napoleon and Josephine Bonaparte (Verne Troyer 4 episodes and Celia Nicholson 1 episode)
* Marquis de Sade (Stuart Devenie)
* Meriwether Lewis and William Clark (Patrick Wilson and Peter Rowley)
* Sacagawea (Vanessa Rare)
* King George III (Mark Hadlow)
* Catherine the Great (Danielle Cormack)
* Leonardo da Vinci is parodied by his fictitious descendant Nardo da Vinci (Michael Hurst).

<text>gentoo is a free file manager for Linux and other Unix-like computer systems created by Emil Brink. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License.

gentoo is written in C using the GTK+ toolkit and the &quot;two-pane&quot; concept. Notable features of gentoo include its graphical configurability, file typing and styling system. gentoo&#x27;s file typing system identifies the file type and then uses the respective style defined to determine its display in listings. It is reminiscent of Total Commander or Norton Commander. The author mentions that &quot;gentoo tries to capture the features, the look and feel of the legendary file manager from Amiga platform: Directory Opus.&quot; 

The package includes approximately 100 handcrafted icons for different file types. Additionally, many users like it for its speed, as it is relatively lightweight (see below). 

==Name==
The word &quot;gentoo&quot; refers to a fast breed of penguin, the gentoo penguin. In spite of the name, it has nothing to do with the Gentoo Linux distribution, and did in fact adopt the name first.

<doc id="594573" wikidata="Q433891" url="?curid=594573" title="Ike Skelton">
<text>Isaac Newton Skelton IV (December 20, 1931 – October 28, 2013) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the U.S. representative for from 1977 to 2011. During his tenure, he served as the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. He was a member of the Democratic Party. On November 2, 2010, he unexpectedly lost his seat to Republican Vicky Hartzler amid a Republican landslide. Notably, he was one of three Democratic committee chairmen to lose reelection in the 2010 midterm cycle, alongside House Budget Committee chairman John Spratt of South Carolina and House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairman Jim Oberstar of Minnesota. 

==Early life and education==
Skelton was born in Lexington, Missouri, a rural town with extensive Civil War history. He was the son of Carolyn Marie (Boone) and Isaac Newton Skelton III.

In 1928, Skelton&#x27;s father met Harry S. Truman, then a Jackson County judge, and the men became good friends. When he was 17, Skelton attended Truman&#x27;s 1949 inauguration.

Skelton was an Eagle Scout. He earned an associate of arts degree from Wentworth Military Academy and College in 1951, followed by an A.B. in 1953 and an LL.B. in 1956 from the University of Missouri. He is a brother of Sigma Chi and Alpha Phi Omega at the University of Missouri. He also attended the University of Edinburgh in Scotland in 1953.

== Career ==
Skelton became a lawyer and entered private practice in Lafayette County, Missouri. He was a prosecuting attorney from 1957 until 1960 and a special assistant attorney general in the office of the Missouri Attorney General.

Skelton served as a member of the Missouri Senate, representing Lafayette County, from 1971 until 1977.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Armed Services (Chairman)
As chairman of the full committee, Skelton served as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees.

Skelton served as chair of the House Armed Services Committee, having previously served as ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee since 1998 but was promoted to chairman following the 2006 midterm elections when Democrats regained control of Congress.

==Political positions==
Skelton voted with Democratic leadership 94.6% of the time during the 111th Congress, meaning he broke with his party more frequently than 82% of the Democratic Caucus. Vicky Hartzler, Skelton&#x27;s 2010 Congressional opponent, stated on the campaign trail that Skelton has voted in line with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 95% of the time during his tenure in the House.

Before the 2006 election, Skelton told columnist George Will that if the Democrats won control of Congress, his main priority would be &quot;oversight, oversight, oversight!&quot; While he voted for the War in Iraq, he expressed serious misgivings about troop readiness. In 2006, he favored reducing the number of troops in Iraq and supported redeploying a brigade from Iraq to Kuwait. Will suggested that under Skelton, the Armed Services Committee would resemble a U.S. Senate committee created to examine defense spending during World War II. This committee was chaired by Skelton&#x27;s hero, Harry S. Truman.

===Fiscal issues===
Skelton voted against the 2001 Bush Tax cuts. In 1981, he voted against Reagan&#x27;s tax cuts. He was supportive of labor. The League of Conservation Voters rated Skelton at 53 percent on environmental issues. He was one of the few Congressional Democrats to vote in favor of CAFTA and mostly supported free trade deals. He was a supporter of TRiO programs.

===Social issues===
Skelton was fairly conservative on social issues. He opposed abortion and gun control. He helped craft the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell policy, and voted against its repeal in 2010.

===Military issues===
Skelton was a long-time proponent of the Missouri National Guard, in recognition for which the National Guard Training Center in Jefferson City is named in his honor. However, at times he has disagreed with other members of Missouri&#x27;s congressional delegation over the state&#x27;s defense installations. In 2005, for instance, he opposed Senator Kit Bond&#x27;s efforts to keep open the 131st Air National Guard Fighter Wing in St. Louis County.

The wing was considered an &quot;alert site&quot; by the Defense Department, responsible for maintaining sovereignty over United States air space. In its final report, the 9/11 Commission found that the lack of alert sites, and with their positions primarily on the nation&#x27;s periphery, reduced the capability of the military to respond effectively to the 9/11 attacks. Senator Bond testified in the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) hearings against the closure of the 131st, which was based at Lambert International Airport. He noted that this wing, which was located in a strategically important location, had protected critical assets on 09-11-01. He warned that the loss of the wing would compromise security over a vast area of the Midwestern United States. Representative Skelton, as the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, voted in favor of closure. The House passed the BRAC recommendations, and the base was subsequently closed, with its components deployed elsewhere.

==Controversy==
On October 8, 2009, Skelton, after addressing fellow Missouri Congressman Todd Akin, a Republican, on the House floor, said to Akin, &quot;stick it up your ass.&quot; The comment was picked up by the microphone and could be heard on the C-SPAN broadcast. Skelton&#x27;s spokeswoman, Jennifer Kohl, said the comment was not intended to be broadcast and was &quot;said out of frustration in the heat of debate.&quot; Akin&#x27;s spokesman, Steve Taylor, said the remark was &quot;shocking and not characteristic of Skelton&#x27;s behavior.&quot;

==Political campaigns==
When William J. Randall retired after 17 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, Skelton won the Democratic nomination to succeed him with 40% of the vote in a crowded primary field of nine Democratic candidates. He ran with the endorsement of Truman&#x27;s widow, Bess, which he attributes to his own father&#x27;s support for Harry S. Truman in the 1940 U.S. Senate primary. He was reelected 16 times, usually by well over 60 percent of the vote. Before 2010, he only faced one truly serious challenge, in 1982. That year, Missouri lost a district, and Skelton&#x27;s district was merged with the neighboring 8th District, represented by freshman Republican Wendell Bailey. Although Skelton retained almost 60 percent of his former territory, Bailey held him to 55 percent of the vote.

===2010===

Skelton seemed to have a fairly secure hold on his district, even though it had been trending Republican for some time. Historically, it had had a character similar to Yellow Dog Democrat districts in the South. However, the rural areas of the district, once solidly Democratic, had swung hard to the GOP since the turn of the century. Indeed, in 2000, Republicans captured most of the area&#x27;s legislative seats and have held them ever since. Even before then, the district had been shedding more of the strongly Democratic areas near Kansas City due to that city&#x27;s dwindling population. As late as 1983, during Skelton&#x27;s third term, the 4th stretched as far west as Independence on Kansas City&#x27;s eastern border. As a result, it had been pushed further into heavily Republican Southwest Missouri. Al Gore, John Kerry and Barack Obama all won less than 40 percent of the vote in the district even as Skelton skated to reelection. It was considered very likely that Skelton would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired.

In 2010, Skelton faced former Republican state Representative Vicky Hartzler of Harrisonville, who had been out of politics for more than a decade. Polls consistently showed a very competitive race, easily the most competitive the district had seen in decades. Many pundits rated it as a toss-up.

It was still a surprise when Skelton lost to Hartzler, 50% to 45%. While Skelton ran evenly with Hartzler in the areas closer to Kansas City, he lost badly in the rural areas, including some that had supported him for many years. No Democrat has managed as much as 40 percent of the vote since Skelton left office.

==Awards and honors==
In 2005 the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation awarded Skelton its Naval Heritage award for his support of the U S Navy and military during his years in Congress. In 2010, Skelton was recognized by then, Commandant of the Marine Corps, General James F. Amos, as an Honorary Marine, the first U.S. congressman to be awarded the title. In 2012, the United States Military Academy recognized Skelton with the Sylvanus Thayer Award. In the same year, the USAF Air University presented Skelton with an honorary Doctor of Law degree for his work in the advancement of military education.

==Personal life==
His wife of 44 years, Susan Anding Skelton, died on August 23, 2005. Later that year, on November 26, Skelton was injured when a van carrying him and fellow U.S. Representatives Tim Murphy and Jim Marshall overturned near Baghdad Airport while on an official visit to Iraq. Skelton and Murphy were airlifted to a U.S. Military hospital in Germany after complaining of neck pain. Both made a full recovery.

On August 29, 2009, Skelton married Patty Martin, a longtime friend and widowed middle school counselor from his home town.

Skelton was a member of the Christian Church and an honorary chieftain in Scouting&#x27;s Tribe of Mic-O-Say. He was also of distant relation to Daniel Boone as well as to U.S. Representative Louise Slaughter of New York.

=== Death ===
Skelton died of pneumonia at Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington, Virginia on October 28, 2013, at the age of 81. According to Skelton&#x27;s colleague, Russell Orban, Skelton had been admitted to the hospital a week earlier with a bad cough.

Skelton&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Achieve the Honorable&quot;, had been published just two weeks before his death.

<text>Z scale is one of the smallest commercially available model railway scales (1:220), with a track gauge of . Introduced by Märklin in 1972, Z scale trains operate on 0–10 volts DC and offer the same operating characteristics as all other two-rail, direct-current, analog model railways. Locomotives can be fitted with digital decoders for independent control. Model trains, track, structures, and human/animal figures are readily available in European, North American, and Japanese styles from a variety of manufacturers.

== History ==
Z scale was introduced by the German model train manufacturer Märklin in 1972 at the Nuremberg Toy Fair. It was the brainchild of Helmut Killian, Märklin&#x27;s head design engineer at the time. The letter &quot;Z&quot; was chosen to designate the new scale, its place as the last character of the German and English alphabets signaling the thought that there would never be a smaller commercial model railway scale. While there have been attempts since then to bring even smaller scales to the market, they remain niche products without a wider followingthe largest market being T gauge (1:450, gauge), designed in Japan and manufactured in China.

Originally running on 8 V DC, track voltage was increased to 10 V DC around the year 2000. Accessory power has always been 10 V AC. 

In 1978, a Märklin Z scale locomotive pulling six coaches made its entry into the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; by running nonstop for 1,219 hours, and travelling a distance of before the motor failed and the train stopped.
Z scale, at its inception, was predominantly a European scale, but it has an increasing number of followers in other parts of the world. There are now also manufacturers in North America and Japan and China, among others. Z scale enthusiasts throughout Europe, North America, and Japan participate regularly at most national and regional model railroad exhibitions and shows, where they have demonstrated the outstanding operation and layout design characteristics of the scale. While prices were initially higher for Z scale products (particularly locomotives) compared with those available in larger scales, as volume production, computer-aided design and manufacturing techniques, and the number of competing manufacturers increased, prices have come down to a point comparable to those of high-quality models in other scales.

As early as 1988, Märklin announced their intention to offer digital train control systems in Z scale, and Märklin&#x27;s 1988 Z scale product catalog listed three locomotives with a built-in digital decoder. However, the technology was not developed enough, and the manufacturer had to cancel these plans, mainly due to heat dissipation problems in locomotive decoders. Since then, these problems have been solved, Z scale has embraced advanced electronics (e.g., microprocessors originally developed for cell phones, surface-mount technology, etc.), and an increasing number of modellers have converted their locomotives to use third party digital model train control systems.

The first attempts to use digital system in Z scale were based on NEM standard, Selectrix, which offered the smallest decoders in the market, with thicknesses of less than 2 mm. German company Müt brought also the first digital control central unit designed specially for Z scale in the market in the early 2000s. Use of the popular National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) Digital Command Control (DCC) standard has expanded substantially in Z scale recently as locomotive decoders with sizes comparable to the sizes of smallest Selectrix decoders have become available.

Z scale is now a mature modelling scale, with model locomotives, rolling stock, buildings, signalling and human and animal figures becoming available in increasing numbers from an expanding variety of established and particularly smaller, fast-growing manufacturers. Z scale layouts have been winning local, regional, and national level competitions, such as best of show at the NMRA National Train Show (NTS) in July 2001, in St. Louis, MO.

== Advantages ==
The diminutive size of Z scale makes it possible to fit more scale space into the same physical layout as would be used by larger-scale models. Z scale can also be beneficial when there is a need to build very compact train layouts, such as novelty setups in briefcases, guitar cases, or jewellery boxes. Several transportation museums, for instance, have used Z scale to present real world railway scenes. Z scale allows longer trains and broader, more realistic curves than is practical in larger scales.

== Drawbacks ==

Due to the small size of Z scale and, in particular, the low weight of the locomotives (a small Z scale engine can weigh as little as ), it can be challenging to ensure reliable operation. In particular, the track must be kept clean, as minuscule particles of dust, dirt, or corrosion can easily stop locomotives. Poorly-installed trackwork can be a source of consistent derailing of rolling stock (although this is true, to some extent, in any scale). All of this can create issues for modelers who are interested in prototypical operationsin particular, switching.

The low weight of Z scale locomotives contributes to their difficulty pulling trains up grades. In practice, the grade is kept under 2% for reliable operation of trains up to seven, four-axle cars; shorter trains can operate on grades up to 4%. Pulling power of locomotives can be increased by use of traction tires, or by adding weight using high-density materialtungsten powder (used in metal golf club driver heads) and lead are popular choices.

The smaller market for Z scale results in a limited range of available products, including both rolling stock and accessories; some of the demand is therefore met by cottage industries.

== Manufacturers ==

* The originator of Z scale, German manufacturer Märklin, still dominates the market for European prototype trains. Märklin couplers are unrealistic but can be easily coupled and uncoupled.

* Micro-Trains Line (MTL) of Talent, Oregon, has joined Märklin as a major Z scale manufacturer and supplier of Z scale model locomotives, rolling stock, structures, and complete set track systems specializing in North American prototypes. MTL uses Magnematic couplers that can be uncoupled magnetically and enable operations that mimic prototype railroad activities such as delivering or picking up empty or loaded rail cars, building trains in classification yards, etc. Other manufacturers use fixed couplers that cannot be manipulated in this way. 

There is a growing number of smaller manufacturers, both in Europe and in North America, of Z scale specialty items, such as detail parts, electronics, track-building aids, structures, scratch-building supplies, and tools in addition to rolling stock.

* In addition to custom Z scale rolling stock for European, Japanese, and North American modelers, the German company Freudenreich Feinwerktechnik (FR) has introduced a complete narrow-gauge Z scale system with gauge track, which corresponds with metre gauge in prototype and is designated as Zm scale following the NEM standard scale naming system.

* American Z Line (AZL) is a growing manufacturer producing a variety of highly detailed injection-molded North American prototype diesel locomotives and rolling stock as well as limited-run brass model steam and diesel locomotives. AZL has produced the largest variety of North American prototype locomotives and rolling stock available.

* Rokuhan, a Japanese company, produces Japanese prototype rolling stock as well as structures, accessories, and a complete line of track products with simulated wooden and concrete ties suitable for North American themed model railroads. 

* Azar Models, French manufacturer, produces French and European prototype rolling stock. 

* Atlas produces three foot (914mm) long Z scale flex track and number 6 switches with North American tie spacing (closer than European because North American rail cars are heavier). 

* Peco produces two foot (610mm) long Z scale flex track with European tie spacing.

<doc id="594582" wikidata="Q74050" url="?curid=594582" title="Roomba">
<text>A Roomba is an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner made by the company iRobot, and was first introduced in September 2002. Roombas have a set of sensors which help them navigate the floor area of a home. These sensors can detect the presence of obstacles and steep drops (e.g., to avoid falling down stairs).

As of 2024, iRobot markets models of their fourth through tenth generation, while continuing to provide support and to sell accessories for their previous series. Various models of the Roomba have different features, including tangle-free brushes, separate sweep canisters, more powerful vacuums, obstacle avoidance, and performance maps displayed via smartphone apps. Newer models also have a camera, which works in conjunction with onboard mapping and navigation software to systematically cover all floor areas, move from room to room, avoid obstacles such as pet waste and charging cables, and find recharging stations.

Roombas allow some modulation and reprogramming. Parts of some models are interchangeable, allowing owners to mix and match features or switch to other units for longer battery operation. Additionally, some units can be adapted to perform more creative tasks using an embedded computer in conjunction with the Roomba Open Interface.

In August 2022, Amazon announced its intention to purchase iRobot, though the acquisition was delayed by regulators in Europe for fear of hurting competition. As of January 2024, these plans were abandoned by Amazon.

== Development ==
Engineer Joe Jones first conceived the idea for what eventually became the Roomba in 1989 while working at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The initial design, using Lego, stemmed from a design challenge between Jones and his colleagues. Early prototypes were created and presented to the Denning Mobile Robot Company and Bissell in the 1990s, but neither company was interested in producing them. The concept languished until 1999, when S.C. Johnson eventually agreed to fund the project at iRobot. The device was initially called &quot;DustPuppy&quot; before being renamed to Roomba. Development began in full in December 1999. S.C. Johnson pulled out after spending US$1–2 million, but iRobot continued with the project, eventually launching the first Roomba in September 2002.

== Design ==
Roomba models are designed to be low enough to fit under beds or other furniture. Most Roomba models are disc-shaped, measuring in diameter and in height depending on the model. The S9 series robots are semicircular rather than circular, with a flat part at the front, and are narrower at wide. All models feature a large contact-sensing mechanical bumper on the front half, with a multi-directional infrared sensor located at the top front center. Most models also have a recessed handle located on the top.

The first and second-generation Roomba models utilized the Virtual Wall, a separately sold accessory that prevents it from entering an area. It projects a pattern of infrared light, which the vacuum detects and treats as a physical wall, prompting it to stop and turn around. However, third-generation and newer models have now been made compatible with the Dual Mode Virtual Wall, which, in addition to simulating a straight wall, can create a circular barrier roughly in diameter. Some 500, 700, and 800 series models are compatible with the Virtual Wall Lighthouse. It initially confines the vacuum to one area to be cleaned. Once the vacuum reports the area being sufficiently cleaned (based on its estimated area), it directs it to proceed to the next space to be cleaned and contains it there.

Roombas are driven by two independently operating side wheels, which can drive the Roomba forward and backward and change its trajectory. Rotary encoders on the wheels can detect the rate at which the wheels are spinning, determining if they are slipping or stuck. Drop sensors can detect if a wheel is too low, such as when it gets stuck in a vent. An undriven swivel caster is located at the front of most models and the back of the D-shaped S series. It is not used for steering, but it is used as an additional sensor. It has a rotary encoder as well. The caster&#x27;s wheel is half black and half white, and optical sensors detect the change in color as it rotates. This helps detect if the Roomba is stuck or beached (i.e., the drive wheels are spinning, but the Roomba is not moving).

The cleaning head (brushes and suction area) on Roombas is relatively small. On most models, it is between the two side wheels and is around wide; on the S series, it is moved to the flat square part of the D shape near the front, where it is wider, but still does not extend the full width of the vehicle. To compensate for this, Roombas have a rotating multi-pronged brush on one side that sweeps debris towards the path of the cleaning head, helping to clean a wider path and to reach into edges and corners.

A Roomba&#x27;s bumper allows it to sense when it has bumped into an obstacle, after which it will reverse or change paths. Infrared &quot;cliff sensors&quot; on the bottom of the unit similarly prevent them from falling off ledges such as stairs. These may also trigger a false positive on dark or black-colored surfaces, such as some carpets, preventing Roombas from entering or cleaning those areas. Third-generation and newer models have additional forward-looking infrared sensors to detect obstacles. These sensors slow down the Roomba&#x27;s speed when nearing obstacles to reduce its force of impact. It also cleans along walls without repeatedly bumping into them. This technology can also distinguish between hard and soft obstacles.

Most second- and third-generation models, as well as all newer ones, have internal acoustic-based dirt sensors that allow them to detect and focus on particularly dirty spots. Fourth-generation and newer models have an optical sensor located in front of the vacuum bin, allowing detection of wider and smaller messes.

Third-generation and newer models can reverse their brushes&#x27; rotation direction to escape entangled cords and tassels. If at any time the unit senses that it has become stuck, is unable to turn its main brushes, no longer senses the floor beneath it, or decides that it has worked its way into a narrow area from which it is unable to escape, it stops and sounds an error alert to help someone find it. Early models use only flashing lights or several beeps to indicate specific problems, while later models use a synthesized voice to announce a problem and a suggested solution. The voice is available in several languages. Models with app capabilities will also communicate the error to the app, which will notify the user via push notification.

Roombas are powered by a user-replaceable rechargeable battery; older models used NiMH batteries, while newer models use lithium-ion batteries, and a few models support both. First-generation models must be recharged from a wall power adapter and require the Roomba to be plugged in manually, while all subsequent models have a self-charging home base that the unit seeks out at the end of a cleaning session using infrared beacons. Charging takes about three hours. Battery reliability is a frequently mentioned complaint on customer review websites.

== Operation ==
=== Control and cleaning ===
All Roomba models can be operated by manually carrying the Roomba to the room to be cleaned and pressing a button. Third-generation and later models can also be started directly from their charging bases. Later models introduced several additional operating modes, such as &quot;Spot,&quot; which cleans an area of a few feet. Older Roombas had &quot;Max&quot; mode, which cleans endlessly until the battery is depleted; this was replaced by &quot;Clean&quot; on later models that had the ability to calculate room size. &quot;Dock&quot; mode, introduced with the third generation, instructs the Roomba to seek a charging base for recharging. The availability of the modes varies by model. Many second- and third-generation Roombas and certain newer models (such as the 880), come packaged with infrared remote controls or special control panels, allowing a human operator to &quot;drive&quot; the Roomba to areas to be specially cleaned.

Subsequent Roomba models can be controlled with the iRobot HOME app, where users can start and pause the Roomba, send it back to the charging base, choose time limits for it to run before returning home, and view details about each cleaning job, such as how long the Roomba ran for and how the job ended (i.e., being completed, canceled or the battery dying).The cleaning time depends on room size and, for models equipped with dirt sensors, the volume of dirt. First-generation models must be told the room size, while subsequent models either estimate the room size by measuring the longest straight-line run they can perform without bumping into an object, or by creating a map of the room.

Non-desktop users can use the iRobot HOME App, although only certain models support 2.4 GHz. Wi-Fi connected Roombas can also connect to Alexa, Google Home, and other smart home platforms for voice control or use in automation.

=== Pathing ===

Starting with the sixth generation, Roombas have an upward-facing camera and a downward-facing infrared floor-tracking sensor, which are used to create a map of the floor. This enables them to use a back-and-forth cleaning pattern, which is faster and more efficient because it ensures more complete coverage without needing to cover an area multiple times. The floor-tracking sensor operates like an optical mouse and can provide precise movement data over small distances. However, this causes integration drift and small errors in measurement that accumulate over time. To rectify this, the upward-facing camera is used periodically to identify waypoints or &quot;landmarks,&quot; coarse points that are used to correct the Roombas&#x27; position and map. Some algorithms, such as wall following, are still used, to partly assist in mapping the floor and to make sure the floor is cleaned along the edge and around obstacles. Unlike other mapping systems like lidar, which can operate in complete darkness, Roomba&#x27;s camera requires some light in the room in order to be able to map it. Starting with the seventh generation, Roombas retain the map after each run and use subsequent runs to improve the map. Multiple maps can be stored, and users can edit maps to separate and label regions (such as rooms). This can be used to have the Roomba clean only selected room(s). Most models come with one or more virtual wall barriers to help block off specified rooms.

Roombas before the sixth generation models do not map out the rooms they are cleaning. Instead, iRobot developed a technology called iAdapt Responsive Cleaning Technology. This relies on a few simple algorithms, such as spiraling, room crossing, wall following, and random walk angle changing after bumping into an object or wall. This design is based on MIT researcher and iRobot CTO Rodney Brooks&#x27; philosophy that robots should be like insects, equipped with simple control mechanisms tuned to their environments. The result is that, although Roombas are effective at cleaning rooms, they take several times longer to do the job than a human would. Some users have used long-exposure photography or compositing to create images showing Roombas&#x27; coverage of the floor, and have even attached light sources to Roombas to create art using light painting.

Some have also noted that doubts about the effectiveness of the random algorithms have been reinforced by multiple reports of Roombas rolling over dog feces and spreading them through the room, which rather unpleasantly illustrates how well the Roomba can cover the floor&#x27;s area. Roombas have become a common example of how randomized algorithms can routinely succeed even though they cannot absolutely guarantee success on any single run or even after many repeated runs. Compared to competing products available when Roombas were first introduced, such as the Electrolux Trilobite, the effectiveness of Roombas&#x27; random navigation was on par with (or even more effective than) robotic mapping technology available at the time, and cheaper to develop and produce, meaning it was sold at a significantly lower price.

When finished cleaning or when the battery is nearly depleted, Roombas (excluding first-generation models) will try to return to a base if one is detected. Roombas with mapping capability can recharge and resume a cleaning job, enabling them to clean large areas that take more than one full battery charge to complete. Roombas, except for first-generation models also support scheduling, allowing cleaning to start at a certain time and day of the week that the owner desires. Most 500-series models support scheduling through buttons on the unit itself, and higher-end models allow the use of a remote control, smartphone app, or smart-home automation integration to program schedules.

=== Maintenance ===
Roombas require regular cleaning and maintenance. Because they are smaller and less powerful than large upright vacuums, the dustbin must be emptied frequently, sometimes as often as every single use. Hair and other obstructions must be removed from rollers and brushes more frequently. Some reviewers have complained about this necessity compared to traditional upright vacuums that only need infrequent cleaning and almost no maintenance; however, others have countered that the chore is not difficult and that it takes significantly less time to clean a Roomba than it does to vacuum by hand.

== Models ==

 there have been ten generations of Roomba units. All models have a patented design using pairs of brushes or rollers rotating in opposite directions to pick up debris from the floor. In some models, the brushes are followed by a squeegee vacuum, which directs the airflow through a narrow slit to increase its speed in order to collect fine dust. A horizontally mounted &quot;side spinner&quot; brush on the right side of the unit sweeps against walls to reach debris not accessible by the main brushes and vacuum. In the first generation, the dirty air passes through the fan before reaching the filter, while later models use a fan-bypass vacuum.

The early-generation models use a random algorithm by &quot;bumping&quot; to achieve total room coverage.
A small vacuum motor with the help of rotating brushes extract the debris into a removable dustbin. The robot moves around the room with two rubber wheels on the backside of the unit. Roomba’s are equipped with several sensors, including inside the bumper machinism. IR emitters and receivers are equipped inside the bumper to communicate with the Home Base or Clean Base during docking. These sensors also initiate the self emptying cycle (Clean Base only). An ultrasonic proximity sensor is also used to slow the Roomba down to minimize impact into walls. iRobot’s patented “RCON” sensor is located on the top of the bumper. This sensor helps the Roomba avoid Virtual Walls, its Home Base and/or Clean Base. The robot is powered by a rechargeable battery contained inside the unit.

=== First generation: Original series ===

Introduced in September 2002, the first-generation Roomba had three buttons for room size. The first-generation units comprised the original silver-colored Roomba, the blue Roomba Pro, and the maroon Roomba Pro Elite. The latter two models included additional accessories, but all three used the same core robot and cleaning system

An original Roomba model robotic vacuum is in the collection of the National Museum of American History, which they note as the first successful domestic robot. The robot vacuum is described as being able to change direction when it encounters an obstacle or infrared beam and is powered by a battery.

=== Second generation: Discovery and 400 series ===
The second-generation Roombas (&quot;Discovery,&quot; later called the 400 series) replaced their predecessors in July 2004. It featured a larger dust bin, improved software that calculates room size, dirt detection, and fast charging in the home base. Room size is detected automatically based on the longest straight-line path that can be driven. Instead of buttons for room size, their buttons are &quot;Clean,&quot; &quot;Spot,&quot; and &quot;Max&quot;.

Roomba budget models (Dirt Dog and Model 401) used a simplified interface (a single &quot;Clean&quot; button) and lacked some of the software-controlled flexibility of other versions. They were less expensive models intended for first-time purchasers. The Roomba Dirt Dog contained sweeping brushes and a larger dust bin, but lacked the vacuum motor, using the space that would be required for the vacuum for additional dust bin volume. It was designed for a home shop or garage environment. The Roomba Model 401 was similar but had a standard-size dust bin and vacuum system. The Dirt Dog was discontinued in 2010.

=== Third generation: Professional and 500/600 series ===

The 500 series was introduced in August 2007 and featured a forward-looking infrared sensor to detect obstacles and reduce impact speed, a docking command button, improved mechanical components, smoother operation, and a modular design to facilitate part replacement. The Roombas&#x27; speed is also increased, which is possible in part because of the sensors to avoid bumping into obstacles too hard. It also introduced customizable decorative face plates. The Roomba 530 included two virtual walls and a charging dock. The 560 was one of the first Roombas to offer onboard scheduling and was also sold in a 562 Pet Series model with different brushes designed to clean up pet hair.

This model also included a newer version of the navigation software, now called iAdapt.

There are several types of dust and debris collection bins for the 500 series models. The standard vacuum bin incorporates a squeegee vacuum. The high-capacity sweeper bin does not include a vacuum, but has greater debris capacity. The AeroVac Bin directs suction airflow through the main brushes instead of using a squeegee, which is thought to keep the brushes cleaner.

The line was continued with the 600 series models, several of which had Wi-Fi enhancements. The 600 Professional Series robot was marketed towards small businesses. Several 600 series robots were praised for being budget friendly.
=== Fourth generation: 700 series ===

The 700 series, introduced in May 2011, though largely similar to the 500 and 600 series, included a more robust cleaning system, an improved AeroVac Bin with HEPA filter, and improved battery life. Like the 500 series, the 700 series had models with different technologies and accessories. The Roomba 760 was the simplest model, and the Roombas 780 and 790 were the most advanced, with both scheduling and a large range of accessories, including lighthouses, a wireless command center (also compatible with select retrofitted 500-series models), and extra brushes and filters. Besides these two models, Roomba 770 and 782e were available, with scheduling, dirt detection, and full bin indicator.

=== Fifth generation: 800 series ===

The 800 series, introduced in 2013, is similar to the 700 series and its predecessors but contains updated technology. The AeroForce Performance Cleaning System, which is five times more powerful than the older series, and the iRobot XLife battery are some of the new features. The AeroForce system does away with the large rotating brush and pulls air between two rubber rollers, thereby getting the vacuum suction closer to the floor. The 805, released in 2013, was one of the earliest 800 models that utilizes the AeroForce cleaning system and has scheduling abilities, which allows up to 7 prescheduled runs per week, and comes with two virtual wall barriers. The 860 has an onboard HEPA filter and a more powerful motor and also contains a longer-lasting lithium-ion battery while the 870 and 880 have a NiMH (nickel–metal hydride) battery. In 2017, iRobot released the 890 with Wi-Fi connectivity that can be started with an app and various personal-assistant software. 

=== Sixth generation: 900 series ===

The Roomba 980 was released in September 2015 and contains a new iAdapt 2.0 visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) navigation system, which allows it to clean an entire level of a home more efficiently. The 980 also features Wi-Fi connectivity and an iPhone and Android app. The Roomba 960 was released on August 4, 2016. As of March 29, 2017, 900 series users can receive detailed cleaning maps of their Roomba through the app. The maps show exact areas of clean and dirty spots in the home, allowing the Roomba to know where it needs to spend more time cleaning. However, the maps are not retained between cleaning runs. Each time the Roomba vacuums, it builds a new map from scratch. Push notifications of when the Roomba is finished cleaning are also a new feature. Integration to Amazon’s Echo was also announced, launching in spring 2017.

=== Seventh generation: i series and e series ===

In September 2018, iRobot introduced a new Roomba series with three models: the Roomba i7, and the more basic e5 and e6. The Roomba i7 also had a &quot;plus&quot; version that featured the “Clean Base Automatic Dirt Disposal Station”. It could automatically self empty the dustbin without your assistance. Similarly to the 900 series, the i7 uses vSLAM navigation, but it was upgraded to the newer iAdapt 3.0 system. This new version retains the map after the Roomba has run, and uses subsequent runs to improve the map. This lets users select which room for Roomba to clean from the iRobot Home app. The i6 and i7 were criticised for being poor value.

In September 2020, iRobot released the i3, which is a lower-cost robot similar to the i7. The i3 does not use vSLAM navigation but relies on a downward optical encoder and gyroscopes; in addition, it doesn&#x27;t allow selecting specific rooms, though this capability was added in 2022 with a firmware update in some regions. The i7 and i3 are compatible with the Clean Base, a base that empties the Roomba&#x27;s bin into the Clean Base&#x27;s internal disposable bag when it docks using a powerful vacuum. iRobot claims that the base can empty the Roomba&#x27;s bin up to 30 cleaning cycles. The + in some models indicates that it includes the Clean Base. The i3 EVO model has upgraded firmware to include Smart Mapping functionality. The i3 received criticism for its poor navigation. The similar i4 and i5 robots, branded for European markets, were released in 2022. The i8+ was sold exclusively at Costco. 

The basic e5 Roomba replaces the 800 series with an improved battery life of 60 to 90 minutes of run time on hardwood floors using a lithium-ion battery. It navigates in random patterns similar to the 6th generation and older robots. iRobot followed this with the similar e6 model. iRobot has also later released the i1 as a budget model through select retailers.

=== Eighth generation: s series ===
In late May 2019, iRobot introduced the Roomba s9 and s9+ as the &quot;smartest, most powerful robot vacuum yet.&quot;. The S series features a newly designed &quot;D&quot; shape and corner brush for optimized edge cleaning deep into corners and along edges. Other new features include an anti-allergen system that traps 99% of pollen, mold, and allergens, 40 times the suction compared to the 600 series, 30% wider rubber brushes, and the most advanced navigation system to date. Similar to the I series, the s9+ comes with the self-emptying Clean Base. The S series also includes linking technology that allows the Roomba to communicate wirelessly with other iRobot products, where the Braava Jet M6 can automatically be set to mop after the s9 has finished vacuuming.

=== Ninth generation: j series ===
The j7 and j7+ models went on sale in September 2021 and debuted Precision Vision: the navigation system that detects and avoids obstacles like power cords and pet waste. The j7 is a direct upgrade to the Roomba i7, with the same overall body design and rated ten times the suction compared to the standard model. iRobot simultaneously removed the i7 from its website.

In September 2022, iRobot announced the Roomba Combo j7+, which is a Roomba j7+ that includes mopping capabilities with a lifting mop. Shipping began on October 4. iRobot has also released the j8+ which is a Costco exclusive variant of the j7+.
On September 11, 2023, iRobot released the Roomba j9+, Combo j9+, and Combo j5. The Roomba j9+ offers 100% more suction compared to other j and i series Roombas. The Roomba Combo j9+ offers an entire new docking station with a water tank refill function added. Both j9+, Combo j9, and Combo j5 received new iRobot OS updates.
=== Other variants ===
iRobot has also released Roomba variants that do not fall into the traditional generation classifications. These variants typically have their own naming conventions, and/or have different architectures. The earliest known variant is the r1, released in 2021. The r1 contained two side brushes instead of one, one main roller instead of two, and a removable mop pad.

In April 2023, iRobot announced the Roomba Combo® Essential Robot, which also included a single main roller and a removable mop pad. This was later followed by the Roomba Vac Essential, which is the same robot without the mopping attachment.

=== Tenth Generation, Max Series ===
The new 10 max

== Programming ==

From the earliest models on, Roomba vacuum cleaning robots have been hacked to extend their functionality. The first adaptations were based on a microcontroller that was directly connected to the motor drivers and sensors. Versions manufactured after October 2005 contain an electronic and software interface that allows hackers to more easily control or modify behavior and remotely monitor its sensors. One early application was using the device to map a room. The native code for Roomba is written in a dialect of Lisp.

Models with an interface (400 series since October 2007 plus 500 and 700 series) come with a Mini-DIN connector supporting a serial interface, which is electrically and physically incompatible with standard PC/Mac serial ports and cables. However, third-party adapters are available to access the Roomba&#x27;s computer via Bluetooth, USB, or RS-232 (PC/Mac serial). Roombas pre-October 2005 upgraded with the OSMO hacker device allow monitoring many sensors and modifying the unit&#x27;s behavior. The Roomba Open Interface (OI, formerly Roomba Serial Command Interface) allows programmers and roboticists to create their own enhancements. Several projects are described on Roomba hacking sites.

In response to the growing interest of hackers in their product, the company developed the iRobot Create. In this model the vacuum cleaner motor is replaced by a &quot;cargo bay&quot; for mounting devices like TV cameras, lasers and other robotic parts. It provides a greatly enhanced 25-pin interface providing both analog and digital bidirectional communication with the hosted device allowing use as the mobile base for completely new robots. Together with a computing platform like a netbook or handheld device with wireless networking, it can be remotely controlled through a network.

<text>A subject is one of the two main parts of a sentence (the other being the predicate, which modifies the subject).

For the simple sentence &quot;John runs&quot;, &quot;John&quot; is the subject, a person or thing about whom the statement is made. 

Traditionally the subject is the word or phrase which controls the verb in the clause, that is to say with which the verb agrees (&quot;John is&quot; but &quot;John and Mary are&quot;). If there is no verb, as in &quot;Nicola what an idiot!&quot;, or if the verb has a different subject, as in &quot;John I can&#x27;t stand him!&quot;, then &#x27;John&#x27; is not considered to be the grammatical subject, but can be described as the &quot;topic&quot; of the sentence.

While these definitions apply to simple English sentences, defining the subject is more difficult in more complex sentences and languages. For example, in the sentence &quot;It is difficult to learn French&quot;, the subject seems to be the word &quot;it&quot;, and yet arguably the real subject (the thing that is difficult) is &quot;to learn French&quot;. A sentence such as &quot;It was John who broke the window&quot; is more complex still. Sentences beginning with a locative phrase, such as &quot;There is a problem, isn&#x27;t there?&quot;, in which the tag question &quot;isn&#x27;t there?&quot; seems to imply that the subject is the adverb &quot;there&quot;, also create difficulties for the definition of subject.

In languages such as Latin and German the subject of a verb has a form which is known as the nominative case: for example, the form &#x27;he&#x27; (not &#x27;him&#x27; or &#x27;his&#x27;) is used in sentences such as &quot;he ran&quot;, He &quot;broke the window&quot;, He &quot;is a teacher&quot;, He &quot;was hit by a motorist&quot;. But there are some languages such as Basque or Greenlandic, in which the form of a noun or pronoun when the verb is intransitive (&quot;he ran&quot;) is different from when the verb is transitive (&quot;he broke the window&quot;). In these languages, which are known as ergative languages, the concept of subject may not apply at all.

==Technical definition==
The subject (glossing abbreviations: or ) is, according to a tradition that can be traced back to Aristotle (and that is associated with phrase structure grammars), one of the two main constituents of a clause, the other constituent being the predicate, whereby the predicate says something about the subject. According to a tradition associated with predicate logic and dependency grammars, the subject is the most prominent overt argument of the predicate. By this position all languages with arguments have subjects, though there is no way to define this consistently for all languages. Even in languages such as English, there is not always a perfect match between the semantic predicand and the subject, as a predicate may be predicated on an argument in another clause (see raising).

From a functional perspective, a subject is a phrase that conflates nominative case with the topic. Many languages (such as those with ergative or Austronesian alignment) do not do this, and by this definition would not have subjects.

All of these positions see the subject determining person and number agreement on the finite verb, as exemplified by the difference in verb forms between &quot;he eats&quot; and &quot;they eat&quot;. The stereotypical subject immediately precedes the finite verb in declarative sentences and represents an agent or a theme. The subject is often a multi-word constituent and should be distinguished from parts of speech, which, roughly, classify words within constituents.

In the example sentences below, the subjects are indicated in boldface.
# The dictionary helps me find words.
# Strangely enough, ice cream appeared on the table.
# The man who is sitting over there told me that he just bought a ticket to Tahiti.
# Nothing else is good enough.
# That nothing else is good enough shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise.
# To eat six different kinds of vegetables a day is healthy.
# Despite her objections, he sold us ten bags of clothes.

== Forms of the subject ==

The subject is a constituent that can be realized in numerous forms, many of which are listed in the following table:

==Criteria for identifying subjects==
There are several criteria for identifying subjects:

#Subject-verb agreement: The subject agrees with the finite verb in person and number, e.g. &quot;I am&quot; vs. &quot;*I is&quot;.
#Position occupied: The subject typically immediately precedes the finite verb in declarative clauses, e.g. &quot;Tom laughs&quot;.
#Semantic role: A typical subject in the active voice is an agent or theme, i.e. it performs the action expressed by the verb or when it is a theme, it receives a property assigned to it by the predicate.

Of these three criteria, the first one (agreement) is the most reliable. The subject agrees with the finite verb in person and number (and sometimes in gender as well). The second and third criterion are merely strong tendencies that can be flouted in certain constructions, e.g.
#Tom is studying chemistry. 
#Is Tom studying chemistry? 
#Chemistry is being studied (by Tom). 

In the first sentence, all three criteria combine to identify &quot;Tom&quot; as the subject. In the second sentence, which involves the subject-auxiliary inversion of a yes/no-question, the subject immediately follows the finite verb (instead of immediately preceding it), which means the second criterion is flouted. And in the third sentence expressed in the passive voice, the 1st and the 2nd criterion combine to identify &quot;chemistry&quot; as the subject, whereas the third criterion suggests that &quot;by Tom&quot; should be the subject because &quot;Tom&quot; is an agent.
The fourth criterion is better applicable to other languages, the exception being the subject and object forms of pronouns, &quot;I/me&quot;, &quot;he/him&quot;, &quot;she/her, they/them&quot;.

The fifth criterion is helpful in languages that typically drop pronominal subjects, such as Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Latin, Greek, Japanese, and Mandarin. Though most of these languages are rich in verb forms for determining the person and number of the subject, Japanese and Mandarin have no such forms at all. This dropping pattern does not automatically make a language a pro-drop language. In other languages, like English and French, most clauses should have a subject, which should be either a noun (phrase), a pronoun, or a clause. This is also true when the clause has no element to be represented by it. This is why verbs like &quot;rain&quot; must have a subject such as &quot;it&quot;, even if nothing is actually being represented by &quot;it&quot;. In this case, &quot;it&quot; is an expletive and a dummy pronoun. In imperative clauses, most languages elide the subject, even in languages which typically requires a subject to be present, e.g.

*Give it to me.
*Dā mihi istud. (Latin)
*Me dá isso. (Brazilian Portuguese)
*Dá-me isso. (European Portuguese)
*Dámelo. (Spanish)
*Dammelo. (Italian)

==Coordinated sentences==
One criterion for identifying a subject in various languages is the possibility of its omission in coordinated sentences such as the following: The man hit the woman and [the man] came here.

In a passive construction, the patient becomes the subject by this criterion: The woman was hit by the man and [the woman] came here.

In ergative languages such as the nearly extinct Australian language Dyirbal, in a transitive sentence it is the patient rather than the agent that can be omitted in such sentences: &quot;Balan dyugumbil baŋgul yaraŋgu balgan, baninyu&quot; &#x27;The man (&quot;bayi yara&quot;) hit the woman (&quot;balan dyugumbil&quot;) and [she] came here&#x27;

This suggests that in ergative languages of this kind the patient is actually the subject in a transitive sentence.

==Difficult cases==
There are certain constructions that challenge the criteria just introduced for identifying subjects. The following subsections briefly illustrate three such cases: 1) existential &quot;there&quot;-constructions, 2) inverse copular constructions, and 3) locative inversion constructions.

===Existential &quot;there&quot;-constructions===
Existential &quot;there&quot;-constructions allow for varying interpretations about what should count as the subject, e.g.
#There″s problems.
#There are problems.

In sentence 1, the first criterion (agreement) and the second criterion (position occupied) suggest that &quot;there&quot; is the subject, whereas the third criterion (semantic role) suggests rather that &quot;problems&quot; is the subject. In sentence 2, in contrast, agreement and semantic role suggest that &quot;problems&quot; is the subject, whereas position occupied suggests that &quot;there&quot; is the subject. In such cases then, one can take the first criterion as the most telling; the subject should agree with the finite verb.

===Inverse copular constructions===
Another difficult case for identifying the subject is the so-called &quot;inverse copular constructions&quot;, e.g.
#The boys are a chaotic force around here.
#A chaotic force around here is the boys. 

The criteria combine to identify &quot;the boys&quot; as the subject in sentence 1. But if that is the case, then one might argue that &quot;the boys&quot; is also the subject in the similar sentence 2, even though two of the criteria (agreement and position occupied) suggest that &quot;a chaotic force around here&quot; is the subject. When confronted with such data, one has to make a decision that is less than fully arbitrary. If one assumes again that criterion one (agreement) is the most reliable, one can usually identify a subject.

===Locative inversion constructions===
Yet another type of construction that challenges the subject concept is locative inversion, e.g.
#Spiders have been breeding under the bed.
#Under the bed have been breeding spiders. 
# *Where have been breeding spiders? 
#Where have spiders been breeding? 

The criteria easily identify &quot;spiders&quot; as the subject in sentence 1. In sentence 2, however, the position occupied suggests that &quot;under the bed&quot; should be construed as the subject, whereas agreement and semantic role continue to identify &quot;spiders&quot; as the subject. This is so despite the fact that &quot;spiders&quot; in sentence 2 appears after the string of verbs in the canonical position of an object. The fact that sentence 3 is bad but sentence 4 is good reveals that something unusual is indeed afoot, since the attempt to question the location fails if the subject does not immediately follow the finite verb. This further observation speaks against taking &quot;spiders&quot; as the subject in sentence 2. But if &quot;spiders&quot; is not the subject, then the sentence must lack a subject entirely.

==Subject-less clauses==
The existence of subject-less clauses can be construed as particularly problematic for theories of sentence structure that build on the binary subject-predicate division. A simple sentence is defined as the combination of a subject and a predicate, but if no subject is present, how can one have a sentence? Subject-less clauses are absent from English for the most part, but they are not unusual in related languages. In German, for instance, impersonal passive clauses can lack a recognizable subject, e.g.

The word &quot;gestern&quot; &#x27;yesterday&#x27; is generally construed as an adverb, which means it cannot be taken as the subject in this sentence. Certain verbs in German also require a dative or accusative object instead of a nominative subject, e.g.

Since subjects are typically marked by the nominative case in German (the fourth criterion above), one can argue that this sentence lacks a subject, for the relevant verb argument appears in the dative case, not in the nominative.

Impersonal sentences in Scottish Gaelic can occasionally have a very similar form to the first German example where an actor is omitted. In the following sentence, the word ‘chaidh’ (&quot;went&quot;) is an auxiliary carrying tense and is used in an impersonal or passive constructions. The word ‘falbh’ (&quot;leaving&quot;) is a verbal noun.

==Subjects in sentence structure==
The subject receives a privileged status in theories of sentence structure. In those approaches that acknowledge the binary division of the clause into a subject and a predicate (as is the case in most phrase structure grammars), the subject is usually an immediate dependent of the root node, whereby its sister is the predicate. The object, in contrast, appears lower in the structure as a dependent of the/a verb, e.g.

Subjects are indicated using blue, and objects using orange. The special status of the subject is visible insofar as the subject is higher in the tree each time than the object. In theories of syntax that reject the initial division (as is the case in most dependency grammars), the subject is nevertheless also granted a privileged status insofar as it is an immediate dependent of the finite verb. The following trees are those of a dependency grammar:

The subject is a dependent of the root node, the finite verb, in both trees. The object, in contrast, appears lower in the second tree, where it is a dependent of the non-finite verb. The subject remains a dependent finite verb when subject-auxiliary inversion occurs:

The prominence of the subject is consistently reflected in its position in the tree as an immediate dependent of the root word, the finite verb.

<doc id="594593" wikidata="Q4929345" url="?curid=594593" title="Blue Laws (Connecticut)">
<text>The Blue Laws of the Colony of Connecticut are an invented set of harsh statutes governing conduct in the Puritan colony, listed in a history of Connecticut that was published in 1781 in London by the Reverend Samuel Peters, an Anglican who had been forced to leave America. Peters&#x27; book popularized the term &quot;blue laws&quot;, referring to laws restricting activities on Sunday.

==Background==
Peters was an Anglican priest hostile to the cause of American independence and had been forced to flee to London in late 1774, shortly before the Revolutionary War began; he made up 45 harsh laws as a hoax to discredit America as backwards and fanatical, and in 1781 published them in a book called &quot;A General History of Connecticut&quot;, which contains numerous other tall tales.

According to Peters the blue laws &quot;were never suffered to be printed&quot;, but especially in the 19th century they were confused with the Code of 1650 of the colonists of Connecticut and with the statutes drafted in 1655 by Governor Theophilus Eaton for the then unconnected Colony of New Haven, for which he drew on the writings of the Reverend John Cotton and the laws of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and which were printed in London in blue covers for the use of the colonists.

Peters was probably the first to popularize the term &quot;blue laws&quot;. Its etymology is unclear, but he implied a relationship to the expletive &quot;bloody&quot;, saying that they &quot;were very properly termed &quot;Blue Laws&quot;, i.e. &quot;Bloody Laws&quot;, for they were all sanctified with excommunication, confiscation, fines, banishment, whippings, cutting off the ears, burning the tongue, and death.&quot;

<text>Carey McWilliams (December 13, 1905 – June 27, 1980) was an American author, editor, and lawyer. He is best known for his writings about California politics and culture, including the condition of migrant farm workers and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. From 1955 to 1975, he edited &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine.

==Early years==
McWilliams was born December 13, 1905, in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. His father was a cattle rancher and also a State Senator. His father died three months before he graduated from Wolfe Hall Military Academy in 1921. He attended University of Denver but was asked to leave during his freshman year for &quot;celebrating St. Patrick&#x27;s Day too enthusiastically.&quot; He first came to California in 1922, a day or two later.

McWilliams attended the University of Southern California from which he obtained a law degree in 1927.

From 1927 to 1938, McWilliams practiced law in Los Angeles at Black, Hammock &amp; Black. Some of his cases, including his defense of striking Mexican citrus workers, prefigured his later writing.

During the 1920s and early 1930s, McWilliams joined a loose network of mostly Southern California writers that included Robinson Jeffers, John Fante, Louis Adamic, and Upton Sinclair. His literary career also benefited greatly from his relationships with Mary Austin and H.L. Mencken. Mencken provided an outlet for McWilliams&#x27;s early journalism and floated the idea for his first book, a 1929 biography of popular writer and sometime Californian Ambrose Bierce.

During the 1940s, McWilliams lived in Echo Park, California, a neighborhood of Los Angeles. He owned his home at 2041 Alvarado Street until the 1970s, well after he moved to New York in 1951.

==Political activity and publications==
The Depression and the rise of European fascism in the 1930s radicalized McWilliams. He began working with left-wing political and legal organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Lawyers Guild. He also wrote for &quot;Pacific Weekly,&quot; &quot;Controversy,&quot; &quot;The Nation&quot;, and other progressive magazines. He continued to represent workers in and around Los Angeles, helped organize unions and guilds, and served as a trial examiner for the new National Labor Relations Board.

McWilliams&#x27;s activism took many forms. In the early 1940s, he helped overturn the convictions of mostly-Latino youths following the so-called Sleepy Lagoon murder trial. He also helped cool the city&#x27;s temperature during the Zoot Suit Riots of 1943, when scuffles between servicemen and Latino youths spun out of control.

Once out of government, McWilliams became an outspoken critic of the removal and internment of Japanese American citizens and almost immediately began writing an exposé on the topic. Published in 1944, &quot;Prejudice: Japanese-Americans: Symbol of Racial Intolerance&quot; was cited by Justice Frank Murphy in his dissenting opinion in &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;, the Supreme Court decision that upheld the constitutionality of the exclusion.

His first bestseller, &quot;Factories in the Field&quot;, appeared in 1939 and ranks among his most enduring works. Published within months of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, it examines the lives of migrant farm workers in California and condemns the politics and consequences of California agricultural land monopoly and large-scale agribusiness. Shortly before its publication, McWilliams accepted an offer from incoming Governor Culbert Olson to head California&#x27;s Division of Immigration and Housing. Over his four-year term (1938–1942), he focused on improving agricultural working conditions and wages, but his hopes for major reform deteriorated with the advent of World War II.

McWilliams left his government post in 1942, when incoming Governor Earl Warren promised campaign audiences that his first official act would be to fire him. McWilliams was a sharp critic of Warren, whom he described as &quot;the personification of Smart Reaction,&quot; but he became an enthusiastic admirer after Warren joined the US Supreme Court the following decade. No such conversion occurred in his attitude toward another California politician, Richard Nixon, whom McWilliams described in 1950 as &quot;a dapper little man with an astonishing capacity for petty malice.&quot;

After leaving the state government, McWilliams continued to write prolifically. He turned his attention to issues of racial and ethnic equality, writing a series of important books (including &quot;Brothers Under the Skin&quot;, &quot;Prejudice&quot;, &quot;North from Mexico&quot;, and &quot;A Mask for Privilege&quot;) that dealt with the treatment of immigrant and minority groups. He also produced two regional portraits, &quot;Southern California Country: An Island on the Land&quot; (1946, American Folkways series) and &quot;California: The Great Exception&quot; (1949), which many aficionados still regard as the finest interpretive histories of those areas. Decades after its publication, &quot;Southern California Country&quot; inspired Robert Towne&#x27;s Oscar-winning original screenplay for &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974).

In 1951, McWilliams moved to New York City to work at &quot;The Nation&quot; under editor Freda Kirchwey. For the next decade, he helped shepherd the magazine through its most difficult period. Taking over as editor in 1955, he stayed until 1975 and is credited with strengthening the magazine&#x27;s investigative reporting. He also published the early work of Ralph Nader, Howard Zinn, Theodore Roszak, William Ryan and Hunter S. Thompson. William Ryan credited McWilliams with challenging him to write what became his classic book &#x27;Blaming the victim&#x27; (1971). Thompson credited McWilliams with the idea for his first bestselling book, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels: A Strange and Terrible Saga&quot; (1967).

==Accusations of communist sympathies==
&quot;Witch Hunt&quot; (1950) was an early attempt to combat McCarthyism, which McWilliams considered a grave threat to civil liberties and healthy politics. Although he was never a member of the Communist Party, he was a frequent target of anticommunist attacks. In the 1940s, he was called before the Committee on Un-American Activities in California. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover placed him on the Custodial Detention List and this made him a candidate for detention in case of national emergency even though McWilliams was serving in the state government at the time.

Several years later, a group of Los Angeles screenwriters, directors, and producers known as the Hollywood Ten was cited for contempt of Congress after refusing to answer a House committee&#x27;s questions about Communist Party membership. McWilliams drafted a Supreme Court amicus brief for two of them, John Howard Lawson and Dalton Trumbo. (The Court declined to hear their appeal.)

==McWilliams and Bay of Pigs story==
McWilliams was the first American reporter to reveal that the CIA was training a group of Cuban exiles in Guatemala for the Bay of Pigs Invasion. His article for &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Are We Training Cuban Guerrillas?&quot;, was published in November 1960, during the Eisenhower Administration, five months before the invasion occurred.

The story was largely ignored by major newspapers like &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., an aide to President John F. Kennedy, pressured &quot;The New Republic&quot; not to run a story about the guerrilla force. Following the failure of the invasion, Kennedy expressed regret that more information about the invasion plan was not published by telling &quot;Times&quot; reporter Turner Catledge, &quot;If you had printed more about the operation, you would have saved us from a colossal mistake.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
McWilliams died in New York City on June 27, 1980, at 74. Since his death, his critical fortunes have risen steadily. The American Political Science Association gives an annual Carey McWilliams Award &quot;to honor a major journalistic contribution to our understanding of politics.&quot; In &quot;Embattled Dreams&quot; (2002), California historian Kevin Starr calls McWilliams &quot;the single finest nonfiction on California–ever,&quot; and biographer Peter Richardson maintains that McWilliams might be the most versatile American public intellectual of the twentieth century.

His first son, Wilson Carey McWilliams, was a noted political scientist who taught at Rutgers University. His second son, Jerry McWilliams, was an expert on vinyl disc records preservation. McWilliams had two grandchildren: Susan McWilliams Barndt, a professor of politics at Pomona College, and Helen McWilliams, the lead singer of VAGIANT Boston.

McWilliams&#x27;s papers are housed in the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley and at Special Collections at the University of California, Los Angeles.

<text>Broadcasting House is the headquarters of the BBC, in Portland Place and Langham Place, London. The first radio broadcast from the building was made on 15 March 1932, and the building was officially opened two months later, on 15 May. The main building is in Art Deco style, with a facing of Portland stone over a steel frame. It is a Grade II* listed building and includes the BBC Radio Theatre, where music and speech programmes are recorded in front of a studio audience.

As part of a major consolidation of the BBC&#x27;s property portfolio in London, Broadcasting House has been extensively renovated and extended. This involved the demolition of post-war extensions on the eastern side of the building, replaced by a new wing completed in 2005. The wing was named the &quot;John Peel Wing&quot; in 2012, after the disc jockey. BBC London, BBC Arabic Television and BBC Persian Television are housed in the new wing, which also contains the reception area for BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra (the studios themselves are in the new extension to the main building). In February 2024, BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 6 Music moved their operations into the Peel Wing, opposite the BBC Radio 1 studios on the eighth floor; this was facilitated by converting office space within the building, after the BBC decided to move the radio stations out of Wogan House. 

The main building was refurbished, and an extension built to the rear. The radio stations BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 4 Extra and the BBC World Service transferred to refurbished studios within the building. The extension links the old building with the John Peel Wing, and includes a new combined newsroom for BBC News, with studios for the BBC News channel, BBC World News and other news programming. The move of news operations from BBC Television Centre was completed in March 2013.

The official name of the building is &quot;Broadcasting House&quot; but the BBC now also uses the term &quot;“new Broadcasting House”&quot; (with a lowercase &#x27;n&#x27;) in its publicity referring to the new extension rather than the whole building, with the original building known as “old Broadcasting House”.

==Construction==

Construction of Broadcasting House began in 1928, with programmes gradually transferring to the building. On 15 March 1932, the first musical programme was given by the bandleader Henry Hall and the BBC Dance Orchestra. Hall also wrote and performed, with his dance band, &quot;Radio Times&quot;, the name of the BBC&#x27;s schedule publication.

The first news bulletin was read by Stuart Hibberd on 18 March. The last transmission from Savoy Hill was on 14 May, and Broadcasting House officially opened on 15 May 1932. George Val Myer designed the building in collaboration with the BBC&#x27;s civil engineer, M. T. Tudsbery. The interiors were the work of Raymond McGrath, an Australian-Irish architect. He directed a team that included Serge Chermayeff and Wells Coates and designed the vaudeville studio, the associated green and dressing rooms, and the dance and chamber music studios in a flowing Art Deco style.

The building is built in two parts. Dispensing with the oft-found central light-well of contemporary buildings this size, the central core containing the recording studios was a windowless structure built of brick. (Structural brick rather than steel framing was used in order to reduce noise transmission both from without and between studios.) The surrounding outer portion, designed for offices and ancillary spaces, is steel-framed and faced with Portland stone. While the outer portion had plenty of windows, the inner core required special sound-dampened ventilation systems.

There were two areas where right of ancient lights would cause height restrictions. While the rights on the southern side ceased to be a problem after the owners of those rights gave concessions, the rights on the eastern side were dealt with by sloping the roof away from the street from the fourth floor up. This not only affected the floor plan of the structure, but meant that the interior recording tower could not be built to the top floor. (Thus, one studio on the top floor was actually outside the central studio core structure.)

Underground structures, including a hundred-year-old sewer, also presented problems during construction. The building is above the Bakerloo line of the London Underground: the Victoria line was tunnelled beneath in the 1960s, and presented problems for construction of the Egton Wing (see below). Noise from passing trains is audible within the radio theatre but generally imperceptible in recordings. The ground floor was fitted with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the street, as the BBC believed that to finance such a project (costing £25 million in today&#x27;s money), they would need to let the ground floor as a retail unit. The rapid expansion of the BBC meant this never occurred.

The original building is a Grade II* listed building.

==Renovation==
Beginning in 2003, Broadcasting House underwent a major renovation during the BBC&#x27;s W1 Programme, with the aim of refurbishing the building and combining a number of the BBC&#x27;s operations in a new extension. This houses the television and radio operations of BBC News, relocated from Television Centre, and the BBC World Service, which relocated from Bush House on 12 July 2012. Many of the BBC&#x27;s national radio stations are also broadcast from the building, with the exception of BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra which have moved to Salford Quays. The building work was completed in two phases. It began with the demolition of two post-war extensions to the original building.

::&quot;The redevelopment was part of a wider cost-saving strategy to consolidate the BBC&#x27;s property portfolio and centralise its London operation. This will ultimately produce savings of more than £700m over the remaining 21-year life of the BBC lease on Broadcasting House.&quot;

===First phase===

The first phase consisted of the renovation of the original building, which was starting to show its age and needed structural repair, and a new wing to the east.

In the old building, the sloped &quot;cat slide&quot; slate roof was removed and many of the rooms stripped back to their walls, although much of the Art Deco architecture was retained and preserved. Much of the work focused on the lower walls and ceilings, which did not include Art Deco features. The reception area was renovated to include a new desk while retaining the message and statue as an attention piece. Many rooms had ceilings removed, such as the south tower, and new reinforcement joists were added.
The new Egton Wing is roughly the same shape as the main building, with a modern design and window arrangement but retaining features such as Portland stone. Towards the rear a large block was created in the side, mirroring that created in the main building when the sloping roof was removed.

The design of the extension, intended to equal the original in &quot;architectural creativity&quot;, was carried out by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard. Construction was completed in 2005, with the refurbished Broadcasting House and new Egton wing opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 April 2006 as part of her 80th birthday celebrations. All areas of the Egton Wing were fully fitted out and completed by 2007.

In 2012, it was announced by the then Director-General Mark Thompson that the Egton Wing would be renamed the &#x27;John Peel Wing&#x27; to commemorate the late Radio 1 disc jockey, whom he described as a &quot;great radio talent&quot;. Thompson described the wing as a &quot;fitting tribute to a man who personified so much of what the BBC stands for&quot;.
It houses BBC London, BBC Arabic Television and BBC Persian Television, together with the reception area for BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra.

===Second phase===

The second phase was the creation of the large wing to the rear of the building, joining the two buildings, and creating a plaza between them. The original architects were replaced for not agreeing to cost-related revisions, as Sir Richard MacCormac was unwilling to sacrifice the quality of his design. Construction was completed by Bovis Lend Lease in 2010, and control handed over to the BBC in 2011. While the rebuilding process was under way, many BBC radio stations moved to other buildings near Portland Place.

The extension contains the BBC News and Journalism departments, and state-of-the-art technical equipment and new studios to house the BBC News bulletins on television, the BBC News Channel and BBC World News, the BBC Arabic Television service and the BBC Persian Television service. At the heart of this is a new newsroom, the largest live newsroom in the world.

A walkway above the newsroom allows the public to view the work of journalists, connecting the foyer to the Radio Theatre and a new café for staff and the public. Complemented by the outdoor plaza, which could act as an outdoor arena and theatre, this is designed to engage the public with the television and radio making process. The extension is glass-covered in the plaza area and curved to contrast both wings either side and to continue the glass on both sides high up the building. On the Portland Place side, it continues the same use of Portland stone and glass as with the John Peel Wing.

On Monday 18 March 2013 at 1 pm, following the BBC News Channel&#x27;s final broadcast from Television Centre, the first news programme from Broadcasting House was aired: the &quot;BBC News at One&quot;, on BBC One and the BBC News Channel. BBC World News was the first of BBC&#x27;s news services to move into the new building on Monday 14 January 2013, beginning with &quot;GMT&quot; at noon.

Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the extension on 7 June 2013. The second phase development won the &#x27;Programme of the Year&#x27; award at the 2013 annual awards of the Association for Project Management.

==Studios==

===Original===
When built, Broadcasting House contained 22 radio studios for all programme genres, in the art-deco style with an emphasis on both looks and practicality. The practicality of the studios diminished rapidly as a result of the changing nature of broadcasting and changes in the required uses of the studios. These studios and their original intended roles were:

===Current===
Following the rebuild and refurbishment, several studios have been added and the studio structure changed dramatically. The current studios are:

==== Radio studios ====

==== Television studios ====
Until programmes air information is subject to change. All times listed are either Greenwich Mean Time or British Summer Time depending on what is being used in London.

==Artworks==
The building showcases works of art, most prominently the statues of Prospero and Ariel (from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;) by Eric Gill. Their choice was fitting since Prospero was a magician and scholar, and Ariel a spirit of the air, in which radio waves travel. There was, reportedly, controversy over some features of the statues when built and they were said to have been modified. They were reported to have been sculpted by Gill as God and Man, rather than Prospero and Ariel, and that there is a small carved picture of a beautiful girl on the back of Prospero. Additional carvings of Ariel are on the exterior in many bas-reliefs, some by Gill, others by Gilbert Bayes. The reception area contains a statue of &#x27;The sower&#x27; by Gill.

The statues of Prospero and Ariel have attracted controversy in recent years, due to evidence that Gill engaged in pedophilia, and that the sculptor&#x27;s sexuality might be reflected in the statue. The BBC has declined to remove the statue, citing Gill&#x27;s status as one of the preeminent British artists of the 20th century. On 13 January 2022, the statue was vandalized by a man wielding a hammer, who wrote &quot;Time to go was 1989&quot; and &quot;noose all paedos&quot; on the statue.

Several works of art were commissioned by the BBC for the refurbishment of Broadcasting House, at an overall cost of more than £4 million. Among these is &quot;World&quot;, a pavement artwork by the Canadian-born architect and artist Mark Pimlott. According to the BBC, the work &quot;reflects the global dimension of the BBC’s broadcasting and consists of over 750 stone flags inscribed with place names from around the world, as well as those from history, mythology and fantasy. The artwork is enhanced by elegant steel lines of longitude and latitude, a subtle scheme of small embedded lights and some audio installation linked to key output from the World Service.&quot;

On the roof of the John Peel wing, mirroring the radio mast, is &quot;Breathing&quot;, a cone-shaped glass structure reaching into the sky to the same height as the mast. It was sculpted by Jaume Plensa as a memorial to journalists killed in the line of duty. It includes words from a poem by James Fenton and is illuminated day and night. At 10 pm daily, in line with the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;, a column of light shines into the sky. It was officially unveiled on 16 June 2008, by the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

==Broadcasting House in literature==
The earliest use of Broadcasting House as a setting in fiction would seem to be in the 1934 detective novel &quot;Death at Broadcasting House&quot; by Val Gielgud and Holt Marvell (Eric Maschwitz), where an actor is found strangled in Studio 7C. Broadcasting House is a central feature in Penelope Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel &quot;Human Voices,&quot; published in 1980, where the lead characters work for the BBC during the Second World War. It is also the work place of Alexander Wedderburn in A. S. Byatt&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;Still Life,&quot; and Sam Bell in Ben Elton&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;Inconceivable&quot;, and also that of the evil nazi-sympathiser Ezzy Pound in Michael Paraskos&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;In Search of Sixpence.&quot; The building is well realised as a setting in Nicola Upson&#x27;s 2015 mystery novel &quot;London Rain&quot;.

== Statue of George Orwell ==

The head of BBC history, Robert Seatter, has said George Orwell in his novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949), &quot;reputedly based his notorious Room 101 from the novel &quot;on a room he had worked in whilst at the BBC.&quot;

On 7 November 2017, a statue of Orwell, sculpted by the British sculptor Martin Jennings, was unveiled, outside Broadcasting House. The wall behind the statue is inscribed with the following phrase: &quot;If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear&quot;. These are words from his proposed preface to &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and a rallying cry for the idea of free speech in an open society.

==MI5 involvement==
In 1985 it was revealed by &quot;The Observer&quot; that MI5 had had a special office in the building from 1937 for the purpose of vetting BBC employees for national security purposes.

<doc id="594615" wikidata="Q421888" url="?curid=594615" title="Ammonia solution">
<text>Ammonia solution, also known as ammonia water, ammonium hydroxide, ammoniacal liquor, ammonia liquor, aqua ammonia, aqueous ammonia, or (inaccurately) ammonia, is a solution of ammonia in water. It can be denoted by the symbols NH3(aq). Although the name ammonium hydroxide suggests a salt with the composition , it is impossible to isolate samples of NH4OH. The ions and OH− do not account for a significant fraction of the total amount of ammonia except in extremely dilute solutions.

The concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the Baumé scale (density), with 26 degrees Baumé (about 30% of ammonia by weight at ) being the typical high-concentration commercial product.

==Basicity of ammonia in water==
In aqueous solution, ammonia deprotonates a small fraction of the water to give ammonium and hydroxide according to the following equilibrium:
: NH3 + H2O ⇌ + OH−.
In a 1 M ammonia solution, about 0.42% of the ammonia is converted to ammonium, equivalent to pH = 11.63
because [] = 0.0042 M, [OH−] = 0.0042 M, [NH3] = 0.9958 M, and pH = 14 + log10[OH−] = 11.62. The base ionization constant is
: &quot;K&quot;b = = 1.77.

==Saturated solutions==
Like other gases, ammonia exhibits decreasing solubility in solvent liquids as the temperature of the solvent increases. Ammonia solutions decrease in density as the concentration of dissolved ammonia increases. At , the density of a saturated solution is 0.88 g/ml; it contains 35.6% ammonia by mass, 308 grams of ammonia per litre of solution, and has a molarity of approximately 18 mol/L. At higher temperatures, the molarity of the saturated solution decreases and the density increases. Upon warming of saturated solutions, ammonia gas is released.

==Applications==
In contrast to anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia finds few non-niche uses outside of cleaning agents.

=== Cleaning products ===
Ammonia solutions are used as a cleaning products for many surfaces and applications. Ammonia in water is sold as a cleaning agent by itself, usually labeled as simply &quot;ammonia&quot;, as well as in cleaning products combined with other ingredients. It may be sold plain, lemon-scented (and typically colored yellow), or pine-scented (green). Commonly available ammonia with soap added is known as &quot;cloudy ammonia&quot;.

Household ammonia ranges in concentration by weight from 5% to 10% ammonia. Because aqueous ammonia is a gas dissolved in water, as the water evaporates from a surface, the gas evaporates also, leaving the surface streak-free. Its most common uses are to clean glass, porcelain, and stainless steel. It is good at removing grease and is found in products for cleaning ovens and for soaking items to loosen baked-on grime. Experts also warn not to use ammonia-based cleaners on car touchscreens, due to the risk of damage to the screen&#x27;s anti-glare and anti-fingerprint coatings.

More concentrated solutions (higher than 10%) are used for in professional and industrial cleaning products.

US manufacturers of cleaning products are required to provide the product&#x27;s material safety data sheet that lists the concentration used. Solutions of ammonia can be dangerous. These solutions are irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes (respiratory and digestive tracts), and to a lesser extent the skin. Experts advise that caution be used to ensure the chemical is not mixed into any liquid containing bleach, due to the danger of forming toxic chloramine gas. Mixing with chlorine-containing products or strong oxidants, such as household bleach, can generate toxic chloramine fumes.

=== Alkyl amine precursor===
In industry, aqueous ammonia can be used as a precursor to some alkyl amines, although anhydrous ammonia is usually preferred. Hexamethylenetetramine forms readily from aqueous ammonia and formaldehyde. Ethylenediamine forms from 1,2-dichloroethane and aqueous ammonia.

=== Absorption refrigeration ===
In the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used, but after the development of the vapor compression cycle it lost much of its importance because of its low coefficient of performance (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Both the Electrolux refrigerator and the Einstein refrigerator are well known examples of this application of the ammonia solution.

=== Water treatment ===
Ammonia is used to produce chloramine, which may be utilised as a disinfectant. In drinking water, chloramine is preferred over direct chlorination for its ability to remain active in stagnant water pipes longer, thereby reducing the risk of waterborne infections.

Ammonia is used by aquarists for the purposes of setting up a new fish tank using an ammonia process called fishless cycling. This application requires that the ammonia contain no additives.

=== Food production ===
Baking ammonia (ammonium carbonate and ammonium bicarbonate) was one of the original chemical leavening agents. It was obtained from deer antlers. It is useful as a leavening agent, because ammonium carbonate is heat activated. This characteristic allows bakers to avoid both yeast&#x27;s long proofing time and the quick CO2 dissipation of baking soda in making breads and cookies rise. It is still used to make ammonia cookies and other crisp baked goods, but its popularity has waned because of ammonia&#x27;s off-putting smell and concerns over its use as a food ingredient compared to modern-day baking powder formulations. It has been assigned E number E527 for use as a food additive in the European Union.

Aqueous ammonia is used as an acidity regulator to bring down the acid levels in food. It is classified in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when using the food grade version. Its pH control abilities make it an effective antimicrobial agent.

=== Furniture darkening ===
In furniture-making, ammonia fuming was traditionally used to darken or stain wood containing tannic acid. After being sealed inside a container with the wood, fumes from the ammonia solution react with the tannic acid and iron salts naturally found in wood, creating a rich, dark stained look to the wood. This technique was commonly used during the Arts and Crafts movement in furniture – a furniture style which was primarily constructed of oak and stained using these methods.

=== Treatment of straw for cattle ===
Ammonia solution is used to treat straw, producing &quot;ammoniated straw&quot; making it more edible for cattle.

== Laboratory use ==
Aqueous ammonia is used in traditional qualitative inorganic analysis as a complexant and base. Like many amines, it gives a deep blue coloration with copper(II) solutions. Ammonia solution can dissolve silver oxide residues, such as those formed from Tollens&#x27; reagent. It is often found in solutions used to clean gold, silver, and platinum jewelry, but may have adverse effects on porous gem stones like opals and pearls.

<text>Mass politics is a political order resting on the emergence of mass political parties.

The emergence of mass politics generally associated with the rise of mass society coinciding with the Industrial Revolution in the West. However, because of the extent of popular participation in the Protestant Reformation, it has been called the first mass political movement, which &quot;other ideologies, ultimately more secular in tone&quot; superseded.

Mass politics was essentially the inclusion of the masses in the political process. The first of these mass movements was arguably that for Catholic Emancipation in Ireland, led by Daniel O&#x27;Connell. There was a major rise in this from 1880 to 1914, when the vote in Europe was expanded to all men and in some countries, even women were allowed to vote. Mass based political parties emerged as sophisticated vehicles for social, economic, and political reform.

<doc id="594632" wikidata="Q15635385" url="?curid=594632" title="Pebble bed modular reactor">
<text>The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) is a particular design of pebble bed reactor developed by South African company PBMR (Pty) Ltd from 1994 until 2009. PBMR facilities include gas turbine and heat transfer labs at the Potchefstroom Campus of North-West University, and at Pelindaba, a high pressure and temperature helium test rig, as well as a prototype fuel fabrication plant. A planned test reactor at Koeberg Nuclear Power Station was not built.

== Reactor design ==
The PBMR is characterised by inherent safety features, which mean that no human error or equipment failure can cause an accident that would harm the public.

Heat from the PBMR can be used for a variety of industrial process applications, including process steam for cogeneration applications, in-situ oil sands recovery, ethanol applications, refinery and petrochemical applications. The high temperature heat can also be used to reform methane to produce syngas (where the syngas can be used as feedstock to produce hydrogen, ammonia and methanol); and to produce hydrogen and oxygen by decomposing water thermochemically.

The PBMR is &quot;modular&quot; in that only small to mid-sized units will be designed. Larger power stations will be built by combining many of these modules. As of 2008, 400MWt was emerging as an optimum module size, considerably larger than the original concept size.

The PBMR is fuelled and moderated by graphite fuel spheres each containing TRISO coated low enriched uranium oxide fuel particles. There are 15000 fuel particles per fuel sphere the size of a billiard ball. &quot;Each fuel pebble contains 9 g of uranium, and this holds enough generation capacity to sustain a family of four, for a year. Five tons of coal and up to 23 000 m3 of water will be required to generate one pebble&#x27;s energy&quot;.

The concept is based on the AVR reactor and THTR in Germany, but modified to drive a Brayton closed-cycle gas turbine. The core design is annular with a centre column as a neutron reflector.

== PBMR (Pty) Ltd – history ==
Since its establishment in 1994, Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (Pty) Ltd grew into one of the largest nuclear reactor design teams in the world. In addition to the core team of some 700 people at the PBMR head-office in Centurion near Pretoria, more than 600 people at universities, private companies and research institutes were involved with the project.

In 2006, the US Department of Energy awarded the PBMR consortium the primary contract for the first phase of its New Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) project. The scope for the first phase of this contract, which has now been completed, was for the pre-conceptual engineering of a nuclear co-generation plant for the production of electricity and hydrogen. Requests for proposals for the second phase of the NGNP project will soon be issued, to which the PBMR consortium will be responding within the next few months of 2009.

In 2009 PBMR (Pty) announced that it was looking at employing the technology for process heat applications, and some pebble bed reactor contracts had been put on hold to prevent unnecessary spending

=== Wind down in 2010 ===
In February 2010 the South Africa government announced it had stopped funding the development of the pebble bed modular reactor, and PBMR (Pty) stated it was considering 75% cuts in staff. The decision was taken because no customer or investor for PBMR was found. Unresolved technical items, a substantial increase of costs and a 2008 report from Forschungszentrum Jülich about major problems in operation of the German pebble bed reactor AVR had discouraged potential investors. International banks refused to support the PBMR project by loans. PBMR&#x27;s CEO resigned on March, 8th 2010.

In May 2010 Westinghouse withdrew from the PBMR consortium, which led to an end of the South African engagement in NGNP.

On 25 May 2010 the company announced to staff that it intends to implement a &quot;Care and Maintenance&quot; Strategy. This involves the reduction of staff to 9. The stated purpose of the proposed structure is; preserve PBMR as a legal entity, preserve and optimise IP, preserve HTR license, preserve assets and solicit new investors. The strategy assumes that keeping on 9 employees in the medium term will leave sufficient funding to take PBMR to March 2013. The remaining employees will serve to end of October 2010. Some funding is foreseen for dismantling of the PBMR fuel fabrication laboratories in 2011.

In Sept 2010 the SA govt announced that in future, the South African nuclear program will concentrate on conventional light water reactors.

The NGNP project will continue on HTGRs with prismatic fuel elements, not with pebbles as in PBMR, as was announced in February 2012.

R9.244 billion (US$1.3 billion) had been invested in the PBMR project. Over 80% came from the South African government, with smaller amounts from Eskom (8.8%), Westinghouse (4.9%), Industrial Development Corporation (4.9%) and Exelon (1.1%).

== Legacy ==

=== X-energy ===

About a dozen employees at PBMR later joined X-energy, including:

* Eben Mulder, Chief Scientific Officer at PBMR, as Senior Vice President and Chief Scientist at X-energy.
* Martin van Staden, Chief Technical Officer and Director at PBMR, as Senior Vice President and responsible for the technical design of the Xe-100 reactor.
* Theo Odendaal as the Director of Environmental Safety &amp; Health at X-energy.

Other employees joined the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation.

=== Stratek Global ===
A Pretoria-based South African company created a variant of the PBMR reactor. The differences in the two reactors are the Stratek HTMR-100 reactor functions at a lower temperature (from 940°C to 750°C), the HTMR-100 reactor directs the heat into water to create steam in addition to being helium-cooled. The HTMR-100 reactor is also smaller, with an output of 35 MWe.

<doc id="594636" wikidata="Q99691" url="?curid=594636" title="U1 (Berlin U-Bahn)">
<text>U1 is a line on the Berlin U-Bahn, which is long and has 13 stations. Its traditional line designation was BII. It runs east–west and its eastern terminus is Warschauer Straße S-Bahn station where it connects to the Schlesische Bahn. From there it runs through Kreuzberg via Gleisdreieck and Wittenbergplatz on to the Kurfürstendamm.

The eastern section of the line is the oldest part of the Berlin U-Bahn, although it is largely above ground.

== Nomenclature ==
The U1 route was originally part of BII until 1957, where it was renamed to BIV until 1 March 1966. While the main section between Wittenbergplatz and Schlesisches Tor has been designated as line 1 since 1966, the western end of the line has changed twice. It was consequently renumbered to Line &quot;3&quot; and &quot;U3&quot; in 1993, before being renamed U15 until 2004.

== History ==
The increasing traffic problems in Berlin at the end of the 19th century led to a search for new efficient means of transport. Inspired by Werner von Siemens, numerous suggestions were made for overhead conveyors, such as a suspension railway, as was later built in Wuppertal, or a tube railway as was built in London. Finally Siemens and some prominent Berliners submitted a plan for an elevated railway on the model of New York. These people opposed Siemens&#x27; suggestion of building an overhead railway in the major street of Friedrichstrasse, but the city of Berlin opposed underground railways, since it feared damage to one of its new sewers. 

Finally, after many years and negotiations, Siemens proposal for an elevated railway line from &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot; via Hallesches Tor to Bülowstraße was approved. This was only possible, however, because it passed through poor areas. The richer residents of &quot;Leipziger Straße&quot; pressed the city administration to prevent the line using their street. Siemens &amp; Halske carried out all construction work and also owned the line. The first sod was turned on 10 September 1896 in &quot;Gitschiner Straße&quot;. The construction work had to be carried out quickly because the contract with the city of Berlin, signed with the granting of the concession, specified that the line had to be finished within two years, or a penalty of 50,000 marks would be payable.

The railway engineers developed a design for the supporting columns for the elevated railway, but it was unpopular and the architect Alfred Grenander was asked to submit an artistic solution for this problem. For the next 30 years Grenander was the house architect for the elevated and underground railway.

After tough negotiations with the city of Charlottenburg it was decided to extend the line to &quot;Knie&quot; along the Tauentzienstrasse, but instead of being elevated it would be a subsurface (cut-and-cover) railway. The management of the city of Berlin board of works regarded the idea of an underground railway sympathetically. Since the underground caused no apparent damage to the new sewer, an underground branch could be built from a junction at Gleisdreieck (German for &quot;rail triangle&quot;) to Potsdamer Platz, Berlin&#x27;s then city centre. The national government granted permission for the planning changes on 1 November 1900.
The total length of the elevated and underground railway was now . The largest part of the route, approximately , would be established on viaducts and connect eleven elevated stations. In addition there would be of underground line with three underground stations. The planners believed that 8-carriage trains would not be needed and therefore designed it with -long platforms, sufficient only for 6-carriage trains.

The first of the line was finished in 1901 and on 15 February 1902 the first train ran on the line from &quot;Potsdamer Platz&quot; to Zoologischer Garten, then to &quot;Stralauer Tor&quot; and back to &quot;Potsdamer Platz&quot;. This allowed many prominent Berliners to participate in the opening trip, including the Prussian minister for public works, Karl von Thielen. On 18 February 1902 the first stage of the Berlin U-Bahn was officially opened (&quot;Stralauer Tor&quot;–&quot;Potsdamer Platz&quot;). In March the line was extended to &quot;Zoologischer Garten&quot; and on 17 August it was extended by from &quot;Stralauer Tor&quot; to &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot;. There were at that time only two lines: 
*From &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot; to &quot;Zoologischer Garten&quot; via &quot;Potsdamer Platz&quot; (with reversal).
*From &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot; directly to &quot;Zoologischer Garten&quot;.

On 14 December the line was extended to &quot;Knie&quot;. The section between &quot;Gleisdreieck&quot; and &quot;Knie&quot; (now Ernst-Reuter-Platz) is now part of U2.

=== U-Bahn to Dahlem and the branch to Uhlandstraße ===
In the summer of 1907, the elevated railway company of the new city of Wilmersdorf suggested the building of an underground line to the Wilmersdorf area. It suggested a line to &quot;Nürnberger Platz&quot; and, if Wilmersdorf would pay for it, to &quot;Breitenbachplatz&quot;. Since Wilmersdorf municipality had poor transport connections, the Wilmersdorf city fathers were pleased to take up this suggestion. The royal domain of Dahlem, which was south of Wilmersdorf and was still undeveloped, also supported a U-bahn connection and wanted it extended from &quot;Breitenbachplatz&quot; to Thielplatz.

However, the future line would run partly through the city of Charlottenburg, which saw the city of Wilmersdorf as a major competitor for the settlement of wealthy ratepayers. Long negotiations ensued, until finally in the summer 1910 a solution was found: an additional line would be built under the Kurfürstendamm to Uhlandstraße. Work began on these lines in the same summer.
The double-track &quot;Wittenbergplatz&quot; station, which only had two side platforms, had to be completely rebuilt. The new station required five platforms with a sixth prepared for development and an entrance hall. The cities of Wilmersdorf and Charlottenburg submitted many suggestions for its design. Finally the house architect of the elevated railway company, Alfred Grenander, was appointed to design the station on the recommendation of the royal police chief.

The additional line to &quot;Uhlandstraße&quot; branched at &quot;Wittenbergplatz&quot; and had no intervening stations, but it was intended to be extended to Halensee. Nevertheless, the only addition to the line has been the building in 1961 of the &quot;Kurfürstendamm&quot; interchange station with the U9. It is still planned to extend the line to the west and preparations were made for it in the building of Internationales Congress Centrum on &quot;Neuen Kantstraße&quot;. In addition provisions have been made for a U1 station under the U7 station at Adenauerplatz.

After a relatively short construction period the &quot;Kurfürstendamm line&quot;, as it was called, was opened together with the &quot;Dahlem line&quot; on 12 October 1913. The length of the additional lines totaled about . These were the last sections of the Berlin U-Bahn built before World War I.

=== The new Gleisdreieck ===
One of the most dangerous places of the entire U-Bahn network was found at the triangular rail junction at Gleisdreieck, which connected the main route between &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot; and &quot;Zoologischer Garten&quot; with the branch line to &quot;Potsdamer Platz&quot;. This branch was protected only by signals, so that train-driver inattention could easily lead to a disaster, as happened on 26 September 1908. A U-Bahn train ran into the side of another train, forcing two carriages off the track. One carriage fell over the viaduct and 21 passengers died. As a result, it was decided to change the configuration at &quot;Gleisdreieck&quot;.

Construction began in May 1912 to replace the rail triangle with two lines built as a grade-separated cross with a new &quot;Gleisdreieck&quot; interchange station at the intersection. These lines now form part of U1 and U2. The new works were carried out largely with full services operating, although services were briefly interrupted on each line. On 3 November 1912 the new &quot;Gleisdreieck&quot; station was opened but construction was not completed until August 1913. The connecting track from the &quot;Pankow&quot; direction to the &quot;Warschauer Straße&quot; direction continued to operate until the completion of works for construction supply vehicles.

===Last small profile U-Bahn opened===
The small profile network was only slightly extended during the Weimar Republic. The new arrangement at &quot;Gleisdreieck&quot; was completed. The additional line created by the conversion of the three way junction to a cross at &quot;Gleisdreieck&quot; was extended under &quot;Kurfürstenstraße&quot; to Nollendorfplatz and was opened on 24 October 1926 together with the rebuilt &quot;Nollendorfplatz&quot; station. The basic fit-out of the &quot;Kurfürstenstraße&quot; station bears witness to the difficult financial times. As part of this work, the &quot;Nollendorfplatz&quot; station was completely rebuilt to incorporate the &quot;Schöneberg&quot; line (now U4), which had continued to be independently operated after its take over by the city of Berlin in 1920. The new &quot;Nollendorfplatz&quot; station has two underground platforms, one below the other and looking identical. The &quot;Schöneberg&quot; line ends on the higher level across the platform from trains coming from &quot;Wittenbergplatz&quot;. Trains run from the lower level to &quot;Schöneberg&quot; and &quot;Wittenbergplatz&quot;, also allowing cross-platform transfers. The elevated station of today&#x27;s U2 remained completely unchanged. Its impressive dome was destroyed in World War II and a simplified dome was only re-established on the U-Bahn&#x27;s 100-year anniversary in 2002.

=== Kurfürstendamm station ===
The new Berlin sector administration in West Berlin focussed on the reconstruction of buses and trams starting in the late 1940s. It also recognised that the densely populated districts of Steglitz, Wedding and Reinickendorf needed a rail connection to the then redeveloping centre around Zoologischer Garten. This could not be achieved however with line extensions and a new line was necessary. Therefore, a proposal was made to build line &quot;G&quot; (now U9) from central Wedding, near Osloer Straße, through Moabit, the centre of West Berlin, near Zoo and Kurfürstendamm, the &quot;Bundesallee&quot; and the &quot;Schloßstraße&quot; to Rathaus Steglitz. This line was the third north-south line, after lines &quot;C&quot; (U6) and &quot;D&quot; (U8).

In addition, a new station would be built at the intersection of the newly-built line with the then U3 (now U1). Instead of building the station with services operating, the “stub line” was simply shut down so that the rail interchange could be built under the crossing of &quot;Joachimstaler Straße&quot; and &quot;Kurfürstendamm&quot;. Line &quot;G&quot; was due to be opened on 2 September 1961, but on 13 August the GDR government commenced building the Berlin Wall, making the line even more important. Therefore, the opening date was brought forward to 28 August.

=== Fall of the wall and reunification of the networks ===

After the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 and German reunification on 3 October 1990, it was also necessary to combine the two U-Bahn networks of the east and west again. When line &quot;U2&quot; started running through in 1993, line &quot;U1&quot; still ended at &quot;Schlesisches Tor&quot; station, where it had terminated since August 1961.

The first reconstruction work on the line began in 1992. Numerous repairs had to be made and new buildings were necessary because some station buildings had been demolished during the GDR era. The Oberbaumbrücke was also in a very run-down condition. The Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava drew up the plans for rebuilding the bridge. The station with its three platforms, the old signal tower, and the carriage shed in &quot;Rudolfstrasse&quot; all required repairs. After construction was completed, the first train ran on 14 October 1995 to Warschauer Straße (formerly called &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot;, but renamed after the nearby S-Bahn station). There are plans for the U-Bahn station to be moved closer to the S-Bahn station, but due to financial constraints, this would not happen before at least 2015.

=== Planning ===

In the east, an extension to the northeast to Frankfurter Tor (U5) has been planned since the 1920s, via Kopernikusstraße, but is not likely to be implemented for some time. It may have potential extensions to Forckenbeckplatz and Storkower Straße, whereas another extension is also underway to Hausburgstraße and Landsberger Allee. The Berlin U-Bahn 2014 Plans has been revived to allow the U1 to be extended to Ostkreuz, which increases the significance of Ostkreuz being a transit hub.

In the west, there are long-term plans to extend the line to Westkreuz via Schlüterstraße and Adenauerplatz (U7) and a new station at Kracauer Platz, instead of continuing the line to Halensee. The advantage would be the connection to the Ring- and Stadtbahn, whereas in Halensee, only the Ringbahn would connect. A line to Halensee could replace several bus lines. Westkreuz is almost only a station to change trains, as there is very limited passenger potential in the vicinity. While older plans for a continuation to Theodor-Heuss-Platz would create a line with above average passenger numbers, costs might be prohibitive compared to smaller and shorter alternatives.

== Opening dates ==
* 18 February 1902: Stralauer Tor ↔ Gleisdreieck
* 12 August 1902: Warschauer Brücke ↔ Stralauer Tor
* 3 November 1912: Gleisdreieck Station
* 12 October 1913: Wittenbergplatz ↔ Uhlandstraße
* 24 October 1926: Gleisdreieck ↔ Wittenbergplatz
* 28 August 1961: Kurfürstendamm Station

The &quot;Osthafen&quot; station, originally called &quot;Stralauer Tor&quot;, lay between &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot; and &quot;Schlesisches Tor&quot;. Due to its proximity to &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot; it was not rebuilt after the Second World War.

== In popular culture ==

The Pet Shop Boys track &quot;Will-o&#x27;-the-wisp&quot; is structured around a reference to U1, which it refers to by name along with four of its stations. The allusion is to the line&#x27;s status as &quot;a party train,&quot; serving areas known for gay nightlife.

<text>U2 is a line of the Berlin U-Bahn. The U2 line starts at Pankow S-Bahn station, runs through the eastern city centre (Alexanderplatz) to Potsdamer Platz, the western city centre (Wittenbergplatz, Zoologischer Garten, Theodor-Heuss Platz) and finally to the Ruhleben terminal station.

The U2 has 29 stations and a length of . Together with the U1, U3, and U4 lines, it was part of the early Berlin U-Bahn network built before 1914. The line between Potsdamer Platz and Zoologischer Garten was the western section of the &quot;stem line&quot; (&quot;Stammstrecke&quot;), Berlin&#x27;s first U-Bahn line opened in 1902.

==Overview==

The line starts to the west of central Berlin at Ruhleben and runs on an embankment between Rominter Allee and the railway to Spandau (also called the &quot;Olympic&quot; or &quot;Grunewald&quot; railway). On the bend approaching Olympischen Straße, the line descends into tunnel to run beneath that road from Neu-Westend to Wittenbergplatz. Subsequently, the U2 swings onto Reichsstrasse to Theodor-Heuss-Platz, where it runs in a curve to Kaiserdamm. Under Kaiserdamm, which becomes Bismarckstraße at Sophie Charlotte-Platz, the tunnel runs straight to Ernst-Reuter-Platz. Here again, it swings to the southeast, following the course of Hardenberger Straße towards Zoologischer Garten station. In the tunnel, it passes the foundations of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church on a tight arc and then follows Tauentzienstraße to Wittenbergplatz where the line emerges to an elevated section via a ramp east of the Kleiststraße/Courbierestraße intersection.

The elevated railway reaches its full height at Nollendorfplatz station where all four lines of the small-profile network meet. The underground part of the station has four tracks. The U2 continues above ground to the east of Bülowstraße. After that the U2 makes a curve over a long viaduct at the southernmost point of the line, passes through Gleisdreieck station and then runs straight across the Landwehr Canal and returns underground between Mendelssohn Bartholdy-Park and Potsdamer Platz stations.

While the elevated railway company intended to continue the line along Leipziger Straße, it was not permitted to build this route and instead it continues instead along Mohrenstraße, Markgrafenstraße and Niederwallstraße to the River Spree in Berlin Mitte. After passing Märkisches Museum station, it goes under the River Spree in a tunnel, and runs through Klosterstraße to Alexanderplatz station.

After leaving Alexanderplatz, the line turns under Rosa-Luxemburg-Straße and through Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz station. The line then runs north underneath Schönhauser Allee and through Senefelderplatz station. Before reaching Eberswalder Straße station, the line emerges from tunnel and on to an elevated viaduct through to Schönhauser Allee station, an interchange with the S-Bahn. From there the line runs beyond the former city limits and the elevated railway descends again into a tunnel to Vinetastraße before reaching the terminus at Pankow.

== Route numbering ==

Since the introduction of the schematic line network plans at the Berlin subway, at least parts of today&#x27;s line U2 always had the colour red. When letters were introduced as a line name after the First World War, the small profile network received the letters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. The inner city route, more important than the older route through Kreuzberg, became line A, as did the two western branches to Charlottenburg and Dahlem (today&#x27;s U2 and U3 lines). The routes from Kurfürstendamm and Schöneberg through Kreuzberg to Warschauer Straße (today: U1 and U4) were given the letter &quot;B&quot; and the colour code green. To distinguish the branches in the western part of the line, the letters were supplemented by Roman numbers, the Charlottenburg route was thus the line AI.

From 1966, the designation of the lines operated by the Berlin public transport companies (BVG West / BVG) in West Berlin was converted to Arabic numbers. Each line was now operated independently and without branching. The (&quot;green&quot;) line 1 now ran from Ruhleben through Charlottenburg to Kreuzberg, while the previous AII became the (&quot;red&quot;) line 2 (Krumme Lanke – Gleisdreieck, from 1972 only to Wittenbergplatz). The severed eastern line section, used since 1949 by the BVG East / BVB, retained the &quot;A&quot; line designation unchanged, as well as the red colour code.

On 9 January 1984, the BVG also took over the S-Bahn lines in West Berlin previously managed by Deutsche Reichsbahn. The marking of the U-Bahn lines operated by the BVG changed again because the U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines were now operated in parallel. To better distinguish the two networks, the respective Arabic numbers, which had been used since 1966, were prefixed with the letter &quot;U&quot; to provide a line number. According to the model of public transport networks, which were used in various cities (Frankfurt, Shanghai, Munich, Beijing, Guangzhou) they were then designated as U1 to U9 and similarly the acquired S-Bahn routes were preceded by &quot;S&quot;.

With the merging of Berlin in the context of German reunification and the reconstruction of the disused Wittenbergplatz–Mohrenstraße section in 1993, the BVG decided to swap the western branches of lines U1 and U2, which meet at Wittenbergplatz. The reunited former AI line has since been operated under the new name &quot;U2&quot;, but using the traditional red line colour as previously used in the separate parts of the city.

== History ==

The increasing traffic problems in Berlin at the end of the 19th century led to a search for new efficient means of transport. Inspired by Werner von Siemens, numerous suggestions were made for overhead conveyors, such as a suspension railway, as was later built in Wuppertal, or a tube railway as was built in London. Finally Siemens and some prominent Berliners submitted a plan for an elevated railway on the model of New York. These people opposed Siemens&#x27; suggestion of building an overhead railway in the major street of Friedrichstraße, but the city of Berlin opposed underground railways, since it feared damage to one of its new sewers.

Finally, after many years and negotiations, Siemens proposal for an elevated railway line from &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot; via Hallesches Tor to Bülowstraße was approved. This was only possible, however, because it passed through poor areas. The richer residents of &quot;Leipziger Straße&quot; pressed the city administration to prevent the line using their street. Siemens &amp; Halske carried out all construction work and also owned the line. The first sod was turned on 10 September 1896 in &quot;Gitschiner Straße&quot;. The construction work had to be carried out quickly because the contract with the city of Berlin, signed with the granting of the concession, specified that the line had to be finished within two years, or a penalty of 50,000 marks would be payable.

The railway engineers developed a design for the supporting columns for the elevated railway, but it was unpopular and the architect Alfred Grenander was asked to submit an artistic solution for this problem. For the next 30 years Grenander was the house architect for the elevated and underground railway.

After tough negotiations with the city of Charlottenburg it was decided to extend the line to &quot;Knie&quot; along the Tauentzienstraße, but instead of being elevated it would be a subsurface (cut-and-cover) railway. The management of the city of Berlin board of works regarded the idea of an underground railway sympathetically. Since the underground caused no apparent damage to the new sewer, an underground branch could be built from a junction at Gleisdreieck (German for &quot;rail triangle&quot;) to Potsdamer Platz, Berlin&#x27;s then city centre. The national government granted permission for the planning changes on 1 November 1900.

The total length of the elevated and underground railway was now . The largest part of the route, approximately , would be established on viaducts and connect eleven elevated stations. In addition there would be of underground line with three underground stations. The planners believed that 8-carriage trains would not be needed and therefore designed it with -long platforms, sufficient only for 6-carriage trains.

The first of the line was finished in 1901 and on 15 February 1902 the first train ran on the line from &quot;Potsdamer Platz&quot; to Zoologischer Garten, then to &quot;Stralauer Tor&quot; and back to &quot;Potsdamer Platz&quot;. This allowed many prominent Berliners to participate in the opening trip, including the Prussian minister for public works, Karl von Thielen. On 18 February 1902 the first stage of the Berlin U-Bahn was officially opened (&quot;Stralauer Tor&quot;–&quot;Potsdamer Platz&quot;). In March the line was extended to &quot;Zoologischer Garten&quot; and on 17 August it was extended by from &quot;Stralauer Tor&quot; to &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot;. There were at that time only two lines: 
*From &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot; to &quot;Zoologischer Garten&quot; via &quot;Potsdamer Platz&quot; (with reversal).
*From &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot; directly to &quot;Zoologischer Garten&quot;.

On 14 December the line was extended to &quot;Knie&quot;. The section between &quot;Gleisdreieck&quot; and &quot;Knie&quot; (now Ernst-Reuter-Platz) is now part of U2.

=== Charlottenburg extension ===
After the opening of the original route further plans to extend the three route branches emerged: via Charlottenburg city to Wilhelmplatz (now Richard-Wagner-Platz) and towards Reichskanzlerplatz (now Theodor-Heuss Platz), from Potsdamer Platz to the centre of Berlin and via Warschauer Straße to Frankfurter Tor The fastest route negotiations were completed with the young and coming city of Charlottenburg because there was a lot of vacant land that could be developed. The most important negotiating point was to build a route via Charlottenburg Town Hall in Wilhelmsplatz. Here an extension along Berliner Straße (now Otto-Suhr-Allee) would have served, but this was served at the time by the and a parallel line did not seem sensible. Therefore, this line would continue under Bismarckstraße to the west and then curve to the town hall. Under the working title of &quot;Krumme Straße&quot;, the line was initially planned with a station at Bismarckstraße (now Deutsche Oper) and a terminus at Wilhelmplatz. The line was opened between Knie and Wilhelmplatz on 14 May 1906. Both U-Bahn lines now ran to Bismarckstraße, but only the branch to Potsdamer Platz also ran to Wilhelmsplatz.

While this line was under construction, the railway company and the city of Charlottenburg agreed on a branch towards Westend. Therefore, a planning amendment was necessary at the planned station at Bismarckstraße, because the line to Westend would branch there. Therefore, the station was built as the first four-track U-Bahn station in Germany. The two inner tracks would be used for the line to Wilhelmsplatz and the outer tracks for the line to Westend.

Since the western Charlottenburg area was still completely undeveloped, the line would not generate any profits in its early years. Therefore, the elevated railway company negotiated with the city of Charlottenburg and the other property owners to compensate for the line&#x27;s deficit. This contract was signed on 23 June 1906.

For the line westwards through Charlottenburg, the following stations were to be built:
* Bismarckstraße (today&#x27;s: Deutsche Oper)
* Sophie-Charlotte-Platz
* Kaiserdamm
* Reichskanzlerplatz (now Theodor-Heuss-Platz, the terminus)

On 16 March 1908, the Emperor Wilhelm II, opened the line, following the &quot;ministerial trip&quot;, the first service on the line. It was officially inaugurated on 29 March 1908. The two existing lines did not continue to Reichskanzlerplatz; instead, a third line was established, operating only between Bismarckstraße and Reichskanzlerplatz.
Because of the greatly extended length of the line, a new workshop was desirable as the previous workshop in Rudolfstraße (or Warschauer Brücke) was now no longer adequate. Therefore, the elevated railway company sought a suitable site. Since the Prussian forest administration wanted to market its site of the Grunewald profitably, the interests of both partners were met. The railway company bought only of land to build its new operations workshop. At the same time, it undertook, to build an extension of the line to a station at the stadium (now Olympia-Stadion). The elevated railway company received a grant from the Forestry Administration of 200,000 marks to support this project. Services would only be operated there on special occasions. The shell of Neu-Westend station was built with the extension to the stadium station, as there was insufficient traffic to justify completing the station at that time. The new extension was completed on 8 June 1913. The nearby Unterspreewald power station on Wiesendamm in Ruhleben, which was built for the U-Bahn power supply, had already started operation in 1911.

=== The central line ===

After the so-called &quot;stem line&quot; had been extended to &quot;Wilhelmplatz&quot; (now Richard-Wagner-Platz) in Charlottenburg, the elevated railway company planned to connect the Berlin city centre to the new U-Bahn. The city of Berlin, however, prohibited this because, given the success of the first line, it had made its own plans for the construction of a metro. But the highest decision-maker, the Berlin Police chief, intervened and approved the plans.

The elevated railway company planned to run the new line in a straight line under Leipziger Straße from Potsdamer Platz to Spittelmarkt. The &quot;Große Berliner Straßenbahn&quot; (Greater Berlin tramway company), which operated a line along this street, prevented the realisation of these plans by threatening claims for damages, with the support of city of Berlin.
The negotiating partners finally agreed to a long-term route through Spittelmarkt, Alexanderplatz and Schönhauser Allee to Nordring station. The plans initially included the stations of &quot;Kaiserhof&quot; (now Mohrenstraße), &quot;Friedrichstraße&quot; (now Stadtmitte), Hausvogteiplatz and Spittelmarkt. The line was later to continue via the following stations: &quot;Inselbrücke&quot; (now Märkisches Museum), Klosterstraße, Alexanderplatz, &quot;Schönhauser Tor&quot; (now Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz), Senefelderplatz, &quot;Danziger Straße&quot; (now Eberswalder Straße, an elevated station) and &quot;Nordring&quot; (now Schönhauser Allee, an elevated station).
As the section of the line through Spittelmarkt would be very complex and expensive due to the need to tunnel under the Spree, the plans provided for a (cheaper) elevated line in Schönhauser Allee as compensation. Construction began on 15 December 1905. Potsdamer Platz station, which then had side platforms, was demolished to enable the extension. The new &quot;Leipziger Platz&quot; (now Potsdamer Platz) station was opened away on 28 September 1907.
Spittelmarkt station was built under Spittelmarkt square in 1908. This lies directly next to the Spree, so the subsoil is very wet. Piled foundations were necessary to prevent the station subsiding. A windowed gallery was built on the Spree. It was closed in the Second World War and only reopened in 2004.
The &quot;Spittelmarkt line&quot; was officially opened on 1 October 1908. There were now four different services on the U-Bahn network, two of which used the new line:
* Warschauer Brücke – Potsdamer Platz – Spittelmarkt, and
* &quot;Wilhelmplatz&quot; (Charlottenburg) – Wittenbergplatz – Potsdamer Platz – Spittelmarkt.

=== Construction of elevated line in Schönhauser Allee ===
In March 1910, construction began on the extension of the &quot;Spittelmarkt line&quot; (now also called the &quot;Centrumslinie&quot;—central line) to the north. There were also some challenges here. After the Spittelmarkt station, the line runs along the banks of the Spree. Therefore, a ramp had to be built to pass under the river bed. &quot;Inselbrücke&quot; (&quot;island bridge&quot;, now Märkisches Museum) station was built there at a depth of about six and a half metres. Because the station was so deep, it was built with an impressively high barrel vault that covers the platform, which is rare in Berlin. It and Platz der Luftbrücke station are the only column-free U-Bahn stations in Berlin.
Beyond this station, the line crossed under the Spree and swung under Klosterstraße, where the station of the same name was located. Since there were plans at the time to build a branch line under Frankfurter Allee, space was left in the middle of the platform area for another track. Today a line runs on a similar route from Alexanderplatz to Frankfurter Allee. The Central line continued from Klosterstrasse to Alexanderplatz. During the building of Alexanderplatz station, care was taken to ensure that stairs to other lines could later be added. The line between Spittelmarkt and Alexanderplatz was opened on 1 July 1913. The line between Alexanderplatz and &quot;Wilhelmplatz&quot; quickly became the most used U-Bahn line.
This extension ran to Schönhauser Allee. &quot;Schönhauser Tor&quot; station (now Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz) was the first station under today&#x27;s Torstraße. Since Schönhauser Allee was wide enough, there were no problems with the construction of the tunnel.
The next station was as Senefelderplatz. Beyond this, a ramp emerges from the tunnel and runs to the former &quot;Danziger Straße&quot; station (now Eberswalder Straße). As mentioned, this was built as an elevated railway, because the tunnel section at Spittelmarkt was very cost-intensive and the construction of the elevated railway on the broad Schönhauser Allee was very cheap.
After Danziger Straße station there was a longer elevated viaduct to the former &quot;Nordring&quot; station (now &quot;Schönhauser Allee&quot;). There, the existing Ringbahn was crossed, not underground, but on an even higher level. The S-Bahn now runs in a cutting there. This was the terminus of the line. The extension from Alexanderplatz to Nordring was opened just three and a half weeks after the line to Alexanderplatz was opened on 27 July 1913.

=== The new Gleisdreieck ===

One of the most dangerous places of the entire U-Bahn network was found at the triangular rail junction at Gleisdreieck, which connected the main line between &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot; and &quot;Zoologischer Garten&quot; with the branch line to &quot;Potsdamer Platz&quot;. This branch was protected only by signals, so that driver inattention could easily lead to a disaster, as happened on 26 September 1908. A U-Bahn train ran into the side of another train, forcing two carriages off the track. One carriage fell over the viaduct and 21 passengers died. As a result, it was decided to change the configuration at &quot;Gleisdreieck&quot;.

Construction began in May 1912 to replace the triangular junction with two lines built as a grade-separated cross with a new &quot;Gleisdreieck&quot; interchange station at the intersection. These lines now form part of U1 and U2. The new work was carried out largely with full services operating, although services were briefly interrupted on each line. On 3 November 1912, the new &quot;Gleisdreieck&quot; station was opened but construction was not completed until August 1913. The connecting track from the &quot;Pankow&quot; direction to the &quot;Warschauer Straße&quot; direction continued to be open until the completion of work for use by construction supply trains.

=== Two new termini===
 
The small profile network was only slightly expanded during the Weimar Republic. There has been regular train traffic to &quot;Stadion&quot; since 1913 and Neu-Westend station, which was already partly built at that time, was finally opened on 22 May 1922.
The new Gleisdreieck station was also completed to form a cross; the &quot;relief line&quot; from Gleisdreieck via Kurfürstenstraße to Nollendorfplatz was opened on 24 October 1926. The austere Kurfürstenstraße station testifies to the difficult financial situation of that time. Nollendorfplatz station was also completely rebuilt and rearranged as part of the construction of the relief line, since the U-Bahn of the formerly independent city of Schöneberg (today&#x27;s line U4) was still operated independently, although it was now part of the City of Berlin.
The former “stem line” from &quot;Nordring&quot; to &quot;Stadion&quot; was extended by one station in each direction. Pankow station (now Vinetastraße) was built in 1930 to its north. There was one main reason for its construction: trains ran so often to &quot;Nordring&quot; station that it was not possible to reverse them on the viaduct. It was much easier to provide a reversing facility underground. A further planned extension to Breiten Straße in Pankow or to Pankow S-Bahn station was not built at that time and construction did not recommence until 1997. At the opposite end, the line was extended by one stop to the new terminus of Ruhleben on 22 December 1929. This line ran on an embankment. An extension through a garden and industrial area to nearby Spandau was planned to start a little later. However, the Great Depression and the Second World War prevented these plans from being carried out and the 1929 extension remains the western end of the U2.

=== Nazism and the Second World War ===
After the seizure of power of the Nazis two stations on line AI were renamed after people highly regarded by the Nazi party. &quot;Reichskanzlerplatz&quot; station (now Theodor-Heuss-Platz) was renamed &quot;Adolf-Hitler-Platz&quot; on 24 April 1933. &quot;Schönhauser Tor&quot; station (now Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz) was renamed after SA (&quot;Brownshirts&quot;) &quot;Sturmführer&quot; (lieutenant) Horst Wessel on 1 May 1934.
Under the plans to transform Berlin into &quot;Germania&quot; in 1939, the route of line A at that time would have changed relatively little compared to other plans of the time. In addition to the northern extension to &quot;Pankow&quot;, referred to in the plans as &quot;Pankow (Breite Straße)&quot;, which had been planned for years, the elevated line at Gleisdreieck was to be dismantled and replaced by a new, underground and direct route to Bülowstraße. The proposals for an extension to Spandau that were made in previous and later plans were not incorporated. The proposed lines FI and FIII served this purpose. The first tunnel work started at what is now Theodor-Heuss-Platz, but was stopped in 1941. It was intended that work would resume after the predicted &quot;final victory&quot;.
After the war began on 1 September 1939, the order was given to all modes of transport to only run with darkened headlights. This affected not only the trains, but also to the S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations—only a few lights were left on.

In the autumn of 1943, when the Allied bombing of Berlin increased sharply, many people took refuge in U-Bahn stations. The official regulations stated that at the sound of an air raid siren, all U-Bahn stations were to be closed, however this rarely happened and many people mistakenly believed that they were protected from air raids. For example, the entrance to Senefelderplatz station collapsed as a result of a bomb during the raids that occurred on November 3 and 4 in 1943. In 1944, as the air raids continued, the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe had trouble keeping the U2 line in operation, as many stations were affected such as Gleisdreieck, Nollendorfplatz, Olympiastadion, Potsdamer Platz, and Klosterstraße.

In 1945, the situation deteriorated further and the U-Bahn operated only as a shuttle between some stations. The entire U-Bahn came to a standstill on 25 April 1945.

Shortly before the end of the Battle of Berlin on 2 May 1945, SS troops blew up the North-South tunnel of the S-Bahn at the Landwehr Canal, which in addition to flooding the S-Bahn tunnel also caused water to flow through connecting passages into the U-Bahn network. Line AI was completely under water between Alexanderplatz and Potsdamer Platz stations and it took a long time to repair the damage.

=== New beginning after the war ===
The repair of the U-Bahn network began after the German surrender. On 14 May 1945, the first trains had already begun running in the area around Hermannplatz. The first shuttle trains were able to run on line AI on the section of line between &quot;Knie&quot; and Kaiserdamm as well as between Kaiserdamm and Ruhleben on 17 May. The stations renamed Reichskanzlerplatz and Schönhauser Tor during Nazi Germany were returned to their original names. In the following months, further sections were reopened on 18 September trains on line AI between Pankow and Potsdamer Platz and between Gleisdreieck and Ruhleben, while the section between Potsdamer Platz and Gleisdreieck was operated in shuttle mode.

=== The division of the city and 17 June 1953 ===
The beginning of the Cold War and its first major escalation, the Berlin Blockade in 1948/1949, caused great uncertainty among Berliners. Many West Berliners avoided East Berlin. This created new traffic flows that bypassed the eastern sector. &quot;Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe&quot;, the operator of the U-Bahn, was split in 1949 into an eastern and a western company. While bus and tram lines now ended at the sector border, the U-Bahn continued to operate in both sectors.
Kaiserhof station was returned to operation under the name of &quot;Thälmannplatz&quot; on 18 August 1950, the sixth anniversary of Ernst Thälmann’s death. This made line AI fully operational again. The station in Wilhelmplatz in the heart of the government district was called after the Hotel Kaiserhof, because the name &quot;Wilhelmplatz&quot; had already been assigned to a U-Bahn station that had been built in Charlottenburg a few years earlier (now called Richard-Wagner-Platz). The wife and daughter of Thälmann, Rosa and Irma, attended the opening ceremony and the renaming of the square as &quot;Thälmannplatz&quot;. Since the government of East Germany mainly occupied offices in the old government district of Wilhelmstrasse, it wanted an impressive station. It is unique in Berlin because of its construction in Saalburg marble in the style of the 1950s. The East Berlin press described it as the most beautiful in Berlin.
At the beginning of 1953, the Western BVG installed loudspeakers at the last stations in the western sectors, warning of the crossing into the Soviet sector. Turnback facilities were set up at these stations to allow the trains to terminate there if necessary. In addition, the timetable was designed so that when a U-Bahn train ran east, another train ran west at the same time. As a result, the West would lose only a few U-Bahn sets to the East in the event of an incident.
This proved itself in June of the same year, when East Berlin workers responded with protests to an increase in the &quot;Arbeitsnorm&quot; (&quot;work norm&quot;: the quantity of work required to be performed in a shift). News of the 17 June 1953 uprising spread like wildfire across the GDR. About 20,000 strikers demonstrated not only against the norm increases, but also against the general conditions in the country. The BVG East stopped U-Bahn operations and Deutsche Reichsbahn stopped S-Bahn operations at the border at 11 am. The western trains now ended in the new turnback facilities. In total, the West Berlin BVG lost only 18 trains due to the well thought-out timetable. The northern section of line D, including the stations of Voltastraße and Gesundbrunnen, which had no connection to the rest of the West network, was closed.
The traffic situation returned to normal after a few days after the bloody suppression of the uprising. As a consequence of the experience of 17 June, the Western BVG established a new route of the AII from Krumme Lanke to Kottbusser Tor which was independent of East Berlin, but which was soon abandoned. In addition, the Schöneberg line now ran only as far as Nollendorfplatz, not as previously to Warschauer Brücke.

=== The construction of the Wall ===

The construction of the Berlin Wall to seal off the sector boundary between the two parts of Berlin resulted in line A also being split into two, as it crossed the city from east to west. On the orders of the then GDR Interior Minister Karl Maron, trains on the section of line A (now U2) in East Berlin terminated at Thälmannplatz station (now Mohrenstraße).

Lines C and D (now U6 and U8) of the West Berlin BVG were left alone, but the stations located in the eastern sector were closed (becoming ghost stations). Connections were not allowed from the eastern section of line A and lines C and D or at Stadtmitte and Alexanderplatz stations.

Maron had originally assumed that the West Berlin BVG would terminate their trains on the western section of line A at Potsdamer Platz, but in fact the trains were terminated one stop earlier, at Gleisdreieck. Tracks to allow trains to change direction here had been built in the early 1950s as a precaution. Therefore, the East Berlin BVG used the reversing tracks at Potsdamer Platz and occasionally even ran its trains into West Berlin.

The splitting of line A and the closure of those stations on lines C and D under East Berlin completed the split of the unified Berlin public transport network, as the trams and buses had not crossed the sector border since 1953. The Berlin S-Bahn ran throughout Berlin at the direction of the GDR-controlled Deutsche Reichsbahn and therefore never formed part of the unified public transport network.

One consequence of the 13 August 1961 crisis was that the S-Bahn was increasingly boycotted in West Berlin. Often the slogans chanted were, &quot;The S-Bahn driver pays for the barbed wire&quot; or &quot;No more pennies for Ulbricht&quot;. So West Berliners took the U-Bahn, the bus and—if still available—the tram.

=== Line A (U2) in East Berlin ===
The split of the U-Bahn network left only two lines under the direction of BVG-Ost. The first was the whole of line E (now U5) from Alexanderplatz to Friedrichsfelde, which was opened in 1930. The second line was the eastern part of the line A, mainly opened through the city centre and to Pankow in 1908–1913. Both these lines crossed in the center of East Berlin at Alexanderplatz, where there was a connection to the S-Bahn. The other two lines in the district centre were under the control of West BVG. The stations located in the Eastern sector were closed and bricked-up, treated as ghost stations. These stations were patrolled by GDR security forces to stop East Berliners escaping to the West via the U-Bahn.

The U-Bahn network played a less important role in East Berlin than in West Berlin. The focus in the East was more on the extensive S-Bahn and tram networks. In 58 years (1930–1987), only one new U-Bahn station (Tierpark) was built in the eastern part of the city, while the S-Bahn expanded and many new tram lines were built.

Plans were made to use the part of line C (now U6) on East Berlin territory and to extend line A through the city centre in a tunnel along the Friedrichstraße, but these were not put into action.

The stations of Stadtmitte, Hausvogteiplatz, Spittelmarkt, Rosa Luxemburg-Platz and Senefelderplatz were remodelled and given new wall tiles in the 1960s, all for show, as U6 ran through without stopping. In 1987, the stations of Markisches Museum and Klosterstraße were remodelled, as part of the rebuilding for the celebration of 750th anniversary of Berlin, with artistic representations of the urban development of historic buses and trams instead of advertising space that is typically found in non-socialist economic systems. Alexanderplatz station did not change and is still preserved almost in its original condition and Potsdamer Platz, which was unused for 32 years, also did not change.

===New Station: Bismarckstraße===
Due to the S-Bahn boycott and closure of the tram network, the U-Bahn was expanded in West-Berlin. However, this affected only the more modern large-profile network (today&#x27;s U6 to U9). Construction projects on the small-profile network were limited to the construction of new interchanges on new U-Bahn lines.

On the route of today&#x27;s U2, work of this nature was carried out in 1978 in Charlottenburg between the current stations of Deutsche Oper and Sophie-Charlotte-Platz.

During the construction of line 7, a line that connects several district centres with each other outside of the actual city centre, several existing lines were crossed. These included lines 4, 2 (now U3), and 1 (now U2). The intersection of lines 1 and 7 was in Bismarckstraße / Wilmersdorfer Straße, west of Deutsche Oper station. Despite the short distance between the sites, a new station was built to enable interchange.

Before the beginning of work on line 7 and Bismarckstraße station, the shuttle line from Deutsche Oper to Richard-Wagner-Platz (called &quot;line 5&quot; in the timetable) was closed. This connection was replaced by the new line 7.

As the already 70-year-old tunnel of Line 1 consisted only of weakly reinforced concrete, the BVG simply removed the existing tunnel and rebuilt it with a completely closed reinforced-concrete frame. After that the station was built as a multi-level structure, connecting to street level. The new line 7 platform was long and wide. In contrast, two uncomfortable side platforms, each of which was wide, were built for the small-profile line. To enable the construction of a central platform, the tracks would have had to be separated and the line closed for a long time. The new station was opened under the name of Bismarckstraße together with the extension of line 7 on 28 April 1978.

=== Temporary uses of the elevated line ===
==== Flea market, Turkish bazaar and museum tram ====
 
The line in West Berlin between Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz near the border with the East had been disused since the wall was built on 13 August 1961. The section between Wittenbergplatz and Gleisdreieck via Nollendorfplatz and Bülowstraße was rarely used because it was no longer possible to continue to East Berlin at the time. For economic reasons, operations on that section of line, then designated as line 2, were also discontinued on 1 January 1972. Subsequently, trains on line 2 from Krumme Lanke ended at Wittenbergplatz.
The unused elevated railway line through the north of Schöneberg was then used temporarily for several purposes. The tunnel from Wittenbergplatz towards Nollendorfplatz was used for reversing trains since there was no other way for trains on line 2 to reverse.
A flea market popularly known as the &quot;Nolle&quot; operated at the elevated station of Nollendorfplatz in 16 decommissioned U-Bahn cars from 1973. There was a new restaurant on the tracks operated by Heini Holl, which was called &quot;Zur Nolle&quot;.
An operation similar to Nollendorfplatz station was built at Bülowstraße—this was where the &quot;Berliner Jahrmarkt&quot; (funfair) began in 1975. Since this project was unsuccessful, it closed a year later. A new business concept started on 28 May 1978. The &quot;U-Tropia – Bahnhof der Nationen&quot; (station of nations) project was set up in two U-Bahn cars that were no longer required. The cars were equipped with toilets and many things were sold in the station itself.
In order to increase the attractiveness of the two markets, the BVG established a shuttle service of museum trams on the elevated railway in August 1978. But &quot;U-Tropia&quot; closed during the next winter. As no new project had been established at Bülowstraße station, the shuttle service closed. In September 1980, the &quot;Türkischer Basar&quot; (Turkish bazaar) project opened at Bülowstrasse station. This market was successful and continued until the elevated railway was reopened for U-Bahn traffic. The shuttle service on the elevated railway was discontinued on 28 February 1991.

==== Test track for automatic train operation ====
After installing Linienzugbeeinflussung (a cab signalling and train protection system) on the line U9, the SelTrac operating system of SEL was tested without passengers on part of the unused section of the elevated railway from 1977 to 1981. This made it possible to run at an absolute braking distance and thus allowed trains to run closer together. The tracks, excluding the section between the U-Bahn stations of Bülowstraße and Potsdamer Platz, which was being used for other purposes (markets and storage facilities), were equipped with inductive loops for this experiment. SelTrac equipment was installed on two small profile two-car sets. A system was installed with operations management, a dispatching centre, an operations centre, turnout controls and station facilities. The conductor loops were used to transfer movement authorities and other information, as well as location data. For this purpose, the maximum -long inductive loops intersected every .

==== The M-Bahn ====

U-Bahn services only operated on the upper platform of Gleisdreieck station used by line 1, while there were no passenger services on the lower level. At the request of the Senate of Berlin, the House of Representatives decided on 2 December 1980 to make available the section of the line that had been used in the automatic SelTrac test mode since 1977 to AEG for Maglev test operations. The Senate planned to convert the small profile network of the U-Bahn to magnetic levitation, but this raised considerable concerns in the BVG. Construction work on the new facilities began in December 1983. In addition to the lower platform of Gleisdreieck station, the stations of &quot;Bernburger Straße&quot; (roughly at the site of today&#x27;s Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park station) and &quot;Kemperplatz&quot; were established. The first measured trials on this -long line started a year later. On 19 December 1988, there was an accident at the terminal station of &quot;Kemperplatz&quot; due to an operating error with the control system when an unoccupied M-Bahn test train went beyond the end of the track, broke through a glass wall and got stuck above the ground.
The public was allowed to try out the M-Bahn, as it was called from then on, for free from 28 August 1989. The final approval for the M-Bahn to operate as a new passenger transport system was given by the technical supervisory authority on 18 July 1991. As a result, passengers had to pay the usual BVG tariff for an M-Bahn journey. Just two weeks later, the M-Bahn had to stop operating to make room for construction work to reopen the section of the U2 U-Bahn line that had been closed 30 years earlier. The facilities of the M-Bahn were dismantled and initially stored, as it was intended that they would later be reused for a connection to Schönefeld Airport. This idea was later discarded and the material scrapped. There are no remains of the line. An M-Bahn car is displayed at the Oldtimer Museum Rügen in Prora on an original piece of the line.

=== Fall of the wall and reunification of the networks ===
After the opening of the border on 9 November 1989, numerous temporary measures were taken to cope with the huge cross-border traffic. While S-Bahn services were quickly restored at Friedrichstraße station, it was not possible to reconnect line A quickly after it had been disrupted for 28 years.

However, the so-called &quot;ghost stations&quot; (closed stations, which were passed without stopping) on the U6 and U8 reopened, so interchange was enabled from East Berlin&#x27;s line A to West Berlin&#x27;s U6 and U8 at Stadtmitte and Alexanderplatz stations respectively.

On 1 July 1990, East Berlin&#x27;s lines A and E were integrated into the western numbering scheme of the BVG. Line A was given the line number &quot;U2&quot;. That led to a three-year-long curiosity, since the two U2s were not yet connected. Three months later, on 3 October 1990, the day of the reunification, the Berlin U-Bahn network was largely free of &quot;Communist &quot; station names, which were mostly replaced by politically neutral names. This involved renaming two stations on the U2 line: &quot;Dimitroffstraße&quot; to &quot;Eberswalder Straße&quot;, and &quot;Otto-Grotewohl-Straße&quot; to &quot;Mohrenstraße&quot;.

The new station name of &quot;Eberswalder Strasse&quot; resulted from a power struggle between the Senate and Prenzlauer Berg district: since the latter refused to rename the former Danziger Strasse, which was named after the Bulgarian Communist Party leader Georgi Dimitroff. The BVG, on the order of the senator responsible for transport matters, renamed the elevated station after the street opposite, even though Eberswalder Straße was much less significant. It has retained its name after Dimitroffstrasse was returned to its original name in 1995.

Against the resistance from the conservative side, however, one name was retained: since Rosa Luxemburg also has numerous streets and squares named after her in western Germany, it was not possible to rename &quot;Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz&quot; back to &quot;Schönhauser Tor&quot;.
In 1991, work began on rebuilding the missing link between the two parts of the U2, the section from Wittenbergplatz via Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz to Mohrenstrasse. This required some obstacles to be overcome and problems to be solved. The interim uses applied in the Schöneberg elevated stations described above had to be ended and the M-Bahn line had to be dismantled. In the area of Potsdamer Platz station directly below the former border, the numerous security and border installations had to be removed.
Finally, after numerous renovations, conversions and demolitions, the two lines were reconnected on 13 November 1993. At the time of the reopening, services on the Berlin small profile network were rearranged:
* U1, previously Ruhleben – Schlesisches Tor, now Krumme Lanke – Schlesisches Tor
* U2, previously Krumme Lanke – Wittenbergplatz (West) and Mohrenstraße – Vinetastraße (Ost), now Vinetastraße – Ruhleben.
* U3, previously Uhlandstraße – Wittenbergplatz, now as U15, Uhlandstraße – Schlesisches Tor.
* a new night service, U12, Ruhleben – Schlesisches Tor, on the route of the former U1. However, the U12 was discontinued in 2003 when night services were introduced on the weekend on almost all Berlin U-Bahn lines.

===Two new stations in late 1990s===

When the U2 reopened in 1993, preliminary work had been carried out on a new station on it. At the time, the ramp between Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz stations had to be built completely rebuilt to enable the 120-metre-long station to be completely horizontal. Therefore, the ramp was redesigned and built a little steeper. The need for this station arose from the completion of new developments around Potsdamer Platz. A station with the provisional name of &quot;Hafenplatz&quot; was built by the BVG with two side platforms and opened as Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park station on 1 October 1998. The construction works were done without impeding the operation of U2. The station, designed by the architects &quot;Hilmer &amp; Sattler und Albrecht&quot; is 619 m from Potsdamer Platz and 469 m from Gleisdreieck stations.

For decades, there had been plans for an extension of the U2 to Pankow S-Bahn station. In 1930, the line had been extended to Vinetastraße. A further extension towards the north was not built due to the Great Depression. Even during the Nazi era, the development plans always provided for the U2 to go at least to Pankow station or even to Pankower Kirche. It was the same in the GDR in the late 1980s, there were even announcements made about its construction. This was mainly because BVG lacked a workshop for small-profile rolling stock. All trains were serviced either in the Friedrichsfelde large-profile workshop or in the Reichsbahn&#x27;s Schoeneweide workshop, which acquired the function of a main workshop. These premises were no longer considered acceptable and so space was sought for a new workshop, since the existing (very small) workshop at Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz station did not meet the requirements. This was to be built east of the Pankow freight yard on Granitzstraße. As part of these plans, the U-Bahn line would be extended by one station. Part of the planned tunnel extension was completed in 1988; after the fall of the wall, the tunnel has converted into a reversing facility.

It was not until the mid 1990s that an extension began to be considered again. New interchanges were provided between the S-Bahn and U-Bahn at numerous points on the U-Bahn network, this included the extension of the U2 to Pankow. The groundbreaking ceremony for this new expansion of the network took place on 13 June 1997. The construction of a new small-profile workshop, as announced in GDR times, was also considered. While it was decided not to proceed with this project, since the current Grunewald workshop could carry out all work required without capacity problem, the foundations of a connection to a workshop were provided. Extremely difficult ground conditions, the high water table and the discovery of a medieval settlement slowed progress significantly. On 16 September 2000, the new line was opened with a new station providing interchange to the S-Bahn. The estimated cost of the works was DM 126 million, but it ended up costing only DM 105 million. During the planning, the new station was referred to as &quot;Bahnhof Pankow&quot;, but the BVG opened it under the name &quot;Pankow&quot;.

The 110 metre-long U-Bahn station with its blue, white and yellow colour scheme had skylights, which were rare in the Berlin U-Bahn network, to enable natural light to penetrate into the station. It was designed by the architect Orlando Figallo. During the construction, a generous entrance building was built at the same time with a lift and escalators to provided convenient connections to S-Bahn line S2 to Bernau. There are also still plans according to which the U2 line would be extended to the old parish church in Breiten Straße in Pankow. This plan is also included in the Berlin Senate&#x27;s 2030 financial scenario. This is considered a medium-term priority.

The two stations were the first built on Berlin&#x27;s small-profile network in decades.

=== Further renovation and modernisation ===
 
An extensive renovation program is currently being carried out on line U2 and this will continue for the next few years. The Senefelderplatz–Vinetastraße section was closed for several months for the opening of the section to Pankow station. Nevertheless, the stations and the track of the former line A suffered considerably during the GDR era, so the remaining stations in former East Berlin also had to be renovated. Märkisches Museum station was refurbished in 2003 and now also has a lift. The large interchange station of Alexanderplatz also received an all-round renovation and five lifts were installed. BVG had Olympia-Stadion station completely renovated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup for €4.47 million. In addition to new platform slabs and the refurbishment of the entrance building, it received two lifts that can be reached by an independent bridge from the station forecourt.
Another renovation project is also under way on the Alexanderplatz–Stadtmitte section. Here the BVG plans to restore Stadtmitte, Hausvogteiplatz and Spittelmarkt stations to their original condition. The renewal of Spittelmarkt station has already been completed. The window gallery has been reopened there and the walls at the rear of the track have been decorated with newly fired ceramic tiles displaying various historical cityscapes.
In addition, the BVG found in 2005 that a bridge between the Gleisdreieck and Bülowstraße stations, which dates back to the early days of the Berlin U-Bahn and was not renovated after German reunification has been significantly damaged. The renovation of the structure, which lies directly above the tunnel mouth of the North–South mainline tunnel, started on 18 August 2006 and was originally intended to last until the end of the year. Due to problems with the manufacturing of the new steel bridge, the BVG extended the construction work until March 2007. During this period, the U2 was interrupted: the eastern Pankow–Gleisdreieck section was operated almost independently—apart from the connection at Alexanderplatz U-Bahn station. Only push-pull trains ran every ten minutes between Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz due to the difficult situation. The western Ruhleben–Wittenbergplatz section was extended to Warschauer Strasse and formed the new line U12. At this time the Nollendorfplatz–Bülowstraße–Gleisdreieck section was closed. Line U1, on the other hand, was shortened to the Wittenbergplatz–Uhlandstraße section, as in earlier times, while services on line U3 was extended by two stations to Gleisdreieck during the peak. In a €7–8 million reconstruction, the bridge was straightened at the same time, which enabled the top speed to be increased from . Other projects, such as the modernisation of the U1 elevated line or Jannowitzbrücke station were delayed due to the €8 million renovation that had not been included in the BVG budget. Regular traffic on the U2 line was resumed on 19 March 2007 after the construction work had been completed.
After the fire at Deutsche Oper station, the BVG decided to retrofit all stations that had only one exit with a second exit for safety reasons. Since the spring of 2006, the stations of Theodor-Heuss-Platz, Sophie-Charlotte-Platz and Deutsche Oper have had a second exit installed at the other end of the platform.
In addition to the renovation program, the installation of lifts continues. In recent years Schönhauser Allee, Märkisches Museum, Alexanderplatz, Stadtmitte, Gleisdreieck, Theodor-Heuss-Platz, Olympia-Stadion and, in early 2009, Potsdamer Platz station, which is very important for tourists, have been given a lift.
The 1.7 km-long viaduct of the elevated railway between the stations of Pankow and Senefelderplatz was extensively renovated in 2009 and 2010 at a cost of almost €100 million. Eberswalder Straße station received a lift as part of this work. This means that 20 of the 29 stations had barrier-free access in 2015.

== Timetable==
Since the timetable change on 12 December 12, 2004, only every second train has operated to Ruhleben during peak and off-peak hours; the others stopped short at Theodor-Heuss-Platz. Since 1990, there has been continuous night services on Friday and Saturday nights on the Ruhleben–Wittenbergplatz route (then line U1). In 2003, this was extended to the entire U2 line. There was already a ten-minute night service on the Vinetastraße–Mohrenstraße (then &quot;Otto-Grotewohl-Straße&quot;) route in East Berlin.


=== Increase in frequencies===
Under the Berlin Senate&#x27;s local transport plan for 2019–2023 the frequency is to be increased to 3.3 minutes by 2023 during the peak hour.

==Future Plans==
There are still plans to extend the U2 towards Pankow Kirche or Rosenthaler Weg. This extension is the only development of the small-profile network included in the Berlin Senate&#x27;s financial scenario for 2030.

In the west, an extension is planned from Ruhleben to Stadtrandstraße, via Ruhlebener Straße, Tiefwerder Weg, Rathaus Spandau, Flankenschanze, Zeppelinstraße, Westerwaldstraße, Falkenhagener Feld and Stadtrandstraße. It has been deferred to after 2030 because the expected patronage is not high enough to justify the extension.

<text>&quot;Kagome Kagome&quot; (かごめかごめ, or ) is a Japanese children&#x27;s game and the song (&quot;Warabe uta&quot;) associated with it. One player is chosen as the &quot;Oni&quot; (literally demon or ogre, but similar to the concept of &quot;it&quot; in tag) and sits blindfolded (or with their eyes covered). The other children join hands and walk in circles around the &quot;Oni&quot; while chanting the song for the game. When the song stops, the &quot;Oni&quot; tries to name the person standing directly behind them.

The song is a subject of much interest because of its cryptic lyrics which vary from region to region. Many interpretations exist, but the originally intended meaning is unknown.

&lt;/score&gt;

==Lyrics==
The song&#x27;s lyrics vary by region, but the most commonly known version is:
The most common interpretation is: (** is additional to match singing)
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;Kagome kagome / The bird in the cage, **bird in the cage**
When, oh when will it come out
In the evening of the dawn
The crane and turtle slipped, **they slipped**
Who is behind you now?&lt;/poem&gt;

As the song is typically written in a single line without any punctuation, in addition to the odd phrasing and ambiguous words, it is also unclear which phrases are connected to which (For example, &quot;In the evening of dawn&quot; could be an answer to &quot;when oh when will it come out&quot;, or could be a setting for &quot;the crane and turtle slipped&quot;).

Common variations in the song include replacing &quot;夜明けの晩に&quot; (&quot;yoake no ban ni/in the evening of the dawn&quot;) with &quot;夜明けの番人&quot; (&quot;yoake no bannin/the guard at/of dawn&quot;), and &quot;後ろの正面&quot; (&quot;ushiro no shoumen/in front of behind&quot;) with &quot;後ろの少年&quot; (&quot;ushiro no shounen/the boy behind&quot;). There are countless variations in history, many of which can be found recorded in writing. 

==Meaning==
Many theories surround the meanings of the various phrases in the song. These include:

===Kagome===
*&quot;Kagome&quot; (籠目): The holes in a basket
*A corruption of &quot;kakome&quot; (&quot;surround&quot;)
*The shape of the holes in a traditional basket, a hexagon
*The shape of the holes in a traditional, including the woven material, a hexagram
*&quot;Kagome&quot; (籠女): A pregnant woman
*Kagome – a caged bird
* Kagome – &quot;Circle you&quot;
*Can also mean &quot;lost&quot;

===Kago no naka no tori wa===
*As &quot;kago&quot; can mean both &quot;cage&quot; and &quot;basket&quot;, a bird in a basket would, by the standards of the age, be a chicken
*It is possible that &quot;tori&quot; is supposed to be a metaphor for torii, and that kago (typically woven out of bamboo) refers to a bamboo fence, and that thus the &quot;torii surrounded by bamboo&quot; is in fact a Shinto shrine.
*In the case that kagome is interpreted as &quot;pregnant woman&quot;, the bird in the cage is her unborn child, as the Japanese saying of &quot;a bird in the cage&quot; being a euphemism for pregnancy.

===Itsu itsu deyaru===
*Can also be &quot;itsu itsu deau&quot; (&quot;When oh when will we meet&quot;)
*Can mean &quot;When will it come out?&quot;
*Can mean &quot;When can it come out?&quot;

===Yoake no ban ni===
*Can simply mean night
*Can mean &quot;from morning till night&quot;
*Can mean an inability to see light
*Can mean a period of time that can be taken as either dawn or night (around 4 AM)
*As &quot;yoake&quot; literally means the end of night, and &quot;ban&quot; can refer to both night or evening, this can be a purposeful contradiction referring to a time period that does not exist

===Tsuru to kame ga subetta===
*The crane and turtle can be interpreted as symbols of good fortune, and thus their slipping can mean the coming of misfortune
*The crane and turtle can be interpreted as symbols of long life, and thus their slipping can mean the coming of death
*&quot;Subetta&quot; can be taken to be &quot;統べった&quot; or &quot;統べた&quot; (&quot;to rule over&quot;), in which case the crane and turtle symbolize a ruler
*Could be a corruption of a line from a Kyoto nursery rhyme, &quot;tsurutsuru tsuppaita&quot;

===Ushiro no shoumen daare===
*Can simply mean &quot;who stands behind&quot;
*Can be taken to mean &quot;who is it that stands right in front when you look behind&quot; in a figurative manner, referring to hidden people in positions of power
*Can be taken to be something said by someone who has been beheaded, whose head is looking at his own back
*Can be taken to be something said by someone who is about to be beheaded, in which case the question &quot;who is it who stands behind me&quot; is in other words &quot;who is my executioner&quot;

==Theories==
The song is a subject of much academic interest and many theories surround its origin and meaning. Some such theories are:
;The lyrics refer to the game only
:In this theory the lyrics mean &quot;Surround, surround (the Oni) / When will the Oni be able to switch roles with the next person? / Who is it standing behind you?&quot;.
;The song is about a prostitute
:In this theory the lyrics refer to a woman forced into prostitution (the bird in a cage) who has seen so many men that she cannot remember all of them (&quot;who is it who stands behind&quot; refers to the next person in line) and wonders when she will be able to escape (when oh when will it escape).
;The song is about a pregnant woman
:In this theory the &quot;kagome&quot; is a pregnant woman. Someone pushes her down a flight of stairs (&quot;tsuru to kame ga subetta&quot;) and she miscarries, and wonders who killed her child (&quot;ushiro no shoumen daare&quot;).
;The song is about a convict to be executed
:The &quot;kagome&quot; is a prison cell, and the bird is its prisoner. &quot;Tsuru to kame ga subetta&quot; symbolizes the end of life and fortune, and &quot;ushiro no shoumen daare&quot; is either the prisoner wondering who his executioner is, or his disembodied head gazing at his own body.

<doc id="594644" wikidata="Q99708" url="?curid=594644" title="U4 (Berlin U-Bahn)">
<text>The U4 is a line of the Berlin U-Bahn in Germany that is the shortest in Berlin&#x27;s U-Bahn system, with a length of . Opened in 1910, the U4 serves five stations, all of which are step-free: it is also the only subway line in Berlin to have never been extended and the only one to have no night service on weekends.

In 1903, Schöneberg, an independent city that as south-west of the municipal limits of Berlin, planned to develop an underground railway line to improve public transportation. As the line promised less profit for private investors (all Berlin U-Bahn lines had until then been built with private capital), negotiations with the (Berlin Elevated Railway Company, the operator of Berlin U-Bahn) were unsuccessful.

That made Schöneberg start to build the line itself on 8 December 1908. Two years later, the construction was finished, and on 1 December 1910, the line was put into operation. Although Schöneberg owned the track, upon the line&#x27;s opening, the city handed operations over to the Hochbahngesellschaft.

== History ==

The independent town of Schöneberg wanted to increase its growth and so decided in 1903 to build an U-Bahn line. There were talks with the &quot;Berlin Hochbahngesellschaft&quot; (U-Bahn operator). However, the interests of the operator and of the city did not match because the short line promised little ridership and was deemed unlikely to make a profit. That made the city of Schöneberg take matters into its own hands and plan the first municipal U-Bahn in Germany. The route was intended as an underground railway from Nollendorfplatz, where an elevated train station of the Berlin Hoch- und Untergrundbahn already existed, to the Hauptstraße (main street) in the south of Schöneberg. Extension to the north was considered for the future, and even a route to Weißensee (following the proposed U3/U10 alignment) was proposed. Firstly, however, Nollendorfplatz station (the new line initially built its own tunnel station on Motzstraße in front of the existing station), Victoria-Luise-Platz station, Bayerischer Platz station, Stadtpark (now Rathaus Schöneberg station) and Hauptstraße (now Innsbrucker Platz station) were planned. South of the Hauptstraße, the workshop was to be built. Because the line was separate from the pre-existing underground railway, new equipment was required.

Schöneberg chose to use tracks and trains that were compatible with the rest of the fledgling network to allow future connections. Thus, the U4 was also built to what is now known as &quot;Kleinprofil&quot; (the narrower loading gauge used in Berlin), as the &quot;Großprofil&quot; lines did not exist yet. Track gauge and electrification follow the same standard on all Berlin U-Bahn lines, with standard gauge and third rail electrification at 750-volt DC.

Siemens &amp; Halske AEG were tasked with all aspects of construction, including the equipment of the track and the delivery of the vehicles. Such a contract would be now called &quot;turnkey&quot;. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on 8 December 1908.

Next to the construction site of the subway was Rudolph Wilde Park, which was then called Stadtpark (City Park or Municipal Park), just like the subway station. As the park was built on a marshy fen that was up to deep, the material that was excavated from the tunnels, with a total volume of around , was used to drain and to fill the land where necessary. After two years of construction, the line was opened on 1 December 1910 as Line BI. However, the festivities were rather subdued since the &quot;father&quot; of Schöneberg&#x27;s subway, Mayor Rudolph Wilde, had died a month earlier. Schöneberg thus became the second city in the German Empire to build a subway, ahead of Hamburg U-Bahn, which opened in 1912, and the first to follow the now-common model of financing a project municipally to be realised by private contractors. The previous method was having all aspects handled by the private sector, with the government acting only as a regulatory and a concession-granting entity.

Since the Schöneberg subway was initially completely separate from the rest of the Berlin U-Bahn network, extra facilities had to be built to accommodate it. Those included an entirely-separate fleet and depot with a workshop. At Nollendorfplatz, a pedestrian tunnel was built between the newly-built station of the Schöneberg subway and the existing station of the &quot;Hochbahngesellschaft&quot; to allow passengers to seamlessly connect between the two systems. 

South of Innsbrucker Platz station, the tunnel was continued into Eisackstraße. There was a three-track crossover and parking facility in the tunnel. From the western track, the workshop access line branched off to the workshop, which connected to a dedicated tunnel to Otzenstraße and reached daylight on the workshop area. The tunnel exit is still visible at the end of the tunnel in Otzenstraße. At the end of the workshop area was another short tunnel, where the access track ended. The workshop received a five-track wagon hall and a two-track workshop hall. The small Schöneberg workshop became unused with the opening of the new interchange station at Nollendorfplatz in 1926 and therefore was decommissioned in 1932, as trains could now easily pass from the Schöneberg subway to the rest of the Berlin U-Bahn network and use the large U-Bahn workshops at the Berlin Olympiastadion station and at &quot;Warschauer Brücke&quot; (now called Berlin Warschauer Straße station).

After the Second World War, the Waldenburg &quot;Oberschule&quot; was built on the former workshop grounds. Nowadays, trains use a spur track that connects line U4 to line U1, where they can access the Warschauer Straße Depot on the latter line. In the course of construction of Bundesautobahn 100, the long-unused tunnel to the defunct depot was interrupted, which significantly hinders any potential extension southward (see below).

The city of Schöneberg owned the infrastructure of the route, but the operation was run by the &quot;Hochbahngesellschaft&quot;. Thus, the different ownership did not matter at all for the passengers since one day earlier, a collective agreement had been reached. Ticketing and fares were thus handled by the &quot;Hochbahngesellschaft&quot;, which was in some sense a precursor to a &quot;Verkehrsverbund&quot;. As the numerous small independent cities in the Greater Berlin Area were seen as an anachronistic nuisance, the new Free State of Prussia quickly decided to redraw the municipal boundaries of Berlin. This resulted in the Greater Berlin Act of 1920, which merged Schöneberg, along with many other cities, into Berlin. In the course of the Weimar Republic, the &quot;Stadtrat&quot; (municipal councilor) in charge of Berlin transportation at the time, Ernst Reuter, created &quot;Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe&quot; which absorbed the former Schöneberg subway and has run it ever since.

The second subway in Germany thus existed as an independent entity for barely a decade.

From 1985 to 1993, automatic train operation using the SelTrac system was trialled on line U4. The SelTrac system that was used on line U4 was manufactured by Standard Elektrik Lorenz (later part of Alcatel-Lucent), and allowed very tight headways of 50 to 90 seconds. It was the first trial service of an automatic U-Bahn in Germany, but to alleviate riders&#x27; concerns, a driver was still present. Concurrently, the M-Bahn also ran a fully automated revenue service for a short while before reunification necessitated the dismantling of the M-Bahn and its replacement with the U-Bahn, whose temporarily-abandoned right of way the M-Bahn had used. It would take until the 2008 opening of Nuremberg&#x27;s U3 before automatic operation would be seen on a German subway line again.

On 27 November 2010, the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Schöneberg subway, a commemorative service with historical rolling stock (type A1) was run.

==Operations==
The turn-of-the-century predictions turned out to be accurate since ridership on U4 is lower than on other lines in the system, partly because of the short length of the line. All other Berlin U-Bahn lines run at night on weekends, but that is not the case for U4 (the only other line with that distinction was the temporary U55 prior to its connection to U5 in 2020). Nonetheless, a five-minute headway is maintained at peak times, which decreases to ten- or fifteen-minute headways at less busy times of the week.

==Extension plans==
U4 is the only subway line in Berlin never to have been extended despite plans at the time of its construction that would eventually extend the line (see above). A southward extension would have significant technical hurdles to overcome since the tunnel of Bundesautobahn 100 is in the way, and there seems to be no appetite for removing the section of A100. There were various plans for a modest northward extension towards Magdeburger Platz in the 2000s, but it has ultimately determined that the shift of passengers to the newly-extended line would be unlikely to justify the expense and so those plans were shelved.

<doc id="594645" wikidata="Q99711" url="?curid=594645" title="U5 (Berlin U-Bahn)">
<text>U5 is a line on the Berlin U-Bahn. It runs from Hauptbahnhof in Mitte eastwards through Alexanderplatz, Friedrichshain, Lichtenberg and Friedrichsfelde, surfaces in to pass Kaulsdorf and Hellersdorf above ground and finally reaches city limits at Hönow.

== Route==
Line U5 connects Moabit with the large housing estate of Hellersdorf and the Brandenburg town of Hönow, but ends just outside the eastern city limits of Berlin. It begins at Berlin Hauptbahnhof (central station) and heads southeast under the Spree river, the Spreebogenpark and the Platz der Republik to Brandenburg Gate. From there it follows Unter den Linden, crossing line 6 at Friedrichstraße. After Museumsinsel station, the line runs under Rathausstraße, passing under the Humboldt Forum. After leaving Alexanderplatz, it takes a sharp right turn under Karl-Marx-Allee. It follows that street (which becomes Frankfurter Allee after Frankfurter Tor station) for several stations in a straight line in an easterly direction and crosses the Berliner Ringbahn at Frankfurter Allee station. From Berlin-Lichtenberg station, where it passes under the S-Bahn and the Berlin–Küstrin-Kietz railway, the line swings to the southeast. It runs under Einbecker Straße and then past the Friedrichsfelde workshop to Tierpark station. In a sharp left turn, the U5 bypasses Tierpark Berlin (a zoo) and reaches its southernmost point at this point. It turns to the northeast and reaches the surface for the first time.

Now above ground, the U5 runs through Biesdorf-Süd. It crosses Köpenicker Straße at Elsterwerdaer Platz station and a little later the street of Alt-Biesdorf, which forms part of both federal highways B 1 and B 5. It crosses the S-Bahn line and the Berlin–Küstrin-Kietz railway again at Wuhletal station. The line then runs underground along Gülzower Straße for a short distance. After a sweeping left turn, the U-Bahn resurfaces before Kaulsdorf-Nord station and runs north and later north-east. The line runs next to Hellersdorfer Straße as far as Hellersdorf, continuing to Louis-Lewin-Straße station and then running next to Böhlener Straße. Right on the city limits, but still within territory of Berlin, the U5 line ends at Hönow station, the easternmost point of the Berlin U-Bahn network at Mahlsdorfer Straße on the edge of Hönow.

==History==
===Early history===
In 1908, before the opening of the section of U-Bahn line A from Spittelmarkt to Alexanderplatz (now part of line U2) in 1913, the &quot;Hochbahngesellschaft&quot; (Elevated Railway Company) planned to build a line that would run under Frankfurter Allee from Alexanderplatz to Frankfurter Allee station. Alexanderplatz station was to have two adjacent platforms and the line was to be built as an elevated railway from Koppenstraße, which was outside the city. The city of Berlin was receptive to these plans, but demanded that the line be built entirely underground.

In 1910, the Elevated Railway Company changed its plans: U-Bahn line E would now pass under Alexanderstraße so that it could connect with the already approved section between Spittelmarkt and Schönhauser Allee. This would have made it possible for line E services to run via Alexanderplatz into Klosterstrasse. The trains coming from Spittelmarkt and from Schönhauser Allee would have been able to run through to Frankfurter Allee and also in the opposite direction. This idea was never implemented.

The Elevated Railway Company controlled several private transport companies and so, at the end of the 1920s, the &quot;Nord-Süd-Bahn&quot; (North-South Railway) took over the final planning and implementation of U-Bahn line E as an independent line in Berlin&#x27;s large profile network with the possibility of extending it towards Leipziger Straße/Französische Straße and with a connection to another line along Greifswalder Straße to Weißensee. The lines would merge at Alexanderplatz and separate again at Berlin City Hall (&quot;Rotes Rathaus&quot;). The Elevated Railway Company originally planned to run line E along a section of Landsberger Allee that no longer exists from Alexanderplatz to Büschingplatz (where Mollstraße now connects to Platz der Vereinte Nationen), where a station would be built. It would then turn into Weberstraße, which then ran to the southeast, and turn into Große Frankfurter Straße (now: Karl-Marx-Allee) at Strausberger Platz. In 1925, the city of Berlin received a suggestion from the private sector to insert a -long curve between Alexanderplatz and the current Schillingstraße station, so that it would run through Große Frankfurter Straße and not through Büschingplatz as planned. There was also another change in planning that provided for line E not to end at Frankfurter Allee station, but to continue to Friedrichsfelde, because there was an area available there for a workshop.

====Construction and commissioning====

The construction work was carried out using the cut-and-cover method between 1927 and 1930. The line from Alexanderplatz to Friedrichsfelde was opened on 21 December 1930. Apart from Friedrichsfelde, all stations are located at such a depth that their exits on the sidewalks could be connected via distribution floors. The tunnel itself was built deep enough to allow ducts for the pipes of the Berlin water company, the cables of the Berlin electricity company and the telephone cables of the post office to be built above it at the same width.

===Tierpark extension===
A continuation of the Alexanderplatz–Friedrichsfelde section via Karlshorst towards Schöneweide was planned when it was completed in 1930. After the Second World War, plans emerged to extend the line to Tierpark Berlin, a new zoo established in 1955 at Friedrichsfelde Palace. In 1956, plans were developed to continue the line from Friedrichsfelde on two elevated tracks to a terminal station west of Straße am Tierpark at the entrance to Friedrichsfelde Palace. Two tracks of the carriage sidings of the Friedrichsfelde workshop were to be extended for this purpose. However, this project was not carried out because it would have made it difficult to extend the line further. In addition, traffic to the zoo was not seen as sufficient to justify the construction of the extension. When apartments were later built in the area of the zoo, the plan was taken up again, especially since the closure of the tram line on the street of Alt Friedrichsfelde as a result of the construction of the road bridge over Lichtenberg station had created a gap in the network.

====Construction and commissioning====
No official decision to proceed was taken or permit issued for the work for the extension to Tierpark station. Due to a lack of utilisation of the pile-driving capacity of the civil engineering VEB, construction began illegally at the Tierpark station, because the directors of the civil engineering company and the &quot;Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe&quot; (Berlin transport company; BVB) had carried out the first pile driving on 19 September 1969. The city councillor responsible for transport had no idea about this project. Much later, under public pressure, formal decisions were made and the required financial allocations were made for the continuation of construction of the one-station extension. It was decided to start construction at the end of the line in the area of the Tierpark station so that there was no need to fear that construction would be later stopped altogether. Official railway construction lasted from 1970 to 1973.

On the morning of 4 October 1972, a major fire broke out in the turnback siding on the north side of Alexanderplatz U-Bahn station on &quot;Line A&quot; (towards Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz station). To enable the tunnel shell, which had been damaged in the fire, to be restored quickly, a large number of precast concrete parts intended to be installed in the line extension in Friedrichsfelde were transferred from there. This led to the last minor construction delay. The extension from Friedrichsfelde underground station to Tierpark underground station was inaugurated on 25 June 1973.

===Hönow extension===
The construction of the new housing estate in Marzahn began in 1977, followed by the new housing estate in Hellersdorf in the mid-1980s. At the beginning of the 1980s, the working groups of the Ministry of Transport of the GDR and the city council of Berlin investigated the construction of a rapid transit connection in the Kaulsdorf and Hellersdorf area. They examined and discussed S-Bahn, U-Bahn and tram options. In 1983/1984, it was decided to extend U-Bahn line E from Tierpark to Hönow. The option examined had the necessary reserve capacity, was economically justifiable and could be implemented in the planned period of time. Difficulties associated with the route had to be considered in the decision-making process. The original route planning for an extension of the U-Bahn line south to Schöneweide had to be abandoned. In addition, the connection from Tierpark station to the old line of the connecting or suburban railway to Kaulsdorf (VnK) complicated engineering and structural issues. The new underground line had to be connected to the VnK line directly behind the platform of Tierpark station in a sharp curve that was barely permissible and part of the turnback siding had to be demolished. It was also expected that expensive work to widen the railway embankment of the VnK route would be necessary and noise protection measures would have to be installed in Biesdorf Süd. On 27  February 1985, the Berlin City Council published a document that assumed that the section between Tierpark and Elsterwerdaer Platz would open on 30 June 1988 and the section between Elsterwerdaer Platz and Hönow would open on 30 June 1989.

====Construction====

Construction officially started on 1 March 1985. It was not built sequentially, but at several places simultaneously. First, earthwork and civil engineering work was carried out on the route and at the planned stations. So that the line could be connected to the Tierpark station, a long tunnel was built on the complicated curved route on the VnK line. The VnK route to Kaulsdorf/Fernbahn route could not be used as it stood. It had to be partially removed, rebuilt and compacted. Old bridges located near Elsterwerdaer Platz, above Köpenicker Straße and above what is now the B 1 / B 5 highway had to be demolished and replaced with new ones to allow the widening of both roads. A -long tunnel was built along Gülzower Straße between today&#x27;s Wuhletal station and Kaulsdorf-Nord station. Extensive work was required on the Hellersdorf cutting from there to Cottbusser Platz station on Cottbusser Straße. Measures were taken to lower the groundwater and to provide deep drainage. The parallel running French drain from a septic drain field had to be replaced by pipes. The water from the Hellersdorf cutting was pumped into the enclosed ditch. The rest of the line from Cottbusser Platz station to Hönow station is approximately at street level with some ups and downs.

Track laying began in mid-February 1987, when the earthworks and the creation of the ballast formation had been completed on various sections of the line. A total of of assembled track was built for the route. More than were required just for the multiple relocations of S-Bahn and long-distance train tracks near today&#x27;s Wuhletal station. The S-Bahn traffic was maintained during the construction work, but short-term interruptions and timetable changes occurred.

As far as possible, construction machines from the stock of Deutsche Reichsbahn were used for the track construction. For this purpose and for the supply of material, an alternative construction connection point was established on the Berlin-Rummelsburg–Biesdorfer Kreuz Südwest line. In order to enable the use of long-distance rolling stock, which require a larger loading gauge, the cover plates of the platform edges of the affected platforms were only installed after track work had been completed.

Biesdorf-Süd station was provided with three platform tracks and an adjoining single-track turnback, because the previous one in Tierpark station could only be used as a siding due to the changed route. Another two-track line was built at the north end of &quot;Albert-Norden-Straße&quot; (now: Kaulsdorf-Nord). In addition, a spacious storage facility was established between the stations of &quot;Paul-Verner-Straße&quot; (now: Louis-Lewin-Straße) and Hönow. During the construction of Wuhletal station, the transfer group at Wuhletal signal box built a permanently usable track connection to the long-distance railway network for the first time.

==== Commissioning====
Before commissioning, test runs were carried out on the stretch between Tierpark and Elsterwerdaer Platz stations. After its successful completion, the section between Tierpark station and Elsterwerdaer Platz station was opened on 30 June 1988. The opening ceremony took place at Elsterwerdaer Platz station with brass band music and speeches by leading party and state officials. Exactly one year later, on 30 June 1989, the rest of the extension to Hönow station was opened. This time the opening ceremony took place at Tierpark station with the politician Günter Schabowski, several government ministers, the first secretary of the central council of the FDJ Eberhard Aurich, the mayor Erhard Krack and other officials.

===U55 and final extension===
There had long been plans to extend the U5 westward since the 1970s. The short U55 line opened in August 2009, and ran from Berlin Hauptbahnhof via the Bundestag U-Bahn station to Brandenburger Tor station. The designation of the line as U55 indicates that it was ultimately intended to become part of the U5 line.

Construction of the link between the two segments began in April 2010 and it opened on 4 December 2020. The link is long, and connects Brandenburger Tor to Alexanderplatz. Along its route it serves new U-bahn stations at Berliner Rathaus, Museumsinsel and Unter den Linden, with the last providing an interchange with line U6.

===Signalling===
After reunification, the U5 was upgraded to the new signalling system under &quot;Systemtechnik für den automatischen Regelbetrieb&quot; (STAR - System technology for automatic control operation). The trial stretch extended from Friedrichsfelde to Biesdorf-Süd, using H-Zug trains, which were introduced from 1996 to April 2000. The Class H, used on the U5 could be converted to fully automatic train operation, and there still exists a 1995 Bombardier trial train, which is capable of operating automatically.

In contrast to trials with LZB 501, which used conductor loops, on line U9, and SelTrac on lines U2 and U4, STAR employed radio technology (&quot;Funkzugbeeinflussung&quot;).

In 2002 Berlin Senate decided that the U5 should not be extended further for the time being. Accordingly, the BVG announced that it would no longer pursue the project, since automatic operations would only be between U5 Alexanderplatz and Hönow and therefore not worthwhile.

At that time, the BVG was the technology leader in automatic operation in Germany. Driverless operation was used previously on the U4, however a driver continued to be present to supervise the ride. In 2008 and 2010 the underground lines U2 and U3 of the Nuremberg U-Bahn became the first automated subway lines in Germany.

===Refurbishment===

At reunification, the line was renumbered as U5 to match the naming system in use in West Berlin. Between January 2003 and December 2004, reconstruction was conducted between Alexanderplatz and Friedrichsfelde in order to repair damage dating back to World War II. Not all the stations were preserved as monumental value. 1330 meters of railway track and tracks were relocated. For this purpose, the train traffic on the route was interrupted for three months. The aim was to improve the quality of stay at the stations. The lighting has been renewed and made brighter, the technology has been brought up to date, the plaster has been extensively renovated and the walls have been clad in a vandalism-proof surface with enamelled sheet steel. The BVG took over Grenander&#x27;s principle of identifying colors, but chose new color patterns. Numerous metro stations have been equipped with lifts and are now wheelchair accessible. An example of a completely new design, including the rebuilding of the northern end of the station, is the Schillingstraße station.

In time for the International Garden Exhibition 2017, and neighboring &quot;gardens of the world&quot;, the station Neu Grottkauer Straße was redeveloped in the spring of 2017 to provide a lift, new roof and new lighting, and renamed Kienberg (Gardens of the World). The renaming occurred at the timetable change in December 2016. The cost of all measures has been estimated at around €6.6 million.

The latest stations, built between 1973 and 1989 from Tierpark to Hönow should be placed under monument protection, with the exception of this is the already significantly changed subway station Kienberg (Garten der Welt).

A refurbishment of the other aboveground stations built in GDR times is not planned before the middle of the 2020s. Equipping all stations with elevators to make them fully accessible is not planned until the lift program is completed on the rest of the metro network. The existing ramp systems with a slope of around 10% are only considered barrier-free.

===Former U5===
There used to be a U5 running from Deutsche Oper to Richard-Wagner-Platz, from 1 March 1966 to 1 May 1970. Before 1966, it was numbered AI and BI and the branch line as AIII. In 1970, the stretch was closed and in 1974, the station was demolished.

== Plans ==

In the long term, there are plans to extend the line from Berlin Hauptbahnhof, via Turmstraße and Jungfernheide to Flughafen Tegel. This plan was postponed due to the route being too long, the closure of Tegel Airport, and Berlin&#x27;s poor fiscal situation. An addition to the plan is an extension towards Rathaus Reinickendorf via Cité Pasteur Nord, Scharnweberstraße, and Eichborndamm.

The stations that were involved in the extension include:
*Alt-Moabit
*Turmstraße
*Huttenstraße
*Goslarer Platz
*Jungfernheide
*Hakenfelde
*Urban Tech Republic
*Cité Pasteur Nord
*Scharnweberstraße
*Eichborndamm
*Rathaus Reinckendorf

As of September 2016, the longer extension has been replaced by the tram extension from Hauptbahnhof, via Turmstraße, Mierendorffplatz, Jungfernheide, and towards Tegel Airport, which is planned to be redeveloped into a new Urban Tech Republic development after the airport is closed, thus allowing the U5 to be shortened to run to just Berlin Hauptbahnhof. The possibility of extending the tram line to Cité Pasteur Nord, Scharnweberstraße and Eichborndamm to Rathaus Reinickendorf remains in the vision stage. The tram extension was planned to be completed just before 2028.

Plans were revived in March 2023 under the &quot;Express Metropolis Berlin&quot;, the route remains the same as before the U5 extension was cancelled in September 2016. North of Jungfernheide is parallel to U0, a proposed line under the “Express Metropolis” Plan.

At Jungfernheide, two island platforms were constructed for the planned interchange station between the U7 and U5. The finished section is used for firefighting exercises in conjunction with airport security and the BVG. Trains that are used in these exercises include 2712/2713 (&#x27;9 Zoolog. Garten&#x27;) and 2714/2715 (Jakob-Kaiser-Platz), which were covered with legal spray painting. During the 1980 opening, Jungfernheide was in a deadlock because of the Berlin Wall conflict that prevented the U5 from extending towards the west.

== Frequency==
U5&#x27;s frequency is about 5 minutes during peak periods. Alternate trains will terminate at Kaulsdorf-Nord during off-peak periods, thus the lower demand section is 10 minutes. Since 2003, U5 has offered 15-minute weekend night service; the replacement bus service N5 was offered on weeknights.

<doc id="594646" wikidata="Q99720" url="?curid=594646" title="U6 (Berlin U-Bahn)">
<text>U6 is a long rapid transit line on the Berlin U-Bahn with 29 stations. It runs in a north-south direction from the Berlin locality of Tegel in the north via Friedrichstraße to Mariendorf, a locality in the southern part of the city. It is one of the five large profile (&quot;Großprofil&quot;) lines.

During the Cold War, both U6 termini were in the former West Berlin but the line passed under East Berlin for a short section of its route. Five of its stations were sealed off by East German authorities and the trains went through these so-called “ghost stations” without stopping, while a sixth, Friedrichstraße, remained open primarily as a transfer station between the U6 and the S-Bahn lines using the north-south S-Bahn tunnel, but also as an official border crossing between East and West Berlin.

It was formerly named &quot;CI&quot; from 1923 to 1928.

==Current routing==

U6 begins its journey from its northern terminus in central Tegel, first running in a southeasterly direction underground along the path of Berliner Straße to the Borsigwerke station, after which it surfaces to run on an embankment beside Seidelstraße and Scharnweberstraße. Just after the &quot;Scharnweberstraße&quot; station it enters a tunnel and continues under Müllerstraße (which becomes Chausseestraße and then Friedrichstraße). From this point it runs in a distinctly southerly direction. After Mehringplatz at the &quot;Hallesches Tor&quot; station, U6 crosses under the Landwehr Canal and swings slightly westwards to run parallel to Mehringdamm, which changes its name to Tempelhofer Damm at the Platz der Luftbrücke station, and then to Mariendorfer Damm after crossing the Teltow Canal. U6 crosses this canal in a conduit attached to and immediately below the road-traffic bridge. The line ends at the intersection of Reisseckstraße, Friedenstraße and Mariendorfer Damm at its terminus, the &quot;Alt-Mariendorf&quot; station.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===

As early as 1901 the city of Berlin had plans for a subway running from north to south under Friedrichstraße. Werner von Siemens also had plans for a line under that impressive street, but at the time the city decided the transport system should be in public hands and began construction of the so-called North-South Line from Wedding to Tempelhof, with a branch to Neukölln. This work was delayed and finally abandoned due to difficulties associated with World War I. Relics of this early phase up to 1918 can still be found in the rolled-steel support pillars at the Oranienburger Tor station, still bearing the trade name of the supplying rolling mill, Rombach in Alsace-Lorraine.

In 1919 work was resumed, but during the post-war hyperinflation period the filling in of the already existing tunnel was proposed in 1921. However it was decided to continued construction after all, and on 30 January 1923 the first tunnel section was opened between Hallesches Tor and Stettiner Bahnhof (the latter going by the name of &quot;Naturkundemuseum&quot; station since 13 December 2009, replacing the name &quot;Zinnowitzer Straße&quot; station). A northwest extension was opened on 8 March 1923 between Stettiner Bahnhof and Seestraße, with a maintenance workshop being built at the &quot;Seestraße&quot; station.

At the junction of Mohrenstraße and Friedrichstraße, two subway lines intersected for the first time: the city’s North-South Line, renamed Line C, and the private Central Line (&quot;Centrumsline&quot;). But as the concept of a tower station (accommodating two lines stacked one above the other) was not well known, the city of Berlin built its own station, named Leipziger Straße (now &quot;Stadtmitte&quot;), from the Central Line station. The result is that passengers transferring between the two lines still today have to walk through a long connecting pedestrian tunnel, popularly known by Berliners as the “mouse route” (&quot;Mäusetunnel&quot;).

At Belle-Alliance Straße (now named Mehringdamm) where the line separated into two branches, three tracks were built. From the western track (side platform), trains ran to both termini, Tempelhof and Neukölln; the central platform was used for trains heading downtown, the middle track for those coming from Neukölln and the eastern track for trains coming from Tempelhof. In the course of constructing the U7 line, the station was completely redesigned and is now called &quot;Mehringdamm&quot;.

Due to disputes with the administrative district of Tempelhof, the first route to be built was the branch to Neukölln. Work on the other branch only began in 1924, but just two years later, on 14 February 1926, the stretch from Belle-Alliance-Straße to Kreuzberg (now the &quot;Platz der Luftbrücke&quot; station) was opened. A year later this second branch extended to Tempelhof Airport (now the &quot;Paradestraße&quot; station). This now-closed airport was located to the east of the U6 track.

In 1929 the line was extended to intersect with the S-Bahn’s &quot;Tempelhof&quot; station on the circle line (Ringbahn). A large ticket hall was erected for both S- and U-Bahn passengers. Since the station had to be built very deep to accommodate the subway line, there was room for a spacious ticket hall.

===The northern extension===

Even as construction of the North-South/C Line began there were plans to extend it to Berlin-Tegel, and of tunnel had been prepared by 1929. This extension from the existing &quot;Seestraße&quot; station to the center of Tegel made several bus and tram lines redundant and for that reason this stretch was the first to be worked on after the war in the western part of the city.

The first pile was driven on 26 October 1953 at Müllerstraße north of the &quot;Seestraße&quot; station. The stretch was built in two sections:
*Seestraße to Kurt-Schumacher-Platz
*Kurt-Schumacher-Platz to Tegel

For reasons of cost and because of a very high water table there, north of Kurt-Schumacher-Platz it was decided to put the track on an embankment instead of in a cutting. A ramp raise the track to an embankment and onward to Berlin’s first station for large profile cars, the &quot;Scharnweberstraße&quot; station. After passing the &quot;Holzhauser Straße&quot; station on this northwestern stretch, the tracks return underground, following the course of Berliner Straße to the center of Berlin-Tegel.


As was the case before World War II, the stations had a very functional design with its surfaces covered with bright, pastel-colored ceramic tiles. The embankment stations were built of reinforced concrete, which was typical for the time. Nowadays this gives them a very bulky appearance so they do not radiate the charm of many of the suburban stations, such as those on the U3 line to the south.

A first section was opened on 3 May 1956, the second on 31 May 1958. With the opening of the C Line the northern Berlin Transport Company (BVG) network was completely restructured and numerous tram lines in this area could be eliminated.

=== &quot;Ghost stations&quot; ===
After the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, on the orders of German Democratic Republic interior minister Karl Maron all U6 stations inside East Berlin were closed to passenger traffic, except for the &quot;Friedrichstraße&quot; station. At that station, West-Berlin passengers could transfer to the S-Bahn or enter East Berlin via the established border crossing there. This order turned all remaining closed stations into so-called &quot;ghost stations&quot;, through which trains were required to pass without stopping and which could only be entered by East German border and traffic policemen.

To service the area formerly accessible to the East Berlin population via the U6, until the ghost stations were reopened a bus line 59 was established between the Walter Ulbricht-Stadium, later renamed World Youth Stadium (&quot;Stadion der Weltjugend&quot;), and Leipziger Straße. The ghost stations did not appear on East German city maps. They were successively renovated and opened between 11 November 1989, around the fall of the Berlin Wall (U8 &quot;Jannowitzbrücke&quot; station) and 1 July 1990, the date of German customs reunification (the last U6 stations to open were &quot;Stadion der Weltjugend/Schwartzkopfstraße., Nordbahnhof/Naturkundenmuseum, Oranienburger Tor, Französische Straße&quot; and &quot;Stadtmitte&quot;).

A cold war curiosity: Schwartzkopffstraße station, renamed &quot;Walter-Ulbricht Stadion&quot; in April 1951 after the newly built sports field, was one of the five U6 ghost stations. Nevertheless, on 15 March, the 1973 East Berlin authorities did not hesitate to rename the underground station which had been deserted for eleven years &quot;Stadion der Weltjugend&quot; – the signs with the station name visible only to (mostly West-Berlin) subway passengers as their train passed through the station.

=== Completion of line 6 ===

As with the northern extension to Tegel, ever since construction of Line C began it was planned to extend it to Alt-Mariendorf as the southern terminus. The Nazis had planned to extend the line even further south to the Mariendorf horse race track (&quot;Trabrennbahn Mariendorf&quot;). When work on the long-awaited extension began, there were debates about the cost and it was, for example, proposed to lay the track in a cutting next to the Tempelhofer Damm/Mariendorf Damm roads. The public transport company BVG objected, arguing that easy access to the Tempelhof municipal offices (&quot;Rathaus Tempelhof&quot;) and the main shopping street would only be possible with an underground line.
The first pile for the route was driven on 6 March 1961 and the &quot;Alt-Mariendorf&quot; terminus station was opened on 28 February 1966. The route is from the S-and U-Bahn station &quot;Tempelhof&quot; straight south along the Tempelhofer Damm to the Teltow canal. Similar to the construction of today’s U7 line to Rudow, the canal posed the biggest problem for the track in this area and an unusual solution was found. The U6 tracks are contained in a construction underneath and connected to the lower part of the road traffic bridge over the canal. The side with the northbound rail was built with enough space for the &quot;Ullsteinstraße&quot; station. Since the canal shipping required a vertical clearance of , ramps were built to raise the road above its original level.
South of the Teltow Canal the U6 follows Mariendorfer Damm to the terminus station &quot;Alt-Mariendorf&quot;, which was built at the junction of the roads Reißeckstraße/Friedensstraße and Mariendorfer Damm. From here, several bus routes service the sparsely developed surroundings. This expansion completed the U6 line. Further extensions are not planned.

Except for the &quot;Alt-Tempelhof&quot; station, all stations were designed by the architect Rainer G. Rümmler. As with the southern part of the U7 line, he used large rectangular ceramic tiles to surface the station walls.

=== Reopening ===

Station restoration and modification of the platforms and tunnels was started after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and all the former “ghost stations” had been opened by 1 July 1990.

When the U6 was built between 1912 and 1923, money was scarce because of World War I and the subsequent hyperinflation period, and the tight budgetary situation of the city of Berlin as the owner of the new North-South line did not leave much of a financial margin. The stations for the small-profile trains, built earlier, had been more attractively designed, whereas the U6 merely had white plaster finishing. The only distinguishing feature for each station was a characteristic color for the columns and station signs. The length of the platforms was also reduced. Lengths of were customary for the platforms built later, but at that time only platforms were constructed. Already in the 1970s the first capacity problems arose because only four-car trains could be accommodated on these platforms. Therefore, in the 1960s and 1970s the West Berlin subway stations were modified to extend the platforms so longer trains could be used. But since modification of the U6’s three border stations, &quot;Friedrichstraße, Kochstraße&quot; and &quot;Reinckendorfer Straße&quot;, was either not possible or would have involved paying a considerable sum of money to East Germany, and since the trains did not even stop at the 5 “ghost stations”, only four-car trains could be operated on the U6 line. As compensation, the trains arrived at 3-minute intervals during rush hours.
In order to provide six-car trains to handle the traffic after German reunification in 1990, the Berlin Senate allocated 250 million DM to extend the platforms of the northern stations &quot;Schwartzkopffstraße&quot; and &quot;Reinickendorfer Straße&quot;, and the southern stations &quot;Kochstraße, Stadtmitte, Französische Straße&quot;, &quot;Friedrichstraße&quot;, &quot;Oranienburger Tor&quot;, and &quot;Zinnowitzer Straße&quot; (today &quot;Naturkundemuseum&quot;), The modifications took four years - from July 1992 to September 1996 – without service interruption in various stations:
*Oranienburger Tor - modified from July 27, 1992 to April 1994
*Friedrichstraße - modified from September 1992 to June 1995
*Reinickendorfer Straße - modified from July 1993 to October 1995
*Kochstraße - modified from October 1993 to January 1996
*Stadtmitte and Franzöische Straße - modified from 1994 to 29 September 1996
*Zinnowitzer Straße and Schwartzkopffstraße - modified from 1995 to 29 September 1996

=== Recent service changes ===

The extension of the U5 line from Alexanderplatz to Brandenburger Tor includes a station &quot;Unter den Linden&quot; at Friedrichstraße, offering an opportunity to transfer to the U6 line. This construction work required a discontinuation of service between the &quot;Friedrichstraße&quot; and &quot;Französische Straße&quot; stations between July 2012 and October 2013, and the closure of &quot;Französische Straße&quot; station when the U5 extension opened on 4 December 2020, due to the close proximity of the new station to &quot;Französische Straße&quot;.

The northern part of the U6, between Kurt-Schumacher-Platz and Alt-Tegel, is currently closed from 7 November 2022 until Spring 2025: this long-term blockade was implemented to allow the reconstruction of the overground section, which includes replacing a concrete bridge over Seidelstraße (coordinates: ).

== Plans for the future ==

In the old plans it was known that U6 will be extended to Hennigsdorf, Lichterfelde-Sud and Teltow Stadt.

The southern U6 extension goes from Alt-Mariendorf, Trabrennbahn Mariendorf, Tauernallee, Marienfelde Süd, Goethestraße, Barnetstraße and towards Alt-Lichtenrade.

For a feasibility study from 2020, a possible branch route to today&#x27;s Berlin-Tegel airport or the future technology location Urban Tech Republic was examined. A replacement variant, &quot;U65&quot;, a length of is achieved, depending on the variant of the U6 threading. The cost estimates are between 275 million and 607 million euros. Two variants ran out on an elevated railway. If it is expanded as a tunnel, operations on the U6 would have to be restricted for longer. An estimate of the demand is only available for one of the five variants: 15,000 passengers per day. At the moment, U5 extension is being separated into U65 and tram links respectively.

== Frequency ==

Trains were running at 4-min intervals during peak periods and 5-min intervals during off-peak periods. Night service was introduced in 2003 and it is running at 15-minute frequency.

<text>The U7 is a rail line on the Berlin U-Bahn. It runs completely underground for a length of through 40 stations and connects Spandau, via Neukölln, to Gropiusstadt and Rudow. The U7 was originally the south-eastern branch of the (U6) that ran between the branching point at Belle-Alliance-Straße (Mehringdamm) and Grenzallee; however, in the 1960s, this stretch was separated from the rest of the line and extended at each end to form a new line.

The U7 is Berlin&#x27;s longest underground line, both in terms of absolute length and total travel time, and one of the longest all-subterranean lines in Europe.

==Route==
Starting in Rudow, at the junction of Gross-Ziethener Chaussee and Neuköllner Straße, the U7 runs northwest below the road Alt-Rudow, before bearing west in the Gropiusstadt area. Because the settlement and underground construction there were planned simultaneously, the U7 follows no roads until it reaches Britz-Süd station, where it runs under Fritz-Reuter-Allee as far as Blaschkoallee station before joining the route of Buschkrugallee. It continues north, crossing the urban motorway and the Ringbahn while under Karl-Marx-Straße, then heads north-west under Hasenheide, Südstern, and Gneisenaustraße until it reaches Mehringdamm after a very sharp right curve. A tight left curve brings the U7 under the () to Möckernbrücke station, with another taking it back and below the area of the former (). The route continues west under Yorckstraße, Willmanndamm, Grunewaldstraße, Bayerischer Platz, and Berliner Straße, then heads north under Brandenburgische Straße to Adenauerplatz station.

A curve into Wilmersdorfer Straße takes the U7 north to Bismarckstraße station, where it makes a further turn into Richard-Wagner-Straße, travelling under this road and its northern continuations Wintersteinstraße and Sömmeringstraße. At Jungfernheide station, the U7 crosses the Ringbahn for the second time before passing under the Westhafenkanal. The track then turns west through a wide arc and follows Siemensdamm and Nonnendammallee. It passes to the south of the Spandau Citadel below the road Am Juliusturm, runs under the Old Town of Spandau, and ends at Rathaus Spandau station.

The U7 passes through 12 districts of Berlin: Rudow, Gropiusstadt, Britz, Neukölln, Kreuzberg, Schöneberg, Wilmersdorf, Charlottenburg, Charlottenburg-Nord, Siemensstadt, Haselhorst, and Spandau.

==History==

=== Construction of the North-South Underground: 1901–1930 ===

Around 1901, the city of Berlin planned to build an underground railway line below Friedrichstraße to connect the north to the south. Werner von Siemens also had plans for a north–south line, under Nobelstraße, at the same time, but permission for these was declined on the grounds that public transport should be in municipal ownership. Consequently, Berlin started the construction of the Nord–Süd-Bahn (&quot;North–South railway&quot;) to link Wedding and Tempelhof (as of 2007, part of the U6), with a branch to Neukölln.

World War I made the construction work difficult, and finally stopped it completely. In 1919, work started again, but not without further complications. In 1921, during the time of hyperinflation, filling up the existing tunnels was considered as financial turmoil hit hard. The construction work was continued, however, and the first tunnel section from Hallesches Tor to Stettiner Bahnhof (later renamed Naturkundemuseum) was opened on 30 January 1923.

The history of the U7 began with the construction of the branch to Neukölln, when the stretch from Hallesches Tor to Gneisenaustraße was built; it opened on 9 April 1924. With inflation still taking its toll, the construction work proceeded in small steps only. The extension to Hasenheide station, named after a nearby park (and later renamed &quot;Südstern&quot;), followed on 14 December of the same year. As the financial situation of Germany and Berlin improved, so too did the underground railway construction, including the branch to Neukölln.

At Hermannplatz station, which resembles something of an U-Bahn cathedral, the first underground rail–rail crossing in Berlin was developed; transfer to the GN-Bahn (later the &quot;U8&quot;) was intended at this station. The station is also the first Berlin underground station to use escalators. The section from Hasenheide to Bergstraße (later &quot;Karl-Marx-Straße&quot;) was put into operation on 11 April 1926. The final stage of the Neukölln branch at that time, the 1.5 kilometre-long (0.9 mi) extension to Grenzallee, was put into operation on 21 December 1930—the same day of the opening of what would become the U5 line—during one of the largest underground opening celebrations. Underground passengers could then travel from Seestraße (U6), through the city centre, to either Tempelhof or Grenzallee.

The post-war underground lines were marked out from their 1901–1914 predecessors by their larger tunnels and trains, in order to provide greater competition with the privately run (). The new trains and tunnels, which were wider but used the same standard-gauge track, were described as ().

===Connection to Rudow===

Following World War II—in which many of Berlin&#x27;s residences were destroyed—large new housing developments were needed. Britz and Britz-Buckow-Rudow (BBR; later renamed &quot;Gropiusstadt&quot;), which were established in the south of West Berlin, required a new rapid-transit railway connection to the West Berlin city centre; the construction work for the underground railway began on 2 November 1959.

The track from Grenzallee to Britz-Süd opened on 28 September 1963.

Construction began from Britz-Süd to Rudow on 2 January 1965. Travel to Zwickauer Damm was made possible on 2 January 1970, and Rudow received connection to Line 7 on 1 July 1972.

===Extension to the west===
The branch station Belle-Alliance-Straße (later renamed &quot;Mehringdamm&quot;), which opened in 1924, had three tracks: a connection to Tempelhof led from the first platform; to Neukölln from the second; and to the city centre from the third. A separation of the Neuköllner branch from the North-South Line was decided upon in order to avoid an overload on the transfer station Hallesches Tor. Therefore, Line 7 was extended west from Belle-Alliance-Straße. The construction work began in the middle of 1962, and was completed on 26 February 1966 with the link to Möckernbrücke station. Beside the construction of Möckernbrücke station, changes to Mehringdamm station—which would become a transfer point between unbranched lines—were necessary.

The further extension of Line 7 was accomplished with subsidy funds. The construction of the track from Möckernbrücke to Fehrbelliner Platz started on 1 July 1962, and finished on 29 January 1971.
===In three stages to Spandau: 1960-1984===
At the end of the 1960s, ideas about an underground railway line to Spandau arose again. The planned extension to Line 7 through Mierendorffplatz, Jungfernheide, and Nonnendammallee was chosen to improve public transportation to Siemensstadt—important for its many jobs. Already at the time, there were plans to build a subway to Spandau. First steps were taken with the extension of the line of today&#x27;s line U2 to Ruhleben. The terminus Ruhleben is located directly on the district border to Spandau. Feeder and distribution traffic, until 1967 by tram, replaced by several bus lines, provided solely for the development of Spandau on the subway station Ruhleben.

The construction work for the section Fehrbelliner Platz–Richard-Wagner-Platz began in 1969 which is H-West-II. By 1970, the then shortest and less frequented subway line of Berlin, line 5, oscillated between Deutsche Oper and Richard Wagner Platz. Their old route was shut down for passenger traffic, and a new station was built several meters below the old one. The remaining tunnels could be converted into an operating section, making it the second exchange line between small and large profile after the Waisentunnel at Alexanderplatz station. The route continues under the Brandenburgische Straße and crosses the Kurfürstendamm at Adenauerplatz, where a train station was also built. The station was created as a crossing station as it was (and officially still is) planned to extend the current U-Bahn line U1 from Uhlandstraße to Adenauerplatz. After Adenauerplatz, the track swings under Wilmersdorfer Straße and passes under the Stadtbahn.

Wilmersdorfer Straße was constructed with a pedestrian passage to the Charlottenburg S-Bahn station. At Bismarckstraße, a new underground railway station had to be built, since the pre-existing tunnel of Line 1 (later renamed U2) was in a bad condition and necessitated extensive repair works. After Bismarckstraße, 23 houses had to be underpinned, therefore the shield drive was used for tunnelling this section. The stage from Fehrbelliner Platz to Richard-Wagner-Platz was put into operation on 28 April 1978.

Earthworks and some motorway construction began at Charlottenburg-Nord on 3 July 1967, which is located at Siemensstadt. Construction began for the section to Rohrdamm from 1973. The construction work for the next section towards Spandau began in 1973. The route leads north of the station Richard-Wagner-Platz further under the Sömmeringstraße. Halfway to Mierendorffplatz, the Spree is underpassed using the caisson construction method. After a few meters, the station follows Mierendorffplatz. North of the station, the route makes a wide berth to reach the existing S-Bahn station Jungfernheide. Here, similar to the station Schloßstraße, the platforms were built on two levels. The other tracks are kept until today for a possible extension of the U5, which is to lead from Lehrter to Tegel Airport via Turmstraße and Jungfernheide. However, the plan was cancelled due to the budget situation, the longer length of the extension north of Jungfernheide station due to the planned closure of Tegel Airport. Trams will be replacing the U-Bahn extension. The finished extension is now used for firefighting exercises and is no longer usable for any future line. The extension to Rohrdamm followed on 1 October 1980, providing the district of Spandau with its first underground connection.

The costs of the extension to the Spandau city centre rose to unexpected heights: it consumed 680 million German marks as a result of the need to undercut the Havel river and the swampy ground in the surrounding area. Construction began on 4 July 1977. Several variants were investigated. One plan was to lead the subway through the Haselhorster village center, with a downside that the Havel had to be undercut at one of its widest points. Another variant was that the subway would cross the existing Spandau suburban railway of the S-Bahn and the subway would be led from the south to Spandau city hall. This plan crystallized very late, as the plan envisaged to lead the U7 over Falkenseer Platz into Falkenhagener Feld. This resulted in the disadvantage that the Spandau old town could not be connected, which was the main goal of the extension. Finally, they decided to continue the route along the Nonnendammallee or the street Am Juliusturm, south past the Spandau Citadel and then directly to the old town and on to the Spandau town hall, with the development of Falkenhagener Feld taken over by the extension of the small profile route of the line U2 of Ruhleben. On 1 October 1984, the last section of the U7 from Rohrdamm to Rathaus Spandau was opened, with the then Federal Chancellor of Germany, Helmut Kohl, in attendance.

==Future plans==
In 2014, the Berlin city government published the Berlin U-Bahn 2014 Plan, according to which the long-postponed northern extension of the U7 to Staaken is expected to begin construction in 2021 and be completed in 2025. A southern extension from Rudow to Berlin Brandenburg Airport via Neuhofer Straße, Lieselotte-Berger-Straße, and Schönefeld has already been shelved as the expected patronage was not high enough to justify such an expansion. However, in light of the ballot measure aimed at keeping Tegel Airport open after the opening of the new Brandenburg Airport, governing mayor Michael Müller suggested an extension of U7 towards Schönefeld and/or the new airport which was greeted with enthusiasm by local politicians in Schönefeld and the Berlin district of Neukölln.

==Line colour and name==
In 1966, the branched C line had a violet map colour. After it was separated from the rest of the line and line names were changed from letters to numbers, this route was called (), and was represented by a grey line. After 1978, however, it was changed to a bright blue, because it is more easily discerned on the map. Since 1984, when all the underground lines received a &quot;U&quot; prefix, it has been called &quot;U7&quot;. Station signages use the Helvetica font which is widely used in subway systems globally.

==In popular culture==
In March 2009, TML-Studios released &#x27;World of Subways Vol. 2: U7 - Berlin&#x27; for Windows, which gives players the opportunity to operate a train on the U7 Line in either F90 or H01 rolling stock.

<text>U8 is a line on the Berlin U-Bahn. It has 24 stations and is long. The U8 is one of three north–south Berlin U-Bahn lines (U6, U9), and runs from Wittenau to Neukölln via Gesundbrunnen. The original proposal was for a suspended monorail like the Wuppertal Schwebebahn.

== Colouring and naming ==
The U8 line has had dark blue as its distinguishing colour since it first opened in 1927. It initially ran between Gesundbrunnen and Neukölln and was therefore known as the GN-Bahn. Until 1966 it was designated the D line; when the U-Bahn then changed to a numeric designation system, it was renamed Line 8. In 1984, the letter U was added as part of efforts to better distinguish the S-Bahn from the U-Bahn.

== History ==

=== Gesundbrunnen to Neukölln: the GN-Bahn ===
In 1902, a Nuremberg company, the &quot;Continentale Gesellschaft für elektrische Unternehmungen&quot;, approached Berlin&#x27;s executive council, the &quot;Magistrat&quot;, about building a monorail like the one that had already been built in Elberfeld-Barmen (now part of Wuppertal). Their preferred route ran from Gesundbrunnen to Rixdorf (later renamed Neukölln). However, the Magistrat and city council were sceptical about the project, above all fearing accidents.

In 1907, AEG made a competing proposal for almost the same route, in the form of an underground line within the city and an elevated railway in the suburban districts. After lengthy negotiations, in March 1912 the City of Berlin and AEG finally agreed upon a contract for the construction and operation of the line. Agreement was ultimately reached under considerable time pressure, because planning authority in matters of transport was to pass in April 1912 to the Greater Berlin Association and their position on this project was undetermined.

The line was to begin as elevated track on Schwedenstraße and then continue to Humboldthain via Badstraße. From there it would run underground to Hermannplatz via Brunnenstraße, Rosenthaler Straße, Weinmeisterstraße, Münzstraße, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Straße, Neue Friedrichstraße, Brückenstraße, Neanderstraße, Dresdener Straße, Luisenufer, Reichenberger Straße, Kottbusser Straße and Kottbusser Damm. AEG intended to build the line for the wider of the two train formats, known as &quot;Großprofil&quot; (large profile), like the first north–south line.

Construction began in 1912. Like Siemens, AEG had formed a subsidiary elevated railway company, AEG-Schnellbahn-AG. However, in the short period before and during the First World War, only a few tunnel sections were completed, among them the tunnel under the River Spree, between the Waisenbrücke and the Jannowitzbrücke. Finally, AEG&#x27;s financial situation became so difficult that they ceased all construction work in October 1919. Thereupon the City of Berlin brought a successful legal action against AEG, as a result of which AEG-Schnellbahn-AG was liquidated. The city then received all the tunnel sections which had been built and planned to complete the line itself, but was at the time still in the process of constructing the first north–south U-Bahn.

At that time plans were considered for eventually extending the line, some of them adventurous, for example a connection to the &quot;Heidekrautbahn&quot; railway to the north and another to the &quot;Neukölln-Mittenwald Railway&quot; to the south, so that theoretically a mass transit line would have been created extending from Groß Schönebeck in Schorfheide through Berlin to Mittenwalde.

Work did not resume on the GN-Bahn until 1926. The change of oversight had advantages for Berlin, because it made it possible to correct some sections of the route, for example, the northern elevated section, which was entirely eliminated, and the location of the tunnel at the Alexanderplatz.

The first work was on the southern portion of the GN-Bahn, so that service began on 17 July 1927 between Boddinstraße and Schönleinstraße. Between these stations was the Hermannplatz station, which had been built as part of the simultaneous construction of the first north–south U-Bahn, finished 4 years earlier; here passengers were now for the first time able to transfer from one &quot;large profile&quot; (wide-body) line to another. A switching track was built between the two.

Construction then progressed north. At the Kottbusser Tor station, the existing elevated station was relocated to make changing trains easier. Operation of the trunk line continued on wooden trestles.

It now seemed natural to continue the line via Dresdener Straße and the Oranienplatz to Neanderstraße (now Heinrich-Heine-Straße) - perhaps too natural: the stretch to Kottbusser Tor would have been very short. In addition, noting the Karstadt store at Hermannplatz, the Wertheim department store had realised the advantages of a connection to the U-Bahn and reputedly paid for a change in the plans. The GN-Bahn would now be diverted to Moritzplatz and then round a sharp curve to Neanderstraße. So Wertheim in Moritzplatz also acquired an entrance from the U-Bahn. The shell of a station at Oranienplatz, which had already been constructed by AEG, remains unused to the present day.

After Moritzplatz, the route follows the Neanderstraße and provisionally terminated at the station of that name (renamed Heinrich-Heine-Straße in 1960). The segment between Schönleinstraße and Neanderstraße was opened on 12 February 1928 as far as Kottbusser Tor and on 6 April of the same year to Neanderstraße. A year later, an additional station opened south of Boddinstraße, Leinestraße (in August 1929).

Beyond the Neanderstraße station was the previously constructed tunnel under the Spree. However, since this needed to be altered and the Jannowitzbrücke was in bad condition, a completely new bridge was constructed with a new U-Bahn crossing beneath it. The old tunnel was later put to use for a service connection between the U5 and U8 (usually called the &quot;Waisentunnel&quot; due an orphanage nearby).
The U-Bahn construction at Alexanderplatz took a long time, because the opportunity was taken to completely re-design the square. Some adjustments were also made to the line of the route, and the GN-Bahn thus appreciably better integrated into the remainder of the public transport system.

At Alexanderplatz, a large transfer terminal was created for the U-Bahn, S-Bahn, trams and buses. At that time also, the so-called &quot;mother of all underground shopping concourses&quot; was created. Today, in contrast, it seems rather small in comparison to, for example, the arcade at the Hauptwache station in Frankfurt.

Alexanderplatz station now has the form of an &#x27;H&#x27;. The eastern leg of the &#x27;H&#x27; is the U-Bahn station already opened in 1913 for what is today the U2. The western leg is the GN-Bahn station (today the U8). The crosspiece is the U-Bahn under the Frankfurter Allee, then under construction. Two platforms were built, used by what is today the U5 and projected to be used by a planned line from Potsdamer Platz to Weissensee.

There were no further major problems; for the most part, AEG tunnels already existed. The section from Neanderstraße to Gesundbrunnen opened on 18 April 1930.

As with the other wide-format line, operation was transferred to the elevated railway company.

=== Dividing Berlin into two: 1961–1990 ===
After the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, on the orders of German Democratic Republic interior minister Karl Maron all U8 stations inside East Berlin were closed to passenger traffic. This order turned all remaining closed stations into so-called &quot;ghost stations&quot;, through which trains were required to pass without stopping and which could only be entered by East German border and traffic policemen. These stations were closed: Bernauer Straße, Rosenthaler Platz, Weinmeisterstraße, Alexanderplatz, Jannowitzbrücke and Heinrich-Heine-Straße from 13 August 1961 till the fall of the Berlin Wall. To serve the area formerly connected by U8 for the East Berlin, a bus line 78 was introduced from Arkonaplatz to Märkisches Museum.

After the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the U8 line was not in great shape. It began with 6 stations in West Berlin, followed by an equally long section underneath East Berlin (&#x27;ghost stations&#x27;) and ended at Gesundbrunnen after 2 more stations in the western sector. As a result, the line was of little use for public transport, and was also potentially open to disruption by the GDR.

In 1962, plans were known for a new residential district in West Berlin, the Märkisches Viertel. Like Gropiusstadt, this ought naturally to have U-Bahn service. The S-Bahn to Frohnau, which passed nearby, was ignored; West Berliners boycotted it because it was operated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, an arm of the GDR government, plus the East Germans did not have money to spend building a new station. After extensive deliberation, it was decided to extend the U8.
When Line 9 was extended to Osloer Straße, a lower-level platform for the U8 was constructed at the same time. Work on that extension began in 1973, and the extension was opened on 5 October 1977.
Beyond the Gesundbrunnen station, the line continues under Badstraße. At the junction with Pankstraße a station with the same name was constructed. The Pankstraße U-Bahn station was constructed to be usable as a shelter (e.g. in case of war). To this end Pankstraße has sanitary facilities, an emergency kitchen, a filtered ventilation system, et c. In an emergency it can shelter 3,339 people. The additional costs for these facilities were paid by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The walls are tiled in brown and the columns clad in aluminium sheeting. One curiosity remains at Pankstraße station: the silver letters affixed to the walls spell the name as &quot;Pankstrasse&quot;, transliterating the eszett and ignoring the correct German spelling (&quot;Pankstraße&quot;).

The line continues along Schwedenstraße to the previously prepared Osloer Straße station. A service track was added here so that trains can also be transferred from the U8 to the U9.

Not until 10 years later, on 27 April 1987, was it possible to open the next section of the line, to Paracelsus-Bad (construction had begun on 12 September 1980). The extensions on the other lines had proceeded significantly faster; here work lasted an unusually long time.

After Osloer Straße station, the line continues along Schwedenstraße, which changes its name to Residenzstraße shortly before it intersects Reginardstraße. A station was built near the Schäfersee lake. There were many disputes over what to name it; the name finally agreed upon is Franz-Neumann-Platz (Am Schäfersee) (Franz-Neumann-Platz (at the Schäfersee). Like the following stations on the line, this station bears the unmistakable stamp of station architect Rainer Rümmler. On its walls are trees, intended to symbolise the parkland surrounding the lake.

To better integrate the line into the district of Reinickendorf, it then detours slightly, not continuing beneath the industrial area to the Wilhelmsruh S-Bahn station, but instead taking a route via the Karl Bonhoeffer Neuropsychiatric Clinic and the Reinickendorf town hall. It then continues under Residenzstraße, where again a station of that name was built, makes a wide curve under the junction of Residenzstraße and Lindauer Allee, and a few hundred metres later comes to the Paracelsus-Bad station.
The Residenzstraße station, intended to be reminiscent of the Berlin Imperial palace, is decorated with plans of the now destroyed Stadtschloß. The supporting pillars are decorated in very bright colours and probably intended to evoke the rich carpets of the residence. Paracelsus-Bad station was designed to evoke associations with the nearby swimming baths. In addition there are pictures on the wall, one of which shows the doctor and philosopher Paracelsus (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim).

This new section of the line was actually intended to be inaugurated on the precise 750th anniversary of the city of Berlin, 30 April 1987. However, since the festivities that day were to begin with a celebration at the ICC, the then Executive Mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, would not be able to attend and hence the opening was brought forward by 3 days. Once more, a long time passed before the next extension of the line towards Märkisches Viertel. It was 1994 before it was possible to take the U8 to the Wittenau S-Bahn station.

=== Completion of the U8 ===

The residents of Märkisches Viertel had been promised a U-Bahn connection ever since the late 1960s. After examination of several options, the decision was to extend the U8. By 1987, two stages in this extension had been completed: Gesundbrunnen – Osloer Straße and Osloer Straße – Paracelsus-Bad. The third stage still remained to be built. After the BVG took over operation of the S-Bahn in West Berlin and the Frohnau section of line was reopened on 1 October 1984, there was increasing criticism of the U8 extension, which would run almost parallel to the S-Bahn. However, the Senate of West Berlin was not to be dissuaded and resumed construction on the U-Bahn. Even a directive from the government of the Federal Republic in Bonn to instead invest in badly needed renovations of the S-Bahn, coupled with a warning that subsidies to Berlin would be reduced, was dismissed with the argument that cessation of the U-Bahn construction would cause severe economic harm to the city.

Construction began on 27 February 1985, while the preceding segment of the U8 was also still under construction. The intended terminus of the third stage of the line extension was Wilhelmsruher Damm, near the Wittenau S-Bahn station. This was apparently to distinguish the U-Bahn from the S-Bahn. Only shortly before dedication of the new segment did the Senate correct the name of the station, which has since been called Wittenau (Wilhelmsruher Damm), but is commonly known simply as Wittenau.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, three stations were opened simultaneously - Bernauer Straße, Rosenthaler Platz and Jannowitzbrücke. Station restoration was started after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and all the former “ghost stations” had been opened by 1 July 1990.

After Paracelsus-Bad, the line continues under Lindauer Allee to Lindauer Allee station, the only one on the U8 to have outside platforms. After a long curve, the U8 is running under the S-Bahn. The location of the next station requires a long walk to transfer between the two. There was also disagreement concerning the name of this station: the S-Bahn station at this point was called &quot;Wittenau (Kremmener Bahn)&quot;, to distinguish it from &quot;Wittenau (Nordbahn)&quot; (which is now &quot;Wittenau (Wilhelmsruher Damm)&quot; to match the U-Bahn station). The U-Bahn station was to be called Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik after the psychiatric clinic. This was a mouthful that was only slowly accepted. On the S-Bahn, to this day &quot;Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik&quot; is announced but the shorter &quot;Karl-Bonhoeffer-Klinik&quot; appears on signs. The subway line then continues under the clinic. To minimise disturbance, this stretch of tunnel was excavated using a shield, and rubber sound baffling was also needed. This attracted repeated criticism from those who would have preferred open tunnelling with shoring up of buildings. Other problems also arose during construction of this stretch of line: the Brandenburg sand made work particularly difficult and numerous oversized boulders (glacial erratics) caused delays.

After Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik the U8 turns onto Eichborndamm, where the Rathaus Reinickendorf station was built. further, it reaches its current and probably ultimate terminus, Wittenau. The intention still remains today to extend this line to Märkisches Viertel. However, as with other U-Bahn construction projects, the extreme budgetary crisis in the state of Berlin is preventing further construction.

The completed extension, which is long and comprises 4 new stations, was opened on 24 September 1994. Construction cost 600 million DM. As with other newly built sections of the U-Bahn in this period, Rainer Rümmler was responsible for the design of the stations. Critics say that this section would represent his peak, but that Rümmler had a tendency to excess. This is particularly evident in the Lindauer Allee station, where he primarily made use of the symbol on the coat of arms of the city of Lindau, the linden tree. At the Wittenau U-Bahn station, the colours green and yellow were supposed to radiate a certain peace, which he associated with the intended station name &quot;Wilhelmsruher Damm&quot;.
Plans for a U-Bahn to the Hermannstraße S-Bahn station had existed since 1910. When the so-called GN-Bahn was opening in stages between 1927 and 1930, plans to extend it were not abandoned. The first work on a southwards extension began in 1929; but the economic crisis prevented its continuation. Ultimately, the City of Berlin cancelled the project in 1931. At that point, the tunnel from the Leinestraße station and approximately one third of the future platform for the Hermannstraße station had been completed.

In 1940 the station, still only a shell, was converted into an air-raid shelter, since it was located very deep underground because the line crossed under the Ringbahn, which at this point runs in a cutting. To this day, relics in the station recall that time.

After 1961, the extension plans were no longer pursued, since there was no demand for transfer capability to the S-Bahn, operated by the GDR&#x27;s Reichsbahn. BVG used the stubs of tunnel which had already been built to park surplus trains.

After reunification in 1990, many things seemed possible. The S-Bahn Ringbahn, shut down by the Reichsbahn after a 1980 strike, was to be re-opened. The re-opening was scheduled for 17 December 1993, which meant that the Senate and BVG had to work very fast, because construction had to begin on the U-Bahn before the Ringbahn re-opened. During work on the station, the trains which had been parked there in the 1960s were discovered. Many U-Bahn fans were delighted that one of the discoveries was an antique BI train.

The work included renovation of the old tunnel and existing platform section as well as construction of the remainder of the platform and a turnaround beyond it to the south. In addition, transfer access to the S-Bahn platform above and possible stairways to a planned regional station had to be accommodated.
Finally, on 13 July 1996, the 168th Berlin U-Bahn station opened. Here too, Rainer Rümmler was responsible for the design of the station, incidentally for the last time. He referred very strongly to the stations on the preceding stretch of line and designed a very sparse station lined with turquoise tiles. So that the historic shelter signs would remain visible, glass was substituted for the tiles in some places.

With the commissioning of this station, the U8 reached what is up to now its final form. Even though an extension to Märkisches Viertel is planned, it is unlikely that it will become a reality for decades. The previously planned extension towards Britz was cancelled because the U7 follows a parallel route.

==Frequency==
U8 trains run every five minutes, with the exception of the stretch between Paracelsus-Bad and Wittenau, where they run every ten minutes. Since 2003, the U8 also runs at night on the weekends. During weekdays, the N8 bus replaces the train service during night hours.

<text>U9 is a line on the Berlin U-Bahn. The line was opened on 28 August 1961 as Line G.

==Route==
The path of the U9 is completely underground. It starts in the north at Osloer Straße in Gesundbrunnen and runs through Wedding before passing under the Berlin Ringbahn and running through Moabit, reaching Hansaplatz and Tiergarten before crossing the Berlin Stadtbahn at the Zoo and Kurfürstendamm, eventually leaving western central Berlin by heading to Friedenau and finally Steglitz at Rathaus Steglitz.

==History==

===First stage of construction===
After the division of Berlin in 1948, the citizens of West Berlin preferred buses and trams that bypassed East Berlin. Furthermore, the highly populated boroughs of Steglitz, Wedding and Reinickendorf were in need of rapid transit access to the new center of West Berlin south of the Zoo. This prompted the construction of a completely new line, then called line G, becoming the third north–south line after line C (modern U6) and line D (modern U8).

Groundbreaking took place on 23 June 1955 at Tiergarten. Construction was difficult as it needed to pass under four U-Bahn lines (U1, U2, U3, U6), two S-Bahn lines (Stadtbahn, Ringbahn twice) and three waterways (Spree River, Landwehr Canal, Berlin-Spandau Canal).

Line G from Leopoldplatz to Spichernstraße was planned to open on 2 September 1961. This was pushed up to 28 August 1961 after the construction of the Berlin Wall underscored the necessity of this new line. To accommodate the U9, the Nürnberger Platz station was closed. It was replaced by Spichernstraße (opened 2 June 1959) and Augsburger Straße (opened 8 May 1961) stations respectively.

The new stations include:
*Leopoldplatz (today: U6)
*Amrumer Straße
*Putlitzstraße (today: Westhafen; S-Bahn /Ringbahn)
*Birkenstraße
*Turmstraße
*Hansaplatz
*Zoologischer Garten (heute: U2; S-Bahn /Stadtbahn)
*Kurfürstendamm (today: U1)
*Spichernstraße (today: U3)

It will also interchange with the smaller profile station, but it was opened on the same day as U9 was opened:
*Kurfürstendamm

=== Second Stage ===

==== Background ====
In the early 1960s, West Berlin experienced significant population growth and faced political isolation following the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961. The Wall disrupted transportation between East and West Berlin, making it essential to enhance the internal U-Bahn network. To improve connectivity and reduce reliance on buses, which were slower and less efficient, West Berlin planned an extensive U-Bahn expansion. This project was funded by subsidies from the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), supporting West Berlin during its period of isolation.

==== Groundbreaking ====
Groundbreaking for the second stage of the Berlin U-Bahn began on 1 July 1962. This phase aimed to increase the network&#x27;s capacity, alleviate congestion of both passengers and trains on existing lines, and provide faster connections to previously underserved areas. At the time, it was the longest U-Bahn extension in Berlin&#x27;s history, encompassing nine kilometers of track and eleven new stations.

==== Construction and Route Description ====
The expansion focused on two major lines entirely within West Berlin:

- U7 Extension: The U7 line was extended westward from Möckernbrücke to Fehrbelliner Platz, serving neighborhoods like Wilmersdorf. This extension enhanced access to Berlin&#x27;s western center and addressed areas that lacked efficient public transit.

- U9 Extension: The U9 line was extended southward from Spichernstraße to Walther-Schreiber-Platz along Bundesallee, serving Wilmersdorf and Schöneberg. The U9 crosses the U7 at Berliner Straße station, where the U9 runs deeper underground than the U7 to accommodate the intersection.

These expansions significantly covered a large portion of West Berlin, improving overall connectivity without extending into East Berlin.

==== Extension Completion and Impact ====
Completed on 29 January 1971, the new expansion provided Steglitz and Neukölln with rapid connections to the western center, replacing slower buses that were hindered by traffic congestion. The Berlin Wall&#x27;s continued presence made internal connectivity crucial, promoting economic growth and improving the quality of life for residents. This extension remains one of the longest in U-Bahn history.

==== Platform Design and Road Tunnels ====
During construction, infrastructure challenges were addressed through innovative platform designs:

- Berliner Straße Station: A road tunnel was built beneath Bundesallee, necessitating an unconventional central platform. Here, U9 trains approach from the left, mimicking side platforms with a single passageway at the north end connecting both sections.

- Bundesplatz Station: A road tunnel under Bundesplatz prevented the construction of a central platform. Instead, tracks split before the station, creating two side platforms.

Both road tunnels and associated U-Bahn stations were constructed by West Berlin authorities as part of urban development projects.

==== Architectural Design ====
All stations in this extension were designed by Rainer G. Rümmler. Departing from traditional ceramic tiles, Rümmler employed large, colorful fiber cement panels. The color schemes were chosen to evoke specific associations:

- Berliner Straße Station: Features white and red panels reflecting Berlin&#x27;s coat of arms.
- Eisenacher Straße Station: Showcases green panels inspired by the Thuringian Forest near Eisenach.

Rümmler&#x27;s bold color choices made him a controversial yet influential architect in the history of Berlin&#x27;s U-Bahn.

===Final extension===
Between Walther-Schreiber-Platz station and the Schloßstraße the U9 changes to the tunnel section of U10. In Schloßstraße station itself, the tracks are heading north on the top, in the direction of Rathaus Steglitz on the lower level, however, the offices on the eastern edge of the platform on which was supposed to take the U10. The western edge of the platform is separated by a fence from the passenger traffic. In track trough, unused tracks are laid without power rail. To date, there hangs the sign &quot;No trains&quot;. By these enormous constructed provisions, the cost of one meter underground route exorbitantly to 78,000 Mark (adjusted for purchasing power in today&#x27;s money).

Behind the Schloßstraße ends the U9 at the Rathaus Steglitz. The paths of U9 and U10 here separate again. Both lines should keep in Steglitz at separate stations, viewed from Schloßstraße from an end opening &quot;V&quot; would form. The intended actually for the U9 station Part &quot;(Rzo)&quot; is equipped with side platforms, located in the minus-1 level until now has been completed only in the shell and is cut off as a storeroom for the civil protection used. The original platform is operated for the U9 instead of planned for the U10 Station part &quot;(Rzu)&quot; in the minus-2 level.

The background for this management decision lies at the intersection of the planned U9-line and Wannseebahn immediately south of the station. In the 1970s, negotiations with the Deutsche Reichsbahn regarding the railway line to Steglitz station proved unsuccessful. Consequently, the BVG did not create the necessary sweeping system behind the station. Unlike the west-extending U10, the U9 faced challenges, leading it to be routed along the U10 with a reversing facility. In January 1984, when the operation shifted to BVG, an opportunity arose to pass under the S-Bahn without reopening negotiations with the Reichsbahn. With this assurance, the functionless tunnel was extended beneath the railway embankment in the mid-1980s. However, a reversing facility, or at least a part of it, was not incorporated into this section, with plans to address this in a subsequent part of the tunnel.

The section to Rathaus Stegliz was definitely opened on 30 September 1974, its construction began on 7 July 1969.

The addition is from Leopoldplatz to Osloer Straße. It was opened on 30 April 1976, construction began on 6 November 1969. Since this was not feasible but due to the political situation, they let the U9 only to cross Osloer Straße/Swedener Straße construct. They were provided for two new stations: Nauener Platz, Turmstraße, and Osloer Straße. Until then, the U8 can be extended. This resulted in the situation that this tower station could be built without regard to existing underground services. It has also helped build a spacious, bright basement distribution, in which there are several shops and snack bars.

==Planned extensions==

The route was suggested to go via Holzstraße, Wollankstraße and will be divided into two options:
*Going to Pankow Kirche, it will be via Rathaus Pankow, Pankow Kirche, Hadlichestraße and towards Quartier am Pankower Tor
*Going to Pankow, it will be via Florapromenade, Pankow, Neumannstraße and towards Quartier am Pankower Tor
All planned extensions were abandoned due to low patronage.

<text>Rugby railway station serves the market town of Rugby in Warwickshire, England. The current station dates from 1885; two previous stations dating from 1838 and 1840 respectively, existed at locations to the west of the current one. It has been Rugby&#x27;s only station, since the closure of the former station in 1969, on the now-abandoned Great Central Main Line route through the town. Between 1950 and 1970, the station was known as Rugby Midland before reverting to its original title. The station underwent an extensive remodelling between 2006 and 2008; new platforms were added and a new ticket office and entrance building were constructed. The original Victorian part of the station was retained in the upgrade.

Rugby Station is at the centre of two important junctions of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) connecting London to Birmingham, North West England, and Scotland. The junction between the Trent Valley line to the North West and the Rugby–Birmingham–Stafford line to Birmingham is a short distance west of the station. East of the station, the Northampton loop diverges at a junction from the direct line to London. Until the 1960s, it also had routes to , and but these have all since been closed.

The present station, managed by Avanti West Coast, is located roughly half a mile north of Rugby town centre. On the WCML as a whole, it is located north of London Euston and south of .

== Current services ==

Inter-city train services are operated by Avanti West Coast, with off peak services to London, Birmingham New Street, , , and and morning peak and evening peak services to/from , , , , and .

West Midlands Trains operate frequent regional services under the &quot;London Northwestern Railway&quot; branding between London Euston, Northampton and Birmingham New Street along with services between London Euston, Stafford and Crewe (via the Trent Valley line).

Off-peak weekday service in trains per hour (tph) is:

*London Northwestern Railway:
** 3tph to London Euston, two semi-fast via and one express service calling at only.
** 2tph to , both semi-fast
** 1tph to via and Stafford.

* Avanti West Coast:

==Railway lines served==
===West Coast Main Line===
Since the 1960s, Rugby is served only by the West Coast Main Line. However, as the WCML divides here on either side of the station, it provides an interchange between the routes and consequently many trains stop here.

In the chainage notation traditionally used on the railway, the station is from Euston.

====Hillmorton Junction====
To the southeast of the station, the original London and Birmingham Railway (L&amp;BR) line (opened 1838), which runs directly to London, is joined at a grade separated junction near Hillmorton by the Northampton loop (opened 1881) which runs to before rejoining the line to London at Hanslope Junction. This junction is from Euston.

====Trent Valley Junction====
To the northwest of the station the WCML diverges again between the original London and Birmingham line, now referred to as the Birmingham Loop, which runs westwards to and Birmingham, and the Trent Valley line (opened 1847) which diverges at a flyover junction northwestwards towards and the North West of England and Scotland. It is from Euston.

===Closed Lines===

Until the 1960s Rugby station served several other railway lines, which were closed mostly as part of the Beeching Axe. At one time railway lines diverged from Rugby station in seven different directions. The closed lines were:

*The Midland Counties Railway (later Midland Railway) line to and the East Midlands which opened in 1840. In the mid-19th century this was an important main line, as the junction at Rugby provided the Midland Railway with its only link to London. Nearly all rail traffic between London and the north passed through Rugby, making it one of the most important railway junctions in the country. Increasing congestion at Rugby meant that Midland Railway opened its route from Leicester to London in the late 1860s. The Leicester to Rugby line lost its earlier importance, and became little more than a country branch line, it continued to operate as such for nearly a century until it was closed on 30 December 1961. A remaining relic of this line locally is the disused viaduct across the Avon valley, which is a local landmark.
*The Rugby and Stamford Railway which was a secondary cross-country line owned by the London and North Western Railway which ran from Rugby to Peterborough via . The line was opened on 29 April 1850. It originally ran to Stamford where it joined the Midland Railway&#x27;s Syston and Peterborough Railway. But later on, in order to gain a more direct route, the LNWR gained permission to build a line from to the Northampton and Peterborough Railway near Wansford, part of which survives as the Nene Valley Railway. Traffic was never heavy, and Doctor Beeching viewed it as an unnecessary duplication of the Birmingham to Peterborough Line and it was closed on 6 June 1966.
*The Rugby to Leamington Line which was a country branch line to Leamington Spa which was opened on 1 March 1851. Local passenger services were withdrawn in 1959, and the line closed as a through route in 1966.

The Great Central Main Line (GCML) also ran through the town and had its own station at , but as this was built by a rival company, it never had any connection to the other railways in Rugby. It was opened in 1899 and closed between 1966 and 1969.

==Layout==
Rugby station has a total of six platforms, consisting of five through platforms (platforms 1, 2, 4, 5 &amp; 6) and one east facing bay platform (platform 3) which is not in regular use. Platform 1 on the south of the station is a side platform, to its north are two island platforms which contain platforms 2,3 &amp; 4 and 5 &amp; 6 respectively. The platforms are above street level on a brick embankment, and are accessed from a subway via ramps stairs and lifts, except platform 1 which is accessed by stairs and a lift directly from the ticket office. The main entrance and ticket office is on the south side facing the town centre, with a secondary subway entrance to the north.

Between 1885 and 2008, Rugby station consisted of one large island platform, containing only two through platforms which are now platforms 2 and 4. The through platforms were long enough however to allow two trains to call at them at the same time, a feature enabled by scissors crossovers at the midway point of the platforms; this practice was abandoned in the 1960s when the crossovers were removed. At each end were bay platforms, four west facing, and two east facing: The bay platforms historically accommodated the various terminating branch line and local services, but had become largely redundant when these services were withdrawn. All but one of the bay platforms were removed during the 2008 remodelling, and the extra through platforms were added.

== History ==

===First station (1838–40)===
The first railway station to be built in Rugby was a wooden temporary structure located around half a mile to the west of the present station. It opened on 9 April 1838 when the London and Birmingham Railway was constructed. However great difficulty in constructing the Kilsby Tunnel in Northamptonshire delayed the full opening of the line, which was not finished in time for the coronation of Queen Victoria on 28 June 1838. Aware of the lucrative traffic the event would generate, the company opened the north end of the line, between Birmingham and Rugby, and the south end from London to a temporary station at near Bletchley, with a stagecoach shuttle service linking the two parts to allow through journeys to London. The line was officially fully opened on 17 September 1838, with the first passenger train from London to Birmingham arriving that day. 

At the time of the railway&#x27;s construction, Rugby was a small market town of around 2,500 inhabitants, notable only for its school. The town was around half a mile to the south, uphill from the station, which at the time was located in open countryside. The original station was located on the western side of where the railway crossed &quot;Newbold Road&quot; (the Rugby to Leicester turnpike road, now the A426) because at the time this was the only road north from Rugby.

===Second station (1840–1885)===
The first station lasted only a few years. When a junction was made with the Midland Counties Railway in 1840, a new station was built at the site of the junction, which opened on 4 July 1840; it was to the east of the original station, and to the west of the present station. A new road, &quot;Railway Terrace&quot; had to be built to link it to the town centre, because at the time it was located in open countryside.

This second station was effectively managed by two companies – the London and North Western Railway and the Midland Railway – and for this reason grew up in a haphazard fashion. It was at first no more than a temporary wooden structure, but was gradually rebuilt into a more permanent structure over the following decade. This station consisted of platforms at each side of the track with one bay platform. The platforms were rather low and passengers complained of having to perform an &quot;acrobatic feat&quot; to board trains.

The station was at the centre of a busy junction and often saw chaotic scenes. It featured, only lightly disguised, in Charles Dickens&#x27;s story &quot;Mugby Junction&quot;: This was inspired by an incident in April 1866, when Charles Dickens was travelling from London to Liverpool. Dickens&#x27;s train made an unscheduled stop at Rugby due to one of the carriages catching fire. While waiting for his journey to resume, he went into the refreshment room for a cup of coffee, and the proprietess, clearly not recognising the celebrity author, treated him rudely. Inspired by this, his story &#x27;Mugby Junction&#x27; in chapter three made a scathing attack on railway refreshment rooms and their staff.

=== The present station (1885–) ===
The second station lasted until the 1880s, when a new line from Rugby to Northampton (the Northampton loop) was built, the old station was deemed by the LNWR to be no-longer satisfactory, and in 1882, £70,000 was allocated to replace it with the current station which opened on 5 July 1885. Another £30,000 was allocated to build a hotel, although this was never built.
The Midland Railway retained the part of the older station which it had managed, however. One platform of the old station, separate from the new station, continued to be used by local trains on the Midland Railway&#x27;s branch to Leicester until 8 March 1930. No trace of this now remains, however, as it was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the postal sorting office.

When constructed the station consisted of one large island platform with bay platforms at each end for terminating local services. The main island platforms are accessed from a tunnel at road level and a ramp leading to the platforms. When constructed the station had a large steel and glass trainshed roof which consisted of 117 ft (35.6 m) wide spans on each side, covering the station platforms and tracks. Originally the sides of the station had glass side screens but these were later removed. The condition of the roof deteriorated, and in the 1980s the glass over the tracks was removed, and finally the entire structure was dismantled between 2000 and 2002 when it became unstable, and was replaced with modern canopies over the platforms.

The station had one of the longest platforms of any British railway station, at , but the two main island platforms were both shortened as part of the 2007–08 station upgrade. The platform was long enough to allow two trains to call at it at the same time. This unusual feature was enabled by &#x27;scissors crossings&#x27; halfway along the platforms. The scissor crossings were X-shaped junctions which allowed one train to pass another one already in the platform, and call into the same platform ahead of it, and allowed the train to the rear to pull out of the station, effectively doubling the capacity of the platform. The scissor crossings remained in use until the railway was electrified in the 1960s.

In 1899 a second station, , was opened in Rugby. To distinguish it from the other station, the present station became known as Rugby Midland. Rugby Central closed in 1969, and Rugby Midland reverted to being called just Rugby in 1970.

The station came under the management of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) (1885–1923), and then the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) (1923–1948), and then the nationalised British Railways (1948–1997). It is now owned by Network Rail.

==== 2006–2008 remodelling ====
As a part of the West Coast Main Line modernisation programme carried out by Network Rail, major track restructuring work was carried out to allow higher speed running through Rugby. Previously non-stopping trains passing through Rugby were limited to 75 mph, the track upgrades raised the speed to 125 mph, thus eliminating another bottleneck from the WCML. The station itself also underwent a major £170 million redevelopment which included:

*The addition of three new through platforms, bringing the total up to five, including a new platform on the south side of the station and a second island platform on the north side.
*The construction of a new entrance building and ticket office: Historically all of the station&#x27;s facilities, including the ticket office were concentrated on the station&#x27;s single island platform, which was accessed from street level by a subway. The main entrance to the station therefore consisted of a simple opening to the subway. The additional platforms required that the ticket office be moved to a new entrance building at the front of the station.

It was at one time thought that remodelling of the track layout would entail complete demolition of the present station, but the final plans involved retention of the existing island platform and buildings. Work began in September 2006 and was completed late in 2008.

The platform on the south side of the station opened for use on 29 May 2007, and as a result all of the platforms were renumbered. This platform became Platform 1, the former Platform 1 became Platform 2 and 2 became 4. The additional platforms on the north side of the station are numbered Platforms 5 and 6 and they opened on 27 August 2008. Platform 8 became Platform 3. At the same time four former westbound bay platforms originally numbered 3 to 6, and one eastbound bay numbered 7 were removed.

Another distinctive feature of the local railway landscape also vanished at this time – the &#x27;. This was a &#x27;heavy&#x27; girder bridge of two substantial spans over the West Coast Main Line to the east (&#x27;up&#x27; side) of the station. This was the means by which the Great Central Main Line crossed the London &amp; North Western Railway competing line.
=== Signalling ===

Rugby once had the largest concentration of mechanical signalling in the world and was home to one of the most impressive signal gantries in Britain. Situated to the south of the station and erected in 1895, it spanned three tracks and carried forty-four semaphore arms. Every arm was duplicated due to sighting difficulties that resulted from the Great Central Railway&#x27;s &#x27;Birdcage&#x27; bridge crossing the WCML behind the gantry&#x27;s location. The gantry acquired the nickname of &quot;the Rugby Bedstead&quot; on account of its appearance.

In 1939, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway resignalled the Rugby area with colour light signals, although the mechanical signal boxes were retained. The famous signal gantry became redundant, following which it was divided up into smaller pieces to form a number of smaller structures for re-use elsewhere.

SGE was awarded a contract to resignal the Rugby area in preparation for electrification. Rugby Power Signal Box (PSB) opened in 1964. It is located east of the station, on the south (Down) side of the railway. The whole station area, together with part of the WCML stretching as far south as Castlethorpe, was controlled from this new box. It was equipped with an &#x27;NX&#x27; (entrance-exit) panel. In 1991, Rugby PSB took over control of the Northampton area using Solid State Interlocking (SSI). Rugby PSB closed in May 2012 when control of Northampton was transferred to Rugby SCC.

Rugby Signalling Control Centre (SCC), located north-west of the station, opened in 2004. Initially, its area of control was limited to a portion of the WCML between Kings Langley and Linslade Tunnel. The current area of control is Kings Langley, Hertfordshire to Armitage in Staffordshire. Area of control also includes small portions of branch lines around Nuneaton; these include the Coventry-Nuneaton (from Three Spires to Nuneaton) and part of the Arley/Hinckley lines (Arley Tunnel to Padge Hall). In March 2016, the WCML South Rail Operating Centre (ROC) was opened at Rugby – this will supervise the signalling on the entire southern end of the WCML and associated branch routes.

===Motive Power Depots===

A shed for three locomotives was opened here in 1838 by the London and Birmingham Railway and another in 1847. These were demolished to make way for two larger sheds in 1852, one for the use of the Northern Division locomotives and one by the Southern Division. The LNWR replaced these with a single 12-road shed in 1876, which was closed in 1965, but used for stabling diesel shunters. An adjoining 12-road shed was opened in 1886, but was closed and demolished by British Railways in 1960.

== Connections ==
Bus route 4, operated by Stagecoach Midlands, connects the railway station with Rugby town centre and the suburbs of Cawston and Bilton.

Bus route D1 and D2, operated by Stagecoach Midlands, previously connected the railway station with Rugby town centre, now replaced on this section by services 1 and 2, which connects with buses D1 and D2 to the suburbs of Barby, Braunston, Brownsover, DIRFT, Hillmorton, and Kilsby. The service then continues onto serve the nearby town of Daventry.

<text>The S1 is a railway service of the Berlin S-Bahn that operates between and .

== Operations ==
The southern end of the line is at , on the Wannsee Railway. Trains run north over that line to Anhalter Bahnhof where they enter the Berlin Nord-Süd Tunnel, exiting at Berlin Nordbahnhof. Between Berlin Nordbahnhof and trains use the Berlin-Szczecin railway. Finally, trains use the southern end of the Berlin Northern Railway between Bornholmer Straße and .

 the S1 operates every 10 minutes between Wannsee and and every 20 minutes between Frohnau and Oranienburg.

Since becoming a numbered route in 1984, the S1&#x27;s line colour is pink.

==Service history==

The S1 was created along with the S2 and S3 on 9 January 1984, when the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) took over the S-Bahn network from the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn in West Berlin: however, the dilapidated state of the West Berlin network at the time meant that the first S1 trains did not run until 1 May 1985, when the line between Wannsee and Anhalter Bahnhof reopened.

In 1990, the S1 was extended to Frohnau, while the S2 was curtailed to Gesundbrunnen. It was extended to its present northern terminus of Oranienburg on 31 May 1992, after the reopening of the Berlin Northern Railway between Frohnau and .

<text>S2 is a line on the Berlin S-Bahn. It operates from Bernau to Blankenfelde over:
*the Berlin-Szczecin railway, opened on 1 August 1842 and electrified on 8 August 1924,
*the Nord-Süd-Tunnel, opened on 28 May 1936 from Humboldthain to Unter den Linden and on 6 November 1939 to Anhalter Bahnhof and Priesterweg
*the Berlin–Dresden railway, opened on 17 June 1875 and electrified on 15 May 1933.

Since becoming a numbered route in 1984, the S2&#x27;s line colour is green.

==Service history==

The S2 was created along with the S1 and S3 on 9 January 1984, when the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) took over the S-Bahn network from the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn in West Berlin: the S2 initially ran between Lichtenrade and Anhalter Bahnhof, before being extended northwards to Gesundbrunnen on 1 May 1984, and Frohnau on 1 October 1984.

In 1990, the S1 replaced the S2 between Gesundbrunnen and Frohnau.

<text>S3 is a line on the Berlin S-Bahn. It operates from Erkner to Spandau. For most of its existence since becoming a numbered route in 1984, the S3&#x27;s line colour is blue.

S3 originally was shortened to Ostbahnhof from 2003 to 2009 while awaiting renovation works. To compensate for the diminished throughput on the Stadtbahn, the (formerly Erkner ↔ Ostbahnhof) was extended westwards to Spandau. Then, it temporarily shortened to Ostkreuz.

==Service history==

The S3 was created along with the S1 and S2 on 9 January 1984, when the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) took over the S-Bahn network from the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) in West Berlin: the S3 initially ran between Friedrichstraße and Charlottenburg, before being extended south-westwards to Wannsee on 1 May 1984.

Due to the reunification of Germany, the S3 briefly became a four-coloured line on 1 July 1990, absorbing the DR S-Bahn services formerly terminating at Friedrichstraße to (orange), (yellow), (green), and Flughafen Berlin Schönefeld (sky blue, now BER Airport – Terminal 5). On 2 June 1991, the S3 was broken-up into the following lines:

Richardson died in 2009 from a head injury after a skiing accident in Quebec.

==Early life==
Natasha Jane Richardson was born in Marylebone, London on 11 May 1963, a member of the Redgrave family, known as a theatrical and film acting dynasty. She was the daughter of director and producer Tony Richardson and actress Vanessa Redgrave, granddaughter of actors Sir Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson, sister of Joely Richardson, half-sister of Carlo Gabriel Nero and Katharine Grimond Hess, niece of actress Lynn Redgrave and actor Corin Redgrave, and cousin of Jemma Redgrave.

Richardson&#x27;s parents divorced in 1967. The following year, she made her film debut at the age of four in an uncredited role in &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, directed by her father.

Richardson was educated in London at two private schools, the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle in South Kensington and St. Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School in Hammersmith, before training at the Central School of Speech and Drama.

==Career==

===Theatre===

Richardson began her career in regional theatre at Leeds Playhouse, and in 1984 at the Open Air Theatre in London&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park, when Richardson appeared in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; with Ralph Fiennes and Richard E. Grant. Her first professional work in London&#x27;s West End was in a revival of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; in 1985. This production also featured her mother, Vanessa Redgrave. Soon afterward, Richardson starred in a London stage production of &quot;High Society&quot;, adapted from the Cole Porter film. She made her Broadway debut in 1993, in the title role of &quot;Anna Christie&quot;, which is where Richardson met future husband Liam Neeson and was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play at the 47th Tony Awards. In 1998, Richardson played the role of Sally Bowles in Sam Mendes&#x27; revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; on Broadway, for which she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical at the 52nd Tony Awards. The following year, Richardson returned to Broadway in &quot;Closer&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play, and in 2005 Richardson appeared again with the Roundabout, this time as Blanche DuBois in the revival of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, opposite John C. Reilly as Stanley Kowalski. In January 2009, two months before her death, Richardson played the role of Desirée Armfeldt in a concert production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;, with her mother Vanessa Redgrave, who played Madame Armfeldt. At the time of Richardson&#x27;s death, the pair were preparing to co-star in a Broadway revival of the musical.

===Film===

In 1984, Richardson made her first credited screen appearance as an art tutor in the James Scott-directed &quot;Every Picture Tells A Story&quot;, based on the early life of the painter William Scott. Richardson later starred as Mary Shelley in the 1986 film &quot;Gothic&quot;, a fictionalised account of the author&#x27;s creation of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. The following year, Richardson starred with Kenneth Branagh and Colin Firth in &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;, directed by Pat O&#x27;Connor. Director Paul Schrader signed Richardson for the title role of Patty Hearst in the 1988 docudrama film &quot;Patty Hearst&quot; about the heiress and her kidnapping. Richardson&#x27;s performances with Robert Duvall and Faye Dunaway in &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; and Christopher Walken, Rupert Everett and Helen Mirren in &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot; (directed by Schrader) won her the 1990 &quot;Evening Standard&quot; British Film Award for Best Actress. In 1991, Richardson appeared in &quot;The Favour, the Watch and the Very Big Fish&quot; with Bob Hoskins. He later credited her with giving him the best kiss of his life during the film. &quot;She got hold of me and kissed me like I&#x27;ve never been kissed before. I was gobsmacked.&quot;

Richardson was named Best Actress at the 1994 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival for &quot;Widows&#x27; Peak&quot; and that same year appeared in &quot;Nell&quot; with Jodie Foster and future husband Liam Neeson. She appeared in the Disney film remake &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; in 1998 alongside Dennis Quaid, as Elizabeth James, the divorced mother of Lindsay Lohan&#x27;s characters Hallie Parker and Annie James. Additional film credits include &quot;Blow Dry&quot; (2001), &quot;Chelsea Walls&quot; (2001), &quot;Waking Up in Reno&quot; (2002), &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot; (2002), &quot;Asylum&quot; (2005), which won Richardson a second &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Award for Best Actress, &quot;The White Countess&quot; (2005), and &quot;Evening&quot; (2007). Her last screen appearance was as Mrs. Kingsley, the headmistress of a girls&#x27; school in the 2008 comedy &quot;Wild Child&quot;. During the last week of January 2009, Richardson recorded her offscreen role as Ruth Mallory, the wife of climber George Mallory, who disappeared while climbing Mount Everest during a 1924 expedition, in the 2010 documentary film &quot;The Wildest Dream&quot;, for which Liam Neeson provided narration. Director Anthony Geffen described listening to the film since her death as &quot;harrowing&quot;.

===Television===
Richardson made her American television debut in a small role in the 1984 miniseries &quot;Ellis Island&quot;. That same year, Richardson made her British television debut in an episode of the BBC series &quot;Oxbridge Blues&quot;. The following year, Richardson appeared as Violet Hunter with Jeremy Brett and David Burke in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in the episode entitled &quot;The Copper Beeches.&quot; Richardson starred with Judi Dench, Michael Gambon and Kenneth Branagh in a 1987 BBC adaptation of the Henrik Ibsen play &quot;Ghosts&quot;; with Maggie Smith and Rob Lowe in a 1993 BBC adaptation of &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot; by Tennessee Williams; as Zelda Fitzgerald in the 1993 television movie &quot;Zelda&quot;; &quot;Haven&quot; (2001) on CBS and &quot;The Mastersons of Manhattan&quot; (2007) on NBC. Richardson appeared as a celebrity judge on &quot;Top Chef&quot;, season 5.

==Personal life==
Richardson&#x27;s first marriage was to filmmaker Robert Fox, whom she had met in 1985, during the making of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot;; they were married from 1990 to 1992. Richardson then met actor Liam Neeson while performing in a revival of the play &quot;Anna Christie&quot; on Broadway in 1993. Richardson married Neeson in the summer of 1994 at the home they shared in Millbrook, New York; she had become a naturalised American citizen. Richardson had two sons with Neeson: Micheál and Daniel.

Richardson helped raise millions of dollars in the fight against AIDS; her father Tony Richardson had died of AIDS-related causes in 1991. She was also actively involved in AmfAR, becoming a board member in 2006 and participating in many other AIDS charities, including Bailey House, God&#x27;s Love We Deliver, Mothers&#x27; Voices, AIDS Crisis Trust and National AIDS Trust, for which Richardson was an ambassador. She received AmfAR&#x27;s Award of Courage in November 2000.

Richardson was a smoker. Although she had reportedly quit smoking, she was a critic of the ban on smoking in New York City restaurants.

==Death and funeral==
On 16 March 2009, Richardson sustained a head injury when she fell while taking a beginner skiing lesson at the Mont Tremblant Resort, about from Montreal. At first, she refused any medical help but complained of a severe headache about two hours after the accident. Richardson was flown to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, where she died two days later from an epidural hematoma. Her family issued a statement on the day of her death: &quot;Liam Neeson, his sons, and the entire family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Natasha. They are profoundly grateful for the support, love, and prayers of everyone, and ask for privacy during this very difficult time.&quot; Neeson donated Richardson&#x27;s organs following her death.

On 18 March 2009, theatre lights were dimmed on Broadway in Manhattan and in the West End of London as a mark of respect for Richardson. The following day, a private viewing was held at the American Irish Historical Society in Manhattan. On 22 March, a private funeral was held at St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church near Millbrook, New York, close to the family&#x27;s upstate home. Richardson was buried near her maternal grandmother Rachel Kempson in the churchyard. Her aunt, Lynn Redgrave, was buried in the same churchyard on 8 May 2010, near Richardson and Kempson. The 2015 biographical thriller &quot;Everest&quot; was later dedicated to her.

<text>Silybum (milk thistle) is a genus of two species of thistles in the family Asteraceae. The plants are native to the Mediterranean regions of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. One species has been introduced elsewhere, including in North America. The name &quot;milk thistle&quot; derives from a feature of the leaves, which are prominently banded with splashes of white. Historically, these milky bands were said to be Mother Mary&#x27;s milk, and this is the origin of another common name, St. Mary&#x27;s thistle. The most widespread species is &quot;Silybum marianum&quot;.

Claims have been made since ancient times that the active flavanoid-lignan (flavanolignan) group of constituents, called silymarin, contained only in the seed shell has liver-protective and regenerative properties, as well as antioxidant effects. Chemical, pharmacological, and safety research started in Germany in the 1950s.

== Description and classification ==

Members of this genus grow as annual or biennial plants. The erect stem is tall, branched and furrowed but not spiny. The large, alternate leaves are waxy-lobed, toothed and thorny, as in other genera of thistle. The lower leaves are sessile (attached to the stem without petiole). The upper leaves have a clasping base. They have large, disc-shaped pink-to-purple, rarely white, solitary flower heads at the end of the stem. The flowers consist of tubular florets. The phyllaries under the flowers occur in many rows, with the outer row with spine-tipped lobes and apical spines. The fruit is a black achene with a white pappus.

;Species and varieties
* &quot;Silybum eburneum&quot; Coss. &amp; Dur., known as the silver milk thistle, elephant thistle, or ivory thistle - Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Spain
** &quot;Silybum eburneum&quot; Coss. &amp; Dur. var. &quot;hispanicum&quot;
* &quot;Silybum marianum&quot; (L.) Gaertner, the blessed milk thistle, which has a large number of other common names, such as variegated thistle. - widespread across much of Europe, Asia, and North Africa from Norway and the Canary Islands to China and Maluku; naturalized in Australia, New Zealand, and the Americas
The two species hybridise naturally, the hybrid being known as &quot;Silybum × gonzaloi&quot; Cantó, Sánchez Mata &amp; Rivas Mart. (&quot;S. eburneum&quot; var. &quot;hispanicum&quot; x &quot;S. marianum&quot;)
;formerly included
* &quot;Silybum atriplicifolium - Synurus deltoides&quot; 
* &quot;Silybum cernuum - Alfredia cernua&quot;

&quot;Silybum marianum&quot; is by far the more widely known species. Milk thistle is believed to give some remedy for liver diseases (e.g. viral hepatitis) and the extract, silymarin, is used in medicine. Mild gastrointestinal distress is the most common adverse event reported for milk thistle. The incidence is the same as for placebo. A laxative effect for milk thistle has also been reported infrequently.

== Claims of health benefits ==

For many centuries extracts of milk thistle have been recognized as &quot;liver tonics.&quot; Milk thistle has been reported to have protective effects on the liver and to greatly improve its function. It is typically used to treat liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis (liver inflammation), toxin-induced liver damage including the prevention of severe liver damage from &quot;Amanita phalloides&quot; (&#x27;death cap&#x27; mushroom poisoning), and gallbladder disorders.

Reviews of the literature covering clinical studies of silymarin vary in their conclusions.

<doc id="594681" wikidata="Q1366779" url="?curid=594681" title="Hawker Sea Fury">
<text>The Hawker Sea Fury is a British fighter aircraft designed and manufactured by Hawker Aircraft. It was the last propeller-driven fighter to serve with the Royal Navy. Developed during the Second World War, the Sea Fury entered service two years after the war ended. It proved to be a popular aircraft with a number of overseas militaries and was used during the Korean War in the early 1950s, and by the Cuban air force during the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion.

The Sea Fury&#x27;s development was formally initiated in 1943 in response to a wartime requirement of the Royal Air Force (RAF), with the aircraft first named Fury. As the Second World War drew to a close, the RAF cancelled their order for the aircraft. The Royal Navy saw the type as a suitable carrier aircraft to replace a range of obsolescent and stop-gap aircraft being operated by the Fleet Air Arm. Development of the Sea Fury proceeded, and the type entered operational service in 1947.

The Sea Fury has many design similarities to Hawker&#x27;s preceding Tempest fighter, having originated from a requirement for a &quot;Light Tempest Fighter&quot;. The Sea Fury&#x27;s wings and fuselage originated from the Tempest but were significantly modified. The production Sea Fury was fitted with the powerful Bristol Centaurus engine and armed with four wing-mounted Hispano V cannon. While originally developed as a pure aerial fighter aircraft, the definitive Sea Fury FB.11 was a fighter-bomber.

The Sea Fury attracted international orders as a carrier and land-based aircraft. It was operated by countries including Australia, Burma, Canada, Cuba, Egypt, West Germany, Iraq, and Pakistan. The type acquitted itself well in the Korean War, fighting effectively even against the MiG-15 jet fighter. Although the Sea Fury was retired by the majority of its military operators in the late 1950s in favour of jet-propelled aircraft, a considerable number of aircraft saw use in the civil sector, and several remain airworthy in the 21st century as heritage and racing aircraft.

==Development==
===Origins===

The Hawker Fury was an evolutionary successor to the successful Hawker Typhoon and Tempest fighters and fighter-bombers of the Second World War. The Fury&#x27;s design process was initiated in September 1942 by Sydney Camm, one of Hawker&#x27;s foremost aircraft designers, to meet the Royal Air Force&#x27;s requirement for a lightweight Tempest Mk II replacement; the Tempest, while a successful aircraft, had been viewed as being heavy and oversized for typical fighter duties. Developed as the &quot;Tempest Light Fighter (Centaurus)&quot;, the semi-elliptical wing of the Tempest was incorporated but was shortened in span by eliminating the central bay of the wing centre-section, the inner part of the undercarriage wells now extending almost to the aircraft centreline, instead of being situated level with the fuselage sides. The fuselage was broadly similar in form to that of the Tempest, but was a fully monocoque structure, while the cockpit level was higher, affording the pilot better all-round visibility.

The project was formalised in January 1943 when the Air Ministry issued Specification F.2/42 around the &quot;Tempest Light Fighter&quot;. This was followed up by Specification F.2/43, issued in May 1943, which required a high rate of climb of not less than 4,500 ft/min (23 m/s) from ground level to 20,000 feet (6,096 m), good fighting manoeuvrability and a maximum speed of at least 450 mph (724 km/h) at 22,000 feet (6,705 m). The armament was to be four 20mm Hispano V cannon with a total capacity of 600 rounds, plus the capability of carrying two bombs each up to 1,000 pounds (454 kg). In April 1943, Hawker had also received Specification N.7/43 from the Admiralty, who sought a navalised version of the developing aircraft; in response, Sidney Camm proposed the consolidation of both services&#x27; requirements under Specification F.2/43, with the alterations required for naval operations issued on a supplemental basis. Around 1944, the aircraft project finally received its name; the Royal Air Force&#x27;s version becoming known as the Fury and the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s version as the Sea Fury.

Six prototypes were ordered; two were to be powered by Rolls-Royce Griffon engines, two with Centaurus XXIIs, one with a Centaurus XII and one as a test structure. Hawker used the internal designations P.1019 and P.1020 respectively for the Griffon and Centaurus versions, while P.1018 was also used for a Fury prototype which was to use a Napier Sabre IV. The first Fury to fly, on 1 September 1944, was &quot;NX798&quot; with a Centaurus XII with rigid engine mounts, powering a Rotol four-blade propeller. Second on 27 November 1944 was &quot;LA610&quot;, which had a Griffon 85 and Rotol six-blade contra-rotating propeller. By now, development of the Fury and Sea Fury was closely interlinked so that the next prototype to fly was a Sea Fury, &quot;SR661&quot;, described under &quot;Naval version.&quot; &quot;NX802&quot; (25 July 1945) was the last Fury prototype, powered by a Centaurus XV. &quot;LA610&quot; was eventually fitted with a Napier Sabre VII, which was capable of developing 3,400 to 4,000 hp (2,535–2,983 kW); this aircraft became possibly the fastest reciprocating-engine Hawker aircraft after reaching a speed of around 485 mph (780 km/h).

===Naval version===

With the end of the Second World War in Europe in sight, the RAF began cancelling many aircraft orders; the RAF&#x27;s order for the Fury was cancelled before any production aircraft were built because the RAF already had large numbers of late Mark Spitfires and Tempests and viewed the Fury as an unnecessary overlap with these aircraft. Although the RAF had pulled out of the programme, development of the type continued as the Sea Fury. Many of the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s carrier fighters were Seafires and Lend-Lease Corsairs. The Seafire had considerable drawbacks as a naval aircraft, notably the narrow undercarriage, while the Corsairs had to be returned or purchased. The Admiralty opted to procure the Sea Fury as the successor to these aircraft.

While the RAF contract had been cancelled, the Fury prototypes were completed and used for work in developing the Sea Fury as well as for the export market. The first Sea Fury prototype, &quot;SR661&quot;, first flew at Langley, Berkshire, on 21 February 1945, powered by a Centaurus XII engine. This prototype had a &quot;stinger&quot;-type tailhook for arrested carrier landings but lacked folding wings for storage. &quot;SR666&quot;, the second prototype, which flew on 12 October 1945, was powered by a Bristol Centaurus XV that turned a new, five-bladed Rotol propeller and had folding wings. Specification N.7/43 was modified to N.22/43, now representing an order for 200 aircraft. Of these, 100 were to be built at Boulton-Paul&#x27;s Wolverhampton factory.

In 1945, the original order to specification N.22/43 was reduced to 100 aircraft; as a result, the manufacturing agreement with Boulton-Paul was ended and all work on the Sea Fury was transferred to Hawker Aircraft&#x27;s facilities at Kingston. This included the construction of what was intended to be a Boulton-Paul built Sea Fury prototype, &quot;VB857&quot;, which was transported to Kingston in January 1945; this aircraft, built to the same standard as &quot;SR666&quot;, first flew on 31 January 1946. Immediately upon completion of the first three airframes, the flight testing programme began at Kingston. It was soon discovered that the early Centaurus engine suffered frequent crankshaft failure due to a poorly designed lubrication system, which led to incidents of the engine seizing while in mid-flight. The problem was resolved when Bristol&#x27;s improved Centaurus 18 engine replaced the earlier engine variant.

===Into production===
The first production model, the Sea Fury F Mk X (later Sea Fury F.10), flew in September 1946. With the completion of flight testing at Boscombe Down in 1946, the trials process was repeated aboard the aircraft carrier . Carrier testing revealed directional stability issues related to rudder effectiveness during landing, and this was resolved by the adoption of a tailwheel lock, which also improved the wheel retraction behaviour. Several rectifying design changes were made by Hawker in response to feedback from the test pilots, including the adoption of a five-bladed Rotol propeller to greatly reduce overspeed tendencies; a re-designed rudder assembly, to increase rudder effectiveness; Dynafocal engine mountings to reduce vibration at low speeds, and an improved undercarriage with greater flexibility. These changes greatly improved the aircraft&#x27;s deck landing characteristics. Arrestor hook trials initially revealed the Sea Fury to be prone to missing the wires; this was rapidly resolved by modifications to the hook dampener mechanism.

By March 1947 production Sea Furies were being produced for the Fleet Air Arm. The fourth and sixth production aircraft were used in further trials with HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot;; the main change from the earlier aircraft was the adoption of a longer, stiffer arrestor hook. Fifty Mk X Sea Furies were produced. These were identical to the &quot;SR666&quot; prototype except for the Centaurus 18 engine and a four-bladed propeller. At least 20 of the 50 aircraft performed in the aircraft&#x27;s intensive trials programme. Following the successful completion of weapons trials at the A&amp;AEE Boscombe Down, the Sea Fury was cleared for operational use on 31 July 1947.

Hawker Aircraft continued to develop and refine the Sea Fury Mk X, resulting in the more capable Sea Fury Mk 11, also known as the Sea Fury FB.11. This upgraded model had several improvements, most notable being the hydraulically powered wing folding mechanism which eased flight deck operations and the adoption of new weapons for air-to-ground combat. Iraq ordered a two-seat Sea Fury model, and the British Admiralty followed suit. During testing, the rear canopy collapsed, leading to a redesign of the type&#x27;s two-seat cockpit before entering service. Designated as the Sea Fury T.20, a total of 60 trainers were manufactured for the Fleet Air Arm between 1950 and 1952. The Royal Navy bought a total of 615 Sea Furies, mostly of the Mk 11 standard.

===Export market===
Hawker Aircraft was keen to market the Sea Fury to foreign operators, and conducted an intense sales drive for their export version of the aircraft, designated Sea Fury F.50. On 21 October 1946, the Royal Netherlands Navy placed an order for ten F.50 aircraft, which were basically identical to the FAA&#x27;s Sea Fury Mk X aircraft, to equip the aircraft carrier HNLMS &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; (ex-HMS &quot;Nairana&quot;). The Dutch also ordered twelve of the later Fury FB.50s in 1948 and these were delivered in 1950. They were used on the aircraft carrier (ex-). A manufacturing licence was also acquired for the production of twenty-five Sea Fury FB.51s by Fokker Aircraft in the Netherlands, which were delivered from 1951 onwards.
The Sea Fury became an export success, being purchased both to operate on aircraft carriers and for purely land-based roles by a number of nations, including Australia, West Germany, Iraq, Egypt, Burma, Pakistan and Cuba. Several of the nations that did not have aircraft carriers often had the tail hooks and catapult hooks removed from their aircraft.

A final variant, the Sea Fury T.20S was developed by Hawker for West Germany as target tow aircraft; these remained in service into the 1970s. Upon the type&#x27;s withdrawal from military service, many Sea Furies were sold to private individuals, often as racing aircraft due to their high speed. The final production figures for all marks reached around 860 aircraft.

==Design==

The Sea Fury is a navalised aircraft, capable of operating from the aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy. It was heavily based on preceding Hawker fighter aircraft, particularly the Tempest; features such as the semi-elliptical wing and fuselage were derived directly from the Tempest but featured significant refinements, including significant strengthening to withstand the stresses of carrier landings. While the Sea Fury was lighter and smaller than the Tempest, advanced aspects of the Sea Fury&#x27;s design such as its Centaurus engine meant it was also considerably more powerful and faster, making it the final and fastest of Hawker&#x27;s reciprocating engine aircraft.

The Sea Fury Mk X was capable of attaining a maximum speed of 460 mph and climb to a height of 20,000 feet in under five minutes. The Sea Fury was reportedly a highly aerobatic aircraft with favourable flying behaviour at all heights and speeds, although intentional spinning of the aircraft was banned during the type&#x27;s military service. During flight displays, the Sea Fury could demonstrate its ability to perform rapid rolls at a rate of 100 degrees per second, attributed to the spring tab equipped ailerons. For extra thrust on takeoff Jet Assisted Take-Off (JATO) could be used.
The Sea Fury was powered by the newly developed Bristol Centaurus reciprocating engine, which drove a five-bladed propeller. Many of the engine&#x27;s subsystems, such as the fully automated cooling system, cockpit gauges, and fuel booster pump were electrical, powered by an engine-driven generator supplemented by two independent batteries. The hydraulic system, necessary to operate the retractable undercarriage, tail hook, and flaps, was pressurised to 1,800 psi by an engine-driven pump. If this failed, a hand pump in the cockpit could also power these systems. A pneumatic pump was driven by the engine for the brakes. Internal fuel was stored in a total of five self-sealing fuel tanks, two within the fuselage directly in front of the cockpit and three housed within the wings.

Various avionics systems were used on Sea Furies; in this respect, it was unusually well equipped for an aircraft of the era. Many aircraft were equipped with onboard radar, often the ARI 5307 ZBX, which could be directly integrated with a four-channel VHF radio system. Several of the navigational aids, such as the altimeter and G2F compass, were also advanced; many of these subsystems were used on subsequent jet aircraft with little or no alteration. Other aspects of the Sea Fury, such as the majority of the flight controls, were conventional. Some controls were electrically powered, such as the weapons controls, onboard cameras, and the gyro gunsight.

Although the Sea Fury had been originally developed as a pure air superiority fighter, the Royal Navy viewed the solid construction and payload capabilities of the airframe as positive attributes for ground attack as well; accordingly, Hawker tested and cleared the type to use a wide range of armaments and support equipment. Each aircraft had four wing-mounted 20 mm Hispano V cannon, and could carry up to 16 rockets, or a combination of 500 lb or 1000 lb bombs. Other loads included 1000 lb incendiary bombs, mines, type 2 smoke floats or 90-gallon fuel tanks. For photo reconnaissance missions the Sea Fury could be fitted with both vertical and oblique cameras, with a dedicated control box in the cockpit. Other ancillary equipment included chaff to evade hostile attack using radar, and flares.

==Operational history==

===United Kingdom===
778 Naval Air Squadron was the first unit of the Fleet Air Arm to receive the Sea Fury, with deliveries commencing in February 1947 to the squadron&#x27;s Intensive Flying Development Unit, while 787 Squadron, the Naval Air Fighting Development Squadron, received the Sea Fury in May that year. The first operational unit to be equipped with the Sea Fury was 803 Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Canadian Navy, which replaced Seafires with Sea Furies in August 1947, with 807 Naval Air Squadron was the first operational Royal Navy Sea Fury squadron when it received the aircraft in September that year. The Seafire was ill-suited to carrier use, as the pilot&#x27;s poor view of the deck and the aircraft&#x27;s narrow undercarriage made both landings and takeoffs difficult. Consequently, the Sea Fury F Mk X replaced the Seafire on most carriers. For some years the Sea Fury and Seafire operated alongside each other, with the shorter-range Seafire operating as a fleet defence fighter while the Sea Fury was employed as a longer-range fighter-bomber.

Sea Furies were issued to Nos. 736, 738, 759 and 778 Squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm. The F Mk X was followed by the Sea Fury FB.11 fighter-bomber variant, which eventually reached a production total of 650 aircraft. The Sea Fury remained the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s primary fighter-bomber until 1953, at which point jet-powered aircraft, such as the Hawker Sea Hawk and Supermarine Attacker, were introduced to operational service.

The Sea Fury FB.11 entered service with the fighter squadrons of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) in August 1951. The RNVR units also operated the Sea Fury T.20 two-seat trainer version from late 1950 to give reserve pilots experience on the type before relinquishing their Supermarine Seafire aircraft. RNVR units that were equipped with the Sea Fury were Nos. 1831, 1832, 1833, 1834, 1835 and 1836 Squadrons. No. 1832, based at RAF Benson, was the last RNVR squadron to relinquish the type in August 1955 for the jet-powered Supermarine Attacker.

====Korean War====
Following the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, Sea Furies were dispatched to the region as a part of the British Commonwealth Forces Korea, Britain&#x27;s contribution to the United Nations multinational task force to assist South Korea following an invasion by North Korea. Sea Furies were flown throughout the conflict, primarily as ground-attack aircraft, from the Royal Navy light fleet carriers , , , and the Australian carrier . After a Fleet Air Arm Seafire was shot down by a United States Air Force Boeing B-29 Superfortress on 28 July 1950, all Commonwealth aircraft were painted with black and white invasion stripes.

The first Sea Furies arrived with 807 Naval Air Squadron embarked on &quot;Theseus&quot;, which relieved in October 1950. Operations on &quot;Theseus&quot; were intense, and the Sea Furies of 807 Squadron flew a total of 264 combat sorties in October. During a brief rest period at the Japanese port of Iwakuni the catapult was found to be excessively worn, necessitating the launch of Sea Furies with RATOG assistance until it was repaired. In December 1950, Sea Furies conducted several strikes on bridges, airfields, and railways to disrupt North Korean logistics, flying a further 332 sorties without incurring any losses. At this early point in the war little aerial resistance was encountered and the biggest threats were ground-based anti-aircraft fire or technical problems.

In addition to their ground attack role, Sea Furies also performed air patrols. In this role, a total of 3,900 interceptions were carried out, although none of the intercepted aircraft turned out to be hostile. During the winter period, the Sea Furies were often called upon as spotter aircraft for UN artillery around Inchon, Wonsan, and Songiin. In April 1951, 804 Naval Air Squadron operating off &quot;Glory&quot;, replaced 807 Squadron, which in turn was replaced by &quot;Sydney&quot; in September 1951 with 805 and 808 Squadron RAN. The Australian carrier air group flew 2,366 combat sorties. In January 1952, &quot;Glory&quot; with 804 NAS returned to relieve &quot;Sydney&quot; following a refit in Australia. For the rest of the war &quot;Glory&quot; and &quot;Ocean&quot; relieved each other on duty.

In 1952, the first Chinese MiG-15 jet fighters appeared. On 8 August 1952, Lieutenant Peter &quot;Hoagy&quot; Carmichael, of 802 Squadron, flying Sea Fury &quot;WJ232&quot; from HMS &quot;Ocean&quot;, was credited with shooting down a MiG-15, marking him as one of only a few pilots of a propeller-driven aircraft to shoot down a jet during the Korean War. The engagement occurred when Sea Furies and Fireflies were bounced by eight MiG-15s, during which one Firefly was badly damaged while the Sea Furies escaped unharmed. Some sources claim that this is the only successful engagement by a British pilot in a British aircraft during the Korean War, although a few sources claim a second MiG was downed or damaged in the same action. The Royal Navy credited the kill to Lieutenant Peter &quot;Hoagy&quot; Carmichael although Carmichael always credited it to the whole flight. One of the other pilots in the flight Sub Lieutenant Brian &#x27;Smoo&#x27; Ellis has since claimed the kill for himself. He claims that he observed hitting the MiG-15 when it overshot his aircraft with its air brakes deployed. On the return journey to HMS Ocean, he states that Carmichael fired his guns at a sandbank on the coast which the squadron often used for practice or testing their cannons. On landing back at the carrier, he was surprised to find that the kill was awarded to Carmichael. After checking with the armaments officer, it was found that Ellis had used the entirety of his ammunition during the engagement, while Carmichael on the other hand still had 90% of his ammunition left. Because Carmichael fired at the sandbank on their return journey, this brings serious doubts over the claim that he shot down the MiG-15.

===Australia===

Australia was one of three Commonwealth nations to operate the Sea Fury, with the others being Canada and Pakistan. The type was operated by two frontline squadrons of the Royal Australian Navy, 805 Squadron and 808 Squadron; a third squadron that flew the Sea Fury, 850 Squadron, was also briefly active. Two Australian aircraft carriers, HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; and HMAS &quot;Vengeance&quot;, employed Sea Furies in their air wings. The Sea Fury was used by Australia during the Korean War, flying from carriers based along the Korean coast in support of friendly ground forces. The Sea Fury was operated by Australian forces between 1948 and 1962.

===Burma===
Between 1957 and 1958, Burma received 21 Sea Furies, the majority of them being ex-FAA aircraft. The Sea Fury was frequently employed as a counter-insurgency platform in Burmese service and on 15 February 1961, a Republic of China Air Force Consolidated PB4Y Privateer was intercepted and shot down by a Sea Fury near the Thai-Burmese border. Of the aircraft&#x27;s crew, five were killed and two were captured. The aircraft had been on a supply run to Chinese Kuomintang forces fighting in northern Burma. It is believed that the Burmese Sea Furies were retired in 1968, and replaced by armed Lockheed T-33 Shooting Stars.

===Canada===

The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) became a significant customer of the Sea Fury, and many of its aircraft were diverted from existing Royal Navy contracts. On 23 June 1948, the first aircraft was accepted at RCAF Rockcliffe. The type was quickly put to use replacing Canada&#x27;s existing inventory of Seafires, taking on the primary role of fleet air defence operating from the aircraft carrier . Two Canadian squadrons operated the Sea Fury, Nos. 803 and 883 Squadrons, which were later renumbered as 870 and 871. Pilot training on the Sea Fury was normally conducted at the RCN&#x27;s HMCS &quot;Shearwater&quot; land base. Landing difficulties with the Sea Fury were experienced following the RCN&#x27;s decision to convert to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s deck landing procedures, which were prone to overstressing and damaging the airframes, as the Sea Fury had been designed for a tail-down landing attitude. The Sea Fury would be operated between 1948 and 1956 by the RCN, whereupon they were replaced by the jet-powered McDonnell F2H Banshee. The retired aircraft were put into storage, and some were subsequently purchased by civilians.

===Cuba===

In 1958 during the Cuban Revolution, the &quot;Fuerza Aérea del Ejercito de Cuba&quot; (FAEC) purchased a total of 17 refurbished (ex-Fleet Air Arm) Sea Furies from Hawker, comprising fifteen FB.11s and two T.20 trainers. The aircraft were briefly flown by FAEC prior to the ousting of President Fulgencio Batista and the assumption of power by Fidel Castro. Following the change in government, the Sea Furies were retained by the &quot;Fuerza Aérea Revolucionaria&quot; (&quot;Revolutionary Air Force&quot;; FAR); these aircraft proved difficult to keep operational, partially because the new military lacked personnel experienced with the type.

In April 1961, during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, air support for the Cuban exiles&#x27; Brigade 2506 was provided by ex-USAF, CIA-operated Douglas B-26B Invaders; United States President John F. Kennedy had decided against involving U.S. Navy aircraft. The only FAR fighter aircraft to see combat were three Sea Furies and five Lockheed T-33 armed jet trainers belonging to the &quot;Escuadrón Persecución y Combate&quot; (&quot;Pursuit &amp; Combat Squadron&quot;), based at the San Antonio de los Baños and Antonio Maceo air bases. In pre-emptive attacks on 15 April, two Sea Furies were destroyed on the ground, one at Ciudad Libertad and one in a hangar near Moa. During the ensuing aerial combat, a single airborne Sea Fury was lost during the Invasion.

In the early hours of 17 April, Brigade 2506 began to land at Playa Girón. Around 06:30, a FAR formation composed of three Sea Furies, one B-26 and two T-33s started attacking the exiles&#x27; ships. At about 06:50, south of Playa Larga, the transport ship &quot;Houston&quot; was damaged by rockets and cannons from FAR aircraft, including Sea Furies piloted by Major Enrique Carreras Rojas and Captain Gustavo Bourzac; &quot;Houston&quot; caught fire and was abandoned.
While attempting to land at an airbase, Carreras Rojas&#x27;s Sea Fury was attacked and damaged by a CIA B-26; he was able to abort his approach and escape. Carreras Rojas later shot down another B-26. While attempting to shoot down a Curtiss C-46 transport aircraft, Nicaraguan-born pilot Carlos Ulloa crashed in the Bay of Pigs around 08:30, either due to an engine stall or being hit by anti-aircraft fire. Around 09:30, multiple FAR aircraft destroyed an ammunition ship, &quot;Rio Escondido&quot;. A Sea Fury piloted by Lieutenant Douglas Rudd also destroyed a B-26.

===Iraq===
Iraq bought its first 30 Fury F.1 fighters and two Fury T.52 trainers in 1946. These aircraft were operated by Nos. 1 and 7 Squadrons. Iraqi Furies did not take part in the first weeks of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. However, after newly-received Israeli Boeing B-17s started bombing Arab cities, the governments of Syria and Transjordan demanded that the Iraqis deploy their Furies. Hence, six aircraft from No.7 Squadron were transferred to Damascus in late July 1948; one of them crashed on landing on its arrival. Another one followed in September, with its pilot being injured. The Iraqi Furies didn&#x27;t see much action during that war, because of the limited amount of ammunition supplied by the British. Only armed reconnaissance missions were flown, and no air combats with Israeli aircraft were reported.

An additional 20 Fury F.1s were acquired in 1951, which enabled No. 4 Squadron to start operating the type. Iraqi Furies saw action during the numerous Kurdish uprisings in the north of the country, throughout the 1960s. They notably performed close air support missions, as well as attacks on villages, rebel-controlled roadblocks, and troop concentrations. They were ultimately replaced by Sukhoi Su-7s, between 1967 and 1969.

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands was the first export customer for the Sea Fury, and the Netherlands Royal Navy operated the aircraft from two of their aircraft carriers, both of which were named HNLMS &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; as they were operated at separate periods from one another. It was common for Royal Netherlands Navy vessels to operate alongside Royal Navy ships, thus Dutch Sea Furies also regularly operated from FAA land bases and RN carriers. During 1947, Dutch Sea Furies operating from HNLMS &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; were employed in a ground support capacity against insurgent fighters in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch procured and licence-built additional Sea Furies for carrier operations, although the type was ultimately replaced by the jet-powered Hawker Sea Hawk from the late 1950s onwards.

===Pakistan===
One of the largest export customers for the type was Pakistan. In 1949, an initial order for 50 Sea Fury FB.60 aircraft for the Pakistan Air Force was placed. A total of 87 new-build Sea Furies were purchased and delivered between 1950 and 1952; some ex-FAA and Iraqi Sea Furies were also subsequently purchased. The aircraft was operated by three frontline squadrons, No.5, No.9 and No.14 Squadron. The Sea Fury began to be replaced by the jet-powered North American F-86 Sabre in 1955, and the last Sea Furies in Pakistani service were ultimately retired in 1960.

==Surviving aircraft==

As production continued well after the end of the Second World War and aircraft remained in Royal Navy service until 1955, dozens of airframes have survived in varying conditions. Sea Furies were overhauled by Hawker Aircraft at their factory at Blackpool during 1959 and supplied to civil companies in Germany, equipped with target-towing gear for Luftwaffe contract flying. Some of these aircraft survive.

In the late 1970s David Tallichet and Ed Jurist secured the purchase of 24 Furies from Iraq, including a number of spare parts. These were transported to Florida for restoration, and are now owned and operated internationally by collectors.

Around a dozen heavily modified Sea Furies are raced regularly at the Reno Air Races . Most of these examples were modified to replace the original sleeve valve Centaurus radial with the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major or the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engine. These include &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and &quot;Furias&quot;, which have had Wasp Major engines installed.

Ex-Iraqi Fury 326 (C/N 41H/643827) restored in New Zealand in the 1980s was painted as &quot;WJ232&quot;, the aircraft &#x27;Hoagy&#x27; Carmichael flew during the 9 August 1952 action which resulted in him being credited with the destruction of a MiG-15 jet fighter. The aircraft was sold in Australia in its Royal Navy markings, with civil registration VH-SHF. The original &quot;WJ232&quot; was sold by the Royal Navy back to Hawker, refurbished and delivered to Burma as UB467 in 1958.

Many additional airframes remain as static displays in museums worldwide. April 1, 1957 saw Lieutenant Commander Derek Prout deliver an RCN Hawker Sea Fury WG-565 to Calgary for use as a ground instruction airframe at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. F/O Lynn Garrison flew the aircraft making the last official Canadian military flight of the type. Prout would lose his life in the crash of an F2H-3 Banshee at RCN Shearwater, Nova Scotia May 31, 1957. An airframe is on display outside the Granma Memorial, as part of the Museum of the Revolution in Havana. A second airframe forms an outside part of the Museo Giron in Playa Girón.

During the 1989 Prestwick (Glasgow) Air Show, a Sea Fury had to be ditched in the sea as the port landing gear was stuck. The pilot parachuted to safety.

On 31 July 2014 a Hawker Sea Fury T.20 (VX281) owned by Royal Navy Historic Flight made a controlled crash landing at the RNAS &quot;Culdrose&quot; Air Day. During the display, smoke was seen coming from the plane&#x27;s engine. During an approach for an emergency landing, the undercarriage extended but failed to lock, leading to a belly landing. Lt Cdr Chris Gotke, 44, the pilot, suffered no injuries and was later awarded the Air Force Cross for his decision to continue to fly the aircraft to safety rather than parachute out and abandon it; he later stated that &quot;The safety of the crowd was never a factor because the aircraft was fully controllable.&quot; This aircraft returned to the air in September 2017 following repairs. On 28 April 2021 it crashed again near RNAS Yeovilton following an engine problem. After the aircraft&#x27;s insurer declared it a write-off, the owners announced plans to sell the wrecked plane in hopes that some other party would restore it again.

Since the type&#x27;s retirement, several Sea Furies have been operated by the Royal Navy Historic Flight; between 1989 and 1990 two of the flight&#x27;s Sea Furies were lost in separate incidents.

A two-seat Sea Fury was used in the making of the 2022 film &quot;Devotion&quot; to allow actors to simulate piloting an F8F Bearcat. The Sea Fury&#x27;s rear seat was modified to resemble a Bearcat cockpit and visible portions of the airframe were painted like a VF-32 Bearcat.

<text>In mathematics, a compactly generated (topological) group is a topological group &quot;G&quot; which is algebraically generated by one of its compact subsets. This should not be confused with the unrelated notion (widely used in algebraic topology) of a compactly generated space -- one whose topology is generated (in a suitable sense) by its compact subspaces.

== Definition ==

A topological group &quot;G&quot; is said to be compactly generated if there exists a compact subset &quot;K&quot; of &quot;G&quot; such that

:formula_1

So if &quot;K&quot; is symmetric, i.e. &quot;K&quot; = &quot;K&quot; −1, then 

:formula_2

== Locally compact case ==

This property is interesting in the case of locally compact topological groups, since locally compact compactly generated topological groups can be approximated by locally compact, separable metric factor groups of &quot;G&quot;. More precisely, for a sequence 

:&quot;U&quot;&quot;n&quot; 

of open identity neighborhoods, there exists a normal subgroup &quot;N&quot; contained in the intersection of that sequence, such that 

:&quot;G&quot;/&quot;N&quot; 

is locally compact metric separable (the Kakutani-Kodaira-Montgomery-Zippin theorem).

<doc id="594686" wikidata="Q658398" url="?curid=594686" title="Elytron">
<text>An elytron (; ; : elytra, ) is a modified, hardened forewing of beetles (Coleoptera), though a few of the true bugs (Hemiptera) such as the family Schizopteridae are extremely similar; in true bugs, the forewings are called hemelytra (sometimes alternatively spelled as &quot;hemielytra&quot;), and in most species only the basal half is thickened while the apex is membranous, but when they are entirely thickened the condition is referred to as &quot;coleopteroid&quot;. An elytron is sometimes also referred to as a shard.

==Description==
The elytra primarily serve as protective wing-cases for the hindwings underneath, which are used for flying. To fly, a beetle typically opens the elytra and then extends the hindwings, flying while still holding the elytra open, though many beetles in the families Scarabaeidae and Buprestidae can fly with the elytra closed (e.g., most Cetoniinae; ).

In a number of groups, the elytra are reduced to various degrees, (e.g., the beetle families Staphylinidae and Ripiphoridae), or secondarily lost altogether, as in various Elateroidea lineages with wingless females.

In some flightless groups, the elytra are present but fused together, and the hindwings are absent (e.g., some ground beetles (Carabidae), scarab beetles, and weevils).

== In popular culture ==
* The video game &quot;Minecraft&quot; features elytra as an item that allows the player to glide in a similar fashion to a hang glider.

<text>The IBM 5100 Portable Computer is one of the first portable computers, introduced in September 1975, six years before the IBM Personal Computer, and eight before the first successful IBM compatible portable computer, the Compaq Portable. It was the evolution of a prototype called the SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) that was developed at the IBM Los Gatos Laboratory and Palo Alto Scientific Center in 1973. Whether considered evolutionary from SCAMP or revolutionary, it still needed to be plugged into an electric socket.

When the IBM PC was introduced in 1981, it was originally designated as the IBM 5150, putting it in the &quot;5100&quot; series, though its architecture was unrelated to the IBM 5100&#x27;s. The 5100 was IBM&#x27;s second transportable computer. Previously, a truck-based IBM 1401 was configured in 1960 for military use and referred to as a &quot;mobile&quot; computer.

The IBM 5100 was withdrawn in March 1982, by which time IBM had announced its larger cousins, the IBM 5110 (January 1978) and the IBM 5120 (February 1980).

==SCAMP, the prototype==

In 1973, Bill Lowe was instrumental in fostering an engineering prototype called SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) created by Dr. Paul Friedl and a team at the IBM Los Gatos Scientific Center. SCAMP has been dubbed in &quot;PC Magazine&quot; as &quot;the world&#x27;s first personal computer&quot;.

The IBM Los Gatos engineering prototype and a design model by IBM Industrial designer Tom Hardy, were utilized internally by Lowe in his early efforts to demonstrate the viability of creating a single-user computer. 

SCAMP emulated an IBM 1130 minicomputer in order to run APL\1130. In 1973, APL was generally available only on mainframe computers, and most desktop sized microcomputers such as the Wang 2200 or HP 9800 offered only BASIC. 

Because SCAMP was the first to emulate APL\1130 performance on a portable, single user computer, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; in 1983 designated SCAMP a &quot;revolutionary concept&quot; and &quot;the world&#x27;s first personal computer&quot;.

==Description==
The IBM 5100 is based on a 16-bit processor module called PALM (Program All Logic in Microcode). The IBM 5100 Maintenance Information Manual also referred to the PALM module as the &quot;controller&quot;. The PALM could directly address of memory. Some configurations of the IBM 5100 had Executable ROS (ROM) and RAM memory totalling more than , so a simple bank switching scheme was used. The actual APL and BASIC interpreters were stored in a separate &quot;Language ROS&quot; address space which the PALM treats as a peripheral device. There were twelve models available: with BASIC, APL, or both. Memory could be , , or of main 
storage. The 5100 sold for between and (between $ and $ in today&#x27;s dollars).

Often described as being &quot;approximately fifty pounds&quot;, its weight was closer to 55 pounds (25 kg). In December 1975 &quot;BYTE&quot; stated &quot;Welcome, IBM, to personal computing&quot;. Describing the 5100 as &quot;a 50-lb package of interactive personal computing,&quot; the magazine said that with the company&#x27;s announcement &quot;personal computing gains an entry from the industry&#x27;s production and service giant,&quot; albeit &quot;at a premium price&quot;.

A single integrated unit provided the keyboard, five-inch CRT display, tape drive, processor, several hundred KB of read-only memory containing system software, and up to of RAM. It was the size of a small suitcase, weighed about (), and could be transported in an optional carrying case, hence the &quot;portable&quot; designation.

In 1975, it was an amazing technical accomplishment to package a complete computer with a large amount of ROM and RAM, CRT display, and a tape drive into a machine that small. Earlier desktop computers of approximately the same size, such as the HP 9830, did not include a CRT nor nearly as much memory. The 5100 has an internal CRT (five-inch diagonal) and displays 16 lines of 64 characters. IBM provided an option switch to allow the user to display all 64 characters of each line, or only the left or right 32 characters (interspersed with spaces). Also there was a switch to display the first 512 bytes of main memory in hexadecimal for diagnostic purposes.

Two solutions existed for obtaining hardcopy output: printers such as the IBM 5103, and attaching a typewriter via 
an interface. The &quot;TYCOM 5100&quot; (from a company named &quot;Tycom Systems Corporation&quot;) enabled controlling an IBM Selectric typewriter, printing at 15.5 CPS.

Mass storage was provided by removable quarter-inch cartridge (QIC) magnetic tape drives that use standard DC300 cartridges to store . One drive was installed in the machine and a second (Model 5106) could be added in an attached box. The data format included several types and were written in 512 byte records. The introduction of a floppy option was not until the &quot;IBM 5110&quot;.

At the same time IBM announced the IBM 5100, it also announced the IBM 5100 Communications Adapter, which allowed the 5100 to transmit data to and receive data from a remote system. It made the 5100 appear the same as an IBM 2741 Communications Terminal and was designed to be able to communicate with IBM 2741 compatible machines in start-stop mode using the &quot;EBCD&quot; (Extended Binary Coded Decimal) notation, referred to as PTTC/EBCD in IBM 2741 documentation. EBCD was similar to the more common IBM EBCDIC code, but not identical. A feature that does not appear in any advertisement for this computer is an optional Serial I/O Adapter. In order to access the port extensions, they needed to be loaded from tape for the APL and BASIC programming languages. Unlike the Communications Adapter which could only be used to connect devices that supported the IBM 2741, this feature allowed users to connect and code for any device that used a standard serial I/O port, including devices not made by IBM.

One periodical described &quot;an interesting standard feature&quot;; that a 5100 could be connected to a television. An external video monitor receiver could be connected to the IBM 5100 via a BNC connector on the back panel. While the 5100 had a front panel switch to select between &quot;white on black&quot; or &quot;black on white&quot; for the internal display, this switch did not affect the external monitor, which only offered white characters on a black background. The vertical scan rate was fixed at .

==Research Device Coupler==
In Volume 16, Number 1, Page 41 (1977) of the IBM Systems Journal the article &quot;The IBM 5100 and the Research Device Coupler — A personal laboratory automation system&quot; read: &quot;A small laboratory automation system has been developed by using the IBM 5100 Portable Computer in conjunction with the Research Device Coupler. This compact system provides a dedicated, high-level-language computer and a versatile data acquisition and control interface for experiments in which data rates do not exceed 9600 baud. Two experiments exemplify the use of the system. The Research Device Coupler described in this paper is a prototype of the IBM 7406 Device Coupler.&quot;

==Programming languages==
The 5100 was available with APL, BASIC, or both programming languages. At the time of introduction, APL was generally available only on mainframe computers, and most desktop sized computers such as the Wang 2200 or HP 9830 offered only BASIC. As a desktop computer offering APL, the 5100 competed with, and indeed may have been inspired by, the earlier MCM/70.

Machines that supported both languages provided a toggle switch on the front panel to select the language. On the 5100&#x27;s front panel, it was the third toggle from the left: up for APL, down for BASIC.

When the engineers at IBM asked one beta tester, Donald Polonis, for his analysis, he commented that if folks had to learn APL to use it, the IBM 5100 would not make it as a personal computer. He tried to impress the fact that a personal computer had to be easy to use to be accepted. Presumably, the special APL character set and APL keyboard were the primary obstacles to newcomers learning APL easily. APL had powerful features for manipulating data as vectors and matrices, while the competing HP 9830 had to offer language extensions on an add-on ROM for matrix operations.

Although not meant for regular users, the maintenance manual described a keyboard sequence to switch the 5100 into a maintenance mode. In this mode it was possible to read and write directly in RAM memory, video memory, CPU registers, interrupt vectors, clock counter, etc., using hexadecimal codes equivalent to assembly language. This allowed writing sophisticated programs directly into RAM. As this mode was a single-user system effectively running without an operating system, a determined user could manage the memory space and write stable multi-tasking programs using interrupts.

==Emulator in microcode==

The 5100 was based on IBM&#x27;s innovative concept that, using an emulator written in microcode, a small and relatively cheap computer could run programs already written for much larger, and much more expensive, existing computers, without the time and expense of writing and debugging new programs.

Two such programs were included: a slightly modified version of APLSV, IBM&#x27;s APL interpreter for its System/370 mainframes, and the BASIC interpreter used on IBM&#x27;s System/3 minicomputer. Consequently, the 5100&#x27;s microcode was written to emulate most of the functionality of both a System/370 and a System/3.

IBM later used the same approach for its 1983 introduction of the XT/370 model of the IBM PC, which was a standard IBM PC XT with the addition of a System/370 emulator card.

<text>Ball is the eighth studio album released by the Athens, GA based band Widespread Panic. It was released on April 15, 2003 and it was the band&#x27;s first studio album with George McConnell on lead guitar. McConnell joined the band in 2002 after the death of founding member Michael Houser.

This process of recording the album departed from the band&#x27;s usual methodology. Widespread Panic&#x27;s previous studio albums had included mostly songs already familiar to the band&#x27;s fans. Ball, however, included 12 never-before-heard songs written specifically for the album, along with one song, &quot;Time Waits&quot;, previously performed only by singer/guitarist John Bell in solo appearances. It was also the first Widespread Panic album which did not feature at least one cover song.

The album reached a peak position of #61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

<doc id="594696" wikidata="Q57621" url="?curid=594696" title="Wilhelm, German Crown Prince">
<text>Wilhelm, German Crown Prince, Crown Prince of Prussia (Friedrich Wilhelm Victor August Ernst; 6 May 1882 – 20 July 1951) was the eldest child of the last German emperor, Wilhelm II, and his consort Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, and thus a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, and distant cousin to many British royals, such as Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III. As Emperor Wilhelm&#x27;s heir, he was the last Crown Prince of the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia, until the abolition of the monarchy.

Wilhelm became crown prince at the age of six in 1888, when his grandfather Frederick III died and his father became emperor. He was crown prince for 30 years until the fall of the empire on 9 November 1918. During World War I, he commanded the 5th Army from 1914 to 1916 and was commander of the Army Group German Crown Prince for the remainder of the war. After his return to Germany in 1923, he fought the Weimar Republic and campaigned for the reintroduction of the monarchy in Germany. After his plans to become president had been blocked by his father, Wilhelm supported Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, but when Wilhelm realised that Hitler had no intention of restoring the monarchy, their relationship cooled. Wilhelm became head of the House of Hohenzollern on 4 June 1941 following the death of his father and held the position until his own death on 20 July 1951.

==Early life==

Wilhelm was born on 6 May 1882 as the eldest son of the then Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, and his first wife, Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein. He was born in the Marmorpalais of Potsdam in the Province of Brandenburg, where his parents resided until his father acceded to the throne. When he was born, his great-grandfather Wilhelm I was the German Emperor and his grandfather Crown Prince Frederick was the heir apparent, making Wilhelm third in line to the throne.
His birth sparked an argument between his parents and his grandmother Crown Princess Victoria. Before Wilhelm was born, his grandmother had expected to be asked to help find a nurse, but since her son did everything he could to snub her, the future Wilhelm II asked his aunt Princess Helena to help instead. His mother was hurt and his grandmother, Queen Victoria, who was the younger Wilhelm&#x27;s great-grandmother, was furious.

Prince Wilhelm would have five younger brothers: Prince Eitel Friedrich, Prince Adalbert, Prince August Wilhelm, Prince Oskar and Prince Joachim and one younger sister: Princess Viktoria Luise. He spent his childhood with his siblings at Marmorpalais and after his father&#x27;s accession to the throne at the New Palace, also in Potsdam.

In 1888, the Year of the Three Emperors when his great-grandfather and grandfather both died, his father became German Emperor, and six-year-old Wilhelm became the heir apparent to the German and Prussian thrones with the title of Kronprinz. He spent his school days with his brothers at the Prinzenhaus in Plön in his mother&#x27;s ancestral Schleswig-Holstein.

Wilhelm was a supporter of association football, then a relatively new sport in the country, donating a cup to the German Football Association in 1908 and thereby initiating the &quot;Kronprinzenpokal (now Länderpokal)&quot;, the oldest cup competition in German football. The German club BFC Preussen was also originally named BFC Friedrich Wilhelm in his honour.

In 1914, the kaiser ordered the construction of Schloss Cecilienhof in Potsdam for Prince Wilhelm and his family which angered him. The Schloss was loosely inspired by Bidston Court in Birkenhead, England, resembling a Tudor manor. Completed in 1917, it became the main residence for the Crown Prince for a time.

==World War I==
Wilhelm had been active in pushing German expansion, and sought a leading role on the outbreak of war. Despite being only thirty-two and having never commanded a unit larger than a regiment, the German crown prince was named commander of the 5th Army in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. However, under the well-established Prussian/German General Staff model then in use, inexperienced nobles who were afforded commands of large army formations were always provided with (and expected to defer to the advice of) experienced chiefs of staff to assist them in their duties. As emperor, Wilhelm&#x27;s father instructed the crown prince to defer to the advice of his experienced chief of staff Konstantin Schmidt von Knobelsdorf.

In October 1914 Wilhelm gave his first interview to a foreign correspondent and the first statement to the press made by a German noble since the outbreak of war. He denied promoting military solutions to diplomatic problems, and said this in English:

From August 1915 onwards, Wilhelm was given the additional role as commander of the Army Group German Crown Prince. In 1916 his troops began the Verdun Offensive, a year-long effort to destroy the French armies that would end in failure. He personally ordered a naval gun to fire the first shot on 21 February 1916, starting the deadly battle. Wilhelm relinquished command of the 5th Army in November of that year, but remained commander of the Army Group German Crown Prince for the rest of the war.

==1918–34==
After the outbreak of the German Revolution in 1918, both Emperor Wilhelm II and the crown prince signed the document of abdication. On 13 November, the former crown prince fled Germany, crossed into the Netherlands at Oudvroenhoven and was later interned on the island of Wieringen (now part of the mainland), near Den Helder. In the autumn of 1921, Gustav Stresemann visited Wilhelm, and the former crown prince voiced an interest in returning to Germany, even as a private citizen. After Stresemann became chancellor in August 1923, Wilhelm was allowed to return after giving assurances that he would not engage in politics. He chose 9 November 1923 for this, which infuriated his father, who had not been informed about the plans of his son and who felt the historic date to be inappropriate.

In June 1926, a referendum on expropriating the former ruling Princes of Germany without compensation failed and as a consequence, the financial situation of the Hohenzollern family improved considerably. A settlement between the state and the family made Cecilienhof property of the state but granted a right of residence to Wilhelm and his wife Cecilie. This was limited in duration to three generations. 
Wilhelm broke the promise he had made to Stresemann to stay out of politics. Adolf Hitler visited Wilhelm at Cecilienhof three times, in 1926, in 1933 (on the &quot;Day of Potsdam&quot;) and in 1935. Wilhelm joined &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;, which merged in 1931 into the Harzburg Front, a right-wing organisation of those opposed to the democratic republic.

The former crown prince was reportedly interested in the idea of running for &quot;Reichspräsident&quot; as the right-wing candidate against Paul von Hindenburg in 1932, until his father (who privately supported Hindenburg) forbade him from acting on the idea. After his plans to become president had been blocked by his father, Wilhelm supported Hitler&#x27;s rise to power.

==1934–51==

After the murder of his friend Kurt von Schleicher, the former Chancellor, in the Night of the Long Knives (1934), Wilhelm withdrew from all political activities.

When Wilhelm realised that Hitler had no intention of restoring the monarchy, their relationship cooled. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1941, Wilhelm succeeded him as head of the House of Hohenzollern, the former German imperial dynasty. He was approached by those in the military and the diplomatic service who wanted to replace Hitler, but Wilhelm turned them down. After the ill-fated assassination attempt on 20 July 1944, Hitler nevertheless had Wilhelm placed under supervision by the &quot;Gestapo&quot; and had his home at Cecilienhof watched.

In January 1945, Wilhelm left Potsdam for Oberstdorf for a treatment of his gall and liver problems. His wife Cecilie fled in early February 1945 as the Red Army drew closer to Berlin, but they had been living apart for a long time. At the End of World War II in Europe, Wilhelm&#x27;s home, Cecilienhof, was seized by the Soviets. The palace was subsequently used by the Allied Powers as the venue for the Potsdam Conference.

At the end of the war, Wilhelm was captured by French Moroccan troops in Baad, Austria, and was interned as a (World War I) war criminal. Transferred to Hechingen, Germany, he lived for a short time in Hohenzollern Castle under house arrest before moving to a small five-room house at Fürstenstraße 16 in Hechingen. He died there on 20 July 1951, of a heart attack. It was exactly seven years after the 20 July plot. Three days later, his opponent in the Battle of Verdun, Marshal Philippe Pétain, died in prison in France.

Wilhelm and his wife are buried at Hohenzollern Castle.

==Family and children==

Wilhelm married Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (20 September 1886 – 6 May 1954) in Berlin on 6 June 1905. After their marriage, the couple lived at the Crown Prince&#x27;s Palace in Berlin during the winter and at the Marmorpalais in Potsdam, later at Cecilienhof in Potsdam. Cecilie was the daughter of Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1851–1897) and his wife, Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia (1860–1922). Their eldest son, Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, was killed fighting for the German Army in France in 1940.

Their children were:
*Prince Wilhelm of Prussia (1906–1940), who renounced his succession rights in 1933 in order to marry Dorothea von Salviati, and had issue
*Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia (1907–1994); married 1938 Grand Duchess Kira Kirillovna of Russia and had issue
*Prince Hubertus of Prussia (1909–1950); married 1941 Baroness Maria von Humboldt-Dachroeden, 1943 Princess Magdalena Reuss and had issue
*Prince Frederick of Prussia (1911–1966); married 1945 Lady Brigid Guinness and had issue:
*Princess Alexandrine of Prussia, called &quot;Adini&quot; (1915–1980)
*Princess Cecilie of Prussia (1917–1975); married Clyde Kenneth Harris on 21 June 1949, and had issue

==In literature and popular culture==
Wilhelm&#x27;s reputation as a military commander was satirised by Neil Munro in his Erchie MacPherson story, &quot;Bad News&quot;, first published in the &quot;Glasgow Evening News&quot; on 8th January 1917.

<text>Sir Lyman Poore Duff, , PC(UK) (7 January 1865 – 26 April 1955) was a Canadian lawyer and judge who served as the eighth Chief Justice of Canada. He was the longest-serving justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, until Beverley McLachlin’s 17-year tenure from 2000-2017.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Meaford, Canada West (now Ontario) to a Congregationalist minister, Duff received a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics and metaphysics from the University of Toronto in 1887. After graduation, he taught at Barrie Collegiate Institute while studying for the bar. Duff later took courses at Osgoode Hall Law School and was called to the Ontario Bar in 1893.

Duff practised as a lawyer in Fergus, Ontario, after being called to the bar. In 1895, Duff moved to Victoria, British Columbia, and he continued his career there. In 1895, he was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel (Q.C.), which became King&#x27;s Counsel (K.C.) on 22 January 1901 upon the death of Queen Victoria. In 1903, he took part, as junior counsel for Canada, in the Alaska Boundary arbitration.

In 1923, Mount Duff (Yakutat), also known as Boundary Peak 174, was named after him.

==Judicial and other appointments==

In 1904, he was appointed a puisne judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. In 1906, he was appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. On January 14, 1919, he was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Duff was the first and only Puisne Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada to be appointed to the Imperial Privy Council. In 1924, he was elected as an honorary bencher of Gray&#x27;s Inn, at the recommendation of Lord Birkenhead.

In 1931, he served as Administrator of the Government of Canada (acting Governor-General of Canada) between the departure of Lord Bessborough for England and the arrival of Lord Tweedsmuir. Duff took on the position, as the Chief Justice was unavailable. As Administrator, Duff opened Parliament and read the Speech from the Throne on 12 March 1931, becoming the first Canadian-born person to do so.

In 1933, Duff was appointed as Chief Justice of Canada, succeeding Chief Justice Anglin. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George the following year as a result of Prime Minister Richard Bennett&#x27;s temporary suspension of the Nickle Resolution.

When Governor General Lord Tweedsmuir died in office on February 11, 1940, Chief Justice Duff became the Administrator of the Government for the second time. He held the office for nearly four months, until King George VI appointed Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone as Governor General on June 21, 1940. Duff was the first Canadian to hold the position, even in the interim. A Canadian-born Governor General was not appointed until Vincent Massey in 1952.

Duff also heard more than eighty appeals on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, mostly Canadian appeals; however, he never heard Privy Council appeals from the Supreme Court of Canada while he served on the latter, otherwise, it would have been seen as a conflict of interest. The last Privy Council appeal heard by Duff was the 1946 Reference Re Persons of Japanese Race.

In 1942, Duff served as the sole member of a Royal Commission constituted to examine the Liberal government&#x27;s conduct in relation to the defence of Hong Kong. The resulting report, which completely exonerated the government, proved to be controversial, and was seen by many as a whitewash.

Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age for judges in 1939, his term of office was extended by three years by a special Act of Parliament; in 1943, his term of office was extended for another year by Parliament. He retired as Chief Justice in 1944.

==Impact==
Duff employed a conservative form of statutory interpretation. In a 1935 Supreme Court of Canada judgment, he detailed how judges should interpret statutes:

Duff has been called a &quot;master of trenchant and incisive English,&quot; who &quot;wrote his opinions in a style which bears comparison with Holmes or Birkenhead.&quot; A former assistant of Duff, Kenneth Campbell, argued that Duff was &quot;frequently ranked as the equal of Justices Holmes and Brandeis of the United States Supreme Court&quot;. Gerald Le Dain, an academic and later a judge on the Supreme Court, asserted that Duff &quot;is generally considered to have been one of Canada&#x27;s greatest judges.&quot; Other writers have taken a less favourable view, instead arguing that Duff&#x27;s reputation is largely unearned; his biographer concluded that he was not an original thinker, but essentially a &quot;talented student and exponent of the law rather than a creator of it.&quot;

More recent commentary has focused on Duff&#x27;s legal formalism and its effect on Canadian federalism. A later successor Chief Justice of Canada, Bora Laskin attacked Duff&#x27;s decisions, arguing that Duff used circular reasoning and hid his policy-laden decisions behind the doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot;. As well, Lionel Schipper noted that, in reviewing Duff&#x27;s judgments, it was:

<doc id="594703" wikidata="Q576139" url="?curid=594703" title="Religion in Canada">
<text>Religion in Canada encompasses a wide range of beliefs and customs that historically has been dominated by Christianity. The constitution of Canada refers to &#x27;God&#x27;, however Canada has no official church and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism. Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. Rates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the 1960s. After having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian state. Although the majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, they still believe in God. The practice of religion is generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state.

Before the European colonization, a wide diversity of Native religions and belief systems of the Indigenous peoples in Canada were largely animistic or shamanistic. The French colonization beginning in the 16th century established a Catholic French population in New France. During the colonial period, the French settled along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River, specifically Latin Church Catholics, including a number of Jesuits dedicated to converting indigenous peoples.
These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration through state-funded boarding schools run by both Catholics and Protestants that attempted to assimilate Indigenous children. 

British colonization brought waves of Anglicans and other Protestants to Upper Canada, now Ontario. The settlement of the West brought significant Eastern Orthodox immigrants from Eastern Europe and Mormon and Pentecostal immigrants from the United States. The Jewish, Islamic, Jains, Sikh, Hindu, and Buddhist communities—although small—are as old as the nation itself.

According to the 2021 census, Christianity is the largest religion in Canada, with Catholics representing 29.9 percent of the population having the most adherents. Christians overall representing 53.3 percent of the population, are followed by people reporting irreligion or having no religion at 34.6 percent. Other faiths include Islam (4.9 percent), Hinduism (2.3 percent), Sikhism (2.1 percent), Buddhism (1.0 percent), Judaism (0.9 percent), and Indigenous spirituality (0.2 percent). Canada has the second-largest national Sikh population, behind India.

== Religious pluralism==
Canada today has no state religion, and the Government of Canada is officially committed to religious pluralism. While the Canadian government&#x27;s official ties to religion, specifically Christianity are few, the Preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms makes reference to &quot;the supremacy of God.&quot; The national anthem in both official languages also refers to God. Nevertheless, the rise of irreligion within the country and influx of non-Christian peoples has led to a greater separation of government and religion, demonstrated in forms like &quot;Christmas holidays&quot; being called &quot;winter festivals&quot; in public schools. Some religious schools are government-funded as per Section Twenty-nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Canada is a Commonwealth realm in which the head of state is shared with 14 other countries. As such, Canada follows the United Kingdom&#x27;s succession laws for its monarch, which bar Catholics from inheriting the throne. Within Canada, the monarch&#x27;s title includes the phrases &quot;By the Grace of God&quot;.

Christmas and Easter are nationwide holidays, and while Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and other religious groups are allowed to take their holy days off work, they do not share the same official recognition. In 1957, the Parliament declared Thanksgiving &quot;a day of general thanksgiving to almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed.&quot;

There was an ongoing battle in the late 20th century to have religious garb accepted throughout Canadian society, mostly focused on Sikh turbans. The Canadian Armed Forces authorized the wearing of turbans in 1986, eventually the Royal Canadian Mounted Police followed in 1988 and eventually other federal government agencies accepted members wearing turbans.

In 2023, the country was scored 3 out of 4 for religious freedom; it was noted that in 2019, a new law was put in place stating that some government employees in positions of authority were not allowed to wear religious symbols.

==History==
===Before 1800s===

Before the arrival of Europeans, the Indigenous peoples followed a wide array of mostly animistic religions and spirituality; &quot;including the presence of creation stories, the role of tricksters or of supernatural beings in folklore and the importance of sacred organizations&quot;. Common concept is the supernatural world of deities, spirits and wonders, such as the Algonquian &quot;manitou&quot;.

The first Europeans to settle in great numbers in Canada were French Catholics, including a large number of Jesuits who established several missions in North America. They were dedicated to converting the Indigenous peoples; an effort that eventually proved successful.

The first large Protestant communities were formed in the Maritimes after they were conquered by the British. Unable to convince enough British immigrants to go to the region, the government decided to import continental Protestants from Germany and Switzerland to populate the region and counterbalance the Catholic Acadians. This group was known as the Foreign Protestants. This effort proved successful and today the South Shore region of Nova Scotia is still largely Lutheran. After the Expulsion of the Acadians beginning in 1755 a large number of New England Planters settled on the vacated lands bringing with them their Congregationalist belief. During the 1770s, guided by Henry Alline, the New Light movement of the Great Awakening swept through the Atlantic region converting many of the Congregationalists to the new theology. After Alline&#x27;s death many of these Newlights eventually became Baptists, thus making Maritime Canada the heartland of the Baptist movement in Canada.

The Quebec Act of 1774 acknowledged the rights of the Catholic Church throughout Lower Canada in order to keep the French Canadians loyal to Britannic Crown. Catholicism is still the main religion of French Canadians today.

The American Revolution beginning in 1765 brought a large influx of Protestants to Canada when United Empire Loyalists, fleeing the rebellious United States, moved in large numbers to Upper Canada and the Maritimes.

===1800s to 1900s===

While Anglicans consolidated their hold on the upper classes, workingmen and farmers responded to the Methodist revivals, often sponsored by visiting preachers from the United States. Typical was Rev. James Caughey, an American sent by the Wesleyan Methodist Church from the 1840s through 1864. He brought in the converts by the score, most notably in the revivals in Western Canada from 1851 to 1853. His technique combined restrained emotionalism with a clear call for personal commitment, coupled with follow-up action to organize support from converts. It was a time when the holiness movement caught fire, with the revitalized interest of men and women in Christian perfection. Caughey successfully bridged the gap between the style of earlier camp meetings and the needs of more sophisticated Methodist congregations in the emerging cities.

In the early nineteenth century in the Maritimes and Upper Canada, the Anglican Church held the same official position it did in England. This caused tension within English Canada, as much of the populace was not Anglican. Increasing immigration from Scotland created a very large Presbyterian community and they and other groups demanded equal rights. This was an important cause of the 1837 Rebellion in Upper Canada. With the arrival of responsible governments, the Anglican monopoly was ended.

In Lower Canada, the Catholic Church was officially pre-eminent and had a central role in the colony&#x27;s culture and politics. Unlike English Canada, French Canadian nationalism became very closely associated with Catholicism. During this period, the Catholic Church in the region became one of the most reactionary in the world. Known as Ultramontane Catholicism, the church adopted positions condemning all manifestations of liberalism.

In politics, those aligned with the Catholic clergy in Quebec were known as &quot;les bleus&quot; (the blues). They formed a curious alliance with the staunchly monarchist and pro-British Anglicans of English Canada (often members of the Orange Order) to form the basis of the Canadian Conservative Party. The Reform Party, which later became the Liberal Party, was largely composed of the anti-clerical French Canadians, known as &quot;les rouges&quot; (the reds) and the non-Anglican Protestant groups. In those times, right before elections, parish priests would give sermons to their flock where they said things like (&quot;the sky (heaven) is blue and hell is red&quot;).

In 1871, national census revealed 56.45% as Protestants, 42.80% as Catholic, 0.05% as Pagans, 0.03% as Jewish, 0.02% as Mormons, 0.15% as irreligious and 0.49% as unspecified.

By the late nineteenth century, Protestant pluralism had taken hold in English Canada. While much of the elite were still Anglican, other groups, including the Methodists, had become very prominent as well. The schools and universities created at this time reflected this pluralism with major centres of learning being established for each faith. One, King&#x27;s College, later the University of Toronto, was set up as a non-denominational school. The influence of the Orange Order was strong, especially among Irish Protestant immigrants, and comprised a powerful anti-Catholic force in Ontario politics; its influence faded away after 1920.

The late nineteenth century also saw the beginning of a large shift in Canadian immigration patterns. Large numbers of Irish and Southern European immigrants were creating new Catholic communities in English Canada. Western Canada saw the arrival of significant Eastern Orthodox immigrants from Eastern Europe as well as Mormon and Pentecostal immigrants from the United States and Ireland.

===1900s to 1960s===

In 1919–20 Canada&#x27;s five major Protestant denominations (Anglican, Baptist, Congregational, Methodist, and Presbyterian) cooperatively undertook the &quot;Forward Movement.&quot; The goal was to raise funds and to strengthen Christian spirituality in Canada. The movement invoked Anglophone nationalism by linking donations with the Victory Loan campaigns of the First World War, and stressed the need for funds to Canadianize immigrants. Centred in Ontario, the campaign was a clear financial success, raising over $11 million. However the campaign exposed deep divisions among Protestants, with the traditional Evangelists speaking of a personal relationship with God and the more liberal denominations emphasizing the Social Gospel and good works. Both factions (apart from the Anglicans) agreed on prohibition, which was demanded by the WCTU.

As of 1931, Catholics were the largest religious body in Canada, with 4 million people. Following it were the United Church of Canada (including Methodists, Congregationalists and Presbyterians), with 2 million; the Anglican Church, with nearly 2 million; and the Presbyterian Church, with approximately 870,000. The Canada Year Book 1936 reported that &quot;of the non-Christian sects, 155,614 or 1.50% were Jews, 24,087 or 0.23% were Confucians, 15,784 or 0.15% were Buddhists and 5,008 or 0.05% were pagans.

Domination of Canadian society by Protestant and Catholic elements continued until well into the 20th century. Until the 1960s, most parts of Canada still had extensive Lord&#x27;s Day laws that limited what one could do on a Sunday. The English Canadian elite were still dominated by Protestants, and Jews and Catholics were often excluded. A slow process of liberalization began after the Second World War in English Canada. Overtly Christian laws were expunged, including those against homosexuality. Policies favouring Christian immigration were also abolished.

In 1951, a nationwide census was taken after incorporation of predominantly Protestant province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

According to statistics provided by Statistics Canada, Protestants held a slight majority in the country between 1871 and 1961. Despite Canada&#x27;s large Catholic population, this fact is confirmed by nine consecutive national censuses. By 1961, Catholics overtook Protestants as the most numerous religious group, although—unlike Protestants—they never reached the absolute majority status (&gt;50%).

===1960s and after===
The most overwhelming change was the Quiet Revolution in Quebec in the 1960s. Up through the 1950s, the province was one of the most traditional Catholic areas in the world. Church attendance rates were high, and the schools were largely controlled by the Church. In the 1960s, the Catholic Church lost most of its influence in Quebec, and religiosity declined sharply. While the majority of Québécois are still professed Latin Church Catholics, rates of church attendance have decreased dramatically. Since then, common-law relationships, abortion, and support for same-sex marriage are much more common in Quebec than previously, exceeding levels in some other areas of Canada. 

English Canada also underwent secularization. The United Church of Canada, the country&#x27;s largest Protestant denomination, became one of the most liberal major Protestant churches in the world. Flatt argues that in the 1960s Canada&#x27;s rapid cultural changes led the United Church to end its evangelical programs and change its identity. It made revolutionary changes in its evangelistic campaigns, educational programs, moral stances, and theological image. However, membership declined sharply as the United Church affirmed a commitment to gay rights including marriage and ordination, and to the ordination of women.

In 1971, Canada was 47% Catholic, 41% Protestant, 4% other religion and 4% unaffiliated.

Meanwhile, a strong current of evangelical Protestantism emerged. The largest groups are found in the Atlantic provinces and Western Canada, particularly in Alberta, Southern Manitoba and the Southern interior and Fraser Valley region of British Columbia, also known as the &quot;Canadian Bible Belt&quot;, as well as parts of Ontario outside the Greater Toronto Area. The social environment is more conservative, somewhat more in line with that of the Midwestern and Southern United States, and same-sex marriage, abortion, and common-law relationships are less widely accepted. The evangelical movement has grown sharply after 1960, and increasingly influences public policy. Nevertheless, the overall proportion of evangelicals in Canada remains considerably lower than in the United States, and the polarization much less intense. There are very few evangelicals in Quebec and in the largest urban areas, which are generally secular, although there are several congregations above 1000 members in most large cities.

===Indigenous residential school system===
Administered by various Christian churches and funded by the Canadian government from 1828 to 1997 Canadian Indian residential school system attempted to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture. The residential school system was established by Christian missionaries with the express purpose of converting Indigenous children to Christianity, schools often had nearby mission where possible graves of hundreds of Indigenous people were discovered. A period of redress began with the formation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008. This included recognition of past colonial genocide and settlement agreements. In October 2022, the Canadian House of Commons unanimously passed a motion calling on the federal Canadian government to recognize the residential school system as genocide. This acknowledgment was followed by a visit by Pope Francis who apologized for Church members&#x27; role in what he labeled the &quot;oppression, mistreatment and cultural genocide of indigenous people&quot;.

==Abrahamic religions==
=== Christianity ===

The majority of Canadian Christians attend church services infrequently. Cross-national surveys of religiosity rates such as the Pew Global Attitudes Project indicate that, on average, Canadian Christians are less observant than those of the United States but are still more overtly religious than their counterparts in Western Europe. In 2002, 30% of Canadians reported to Pew researchers that religion was &quot;very important&quot; to them. A 2005 Gallup poll showed that 28% of Canadians consider religion to be &quot;very important&quot; (55% of Americans and 19% of Britons say the same). Regional differences within Canada exist, however, with British Columbia and Quebec reporting especially low metrics of traditional religious observance, as well as a significant urban-rural divide, while Saskatchewan and rural Alberta saw high rates of religious attendance. The rates for weekly church attendance are contested, with estimates running as low as 11% as per the latest Ipsos-Reid poll and as high as 25% as per &quot;Christianity Today&quot; magazine. This American magazine reported that three polls conducted by Focus on the Family, Time Canada and the Vanier Institute of the Family showed church attendance increasing for the first time in a generation, with weekly attendance at 25 per cent. This number is similar to the statistics reported by premier Canadian sociologist of religion, Prof. Reginald Bibby of the University of Lethbridge, who has been studying Canadian religious patterns since 1975. Although lower than in the US, which has reported weekly church attendance at about 40% since the Second World War, weekly church attendance rates are higher than those in Northern Europe.

As well as the large churches—Catholic, United, and Anglican, which together count more than half of the Canadian population as nominal adherents—Canada also has many smaller Christian groups, including Eastern Orthodoxy. The Egyptian population in Ontario and Quebec (Greater Toronto in particular) has seen a large influx of the Coptic Orthodox population in just a few decades. The relatively large Ukrainian population of Manitoba and Saskatchewan has produced many followers of the Ukrainian Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox Churches, while southern Manitoba has been settled largely by Mennonites. The concentration of these smaller groups often varies greatly across the country. Baptists are especially numerous in the Maritimes. The Maritimes, prairie provinces, and southwestern Ontario have significant numbers of Lutherans. Southwest Ontario has seen large numbers of German and Russian immigrants, including many Mennonites and Hutterites, as well as a significant contingent of Dutch Reformed. Alberta has seen considerable immigration from the American plains, creating a significant Mormon minority in that province. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claimed to have 178,102 members (74,377 of whom in Alberta) at the end of 2007. And according to the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses year report there are 111,963 active members (members who actively preach) in Canada.

Canada as a nation is becoming increasingly religiously diverse, especially in large urban centres such as Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal, where minority groups and new immigrants who make up the growth in most religious groups congregate. Two significant trends become clear when the current religious landscape is examined closely. One is the loss of ‘secularized&#x27; Canadians as active and regular participants in the churches and denominations they grew up in, which were overwhelmingly Christian, while these churches remain a part of Canadians&#x27; cultural identity. The other is the increasing presence of ethnically diverse immigration within the religious makeup of the country.

As Mainline Protestants and Catholics have experienced drastic losses over the past 30 years, others have been expanding rapidly: overall by 144% in ‘Eastern&#x27; religions during the 1981–1991 decade. Considering Canada&#x27;s increasing reliance on immigration to bolster a low birth rate, the situation is only likely to continue to diversify. This increased influx of ethnic immigrants not only affects the types of religions represented in the Canadian context but also the increasingly multicultural and multilingual makeup of individual Christian denominations. From Chinese Anglican or Korean United Church communities, to the Lutheran focus on providing much needed services to immigrants new to the Canadian context and English language, immigration is making changes. Much as many Catholics in Quebec ignore the Church&#x27;s stance on birth control, abortion, or premarital sex, the churches do not dictate much of the daily lives of regular Canadians.

For some Protestant denominations, adapting to a new secular context has meant adjusting to their non-institutional roles in society by increasingly focusing on social justice. However the pull between conservative religious members and the more radical among the church members is complicated by the numbers of immigrant communities who may desire a church that fulfils a more ‘institutionally complete&#x27; role as a buffer in this new country over the current tension filled debates over same-sex marriage, ordination of women and homosexuals, or the role of women in the church. This of course will depend on the background of the immigrant population, as in the Hong Kong context where ordination of Florence Li Tim Oi happened long before women&#x27;s ordination was ever raised on the Canadian Anglican church level.

As well a multicultural focus on the churches part may include non-Christian elements (such as the inclusion of a Buddhist priest in one incident) which are unwelcome to the transplanted religious community. Serving the needs and desires of different aspects of the Canadian and newly Canadian populations makes a difficult balancing act for the various mainline churches which are starved for money and active parishioners in a time when 16% of Canadians identify as non-religious and up to two-thirds of those who do identify with a denomination use the church only for its life-cycle rituals governing birth, marriage, and death. The church retains that hold in their parishioners&#x27; lives but not the commitment of time and energy necessary to support an aging institution.

Evangelical portions of the Protestant groups proclaim their growth as well but as Roger O&#x27;Tool notes they make up 7% of the Canadian population and seem to gain most of their growth from a higher birthrate. What is significant is the higher participation of their members in contrast to Mainline Protestants and Catholics. This high commitment would seem to translate into the kind of political power evangelicals in the United States enjoy but despite Canada&#x27;s historically Christian background as Beaman notes neatly &quot;...[forming] the backdrop for social process&quot; explicit religiosity appears to have not effectively moved the government towards legal discrimination against gay marriage.

There was a major religious revival in Toronto in the nineties known as the Toronto Blessing at a small Vineyard Church near the Toronto Pearson International Airport. This religious event was the largest tourist attraction to Toronto in 1994. This event was characterized by unusual religious ecstasy such as being slain in the Spirit, laughing uncontrollably, and other odd behaviour.

A 2015 study estimates some 43,000 believers in Christ from a Muslim background in Canada, most of whom belong to the evangelical tradition.

==== Anglican Church of Canada ====
Anglican Church of Canada is the only official church of the Anglican Communion in Canada. Across Canada there are approximately 1,700 individual churches or parishes, which are organized into 30 different dioceses, each led by a bishop. The national church office is known as the General Synod. The Primate is the Archbishop Linda Nicholls, national pastoral leader.

==== Evangelicalism ====
The Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, a national evangelical alliance, member of the World Evangelical Alliance was founded in 1964 in Toronto. It brings together 43 Evangelical Christian denominations.

The Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada were founded in 1914.

The Canadian Baptist Ministries were founded in 1944.

==== Anabaptism ====
===== Hutterian Brethren =====

In the mid-1870s Hutterites moved from Europe to the Dakota Territory in the United States to avoid military service and other persecutions. During World War I Hutterites suffered from persecutions in the United States because they are pacifist and refused military service. They then moved almost all of their communities to Canada in the Western provinces of Alberta and Manitoba in 1918. In the 1940s, there were 52 Hutterite colonies in Canada.

Today, more than 75% of the world&#x27;s Hutterite colonies are located in Canada, mainly in Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the rest being almost exclusively in the United States. The Hutterite population in North America is about 45,000 people.

===== Mennonites =====
First Mennonites arrived in Canada in 1786 from Pennsylvania, but following Mennonites arrived directly from Europe. The Mennonite Church Canada had about 35,000 members in 1998.

==== Catholicism ====
The Catholic Church in Canada, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope and the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, has the largest number of adherents to a religion in Canada, with 38.7% of Canadians (13.07 million) reported as Catholics in the 2011 National Household Survey, in 72 dioceses across the provinces and territories, served by about 8,000 priests. It was the first European faith in what is now Canada, arriving in 1497 when John Cabot landed on Newfoundland and raised the Venetian and Papal banners, claiming the land for his sponsor King Henry VII of England, while recognizing the religious authority of the Catholic Church.

The entire Catholic Church in Canada is placed under the Primate of Canada which corresponds to the Archdiocese of Quebec and its bishop, the Primate of Canada. Currently, Gérald Cyprien Lacroix is the Primate of Canada. The Pope is represented in Canada by the Apostolic Nunciature in Canada (Ottawa).

==== Eastern Orthodoxy ====

Adherents of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Canada belong to several ecclesiastical jurisdictions. Historically, Eastern Orthodoxy was introduced to Canada during the course of 19th century, mainly through emigration of Christians from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Honouring such diverse heritage, Eastern Orthodoxy in Canada is traditionally organized in accordance with patrimonial jurisdictions of autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches, each of them having its own hierarchy with dioceses and parishes.

According to 2011 census data, there were 550,690 Orthodox Christians. The Greek Orthodox community constitutes the largest Eastern Orthodox community in Canada, with 220,255 adherents, followed by other communities: Russian Orthodox (25,245), Ukrainian Orthodox (23,845), Serbian Orthodox (22,780), Romanian Orthodox (7,090), Macedonian Orthodox (4,945), Bulgarian Orthodox (1,765), Antiochian Orthodox (1,220) and several other minor communities within Eastern Orthodoxy. A number of 207,480 adherents reported only as Christian Orthodox.

==== Oriental Orthodoxy ====

Adherents of Oriental Orthodox Christianity in Canada also belong to several ethnic communities and ecclesiastical jurisdictions. According to 2011 census data, Coptic Orthodox community constitutes the largest Oriental Orthodox community in Canada, with 16,255 adherents. It is followed by other communities: Armenian Orthodox (13,730), Ethiopian Orthodox (3,025), Syriac Orthodox (3,060) and several other minor communities within Oriental Orthodoxy.

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has had a presence in Canada since its organization in New York State in 1830. Canada has been used as a refuge territory by members of the LDS Church to avoid enforcement of anti-polygamy laws by the United States government. The first LDS Church in Canada was established in 1895 in what would become Alberta; it was the first stake of the Church to be established outside the United States. The LDS Church has founded several communities in Alberta.

In the 2021 census sampling, about 0.2% of the population (equal to about 87,725 people) claimed to be members of the LDS Church.
In 2021, the LDS Church claimed around 200,000 members in Canada; It has congregations in all Canadian provinces and territories and possesses at least one temple in six of the ten provinces, including the oldest LDS temple outside the United States. Alberta is the province with the most members of the LDS Church in Canada, having approximately 40% of the total of Canadian LDS Church members and representing 2% of the total population of the province (the National Household survey of 2011 has Alberta with over 50% of the Canadian Mormons and 1.6% of the province&#x27;s population), followed by Ontario and British Columbia.

===Islam===
Four years after Canada&#x27;s founding in 1867, the 1871 Canadian Census found 13 Muslims among the population. The first Canadian mosque was constructed in Edmonton in 1938, when there were approximately 700 Muslims in the country. This building is now part of the museum at Fort Edmonton Park. The years after World War II saw a small increase in the Muslim population. However, Muslims were still a distinct minority. It was only with the removal of European immigration preferences in the late 1960s that Muslims began to arrive in significant numbers.

According to Canada&#x27;s 2001 census, there were 579,740 Muslims in Canada, just under 2% of the population. In 2006, the Muslim population was estimated to be 0.8 million or about 2.6%. In 2010, the Pew Research Centre estimated there were about 0.9 million Muslims in Canada. In the 2011 National Housing Survey, Muslims constituted 3.2% of the population making them largest religious adherents after Christianity. Sunni Islam is followed by the majority while there are significant numbers of Shia Muslims. Ahmadiyya also has a significant proportion with more than 25,000 Ahmadis living in Canada. There are also non-denominational Muslims. As of the 2021 census, the percentage of Muslims in Canada is 4.9%.

In 2007, the CBC introduced a popular television sitcom called &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot;, a contemporary reflection and critical commentary on attitudes towards Islam in Canada. In 2008, the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, visited the Baitun Nur Mosque, the largest mosque in Canada for its inaugural session with the Head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.

===Judaism===


The Jewish community in Canada is almost as old as the nation itself. The earliest documentation of Jews in Canada is British Army records from the Seven Years&#x27; War from 1754. In 1760, General Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst attacked and won Montreal for the British. In his regiment there were several Jews, including four among his officer corps, most notably Lieutenant Aaron Hart who is considered the father of Canadian Jewry. In 1807, Ezekiel Hart was elected to the legislature of Lower Canada, becoming the first Jew in the British Empire to hold an official position. Hart was sworn in on a Hebrew Bible as opposed to a Christian Bible. The next day an objection was raised that Hart had not taken the oath in the manner required for sitting in the assembly – an oath of abjuration, which would have required Hart to swear &quot;on the true faith of a Christian&quot;. Hart was expelled from the assembly, only to be re-elected two more times. In 1768, the first synagogue in Canada was built in Montreal, the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue of Montreal. In 1832, partly because of the work of Ezekiel Hart, a law was passed that guaranteed Jews the same political rights and freedoms as Christians.

The Jewish population saw a growth during the 1880s due to the pogroms of Russia and growing anti-Semitism. Between the years of 1880 and 1930 the Jewish population grew to 155,000. In 1872, Henry Nathan, Jr. became the first Jewish Member of Parliament, representing the Victoria, BC area in the newly created House of Commons. The First World War halted the flow of immigrants into Canada, and after the War there was a change in Canada&#x27;s immigration policy to limit the immigration of people from &quot;non-preferred nations&quot;, i.e., those not from the United Kingdom or otherwise White Anglo-Saxon Protestant nations. In June 1939 Canada and the United States were the last hope for 907 Jewish refugees aboard the steamship SS St. Louis which had been denied landing in Havana although the passengers had entry visas. The Canadian government ignored the protests of Canadian Jewish organizations. King said the crisis was not a &quot;Canadian problem&quot; and Blair added in a letter to O.D. Skelton, Undersecretary of State for External Affairs, dated June 16, 1939, &quot;No country could open its doors wide enough to take in the hundreds of thousands of Jewish people who want to leave Europe: the line must be drawn somewhere.&quot; The ship finally had to return to Germany. During the Second World War almost twenty thousand Canadian Jews volunteered to fight overseas. Nearly 40,000 Holocaust survivors moved to Canada in the late 1940s to rebuild their lives.

In 2010, the Canadian Jewish community was the fourth largest in the world and practises in both of the official languages of Canada. There is an increase in the number of people that use Hebrew, other than for religious ceremonies, while there is a decline in the Yiddish language. Most of Canada&#x27;s Jews live in Ontario and Quebec, with Toronto being the largest Jewish population centre. In 2009, anti-Semitic incidents jumped fivefold.

===Baháʼí Faith===
The Canadian community is one of the earliest western communities of the Baháʼí Faith, at one point sharing a joint National Spiritual Assembly with the United States, and is a co-recipient of `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá&#x27;s Tablets of the Divine Plan. The first North American woman to declare herself a Baháʼí was Kate C. Ives, of Canadian ancestry, though not living in Canada at the time. Moojan Momen, in reviewing &quot;The Origins of the Baháʼí Community of Canada, 1898–1948&quot; notes that &quot;the Magee family... are credited with bringing the Baháʼí Faith to Canada. Edith Magee became a Baháʼí in 1898 in Chicago and returned to her home in London, Ontario, where four other female members of her family became Baháʼís. This predominance of women converts became a feature of the Canadian Baháʼí community...&quot;

===Druze Faith===
In 2018, there were 25,000 Druze living in Canada, and fewer than 5,000 of them live in the Greater Toronto Area. They are mostly of Lebanese and Syrian descent. Druze practise Druzism, a monotheistic religion encompasses aspects of Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism and Greek philosophy, among influences.

==Indian religions==
===Hinduism===
Hinduism is a minority religion followed by 2.3% of the population of the Canada. According to the 2021 census, there are 828,195 Hindus in Canada.

Hindus in Canada are generally Indian immigrants (mainly Punjabi, Gujarati, and Haryanvi) from India who began arriving in British Columbia about 100 years ago and continue to immigrate today. There is a significant number of Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus in Canada who immigrated from Sri Lanka during the 1983 communal riots in Sri Lanka. Nepali Hindus, Caribbean Hindus from Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname and Guyana and Mauritian Hindus represent sizeable subgroups . There are also Canadian converts to the various sects of Hinduism through the efforts of the Hare Krishna movement, the Gurus during the last 50 years, and other organizations.

The vast majority of Hindus reside in Ontario (primarily in Toronto, Scarborough, Brampton, Hamilton, Windsor and Ottawa), Quebec (primarily around the Montreal area) and British Columbia, (primarily around the Vancouver area).

===Buddhism===
According to the 2011 Census, Buddhism is followed by 1.1% of the population of the Canada.

Buddhism has been practised in Canada for more than a century and in recent years has grown dramatically. Buddhism arrived in Canada with the arrival of Chinese labourers in the territories during the 19th century. Modern Buddhism in Canada traces to Japanese immigration during the late 19th century. The first Japanese Buddhist temple in Canada was built at the Ishikawa Hotel in Vancouver in 1905. Over time, the Japanese Jōdo Shinshū branch of Buddhism became the prevalent form of Buddhism in Canada and established the largest Buddhist organization in Canada.

===Sikhism===
Sikhism has nearly 800,000 adherents who account for 2.1% of Canada&#x27;s population as of 2021, forming the country&#x27;s fastest-growing and fourth-largest religious group. The largest Sikh populations in Canada are found in Ontario, followed by British Columbia and Alberta. As of the 2021 Census, more than half of Canada&#x27;s Sikhs can be found in one of four cities: Brampton (163,260), Surrey (154,415), Calgary (49,465), and Edmonton (41,385).

Canada is home to the largest national Sikh proportion in the world (2.1%), and also has the second-largest Sikh population in the world, after India. British Columbia has the third-largest Sikh proportion (5.9%) amongst all global administrative divisions, behind only Punjab and Chandigarh in India. British Columbia, Manitoba, and Yukon hold the distinction of being three of the only four administrative divisions in the world with Sikhism as the second most followed religion among the population.

===Jainism===

The first official Jain temple was established in Toronto in 1988. This temple served both the Digambar and Śvetāmbara communities.

==Other religions==
===Modern Paganism===

Census data showed Modern Paganism grew by 281 per cent between 1991 and 2001, making it the fastest growing religion in Canada during that decade.

====Druidry====
Druidry in Canada encompasses a variety of groves and seed groups affiliated with major Druid organizations.

In Neo-Druid history a notable community was the Reformed Druids of North America, one of whose four founders was Canadian, which served both the US Druid community and the Canadian Druid community. Neo-Druidism largely spread in Canada through the Ancient Order of the Druids during the 19th century.

== Irreligion ==
Irreligious Canadians include atheists, agnostics, and humanists. The surveys may also include those who are spiritual, deists, and pantheists. According to Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, among those estimated 4.9 million Canadians of no religion, an estimated 1.9 million would specify atheist, 1.8 million would specify agnostic, and 1.2 million humanist. 

In 1991 the irreligious made up 12.3% of the Canadian population. The 2021 Canadian census reported that 34.6% of Canadians declare no religious affiliation, which is up from 23.9% in the 2011 Canadian census and 16.5% in the 2001 Canadian census. 

Some non-religious Canadians have formed associations, such as the Humanist Association of Canada, Mouvement laïque québécois, Toronto Secular Alliance or the Centre for Inquiry Canada, as well as a number of University Campus Groups.

== Canada-origin or centred movements ==

=== Hutterites ===
The Hutterites are a communal German-origin ethnoreligious branch of Anabaptists, after series of migrations, almost all of them live in colonies in Western Canada.

=== New Tidings Religion ===
The New Tidings Religion or &quot;Wocekiye&quot; of the Canadian Sioux peoples is a reform revitalization movement, both indigenist and syncretistic, within Sioux Faith that appeared in 1900 and practiced until the present.

=== Toronto Blessing ===
The Toronto-Blessing is a neo-charismatic Christian revival that began in January 1994 at the Toronto Airport Vineyard church that later became a flagship church of global Catch the Fire World ministry. The primary speaker at these meetings for the first few months was pastor Randy Clark. The Toronto Blessing appears to share activities of laughter, crying, falling down, shaking and claims of miraculous healings.

=== Lev Tahor ===
Lev Tahor is a Jewish fundamentalist sect formed in the 1980s in Israel by Israeli-Canadian rabbi Shlomo Helbrans. In 2001 he fled to Canada, where he reestablished his community in Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts, Quebec. From 2003 to 2013, the movement located in Canada. It follows a strict version of halakha, including its own unique practices such as lengthy prayer sessions, arranged marriages between teenagers, and head-to-toe coverings for females.

==Age and religion==
According to the 2001 census, the major religions in Canada have the following median age. Canada has a median age of 37.3.

*Presbyterian 46.1
*United Church 44.1
*Anglican 43.8
*Lutheran 43.3
*Jewish 41.5
*Greek Orthodox 40.7
*Baptist 39.3
*Buddhist 38.0
*Catholic 37.8
*Pentecostal 33.5
*No religion 31.9
*Hindu 30.2
*Sikh 29.7
*Muslim 28.1

==Census results==
Census information about religious affiliation is derived from the long form census question on religious affiliation (question 30) which is asked once every ten years on every second census.

The actual question is;

&quot;What is this person&#x27;s religion?

The question indicated which denomination or belief the person identified with, even if this person is not currently a practising member of that group.

===Historical trends since 1900===
*Sources: Based on National trajectory Census since end&#x27;s XIX Century, specially 1991, 2001 and 2011 Census, Catholic membership evolution since 1901, Overall Muslim membership evolution since 1901, Pew Center Research and Historical information from the Canadian Encyclopedia

===Raw data===
In the Canada 2011 National Household Survey (the 2011 census did not ask about religious affiliation but the survey sent to a subset of the population did), 69% of the Canadian population list Catholicism or Protestantism or another Christian denomination as their religion, down 8% from the Canada 2001 Census, where 77% of the population listed a Christian religion. Representing two out of five Canadians, the Catholic Church in Canada is by far the country&#x27;s largest single denomination. Secularization has been growing since the 1960s. In 2011, 23.9% declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5% in 2001.

In recent years there have been substantial rises in non-Christian religions in Canada. From the 1991 to 2011, Islam grew by 316%, Hinduism 217%, Sikhism 209%, and Buddhism 124%. The growth of non-Christian religions expressed as a percentage of Canada&#x27;s population rose from 4% in 1991 to 8% in 2011. In terms of the ratio of non-Christians to Christians, it rose from 19 Christians (95% of religious population) to 1 non-Christian (5% of religious population) in 1991 to 8 Christians (89%) to 1 non-Christian (11%) in 2011, a rise of 135% of the ratio of non-Christians to Christians, or a decline of 6.5% of Christians to non-Christians, in 20 years.

===By province/territory===
1Includes Pagan, Wicca, Unity – New Thought – Pantheist, Scientology, Rastafarian, New Age, Gnostic, Satanist, etc.

<doc id="594710" wikidata="Q716546" url="?curid=594710" title="Bill Barilko">
<text>William &quot;Bashin&#x27; Bill&quot; Barilko (March 25, 1927 – ) was a Canadian ice hockey player who played his entire National Hockey League career for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Over five seasons, Barilko won the Stanley Cup four times in 1947, 1948, 1949, and 1951. Barilko died in August 1951 in a floatplane crash during a fishing trip to Quebec. Barilko&#x27;s #5 was retired by the Leafs. He was the subject of the 1993 single &quot;Fifty Mission Cap&quot; by The Tragically Hip.

== Personal life ==
Barilko was of Ukrainian descent and had a brother, Alex, and sister, Anne. He was engaged to Louise Hastings.

==Professional career==
In February 1947, Bill Barilko was called up to the Toronto Maple Leafs from the PCHL&#x27;s Hollywood Wolves and played for Toronto until his death. He was assigned sweater #21 when he debuted for the Leafs. He changed to #19 for the 1948–49 and 1949–50 seasons. The #5 (which was retired by the Leafs) was worn by Barilko for only one season, 1950–51. During that span of five seasons, Barilko and the Toronto Maple Leafs were Stanley Cup champions on four occasions: 1947, 1948, 1949, 1951. The last goal ever scored by Barilko was in overtime against the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; netminder Gerry McNeil. The goal was the overtime game-winning goal in Game 5 of the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals (April 21, 1951).

==Disappearance and death==
On August 26, 1951, Barilko joined his dentist, Henry Hudson, on a flight aboard Hudson&#x27;s Fairchild 24 floatplane to Rupert House in northern Quebec for a weekend fishing trip. On the return trip to Porcupine Lake, the single-engine plane disappeared and its passengers remained missing. Eleven years later, in June 1962, helicopter pilot Gary Fields discovered the wreckage of the plane about north of Cochrane, Ontario, about 56 kilometres (35 miles) off course. The cause of the crash was deemed to have been a combination of pilot inexperience, poor weather, and overloaded cargo.

Barilko is buried in Timmins, Ontario, Canada, at the Timmins Memorial Cemetery.

==&quot;Fifty Mission Cap&quot;==
The 1993 song &quot;Fifty Mission Cap&quot; by The Tragically Hip is about Barilko&#x27;s death and the Leafs&#x27; subsequent Stanley Cup drought. The song has been credited as singlehandedly reviving Barilko&#x27;s fame after he had lapsed into semi-obscurity; the song remains a staple part of the Leafs&#x27; warm-up playlist at every home game, and the Leafs have a framed, handwritten copy of Gord Downie&#x27;s lyrics to the song in their private players&#x27; lounge. Whenever the band played the Air Canada Centre, Barilko&#x27;s retired-number banner was always left in place during the concert, and when Downie died on October 17, 2017, the team incorporated Barilko&#x27;s banner into its Downie tribute.

==Honours==
Barilko played in the 1947, 1948 and 1949 NHL All-Star Game, scoring a goal in the 1949 game.

Barilko won four Stanley Cups with the Maple Leafs in 1947, 1948, 1949, and 1951.

Until October 15, 2016, Barilko&#x27;s #5 was one of only two numbers retired by the Maple Leafs (Ace Bailey&#x27;s #6 was the other).

Barilko&#x27;s story was published in the 1988 book &quot;Overtime, Overdue: The Bill Barilko Story&quot;, by John Melady, and the 2004 book &quot;Barilko — Without A Trace&quot;, by Kevin Shea.

In 2017, TSN aired the short documentary film &quot;The Mission&quot;, profiling a project to recover the remaining wreckage of Barilko&#x27;s plane; the film took its title from &quot;Fifty Mission Cap&quot;, and it thematically touched on the song&#x27;s role in Barilko&#x27;s story. The film received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Sports Feature Segment at the 6th Canadian Screen Awards in 2018.

<text> is an asteroid, slow rotator and tumbler, classified as a near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) of the Apollo group, approximately in diameter, making it the largest PHA known to exist. It was discovered on 13 May 1999, by astronomers of the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research at the Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico.

== Orbit and classification ==

 orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0–4.5 AU once every 4 years and 6 months (1,644 days; semi-major axis of 2.73 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.64 and an inclination of 14° with respect to the ecliptic. This makes it also a Mars-crossing asteroid.

The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its first identification as at Palomar Observatory in April 1990, more than 9 years prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro.

=== Close approaches ===

 has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of It passed closer than 0.20 AU to the Earth five times in the last century (0.033 AU in 1990), but its next closest approach in the 21st century will be in 2075 at and in August 2137 at . For comparison, the planet Venus passed from Earth in 2022.

== Physical characteristics ==
In the SMASS and Tholen classification, is an X-type asteroid. It has also been characterized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid, which seems more likely due to its exceptionally low albedo &quot;(see below)&quot;.

=== Rotation period ===

Radar imaging by Goldstone and Arecibo observatories revealed that has an unusually slow and possibly chaotic rotation period, similar to that of asteroid 4179 Toutatis.

In July 1999, a rotational lightcurve of was obtained from photometric observations. It gave a period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.7 magnitude (), and suggested that the body is in a non-principal axis rotation, commonly known as tumbling.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

 measures between 5 and 7 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an exceptionally low albedo of 0.02. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; derives an albedo of 0.03 and adopts a diameter of 7 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 15.2.

== Numbering and naming ==

This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 16 February 2003. As of 2018, it has not been named.

<doc id="594712" wikidata="Q136897" url="?curid=594712" title="Pallenis">
<text>Pallenis is a small genus of flowering plants in the tribe Inuleae within the family Asteraceae. The name is derived from &quot;palea&quot; (chaff), referring to the chaffy receptacle.

This is primarily a Mediterranean genus, occurring in desert and coastal habitats of Southern Europe, North Africa, the Canary Islands and the Middle East. The range of one species extends eastward into Central Asia.

The genus consists of annual or biennial herbaceous plants with white, sub-silky hairs on the soft stems, growing to a height of 20–50 cm. They grow on uncultivated or disturbed land and roadsides. They are hardy, surviving in dry to very dry environments or cold spells.

The small, alternate, entire leaves are elliptic to obovate. They have short petioles at the base of the stem but are sessile in the upper half.

The solitary inflorescence grows at the top of the branches. The large, slightly convex receptacle shows numerous, yellowish orange, hermaphrodite disc florets and two whorls of yellow ray florets. They flower from March to July.

The long, villous, involucral bracts end in an apical sharp-pointed spine. The achene is glabrous or is covered with short hairs.

The essential oil of &quot;Pallenis spinosa&quot; consists for the main part of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids.

&quot;Pallenis maritima&quot; is a protected plant in southern France.

&quot;Pallenis hierochuntica&quot; is sold under the name rose of Jericho. This plant also grows in the region from North-Africa to Asia.

<text>The umbilical vein is a vein present during fetal development that carries oxygenated blood from the placenta into the growing fetus. The umbilical vein provides convenient access to the central circulation of a neonate for restoration of blood volume and for administration of glucose and drugs.

The blood pressure inside the umbilical vein is approximately 20 mmHg.

==Fetal circulation==
The unpaired umbilical vein carries oxygen and nutrient rich blood derived from fetal-maternal blood exchange at the chorionic villi. More than two-thirds of fetal hepatic circulation is via the main portal vein, while the remainder is shunted from the left portal vein via the ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava, eventually being delivered to the fetal right atrium.

==Closure==
Closure of the umbilical vein usually occurs after the umbilical arteries have closed. This prolongs the communication between the placenta and fetal heart, allowing for a sort of autotransfusion of remaining blood from the placenta to the fetus.

Within a week of birth, the neonate&#x27;s umbilical vein is obliterated and is replaced by a fibrous cord called the round ligament of the liver (also called &quot;&quot;). It extends from the umbilicus to the transverse fissure, where it joins with the falciform ligament of the liver to separate segment 4 from segments 2 and 3 of the left hepatic lobe.

==Recanalization==
Under extreme pressure, the round ligament may reopen to allow the passage of blood. Such recanalization may be evident in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Patients with cirrhosis experience rapid growth of scar tissue in and around the liver, often functionally obstructing nearby vessels. Vessel occlusion increases vascular resistance and therefore leads to hypertension. In portal hypertension, the vessels surrounding the liver are subjected to abnormally high blood pressure—so high, in fact, that the force of the blood pressing against the round ligament is sufficient to recanalize the structure. This leads to a condition called caput medusae.

==Catheterization==
A newborn baby has a patent umbilical vein for at least a week after birth. This umbilical vein may be catheterised for ready intravenous access. It may be used as a site for regular transfusion in cases of erythroblastosis or hemolytic disease. It also provides a route for measuring central venous pressure.

<doc id="594717" wikidata="Q1429180" url="?curid=594717" title="Alpine garden">
<text>An alpine garden (or alpinarium, alpinum) is a domestic or botanical garden, or more often a part of a larger garden, specializing in the collection and cultivation of alpine plants growing naturally at high altitudes around the world, such as in the Caucasus, Pyrenees, Rocky Mountains, Alps, Himalayas and Andes. It is one of the most common types of rock garden.

Although it is often associated with rocks, an alpine garden does not require rocks to thrive. It is the alpine plants that is the focus, not the rocks. Scientifically, alpine plants are characterized as plants that grow above the tree line in mountainous regions, where the environment makes it hard for plants to produce woody tissues. From the horticulture perspective, any plants with a suitable size and is able to withstand harsh conditions such as a rock garden, trough, or raised beds could be considered as alpine. They are often smaller in statue and more hardy.

An alpine garden tries to imitate the conditions of the plants&#x27; place of origin. One example of this is using large stones and gravel beds, rather than the soil that naturally grows there. Though the plants can cope with low temperatures, they dislike standing in damp soil during the winter months. The soil used is typically poor (sandy) and extremely well-drained. One of the main obstacles in developing an alpine garden is the unsuitable conditions which exist in some areas, particularly mild or severe winters and heavy rainfall, such as those present in the United Kingdom and Ireland. This can be avoided by growing the plants in an alpine house (essentially an unheated greenhouse), which tries to reproduce the ideal conditions, or just covering them with a raised sheet of glass in winter. According to some Austrian sources, the first true alpine garden was created by Anton Kerner von Marilaun in 1875 on the Blaser Mountain, in Tyrol, Austria, at an altitude of .

==Vegetation==

Typical plants found in an alpine garden include: 
* &quot;Androsace&quot;
* &quot;Arabis alpina&quot; (rock cress)
* &quot;Campanula&quot; - alpine species
* &quot;Dianthus&quot; - alpine species
* &quot;Gentiana&quot;
* &quot;Geranium dalmaticum&quot; (cranesbill)
* &quot;Globularia&quot;
* &quot;Iberis sempervirens&quot; (candytuft)
* &quot;Leontopodium&quot;
* &quot;Phlox subulata&quot;
* &quot;Pulsatilla vulgaris&quot; (pasque flower)
* &quot;Primula&quot; - alpine species
* &quot;Ranunculus&quot; (buttercup)
* &quot;Rhodanthemum hosmariense&quot;
* &quot;Saxifraga&quot; - alpine species
* &quot;Scutellaria orientalis&quot; (helmet flower)
* &quot;Sedum spathulifolium&quot; (stonecrop)
* &quot;Sisyrinchium&quot;
* &quot;Thymus&quot; (thyme)

<doc id="594724" wikidata="Q123279" url="?curid=594724" title="Dryas (plant)">
<text>Dryas is a genus of perennial cushion-forming evergreen dwarf shrubs in the family Rosaceae, native to the arctic and alpine regions of Europe, Asia and North America. The genus is named after the dryads, the tree nymphs of ancient Greek mythology. The classification of &quot;Dryas&quot; within the Rosaceae has been unclear. The genus was formerly placed in the subfamily Rosoideae, but is now placed in subfamily Dryadoideae.

The species are superficially similar to &quot;Geum&quot; (with which they share the common name avens), &quot;Potentilla&quot;, and &quot;Fragaria&quot; (strawberry). However, &quot;Dryas&quot; are distinct in having flowers with &quot;eight&quot; petals (rarely seven or up to ten), instead of the five petals found in most other genera in the Rosaceae. The flowers are erect and white with a yellow centre (&quot;Dryas integrifolia&quot;, &quot;Dryas octopetala&quot;) or pendulous and all-yellow (&quot;Dryas drummondii&quot;), and held conspicuously above the small plants. This makes them very popular in rockeries and alpine gardens. The hybrid &quot;Dryas&quot; × &quot;suendermannii&quot;, with cream coloured flowers, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

&quot;Dryas&quot; tolerates a wide variety of unshaded habitats, including alpine situations with sand or gravel substrate, similar substrates in flat tundra lowlands, and also fen habitats upon organic substrate where some shading from adjacent sedges or shrubs may occur.

The Younger Dryas and Older Dryas stadials are geological periods of cold temperature that are named after &quot;Dryas octopetala&quot;, which flourished during that time and is used as a fossil indicator of those periods.

==Taxonomy==
===Species===
&quot;Dryas&quot; comprises three species, but the genus is in need of taxonomic revision:

<text>Gura Humorului (; Hebrew and Yiddish: גורה חומורולוי - &quot;Gure Humuruluei&quot; or גורא הומאָרא - &quot;Gura Humora&quot;; German and Polish: &quot;Gura Humora&quot;) is a town in Suceava County, northeastern Romania. It is situated in the historical region of Bukovina.

Gura Humorului is the seventh largest urban settlement in the county, with a population of 13,278 inhabitants, according to the 2021 census. It was declared a town in 1904 and it became a resort in 2005. The town administers the former village of Voroneț (which became a neighborhood), site of Voroneț Monastery.

== Administration and local politics ==

=== Town council ===
The town&#x27;s current local council has the following political composition, according to the results of the 2020 local elections:

== Geography ==
Gura Humorului is located in the north-eastern part of Romania, in southern Bukovina. The town is situated at the eastern limit of Obcinele Bucovinei Mountains, in Humorului Depression, at the confluence of Moldova River and Humor River. The average altitude of the town is . The European route E58 and the Suceava–Vatra Dornei railway pass through the town. Suceava, the county capital, is located away. The town of Frasin is located nearby Gura Humorului (only away).

== Demographics ==
According to the 1775 Austrian census of Bukovina, its population comprised only about 60,000 spread over . In order to encourage the development of this sparsely-settled land, the authorities subsidized the immigration of colonists to Bukovina. With the end of the first wave of settlement, colonists were to continue arriving at their own expense. As a result of these policies, the census of 1910 showed that the population had risen to over 800,000. People of many different ethnic groups took part in this immigration, including Germans, Rusyns, Hungarians, Ukrainians, Poles, Romanians, and Jews.

In 1992, Gura Humorului had a population of about 17,000 inhabitants were living within the town limits. As of 2016, the town&#x27;s population surpassed this limit by a very slim margin.

According to the 2011 census data, Gura Humorului had a total population of 13,667 inhabitants: 97.03% were ethnic Romanians, 1.79% Roma, 0.52% Germans , 0.27% Poles, 0.12% Ukrainians, 0.10% Hungarians, and 0.07% Russians .

Gura Humorului is the seventh most populated urban locality in Suceava County and the second most populated locality with the status of town (after Vicovu de Sus).

== History ==

Between 1774 and 1918, Gura Humorului belonged to the Habsburg monarchy. During World War I, Bukovina became a battlefield between Austria opposing Russian and Romanian troops. Although the Russians were finally driven out in 1917, defeated Austria would cede the Bukovina province to Romania through the Treaty of Saint-Germain (1919).

== Jewish history of Gura Humorului ==

No Jews lived in Gura Humorului before 1835, when they were allowed to settle, joining other, already represented, ethnic groups (such as Germans from Bohemia, mainly from the Böhmerwald: thirty families settled on the mountainous and densely forested lands nearby the town, establishing a quarter named &quot;Bori&quot;). The Jewish community began to flourish in 1869, when they formed around a third of the town&#x27;s population (880 people); the same year, a Beth midrash was established.

A turning point in the town&#x27;s history was the disastrous fire of May 11, 1899 which destroyed most of the town, more than 400 houses, including many Jewish businesses and homes. It was rebuilt with donations from American Jewish communities. The Jewish community in Gura Humorului continued to grow, reaching 1,951 members in 1927.

Jewish cultural life reached its peak during the interwar period. The languages of choice in the town life were Yiddish, German, and Romanian. Most of the Jewish community adhered to Orthodox Judaism, and Jewish youngsters studied the Torah along with secular subjects such as geography, history, and mathematics. The community had established Jewish social and political institutions that contributed to all fields of public life.

While persecutions began to increase under the threats posed by Romanian fascist movements such as the Iron Guard, it was World War II that brought an end to Jewish presence in Gura Humorului. Under the dictatorship of Ion Antonescu, Jews were rounded up and deported to Transnistria, where most of them perished – mass murdered through various means, including shootings and criminal negligence (see Holocaust in Romania). Virtually all of the Jewish community in Gura Humorului was deported: 2,945 people were all transported on October 10, 1941.

The vast majority of survivors emigrated to Israel in 1947–1951. Statistics show that they numbered below 500 people in all at the time of their departure.

<text>Haworth Inc. is a privately held, family-owned office furniture manufacturer headquartered in Holland, Michigan, United States. Founded in 1948 by G. W. Haworth, the company designs and manufactures seating, tables, movable walls, panels, storage, and wood casegoods. Haworth&#x27;s furniture pieces, combined with interior design and technology, are intended to create a focus on &quot;organic workspaces that help people perform their best.&quot; Haworth employs 7,500 workers and has 650 dealerships in more than 120 countries. 2021 global sales reached $1.96 billion, a 6.2-percent increase from 2020.

==Brands/companies==
Haworth&#x27;s brand portfolio includes Italian design brands Poltrona Frau, Cassina, and Cappellini; technology software Bluescape; and outdoor furniture maker JANUS et Cie. The Haworth Health Environments brand offers healthcare furniture. Haworth also owns shares in BuzziSpace, a Belgium-based company focusing on acoustic and collaborative workspace.

==History==
===1940s–70s===
During the 1940s, while teaching Industrial Arts at Holland High School, G.W. Haworth started a woodworking shop as a hobby in his garage. His intention was to increase the income for his children&#x27;s future college education by producing and selling special-order wood products. As his reputation and orders grew, he expanded to a 4,800-square-foot plant in Holland, Michigan and decided to turn his sideline into a full-time business, launching Modern Products in 1948. In the 1950s, the focus of Modern Products shifted toward office environments in response to the development of modular office partitions, and the company changed its name to Modern Partitions.

In 1976, G.W.&#x27;s son, Dick Haworth, took over as president and CEO. Under Dick&#x27;s leadership, the company&#x27;s name changed to Haworth and focused exclusively on contract office furniture. Dick invented the first cubicle wall panels with internal wiring. These panels could be snapped together and eliminated the client&#x27;s need to pay electricians to wire office spaces. In 1977, Haworth International Inc. was formed to set up foreign licenses for the manufacture and marketing of office interior systems. A year later, Haworth opened a national showroom in Chicago&#x27;s Merchandise Mart.

===1980–2000: Rise and expansion===
During the next two decades, Haworth developed and patented a number of industry innovations, including panel-to-panel cabling systems. In the early 1980s, the company moved its headquarters to One Haworth Center in Holland, while showrooms were open or renovated in 18 North American cities and four international locations. Office seating was also added to the Haworth product offering being built in Holland, Michigan. By 1986, Haworth had become the third-largest office furniture manufacturer in the U.S., with sales topping $300 million and a workforce of 2,600 employees.

In 1988, Haworth became a global company after undertaking a strategic expansion. The business acquired 15 companies in Europe and North America, then built in Asia to expand its sales and dealer network. In 1995, the company&#x27;s Ideation Group formed, applying user-based research to concepts and products. In 1996, competitor Steelcase was found at fault in a patent infringement suit brought by Haworth in 1985. Steelcase was ordered to pay $211.5 million in damages and interest.

===2000 to present: a global focus===
In 2000, Haworth passed the $2 billion mark in annual revenues. In 2008, Haworth&#x27;s new corporate headquarters, a LEED-NC Gold-certified facility, opened to serve as a living lab. In 2009, Haworth became the first company in the industry to achieve zero waste to landfill in all U.S. manufacturing facilities. That same year, Dick Haworth stepped aside and his son, Matthew, then 40, became chairman.

The company purchased Italian furniture group Poltrona Frau in 2014, gaining a majority stake in several Italian design brands including Cappellini, Cassina, and Poltrona Frau.
In 2013, Bluescape was launched to support virtual work and visual collaboration. &quot;We recognized that our deep insight into the physical workplace could be translated into user experience in a virtual workspace,&quot; Dick Haworth said. 
The company purchased outdoor furniture company JANUS et Cie for an undisclosed amount in 2016. In 2017, the company&#x27;s headquarters was given a design refresh by Patricia Urquiola and Haworth Collection, which partnered with Pablo Designs and GAN rugs.

== Current leadership ==
Franco Bianchi has served as CEO and president of the company since 2005. In 2009, Dick Haworth stepped aside and his son, Matthew, became chairman of the family-owned business. The company&#x27;s founder, G.W. Haworth, died in 2006 at age 95.

==Company culture==
Haworth issued special bonuses to workers totaling more than $5 million for the company&#x27;s 70th anniversary in 2018.

Haworth became the first in the contract furniture industry to achieve zero waste to landfill in all U.S. manufacturing facilities in 2009.
The company also donated 42 acres of wetland for restoration to Outdoor Discovery Center-Macatawa Greenway&#x27;s Project Clarity, an organized effort to improve the water quality of Holland&#x27;s Lake Macatawa.

Haworth maintains research partnerships with several global partners, including Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft in Germany, University of Michigan, Western Michigan University and London&#x27;s Royal College of Art. The company&#x27;s Human Performance Lab studies the impact of visual distractions on workplace performance.

==Noteworthy products/projects==
Popular Haworth products include its research-backed ergonomic office chairs Fern, Zody, and Very, and Planes Height-Adjustable tables.

Haworth has partnered with numerous designers, including Patricia Urquiola, a Spanish architect and designer who has been a Haworth collaborator since 2013. Studio Urquiola designed Haworth&#x27;s Chicago showroom for NeoCon 2013, 2014, and 2015, and gave the company&#x27;s corporate headquarters a refresh in 2017.

Spectrum Health, West Michigan&#x27;s largest healthcare provider, tapped Haworth to furnish their idea for a new kind of doctor&#x27;s office, with the Strive health care office opening in downtown Grand Rapids in 2017. The facility functions as a learning lab for Spectrum to test new ideas and develop a deeper understanding of consumer needs.

In June 2021, a nearly 2-year project to renovate the Haworth Hotel in Holland was completed. The renovation, funded jointly by Hope College and the Haworth family, was led by designer Patricia Urquiola. The newly remodeled building is intended to &quot;foster interactions between Hope College staff and students, community members and Haworth guests.&quot;

<doc id="594730" wikidata="Q121926" url="?curid=594730" title="Henry Louis Le Chatelier">
<text>Henry Louis Le Chatelier (; 8 October 1850 – 17 September 1936) was a French chemist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He devised Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle, used by chemists and chemical engineers to predict the effect a changing condition has on a system in chemical equilibrium.

==Early life==
Le Chatelier was born on 8 October 1850 in Paris and was the son of French materials engineer Louis Le Chatelier and Louise Durand. His father was an influential figure who played important roles in the birth of the French aluminium industry, the introduction of the Martin-Siemens processes into the iron and steel industries, and the rise of railway transportation. Le Chatelier&#x27;s father profoundly influenced his son&#x27;s future. Henry Louis had one sister, Marie, and four brothers, Louis (1853–1928), Alfred (1855–1929), George (1857–1935), and André (1861–1929). His mother raised the children by regimen, described by Henry Louis: &quot;I was accustomed to a very strict discipline: it was necessary to wake up on time, to prepare for your duties and lessons, to eat everything on your plate, etc. All my life I maintained respect for order and law. Order is one of the most perfect forms of civilization.&quot;

As a child, Le Chatelier attended the Collège Rollin in Paris. At the age of 19, after only one year of instruction in specialized engineering, he followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by enrolling in the École Polytechnique on 25 October 1869. Like all the pupils of the Polytechnique, in September 1870, Le Chatelier was named second lieutenant and later took part in the Siege of Paris. After brilliant successes in his technical schooling, he entered the École des Mines in Paris in 1871.

Le Chatelier married Geneviève Nicolas, a friend of the family and sister of four fellow students of the Polytechnique. They had seven children, four girls and three boys, five of whom entered scientific fields; two died preceding Le Chatelier&#x27;s death.

==Career==
Despite training as an engineer, and even with his interests in industrial problems, Le Chatelier chose to teach chemistry rather than pursue a career in industry. In 1887, he was appointed head of the general chemistry to the preparatory course of the École des Mines in Paris. He tried unsuccessfully to get a position teaching chemistry at the École polytechnique in 1884 and again in 1897.

At the Collège de France, Le Chatelier succeeded Schützenberger as chair of inorganic chemistry. Later he taught at the Sorbonne university, where he replaced Henri Moissan.

At the Collège de France, Le Chatelier taught: 
:*Phenomena of combustion (1898)
:*Theory of chemical equilibria, high temperature measurements and phenomena of dissociation (1898–1899)
:*Properties of metal alloys (1899–1900)
:*Iron alloys (1900–1901)
:*General methods of analytical chemistry (1901–1902)
:*General laws of analytical chemistry (1901–1902)
:*General laws of chemical mechanics (1903)
:*Silica and its compounds (1905–1906)
:*Some practical applications of the fundamental principles of chemistry (1906–1907)
:*Properties of metals and some alloys (1907)

After four unsuccessful campaigns (1884, 1897, 1898 and 1900), Le Chatelier was elected to the Académie des sciences (Academy of Science) in 1907. He was also elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1907. In 1924, he became an Honorary Member of the Polish Chemical Society.

==Scientific work==
In chemistry, Le Chatelier is best known for his work on his principle of chemical equilibrium, Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle, and on varying solubility of salts in an ideal solution. He published no fewer than thirty papers on these topics between 1884 and 1914. His results on chemical equilibrium were presented in 1884 at the Académie des sciences in Paris.

Le Chatelier also carried out extensive research on metallurgy and was one of the founders of the technical newspaper &quot;La revue de métallurgie&quot; (Metallurgy Review).

Part of Le Chatelier&#x27;s work was devoted to industry. For example, he was a consulting engineer for a cement company, the &quot;Société des chaux et ciments Pavin de Lafarge&quot;, today known as Lafarge Cement. His 1887 doctoral thesis was dedicated to the subject of mortars: &quot;Recherches expérimentales sur la constitution des mortiers hydrauliques&quot; (Experimental Research on the Composition of Hydraulic Mortars).

On the advice of a paper of Le Chatelier that the combustion of a mixture of oxygen and acetylene in equal parts rendered a flame of more than 3000 celsius, in 1899 Charles Picard (1872-1957) started to investigate this phenomenon but failed because of soot deposits. In 1901 the latter consulted with Edmond Fouché and together they obtain a perfectly stable flame and the oxyacetylene industry was born. In 1902 Fouché invented a gas welder tool with French patent number 325,403 and in 1910 Picard developed the needle valve.

Le Chatelier in 1901 attempted the direct combination of the two gases nitrogen and hydrogen at a pressure of 200 atm and 600 °C in the presence of metallic iron. An air compressor forced the mixture of gases into a steel Berthelot bomb, where a platinum spiral heated them and the reduced iron catalyst. A terrific explosion occurred which nearly killed an assistant. Le Chatelier found that the explosion was due to the presence of air in the apparatus used. And thus it was left for Fritz Haber to succeed where several noted French chemists, including Thenard, Sainte Claire Deville and even Berthelot had failed. Less than five years later, Haber and Carl Bosch were successful in producing ammonia on a commercial scale. Near the end of his life, Le Chatelier wrote, &quot;I let the discovery of the ammonia synthesis slip through my hands. It was the greatest blunder of my scientific career”.

His brother Alfred Le Chatelier, a former soldier, opened the Atelier de Glatigny in the rural area of Glatigny (Le Chesnay), near Versailles, in 1897. The workshop made sandstone ceramics, high-quality porcelain and glassware. In 1901, the critic Henri Cazalis (alias Jean Lahor), listed the workshop as one of the best producers in France of Art Nouveau ceramics. Henry Louis seems to have encouraged Alfred&#x27;s workshop and assisted with experiments in the composition of porcelain and the reactions of quartz inclusions, and also designed a thermoelectric pyrometer to measure temperature in the kilns.

===Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle===

Le Chatelier&#x27;s Principle states that a system always acts to oppose changes in chemical equilibrium; to restore equilibrium, the system will favor a chemical pathway to reduce or eliminate the disturbance so as to restabilize at thermodynamic equilibrium. Put another way,

&quot;If a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a change in concentration, temperature or total pressure, the equilibrium will shift in order to minimize that change.&quot;

This qualitative law enables one to envision the displacement of equilibrium of a chemical reaction.

For example: a change in concentration of a reaction in equilibrium for the following equation:

:N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)

If one increases the pressure of the reactants, the reaction will tend to move towards the products to decrease the pressure of the reaction.

However consider another example: in the contact process for the production of sulfuric acid, the second stage is a reversible reaction:

:2SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2SO3(g)

The forward reaction is exothermic and the reverse reaction is endothermic. Viewed by Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle a larger amount of thermal energy in the system would favor the endothermic reverse reaction, as this would absorb the increased energy; in other words the equilibrium would shift to the reactants in order to remove the stress of added heat. For similar reasons, lower temperatures would favor the exothermic forward reaction, and produce more products. This works in this case, since due to loss of entropy the reaction becomes less exothermic as temperature increases; however reactions that become more exothermic as temperature increases would seem to violate this principle.

==Politics==
It was then typical for scientists and engineers to have a very scientific vision of industry. In the first issue of &quot;La revue de métallurgie&quot;, Le Chatelier published an article describing his convictions on the subject, discussing the scientific management theory of Frederick Winslow Taylor. In 1928, he published a book on Taylorism.

Le Chatelier was politically conservative. In 1934, he published an opinion on the French forty-hour work week law in the Brussels publication &quot;Revue économique internationale&quot;. However, in spite of certain anti-parliamentarian convictions, he kept away from any extremist or radical movements.

==Honours and awards==
Le Chatelier named &quot;chevalier&quot; (knight) of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1887, became &quot;officier&quot; (officer) in 1908, &quot;commandeur&quot; (Knight Commander) in 1919, and was finally awarded the title of &quot;grand officier&quot; (Knight Grand Officer) in May 1927. He was admitted to the Academie des Sciences in 1907.

He was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal of the British Iron and Steel Institute in 1911, admitted as a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1913 and awarded their Davy Medal in 1916.

<doc id="594736" wikidata="Q530676" url="?curid=594736" title="Brian Glover">
<text>Brian Glover (2 April 1934 – 24 July 1997) was an English actor and writer. He worked as a teacher and professional wrestler before commencing an acting career which included films, many roles on British television and work on the stage. His film appearances include &quot;Kes&quot; (1969), &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981) and &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992).

Described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;robust character actor&quot; who played &quot;gruff but likable roles&quot;, he had a &quot;string of roles playing tough guys and criminals&quot;. He once said, &quot;You play to your strengths in this game, and my strength is as a bald-headed, rough-looking Yorkshireman&quot;. Glover was also known as the voice of Gaffer in the Tetley tea commercials. &quot;The Independent&quot; described him upon his death as &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s best-loved actors&quot;.

==Early life and wrestling career==
Glover was born at the Women&#x27;s Hospital, Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire and he lived in Sheffield until 1937 when his parents moved to Lundwood, near Barnsley. His father, Charles Glover, was a wrestler, performing as &quot;the Red Devil&quot;. He attended Barnsley Grammar School and the University of Sheffield, where he supplemented his student grant with appearances as a professional wrestler, going under the ring name &quot;Leon Arras the Man From Paris&quot;. He adopted that name from a wrestler who did not turn up to a match one night, for whom Glover stood in. His wrestling style incorporated a lot of comedy, including the catchphrases &quot;ask &#x27;im, ref&quot; and &quot;&#x27;ow about that then&quot;.

In 1954 he married his first wife, Elaine Foster, and became a teacher at the same Barnsley school where he had been a pupil. He taught English and French from 1954 until 1970, some of it at Longcar Central School, Barnsley, where he met Barry Hines, who was also teaching there. He managed to combine this with regular performances as &quot;Leon Arras&quot;, whose appearances included bouts on &quot;World of Sport&quot;, and in Paris, Milan, Zürich and Barcelona.

==Acting career==
Glover&#x27;s first acting role came playing Mr Sugden, the comically overbearing sports teacher in Ken Loach&#x27;s film &quot;Kes&quot; (a job offered to him when Barry Hines, who wrote the film, suggested him to the director). Although untrained, Glover proved to be a skilled and flexible character actor, using techniques learnt during his wrestling career. His large bald head, stocky build, and distinctive voice, with his Yorkshire accent, garnered him many roles as tough guys and criminals.

He played Bottom in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (BBC TV, 1981) and had a recurring role in the classic sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot; as dim-witted prison inmate Cyril Heslop who, when accused of being illiterate, utters the memorable line &quot;I read a book once! Green, it was.&quot; He played Quilp in &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;, and lent his voice to a number of animated characters, including the &quot;gaffer&quot; of the &quot;Tetley Tea Folk&quot; in a long-running series of television advertisements for Tetley tea, the voice behind the advertising slogan &quot;Bread wi&#x27; nowt taken out&quot; for Allinson bread, and the voice of &quot;Big Pig&quot;, the mascot for the long-running &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music!&quot; album series, appearing on the TV adverts for &quot;Now 3&quot;, &quot;Now 4&quot; and &quot;Now 5&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, &quot;The First Great Train Robbery&quot;, &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, &quot;Alien 3&quot;, &quot;Leon the Pig Farmer&quot; and as General Douglas in a Bollywood hit &quot;1942: A Love Story&quot;. He appeared seven times in &quot;Play for Today&quot;, in three of them as part of a recurring trio of Yorkshiremen: &quot;The Fishing Party&quot;, &quot;Shakespeare or Bust&quot; and &quot;Three for the Fancy&quot;.

Glover&#x27;s performance in &quot;Kes&quot; led to parts at the Royal Court Theatre, London, notably in Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Changing Room&quot; (1971). A season with Britain&#x27;s Royal Shakespeare Company followed, where his roles included Charles the wrestler (and, drawing on his wrestling experience, the fight arranger) in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, and a robust Peter in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. For the Royal National Theatre he appeared in &quot;The Mysteries&quot; (as God, creating the world with the help of a real fork-lift truck), &quot;Saint Joan&quot; and &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

In the film &quot;Brannigan&quot; he claimed to have lost the only fight in his acting career, fighting John Wayne.

His performance in &quot;The Mysteries&quot; secured additional work in the commercial theatre. &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (&quot;Chaucer wi&#x27; nowt taken owt&quot;)(West End) was followed by a return to television and the &quot;Play for Today&quot; series, both as writer and performer and, in turn, more screen roles. Glover wrote a horror themed episode of &quot;Theatre Box&quot; called &quot;Death Angel&quot;, which aired in 1981. He went on to play Lugg, the endearing rogue manservant to Albert Campion in the series &quot;Campion&quot;, and the role of a crook, Griffiths, in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot; in 1985. He played Edouard Dindon in the original London cast of &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;.

In 1991 he starred in the second episode of &quot;Bottom&quot;, in the episode &quot;Gas&quot;, as the hostile neighbour Mr Rottweiler. At the end of his life he acted in John Godber&#x27;s rugby league comedy &quot;Up &#x27;n&#x27; Under&quot; (1998). He was also the voice for the UNO Upholstery TV adverts in 1995 and 1996.

Glover also wrote over twenty plays and short films. In 1982 he was a guest presenter in series six of &quot;Friday Night Saturday Morning&quot;, a late-night BBC chat show.

==Personal life and death==
Glover was married twice, secondly to television producer Tara Prem, the daughter of TV actor Bakhshi Prem, on 2 October 1976. He had two children, one daughter from his first marriage and one son from his second marriage. In September 1996, Glover developed a brain tumour and underwent an operation for it. The tumour was removed and it appeared he had made a full recovery but it returned in the summer of 1997 and Glover died in his sleep in a London hospital on 24 July 1997. He was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London, on 30 July 1997.

<doc id="594739" wikidata="Q2501612" url="?curid=594739" title="Portia White">
<text>Portia May White (June 24, 1911February 13, 1968) was a Canadian contralto, known for becoming the first Black Canadian concert singer to achieve international fame. Growing up as part of her father&#x27;s church choir in Halifax, Nova Scotia, White competed in local singing competitions as a teenager and later trained at the Halifax Conservatory of Music. In 1941 and 1944, she made her national and international debuts as a singer, receiving critical acclaim for her performances of both classical European music and African-American spirituals. White later completed tours throughout Europe, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.

When vocal difficulties and cancer eventually contributed to her retirement in 1952, White settled in Toronto and subsequently taught young Canadian musicians such as Lorne Greene, Dinah Christie, Don Francks, Robert Goulet and Anne Marie Moss. One of White&#x27;s final major public appearances was a special command performance for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in 1964.

White was declared a person of national historic significance by the Government of Canada. Her original supporters in Nova Scotia went on to establish the Nova Scotia Talent Trust, awarding annual arts scholarships to both emerging and established local artists, and the government of Nova Scotia continues to award an annual Portia White Prize. In 2007, White was posthumously awarded a lifetime achievement award by the East Coast Music Association.

==Early life and family==

Portia May White was born June 24, 1911, in Truro, Nova Scotia, the third of 13 children born to Izie Dora (White) and William Andrew White. Her mother was a descendant of Black Loyalists in Nova Scotia, while her father was the son of former slaves from Virginia; he moved to Canada independently. William attended Acadia University in Nova Scotia, later becoming the first Black Canadian to receive a Doctor of Divinity from Acadia. After the First World War, the White family moved to Halifax, and William became the minister of Cornwallis Street Baptist Church.

Many other members of Portia White&#x27;s family went on to achieve distinction in Canadian political and cultural life, including her brothers Jack, a noted Canadian labour union leader; Bill, the first Canadian of African heritage to run for political office in Canada; and Lorne, a regular performer for television show &quot;Singalong Jubilee&quot;. White also became aunt to Senator Donald Oliver and political commentator Sheila White.

Portia White began her musical career at the age of six as a choir member with the Cornwallis Street Baptist Church, where her mother was also the musical director. As White grew older, she became the choir director and assisted with church fundraising by singing on her father&#x27;s weekly radio show. In an interview later in life, White explained that her love of music and performing had developed early:Nobody ever told me to sing, I was born singing. I think that if nobody had ever talked to me, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to communicate in any other way but by singing. I was always bowing in my dreams and singing before people and parading across the stage as a very little girl.As a teenager, White entered a local singing competition with her sister June, the pair performing an aria from Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;. They won first prize. Although White wanted to pursue a singing career, she could not afford professional training at the time.

White entered Dalhousie University in 1929, studying to become a teacher. From the early 1930s she taught in Africville and Lucasville, two small Halifax communities that were predominately Black Nova Scotian, and during this time White was finally able to begin paying for vocal lessons. She competed regularly at the Halifax Music Festival, winning the Helen Kennedy Silver Cup in 1935, 1937 and 1938, until the festival organizers finally decided to award her the cup permanently.

In 1939, White won a scholarship to continue her musical training at the Halifax Conservatory of Music with noted Italian baritone Ernesto Vinci, and Vinci taught her using the &quot;bel canto&quot; vocal style. White soon gave her first formal recital, and after the start of the Second World War she continued singing in concerts and radio shows. She won awards at provincial music festivals, and in mid-1941 she met Edith Read, a visiting headmistress from Branksome Hall in Toronto, who offered to arrange new performing opportunities for White.

==Singing career and later life==

In November 1941, with the support of Read, 30-year-old White made her national debut as a singer in Toronto at the Eaton Auditorium. She was favourably received by audiences, even receiving a career management offer from Oxford University Press the day after her performance. Despite encountering racism as she sought out new performance bookings, White subsequently toured across Canada, performing concerts at venues that included the Governor General&#x27;s Rideau Hall residence.

White sang both classical European music and African-American spirituals, and works by Harry T. Burleigh were a constant part of her concert repertoire. Alongside English pieces, she performed music in Italian, German, French and Spanish, and White&#x27;s three-octave range attracted critical acclaim. Hector Charlesworth&#x27;s review in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; observed White&#x27;s &quot;pungent expression and beauty of utterance&quot;, while a critic with the &quot;Toronto Evening Telegram&quot; said she had a &quot;coloured and beautifully shaded contralto... It is a natural voice, a gift from heaven.&quot; White was compared to noted American contralto Marian Anderson.

After auditioning for Metropolitan Opera general manager Edward Johnson, White made her international debut in New York City in 1944, becoming the first Canadian to perform at New York&#x27;s Town Hall performance space. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported her performance as &quot;remarkable,&quot; and Paul Bowles of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;White, contralto, showed the public... that she not only has a magnificent vocal instrument, but that she also has sufficient musicianship and intelligence to do what she wishes with it.&quot;

White went on to sing at many more concerts across the United States. The province of Nova Scotia and the city of Halifax provided new financial support for the rising star, purchasing a white fox cape for White to wear at performances. In 1945, she signed a contract with artist agency Columbia Concerts Incorporated. A three-month tour of Central and South America and the Caribbean followed in 1946, and she sang in France and Switzerland in 1948. White was the first Black Canadian concert singer to achieve international fame.

Vocal problems, an exhausting itinerary, and an eventual diagnosis of breast cancer later contributed to White&#x27;s early retirement from public singing in 1952, and she settled in Toronto, where she studied with sopranos Gina Cigna and Irene Jessner at the Royal Conservatory of Music. White became a vocal instructor herself and taught both at Branksome Hall and privately. She went on to teach some of Canada&#x27;s up-and-coming musical talent, and her students included singers Lorne Greene, Dinah Christie, Don Francks, Robert Goulet, Anne Marie Moss and Judith Lander. White appeared in Halifax for a few rare performances during the 50s; although she announced her intention to resume a full-time singing career, her return to the concert circuit never fully materialized.

In 1964, she sang in a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, at the opening of the Confederation Centre of the Arts in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. This was one of her last major concerts.

White died in Toronto of cancer on February 13, 1968, aged 56.

==Legacy and honours==
In 1944, White&#x27;s supporters in Nova Scotia formed the Nova Scotia Talent Trust to provide her with financial assistance for her singing career. The Trust went on to establish annual scholarships for other Nova Scotian artists, and continues to award the Portia White Award to artists who show &quot;exceptional commitment and potential in voice.&quot; The Nova Scotia provincial government also awards a Portia White Prize for &quot;cultural and artistic excellence,&quot; and the 1998 inaugural Portia White Prize was awarded to Nova Scotian poet George Elliott Clarke, White&#x27;s great nephew.

White has been declared a person of national historic significance by the Government of Canada, and she was featured in a special issue of Millennium postage stamps celebrating Canadian achievement. At the 2007 East Coast Music Awards, White was posthumously honoured with a Dr. Helen Creighton Lifetime Achievement Award. She is the namesake of Portia White Court, a Halifax street, as well as the Portia White Atrium in Citadel High School. In 2017, the Portia White Youth Award was established as part of the African Nova Scotian Music Awards. In 2022, Branksome Hall unveiled a plaque honouring White on its campus as part of a student-led commemorative ceremony, with guests George Elliott Clarke, singer Measha Brueggergosman-Lee, and White&#x27;s niece, Sheila White, also in attendance.

White has been the subject of Lance Woolaver&#x27;s play &quot;Portia White: First You Dream&quot; (also known simply as &quot;Portia&quot;), Sylvia Hamilton&#x27;s documentary &quot;Portia White: Think on Me&quot;, and George Elliott Clarke&#x27;s book &quot;Portia White&quot;.

A new opera entitled &quot;Aportia Chryptych: A Black Opera for Portia White&quot; by HAUI and Sean Mayes premiered in June 2024 and was produced by the Canadian Opera Company The show made history as the first time a black composer, librettist and stage director have worked on the COC stage.

A portrait of White by Hedley Rainnie is on permanent display at Government House, Nova Scotia in honour of her contributions to the arts.

<doc id="594744" wikidata="Q156304" url="?curid=594744" title="66391 Moshup">
<text>66391 Moshup , provisional designation , is a binary asteroid, classified as a near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Aten group, approximately 1.3 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 20 May 1999, by Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) at the Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s Experimental Test Site in Socorro, New Mexico, United States. It is a Mercury-crosser that comes extremely close to the Sun at a perihelion of 0.2 AU.

== Orbit ==

The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.2–1.1 AU once every 6.18 months (188 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.69 and an inclination of 39° with respect to the ecliptic. A first precovery was taken by 2MASS at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in 1998, extending the body&#x27;s observation arc by one year prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro.

As a potentially hazardous asteroid, it has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of , or 5.4 lunar distances. On 25 May 2036, it will pass from Earth.

== Numbering and naming ==

This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 10 September 2003. It was named from Mohegan legend, after Moshup, a giant who lived in the coastal areas of New England. The asteroid&#x27;s companion is named Squannit, after the wife of Moshup and a medicine woman of the Makiawisug (little people). The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 27 August 2019 ().

== Physical characteristics ==

In the SMASS classification, the asteroid a characterized as a stony S-type asteroid.

=== Satellite ===
Moshup has a minor-planet moon orbiting it. The moon, named Squannit and designated , is approximately 360 metres in diameter, and orbits its primary every 16 hours at a mean distance of 2.6 kilometers. The presence of a companion was suggested by photometric observations made by Pravec and Šarounová and was confirmed by radar observations from Arecibo, announced on 23 May 2001 &quot;(also see below)&quot;. Based on radar imaging, Squannit&#x27;s dimensions are estimated to be meters.

=== Diameter and shape ===
According to radiometric observations from Arecibo Observatory, the asteroid has an effective mean diameter of 1.317 kilometers. The observations were taken from May 21–23, 2001, by Lance A. M. Benner, Steven J. Ostro, Jon D. Giorgini, Raymond F. Jurgens, Jean-Luc Margot and Michael C. Nolan.

The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; adopts a diameter of 1.3 kilometers and derives an albedo 0.26 with an absolute magnitude of 16.5.

The shapes of the two bodies and their dynamics are complex. With a dimension of approximately kilometers for a simple triaxial ellipsoid, the asteroid has an oblate shape, which is dominated by an equatorial ridge at the body&#x27;s potential-energy minimum. This bizarre property of the equatorial region means that it is close to breakup: raising a particle a meter above the surface would put it into orbit. As seen in the image above, the gravitational effects between the moon and the asteroid create a gigantic mountain extending in the equatorial plane around the entire asteroid. It was the first asteroid to be described as &quot;muffin-shaped&quot;, which is now understood to be a very common shape for asteroids in critical rotation, including 101955 Bennu and 162173 Ryugu.

=== Lightcurves ===

During 19–27 June 2000, a rotational lightcurve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by Petr Pravec and Lenka Šarounová at Ondřejov Observatory. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 2.7650 hours with a brightness variation of 0.12 magnitude ().

<doc id="594746" wikidata="Q16960705" url="?curid=594746" title="Life'll Kill Ya">
<text>Life&#x27;ll Kill Ya is the tenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Warren Zevon. The album was released on January 25, 2000, by Artemis Records. It was later hailed in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as his best work since &quot;Excitable Boy&quot;.

==Themes==
Several of the album&#x27;s songs deal with the topic of death; for instance, &quot;My Shit&#x27;s Fucked Up&quot; is a mournful lament on the aging process and the inevitable decay that accompanies it. &quot;Life&#x27;ll Kill Ya&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Us Get Sick&quot; also have prominent death themes. Additionally, Zevon had a phobia of doctors leading him to avoid them for several years; that theme is included in the album as well. In 2002, just two years after the album&#x27;s release, Zevon was diagnosed with mesothelioma and died a year later.

<text>Türkmenbaşy (Turkmen Cyrillic: Түркменбашы, Turkmen Arabic; توركمنباشی, also spelled Turkmenbashy and Turkmenbashi, the latter a back-formation of the Cyrillic Түркменбаши), formerly known as Krasnovodsk (), Kyzyl-Su, and Shagadam (), is a city in Balkan Province in western Turkmenistan, on the Türkmenbaşy Gulf of the Caspian Sea. It sits at an elevation of . The population (est 2004) was 86,800, mostly ethnic Turkmens but also Russian, Armenian and Azeri minorities. As the terminus of the Trans-Caspian Railway and site of a major seaport on the Caspian, it is an important transportation center. The city is also the site of Turkmenistan&#x27;s largest oil refining complex.

This city should not be confused with the similarly named town of Türkmenbaşy (), formerly called Janga (, Cyrillic ), also in Balkan Province, or the city of Saparmyrat Türkmenbaşy adyndaky in Daşoguz Province.

==History==
In 1717, Russian Prince Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky landed and established a secret fortified settlement on this location, where the dry bed of a former mouth of the Amu-Darya River once emptied into the Caspian Sea. His intent was to march an army up this dry riverbed and conquer the Khanate of Khiva. The expedition failed, and the Russians abandoned the settlement for over 150 years.

===Krasnovodsk===

In 1869, the Russians invaded a second time. Having captured the settlement, they named their fort Krasnovodsk (Красноводск), which is a Russian translation of the original name, Kyzyl-Su (Red Water). The fort, Krasnovodsk, served as Imperial Russia&#x27;s base of operations against Khiva and Bukhara, as well as the semi-nomadic Turkmen tribes.

The railway had originally begun from Uzun-Ada on the Caspian Sea, but the terminus was shifted north to the harbour at Krasnovodsk.

It fell to the Red Army in February 1920. 

On November 21, 1939, was formed with its administrative center in Krasnovodsk. The oblast was repeatedly liquidated and restored (January 23, 1947, liquidated; April 4, 1952, restored; December 9, 1955, liquidated; December 27, 1973, restored; August 25, 1988, eliminated).

In 1942, a large part of the Polish Anders&#x27; Army along with many civilians was evacuated from the USSR via the local port to Iran.

In 1985, the airbase here was attacked by Afghan Mujahideen.

===Türkmenbaşy===

On January 10, 1991, Balkan province was created, and on May 18, 1992, was designated a velayat () with its capital in Balkanabat. On 8 October 1993, Krasnovodsk was renamed by President for Life Saparmurat Niyazov after his self-proclaimed title &quot;Türkmenbaşy&quot; (&quot;Head of [all] Turkmens&quot;) by Resolution No. 904-XII of Turkmenistan Parliament.

The second President of Turkmenistan, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, pledged in July 2007 to invest $1 billion in a project slated to turn Türkmenbaşy into a major tourist resort. He ordered development of the Awaza tourist zone with 60 modern hotels to be built along a stretch of the Caspian Sea shoreline. Aside from Awaza, Türkmenbaşy city has three modern hotels: Türkmenbaşy Hotel, Charlak Hotel, and the new Silk Road Hotel at the seaport, in addition to the old Soviet-era Hazar Hotel.

In recent years, the city has undergone large-scale reconstruction: historic district, entrance roads, and vital infrastructure. A new Turkish Park and the cascade of fountains were added. By the end of 2012 Magtymguly Avenue had been completely renovated. The new route merged with the city&#x27;s waterfront, Bahry Hazar, and from the west motorway junction at Balykçy Traffic Circle a dual carriageway leads westward out of the city along a dike across Soymonov Bay to Turkmenbashy Airport and to Awaza. In 2014, the Oilworkers Palace of Culture, which was built in 1951, was renovated.

Boroughs differ from ordinary municipal &quot;districts&quot; in that boroughs are led by a presidentialy appointed mayor (), whereas ordinary municipal districts are subordinate to municipal authorities. Awaza etraby, an area of 9660 hectares, includes the Awaza national tourist zone, Turkmenbashy International Airport and a small residential area.

The abolished Kenar etraby, an area of 7262 hectares, included the main part of the city of Turkmenbashy and the territory of the former town of Kenar.

<text>Derek Robinson (born 12 April 1932) is a British author best known for his military aviation novels full of black humour. He has also written several books on some of the more sordid events in the history of Bristol, his home town, as well as guides to rugby. He was nominated for the Booker Prize in 1971 for his first novel, &quot;Goshawk Squadron&quot;.

After attending Cotham Grammar School, Robinson served in the Royal Air Force as a fighter plotter, during his National Service. He has a history degree from Cambridge University, where he attended Downing College, has and worked in advertising in the UK and the US and as a broadcaster on radio and television. He was a qualified rugby referee for more than thirty years and is a life member of Bristol Society of Rugby Referees. He was married in 1964.

Following his research of historical records for his novel &quot;Piece of Cake&quot; (1983), Robinson became convinced that it was the supremacy of the Royal Navy in the United Kingdom&#x27;s coastal waters that caused Adolf Hitler to postpone invasion plans and not the Battle of Britain, as commonly accepted.

<doc id="594768" wikidata="Q7307419" url="?curid=594768" title="Reform Party of Ontario">
<text>The Reform Party of Ontario (RPO) (PRO; ) was a minor political party in Ontario, Canada. Until the 1999 provincial election, the party ran one candidate each election in order to keep the party&#x27;s name in the possession of supporters of the Reform Party of Canada.

Although a small group of candidates laid claim to the name, they had to run under the &#x27;Independent Reform&#x27; label. After the federal Reform Party became defunct, several independent Reformers revived the RPO name, and the party ran two candidates in the 2007 provincial election and four in the 2011 provincial election.

The Reform Party of Ontario is not to be confused with the pre-Confederation Reform Party, which later became the Ontario Liberal Party, with the leftist progressive United Reform party of the 1940s, nor the defunct populist social conservative New Reform Party of Ontario (known as the Family Coalition Party of Ontario until it was renamed in 2015).

== Official Reform Party of Ontario ==
Supporters of the federal Reform Party registered the &quot;Reform Party of Ontario&quot; name in 1989, and re-registered it in 1994. This registration was made to prevent anyone else from using the &#x27;Reform&#x27; name in Ontario politics; the party nominated one paper candidate in each election and did not campaign actively. Ken Kalopsis, the co-president of the Canadian Alliance, ran for the RPO in the 1999 provincial election in Davenport, as its first candidate to maintain registration and control the rights to the party name. Kalopsis won 174 votes without campaigning.

Federal Reform leader Preston Manning and Premier of Ontario Mike Harris had a good relationship, and it was agreed that the federal Reform Party would not campaign actively provincially in order to prevent vote splitting. The provincial Tories returned the favour by giving some unofficial support to Reform in federal politics.

Robert Beard was the party&#x27;s leader for RPO in 2002. With the end of the federal Reform Party, the provincial Reform Party was deregistered in September 2003.

== Unofficial movement ==
In 1993, several strong supporters of the Reform Party of Canada started a movement that advocated for an active Reform party in Ontario. This movement was not affiliated with the federal Reform Party, and thus was prevented from using the Reform Party of Ontario name by Elections Ontario.

After the 1995 general election, the Ontario-based group founded &quot;Grassroots United Against Reform&#x27;s Demise&quot; (GUARD) to lobby for the Reform Party&#x27;s participation in provincial politics. &quot;Focus Federally For Reform&quot;, which opposed an active party, was formed in response opposing participation. A vast majority of Ontario Reform supporters backed Focus Federally, and Grassroots United lost their bid to have the party enter Ontario politics.

The group supporting a Reform movement in Ontario formed the &quot;Reform Association of Ontario&quot; (Reform Ontario), cofounded by Kimble F. Ainslie of London and Reg Gosse of Kitchener in 1994. The association was denied party status by the Ontario Election Commission in 1995, and ran unsuccessfully in the 1995 election. Candidates were nominated in Huron—Bruce, Kitchener—Waterloo, London, Ontario district, and other ridings in the Greater Toronto Area for Reform Association of Ontario. The group&#x27;s aim was to protest the undemocratic decision. The candidates gained very few votes and no candidate was elected.

The Reform Association of Ontario ran a candidate in the 1999 election in Prince Edward—Hastings and in the 2003 election in Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound. Both were credited as &quot;Independent Reform&quot; candidates, but gained very few votes and no candidate was elected. Running again as an Independent Reformer, the 2003 Reform Ontario candidate for Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound, Bill Cook, ran in the 2005 Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey by-election, against the Ontario Progressive Conservative leader, John Tory, who won.

The Reform Association for Ontario was renamed the &quot;Reform Ontario&quot; movement and continued to promote its &quot;Triple &#x27;R&#x27; Government&quot; agenda, including recall for removing unpopular politicians and fixed election dates, referendums on the issues such as electoral financing reform and preferential ballot voting, and &quot;real responsible representation&quot; through more free votes for MPPs instead of direction from party whips in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

== Official party ==

The &quot;Representative Party of Ontario&quot; was formed by and led by Bill Cook, a former Reform Ontario activist from Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound. The party never got beyond being a reserved provincial political party name in the Province of Ontario, Canada. The party&#x27;s request to register the name and abbreviation was submitted in early September 2004, verified in late October-early November, and reserved on Friday, December 17, 2004. The name was judged to be not acceptable by Elections Ontario on March 10, 2005. The party hoped to become the grassroot Reform-oriented alternative to the main Liberal, Progressive Conservative and New Democratic parties in the province. The party&#x27;s traditional populist beliefs in representative and direct democracy followed those of the politics of pre-Confederation Reform Party leader William Lyon Mackenzie, former United Farmers of Ontario premier Ernest Charles Drury and former Ontario Cooperative Commonwealth Federation member Agnes Campbell Macphail.

When the name was rejected in 2005, the party was then intended to be revived as &quot;Ontario Alternative&quot;, according to Elections Ontario, a name reserved by Joshua E. Eriksen, a student of political science at Redeemer College and McMaster University in Hamilton. As federal Reform Party supporters no longer had possession of the name &quot;Reform Party of Ontario&quot;, the name was reclaimed by the provincial Reformers for the 2007 election. Bradley J. Harness, who cofounded the federal Ontario Party of Canada with George Burns in 2002, was selected as its party leader, Cook as its deputy leader and agriculture critic, and Eriksen as its provincial party president.

The RPO ran two candidates: Cook in Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound and Harness in Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. Eriksen was its campaign manager, but neither candidate gained many votes nor were elected.

Past party president Donn Korbin and chief financial officer Andrew Long pushed to keep the Reform Party of Ontario a true blueprint of the Common Sense Revolution era of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives. During that era, Mike Harris and the Ontario PCs had won two majority governments. Special interest groups like the Ontario Landowners Association (OLA) and its &quot;Rural Revolution&quot; members had maintained a hard right line with the RPO against the Ontario Tories, now led by Red Tory moderate John Tory.

Joining forces, the populist-based RPO and libertarian-based OLA agreed on many common principles to build a unified Northern Rural Ontario manifesto for the farmer and labourer. Three basic principles were identified: &quot;property rights, deamalgamation, and less government yet better governance&quot;. RPO party leader Harness and president Eriksen met with OLA president and current Carleton—Mississippi Mills PC MPP Jack MacLaren and eight other senior leaders from the group to work out the details. Lanark—Frontenac—Lennox &amp; Addington PC MPP Randy Hillier considered crossing over to Reform in the Ontario Legislature as its first member because of his dissatisfaction with Tory&#x27;s leadership.

According to the press, Harness had worked out a side deal under which he would become the deputy under Hillier, if Hillier joined Reform Ontario. Hillier declined and then quickly denied any involvement with the side deal, and the strength of both organizations was greatly diminished.

=== 2009 and 2010 by-election campaigns ===
On February 4, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty announced that a by-election would be held on March 5, 2009 in Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock to fill the seat vacated by its PC MPP Laurie Scott, who stepped aside so that Progressive Conservative leader John Tory could seek a seat in the legislature.

Reform Party leader Brad Harness announced that Reform planned to run a candidate, and slammed Tory as an &quot;urbanite&quot; who would only appeal to &quot;big C&quot; Conservatives. However, Harness backed down, and the party did not field a candidate.

Harness announced that he would run a Reform candidate in the March 4, 2010 by-election in Ottawa West—Nepean, but then Harness backed down again and did not do so.

=== 2011–2015 ===
The party ran four candidates in the 2011 election: Robert Szajkowski in Hamilton Centre, Gerald Augustine in Niagara West–Glanbrook, David Natale in Vaughan, and the party leader Harness in Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. Former Hamilton Mountain PC MPP Trevor Pettit acted as a campaign manager and deputy leader of the party. None of the party&#x27;s candidate were elected.

The party did not run candidates in the 2014 election, and was deregistered by Elections Ontario.

=== Subsequent activity ===

Some executives of the Reform Party of Ontario and some grassroots members, were approached to join the new expansion towards a broader base in time for the 2018 provincial election. Those actively involved include RPO president Joshua E. Eriksen, RPO deputy leader Bill Cook, as well as other RPO executives from the past.

At an annual general meeting in Burlington at the Crossroads Forum, the Family Coalition Party of Ontario leadership via its newly elected party leader James Gault, deputy leader and director of communications Eric Ames, president Lynne Scime led a move to combine the original traditional moral values of the FCP with the democratic reform principles of the RPO into a new rebranded party called the New Reform Party of Ontario.

However, the new party was deregistered by Elections Ontario as of January 2016, after only running once in the 2015 Simcoe North byelection, where Gault and New Reform placed fifth out of eight candidates with 197 votes (0.50%).

==Party ideology ==
The Reform Party of Ontario, like the Reform Association of Ontario and the Reform Ontario movement before it, was an Ontario provincial version of the federal Reform Party of Canada. Though populism makes up the main thrust of its political ideology, Reform Ontario focused on a mixture of fiscal, social, and libertarian conservatism.

RPO supported a reduction in the size of government. RPO would balance the budget and pay down the deficit and debt first before cutting taxes. Reform Ontario respect for life, freedom and liberty of the individual, and private ownership of property with limited yet effective government are key principles. They believed the family unit is the basic building block of society, in a stronger institution of marriage reduces cultural ills and increases labour productivity. RPO believed in more public involvement by the people using private investment for more effective and efficient service in areas of health care, education, and energy, which allow government limited control over personal decisions by its taxpayers.

Reform Ontario supported what it called &quot;Triple &#x27;R&#x27; government&quot;: (1) referendums on the issues such as electoral financing reform and preferential ballot voting, (2) a recall for removing unpopular politicians and fixed election dates, and (3) &quot;real responsible representation&quot; through more free publicly recorded and unwhipped votes for MPPs instead of direction by party whips in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The party also supported allowing municipalities that have been amalgamated the right to deamalgamate, and of strengthening of individual property rights.

<text>A close vowel, also known as a high vowel (in U.S. terminology), is any in a class of vowel sounds used in many spoken languages. The defining characteristic of a close vowel is that the tongue is positioned approximately as close as possible to the roof of the mouth as it can be without creating a constriction. A constriction would produce a sound that would be classified as a consonant.

The term &quot;close&quot; is recommended by the International Phonetic Association. Close vowels are often referred to as &quot;high&quot; vowels, as in the Americanist phonetic tradition, because the tongue is positioned high in the mouth during articulation.

In the context of the phonology of any particular language, a &quot;high vowel&quot; can be any vowel that is more close than a mid vowel. That is, close-mid vowels, near-close vowels, and close vowels can all be considered high vowels.

==Partial list==
The six close vowels that have dedicated symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet are:

* close front unrounded vowel 
* close front compressed vowel 
* close central unrounded vowel 
* close central protruded vowel 
* close back unrounded vowel 
* close back protruded vowel 

(IPA letters for rounded vowels are ambiguous as to whether the rounding is protrusion or compression. However, transcription of the world&#x27;s languages tends to pattern as above.)

There also are close vowels that do not have dedicated symbols in the IPA:
* close front protruded vowel 
* close central compressed vowel 
* close back compressed vowel 

Other close vowels can be indicated with diacritics of relative articulation applied to letters for neighboring vowels, such as or for a close near-front unrounded vowel.

<doc id="594774" wikidata="Q1813464" url="?curid=594774" title="Near-close vowel">
<text>A near-close vowel or a near-high vowel is any in a class of vowel sound used in some spoken languages. The defining characteristic of a near-close vowel is that the tongue is positioned similarly to a close vowel, but slightly less constricted.

Other names for a near-close vowel are lowered close vowel and raised close-mid vowel, though the former phrase may also be used to describe a vowel that is as low as close-mid (sometimes even lower); likewise, the latter phrase may also be used to describe a vowel that is as high as close.

Near-close vowels are also sometimes described as lax variants of the fully close vowels, though, depending on the language, they may not necessarily be &quot;variants&quot; of close vowels at all.

It is rare for languages to contrast a near-close vowel with a close vowel and a close-mid vowel based on height alone. An example of such language is Danish, which contrasts short and long versions of the close front unrounded , near-close front unrounded and close-mid front unrounded vowels, though in order to avoid using any relative articulation diacritics, Danish and are typically transcribed with phonetically inaccurate symbols and , respectively. This contrast is not present in Conservative Danish, which realizes the latter two vowels as, respectively, close-mid and mid .

It is even rarer for languages to contrast more than one close/near-close/close-mid triplet. For instance, Sotho has two such triplets: fully front and fully back . In the case of this language, the near-close vowels tend to be transcribed with the phonetically inaccurate symbols , i.e. as if they were close central.

It may be somewhat more common for languages to contain allophonic vowel triplets that are not contrastive; for instance, Russian has one such triplet:
* close central rounded , an allophone of between soft consonants in stressed syllables;
* near-close central rounded , an allophone of between soft consonants in unstressed syllables;
* close-mid central rounded , an allophone of after soft consonants.

==Partial list==
The near-close vowels that have dedicated symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet are:

* near-close near-front unrounded vowel 
* near-close near-front compressed vowel 
* near-close near-back rounded vowel 

The &quot;Handbook of the International Phonetic Association&quot; defines these vowels as mid-centralized (lowered and centralized) equivalents of, respectively, , and , therefore, an alternative transcription of these vowels is or the more complex ; however, they are not centralized in all languages - some languages have a fully front variant of and/or a fully back variant of ; the exact backness of these variants can be transcribed in the IPA with , or .

There also are near-close vowels that don&#x27;t have dedicated symbols in the IPA:

* near-close near-front protruded vowel 
* near-close central unrounded vowel 
* near-close central compressed vowel 
* near-close central protruded vowel 
* near-close near-back unrounded vowel or 
* near-close near-back compressed vowel 

(IPA letters for rounded vowels are ambiguous as to whether the rounding is protrusion or compression. However, transcription of the world&#x27;s languages tends to pattern as above.)

Other near-close vowels can be indicated with diacritics of relative articulation applied to letters for neighboring vowels, such as , or for a near-close front unrounded vowel, or , or for a near-close back rounded vowel.

<text>A serum-separating tube or serum separator tube (SST) is a test tube used in clinical chemistry tests requiring blood serum.

SSTs are sometimes called &quot;gold-topped tubes&quot;, &quot;tiger-tops&quot;, or &quot;marble-top tubes&quot;, referring to the colored stoppers which are either gold, red with a gold ring on top, or marbled red and grey. Stoppers on SPS (sodium polyanethol sulfonate) tubes have a paler yellow color, sometimes causing confusion; these are known as &quot;yellow tops&quot;, not &quot;gold&quot;. Trademarked versions of the SST include Covidien &quot;Corvac&quot; tubes.

== Features ==

The tubes have micronized silica particles which help clot the blood before centrifugation, and a gel at the bottom which separates whole blood cells from serum.  Silica nanoparticles induce coagulation through contact activation of coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor). The silica particles are desiccants, which adsorb and hold water vapor.  This is used in the tubes so the blood adheres to the surface of the tiny silica particles and begins to clot. After the blood sample is centrifuged, the clear serum should be removed for testing.

== Use ==

These tubes should be used with care when measuring drug or hormone levels because the drug or hormone may diffuse from the serum into the gel, causing a reduction in measured level.
The gel in SST II tubes (which appears slightly less opaque) is supposed to have less effect on drug levels in serum. 

Blood samples should be allowed time to form a clot at room temperature for 30–60 min.

CDC recommends a range of time to allow clot formation that was reasonably consistent, from a minimum of 30 min to 60 min maximum.

<doc id="594778" wikidata="Q1650645" url="?curid=594778" title="Mid vowel">
<text>A mid vowel (or a true-mid vowel) is any in a class of vowel sounds used in some spoken languages. The defining characteristic of a mid vowel is that the tongue is positioned approximately midway between an open vowel and a close vowel.

Other names for a mid vowel are lowered close-mid vowel and raised open-mid vowel, though the former phrase may also be used to describe a vowel that is as low as open-mid; likewise, the latter phrase may also be used to describe a vowel that is as high as close-mid.

==Vowels==
The only mid vowel with a dedicated symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet is the mid central vowel with ambiguous rounding .

The IPA divides the vowel space into thirds, with the close-mid vowels such as or and the open-mid vowels such as or equidistant in formant space between open or and close or . Thus a true mid front unrounded vowel can be transcribed as either a lowered (with a lowering diacritic) or as a raised (with a raising diacritic). Typical truly mid vowels are thus:

* mid front unrounded vowel or 
* mid front rounded vowel or 
* mid central unrounded vowel or (most commonly written )
* mid central protruded vowel or (most commonly written as if it were close-mid)
* mid central compressed vowel 
* mid back unrounded vowel or 
* mid back rounded vowel or 

==Languages==
Few languages contrast all three heights of mid vowel, because it is rare for a language to distinguish more than four heights of true front or back vowels.

The Kensiu language spoken in Malaysia and Thailand is highly unusual in that it phonemically contrasts true-mid vowels with close-mid and open-mid vowels without differences in other parameters such as backness or roundedness.

<text>An open vowel is a vowel sound in which the tongue is positioned approximately as far as possible from the roof of the mouth. Open vowels are sometimes also called low vowels (in U.S. terminology ) in reference to the low position of the tongue.

In the context of the phonology of any particular language, a &quot;low vowel&quot; can be any vowel that is more open than a mid vowel. That is, open-mid vowels, near-open vowels, and open vowels can all be considered low vowels.

==Partial list==
The open vowels with dedicated symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet are:

* open front unrounded vowel 
* open front rounded vowel 
* open back unrounded vowel 
* open back rounded vowel 

There also are central vowels that do not have dedicated symbols in the IPA:
* open central unrounded vowel or (commonly written as if it were front)
* open central rounded vowel 

There is no unambiguous way of transcribing the open central vowels (but see obsolete/nonstandard IPA ᴀ). The diaeresis indicates &quot;centralization&quot;, so could mean near-front and could mean near-back. However, in practice the diaeresis is assumed to mean central, while and are used for the front and back articulations, respectively.

The extremely rare contrast between open front, central and back unrounded vowels has been reported to occur in the Hamont-Achel dialect of Limburgish, which features long versions of these sounds, as well as short versions of the open front and back vowels. The short versions do not contrast directly with the open central vowel, which can only be long.

<text>The University of the State of New York (USNY, ) is the state governmental umbrella organization that oversees all educational institutions, including schools, libraries, and museums in New York State. It is governed by the Board of Regents.

Despite the name, the University of the State of New York is not an educational institution but rather a governmental licensing and accreditation body that sets standards for schools operating in New York State, from pre-kindergarten through professional and graduate school, as well as for the practice of a wide variety of professions.

==History==

The Board of Regents of the USNY was established by statute on May 1, 1784, to re-establish and oversee King&#x27;s College as Columbia University and any other colleges and academies incorporated in the state thereafter. On April 13, 1787, the legislature enacted a law that allowed individual educational institutions to have their own trustees (making Columbia a private institution) and gave the Regents broader responsibilities for overseeing education in New York. The new law empowered the Regents to &quot;visit and inspect all the colleges, academies, and schools&quot; in the state, award higher academic degrees, hold and distribute funds, and exercise other powers of a corporation.

Early in the 19th century, the Regents established standards for incorporating private academies and colleges, including specifying the texts or subjects that academies must teach to qualify for state aid. Aid was restricted to those students who had passed local entrance examinations. To combat the problem of academies lowering their standards in order to attract students and get state aid, during the later nineteenth century the Regents developed and instituted educational standards for high schools statewide, through use of the Regents examinations and syllabi.

The legislature gave the Regents responsibility for the New York State Library and New York State Museum in 1844 and 1845, respectively, and in 1889 and 1892 expanded the USNY&#x27;s responsibilities significantly to include the incorporation and supervision of all libraries, museums, correspondence schools, and other educational institutions. An 1872 statute authorized the Regents to appoint examining and licensing boards in the state&#x27;s medical schools, and in 1890 the Regents were given the exclusive power to license physicians. Also starting in 1890, the Secretary to the Board of Regents – then Melvil Dewey, also head of the State Library – supervised full-time inspectors of secondary schools, libraries, colleges, and other institutions reporting to the Regents. Starting in 1910, private trade schools were required to be licensed and inspected, and in 1923 licensing requirements were extended to correspondence schools operating in the state.

In 1948, New York State established a system of support organizations known as Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) across the state. The head of each BOCES, known as the District Superintendent, acts as the New York State Commissioner of Education&#x27;s, and by extension, the Chancellor of the Board of Regents&#x27;, field representative.

===Regents College===

A key former initiative of the Board of Regents, created to better bring higher education to New York State&#x27;s nontraditional adult learners, was the Board of Regents&#x27; &quot;Regents External Degree Program&quot;, or REX, which became Regents College in 1984 and then the separate and independent Excelsior College in 1998–2001. This program was an outgrowth of the practice of giving World War II veterans school and college credit in recognition of their military education and experience. In 1963 the Regents introduced College Proficiency Examinations, now called Excelsior College Examinations (ECEs), initially to help teachers and nurses complete educational requirements. First named the &quot;Regents External Degree Program,&quot; it was established in 1971 with financial support from the Ford and Carnegie Foundations. Degrees could be granted based on a combination of college proficiency exams and classroom and correspondence courses, or on a variety of exams alone. The first degrees were conferred in 1972. This program became independent of the Education Department in 1991 but continued to be governed by the Board of Regents until 1998, at which time it fully separated from the Board of Regents to become a private, independent college. Up until that time it did not offer instruction, but in addition to its examinations, it accepted transfer credit from any regionally-accredited college. The school, prohibited by the terms of its &quot;independence&quot; agreement from continuing to use the name Regents College, adopted the name Excelsior College in 2001. Since the school offers both undergraduate and graduate programs, the institution decided to change the name again to Excelsior University in 2022. Excelsior University is now a constituent member of USNY in the same way that other institutions of higher education (including private colleges) in New York State are. Like them, it has its own charter and Board of Trustees.

==Current structure and functions==
The Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York oversees USNY. The Board includes 17 members elected by the New York State Legislature for five-year terms. Thirteen of the Regents represent the state&#x27;s 13 judicial districts (one appointed from each district), and four are at-large. The Regents serve without salary.

USNY&#x27;s affiliation and oversight are very broad. As a legal technicality, USNY includes all of the state&#x27;s more than 7,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools; approximately 250 public and private colleges and universities; another approximately 250 proprietary (for-profit) schools; nearly 7,000 libraries; about 750 museums; all of the state&#x27;s local historical societies; and 25 public broadcasting facilities. Also included in USNY are the State Archives; a special school for the blind and another special school for the deaf; as well as vocational rehabilitation and special education services. Additionally, USNY has the affiliation of, and oversight for, more than half a million professionals practicing in 58 licensed professions, ranging from accountancy to architecture to engineering to massage therapy to hair styling, as well as 200,000 public certified school teachers, counselors, and administrators. Certain education-related institutions (such as most museums) could exist in New York State without being part of USNY; however, as an example, most museums in New York State choose to be part of USNY (i.e., be chartered by the Board of Regents) in order to obtain tax-exempt nonprofit status and other benefits.

===Relationship to the state education department===
The state Education Law makes the Regents the head of the New York State Education Department. The Regents select a Commissioner of Education who both runs the Education Department and is president – that is, chief executive officer – of the University. The Board of Regents also elects a chancellor from among its members, who presides over the Regents&#x27; meetings and appoints its committees.

The New York State Education Department (NYSED) was created at the behest of former New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. USNY has, as a subordinate unit, NYSED, including NYSED&#x27;s various administrative personnel – furthermore, the various schools, colleges, libraries, museums, teachers, etc., of USNY form constituent units of USNY, whereas NYSED forms a constituent and subordinate component of USNY.

USNY, through its Board of Regents, generally uses NYSED as a vehicle to carry out policy created by the Regents. In other words, USNY&#x27;s Board of Regents generally creates policy, whereas NYSED generally administers policy and the BOCES&#x27; District Superintendents help facilitate the roll-out of that policy in the field. The New York State Legislature can also create some education policy; such statutory education policy would become official education policy that the Commissioner of Education would also be responsible for administering.

===Regents examinations and diplomas===
Regents Examinations, tests administered to high school students to demonstrate mastery of various subjects, were established by the Regents and first administered in 1865. The Regents of USNY have set standards by which students may earn various levels of Regents diplomas for high school performance.

===Honorary degrees===
USNY can also issue honorary degrees; the honorary degrees that can be issued come from an established list contained in Rules of the Board of Regents (&quot;Regents Rules&quot;). USNY also has the power to directly issue (as opposed to through some other institution) diplomas, certificates, and degrees. Today, for a variety of reasons, USNY directly issues diplomas to individuals meeting graduation requirements at several postsecondary institutions in New York State.

==Alumni==
==State University of New York==
Not to be confused with USNY is the State University of New York (SUNY), which is one of New York State&#x27;s systems of public higher education, the other being the City University of New York (CUNY). Like all colleges and universities in the state, the 64 SUNY and 25 CUNY campus units are all part of USNY. However, the power of SUNY and CUNY units to grant degrees exists by mandate of the State Legislature; a private college or university in New York State would be allowed to grant degrees by virtue of a charter granted by the USNY Board of Regents. No institution in New York State can call itself, per New York State law, a &quot;college&quot; or &quot;university,&quot; or award academic degrees, without being chartered by NYSED and being a USNY member. Institutions in the state can, however, offer non-degree certificate programs without adhering to these requirements.

<text>The mid central vowel is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken languages. A reduced mid central vowel is known as a schwa. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents either sound is , a rotated lowercase letter e.

While the &quot;Handbook of the International Phonetic Association&quot; does not define the roundedness of , a schwa is more often unrounded than rounded. The phonetician Jane Setter describes the pronunciation of the unrounded variant as follows: &quot;a sound which can be produced by basically relaxing the articulators in the oral cavity and vocalising.&quot; To produce the rounded variant, all that needs to be done in addition to that is to round the lips.

Afrikaans contrasts unrounded and rounded mid central vowels; the latter is usually transcribed with . The contrast is not very stable, and many speakers use an unrounded vowel in both cases.

Danish and Luxembourgish have a mid central vowel that is variably rounded. In other languages, the change in rounding is accompanied with the change in height or backness. For instance, in Dutch, the unrounded allophone of is mid central unrounded , but its word-final rounded allophone is close-mid front rounded , close to the main allophone of .

&quot;Mid central vowel&quot; and &quot;schwa&quot; do not always mean the same thing, and the symbol is often used for any obscure vowel, regardless of its precise quality. For instance, the unstressed English vowel transcribed and called &quot;schwa&quot; is a central unrounded vowel that can be close-mid , mid or open-mid , depending on the environment.
The French vowel transcribed that way is closer to .

If a mid-central vowel of a language is not a reduced vowel, or if it may be stressed, it may be more unambiguous to transcribe it with one of the other mid-central vowel letters: for an unrounded vowel or for a rounded vowel.

==Mid central unrounded vowel==

The mid central unrounded vowel is frequently written with the symbol . If greater precision is desired, the symbol for the close-mid central unrounded vowel may be used with a lowering diacritic, , or for the open-mid central unrounded vowel with a raising diacritic, .

===Occurrence===
==Mid central rounded vowel==

Languages may have a mid central rounded vowel (a rounded ), distinct from both the close-mid and open-mid vowels. However, since no language is known to distinguish all three, there is no separate IPA symbol for the mid vowel, and the symbol for the close-mid central rounded vowel is generally used instead. If precision is desired, the lowering diacritic can be used, , or the more rounded diacritic with the schwa symbol, , or the raising diacritic with the open-mid central rounded vowel symbol, , although it is rare to use such precision.

<doc id="594787" wikidata="Q688522" url="?curid=594787" title="Succession to the Belgian throne">
<text>There are eighteen people in the line of succession to the Belgian throne.

The monarch is considered to have acceded to the throne upon her/his taking of the oath as required by article 91 of the constitution.

== Eligibility ==
Since 1991, Belgium practises absolute primogeniture among the descendants of King Albert II (then Prince of Liège). Descendants of earlier monarchs and princes are only eligible to succeed if male and descended from King Leopold I in male-line (i.e. according to agnatic primogeniture), meaning that descendants of all Belgian princesses not descended from Albert II are barred from the throne. There are no living princes of Belgium who are not descended from Albert II, so agnatic primogeniture &quot;de facto&quot; no longer applies, and the right to succeed is effectively limited to Albert II&#x27;s descendants.

A person is deprived of his or her rights to the crown if he or she marries without the consent of the monarch (or the consent of those exercising the monarch&#x27;s powers). The lost right may be re-established by the monarch (or by those exercising the monarch&#x27;s powers) in the event of parliamentary agreement. Should there be no eligible descendant of King Leopold I, the reigning monarch may name his or her heir presumptive with the approval of the Parliament, but if she or he doesn&#x27;t name the heir presumptive, the throne would eventually become vacant.

In the case of a vacancy, Parliament would appoint a Regent (see below), then elections would happen within two months, and the new sitting of Parliament would jointly appoint the next monarch.

When King Albert II&#x27;s daughter Astrid married Archduke Lorenz of Austria-Este in 1984, agnatic primogeniture being in effect, she had no succession rights and therefore did not seek the consent to her marriage. Following the introduction of absolute primogeniture among her father&#x27;s descendants in 1991, it was deemed that she had obtained the necessary consent and thus assumed her place in the line along with her children.

When Prince Amedeo married in 2014, it was reported that he did not ask his uncle King Philippe&#x27;s permission, and had therefore lost his right to the Belgian throne. However, on November 12, 2015, a Royal Decree was published which showed that consent had been given after the marriage retroactively.

In October 2020 the Belgian Court of Appeals granted the title of Princess to Delphine Boël, the illegitimate daughter of King Albert II, but because of her bastardy, she did not enter the line of succession. Since she was born in 1968 after her three legitimate half-siblings she would not displace any of her kin regardless and would only come after her half-nephew Prince Aymeric.

No foreign head of state may become Belgian monarch, unless both Houses of Parliament separately agree to it, two-thirds of the Members being present in each House, and a two-thirds majority being required in each House.

== Accession ==
In Belgium, unlike in most other European monarchies where the succession is automatic, there is an interregnum between each monarch&#x27;s demise and his successor&#x27;s accession. This is because a monarch can only accede to the throne after taking an oath during a joint session of both Houses of Parliament.

The oath is prescribed as follows: &quot;I swear to observe the Constitution and the laws of the Belgian people, to maintain national independence and territorial integrity.&quot;

Upon the monarch&#x27;s death, both Houses of Parliament convene within ten days with no convocation and, until a successor takes the oath of office, the Ministers jointly fulfil the constitutional duties of the monarch under their own responsibility.

If the monarch is prevented from reigning or is a minor, the Houses of Parliament jointly designate a Regent, who enters into office by taking the above oath. There can only be one Regent.

<doc id="594792" wikidata="Q1735503" url="?curid=594792" title="Castration anxiety">
<text>Castration anxiety is an overwhelming fear of damage to, or loss of, the penis—a derivative of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s theory of the castration complex, one of his earliest psychoanalytic theories. The term refers to the fear of emasculation in both a literal and metaphorical sense.

Freud regarded castration anxiety as a universal human experience. It is thought to begin between the ages of 3 and 5, during the phallic stage of psychosexual development. In Freud&#x27;s theory, it is the child&#x27;s perception of anatomical difference (the possession of a penis) that induces castration anxiety as a result of an assumed paternal threat made in response to their sexual proclivities. Although typically associated with males, castration anxiety is thought to be experienced, in differing ways, by both sexes.

== Literal ==
In the literal sense, castration anxiety refers to a child&#x27;s fear of having their genitalia disfigured or removed as punishment for Oedipal desire.

In Freudian psychoanalysis, castration anxiety (&quot;Kastrationsangst&quot;) refers to an unconscious fear of penile loss that originates during the phallic stage of psychosexual development and continues into adulthood. According to Freud, when the infantile male becomes aware of differences between male and female genitalia he assumes that the female&#x27;s penis has been removed and becomes anxious that his penis will be cut off by his rival, the father figure, as punishment for desiring the mother figure.

In 19th-century Europe, it was not unheard of for parents to threaten their misbehaving sons with castration or otherwise threaten their genitals. This theme is explored in the story &quot;Tupik&quot; by French writer Michel Tournier in his collection of stories entitled &quot;Le Coq de Bruyère&quot; (1978) and is a phenomenon Freud documents several times. Kellogg recounts one case of castration used as a cure and punishment for masturbation, although he did not advocate it.

== Metaphorical ==
Castration anxiety can also refer to being castrated symbolically. In the metaphorical sense, castration anxiety refers to the idea of feeling or being insignificant; there is a need to keep one&#x27;s self from being dominated; whether it be socially or in a relationship.
Symbolic castration anxiety refers to the fear of being degraded, dominated or made insignificant, usually an irrational fear where the person will go to extreme lengths to save their pride and/or perceive trivial things as being degrading making their anxiety restrictive and sometimes damaging.
This can also tie in with literal castration anxiety in fearing the loss of virility or sexual dominance.

== Relation to power and control ==

According to Freudian psychoanalysis, castration anxiety can be completely overwhelming to the individual, often breaching other aspects of his or her life. A link has been found between castration anxiety and fear of death. Although differing degrees of anxiety are common, young men who felt the most threatened in their youth tended to show chronic anxiety. Because the consequences are extreme, the fear can evolve from potential disfigurement to life-threatening situations. Essentially, castration anxiety can lead to a fear of death, and a feeling of loss of control over one&#x27;s life.

To feel so powerless can be detrimental to an individual&#x27;s mental health. One of the most concerning problems with all of this is the idea that the individual does not recognize that their sexual desires are the cause of the emotional distress. Because of unconscious thoughts, as theorized in the ideas of psychoanalysis, the anxiety is brought to the surface where it is experienced symbolically. This will lead to the fear associated with bodily injury in castration anxiety, which can then lead to the fear of dying or being killed.

== Relation to circumcision ==
Freud had a strongly critical view of circumcision, believing it to be a &#x27;substitute for castration&#x27;, and an &#x27;expression of submission to the father&#x27;s will&#x27;. This view was shared by others in the psychoanalytic community, such as Wilhelm Reich, Hermann Nunberg, and Jacques Lacan, who stated that there is &quot;nothing less castrating than circumcision!&quot;

Themes central to castration anxiety that feature prominently in circumcision include pain, fear, loss of control (with the child&#x27;s forced restraint, and in the psychological effects of the event, which may include sensation seeking, and lower emotional stability) and the perception that the event is a form of punishment.

The ritual&#x27;s origination as a result of Oedipal conflict was tested by examining 111 societies, finding that circumcision is likely to be found in societies in which the son sleeps in the mother&#x27;s bed during the nursing period in bodily contact with her, and/or the father sleeps in a different hut.

A study of the procedure without anaesthesia on children in Turkey found &#x27;each child looked at his penis immediately after the circumcision &#x27;as if to make sure that all was not cut off&#x27;. Another study of 60 males subject to communal circumcision ceremonies in Turkey found that 21.5% of them &quot;remembered that they were specifically afraid that their penis might or would be cut off entirely,&quot; while &#x27;specific fears of castration&#x27; occurred in 28% of the village-reared men. Fear of the authoritarian father increased considerably in 12 children.

Psychoanalytic interpretation of Biblical stories shows themes of castration anxiety present in Judaic mythology concerning circumcision.

The figure of Lilith, described as &quot;a hot fiery female who first cohabited with man&quot; presents as an archetypal representation of the first mother of man, and primordial sexual temptation. Male children were said to be at risk of Lilith&#x27;s wrath for eight days after birth. Deceiving Lilith into believing newborn babies were a girl – letting the boy&#x27;s hair grow and even dressing him in girl clothes – were said to be the most effective means to avoid her harm, until they were ritually circumcised on the eighth day of life as part of a covenant with God.

The figure of Judith, depicted both as &quot;a type of the praying Virgin... who tramples Satan and harrows Hell,&quot; and also as &quot;seducer-assassin&quot; archetypically reflects the dichotomous themes presented by castration anxiety and circumcision: sexual purity, chastity, violence, and eroticism. Judith defeats Assyrian General, Holofernes by cutting his head off – decapitation being an act that Freud equated with castration in his essay, &quot;Medusa&#x27;s Head&quot;.

== Counterpart in females ==
It is implied in Freudian psychology that both girls and boys pass through the same developmental stages: oral, anal, and phallic stages. Freud, however, believed that the results may be different because the anatomy of the different sexes is different.

The counterpart of castration anxiety for females is penis envy. Penis envy, and the concept of such, was first introduced by Freud in an article published in 1908 titled &quot;On the Sexual Theories of Children&quot;. The idea was presumed that females/girls envied those (mostly their fathers) with a penis because theirs was taken from them—essentially they were already &quot;castrated&quot;. Freud entertained that the envy they experienced was their unconscious wish to be like a boy and to have a penis.

Penis envy, in Freudian psychology, refers to the reaction of the female/young girl during development when she realizes that she does not possess a penis. According to Freud, this was a major development in the identity (gender and sexual) of the girl. The contemporary culture assumes that penis envy is the woman wishing they were in fact a man. This is unrelated to the notion of &quot;small penis syndrome&quot; which is the assumption by the man that his penis is too small. According to Freud&#x27;s beliefs, girls developed a weaker superego, which he considered a consequence of penis envy.

Among his many suggestions, Freud believed that during the phallic stage, young girls distance themselves from their mothers and instead envy their fathers and show this envy by showing love and affection towards their fathers. According to Cohler and Galatzer, Freud believed that all of the concepts related to penis envy were among his greatest accomplishments. However, these are also his most criticized theories as well—most famously by Karen Horney.

== Empirical testing ==

Sarnoff et al. surmised that men differ in their degree of castration anxiety through the castration threat they experienced in childhood. Therefore, these men may be expected to respond in different ways to different degrees of castration anxiety that they experience from the same sexually arousing stimulus. The experimenters aimed to demonstrate that in the absence of a particular stimulus, men who were severely threatened with castration, as children, might experience long-lasting anxiety. The researchers claimed that this anxiety is from the repressed desires for sexual contact with women. It was thought that these desires are trying to reach the men&#x27;s consciousness. The experimenters deduced that unconscious anxiety of being castrated might come from the fear the consciousness has of bodily injury. The researchers concluded that individuals who are in excellent health and who have never experienced any serious accident or illness may be obsessed by gruesome and relentless fears of dying or of being killed.

In another article related to castration anxiety, Hall et al. investigated whether sex differences would be found in the manifestations of castration anxiety in their subject&#x27;s dreams. The researchers hypothesized that male dreamers would report more dreams that would express their fear of castration anxiety instead of dreams involving castration wish and penis envy. They further hypothesized that women will have a reversed effect, that is, female dreamers will report more dreams containing fear of castration wish and penis envy than dreams including castration anxiety. The results demonstrated that many more women than men dreamt about babies and weddings and that men had more dreams about castration anxiety than women.
