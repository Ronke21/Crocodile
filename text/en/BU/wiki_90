<text>Ivor Churchill Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne, KP, PC (16 January 1873 – 14 June 1939), known as Lord Ashby St Ledgers from 1910 to 1914 and as Lord Wimborne from 1914 to 1918, was a British politician and one of the last Lords Lieutenant of Ireland, serving in that position at the time of the Easter Rising.

==Background and education==
He was the eldest son of Ivor Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, and Lady Cornelia Henrietta Maria Spencer-Churchill, daughter of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough. He was the elder brother of Frederick Guest, Oscar Guest and Henry Guest, and a first cousin of Winston Churchill. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge.

He was commissioned a lieutenant in the Dorset Yeomanry on 9 May 1896. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, he volunteered for service and was appointed a lieutenant in the Imperial Yeomanry on 24 February 1900, leaving England for South Africa on the in early March. He was awarded the Queen&#x27;s South Africa Medal with two clasps. After returning to the United Kingdom, he was promoted to captain on 18 January 1902.

==Political career, 1900–1915==

He was elected unopposed to Parliament for Plymouth in a by-election in February 1900 (a seat he had unsuccessfully contested in 1898), as a Conservative, and retained his seat in the general election of 1900. In 1904, during the controversy within the Conservative Party over adopting protectionism, he and other members of his family followed Churchill into the Liberal Party in support of free trade.

He sat as an MP until 1910, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Ashby St Ledgers, of Ashby St Ledgers in the County of Northampton, and became Paymaster General in the government of H. H. Asquith. He served as Paymaster General until 1912, and later served as a Lord in Waiting to King George V.

In 1914, he succeeded his father as Baron Wimborne. At the start of World War I, he was appointed to the staff of the newly formed 10th (Irish) Division under Lieutenant-General Sir Bryan Mahon at the Curragh Camp.

==Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 1915–1918==
In February 1915, Wimborne was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in succession to Lord Aberdeen. At this time, the Lord Lieutenant was largely a ceremonial position; real power was in the hands of the Chief Secretary and the Under-Secretary. Determined to be more involved in decision-making, he was appointed Director of Recruiting in October 1915, heading up the new Department of Recruiting for Ireland. He insisted on being kept up to date on the state of the country, and had the Under-Secretary, Sir Matthew Nathan, send him police reports, details of prosecutions and recruitment figures.

On the weekend preceding the Easter Rising, following the capture of the German arms ship &quot;Aud&quot; and the arrest of Sir Roger Casement, Wimborne urged Nathan to order the arrest of a large number of rebel leaders. Nathan was unwilling to do so without the authorisation of the Chief Secretary, Augustine Birrell, who was in London. Before the authorisation was received, the Rising began on 24 April 1916. Wimborne proclaimed martial law in Dublin. Thereafter, the military took control. A new Commander-in Chief, General Sir John Maxwell, arrived in Ireland on 28 April and the rebels surrendered on 29 April. Wimborne initially refused to offer his resignation after the Rising. He resigned under pressure from the government but was re-appointed. In June 1916 he directed the establishment of the Property Losses (Ireland) Committee to assess the many insurance claims resulting from the Rising.

The Royal Commission on the 1916 Rebellion (the Hardinge commission) exonerated Wimborne of any blame for the Rising, saying that his position as Lord Lieutenant was &quot;anomalous in quiet times and almost unworkable in times of crisis&quot;. He continued as Lord Lieutenant for another two years. On his retirement in 1918, he was created Viscount Wimborne, of Canford Magna in the County of Dorset.

==Marriage and issue==

On 10 February 1902, he married at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Eaton Square, London, the Honourable Alice Grosvenor (1880–1948), daughter of Robert Grosvenor, 2nd Baron Ebury. They had one son, Ivor Guest, 2nd Viscount Wimborne, and two daughters, Rosemary and Cynthia.

By the 1930s, they were living separate lives, though remaining on the friendliest terms. From 1934 until her death Alice was linked with the composer William Walton. Wimborne died in June 1939, aged 66, at Wimborne House in Arlington Street, London, the house in which he was born. He was succeeded by his only son, Ivor. Lady Wimborne died in April 1948, aged 67.

<doc id="607556" wikidata="Q5589521" url="?curid=607556" title="Evergreen Point Floating Bridge (1963)">
<text>The Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, officially the Governor Albert D. Rosellini Bridge, and commonly called the SR 520 Bridge or 520 Bridge, was a floating bridge in the U.S. state of Washington that carried State Route 520 across Lake Washington, connecting Medina with the Montlake neighborhood of Seattle.

The bridge&#x27;s total length was approximately . Its floating section was the longest floating bridge in the world until April 11, 2016, when its replacement exceeded it by .

The bridge was named for Evergreen Point, the westernmost of the three small Eastside peninsulas that SR 520 crosses. (The other two are Hunts Point and Yarrow Point.) In 1988, it was renamed for the state&#x27;s 15th governor, Albert D. Rosellini, who had advocated its construction.

Although there were plans to replace the bridge several years following its completion, it was not until much later that investigations revealed the aging bridge to be in poor condition and unable to withstand the major hazards for which it was originally designed. This finding may have accelerated plans to finally replace it. In response to these hazards and the need to expand the current infrastructure, construction on a replacement began in 2012; the new bridge opened in April 2016. The original bridge was closed to traffic on April 22, 2016, and was disassembled over the following months.

==History==
The bridge was opened for commuter traffic on August 28, 1963, after three years of construction. It was built as a four-lane toll bridge to provide easy access from Seattle to Eastside communities such as Bellevue, Kirkland, and Redmond. The total cost of the bridge, in 1961 dollars, was $21 million (at least $127 million in 2011 dollars). To make up for this cost, commuters paid a 35-cent toll in each direction until June 22, 1979. The tollbooths were removed and the plaza space was converted into a flyer stop for Metro Transit buses.

The bridge affected many communities on the Eastside. Redmond&#x27;s population saw a dramatic increase, jumping from less than 1,500 in 1960 to 11,000 in 1970. It was the second floating bridge to cross Lake Washington; the first was the Lake Washington Floating Bridge, built in 1940 as part of U.S. Route 10, later part of Interstate 90, which at its construction was the largest floating structure ever built.

On November 4, 1972, two people drowned after their boat drifted and collided with the bridge&#x27;s windward side during a winter storm. The remaining four people on the boat were later rescued. The incident prompted the Department of Highways to install 88 safety ladders along the bridge.

On August 28, 1988, the bridge was officially renamed for governor Albert D. Rosellini; the Washington State Transportation Commission approved of the renaming three days earlier ahead of the bridge&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebration. At the time, 109,000 vehicles used the bridge on an average day and 529 million vehicles were estimated to have crossed it since it opened.

==Description==

===Drawspan opening===
The bridge was built with a drawspan in the center that could open for boats too tall to go under the bridge. The bridge opened by raising two steel grids about and moving an adjacent pontoon beneath them.

In 1989, an electrical fault caused the drawspan to open during rush hour, causing one death and five injuries. In 2000, a gravel barge struck the bridge.

==Replacement bridge==

Just five years after the bridge opened, a study commissioned by the state legislature was completed to figure out how to provide for the great demand for cross-lake transportation. That study evaluated bridge and tunnel crossings north and south of the bridge. Other plans considered in the late 1980s proposed the addition of rail transit or bus lanes to add capacity. To prepare a case for the state legislature, the Trans-Lake Study was commissioned to study various alternatives. The study brought together 47 representatives of public agencies, neighborhoods, businesses, and advocacy interests.

In 1997, Myint Lwin, WSDOT&#x27;s chief bridge engineer, said that even with repairs, the bridge could be expected to last only about twenty more years (until 2017). The bridge needed to be closed to traffic in high winds, and even after a seismic retrofit in 1999, it was at risk of collapse during an earthquake. Due to the weight of various reinforcements over the years, the bridge deck ultimately sat about lower over the water than it did originally.

Since the bridge was built in the early 1960s, prior to the implementation of modern earthquake standards, its hollow support structures would have likely failed during a major earthquake. Additionally, vibrations induced by storm surges and strong winds could have compromised the drawspan, anchor cables, and pontoons, subjecting them to structural failure. Even for storms below the maximum threshold for failure to occur, Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) still closed the floating bridge to traffic. The original bridge carried two lanes of traffic in each direction, but did not include emergency shoulders or pedestrian and bicycle crossings. This posed traffic problems since any obstruction caused by car breakdown, wreck or maintenance would result in traffic backups.

In 2011, WSDOT broke ground on the replacement bridge. On April 2, 2016, WSDOT held a grand opening ceremony, allowing the public to explore the top deck of the new bridge on the westbound side. The replacement bridge opened to westbound traffic on April 11, 2016, and opened to eastbound traffic on April 25, 2016. The old bridge was permanently closed at 23:00 PDT on April 22, 2016, with demolition completed by the end of 2016. The bridge was removed by spring 2017.

===Construction===

The cost of all improvements to SR-520 between I-5 and I-405, including the new bridge, is forecast to be $4.65 billion.

The first of 21 longitudinal pontoons were positioned on August 11, 2012. Each pontoon is long and wide. The pontoons were constructed in Aberdeen by Kiewit Construction. Pontoon construction was plagued by errors and shoddy construction. Reports included workers installing incorrectly sized rebar, installing it in the wrong location, and even having it missing altogether. Workers also poured concrete in weather that was too wet or too cold. Several of the new pontoons have had problems with cracking, which has been blamed on Kiewit&#x27;s poor work. An independent auditor stated that there had been a long-running pattern of poor-quality work and that WSDOT failed to force Kiewit to take corrective actions. An inspector for the construction called it a disaster waiting to happen, adding &quot;I won&#x27;t drive across that bridge when they have it built.&quot;

By the end of February 2015, enough of the new bridge was in place to block tall ships that used to pass through a drawspan in the Rosellini Bridge. In early July 2015, the westernmost floating pontoon was moved to make room for the installation of the west end of the bridge; on July 8, 2015, all longitudinal pontoons for the new bridge were in place.

==Tolling==
When the bridge opened in 1963, a 35 cent toll was collected to pay off a construction bond. The sole toll plaza was located at the east end of the bridge in Medina and had nine booths. The state government offered discounts to commuters using a ticket book, as well as carpools of two or more people. The toll was retired on June 22, 1979, after the $35 million bond had been paid off 20 years ahead of schedule. More than 213 million vehicles had used the toll bridge and generated $59.6 million in revenue. One of the former tollbooths was reused for a drive-through espresso stand in Juanita.

Tolls were reinstated on December 29, 2011, to fund the original bridge&#x27;s replacement. Within the first year, traffic levels declined by 30 percent and tolls generated $50 million in gross revenue. ESHB 2211, which authorized tolling on the SR 520 bridge beginning in 2010 to fund the new bridge, was signed into law in May 2009 by governor Christine Gregoire. The State Transportation Commission has proposed a toll of US$3.59 each way during peak periods. The proposed rates during other hours were to range from $0 to $2.87.

All tolling was done automatically with no tollbooths. Tolling for people without &quot;Good to Go&quot; passes is done by license plates. Toll readers were located on gantries at the east highrise, but additional gantries on the east mainland were added to facilitate tolling on the new bridge once opened.

Tim Eyman promoted Initiative 1125, which among other measures, would have banned the time-of-day tolling proposed for the bridge, required funding to be used on the road that collected the toll, and required tolls to be set by elected officials. The initiative was defeated by Washington voters.

<text>The vinaceous dove (Streptopelia vinacea) is a bird species in the pigeon family Columbidae that widely resident across the Sahel and Sudan (region).

==Taxonomy==
The vinaceous dove was formally described in 1789 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other doves and pigeons in the genus &quot;Columba&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Columba vinacea&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the earlier publications by French ornithologists Mathurin Jacques Brisson and Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. The vinaceous dove is now placed with 14 other species in the genus &quot;Streptopelia&quot; that was introduced in 1855 by French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek στρεπτός (&quot;streptós&quot;) – literal meaning &quot;twisted&quot;, but by extension, &quot;wearing a torc&quot; (i.e., twisted metal collar) – and πέλεια (&quot;péleia&quot;) meaning &quot;wild dove&quot;. The specific &quot;vinacea&quot; is from Latin &quot;vinaceus&quot;, meaning &quot;of wine&quot; or &quot;vinaceous&quot;. The species is monotypic; no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==

The vinaceous dove is a small, stocky pigeon, typically in length. Its back, wings, and tail are pale brown. When flying, it shows a blackish underwing. The head and the underparts are pale pinkish-grey, and it has a black hind-neck patch edged with white. The legs are red, with white in the tail. Sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults. The call is a fast &quot;coo-cu-cu-coo&quot;.

It builds a stick nest in a tree, often an acacia, and lays two white eggs. Its flight is quick, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings is characteristic of pigeons in general.

==Distribution and habitat==
The vinaceous dove is a common bird that is found in central and western African countries such as Senegal, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Benin, and Nigeria. 

This species is abundant in scrub and savannah.

== Diet ==
Vinaceous doves eat grass seeds, grains, and other vegetation. They are quite terrestrial, and usually forage on the ground. Unlike several other species in this genus, they are very gregarious and often feed in large group, frequently with other doves.

<text>The Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge is a floating bridge in the Seattle metropolitan area of the U.S. state of Washington. It is one of the Interstate 90 floating bridges that carries the eastbound lanes of Interstate 90 across Lake Washington from Seattle to Mercer Island. Westbound traffic is carried by the adjacent Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge.

The Murrow Bridge is the second-longest floating bridge in the world, at (the longest is the Governor Albert D. Rosellini Bridge–Evergreen Point, a few miles north on the same lake). The original Murrow Bridge opened in 1940, and was named the Lake Washington Floating Bridge. It was renamed the Lacey V. Murrow bridge in 1967. The original bridge closed the current bridge opened 

Along with the east portals of the Mount Baker Ridge Tunnel, the bridge is an official City of Seattle landmark and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. While the bridge originally had an opening span at the center of the bridge to allow a horizontal opening of for major waterborne traffic, the only boat passages currently are elevated fixed spans at the termini with of vertical clearance.

==History==

The bridge was the brainchild of engineer Homer Hadley, who had made the first proposal in 1921. The bridge came about after intensive lobbying, particularly by George Lightfoot, who came to be called the &quot;father of the bridge.&quot; Lightfoot began campaigning for the bridge in 1930, enlisting the support of Miller Freeman. Construction began January 1, 1939 and was completed in 1940. The construction cost for the project, including approaches, was approximately $9 million. It was partially financed by a bond issue of $4.184 million. Opened July 2, 1940, the bridge carried US 10 (later decommissioned and renamed Interstate 90). Tolls were removed in 1949. The bridge sank in a storm on November 25, 1990 during refurbishment and repair. The current bridge was built in 1993. The eponymous Lacey V. Murrow was the second director of the Washington State Highway Department and a highly decorated U.S. Air Force officer who served as a bomber pilot in World War II, rising to the rank of graduate of Washington State College in Pullman, he was the oldest brother of CBS commentator Edward R. Murrow.

The original bridge was built under a -year contract awarded to the Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company in the amount of $3.254 million. It included a movable span that could be retracted into a pocket in the center of the fixed span to permit large boats to pass. This design resulted in a roadway bulge that required vehicles to swerve twice across polished steel joints as they passed the bulge. A reversible lane system, indicated by lighted overhead lane control signals with arrow and &#x27;X&#x27; signs, compounded the hazard by putting one lane of traffic on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the bulge during morning and evening rush hours in an effort to alleviate traffic into or out of Seattle. There were many serious collisions on the bridge. The problems grew worse as the traffic load increased over the years and far outstripped the designed capacity. Renovation or replacement became essential and a parallel bridge, the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, was completed in 1989, and named for Hadley in 1993.

With the opening of the new bridge, the 49-year-old Murrow Bridge closed on June 23, 1989, for renovation that was projected to take 

==1990 disaster==
On November 25, 1990, while under re-construction, the original bridge sank because of a series of human errors and decisions. The process started because the bridge needed resurfacing and was to be widened by means of cantilevered additions in order to meet the necessary lane-width specifications of the Interstate Highway System. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) decided to use hydrodemolition (high-pressure water) to remove unwanted material (the sidewalks on the bridge deck). Water from this hydrodemolition was considered contaminated under environmental law and could not be allowed to flow into Lake Washington. Engineers then analyzed the pontoons of the bridge, and realized that they were over-engineered and the water could be stored temporarily in the pontoons. The watertight doors for the pontoons were therefore removed.

A large storm on November 22–24 (the Thanksgiving holiday weekend), filled some of the pontoons with rain and lake water. On Saturday, November 24, workers noticed that the bridge was about to sink, and started pumping out some of the pontoons; on Sunday, November 25, a section of the bridge sank, dumping the contaminated water into the lake along with tons of bridge material. It sank when one pontoon filled and dragged the rest down, because they were cabled together and there was no way to separate the sections under load. No one was hurt or killed, since the bridge was closed for renovation and the sinking took All of the sinking was captured on film and shown on live TV. The cost of the disaster was $69 million in damages. A dozen anchoring cables for the new Hadley bridge were and it was closed for a short time afterward. Westbound traffic was allowed and eastbound traffic was resumed in early December.

The disaster delayed the bridge&#x27;s reopening by 14 months, to September 12, 1993.

===Precedents and lessons learned===
WSDOT had lost another floating bridge, the Hood Canal Bridge, in February 1979 under similar circumstances. It is now known that the other major floating bridge in Washington, the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, was under-engineered for local environmental conditions; that 1963 bridge was replaced with a new floating span

<doc id="607571" wikidata="Q9390570" url="?curid=607571" title="Cubs–White Sox rivalry">
<text>The Cubs–White Sox rivalry (also known as the Crosstown Classic, The Windy City Showdown, Chicago Showdown, North–South Showdown, City Series, Crosstown Series, Crosstown Cup, or Crosstown Showdown) refers to the Major League Baseball (MLB) geographical rivalry between the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox. The Cubs are a member club of MLB&#x27;s National League (NL) Central division, and play their home games at Wrigley Field, located on Chicago&#x27;s North Side. The White Sox are a member club of MLB&#x27;s American League (AL) Central division, and play their home games at Rate Field, located on Chicago&#x27;s South Side.

The terms &quot;North Siders&quot; and &quot;South Siders&quot; are synonymous with the respective teams and their fans, setting up an enduring rivalry. Through the 2024 season, the White Sox lead the regular season series 74–72. There have been eight 3-game series sweeps since interleague play began: four by the Cubs in 1998, 2004, 2007, 2008, and four by the White Sox in 1999, 2008, 2012 and 2021. There have been three season series sweeps, all by the Cubs in 1998 , 2013 and 2024 . The Chicago Transit Authority&#x27;s Red Line train has stops within a block of both ballparks: Addison station for Wrigley Field and Sox–35th station for Rate Field.

==History==
While teams in New York City (such as the Yankees, Giants, and Brooklyn Dodgers) routinely played against each other in World Series matchups throughout the 1940s and 1950s, the two Chicago teams only met once in the 1906 World Series, a celebrated event that seemingly put the city on hold for a full week. The heavily favored but young Cubs (who had won 116 games in the regular season) lost in six games to the veteran and pitching-strong White Sox, the &quot;Hitless Wonders&quot;.

From 1903 until 1942, excluding the years one team or the other won the pennant, the Cubs and White Sox played each other in a best-of-seven postseason City Series. These series were officially sanctioned by the National Baseball Commission and, later, the Commissioner of Baseball. The first series was played in 1903 and was a best-of-15. That year, the Cubs had a 6–3 series lead before the White Sox came back to force a 7–7 tie. Thanks to a rainout, they did not play the decisive 15th game as the players&#x27; contracts expired on October 15. Starting in 1905, the series became best-of-seven and remained that way until 1942. In all, they played 25 City Series with the White Sox winning 18 and the Cubs winning six to go along with the tie of 1903. The 1912 version marked the first time in a Major League Baseball postseason series that a team overcame a 3–0 series deficit as the White Sox won the final four games of the series.

1985 saw the start of an annual &quot;Windy City Classic&quot; charity game. The series alternated between the respective teams&#x27; ballparks, with Comiskey Park hosting the first year followed by Wrigley Field the next. The Sox would go 10–0–2 in this affair that lasted through 1995 (two games were played in 1995). One exhibition between the teams at Wrigley Field on April 7, 1994, was notable for the White Sox having Michael Jordan playing right field – Jordan was playing for a White Sox minor-league affiliate, the Birmingham Barons, during the first of his nearly two seasons of his first retirement from the NBA before his comeback with the Bulls.

Since inter-league play began in 1997, the White Sox and Cubs have routinely played each other four or six times each year (one two or three-game series at each stadium). Based on the availability of tickets and the prices offered through ticket brokers, these games are among the most anticipated of the season.

In 2008, the teams played each other as leaders of their respective divisions for the first time ever: the White Sox in the American League Central and the Cubs in the National League Central. Also for the first time in the rivalry&#x27;s history, both Sunday games to end each series were televised nationally on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot;. The Chicago Cubs swept the White Sox in the first weekend series at Wrigley Field, and the White Sox subsequently swept the Cubs at U.S. Cellular Field during the second weekend series, thus splitting the series 3–3 and resulting in an all-time inter-league series tie of 33–33 through 2008.

The Crosstown Cup trophy was introduced in 2010 and the White Sox won the trophy the first three seasons before the Cubs finally won it in 2013. The Cubs winning the 4 games of their 2013 series marks the inter-league series at 49–45 to the White Sox. In 2014 the White Sox reclaimed the Crosstown Cup after winning the first three games of their four-game series. They won the first two games at Wrigley Field 3–1 in 12 and 4–1 respectively, came back to U.S. Cellular Field to win 8–3 before getting blown out in the final game 12–5.

In 2010, 2011, and 2012, the trophy was sponsored by oil and gas company BP and was known as the BP Crosstown Cup. From 2013 to 2018 there was no corporate sponsor. In 2019 the trophy was sponsored by the financial holding company Wintrust and was therefore called the Wintrust Crosstown Cup. In 2020, the teams faced each other as leaders of their divisions for the first time since 2008 in the Pandemic shortened season with the White Sox taking the three game series at Wrigley and the Cubs taking the three game series on the Southside. Both teams also made the playoffs in the same season for the first time since 2008 but both were eliminated in the Wild Card Round. On August 8, 2021, MLB aired a game on ABC for the first time since with the game between the White Sox and Cubs at Wrigley Field with the White Sox winning the game 9–3. In a game on August 27, 2021, the White Sox and Cubs combined for 30 runs in a 17–13 White Sox victory at Guaranteed Rate Field, the most runs scored in a game between the two teams. It was also the most runs scored by the White Sox against the Cubs. It also included a combined six home runs, four from the Cubs, and two from the White Sox. It also saw White Sox catcher Yasmani Grandal hit two home runs and tying a White Sox franchise record with 8 RBI&#x27;s in his first game since July 5 the same year after coming back from a knee injury.

===Barrett vs. Pierzynski===
The rivalry turned physical on May 20, 2006, when a brawl broke out during a White Sox-Cubs game at U.S. Cellular Field. In the bottom of the second inning, Brian Anderson of the White Sox hit a sacrifice fly, attempting to score catcher A. J. Pierzynski. Pierzynski collided with Cubs&#x27; catcher Michael Barrett. Barrett dropped the ball in the collision and Pierzynski was safe. After slapping home plate in celebration, Pierzynski began to walk away, but Barrett blocked his path and punched him in the jaw. Both benches cleared and a brawl broke out. Umpires debated for 15 minutes before ejecting Pierzynski, Barrett, White Sox outfielder Brian Anderson and Cubs first baseman John Mabry from the game. When play finally resumed, outfielder Scott Podsednik promptly got on base, loading the bases up, and second baseman Tadahito Iguchi cleared them with a grand-slam. The White Sox won the game, 7–0. Michael Barrett was suspended for 10 games, while Brian Anderson was suspended for five and A. J. Pierzynski was fined.

In 2006, Pierzynski was named one of the five American League players in the All-Star Final Vote. Soon afterwards the Chicago White Sox organization began an election campaign using the slogan &quot;Punch A.J.&quot;, inspired by the May 20, 2006 collision and slugging incident between Pierzynski and Michael Barrett. Pierzynski received 3.6 million votes, the most votes in the American League, subsequently sending him to his second All-Star appearance.

==Stadiums==

===White Sox===
The White Sox have always been located on the south side. At the time the White Sox came to town, the Cubs&#x27; home field was West Side Park, in an older section of the city which is now the West Campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago and near the United Center, home of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks. (Coincidentally, for a few seasons in the early 1890s the Cubs home park was within a block of the sites of the future Sox ballparks). In the Cubs moved from the west to the north side, taking over Weeghman Park, the abandoned Federal League facility (later renamed Wrigley Field), thus setting up the current separation.

When the new Comiskey Park (now called Rate Field) was built, many in the media and baseball (including both Cubs and White Sox fans) called the park &quot;sterile&quot;, and lacking the beauty and personality of the old park, even though many seats at the old park were cramped, behind posts, or in the outfield. Others contend that in contrast Wrigley Field is dirty, uncomfortable, and generally unpleasant to be in. Regardless, this again set up a point of rivalry as Cubs fans had their classic park, while White Sox fans had their modern park. Former Sox manager Ozzie Guillén said of Wrigley, &quot;But one thing about Wrigley Field, I puke every time I go there&quot;, further polarizing this point of contention. While several renovations to Rate Field have silenced many criticisms, such as the improved upper deck and bleachers, the difference between the fields remains a point of rivalry between fans of the teams.

===Cubs===
When the Tribune Company bought the Cubs, they immediately started pressing for night baseball, threatening to abandon Wrigley Field otherwise. Night baseball was finally added in 1988, and after some further negotiations with the city, in the winter of 2005–2006 they expanded Wrigley&#x27;s bleachers for the first time since 1938.

Even the neighborhoods around the stadiums show the difference between the fans. Wrigleyville, a part of the Lake View neighborhood, surrounds the Cubs&#x27; stadium, and comprises middle- and upper-middle-class housing, as well as many restaurants, bars and music venues for fans to visit before and after games. In contrast, the Bridgeport neighborhood directly west of the White Sox home field has a more &quot;blue-collar&quot; reputation. There are bars and restaurants in Bridgeport, too, but White Sox fans must walk or drive a few blocks from Rate Field to get to them. Until April 2011, the White Sox opened a brand-new bar and restaurant located at Gate 5 of Rate Field, known as ChiSox Bar &amp; Grill. The new bar and restaurant do not require a game ticket to enter.

==Television coverage==
Until 2004, WGN-TV and the now-defunct FSN Chicago would &quot;switch off&quot; during interleague games: for the Cubs home games, the Cubs commentary team would call the game, while the Sox commentary team would have the call for their home games. Starting in 2005, both WGN and then newly created NBC Sports Chicago show the games on each network with both commentary crews at the same time, allowing the viewer to watch the game without an opposing team bias. The stations generally switched off each day. For example, in a series at Wrigley Field, WGN would treat the game on Friday as a Cubs home game with NBCSC treating it as a White Sox away game; on Sunday WGN would broadcast a White Sox away game and NBCSC showed a Cubs home game; with the other game alternating between the two channels). The shared game status ended following the 2019 season of both teams, the last time WGN broadcast the FTA matchups of both teams, with NBCSC becoming the full time home of the White Sox while the Cubs move on to a team-owned cable channel, Marquee Sports Network. Starting in 2025, the White Sox games would air on the new Chicago Sports Network.

==Performance==
While New York of the 1940s and 1950s often had two or three teams vying for championships, the two Chicago teams had comparatively little to celebrate for a long time, except for pennants in 1945 (Cubs) and 1959 (Sox), until the White Sox won the 2005 World Series and the Cubs won the 2016 World Series. Historically, each team&#x27;s fans felt bad for their own team&#x27;s relatively poor performance, but took solace in that the other team was doing just as badly. Thus, the rivalry often was one in which fans of one team are just as happy for the poor play of the other team as they are for the good play of their own (&quot;schadenfreude&quot;). This above all is what made the Chicago rivalry unique in Major League Baseball. An examination of other great rivalries (Yankees–Red Sox, Mets–Yankees, A&#x27;s–Giants, Dodgers–Giants) shows that both teams have made World Series appearances on a fairly regular basis.

The animosity among fans (that only rarely escalates to violence) is summed up in the lines from the song &quot;The Ballad of the South Side Irish&quot;, echoing sentiments often expressed by at least one side of any number of sports rivalries in America: &quot;When it comes to baseball I&#x27;ve got two favorite clubs, the &#x27;go-go White Sox&#x27;... and whoever plays the Cubs.&quot; Ardent fans such as the late columnist Mike Royko, a Cubs fan, and late writer Nelson Algren, a Sox fan, would take their shots at the other team. Royko once wrote that the reason Sox fans have a &quot;bad attitude&quot; is that when they would go to games at Comiskey Park, the stench of the Union Stock Yards would fill their nostrils and remind them of the status of their team. The stockyards closed in 1971.

Several Cubs and White Sox fans have made a cottage industry selling shirts, hats, and other souvenirs that include slogans intended to take swipes at the opposing teams, rather than support their own. &quot;Time&quot; reported that 36% of Cubs fans were rooting against the White Sox during the 2005 World Series. White Sox Fans wave the Blue Cubs Loss flag after their team defeats the Cubs in mockery of the Cubs Win Flag tradition, in reverse the white Win Flag is waved by the Cubs fans in every win against the White Sox and &quot;Go, Cubs, Go&quot; is played during home victories as well.

Team owners naturally encourage such rivalries (two-time Sox owner Bill Veeck was a master at it) in the hope that they will translate to increased gate receipts, and the Cubs-Sox inter-league games have borne out that theory.

President Barack Obama, an avid White Sox fan, has taken verbal jabs at the Cubs on several occasions. When the New York Yankees (managed by former Cub Joe Girardi) visited the White House in honor of their 2009 World Series championship, Obama said, &quot;It&#x27;s been nine years since your last title—which must have felt like eternity for Yankee fans. I think other teams would be just fine with a spell like that. The Cubs, for example.&quot; Obama however, has stated that while he is aware that many people hate the other team, he does not hate the Cubs and wants them to win as long as they are not playing the White Sox. On the other hand, his wife, First Lady Michelle Obama, has been a lifelong Cubs fan and following the Cubs&#x27; 2016 World Series victory, Barack went as far as to invite them to the White House, tweeting that the Cubs&#x27; historic win was &quot;change that even [he] can believe in&quot;. The Cubs came to the White House four days before the end of Obama&#x27;s presidency.

==&quot;Cursed&quot; teams==
While not meant in the most literal sense to most fans, there is an overall feeling that both teams&#x27; misfortunes began with unfortunate events which some claim have cursed both teams into their poor play. This adds to the overall downtrodden feelings that fans feel for their own teams, making it much easier to revel in the poor play of the other. The two teams have the longest droughts in the MLB. The Cubs had a 108-year drought that went from 1908 to 2016, and the White Sox had an 88-year drought that went from 1917 to 2005.

The Chicago Cubs won ten National League championships between 1901 and 1945, and also had among the best winning percentages in the NL up to that time (3,796–3,022 for a 0.557 winning percentage). The Cubs had a 2 games to 1 lead over the Detroit Tigers in the 1945 World Series, when on October 6, 1945, Cubs fan and local tavern owner Billy Sianis was prevented from reaching his seat because he was accompanied by his pet billy goat. Local legend says that he responded by placing a curse on the Cubs to never again win the World Series, which they were not able to do until 2016. The Cubs, on more than one occasion, have featured a tongue-in-cheek promotion where billy goats are brought into the stadium to be offered as an apology. 

Some historians argue that the genesis of the curse goes back much farther; that the allegedly underhanded way they won the 1908 pennant (leading to their last World Series win) angered the &quot;baseball gods&quot;. For lack of a standard term, this could be called the curse of Fred Merkle, since he was at the center of the controversy. Every post-season they have participated in since then seems to have featured a disaster of some kind, from Hack Wilson losing a fly ball in the sun, to Babe Ruth&#x27;s called shot, to the &quot;Steve Bartman incident&quot;. When they won the division in 1984, their first title since 1945, manager Jim Frey shouted in the champagne-soaked clubhouse, &quot;The monkey&#x27;s off our back!&quot; Some fans took that as the kiss of death... which it proved to be, as the Padres late-inning rally in the final game in San Diego featured a ground ball slipping under the glove of first baseman Leon Durham... an eerie precursor to a similar and much-more-memorialized incident with the Red Sox and &quot;former&quot; Cubs first baseman Bill Buckner that would occur two years later. That requires a quick mention of the &quot;Ex-Cubs Factor&quot;, an offshoot of the main Cubs &quot;curse&quot;: that any team reaching the post-season since the 1945 Series, and having three or more ex-Cubs, was almost certainly doomed to lose in either the playoffs or the Series due to &quot;a critical mass of Cubness&quot;. The 1960 Pirates had been the lone exception until 2001, when the Diamondbacks effectively ended talk of that curse by winning the Series in a dramatic finish that featured two of the three ex-Cubs, one of them (Luis Gonzalez) providing the series-winning RBI.

The White Sox had the best winning percentage of any American League team from 1901 to 1920 (1,638–1,325 for a 0.553 winning percentage), but quickly slipped to among the worst teams after that. Many point to the Black Sox scandal surrounding the 1919 World Series as the point in history that changed the White Sox fortunes. Eight White Sox players conspired to intentionally lose the World Series, and in 1920 were banned from baseball for life. While the White Sox won 4 AL titles in the first 20 years of their existence, they would win only one more league championship in the twentieth century. The term &quot;curse&quot; has seldom been used as such, since the scandal was perceived to be something the players did to themselves rather than being wrought by the front office conducting ill-advised transactions or committing public relations gaffes. In fact, many White Sox fans take offense to the term &quot;curse&quot;. Still, a pall seemed to settle on the franchise (along with a slim budget), and it would be the last years of the Eisenhower administration before they would win the league championship again. When the White Sox clinched the pennant in 1959, broadcaster Jack Brickhouse capped his play-by-play with, &quot;A forty year wait has now ended!&quot; The 2005 pennant ended a forty-&quot;six&quot;-year wait for the next one, while the 2005 World Championship ended an 88-year wait for a World Series victory. This adds a decidedly interesting twist on the rivalry as there were, until 2005, very few fans for either team who were alive to see one side actually claim a title while the other waited.

<doc id="607572" wikidata="Q759524" url="?curid=607572" title="Organizational structure">
<text>An organizational structure defines how activities such as task allocation, coordination, and supervision are directed toward the achievement of organizational aims.

Organizational structure affects organizational action and provides the foundation on which standard operating procedures and routines rest. It determines which individuals get to participate in which decision-making processes, and thus to what extent their views shape the organization&#x27;s actions. Organizational structure can also be considered as the viewing glass or perspective through which individuals see their organization and its environment.

Organizations are a variant of clustered entities.

An organization can be structured in many different ways, depending on its objectives. The structure of an organization will determine the modes in which it operates and performs.
Organizational structure allows the expressed allocation of responsibilities for different functions and processes to different entities such as the branch, department, workgroup, and individual.

Organizations need to be efficient, flexible, innovative and caring in order to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage.

==Types==
===Pre-bureaucratic structures===
Pre-bureaucratic (entrepreneurial) structures lack standardization of tasks. This structure is most common in smaller organizations and is best used to solve simple tasks, such as sales. The structure is totally centralized. The strategic leader makes all key decisions and most communication is done by one on one conversations. It is particularly useful for new (entrepreneurial) business as it enables the founder to control growth and development.

They are usually based on traditional domination or charismatic domination in the sense of Max Weber&#x27;s tripartite classification of authority.

===Bureaucratic structures===
Weber (1948, p. 214) gives the analogy that “the fully developed bureaucratic mechanism compares with other organizations exactly as does the machine compare with the non-mechanical modes of production. Precision, speed, unambiguity, … strict subordination, reduction of friction and of material and personal costs- these are raised to the optimum point in the strictly bureaucratic administration.” Bureaucratic structures have a certain degree of standardization. They are better suited for more complex or larger scale organizations, usually adopting a tall structure. The tension between bureaucratic structures and non-bureaucratic is echoed in Burns and Stalker&#x27;s distinction between mechanistic and organic structures.

The Weberian characteristics of bureaucracy are:
* Clear defined roles and responsibilities
* A hierarchical structure
* Respect for merit

Bureaucratic structures have many levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, all the way to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what they have been doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organized bureaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it has to go through to approve. A disadvantage in bureaucratic structures is that it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can make it hard for a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.

===Post-bureaucratic===
The term of post bureaucratic is used in two senses in the organizational literature: one generic and one much more specific. In the generic sense the term post bureaucratic is often used to describe a range of ideas developed since the 1980s that specifically contrast themselves with Weber&#x27;s ideal type bureaucracy. This may include total quality management, culture management and matrix management, amongst others. None of these however has left behind the core tenets of Bureaucracy. Hierarchies still exist, authority is still Weber&#x27;s rational, legal type, and the organization is still rule bound. Heckscher, arguing along these lines, describes them as cleaned up bureaucracies, rather than a fundamental shift away from bureaucracy. Gideon Kunda, in his classic study of culture management at &#x27;Tech&#x27; argued that &#x27;the essence of bureaucratic control – the formalization, codification and enforcement of rules and regulations – does not change in principle...it shifts focus from organizational structure to the organization&#x27;s culture&#x27;.

Another smaller group of theorists have developed the theory of the Post-Bureaucratic Organization, which attempts to describe an organization that is fundamentally not bureaucratic. Charles Heckscher has developed an ideal type, the post-bureaucratic organization, in which decisions are based on dialogue and consensus rather than authority and command, the organization is a network rather than a hierarchy, open at the boundaries (in direct contrast to culture management); there is an emphasis on meta-decision-making rules rather than decision-making rules. This sort of horizontal decision-making by consensus model is often used in housing cooperatives, other cooperatives and when running a non-profit or community organization. It is used in order to encourage participation and help to empower people who normally experience oppression in groups.

Still other theorists are developing a resurgence of interest in complexity theory and organizations, and have focused on how simple structures can be used to engender organizational adaptations. For instance, Miner &quot;et al.&quot; (2000) studied how simple structures could be used to generate improvisational outcomes in product development. Their study makes links to simple structures and improviser learning. Other scholars such as Jan Rivkin and Sigglekow, and Nelson Repenning revive an older interest in how structure and strategy relate in dynamic environments.

===Functional structure===
A functional organizational structure is a structure that consists of activities such as coordination, supervision and task allocation. The organizational structure determines how the organization performs or operates. The term &quot;organizational structure&quot; refers to how the people in an organization are grouped and to whom they report. One traditional way of organizing people is by function. Some common functions within an organization include production, marketing, human resources, and accounting.

This organizing of specialization leads to operational efficiency, where employees become specialists within their own realm of expertise. On the other hand, the most typical problem with a functional organizational structure is that communication within the company can be rather rigid, making the organization slow and inflexible. Therefore, lateral communication between functions becomes very important, so that information is disseminated not only vertically, but also horizontally within the organization. Communication in organizations with functional organizational structures can be rigid because of the standardized ways of operation and the high degree of formalization.

As a whole, a functional organization is best suited as a producer of standardized goods and services at large volume and low cost. Coordination and specialization of tasks are centralized in a functional structure, which makes producing a limited number of products or services efficient and predictable. Moreover, efficiency can further be realized as functional organizations integrate their activities vertically so that products are sold and distributed quickly and at low cost. For instance, a small business could make components used in production of its products instead of buying them.

Even though functional units often perform with a high level of efficiency, their level of cooperation with each other is sometimes compromised. Such groups may have difficulty working well with each other as they may be territorial and unwilling to cooperate. The occurrence of infighting among units may cause delays, reduced commitment due to competing interests, and wasted time, making projects fall behind schedule. This ultimately can bring down production levels overall, and the company-wide employee commitment toward meeting organizational goals.

===Divisional structure===
The divisional structure or product structure consists of self-contained divisions. A division is a collection of functions which produce a product. It also utilizes a plan to compete and operate as a separate business or profit center. According to Zainbooks.com, divisional structure in the United States is seen as the second most common structure for organization today.

Employees who are responsible for certain market services or types of products are placed in divisional structure in order to increase their flexibility. Examples of divisions include regional (a U.S. Division and an EU division), consumer type (a division for companies and one for households), and product type (a division for trucks, another for SUVs, and another for cars). The divisions may also have their own departments such as marketing, sales, and engineering.

The advantage of divisional structure is that it uses delegated authority so the performance can be directly measured with each group. This results in managers performing better and high employee morale. Another advantage of using divisional structure is that it is more efficient in coordinating work between different divisions, and there is more flexibility to respond when there is a change in the market. Also, a company will have a simpler process if they need to change the size of the business by either adding or removing divisions. When divisional structure is utilized more specialization can occur within the groups. When divisional structure is organized by product, the customer has their own advantages especially when only a few services or products are offered which differ greatly. When using divisional structures that are organized by either markets or geographic areas they generally have similar functions and are located in different regions or markets. This allows business decisions and activities coordinated locally.

The disadvantages of the divisional structure is that it can support unhealthy rivalries among divisions. This type of structure may increase costs by requiring more qualified managers for each division. Also, there is usually an over-emphasis on divisional more than organizational goals which results in duplication of resources and efforts like staff services, facilities, and personnel.

===Matrix structure===

The matrix structure groups employees by both function and product simultaneously. A matrix organization frequently uses teams of employees to accomplish work, in order to take advantage of the strengths, as well as make up for the weaknesses, of functional and decentralized forms. An example would be a company that produces two products, &quot;product A&quot; and &quot;product B&quot;. Using the matrix structure, this company would organize functions within the company as follows: &quot;product A&quot; sales department, &quot;product A&quot; customer service department, &quot;product A&quot; accounting, &quot;product B&quot; sales department, &quot;product B&quot; customer service department, &quot;product B&quot; accounting department.
* Weak/functional matrix: A project manager with only limited authority is assigned to oversee the cross- functional aspects of the project. The functional managers maintain control over their resources and project areas.
* Balanced/functional matrix: A project manager is assigned to oversee the project. Power is shared equally between the project manager and the functional managers. It brings the best aspects of functional and projectized organizations. However, this is the most difficult system to maintain as the sharing of power is a delicate proposition.
* Strong/project matrix: A project manager is primarily responsible for the project. Functional managers provide technical expertise and assign resources as needed.

There are advantages and disadvantages of the matrix structure. Some of the disadvantages include tendencies towards anarchy, power struggles and &#x27;sinking&#x27; to group and division levels. Matrices increase the complexity of the chain of command, which can present problems because of the differentiation between functional managers and project managers. This, in turn, can be confusing for employees to understand who is next in the chain of command. An additional disadvantage of the matrix structure is higher manager to worker ratio that results in conflicting loyalties of employees. However, the matrix structure also has significant advantages that make it valuable for companies to use. The matrix structure may improve upon the &quot;silo&quot; critique of functional management in that it aims to diminish the vertical structure of functional and create a more horizontal structure which allows the spread of information across task boundaries to happen much quicker. It aims to allow specialization to increase depth of knowledge and allows individuals to be chosen according to project needs.

Starbucks is one of the numerous large organizations that successfully developed the matrix structure supporting their focused strategy. Its design combines functional and product based divisions, with employees reporting to two heads.

Some experts also mention the multinational design, common in global companies, such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Toyota and Unilever. This structure can be seen as a complex form of the matrix, as it maintains coordination among products, functions and geographic areas.

With the growth of the internet, and the associated access that gives all levels of an organization to information and communication via digital means, power structures have begun to align more as a wirearchy, enabling the flow of power and authority to be based not on hierarchical levels, but on information, trust, credibility, and a focus on results.

In general, over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that through the forces of globalization, competition and more demanding customers, the structure of many companies has become flatter, less hierarchical, more fluid and even virtual.

===Organizational circle===

===Flat organization===

The Flat organization is common in small companies (entrepreneurial start-ups, university spin offs). As companies grow they tend to become more complex and hierarchical, which lead to an expanded structure, with more levels and departments.

However, in rare cases, such as the examples of Valve, GitHub, Inc. and 37signals, the organization remains very flat as it grows, eschewing middle managers. (However, GitHub subsequently introduced middle managers). All of the aforementioned organizations operate in the field of technology, which may be significant, as software developers are highly skilled professionals, much like lawyers.

Senior lawyers also enjoy a relatively high degree of autonomy within a typical law firm, which is typically structured as a partnership rather than a hierarchical bureaucracy. Some other types of professional organizations are also commonly structured as partnerships, such as accountancy companies and GP surgeries.

=== Bureaucracy ===

Often, growth would result in bureaucracy, the most prevalent structure in the past. It is still, however, relevant in former Soviet Republics, China, and most governmental organizations all over the world. Shell Group used to represent the typical bureaucracy: top-heavy and hierarchical. It featured multiple levels of command and duplicate service companies existing in different regions. All this made Shell apprehensive to market changes, leading to its incapacity to grow and develop further. The failure of this structure became the main reason for the company restructuring into a matrix.

===Team===

One of the newest organizational structures developed in the 20th century is &quot;team&quot; and the related concept of team development or team building. In small businesses, the team structure can define the entire organization. Teams can be both horizontal and vertical. While an organization is constituted as a set of people who synergize individual competencies to achieve newer dimensions, the quality of organizational structure revolves around the competencies of teams in totality. The team could classified into functional team structure, lightweight team structure, heavyweight team structure and autonomous team structure. For example, every one of the Whole Foods Market stores, the largest natural-foods grocer in the US developing a focused strategy, is an autonomous profit centre composed of an average of 10 self-managed teams, while team leaders in each store and each region are also a team. Larger bureaucratic organizations can benefit from the flexibility of teams as well. Xerox, Motorola, and DaimlerChrysler are all among the companies that actively use teams to perform tasks.

However, studies shows that this structure may have challenges for an organization. The scattered nature of team-based organizations makes it difficult for them to communicate and share information across borders, where knowledge exchange between and among teams and stakeholders becomes crucial as team-based organizing becomes the norm. However, this can be tackled by concentrate on their internal tasks as well as their relationships and connections with their multiple stakeholders, both inside and external to the firm.

===Network===
Another modern structure is . A network can be described as “long term purposeful arrangements among distinct but related for-profit organizations that allow those firms in them to gain or sustain competitive advantage” where “communication between people of different ranks tends to resemble later consultation rather than vertical command”. Network organizations lack the hierarchical aspects of other structures and are characterized by clusters of interconnected teams and individuals that come together to form unique teams and complete certain projects or achieve common goals. Participating agents are constrained by their specialization and role within the organization, but their influence varies with the development and dissolution of the projects and teams. For example, although an organization may have separate sales and marketing teams which each operate independently, certain projects will require individuals from those teams to work together and form partnerships for the length of their duration.

This extends out to businesses on a larger scale, where instead of teams within an organization, the network consists of organizations within a market. While business giants risk becoming &quot;too clumsy to proact (such as), act and react efficiently&quot;, a network organization can contract out any business function that can be done better or more cheaply. In essence, these types of network structures&#x27; managers spend most of their time coordinating and controlling external relations, usually by electronic means.

H&amp;M is outsourcing its clothing to a network of 700 suppliers, more than two-thirds of which are based in low-cost Asian countries. Not owning any factories, H&amp;M can be more flexible than many other retailers in lowering its costs, which aligns with its low-cost strategy.

====Advantages====
The potential management opportunities offered by recent advances in complex networks theory have been demonstrated including applications to product design and development, and innovation problem in markets and industries. For these benefits to be realised, the network structure relies on trust through shared values and norms, actively avoiding hold-up problems and opportunism risks. By eliminating the uncertainty that one agent will use any potential gain in bargaining power for their singular gain, a network structure can avoid the associated inefficiencies that would arise.

====Disadvantages====
However, the potential disadvantages for enterprises adopting the networked organizational structure include unreasonable design, insufficient supervision and poor linkage ability. If the different relations required for the network structure contrast too greatly it may lead to confusion, delays, and unnecessary increases in complexity. Due to the network structure relying on many different individuals or teams working together independently, effective supervision is needed to avoid shirking or free riding. Similarly, some individuals and teams coordinate poorly, resulting in communication breakdowns and misunderstanding, which only hinders the progression of tasks.

===Virtual===
Virtual organization is defined as being closely coupled upstream with its suppliers and downstream with its customers such that where one begins and the other ends means little to those who manage the business processes within the entire organization.
A special form of boundaryless organization is &quot;virtual&quot;. Hedberg, Dahlgren, Hansson, and Olve (1999) consider the virtual organization as not physically existing as such, but enabled by software to exist. The virtual organization exists within a network of alliances, using the Internet. This means while the core of the organization can be small but still the company can operate globally be a market leader in its niche. According to Anderson, because of the unlimited shelf space of the Web, the cost of reaching niche goods is falling dramatically. Although none sell in huge numbers, there are so many niche products that collectively they make a significant profit, and that is what made highly innovative Amazon.com so successful.

===Hierarchy-community phenotype model===

In the 21st century, even though most, if not all, organizations are not of a pure hierarchical structure, many managers are still blind to the existence of the flat community structure within their organizations.

The business is no longer just a place where people come to work. For most of the employees, the firm confers on them that sense of belonging and identity –– the firm has become their “village”, their community. The firm of the 21st century is not just a hierarchy which ensures maximum efficiency and profit; it is also the community where people belong to and grow together, where their affective and innovative needs are met.

Lim, Griffiths, and Sambrook (2010) developed the Hierarchy-Community Phenotype Model of Organizational Structure borrowing from the concept of Phenotype from genetics. &quot;A phenotype refers to the observable characteristics of an organism. It results from the expression of an organism’s genes and the influence of the environment. The expression of an organism’s genes is usually determined by pairs of alleles. Alleles are different forms of a gene. In our model, each employee’s formal, hierarchical participation and informal, community participation within the organization, as influenced by his or her environment, contributes to the overall observable characteristics (phenotype) of the organization. In other words, just as all the pair of alleles within the genetic material of an organism determines the physical characteristics of the organism, the combined expressions of all the employees’ formal hierarchical and informal community participation within an organization give rise to the organizational structure. Due to the vast potentially different combination of the employees’ formal hierarchical and informal community participation, each organization is therefore a unique phenotype along a spectrum between a pure hierarchy and a pure community (flat) organizational structure.&quot;

&quot;The Hierarchy-Community Phenotype Model of Organisational Structure views an organisation as having both a hierarchy and a community structure, both equally well established and occurring extensively throughout the organisation. On the practical level, it utilises the organizational chart to study the hierarchical structure which brings across individuals’ roles and formal authority within their designated space at the workplace, and social network analysis to map out the community structure within the organisation, identifying individuals’ informal influences which usually do not respect workplace boundaries and at many times extend beyond the workplace.&quot;

==History==
Organizational structures developed from the ancient times of hunters and collectors in tribal organizations through highly royal and clerical power structures to industrial structures and today&#x27;s post-industrial structures.

As pointed out by Lawrence B. Mohr, the early theorists of organizational structure, Taylor, Fayol, and Weber &quot;saw the importance of structure for effectiveness and efficiency and assumed without the slightest question that whatever structure was needed, people could fashion accordingly. Organizational structure was considered a matter of choice... When in the 1930s, the rebellion began that came to be known as human relations theory, there was still not a denial of the idea of structure as an artifact, but rather an advocacy of the creation of a different sort of structure, one in which the needs, knowledge, and opinions of employees might be given greater recognition.&quot; However, a different view arose in the 1960s, suggesting that the organizational structure is &quot;an externally caused phenomenon, an outcome rather than an artifact.&quot;

In the 21st century, organizational theorists such as Lim, Griffiths, and Sambrook (2010) are once again proposing that organizational structure development is very much dependent on the expression of the strategies and behavior of the management and the workers as constrained by the power distribution between them, and influenced by their environment and the outcome.

==Military command and control==
There are correspondences between Mintzberg&#x27;s organizational archetypes and various approaches to military Command and Control (C2). Mintzberg&#x27;s Machine Bureaucracy represents a highly centralized approach to C2, with a narrow allocation of decision rights, restricted patterns of interaction among organization members, and a restricted flow of information. Mintzberg&#x27;s Adhocracy, on the other hand, represents a more networked and less centralized approach to C2, with more individual initiative and self-synchronization. It involves a broader allocation of decision rights, broader interaction patterns, and broader information distribution. Mintzberg&#x27;s other organization types (for example, the Professional Bureaucracy and the Simple Structure) fall in between these two.

Moreover, Walker et. al states the event analysis for systematic teamwork (EAST) method as one of the military command and control approach provides a means of describing emergent system-level features that result from the intricate interactions of system constituents (human and technical). They are modelled using task, social, and propositional networks and presented using an integrated methodologies approach. The social and technical principle of function and approximation, which states that similar individuals and the same technology may achieve the same objective via entirely distinct paths and entirely different starting points, is one important aspect of EAST. In addition, desirable emergent features, such as systems level &quot;shared awareness&quot;, pace, agility, and self-synchronization might appear due to the indisputable reality that humans may adjust to the techno-organisational aspects of a particular system.

==Operational and informal==

The set organizational structure may not coincide with facts, evolving in operational action. Such divergence decreases performance, when growing as a wrong organizational structure may hamper cooperation and thus hinder the completion of orders in due time and within limits of resources and budgets. Further, the informal organization, which is the structure of social interactions that emerges within organizations, may be subject to restrictions also tends to lag in its integration into the newly established formal organisation, whereas formal organization or the subjective norms system created by managers can be changed relatively quickly.

Organizational structures should be adaptive to process requirements, aiming to optimize the ratio of effort and input to output.

== Configurations of organizational structure according to Mintzberg ==
=== Parts of organization ===

Henry Mintzberg considers five main parts of organization:
* Strategic apex (leaders of organization)
* Middle line (managers of lower level)
* Operating core (workers of lowest level, directly producing something or providing services)
* Technostructure (analysts)
* Support staff (helping other members of organisation to perform their function)

An additional element is organisational ideology.

=== Mechanisms of coordination ===

Mintzberg considers six main mechanisms of coordination of work:
* Mutual adjustment (without formal, standardized mechanisms)
* Direct supervision (when one person, leader of organization, gives direct orders to others)
* Standardization of work processes (based on the documents that regulate work and are produced by technostructure)
* Standardization of outputs (only the results of work are regulated)
* Standardization of skills (based on preparing the specialists outside the organization)
* Standardization of norms (based on organisation&#x27;s values, ideology)

=== Configurations of organizations ===

Mintzberg considers seven main configurations of organizational structure:

# Entrepreneurial organization (strategic apex, direct supervision dominate)
# Machine organization (technostructure, standardization of work processes dominate)
# Professional organization (operating core, standardization of skills dominate)
# Diversified organization (middle level, standardization of outputs dominate)
# Innovative organization (support staff, mutual adjustment dominate)
# Missionary organization (ideology, standardization of norms dominate)
# Political organization (no part or mechanism of coordination dominates)

Entrepreneurial organisation or Simple structure has simple, informal structure. Its leader coordinates the work using direct supervision. There is no technostructure, little support staff. Such structure is usually found in organizations with environment that is simple (so that one man could have significant influence), but changing (so that flexibility of one man would give a significant advantage over the bureaucratic structures).

Machine organisation or Machine bureaucracy has formal rules regulating the work, developed technostructure and middle line, is centralised, hierarchical. Such structure is common when the work is simple and repetitive. Organizations also tend to achieve such structure when they are strongly controlled from outside. Also, such structure is common for organizations that perform work that is related to some sort of control (for example, prisons, police), or organizations with special safety requirements (for example, fire departments, airlines).

Professional configuration or Professional bureaucracy mostly coordinates the work of members of operating core, professionals, through their training (for example, in university). Operating core in such organisation is large, middle line insignificant, as the professionals perform complex work and have significant autonomy. Technostructure is also insignificant. Support staff, helping the professionals to do their job, is numerous. Professionals participate in administrative work, thus there are many committees. Such structure is common for universities, hospitals, law firms.

Diversified Configuration or Divisionalized form consists of several parts having high autonomy. Such structure is common for old, large organizations.

Innovative Configuration or Adhocracy gathers the specialists of different fields into teams for specific tasks. Such organizations are common when environment is complex and dynamic. Mintzberg considers two types of such organization: operating adhocracy and administrative adhocracy. Operating adhocracy solves innovative problems for its clients. Examples of such organisation can be advertising agency or firm that develops the prototypes of products. Administrative adhocracy has teams solving problems for the organization itself. As an example of such organization Mintzberg gives NASA when it worked on Apollo program.

Missionary organisation coordinates the work through organisational ideology. Formal rules in such organization are not numerous. Such organizations are decentralized, the differences between levels are not significant.

Political configuration happens when the power is mostly used through workplace politics.

<doc id="607573" wikidata="Q3760457" url="?curid=607573" title="George Cadogan, 5th Earl Cadogan">
<text>George Henry Cadogan, 5th Earl Cadogan (12 May 1840 – 6 March 1915), styled Viscount Chelsea from 1864 to 1873, was a British Conservative politician.

==Background and education==
Cadogan was the eldest son of Henry Cadogan, 4th Earl Cadogan, by his wife Mary, daughter of Reverend Gerald Wellesley, younger brother of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. He was born in the city of Durham and baptised at St James&#x27;s, Westminster, London. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford.

==Military service==
As Viscount Chelsea, Cadogan served as a Major in the Royal Westminster Militia from 1865 to 1872; he was later Honorary Colonel of the battalion (which had become the 5th (Royal Westminster Militia) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers) from 1886, and of the 2nd (South Middlesex) Rifle Volunteer Corps from March 1892 to November 1902.

==Political career==
In the 1868 general election, he stood unsuccessfully as parliamentary candidate for Bury, Lancashire but was successfully returned as member of parliament for Bath in a by-election in May 1873, just before he was ennobled on the death of his father on 8 June and had to move to the House of Lords. He was made Under-Secretary for War in 1875 and Under-Secretary to the Colonies in 1878 by Disraeli.

He served under Lord Salisbury as Lord Privy Seal from 1886 to 1892 (after 1887 in the Cabinet), and again in the cabinet as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1895 to 1902. In the latter office, he supported the Land Act of 1896 which enabled Irish tenants to buy their homes from their landlords&#x27; estates and pressed the Treasury for more liberal terms than initially intended, appointed commissions to investigate intermediate education (1899) and university education (1901), and sponsored the Act of 1899 that created a department of agriculture, industries and technical education for Ireland.

He was first Mayor of Chelsea in 1900 and a justice of the peace for the counties of Middlesex, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and London.

==Philanthropy==
By 1888, at the initiative of the Fifth Earl, building work was well underway at the south-eastern end of London&#x27;s Sloane Street to rebuild Holy Trinity Church to the design of the leading Arts and Crafts architect John Dando Sedding. Cadogan funded the entire initial operation, including the commissioning of numerous fittings for the new building by leading sculptors and designers including Henry Wilson (who assumed overall artistic control when Sedding died prematurely), Onslow Ford, Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris, Nelson Dawson and Henry Hugh Armstead. Money was found for the installation of a great organ by James John Walker, which quickly became famous for its cathedral-like effect in the opulent acoustic of the building. The church (and its fittings, including the organ) remain a testament to a very particularly focused example of aristocratic patronage.

As Lord of the Manor of Chelsea, he held large estates there, much of which he dedicated to houses for the working class.

During his lifetime Lord Cadogan commissioned a mausoleum for family interments at Brookwood Cemetery but in 1910 he decided he no longer wanted to be interred in the mausoleum. This building, the largest mausoleum in the cemetery, was bought by the cemetery owners, the London Necropolis Company, fitted with shelves and niches to hold urns, and used as a dedicated columbarium from then on.

==Family==
On 16 May 1865, he married Lady Beatrix Craven, fourth daughter of William Craven, 2nd Earl of Craven. They had nine children:

*Albert Edward George Henry, briefly Viscount Chelsea (1866–1878), a godchild of Albert, Prince of Wales, later Edward VII.
*Henry Arthur, Viscount Chelsea (1868–1908).
*Gerald Oakley, 6th Earl Cadogan and briefly Viscount Chelsea (1869–1933).
*Lady Emily Julia (1871–1909), married William Brownlow, 3rd Baron Lurgan.
*Lewin Edward (1872–1917).
*Lady Sophie Beatrix Mary (1874–1943), married Sir Samuel Scott, 6th Baronet.
*William George Sydney (1879–1914), killed in action.
*Edward Cecil George (1880–1962).
*Alexander George Montagu (1884–1968).

He bought Culford Park, Culford, Suffolk, in 1889 as a family home. It is now a private school.

Lord Cadogan&#x27;s wife died in 1907 and on 12 January 1911, he married his first cousin once removed, Adele, daughter of Lippo Neri, Count Palagi del Palagio and Olivia Georgiana Cadogan. Lord Cadogan died in Chelsea, London, on 6 March 1915, aged 74. The Countess Cadogan died in February 1960.

<doc id="607574" wikidata="Q2074361" url="?curid=607574" title="Six Flags Over Texas">
<text>Six Flags Over Texas is a 212-acre (86 ha) amusement park, in Arlington, Texas, east of Fort Worth and west of Dallas. It is the first amusement park in the Six Flags chain, and features themed areas and attractions. The park opened on August 5, 1961, after a year of construction and an initial investment of US$10 million by real estate developer Angus G. Wynne Jr.

The park is managed by the Six Flags Entertainment Corp., which owns a 54% interest of the Texas Limited Partnership that owns the park. Six Flags Over Texas Fund, Ltd., a private-equity and asset-management firm, headed by Dallas businessman Jack Knox, bought the park in 1969. Over the years, the various companies that managed the park exercised options to purchase interest in the fund. Six Flags Entertainment has an option to purchase the remaining 46% in 2028. In 1991, Time Warner Entertainment began managing park operations. In 1998, Time Warner sold its interests in the Six Flags parks to Premier Parks, of Oklahoma City, which later changed its name to Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc.

==History==

After a visit to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, shortly after its opening, a wealthy real estate developer, Angus G. Wynne Jr., concluded that his home state, Texas, should have a similar park. Planning for such a place began in 1959, under the leadership of Wynne and the Great Southwest Corporation, along with the backing of various New York City investors. Construction of the park began in August 1960.

The name &quot;Six Flags Over Texas&quot; refers to the flags of the six nations that have governed Texas: Spain, France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the United States of America, and the Confederate States of America. Wynne originally intended to name the park &quot;Texas Under Six Flags&quot;. Various legends have attributed the name change to his wife, Joann; to the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, of which his wife may have been a member; and to his entertainment director, Charles Meeker, who is said to have stated &quot;Texas isn&#x27;t &#x27;under&#x27; anything.&quot; The original park was divided into six themed areas for each of the six entities that had ruled Texas. Other themed areas have since been added.

Six Flags Over Texas opened its gates from July 29 to August 4, 1961, to several local corporations that Wynne had invited as part of a &quot;soft-test opening&quot;. The park held its grand-opening ceremonies on Saturday, August 5, 1961. Dignitaries included the mayors of Arlington, Dallas, Fort Worth, Grand Prairie, and Irving. Park attendance reached 8,374. Admission cost $2.75 () for adults and $2.25 () for children; parking cost 50 cents (); hamburgers, 35 cents (); soft drinks, 10 cents (). On opening day, guests could visit the six original themed sections: Mexico, Spain, France, The Confederacy, Texas, and Modern (representing the United States). According to the 1961 Park Map there were 46 &quot;major attractions&quot;. The park&#x27;s first season, lasting 45 days and ending on November 25, 1961, was a success, with over 550,000 visitors.

During its first decade, the park added two sections: Boomtown, named after the boomtowns that sprang up quickly during Texas&#x27; oil boom era and the &quot;Tower Section&quot;, named after the Oil Derrick observation tower built in 1969. The park also added two attractions: El Aserradero in 1963 and the Runaway Mine Train roller coaster in 1966. Attendance reached close to 2 million visitors a year by the end of the decade. 

In 1974, Six Flags Over Texas announced attendance had reached 2,184,000.

For the 50th anniversary (2011), Six Flags Over Texas introduced the first I-Box roller coaster track with a transformation of Texas Giant. The reception from the conversion led the manufacturer to bring the new technology all over the world. 

During this time, Six Flags (the company) began to remove licensed theming from its theme parks, including from attractions that the park had built in previous years. For example, Six Flags Over Texas had to rename Tony Hawk&#x27;s Big Spin to Pandemonium.

In 2020, park management decided to expand from a March-December operating season to year-round operations. But on March 13, 2020, Six Flags suspended operations on its properties for the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas. During the closure, the park donated food and supplies to local charities. The park reopened to members and season pass holders on June 19 and to the general public on June 22.

=== Confederate themes ===
For more than three decades, one of the original themed areas was The Confederacy, which showcased Civil War re-enactments and displayed the Confederate battle flag. 

In the 1990s, it was rethemed as &quot;Old South&quot; and all Confederate battle flags were removed. The shift drew little attention as there were no high-profile rides in that area. However, the Confederate &quot;stars and bars&quot; remained one of the six flags that was flown at the park entrance. 

In August 2017, in response to the controversial Unite the Right rally that was held in Charlottesville, Virginia, the park replaced its six flags (which had included the first Confederate flag, a Republic of Texas flag, a 19th-century Spanish flag, an 18th-century French flag, a 19th-century United States flag, and a 19th-century Mexican flag) with six American flags. A representative of the park told KXAS-TV, &quot;We always choose to focus on celebrating the things that unite us versus those that divide us. As such, we have changed the flag displays in our park to feature American flags.&quot;

<text>A wooden roller coaster is a type of roller coaster classified by its wooden track, which consists of running rails made of flat steel strips mounted on laminated wood. The support structure is also typically made of wood, but may also be made of steel lattice or truss, which has no bearing on a wooden coaster&#x27;s classification. The type of wood often selected in the construction of wooden coasters worldwide is southern yellow pine, which grows abundantly in the southern United States, due to its density and adherence to different forms of pressure treatment.

Early wooden roller coaster designs of the 19th century featured a single set of wheels running on top of the track, which was common in scenic railway rides. John A. Miller introduced side friction coasters and later underfriction coasters in the early 20th century, which added additional sets of wheels running along multiple sides of the track to allow for more intense ride design with sharper turns and steeper drops. The underfriction design became commonplace and continues to be used in modern roller coaster design.

Traditionally, wooden roller coasters were not capable of featuring extreme elements such as inversions, near-vertical drops, and overbanked turns commonly found on steel roller coasters after the introduction of tubular steel track by Arrow Development in 1959. Son of Beast at Kings Island made history in 2000 by incorporating the first successful attempt of an inversion on a wooden coaster, a vertical loop made of steel. A decade later, the introduction of Topper Track by Rocky Mountain Construction allowed for new possibilities, with corkscrews, overbanked turns, and other inverting elements appearing on wooden coasters such as Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City and Goliath at Six Flags Great America.

==History==

=== Early 20th century ===
The 1920s are generally considered the Golden Age of coaster design. This was the decade when many of the world&#x27;s most iconic coasters were built. Some of these include the Giant Dipper at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and its counterpart at Belmont Park, the Cyclone at Coney Island, the Big Dipper at Geauga Lake, The Thriller at Euclid Beach Park, and the Roller Coaster at Lagoon. All of these rides were built during this time. The decade was also the design peak for some of the world&#x27;s greatest coaster designers, including John A. Miller, Harry Traver, Herb Schmeck, and the partnership of Prior and Church. Many wooden roller coasters of this time were demolished during the Great Depression, but a few still stand as American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) classics and landmarks.

===1970s and 1980s===
This relatively quiet age of coaster design following the Great Depression was brought to an end by The Racer at Kings Island, which opened in 1972 and sparked a second &quot;Golden Age&quot; of wooden coaster design. After their success with the Racer at Kings Island, the Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC) constructed another 9 roller coasters over the next decade. About half were small family coasters, two were racing coasters similar to the Racer, and two were out and back coasters with custom designs. One of these, Screamin&#x27; Eagle at Six Flags St. Louis, was the last coaster designed by John Allen before his retirement. After these coasters, PTC stopped producing roller coasters, but continues to produce wooden roller coaster trains as Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. Their distinctive rectangular cars are widely used on wooden coasters around the world.

A notable non-PTC coaster built during this time was The Beast at Kings Island. After John Allen refused to design the coaster in lieu of retirement, Kings Island built the coaster themselves, with the coaster designed by Al Collins and Jeff Gramke and construction overseen by Charlie Dinn. Rather than a typical out and back layout, the coaster sprawled over the woods at the back of the park, using the terrain to create an elevation change from lowest to highest point of 201 feet, even though the coaster was only 118 feet tall. The coaster also had two lift hills which, while common for mine train coasters at the time, was uncommon for wooden coasters. Opening in 1979, the coaster was, and still is, the longest wooden roller coaster in the world at 7,361 feet. Another significant wooden coaster of this era was the racing American Eagle at (now) Six Flags Great America, built by Intamin in 1981, which still holds the records for racing wooden coasters of height (127 ft), length (4650 ft), speed (66 mph), and drop (147 ft).

After the surge in the 1970s, wooden coasters construction became stagnant due to the steel roller coaster being much more popular. Most original coasters during this time were designed by William Cobb, such as Monstre at La Ronde. Another trend during the 1980s was relocating old wooden coasters in danger of being destroyed. Charlie Dinn, who formed Dinn Corporation after leaving Kings Island in 1984, oversaw some of these relocations, including the relocation of The Rocket from Playland Park to Knoebels Amusement Resort in Pennsylvania. It now operates as the Phoenix and is ranked highly on wooden coaster polls.

In 1988, Charlie Dinn started a partnership with Curtis D. Summers to design and build new wooden coasters. Between 1988 and 1991, they designed and built ten new wooden coasters. While most were of typical wooden coaster size, a few set coaster records. Hercules at Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom, built in 1989, had the tallest wooden coaster drop at 150 feet. Texas Giant at Six Flags Over Texas and Mean Streak at Cedar Point were large wooden coasters with similar layouts, with the later opening as the tallest wooden coaster in the world at 161 feet. After a dispute during construction of Pegasus at Efteling, Dinn Corporation closed down and the partnership ended.

===Custom Coasters International (1990s)===

Custom Coasters International was formed in 1991 by Denise Dinn-Larrick (daughter of Charlie Dinn), her brother Jeff Dinn, and her husband Randy Larrick. After the closure of Dinn Corporation, several other designers joined CCI. The company&#x27;s first coaster, Kingdom Coaster at Dutch Wonderland, was a small family coaster that stood only 55 feet high. As time went on, they began to design larger coasters. One of their earlier coasters that was well received was The Raven at Holiday World. Custom Coasters took on increasingly high numbers of wooden coaster projects, including 7 coasters in 2000 alone (The Boss at Six Flags St. Louis, which was the largest with a 153-foot drop and almost a mile of track; Medusa at Six Flags Mexico; Mega Zeph at the defunct Six Flags New Orleans; Boulder Dash at Lake Compounce; Villain at the defunct Geauga Lake; at the defunct Myrtle Beach Pavilion; and The Legend at Holiday World).

CCI&#x27;s coaster designs included both out and back layouts like Hoosier Hurricane at Indiana Beach as well as more twisted layouts like Megafobia at Oakwood Theme Park. Megafobia was also the company&#x27;s first coaster outside the United States. CCI coasters were also unique at the time for sometimes featuring angle iron support structures rather than wooden beams (the track remains the same as other wooden coasters). Most CCI coasters ran Philadelphia Toboggan Company trains, although some, like The Boss at Six Flags St. Louis, run trains from the German manufacturer Gerstlauer.

In 2002, Custom Coasters declared bankruptcy while building the New Mexico Rattler at Cliff&#x27;s Amusement Park. The company left a significant legacy on the coaster industry. The high number of wooden coasters they constructed, 34 over their decade of operation, helped to rekindle interest in the wooden roller coasters and allowed modern wooden coaster designers to thrive. Designers from CCI went on to form modern wooden coaster design firms, like Great Coasters International, The Gravity Group, and the wooden coaster department at S&amp;S Worldwide. Many of their coasters rank highly in wooden coaster polls, including Shivering Timbers at Michigan&#x27;s Adventure and Boulder Dash at Lake Compounce. In 2013, Boulder Dash was rated the number one wooden roller coaster in the world by Amusement Today.

===21st century===
Great Coasters International (GCI) was formed in 1994 by Mike Boodley and Clair Hain, Jr, the former of whom was a designer at Custom Coasters prior to GCI. The first coaster was Wildcat at Hersheypark which opened in 1996. Since then, they have become one of the major wooden coaster designers in the industry, with award-winning coasters like Lightning Racer at Hersheypark and Thunderhead at Dollywood. GCI&#x27;s coasters feature highly twisted layouts with many crossovers, and usually use GCI&#x27;s own wooden coaster trains called Millennium Flyers. Their designs are inspired by coasters from the 1920s, specifically those by Fred Church and Harry Traver, and the company focuses on making the structures of their coasters aesthetically appealing and artistic.

In 2001, Swiss steel coaster designer Intamin began producing wooden roller coasters using prefabricated track. Their wooden coasters are known for large amounts of airtime (including ejector airtime), smooth ride experiences, and steep drops. T Express in Everland is currently the tallest wooden coaster in the world at 183 feet tall. While only having built 4 wooden coasters, all are praised by coaster enthusiasts, with all 4 being within the top 20 wooden coasters in the world on Mitch Hawkers poll. Since 2010, El Toro at Six Flags Great Adventure, which opened in 2006, has been ranked the number one wooden coaster in the world on Mitch Hawkers poll.

Notable designers from the former Custom Coasters International formed The Gravity Group and in 2005 opened Hades (now Hades 360) at Mt. Olympus Water and Theme Park. The coaster features highly unique elements, including an airtime filled pre-lift section, an 800-foot tunnel underneath a parking lot, and a 90 degree banked turn. In 2006, The Gravity Group built The Voyage at Holiday World, a large wooden coaster which stands 163 feet tall, has over 6,442 feet of track, three 90 degree banked turns, and has been ranked the number one wooden coaster in the world by Amusement Today five times. Many of the Gravity Group&#x27;s coasters are highly unique and custom built for the park, such as Twister at Gröna Lund, which has a highly compact layout to fit in the parks small footprint. Their coasters have become very popular in China, in which 12 coasters have been built since 2009.

Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC) has recently been revolutionizing the modern wooden coaster. In 2011, they renovated the Texas Giant, which had become very rough and hard to maintain, into a steel roller coaster. This treatment became popular and was later applied to other aging roller coasters such as Iron Rattler and Twisted Colossus. In addition, RMC designs and builds their own original wooden coasters. In 2016, the company opened the world&#x27;s first launched wooden roller coaster, Lightning Rod which opened at Dollywood in 2016, and until 2024 featured a magnetic launch of 45 mph up a 200&#x27; hill, similar to the magnetic lift on Maverick.

===First inverting wooden coasters===

In 2000, Kings Island opened Son of Beast. Designed by Werner Stengel and built by the Roller Coaster Corporation of America, the roller coaster broke many world records. With a height of , it was the first wooden roller coaster to top . It was also the first modern wooden roller coaster to feature an inversion, a vertical loop, which was made of steel. The ride was well-received but was plagued by a number of incidents, including two that were serious, eventually leading to its demise in 2012.

In the 2010s, a new era of wooden roller coasters came about with the introduction of Topper Track developed by Rocky Mountain Construction. The new technology replaced the flattened steel strip and upper two layers of wood traditionally used in wooden track design with a steel box, which led to rides like the triple-inverting Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City in 2012. Others like Wildfire at Kolmården Wildlife Park and Goliath at Six Flags Great America soon followed. Topper Track provides the added benefit of smoother rides and lower maintenance costs.

The Gravity Group also designed five wooden coasters with a single inversion: these include coasters at each of three Oriental Heritage theme parks in China, all named Jungle Trailblazer, as well as Mine Blower in Fun Spot Kissimmee and the conversion of their existing Hades 360 in Mt. Olympus Water &amp; Theme Park.

==Materials==
===Southern yellow pine===
The common choice of wood selected for modern wooden roller coasters worldwide is southern yellow pine, a softwood abundant in the southern United States from eastern Texas to Virginia. It is known for its strength, which comes from its extremely dense properties. Southern pine is also easy to cut and responds well to pressure treatment.

===Prefabricated track===
Companies like Intamin and Rocky Mountain Construction began using prefabricated track in the 2010s. The design borrows the principles of steel coaster manufacturing and applies them to wood.

Traditional wooden coaster track is typically built on site. It is cut as needed, bent to the proper shape, and mounted layer-by-layer to the support structure with steel running plates. Prefabricated track, on the other hand, is manufactured in a factory, temperature-controlled setting. It is made of many thin layers of wood that are glued together and then laser cut to exact specifications. The track is made in sections, which have special joints on the ends to allow them to snap together. The result is generally higher precision than what could be achieved by hand, leading to a smoother ride and reduced cost surrounding construction and maintenance. In addition, unlike traditional wooden coasters which feature bare metal wheels, the trains for a prefabricated wooden coaster have wheels made of polyurethane treads, similar to a steel coaster.

== Wooden versus steel ==
Wooden roller coasters provide a very different ride and experience from steel roller coasters. While they are traditionally less capable than a steel coaster when it comes to inversions and elements (except for the chain lift hill), wooden coasters instead rely on an often rougher and more &quot;wild&quot; ride (depending on train speed and/or track layout), as well as a more psychological approach to inducing fear. Their structures and track, which usually move anywhere from a few inches to a few feet with a passing train, give a sense of unreliability and the &quot;threat&quot; of collapse or disregard for safety. Of course, this assumption is purely mental, since wooden roller coaster supports and track systems are designed to sway with the force produced by the coaster. If the track and structure were too rigid, they would break under the strain of the passing train. The swaying of the track reduces the maximum force applied, like a shock absorber.

Like steel roller coasters, wooden roller coasters usually use the same three-wheel design, pioneered by John Miller. Each set of wheels includes a running wheel (on top of the track), a side friction (or &quot;guide&quot;) wheel (to guide motion in the lateral plane and reduce excessive side-to-side movement known as &quot;hunting&quot;) and an upstop wheel (beneath the track to prevent cars from flying off the track). Some wooden coasters, such as Leap-The-Dips, do not have upstop wheels and are known as side friction roller coasters. As a result, the turns and drops are more gentle than on modern wooden roller coasters. Scenic Railway roller coasters also lack upstop wheels but rely on a brake operator to control the speed so that upstop wheels are not necessary. A handful of wooden coasters use flanged wheels, similar to a rail car, eliminating the need for side friction wheels.

<doc id="607577" wikidata="Q2421183" url="?curid=607577" title="Activated complex">
<text>In chemistry, an activated complex represents a collection of intermediate structures in a chemical reaction when bonds are breaking and forming. The activated complex is an arrangement of atoms in an arbitrary region near the saddle point of a potential energy surface. The region represents not one defined state, but a range of unstable configurations that a collection of atoms pass through between the reactants and products of a reaction. Activated complexes have partial reactant and product character, which can significantly impact their behaviour in chemical reactions. 

The terms activated complex and transition state are often used interchangeably, but they represent different concepts. Transition states only represent the highest potential energy configuration of the atoms during the reaction, while activated complex refers to a range of configurations near the transition state. In a reaction coordinate, the transition state is the configuration at the maximum of the diagram while the activated complex can refer to any point near the maximum.

Transition state theory (also known as activated complex theory) studies the kinetics of reactions that pass through a defined intermediate state with standard Gibbs energy of activation . The transition state, represented by the double dagger symbol represents the exact configuration of atoms that has an equal probability of forming either the reactants or products of the given reaction.

The activation energy is the minimum amount of energy to initiate a chemical reaction and form the activated complex. The energy serves as a threshold that reactant molecules must surpass to overcome the energy barrier and transition into the activated complex. Endothermic reactions absorb energy from the surroundings, while exothermic reactions release energy. Some reactions occur spontaneously, while others necessitate an external energy input. The reaction can be visualized using a reaction coordinate diagram to show the activation energy and potential energy throughout the reaction.

Activated complexes were first discussed in transition state theory (also called activated complex theory), which was first developed by Eyring, Evans, and Polanyi in 1935.

== Reaction rate ==

=== Transition state theory ===
Transition state theory explains the dynamics of reactions. The theory is based on the idea that there is an equilibrium between the activated complex and reactant molecules. The theory incorporates concepts from collision theory, which states that for a reaction to occur, reacting molecules must collide with a minimum energy and correct orientation. The reactants are first transformed into the activated complex before breaking into the products. From the properties of the activated complex and reactants, the reaction rate constant is

formula_1

where &quot;K&quot; is the equilibrium constant, formula_2 is the Boltzmann constant, T is the thermodynamic temperature, and &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant. Transition state theory is based on classical mechanics, as it assumes that as the reaction proceeds, the molecules will never return to the transition state.

=== Symmetry ===
An activated complex with high symmetry can decrease the accuracy of rate expressions. Error can arise from introducing symmetry numbers into the rotational partition functions for the reactants and activated complexes. To reduce errors, symmetry numbers can by omitted by multiplying the rate expression by a statistical factor:

formula_3

where the statistical factor formula_4 is the number of equivalent activated complexes that can be formed, and the &quot;Q&quot; are the partition functions from the symmetry numbers that have been omitted.

The activated complex is a collection of molecules that forms and then explodes along a particular internal normal coordinate. Ordinary molecules have three translational degrees of freedom, and their properties are similar to activated complexes. However, activated complexed have an extra degree of translation associated with their approach to the energy barrier, crossing it, and then dissociating.

<text>Lawrence Dundas, 1st Marquess of Zetland, (16 August 1844 – 11 March 1929), known as Lawrence Dundas until 1873 and as The Earl of Zetland from 1873 to 1892, was a British hereditary peer and Conservative statesman. He was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland between 1889 and 1892.

==Early life and education==
Lord Zetland was born in London, the son of John Charles Dundas, younger son of Lawrence Dundas, 1st Earl of Zetland (Zetland is an archaic spelling of Shetland). His mother was Margaret Matilda, daughter of James Talbit. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Military service==
Zetland was commissioned as a Cornet in the Royal Horse Guards in 1866. By 1869 Zetland was a Lieutenant and he retired from the army in 1872.

==Political career==
In 1872 Zetland was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond, North Yorkshire that same year. However, he sat in the House of Commons for less than a year before succeeding his uncle as third Earl of Zetland. A Lord in Waiting from May to September 1880, Lord Zetland subsequently moved from supporting the Liberals to joining the Conservative Party in 1884. In 1889 he was sent to Ireland as Lord Lieutenant. The same year he was appointed a Knight of the Order of Saint Patrick (KP). In the post he proved both successful and popular, and remained there until the Liberals returned to power in 1892. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1889 and in 1892, on Lord Salisbury&#x27;s recommendation, he was created Earl of Ronaldshay, in the County of Orkney and Zetland, and Marquess of Zetland.

In the 1890s Lord Zetland became more involved in local politics, becoming an alderman on the North Riding of Yorkshire County Council in 1894 and being elected Mayor of Richmond in 1895 and 1896. In 1900 he was made a Knight of the Thistle. A freemason like his uncle and grandfather, Zetland was the society&#x27;s provincial Grand Master in the North and East Riding of Yorkshire from 1874 to 1923. He was also an enthusiastic sportsman, and was Master of the Zetland Hunt for thirty-five years.

He owned 68,000 acres, with 11,000 in the North Riding of Yorkshire, 29,000 acres in Orkney and 13,000 acres in Shetland.

==Marriage and children==
Lord Zetland married Lady Lilian Selina Elizabeth Lumley (1851 - 24 December 1943), daughter of Richard Lumley, 9th Earl of Scarbrough, on 3 August 1871. They had five children:

* Lady Hilda Mary Dundas (24 November 1872 - 19 May 1957), married Charles Henry FitzRoy, 4th Baron Southampton on 9 July 1892.
* Thomas Dundas, Lord Dundas (19 January 1874 - 11 February 1874)
* Lawrence John Lumley Dundas, 2nd Marquess of Zetland (11 June 1876 - 6 February 1961)
* Lady Maud Frederica Elizabeth Dundas (9 July 1877 - 15 March 1967), married William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 7th Earl Fitzwilliam on 24 June 1896.
* Lord George Heneage Lawrence Dundas (1 July 1882 - 30 September 1968), married Iris Winifred Hanley on 23 December 1905.

==Death==
Lord Zetland died in 1929 at the age of 84 at Aske Hall, Yorkshire and was buried there. He was succeeded in the marquessate and other titles by his eldest surviving son Lawrence. The Dowager Marchioness of Zetland died on 24 December 1943.

<text>The Taylor rule is a monetary policy targeting rule. The rule was proposed in 1992 by American economist John B. Taylor for central banks to use to stabilize economic activity by appropriately setting short-term interest rates. The rule considers the federal funds rate, the price level and changes in real income. The Taylor rule computes the optimal federal funds rate based on the gap between the desired (targeted) inflation rate and the actual inflation rate; and the output gap between the actual and natural output level. According to Taylor, monetary policy is stabilizing when the nominal interest rate is higher/lower than the increase/decrease in inflation. Thus the Taylor rule prescribes a relatively high interest rate when actual inflation is higher than the inflation target.

In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee controls monetary policy. The committee attempts to achieve an average inflation rate of 2% (with an equal likelihood of higher or lower inflation). The main advantage of a general targeting rule is that a central bank gains the discretion to apply multiple means to achieve the set target.

The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve changed throughout the 20th century. Taylor and others evaluate the period between the 1960s and the 1970s as a period of poor monetary policy; the later years are typically characterized as stagflation. The inflation rate was high and increasing, while interest rates were kept low. Since the mid-1970s monetary targets have been used in many countries as a means to target inflation. However, in the 2000s the actual interest rate in advanced economies, notably in the US, was kept below the value suggested by the Taylor rule. 

The Taylor rule represents a rules-based approach to monetary policy, standing in contrast to discretionary policy where central bankers make decisions based on their judgment and interpretation of economic conditions. While the rule provides a systematic framework that can enhance policy predictability and transparency, critics argue that its simplified formula—focusing primarily on inflation and output—may not adequately capture important factors such as financial stability, exchange rates, or structural changes in the economy. This debate between rules and discretion remains central to discussions of monetary policy implementation.

==Equation==
According to Taylor&#x27;s original version of the rule, the real policy interest rate should respond to divergences of actual inflation rates from target inflation rates and of actual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from potential GDP:

:formula_1

In this equation, formula_2 is the target short-term nominal policy interest rate (e.g. the federal funds rate in the US, the Bank of England base rate in the UK), formula_3 is the rate of inflation as measured by the GDP deflator, formula_4 is the desired rate of inflation, formula_5 is the assumed natural/equilibrium interest rate, formula_6 is the actual GDP, and formula_7 is the potential output, as determined by a linear trend. formula_8 is the output gap, in percentage points.

Because of formula_9,
: formula_10
In this equation, both formula_11 and formula_12 should be positive (as a rough rule of thumb, Taylor&#x27;s 1993 paper proposed setting formula_13). That is, the rule produces a relatively high real interest rate (a &quot;tight&quot; monetary policy) when inflation is above its target or when output is above its full-employment level, in order to reduce inflationary pressure. It recommends a relatively low real interest rate (&quot;easy&quot; monetary policy) in the opposite situation, to stimulate output. Sometimes monetary policy goals may conflict, as in the case of stagflation, when inflation is above its target with a substantial output gap. In such a situation, a Taylor rule specifies the relative weights given to reducing inflation versus increasing output.

==Principle==
By specifying formula_14, the Taylor rule says that an increase in inflation by one percentage point should prompt the central bank to raise the nominal interest rate by more than one percentage point (specifically, by formula_15, the sum of the two coefficients on formula_16 in the equation). Since the real interest rate is (approximately) the nominal interest rate minus inflation, stipulating formula_14 implies that when inflation rises, the real interest rate should be increased. The idea that the nominal interest rate should be raised &quot;more than one-for-one&quot; to cool the economy when inflation increases (that is increasing the real interest rate) has been called the Taylor principle. The Taylor principle presumes a unique bounded equilibrium for inflation. If the Taylor principle is violated, then the inflation path may be unstable.

== History ==
The concept of a policy rule emerged as part of the discussion on whether monetary policy should be based on intuition/discretion. The discourse began at the beginning of the 19th century. The first formal debate forum was launched in the 1920s by the US House Committee on Banking and Currency. In the hearing on the so-called Strong bill, introduced in 1923 by Representative James G. Strong of Kansas, the conflict in the views on monetary policy clearly appeared. New York Fed Governor Benjamin Strong Jr. (no relation to Representative Strong), supported by Professors John R. Commons and Irving Fisher, was concerned about the Fed&#x27;s practices that attempted to ensure price stability. In his opinion, Federal Reserve policy regarding the price level could not guarantee long-term stability. After the death of Governor Strong in 1928, political debate on changing the Fed&#x27;s policy was suspended. The Fed had been dominated by Strong and his New York Reserve Bank.

After the Great Depression hit the country, policies came under debate. Irving Fisher opined, &quot;this depression was almost wholly preventable and that it would have been prevented if Governor Strong had lived, who was conducting open-market operations with a view of bringing about stability&quot;. Later on, monetarists such as Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz agreed that high inflation could be avoided if the Fed managed the quantity of money more consistently.

The economic downturn of the early 1960s in the United States occurred despite the Federal Reserve maintaining relatively high interest rates to defend the dollar under the Bretton Woods system. After the collapse of Bretton Woods in 1971, the Federal Reserve shifted its focus toward stimulating economic growth through expansionary monetary policy and lower interest rates. This accommodative policy stance, combined with supply shocks from oil price increases, contributed to the Great Inflation of the 1970s when annual inflation rates reached double digits.

Beginning in the mid-1970s, central banks increasingly adopted monetary targeting frameworks to combat inflation. During the Great Moderation from the mid-1980s through the early 2000s, major central banks including the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England generally followed policy approaches aligned with the Taylor rule, which provided a systematic framework for setting interest rates. This period was marked by low and stable inflation in most advanced economies. A significant shift in monetary policy frameworks began in 1990 when New Zealand pioneered explicit inflation targeting. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand underwent reforms that enhanced its independence and established price stability as its primary mandate. This approach was soon adopted by other central banks: the Bank of Canada implemented inflation targeting in 1991, followed by the central banks of Sweden, Finland, Australia, Spain, Israel, and Chile by 1994.

From the early 2000s onward, major central banks in advanced economies, particularly the Federal Reserve, maintained policy rates consistently below levels prescribed by the Taylor rule. This deviation reflected a new policy framework where central banks increasingly focused on financial stability while still operating under inflation-targeting mandates. Central banks adopted an asymmetric approach: they responded aggressively to financial market stress and economic downturns with substantial rate cuts, but were more gradual in raising rates during recoveries. This pattern became especially pronounced following shocks like the dot-com bubble burst, the 2008 financial crisis, and subsequent economic disruptions, leading to extended periods of accommodative monetary policy.

==Alternative versions==

While the Taylor principle has proven influential, debate remains about what else the rule should incorporate. According to some New Keynesian macroeconomic models, insofar as the central bank keeps inflation stable, the degree of fluctuation in output will be optimized (economists Olivier Blanchard and Jordi Gali call this property the &#x27;divine coincidence&#x27;). In this case, the central bank does not need to take fluctuations in the output gap into account when setting interest rates (that is, it may optimally set formula_18.)

Other economists proposed adding terms to the Taylor rule to take into account financial conditions: for example, the interest rate might be raised when stock prices, housing prices, or interest rate spreads increase. Taylor offered a modified rule in 1999: that specified formula_19.

== Alternative theories ==
The solvency rule was presented by Emiliano Brancaccio after the 2008 financial crisis. The banker follows a rule aimed at controlling the economy&#x27;s solvency . The inflation target and output gap are neglected, while the interest rate is conditional upon the solvency of workers and firms. The solvency rule was presented more as a benchmark than a mechanistic formula.

The McCallum rule was offered by economist Bennett T. McCallum at the end of the 20th century. It targets the nominal gross domestic product. He proposed that the Fed stabilize nominal GDP. The McCallum rule uses precise financial data. Thus, it can overcome the problem of unobservable variables.

Market monetarism extended the idea of NGDP targeting to include level targeting (targeting a specific amount of growth per time period, and accelerating/decelerating growth to compensate for prior periods of weakness/strength). It also introduced the concept of targeting the forecast, such that policy is set to achieve the goal rather than merely to lean in one direction or the other. One proposed mechanism for assessing the impact of policy was to establish an NGDP futures market and use it to draw upon the insights of that market to direct policy.

==Empirical relevance==
Although the Federal Reserve does not follow the Taylor rule, many analysts have argued that it provides a fairly accurate explanation of US monetary policy under Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan and other developed economies. This observation has been cited by Clarida, Galí, and Gertler as a reason why inflation had remained under control and the economy had been relatively stable in most developed countries from the 1980s through the 2000s. However, according to Taylor, the rule was not followed in part of the 2000s, possibly inflating the housing bubble. Some research has reported that households form expectations about the future path of interest rates, inflation, and unemployment in a way that is consistent with Taylor-type rules. Other show that monetary policy rule estimations may differ under limited information, involving different considerations in terms of central bank objectives and on the monetary policy rule types.

== Limitations ==
The Taylor rule is debated in the discourse of the rules vs. discretion. Limitations of the Taylor rule include.

* The 4-month period typically used is not accurate for tracking price changes and is too long for setting interest rates. 
* The formula incorporates unobservable parameters that can be easily misevaluated. For example, the output gap cannot be precisely estimated.
* Forecasted variables such as the inflation and output gaps, are not accurate, depending on different scenarios of economic development.
* Difficult to assess the state of the economy early enough to adjust policy.
* The discretionary optimization that leads to stabilization bias and a lack of history dependence.
* The rule does not consider financial parameters. 
* The rule does not consider other policy instruments such as reserve funds adjustment or balance sheet policies.
* The relationship between the interest rate and aggregate demand.

Taylor highlighted that the rule should not be followed blindly: &quot;…There will be episodes where monetary policy will need to be adjusted to deal with special factors.&quot;

==Criticisms==
Athanasios Orphanides (2003) claimed that the Taylor rule can mislead policymakers who face real-time data. He claimed that the Taylor rule matches the US funds rate less perfectly when accounting for informational limitations and that an activist policy following the Taylor rule would have resulted in inferior macroeconomic performance during the 1970s.

In 2015, &quot;Bond King&quot; Bill Gross said the Taylor rule &quot;must now be discarded into the trash bin of history&quot;, in light of tepid GDP growth in the years after 2009. Gross believed that low interest rates were not the cure for decreased growth, but the source of the problem.

<text>The is a fictional line of &quot;Mobile Suits&quot; or mecha (human-piloted giant robots) from &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, part of the fictional universe of the Universal Century, where they are the Principality of Zeon&#x27;s most commonly fielded Mobile Suits. The most widely known model is the MS-06 Zaku II series. It is redesigned by Kunio Okawara based upon the earlier draft by the series director Yoshiyuki Tomino, in which only the name was kept. The Zaku II has seen various redesigns and variants for hundreds of pieces of merchandise, and the Japanese post office has two stamps with Zaku IIs on them. The Zaku&#x27;s aesthetic can be seen in more symbolic homages in the Gundam mythos, such as the GINN and ZAKU Warrior from &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;, the Busshi from &quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot;, and the Jenice from &quot;After War Gundam X&quot;.

After the original show&#x27;s run, Okawara and other designers created several variants of the Zaku. Many of these modified configurations never appeared in animation, but they are official Mobile Suit variations, appearing instead in plastic model form and various Gundam video games. The MS-06 Zaku II is still a major force in Gundam, with almost every new side story in the Universal Century adding a new variant to the basic frame.

==Concept and development==

The original concept of the Zaku was a disposable underling, with its name derived from the sound of a huge man (or many soldiers) marching and the Japanese term (referring to mediocre-quality fish meat considered unsuitable for fine dining, also signifying expendable grunts).

The Zaku later became better known as a common military machine. While in previous manga and anime giant robots tended to be the tools of protagonists or villains (often in a monster of the week format), the Zaku was portrayed as another weapon, such as a tank or fighter plane, assigned to pilots.

The Zaku is the first mobile suit to feature its parts (a damaged head) and is shown in three of the four box arts in the 1/35 U.C. Hard Graph line of plastic models made by Bandai, which resemble actual battlefields. This militaristic development started with the release of Gundam series models in 1980, when military modellers at that time took a liking to placing 1/144 scale Zaku model when placed next to World War I and World War II 1/144 models, because they liked the visual appeal, and modellers started to build them like AFVs.

The popularity of the first batch of models spawned the &quot;Mobile Suit Variations,&quot; where the mecha designer Kunio Okawara started designing variant mobile suits that could perform different tasks or adapt to different combat zones (for example, a Zaku specialized for underwater operations).

The MS-06 Zaku II unit then became the unit with most variants (22 alone in the first MSV all having its model compared to titular machine RX-78-2 Gundam&#x27;s 3 variants). The Zaku also had redesigns and variants created by other mecha designers, like Katoki Hajime, who designed the MS-06F2 Zaku II Type F2 for &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory&quot; and redesigned the Zaku II Ground Type and Char&#x27;s Commander type Zaku for the MG (Master Grade) number 97 and 98 Zaku Ver. 2.0, Yutaka Izubuchi.

The design of the Zaku II influenced the later designs of the RMS-106 Hizack in &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; and AMX-011 Zaku III in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ&quot;. The RMS-116H Hobby Hizack, not a military-use but a personal entertainment suit, which appeared in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; was also influenced by the Zaku. Its descendants continue to appear even in manga, like the OMS-06RF RF Zaku used by the Mars Zeon faction in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam F90&quot;.

==Role in plot==
The Zaku II is the most common Zeon mobile suit at the show&#x27;s beginning. Although a threat to unskilled characters, the Zaku is ultimately cannon fodder that comes in plentiful numbers for the Gundam.

In the Gundam timeline, the Zaku appears as one of the series&#x27; first units created for battle. At the start of the One-Year War, the Zaku II was the mainstay of Zeon&#x27;s military but quickly became inferior to newer and more powerful mobile suits as the war progressed. By the later stages of the war, the Zaku II is antiquated. Because the Zaku II is the basic military unit of the Zeon forces and it is a mass-production mobile suit, many units are left by the war&#x27;s end. These suits survive only to be destroyed en-masse to show the power of the newer models.

By the time of Gundam Unicorn, over fifteen years after the One Year War, Zaku II&#x27;s are shown as museum pieces. Upon seeing a display model of an old Zaku II, some characters remark upon how outdated it is. In contrast, others highlight its historical significance as an early example of widely mass-produced Mobile Suits.

===Other Gundam series===
The Zaku II design has also been included in storylines outside of the Universal Century, in the Cosmic Era series of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; where the director Mitsuo Fukuda requested the mecha designer Kunio Okawara to add his Zaku into the story. The ZAKU (ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity) Warrior designed became a high-end model in the plot. The ZAKU Phantom is a commander unit. The Zaku series of Mobile Suits also appears in the CC Era of Turn A Gundam as the MS-06 Borjarnon and MS-05 Borjarnon Gavane Gooney Custom, which are excavated MS-06F Zaku II&#x27;s and a slightly modified MS-05B Zaku I, respectively.

==Naming history==
This mobile suit&#x27;s original name was &quot;Zaku&quot;. In the non-official publication &quot;Gundam Century&quot; (which was later endorsed by Bandai as a semi-official guidebook), it was named the Zaku II to separate it from the MS-05 Zaku I (initially referred to simply as &quot;Old Zaku&quot; in the original series). The name was then officially endorsed, and all subsequent publications by either Sunrise or Bandai were referred to as Zaku II.

==Variations==
The variants of the Zaku started the later militaristic variation boom of the Universal Century Gundam series, with many units having their own variant designs. Most of these units can be classified by the code given to it. There are Type A, B, C, D, E, E-3, F, F2, Fs, FZ, G, H, J, K, M, R-1, R-1A, R-2, RD-4, S, T, V, W, Z and various colour scheme featuring different pilots&#x27; colouring like World War I flying aces. Also, an official parody version called Saku is featured in a few games and manga.

===Saku===
First appeared online as a fan parody, later officially in the &quot;Gundam Ace&quot; magazine. The unit was a parody of the original Zaku II, but is much cheaper and was mass-produced in a much greater number than the original Zaku II. Its head has the katakana sign &quot;Zi&quot;, the original word for &quot;Zeon&quot;. It was a single pill-shaped body and head with a drawn mono-eye, with rope-like limbs and a &quot;mouth&quot; like an octopus. A red &quot;Char Custom&quot; version saku with a horn (antenna) is the leader of a large squad of green saku, and unknown named horned blue ones are a parody of the MS-07 Gouf.

===MS-06F Zaku II===

First appearing in Mobile Suit Gundam, the Zaku II Type F is by far the most common variant of the Zaku II seen in the One Year War. It saw action both on Earth and in space. Overall, more than 3000 units are known to have been manufactured and deployed during the war.

===MS-06F2 Zaku II Type F2===

First appeared in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory&quot;, design by Hajime Katoki. Near the end of the One Year War, the Zeonic Company introduced an upgraded version of the MS-06F Zaku II, called MS-06F2 or Type F2. This upgraded model featured improved armor around the cockpit and a new Minovsky fusion reactor approximately 4% more powerful than the regular F-type&#x27;s. It was also lighter than the previous model, making it more fuel efficient and giving it a longer flight time and overall improved performance. After the One Year War, F2s were still in use. Some were retained by Zeon remnants and units captured by the Federation, which were usually used as aggressor units in squadrons conducting pilot training and mobile suit field testing.

===MS-06FZ Zaku II Last Mass Production Type (Zaku Kai)===

First appeared in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket&quot;, designed by Yutaka Izubuchi. Developed very late during the One Year War as part of the &quot;United Maintenance Plan,&quot; the MS-06FZ Zaku II Kai () was an improved and redesigned version of the Zaku II. The United Maintenance Plan was an effort by the Zeon military to simplify the production of their different types of mobile suits by standardizing parts and systems where possible.

Due to the MS-06FZ Zaku II Kai&#x27;s late introduction into the One Year War, only a handful of the units were produced. Few, if any, of the mobile suits survived the war. Originally, the OVA staff for Gundam 0080 intended for the FZ to be a Retcon Revision to the Zaku II. The Toy arm of Bandai came up with a separate backstory in order to keep selling both the 1979 and the new Zaku as model kits. The picture book MS Era illustrated by the same team still depicts the original concept.

===MS-06S Zaku II Commander Type===

Design by Kunio Okawara, the MS-06S Zaku II Commander Type (also known as the Zaku II Custom in some sources) looks very similar to the normal Zaku: so much so that the Earth Federation can generally only tell the difference from color schemes most pilots apply to their units and the increased performance of this version.

The S-Type Zaku II features a squad-leader &quot;horn&quot; that is mounted on the head of the Zaku II, which is used to distinguish squad leaders or higher-ranking pilots from other squad members or lower-ranking pilots. It also featured a more powerful fusion reactor. In turn, the S-Type Zaku II had greater thrust and acceleration. This allowed them to move at speeds 1/3 faster than an average Zaku II (in the original TV series, it was stated to be three times faster, but this was retconned in the movie trilogy to the more reasonable figure). This made it incredibly dangerous in the hands of the ace pilots it was handed out to, such as the &quot;Red Comet&quot; Char Aznable, who sank five warships during the Battle of Loum during the One Year War and whose mobile suit was painted in a fade tonality of red and pink.

===Land Type variations===

====MS-06J Zaku II Ground Type====
Appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations, designed by Kunio Okawara. The J-Type Zaku II was explicitly built for terrestrial operations and thus lacked space-specific equipment, greatly reducing its overall mass and cost. It also featured a slightly more powerful reactor to assist in its mobility under the full-gravity conditions of Earth. Compared to the F-type Zaku, the J-type was better insulated against its environment, and could be used in brief underwater operations. Its weapons were the same as its spaceborne counterpart, though a few weapons, such as the 175mm Magella Top gun were used only by the land types.

=====JC Subtype=====
Appears in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team&quot;, designed by Kunio Okawara. The land-battle Zakus appearing in the 08th MS Team anime were portrayed differently than in other anime: they were redesigned similarly to the Master Grade Zaku model kits that had been recently released, though with a few differences. Originally, the Zakus in 08th MS Team were identified as J-types, but recently this designation was retconned to MS-06Jc. The description of the JC-type Zaku on the official 08th MS Team website describes it as being similar to the J-type Zaku, but with features seen in the 08th MS Team anime, such as the redesigned cockpit and the spiked shield seen in the show&#x27;s opening.

====MS-06V Zaku Tank====
First appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations and later got animated in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, designed by Kunio Okawara. A worker variant appears in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team&quot;, created by Kimitoshi Yamane. As the One Year War dragged on, the Zeon forces desperately needed replacement parts for their mobile suits and other weapons. Forced to salvage whatever they could, inoperable machines were often disassembled for replacement parts. New unit designs cobbled together from whatever was available to get more combat units to the field. One of the most common variations was the MS-06V Zaku Tank, created from mounting a Zaku torso, head and arms on the drive base of a Magella attack tank. These units were prized by field commanders starved for replacement mobile suits and were used for both construction and combat.

===Reconnaissance Type variations===

The reconnaissance models were said to be used to team up with other mobile suits to launch skirmish attacks on enemies and determine by the countering numbers how many forces the enemy had in the area.

====MS-06E Zaku Reconnaissance Type====
First appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations and later got animated in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, design by Kunio Okawara. The MS-06E Zaku Reconnaissance Type, or just Zaku Recon Type for short, was designed for scouting and reconnaissance missions. These Zaku Recon Types, or E-Types, mounted specialized camera guns and sensor systems.

====MS-06E-3 Zaku Flipper====
First appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations, design by Kunio Okawara. A handful of the one hundred or so MS-06E Zaku Reconnaissance Types built during the One Year War were further upgraded into the MS-06E-3 Zaku Flipper. The Zaku Flipper was designed to play the role of a reconnaissance and scouting unit. It got its name from the creator because instead of a standard mono-eye head, its head is three-eyed with two large fins (flips) next to it as high-powered radar that can even penetrate Minovsky particle.

===MS-11 Action Zaku===
It first appeared as part of Mobile Suit Variations and later got animated in &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;, designed by Kunio Okawara. The MS-11 Action Zaku, often referred to as Act Zaku for short, is a Principality of Zeon prototype mobile suit based on the MS-06 Zaku II.

However, the Act Zaku was introduced too late for the Principality of Zeon. When the Earth Federation Forces captured the Pezun asteroid, they obtained the designs for the Action Zaku, and the concept of magnetic joint coating. The Earth Federation would put the Act Zaku into production for their use after the One Year War.

===Worker Type variations===
====MS-06F (MS-06H) Zaku Minelayer====
First appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations, designed by Kunio Okawara. The Zaku Minelayer is a standard &quot;MS-06F Zaku II&quot; equipped with a different style backpack. With this new backpack, the Zaku II is adapted to be a mine-laying unit. The new backpack houses several drums filled with space mines, with twelve mines packed into every drum. The backpack also has a few additional maneuvering thrusters and carries five times the fuel of a standard Zaku II. However, the Zaku Minelayer requires a particular loading area on a Musai-Class Light Cruiser to reload, launch, or land.

====MS-06W Worker Zaku====
First appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations, designed by Kunio Okawara. The Worker Zaku was a variant of the traditional Zaku design designed exclusively for labour. The unit&#x27;s cockpit was modified and constructed from the cockpit of a standard construction vehicle, allowing someone without military training to pilot the suit. The suits were fielded in West Asia until the production was moved towards the MS-06V, which used most of the same parts as the MS-06W.

===Psycommu Test Type Variations===

====MS-06Z (MS-06Z-3) Psycommu Test Type Zaku II====
First appear as part of Mobile Suit Variations, design by Kunio Okawara. The MS-06Z Psycommu Test Type Zaku II was the final Zaku variant developed under the MS-16X &quot;Bishop&quot; plan. Three test units were created, but the plan was halted due to a fatal flaw. The suit&#x27;s incredibly high energy consumption meant they could only fight for 10 minutes. The wire-guided forearms with beam cannons mounted in each of the fingers were almost identical to those later implemented in the MSN-02 Zeong. Additionally, the suit&#x27;s unique weaponry, psycomm system, and additional apogee thrusters brought the price of the suit up to the equivalent of several Zaku IIs.

===Post-war Insurgent variations===
====MS-21C Dra-C====

First appeared in the anime OVA Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory, designed by Mika Akitaka. After the end of the One Year War many of the Zeon remnants that refused to let the war end in anything less than victory retreated from the Earth Sphere and went into hiding. While in exile these renegade fleets slowly built up their forces, plotting to renew their conflict against the Earth Federation.

There were little supplies available to the Zeon remnants, so to build up their forces, the Dra-C was built from salvaged parts and mobile suit components (notably the torsos and arms of Zaku II F2s). This new machine is a space-only, high-speed interceptor Mobile Suit. Its standard armaments were light; most units were fielded with a 40mm vulcan gun and a beam saber-equipped shield on the left arm, though some have been shown with larger beam gatling guns. The Delaz Fleet remnants notably used this mobile suit during the Delaz Conflict of 0083, and some would continue to see some use at least another thirteen years afterward, in the hands of the Axis Fleet during both the Gryps Conflict of 0087–0088, and by the Sleeves in 0096.

As a retcon, the Dra-C appears as part of the Axis fleet in a dark-gray color scheme in the third Zeta Gundam film, and a pink color scheme with a gatling gun in episode 3 of &quot;Gundam Unicorn&quot;.

====MS-06F (Stutzer version)====
Appear in &#x27; photonovel, design by Kenki Fujioka. After the One Year War, the remnants of the Zeon forces upgraded their Zaku II units to this MS-06F Zaku II &quot;Stutzer&quot; configuration to counter the Titans&#x27; new machines, as Zeon no longer had any production capabilities for any new mobile suit designs. The Zaku II &quot;Stutzer&quot; was enhanced with winch units, which were able to launch wire-guided arm parts that could entangle enemy machines with wire, or throw hand grenades at them while the mobile suit itself remained hidden. Additionally, the Stutzer mounted the MS-14A Gelgoog&#x27;s beam rifle, powered by an auxiliary generator on its back.

===Novel version===
In the Mobile Suit Gundam Novel by Yoshiyuki Tomino, Zaku fingers contain Laser Touch to burn its way through obstructions, and its boosters can bring it to jump to a height of 800m.

===Descendants of the Zaku II series===
Although the original Zaku II was obsolete by the end of Zeon&#x27;s war for independence, its design was frequently revisited in following conflicts; for instance, the RMS-106 Hi-Zack (a hybrid between Zeon&#x27;s Zaku and Federation&#x27;s GM) of the Gryps Conflict, the AMX-011 Zaku III of the first Neo Zeon movement, (to a lesser extent) the AMS-119 Geara Doga of the second Neo Zeon movement, the AMS-129 Geara Zulu of the third Neo Zeon movement, and the OMS-06RF RF Zaku of the Mars Zeon Rebellion.

==Popular culture==

===Modeling competition===
There is an &quot;Ore Zaku&quot; (&quot;My Zaku&quot;) competition held by Hobby Japan every year, where modellers can only use Zaku models to enter. 

===Parts collection===
Merchandise like shoulder armour and antenna (horn) of the Zaku are available and a new series of products by Banpresto called &quot;Parts Collection&quot; for UFO catchers features four parts of the Zaku, a shoulder spike armor piece that is a radio, a body as a toolbox, shoulder shield as a clock and head as a light. The four parts can be combined to form a roughly 1/35 scale Zaku. Each part has 3 different colors, and thus users can build different variants.

===Forklift===
The two forklift trucks used in the Bandai Hobby Centre in Shizuoka are named &quot;MS-06 Zaku&quot; and &quot;MS-06S Zaku Char&#x27;s Custom&quot; and painted in green and red respectively with a mono-eye in the front panel of the truck.

===Stamps===
The Japanese post office released two stamps with a Zaku II on it, one with a Zaku as the background and Gundam in the foreground and one featuring Char&#x27;s Custom Zaku II.

===Razor blades===
In addition to the traditional modeling kits, the Kai Razor company has made a Char&#x27;s custom Zaku II razor blade.

===Cell phone===
Sharp have released (through Softbank Japan) a 913SH G Type-Char cell phone with an MS-06S Zaku II Commander Type (Char&#x27;s custom) head as the battery charging compartment. The red Zeon symbol in the front cover of the cell phone will serve as the eye of the Zaku when placed inside.

== Reception ==
The Zaku design has been described as &quot;one of the most beloved and iconic mecha designs from the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise&quot;.

<text>Cloncurry is a rural town and locality in the Shire of Cloncurry, Queensland, Australia. It is informally known by local people as The Curry. Cloncurry is the administrative centre of the Shire of Cloncurry.

Cloncurry is known as the &quot;Friendly Heart of the Great North West&quot; and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2017. Cloncurry was recognised for its liveability, winning the Queensland&#x27;s Friendliest Town award twice by environmental movement Keep Queensland Beautiful, first in 2013 and again in 2018.

In the , the locality of Cloncurry had a population of 3,167 people.

== Geography ==
Cloncurry is situated in the north-west of Queensland, 770 kilometres west of the city of Townsville via the Flinders Highway. The town lies adjacent to the Cloncurry River.The Flinders Highway enters from the east and the Barkly Highway exits to the west. The Landsborough Highway enters from the south-east and the Burke Developmental Road exits to the north.
The Cloncurry–Dajarra Road exits to the south from the Barkly Highway.

Cattle grazing is the significant industry in the region, and a large sale yards is located in the town.

The town has one of the richest geological layers in the world with copper (and gold) mining being core industries since 1867.

Open cut mining has impacted the landscape and the nearby former mine-site Mary Kathleen is a tourist attraction.

== History ==
The Aboriginal traditional owners of Cloncurry are the Mitakoodi people (pronounced Mita-koo-dee). In August 2024, the Mitakoodi and Mayi people were formally acknowledged and officially obtained native title determination. The region of Cloncurry is traditionally known as Pimurra and the Mitakoodi people were known as the River people. 

The first Europeans to traverse these tribal lands of peoples such as the Maithakari and the Wanamara, were Burke and Wills on their epic, and ultimately fatal, transcontinental expedition. The Cloncurry River was named by Burke after Lady Elizabeth Cloncurry, his cousin, with the town eventually taking its name from the river.

Ernest Henry discovered copper in the area in 1867, and the town sprang up to service the Great Australia Mine to the south. Roger Sheaffe established the first pastoral run in the Cloncurry district - &quot;Fort Constantine&quot;. Gold was discovered at Top Camp. 

The town was surveyed in 1876. Cloncurry was proclaimed a town in 1884.

Cloncurry Provisional School opened on 19 March 1884. In 1894, it became Cloncurry State School.
&quot;The Cloncurry Advocate&quot; was a newspaper published in Cloncurry between 1889 and 1953.

Queensland&#x27;s Northern Line railway reached Cloncurry in December 1907 and was officially opened the next year.

St Joseph&#x27;s School opened on 29 October 1909 by the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart.

In 1914, a fire broke out in the town resulting in the destruction of the Post Office, the hotel, eleven shops, two store-rooms and a cottage. The telegraph office was saved by employees who kept the office damp and protected with wet blankets. One man died in the blaze which cost an estimated £15,000.

From 1915 to 1931, the Australian Inland Mission (part of the Presbyterian Church) operated its North West Patrol in Cloncurry which provided religious services to people in remote areas by driving through the Outback; the service later operated from Mount Isa. A similar service, the Federal Methodist Inland Mission Patrol commenced was established in 1928 at its Gulf Mission Base in Camooweal. The amalgamation of the Presbyterian, Methodist and Congregational churches in 1977 to form the Uniting Church in Australia intended to combine these outback services, creating a huge North West Patrol area to be covered which could not be achieved by road transport, so the Cloncurry congregation purchased an aircraft in 1976 to provide the patrol service out of Cloncurry by air wherever possible, using road travel only to access places that did not have suitable airstrips. In the early 1990s the service was renamed the McKay Patrol to honour Reverend Fred McKay, an early patrol padre who had been involved in establishing the Royal Flying Doctor Service.

During World War II, Cloncurry was the location of RAAF No.23 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot (IAFD), completed in 1942 and closed on 14 August 1944. Usually consisting of 4 tanks, 31 fuel depots were built across Australia for the storage and supply of aircraft fuel for the RAAF and the US Army Air Forces at a total cost of £900,000 ($1,800,000).

The discovery of uranium at Mary Kathleen brought wealth to the community in the 1950s. Until the development of Mount Isa in the 1960s, Cloncurry was the administrative centre of the region.

The first-ever flight of the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia took place from Cloncurry on 15 May 1928, using a de Havilland DH.50 aircraft hired from the then small airline, Qantas. A Royal Flying Doctor Service museum is situated in the town.

The Cloncurry Bob McDonald Library opened in 2012.

It was announced on 11 February 2021 that Cloncurry had been chosen as the production location of the 2021 edition of Network 10&#x27;s reality game show &quot;Australian Survivor&quot;. The domestic location resulted from concerns regarding international travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was filmed in Cloncurry from 22 April to 8 June 2021, with the season airing on 18 July 2021.

Until the 1990s, Cloncurry was widely regarded as holding the record for the highest temperature recorded in Australia at on 16 January 1889. Investigations published in 1997 revealed that this temperature was measured in an improvised screen made from a beer crate and that it equated to under standard conditions. The highest temperature ever recorded at Cloncurry&#x27;s current weather station is , well short of the disputed 1889 temperature record. The average annual rainfall is , almost all of which falls In the months of December to March.

Because of the area&#x27;s extreme solar conditions, Cloncurry was expected to become Australia&#x27;s first solar-powered town. However the planned 10MW Thermal solar plant was scrapped due to light pollution concerns and a 2.128MW flat panel photovoltaic solar farm was to be built in its place. However, the Queensland Government withdrew financial support for the solar farm in May 2012.

<doc id="607599" wikidata="Q4247435" url="?curid=607599" title="Francis Cowper, 7th Earl Cowper">
<text>Francis Thomas de Grey Cowper, 7th Earl Cowper (11 June 1834 – 18 July 1905), known as Viscount Fordwich from 1837 to 1856, was a British Liberal politician. He was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1880 to 1882.

Overwhelmingly by inheritance he was rendered a sterling millionaire, a threshold reached by his own death estate which is estimated to apply to seven other British residents per year, only, in 1905.

==Background==
Cowper (pronounced &quot;Cooper&quot;) was the eldest son of George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper, by his wife Anne de Grey, 7th holder of the barony of Lucas of Crudwell, daughter of Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey. He was educated at Harrow School and the University of Oxford.

He was commissioned a cornet in the Yorkshire Hussars on 19 February 1852. On 22 November 1855, his father appointed him a deputy lieutenant of Kent.

==Political career==
Cowper entered the House of Lords on his father&#x27;s death in 1856 and served under William Ewart Gladstone as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords) from 1871 to 1874 and as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1880 to 1882. He became a Knight of the Garter in 1865 and was admitted to the Privy Council in 1871.

==Other public positions==
Apart from his political career Cowper held the position of Lord Lieutenant of Bedfordshire between 1861 and 1905. He was also a Deputy Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire and Kent.

==Peerages==
In 1871, Cowper managed to obtain a reversal of the attainder of the Scottish lordship of Dingwall and the English barony of Butler, which had been under attainder since 1715, and he became the 4th Lord Dingwall and the 3rd Baron Butler as well. In 1880, he succeeded his mother as 8th Baron Lucas.

==Relative wealth==
He came to own more than £1M of assets which Sir Leo Chiozza Money, an analyst of the rich of the era, estimated was true of only eight British people who died &quot;in an average year&quot;. In the US, a concentration of greater wealth existed: by the start of the World War I, Rockefeller had become the world&#x27;s first billionaire estimated (in somewhat cheaper US dollars), in the year he died.

He owned almost 38,000 acres.

==Family==
Lord Cowper married Lady Katrine Compton, daughter of William Compton, 4th Marquess of Northampton, in 1870. The marriage was childless. Cowper died in July 1905, aged 71. On his death, the baronetcy of Ratlingcourt, barony of Cowper, viscountcy of Fordwich and earldom of Cowper became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony of Lucas of Crudwell and the lordship of Dingwall by his nephew, Auberon.

His probate was resworn as per the official Calendar in 1905 at . Because Lord Cowper died childless and there were no other male-line descendants of the first Earl Cowper at the time of his death, his wealth stated mainly devolved to issue of his three married sisters (Lady Florence Herbert, Lady Adine Fane and Lady Amabel Kerr) 
*Florence&#x27;s son, Auberon, succeeded his uncle in the barony of Lucas of Crudwell and the lordship of Dingwall and also inherited the de Grey part of the Cowper estates including Wrest Park in Bedfordshire
*Adine&#x27;s daughter and only surviving child, Ethel, being Lord Cowper&#x27;s ward and favourite niece, inherited Panshanger, the Cowper&#x27;s main country seat in Hertfordshire
*Amabel&#x27;s descendants, who later succeeded as Marquesses of Lothian, inherited the Melbourne part of the Cowper estates including Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire and Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire

<text>Atibaia (or Estância de Atibaia) is a Brazilian municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The name is derived from an indigenous language called Tupi, and means &quot;healthy water river&quot;. Its name has changed over time, from the primitive Tupi word Tybaia, to Thibaia, Atubaia, Thibaya, and finally the city&#x27;s modern name, Atibaia.

Its strawberry crops are well known. These crops are cultivated mainly by Japanese descendants, since the city was a common Japanese immigrant center.

However, according to IBGE, the city is a conurbation with Bom Jesus dos Perdões, due to its proximity, which makes it the largest urban agglomeration in the Bragantina Region, with more than 180 thousand inhabitants.

==History==
In 1665, Jerônimo de Camargo and his expedition found a hill near a river named Tubaia (later called Atibaia River). Jerônimo de Camargo was a Bandeirante explorer. Their main objective was to search the interior lands of Brazil for rich mineral resources, such as gold, silver and emeralds in present-day state of Minas Gerais.

Camargo had his men build a chapel by the Tubaia river, which served as shelter to &quot;tropeiros&quot;—interior explorers on horse back—as well. The area was already occupied by Mateus Nunes da Siqueira, a priest who established contact with the Guarulhos tribe.

In June 1665, a farm was established and Father Mateus built a village with the help of enslaved natives. The village was called Atibaia.

Atibaia was a very important settlement at that time, because it was part of the route to Minas Gerais. São Paulo, probably the second most important city in Brazil at that time, was south of Atibaia, and the mining region north of it, locating Atibaia midway between those two important points.

As time passed, Atibaia became very important. Even the king of Portugal, D. João VI, visited the small town. Many famous artists lived in or visited Atibaia, such as Benedito Calixto, a famous church fresco painter. The city boasts two of his paintings. Alberto Santos-Dumont, the father of aviation, also visited Atibaia.

In April 1864, Atibaia was officially promoted to the status of city, due to the increased size of its population.

An important thoroughfare that divides the city is now called Avenida Jerônimo de Camargo.

The correct denomination for the native people is &quot;atibaiano&quot;; &quot;atibaiense&quot; is the nomination for those who live there but weren&#x27;t born in the city.

==Geography==
Atibaia is located 64 km north-east of São Paulo and 88 km south-east of Campinas two major urban centres in the region.

The city is located on a strategic highway crossing: the junction of Rodovia D. Pedro I and Rodovia Fernão Dias, having direct access to important cities, such as São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Campinas and Jacareí.

Atibaia has 478 square kilometers of area, 40% of this area is urbanized. The average altitude is 800 meters.

==Demographics==
According to the census of 2007, executed by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), Atibaia has approximately 119,166 inhabitants. However, 30,000 of these are people who own land or summer homes in the city, but do not reside there.
Atibaia have a Gini index average = 0.43 according to 2007 IBGE data.
There is not great industrial activity in Atibaia, and so there is a huge labour offer. According to the IBGE census, 65% of the population (95,342 inhabitants) is part of the economically active age group.

==Economy==
In 2005, The Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) loaned Atibaia R$2 million, to try to help it improve its city hall management. The funds will be invested in information technology; human resource qualification; specialized technical services; equipment to support tax auditing; and infrastructure.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

==Sites of interest==
There is a museum in Atibaia called the &quot;Museu João Batista Conti&quot;. Begun in 1954, it contains arms, armor, furniture, historical objects, coins and works of religious art along with important documents on the colonial and imperial periods in Brazil.

Atibaia also has an evangelic seminary of the Word of Life organization or as known in Portuguese &quot;Palavra da Vida&quot;. SBPV - Seminário Bíblico Palavra da Vida, founded in 1965, is located on the outskirts of Atibaia.

<doc id="607601" wikidata="Q3736892" url="?curid=607601" title="Rule of reason">
<text>The rule of reason is a legal doctrine used to interpret the Sherman Antitrust Act, one of the cornerstones of United States antitrust law. While some actions like price-fixing are considered illegal &quot;per se&quot;&quot;, &quot;other actions, such as possession of a monopoly, must be analyzed under the rule of reason and are only considered illegal when their effect is to unreasonably&quot; &quot;restrain trade. William Howard Taft, then Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, first developed the doctrine in a ruling on &quot;Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. v. United States, &quot;which was affirmed in 1899 by the Supreme Court. The doctrine also played a major role in the 1911 Supreme Court case &quot;Standard Oil Company of New Jersey v. United States.&quot;

== History ==

Upon its development some critics of &quot;Standard Oil&quot;, including the lone dissenter Justice John Marshall Harlan, argued that &quot;Standard Oil&quot; and its rule of reason were a departure from previous Sherman Act case law, which purportedly had interpreted the language of the Sherman Act to hold that all contracts restraining trade were prohibited, regardless of whether the restraint actually produced ill effects. These critics emphasized in particular the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association&quot;, 166 U.S. 290 (1897), which contains some language suggesting that a mere restriction on the autonomy of traders would suffice to establish that an agreement restrained trade within the meaning of the Act. 

Others, including William Howard Taft and Robert Bork, argued that the decision and the principle it announced was entirely consistent with earlier case law. These scholars argue that much language in &quot;Trans-Missouri Freight&quot; was dicta, and also emphasized the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;United States v. Joint Traffic Association&quot;, 171 U.S. 505 (1898), in which the Court announced that &quot;ordinary contracts and combinations&quot; did not offend the Sherman Act, because they restrained trade only &quot;indirectly&quot;. Indeed, in his 1912 book on antitrust law, Taft reported that no critic of &quot;Standard Oil&quot; could succeed in Taft&#x27;s challenge: to articulate one scenario in which the rule of reason would produce a result different from that produced under prior case law. In 1911, the Supreme Court announced &quot;United States v. American Tobacco Co.&quot;, 221 U.S. 106 (1911). That decision held that Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which bans monopolization, did not ban the mere possession of a monopoly but banned only the unreasonable acquisition or maintenance of monopoly. This reflects a long-standing view that one can have a monopoly just by having a superior product and that it violates no law to produce such a product.

In 1918, seven years later, the Court unanimously reaffirmed the rule of reason in &quot;Chicago Board of Trade v. United States&quot;. In an opinion written by Justice Louis Brandeis, the Court held that an agreement between rivals limiting rivalry on price after an exchange was closed was reasonable and thus did not violate the Sherman Act. The Court rejected a strict interpretation of the Sherman Act&#x27;s language: &quot;The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.&quot; The Court did so mostly because the agreement was regulatory rather than anticompetitive. 

The rule was narrowed in later cases that held that certain kinds of restraints, such as price fixing agreements, group boycotts, and geographical market divisions, were illegal per se. These decisions followed up on the suggestion in &quot;Standard Oil&quot; that courts can determine that certain restraints are unreasonable based simply upon the &quot;nature and character&quot; of the agreement.

More recently, the Supreme Court has removed a number of restraints from the category deemed unlawful &quot;per se&quot; and instead subjected them to fact-based rule of reason analysis. These include non-price vertical restraints in 1977&#x27;s &quot;Continental Television v. GTE Sylvania&quot;, maximum resale price maintenance agreements in 1997&#x27;s &quot;State Oil v. Khan&quot;, and minimum resale price maintenance agreements in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.&quot;

Moreover, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the conclusion in &quot;Standard Oil&quot; that analysis under the rule of reason should focus on the economic but not the social consequences of a restraint (&quot;National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States&quot;, 435 U.S. 679 (1978)). Further, the Court retained the &quot;per se&quot; rule against tying contracts but raised the threshold showing of market power that plaintiffs must make to satisfy the rule&#x27;s requirement of &quot;economic power&quot; (see &quot;Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde&quot;, 466 U.S. 2 (1985).

Several authors have worked on the creation of a &quot;structured rule of reason&quot; so as to avoid the flaw in terms of the legal certainty surrounding a pure rule of reason.

== In EU ==
A rule of reason does not exist in EU competition law (see e.g. T-11/08, T-112/99, T-49/02, T-491/07, T-208/13, etc.).

It does, however, exist in the EU&#x27;s substantive law, as developed in the European Court of Justice&#x27;s &quot;Cassis de Dijon&quot;-ruling.

In a letter written to party president Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mr. Shastri said he was not in a position to contest the Lok Sabha polls from Baghpat after the violence in which over 38 people were killed. The incidents of communal violence in Muzaffarnagar, Shamli and Baghpat were unfortunate, he said.

<text>The Bristol Buckmaster was an advanced British training aircraft operated by the Royal Air Force during the 1950s.

==Design and development==
By 1945, there was a serious gap in performance between the so-called advanced trainers in use – such as the Avro Anson, Airspeed Oxford, dual-control Bristol Blenheim and Lockheed Hudson – and the combat aircraft which the pilots would be expected to fly on graduation.

The Bristol company&#x27;s response to Air Ministry Specification T.13/43 was the Type 166 which was based on the Buckingham with a new wider front fuselage to allow side-by-side seating for an instructor and trainee and room for a radio operator. All armament and armour and military equipment was also removed.

The Buckmaster was a propeller-driven, twin-engine mid-wing aircraft. The retractable undercarriage was of conventional (tailwheel) configuration. The radial engines were equipped with four-blade propellers.

Two partly completed Buckinghams were converted as prototypes, the first flying on the 27 October 1944. Unused sets of Buckingham components were used to produce 110 aircraft which were delivered in 1945 and 1946.

==Operational history==
All production aircraft were intended to serve as trainers for the similar Brigand. It was considered to be the highest performance trainer used by the RAF when introduced. Blind flying instruction and instrument training could be undertaken, the normal crew complement being pilot, instructor and air signaller. The last Training Command Buckmasters served with the No. 238 OCU at Colerne into the mid-fifties; the transfer of one or two to Filton for experimental work marked its retirement in the mid-1950s.

<text>Rudé právo (Czech for Red Justice or The Red Right) was the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.

==History and profile==
&quot;Rudé právo&quot; was founded in 1920 when the party was splitting from the social democrats and their older daily &quot;Právo lidu&quot; (). During the 1920s and 1930s it was often censored and even temporarily stopped. In autumn 1938, the party was abolished and during the German occupation and World War II that came soon afterwards the newspaper became an underground mimeographed pamphlet. Following the end of the war Josef Frolík became the chief administrator of the paper. After the communist take-over in 1948 it became the leading newspaper in the country, the Czechoslovak equivalent of the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;Pravda&quot;, highly propagandistic and sometimes obedient to the government. Its Slovak equivalent in Slovakia was &quot;Pravda&quot;.

Following the Velvet Revolution, &quot;Rudé právo&quot; was privatised in 1989. In addition, some editors founded a new daily, &quot;Právo&quot;, unaffiliated with the party but taking advantage of the existing reader base.

<doc id="607611" wikidata="Q3284472" url="?curid=607611" title="Rangoli">
<text>Rangoli is an art form that originates from the Indian subcontinent, in which patterns are created on the floor or a tabletop using materials such as powdered limestone, red ochre, dry rice flour, coloured sand, quartz powder, flower petals, and coloured rocks. It is an everyday practice in many Hindu households; however, making it is mostly reserved for festivals and other important celebrations as it is time-consuming. Rangolis are usually made during Diwali or Tihar, Onam, Pongal, Ugadi and other Hindu festivals in the Indian subcontinent, and are most often made during Diwali. Designs are passed from one generation to the next, keeping both the art form and the tradition alive.

Rangoli have different names based on the state and culture. Rangoli hold a significant role in the everyday life of a Hindu household especially historically when the flooring of houses were untiled. They are usually made outside the threshold of the main entrance, in the early mornings after cleaning the area. Traditionally, the postures needed to make a rangoli are a kind of exercise for women to straighten their spines. The rangoli represents the happiness, positivity and liveliness of a household, and is intended to welcome Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and good luck. It is believed that a Hindu household without a clean entrance and rangoli is an abode of &quot;daridra&quot; (bad luck).

The purpose of rangoli is beyond decoration. Traditionally either powdered calcite and limestone or cereal powders are used for the basic design. The limestone is capable of preventing insects from entering the household, and the cereal powders attract insects and keep them from entering the household. Using cereal powders for rangoli is also believed as &quot;panch-mahabhoota Seva&quot; because insects and other dust microbes are fed. Design depictions may vary as they reflect traditions, folklore, and practices that are unique to each area. Rangoli are traditionally made by girls or women, although men and boys create them as well. In a Hindu household, basic rangoli is an everyday practice. The usage of colours and vibrant designs are showcased during occasions such as festivals, auspicious observances, marriage celebrations and other similar milestones and gatherings.

Rangoli designs can be simple geometric shapes, depictions of deities, or flower and petal shapes appropriate to the given celebrations. They can also be made with elaborate designs crafted by numerous people. The geometric designs may also represent powerful religious symbols, placed in and around household &quot;yagna&quot; shrines. Historically, basic designs were drawn around the cooking areas for the purpose of discouraging insects and pathogens. Synthetic colours are a modern variation. Other materials include red brick powder and even flowers and petals, as in the case of flower rangoli.

Over time, imagination and innovative ideas in rangoli art have also been incorporated. Rangoli have been commercially developed in places such as five star hotels. Its traditional charm, artistry and importance continue today.

==Etymology==
From Sanskrit word which means &quot;colour&quot;. &quot;Rangoli&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘&quot;rangavalli’.&quot;

The various names for this art form and similar practices include:
* &quot;Raangoli&quot; (रांगोळी) in Maharashtra
* &quot;muggu&quot; (ముగ్గు) in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
* &quot;rangoli&quot;/&quot;rangole&quot; (ರಂಗೋಲಿ/ರಂಗೋಲೆ) in Karnataka
* kolam (கோலம்) in Tamil Nadu
* &quot;mandana&quot;/&quot;mandas&quot; (माँडना) in Rajasthan
* &quot;alpana&quot;/&quot;alpona&quot; (আল্পনা) in Bangladesh and West Bengal
* &quot;haripan&quot;/&quot;aripan&quot; (आरिपना) in Bihar
* &quot;muruja&quot; (ମୁରୁଜ) or &quot;jhoti&quot; (ଝୋଟି) or &quot;chita&quot; (ଚିତା) in Odisha
* &quot;chowkpurana&quot; (छोवकपुराणा) in Chhattisgarh
* &quot;chowkpujan&quot; (चौकपूजन) in Uttar Pradesh
* &quot;chowk poorana&quot; in Punjab
* &quot;pookkalam&quot; (പൂക്കളം) in Kerala
* &quot;Rangoli&quot;/&quot;sanskarbharti&quot;/&quot;bharti&quot; in Maharashtra
* &quot;saathiya&quot;/&quot;gahuli&quot; in Gujarat
* &quot;aipan&quot;/&quot;eipan&quot; (ऐपण) in Uttarakhand

==In different states==
In middle India, mainly in Chhattisgarh, Rangoli is called Chaook and is generally drawn at the entrance of a house or any other building. Powdered quartz, dried rice flour or other forms of white dust powder is used for drawing Chaooks. Although there are numerous traditional Chaook patterns, many more can be created depending on the creativity of the person who draws it. It is considered auspicious as it signifies showering of good luck and prosperity on the house and in the family. It is not drawn like a Bolka picture. Patterns are created based on certain systems. Generally, women get up early in the morning and clean the area just outside the entrance of their houses with cow dung, sprinkle the area with water and draw the Chaook. In Maharashtra and Karnataka, rangoli are drawn on the doors of homes so that evil forces attempting to enter are repelled.

During the festival of Onam in Kerala, flowers are laid down for each of the ten days of the celebration, the design growing larger and more complex every day. In Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, and many parts of Maharashtra, the rangoli or Kolam is drawn upon the ground or floor daily. The designs are geometric and symmetrical मूल्यतः shapes but the materials used are similar rangoli: powdered quartz, rice flour or slurry is used. In Rajasthan the Mandana are painted on walls. Mmandne, various festivals, major festivals and can be categorized based on seasons. Different shapes depending on the size of it also can be shared. Kumaon&#x27;s &quot;writing beat &#x27;or in a variety of plotting symbols Thapa, artistic designs, Bellbutoan is used. Alikhthap of society apart – separated by different groups – different icons and art media is used. In Odisha, the Murja is put at the aangan of every home in front of the Tulsi plant called &quot;Tulasi chahura&quot;. The rangoli patterns mostly are dedicated to Lord Krishna and Lord Jagannath. The Murja festival is observed during the auspicious month of Kartika ending on Kartika Purnima. In West Bengal, Alponas are created using rice flour. Alponas are similar to kolams and are created during major festvals that Bengalis celebrate like Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Saraswati Puja, Kojagori Lakshmi Puja and Jogodhatri Puja.

Shape, design and material can be influenced by regional traditions. A square grid is common in North India as is a hexagonal grid in South India; Onam Rangoli are typically circular. In North India, the colour is most often based on gypsum (chirodi), in South India on rice flour and Onam Rangoli are typically flower based. The rapid and widespread migration and mixing of people within India can be seen by the way these styles are now freely adopted and mixed across the country. It is also becoming common to see experimentation like sawdust-based floating rangoli, freeform designs, and exotic materials.

It is particularly notable that the Tamil version of the rangoli, the Kolam, prizes symmetry, complexity, precision, and intricacy rather than the flamboyance of rangoli found in North India. Many people find it enjoyable to try and figure out how such intricate designs are drawn with a grid, and hence, it allows the mind to be exercised.

==Elements==
===Colours and designs===

The rangoli&#x27;s most important element is being colourful. These are auspicious symbols that have a central role in the design. The designs are passed down from one generation to the next as they are made – and is required to make these symbols. Traditionally, each new generation learns the art and thus a family keeps the tradition intact. Some major symbols used in rangoli are the lotus flower and its leaves, mango, Tue vase, fish, different kind of birds like parrots, swans, and peacocks, human figures, and foliage. Rangoli is often made on special occasions like Diwali. Some special patterns for Diwali Rangoli are the Diya also called Deep, Ganesha, Lakshmi, flowers or birds of India. The patterns include the face of Hindu deities, geometric shapes peacock motifs, and round floral designs. Many of these motifs are traditional and are handed down by the previous generations. This makes rangoli a representation of India&#x27;s rich heritage and the fact that it is a land of festivals and colour. People celebrate rangoli with davali patterns.

===Materials===
The materials used to make the rangoli are easily found everywhere. Therefore, this art is prevalent in all homes, rich and poor. Normally the major ingredients used to make rangoli are: Pise rice solution, the dried powder made from leaves, colour, charcoal, burned soil, sawdust, and similar substances. Rangoli is also created using coloured powdered quartz, rice, dry flour, flower petals, turmeric (pasupu), vermillion (sindooram) and coloured sand.

===Background surface===
The background of rangoli uses a clear floor or wall or Llype is used. Rangoli can be made in a yard in the middle, corners, or as a bell is created around.

Dehri gateway is another tradition of making rangoli. God&#x27;s seat, depending on lamp, place of worship and sacrifice on the altar is a tradition of decorating rangoli.

=== Mandala rangoli ===

Mandala is a diagram, chart or geometric pattern that represents the cosmos metaphysically or symbolically, a time-microcosm of the universe, but was originally meant to represent wholeness and a model for the organizational structure of life itself, a cosmic diagram that shows the relation to the infinite and the world that extends beyond and within various minds and bodies. It also represents the spiritual journey, starting from outside to the inner core, through layers.

==Creation==
There are two primary ways to make a rangoli, dry and wet, referring to the materials used to create the outline and (if desired) fill that outline with colour. Using a white material like chalk, sand, paint or flour, the artist marks a centre-point on the ground and cardinal points around it, usually in a square, hexagon or circle depending on region and personal preference. Ramifying that initially-simple pattern creates what is often an intricate and beautiful design. Motifs from nature (leaves, petals, feathers) and geometric patterns are common. Less common but by no means rare are representational forms (like a peacock, icon or landscape). &quot;Readymade Rangoli&quot; patterns, often as stencils or stickers, are becoming common, making it easier to create detailed or precise designs.

Once the outline is complete, the artist may choose to illuminate it with colour, again using either wet or dry ingredients like paints, coloured rice-water, gypsum powder, coloured sand or dry pigments. The artist might also choose unprocessed materials like seeds, grains, spices, leaves or flower petals to achieve lifelike hues. Modern materials like crayons, dyes or dyed fabrics, acrylic paints and artificial colouring agents are also becoming common, allowing for brilliant and vibrant colour choices. A newer but less artificial method involves using cement coloured with marble powder. This rather precise method requires training, but beautiful portraits can be drawn in this medium.

==Religion==
In Sri Vaishnavism, it is said that Andal, one among the twelve Alvars, worshipped the deity Krishna, and was married to him in the month of Margaḻi. During this month, several unmarried women get up before dawn, and draw a rangoli to welcome the deity. Mentions of rangoli creation are also found in Hindu literature. There are also references of rangoli in legends such as Ramayana - at Sita&#x27;s wedding pavilion where there is a discussion about rangoli. The cultural development of rangoli in the south originated in the era of the Chola rulers.

<doc id="607612" wikidata="Q335513" url="?curid=607612" title="James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn">
<text>James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn (21 January 1811 – 31 October 1885), styled Viscount Hamilton from 1814 to 1818 and The Marquess of Abercorn from 1818 to 1868, was a Conservative statesman who twice served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

==Background and education==
Born into an Anglo-Irish (or rather Scottish) aristocratic family at Seymour Place, Mayfair, on 21 January 1811, Abercorn was the son of James, Viscount Hamilton, himself the eldest son of The 1st Marquess of Abercorn. His mother, Harriet, was the second daughter of The Hon. John Douglas, himself the son of The 14th Earl of Morton. His father died when Abercorn was only three. In 1818, aged seven, he succeeded his grandfather in his titles and estates. He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 2 July 1829.

==Political career==
Lord Abercorn was first appointed a deputy lieutenant of County Tyrone, where he had a family seat at Baronscourt. On 13 November 1844, Lord Abercorn was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Donegal. The next month, on 12 December 1844, he was made a Knight of the Garter at the relatively young age of 33.

Abercorn was appointed Groom of the Stole to Prince Albert on 8 February 1846, and shortly thereafter, on 25 February 1846, was made a Privy Counsellor. He served as Groom of the Stole until June 1859, and remained a prominent figure in the royal court for the next two decades. He received two honorary degrees during this period, becoming an LL.D. of Cambridge on 5 July 1847, a DCL of Oxford on 4 June 1856. From 11 April 1855 to 22 September 1860, he was Honorary Colonel of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Donegal Militia, and on 18 February 1860, was commissioned as a Captain in the newly raised London Scottish Rifle Volunteers.

On 6 July 1866, he was appointed Viceroy of Ireland, under the third ministry of Lord Derby. He retained the post after Derby resigned in February 1868 and Benjamin Disraeli took the reins of the ministry. On 10 August 1868, he was created Marquess of Hamilton and Duke of Abercorn in the Peerage of Ireland. Around this time, he received his third honorary degree, an LL.D. from Trinity College, Dublin. After Gladstone and the Liberals won the 1868 general election, Abercorn resigned the Lord-Lieutenancy on 14 December.

After the formation of the second Disraeli ministry, Abercorn was again appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland on 2 March 1874, and was also chosen Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Ireland, a post he held until his death. He resigned the Lord-Lieutenancy again on 6 December 1876, partly on account of his wife&#x27;s ill health.

Abercorn was Envoy-Extraordinary for the investiture of King Umberto I of Italy with the Order of the Garter on 2 March 1878. He was elected Chancellor of the University of Ireland in 1881, and died four years later at his home of Baronscourt, County Tyrone on 31 October 1885. He is buried in the cemetery at Baronscourt Parish Church, the traditional burial place of the Dukes of Abercorn and their families.

==Sporting interests==
Abercorn was the shooting tenant of Ewen Macpherson of Cluny at Loch Ericht and Benalder in the Central Highlands of Scotland. In 1836, William Mitchell (1756 - c.1839), one of Badenoch&#x27;s biggest farmers, was obliged to surrender his Benalder sheep walk to accommodatate the Marquess&#x27;s shooting interests. In 1839 Abercorn built a large shooting lodge at Ardverikie on the south side of Loch Laggan, where the painter Sir Edwin Landseer was one of the shooting guests.

==Family and children==
Abercorn married Lady Louisa, second daughter of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, in 1832. They had fourteen children, thirteen of whom survived infancy, among them seven daughters, all of whom were ordered to marry into the peerage and no one beneath the rank of an earl:

*Lady Harriet Georgiana Louisa Hamilton (1834–1913), married in 1855 to Thomas George Anson, 2nd Earl of Lichfield. They had eight sons and five daughters.
*Lady Beatrix Frances Hamilton (1835–1871), married in 1854 to George Frederick D&#x27;Arcy Lambton, 2nd Earl of Durham
*Lady Louisa Jane Hamilton (1836–1912), married in 1859 to William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch
*James Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Abercorn (1838–1913)
*Lady Katherine Elizabeth Hamilton (1840–1874), married in 1858 to William Henry Edgcumbe, 4th Earl of Mount Edgcumbe
*Lady Georgiana Susan Hamilton (1841–1913), married in 1882 to Edward Turnour, 5th Earl Winterton
*Lord Claud Hamilton (1843–1925)
*Lord George Hamilton (1845–1927)
*Lady Albertha Frances Anne Hamilton (1847–1932), married in 1869 to George Charles Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough. The marriage was annulled in 1883.
*Lord Ronald Douglas Hamilton (1849–1867)
*Lady Maud Evelyn Hamilton (1850–1932), married in 1869 to Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne
*Lord Cosmo Hamilton (1853–1853, on the same day)
*Lord Frederick Spencer Hamilton (1856–1928)
*Lord Ernest Hamilton (1858–1939)

Abercorn died in October 1885, aged 74, and was succeeded by his eldest son, James. The Duchess of Abercorn died in March 1905, aged 92.

<doc id="607618" wikidata="Q973475" url="?curid=607618" title="Dustin Diamond">
<text>Dustin Neil Diamond (January 7, 1977 – February 1, 2021) was an American actor and stand-up comedian. He is best known for portraying Samuel &quot;Screech&quot; Powers throughout the &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; franchise.

==Early life and family==
Diamond was born in San Jose, California, the son of Jaimee and Mark Diamond. His father taught digital electronics for a computer processing firm, and his mother was a computer operator for Pacific Bell. Diamond was Jewish and attended Zion Lutheran School.

==Career==
Diamond began acting as a child. He became known for playing Samuel &quot;Screech&quot; Powers on the television show &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, a role he played for close to thirteen years from its beginning as &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot; (1988–89) through its final incarnation, &quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot; (1994–2000). Continuing the series into college, &quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot; shows most of the cast transplanted into not only the same college, but also the same college dormitory, where Screech continued his typical misadventures. &quot;The College Years&quot; was canceled after one season. Diamond returned to Bayside High as Principal Belding&#x27;s assistant in &quot;The New Class&quot; episodes, remaining with the show until its cancellation.

===Appearances after &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;===
Diamond began doing stand-up comedy after the end of &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; and toured on and off after that. He was also featured on a number of game and reality shows including &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Boxing 2&quot;. Diamond also made several cameo appearances in films, including appearances in &quot;Made&quot; (2001) and &quot;Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star&quot; (2003).

In 2007, Diamond was a cast member of the fifth season of &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;. During his run on the show, he came into conflict with former &quot;American Idol&quot; finalist Kimberley Locke, country singer Cledus T. Judd, rapper Da Brat, the program&#x27;s host Ant, and the program&#x27;s trainer, former USMC sergeant Harvey Walden IV. During one episode, Diamond mentioned what may have happened if he were to challenge Ant to &quot;physical combat&quot; and after Harvey Walden defended Ant, Diamond subsequently said the same to him, causing Walden to lose his temper.

Following &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;, Diamond played roles as &quot;Alumnus Guy #1&quot; in &quot;American Pie Presents: The Book of Love&quot; (2009), in a supporting role in the sports comedy &quot;Tetherball: The Movie&quot; (2010), and as Bernardo, the castle guard, in the partially-animated science fiction comedy &quot;Hamlet A.D.D.&quot; (2014).

===Sex tape===
In 2006, Diamond directed and released his own celebrity sex tape, &quot;Screeched – Saved by the Smell&quot;. According to Melanie McFarland&#x27;s retelling of a press release, Diamond said the tape got out because he and a group of friends had a &quot;monthly gathering&quot; wherein they exchanged such tapes. Several years later, Diamond said in a &quot;&quot; interview on the Oprah Winfrey Network that he was not in the sex tape; rather, a stunt double had his likeness superimposed.

===&quot;Behind the Bell&quot;===
In 2009, Diamond published an inside story of the show&#x27;s cast and crew, from his point of view, titled &quot;Behind the Bell&quot;. The book paints an unflattering portrait of many of Diamond&#x27;s colleagues and their allegedly sordid backstage behavior. Some of these claims have been repudiated by Diamond&#x27;s colleagues and questioned by critics. Diamond later commented on the book&#x27;s content in a December 2013 appearance on an &quot;Oprah: Where Are They Now?&quot; segment on the OWN Network in which he stated that the book was ghost written by an author who simply interviewed him and compiled the book from his answers. He claimed that many parts of the book, such as allegations of teen sex and drug use, were fabricated from very minor statements he made during the interviews.

===Other work===
Diamond was also a musician and formed an alternative metal band called Salty The Pocketknife. Diamond played bass and wrote much of the music as well. Shortly after recording their first album, the band split up due to internal disagreements. Diamond also appeared on truTV&#x27;s &quot;The Smoking Gun Presents: World&#x27;s Dumbest...&quot; as a commentator.

He appeared as a host at the 12th annual Gathering of the Juggalos.

In August 2013, Diamond became a housemate on the twelfth series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in the UK. He became the fourth housemate to be evicted on Day 16.

Diamond was a spokesperson for the Rockford, Illinois-based insurance company Insurance King. In some Insurance King commercials he is featured in, he makes several references to &quot;Saved By the Bell&quot; (with logos in the commercial saying “Saved By the King”). In other commercials, he is shown to be pulled over, not caring about the already numerous tickets he has because he is “saved by the King!”, being in a Western style standoff, and being a terrible barber.

==Professional wrestling career==
Diamond was a fan of professional wrestling. He appeared at Memphis Championship Wrestling in April 2000. He was a part of a skit with The Kat where he was beaten up by Chip Diver, the Fabulous Rocker, and Dannie B.

On September 18, 2002, he appeared on an NWA-TNA&#x27;s Asylum weekly pay-per-view. Billed as Screech, he challenged TNA&#x27;s bellkeeper, Tiny the Bellkeeper, to a boxing match. Screech won by knockout in 42 seconds.

In 2008, Diamond was a contestant on &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Celebrity Championship Wrestling&quot;, broadcast on CMT.

Diamond was a special guest referee for a match at Celebrity Big Bang Wrestling, Mistress Devon James vs Susan Finkelstein on July 22, 2010.

On February 11, 2011, Diamond teamed with Jordan McEntrye and Knight Wagner, losing to MsChif, Marion Fontaine and Krotch in an intergender match at AAW in Merrionette Park, Illinois. On March 17, 2011, he teamed with Bushwhacker Luke, Izzy Slapawitz and Doink the Clown to beat Virgil, Ashley Sixx, Celine Jean and Sheena at TWE Rethinking Rumble in Vaughan, Ontario. He lost his final match in a tag during the main event of FTW Summer of Synn, in Ronkonkoma, New York, on July 7, 2012.

==Personal life==
In 2001, Diamond filed for bankruptcy in California. He moved to Port Washington, Wisconsin, in 2003. On June 13, 2006, he asked listeners of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; to visit his website and purchase a T-shirt, reading &quot;I paid $15.00 to save Screeech&#x27;s house&quot; (spelling &quot;Screech&quot; with an extra E for copyright reasons). He said he hoped to sell 30,000 shirts in order to raise $250,000 and avoid foreclosure on his house. Diamond moved to Florida in 2018, and put his house in Port Washington up for sale the following year.

He reportedly married longtime girlfriend Jennifer Misner in 2009, separated in 2013 and later divorced, although his death certificate lists him as having never married. They did not have any children.

On December 26, 2014, Diamond was arrested in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, for possession of a switchblade knife, which he was alleged to have pulled during a bar altercation in which a man was stabbed. Amanda Schutz, his fiancée, was found guilty of disorderly conduct and fined $500. On May 29, 2015, he was convicted of two misdemeanors: carrying a concealed weapon and disorderly conduct. He was cleared of the most serious charge, recklessly endangering public safety. On June 25, he was sentenced to four months in jail. He served three months and was released on probation. His probation agent later determined that he had violated his terms and he was arrested again in May 2016.

==Illness and death==
In early January 2021, Diamond was diagnosed with extensive stage four small cell carcinoma of the lungs. Despite completing one round of chemotherapy in Cape Coral, Florida, he died from the disease on February 1, 2021, at age 44.

=== NASCAR tribute ===
After Diamond&#x27;s death, Dan Block, the founder of Insurance King and close friend of Diamond, partnered with Josh Bilicki, driver of the #52 Rick Ware Racing Ford, to run a tribute car for Diamond in the 2021 Verizon 200 at the Brickyard.

<doc id="607621" wikidata="Q1398898" url="?curid=607621" title="USS Cavalla (SS-244)">
<text>USS &quot;Cavalla&quot; (SS/SSK/AGSS-244), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, is a submarine of the United States Navy named for a salt water fish, best known for sinking the Japanese aircraft carrier &quot;Shōkaku&quot;.

Her keel was laid down on 4 March 1943 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 14 November 1943 (sponsored by Mrs. M. Comstock), and commissioned on 29 February 1944, Lieutenant Commander (later Rear Admiral) Herman J. Kossler, USN, (class of 1934) in command.

==Operational history==
Departing New London 11 April 1944, &quot;Cavalla&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor 9 May, for voyage repairs and training. On 31 May 1944 the sub put to sea on active service for the first time.

===First patrol===
On her maiden patrol &quot;Cavalla&quot;, en route to her station in the eastern Philippines, made contact with a large Japanese task force on 17 June. &quot;Cavalla&quot; tracked the force for several hours, relaying information which contributed to the United States victory in the Battle of the Philippine Sea (commonly known as the &quot;Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;) on 19–20 June 1944. On 19 June, she caught the carrier &quot;Shōkaku&quot; recovering planes, and quickly fired a spread of five torpedoes, with four hits. &quot;Shōkaku&quot; sank at . After a severe depth charging by three destroyers, &quot;Cavalla&quot; escaped to continue her patrol, having suffered relatively minor damage by depth charges from the . The feat earned her a Presidential Unit Citation.

===Second patrol===
&quot;Cavalla&#x27;s&quot; second patrol took her to the Philippine Sea as a member of a wolfpack operating in support of the invasion of Peleliu 15 September 1944.

===Third patrol===
On 25 November 1944, during her third patrol, &quot;Cavalla&quot; encountered two Japanese destroyers and made a surface attack which destroyed the &quot;Shimotsuki&quot; at . The companion destroyer began depth charge attacks, while &quot;Cavalla&quot; evaded on the surface. Later in the same patrol, on 5 January 1945 &quot;Cavalla&quot; made a night surface attack on an enemy convoy and sank two converted net tenders (&quot;Kanko Maru&quot;, &quot;Shunsen Maru&quot;) at .

===Fourth and fifth patrols===
&quot;Cavalla&quot; cruised the South China and Java Seas on her fourth and fifth war patrols. Targets were few and far between, but she came to the aid of an ally on 21 May 1945. A month out on her fifth patrol, the submarine sighted , damaged by enemy depth charges and unable to submerge or make full speed. &quot;Cavalla&quot; stood by the damaged submarine and escorted her on the surface to Fremantle, arriving 27 May 1945.

===Sixth patrol===
&quot;Cavalla&quot; received the cease-fire order of 15 August while lifeguarding off Japan on her sixth war patrol. A few minutes later she was bombed by a Japanese plane that apparently had not yet received the same information or heard the &quot;Gyokuon-hōsō&quot; radio broadcast. She joined the fleet units entering Tokyo Bay 31 August, remained for the signing of the surrender on 2 September, then departed the next day for New London, arriving 6 October 1945. She was placed out of commission in reserve there 16 March 1946.

===Postwar===
Recommissioned 10 April 1951, &quot;Cavalla&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 8 and engaged in various fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off Nova Scotia. She was placed out of commission 3 September 1952 and entered Electric Boat Co. yard for conversion to a hunter-killer submarine (reclassified SSK-244, 18 February 1953). The SSK conversion included remodeling &quot;Cavalla&quot;″s bow with the addition of a curved housing for a BQR-4 sonar system. The conversion included removal of two bow torpedo tubes, along with remodeling the original conning tower and bridge into the sail visible today.

&quot;Cavalla&quot; was recommissioned 15 July 1953 and assigned to Submarine Squadron 10. Her new sonar made &quot;Cavalla&quot; valuable for experimentation, and she was transferred to Submarine Development Group 2 on 1 January 1954, to evaluate new weapons and equipment, and to participate in fleet exercises. She also cruised to European waters several times to take part in NATO exercises, and visited Norfolk, Va., for the International Naval Review (11–12 June 1957). On 15 August 1959, her classification reverted to SS-244.

In November, 1961, &quot;Cavalla&quot; was ordered to Puerto Rico and provided electrical power via umbilical connection to which had suffered a diesel generator failure while the nuclear reactor was shut down. &quot;Cavalla&quot; successfully assisted &quot;Thresher&quot;&#x27;s restart of her reactor. &quot;Thresher&quot; was lost during post-overhaul sea trials on 10 April 1963 during a deep dive.

==Fate==
&quot;Cavalla&quot; was reclassified an &quot;auxiliary submarine&quot;, AGSS-244, in July 1963. &quot;Cavalla&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Register on 30 December 1969.

On 21 January 1971, &quot;Cavalla&quot; was transferred to the Texas Submarine Veterans of World War II. She now resides at Galveston Naval Museum in Seawolf Park on Pelican Island, just north of Galveston, Texas. &quot;Cavalla&quot; has undergone an extensive restoration process (see photos, below), and is open for self-guided tours. Among the early benefactors was then President of the Texas United States Submarine Veterans of World War II, Paul Francis Stolpman, and the former Texas secretary of state George Strake, Jr.

<text>Christian Joseph Raab (born May 21, 1980), better known by his stage name Raab Himself, is an American television personality known as a former member of the CKY crew featured in the MTV series &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; and &quot;Jackass&quot;.

==Biography==
Raab was born in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. He attended West Chester East High School. The nickname &quot;Raab Himself&quot; was bestowed upon him by fellow CKY crew member Chris Aspite.

Raab battled drug addiction and alcoholism, and was able to find sobriety later in life.

<text>In geometry, the rhombic dodecahedron is a convex polyhedron with 12 congruent rhombic faces. It has 24 edges, and 14 vertices of 2 types. As a Catalan solid, it is the dual polyhedron of the cuboctahedron. As a parallelohedron, the rhombic dodecahedron can be used to tesselate its copies in space creating a rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb. There are some variations of the rhombic dodecahedron, one of which is the Bilinski dodecahedron. There are some stellations of the rhombic dodecahedron, one of which is the Escher&#x27;s solid. The rhombic dodecahedron may also appear in the garnet crystal, the architectural philosophies, practical usages, and toys.

== As a Catalan solid ==
=== Metric properties ===
The rhombic dodecahedron is a polyhedron with twelve rhombi, each of which long face-diagonal length is exactly formula_1 times the short face-diagonal length and the acute angle measurement is formula_2. Its dihedral angle between two rhombi is 120°.

The rhombic dodecahedron is a Catalan solid, meaning the dual polyhedron of an Archimedean solid, the cuboctahedron; they share the same symmetry, the octahedral symmetry. It is face-transitive, meaning the symmetry group of the solid acts transitively on its set of faces. In elementary terms, this means that for any two faces, there is a rotation or reflection of the solid that leaves it occupying the same region of space while moving a face to another one. Other than rhombic triacontahedron, it is one of two Catalan solids that each have the property that their isometry groups are edge-transitive; the other convex polyhedron classes being the five Platonic solids and the other two Archimedean solids: its dual polyhedron and icosidodecahedron.

Denoting by &quot;a&quot; the edge length of a rhombic dodecahedron,
* the radius of its inscribed sphere (tangent to each of the rhombic dodecahedron&#x27;s faces) is: () formula_3
* the radius of its midsphere is: ) formula_4
* the radius of the sphere passing through the six order four vertices, but not through the eight order 3 vertices, is: () formula_5
* the radius of the sphere passing through the eight order three vertices is exactly equal to the length of the sides: formula_6

The surface area &quot;A&quot; and the volume &quot;V&quot; of the rhombic dodecahedron with edge length &quot;a&quot; are:
formula_7

The rhombic dodecahedron can be viewed as the convex hull of the union of the vertices of a cube and an octahedron where the edges intersect perpendicularly. The six vertices where four rhombi meet correspond to the vertices of the octahedron, while the eight vertices where three rhombi meet correspond to the vertices of the cube.

The graph of the rhombic dodecahedron is nonhamiltonian.

=== Construction ===

For edge length , the eight vertices where three faces meet at their obtuse angles have Cartesian coordinates (±1, ±1, ±1). In the case of the coordinates of the six vertices where four faces meet at their acute angles, they are (±2, 0, 0), (0, ±2, 0) and (0, 0, ±2).

The rhombic dodecahedron can be seen as a degenerate limiting case of a pyritohedron, with permutation of coordinates and with parameter &quot;h&quot; = 1.

These coordinates illustrate that a rhombic dodecahedron can be seen as a cube with six square pyramids attached to each face, allowing them to fit together into a cube. Therefore, the rhombic dodecahedron has twice the volume of the inscribed cube with edges equal to the short diagonals of the rhombi. Alternatively, the rhombic dodecahedron can be constructed by inverting six square pyramids until their apices meet at the cube&#x27;s center.

== As a space-filling polyhedron ==
The rhombic dodecahedron is a space-filling polyhedron, meaning it can be applied to tessellate three-dimensional space: it can be stacked to fill a space, much like hexagons fill a plane. It is a parallelohedron because it can be space-filling a honeycomb in which all of its copies meet face-to-face. More generally, every parellelohedron is zonohedron, a centrally symmetric polyhedron with centrally symmetric faces. As a parallelohedron, the rhombic dodecahedron can be constructed with four sets of six parallel edges.

The rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb (or &quot;dodecahedrille&quot;) is an example of a honeycomb constructed by filling all rhombic dodecahedrons. It is dual to the &quot;tetroctahedrille&quot; or half cubic honeycomb, and it is described by two Coxeter diagrams: and . With D3d symmetry, it can be seen as an elongated trigonal trapezohedron. It can be seen as the Voronoi tessellation of the face-centered cubic lattice. It is the Brillouin zone of body-centered cubic (bcc) crystals. Some minerals such as garnet form a rhombic dodecahedral crystal habit. As Johannes Kepler noted in his 1611 book on snowflakes (&quot;Strena seu de Nive Sexangula&quot;), honey bees use the geometry of rhombic dodecahedra to form honeycombs from a tessellation of cells each of which is a hexagonal prism capped with half a rhombic dodecahedron. The rhombic dodecahedron also appears in the unit cells of diamond and diamondoids. In these cases, four vertices (alternate threefold ones) are absent, but the chemical bonds lie on the remaining edges.
A rhombic dodecahedron can be dissected into four congruent, obtuse trigonal trapezohedra around its center. These rhombohedra are the cells of a trigonal trapezohedral honeycomb. Analogously, a regular hexagon can be dissected into 3 rhombi around its center. These rhombi are the tiles of a rhombille.

As seen in the rightmost image displaying a garnet crystal, this polyhedron can be seen in crystal structures of various gemstones, such as Garnet (As seen in the image), and Almandine.

=== Practical usage ===
In spacecraft reaction wheel layout, a tetrahedral configuration of four wheels is commonly used. For wheels that perform equally (from a peak torque and max angular momentum standpoint) in both spin directions and across all four wheels, the maximum torque and maximum momentum envelopes for the 3-axis attitude control system (considering idealized actuators) are given by projecting the tesseract representing the limits of each wheel&#x27;s torque or momentum into 3D space via the 3 × 4 matrix of wheel axes; the resulting 3D polyhedron is a rhombic dodecahedron. Such an arrangement of reaction wheels is not the only possible configuration (a simpler arrangement consists of three wheels mounted to spin about orthogonal axes), but it is advantageous in providing redundancy to mitigate the failure of one of the four wheels (with degraded overall performance available from the remaining three active wheels) and in providing a more convex envelope than a cube, which leads to less agility dependence on axis direction (from an actuator/plant standpoint). Spacecraft mass properties influence overall system momentum and agility, so decreased variance in envelope boundary does not necessarily lead to increased uniformity in preferred axis biases (that is, even with a perfectly distributed performance limit within the actuator subsystem, preferred rotation axes are not necessarily arbitrary at the system level).

The polyhedron is also the basis for the HEALPix grid, used in cosmology for storing and manipulating maps of the cosmic microwave background, and in computer graphics for storing environment maps.

=== Miscellaneous ===
The collections of the Louvre include a die in the shape of a rhombic dodecahedron dating from Ptolemaic Egypt. The faces are inscribed with Greek letters representing the numbers 1 through 12: Α Β Γ Δ Ε Ϛ Z Η Θ Ι ΙΑ ΙΒ. The function of the die is unknown.

=== Topologically equivalent forms ===

Other symmetry constructions of the rhombic dodecahedron are also space-filling, and as parallelotopes they are similar to variations of space-filling truncated octahedra. For example, with 4 square faces, and 60-degree rhombic faces, and D4h dihedral symmetry, order 16. It can be seen as a cuboctahedron with square pyramids attached on the top and bottom.

In 1960, Stanko Bilinski discovered a second rhombic dodecahedron with 12 congruent rhombus faces, the Bilinski dodecahedron. It has the same topology but different geometry. The rhombic faces in this form have the golden ratio.
The &quot;deltoidal dodecahedron&quot; is another topological equivalence of a rhombic dodecahedron form. It is isohedral with tetrahedral symmetry order 24, distorting rhombic faces into kites (deltoids). It has 8 vertices adjusted in or out in alternate sets of 4, with the limiting case a tetrahedral envelope. Variations can be parametrized by (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;), where &quot;b&quot; and &quot;a&quot; depend on each other such that the tetrahedron defined by the four vertices of a face has volume zero, i.e. is a planar face. (1,1) is the rhombic solution. As &quot;a&quot; approaches , &quot;b&quot; approaches infinity. It always holds that + = 2, with &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; &gt; .

=== Stellations ===
Like many convex polyhedra, the rhombic dodecahedron can be stellated by extending the faces or edges until they meet to form a new polyhedron. Several such stellations have been described by Dorman Luke. The first stellation, often called the stellated rhombic dodecahedron, can be seen as a rhombic dodecahedron with each face augmented by attaching a rhombic-based pyramid to it, with a pyramid height such that the sides lie in the face planes of the neighbouring faces. Luke describes four more stellations: the second and third stellations (expanding outwards), one formed by removing the second from the third, and another by adding the original rhombic dodecahedron back to the previous one.

=== Related polytope ===

The rhombic dodecahedron forms the hull of the vertex-first projection of a tesseract to three dimensions. There are exactly two ways of decomposing a rhombic dodecahedron into four congruent rhombohedra, giving eight possible rhombohedra as projections of the tesseracts 8 cubic cells. One set of projective vectors are: &quot;u&quot; = (1,1,−1,−1), &quot;v&quot; = (−1,1,−1,1), &quot;w&quot; = (1,−1,−1,1).

The rhombic dodecahedron forms the maximal cross-section of a 24-cell, and also forms the hull of its vertex-first parallel projection into three dimensions. The rhombic dodecahedron can be decomposed into six congruent (but non-regular) square dipyramids meeting at a single vertex in the center; these form the images of six pairs of the 24-cell&#x27;s octahedral cells. The remaining 12 octahedral cells project onto the faces of the rhombic dodecahedron. The non-regularity of these images are due to projective distortion; the facets of the 24-cell are regular octahedra in 4-space.

This decomposition gives an interesting method for constructing the rhombic dodecahedron: cut a cube into six congruent square pyramids, and attach them to the faces of a second cube. The triangular faces of each pair of adjacent pyramids lie on the same plane, and so merge into rhombi. The 24-cell may also be constructed in an analogous way using two tesseracts.

<doc id="607637" wikidata="Q785893" url="?curid=607637" title="Unilateralism">
<text>Unilateralism is any doctrine or agenda that supports one-sided action. Such action may be in disregard for other parties, or as an expression of a commitment toward a direction which other parties may find disagreeable. As a word, &quot;unilateralism&quot; is attested from 1926, specifically relating to unilateral disarmament. The current, broader meaning emerges in 1964. It stands in contrast with multilateralism, the pursuit of foreign policy goals alongside allies.

Unilateralism and multilateralism represent different policy approaches to international problems. When agreement by multiple parties is absolutely required—for example, in the context of international trade policies—bilateral agreements (involving two participants at a time) are usually preferred by proponents of unilateralism.

Unilateralism may be preferred in those instances when it is assumed to be the most efficient, i.e., in issues that can be solved without cooperation. However, a government may also have a principal preference for unilateralism or multilateralism, and, for instance, strive to avoid policies that cannot be realized unilaterally or alternatively to champion multilateral solutions to problems that could well have been solved unilaterally.

Unilateralism as first course of action can be viewed as an act of aggression or hard power, unilateral sanctions violate the United Nations Charter and inhibit development of developing countries.

Unilateral action is often elected on behalf of independent leaders with nationalist tendencies and a strong distrust for the intentions of other countries&#x27; intervention. In recent years, unilateral action is adjacent with nationalism, protectionism and rejection towards institutions that embody multilateral approach. i.e, the United States adopting protectionist trade policy during the mid-2010s against the multilateral interests of the World Trade Organization.

Unilateralism, if unprovoked, has the potential to disrupt the peaceful upholding of sovereignty and territorial integrity that global security depends upon. Unilateral coercive measures against smaller states put a strain on goals of sustainable development. Examples include arbitrarily imposed economic sanctions such as the United States embargo against Cuba.

Typically, governments may argue that their ultimate or middle-term goals are served by a strengthening of multilateral schemes and institutions, as was many times the case during the period of the Concert of Europe.

<doc id="607640" wikidata="Q593105" url="?curid=607640" title="Monetary base">
<text>In economics, the monetary base (also base money, money base, high-powered money, reserve money, outside money, central bank money or, in the UK, narrow money) in a country is the total amount of money created by the central bank. This includes:

* the total currency circulating in the public, 
* plus the currency that is physically held in the vaults of commercial banks,
* plus the commercial banks&#x27; reserves held in the central bank.

The monetary base should not be confused with the money supply, which consists of the total currency circulating in the public plus certain types of non-bank deposits with commercial banks.

==Management==
Open market operations are monetary policy tools which directly expand or contract the monetary base.

The monetary base is manipulated during the conduct of monetary policy by a finance ministry or the central bank. These institutions change the monetary base through open market operations: the buying and selling of government bonds. For example, if they buy government bonds from commercial banks, they pay for them by adding new amounts to the banks’ reserve deposits at the central bank, the latter being a component of the monetary base.

Typically, a central bank can also influence banking activities by manipulating interest rates and setting reserve requirements (how much money banks must keep on hand instead of loaning out to borrowers). Interest rates, especially on federal funds (ultra-short-term loans between banks), are themselves influenced by open market operations.

The monetary base has traditionally been considered high-powered because its increase will typically result in a much larger increase in the supply of demand deposits through banks&#x27; loan-making, a ratio called the money multiplier. However, for those that do not agree with the theory of the money multiplier, the monetary base can be thought of as high powered because of the fiscal multiplier instead.

==Monetary policy==

Monetary policy is generally presumed to be the policy preserve of reserve banks, who target an interest rate. If control of the amount of base money in the economy is lost due failure by the reserve bank to meet the reserve requirements of the banking system, banks who are short of reserves will bid up the interest rate. Interest rates are set by the reserve bank to maintain an inflation rate which is considered neither too high or too low. This is usually determined using a Taylor Rule.
The quantity of reserves in the banking system is supported by the open market operations performed by the reserve banks, involving the purchase and sale of various financial instruments, commonly government debt (bonds), usually using &quot;repos&quot;. Banks only require enough reserves to facilitate interbank settlement processes.
In some countries, reserve banks now pay interest on reserves. This adds another lever to the interest rate control mechanisms available to the reserve bank.
Following the 2008 financial crisis, quantitative easing raised the amount of reserves in the banking system, as reserve banks purchased bad debt from the banks, paying for it with reserves. This has left the banking system with an oversupply of reserves. This increase in reserves has had no effect on the level of interest rates. Reserves are never lent out by banks.

== Accounting ==
Following IFRS standards, base money is registered as a liability of the central banks&#x27; balance sheet, implying base money is by nature a debt from the central bank. However, given the special nature of central bank money – which cannot be redeemed in anything other than base money – numerous scholars such as Michael Kumhof have argued it should rather be recorded as a form of equity.

<text>The black-billed wood dove or black-billed dove (Turtur abyssinicus) is a pigeon which is a widespread resident breeding bird in a belt across Africa just south of the Sahara Desert.

This species is abundant in near desert, scrub and savannah. It builds a stick nest in a tree, often an acacia, and lays two cream-colored eggs. Its flight is quick, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general, and it tends to stay quite low.

Black-billed wood dove is a small plump pigeon, typically 20 cm in length. Its back, hindneck, wings and tail are pale grey brown, and the folded wings have dark metallic patches. There are two blackish bands on the back. The forehead, crown and nape are bluish grey, fading to whitish on the face. The underparts are pinkish, becoming whiter on the belly.

The bill of this dove is black. When flying, black-billed wood dove shows chestnut in the underwing. The call is a persistent fluted &quot;coo-coo-cu-coo&quot;. Sexes are similar, but immatures are duller than adults, scaly below, and lack the wing spots.

Black-billed wood doves eat grass and other small seeds. They are quite terrestrial, and usually forage on the ground.

They are not very gregarious, but form large flocks at waterholes.

Though they are classified as Least Concern in the IUCN, their population has decreased significantly since 2004.

<text>Eric Scott Melvin (born July 9, 1966) is an American musician and founding member of the punk rock band NOFX. Throughout the band&#x27;s existence, he and Fat Mike were the only band members who stayed since the beginning.

==NOFX==
Melvin plays guitar and sings backup vocals on most NOFX songs and wrote the guitar riffs for NOFX songs such as the intro for &quot;Leave It Alone&quot;. His vocal style is iconically called the &quot;Mel Yell&quot;.

==Music==
Melvin is a founding member of Punk Rock Karaoke with Greg Hetson and Steve Soto, though he rarely performs with them. Melvin is an irregular touring member of Me First and the Gimme Gimmes.

==Personal life==
Melvin is of Ukrainian and Jewish descent and grew up in Hollywood.

In 2016, Melvin married Australian-born artist Sarah Melvin. They have identical twin daughters together: Ivy Laine Melvin and Phaedra Rose Melvin, born 21 minutes apart. Melvin also has two boys, Eli Melvin and Caspian Melvin, and lives with his wife Sarah and all four children in the Encinitas area of Southern California. In 2017, he sold his home in San Francisco with some who viewed the home stating &quot;This can&#x27;t be a punk rocker&#x27;s house. It&#x27;s really tasteful.&quot;

Melvin was raised Jewish, but also relates to Buddhism and Taoism. He also practices meditation, breath work, and yoga.

<text>The Agonoxeninae are a subfamily of moths.

==History of classification==
Formerly, the subfamily only contained four named species – all in the type genus &quot;Agonoxena&quot; – if (e.g. following Nielsen &quot;et al.&quot;, 1996). Such a monotypic arrangement is fairly unusual in modern taxonomy without explicit need due to phylogenetic constraints.

Hodges (in Kristensen, 1999) retained the Blastodacnidae in the Agonoxenidae, giving a grouping of some 31 genera, and treating the whole as a subfamily Agonoxeninae of the grass-miner moths (Elachistidae). Collectively, the Agonoxenidae and &quot;Blastodacnidae&quot; are known as palm moths.

==Genera==
* &quot;Agonoxena&quot; 
* &quot;Asymphorodes&quot; (formerly in Cosmopterigidae)
* &quot;Cladobrostis&quot;
* &quot;Diacholotis&quot;
* &quot;Gnamptonoma&quot;
* &quot;Helcanthica&quot;
* &quot;Ischnopsis&quot;
* &quot;Nanodacna&quot;
* &quot;Nicanthes&quot;
* &quot;Pammeces&quot; (formerly in Cosmopterigidae)
* &quot;Pauroptila&quot;
* &quot;Porotica&quot;
* &quot;Proterocosma&quot; (formerly in Cosmopterigidae)

==Former genera==
&quot;Blastodacna&quot;, &quot;Dystebenna&quot;, &quot;Haplochrois&quot;, &quot;Heinemannia&quot; and &quot;Spuleria&quot; are sometimes placed here, sometimes in the Elachistidae (or Blastodacnidae).

Other genera formerly placed here:
* &quot;Chrysoclista&quot;
* &quot;Colonophora&quot;
* &quot;Glaucacna&quot;
* &quot;Palaeomystella&quot;
* &quot;Panclintis&quot;
* &quot;Prochola&quot;
* &quot;Tocasta&quot;

<text>A monetary system is a system by which a government provides money in a country&#x27;s economy. Modern monetary systems usually consist of the national treasury, the mint, the central banks and commercial banks.

==Commodity money system==

A commodity money system is a type of monetary system in which a commodity such as gold or seashells is made the unit of value and physically used as money. The money retains its value because of its physical properties. In some cases, a government may stamp a metal coin with a face, value or mark that indicates its weight or asserts its purity, but the value remains the same even if the coin is melted down.

==Commodity-backed money==
One step away from commodity money is &quot;commodity-backed money&quot;, also known as &quot;representative money&quot;. Many currencies have consisted of bank-issued notes which have no inherent physical value, but which may be exchanged for a precious metal, such as gold. This is known as the gold standard. A silver standard was widespread after the fall of the Byzantine Empire, and lasted until 1935, when it was abandoned by China and Hong Kong.

A 20th-century variation was bimetallism, also called the &quot;double standard&quot;, under which both gold and silver were legal tender.

==Fiat money==

The alternative to a commodity money system is fiat money which is defined by a central bank and government law as legal tender even if it has no intrinsic value. Originally fiat money was paper currency or base metal coinage, but in modern economies it mainly exists as data such as bank balances and records of credit or debit card purchases, and the fraction that exists as notes and coins is relatively small. Money is mostly created by banks when they loan to customers. Put simply, banks lending currency to customers, subject to each bank&#x27;s regulatory limit, is the principal mode of new deposit creation.

The central bank does not directly fix the amount of currency in circulation. Money creation is primarily accomploshed via lending by commercial banks. Borrowers who receive the money created by new lending in turn affect the stock of money, as paying off debts removes money circulating.

Although commercial banks create circulating money via lending, they cannot do so freely without limit. Commercial banks are required to maintain an on-hand reserve of funds equaling a portion of their total deposits banks (Large banks in the United States, for example, have a 10% reserve requirement.) Central banks set interest rates on funds available for commercial banks to borrow short-term from the central bank to meet their reserve requirement. This limits the amount of money the commercial banks are willing to lend, and thus create, as it affects the profitability of lending in a competitive market.

In times of economic distress, central banks can act as a borrower to prompt the creation of new money as well; during quantitative easing they will buy government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.

<doc id="607655" wikidata="Q5342752" url="?curid=607655" title="Edward Eliot, 3rd Earl of St Germans">
<text>Edward Granville Eliot, 3rd Earl of St Germans (29 August 1798 – 7 October 1877), styled Lord Elliot from 1823–45, was a British politician, peer, and diplomat.

==Background and education==
St Germans was born in Plymouth, Devon, the son of William Eliot, 2nd Earl of St Germans and his first wife, Lady Georgina (13 April 1769 – 4 March 1806), daughter of Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford. He was educated at Westminster School from 1809 to 1811, and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 13 December 1815.

==Political career==
St Germans became the Secretary of Legation at Madrid on 21 November 1823. He became member of parliament for Liskeard the following year. Beginning his career as a Tory, he remained loyal to Robert Peel, and served as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1827 until 1830. Out of parliament between 1832 and 1837, he served in Peel&#x27;s second government first as Chief Secretary for Ireland and later as Postmaster General of the United Kingdom. He brokered the so-called Lord Eliot Convention in Spain, which aimed to end the indiscriminate executions by firing squad of prisoners on both sides of the First Carlist War.

When the debate over the Corn Laws broke the Conservative Party he followed Peel, and served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in Lord Aberdeen&#x27;s coalition government. In that role, he hosted the visit of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort to the 1853 Great Exhibition held in Dublin. The Queen gave Lady St Germans a gift of jewellery to mark the occasion. He was twice Lord Steward under Lord Palmerston. In 1860, he accompanied the Prince of Wales on his tour of Canada and the USA.

==Marriage and issue==
Lord St Germans married Lady Jemima Cornwallis (24 December 1803, Brome, Suffolk – 2 July 1856, Dover Street, London), the third daughter of Charles Cornwallis, 2nd Marquess Cornwallis, at St James Church, Westminster, on 2 September 1824. They had six sons and two daughters:

*Lady Louisa Susan Cornwallis Eliot (17 December 1825 – 15 January 1911), married Walter Ponsonby, 7th Earl of Bessborough and was the mother of Edward Ponsonby, 8th Earl of Bessborough.
*Edward John Cornwallis Eliot, Lord Eliot (2 April 1827 – 26 November 1864), born in London, educated at Eton from 1839 to 1843, matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 21 October 1844, commissioned a Cornet and Sub-lieutenant, 1st Regiment of Life Guards and subsequently Captain of that Regiment, 1852, died unmarried at Port Eliot.
*Captain Hon. Granville Charles Cornwallis Eliot (9 September 1828 – 5 November 1854), officer Coldstream Guards, killed at the Battle of Inkerman.
*William Gordon Cornwallis Eliot, 4th Earl of St Germans (14 December 1829 – 19 March 1881), diplomat; succeeded his father but died unmarried
*Hon. Ernest Cornwallis Eliot (28 April 1831 – 23 January 1832), died in infancy
*Hon. Elizabeth Harriet Cornwallis Eliot (24 August 1833 – 16 March 1835), died in infancy
*Henry Cornwallis Eliot, 5th Earl of St Germans (11 February 1835 – 24 September 1911), succeeded elder brother
*Colonel Hon. Charles George Cornwallis Eliot, (16 October 1839 – 22 May 1901), courtier and soldier, equerry to THR Prince and Princess Christian 1869–96; Groom of the Bedchamber 1871–99, Gentleman Usher Daily Waiter to Queen Victoria 1899–1901; married on 26 October 1865 Constance Rhiannon Guest (daughter of Sir John Josiah Guest, Bt and Lady Charlotte Guest), Lady-in-Waiting to HRH Princess Frederica of Hanover

Lord St Germans died at Port Eliot in October 1877, aged 79. Through his youngest son, he was the great-grandfather of Margaret Eliot (1914–2011), the mother of Peter and Jane Asher.

<doc id="607666" wikidata="Q4744141" url="?curid=607666" title="American Institute of Architecture Students">
<text>The American Institute of Architecture Students (AIAS) is an independent, nonprofit, student-run organization that offers programs, information, and resources critical to architectural education. It primarily serves about 25,000 architecture students enrolled in accredited U.S. collegiate programs each year. Recently, the AIAS has also expanded its reach to international academic programs.

The organization represents one of five collateral organizations that govern the discipline of architecture in the United States, including allied organizations: the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA), the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB), and the American Institute of Architects (AIA). These governing bodies reflect the trajectory an architect will take during their career, from initial education, through licensure, and into practice.

AIAS publishes Crit, Journal of the AIAS (short for critique) and hosts events for students and professionals throughout the year, including FORUM, Grassroots Leadership Conference, and Quad Conferences. The organization was founded in 1956; it was originally called the National Architectural Student Association (NASA). Later the name changed to the Association of Student Chapters, AIA (ASC/AIA), before finding its present-day name the American Institute of Architecture Students.

== History ==
=== NASA: Before the Space Age ===
In 1956, architecture students established a continuing presence with the formation of the National Architectural Student Association (NASA). Chapters are established at all of the schools of architecture and a regional governance network is formed by the students at the first Student Forum. The students also elect Jim Barry (Rice Institute) as the first national president. Having accomplished the task of organizing a disparate array of local student activities into a collective voice, the ambitious students of NASA plant the seed for the nationally organized student voice from which we benefit from today.

Jim Barry serves as a part-time volunteer from his school with funding provided by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and Washington-area architectural programs. During his term, NASA publishes the first issue of LINE magazine, has representatives involved on AIA committees and hosts many interesting programs at the Octagon. The members of NASA also attend AIA Convention in Los Angeles, with special programs designed specifically for students.

=== From NASA to ASC/AIA ===
In 1958 the student organization is renamed the Association of Student Chapters, AIA (ASC/AIA), with the goal of bridging members to the AIA upon graduation. However, staff and leaders of the AIA are concerned in the early years about a separate student organization. It is believed this will conflict with the objective of encouraging students to maintain their memberships with both organizations. At the 1960 student convention (held on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley) the AIA board of directors proposed to abolish the ASC/AIA. John Richards, FAIA, then president of the AIA states, &quot;[the student affiliations] of the past had not been as successful as had been hoped, and that it was feeling of the staff of the AIA that student organization structure was in need of improvement.&quot;

Students leaders lobbied to convince the AIA board of directors that the ASC/AIA chapter system was the foundation for the AIA and for the promotion of future generations entering architecture. Final remarks made by student president Charles Jones (University of Arizona) on this matter foreshadow what is to become. In his speech to the General Session of the AIA on April 22, 1960, he states, &quot;The students have no desire to make this organization so large that it becomes completely out of hand.&quot; However, the organization did grow. At the 1970 AIA Convention student president Taylor Culver (Howard University) leads a student revolt. Minutes of the meeting report that Culver and his fellow students take over the podium held by the AIA president and display their strength and solidarity in numbers.

The strength of the organization continues to grow in all directions, and the responsibilities of the officers coincide. In 1972, two-term student president Fay D&#x27;Avignon (Boston Architectural Center) is elected as the first female president of the organization, and also becomes the first ASC/AIA officer to take full-time responsibilities in Washington, DC. This marks a new phase in the organization&#x27;s efforts to become an autonomous voice of architectural students. This is a significant point when professionals and the AIA relinquish responsibilities to the ASC/AIA in many affairs that directly impact students. As a result, ASC/AIA develops into a unified national voice for students. The number of local chapters increases steadily as does the general membership. With the extra workload, it is clear that the vice president is also needed on a full-time basis in Washington, DC. In 1975 president Ella Hall (North Carolina State University) and vice president Steve Biegel (Syracuse University) become the first ASC/AIA national officers to work full-time in the National Office in Washington, D.C., as a team. The term for the national officers also changes to the July–June schedule, parallel to academic schedules.
Exhibiting unbridled energy, 1976–1977 team Jerry Compton (SCI-ARC) and Robert Rosenfeld (University of California, Berkeley) demonstrate creativity and clarity of vision. Notable achievements include solidifying the ASC/AIA growing operations budget, holding the first design competition, publishing the magazine Telesis, and establishing student representation on the IDP Coordinating Committee. Rosenfeld names Crit, which launches the rebranded publication the following year. Crit celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2015.

The following year, Rosenfeld continues on as vice president, with Charles Guerin (University of Houston) as president. These two officers start many current traditions of the organizations, including initiating the first ASC/AIA Chapter Honor Award and publishing the first issues of Crit. They also hold perhaps the most unusual competition to date, which concludes with the construction of a hot air balloon that is then launched over the Pacific Ocean.

In 1978 John Jeronimo (University of Miami) and Mary Beth Permar (Clemson University and The University of Illinois) collaborate on the continuation and improvement of Crit from a magazine format to a true architectural journal. Additionally, they increase the size of the board of directors to include the FORUM Chair and Crit Editor. The overall operating budget of the ASC/AIA passes the $100,000 mark for the first time in history. Jeronimo and Permar set in motion the largest national design competition to date, the first McDonald&#x27;s Competition, which includes over 650 entries (only surpassed in number of entries by the Vietnam Memorial Design Competition).

=== A New Autonomy: AIAS, Inc. ===

After several years of continued prosperity, the ASC/AIA arrives at a critical phase. The growth of the organization is beginning to outweigh the abilities and skills of the national officers alone.

In 1982, under the leadership of president William Plimpton (University of California, Berkeley) and Vice president Nora Klebow (Kent State University), the ASC/AIA formally separated from the AIA and incorporated as an independent not-for-profit corporation. To better prepare for the future, a special &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; Task Force was formed in June 1982 to study the structure and operations of the organization.

In 1984, after a thorough self-examination, president Tom Fowler (New York Institute of Technology-Old Westbury) accepts the recommendations of the Special Task Force to review the structure of the organization. This report further suggests renaming the organization &quot;The American Institute of Architecture Students&quot; (AIAS), incorporating The organization hires the first full-time Executive Director, Carl D. Costello, who quickly exhibits outstanding administrative skills and an understanding of the interests and concerns of architecture students. That year the organization is officially incorporated in Washington, D.C., as The American Institute of Architecture Students, Inc.

With a fresh name and new independence, the AIAS leadership takes to the task of developing the organization. 1985 president Scott Norberg (University of Nebraska) and vice president Whitney Powers (Mississippi State University) dedicate themselves to examining issues that are critical to the architectural scene. During the Kent State Memorial Competition, Ian Taberner&#x27;s award-winning proposal is rejected by the University &quot;because he was not a citizen of the United States, as required by the design competition&quot;. This sparks debate within the AIAS and becomes an issue at the annual meeting. Participation at these meetings is exceptional: over 1,100 students attend the 1985 AIAS FORUM in New York.

=== Growth and prosperity ===
The first meeting of AIAS Grassroots Leadership Conference was organized during the summer of 1985. This sets the beginning of a 30+ year legacy of chapter leaders from around the country gathering annually at the AIAS National Office in Washington, D.C., to discuss chapter issues, community involvement and participate in the governance of the organization. Also during 1985, the AIAS holds three national design competitions. In Norberg&#x27;s second term, alongside vice president Lee W. Waldrep, Ph.D. (Arizona State University), the number of competitions increases to four; the AIAS initiates the Search for Shelter Program to address the growing issue of homelessness in America; and the AIAS contributes to the AIA Education Initiative by establishing the AIAS Outstanding Practitioner in Education award (which still exists today under a different name).

In 1988–1989 the AIAS accepts its first chapter outside the United States when the Council of Presidents votes to accept Ryerson Polytechnical Institute in Toronto, Ontario (Canada). AIAS strengthens its commitment to the housing for the homeless issue with active participation in the Habitat for Humanity program. The &quot;Partners in Education&quot; program is also founded. The sponsorship-based program provides interested individuals and corporations the opportunity to support students of architecture and the AIAS.

In 1989–1990 the AIAS moves into new office space, increases the full-time national office positions to five, and makes a major investment in desktop publishing software (which is very expensive at the time). The dues structure for local chapters is also revised to reflect a commitment to the organization by individual member dues, rather that a lump-sum from the entire school. One substantial outgrowth of this revision is the establishment of an active database which allows individual mailings of pertinent information to each AIAS member. A triumph for students this year is the inclusion of a standardized NAAB four-year degree language in college catalogs. This mandate is initiated by the AIAS and adopted by the five collateral architecture organizations the following year.

The 1990–1991 term sees the AIAS experience grow with the addition of thirteen chapters, which pushes membership to a then record 156 chapters. An additional full-time staff person is hired to coordinate AIAS competitions. The year&#x27;s agenda is largely an affirmation of student commitment to environmental issues. The Environmental Action Committee (EAC) is established to gather information pertaining to environmental issues and their relationship to the design process, and disseminate this information to fellow students and educators. Two significant position papers on architectural education deficiencies and degree nomenclature are also presented to the collateral organizations by AIAS leaders during this term. These are included in a newly compiled, comprehensive set of AIAS governing documents.

The 1991–1992 officers, president Lynn N. Simon (University of Washington) and vice president Kevin P. McGillycuddy (Washington-Alexandria Center), emphasize a devotion to the quality of career counseling and the internship experience. Five national directors focus their endeavors on minority programs, affordable housing, women in architecture, community involvement and career options. The Five Presidents Declaration (five architecture collateral presidents) proposes a single designation for the professional degree in architecture, that sparks discussion and debate among students, educators and practitioners.

At the beginning of the 1992–1993 the term the officers and staff work to make the office&#x27;s duties manageable while combating a budget deficit. But there is continued development when the office produces a new handbook for each chapter to use on the local level, while the 1992–1993 national directors produce informational documents on career options and environmentally safe resources for the studio, and a video on women in architecture. A new system of regional coordinators is also set into place, the AIAS Long Range Plan is developed into a finished document, and the Sustainability Declaration is finalized for adoption by the four other collateral organizations. The membership is at 7,520.

In 1993–1994 president Garen D. Miller (Drury College) and Vice president Christine A. Malecki (Carnegie Mellon University) hire former AIAS vice president Irene Dumas Tyson as executive director. The Council of Presidents (COP) votes to double individual dues with a goal to maintain a high membership level. Indeed, the 1993–1994 membership grew to 8,025. The AIAS enters the information highway with an e-mail address, involvement on the AIAOnline network, and develops of an all-electronic design competition. The COP approves a historic policy of the AIAS, requiring all speakers invited to AIAS events to verify that they pay their interns legally-mandated wages (still required of all AIAS speakers today). Following the lead of the AIAS, the board of directors of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA) and the AIA adopt similar policies.

At the 1995 Grassroots conference the Council of Presidents is offered three options for membership dues: $12 (the fee at the time), $24 or $36. Taking the appropriate action, the COP votes to triple the dues to $36/school year. Unfortunately, the consequence of this action is 42% drop in membership to 3,980 members, however, 85% of the chapters remain active. The AIAS enters its 40th year with decreased membership, but with leaders determined to re-grow the organization.

The next year, 1997–1998 president Robert L. Morgan (Clemson University) and vice president Rachel Livingston Ahalt (University of Colorado Denver) spend their term focusing on the financial viability of the National Office, and organizing AIAS Legacy members (former officers and directors) to defeat a proposal by the AIA board of directors to investigate the creation of a student category of membership within the AIA. The proposal sparks cohesiveness among AIAS members and debates at the 1998 AIA Convention reaffirm AIA members&#x27; support for the AIAS as an independent organization.

=== Heading toward the 50th Year ===
The year 2002 sees the addition of two days to the Grassroots conference to focus on leadership education in collaboration with professionals from Georgetown University. The AIAS also reaches its healthiest financial position at the time with a strong organizational reserve, new investment policies, and professional management. Other organizational improvements included a shift in the terms of board of directors to coincide with the Grassroots conference, the creation of Personnel and Finance Committees, the initiation of a strategic planning process and a streamlining of the elections process.

In early 2003, Pam Kortan Day resigns as the executive director and the board of directors hires Michael V. Geary, CAE. Efforts then increase to better market the organization, increase membership, expand fundraising efforts, and prepare for the 50th anniversary. In 2004 the organization adopts a new logo and Web site. The new logo includes an &quot;A&quot; in the middle representing a design compass and the &quot;A&quot;s in the organization&#x27;s acronym. Also at this time the masthead and interior of Crit, Journal of the AIAS and AIASinfo (the bimonthly electronic newsletter) are redesigned by Design Army to supposedly reflect the modern design aesthetics of the members.

By December 2007, the (Great Recession) begins causing significant damage within the construction industry. Many practicing designers in the field of architecture lose their jobs between 2007–2012. The United States hits an all time unemployment high, second only to the (Great Depression). The residual damage caused severe impact on architecture graduates trying to enter the field. Many left the practice of architecture entirely during 2007–2014. This major moment in time increased interest in alternative careers in architecture.
In 2008, president Andrew C. Caruso (Carnegie Mellon University) and vice president Tony P. Vanky (Tulane University) releases the AIAS Issue Brief on Architectural Education. With rapid changes in technology, this critical and anticipatory document highlighted issues relevant to the future education and practice of the profession. The brief was intended to impact the 2008 review of the National Architectural Accrediting Board Conditions for Accreditation, citing opportunities for necessary and visionary change by way of major themes such as ecological literacy, social responsibility, global change, urbanism, diversity, technology, and culture (among others).

2009 president JW Blanchard (Southern Polytechnic State University) focused on ensuring the legacy of Crit to continue as a valuable asset to the membership. Development of resources to assist Quads with conference planning were released, which expanded outreach of regional events within the four territories. Participation numbers for Quad conferences rose.

At the end of 2009, Michael V. Geary, CAE resigns as executive director, launching an Executive Search for the organization. Association Strategies is hired to assist in finding a qualified replacement. Joshua Caulfield, IOM is hired in spring of 2010. Between 2009–2011, president Je&#x27;Nen M. Chastain (University of North Carolina at Charlotte), vice president Brett Roeth (Miami University), and president Tyler W. Ashworth (University of Idaho) and vice president Danielle McDonough (Northeastern University) were faced with the challenge of transitioning the organization into the next decade. Strategic planning exercises started in 2006 are carried through to realize long discussed programs, policies, committees, and member benefits that will support growing professional needs of the membership. Implementation takes off quickly into 2011–2012. FORUM receives a record high attendance of 1,000+ students in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Under the leadership of president Nick Mancusi (Taliesin, The Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture) and vice president Laura Meador (Louisiana State University) the AIAS undergoes a Re:Branding effort. Advocacy also shifts forward as a strategic priority of the organization with the introduction of the Federal Student Loans (National Design Services Act). A four-year financial plan to double revenue is created, with the goal to achieve decade record high membership. New program tracks are introduced at the Grassroots Leadership Conference, and membership services are expanded. Continued growth takes place in 2011–2012. Gradual recovery from the (Great Recession) in the United States allows the profession of architecture to also recover.

In 2012 the AIAS is met with the resignation of Executive Director Joshua Caulfield, IOM. President Westin Conahan (University of Nevada, Las Vegas) hires Nick Serfass, CAE as the new executive director.

=== 60 Years of Leadership, Design, and Service ===
2016 marked the 60th anniversary of the organization. President Sarah Wahlgren (Auburn University) and vice president Rachel Law (Ryerson University) lead the celebrations and added an NCARB liaison to the Board of Directors. In 2018, the AIAS hosted its first international conference for students of architecture in the Middle East at the American University in Dubai - president Keshika de Saram (University of Minnesota) and vice president Elizabeth Seidel (University of Montana) attend the event. The following year, president Amelia Rosen (Carnegie Mellon University) creates a new strategic plan and establishes long-term goals for the organization.

The AIAS celebrated 15 years of Freedom By Design at FORUM 2019 in Toronto, Ontario. Executive director Nick Serfass, CAE left the AIAS after years of dedicated service and is replaced by Karma Israelsen, MA. The AIAS continues to expand oversees, seeing particular growth among students in Latin America and the Middle East. In 2020, new board positions are established for Latin America and the Middle East to represent international members in those regions. Advocacy continues to be a major focus of the organization, and president Sarah Curry (Auburn University) publishes the AIAS&#x27; promise to communities of color. The organization publishes a new document on learning and teaching culture to advocate for healthy learning environments and the board adopts a set of public policies.

The COVID-19 pandemic forces the AIAS to cease all in-person activities at the beginning of 2020. President Erin Conti (Illinois Institute of Technology) and vice president Sara Taketatsu (University of Colorado - Boulder) lead the board in efforts to adapt programs and events to a virtual environment. Membership numbers and engagement drop significantly during the pandemic as universities implement online classes and global lockdowns are put in place. Despite the difficulties, the AIAS successfully hosts its first virtual conference for Grassroots 2020 in July. During the second day of the virtual FORUM conference later that year, the deadly January 6 United States Capitol attack takes place mere blocks from the location of the AIAS office. The year ends with Ashley Ash taking over as interim executive director. A new board liaison position is created for the National Organization of Minority Architects (NOMA), and the AIAS begins to promote alternative career paths for graduates of architecture schools. The organization also creates a code of ethics and a permanent ethics committee.

2021-2022 officers Scott Cornelius (Oklahoma State University) and Shannon DeFranza (Roger Williams University) continue pandemic recovery efforts for the organization and work to strengthen relationships with allied organizations. President Cornelius passes a new, short-term strategic plan aimed at stabilizing the organization. All events are still completely virtual through the year, with the exception of one in-person Quad Conference hosted by Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA. Larry H. Hoffer is hired as executive director in early 2022.

Grassroots 2022 is held in-person in Washington, D.C. for the first time in three years. Over 450 attendees participate in the event, an all-time high for the organization. A group of organizations that govern the profession of architecture, including the AIAS, come together and brand themselves as the &#x27;alliance organizations&#x27; - president Cooper Moore (Kent State University) hosts the leadership of these organizations for the first meeting of the alliance a few months later. Supported by the Board and Staff, President Moore and Vice President Nicole Bass (City College of New York) oversee an increase in membership numbers for the first time in 7 years.

==Programs==
=== FORUM ===
FORUM is the annual membership meeting of the AIAS, gathering 600–1,000 architecture students in one city over New Years. The AIAS signature conference, FORUM, is the largest annual gathering of architecture students in the world.

=== Quad Conferences ===
Organized by the four regions of the AIAS: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West, Quad conferences bring students together at nearby schools of architecture.

=== Freedom by Design ===
Freedom by Design is the community-service portfolio of the AIAS. Students use their design skills to address a wide variety of barriers in their communities.

Initially focused on just physical accessibility, the scope of Freedom by Design was expanded in 2017 to encompass a wider variety of student-driven projects.

A significant amount of support for Freedom by Design is provided by NCARB. NCARB offers both funding and mentorship for participants.

=== &quot;CRIT&quot; ===
&quot;CRIT&quot; is the journal of the AIAS.

=== Competitions ===
AIAS administers various competitions throughout the year.

== Branding ==
During the 60-year history of the AIAS, the name and branding of the organization has evolved.

=== Name change ===
1956–1958, National Architectural Student Association (NASA)

1958–1984, Association of Student Chapters, AIA (ASC/AIA)

1984–present, American Institute of Architecture Students (AIAS)

=== Logo evolution ===
Referred to as the &quot;Dancing Bunnies&quot; Logo, the previous logo was designed in 1985 by Kim Murray of Montana State University.

In 2004 the organization adopts a new logo and website. In 2004, the AIAS introduces a new logo with alternating layered shapes, that are reflective of both the past and forward looking. This suggests a progressive organization that is also respectful of its history. It includes an iconic &quot;A&quot; in the middle representing a compass (drawing tool), an &quot;A&quot; for architecture, and the &quot;A&quot;s in the organization&#x27;s acronym. A compass is a technical drawing instrument that can be used for inscribing circles or arcs. As dividers, they can also be used as tools to measure distances, in particular on maps. Compasses can be used for mathematics, drafting, navigation, and other purposes. Members of the organization received a pin with this symbol and began wearing it on their lapel.

In 2011 the organization began a Re:Branding effort led by president Nick Mancusci (Taliesin, The Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture). The redesign was revisited again in 2015, as the organization explored modifications to simplify the 2004 logo.

== Members and chapters ==
The organization is made up of members from various chapters across the United States and abroad. Currently at 6,000 members, the AIAS represents the nearly 25,000 architecture students enrolled in NAAB accredited programs. Being centralized in the U.S., regions are based on four geographic territories: Northeast Quad, Midwest Quad, South Quad, and West Quad.

Chapters follow the governing rules of the AIAS set forth in the Bylaws and Rules of the Board; however, every chapter also creates their independent culture based on location, design school philosophies, support from faculty and administrators, and engagement of students.

Chapter leaders serve on the Council of Presidents (COP). This governing body of the organization meets twice a year to vote on business of the AIAS, including election of the board of directors. Meetings of the COP occur at the Grassroots Leadership Conference in the summer and FORUM, the annual meeting during New Years break.

== FORUM ==
FORUM is the annual conference of the American Institute of Architecture Students, and is the largest annual gathering of architecture students in the world.


== Legacy and Board of Directors ==

The AIAS National Board of Directors are students and recent graduates elected by members to serve the organization&#x27;s highest office for a one-year term. Elections include a rigorous candidacy at the AIAS annual meeting FORUM, including national speeches, Q&amp;A, and networking. Once elected, the new board of directors undergoes a transition period from December to July. In July of each year the new board of directors is sworn into term at the National Building Museum (a member attended tradition started in 2011). Individuals are asked to &quot;raise their drawing hand&quot; in order to take the oath.

The President and Vice President, known as Officers, are hired full-time to work together on behalf of the organization out of the National Office in Washington, D.C. Presidents transition into the role of Past President upon completion of their term on the board. Quad Directors work with students from within their region, typically while still attending school. Liaisons are appointed from collateral organizations, including the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture and the American Institute of Architects. In recent years, the AIAS has added Regional Director positions to the Board to represent members of international chapters. The AIAS is supported by a full-time staff led by the executive director in Washington, D.C.

<text>TACIS is an abbreviation of &quot;Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States&quot; programme, a foreign and technical assistance programme implemented by the European Commission to help members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (as well as Mongolia), in their transition to democratic market-oriented economies. TACIS is now subsumed in the Global Europe programme.

==History==
Launched by the European Economic Community in 1991, the Tacis Programme provides grant-financed technical assistance to 12 countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan). Mongolia was also covered by the Tacis programme from 1991 to 2003, but is now covered by the ALA Programme.

From the 2007-2013 EU Financial Perspective, the Tacis Programme has been replaced for the countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy and Russia by the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. Nuclear safety projects are covered by the Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation. However, Tacis projects programmed from 2006 continued to operate until 2012.

<doc id="607673" wikidata="Q1406821" url="?curid=607673" title="St. Elmo's Fire (film)">
<text>St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire is a 1985 American coming-of-age film co-written and directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Andie MacDowell and Mare Winningham. It centers on a clique of recent graduates of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Georgetown University, and their adjustment to post-university life and the responsibilities of adulthood. The film is a prominent movie of the Brat Pack genre. It received negative reviews from critics but was a box-office hit, grossing $37.8 million on a $10 million budget.

==Plot==
Recent Georgetown University graduates Alec, Leslie, Kevin, Jules, and Kirby wait to hear about the conditions of their friends: Wendy, a sweet-natured young woman devoted to helping others, and Billy, a former fraternity boy and now reluctant husband and father, after a minor car accident caused by Billy&#x27;s drinking. At the hospital, Kirby spots an intern named Dale, with whom he has been infatuated since college.

The group gathers at their favorite college hangout, St. Elmo&#x27;s Bar. Billy has been fired from the job that Alec helped him secure. At their apartment, Alec pressures Leslie to marry him, but she thinks they are unprepared. Kirby is telling Kevin of his love for Dale when Billy shows up, asking to spend the night as he cannot cope with his wife. Jules accuses Kevin of being gay and loving Alec. When Kevin visits Alec and Leslie for dinner, Alec confesses to Kevin that he recently had sex with a lingerie saleswoman.

Billy and Wendy get drunk together, and Wendy reveals that she is a virgin. They kiss, and Billy, tugging at her clothing, makes fun of her girdle. Wendy insists they remain platonic friends. At St. Elmo&#x27;s during a Halloween party, Jules reveals to Leslie that she is having an affair with her married boss. Billy sees his wife Felicia with another man in the crowd and attacks him. Billy is thrown out of the bar but reconciles with her. The women confront Jules about her affair and reckless spending, but she insists that everything is under control.

Kirby takes a job working for Mr. Kim, a wealthy Korean businessman, and invites Dale to a party at Mr. Kim&#x27;s house, which he is using without Mr. Kim&#x27;s permission. Wendy arrives with Howie, an ungainly Jewish boy whom her parents want her to marry. Alec announces that he and Leslie are engaged, upsetting her. She confronts him about her suspicions of his infidelity, and the two break up. Alec accuses Kevin of telling Leslie about the tryst with the lingerie woman. Jules gives Billy a ride home, and Billy makes a pass at her. Furious, Jules orders him out of her car; Felicia witnesses the confrontation.

When Dale skips the party, Kirby drives to the ski lodge where she is staying and meets her boyfriend. Kirby&#x27;s borrowed car gets stuck, and Dale and her boyfriend invite him in. The next morning, as Kirby prepares to leave the lodge, Dale tells him that she is flattered by his interest in her. He kisses her, and then her boyfriend takes a photo of them before he leaves.

Leslie goes to Kevin&#x27;s apartment to spend the night after the breakup and discovers photographs of her. Kevin confesses his love for her, and the two have sex. Alec goes to the apartment to apologize to Kevin and finds Leslie there.

Wendy tells her father that she wants to be independent and move into her own place. Jules has been fired from her job, fallen behind on her credit card payments, and her possessions have been seized. She locks herself in her apartment and opens the windows, intending to freeze to death. Her friends attempt to coax her out, but she is unresponsive. Kirby fetches Billy, who landed a job at a gas station courtesy of Kevin, to calm Jules down. Billy convinces Jules to let him in, and they talk about the challenges of life, overheard by the rest of the gang.

Wendy moves into her own place; Billy visits and informs her that he is getting a divorce and moving to New York City, and the two have sex. At the bus station, the group gathers once more to say goodbye to Billy. Billy urges Alec to make up with Leslie, but she declares that she does not want to date anyone for a while. Alec and Kevin make up, and the group makes plans to meet for brunch. However, they decide not to go to St. Elmo&#x27;s and instead choose Houlihan&#x27;s because there are &quot;not so many kids&quot; there.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
The film was announced in July 1984. It was executive produced by Ned Tanen. Tanen also produced &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; and it and &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; were dubbed &quot;The Little Chills&quot;, in reference to the film &quot;The Big Chill&quot;. &quot;These are both movies that no one has ever seen before,&quot; said Tanen.

===Casting===
According to Schumacher, &quot;a lot of people turned down the script...the head of [one] major studio called its seven-member cast ‘the most loathsome humans he had ever read on the page.’&quot; The producers interviewed &quot;hundreds of people&quot; for the cast, including Anthony Edwards, Jon Cryer and Lea Thompson. According to Lauren Shuler Donner, she found Estevez, Nelson, and Sheedy through recommendations from John Hughes, who had cast them in &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;; Schumacher said he had to &quot;push hard&quot; to get the studio to agree to cast the three. Demi Moore had to go to rehab before shooting.

&quot;I think there are people who go to college because it&#x27;s kind of what&#x27;s accepted,&quot; said Lowe. &quot;I feel unfortunately sometimes it&#x27;s used as a holding tank, waiting to go into the real world, instead of for education. I think there are people who can go into the marketplace after high school and do well.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#x27;m probably going to be criticized a lot,&quot; said Nelson. &quot;My character is very straight, very conservative, very career-oriented. After &quot;Breakfast Club&quot;, I think people will say I should have played another street punk. They&#x27;ll criticize me for not doing what I&#x27;m good at, for trying something new.&quot;

&quot;It&#x27;s refreshing to play someone who isn&#x27;t defined by who her boyfriend is or what her body looks like,&quot; said Sheedy.

&quot;I did feel a little like the new kid in class,&quot; said Moore.

===Filming===
Principal photography began early October 1984, just after executive producer Ned Tanen had been appointed as president of Paramount Pictures&#x27; motion picture division.

The private Catholic, Jesuit Georgetown University would not permit filming on campus, with their administrators citing questionable content such as premarital sex. As a result, the university seen on film is the public University of Maryland located 10 miles (16 km) away in College Park.

&quot;I loved wearing the clothes,&quot; said Moore, &quot;I&#x27;ve always been such a tom boy.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
David Denby called Schumacher &quot;brutally untalented&quot; and said that &quot;nobody over the moral age of fifteen&quot; will like the work of the Brat Pack actors in the film: 

According to Janet Maslin, 

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 44% from 45 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; is almost peak Brat Pack: it&#x27;s got the cast, the fashion, and the music, but the characters are too frequently unlikable.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on reviews from 15 critics.

Rob Lowe won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor for his work in this film.

In a 2015 retrospective review, Justin Gerber of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; said that he was &quot;prepared to say it&#x27;s the worst movie of all time, with all the necessary stipulations lined up and accounted for&quot;, going on to criticize the characters, plot, set, direction, and even score.

In listing the top stars in alphabetical order - Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham (as they were so listed in the film&#x27;s opening credits) - critic Joe Queenan, in his 1998 book &quot;Red Lobster, White Trash and the Blue Lagoon,&quot; wondered if he had ever seen a list just as scary. &quot;The &#x27;62 Mets?&quot; he rhetorically asked. &quot;The famous Ted Danson roast at the Friar&#x27;s Club? Then it came to me: The Nuremberg Rally of 1934, where the list read:

*Joseph Goebbels
*Hermann Göring
*Rudolf Hess
*Heinrich Himmler
*Adolf Hitler

&quot;And believe you me, do you get your money&#x27;s worth!&quot; Queenan went on to say that &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; was one of those movies &quot;that remind us that the eighties were far, far worse than any of us can recall today, and by helping these monsters get their careers off the ground, we will be paying for our sins for decades to come.&quot;

===Box office===
The film opened strongly, earning $6.1 million in its first week.

The film ended up making $37.8 million. It outperformed other box office disappointments from Columbia Pictures that year, including &quot;Silverado&quot;, &quot;The Bride&quot; and &quot;Perfect&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
It was the first soundtrack written by Canadian composer/producer David Foster. &quot;When I was writing the score to &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;, I loved it,&quot; he said. &quot;But for that month and a half or so that I had to write the songs, it just felt like doing my regular job.&quot;

The theme song &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire (Man in Motion)&quot; was written by Foster and English musician John Parr, and also performed by Parr. Foster had been impressed by Parr&#x27;s song &quot;Naughty Naughty&quot; and invited him to perform the title track. Originally another song was chosen which Parr disliked. &quot;That song sounded like &quot;Fame II&quot; or &quot;Flashdance II&quot;&quot;, Parr later said. &quot;I thought the movie was supposed to have more class than that. It was a regurgitated song, and I didn&#x27;t really want to sing it.&quot;

Parr urged Foster to try another song. They wrote it together, &quot;very fast, between 2 and 4 on Friday afternoon,&quot; Parr recalled. &quot;We wrote it, together, with David sitting at the piano.&quot; Schumacher had given Parr rough guidelines for the lyrics. &quot;He wanted a song about determination,&quot; Parr recalled. &quot;He wanted a song about kids who are growing up and have to make decisions about what to do with their lives. That&#x27;s what the movie is about.&quot; Schumacher told them not to use &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; in the lyrics, but Parr did it, regardless. &quot;I thought it fit in the song,&quot; he said. &quot;In the movie, St. Elmo&#x27;s is a bar. But to me, &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; is a magical thing glowing in the sky that holds destiny to someone. It&#x27;s mystical and sacred. It&#x27;s where paradise lies, like the end of the rainbow.&quot;

Parr was inspired to write the lyrics not by the movie (which he had not seen) but by the Canadian athlete Rick Hansen, who, at the time, was traveling around the world, via his wheelchair, to raise awareness for spinal cord injuries, a trip called the &quot;Man in Motion Tour&quot;. The song did not appear on any Parr album until &quot;Letter to America&quot; was released in July 2011.

The song &quot;Give Her a Little Drop More,” which plays during the movie when the characters enter St. Elmo&#x27;s Bar &amp; Restaurant, was written by British jazz trumpeter John Chilton.

&quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire (Man in Motion)&quot; hit No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 chart for two weeks in September 1985, and &quot;Love Theme from St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; (the instrumental theme to the movie by David Foster) reached No. 15. Another version of the &quot;Love Theme from &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;&quot; with lyrics, titled &quot;For Just a Moment&quot;, was performed by Amy Holland and Donny Gerrard, and was included as the final song on the soundtrack album.

===Music video===
The music video of &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire (Man in Motion)&quot; serves as a mini-sequel to the film, which features all seven of the main cast reuniting and looking sadly through the broken and dirty windows of a run-down and fire-damaged St. Elmo&#x27;s Bar. The video was directed by Kort Falkenberg III, who devised the concept with the film&#x27;s director, Joel Schumacher.

==Future==
In August 2009, Sony Pictures Television received a &quot;script commitment with a penalty attached to it&quot; to adapt the film into a television series, which would &quot;use the movie as a takeoff point and as an inspiration as it introduces six new friends: three boys and three girls.&quot; Topher Grace and Gordon Kaywin of Sargent Hall Productions proposed the idea to Jamie Tarses; the three of them then recruited Dan Bucatinsky to write the pilot and Schumacher agreed to the concept. After remaining in development hell by August 2019, it was reported that NBC was developing a television series with Josh Berman attached as writer and executive producer.

In June 2024, following the successful release of the documentary &quot;Brats&quot; which reunited the Brat Pack, it was announced that a legacy sequel is in early development from Sony Pictures. It would hinge upon Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham reprising their roles from the original movie.

<doc id="607674" wikidata="Q7661178" url="?curid=607674" title="Symbolic execution">
<text>In computer science, symbolic execution(also symbolic evaluation or symbex) is a means of analyzing a program to determine what inputs cause each part of a program to execute. An interpreter follows the program, assuming symbolic values for inputs rather than obtaining actual inputs as normal execution of the program would. It thus arrives at expressions in terms of those symbols for expressions and variables in the program, and constraints in terms of those symbols for the possible outcomes of each conditional branch. Finally, the possible inputs that trigger a branch can be determined by solving the constraints.

The field of symbolic simulation applies the same concept to hardware. Symbolic computation applies the concept to the analysis of mathematical expressions.

==Example==
Consider the program below, which reads in a value and fails if the input is 6.
int f() {
 y = read();
 z = y * 2;
 if (z == 12) {
 fail();
 } else {
 printf(&quot;OK&quot;);
}
During a normal execution (&quot;concrete&quot; execution), the program would read a concrete input value (e.g., 5) and assign it to codice_1. Execution would then proceed with the multiplication and the conditional branch, which would evaluate to false and print codice_2.

During symbolic execution, the program reads a symbolic value (e.g., codice_3) and assigns it to codice_1. The program would then proceed with the multiplication and assign codice_5 to codice_6. When reaching the codice_7 statement, it would evaluate codice_8. At this point of the program, codice_3 could take any value, and symbolic execution can therefore proceed along both branches, by &quot;forking&quot; two paths. Each path gets assigned a copy of the program state at the branch instruction as well as a path constraint. In this example, the path constraint is codice_8 for the codice_7 branch and codice_12 for the codice_13 branch. Both paths can be symbolically executed independently. When paths terminate (e.g., as a result of executing codice_14 or simply exiting), symbolic execution computes a concrete value for codice_3 by solving the accumulated path constraints on each path. These concrete values can be thought of as concrete test cases that can, e.g., help developers reproduce bugs. In this example, the constraint solver would determine that in order to reach the codice_14 statement, codice_3 would need to equal 6.

==Limitations==

===Path explosion===

Symbolically executing all feasible program paths does not scale to large programs. The number of feasible paths in a program grows exponentially with an increase in program size and can even be infinite in the case of programs with unbounded loop iterations. Solutions to the &quot;path explosion&quot; problem generally use either heuristics for path-finding to increase code coverage, reduce execution time by parallelizing independent paths, or by merging similar paths. One example of merging is &quot;veritesting&quot;, which &quot;employs static symbolic execution to amplify the effect of dynamic symbolic execution&quot;.

===Program-dependent efficiency===
Symbolic execution is used to reason about a program path-by-path which is an advantage over reasoning about a program input-by-input as other testing paradigms use (e.g. dynamic program analysis). However, if few inputs take the same path through the program, there is little savings over testing each of the inputs separately.

=== Memory aliasing ===

Symbolic execution is harder when the same memory location can be accessed through different names (aliasing). Aliasing cannot always be recognized statically, so the symbolic execution engine can&#x27;t recognize that a change to the value of one variable also changes the other.

=== Arrays ===

Since an array is a collection of many distinct values, symbolic executors must either treat the entire array as one value or treat each array element as a separate location. The problem with treating each array element separately is that a reference such as &quot;A[i]&quot; can only be specified dynamically, when the value for i has a concrete value.

=== Environment interactions ===
Programs interact with their environment by performing system calls, receiving signals, etc. Consistency problems may arise when execution reaches components that are not under control of the symbolic execution tool (e.g., kernel or libraries). Consider the following example:
int main()
 FILE *fp = fopen(&quot;doc.txt&quot;);
 if (condition) {
 fputs(&quot;some data&quot;, fp);
 } else {
 fputs(&quot;some other data&quot;, fp);
 ...
 data = fgets(..., fp);
This program opens a file and, based on some condition, writes different kind of data to the file. It then later reads back the written data. In theory, symbolic execution would fork two paths at line 5 and each path from there on would have its own copy of the file. The statement at line 11 would therefore return data that is consistent with the value of &quot;condition&quot; at line 5. In practice, file operations are implemented as system calls in the kernel, and are outside the control of the symbolic execution tool. The main approaches to address this challenge are:

Executing calls to the environment directly. The advantage of this approach is that it is simple to implement. The disadvantage is that the side effects of such calls will clobber all states managed by the symbolic execution engine. In the example above, the instruction at line 11 would return &quot;some datasome other data&quot; or &quot;some other datasomedata&quot; depending on the sequential ordering of the states.

Modeling the environment. In this case, the engine instruments the system calls with a model that simulates their effects and that keeps all the side effects in per-state storage. The advantage is that one would get correct results when symbolically executing programs that interact with the environment. The disadvantage is that one needs to implement and maintain many potentially complex models of system calls. Tools such as KLEE, Cloud9, and Otter take this approach by implementing models for file system operations, sockets, IPC, etc.

Forking the entire system state. Symbolic execution tools based on virtual machines solve the environment problem by forking the entire VM state. For example, in S2E each state is an independent VM snapshot that can be executed separately. This approach alleviates the need for writing and maintaining complex models and allows virtually any program binary to be executed symbolically. However, it has higher memory usage overheads (VM snapshots may be large).

==History==
The concept of symbolic execution was introduced academically in the 1970s with descriptions of: the Select system,
the EFFIGY system,
the DISSECT system,
and Clarke&#x27;s system.

<text>The Montreal Botanical Garden (, ) is a large botanical garden in Montreal, Quebec, Canada comprising of thematic gardens and greenhouses. It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2008 as it is considered to be one of the most important botanical gardens in the world due to the extent of its collections and facilities.

==Background==

The botanical garden is located at 4101 Sherbrooke Street East, at the corner of Pie-IX and Sherbrooke Streets, in Maisonneuve Park, located in the borough of Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie, facing Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium. It contains a greenhouse complex full of plants from around the world, and a number of large outdoor gardens, each with a specific theme. The outdoor gardens are bare and covered with snow from about November until about April, but the greenhouses are open to visitors year round, hosting the annual Butterflies Go Free exhibit from February to April.

The garden was founded in 1931, in the height of the Great Depression, by mayor Camillien Houde, after years of campaigning by Fr. Marie-Victorin, also the author of the Flore laurentienne. The grounds were designed by Henry Teuscher, while the Art Deco style administration building was designed by architect Lucien F. Kéroack.

It serves to educate the public in general and students of horticulture in particular, as well as to conserve endangered plant species. The grounds are also home to a botanical research institution, to the Société d&#x27;astronomie de Montréal, and to the Montreal Insectarium; offsite, the garden staff also administer the Ferme Angrignon educational farm and petting zoo.

While it charges admission, city residents can obtain a pass granting free admission to the outdoor gardens, so many people visit regularly, even if only to sit under the trees. The nearest metro station is Pie-IX, which is located on the corner of the Olympic Stadium.

The Montreal Botanical Garden is one of four nature-focused attractions belonging to the City of Montreal in the Space for Life () museum district. The others are the Biodome, the Insectarium, and the Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium, all of which are near the Olympic Stadium.
==Gardens==
The Chinese Garden is constructed along the traditional lines for a Ming dynasty Chinese garden. Covering 2.5 hectares, it has many winding paths, an artificial mountain, and a building in the Chinese style housing a collection of bonsai and penjing that have been donated. The garden is populated with Chinese plants. The garden was constructed from 1990 to 1991 by 50 artisans from the Shanghai Institute of Landscape Design and Architecture, directed by Le Weizhong. The project required 120 containers of material imported from Shanghai, including 500 tonnes of stone from Lake Tai in Jiangsu province.

The Japanese Garden was created in 1988 under the direction of designer Ken Nakajima. Its 2.5 hectares are populated with Japanese plants, and it contains a building in the Japanese style containing an exhibit on tea. The Japanese tea ceremony is performed there during the summer, and anyone can take classes to learn more about it. Other traditional Japanese arts, such as Iaido and Ikebana are occasionally demonstrated there as well. It also includes a large koi pond; visitors often feed the koi. The garden hosts an annual Hiroshima memorial ceremony on the 5th of August, with the hourly ringing of a Japanese Peace Bell made in Hiroshima.

The First Nations Garden was opened in 2001 to honour and present the cultures of the indigenous population of Canada. Species endemic to Quebec and other North American regions are kept in the garden; the maple, birch, and pine trees shade its paths, and the garden brings into focus the medicinal and food plants of the First Nations. It has several totem poles and exhibits demonstrating traditional artwork and construction methods.

The Alpine Garden has several paths winding over a rocky outcrop which is covered with tiny, delicate alpine plants.

Other gardens include the poisonous plants garden (which has samples of various poisonous plants along with information on the effects of various doses), the economic plants exhibit, the flowery brook, and an arboretum. The botanical gardens are also the home to some wildlife; primarily squirrels and ducks, other slightly less common animals such as turtles and herons also live there.

==&quot;Lion de la Feuillée&quot;==

The &quot;Lion de la Feuillée&quot; is a monument and sculpture located inside the Montreal Botanical Garden. The huge lion that lies at the entrance to the rose garden was donated by the city of Lyon on the occasion of the 350th anniversary of Montreal in 1992.

The first bridge over the Feuillée was open to the public on 28 September 1831 in the heart of the city of Lyon, France. The &quot;Feuillée Lion&quot; is one of four castings of the original work, created by . During the reconstruction of the bridge in 1910, the four lions were relocated. In 1992, one of them was brought to Montreal.

==Sport==
During the 1976 Summer Olympics, it hosted the 20 km walk athletics and the running part of the modern pentathlon event.

<doc id="607686" wikidata="Q17104967" url="?curid=607686" title="Palatini variation">
<text>In general relativity and gravitation the Palatini variation is nowadays thought of as a variation of a Lagrangian with respect to the connection.

In fact, as is well known, the Einstein–Hilbert action for general relativity was first formulated purely in terms of the spacetime metric formula_1. In the Palatini variational method one takes as independent field variables not only the ten components formula_1 but also the forty components of the affine connection formula_3, assuming, a priori, no dependence of the formula_3 from the formula_1 and their derivatives.

The reason the Palatini variation is considered important is that it means that the use of the Christoffel connection in general relativity does not have to be added as a separate assumption; the information is already in the Lagrangian. For theories of gravitation which have more complex Lagrangians than the Einstein–Hilbert Lagrangian of general relativity, the Palatini variation sometimes gives more complex connections and sometimes tensorial equations.

Attilio Palatini (1889–1949) was an Italian mathematician who received his doctorate from the University of Padova, where he studied under Levi-Civita and Ricci-Curbastro.

The history of the subject, and Palatini&#x27;s connection with it, are not straightforward (see references). In fact, it seems that what the textbooks now call &quot;Palatini formalism&quot; was actually invented in 1925 by Einstein, and as the years passed, people tended to mix up the Palatini identity and the Palatini formalism.

<doc id="607690" wikidata="Q1371213" url="?curid=607690" title="Affine connection">
<text>In differential geometry, an affine connection is a geometric object on a smooth manifold which &quot;connects&quot; nearby tangent spaces, so it permits tangent vector fields to be differentiated as if they were functions on the manifold with values in a fixed vector space. Connections are among the simplest methods of defining differentiation of the sections of vector bundles.

The notion of an affine connection has its roots in 19th-century geometry and tensor calculus, but was not fully developed until the early 1920s, by Élie Cartan (as part of his general theory of connections) and Hermann Weyl (who used the notion as a part of his foundations for general relativity). The terminology is due to Cartan and has its origins in the identification of tangent spaces in Euclidean space by translation: the idea is that a choice of affine connection makes a manifold look infinitesimally like Euclidean space not just smoothly, but as an affine space.

On any manifold of positive dimension there are infinitely many affine connections. If the manifold is further endowed with a metric tensor then there is a natural choice of affine connection, called the Levi-Civita connection. The choice of an affine connection is equivalent to prescribing a way of differentiating vector fields which satisfies several reasonable properties (linearity and the Leibniz rule). This yields a possible definition of an affine connection as a covariant derivative or (linear) connection on the tangent bundle. A choice of affine connection is also equivalent to a notion of parallel transport, which is a method for transporting tangent vectors along curves. This also defines a parallel transport on the frame bundle. Infinitesimal parallel transport in the frame bundle yields another description of an affine connection, either as a Cartan connection for the affine group or as a principal connection on the frame bundle.

The main invariants of an affine connection are its torsion and its curvature. The torsion measures how closely the Lie bracket of vector fields can be recovered from the affine connection. Affine connections may also be used to define (affine) geodesics on a manifold, generalizing the &quot;straight lines&quot; of Euclidean space, although the geometry of those straight lines can be very different from usual Euclidean geometry; the main differences are encapsulated in the curvature of the connection.

==Motivation and history==

A smooth manifold is a mathematical object which looks locally like a smooth deformation of Euclidean space : for example a smooth curve or surface looks locally like a smooth deformation of a line or a plane. Smooth functions and vector fields can be defined on manifolds, just as they can on Euclidean space, and scalar functions on manifolds can be differentiated in a natural way. However, differentiation of vector fields is less straightforward: this is a simple matter in Euclidean space, because the tangent space of based vectors at a point can be identified naturally (by translation) with the tangent space at a nearby point . On a general manifold, there is no such natural identification between nearby tangent spaces, and so tangent vectors at nearby points cannot be compared in a well-defined way. The notion of an affine connection was introduced to remedy this problem by &quot;connecting&quot; nearby tangent spaces. The origins of this idea can be traced back to two main sources: surface theory and tensor calculus.

===Motivation from surface theory===

Consider a smooth surface in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Near any point, can be approximated by its tangent plane at that point, which is an affine subspace of Euclidean space. Differential geometers in the 19th century were interested in the notion of development in which one surface was &quot;rolled&quot; along another, without &quot;slipping&quot; or &quot;twisting&quot;. In particular, the tangent plane to a point of can be rolled on : this should be easy to imagine when is a surface like the 2-sphere, which is the smooth boundary of a convex region. As the tangent plane is rolled on , the point of contact traces out a curve on . Conversely, given a curve on , the tangent plane can be rolled along that curve. This provides a way to identify the tangent planes at different points along the curve: in particular, a tangent vector in the tangent space at one point on the curve is identified with a unique tangent vector at any other point on the curve. These identifications are always given by affine transformations from one tangent plane to another.

This notion of parallel transport of tangent vectors, by affine transformations, along a curve has a characteristic feature: the point of contact of the tangent plane with the surface &quot;always moves&quot; with the curve under parallel translation (i.e., as the tangent plane is rolled along the surface, the point of contact moves). This generic condition is characteristic of Cartan connections. In more modern approaches, the point of contact is viewed as the &quot;origin&quot; in the tangent plane (which is then a vector space), and the movement of the origin is corrected by a translation, so that parallel transport is linear, rather than affine.

In the point of view of Cartan connections, however, the affine subspaces of Euclidean space are &quot;model&quot; surfaces — they are the simplest surfaces in Euclidean 3-space, and are homogeneous under the affine group of the plane — and every smooth surface has a unique model surface tangent to it at each point. These model surfaces are &quot;Klein geometries&quot; in the sense of Felix Klein&#x27;s Erlangen programme. More generally, an -dimensional affine space is a Klein geometry for the affine group , the stabilizer of a point being the general linear group . An affine -manifold is then a manifold which looks infinitesimally like -dimensional affine space.

===Motivation from tensor calculus===

The second motivation for affine connections comes from the notion of a covariant derivative of vector fields. Before the advent of coordinate-independent methods, it was necessary to work with vector fields by embedding their respective Euclidean vectors into an atlas. These components can be differentiated, but the derivatives do not transform in a manageable way under changes of coordinates. Correction terms were introduced by Elwin Bruno Christoffel (following ideas of Bernhard Riemann) in the 1870s so that the (corrected) derivative of one vector field along another transformed covariantly under coordinate transformations — these correction terms subsequently came to be known as Christoffel symbols.

This idea was developed into the theory of &quot;absolute differential calculus&quot; (now known as tensor calculus) by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and his student Tullio Levi-Civita between 1880 and the turn of the 20th century.

Tensor calculus really came to life, however, with the advent of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity in 1915. A few years after this, Levi-Civita formalized the unique connection associated to a Riemannian metric, now known as the Levi-Civita connection. More general affine connections were then studied around 1920, by Hermann Weyl, who developed a detailed mathematical foundation for general relativity, and Élie Cartan, who made the link with the geometrical ideas coming from surface theory.

===Approaches===

The complex history has led to the development of widely varying approaches to and generalizations of the affine connection concept.

The most popular approach is probably the definition motivated by covariant derivatives. On the one hand, the ideas of Weyl were taken up by physicists in the form of gauge theory and gauge covariant derivatives. On the other hand, the notion of covariant differentiation was abstracted by Jean-Louis Koszul, who defined (linear or Koszul) connections on vector bundles. In this language, an affine connection is simply a covariant derivative or (linear) connection on the tangent bundle.

However, this approach does not explain the geometry behind affine connections nor how they acquired their name. The term really has its origins in the identification of tangent spaces in Euclidean space by translation: this property means that Euclidean -space is an affine space. (Alternatively, Euclidean space is a principal homogeneous space or torsor under the group of translations, which is a subgroup of the affine group.) As mentioned in the introduction, there are several ways to make this precise: one uses the fact that an affine connection defines a notion of parallel transport of vector fields along a curve. This also defines a parallel transport on the frame bundle. Infinitesimal parallel transport in the frame bundle yields another description of an affine connection, either as a Cartan connection for the affine group or as a principal connection on the frame bundle.

==Formal definition as a differential operator==

Let be a smooth manifold and let be the space of vector fields on , that is, the space of smooth sections of the tangent bundle . Then an affine connection on is a bilinear map

: formula_1
such that for all in the set of smooth functions on , written , and all vector fields on :
# , that is, is -&quot;linear&quot; in the first variable;
# , where denotes the directional derivative; that is, satisfies &quot;Leibniz rule&quot; in the second variable.

===Elementary properties===

* It follows from property 1 above that the value of at a point depends only on the value of at and not on the value of on . It also follows from property 2 above that the value of at a point depends only on the value of on a neighbourhood of .
* If are affine connections then the value at of may be written where formula_2 is bilinear and depends smoothly on (i.e., it defines a smooth bundle homomorphism). Conversely if is an affine connection and is such a smooth bilinear bundle homomorphism (called a connection form on ) then is an affine connection.
* If is an open subset of , then the tangent bundle of is the trivial bundle . In this situation there is a canonical affine connection on : any vector field is given by a smooth function from to ; then is the vector field corresponding to the smooth function from to . Any other affine connection on may therefore be written , where is a connection form on .
* More generally, a local trivialization of the tangent bundle is a bundle isomorphism between the restriction of to an open subset of , and . The restriction of an affine connection to may then be written in the form where is a connection form on .

==Parallel transport for affine connections==


Comparison of tangent vectors at different points on a manifold is generally not a well-defined process. An affine connection provides one way to remedy this using the notion of parallel transport, and indeed this can be used to give a definition of an affine connection.

Let be a manifold with an affine connection . Then a vector field is said to be parallel if in the sense that for any vector field , . Intuitively speaking, parallel vectors have &quot;all their derivatives equal to zero&quot; and are therefore in some sense &quot;constant&quot;. By evaluating a parallel vector field at two points and , an identification between a tangent vector at and one at is obtained. Such tangent vectors are said to be parallel transports of each other.

Nonzero parallel vector fields do not, in general, exist, because the equation is a partial differential equation which is overdetermined: the integrability condition for this equation is the vanishing of the curvature of (see below). However, if this equation is restricted to a curve from to it becomes an ordinary differential equation. There is then a unique solution for any initial value of at .

More precisely, if a smooth curve parametrized by an interval and , where , then a vector field along (and in particular, the value of this vector field at ) is called the parallel transport of along if
#, for all 
Formally, the first condition means that is parallel with respect to the pullback connection on the pullback bundle . However, in a local trivialization it is a first-order system of linear ordinary differential equations, which has a unique solution for any initial condition given by the second condition (for instance, by the Picard–Lindelöf theorem).

Thus parallel transport provides a way of moving tangent vectors along a curve using the affine connection to keep them &quot;pointing in the same direction&quot; in an intuitive sense, and this provides a linear isomorphism between the tangent spaces at the two ends of the curve. The isomorphism obtained in this way will in general depend on the choice of the curve: if it does not, then parallel transport along every curve can be used to define parallel vector fields on , which can only happen if the curvature of is zero.

A linear isomorphism is determined by its action on an ordered basis or frame. Hence parallel transport can also be characterized as a way of transporting elements of the (tangent) frame bundle along a curve. In other words, the affine connection provides a lift of any curve in to a curve in .

==Formal definition on the frame bundle==
An affine connection may also be defined as a principal connection on the frame bundle or of a manifold . In more detail, is a smooth map from the tangent bundle of the frame bundle to the space of matrices (which is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of invertible matrices) satisfying two properties:
# is equivariant with respect to the action of on and ;
# for any in , where is the vector field on corresponding to .

Such a connection immediately defines a covariant derivative not only on the tangent bundle, but on vector bundles associated to any group representation of , including bundles of tensors and tensor densities. Conversely, an affine connection on the tangent bundle determines an affine connection on the frame bundle, for instance, by requiring that vanishes on tangent vectors to the lifts of curves to the frame bundle defined by parallel transport.

The frame bundle also comes equipped with a solder form which is horizontal in the sense that it vanishes on vertical vectors such as the point values of the vector fields : Indeed is defined first by projecting a tangent vector (to at a frame ) to , then by taking the components of this tangent vector on with respect to the frame . Note that is also -equivariant (where acts on by matrix multiplication).

The pair defines a bundle isomorphism of with the trivial bundle , where is the Cartesian product of and (viewed as the Lie algebra of the affine group, which is actually a semidirect product – see below).

==Affine connections as Cartan connections==
Affine connections can be defined within Cartan&#x27;s general framework. In the modern approach, this is closely related to the definition of affine connections on the frame bundle. Indeed, in one formulation, a Cartan connection is an absolute parallelism of a principal bundle satisfying suitable properties. From this point of view the -valued one-form on the frame bundle (of an affine manifold) is a Cartan connection. However, Cartan&#x27;s original approach was different from this in a number of ways:
* the concept of frame bundles or principal bundles did not exist;
* a connection was viewed in terms of parallel transport between infinitesimally nearby points;
* this parallel transport was affine, rather than linear;
* the objects being transported were not tangent vectors in the modern sense, but elements of an affine space with a marked point, which the Cartan connection ultimately &quot;identifies&quot; with the tangent space.

===Explanations and historical intuition===

The points just raised are easiest to explain in reverse, starting from the motivation provided by surface theory. In this situation, although the planes being rolled over the surface are tangent planes in a naive sense, the notion of a tangent space is really an infinitesimal notion, whereas the planes, as affine subspaces of , are infinite in extent. However these affine planes all have a marked point, the point of contact with the surface, and they are tangent to the surface at this point. The confusion therefore arises because an affine space with a marked point can be identified with its tangent space at that point. However, the parallel transport defined by rolling does not fix this origin: it is affine rather than linear; the linear parallel transport can be recovered by applying a translation.

Abstracting this idea, an affine manifold should therefore be an -manifold with an affine space , of dimension , &quot;attached&quot; to each at a marked point , together with a method for transporting elements of these affine spaces along any curve in . This method is required to satisfy several properties:
# for any two points on , parallel transport is an affine transformation from to ;
# parallel transport is defined infinitesimally in the sense that it is differentiable at any point on and depends only on the tangent vector to at that point;
# the derivative of the parallel transport at determines a linear isomorphism from to .

These last two points are quite hard to make precise, so affine connections are more often defined infinitesimally. To motivate this, it suffices to consider how affine frames of reference transform infinitesimally with respect to parallel transport. (This is the origin of Cartan&#x27;s method of moving frames.) An affine frame at a point consists of a list , where and the form a basis of . The affine connection is then given symbolically by a first order differential system

:formula_3

defined by a collection of one-forms . Geometrically, an affine frame undergoes a displacement travelling along a curve from to given (approximately, or infinitesimally) by

:formula_4

Furthermore, the affine spaces are required to be tangent to in the informal sense that the displacement of along can be identified (approximately or infinitesimally) with the tangent vector to at (which is the infinitesimal displacement of ). Since
:formula_5
where is defined by , this identification is given by , so the requirement is that should be a linear isomorphism at each point.

The tangential affine space is thus identified intuitively with an &quot;infinitesimal affine neighborhood&quot; of .

The modern point of view makes all this intuition more precise using principal bundles (the essential idea is to replace a frame or a &quot;variable&quot; frame by the space of all frames and functions on this space). It also draws on the inspiration of Felix Klein&#x27;s Erlangen programme, in which a &quot;geometry&quot; is defined to be a homogeneous space. Affine space is a geometry in this sense, and is equipped with a &quot;flat&quot; Cartan connection. Thus a general affine manifold is viewed as &quot;curved&quot; deformation of the flat model geometry of affine space.

===Affine space as the flat model geometry===

====Definition of an affine space====

Informally, an affine space is a vector space without a fixed choice of origin. It describes the geometry of points and free vectors in space. As a consequence of the lack of origin, points in affine space cannot be added together as this requires a choice of origin with which to form the parallelogram law for vector addition. However, a vector may be added to a point by placing the initial point of the vector at and then transporting to the terminal point. The operation thus described is the translation of along . In technical terms, affine -space is a set equipped with a free transitive action of the vector group on it through this operation of translation of points: is thus a principal homogeneous space for the vector group .
The general linear group is the group of transformations of which preserve the &quot;linear structure&quot; of in the sense that . By analogy, the affine group is the group of transformations of preserving the &quot;affine structure&quot;. Thus must &quot;preserve translations&quot; in the sense that

:formula_6

where is a general linear transformation. The map sending to is a group homomorphism. Its kernel is the group of translations . The stabilizer of any point in can thus be identified with using this projection: this realises the affine group as a semidirect product of and , and affine space as the homogeneous space .

====Affine frames and the flat affine connection====
An &quot;affine frame&quot; for consists of a point and a basis of the vector space . The general linear group acts freely on the set of all affine frames by fixing and transforming the basis in the usual way, and the map sending an affine frame to is the quotient map. Thus is a principal -bundle over . The action of extends naturally to a free transitive action of the affine group on , so that is an -torsor, and the choice of a reference frame identifies with the principal bundle .

On there is a collection of functions defined by

:formula_7

(as before) and

:formula_8

After choosing a basepoint for , these are all functions with values in , so it is possible to take their exterior derivatives to obtain differential 1-forms with values in . Since the functions yield a basis for at each point of , these 1-forms must be expressible as sums of the form

:formula_9

for some collection of real-valued one-forms on . This system of one-forms on the principal bundle defines the affine connection on .

Taking the exterior derivative a second time, and using the fact that as well as the linear independence of the , the following relations are obtained:

:formula_10

These are the Maurer–Cartan equations for the Lie group (identified with by the choice of a reference frame). Furthermore:
* the Pfaffian system (for all ) is integrable, and its integral manifolds are the fibres of the principal bundle . 
* the Pfaffian system (for all ) is also integrable, and its integral manifolds define parallel transport in .

Thus the forms define a flat principal connection on .

For a strict comparison with the motivation, one should actually define parallel transport in a principal -bundle over . This can be done by pulling back by the smooth map defined by translation. Then the composite is a principal -bundle over , and the forms pull back to give a flat principal -connection on this bundle.

===General affine geometries: formal definitions===

An affine space, as with essentially any smooth Klein geometry, is a manifold equipped with a flat Cartan connection. More general affine manifolds or affine geometries are obtained easily by dropping the flatness condition expressed by the Maurer-Cartan equations. There are several ways to approach the definition and two will be given. Both definitions are facilitated by the realisation that 1-forms in the flat model fit together to give a 1-form with values in the Lie algebra of the affine group .

In these definitions, is a smooth -manifold and is an affine space of the same dimension.

====Definition via absolute parallelism====

Let be a manifold, and a principal -bundle over . Then an affine connection is a 1-form on with values in satisfying the following properties
# is equivariant with respect to the action of on and ;
# for all in the Lie algebra of all matrices;
# is a linear isomorphism of each tangent space of with .
The last condition means that is an absolute parallelism on , i.e., it identifies the tangent bundle of with a trivial bundle (in this case ). The pair defines the structure of an affine geometry on , making it into an affine manifold.

The affine Lie algebra splits as a semidirect product of and and so may be written as a pair where takes values in and takes values in . Conditions 1 and 2 are equivalent to being a principal -connection and being a horizontal equivariant 1-form, which induces a bundle homomorphism from to the associated bundle . Condition 3 is equivalent to the fact that this bundle homomorphism is an isomorphism. (However, this decomposition is a consequence of the rather special structure of the affine group.) Since is the frame bundle of , it follows that provides a bundle isomorphism between and the frame bundle of ; this recovers the definition of an affine connection as a principal -connection on .

The 1-forms arising in the flat model are just the components of and .

====Definition as a principal affine connection====
An affine connection on is a principal -bundle over , together with a principal -subbundle of and a principal -connection (a 1-form on with values in ) which satisfies the following (generic) &quot;Cartan condition&quot;. The component of pullback of to is a horizontal equivariant 1-form and so defines a bundle homomorphism from to : this is required to be an isomorphism.

====Relation to the motivation====
Since acts on , there is, associated to the principal bundle , a bundle , which is a fiber bundle over whose fiber at in is an affine space . A section of (defining a marked point in for each ) determines a principal -subbundle of (as the bundle of stabilizers of these marked points) and vice versa. The principal connection defines an Ehresmann connection on this bundle, hence a notion of parallel transport. The Cartan condition ensures that the distinguished section always moves under parallel transport.

==Further properties==

===Curvature and torsion===

Curvature and torsion are the main invariants of an affine connection. As there are many equivalent ways to define the notion of an affine connection, so there are many different ways to define curvature and torsion.

From the Cartan connection point of view, the curvature is the failure of the affine connection to satisfy the Maurer–Cartan equation

:formula_11

where the second term on the left hand side is the wedge product using the Lie bracket in to contract the values. By expanding into the pair and using the structure of the Lie algebra , this left hand side can be expanded into the two formulae

:formula_12

where the wedge products are evaluated using matrix multiplication. The first expression is called the torsion of the connection, and the second is also called the curvature.

These expressions are differential 2-forms on the total space of a frame bundle. However, they are horizontal and equivariant, and hence define tensorial objects. These can be defined directly from the induced covariant derivative on as follows.

The torsion is given by the formula

:formula_13

If the torsion vanishes, the connection is said to be &quot;torsion-free&quot; or &quot;symmetric&quot;.

The curvature is given by the formula

:formula_14

Note that is the Lie bracket of vector fields

:formula_15

in Einstein notation. This is independent of coordinate system choice and

: formula_16

the tangent vector at point of the th coordinate curve. The are a natural basis for the tangent space at point , and the the corresponding coordinates for the vector field .

When both curvature and torsion vanish, the connection defines a pre-Lie algebra structure on the space of global sections of the tangent bundle.

===The Levi-Civita connection===
If is a Riemannian manifold then there is a unique affine connection on with the following two properties:
* the connection is torsion-free, i.e., is zero, so that ;
* parallel transport is an isometry, i.e., the inner products (defined using ) between tangent vectors are preserved.
This connection is called the Levi-Civita connection.

The term &quot;symmetric&quot; is often used instead of torsion-free for the first property. The second condition means that the connection is a metric connection in the sense that the Riemannian metric is parallel: . For a torsion-free connection, the condition is equivalent to the identity +
, &quot;compatibility with the metric&quot;. In local coordinates the components of the form are called Christoffel symbols: because of the uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection, there is a formula for these components in terms of the components of .

===Geodesics===
Since straight lines are a concept in affine geometry, affine connections define a generalized notion of (parametrized) straight lines on any affine manifold, called affine geodesics. Abstractly, a parametric curve is a straight line if its tangent vector remains parallel and equipollent with itself when it is transported along . From the linear point of view, an affine connection distinguishes the affine geodesics in the following way: a smooth curve is an affine geodesic if formula_17 is parallel transported along , that is
:formula_18
where is the parallel transport map defining the connection.

In terms of the infinitesimal connection , the derivative of this equation implies
:formula_19
for all .

Conversely, any solution of this differential equation yields a curve whose tangent vector is parallel transported along the curve. For every and every , there exists a unique affine geodesic with and and where is the maximal open interval in , containing 0, on which the geodesic is defined. This follows from the Picard–Lindelöf theorem, and allows for the definition of an exponential map associated to the affine connection.

In particular, when is a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold and is the Levi-Civita connection, then the affine geodesics are the usual geodesics of Riemannian geometry and are the locally distance minimizing curves.

The geodesics defined here are sometimes called affinely parametrized, since a given straight line in determines a parametric curve through the line up to a choice of affine reparametrization , where and are constants. The tangent vector to an affine geodesic is parallel and equipollent along itself. An unparametrized geodesic, or one which is merely parallel along itself without necessarily being equipollent, need only satisfy

:formula_20

for some function defined along . Unparametrized geodesics are often studied from the point of view of projective connections.

===Development===

An affine connection defines a notion of development of curves. Intuitively, development captures the notion that if is a curve in , then the affine tangent space at may be &quot;rolled&quot; along the curve. As it does so, the marked point of contact between the tangent space and the manifold traces out a curve in this affine space: the development of .

In formal terms, let be the linear parallel transport map associated to the affine connection. Then the development is the curve in starts off at 0 and is parallel to the tangent of for all time :
:formula_21

In particular, is a &quot;geodesic&quot; if and only if its development is an affinely parametrized straight line in .

==Surface theory revisited==
If is a surface in , it is easy to see that has a natural affine connection. From the linear connection point of view, the covariant derivative of a vector field is defined by differentiating the vector field, viewed as a map from to , and then projecting the result orthogonally back onto the tangent spaces of . It is easy to see that this affine connection is torsion-free. Furthermore, it is a metric connection with respect to the Riemannian metric on induced by the inner product on , hence it is the Levi-Civita connection of this metric.

===Example: the unit sphere in Euclidean space===
Let be the usual scalar product on , and let be the unit sphere. The tangent space to at a point is naturally identified with the vector subspace of consisting of all vectors orthogonal to . It follows that a vector field on can be seen as a map which satisfies

: formula_22

Denote as the differential (Jacobian matrix) of such a map. Then we have:

:Lemma. The formula
::formula_23
:defines an affine connection on with vanishing torsion.

:::Proof. It is straightforward to prove that satisfies the Leibniz identity and is linear in the first variable. So all that needs to be proved here is that the map above does indeed define a tangent vector field. That is, we need to prove that for all in

<doc id="607691" wikidata="Q324764" url="?curid=607691" title="Bruce Kulick">
<text>Bruce Howard Kulick (; born December 12, 1953) is an American guitarist best known as a former guitarist of the band Kiss (19841996). He was also a member of Union with John Corabi from 19972002, Blackjack from 19791980 and Grand Funk Railroad from 20002023.

Kulick has also released several solo albums, in addition to session work with various artists. He is the younger brother of guitarist Bob Kulick.

== Early life and family ==
Kulick was born in Brooklyn, New York City and lived in Queens for a time, graduating from Newtown High School. He is Jewish and also went to Hebrew school.

Kulick&#x27;s brother, session guitarist/producer Bob Kulick, was influential in his music career. Bob&#x27;s performance credits include W.A.S.P., Meat Loaf&#x27;s touring band, and Kiss.

== Career ==
=== Early projects ===
Bruce&#x27;s first band KKB, was formed in 1974. Its other members were his childhood friends Mike Katz and Guy Bois (the other K and B of KKB, respectively) and Kulick likened its sound to that of Cream. Kulick found the master tape from those sessions in 2008 and issued it via limited edition CD, available during his appearances at Kiss expos and via his website. In an interview from 2008, Kulick also discussed his lifelong love of &quot;Star Wars&quot; and its historical similarities to Kiss.

He first began touring professionally with George McCrae and Andrea True.

=== Meat Loaf ===

In 1977, following the release of Meat Loaf&#x27;s first album &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, Kulick played rhythm guitar/lead guitar on tour with Meat Loaf&#x27;s band alongside his brother Bob on lead guitar/rhythm guitar. The success of the year-long tour took the Kulick brothers around the world. In addition to the success of the tour, many famous television appearances were done, such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;.

=== Blackjack ===
Kulick was a member of the band Blackjack, with Michael Bolton, during the band&#x27;s short existence from 1979 to 1980. He also played on several Bolton solo albums. (Bolton later co-wrote the Kiss song &quot;Forever&quot;, from &quot;Hot in the Shade&quot;).

&quot;Stay&quot;, a Blackjack song co-written by Kulick and Bolton, was sampled by rapper Jay-Z for the song &quot;A Dream&quot; off his 2002 album &quot;The Blueprint 2: The Gift &amp; the Curse&quot; which reached #1 on the Billboard charts.

=== The Good Rats ===
Kulick joined the Long Island-based band the Good Rats in 1981, and is on their album, &quot;Great American Music&quot;.

=== Michael Bolton ===
In 1983, Bruce was asked to join Michael Bolton as his guitarist for his debut album release tour, after Bolton anglicizing his family name from Bolotin.

=== Kiss (1984–1996) ===

Kulick joined the rock band Kiss in September 1984 as the lead guitarist, replacing Mark St. John, who left the band after being diagnosed with reactive arthritis. St. John later confessed that this medical condition had been a cover story, saying &quot;The arthritis thing was really a cover up for the other reasons, you know what I&#x27;m trying to say?&quot;. Kulick, who remained with Kiss until 1996, and St. John are the only two members of Kiss never to have worn makeup or costumes in the band, although it is rumored that Gene Simmons’s step-niece has come up with unofficial designs for both of them which have garnered approval.

Kulick played on five Kiss studio albums: &quot;Asylum&quot; (1985), &quot;Crazy Nights&quot; (1987), &quot;Hot in the Shade&quot; (1989), &quot;Revenge&quot; (1992) and &quot;Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions&quot; (1997); he also appeared on &quot;Alive III&quot; and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. The song &quot;I Walk Alone&quot;, from &quot;Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions&quot;, is the only Kiss track to feature Kulick as lead vocalist. Kulick is featured on more than twenty Kiss releases.

When the original members of the band regrouped, starting in 1995 with the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; special that carried over into re-adopting their make-up and costuming for the Alive/Worldwide Tour in 1996, Kulick and Eric Singer were paid weekly during the tour; while &quot;sidelined&quot; from Kiss, both were allowed to do other projects as long as Simmons and Stanley okayed them. Kulick officially left Kiss in December 1996. When Ace Frehley again left Kiss (in 2002, after the Kiss Farewell Tour), Kulick was not asked to rejoin, as Simmons and Stanley thought that Tommy Thayer (former Black &#x27;n Blue guitarist and Kiss tour manager) could capture/copy Frehley&#x27;s persona better than Kulick; however, Kulick continued to work with Kiss after his departure, contributing work to the &quot;Psycho Circus&quot; album. Kulick briefly rejoined the band on Kiss Kruise 2021 and played on 2 songs, Tears Are Falling and Heaven&#x27;s on Fire.

=== Union ===
Soon after leaving Kiss, Kulick formed the band Union with John Corabi, Brent Fitz, and Jamie Hunting in 1996. Corabi and Kulick wrote what would become the first album, the self-titled &quot;Union&quot;, which was released in 1998. They proceeded with a nationwide acoustic tour to promote the album, featuring just Corabi and Kulick (both on guitar). Soon the full band went on a world tour headlining small venues in support of the album. Their second album 1999&#x27;s &quot;Live in the Galaxy&quot;, was a live recording with two acoustic tracks recorded in a mobile studio. The third Union album was &quot;The Blue Room&quot; (2000).

=== Grand Funk Railroad ===

Kulick was the lead guitarist for Grand Funk Railroad from 2000–2023. Kulick had originally met Grand Funk Railroad drummer Don Brewer when Brewer was performing with Bob Seger during the 1983 tour with Michael Bolton. Following their December 14, 2023 concert in Marietta, Ohio, Kulick departed Grand Funk Railroad.

=== Solo work ===
Kulick has released three solo albums: &quot;Audiodog&quot; in 2001, &quot;Transformer&quot; in 2003, and most recently &quot;BK3&quot;, which was released on February 2, 2010.

=== Other work ===

Kulick earned a writing credit on the song &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; on the 2004 Kanye West album, &quot;The College Dropout&quot;.

Kulick has also appeared on all album releases by Eric Singer&#x27;s solo project ESP (Eric Singer Project): &quot;Lost and Spaced&quot; (1998), &quot;ESP&quot; (1999), and &quot;Eric Singer Project: Live in Tokyo&quot; (2006). Kulick also appeared on the DVD &quot;Eric Singer Project: Live at the Marquee&quot; (2006), which was filmed live in Australia.

Kulick appears on the Lordi March 2006 album &quot;The Arockalypse&quot;, playing lead guitar on the song &quot;It Snows in Hell&quot;.

Kulick appears on Paul Stanley&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Live to Win&quot;, playing bass.

Kulick cut a guest guitar solo for the track &quot;The Edge of the Razor&quot; (featured on the album &quot;Emotional Coma&quot;) by Swedish metal group Lion&#x27;s Share.

== Personal life ==
On October 16, 2003, Kulick was shot twice by stray bullets on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles California. Bruce is married to Lisa Lane Kulick. They met in 2008, and were married in 2014. They often perform together at events and online. In his spare time, he&#x27;s been working on an autobiography that he says will offer a &quot;really in-depth discussion of his life as a musician.&quot;

<text>The Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat major, Op. 73, known as the Emperor Concerto in English-speaking countries, is a piano concerto composed by Ludwig van Beethoven. Beethoven composed the concerto in 1809 under salary in Vienna, and he dedicated it to Archduke Rudolf, who was his patron, friend, and pupil. Its public premiere was on 28 November 1811 in Leipzig, with Friedrich Schneider as the soloist and Johann Philipp Christian Schulz conducting the Gewandhaus Orchestra. Beethoven, usually the soloist, could not perform due to declining hearing.

The work&#x27;s military aspects and symbolism characterize its heroic style. Beethoven used novel approaches with the piece, such as beginning the solo entrance without orchestral introduction, lengthening the concerto, and creating a new relationship between piano and orchestra. The first of its three movements, Allegro, is in sonata form and is longer than any opening movement of Beethoven&#x27;s earlier piano concertos. The second movement, Adagio un poco mosso, is a nocturne that directly builds into the third movement. The last movement, Rondo: Allegro ma non troppo, is in seven-part rondo form. The concerto is approximately forty minutes.

The origin of the epithet &quot;Emperor&quot; is uncertain; it may have been coined by Johann Baptist Cramer, the English publisher of the concerto. The concerto has no association with any emperor, and according to Donald Tovey and Betsy Schwarm, Beethoven would have disliked it due to his disapproval of Napoleon&#x27;s conquest. As part of his repertoire, Franz Liszt frequently performed the concerto throughout his life. Since 1912, it has been recorded numerous times by classical pianists.

== Background ==
Beethoven&#x27;s return to Vienna from Heiligenstadt in 1802 marked a change in musical style and is now often designated as the start of his middle or &quot;heroic&quot; period characterized by many original works composed on a grand scale. In the autumn of 1808, after being rejected for a position at the Royal Theatre, Beethoven received an offer from Napoleon&#x27;s brother Jérôme Bonaparte, the king of Westphalia, for a well-paid position as Kapellmeister at the court in Cassel. To persuade him to stay in Vienna, Archduke Rudolf, Prince Kinsky, and Prince Lobkowitz pledged to pay him a pension of 4000 florins a year. Archduke Rudolf paid his share of the salary on the agreed date. Kinsky, immediately called to military duty, did not contribute and died in November 1812 after falling from his horse. When the Austrian currency destabilized in 1811, Lobkowitz went bankrupt. To benefit from the agreement, Beethoven had to obtain recourse from the law, which in 1815 brought him some payment.

Beethoven felt the Napoleonic Wars reaching Vienna in early 1809 and completed writing the piano concerto in April while Vienna was under siege by Napoleon&#x27;s armies. He wrote to his publisher in July 1809 that there was &quot;nothing but drums, cannons, men, misery of all sorts&quot; around him. To save his hearing, he fled to his brother&#x27;s cellar and covered his ears with pillows. The work&#x27;s heroic style reflects the war-ridden era in its military topics and heroic tone. Beethoven experimented with new techniques, such as the piano entrance beginning earlier than typical and with a cadenza.

The concerto&#x27;s public premiere was on 28 November 1811 in Leipzig, with Friedrich Schneider as the soloist. Beethoven&#x27;s hearing loss did not prevent him from composing music, but it made playing at concerts increasingly difficult. The concerto debuted in Vienna on 12 February 1812, with Carl Czerny, Beethoven&#x27;s pupil, as the soloist. The English premiere was on 8 May 1820 with Charles Neate as soloist. Felix Mendelssohn gave an English performance on 24 June 1829. Archduke Rudolf of Austria was Beethoven&#x27;s aristocratic patron, and in 1803 or 1804, Rudolf began studying piano and composition with Beethoven. They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824. Beethoven dedicated many pieces to him, including this concerto.

The origins of the concerto&#x27;s epithet, &quot;Emperor&quot;, are obscure and no consensus exists on its origin. An unlikely and unauthenticated story says that at the first Vienna performance, a French officer said, &quot;C&#x27;est l&#x27;Empereur!&quot; Other sources say that Johann Baptist Cramer coined it. According to Donald Tovey and Betsy Schwarm, Beethoven would have disliked the epithet due to his disapproval of Napoleon&#x27;s conquest. Beethoven had previously reconsidered the dedication of his third symphony; initially dedicated to Napoleon, Beethoven changed it after Napoleon assumed the title of emperor in 1804. According to Yan Shen, musicologists agree that the concerto has no connection to an emperor.

== Music ==
=== Overview ===

The concerto is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B (clarinet 1 playing in A in movement 2), two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani in E and B, and strings. In the second movement, the 2nd flute, 2nd clarinet, trumpets, and timpani are tacet. The concerto is divided into the following three movements:

Beethoven began innovating the piano concerto genre with his third piano concerto and continued through his fifth piano concerto. While Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s piano concertos consisted of the piano and orchestra working in tandem, in Beethoven&#x27;s last two piano concertos, the pianist was the &quot;hero,&quot; the dominant and directional soloist. Also, in Mozart&#x27;s concertos, the soloist was a virtuoso and more important than the composer; in Beethoven&#x27;s, the pianist is a vector for the composer. Beethoven created the tradition of linking movements in concertos, especially the middle and the last. Subsequent composers connected and transitioned through all movements in an attempt to create unity in a piece.

=== I. Allegro ===

&lt;/score&gt;

The first movement is longer than any that Beethoven had previously composed in the piano concerto genre. Beethoven adhered to the traditional sonata form but significantly redefined the interaction between piano and orchestra. The opening cadenza precedes orchestral exposition, solo exposition, development, recapitulation, written cadenza, and a coda. Beethoven explicitly forbids the soloist from performing their own cadenza, a shift from previous piano concertos. Stephan Lindeman and William Kinderman have speculated that Beethoven wanted to control all aspects of the piece since he could not personally perform it or create a better flow without a virtuosic interruption. Following this piece, composers wrote cadenzas instead of leaving them to the performer.

The concerto opens with the orchestra offering three sonorous chords. The solo piano responds to each chord with flourishes of arpeggios, trills, and scales. This opening was new in classical concertos, and the flourishes almost became thematic.

The propulsive first theme follows, and the expository material repeats with variations, virtuoso figurations, and modified harmonies. The second theme, a march, appears first in B minor form in the strings, then thematically shifts to C-flat major by the horns. Throughout the movement, Beethoven transforms these themes into a range of keys, moods, and figurations. Following the opening, the movement follows Beethoven&#x27;s three-theme sonata structure for a concerto. The orchestral exposition is a two-theme sonata exposition. The second exposition with the piano introduces a triumphant, virtuosic third theme that belongs solely to the solo instrument, a trademark of Beethoven&#x27;s concertos. The coda elaborates upon the open-ended first theme, building intensity before finishing with a final climactic arrival at the tonic E major.

=== II. Adagio un poco mosso ===
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;string ensemble 1&quot;
 \key b \major \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 60
 dis2(\p cis4 dis |
 b4 e cis2) |
 fis4 fis( gis ais |
 b4 dis, cis2) |
&lt;/score&gt;

The second movement in B major forms a quiet nocturne for the solo piano, muted strings, and wind instruments that converse with the solo piano. The movement briefly changes to D major, a very remote key from the concerto&#x27;s E major. The third movement begins without interruption when a lone bassoon note B drops a semitone to B, the dominant of the tonic key E. The end of the second movement builds directly into the third.

Beethoven uses B major as a “surprise” key for abrupt distant key relationships. This resolves to B in the transition to the last movement.

=== III. Rondo: Allegro ma non troppo ===
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&quot; {
 \key es \major \time 6/8 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 150

&lt;/score&gt;

Like the Appassionata sonata and the Violin Concerto, the score is notated with &quot;attacca&quot; to indicate little to no break with the previous movement which did not end with complete closure.

The final movement of the concerto is a seven-part rondo form (ABACABA). The solo piano introduces the main theme before the orchestra affirms the soloist&#x27;s statement. The rondo&#x27;s B-section begins with piano scales before the orchestra again responds. The C-section is much longer, presenting the theme from the A-section in three different keys before the piano performs a passage of arpeggios. Rather than finishing with a strong entrance from the orchestra, the trill ending the cadenza dies away until the introductory theme reappears, played first by the piano and then the orchestra. In the last section, the theme undergoes variation before the concerto ends with a short cadenza and robust orchestral response.

== Reception ==
Contemporary reception was positive, with reviews praising its originality and beauty. One review said: Criticism fell on the concerto&#x27;s length, saying that its duration took away from its beauty.

According to Betsy Schwarm, the piece was a favorite of Franz Liszt. Liszt frequently performed the concerto throughout his life, including at an 1841 performance with Hector Berlioz conducting, at the unveiling of the Beethoven Monument in 1845, and at an 1877 all-Beethoven concert with Ferruccio Busoni in attendance. At the 1877 concert, Liszt played with nine fingers because of an injury to his left hand. Eleven-year-old Busoni was &quot;bitterly disappointed&quot; at his performance but was the only one who noticed.

The musicologist Alfred Einstein described the concerto as &quot;the apotheosis of the military concept.&quot; He believed it was the sister work of Eroica because it evokes imagery of an emperor such as Napoleon. Alfred Brendel said it has &quot;a grand and radiant vision, a noble vision of freedom.&quot; In the 1860 edition of his biography of Beethoven, Anton Schindler wrote that the concerto was &quot;the summit of all concerto music ever written.&quot; Joseph Kerman stated it was a &quot;triumph&quot;. , it was the most performed piano concerto at Carnegie Hall, with 215 performances.

== Recordings ==
On 2 October 1912, Frank La Forge recorded the adagio movement with a studio orchestra for the Victor Talking Machine Company; the recording was issued as Victor 55030-A. In 1922, Frederic Lamond made the first complete recording with the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra under Eugene Goossens. In 1945, Walter Gieseking made a stereophonic tape recording for German radio with the Grosses Funkorchester under Artur Rother. It is one of the earliest stereo recordings and one of about 300 such recordings made during the war, of which five survived. During the quiet passages, anti-aircraft weapons can be heard. As part of complete recordings of Beethoven&#x27;s piano concertos, Piano Concerto No. 5 was recorded by Claudio Arrau in 1958, Wilhelm Kempff in 1961, Vladimir Ashkenazy in 1972, Alicia de Larrocha in 1983, Hélène Grimaud in 2006, and Glenn Gould. Other recordings were done by Alfred Brendel in 1976, Friedrich Gulda in 1971, and Murray Perahia in 1986.

<doc id="607726" wikidata="Q169969" url="?curid=607726" title="String Quartet No. 11 (Beethoven)">
<text>Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s String Quartet No. 11 in F minor, Op. 95, from 1810, was his last before his late string quartets. It is commonly referred to as the &quot;Serioso,&quot; stemming from his title &quot;Quartett[o] Serioso&quot; at the beginning and the tempo designation for the third movement.

It is one of the shortest and most compact of all the Beethoven quartets, and shares a tonality (F) with the first and last quartets Beethoven published (Op. 18, no. 1, and Op. 135). In character and key, as well as in the presence of a final frenetic section in the parallel major, it is related to another composition of Beethoven&#x27;s middle period — the overture to his incidental music for Goethe&#x27;s drama &quot;Egmont&quot;, which he was composing in the same year he was working on this quartet.

The autograph manuscript for this quartet is inscribed &quot;October 1810&quot;, but the paper on which it appears does not match the variety Beethoven is known to have used at that time. It is more likely that he finished it several months later. It premiered in 1814 and appeared in print two years later, dedicated to Nikolaus Zmeskall. Beethoven stated in a letter to George Smart that &quot;The Quartet [Op. 95] is written for a small circle of connoisseurs and is never to be performed in public.&quot; Upon listening to the piece, it becomes apparent why he made that assertion. This piece would have been quite out of character in 1810: it is an experiment on compositional techniques the composer would draw on later in his life. (Techniques such as shorter developments, interesting use of silences, metric ambiguity, seemingly unrelated outbursts and more freedom with tonality in his sonata form.)

The historical picture of this time period helps to put the piece in context. Napoleon had invaded Vienna in May 1809 (&quot;see Battle of Wagram&quot;) for the second time in four years, and this upset Beethoven greatly. All of his aristocratic friends had fled Vienna, but Beethoven stayed and dramatically complained about the loud bombings.

==Form==
The quartet is in four movements:

===I. Allegro con brio===
This movement is in sonata form.

==== Exposition (bars 1–59) ====
&quot;1st tonal area, F minor&quot; (bars 1–21): Neapolitan (G chord) important (bar 6, 19); the Neapolitan appears in root position, not its normal first inversion, and the large-scale tritone motion of the bass voice (from G in bar 6 to C in bar 10) again emphasises the strident nature of this movement. It ends on a half cadence on the downbeat of bar 21.

&quot;Transition&quot; (bar 21–23): The unison C on the downbeat of bar 21 (V of F minor) is reinterpreted immediately as the leading tone to the second tonal area, D major. A very short transitional phrase solidifies the move to D major.

&quot;2nd tonal area, D major&quot; (bars 24–57): This is signified by a two-bar-long lyrical melody first stated in the viola, then passing through the cello and second violin, then cello again. A long V of D (bars 32–37) is unexpectedly resolved to A major, which is simply a deceptive V–VI cadence (VI of D major would be B, here enharmonically respelled as A). The A-major chord is also V of the Neapolitan (II in D major would be E, enharmonically respelled as D). This V–I motion of the Neapolitan is explicitly stated by the quartet in unison in bar 39. Bars 40–43 return to the lyrical nature of the second theme and solidify D major. A modified counterstatement of this entire gesture occurs, landing us on an even more explicit use of the Neapolitan, again enharmonically respelled as D, in bars 49–50.

&quot;Closing&quot; (bars 58–59): There is no repeat of this already very short exposition, which adds to the startling nature of this piece as a whole.

====Development (bars 60–81)====

The expected dominant pedal occurs beginning in bar 77, but the C prolongation is an upper pedal in the first violin.

====Recapitulation (bars 82–128)====

The &quot;1st theme&quot; is shorter this time (4 bars is all).

The three-bar &quot;transitional phrase&quot; reappears (bars 86–88) but is not recomposed as would be expected. We are again taken to D major.

The &quot;2nd theme&quot; begins in D major again, but returns to the tonic major (F major) beginning in bar 93. The move to a D-major chord in measure 107 corresponds to the similar passage in bar 49, but here the D-major chord functions as a V/ii, which initiates a circle-of-fifths progression (D–G–C–F), arriving on F in bar 112.

====Coda (bars 129–end)====

Begins in VI (D major): Primary scalar motive of the beginning is developed. This coda is shorter than one might expect considering the already short development.

As Arnold Schoenberg notes in an essay reprinted in the collection &quot;Style and Idea&quot;, most of the themes and events of this movement – and the main theme of the second movement – contain some form of the motive D–C–D–E found in the second bar, even if transposed and changed in some way.

===II. Allegretto ma non troppo===
This movement is in D major, a startling and remote key from the F-minor first movement. The form is AB | BA.
: A (bars 1–34)
: B (bars 35–64): &quot;Fugato&quot; section. It eventually falls apart.
: |: The descending scalar cello leads through ever modulating tonalities starting a tritone away from the opening scale.
: B&#x27; (bars 77–112)
: A&#x27; (bars 112–183): The melody is now an octave higher

===III. Allegro assai vivace ma serioso===
This movement is in scherzo form, as typical in the third movement position. Although because of the very odd tempo marking Maynard Solomon warns against calling it a scherzo, preferring the phrase &quot;march-trio&quot;.
: Scherzo (bars 1–40, with a repeat)
: Trio (bars 41–102)
: Scherzo (bars 103–144)
: Trio (bars 145–182)
: Scherzo (bars 183–206): This time the tempo increases (&quot;Più Allegro&quot;)

===IV. Larghetto espressivo; Allegretto agitato; Allegro===
This is in sonata rondo form. In a sonata-rondo, the piece follows the thematic outline of a rondo (ABACABA), and the tonal outline of a sonata (I V I or i III i, etc.). Beethoven uses Mozart&#x27;s favourite rondo form for this movement (ABACBA). The absence of the A theme in between the C and second B is a surprise and adds interest by reducing the repetition of the A theme.
: Intro, F minor (bars 1–9) (&quot;Larghetto expressivo&quot;)
: A, F minor (bars 10–32) (&quot;Allegretto agitato&quot;): It might be prudent to note that the &quot;missing A&quot; from the typical rondo-sonata form could be analysed as being shifted from its &quot;rightful&quot; place after &quot;C&quot; to a more intriguing place in bar 23.
: B, C minor (bars 32–50)
: A&#x27;, F minor (bars 51–64)
: C (bars 65–82)
: B&#x27; (bars 82–97): Here is where the sonata part of sonata-rondo comes in. This time it is in F minor instead of C minor.
: A&#x27;, F minor (bars 98–132)
: Coda, F major (bars 133–175) (&quot;Allegro&quot;): The light and bouncy ending is in sharp contrast to the dark, stormy, introspective mood of the rest of the quartet. Of this, Basil Lam said: this &quot;comic-opera ending, [is] absurdly and deliberately unrelated to the &#x27;quartett serioso&#x27; – the true Shakespearean touch that provides the final confirmation of the truth of the rest.&quot;

==Arrangements==
Gustav Mahler arranged this quartet for string orchestra, mostly by doubling some of the cello parts with double basses.

<text>Cocktail is a 1988 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Roger Donaldson from a screenplay by Heywood Gould, and based on Gould&#x27;s book of the same name. It stars Tom Cruise, Bryan Brown and Elisabeth Shue. It tells the story of a business student, who takes up bartending in order to make ends meet.

Released on July 29, 1988, by Buena Vista Pictures (under its adult film label Touchstone Pictures), &quot;Cocktail&quot; features an original music score composed by J. Peter Robinson. Despite earning overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, and winning the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture, the film was a huge box office success, grossing more than $170 million worldwide against a budget of $20 million, becoming the eighth highest-grossing film of 1988.

==Plot==

Cocky Brian Flanagan, recently discharged from the army, heads home to New York City, hoping to land a high-powered business job. He fails and instead works as a bartender while attending business school.

Doug Coughlin, an older and experienced bartender, takes Brian under his wing and teaches him flair bartending. Doug shares his idea for a nationwide chain of bars called Cocktails &amp; Dreams. Brian drops out of business school, and they become popular bartenders at a trendy nightclub.

Their flairing act attracts Coral, a wealthy photographer, and she and Brian start dating. Doug bets Brian that the relationship will not last and, unbeknownst to Brian, seduces Coral. When Brian finds out, he and Doug fight and dissolve their partnership.

Two years later, Brian is working at a beachside bar in Jamaica, hoping to save enough money for his own establishment. He meets artist Jordan Mooney and they begin a passionate relationship. Doug shows up, married to the wealthy, flirtatious and much younger Kerry, and bets Brian that he cannot attract Bonnie, a wealthy older woman. Brian accepts his challenge and wins Bonnie over. Jordan is devastated when she spots Brian and Bonnie drunkenly walking to Bonnie&#x27;s hotel room. The next morning, Brian regrets the fling and seeks out Jordan, only to find she returned to the United States.
Brian returns to New York with Bonnie, hoping her influence will help get him the corporate job. He soon feels marginalized and resents her lifestyle. While attending an art exhibit, Brian has an altercation with the artist in front of Bonnie&#x27;s friends, leading them to break up.

Brian tries to reconcile with Jordan, who angrily refuses. When calmer, she reveals she is pregnant with his child and does not want him in her life, not wanting to be hurt again. Brian tries again to talk to Jordan, but a neighbor says she moved into her parents’ upscale Park Avenue apartment. Jordan&#x27;s father, Richard, tries to pay Brian off, but he refuses. Jordan explains that she hid her family&#x27;s wealth because she wanted him to love her for herself. To prove how little he cares about money, he tears up her father&#x27;s check and leaves.

Brian finds Doug on his yacht and believes he has finally achieved the financial success they both sought. However, Doug tells him that when his business began to fail, he invested all of Kerry&#x27;s money in commodities and lost her entire wealth.

When Brian takes Kerry back to her apartment, she says she is bored with marriage and tries to seduce him, but he rebuffs her. He goes to Doug&#x27;s boat and finds him dead from suicide. Kerry later mails Brian a letter that Doug left him, explaining that his life was a fraud.

Distraught, but determined to win Jordan over, Brian tries to visit her, but is stopped by security who have been instructed by Jordan&#x27;s father not to admit him. He fights his way up to the apartment, tells Jordan about Doug&#x27;s death, and says he does not want to make the same mistake by being too proud to ask for help. He says his Uncle Pat has given him a loan to start his own bar and confidently predicts that he will be successful.

Jordan hesitates, but Brian declares he loves her and wants to marry her. She agrees to take him back, but Richard interferes, leading to scuffle with a security guard. As they leave, Richard threatens that they are on their own, which Brians says he prefers.

Brian and Jordan marry. Brian achieves his goal of opening his own bar, Flanagan&#x27;s Cocktails &amp; Dreams, with dreams of nation-wide franchises. At the grand opening, Jordan whispers that she is expecting twins. To celebrate, and to his Uncle&#x27;s dismay, he proclaims that drinks are on the house.

===Script===
The film was based on Heywood Gould&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novel published in 1984. Gould had worked as a bartender in New York from 1969 to 1981 to support his writing career. Gould said he &quot;met a lot of interesting people behind the bar and very rarely was it someone who started out wanting to be a bartender. They all had ambitions, some smoldering and some completely forgotten or suppressed.&quot;

Gould says the lead character &quot;is a composite of a lot of people I met, including myself in those days. I was in my late 30s, and I was drinking pretty good, and I was starting to feel like I was missing the boat. The character in the book is an older guy who has been around and starting to feel that he&#x27;s pretty washed-up.&quot;

Universal bought the film rights and Gould wrote the script, changing it from his novel. He says the studio put the project in turnaround &quot;because I wasn&#x27;t making the character likable enough.&quot; Disney picked up the project &quot;and I went through the same process with them. I would fight them at every turn, and there was a huge battle over making the lead younger, which I eventually did.&quot;

Gould later admitted that the people who wanted him to make changes &quot;were correct. They wanted movie characters. Characters who were upbeat and who were going to have a happy ending and a possible future in their lives. That&#x27;s what you want for a big commercial Hollywood movie. So I tried to walk that thin line between giving them what they wanted and not completely betraying the whole arena of saloons in general.&quot;

Tom Cruise expressed interest in playing the role, which helped get it financed. Rob Lowe auditioned for the role of Brian Flanagan.

&quot;There were a lot of bartenders around like Tom Cruise, younger guys who came on and were doing this for a while—and then 10 years later, still doing it,&quot; said Gould. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t as if I was betraying the character. It was a matter of making the character more idealistic, more hopeful—he&#x27;s got his life ahead of him. He turns on the charm, without the cynical bitter edge of the older guys.&quot;

Bryan Brown later said the original script &quot;was one of the very best screenplays I had ever read. Very dark... about the cult of celebrity and everything about it... Tom Cruise is a very sweet man, he was then and still is. But when Tom came in, the movie had to change. The studio made the changes to protect the star and it became a much slighter movie because of it.&quot;

===Casting===
Bryan Brown was cast on the strength of his performance in &quot;F/X&quot;.

===Production===
Gould says the tricks involving throwing bottles was not in the book, but something he showed Cruise and Bryan Brown. They used it and it became a prominent feature of the film.

During the love scene between Coral and Brian, when Cruise grabbed Gershon&#x27;s stomach she accidentally struck him in the nose with her knee.

The film used various locations along the North Shore of Jamaica, featuring such real-life locations as the Jamaica Inn, Dunn‘s River Falls, Dragon Bay Beach and the Sandals Royal Plantation.

===Post production===
A music score was originally done by Maurice Jarre. A new score was added at the last minute.

Kelly Lynch later said the film &quot;was actually a really complicated story about the &#x27;80s and power and money, and it was really re-edited where they completely lost my character&#x27;s backstory—her low self-esteem, who her father was, why she was this person that she was—but it was obviously a really successful movie, if not as good as it could&#x27;ve been.&quot; She claimed Disney reshot &quot;about a third of the film... and turned it into flipping the bottles and this and that... But we had a really great time. And Tom was so much fun, just a ball to work with, both on and off camera.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Cocktail&quot; earned $78.2 million at the North American box office, and $93.3 million international to a total of $171.5 million worldwide, almost nine times its $20 million budget, and ranking as the eighth highest-grossing film of 1988 worldwide.

===Critical response===
Despite its box office success, &quot;Cocktail&quot; received negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 9% of 45 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 4.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;There are no surprises in &quot;Cocktail&quot;, a shallow, dramatically inert romance that squanders Tom Cruise&#x27;s talents in what amounts to a naive barkeep&#x27;s banal fantasy.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a 12 out of 100 score based on 14 reviews, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a negative review, calling it &quot;an upscale, utterly brainless variation on those efficient old B-movies of the 1930s and 40s about the lives, loves and skills of coal miners, sand hogs, and telephone linemen, among others.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; was also critical, explaining that &quot;the more you think about what really happens in &quot;Cocktail&quot;, the more you realize how empty and fabricated it really is.&quot;

&quot;I was not happy with the final product,&quot; said Gould. &quot;It got so savaged by the critics ... I was accused of betraying my own work, which is stupid. So I was pretty devastated. I literally couldn&#x27;t get out of bed for a day. The good thing about that experience is that it toughened me up.&quot;

In 1992, Cruise said the film &quot;was not a crowning jewel&quot; in his career.

The official soundtrack single, The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Kokomo&quot;, was commercially successful and topped the charts in the United States, Australia and Japan. The song was nominated for a Grammy and a Golden Globe.

===Accolades===
&quot;Cocktail&quot; won two Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay while Cruise was nominated as Worst Actor and Donaldson as Worst Director. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of &quot;The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made&quot;. The film was also nominated for Worst Picture at the 1988 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards but lost to &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;.

Additionally, Cruise&#x27;s other film in 1988 was his co-starring role in the Best Picture-winning film &quot;Rain Man&quot;, alongside Dustin Hoffman. In doing so, he became the first (and as of 2024, only) actor to star in a Worst Picture Razzie winner and Best Picture Oscar winner in the same year.

<text>Paul Hindemith&#x27;s Der Schwanendreher (literally, &quot;The Swan Turner&quot;) is a concerto for viola and orchestra. &quot;Der Schwanendreher&quot; occupies a place at the core of the viola concerto repertoire, along with the concertos by Walton and Bartók. It was composed in 1935 and premiered by the composer himself at a performance in Amsterdam on 14 November 1935. Each movement is based on a separate medieval German folk song, thus, it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Concerto from Old Folk Songs&quot;. This composition draws its title from the final movement&#x27;s folk song base, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you the swan turner?&quot;

The orchestra calls for 2 flutes (one doubling on piccolo), oboe, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 3 horns, trumpet, trombone, timpani, harp, and a string section of 4 cellos and 3 double basses. This orchestration is interesting due to its lack of violins and violas which benefits the composition by making it easier for the solo viola to be heard.

The movements are:
#&quot;Zwischen Berg und tiefem Tal&quot;: Langsam – Mäßig bewegt, mit Kraft (&quot;Between mountain and deep valley&quot;: Slow – Moderately moving, with strength)
#&quot;Nun laube, Lindlein laube&quot;: Sehr ruhig – Fugato: &quot;Der Gutzgauch auf dem Zaune sass&quot; (&quot;Now grow leaves, little linden tree, grow leaves&quot;: very calm – Fugato: &quot;The Cuckoo Sat on the Fence&quot;)
#Variationen: &quot;Seid ihr nicht der Schwanendreher&quot;: Mäßig schnell (Variations: &quot;Aren&#x27;t you the swan turner?&quot;: Moderately fast)

==Meaning of title==
The concerto&#x27;s title, translated as &quot;The Swan Turner&quot;, comes from the name of the last and fourth German folk song used (namely in the third movement), entitled &quot;Seid ihr nicht der Schwanendreher&quot; (&quot;Aren&#x27;t you the swan turner?&quot;). The original context of &quot;swan turner&quot; in medieval times is that of a cook&#x27;s assistant who would turn the handle of a spit on which swans were roasting. However, in the context of the concerto itself (and evidenced in the text of the folk song), the meaning programmatically seems to refer to a wandering medieval minstrel, or organ grinder, who plays on an instrument such as the hurdy-gurdy (and providing embellishments and rhapsodies on the folk tunes), which has a handle shaped as a swan&#x27;s neck, thus the &quot;swan turner&quot; being the travelling musician himself, described by the composer in the preface notes to the work.

==Planned British premiere==
The British premiere was scheduled for 22 January 1936, with the composer as soloist in London. However, just before midnight on 20 January, King George V died. The following day, from 11 am to 5 pm, Hindemith wrote &quot;Trauermusik&quot; in homage to the late king. It was scored for viola and string orchestra, and was performed that evening, in a live broadcast from a BBC studio, with Adrian Boult conducting and the composer as soloist. The scheduled premiere of &quot;Der Schwanendreher&quot; was cancelled. &quot;Trauermusik&quot; contains quotations from &quot;&quot; and &quot;Der Schwanendreher&quot;.

<text>International maritime signal flags are various flags used to communicate with ships. The principal system of flags and associated codes is the International Code of Signals. Various navies have flag systems with additional flags and codes, and other flags are used in special uses, or have historical significance.

==Usage==
There are various methods by which the flags can be used as signals:
* A series of flags can spell out a message, each flag representing a letter.
* Individual flags have specific and standard meanings; for example, diving support vessels raise the &quot;A&quot; flag indicating their inability to move from their current location because they have a diver underwater and to warn other vessels to keep clear to avoid endangering the diver(s) with their propellers.
* One or more flags form a code word whose meaning can be looked up in a code book held by both parties. An example is the Popham numeric code used at the Battle of Trafalgar.
* In yacht racing and dinghy racing, flags have other meanings; for example, the P flag is used as the &quot;preparatory&quot; flag to indicate an imminent start, and the S flag means &quot;shortened course&quot; (for more details see Race signals).

NATO uses the same flags, with a few unique to warships, alone or in short sets to communicate various unclassified messages. The NATO usage generally differs from the international meanings, and therefore warships will fly the Code/answer flag above the signal to indicate it should be read using the international meaning.

During the Allied occupations of Axis countries after World War II, use and display of those nations&#x27; national flags was banned. In order to comply with the international legal requirement that a ship identify its registry by displaying the appropriate national ensign, swallow-tailed versions of the C, D, and E signal flags were designated as, respectively, provisional German, Okinawan, and Japanese civil ensigns. Being swallowtails, they are commonly referred to as the &quot;C-pennant&quot; (German: C-Doppelstander), &quot;D-pennant&quot;, and &quot;E-pennant&quot;.

== Letter flags (with ICS meaning) ==

Notes
== Number flags ==
==Substitute ==
Substitute or repeater flags allow messages with duplicate characters to be signaled without the need for multiple sets of flags.

The four NATO substitute flags are as follows:

The International Code of Signals includes only the first three of these substitute flags. To illustrate their use, here are some messages and the way they would be encoded:

<doc id="607759" wikidata="Q1624248" url="?curid=607759" title="Hocus-pocus">
<text>Hocus-pocus is a reference to the actions of magicians, often as the stereotypical magic words spoken when bringing about some sort of change. It was once a common term for a magician, juggler, or other similar entertainers. In extended usage, the term is often used (pejoratively) to describe irrational human activities that appear to depend on magic. Examples are given below.

The phrase could have originated from the Roman Canon (Eucharistic Prayer) found in the Latin Mass when the priest performs the transubstantiation of the bread into the body of Christ by saying: &quot;HOC EST ENIM CORPUS MEUM&quot; (meaning - &quot;This is my Body&quot;), which could be misheard as hocus-pocus and associated with magic and changing one object into something else.

== History ==
The earliest known English-language work on magic, or what was then known as &quot;legerdemain&quot; (sleight of hand), was published anonymously in 1635 under the title &quot;Hocus Pocus Junior: The Anatomie of Legerdemain&quot;. Further research suggests that &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; was the stage name of a well known magician of the era. This may be William Vincent, who is recorded as having been granted a license to perform magic in England in 1619. Whether he was the author of the book is unknown.

== Conjectured origins ==
The origins of the term remain obscure. The most popular conjecture is that it is a garbled Latin religious phrase or some form of &#x27;dog&#x27; Latin. Some have associated it with similar-sounding fictional, mythical, or legendary names. Others suggest it is merely a combination of nonsense words.

=== Latin and pseudo-Latin origins ===

One theory is that the term is a corruption of &quot;hax pax max Deus adimax&quot;, a pseudo-Latin phrase used in the early 17th century as a magical formula by conjurors.

Another theory is that it is a corruption or parody of the Catholic liturgy of the Eucharist, which contains the phrase &quot;&quot;Hoc est enim corpus meum&quot;, meaning &quot;This is my body&quot;. This explanation goes at least as far back as a 1694 speculation by the Anglican prelate John Tillotson:

This theory is supported by the fact that in the Netherlands, the words &quot;Hocus pocus&quot; are usually accompanied by the additional words &quot;pilatus pas&quot;, and this is said to be based on a post-Reformation parody of the traditional Catholic rite of transubstantiation during Mass, being a Dutch corruption of the Latin words &quot;Hoc est corpus meum&quot; and the credo, which reads in part, &quot;sub Pontio Pilato passus et sepultus est&quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;under Pontius Pilate he suffered and was buried&quot;. In a similar way the phrase is in Scandinavia usually accompanied by &quot;filiokus&quot;, a corruption of the term filioque, from the Latin version of the Nicene Creed, meaning “&quot;and from the Son&quot;”. The variant spelling &quot;filipokus&quot; is common in Russia, a predominantly Eastern Orthodox nation, as well as certain other post-Soviet states. Additionally, the word for &quot;stage trick&quot; in Russian, &quot;fokus&quot;, is derived from &quot;hocus pocus&quot;.

=== Magician&#x27;s name ===
Others believe that it is an appeal to the folkloric Norse magician Ochus Bochus: According to Sharon Turner in &quot;The History of the Anglo-Saxons&quot;, they were believed to be derived from &quot;Ochus Bochus&quot;, a magician and demon of the north.

=== Nonsense word ===
As an alternative to other theories, it may simply be pseudo-Latin with no meaning, made up to impress people:

<doc id="607760" wikidata="Q449005" url="?curid=607760" title="Joanna Southcott">
<text>Joanna Southcott (or Southcote; April 1750 – 26 December 1814) was a British self-described religious prophetess from Devon. A &quot;Southcottian&quot; movement continued in various forms after her death; its eighth prophet, Mabel Barltrop, died in 1934.

==Early life==
Joanna Southcott was born in the hamlet of Taleford, Devonshire, baptised at Ottery St Mary, and grew up in the village of Gittisham. Her father, William Southcott (died 1802), ran a small farm. She did dairy work as a girl, and after the death of her mother, Hannah, she went into service, first as a shop-girl in Honiton, then for a considerable time as a domestic servant in Exeter. She was eventually dismissed because a footman whose attentions she rejected claimed that she was &quot;growing mad&quot;.

==Self-revelation==
Originally in the Church of England, she joined the Wesleyans in Exeter in about 1792. She became persuaded that she had supernatural gifts and wrote and dictated prophecies in rhyme. She then announced herself as the Woman of the Apocalypse, as described in the Book of Revelation 12:1–6.

Southcott came to London at the request of William Sharp, an engraver, and began selling paper &quot;seals of the Lord&quot; at prices varying from twelve shillings to a guinea. The seals were supposed to ensure a holder&#x27;s place among the 144,000 people ostensibly elected to eternal life.

==The new Messiah and death==
At the age of 64, Southcott claimed she was pregnant with the new Messiah, the Shiloh of Genesis (49:10). 19 October 1814 was the planned delivery date, but Shiloh failed to appear, and it was given out that she was in a trance. Southcott had a disorder that made her appear pregnant and this fuelled her followers, who numbered about 100,000 by 1814, mainly in the London area.

Southcott died not long after this. Her official date of death was given as 27 December 1814, but it is likely that she died the previous day, as her followers retained her body for some time in the belief that she would be raised from the dead. They agreed to her burial only after the corpse began to decay. She was buried at the Chapel of Ease at St John&#x27;s Wood in January 1815.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Southcottian&quot; movement did not end with her death in 1814, although her followers had declined greatly in number by the end of that century. In 1844 one Ann Essam left large sums of money for &quot;printing, publishing and propagation of the sacred writings of Joanna Southcott&quot;. The will was disputed in 1861 by her niece on grounds that the writings were blasphemous and the bequest was contrary to the Statutes of Mortmain: the Court of Chancery refused to find the writings blasphemous but voided the bequest, acknowledging that it broke the Statutes of Mortmain.

In 1881 there was an enclave of her followers living in the Chatham area, east of London, who were distinguished by their long beards and good manners.

Southcott left a sealed wooden casket of prophecies, usually known as &quot;Joanna Southcott&#x27;s Box&quot;, with instructions to open it only at a time of national crisis and in the presence of all 24 current bishops of the Church of England, who were to spend a fixed period beforehand studying her prophecies. Attempts were made to persuade the episcopate to open it in the Crimean War and again in the First World War. In 1927, the psychic researcher Harry Price claimed to have come into possession of the box and arranged to have it opened in the presence of one reluctant prelate, the suffragan Bishop of Grantham. It was found to contain only a few oddments and unimportant papers, among them a lottery ticket and a horse-pistol. Price&#x27;s claims to have had the true box were disputed by historians and by Southcott followers.
Southcottians who denied the authenticity of the box that was opened in 1927 continued to press for the true box to be opened. A campaign on billboards and in national newspapers such as the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; was run in the 1960s and 1970s by a prominent group of Southcottians, the Panacea Society in Bedford (formed in 1920), to try to persuade the 24 bishops to have the box opened, claiming: &quot;War, disease, crime and banditry, distress of nations and perplexity will increase until the Bishops open Joanna Southcott&#x27;s box.&quot; The Society claims to hold this true box at a secret location for safekeeping, with its whereabouts to be disclosed only when a bishops&#x27; meeting has been arranged. The box shown in the Panacea Museum, Bedford is understood to be a meticulous replica for display purposes. Southcott prophesied that the Day of Judgement would come in the year 2004, and her followers stated that if the contents of the box had not been studied beforehand, the world would have had to meet it unprepared.

Charles Dickens refers to Southcott in a description of the year 1775 at the beginning of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;.

Her religious teaching is still practised today by two groups: the Christian Israelite Church and the House of David.

<doc id="607766" wikidata="Q3290788" url="?curid=607766" title="Marguerite de Launay, baronne de Staal">
<text>Marguerite Jeanne Cordier de Launay, baronne de Staal (30 August 1684 – 15 June 1750) was a French writer.

==Life==
De Launay was born in Paris. Her father was a painter named Cordier. He seems to have deserted her mother, who then resumed her maiden name, de Launay, which was also adopted by her daughter. She was educated at a convent at Evreux, of which Mme de La Rochefoucauld, sister of François de La Rochefoucauld, author of the &quot;Maximes&quot;, was superior. There, she became attached to Mme de Grieu, who, being appointed abbess of the convent of St Louis at Rouen, took her friend with her.

Mlle de Launay lived there until 1710 in the enjoyment of the utmost consideration, and held a little court of her own, which included Brunel, the friend of Fontenelle, the sieur de la Rey and the abbé Vertot. She describes her own first passion for the marquis de Silly, the brother of a friend with whom she was visiting. Her affection was not returned, but she entered on a correspondence with him in which she plays the part of director.

After the death of her patron, Mme de Grieu, poverty compelled her to enter the household of the duchesse du Maine at the Château de Sceaux in the capacity of lady-in-waiting. Her literary talent soon manifested itself in the literary court of the duchesse, and secured for her, among other friendships, the somewhat undesirable admiration of the abbé Chaulieu. The duchesse is said, on the somewhat dubious authority of her lady-in-waiting, to have been not a little jealous of her attendant. Enough, however, is known of the duchesse&#x27;s imperious and capricious temper to make it improbable that her service was agreeable. Mlle de Launay, however, enjoyed a large share of her mistress&#x27; confidence and had a considerable share in drawing up the &quot;Mémoire des princes légitimes&quot; which demanded the meeting of the states-general.

She was implicated in the Cellamare Conspiracy of Giulio Alberoni against Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, regent for Louis XV of France, and was sent in 1718 to the Bastille, where she remained for two years. Even here, however, she made conquests, though she was far from beautiful. Her own account of her love for her fellow prisoner, the chevalier de Ménil, and of the passion of the chevalier de Maisonrouge, her gaoler, for her, is justly famous. She returned on her liberation to the service of the duchess, who showed no gratitude for the devotion, approaching the heroic, that Mlle Delaunay had shown in her cause. She received no promotion and still had to fulfill the wearisome duties of a waiting-maid. She refused, it is said, André Dacier, the widower of a wife more famous than himself, and, in 1735, being then more than fifty, married the Baron de Staal. Her dissatisfaction with her position had become so evident that the duchess, afraid of losing her services, arranged the marriage to give Mlle Delaunay rank sufficient to allow of her promotion to be on an equality with the ladies of the court.

On this footing she remained a member of the household. It was at this time that she became the friend and correspondent of Mme du Deffand. She died at Gennevilliers.

==Works==

Her &quot;Mémoires&quot; appeared about five years later, and have often been reprinted, both separately and in collections of the memoirs of the 17th and 18th centuries, to both of which the author belonged both in style and character. She has much of the frankness and seductive verve of Mme de Sévigné and her contemporaries, but more than a little alloyed with the sensibility of a later time. It may be doubted whether she does not somewhat exaggerate the discomforts of her position and her sense of them. In her lack of illusions, she was a child of the 18th century. Sainte-Beuve says that the most fit time for the reading of the &quot;Mémoires&quot; is the late autumn, under the trees of November, but her book is an extremely amusing one to read, as well as not a little instructive. The humours of the court of Sceaux are depicted as hardly any other society of the kind has ever been. &quot;Dans cet art enjoué de raconter&quot;, says Sainte-Beuve, &quot;Madame de Staal est classique&quot;.

Besides her &quot;Mémoires&quot; Mme de Staal left two excellent short comedies, performed at the court of Sceaux, and some letters, the answers to which are in some cases extant, and show, as well as the references of contemporaries, that the writer did not exaggerate her own charm. Her &quot;Mémoires&quot; were translated by Selina Bathurst (1877) and by Cora H. Bell (1892). See the edition (1877) of her &quot;Mémoires&quot; by M. de Lescure.

<doc id="607771" wikidata="Q637385" url="?curid=607771" title="M50 motorway (England)">
<text>The M50 is a motorway in Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, and Herefordshire, England. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Ross Spur&quot;, it is a connection of the M5 motorway to a point near Ross-on-Wye, where it joins the A40 road continuing westward into Wales. The motorway was fully opened in 1962.

==Route==
The M50 runs between junction 8 of the M5 motorway, NNE of Tewkesbury on the Gloucestershire-Worcestershire border; and
the junction with the A449, the A40 and the A465 (&quot;Heads of the Valleys Road&quot;) taking traffic into South Wales.

Leaving the M5 at junction 8, it passes north of Tewkesbury then south of Ledbury. Between junctions 1 and 2 chiefly for these towns respectively, it crosses the River Severn on the Queenhill Bridge and Viaduct over the flood plain. After passing north of Newent, the motorway terminates at junction 4.

==History==
The construction works for the M50 were let under four contracts:

* Contract 1 was awarded to Tarmac Construction
* Contracts 2 and 3 were awarded to R M Douglas Construction
* Contract 4 was awarded to A E Farr Ltd

Both contracts were undertaken between 1958 and 1962:

On 3 March 1958, Harold Watkinson, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation fired a starting flare during the inauguration ceremony in Herefordshire to signal the start of construction of the M50. Junctions 1 to 4 opened in 1960 and the section between the M5 to junction 1 opened in 1962.

The route forms a strategic (that is, trunk or main) route from the Midlands and northern Britain to South Wales (also including the A449 and A40 and so was constructed as an early priority.) It is one of the few British motorways not to have been widened, instead retaining its original layout of two lanes in each direction.
===Murder of Marie Wilks===

In 1988, a woman was abducted from the hard shoulder of the M50 and found murdered three miles further up the motorway.

===Services===
After both ends of the M50 are motorway service stations:
*Strensham services operated by RoadChef, north of the M50&#x27;s northeastern terminus (unnamed, nominally 0) junction with junction 8 of the M5.
*Esso garage on the combined short section of the A449 road and A40 remains westbound.

====History====
Instead of the latter, beyond junction 4 was a larger Ross Spur Services operated by Welcome Break which closed in the 2000s.

===Descriptions===
The starting junction (junction 8 of the M5) was originally a free-flowing trumpet-style, then converted to a roundabout with M5 flyover when the M5 was widened in the 1990s. Junction 1, where the M50 meets the A38, is a partial cloverleaf. Junction 2 has full slips roads from the deceleration lane into the slip roads save the kinked eastbound exit to local roads. Junction 3 consists of dual-carriageway-style 90° exits due to cost, low traffic volume and the style of road; however this has been the scene of various accidents.

The long disused railway bridge over the motorway which carried the Tewkesbury and Malvern Railway was dismantled in 2012 and donated to the Bluebell Railway.

<text>The Maison de Verre (French for House of Glass) was built from 1928 to 1932 in Paris, France. Constructed in the early modern style of architecture, the house&#x27;s design emphasized three primary traits: honesty of materials, variable transparency of forms, and juxtaposition of &quot;industrial&quot; materials and fixtures with a more traditional style of home décor. The primary materials used were steel, glass, and glass block. Some of the notable &quot;industrial&quot; elements included rubberized floor tiles, bare steel beams, perforated metal sheet, heavy industrial light fixtures, and mechanical fixtures.

The design was a collaboration among Pierre Chareau (a furniture and interiors designer), Bernard Bijvoet (a Dutch architect working in Paris since 1927) and Louis Dalbet (craftsman metalworker). Much of the intricate moving scenery of the house was designed on site as the project developed. The historian Henry-Russel Hitchcock as well as the designer Eileen Gray have declared that the architect was in fact &#x27;that clever Dutch engineer (Bijvoet)&#x27;(Gray). The external form is defined by translucent glass block walls, with select areas of clear glazing for transparency. Internally, spatial division is variable by the use of sliding, folding or rotating screens in glass, sheet or perforated metal, or in combination. Other mechanical components included an overhead trolley from the kitchen to dining room, a retracting stair from the private sitting room to Mme Dalsace&#x27;s bedroom and complex bathroom cupboards and fittings.

The program of the home was somewhat unusual in that it included a ground-floor medical suite for Dr. Jean Dalsace. This variable circulation pattern was provided for by a rotating screen that hid the private stairs from patients during the day but framed the stairs at night.

The house is notable for its splendid architecture, but it may be more well known for another reason. It was built on the site of a much older building that the patron had purchased and intended to demolish. Much to his or her chagrin, however, the elderly tenant on the top floor of the building absolutely refused to sell, and so the patron was obliged to completely demolish the bottom three floors of the building and construct the Maison de Verre underneath, all without disturbing the original top floor.

Dr. Dalsace was a member of the French Communist Party who played a significant role in both anti-fascist and cultural affairs. In the mid-1930s, the Maison de Verre&#x27;s double-height &quot;salle de séjour&quot; was transformed into a &quot;salon&quot; regularly frequented by Marxist intellectuals like Walter Benjamin as well as by Surrealist poets and artists such as Louis Aragon, Paul Éluard, Pablo Picasso, Max Ernst, Jacques Lipchitz, Jean Cocteau, Yves Tanguy, Joan Miró and Max Jacob. According to the American art historian Maria Gough, the Maison de Verre had a powerful influence on Walter Benjamin, especially on his constructivist - rather than expressionist - reading of Paul Scheerbart&#x27;s utopian project for a future &quot;culture of glass&quot;, for a &quot;new glass environment [which] will completely transform mankind,&quot; as the latter expressed it in his 1914 treatise &quot;Glass Architecture&quot;. See in particular Benjamin&#x27;s 1933 essay &quot;Erfahrung und Armut&quot; (&quot;Experience and Poverty&quot;).

American architectural historian Robert Rubin bought the house from Dalsace family in 2006 to restore it and use it for his family residence. He allows a limited number of tours to the house.

<doc id="607784" wikidata="Q7712654" url="?curid=607784" title="The Adventures of Stoke Mandeville, Astronaut and Gentleman">
<text>The Adventures of Stoke Mandeville, Astronaut and Gentleman is a comedy play by Fraser Charlton and Nikolas Lloyd. The action is set in a universe with an alternate history in which the British developed the craft of space travel during the reign of Queen Victoria. The modern day world is populated by stereotypically stoic Englishmen, and vile scheming Frenchmen who will stoop to any depth in order to thwart the ambitions and harmony of the British Empire.

The title character shares his name with the Buckinghamshire village of Stoke Mandeville and its well-known hospital.

The play was originally written as six half-hour episodes for BBC Radio 4, and a pilot episode was recorded, but Radio 4 decided not to go ahead with commissioning a series from two unknown writers. Instead, the script was turned into a stage play, and was first performed in Newcastle in the Black Swan Court in 2001 with a cast of just five, including the two writers, who all had to play multiple parts. After this, the play was revised for performance at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and with a slightly different cast ran for two weeks in 2002 at &quot;Augustine&#x27;s&quot;. It has since been performed a few more times, notably at Cambridge University in 2003, Highgate in 2004, Guildford (Surrey) in 2007 (where it was voted best event of the year by the students of the University of Surrey), Adelaide Australia 2009, and several more productions have been proposed.

The play&#x27;s two chief influences are Douglas Adams&#x27;s &quot;The Hitchhikers&#x27; Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and the role play game &quot;Space 1889&quot;, although another is &quot;Sir Henry at Rawlinson End&quot; by Vivian Stanshall.

The website (link below) contains reviews, programme notes, and many examples of the play&#x27;s robust and utterly politically incorrect humour.

The minimum cast for the play is five, one woman and four men, although since there are many parts, a far larger cast could be used. The running time for the Edinburgh version is one hour and fifteen minutes, which is about ideal for the Festival Fringe.

Posters and fliers for the productions displayed the following statement: &quot;The management wishes to assure all patrons that under no circumstances shall persons of a &quot;French&quot; nature be admitted to the auditorium.&quot;

==Critical reaction==
Reaction from critics has been generally good. However, the 2002 Edinburgh production gained a poor review from &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, which awarded 2 stars. The review was written by someone who had not attended the show. Only two days before, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; had published an article by Robert McNeil, who had seen the production, praising the show.

==Video Version==
The first episode of a video version of the story appeared on &quot;YouTube&quot; on 4 July 2012. The video version stars professional actor Jamie Osborn as Graham Pennyworth. Having a very low budget, the videos were shot in a disused art gallery, with all the actors against a green-screen.

<text>The Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe – Social Democratic Party (, abbr. MLSTP–PSD) is one of the main political parties in São Tomé and Príncipe. Jorge Bom Jesus is the current president of the party.

==History==

===Early years===
The party, then called the Committee for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe, was founded in 1960 as a nationalist group opposed to Portuguese colonial rule. In 1961 it joined the CONCP with other communist and socialist groups fighting against the Portuguese Empire in Africa. The CLSTP was set up by exiles who eventually established their base in nearby Gabon. Manuel Pinto da Costa, who would eventually become President of an independent São Tomé and Príncipe, was the leader of the party. In 1972, the CLSTP became the MLSTP.

After the April 1974 &quot;Carnation Revolution&quot; in Portugal, the new government agreed to hand over power to the MLSTP. Later that year, the MLSTP was recognized as the sole legitimate representative of the Santomean people.

===Independence and one-party rule===
Following a brief period of transitional government, elections were held for a constituent assembly and the MLSTP won all 16 of its seats.

Independence was achieved on 12 July 1975, with Manuel Pinto da Costa as president and Miguel Trovoada as prime minister. The constitution promulgated on 12 December 1975, effectively vested absolute power in the President and the MLSTP became the nation&#x27;s sole legal political party.

During the late 1970s and 1980s, the party&#x27;s socialist orientation and in turn the nation&#x27;s orientation led to strong ties with Cuba, East Germany and the Soviet Union.

===Transition to democratic rule===
In late 1989, a progressive faction within the party embarked on a transition to full multi-party system, after a debate at the national party conference.

A democratic constitution introduced by the MLSTP Central Committee was approved overwhelmingly in an August 1990 referendum.

At the MLSTP Party Congress in October 1990, Carlos Graça was appointed as the new Secretary-General, in succession to Manuel Pinto da Costa. In addition, the party&#x27;s name was amended to the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe – Social Democratic Party (MLSTP–PSD).

In an extraordinary Congress of the MLSTP–PSD held in May 1998, Manuel Pinto da Costa was elected unopposed as President of the party, a post that he held until 2005.

At the party&#x27;s Fourth Congress, Guilherme Posser da Costa, a former prime minister, was elected as president of the MLSTP–PSD on 27 February 2005, succeeding Pinto da Costa. There were 708 votes in favor of Posser da Costa, who was the only candidate, and three votes against him. As of June 2008, the President of the MLSTP–PSD is Joaquim Rafael Branco.

In June 2008, after Prime Minister Patrice Trovoada of the Independent Democratic Action (ADI) party was defeated in a vote of no confidence, President Fradique de Menezes asked the MLSTP–PSD to form a government, and it chose Branco to become the next prime minister. The ADI denounced Menezes&#x27; designation of the MLSTP–PSD to form a government as unconstitutional, arguing that it was too late in the parliamentary term to do so, and it took the matter to the Supreme Tribunal of Justice.

The current president of the MLSTP–PSD, Aurelio Martins, was elected on 15 January 2011 in the V Ordinary Congress of the Party.

Today the MLSTP–PSD has friendly relations with political parties in other Lusophone countries, including the Socialist Party (PS) in Portugal and the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).

==Performance in recent elections==
In the nation&#x27;s first democratic elections, held in January 1991, the party suffered a defeat at the polls capturing only 30.5% of the vote and 21 seats in the 55-member National Assembly.

December 1992 local elections resulted in the MLSTP–PSD gaining control of five of the country&#x27;s seven provinces.

In the 1994 legislative elections, the party received 37% of the vote and regained control of the National Assembly winning 27 of the 55-seats, one short of an absolute majority.

March 1995 elections to the newly created seven member assembly on the smaller island of Príncipe resulted in another victory for the party.

Manuel Pinto da Costa ran as the MLSTP–PSD candidate in the 1996 presidential election. In the first round, he came in second behind the incumbent President Miguel Trovoada, winning 39% of the vote to Trovoada&#x27;s 41%. In the second round he was defeated by Trovoada who captured 52.7% of the vote to his 47.3%.

In the 1998 legislative elections, the MLSTP–PSD won 50.6% of the vote and increased its majority in the National Assembly from 27 to 31 seats.

In the July 2001 presidential election, Manuel Pinto da Costa again attempted to regain the presidency, but was soundly defeated by businessman Fradique de Menezes 55.2% to 40.0%.

March 2002 legislative elections maintained the MLSTP–PSD&#x27;s status as the largest party in the National Assembly, but only by one seat. The party received 39.6% of the vote and won 24 of the 55-seats.

In the 26 March 2006 legislative election, the party finished second behind the Force for Change Democratic Movement-Democratic Convergence Party (MDFM–PCD) coalition, winning 20 out of 55 seats.

The party did not field a candidate in the 30 July 2006 presidential election, opting to join a coalition of parties supporting Patrice Trovoada of the Independent Democratic Action (ADI) party. He was defeated by the incumbent Fradique de Menezes, winning 38.82% of the vote to de Menezes&#x27; 60.58%.

In the most recent parliamentary elections held on 1 August 2010, the MLSTP–PSD became the second largest party (behind ADI), winning 21 seats. In 2011, Pinto da Costa finally succeeded in regaining the presidency, although officially running as an independent.

Evaristo Carvalho was the president of São Tomé and Príncipe, after defeating the incumbent President Manuel Pinto da Costa in the 2016 elections. President Carvalho is also Vice president of the Independent Democratic Action party (ADI). Patrice Emery Trovoada was prime minister since 2014 and he is the leader of Independent Democratic Action party (ADI). In December 2018, Jorge Bom Jesus, the leader of the MLSTP–PSD, was sworn in as new prime minister.

In the 2021 elections Independent Democratic Action candidate Carlos Vila Nova won against MLSTP-PSD candidate Guilherme Posser da Costa with 58% of the vote. Nova was sworn in as president 2 October 2021.

<text>Kit Kat (stylised as KitKat in various countries) is a chocolate-covered wafer bar confection created by Rowntree&#x27;s of York, England. It is produced globally by Nestlé (which acquired Rowntree&#x27;s in 1988), except in the United States, where it is made under licence by the H. B. Reese Candy Company, a division of the Hershey Company (an agreement Rowntree&#x27;s first made with Hershey in 1970).

The standard bars consist of two or four pieces called fingers composed of three layers of wafer, separated and covered by an outer layer of chocolate. Each finger can be snapped from the bar separately. There are many flavours of Kit Kat, including milk, white, and dark chocolate.

The original four-finger version of the bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree&#x27;s York factory put a suggestion in the recommendation box for &quot;a chocolate bar that a man could take to work in his pack up&quot;. It was launched in September 1935 in the UK as Rowntree&#x27;s Chocolate Crisp, and the later two-finger version was launched in 1936. It was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937, and just Kit Kat after World War II.

Since making its first television appearance in a British commercial in 1958, the slogan for the Kit Kat in the UK and elsewhere has been &quot;Have a break... have a Kit Kat&quot;. Since 1986 in the US, the jingle used in television advertisements has been &quot;Gimme a break, Gimme a break, Break me off a piece of that Kit Kat bar!&quot;

== History ==
Use of the name Kit Kat or Kit Cat for a type of food goes back to the 18th century, when mutton pies known as a Kit Kat were served at meetings of the political Kit-Cat Club in London owned by pastry chef Christopher Cat.

The origins of what is now known as the Kit Kat brand go back to 1911, when Rowntree&#x27;s, a confectionery company based in York, England, trademarked the terms Kit Cat and Kit Kat. The names were not used immediately and Kit Kat first appeared in the 1920s, when Rowntree&#x27;s launched a brand of boxed chocolates entitled Kit Cat. This continued into the 1930s, when Rowntree&#x27;s shifted focus and production onto its Black Magic and Dairy Box brands. With the promotion of alternative products, the Kit Cat brand decreased and was eventually discontinued. The original four-finger bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree&#x27;s York Factory put a suggestion in a recommendation box for a snack that &quot;a man could take to work in his pack&quot;. The bar was officially launched in September 1935, under the title of Rowntree&#x27;s Chocolate Crisp (priced at 2d), and was sold in London and throughout southern England.
Rowntree&#x27;s Chocolate Crisp was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937. The colour scheme and first flavour variation to the brand came in 1942, owing to World War II, when food shortages prompted an alteration in the recipe. The flavour of Kit Kat was changed to dark chocolate; the packaging abandoned its Chocolate Crisp title, and was coloured blue. After the war the name became Kit Kat, with the original milk chocolate recipe and red packaging.

Following its success in the United Kingdom, in the 1940s Kit Kat was exported to Canada, South Africa, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1957, Donald Gilles, the executive at JWT London, created the iconic advertising line &quot;Have a Break, Have a Kit Kat&quot;. The brand further expanded in the 1970s when Rowntree created a new distribution factory in Germany to meet European demand and established agreements to distribute the brand in the US through the Hershey company, and in Japan through Fujiya.
In June 1988, Swiss company Nestlé acquired Kit Kat through the purchase of Rowntree&#x27;s, giving Nestlé global control over the brand, except in the US, and production and distribution increased with new facilities in Japan and additional manufacturing operations set up in Malaysia, India and China.

The Hershey Company has a licence to produce Kit Kat bars in the United States which dates from 1970, when Hershey executed a licensing agreement with Rowntree which allowed Hershey to retain the Kit Kat licence so long as Hershey was not sold. Nestlé, which has a substantial presence in the US, had to honour the licensing agreement when it bought Rowntree in 1988. As Kit Kat is one of Hershey&#x27;s top five brands in the US market, the Kit Kat licence was a key factor in Hershey&#x27;s failed attempt to attract a serious buyer in 2002. Even Nestlé rejected Hershey&#x27;s asking price. Nestlé&#x27;s sale of its US confectionery business to Ferrara Candy Company in 2018 did not impact the Kit Kat bar, and thus rights would revert directly to Nestlé and not Ferrara in the event of a sale of Hershey.
Variants in the traditional chocolate bar first appeared in 1996 when Kit Kat Orange, the first flavour variant, was introduced in the UK. Its success was followed by several varieties including mint and caramel, and in 1999 Kit Kat Chunky was launched and received favourably by international consumers. Variations on the traditional Kit Kat have continued to be developed since then. In 2000, Nestlé acquired Fujiya&#x27;s share of the brand in Japan, and also expanded its marketplace in Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Venezuela, in addition to markets in Eastern and Central Europe. Throughout the decade, Kit Kat introduced dozens of flavours and line extensions within specific consumer markets. In September 2010, Kit Kat (and Aero) celebrated its 75th anniversary. Nestlé stated, &quot;Since that momentous day in 1935, Kit Kat has firmly established itself in British culture, spreading its chocolate fingers far and wide that is sold in more countries than any other chocolate brand&quot;.

The traditional bar has four fingers which each measure approximately by . A two-finger bar was launched in the 1930s, and has remained the company&#x27;s best-selling biscuit brand ever since. The 1999 Kit Kat Chunky (known as Big Kat and Kit Kat Extra Crispy in the US) has one large finger approximately wide. Kit Kat bars contain varying numbers of fingers depending on the market, ranging from the half-finger sized Kit Kat Petit in Japan, to the three-fingered variants in Arabia, and the twelve-finger family-size bars in Australia and France. Kit Kat bars are sold individually and in bags, boxes and multi-packs.

== Global confection ==

Kit Kat bars are produced in 16 countries by Nestlé: Brazil, Mexico, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Germany, Russia, Japan, China, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Bulgaria, and Algeria. Kit Kat bars in the United States are produced under licence by The Hershey Company, a Nestlé competitor, due to a prior licensing agreement with Rowntree.
The year 2003 was a turning point for the Kit Kat bar as well as the confectionery industry in general. The popularity of low carb diets, and the push to healthier eating stifled sales growth in many parts of the world. In addition, fierce competition from Cadbury&#x27;s newly formed Dairy Milk superbrand also contributed to Kit Kat sales decreasing considerably in its home market of the UK, and threatened to depose it from its No.1 position. The solution adopted by Nestlé and others was to increase dramatically the number of new and unique variations of their confections and market them as limited or special editions, usually only available for a few months at a time so as not lose sales of their standard products. The strategy initially reversed the decline of the Kit Kat and has been adopted worldwide by Nestlé, Hershey, Mars, and others with similar success. This has resulted in many new flavours and varieties of the Kit Kat and other confections appearing globally since then.

In September 2006, Nestlé announced that they would be cutting 645 jobs in their York factory and moving all Smarties production to their Hamburg factory, which had already made up for two-thirds of production. They stated that this move would allow for a £20 million investment to modernise the antiquated York factory and improve Kit Kat production. In 2010, a new £5 million manufacturing line was opened by Nestlé in York, to produce more than one billion Kit Kat bars each year.

As dark chocolate has seen increased demand and favour worldwide because of its purported health benefits, in September 2006 the four-finger Kit Kat Fine Dark was launched in the United Kingdom as a permanent product. Hershey had sold the four-finger Kit Kat Dark in the US several years previously as a limited edition, and began doing so again.

Nestlé now manufactures two-finger Kit Kats with natural flavourings, and in February 2021 announced the rollout of the first vegan Kit Kat, called &quot;KitKat V&quot;. In 2014, Kit Kat was ranked the third best selling chocolate bar in the United Kingdom, after Dairy Milk and Galaxy.
Sometimes considered a biscuit, in 2020 sales of Kit Kats were second to McVitie&#x27;s biscuits in the UK in the biscuit category.

== Design ==
When first introduced in the United Kingdom in 1935, the original Rowntree&#x27;s Chocolate Crisp bar had a red wrapper, which briefly became blue between 1945 and 1947. The Kit Kat logo was added in 1937. As a result of milk shortages after the end of World War II – a period of rationing in the UK – dark chocolate was used instead of milk chocolate during that period.

Since its introduction into the US in the 1970s, the Hershey&#x27;s Kit Kat packaging and advertising has differed from the branding used in every other country where it was sold. In 2002, Hershey Kit Kats adopted the slanted ellipse logo used worldwide by Nestlé, though the ellipse was red and the text white. The US version of &quot;Kit Kat Chunky&quot; is known as &quot;Big Kat&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the product was traditionally wrapped in silver foil and an outer paper band. In 2001 this was changed to flow wrap plastic. Foil and paper wrapping is still used for Kit Kats sold as part of a multipack. In 2020, Kit Kat won the Lausanne Index Prize - Best of Packaging.

== Marketing and promotion ==
=== Advertising ===
After launching in the 1930s, Rowntree&#x27;s Chocolate Crisp was originally advertised with the slogans &quot;the biggest little meal&quot; and &quot;the perfect companion to a cup of tea&quot;. During World War II, Kit Kat was depicted as a valuable wartime foodstuff, with the slogan &quot;what active people need&quot;. The first Kit Kat poster appeared in 1951, and the brand made its first television appearance in a UK commercial in 1958. The first colour TV advertisement appeared in 1969.

Since 1957, the slogan for the Kit Kat in the UK and elsewhere has been &quot;Have a break... have a Kit Kat&quot;. However, in 1995, Nestlé sought to trademark the &quot;Have a break&quot; portion. After a ten-year legal battle, which was contested by rival Mars, the European Court of Justice ruled on 7 July 2005 to send the case back to the British courts. In 2004, Nestlé UK used the slogan &quot;Make the most of your break&quot;, but later returned to the original slogan.
The United States also used the short-lived slogan, &quot;Tastes So Good, You&#x27;ll Roar&quot;, in the early 1980s. The TV commercial most known from this slogan involves a young man biting into one of the Kit Kat bars in a grocery store, and roaring like a lion so loudly the whole store shakes violently, knocking items from the shelves. Another short-lived US slogan was &quot;That&#x27;s What You Want&quot;, whose television adverts showed people pulling unlikely foodstuffs from their pockets or purses, before rejecting them in favour of a Kit Kat. The &quot;classic&quot; American version of the &quot;Gimme a Break&quot; Kit Kat jingle (in use in the US since 1986) was written by Ken Shuldman (copy) and Michael A. Levine (music) for the DDB Advertising Agency. Versions of the original have been covered by Carrie Underwood, Shawn Colvin, and many studio singers, as well as people who have appeared on-camera in the commercials. The jingle was cited in a study by University of Cincinnati researcher James J. Kellaris as one of the top ten &quot;earworms&quot; – bits of melody that become stuck in your head. Another version of the advertising jingle &#x27;Gimme a break&#x27; created for Kit Kat &quot;Factory&quot; commercial in the US was an original recording by Andrew W.K. W.K. was hired to write a new musical version for their &quot;Gimme a break&quot; slogan. Variations on the Andrew W.K. advertisement included executive dance routines in corporate offices and a network newsroom. However, the &quot;classic&quot; song has also been used again since the newer version first aired in 2004.

Many adverts were worldwide hits among them in the 1980s with Ken Campbell in an advert with Heaven and Hell with Devil and Angel on Television. In Australia, TV ads for Kit Kat featured the classic children&#x27;s show &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, which played off the catchphrase &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot; but instead sees one of the members enjoying a Kit Kat &quot;Break.&quot; A 1989 UK television commercial for Kit Kat, in which a zoo photographer &quot;takes a break&quot; from waiting for pandas to appear in an enclosure and misses them performing a dance routine, came in 30th in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest TV Ads&quot; poll in 2000.
In late 2004 through to the end of 2006, Nestlé Rowntree sponsored the English football club York City F.C. As a result, the club&#x27;s home-ground, Bootham Crescent, was renamed to KitKat Crescent. The Maltese tour boat MV &quot;Lady Davinia&quot; had a distinctive red and white Kit Kat paint scheme before she sank in 2008.

In a 2012 advertising campaign in the UK and Ireland, several new flavours of Chunky Kit Kat were marketed, with consumers being asked to vote for their favourite. Selecting from white chocolate, double chocolate, peanut butter, and orange, Peanut butter was the winner by having 47% of votes. A similar campaign occurred in 2013 with mint, coconut, hazelnut and chocolate fudge.

=== Association with Android ===
In September 2013, it was announced that version 4.4 of Google&#x27;s Android mobile operating system would be named &quot;KitKat&quot;. Google licensed the name from Nestlé, with no money changing hands. A promotion ran in numerous countries with specially branded Android Kit Kat bars to win Nexus 7 devices and Google Play Store credit.

=== Fairtrade ===
In December 2009, it was announced that the four-finger variety of Kit Kat would use Fairtrade chocolate (at least in Britain and Ireland) from January 2010. The Fairtrade Kit Kat promotion was extended to the two-finger edition in January 2010.

In June 2020, Nestlé announced that KitKat was to end its relationship with the non-profit organisation, Fairtrade, instead choosing to source its cocoa for KitKat chocolate bars from farms with a Rainforest Alliance accreditation.

=== Golden ticket draw ===
In the first three weeks of &quot;Big Brother Series 7&quot; in the UK, Channel 4 conducted a promotion in conjunction with Nestlé to distribute 100 &quot;golden tickets&quot; randomly throughout Kit Kats, in a style reminiscent of the &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; story. Members of the public finding these tickets were permitted to use them to give themselves a chance to become a &quot;Big Brother&quot; housemate and bypass the standard auditions process.

Golden ticket holders were invited to a television show where one of them, Susie Verrico, was chosen to enter the House by Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace, picking a ball out of a machine at random. This contest caused some controversy, with the Advertising Standards Authority saying that the terms and conditions of the draw should have been made clearer in related advertisements, and that an independent adjudicator should have been present before and during the draw.

== Varieties ==
=== Flavours ===

Many varieties of Kit Kat have existed, either permanently or as limited editions, such as those sold to commemorate festivals such as Valentine&#x27;s Day. In Japan, Nestlé has introduced over 300 different flavours since 2000, including hot sauce, soy sauce, wasabi, apple cider vinegar, zunda, Ice cream, milk tea, and cough drop. They have even introduced a range that require baking in an oven. The flavours are designed to appeal to younger buyers, and are often bought as good-luck gifts as the brand name echoes the Japanese phrase &quot;Kitto Katsu&quot;, roughly translating as &quot;surely win.&quot;
The Kit Kat Orange was the first flavour variant to be introduced in the United Kingdom, in 1996 and 1998 in Ireland. It was followed in 1997 by the Kit Kat Dark and Kit Kat Mint. All three were available as permanent editions of the two-finger multipack in the United Kingdom, along with the Kit Kat Original, the Kit Kat White, and from 2012 the Kit Kat Cookies &amp; Cream. There has also been Kit Kat Caramel.

A wide variety of promotional items exist, ranging from traditional merchandise (such as mugs, pens, oven gloves and tea-towels) to less common items such as coats for small dogs. In Japan, Kit Kats have come packaged with CD singles, and a special limited edition double pack of Kit Kat Crispy Monogatari came bundled with a mini book featuring six short stories, one of which was written by Koji Suzuki, author of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle series. In Japan, Kit Kats are also available in jars that are dispensed from vending machines.

Kit Kat introduced two new flavours to the United States in 2020: Lemon Crisp and Raspberry Creme. The new flavours are available in regular sized bars or miniature bars. In 2020, Nestlé launched a new flavor, Scotch whisky KitKats, available only in Japan using chocolate aged for six months in whisky barrels in Scotland. In February 2021, the company announced it will be launching a vegan, dairy-free version of their popular KitKat product. The bar will be called KitKat V and it will be available in select countries in late 2021 and then expand worldwide.

=== Forms ===

The &#x27;standard&#x27; Kit Kat finger bars can come in a variety of presentations and nutritional values. The bars can come in a miniature form of two finger mini bars, or a larger standard four, or in some cases, three, fingered bars.

Originally, each finger was imprinted with the name &#x27;Rowntree&#x27; in script form, but this was subsequently changed to Kit Kat and remains so to this day.
The standard size has been upgraded in several cases up to a &#x27;monster Size&#x27; bar, which can include up to five or eight fingers. Large single-fingered &quot;Chunky Kit Kats&quot; were launched in the United Kingdom in 1998 and have been sold in a variety of flavours, such as White Chocolate, Caramel, Hazelnut Cream, and Peanut Butter. The market for Chunky Kit Kats has also expanded to Canada.
Other forms and shapes include &quot;Choc&#x27;n&#x27;Go&quot; individually wrapped fingers in France, a twelve-finger &quot;Family Block&quot; available in New Zealand and Australia, round bite-sized &quot;Pop Choc&quot; pieces, square &quot;Kubes&quot;, praline-filled &quot;Senses&quot;, a yoghurt with Kit Kat pieces, and a Kit Kat ice cream cone.

In the 1980s, a Kit Kat with five shorter fingers was sold in vending machines in the UK. The Japanese &quot;Bake &#x27;N Tasty Mini Kit Kats Custard Pudding Flavour&quot; was launched in 2014. The bar must be baked in an oven before consumption, and the surface sugar caramelises in the process.

In 2015, a new luxury and giftable variant of Kit Kat called Kit Kat Rubies was launched in Malaysia. Comes with the box of 20 small bars, the Kit Kat Rubies bar made with the premium chocolate truffle cream and imported roasted hazelnut pieces.

As of 2017, US variants include the standard and king-size four-finger bars, standard bars covered with white or dark chocolate, snack-size orange-covered bars for Halloween (sold until 2021 and replaced with Breaking Bones starting in 2022), bagged wrapped one-finger miniatures (original and assorted), unwrapped minis, a redesigned Big Kat, and a king-size Big Kat (two of the then-new Big Kat bars).

A Kit Kat breakfast cereal was launched in the United Kingdom in 2023.

== Chocolatory ==

Kit Kat has opened a Chocolatory in the Melbourne Central Shopping Centre in Melbourne, Australia. There was also one in Sydney, however this was closed June 2024. The shops allow customers to use touch screens to create their own Kit Kat from a selection of chocolates and ingredients; they are made while the customers wait, and customers can mix their own flavours with some Kit Kat that has been provided in store.

There are similar locations in Brazil, Japan and Canada.

== Criticisms and controversies ==
In March 2010, Kit Kat was targeted for a boycott by Greenpeace for using palm oil, which the environmental organisation claimed resulted in destruction of forest habitats for orangutans in Indonesia. A YouTube video by Greenpeace went viral and Nestlé announced a partnership with The Forest Trust to establish &quot;responsible sourcing guidelines&quot; and ensure that its products did not have a deforestation footprint. They aimed to achieve a fully sustainable method of palm oil harvesting by 2015. Nestlé stated that 58% of palm oil purchased in 2017 was certified responsibly sourced. By 2023 the figure was 100% with 96% being deforestation free.

== Ingredients ==
Kit Kat filling was revealed to be (or at least contain) crushed up Kit Kat, in BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Inside the Factory&quot;.

Original Kit Kat ingredients unless otherwise stated, listed by decreasing weight: milk chocolate (sugar, milk ingredients, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, whey powder, lactose, soya lecithin, polyglycerol polyricinoleate, natural flavour), wheat flour, sugar, modified palm oil, cocoa, sodium bicarbonate, soya lecithin, yeast, and natural flavour.

=== Europe ===
Milk chocolate (66%) (sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, dried whole milk, cocoa mass, lactose and proteins from whey, whey powder, emulsifier (sunflower lecithin), butterfat, flavouring), wheat flour, sugar, vegetable fat, cocoa mass, yeast, raising agent (sodium bicarbonate), salt, emulsifier (soya lecithin), flavourings.

In 2006, the UK four-finger Kit Kat contained 233 dietary calories (kcal) (975 kilojoules). In 2009, the two-finger Kit Kat contained 107 calories.

In 2013, the UK Kit Kat Chunky contained 247 calories which reduced to 207 calories in 2015. This correlated to a reduction in weight by 19% from 48 g to 40 g.

=== United States ===
Hershey&#x27;s Kit Kat Crisp Wafers in Chocolate contain sugar, wheat flour, cocoa butter, nonfat milk, chocolate, refined palm kernel oil, lactose (milk), milk fat, contains 2% or less of: soy lecithin, PGPR (emulsifier), yeast, artificial flavor, salt, and sodium bicarbonate.

=== Canada ===
Milk chocolate (sugar, milk ingredients, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, whey powder, lactose, soya lecithin, polyglycerol polyricinoleate, natural flavour), wheat flour, sugar, modified palm oil, cocoa, sodium bicarbonate, soya lecithin, yeast, natural flavour.

Dark chocolate: cocoa mass, sugar, wheat flour, palm kernel, palm, coconut and vegetable oils, modified milk ingredients, cocoa butter, sunflower and soy lecithins, yeast, sodium bicarbonate, calcium sulphate, salt, protease, xylanase, natural flavours.

=== Asia ===

In Japan, Kit Kats are produced at Nestlé-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura. The milk chocolate used for Kit Kats is made from whole-milk powder and Nestlé buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa.

Nestlé has factories in various locations in China, to supply to China and Hong Kong. During the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, where melamine was found to have tainted some milk suppliers in China, importers in Hong Kong chose to import bars manufactured in the United Kingdom.

<text>The Miami Herald is an American daily newspaper owned by The McClatchy Company and headquartered in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Founded in 1903, it is the fifth-largest newspaper in Florida, serving Miami-Dade, Broward, and Monroe counties.

It once circulated throughout Florida, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; has been awarded 24 Pulitzer Prizes.

==Overview==
The newspaper has been awarded 24 Pulitzer Prizes since beginning publication in 1903. Well-known columnists include Pulitzer-winning political commentator Leonard Pitts Jr., Pulitzer-winning reporter Mirta Ojito, humorist Dave Barry and novelist Carl Hiaasen. Other columnists have included Fred Grimm and sportswriters Michelle Kaufman, the late Edwin Pope, Dan Le Batard, Bea Hines and Greg Cote.

The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; participates in &quot;Politifact Florida&quot;, a website that focuses on Florida issues, with the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;. The &quot;Herald&quot; and the &quot;Times&quot; share resources on news stories related to Florida.

==History==
===20th century===
In 1903, Frank B. Stoneman, father of Marjory Stoneman Douglas, reorganized and moved the &quot;Orlando Record&quot; to Miami. The first edition was published September 15, 1903, as the &quot;Miami Evening Record&quot;. After the recession of 1907, the newspaper had severe financial difficulties. In December 1907 it began to publish as the &quot;Miami Morning News-Record&quot;. Its largest creditor was Henry Flagler. Through a loan from Henry Flagler, Frank B. Shutts, who was also the founder of the law firm Shutts &amp; Bowen, acquired the paper and renamed it the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; on December 1, 1910. Shutts, originally from Indiana, had come to Florida to monitor the bankruptcy proceedings of the Fort Dallas Bank. Although it is the longest continuously published newspaper in Miami, the earliest newspaper in the region was &quot;The Tropical Sun&quot;, established in 1891. &quot;The Miami Metropolis&quot;, which later became &quot;The Miami News&quot;, was founded in 1896, and was the &quot;Herald&quot;″s oldest competitor until 1988, when it went out of business.

During the Florida land boom of the 1920s, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; was the largest newspaper in the world, as measured by lines of advertising. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the &quot;Herald&quot; came close to receivership, but recovered.

On October 25, 1939, John S. Knight, son of a noted Ohio newspaperman, bought the &quot;Herald&quot; from Frank B. Shutts. Knight became editor and publisher, and made his brother, James L. Knight, the business manager. The &quot;Herald&quot; had 383 employees. Lee Hills arrived as city editor in September 1942. He later became the &quot;Herald&quot;″s publisher and eventually the chairman of Knight-Ridder Inc., a position he held until 1981.

The &quot;Herald&quot; was also involved in its first First Amendment Supreme Court case, Pennekamp v. Florida 328 U.S. 331 (1946), in which it and one of its editors, John D. Pennekamp for whom John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park is named for, were held in contempt of court by the Dade County Circuit Court for two publications it made on November 2 and November 7 in 1944, both of which were critical of the court&#x27;s operations. The Supreme Court sided with Pennekamp and the &quot;Herald&quot;, and ultimately held that under the facts of that case, &quot;the danger to fair judicial administration has not the clearness and immediacy necessary to close the door of permissible public comment, and the judgment is reversed as violative of petitioners&#x27; right of free expression in the press under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.&quot;

&quot;The Miami Herald International Edition&quot;, printed by partner newspapers throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, began in 1946. It is commonly available at resorts in the Caribbean countries such as the Dominican Republic, and, though printed by the largest local newspaper &quot;Listín Diario&quot;, it is not available outside such tourist areas. It was extended to Mexico in 2002.

The &quot;Herald&quot; won its first Pulitzer Prize in 1950, for its reporting on Miami&#x27;s organized crime. Its circulation was 176,000 daily and 204,000 on Sundays.

On August 19, 1960, construction began on the &quot;Herald&quot; building on Biscayne Bay. Also on that day, Alvah H. Chapman, started work as James Knight&#x27;s assistant. Chapman was later promoted to Knight-Ridder chairman and chief executive officer. The &quot;Herald&quot; moved into its new building at One Herald Plaza&lt;ref name=&quot;nbcmiami/3023531&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;opa-locka/demolition&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;miamiherald/273648785&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; without missing an edition on March 23–24, 1963.

The paper also won another press freedom case in &quot;Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo&quot; (1974). In the case, Pat Tornillo Jr., president of the United Teachers of Dade, had requested that the &quot;Herald&quot; print his rebuttal to an editorial criticizing him, citing Florida&#x27;s &quot;right-to-reply&quot; law, which mandated that newspapers print such responses. Represented by longtime counsel Dan Paul, the &quot;Herald&quot; challenged the law, and the case was appealed to the Supreme Court. The Court unanimously overturned the Florida statute under the Press Freedom Clause of the First Amendment, ruling that &quot;Governmental compulsion on a newspaper to publish that which &#x27;reason&#x27; tells it should not be published is unconstitutional.&quot; The decision showed the limitations of a 1969 decision, &quot;Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission&quot;, in which a similar &quot;fairness doctrine&quot; had been upheld for radio and television, and establishing that broadcast and print media had different Constitutional protections.

The first African American man to be a reporter at the &quot;Herald&quot; was Thirlee Smith, Jr. in 1967.
The first African American woman to work as a reporter at the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; was Bea Hines, starting on June 16, 1970. Hines was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1981 for columns which included topics like police brutality and profiling.

Publication of a Spanish-language supplemental insert named &quot;El Herald&quot; began in 1976. It was renamed &quot;El Nuevo Herald&quot; in 1987, and in 1998 became an independent publication. The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; and &quot;El Nuevo Herald&quot; quickly took diverging editorial directions, sometimes leading to tense relations and conflicting information about the Hispanic community in the USA.

In 1997, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; assigned the first national reporter charged with covering LGBT news. Reporter Steve Rothaus, who had been with the paper since 1985, was assigned to this post. After more than 33 years with the paper, Rothaus retired in 2019 as part of a buyout offer made to 450 employees.

===21st century===
In 2002, the Miami Herald launched its own &quot;Home &amp; Design&quot; magazine (created by Sarah Harrelson). In 2003, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; and &quot;El Universal&quot; of Mexico City created an international joint venture, and in 2004 they together launched &quot;The Herald Mexico&quot;, a short-lived English-language newspaper for readers in Mexico. Its final issue was published in May 2007.

On July 27, 2005, former Miami city commissioner Arthur Teele walked into the main lobby of the &quot;Herald&quot;″s headquarters and phoned &quot;Herald&quot; columnist Jim DeFede, one of several telephone conversations that the two had had during the day, to say that he had a package for DeFede. He then asked a security officer to tell his (Teele&#x27;s) wife Stephanie that he loved her, before pulling out a gun and committing suicide. This happened the day the &quot;Miami New Times&quot;, a weekly newspaper, published salacious details of Teele&#x27;s alleged affairs, including allegations that he had had sex and used cocaine with a transsexual prostitute.

The day before committing suicide, Teele had had another telephone conversation with DeFede, who recorded this call without Teele&#x27;s knowledge, which was illegal under Florida law. DeFede admitted to the &quot;Herald&quot;″s management that he had taped the call. Although the paper used quotes from the tape in its coverage, DeFede was fired the next day for violating the paper&#x27;s code of ethics, and he was likely guilty of a felony.

Many journalists and readers of the &quot;Herald&quot; disagreed with the decision to fire rather than suspend DeFede, arguing that it had been made in haste and that the punishment was disproportionate to the offense. 528 journalists, including about 200 current and former &quot;Herald&quot; staffers, called on the &quot;Herald&quot; to reinstate DeFede, but the paper&#x27;s management refused to back down. The state attorney&#x27;s office later declined to file charges against the columnist, holding that the potential violation was &quot;without a (living) victim or a complainant&quot;.

On September 8, 2006, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;″s president Jesús Díaz Jr. fired three journalists because they had allegedly been paid by the United States government to work for anti-Cuba propaganda TV and radio channels. The three were Pablo Alfonso, Wilfredo Cancio Isla and Olga Connor. Less than a month later, responding to pressure from the Cuban community in Miami, Díaz resigned after reinstating the fired journalists, saying that &quot;policies prohibiting such behavior were ambiguously communicated, inconsistently applied and widely misunderstood over many years&quot;. Nevertheless, he continued to state that such payments, especially if made from organs of the state, violate the principles of journalistic independence. At least seven other journalists who did not work at the &quot;Herald&quot;, namely Miguel Cossio, Carlos Alberto Montaner, Juan Manuel Cao, Ariel Remos, Omar Claro, Helen Aguirre Ferre, Paul Crespo, and Ninoska Perez-Castellón, were also paid for programs on Radio Martí or TV Martí, both financed by the government of the United States through the Broadcasting Board of Governors, receiving a total of between 15,000 and 175,000 since 2001.

In May 2011, the paper announced it had sold of Biscayne Bayfront land surrounding its headquarters in the Arts &amp; Entertainment District of Downtown Miami for $236million, to a Malaysian resort developer, Genting Malaysia Berhad. McClatchy announced that the &quot;Herald&quot; and &quot;El Nuevo Herald&quot; would be moving to another location by 2013. In May 2013, the paper moved to a new building in suburban Doral. The old building was demolished in 2014.

In November 2018, the &quot;Herald&quot; broke the story that &quot;in 2007, despite substantial evidence that corroborated [female teenagers&#x27;] stories of [sexual] abuse by [Jeffrey] Epstein, the U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, signed off on a secret deal for the multimillionaire, one that ensured he would never spend a day in prison.&quot; Thus, the full extent of Epstein&#x27;s crimes and his collaborators remained hidden and the victims unaware of this arrangement. In July 2019, Epstein was charged with sex trafficking dozens of minors between 2002 and 2005; reporting at the time noted how the &quot;Herald&quot; brought public attention to accusations against Epstein.

On December 17, 2019, it was announced the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; would move to a six-days-a-week format.

On January 21, 2020, it was announced that the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; would close its Doral printing plant and move its printing and packaging operations to the South Florida &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot;&#x27;s printing facilities in Deerfield Beach. The &quot;Herald&quot; stopped printing its own editions as of April 26, 2020.

==Community involvement==
The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; sponsors several community involvement projects, such as those detailed below.

The Wish Book program lets community members who are suffering from hardships ask for help from the paper&#x27;s readers. Wishes have included asking for donations to buy medical equipment for a sick child, help with renovations to make a home wheelchair-accessible, monetary donations to an impoverished family dealing with cancer treatments, and help to an elderly resident wanting to learn how to use a computer. Readers may donate to specific causes or to the program at large.

The &quot;Herald&quot; also co-sponsors spelling bees and athletic awards in South Florida. 

The &quot;Tropic&quot; section and its columnist Dave Barry run the Herald Hunt, a unique annual puzzlehunt in the Miami area.

===Miami Herald Silver Knight Awards===
The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; Silver Knight Awards is one of the most highly regarded student awards programs in the United States. The Awards program recognizes outstanding individuals and leaders who have maintained good grades and have applied their knowledge and talents to contribute service to their schools and communities. The Silver Knight Awards program was instituted at the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; in 1959 by John S. Knight, past publisher of The Miami Herald, founder and editor emeritus of Knight-Ridder Newspapers and winner of the 1968 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing.

The program is open to high school seniors with a minimum 3.2 GPA (unweighted) in public, charter, private, and parochial schools in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Students may be recognized in one of 15 categories: Art, Athletics, Business, Digital and Interactive (previously New Media), Drama, English and Literature, General Scholarship, Journalism, Mathematics, Music and Dance, Science, Social Science, Speech, Vocational-Technical, and World Languages. Each school may only nominate one student per category.

A panel of independent judges appointed by the Miami Herald for each category interviews the nominees in that category. Each panel selects one Silver Knight and three Honorable Mentions in its category for each of the two counties (30 Silver Knights and 90 Honorable Mentions each year). The honorees are revealed during the Silver Knight Awards ceremony, televised locally from Miami&#x27;s James L. Knight Center. In 2020, Silver Knights received a $2,000 scholarship, a Silver Knight statue, an AAdvantage 25,000-mile travel certificate and a medallion (from sponsor American Airlines). Honorable Mentions each received a $500 scholarship and an engraved plaque.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 awards ceremony was live-streamed on May 28 from a video studio at the Miami Herald&#x27;s newsroom; the nominees attended via Zoom video conference.

The Silver Knight Awards have been given in Miami-Dade County since 1959 and in Broward County since 1984. Silver Knight Awards were given to Palm Beach County students from 1985 through 1990. The program is sponsored by organizations with ties to South Florida; the cash awards have been made possible over the years in part by the support of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation.

==Headquarters==
Miami Herald Media Company, which owns the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; and &quot;El Nuevo Herald&quot;, is headquartered in Sweetwater, Miami-Dade County, Florida.

The previous headquarters, One Herald Plaza, were located on a plot in Biscayne Bay, Miami. This facility opened in March 1963. In 2011 the Genting Group, a Malaysian company, offered to pay the Miami Herald Media Company $236million for the current headquarters property. The company began scouting for a new headquarters location after finalizing the sale. The then president and publisher of the media company, David Landsberg, stated that it was not necessary at that point to be located in the city center, and remaining there would be too expensive. The newspaper moved to its current Doral headquarters in 2013. On April 28, 2014, demolition began on the building on Biscayne Bay between the MacArthur and Venetian causeways.

In a later period it was headquartered in Doral, Florida. It is located in a two‑story, building that had been the U.S. Southern Command center. The newspaper used of space for office purposes. In 2013 there were 650 people working there. The newspaper had purchased land adjacent to the headquarters to build the printing plant. The newspaper, working during the COVID-19 pandemic in Florida, was to close its Doral offices in August 2020 and later relocate to a new facility after a period of remote work. The remote work began prior to the closure of the office, which did occur. The publication sold the Doral office in September 2021, getting $27.3 million.

In 2023 the newspaper announced its new headquarters would be in the Waterford Business District.

=== Missouri Lifestyle Journalism Awards ===
In the 1960s under the leadership of Women&#x27;s Page editor Marie Anderson and assistant women&#x27;s page editor Marjorie Paxson the &quot;Herald&quot; won four Missouri Lifestyle Journalism Awards (then called the Penney-Missouri Awards) for General Excellence. The section won the award in 1960, the year of the awards&#x27; inauguration. In 1961, it won again, and the program director asked Anderson to sit the 1962 awards out. In 1963 the paper took second place, and in 1964 another first, and the paper was barred from competing for the next five years. In 1969 it won another first. Kimberly Wilmot Voss and Lance Speere, writing in the scholarly journal &quot;Florida Historical Quarterly&quot;, said Anderson &quot;personified&quot; the Penney-Missouri competition&#x27;s goals.

<text>The Bruce Highway is a major highway in Queensland, Australia. Commencing in the state capital, Brisbane, it passes through areas close to the eastern coast on its way to Cairns in Far North Queensland. The route is part of the Australian National Highway and also part of Highway 1, the longest highway route in Australia. Its length is approximately ; it is entirely sealed with bitumen. The highway is named after a popular former Queensland and federal politician, Harry Bruce. Bruce was the state Minister for Works in the mid-1930s when the highway was named after him. The highway once passed through Brisbane, but was truncated at Bald Hills when the Gateway Motorway became National Highway 1 upon its opening in December 1986. I

It was previously known as the Great North Coast Road, being renamed as the Bruce Highway in 1934 after the state&#x27;s Minister for Public Works, Henry Bruce. 

The highway is the biggest traffic carrier in Queensland. It initially joined all the major coastal centres; however, a number of bypasses, particularly in the south, have diverted traffic around these cities to expedite traffic flow and ease urban congestion. As a result, the highway is constantly being shortened. The road is a dual carriageway from Brisbane to Curra, north of Gympie, many of these upgrades being completed in the 1980s (Glass House Mountains, Tanawha, Maryborough) and 1990s (Nambour, Yandina, and Cooroy).

The highway commences just south of the bridge over the Pine River at the Gateway Motorway interchange, north of the Brisbane central business district. The highway has changed its route numbering from National Highway 1 to the M1 (motorway road) or A1 (single carriageway, generally with overtaking lanes).

Major cities along the route include Gympie, Maryborough, Rockhampton, Mackay, Townsville, and Cairns. The highway passes the Glasshouse Mountains, rainforests and pastures in the Sunshine Coast, the Gunalda Range (north of Gympie), Mount Larcom (north of Gladstone), and the arid countryside north of Rockhampton; after that, it passes through land predominantly used for sugar cane, crop growing and dairy farms and the sub-tropics and tropics.

In November 2024, the Bruce Highway Advisory Council was re-established.

In January 2025, the Australian prime minister announced that the Bruce Highway would get AU$7.2 billion dollars funding from the Australian Government. This funding is meant to upgrade failing sections of the highway between Mackay and Bowen, notably around the very flood prone section south of Proserpine known as Goorganga Plains. This section is earmarked for an elevated carriageway similar to what was built at the Yeppen Floodplain near Rockhampton. The Goorganga Plains section can be closed for days resulting in huge economic loss for the state of Queensland.

==State-controlled road==

The Bruce Highway is a state-controlled road, subdivided into fourteen sections for administrative and funding purposes. All sections are part of the National Highway.

The sections are:
* 10A – Brisbane to Gympie
* 10B – Gympie to Maryborough
* 10C – Maryborough to Gin Gin
* 10D – Gin Gin to Benaraby
* 10E – Benaraby to Rockhampton
* 10F – Rockhampton to St Lawrence
* 10G – St Lawrence to Mackay
* 10H – Mackay to Proserpine
* 10J – Proserpine to Bowen
* 10K – Bowen to Ayr
* 10L – Ayr to Townsville
* 10M – Townsville to Ingham
* 10N – Ingham to Innisfail
* 10P – Innisfail to Cairns

State-controlled roads that intersect with the highway are listed in the main article.

==Route description==
Commencing in Bald Hills at the junction of the Gateway Motorway and Gympie Arterial Road, the Bruce Highway is a motorway standard road (signed as the M1) for its first to Curra, where it becomes a two-lane sealed highway for most of its remainder. The first to the Dohles Rocks Road interchange has eight lanes and a variable (electronically signed) speed limit of up to . The next to the Caboolture / Bribie Island interchange has six lanes and a maximum speed limit of . From there to Kybong the road has four lanes and, with one short exception, a speed limit of .

===Brisbane to Rockhampton===
====Bald Hills to Caboolture====

This section of the Bruce Highway crosses the Pine River into the City of Moreton Bay, passing through mainly urban areas before crossing the Caboolture River and reaching the Caboolture / Bribie Island interchange after . It runs past or through Murrumba Downs, Griffin, Kallangur, Mango Hill, North Lakes, Dakabin, Narangba, Burpengary and Morayfield. On the way it is crossed by the Redcliffe Peninsula railway line and passes the Caboolture BP Travel Centre.

====Caboolture to Caloundra====

The Caboolture / Bribie Island interchange also provides access to the D&#x27;Aguilar Highway via a service road. After the D&#x27;Aguilar Highway interchange the Bruce passes through mainly rural areas and the Beerburrum and Beerwah State Forests, entering the Sunshine Coast Region before reaching the Caloundra Road interchange after a further . It passes the southern entry to Steve Irwin Way, a bypassed section of the highway, which provides access to Beerburrum, Glass House Mountains, Beerwah, Australia Zoo and Landsborough before terminating at the Caloundra Road interchange.

The Caloundra Road Interchange is also Australia&#x27;s first Diverging diamond interchange.

====Caloundra to Noosa====

The next to the Sunshine Motorway interchange, providing access to the Sunshine Coast, widens to 3 lanes in either direction. It then narrows back to 2 lanes. After another the Maroochydore Road interchange provides access to Maroochydore and Woombye. The Bli Bli Road interchange, after a further , provides access to Bli Bli and Nambour. The Yandina–Coolum Road interchange, after , provides access to Yandina and Coolum. The Eumundi interchange, after , provides access to Eumundi and Noosa. The Cooroy interchange, after , provides access to Cooroy, Tewantin and Noosa. Total distance from Caloundra Road to this interchange is .

====Noosa to Gympie====

The to the end of the M1 at Kybong includes three interchanges that provide access to the Old Bruce Highway. From Kybong the highway is designated A1. It has numerous parts with lower speed limits, including urban areas, high crash zones and roadwork sites. After from Kybong the Mary Valley Road interchange provides access to the west of the Mary River. The highway then passes through the Gympie urban fringe, with several at grade intersections providing access to various parts of the city. North of Gympie, from the Mary Valley Road interchange, the Wide Bay Highway interchange is reached, providing access to Kilkivan. Total distance from the Cooroy interchange is .

====Gympie to Maryborough====

The from the Wide Bay Highway interchange to the Maryborough–Biggenden Road interchange at Maryborough passes through Tiaro and the Gympie Road exit to Maryborough before crossing the Mary River.

====Maryborough to Rockhampton====

The highway maintains a speed limit of 100 occasionally slowing down to 60 or 50 while driving through several small towns including Childers, Gin Gin, Miriam Vale and Mount Larcom before reaching Rockhampton.

==Development of the M1==

With the completion of Section C of the &quot;Bruce Highway – Cooroy to Curra&quot; upgrade project (Traveston to Woondum) in February 2018 the M1 has now been extended to Kybong, south of Gympie. The Bruce Highway from Kybong to Gympie remains signed as A1. Section D of the project (Woondum to Curra, including a bypass of Gympie) will, when completed in 2024, become the next stage of the M1.

While the references use Woondum as a designator for sections of the project the new intersection that marks the end of the M1 is wholly within the locality of Kybong, although bordered on two sides by Woondum.

==History==

===Remnants of early roads to the north of Brisbane===
Roads to the north of Brisbane in the early days of settlement were constrained by the need to use reliable low level crossings of rivers and creeks well upstream from the coast.

South Pine Road runs from Enoggera Road at Alderley through Everton Park to Everton Hills, crossing Kedron Brook.

Bunya Road runs from South Pine Road at Everton Hills to Eatons Crossing Road at Draper, after crossing the South Pine River at Drapers Crossing (a fordable crossing).

Old Northern Road runs from South Pine Road at Everton Park to &quot;another&quot; South Pine Road at Albany Creek. Eatons Crossing Road runs from this road (north of the South Pine River) to Draper. This South Pine Road continues north over the South Pine River via Cash&#x27;s Crossing and thence to Gympie Road at Strathpine.

Old North Road links this South Pine Road at Brendale to Youngs Crossing Road at Bray Park. Youngs Crossing Road continues to Dayboro Road at Petrie after crossing the North Pine River.
Further upstream, Whiteside Road (now submerged by Lake Samsonvale) provided a fordable crossing at Quinn&#x27;s Crossing when water level was too high at Youngs Crossing.

Further north, another segment of Old North Road starts at Caboolture River Road in Upper Caboolture, crosses the Caboolture River at Zillmans Crossing and proceeds to Wamuran.

Early roads from the North Pine River crossing to the Caboolture River crossing may have included parts of:
* Narangba Road from Anzac Avenue in Kallangur to Narangba, where it becomes (after a short distance as Main Street) Oakey Flat Road , to Morayfield Road at Morayfield.
* Burpengary Road from Boundary Road at Dakabin to Burpengary, where it becomes Station Road. From Station Road the direct route to Morayfield follows Obrien Road and Lindsay Road.
* Old Gympie Road from Anzac Avenue in Kallangur to Morayfield Road at Burpengary.
* Caboolture River Road from Morayfield Road at Morayfield to Old North Road at Upper Caboolture.

The Oakey Flat Road route avoids the crossing of Burpengary Creek on Obrien Road at Burpengary. From Oakey Flat Road at Morayfield a route consisting of Williamson Road, Forest Hills Drive, Haywood Road and Moorina Road runs to Caboolture River Road at Upper Caboolture, avoiding the crossing of Sheep Station Creek on Morayfield Road at Morayfield.

Early roads from Caboolture (after travelling east from Wamuran) to Landsborough and then to the Bruce Highway at Palmview may have included parts of:
* Another segment of Old Gympie Road from Caboolture to Landsborough.
* Beerburrum Road from Caboolture to Beerburrum, where it joins the Steve Irwin Way to Landsborough and Palmview.

===Tom Petrie’s roads===

====Murrumba Homestead Grounds====

The following quotations are from the Murrumba Homestead Grounds article.

* &quot;To facilitate his timber operations Tom Petrie marked out several early northern roads, including a track between the Pine River and Bald Hills and a trail from Murrumba to Maroochydore, which later became the Gympie Road. He also blazed a track from North Pine to Humpybong (Redcliffe).&quot;
* &quot;In 1869 Cobb &amp; Co opened a coach route from Brisbane to Gympie via the route Tom had helped mark out.&quot;

====Anzac Avenue====

Anzac Avenue is part of the history of the Bruce Highway as the highway followed it from Petrie to Rothwell for many years prior to the construction of its present alignment.

The following quotation is from the Anzac Avenue article.

* &quot;A road from Bald Hills to Redcliffe was formed by the early 1860s, but by 1864 this was almost impassable. Tom Petrie marked a track from the Hays Inlet crossing and in the early 1870s assisted in surveying the road. Known as the &quot;Brisbane Road&quot; it became the primary way of accessing the Redcliffe Peninsula by road.&quot;

==Upgrades==
One of the most dramatic deviations of the highway was the Bald Hills to Burpengary Deviation. Beginning construction in 1972, the new route stretched from Roghan Road at Bald Hills to Deception Bay Road at Burpengary. From Strathpine Road/Hoyland Street to Deception Bay Road the new highway used the Northern Freeway corridor reserved in 1965 as part of Wilbur Smith’s freeway plan. Construction took place across four stages, the last of which was opened on 10 November 1977.

Due to the nature of wet weather and tropical cyclone prone areas of North Queensland, the highway is prone to frequent flooding in a number of places. Following the catastrophic Queensland floods in 2010–2011 the Australian Government commissioned a feasibility study on flood-proofing the highway.

Numerous stretches of the highway are set to undergo redevelopment, realignment, flood-proofing and extension of dual carriageway sections. Former Premier Anna Bligh announced the plans while launching the Queensland Infrastructure Plan (Now (A part of) known as Building Our Future, it includes all Transport Infrastructure Projects Nation-wide). The works are expected to total A$2 billion and include 77 projects over a period of two decades. As of December 2020, 23 major projects had been completed under the program including the delivery of 64 bridges, 30 new rest stops, 300 km safer roadsides, and 190 km wide centre line treatments.

To improve flood immunity of the highway south of Childers, a new and improved road alignment and a higher bridge over the Isis River were completed in September 2011.

Between the Gateway Motorway and Caboolture, the highway has been widened to eight and six lanes since 2001, including the Dohles Rocks Road to Boundary Road section in October 2004, the Boundary Road to Uhlmann Road section in March 2007, and the latest section Uhlmann Road to Bribie Island Road in November 2009. Extension of the six lane section to Steve Irwin Way is proposed to commence in 2020.

A new interchange has been built at the notorious intersection of Roys Road at Beerwah. It also connects to the nearby Bells Creek Road, eliminating another dangerous intersection. 

The Nambour-Bli Bli Road interchange was upgraded in 1998 from a half-diamond to a dumbbell. The old interchange had lasted just 8 years. Later on, the entire Nambour Bypass went through a process of rehabilitation due to the extremely rough surface and dangerous pothole appearances during wet weather. This work was completed in 2009.

As of 2020 Sections A, B &amp; C of the joint State and Federal funded Cooroy to Curra upgrade of the highway are open. The final part of the upgrade, Section D, which provides a motorway-standard bypass of Gympie, opened in October 2024.

===Road train access to Rockhampton (stage 2)===
The project for upgrading between Gracemere saleyards and the Rockhampton abattoirs to provide access for Type 1 Road Trains was completed by early 2021 at a total cost of $30 million. It involved about of road improvements on four roads:
* Capricorn Highway – from Saleyards Road at Gracemere to the Bruce Highway roundabout at Rockhampton ().
* Bruce Highway – from the Capricorn Highway roundabout to the Yaamba Road intersection ().

 To facilitate the use of electric vehicles the Queensland Government has installed fast chargers in convenient, safe locations close to major highways where there are existing amenities such as cafes, restaurants and shops. This network is collectively described as the Queensland Electric Super Highway. For a limited time charging electric vehicles at these stations will be free. The majority of these are along the Bruce Highway, at the locations listed below (from south to north):
* Cooroy
* Maryborough
* Gin Gin
* Childers
* Miriam Vale
* Mt Larcom
* Rockhampton
* Marlborough
* Carmila
* Mackay
* Proserpine
* Bowen
* Ayr
* Townsville
* Cardwell
* Tully
* Cairns

Other locations are:
* Hamilton
* Helensvale
* Coolangatta
* Springfield
* Gatton
* Toowoomba

===Precise locations===
Only three of the charging stations are on the highway. They are at Cardwell, Marlborough and Carmila (Puma Service Stations) The others are some distance from the highway in car parks or other places as listed in the reference. Note that the reference does not include the precise location of the Townsville charging station.

===Distances===
The greatest distance between charging stations used to be about 216 km from Townsville to Tully. Other stages greater than 150 km (which may have exceeded the range of some electric vehicles) were:
* Childers to Miriam Vale (about 155 km)
* Miriam Vale to Rockhampton (about 170 km)
* Mackay to Bowen (about 191 km)
* Bowen to Townsville (about 202 km)

===Phase 2===
The distance issues described above have been alleviated with phase 2 of the project which added more charging stations, for example at Gin Gin, Mt Larcom, Proserpine and Ayr.

===Phase 3===
The network has been extended to the west, encompassing locations from the east coast to and between Cummamulla, Cloncurry, Longreach and Mount Isa.

==Bruce Highway Advisory Council==
In November 2024, the Bruce Highway Advisory Council was re-established.

<doc id="607805" wikidata="Q1867273" url="?curid=607805" title="Loch Long">
<text>Loch Long is a body of water in the council area of Argyll and Bute, Scotland. The sea loch extends from the Firth of Clyde at its southwestern end, to the Arrochar Alps at the head of the loch. It measures approximately in length, with a width of between . The loch also has an arm, Loch Goil, on its western side.

Loch Long forms part of the coast of the Cowal Peninsula, and forms the entire western coastline of the Rosneath Peninsula.

Loch Long was historically the boundary between Argyll and Dunbartonshire; however, boundary redrawing in 1996 meant that it moved wholly within the council area of Argyll and Bute.

==Villages on Loch Long==

Villages and hamlets on the loch include.

==Royal Navy==

On the eastern shore of the Loch is the Royal Navy&#x27;s Coulport Armament depot, with the Glen Mallan jetty, both part of Defence Munitions Glen Douglas. Part of the extensive Royal Navy&#x27;s, His Majesty&#x27;s Naval Base Clyde.

===Historic===

In Arrochar, the Royal Naval Torpedo Testing Station and Range was established on the Loch in 1912, in connection with the Clyde Torpedo Works on Eldon Street, Greenock, established in 1910. Both sites are now closed.

==Finnart Oil Terminal==
The Finnart Oil Terminal is located on the eastern shore of the loch, linked to the Grangemouth Refinery via a pipeline.

In September 2024, it was announced that the oil terminal is scheduled for closure.

==Environment and concerns==

Loch Long has a long term issue with rubbish collecting at the head of the loch. Rubbish mainly washed down water courses from the Glasgow area.

==History==

Its name is not a reference to is length; it actually comes from the Gaelic for &quot;ship lake&quot;. Prior to their defeat at the Battle of Largs in 1263, Viking raiders sailed up Loch Long to Arrochar, and then dragged their longships 2 miles overland to Tarbet and into Loch Lomond. Being inland, the settlements around Loch Lomond were more vulnerable to attack.

===Transport===

The steamboat &quot;Chancellor&quot; used to traverse the loch, departing Dunoon at 11:00 and returning about five hours later. PS &quot;Waverley&quot; was also built to serve Loch Long and Loch Goil from 1947, a route that she still sailed as of 2021, albeit as more of an attraction than a primary means of transport.

<doc id="607811" wikidata="Q1345442" url="?curid=607811" title="Fastnet Race">
<text>The Fastnet Race is a biennial offshore yacht race organized by the Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC) of the United Kingdom with the assistance of the Royal Yacht Squadron in Cowes and the City of Cherbourg in France. 

The race is named after the Fastnet Rock off southern Ireland, which the race course rounds. Along with Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race and the Newport-Bermuda Race, it is considered one of the classic big offshore races with each distance approximately , testing both inshore and offshore skills, boat and crew preparation and speed potential. From its inception, the Fastnet Race has proven highly influential in the growth of offshore racing and remains closely linked to advances in yacht design, sailing technique and safety equipment.

The Fastnet Race has been sponsored by the Swiss watch manufacturing company Rolex since 2001. The Race prize is known as the Fastnet Challenge Cup.

The race&#x27;s main focus is on monohull handicap racing, which is presently conducted under the Royal Ocean Racing Club&#x27;s own IRC Rating Rule, which is awarded the overall trophy. However, the race has recently opened to more classes, including multihulls and providing one design class starts for the Volvo Ocean Race Class, IMOCA 60 and Class40. It has also seen an increase in participation in double-handed racing.

==Course==

The Fastnet is a challenging race. Taking place in August, the race is often provided with Westerlies that are strong to gale force in strength. The succession of low pressure systems which advance on Ireland and Britain across the North Atlantic Ocean provide a constantly moving weather pattern for which Fastnet navigators must plan. These depressions are mostly centered north of the English Channel. Knowledge of where meteorological disturbances are likely to occur, and how best to use them, is key to success in the race.

===1925 to 2019 course===

The Fastnet Race took place every two years over a course of . The race started off Cowes on the Isle of Wight on the south coast of England at the Royal Yacht Squadron. Leaving the Solent through the Needles Channel, the race followed the southern coastline of England westward down the English Channel before rounding Land&#x27;s End. After crossing the Celtic Sea, the race rounded the Fastnet Rock off the southwest coast of Ireland. Returning on a largely reciprocal course, the race rounded the Isles of Scilly before finishing at Plymouth.

The Royal Western Yacht Club, which supported the RORC with the finish of the race in Plymouth, now runs a race on the original course.

===2021 course===
The race starts off the Royal Yacht Squadron start line of Cowes on the Isle of Wight on the south coast of England at the Royal Yacht Squadron. Leaving the Solent through the Needles Channel, the race follows the southern coastline of England westward down the English Channel, before rounding Land&#x27;s End. After crossing the Celtic Sea, the race rounds the Fastnet Rock off the southwest coast of Ireland. Returning on a largely reciprocal course, the race rounds the Isles of Scilly before finishing at Cherbourg.

The finish was changed to Cherbourg from Plymouth in order to accommodate increased fleet sizes. Facilities at Plymouth were cited by organizers as one of the main reasons for the change. This was not universally welcomed due to the nearly 100 year heritage of the course and race. This change also increases the course distance to over .

Coastal landmarks passed along the route include: The Needles, Portland Bill, Start Point, The Lizard, Land&#x27;s End, the Fastnet Rock, Bishop&#x27;s Rock off Scilly, and Cherbourg breakwater.

==History==
Weston Martyr, a British yachtsman, conceived the idea of the race after having competed in Bermudian yacht races. Entered by seven vessels, the inaugural Fastnet Race was won by &quot;Jolie Brise&quot; in 1925. The race ran annually until 1931, and subsequently biennially apart from a break after 1939 during World War II, resuming in 1947.

===1979 Fastnet Race===

A severe European windstorm during the 1979 race resulted in the deaths of 21 people (15 competing yachtsmen and 6 observers) and the involvement of some 4,000 others in what became the largest-ever rescue operation in peacetime. The disaster led to a major overhaul of the rules and the equipment required for the competition. Several books have since been written about the 1979 race, which remains notorious in the yachting world for its loss of life. In the 1979 race, &quot;15 sailors died, five boats sank, and at least 75 boats flipped upside down&quot;.

===Capsize of &quot;Drum&quot; (1985)===
The race drew further attention from outside the sport in 1985 when the maxi yacht &quot;Drum&quot; capsized after the keel sheared off due to a design error. The boat was helmed by the New Zealander Phil Holland, brother of its designer Ron Holland. Pop star Simon Le Bon from Duran Duran, co-owner and crew member of &quot;Drum&quot;, was trapped under the hull with five other crew members for twenty minutes, until being rescued by the Royal Navy. The Search and Rescue Diver was Petty Officer Air Crewman (POACMN) Larry &quot;Scouse&quot; Slater of 771 Naval Air Squadron who appeared on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on 9 April 1986.

===1999 Fastnet Race===
Many of the fleet contestants experienced a total solar eclipse in the Celtic Sea on the way to the Fastnet Rock.

===2007 Fastnet Race===
The RORC in 2007 set an entry limit of 300 boats for the first time. The start of the 2007 Race was postponed by 25 hours, due to a severe weather warning. This was the first time this had been done in the race&#x27;s 83-year history. Overnight gale force winds and resulting extreme seas forced over three-quarters of the boats to retire, sheltering in ports along the south coast of England, including Torbay, Plymouth and Weymouth.

By 10:00hrs on 16 August, 207 boats of the 271-strong field had retired with at least three suffering rig problems.

Despite the conditions, Mike Slade&#x27;s &quot;Icap Leopard 3&quot;, launched in June 2007, set a new record of 44 hours 18 min, taking almost 9 hours off the previous record set in 1999. Ger O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s &quot;Chieftain&quot; was the overall winner on corrected time.

===2011 Fastnet Race===
A record number of 320 boats entered the 2011 race – the largest total since the ill-fated 1979 race (303 entries). A total of nineteen nations were represented, with the bulk of entries still from Britain and France.

In 2011, the 100-foot maxi yacht &quot;Rambler 100&quot; turtled after her keel broke off between Fastnet Rock and the Pantaenius Buoy (a temporary race mark placed southwest of the Fastnet Rock). All 21 crew were rescued safely. Sixteen were rescued from the upturned hull, by the RNLI Baltimore Lifeboat &quot;Hilda Jarrett&quot;. A further 5 crewmembers, including the owner/skipper George David, had floated away from the vessel, but managed to link themselves together. They were in the water for approximately 2.5 hours, before being rescued by a Baltimore based diving vessel, &quot;Wave Chieftain&quot;. One of these crewmembers, Wendy Touton, suffered hypothermia and was taken by helicopter to Tralee General Hospital. Four crew-members had been below decks at the time of capsize and were not adequately dressed for egress into the sea. All uninjured crew were taken to Baltimore. The Naval Service patrol ship &quot;LÉ Aoife&quot; remained with the hull, worth $10,000,000 before the capsize, before it was towed to Barleycove by the Castletownbere-based tug &quot;Ocean Bank&quot;.

The Fastnet Monohull Race record was set at 42hrs 39min by Volvo Open 70 &quot;Abu Dhabi&quot;, skippered by Ian Walker.

===2013 Fastnet Race===
Plymouth Yacht Haven was selected as host port RORC Increased the number of entries to meet demands. With the entry limit of 300 filled within 24 hours, over 100 boats on the waiting list and entries from multihulls, IMOCA 60s and Class 40s still coming in, demand for places in 2013&#x27;s Fastnet Race has been at its highest level thus far.

<text>Wainuiomata () is a large dormitory suburb of Lower Hutt, in the Wellington metropolitan area in New Zealand. Its population was estimated as being as of with a density of 1,600 people per km2. European settlement of Wainuiomata began in the 1850s with timber-felling and farming and began to grow in the 1920s. After World War 2 there was rapid population expansion, with Wainuiomata earning the nickname &#x27;Nappy Valley&#x27; because of the large number of families with young children. From the late 1980s the economy slowed and the population decreased, but since about 2020 there has been a housing boom and corresponding increase in population. Wainuiomata is noted for being the origin of New Zealand&#x27;s kōhanga reo (Māori-language immersion preschool) movement.

==Origin of name==
The word &#x27;Wainui-o-mata&#x27; is a Māori name made up of the words Wai = water, Nui = big, O = of, and Mata – which could refer to a woman&#x27;s name. The origins of the word are disputed, but one commonly accepted translation refers to the women who came over the Wainuiomata Hill to evade marauding tribes from the north, and who sat wailing by the stream after the slaughter of their menfolk. From this we have &#x27;faces streaming with water&#x27; or &#x27;tears&#x27; although it could equally refer to the large pools of water which lay over the swampy surface (face) of the northern end of the Valley, or the river itself which is known to flood the Wainui (Coast Road) valley.

The town is often abbreviated to Wainui by locals.

==History==
Wainuiomata occupies a basin at the headwaters of the Wainuiomata River, between the eastern Hutt hills and the Orongorongo Range. There are conflicting reports about the evidence of Māori occupation of the basin prior to European settlement. One source says there is evidence Māori were in Wainuiomata from the moa-hunting period and the iwi Rangitane, Ngāti Ira and Kahungunu were all settled there. The earliest European settlements grew up around the river, where timber mills supplied the Wellington region when the demand was great in the 1850s and &#x27;60s. Today this area is known as &quot;The Village&quot; or &quot;Homedale&quot;. The isolated location of Wainuiomata proved a problem for early settlers. Narrow hill-routes into the settlement were the only access during the 1850s and 1860s. By the end of the 19th century there were two roads in the valley: Main Road and Fitzherbert Road (known locally as &quot;Swamp Road&quot;).

The town&#x27;s economy in these early days largely depended on timber milling from the forests around the Wainuiomata River. In the 1850s Sir William Fitzherbert started a flax-milling business in the north of the valley, but this proved economically unviable.

In 1866 the Methodist Wainuiomata Coast Road Church was built on land donated by settler Richard Prouse. The oldest Methodist church and the third-oldest church in the Wellington region, it was used for regular services until the congregation outgrew it and moved to the new St Stephens Church in 1957.

With the clearing of the forests, sheep- and dairy-farming became an important part of the local economy. The settlement started to grow in the 1920s.

In 1928 Wainui-o-Mata Development Limited formed for the purpose of developing the Wainuiomata Valley through the acquisition of 1,600 hectares (4,000 acres) of land, its subdivision and its sale as residential lots. An important part of the project involved the construction of the Wainuiomata Tunnel linking the Hutt Valley and Wainuiomata Valley for improving access to the new settlement. Construction of the tunnel commenced in 1932, but the Depression bought a halt to construction, with many investors in the company losing money. The tunnel was never completed.

After World War II ended in 1945, major growth occurred due to affordable housing developments attracting many young couples, which transformed Wainuiomata into a working-class community. This influx of young families earned the community the nickname of &quot;Nappy Valley&quot; in the 1950s.

New Zealand&#x27;s first kōhanga reo opened in Wainuiomata in 1982.

Gary McCormick&#x27;s 1994 documentary series &quot;Heartland&quot; featured an episode about Wainuiomata. The programme angered many local people because it focussed on negative aspects and ignored many positive things going on in the valley. One resident featured on the programme was Chloe Reeves, who for a time became known as &#x27;Chloe of Wainuiomata&#x27;.

In April 2009 a Palmerston North hotelier banned all Wainuiomata residents after a series of misdemeanours by visitors from there.

The first series of the television production &quot;Seven Periods with Mr Gormsby&quot; was shot in the old Wainuiomata College with many local residents as cast members.

In 2022, a study commissioned by Wellington Regional Council and conducted by Jim Lynch, the founder of Zealandia, found that establishing a wildlife sanctuary in the Wainuiomata Water Collection Area was &quot;technically and practically feasible&quot;. The name given to the proposed sanctuary is Puketahā.

==Geography==
Wainuiomata is situated in a basin surrounded by hills. The topography reduces local wind-flow, resulting in lower minimum temperatures in winter and higher maximum temperatures in summer than in most other parts of Wellington and the Hutt Valley. The valley floor is 86 m above sea level, and the highest point of the Wainuiomata Hill Road is 195 m above sea level. 

Wainuiomata River flows through the southern part of Wainuiomata, draining to the sea at Baring Head to the south. Two major tributaries join Wainuiomata River in the Homedale area: Wainuiomata Stream from Moore&#x27;s Valley, and Black Creek, from north Wainuiomata. Water is piped from Wainuiomata to supply Wellington City with fresh water.

The Orongorongo Valley, accessed via the Wainuiomata Valley, features bush walks and native-forest scenery.

==Government==
Since the 1989 New Zealand local government reforms, Wainuiomata (together with Petone, Eastbourne and Lower Hutt) has been governed by Hutt City Council. The Wainuiomata ward covers the suburb and the surrounding rural area, electing one councillor to the Hutt City Council. Since the 2019 local elections, the ward has been represented by Keri Brown.

At the national level, Wainuiomata falls in the Hutt South general electorate and the Ikaroa-Rāwhiti Māori electorate. Since 2023, Lower Hutt resident and National Party MP Chris Bishop represents Hutt South.

==Economy==
Wainuiomata has traditionally been a dormitory suburb: most residents work outside the valley. Several factories that operated in Wainuiomata during the second half of the twentieth century closed down in the late 1980s and 1990s after changes in government regulation of imported goods. Wainuiomata entered a long period of economic stagnation and population decline, but since around 2020 the suburb has seen new development, including a revamped town centre, a new retirement village and a building boom as new areas are opened up for housing and older bungalows are demolished to make way for medium density townhouses.

===Wainuiomata Mall===

Wainuiomata Mall was established in 1970. After struggling for several years the mall was demolished in 2020, to be made into a smaller shopping centre with a new Countdown supermarket.

===Brugger Industries===
Frank Brugger began business in Petone and his company Brugger Industries established a factory in Wainuiomata in 1970, employing hundreds of local people. The company made car seats and other components for the domestic car assembly industry, and also manufactured a highly-efficient pyroclastic stove. Brugger retired in 1986 and the factory changed ownership, before closing in 1998.

=== Bata Shoe Company ===
Bata opened a factory in Wainuiomata in 1967, producing gumboots, sandals and Bata bullets (a popular canvas sneaker). The company faced challenges in the 1980s after the government changed its regulation of imported footwear, and the Wainuiomata factory closed in 1992.

=== Tatra Leather Goods ===
Tatra, founded by Frederick Turnovsky, produced leather accessories such as belts and wallets at a factory in Wainuiomata which operated between the 1960s and 1980s. By 1976, the factory had 200 workers and was said to be the largest employer in Wainuiomata. Tatra went into receivership in 1988, after a downturn in business due to competition from cheap imported leather goods.

=== Feltex Carpets ===
Feltex opened a textile mill in Wainuiomata in 1974. The factory was bought by Alliance Textiles in December 1996 and closed shortly after, with the loss of about 70 jobs. The building later housed a church, and in 2013 Big Save Furniture set up a distribution centre in the former factory.

=== Tom &amp; Luke ===
Tom &amp; Luke is a snack food manufacturer based in Wainuiomata that sells its products in New Zealand and exports to Australia, Asia and the United States. It was founded by Tom Dorman and Luke Cooper in 2013. The company employs around 45 people, mostly locals. In 2022 Tom &amp; Luke won the Wellington School of Business and Government Judge’s Choice Award at the ExportNZ ASB Wellington Export Awards.

== Culture ==

=== Venues ===
Wainuiomata has a marae, officially opened in 1988, and various churches. The Coast Road Church was built in 1866 and in use until 1958. It is listed by Heritage New Zealand as a Category 2 historic place, and can be hired for weddings or other functions.

=== Arts ===
Wainuiomata hosts the annual Wellington Folk Festival over Labour Weekend in October. The community theatre society is called Wainuiomata Little Theatre and has been operating since 1956. Bruce Mason was the patron when it started.
== Recreation and sport ==
Wainuiomata has a large outdoor swimming pool complex. It was completely funded by the community, through raffles, fundraising and an annual Christmas parade, and opened in 1967. The main pool was extended to Olympic length in the early 1970s, and after more community fundraising, an 80 metre hydroslide was added in 1984.

Wainuiomata Regional Park adjoins Remutaka Forest Park, a protected forest park south of Wainuiomata. The park contains swimming spots, walking and cycling trails, as well as access to a disused dam which used to be part of the system supplying Wainuiomata and Wellington City with water. The Wainuiomata Water Collection Area is a restricted-access water catchment reserve to the south-east of the suburb.

Wainuiomata has a popular mountain biking venue at Waiu Park in the hills in the north-west of the suburb. The Wainuiomata Trail Park was developed as a joint initiative by a volunteer group and the Hutt City Council. The park allows for mixed use by runners, walkers and mountain bikers. As of 2024, it includes 57 trails of varying difficulty with a total trail length of .

There is a golf course on the Coast Road to the south of Wainuiomata, opened at its current location in 1970.

Wainuiomata has clubs for rugby union, rugby league and football. Rugby league was particularly prominent in the 1980s and 1990s, with the Wainuiomata Lions team winning a national title three times, but its popularity has waned since then. 

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transport ===
The Wainuiomata Hill Road is the only road into and out of Wainuiomata, connecting the suburb with Gracefield and Waiwhetu. Four lanes wide (two in each direction), it is one of the steepest roads in the Wellington region; on the Lower Hutt side, the road climbs 195 metres in 1.9 km, resulting in an average grade of 10.3%.

In 2019 a four-metre wide shared walking and cycling path over the Wainuiomata Hill Road was completed. The path, called Te Hikoi Arawera (&#x27;Pathway to the horizon&#x27;) cost $12.9 million and was funded by Hutt City Council and the New Zealand Transport Agency. On the Wainuiomata side, the path goes up the valley side of the road. At the top of the hill the Pukeatua pedestrian bridge, completed in 2015, crosses over the road and then the path continues down the harbour side of the road to Gracefield. The path also links to mountain bike trails in the surrounding hills.

Two regular bus routes serve Wainuiomata: 160 &quot;Wainuiomata North&quot; and 170 &quot;Wainuiomata South&quot;. Both bus routes travel to Lower Hutt Queensgate via Waterloo Interchange, where they connect with Hutt Valley Line train services to Wellington. Route 160 serves the northern neighbourhoods of Parkway, Arakura and Glendale, while route 170 serves the southern neighbourhoods of Fernlea and Homedale; both routes serve the shopping centre. Previously, two peak-hour services, 80N and 80S, followed routes 160 and 170 within Wainuiomata respectively, but travelled via Gracefield and Petone express to central Wellington however these were cancelled in 2022 and there are currently no direct bus services between Wainuiomata and Wellington City.

A branch commuter railway line (see Wainuiomata railway proposals) was proposed at times in the 20th century, but never proceeded. In 2021 a Christchurch-based property development company erroneously advertised new townhouses in Wainuiomata as: &quot;In close proximity to Wainuiomata Train Station with trains departing to Lower Hutt and Wellington regularly makes for an effortless daily commute&quot;.

For many years, debates have centred on whether or not a second access road into Wainuiomata should be built. It would connect north Wainuiomata to Naenae and would be valuable if the Wainuiomata Hill Road was unusable for any reason, as well as providing impetus for new housing on the flat land around upper Fitzherbert Road.

=== Shopping precinct ===
Queen Street is Wainuiomata&#x27;s main shopping area, and there is also a public library and community centre with a large hall. The Queen Street area was revamped in 2022–2023 in the &#x27;Wainuiomata Town Centre&#x27; project, which involved landscaping around the community centre. A new road has also been constructed to provide access to a new supermarket which was built after the mall was demolished. 

=== Fire brigade ===
Wainuiomata has a volunteer fire brigade, established in 1944 following a major house-fire in 1943. The siren blasts twice in an emergency and can be heard clearly throughout the valley. The first superintendent was Mr J.S. Dunn. The first station was built in 1945 on land opposite Wainuiomata Primary School. The Wainuiomata Development Company donated land and timber to the brigade, with other brigades and companies donating hose, standpipes and ladders. The Stokes Valley brigade supplied a Gwynne Trailer pump.

In the early days any available vehicle would tow the pump and trailer to calls. Often this was a 30-seater bus, as one of the foundation members, Mr Artie Kilmister, was the local bus driver. In 1946 the brigade took delivery of its first &quot;real&quot; fire engine, a Ford V8 Marmon-Herrington 4-wheel-drive. This truck, an ex Air Force tender, remained in service until 1965. It had no flashing lights, only a siren, and on occasions this failed: it was not unusual for members to yell from the truck &quot;get out of the way&quot;, or words to that effect.

The Wainuiomata Volunteer Fire Brigade joined the United Fire Brigades Association of New Zealand (UFBA) in 1944.

==Education==
Between 2001 and 2005, six Wainuiomata schools closed due to falling rolls. Between 2008 and 2021 the population increased but there was a further drop of 818 students enrolled at Wainuiomata schools, with many parents choosing to send their children to schools outside the valley. In 2021, only 50% of local secondary students attended Wainuiomata schools, with the remainder educated outside the valley.

As of 2024, Wainuiomata has eight schools: six primary schools, an intermediate school and a secondary school.

=== Kōhanga reo ===
The first kōhanga reo or language nest in New Zealand opened in Wainuiomata in April 1982 at Pukeatua Kōhanga Reo. It was a pilot programme in response to less than 5% of Māori schoolchildren speaking te reo Māori (the Māori language) fluently. Kōhanga reo is immersion early childhood education taught by fluent speakers. By 1994, not only had kura kaupapa (Māori-immersion primary and secondary schools) also been set up but there were there were 800 kōhanga reo nationwide. Iritana Te Rangi Tāwhiwhirangi and Wainuiomata resident Jean Puketapu started Pukeatua Kōhanga Reo together. The kōhanga reo model has been taken up by other communities around the world. By the 40th anniversary in 2022 Pukeatua Kōhanga Reo had moved to a bigger premises and was led by Kuini Garthwaite (Ngāti Porou).
