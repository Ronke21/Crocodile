<text>Korma or qorma (; ; ; ; ) is a dish with its origin in the Indian subcontinent, consisting of meat or vegetables braised with yogurt, water or stock, and spices to produce a thick sauce or gravy.

==Etymology==
The English name is an anglicisation of the Hindi-Urdu &quot;qormā&quot; (क़ोरमा, قورمہ), meaning &quot;braise&quot;. It refers to the cooking technique used in the dish. All these words, and the names of dishes such as the Iranian ghormeh (), Turkish Kavurma and the Azerbaijani qovurma or &quot;kavarma&quot;, are ultimately derived from a Turkic word &quot;qawirma&quot;, meaning &quot;[a] fried thing&quot;. The Indian korma is, however, possibly unrelated in a culinary sense to the modern Turkish kavurma or to some other dishes using the same root word, as they use widely varying techniques and ingredients.

==History==

Korma has its roots in the Mughlai cuisine of the Indian subcontinent. A characteristic Mughal dish, it can be traced back to the 16th century and to the Mughal expansion into South Asia. Kormas were often prepared in the Mughal court kitchens, such as the famous white korma, perhaps garnished with &quot;vark&quot;, was said to have been served to Shah Jahan and his guests at the inauguration of the Taj Mahal.

Classically, a korma is defined as a dish where meat or vegetables are braised with yogurt or stock. The technique covers many different styles of korma. The flavour of a korma is based on the mixture of spices, including ground coriander and cumin, combined with yogurt kept below curdling temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, this would have been carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with charcoal on the lid to provide all-round heat. A korma can be mildly spiced or fiery and may use lamb, goat meat, chicken, beef or game; some kormas combine meat and vegetables, such as spinach and turnip. The term &quot;shahi&quot; (), used for some kormas, indicates its status as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court.

==Preparation==
The korma style is similar to other braising techniques in that the meat or vegetable is first cooked briskly, or seared, using high heat, traditionally with ghee, and then subjected to long, slow cooking using moist heat and a minimum of added liquid. The pot may be sealed with dough during the last stages of cooking, using a technique called &quot;dum&quot; or &quot;dampokhtak&quot;.

The korma is made using a technique called &quot;bagar&quot;. in the later stage of cooking, additional spices are mixed with heated ghee and then combined with the sauce formed by the braising. The pan is then covered and shaken to release steam and mix the contents.

There is a wide variation between individual korma and other &quot;curry&quot; recipes. Chilli and ginger are often used, but the precise method of preparation results in widely different flavors. Indian bay leaves or dried coconut may be added, the latter being a predominantly South Indian flavoring.

A korma &quot;pilau&quot; (pilaf) is a rice and meat dish made with braised meat.

==Variations==

===In the United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, a typical korma as served in curry houses is a mildly spiced dish with a thick sauce. It often features almonds, cashews or other nuts, and coconut or coconut milk. In the 21st century, chicken korma has several times been cited as the most popular curry in the UK, replacing chicken tikka masala in surveys of public eating habits.

===Navratan korma===

Navratan korma is a vegetarian korma made with vegetables and either paneer (an Indian cheese) or nuts – or sometimes both. &quot;Navratan&quot; means &quot;nine gems&quot;, and it is common for the recipe to include nine different vegetables.

=== Eid korma ===
In some parts of South Asia, &quot;korma&quot; is used to denote a traditional Eid al-Adha (festival of the sacrifice) dish of lamb, goat, or cow that is braised in minimal or no spices. The flavour comes from the meat and fat of the chosen cuts. It was often done to preserve meats for a short-term period, as the fat layer forms a barrier to help prevent spoilage, similar to potted beef.

=== In Malaysia ===
In Malaysia, korma or &#x27;gulai kurma&#x27; is traditionally cooked with coconut milk instead of yoghurt among the Malays, as dairy products do not feature heavily in Malay cuisine. Meats used for kurma include chicken, mutton, beef, and deer. It also often contains more vegetables, such as carrots, potatoes, and tomatoes, though this is not a hard-and-fast rule. Some recipes include tamarind as the souring agent, in place of the natural acidity of yoghurt.

<text>The Mexican Empire (, ) was a constitutional monarchy and the first independent government of Mexico. It was also the only former viceroyalty of the Spanish Empire to establish a monarchy after gaining independence. The empire existed from 1821 to 1823, making it one of the few modern-era independent monarchies in the Americas. To distinguish it from the later Second Mexican Empire (1864–1867) under Emperor Maximilian, this historical period is commonly referred to as the First Mexican Empire. The empire was led by former Royal Spanish military officer Agustín de Iturbide, who ruled as Agustín I.

The establishment of a monarchy was the initial goal for an independent Mexico, as outlined in the Plan of Iguala, a political document drafted by Iturbide that unified the forces fighting for independence from Spain. Following the signing of the Treaty of Córdoba by the last Spanish viceroy in September 1821, the plan for a Mexican monarchy advanced. Iturbide&#x27;s popularity reached its peak on May 18, 1822, when public demonstrations called for him to become emperor in the absence of a European royal willing to assume the throne. The Mexican Congress approved the proposal, and Iturbide was crowned in July 1822. 

The empire&#x27;s brief existence was marked by challenges, including disputes over its legitimacy, conflicts between the Congress and the emperor, and a bankrupt national treasury. In October 1822, Iturbide dissolved Congress and replaced it with the National Institutional Junta, composed of his supporters. However, by December of the same year, he began to lose the support of the Mexican Army, which rebelled in favor of restoring the Congress and its democratic powers. Unable to suppress the revolt, Iturbide reconvened the Congress in March 1823 and offered his abdication. Power was then transferred to a republican provisional government of 1823-1824, which abolished the monarchy and established the First Mexican Republic.

==Background==
The Spanish Empire disintegrated in the wake of Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Spain and the overthrow of the Spanish Bourbons in 1808. Throughout Spain and its viceroyalties there was a widespread refusal to recognize Napoleon&#x27;s brother Joseph I as the new French-backed king of Spain. In New Spain cleric Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, who had long been part of a circle of intellectuals who sought to reform the colonial system, triggered the Mexican War of Independence in 1810, a decade of warfare between insurgents for independence from Spain and royalists seeking to maintain the existing colonial order. The insurgency was initially led by Hidalgo, who was captured and executed in 1811, then succeeded by Father José María Morelos, who was likewise captured and executed in 1815. Remaining insurgents, including Vicente Guerrero, waged guerrilla warfare in the countryside of southern Mexico. Agustín de Iturbide was a Mexican officer in the Spanish army, a member of the Mexican elite loyal to Spain. When Liberals in Spain seized power in 1820, re-established the Spanish Constitution of 1812, forcing limits on the power of Ferdinand VII of Spain and curtailing privileges of established elites and institutions, Mexican elites saw their interests threatened. In view of this, Iturbide sought an alliance with Mexican insurgents, drawing up the Plan of Iguala and gaining the support of insurgent leader Vicente Guerrero and others. They created the Army of the Three Guarantees, which brought about Mexican independence from Spain in September 1821. 

The newly constituted movement involved three principles, or &quot;guarantees&quot;: that Mexico would be an independent constitutional monarchy governed by a Spanish prince; that &quot;Americanos&quot;, that is all Mexicans regardless of ethnic category and those born in Spain would henceforth enjoy equal rights and privileges; and that the Roman Catholic Church would retain its privileges and position as the official and exclusive religion of the land. These Three Guarantees formed the core of the Plan of Iguala, the blueprint which, by combining the goal of independence and a constitution with the preservation of Catholic monarchy and Roman Catholicism, brought together all Mexican factions. Under the 24 February 1821 Plan of Iguala, to which most of the provinces subscribed, the Mexican Congress established a regency council which was headed by Iturbide.

Viceroy Juan O&#x27;Donojú acceded to the Mexican insurgents&#x27; demands, having no other option because he lacked independent resources. He signed the Treaty of Córdoba on 24 August 1821. The Mexican Congress intended to establish a personal union, whereby Ferdinand VII of Spain would also be king of Mexico, but both countries would be governed by separate laws and through separate legislative bodies. If the Spanish king refused the position, the plan provided for another member of the House of Bourbon to accede to the Mexican throne. Commissioners from Mexico were sent to Spain to offer the Mexican throne to a Spanish royal, but the Spanish state refused to recognize Mexico&#x27;s independence and would not allow any other Spanish prince to accept the throne.

==Election of the Emperor==
With Ferdinand VII having rejected the Treaty of Cordoba, Iturbide&#x27;s supporters saw an opportunity to place their candidate on the throne. On the night of 18 May, the 1st infantry regiment, stationed at the ex Convent of San Hipólito, and led by sergeant Pio Marcha began a public demonstration in favor of Iturbide being made emperor. The demonstration was joined by other barracks and many civilians as well. When the public demonstration reached his home, Iturbide himself was able to address the demonstrators from his balcony. He consulted with members of the regency on what course to follow, and eventually acquiesced to the demonstrators&#x27; demands, agreeing that he should be made emperor. The crowd celebrated the rest of the night with fireworks and celebratory gunfire.

An extraordinary session of congress was held the following morning to deal with the subject of Iturbide&#x27;s coronation. At the opening of the session, the military addressed a manifesto to congress, endorsing Iturbide to be emperor. The deliberations then started with a few deputies expressing concern that congress was not entirely free in the present circumstances to proceed on the matter. A pro-Iturbide crowd outside of the hall was making so much noise that it was interfering with the deliberations, and congress asked Iturbide to show up in an unsuccessful attempt to calm the crowds. The opposition brought up concerns that a popular demonstration in the capital was not enough of a basis upon which to elect Iturbide and that the provinces ought to be consulted first. A proposal was made to gain the consent of two thirds of the provinces, and this succeeding then to appoint a commission to write a provisional constitution in order to avoid constitutional crises.

Deputy Valentín Gómez Farías, future president of Mexico, stood up for the legality of congress to elect an emperor. He praised Iturbide&#x27;s services to the nation, and argued that as Spain had rejected the Treaty of Córdoba, Congress was now authorized by that very treaty to hold an election to decide who the emperor was to be.
The vote then proceeded. In the final results, sixty-seven deputies voted in favor of making Iturbide Emperor, while fifteen voted against. The vote however was short of a legal quorum of one hundred and two deputies. Congress, nonetheless resigned itself to the situation, and a plan to establish a constitutional monarchy united both conservatives and liberals at a time when it was uncertain which form of government would be best for independent Mexico.

==Coronation==
Congress published an oath binding the emperor to obey the constitution, which Iturbide subsequently took, and Congress also declared the Mexican monarchy to be hereditary, granting titles of nobility to Iturbide&#x27;s family. His son and heir became Prince Imperial of Mexico. The 19th of May was made a national holiday, and a royal household was organized. 21 July 1822 was set as the date of the official coronation.

Iturbide&#x27;s court was being set up to be more luxurious than that of the former Spanish Viceroy, a situation which provoked opposition in a new nation that was essentially bankrupt. To remedy the financial difficulties, the Mexican government prohibited the exportation of money, and exacted a forced loan of 600,000 pesos in Mexico City, Puebla, Guadalajara, and Veracruz. During this time, a council of state was also formed, being made up of thirteen members selected by the Emperor from a list of thirty one nominees submitted by congress.

The coronation took place on 21 July. The capital was decked out in floral arrangements, banners, streamers, and flags. The government could not afford to forge a crown, and therefore jewels and gems had to be borrowed, but ultimately a signet ring, a scepter and crowns were produced. Costumes were made based on drawings of Napoleon&#x27;s coronation. Congress met on the morning of the coronation, and then divided itself into two deputations to escort the emperor and the empress to the National Cathedral. In the cathedral, the emperor and the empress were to be seated on thrones next to the newly ennobled Mexican princes and princesses. Upon reaching the cathedral, the emperor and empress were escorted to their thrones, and the imperial regalia were placed on the altar. The regalia were blessed and Iturbide was crowned by the president of the congress.

==Reign==

Congress and the Emperor immediately began to clash, in large part because their respective legal powers had not at this point been clearly delineated. By mid 1822 the three major issues were whether Iturbide had a right to appoint members to a Supreme Court, whether he had the right to veto legislation as the Spanish King had under the Spanish Constitution of 1812, and his wish to establish rural military tribunals. The latter measure was in response to the lapse in law and order that was spreading throughout the country. Iturbide wished to establish in provincial capitals special courts made up of two military officers assisted by a lawyer. They were to keep track of seditious plots, but also in cases of murder, robbery or injury, and with the permission of the district captain general, the courts would be allowed to disregard statutes that would interfere with quickly carrying out judicial processes. Congress however, was opposed to the project. All the while, work on a constitution for the Empire was being neglected. Iturbide&#x27;s greatest enemy in congress was deputy Servando Teresa de Mier, a staunch republican, who would often ridicule the Emperor and his pageantry.
===Arrest of the Deputies===
In August 1822, a conspiracy to overthrow the Emperor was discovered. The conspirators, claiming that Iturbide&#x27;s election was illegal, plotted to rise up in the capital, move the congress to Texcoco and declare the establishment of a Republic. On 26 and 27 August, fifteen deputies suspected of being involved with the plot, including Mier, Carlos Maria Bustamante, Francisco Tagle, Jose del Valle, and José Joaquín de Herrera were arrested. Congress was shocked by the arrests, which had included some of its most prominent deputies, and on the morning of 27 August, the legislature sent a letter to the military upholding the immunity of congress, and accusing the arresting authorities of acting in an extra-legal fashion. Secretary of Interior Relations, Andrés Quintana Roo replied that by virtue of the Spanish Constitution of 1812, the government had the authority to arrest deputies suspected of being involved in a treasonous conspiracy, and that congress would remain informed on the results of the ongoing investigation. Congress preferred to try the suspected deputies itself, but the matter was rejected. The prosecution against the accused did not get very far and a few were liberated around Christmas, 1822. One of the arrested, Jose del Valle would actually go on to be appointed foreign minister by Iturbide a few months later. 
===Dissolution of Congress===
Afterwards followed controversies over reconstituting Congress. The convocation that had established congress had also directed it to divide itself into two chambers, which had not been done. The body remained united on the pretext of drafting a new constitution and it considered itself a sovereign constitutional congress. It did not view itself bound in any way by the 1812 Spanish Constitution which remained the de facto constitution of Mexico. At this point no consistent relationship had been established between population and the number of deputies, and the congress as it stood was starting to become a burdensome expense. Deputy Lorenzo de Zavala brought up these concerns and proposed to reduce the number of deputies and also to divide the body into two chambers, a proposal which the emperor found very agreeable. On October 16, Iturbide gathered several deputies and generals at his home, and began to discuss the measure of dissolving congress under the pretext that it did not as it stood, proportionally represent the provinces. 

The following day, members of the council of state, the generals based in Mexico City, and more than forty deputies gathered at Iturbide&#x27;s home for a conference regarding the problems with congress. He addressed them and accused congress of not having taken a single step in eight months towards writing a constitution, of not passing a single law regarding finances or the military, and of rather focusing their time on attacking the emperor. Various deputies added to the discussion, and brought forth the point that if congress needed to be reformed, the proposal ought to come from congress itself. The ultimate result of this conference was a proposal to reduce congress to seventy deputies. On October 17, 1822, the latter proposal was presented to congress. Congress rejected the measure, but a compromise was reached by which the legislature agreed to abide by the Spanish Constitution of 1812 as a provisional constitution, allowing Iturbide a veto over legislation, and the right to select members of the supreme court. 

Iturbide however then sought for more concessions, arguing that his veto ought to extend to any article of any new constitution that congress would draft, and also continued to insist on reducing the number of deputies in congress. These grabs for power alienated even conservatives, and Iturbide&#x27;s proposals were rejected, which Iturbide then responded to by dissolving congress on 31 October 1822. Brigadier Luis Cortazar was placed in charge of dissolving the congress, and the deputies dispersed without protest or violence. Iturbide&#x27;s pretext was that congress had accomplished nothing in the eight months it had been in session, work on a constitution had not begun despite that being the main purpose for its convocation, and that the matters of justice and finance had been completely neglected.

===Financial Problems===
To replace congress, Iturbide established a National Institutional Junta made up of forty five members, chosen from among friendly deputies. The junta was installed officially on 2 November 1822, and vested with the legislative power, until a new congress could be formed. Iturbide entrusted the body with writing up regulations for producing a new congress, but also began to focus on the grave financial issues that the Empire was facing. On 5 November 1822, the junta authorized a forced loan of over two million pesos, and the seizure of more than one million pesos waiting for exportation out of the country in the port of Veracruz.

Iturbide also began to issue paper currency, and on 20 December, the government authorized the printing of four million pesos worth of banknotes, in denominations of one, two, and ten. These were issued to all financial offices of the Empire, where they were to be used in a ratio of 1:2 with silver coin in payment of all government of obligations. Anyone who owed money to the government was allowed to make one third of the payment in notes and two thirds in coin.

==Revolt against the Emperor==
The last Spanish stronghold in Mexico, was Fort of San Juan de Ulúa on a small island off the coast of Veracruz. There had been a change in command at the fort during this time, and general Antonio López de Santa Anna, stationed in Veracruz planned a scheme of taking possession of it
by feigning the surrender of Veracruz to its new commander. When Echevarri, the captain-general of the local provinces, arrived in Veracruz, he approved of the plan, and agreed to join in on it, positioning his troops in Veracruz to ambush the landing Spaniards, having been promised support by Santa Anna. On 26 October 1822, as the Spaniards landed however, Santa Anna&#x27;s troops failed to arrive, and Echevarri barely defeated the landing party, and the Spanish ultimately kept control of the fort. Echevarri expressed his suspicion to Iturbide that it had all been a scheme by Santa Anna to get Echeverri killed as revenge for Santa Anna not having been appointed Captain-General himself. Iturbide himself went to Veracruz to dismiss Santa Anna from his command, not overtly however but rather under the pretext of simply moving him to a different post in Mexico City. However, Santa Anna suspecting his ruin, instead took command of his troops and in December, 1822 started a rebellion in favour of a republican form of government.

Vicente Guerrero and Nicolás Bravo, defected from the ranks of the imperialists, and proceeded to Chilapa on 5 January 1823 to join the revolution, but experienced a disastrous defeat at Almolonga. The insurrection was mostly being suppressed at this time, Victoria being held in check at Puente del Rey, and Santa Anna still confined at Veracruz.

Echevarri was sent to take care of the rebellion in Veracruz, with more than three thousand well supplied troops, but ended up defecting. At this point, the opposition to the government began to negotiate with the military. On 1 February 1823 a junta including many military chiefs, and the liberal diplomat Miguel Santa María met in Veracruz to proclaim the Plan of Casa Mata. The army pledged itself to restore Congress while disavowing any intention of harming the person of the Emperor, or of overthrowing the Mexican monarchy. On 14 February, Puebla proclaimed for the plan, followed by San Luis Potosí, and Guadalajara. By March, most of Mexico had proclaimed in favour of the plan. A military junta was formed in Jalapa, to represent the Plan of Casa Mata.

==Iturbide&#x27;s abdication==
On 4 March 1823, Iturbide issued a decree reconvening Congress, and the deputies met on 7 March. Iturbide addressed the session, hoping to reach a negotiation and avoid conflict, but the deputies listened coldly. The military junta refused to recognize the Congress until its liberty was guaranteed. On 19 March, Iturbide fearing his imminent overthrowal, summoned congress to an extraordinary session and presented his abdication. Congress proposed that the military junta meet with Iturbide about the matter, but the junta refused, instead proposing that Iturbide remove himself from the capital, and await the decision of Congress. On 26 March, an agreement was reached by which the junta would recognize Iturbide on whatever terms Congress would grant him. Iturbide also agreed to remove himself from the capital, and the command of the capital was handed over to the revolutionary troops and power passed over to the Provisional Government of Mexico.

==Territory==
The territory of the Mexican Empire corresponded to the borders of Viceroyalty of New Spain, excluding the Captaincies General of Cuba, Santo Domingo and the Philippines. The Central American lands of the former Captaincy General of Guatemala were annexed to the Empire shortly after its establishment.

Under the First Empire, Mexico reached its greatest territorial extent, stretching from northern California to the provinces of Central America (excluding Panama, which was then part of Colombia), which had not initially approved becoming part of the Mexican Empire but joined the Empire shortly after their independence.

After the emperor abdicated, on March 29 the departing Mexican general Vicente Filísola called for a new Central American Congress to convene and on July 1, 1823 the Central American provinces formed the Federal Republic of Central America, with only the province of Chiapas choosing to remain a part of Mexico as a state. Subsequent territorial evolution of Mexico over the next several decades (principally cessions to the United States) would eventually reduce Mexico to less than half its maximum extent.

===Political subdivisions===
The First Mexican empire was divided into the following intendances:

* Las Californias
* México
* Nuevo México
* Texas
* Nueva Vizcaya
* Coahuila
* Nuevo Reino de León
* Nuevo Santander
* Estado de Occidente
* Zacatecas
* San Luis de Potosí
* Guanajuato
* Querétaro
* Puebla
* Guadalajara
* Oaxaca
* Mérida de Yucatán
* Valladolid
* Veracruz
* Guatemala
* Honduras
* El Salvador

<text>The Second Mexican Empire (; ), officially known as the Mexican Empire (), was a constitutional monarchy established in Mexico by Mexican monarchists with the support of the Second French Empire. This period is often referred to as the Second French intervention in Mexico. French Emperor Napoleon III, with backing from Mexican conservatives, the clergy, and nobility, aimed to establish a monarchist ally in the Americas as a counterbalance to the growing power of the United States.

The throne of Mexico was offered by Mexican monarchists, who had lost a civil war against Mexican liberals, to Austrian Archduke Maximilian of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, who had ancestral ties to the rulers of colonial Mexico. Maximilian&#x27;s ascension was ratified through a controversial referendum. His wife, Belgian princess Charlotte of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, became the empress consort of Mexico, known locally as &quot;Carlota.&quot;

While the French army secured control over central Mexico, supporters of the Mexican Republic continued to resist the Empire through conventional military means and guerrilla warfare. Despite being forced to abandon Mexico City, President Benito Juárez never left Mexican territory, even as he relocated his government multiple times to evade Imperial forces.

Maximilian&#x27;s regime received recognition from European powers such as Great Britain and Austria, as well as from Brazil and China, but it was not recognized by the United States. At the time, the U.S. was engaged in its Civil War (1861–65) and did not formally oppose the Empire during the conflict. However, following the Union&#x27;s victory over the Confederacy, the U.S. recognized the Republican government and exerted diplomatic pressure on France to withdraw its support. The U.S. did not provide material aid to the Republicans.

With the conclusion of the U.S. Civil War in 1865, the geopolitical situation shifted. Napoleon III began withdrawing French troops from Mexico in 1866, which had been essential to sustaining Maximilian&#x27;s regime, and ceased further financial support. Maximilian, whose liberal policies alienated many of his conservative backers, attracted some moderate liberal support by endorsing much of the Liberal Reform legislation, though his efforts at further reform were largely unsuccessful.

Despite the increasingly dire military situation, Maximilian refused to abdicate and remained in Mexico after the French troops departed. He was eventually captured by Republican forces in Querétaro, along with his generals Tomás Mejía and Miguel Miramón. The Second Mexican Empire formally ended on 19 June 1867, when Maximilian and his generals were executed by firing squad. The Mexican Republic was restored, having maintained its existence throughout the French intervention and the monarchist regime.

==History==

Post-independence Mexico was briefly a monarchy, lasting just over a year, when the emperor abdicated and went into exile, and a federated republic was established in 1824. The idea of monarchy persisted and in 1861, Mexican conservatives and emperor Napoleon III of France brokered a deal to create a new monarchy in Mexico, with Archduke Maximilian agreeing to become emperor, with the military and financial backing of France. The French army ousted Mexican President Benito Juárez from the capital and Maximilian and his wife Carlota arrived in Mexico in 1864. The regime lasted so long as French troops and money supported it, but rapidly fell once Napoleon III withdrew that aid.

===Mexican monarchism===

After a decade of warfare (1810–21) Mexico gained its independence under the leadership of American-born, royalist military commander turned insurgent Agustín de Iturbide, who united insurgents and Spaniards under the Plan of Iguala. The Plan promised independence for Mexico as a monarchy (First Mexican Empire), and also invited a member of Spanish royalty to assume the newly established Mexican throne. After the offer was refused by the Spanish royals, congress searched for an emperor within the newly independent country. After an armed demonstration by Iturbide&#x27;s regiment of the Army of the Three Guarantees, the Mexican congress elected the Mexican-born military officer and leader of independence as the first Mexican emperor. Although during the independence struggle, Mexicans considered the idea of republicanism, &quot;monarchy was the default position.&quot; Iturbide rule as emperor lasted less than two years, but the height of his power lasted only six months. in his attempts to govern, Iturbide struggled to find funds to pay the army and the rest of the government, and closed congress, accusing representatives of obstructionism and idleness, eventually leading to a military uprising against Iturbide and his subsequent abdication. The idea of a monarchy had been discredited for a time, but the idea did not disappear, as many of the disorders associated with the First Empire continued well into the Republican era.

French observers began expressing interest in the idea of a Mexican monarchy as early as 1830. Lorenzo de Zavala claimed that in that year, he was approached by a foreign agent hoping to recruit him in a plan to place an Orléans monarch upon a Mexican throne. In 1840 José María Gutiérrez Estrada wrote a monarchist essay endorsing the idea of a legitimate European monarch being invited to govern Mexico. The pamphlet was addressed to the conservative president Bustamante, who rejected the idea. French diplomats tended to sympathize with the Conservatives in Mexico, Victor de Broglie opining that monarchy was a form of government more suited to Mexico at the time and François Guizot giving a positive review of Estrada&#x27;s pamphlet. 
A monarchist faction in 1846 promoted the idea of establishing a foreign prince at the head of the Mexican government, and president Paredes was viewed as being sympathetic to monarchism,
but the project was not pursued due to the more pressing matter of the American invasion of Mexico. The candidate being proposed at the time was the Spanish prince,
Don Enrique.
The last official Mexican effort to explore the possibility of establishing a monarchy occurred under the presidency of Santa Anna in the early 1850s, when conservative minister Lucas Alamán directed monarchist diplomats José María Gutiérrez de Estrada and Jose Manuel Hidalgo to seek a European candidate for the Mexican throne. With the overthrow of Santa Anna&#x27;s government in 1855, these efforts lost their official support and yet Estrada and Hidalgo continued their efforts independently.

===French invasion and establishment of monarchy===
The international situation shifted making a French invasion and establishment of a monarchy in Mexico a real possibility. Conservative Mexican politicians Estrada and Hidalgo managed to get the attention of French emperor Napoleon III, who came to support the idea of reviving the Mexican monarchy and re-establishing a French imperial presence in the Americas. Prior to 1861 any interference in the affairs of Mexico by European powers would have been viewed in the U.S. as a challenge to the Monroe Doctrine. In 1861 however, the U.S. was embroiled in its own conflict, the American Civil War, which made the U.S. government powerless to intervene directly, but it never condoned the French invasion or the regime it established. In July, Mexican President Benito Juárez declared a two-year moratorium on repayment of Mexican debt to France and other nations, much of it loans contracted by the defeated rival conservative government. Napoleon finally had a pretext for armed intervention. Encouraged by his Spanish-born wife, Empress Eugenie, who saw herself as the champion of the Catholic Church in Mexico, Napoleon III took advantage of the situation. Napoleon III saw the opportunity to make France the great modernizing influence in the Western Hemisphere, as well as enabling the country to capture the South American markets. To give him further encouragement, his half-brother, the duc de Morny, was the largest holder of Mexican bonds on which President Juárez had suspended payment.

French troops landed in December 1861, and began military operations in April 1862. They were eventually joined by conservative Mexican generals who had never been entirely defeated in the War of Reform. Charles de Lorencez&#x27;s small expeditionary force was repulsed at the Battle of Puebla on 5 May 1862, delaying the French push to capture the capital. Reinforcements were sent and placed under the command of Élie Forey. The capital was not taken until a year later in June 1863 and the French now sought to establish a Mexican regime under its influence. Forey appointed a committee of thirty-five Mexicans, the &quot;Junta Superior&quot;, who then elected three Mexican citizens to serve as the government&#x27;s executive: Juan Nepomuceno Almonte (the natural son of independence leader José María Morelos), José Mariano Salas, and Pelagio Antonio de Labastida. In turn this triumvirate then selected 215 Mexican citizens to form together with the &quot;Junta Superior&quot;, an &quot;Assembly of Notables&quot;.

The Assembly met in July 1863 and resolved to invite Archduke Maximilian to be Emperor of Mexico. The title of the executive triumvirate was formally changed to the Regency of the Mexican Empire. An official delegation left Mexico and arrived in Europe in October. In Europe, Maximilian was continuing negotiations with Napoleon III. He requested a plebiscite to ratify the establishment of the Empire by the Assembly of Notables. The referendum was granted, and the result was affirmative; critics viewed it as illegitimate and suspect due to being conducted by the occupying French authorities. Maximilian also rebuffed French efforts to outright annex the state of Sonora, an act which would later be used in his trial to defend against the Republican government&#x27;s accusation that Maximilian had been a French puppet. Maximilian formally accepted the crown on 10 April 1864, and set sail for Mexico. He arrived in Veracruz on 28 May and reached the capital on 12 June.

Although French troops controlled the center of the country, the port of Veracruz, the capital Mexico City, and other major cities as north as Monterrey and as south as Oaxaca, President Juárez remained in the national territory, moving north toward the border. In the countryside, republican guerrillas waged warfare against the French troops and their Mexican army allies.

===Maximilian&#x27;s reign===
Maximilian and Carlota were crowned at the Cathedral of Mexico City. On his arrival in the summer of 1864 Maximilian declared a political amnesty for all liberals who wished to join the Empire, and his conciliation efforts eventually won over some moderate liberals such as José Fernando Ramírez, José María Lacunza, Manuel Orozco y Berra, and Santiago Vidaurri. His first priorities included reforming his ministries and reforming the Imperial Mexican Army, the latter of which was impeded upon by Bazaine in an effort to consolidate French control of the nation.

Maximilian alienated conservative supporters who had brought him to the throne. In December the pope&#x27;s representative, Papal Nuncio Francesco Meglia, arrived in order to arrange a concordat with the Empire to revise the Reform laws previously passed by the liberal Mexican government. Liberal laws and the Constitution of 1857 nationalized Catholic Church property. Although a Catholic, politically Maximilian was a liberal. The Papal Nuncio&#x27;s demands that the emperor restore the power and privileges of the Catholic Church resulted in Maximilian confirming the liberal reform laws regarding freedom of religion and the nationalization of Church property. In taking this action, the emperor alienated the Catholic hierarchy and many Mexican conservatives, who had backed Maximilian becoming emperor. The confrontation over the role of the Church produced an atmosphere of crisis. In Mexico City, the disorder was considerable and Maximilian feared a revolt by Mexican army generals on whom he had relied. He sent Generals Miguel Miramón and Leonardo Márquez out of the country and disbanded the small Mexican army that had supported the empire. That was because those disagreements with the Catholic Church caused conservatives like Remigio Tovar to conspire against the empire, or that Archbishop Pelagio Antonio de Labastida y Dávalos said these judges on Maximilian&#x27;s supporters:

Maximilian took a number of solo state trips through the nation while Empress Carlota reigned as regent. He went to Querétaro, Guanajuato, and Michoacán, giving public audiences and visiting officials, even celebrating Mexican independence by commemorating the Cry of Dolores in the actual town where it took place.

==== Deteriorating imperial military situation ====
French troops had been able to take considerable Mexican territory from republican forces while the U.S. was embroiled in its civil war, but in April 1865, Union forces defeated the secessionist Confederate States of America after four years of bloody combat. The U.S. government was reluctant to enter a direct conflict with France to enforce the Monroe Doctrine prohibiting European powers in the Americas, but official U.S. government sympathy remained with Mexican president Benito Juárez. The U.S. government had refused to recognize the Empire and also ignored Maximilian&#x27;s correspondence. In December 1865, a $30 million private American loan was approved for Juárez, indicating a confidence that he would return to power, and American volunteers joined the Mexican republican troops. An unofficial American raid occurred near Brownsville, and Juárez&#x27;s minister to the United States, Matías Romero, proposed that General Grant or General Sherman intervene in Mexico to help the republican cause. The United States refrained from direct military intervention, but it put diplomatic pressure on France to leave Mexico. 
A concentration of French troops in the northern republican strongholds of Mexico led to a surge of republican guerrilla activity in the south. While French troops controlled major cities, guerrillas continued to be a major military threat in the countryside, which affected Imperial military planning. Troops had to be concentrated and operate in areas where guerrillas could not easily cut them off and eliminate them. In an effort to combat the increasing violence and in a belief that Juárez was outside of the national territory, Maximilian in October signed an order at the urging of the French military commander Bazaine, the so-called &quot;Black Decree.&quot; It mandated the court martial and execution of anyone found either aiding or participating with the guerrillas against the Imperial government. Although the harsh measure was not unprecedented in Mexican history, resembling an 1862 measure by Juárez, it proved to be widely reviled, and contributed to the growing unpopularity of the Empire.

In January 1866, seeing the war as unwinnable, Napoleon III declared to the French Chambers that he intended to withdraw the French military from Mexico. At this point, the U.S. government was no longer preoccupied militarily with winning the Civil War and could enforce the Monroe Doctrine against foreign intervention in the hemisphere. Maximilian&#x27;s request to France for more aid or at least a delay in troop withdrawals was defused nominally because a possible war against Prussia was coming, so despite the sunk costs of the French occupation, abandoning the enterprise was France&#x27;s strategic decision. Empress Carlota arrived in Europe in an attempt to plead for the Empire&#x27;s cause, but she was unable to gain France&#x27;s support.

==== Conservative and traditionalist turn in the government ====
However, by July 1866, there was an increasingly conservative and reactionary turn in the government to avoid the military crisis. This was due to the measures suggested and taken by the political advisors that Emperor Maximilian had, while they noted that the indigenous, and in general the common Mexican, clung to traditionalist New Spanish ways of life, being stubborn in their customs as a traditional society and communitarians form of life that were alien to the Modernization project of the liberal and Individualist-egalitarian model, coming mostly from the Europeanizing Criollo elites, which the indigenous people did not seem willing to follow and showing indifferent or even opposed attitudes to the notions of Equality before the law, while they wanted their inherited differences restored, that was, to have again the legal recognition of their distinction as &quot;Indian&quot; in the fueros of the Indian political society during the Spanish imperial era (in fact, quite a few appeals were made in the government according to the Siete Partidas of Alfonso X of Castile until the &quot;Novísima Recopilación&quot;), especially in terms of communal property and its legal existence as an indigenous community, to subsist and exist as such in contrast to the criollo or the mestizos, and not just a generic recognition as a Mexican/citizen-owner (so in the complaints from several indigenous peoples were referred to Reales Cedulas). This caused the government to become increasingly &quot;counterrevolutionary&quot;, distancing itself more and more from the original ideas of only moderating the consequences of the liberal revolution of the reform war. There was also a constant concern against Criollo landowners who wanted to appropriate the communal lands from the Indians, who wanted the return of institutions from the Ancient Regime such as the Protector of the Indians, rather than being unprotected in equality with the whites. Making the empire distance itself from Mexican Republican Liberalism to the extent that it approached the Protectionist measures demanded by social conservatives, inspired by Derecho Indiano and the Laws of the Indies (and even some positions of the utopian Socialism of the rural proletariat, since Maximilian was influenced by Victor Considerant), instead of longing for the assimilation of the Indian through the political destruction of the indigenous community (as would end up happening in future Mexican governments promoting Peonage) as a means to obtain the desired social transformation by the bourgeois-liberal revolutionaries, who considered that a differentiated category such as &quot;Indian&quot;, understood as a subject of law without the same duties as &quot;whites&quot;, implied a delay in the transition from subjects to citizens in national development. For this reason, laws would be decreed in a nature that were increasingly distant from the liberal ideology, such as the laws of July and September 1865 that reestablished the legal personality of the indigenous communities (abolishing Equality before the law), the agrarian law of 16 September 1866 (the most radical) that granted lands to indigenous communities that lacked legal property and ejido, continuing the law of 26 June on repartimientos (citing the New Spain period) and restoration of community lands (annulling the transition to a regime liberal of Private Property) which said the following: 

Finally, after what were considered serious political errors by his supporters, Maximilian would again propose a new concordat in 1866, this time under the direct influence of Archbishop Pelagio and a council of Mexican bishops, who predicted greater Orthodoxy with Catholic doctrine, repealing rights and reforms influenced by liberalism (condemned by the church), renouncing their Regalist claims of the patronage (after failing a draft agreement from the previous year), and in turn finally returning the church properties. However, it was very late to regain the support from the conservative and traditionalist Mexicans.

Thus, according to Jean Meyer, Maximilian acted, more than as a liberal, as an enlightened Despot (closer to Bourbon Reformism), who would try to take advantage of the elements of Tradition and Modernity, taking extreme measures that contradicted classical and economic Liberalism, drawing on the &quot;old&quot; Indian legislation, or the &quot;modern&quot; proposal of socialism, in addition to the ideas of Cameralism (very popular in the Germanic states) that gave importance to small peasant property compared to the lordly latifundia, expressed in the Urbarium Code of 1767 (which established the plots of the Hungarian peasants and prohibited their lord from seizing them). But this did not imply the end of the confiscations, not giving up the liberal and enlightened desire to overcome feudal communal property by modern private property as a natural and absolute right (in contrast to the traditional conception of it as a secondary natural right), together with the idealized conception of the indigenous in Mexican liberalism as that of a potential owner who would have to be transformed into a citizen and owner of his property, so that would be capable of legally defending its property by itself, like any other criollo or mestizo in the Social Contract. Then, avoiding what happened in modern Mexico that liberals leaves the indigenous outside the law, being a vulnerable subject and without defense mechanisms against the landowners and speculators, seeking to favor the Indian over the landowner through protection mechanisms for the &quot;clases menesterosas&quot; or needy classes (which granted them a protective board on 10 April 1865, to favor the dispossessed classes of the empire) in said social transition.

===Fall of the Empire===

As France withdrew its military, Maximilian&#x27;s empire was headed toward collapse. In October 1866 Maximilian moved his cabinet from the capital to Orizaba, near the Gulf Coast port of Veracruz. He was widely rumored to be leaving Mexico. He contemplated abdication, and on 25 November held a council of his ministers to address the crisis faced by the Empire. They narrowly voted against abdication and Maximilian headed back towards the capital. He intended to appeal to the nation in order to hold a national assembly which would then decide what form of government the Mexican nation was to take. Such a measure however would require a ceasefire from Juárez. The president of the republic would never consider an offer from the foreigner placed on the throne by Juárez&#x27;s Mexican political enemies with the aid of a foreign power. Republican army troops on the ground were fighting to defeat those supporting the emperor.

After the hopeless national assembly project fell through, Maximilian focused on military operations. In February 1867, the last of the occupying French troops departed for France. Maximilian headed for the city of Querétaro, north of the capital, to join the bulk of his Mexican troops, numbering about 10,000 men. Republican generals Escobedo and Corona converged on Querétaro with 40,000 men. The city held out until being betrayed by an imperial officer who opened the gates to the liberals on 15 May 1867.

Maximilian was captured and placed on trial with his leading generals Mejía and Miramón. All three were tried, sentenced to death and executed on 19 June 1867 by the republican army.

==Government==
A provisional statute was published in 1865, which laid the basic framework of the government. The emperor was to govern through nine ministries: of the Imperial Household, of State, of Foreign Relations, of War, of Government or Interior, of the Treasury, of Justice, of Public Instruction and Worship, and of Development. These ministries (except that of the Imperial Household) comprised the Council of Ministers, which discussed the affairs that the emperor referred to them. The emperor had the power to appoint the Minister of the Imperial Household and the Minister of State, and in turn, the Minister of State, which was &quot;ex officio&quot; the President of the Council of Ministers, was to appoint the rest of the Ministers. A Council of State was given the power to frame bills and give advice to the emperor, and a separate private cabinet, serving as the emperor&#x27;s liaison, was divided into civil and military affairs. Empress Carlota was given the right to serve as regent if under certain circumstances Maximilian was to be unavailable, making her the first woman to ever govern Mexico. As a result of her appointment to regency, she is considered to be the first woman to rule in the Americas.

Maximilian had many plans for Mexico, clearly not expecting his reign to be so short. In 1865, the imperial regime drew up plans to reorganize Mexican national territory and issued eight volumes of laws covering all aspects of government, including forest management, railroads, roads, canals, postal services, telegraphs, mining, and immigration.
The emperor passed legislation guaranteeing equality before the law and freedom of speech, and laws meant to defend the rights of laborers, especially indigenous workers. Maximilian attempted to pass a law guaranteeing the natives a living wage and outlawing corporal punishment for them, along with limiting their inheritance of debts. The measures faced backlash from the cabinet, but were ultimately passed during one of Carlota&#x27;s regencies. Labor laws in Yucatán actually became harsher on workers after the fall of the Empire. A national system of free schools was also planned based on the German gymnasia and the emperor founded an Imperial Mexican Academy of Science and Literature.

Maximilian also established the Imperial Order of the Mexican Eagle as an award for extraordinary merits and services to the empire, for outstanding civil or military service, and outstanding achievements in the fields of science and art. It was considered the highest and most exclusive award during the Second Mexican Empire.

Maximilian aimed to promote the development of the country by opening up the nation to immigration, regardless of race. An immigration agency was set up to promote immigration from the United States, the former Confederate States, Europe, and Asia. Colonists were to be granted citizenship at once, and gained exemption from taxes for the first year, and an exemption from military services for five years. Some of the most prominent colonization settlements were the Villa Carlota and the New Virginia Colony.

=== Indigenous Policy ===

The Second French intervention in Mexico was a much more complex social process than popularly believed, this is because the conservative side and the Empire received great support, not only because of the known participation of the power groups (the clergy and the mostly Criollo landowning oligarchy), but also of a large part of the Indigenous Nations and other popular communities (especially of a rural nature), a phenomenon little studied in the dominant Mexican Historiography. According to the chronicles or stories published by newspapers of the time (such as &quot;La Sociedad&quot;), it was recorded that many communities presented themselves happily upon the arrival of the imperial couple to Mexico (under a Hispanic baroque ceremonial, which integrate popular indigenous folklore), evidencing an immediate indigenous adhesion to the Empire, nostalgic for the Laws of the Indies of the viceregal era. Later, the imperial couple would visit multiple locations to verify institutions, such as schools, hospitals, military barracks, prisons, churches, etc. Press reports of the time denounced the sincere interest of the monarchs in serving the Indians, wanting to give a message of paternalistic and pro-indigenous sovereigns, so they visited the families of the indigenous peoples (they even rested in their huts), received representatives of their communities (holding dinners with the Caciques and promising that they would learn their languages), made donations (with their personal funds and not those of the state) to finance the poor and the construction of infrastructure, going as far as adopting poor Indians.

This behavior of the monarchist indigenous cannot be classified as some act of &quot;betrayal of the country,&quot; and it is necessary to understand the situation in which the different indigenous peoples found themselves in the 1860s to explain the causes of such development. The Reform Laws had not only alienated the properties of the Catholic Church, but also those of indigenous communities (which mostly were allies of catholic clergy). These policies undertaken by the liberal government were not simple measures guided by some racism or perversity, but rather the liberalism embedded in the ruling classes of Mexico could not understand, nor did it seek to accept, the communal ownership of the land that the indigenous communities maintained for thousands of years. For the liberals of the time, property had a meaning only as &quot;individual proprietorship&quot;, the rest was seen as outdated and feudal conceptions. Given this, the &quot;Law of Confiscation of Civil and Religious Communities&quot; of 25 June 1856, issued after the Reform War, was considered a declaration of a war against &quot;the Indian,&quot; who was seen as a discordant element in the development of a &quot;modern national identity&quot; (based on the Equality before the law, intentionally ignoring the differences between criollos and indigenous, unlike on &quot;República de Indios&quot; of the Spanish era, which juridically recognised it and protect indigenous institutions). A newspaper of the time said in this regard that Mexico was on the verge of an inter-ethnic civil war because of the reform, as indigenous opposed Political modernization and defended a Traditionalist conception of social and political life:
Thus, with notable exceptions such as the communities of Guerrero (loyals to the republican) and the peoples who were at war directly with the &quot;white man&quot; (such as the Apaches or the Mayans of Yucatán during Caste War) and remained on the sidelines while fighting against any authority installed in Mexico City and its representatives, most of the different indigenous peoples of Mexico joined the imperial cause in a great monarchical alliance (dreaming of the fall of the republican-liberal government that sought to strip them of their ancestral lands), such as: The Pames and Otomíes with General Tomás Mejía, the Purépechas with General Juan Nepomuceno Almonte, the Coras, Huichols and Mexicas with the General Manuel Lozada, the Pimas, Opatas, Yaquis, Mayos, Seris, Kikapues and Tarahumaras with their respective caciques. Even the Zacapoaxtlas, who gained fame in the Battle of Puebla in 1862, ended up joining the imperial side around 1863, led by Captain Zenobio Cantero. Many Indians served the imperial cause as explorers, translators and guides, others as counter-guerrillas, and still others as volunteers for the Imperial Army. Even occasionally, some Yucatecan indigenous chiefs (in war against the &quot;white man&quot;) said they recognized the authority of the emperor (even traveling to the capital), to later continue developing a Caste War with uprisings against any authority foreign to them. The Imperial Commissioner of Yucatán, José Salazar Ilarregui, for example, would launch a proclamation in Spanish and Mayan to indigenous people of Chan Santa Cruz, with a conciliatory tone to recruit their participation (along with the promise of distributing vacant lands), after having previously been sent by the Empire as a &quot;defense lawyer&quot; to make reports on the complaints and litigation of the Indians to help them.

In this context, the attitude of the indigenous peoples must also be understood when the Juarista, Pedro Pruneda, contemptuously pointed out that the &quot;“Indians everywhere expressed fanatical enthusiasm for Maximiliano.”&quot; Similar opinions are those of General Miguel Negrete who said that &quot;these imbecile Indians have allowed themselves to be seduced by the French&quot; or those of Guillermo Prieto, who described them beforehand as &quot;lazy, parasitic, similar to cankers&quot;, and many others who They called them &quot;“Indians who were traitors to their country.”&quot; Not only with their opinions did the liberal republicans distance themselves from the indigenous peoples of the country, for having put all the country&#x27;s resources at the service of &quot;the cause of the Republic&quot; (which at the same time sought to eradicate the multiple indigenous cultural identities that were conflictive to the modernizing project) but that the Juaristas, based on the state of war, confiscated from the indigenous lands everything they required (food, accommodation and animals), while the French, Austrians and Belgians, in general, paid for what they took. In addition to all this, the emperors Maximilian and Carlota prohibited the &quot;levy&quot;, a practice that the republican armies systematically carried out to force the indigenous people to fight in their ranks, taking men from their communities when they could.

Even Maximilian made efforts to learn Nahuatl. So, in the Mexican Empire, the Laws were published both in Spanish and in Nahuatl, the Aztec language, and Maximilian appointed leading Nahuatl scholar Faustino Galicia as an advisor to his government.

The Empire placed an emphasis on Mexican history and culture, with Maximilian commissioning Mexican painters Rafael Flores, Santiago Rebull, Juan Urruchi, and Petronilo Monroy, to produce works depicting Mexican history, religious subjects, and portraits of Mexican rulers, including the imperial sovereigns themselves. The prefects governing the provinces were instructed to protect archeological artifacts and Maximilian wrote to Europe asking the return of native artifacts that had been taken out of the country during the Spanish conquest, including articles that had belonged to Moctezuma II, and an Aztec codex.

Finally, on 6 June and 15 September 1865, Maximilian promulgated laws that restored legal personality to the indigenous communities and recognized their right to collective possession of their ancestral or government-granted lands (like on times of Spanish Empire monarchy). It is not surprising that although forced recruitment was prohibited in his army, he had numerous volunteers from indigenous peoples. The indigenous component not only joined the lower echelons of the Mexican Empire, but they were part of the new aristocracy that would govern (restoring the Indigenous nobility), being the most ideal in the case of a country with a predominant indigenous component in terms of its number of inhabitants. Characters such as Faustino Chimalpopoca or Josefa Varela, heirs of the ancient tlatoanis, undertook the creation of indigenous intellectual circles close to the Court, whose mission was to rescue and disseminate the ancestral culture, as well as advise the emperors Carlota and Maximilian on matters concerning the indigenous communities that many times, because they were Europeans, they did not understand.

Many of Maximilian&#x27;s reforms were simply revivals of previous Mexican legislation (mostly the Derecho Indiano of Spanish Era). Franciso Arrangoiz who had been Maximilian&#x27;s minister to Britain, Holland, and Belgium, later accused Maximilian of passing such reforms to gain favorable public opinion in Europe, and to give the impression that he had a &#x27;creative genius&#x27; and was &#x27;lifting Mexico out of barbarism.&#x27; 

At Chapultepec Palace on Sundays, Maximilian and Carlota frequently held audiences with people from all social and economic segments, including Mexico&#x27;s Indigenous Communities.

=== Religious Policy ===
Despite initial conflicts, a papal nuncio arrived in the capital of Mexico on 7 December 1864 (just 6 months after Maximilian) in which he requested that they proceed as requested in Pius IX&#x27;s letter of 18 October 1864:

* &quot;Predispose with the cooperation of the bishops the complete and desired reorganization of ecclesiastical affairs.&quot;
* &quot;To repair the evils of the revolution (...) let the Catholic Religion, excluding all other dissident cults, continue to be the glory and support of the Mexican nation.&quot;
* &quot;May the bishops be free in the exercise of their ministry&quot; and &quot;the religious orders be reestablished and reformed in accordance with the powers and instructions communicated by us.&quot;
* &quot;That the heritage of the Church, with its relative rights, be protected and protected&quot;
* &quot;Whoever is not allowed to teach or publish false or subversive maxims.&quot;
* &quot;That public and private education be directed and supervised by the ecclesiastical authority.&quot;
* &quot;Let the ties that have the Church under the dependence and will of the civil government be removed.&quot;

Despite the good will of the Holy See to resolve the differences, Maximilian had offered, on 17 December 1864, a counteroffer (of a regalist nature, conflictive to the ultramontanist tendences in Rome) in a 9-point concordat, which highlighted the following:

* &quot;The Mexican government tolerates all cults that were prohibited by the laws of the country, but grants special protection to the Catholic, apostolic, Roman religion.&quot;
* &quot;The public treasury will provide for the expenses of worship and will pay its ministers, in the same way, in the same proportion and under the same title as the other civil servants of the State.&quot;
* &quot;Catholic priests will administer the sacraments free of charge, without being able to charge the faithful.&quot;
* &quot;The Church transfers to the government all its income from ecclesiastical property, which has been declared national during the Republic.&quot;
* &quot;The Church transfers to the government all its income from ecclesiastical property, which has been declared national during the Republic.&quot;

There were many privileges that Maximian offered to the church, against accusations of being a liberal-modernist heretic, and wanting to protect the Catholic tradition against political modernization from radical liberals. However, the issue of freedom of religion was thorny, considering that in his army there were Muslims (Egyptian and Algerian Mamluks), Orthodox volunteers and volunteer Protestant troops from the Confederate States, Bohemia and Slovakia, so having guaranteed a partial freedom of religion worship could have generated some disputes with those volunteer troops, so it became understandable why he had to be tolerant for pragmatic reasons, despite the claims of his duties as a Catholic to abide by the church&#x27;s condemnations of an unlimited religious freedom. Furthermore, on Charlotte&#x27;s part, there were proposals to promote the migration of settlers from all over the world to take advantage of the Mexican lands, with religious tolerance being necessary to achieve such a cosmopolitan project. At the same time, her claims to wanting to restore the right of the patronato and undermining the autonomy of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction (like it was being doing on the Austrian Empire with Josephinism). All this would put him in clear contradiction with the principles of Pius IX that he had been reminded of.

Still, Charlotte would insist that, like her grandmother, she was submissive to the decrees of the church as she was a sincere catholic devout (although, like the Church of France, she had been raised with the absolutist belief, condemend by the church as Gallican heresy, that a king, by his temporal Power, was &quot;master of his House&quot;, and the church should not change that secularism), and in a letter addressed to Eugenia de Montijo on 18 June 1864, Empress Carlota still declared that the imperial adventure was something of a religious nature, stating at her entrance to the capital that:

However, Maximilian was demonstrating Regalist positions, also shared by the French military leaders, presenting the conviction that the Church should submit to the crown while the clergy should act in a similar way to public officials who would be financed by the state. and not with the economic independence of the Holy See with its self-financing (which explains, according to the Mexican philosohper, Héctor Zagal, the confusion about Maximilian&#x27;s apparent liberalism, because both political doctrines affirm the same subordination of the church to a modern State, but Maximilian, due to his Austrian imperial education, was a follower of pre-liberal ideals), which would continue to lead him into hostilities against the Catholic Church as an institutional and doctrinal body that condemned such heterodoxies and dogmatically defended the independence of the Church from the will of the civil government in the Syllabus of Pius IX, making an understanding almost impossible without Maximilian giving in (something he would not initially achieve in his search to achieve an understanding under his terms). In turn, the Empress Charlotte, probably because of the education of her father (Leopold I of Belgium, accused by traditionalists of having Lutheran and Masonic influences), she would also make hostile statements towards political Catholicism in order to promote the project of consolidating a new Patronato through the Concordate:

Carlota&#x27;s pious friend, Carolina de Grunne, constantly suggested that she be more prudent and reach an agreement with the Vatican, saying that it was preferable to be ruler of an ignorant people like the Mexican (in a good sense of being ignorant of liberal ideologies that promoted bad customs), than a people like the Parisian where they no longer respected the sacraments of the church.

After the conflict between the clergy and Maximilian got stuck, the Archbishop Pelagio Antonio de Labastida y Dávalos and a council of Mexican bishops in 1866 would make a Concordat with more orthodoxy with Catholic social teaching, being more in line with Integralism than Catholic liberalism (which was condemned as heresy). This was due to the near defeat of the Empire and the pression from political assessors on Maximilian, suggesting him to act as an autenthic catholic in politics (so, acting more as a traditionalist) to regain the supports from Mexican conservatives, who were the only ones who could defend his empire after the withdrawal of French troops. That concordat stated the following points:

* &quot;The Roman Catholic apostolic religion, the only true one, continues to be that of the Mexican nation and will always be preserved in it or in the State with all the rights and prerogatives that it must enjoy according to the law of God and the provisions of the sacred canons.&quot;
* &quot;The bishops will exercise their right to examine and censor, in accordance with the provisions of the Holy Council of Trent, all books and productions that for any reason are intended for the public and in any way refer to the dogmas of the faith, the rules of morality and ecclesiastical discipline. The civil authority will provide the bishops with assistance and assistance so that the provisions they dictate in support of religion are fulfilled.&quot;
* &quot;The Roman pontiff having by divine right the primacy of honor and jurisdiction throughout the Church, the bishops, people and clergy will communicate freely with the Holy See. Consequently, the regio exequatur is repealed, reserving, however, his right &quot;to the authorities to previously settle by common agreement, ecclesiastical issues that may affect civil order and that are not settled by this agreement.&quot;
* &quot;His Majesty of him the emperor acknowledges:&quot;
* &quot;He will cause the diocesans of the Empire to enter immediately after this concordat is ratified or published, into possession of all the property that has not been alienated in accordance with the so-called Reform laws or that, having been so, have come into the power of the government as a result of the same. laws, or the revision decreed on 26 February 1865.&quot;
* &quot;It is declared that the assets returned to the Church are free of any liability extraneous to the burdens of its foundation, and that the government is bound by the claims made by those who are or are judged to be creditors of said assets.&quot;
* &quot;With special emphasis, the seminaries and also the schools or educational houses for both sexes that were in charge of the Church will be ordered to be returned to the Church. When such return is not possible, the government, in agreement with the diocesan government, will provide for the seminary one or some of the convent buildings is to the object.&quot;

=== Social Policy ===
Regarding measures to favor the dispossessed, the statute of the empire abolished hereditary debts, prohibited child labor, physical punishment, and forced employers to give one day of rest a week and schools to the children of their employees, decreed the eight-hour work day and abolished strip shops among many other laws and decrees in favor of the most disadvantaged Mexicans. For its part, the &quot;Junta Protectora de Clases Menesterosas&quot; (formed to serve the promulgated laws that )regulate work in the countryside, inter-ethnic conflicts or over the ownership of land and water, safeguarding the community lands of the Indians (usually inherited from the Repartimientos), provision of property (through repartition policies) to those dispossessed of legal property and ejidos, measures to solve th extremely poor situation of indigenous people, peasants, laborers and workers in the face of the new dynamics of industrial society. In addition, debates were held about the place of the indigenous people in society and how to protect them, as well as studies to understand the economic and social state of the Mexican masses in order to resolve their disagreements (especially of the most dispossessed classes). To a large extent, the origin of these laws was due both to addressing the very poor situation of the Indians and dispossessed (after the confiscations) that he inherited, and to Maximiliano&#x27;s own philanthropic personality and his anguish generated by the situation he saw in his personal experiences and observations (especially when coming into contact with the indigenous people in the departments visited) that prompted him to &quot;improve the condition of those unfortunate classes as effectively as possible.&quot;

He also promoted the abolition of slavery among Confederate migrants from the southern United States who requested a colonization project from Maximilian in exchange for helping them defend themselves from American attacks, by declaring that blacks who set foot in Mexico were free men.

== Economy ==

===Railways===
One of the main challenges encountered by the Emperor was the lack of sufficient infrastructure to link the different parts of the realm. The main goal was connecting the port of Veracruz and the capital in Mexico City. In 1857, Don Antonio Escandón secured the right to build a line from the port of Veracruz to Mexico City and on to the Pacific Ocean. Revolution and political instability stifled progress on the financing or construction of the line until 1864, when, under the regime of Emperor Maximilian, the Imperial Mexican Railway Company began construction of the line. Political upheaval continued to stifle progress, and the initial segment from Veracruz to Mexico City was inaugurated nine years later on 1 January 1873 by President Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada.

In 1857 the original proprietors of the government concession, the Masso Brothers, inaugurated on 4 July the train service from Tlatelolco, in México City, to the nearby town of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Eventually they ran out of funds and decided to sell it to Manuel Escandón and Antonio Escandón. The Escandón Brothers continued working and the project, and Antonio Escandón visited the United States and England in the last months of the year. In the first country, he hired Andrew Talcott, and in the latter, he sold company stock. Exploration of a route from Orizaba to Maltrata was performed by engineers Andrew H. Talcott and Pascual Almazán.

During the French intervention, part of the railways were destroyed. The only option available was the establishment of a pact between the French Army, and the two companies of the Escandón Brothers. The French Army was to provide a subsidy to the companies of 120 000 francs a month for the works, and the companies were to establish service from Veracruz to Soledad para by May, actually concluding on 15 August 1862, concluding 41 kilometres of tracks. Next they reached the Camarón station, with a length of 62 kilometres. By 16 October 1864 they reached Paso del Macho with a length of 76 kilometres.

On 19 September 1864, the Imperial Mexican Railway Company (Compañía Limitada del Ferrocarril Imperial Mexicano) was Incorporated in London to complete the earlier projects and continued construction on this line. Escandón ceded his privileges to the new company. Smith, Knight and Co. was later contracted in 1864 by the Imperial Mexican Railway to continue work on the line from Mexico City to Veracruz. William Elliot was employed as Chief Assistant for three years on the construction of about 70 miles of the heaviest portion of the Mexican Railway, after which he returned to England. He had several years of experience building railways in England, India, and Brazil. In this last country, he held the position of Engineer-in-Chief of the province of São Paulo.

Maximiliano I hired engineer M Lyons for the construction of the line from La Soledad to Monte del Chiquihuite, later on joining the line from Veracruz to Paso del Macho. Works were begun in Maltrata, at the same time that the works from Veracruz and Mexico City kept moving forward. By the end of the Empire in June 1867, 76 kilometers from Veracruz to Paso del Macho were functional (part of the concession to Lyons) and the line from Mexico City reached Apizaco with 139 km.

===Banking===
Before 1864, there was no system of banking in Mexico. Religious institutions were a source of credit for elites, usually for landed estates or urban property. During the French Intervention, the branch of a British bank was opened. The London Bank of Mexico and South America Ltd. began operations with a capital of two and a half million pesos. It belonged to the Baring Brothers Group, and had its head office in the corner of the Capuchinas and Lerdo Streets in Downtown Mexico City.

===Foreign trade===
At the beginning of the American Civil War, the city of Matamoros was simply a sleepy little border town across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas. It had, for several years, been considered a port, but it had relatively few ships arriving. Previous to the war, accounts mention that not over six ships entered the port each year. In about four years, Matamoros, due to its proximity to Texas, became an active port, and the number of inhabitants increased. A general of the Union Army in 1865 describes the importance of the port in Matamoros:

The cotton trade brought together in Bagdad, Tamaulipas and Matamoros over 20,000 speculators from the Union and the Confederacy, England, France, and Germany. Bagdad had grown from a small, seashore town to a &quot;full-pledge town.&quot; The English-speaking population in the area by 1864 was so great that Matamoros even had a newspaper printed in English—it was called the &quot;Matamoros Morning Call&quot;. In addition, the port exported cotton to England and France, where millions of people needed it for their daily livelihood, and it was possible to receive fifty cents per pound in gold for cotton, when it cost about three cents in the Confederacy, &quot;and much more money was received for it laid down in New York and European ports.&quot; Other sources mention that the port of Matamoros traded with London, Havana, Belize, and New Orleans. The Matamoros and New York City trade agreement, however, continued throughout the war and until 1864, and it was considered &quot;heavy and profitable.&quot;

By 1865, Matamoros was described as a prosperous town of 30,000 people, and Lew Wallace informed General Ulysses S. Grant that neither Baltimore or New Orleans could compare itself to the growing commercial activity of Matamoros. Nevertheless, after the collapse of the Confederacy, &quot;gloom, despondency, and despair&quot; became evident in Matamoros—markets shut down, business almost ceased to exist, and ships were rarely seen. &quot;For Sale&quot; signs began to sprout up everywhere, and Matamoros returned to its role of a sleepy little border town across the Rio Grande.

The conclusion of the American Civil War brought a severe crisis to the now abandoned Port of Bagdad, a crisis that until this day the port has never recovered from. In addition, a tremendous hurricane in 1889 destroyed the desolated port. This same hurricane was one of the many hurricanes during the period of devastating hurricanes of 1870 to 1889, which reduced the population of Matamoros to nearly half its size, mounting with it another upsetting economic downturn.

==Territorial division==

Maximilian I wanted to reorganize the territory following scientific criteria, instead of following historical ties, traditional allegiances and the interests of local groups. The task of designing this new division was given to Manuel Orozco y Berra.

This task was realized according to the following criteria: 
* The territory should be divided in at least fifty departments, 
* Whenever possible, natural boundaries shall be preferred, 
* For the territorial extension of each department, the configuration of the terrain, climate and elements of production were taken into consideration so that in due time, they could have a roughly equal number of inhabitants.

On 13 March 1865, the new Law on the territorial division of the Mexican Empire was published. The Empire was divided into 50 departments, though not every department was ever able to be administered due to the ongoing war.

==Legacy==

In spite of the Empire lasting only a few years, the results of Maximilian&#x27;s construction projects survived him and remain prominent Mexico City landmarks in the present day.

For his royal residence, Maximilian decided to renovate a former viceregal villa in Mexico City, which was also notable for being the site of a battle during the U.S. invasion of Mexico. The result would be Chapultepec Castle, the only castle in North America ever to be used by a monarch. After the fall of the empire, Chapultepec Castle served as the official residence of the Mexican president up until 1940, when it was converted into a museum.

In order to connect the palace to the government offices in Mexico city, Maximilian also built a prominent road which he called Paseo de la Emperatriz (&quot;The Empress&#x27; Promenade&quot;). After the fall of the Empire, the government renamed it Paseo de la Reforma (&quot;Promenade of the Reform&quot;) to commemorate La Reforma. In the present, it continues to be one of the most prominent avenues of the capital and is lined with civic monuments.

The bolillo, a type of bread widespread in Mexican cuisine, was brought to the country by Maximilian&#x27;s cooks, and remains another legacy of the Imperial Era.

Today, the Second Mexican Empire is advocated by small far-right groups like the Nationalist Front of Mexico, whose followers believe the Empire to have been a legitimate attempt to deliver Mexico from the hegemony of the United States. They are reported to gather every year at Querétaro, the place where Maximilian and his generals were executed.

==In popular culture==
The 1970 film &quot;Two Mules for Sister Sara&quot; was set in Mexico during the years of the Second Mexican Empire. The two main characters, played by Clint Eastwood and Shirley MacLaine, aided a Mexican resistance force and ultimately led them to overpower a French garrison.

The 1969 film &quot;The Undefeated&quot; starring John Wayne and Rock Hudson portrays events during the French Intervention in Mexico and was also loosely based on the escape of Confederate General Sterling Price to Mexico after the American Civil War and his attempt to join with Maximilian&#x27;s forces.

The 1965 film &quot;Major Dundee&quot; starring Charlton Heston and Richard Harris featured Union cavalry (supplemented by Galvanized Yankees) crossing into Mexico and fighting French forces towards the end of the American Civil War.

The 1954 film &quot;Vera Cruz&quot; was also set in Mexico and has an appearance of Maximilian having a target shooting competition with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster&#x27;s character at Chapultepec Castle. Maximilian was played by George Macready, who at 54 was twenty years older than the Emperor was in 1866.

The 1939 film &quot;Juarez&quot; featured Paul Muni as Benito Juárez, Bette Davis as Empress Carlota, and Brian Aherne as Emperor Maximilian. It was based, in part, on Bertita Harding&#x27;s novel &quot;The Phantom Crown&quot; (1937).

In the &quot;Southern Victory Series&quot; by Harry Turtledove, Maximilian&#x27;s Empire survives the turmoil of the 1860s into the 20th century due to the Confederate States emerging victorious in its battle against the United States in the &quot;War of Secession&quot;.

The 1990 novel &quot;The Difference Engine&quot;, co-authored by William Gibson and Bruce Stirling, is set in an alternate 1855 where the timeline diverged in 1824 with Charles Babbage&#x27;s completion of the difference engine. One consequence is the occupation of Mexico by the Second French Empire with Napoleon III as the de facto emperor instead of the installation of Emperor Maximilian.

In Mexican popular culture, there have been soap operas like &quot;El Carruaje&quot; (1967), plays, films, and historical novels such as Fernando del Paso&#x27;s &quot;Noticias del Imperio&quot; (1987). Biographies, memoirs, and novels have been published since the 1860s, and among the most recent have been Prince Michael of Greece&#x27;s &quot;The Empress of Farewells&quot;, available in various languages.

<doc id="601123" wikidata="Q2347010" url="?curid=601123" title="USS Hornet (1775)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Hornet&quot; was a merchant sloop chartered from Captain William Stone in December 1775 to serve under Stone as a unit of Esek Hopkins&#x27; Fleet. The voyage would be the first military action for master&#x27;s mate Joshua Barney. The vessel was damaged while sailing with the fleet and returned to base. &quot;Hornet&quot; patrolled Delaware Bay until being captured on 27 April 1777 by the Royal Navy. &quot;Hornet&quot; was taken to Jamaica, where the ship was found to be leaking and was condemned.

==Background==
There is some degree of discrepancy in dates concerning both the &quot;Hornet&quot; and the ship , both of which fitted out in Baltimore, Maryland. The biography of Joshua Barney claims that upon his return to Baltimore after a voyage aboard the ship &quot;Sydney&quot; (which he had taken command of after the death of her captain) he signed onto be first mate aboard the &quot;Hornet&quot; and was first tasked to recruit a crew. Part of the way he did this was by hoisting an &quot;American Flag&quot; provided from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by Hopkins, indicating the ships were already accepted into the fleet. The &quot;Naval Documents of the American Revolution&quot;, volume 2, p. 583 place the date of this return as 23 October 1775. Barney claims that after fitting out, both the &quot;Hornet&quot; and the &quot;Wasp&quot; sailed in company to join the fleet at Philadelphia at the end of November.

However, colonial records show that on 2 December 1775, Colonel Benjamin Harrison was dispatched to Baltimore to acquire 2–3 ships to be armed and augment Esek Hopkins&#x27;s fleet. These ships are identified as being the &quot;Hornet&quot; and the &quot;Wasp&quot;. Both vessels are noted by the Baltimore Committee as being fitting out as of 18 December 1775. Both the &quot;Hornet&quot; and the &quot;Wasp&quot; are noted as joining the fleet in Philadelphia on 13 February 1776. Given the dates from the Colonial sources come from the records of government bodies in the course of their work and that the dates from Mary Barney&#x27;s account come from family papers and recollections, it is more likely that Barney&#x27;s dates are in error and that the events in question happened according to the later timeline. Hence, it is probably safer to say that the &quot;Hornet&quot; along with the &quot;Wasp&quot; was acquired by the Continental Congress via the efforts of Col. Harrison between 2 and 18 December, fitted out between the date of acquisition along with the &quot;Wasp&quot;, and then were commissioned into the Continental Navy on 13 February 1776 after joining the fleet in Philadelphia.

==Service==
&quot;Hornet&quot; then sailed with Hopkins fleet 18 February 1776. Outside the Virginia Capes, she ran afoul of and was unable to accompany the fleet for the amphibious assault on New Providence. On 27 August 1776, Congress offer to purchase the &quot;Hornet&quot; from her owner, William Stone. She patrolled in the Delaware Bay for nearly a year, then ran the British blockade to convoy merchantmen to Charleston.

&quot;Hornet&quot; was captured by HM schooner &quot;Porcupine&quot; on 27 April 1777. According to records of the Vice Admiralty Court at Jamaica, &quot;Hornet&quot; was built in Bermuda, of 100 tons burden, mounted ten carriage guns and four swivels, and had a crew of thirty-five. She sailed from Philadelphia in January or February 1777 for Charleston in ballast, and at the latter place loaded twenty barrels of rice and twenty-six barrels of indigo for Martinique. The action with &quot;Porcupine&quot;, which lasted three-quarters of an hour, took place in latitude 22.5 degrees north, and longitude 70 degrees west (roughly north northeast of Cockburn Town), with upwards of fifty shot being fired. Upon arrival in Jamaica the &quot;Hornet&quot; was leaky, and, after condemnation, was appraised at £2443.12, including cargo, stores and gunpowder.

<text>Irvine Luther Lenroot (January 31, 1869 – January 26, 1949) was an American attorney, jurist, and Republican Party politician from Wisconsin. He served as Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1903 to 1907 and represented the state in the United States Congress from 1909 to 1927, first in the United States House of Representatives until 1918, and then in the United States Senate. After he lost the Republican nomination in 1926, Herbert Hoover nominated him to the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.

==Education and career==
Born on January 31, 1869, in Superior, Wisconsin, Lenroot attended the common schools, then attended Parsons Business College in Duluth, Minnesota and read law in 1897. He was a logger and reporter for the Douglas County, Wisconsin Superior Court from 1893 to 1906. He was admitted to the bar and entered private practice in Superior in 1898. He was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1901 to 1907, serving as Speaker from 1903 to 1907.

==Congressional service==

Lenroot was elected as a Republican from the 11th congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 61st United States Congress and to the four succeeding Congresses and served from March 4, 1909, until April 17, 1918, when he resigned, having been elected Senator. He was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate on April 2, 1918, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of United States Senator Paul O. Husting. He was reelected in 1920 and served from April 18, 1918, to March 3, 1927. Lenroot was a close ally of Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover, and favored raising federal reserve rates in 1936.He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1926. He was Chairman of the Committee on Railroads in the 66th United States Congress, Committee on Public Lands and Surveys in the 68th United States Congress and the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds in the 69th United States Congress. He resumed the practice of law in Washington, D.C. from 1927 to 1929.

==1920 Republican Convention==

Lenroot attended the 1920 Republican National Convention at the Chicago Coliseum, and after the selection of Warren G. Harding of Ohio as the nominee for president, party leaders decided that the progressive Lenroot would be a balance to a ticket with the more conservative Harding. By Saturday night, June 12, many of the delegates had gone home, along with most of the party bosses. After Lenroot&#x27;s name had been placed in nomination and seconded but before a vote could be taken, an Oregon delegate, Wallace McCamant, nominated Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts for vice president. Unfettered by party bosses, the delegates weighed in for Coolidge, who received 674 votes to Lenroot&#x27;s 146 and won on the first ballot.

==Federal judicial service==

Lenroot was nominated by President Herbert Hoover on April 22, 1929, to an Associate Judge seat on the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals vacated by Associate Judge Orion M. Barber. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 17, 1929, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on April 30, 1944, due to his retirement. He died on January 26, 1949, in Washington, D.C. He was interred in Greenwood Cemetery in Superior. The Associated Press report of his death began, &quot;Former Senator Irvine L. Lenroot of Wisconsin, the man who might have been the 30th President of the United States, died Wednesday night.&quot;

==Personal life==
Lenroot married Clara Clough of Superior, who wrote a short memoir of her girlhood in Wisconsin in the 1860s and 1870s. His daughter, Katherine Lenroot, was known for successfully lobbying for the Fair Labor Standards Act and the enforcing of child labor laws.

Lenroot was born to Lars Lönnrot (Lenroot), a Swedish immigrant and farmer for whom Lenroot&#x27;s Addition in the Smithville area of Duluth, Minnesota, is named.

<text>This is a list of Democratic National Conventions. These conventions are the presidential nominating conventions of the Democratic Party of the United States of America.

==List of Democratic National Conventions==
* Conventions whose nominees won the subsequent presidential election are tinted in light blue.
* Four other conventions — in 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016 — which nominated candidates who won the popular vote, but not the Electoral College, are tinted in pale yellow.

Footnotes

1[1832] A resolution endorsing &quot;the repeated nominations which he [Jackson] has received in various parts of the Union&quot; was passed by the convention.

2[1840] A resolution stating &quot;that the convention deem it expedient at the present time not to choose between the individuals in nomination, but to leave the decision to their Republican fellow-citizens in the several states&quot; was passed by the convention. Most Van Buren electors voted for Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky for the vice presidency; others voted for Littleton Waller Tazewell of Virginia and James K. Polk of Tennessee in the election of 1840.

3[1844] Silas Wright of New York was first nominated and he declined the nomination.

4[1860 June] Caleb Cushing resigned as permanent chair.

5[1860 June] Douglas and Johnson were chosen as the candidates of the Front Street Theater convention after most of the Southern delegations walked out. The convention bolters soon formed their own convention, located at the Maryland Institute, also in Baltimore, on June 28, 1860. At their convention Caleb Cushing again served as permanent chair and John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky was nominated for the presidency and Joseph Lane of Oregon was nominated for the vice presidency. (1860 Southern Democratic platform)

6[1860 June] Benjamin Fitzpatrick of Alabama was first nominated but he declined the nomination.

7[1872] Greeley and B. Gratz Brown had already been endorsed by the Liberal Republican Party, meeting on May 1 in Cincinnati. A dissident group of Straight-Out Democrats, meeting in Louisville, Kentucky on September 3, nominated Charles O&#x27;Conor of New York for President and John Quincy Adams II of Massachusetts for Vice President, but both men declined the nomination.
8[1896] &quot;Gold&quot; Democrats opposed to the Free Silver plank of the 1896 platform and to Wm J. Bryan&#x27;s candidacy convened as the National Democratic Party in Indianapolis on September 2, and nominated John M. Palmer of Illinois for President and former Governor Simon Bolivar Buckner of Kentucky for Vice President.
9[1896] Bryan was later nominated for President in St. Louis, together with Thomas E. Watson of Georgia for Vice President, by the National Silver Republican Party meeting on July 22, and by the People&#x27;s Party (Populists) meeting on July 25.
10 [1948] Breakaway delegations left the Philadelphia Convention for conventions of the Progressive and States Rights Democratic Parties. The Progressives, meeting on July 23, also in Philadelphia, nominated former Vice President Henry A. Wallace of Iowa for President and Senator Glen H. Taylor of Idaho for Vice President. (1948 Progressive Party platform)The States&#x27; Rights Democrats (or &quot;Dixiecrats&quot;), meeting in Birmingham, Alabama on July 17, nominated Governors Strom Thurmond of South Carolina for President and Fielding Wright of Mississippi for Vice President. (1948 States&#x27; Rights Democratic platform)

11[1972] Eagleton withdrew his candidacy after the convention and was replaced by Sargent Shriver of Maryland.

12[2016] Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida was intended to be the Temporary Chair, but was substituted for Stephanie Rawlings-Blake by the Democratic National Committee in the wake of the Wasserman/DNC email leak scandal. Wasserman resigned as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee effective after the close of the convention.

13[2020] Originally scheduled for July 13–16, and originally planned for the Fiserv Forum, but postponed and moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

14[2020] Centered in Milwaukee, but many speeches and roll call responses were given remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>The Green Party of South Africa (GPSA) is a small political party in the Western Cape province. It is a member of the Federation of Green Parties of Africa.

==History of Green politics in South Africa==

The Ecology Party was established in November 1989, but disbanded after recruiting only 1 800 members.

Ian Brownlie launched the Green Party (GRP) in July 1992, but it too disbanded after failing to win a seat in the Western Cape Provincial legislature during the 1994 Provincial and National general elections under the leadership of Nathan Grant.

Judy Sole founded the Government by the People Green Party (GPGP) in 1999, which she later renamed to The Green Party of South Africa. The party has contested elections as the Green Party of South Africa since the 2000 local elections. Due to the lack of funding the Green Party of South Africa only participated in the 2004 provincial elections but was reconstituted in early February 2019 to contest the provincial elections.

<doc id="601131" wikidata="Q988450" url="?curid=601131" title="Deflationary theory of truth">
<text>In philosophy and logic, a deflationary theory of truth (also semantic deflationism or simply deflationism) is one of a family of theories that all have in common the claim that assertions of predicate truth of a statement do not attribute a property called &quot;truth&quot; to such a statement.

==Redundancy theory==
Gottlob Frege was probably the first philosopher or logician to note that predicating truth or existence does not express anything above and beyond the statement to which it is attributed. He remarked:

It is worthy of notice that the sentence &quot;I smell the scent of violets&quot; has the same content as the sentence &quot;it is true that I smell the scent of violets&quot;. So it seems, then, that nothing is added to the thought by my ascribing to it the property of truth. (Frege, G., 1918. &quot;Thought&quot;, in his &quot;Logical Investigations&quot;, Oxford: Blackwell, 1977)
Nevertheless, the first serious attempt at the formulation of a theory of truth which attempted to systematically define the truth predicate out of existence is attributable to F. P. Ramsey. Ramsey argued, against the prevailing currents of the times, that not only was it not necessary to construct a theory of truth on the foundation of a prior theory of meaning (or mental content) but that once a theory of content had been successfully formulated, it would become obvious that there was no further need for a theory of truth, since the truth predicate would be demonstrated to be redundant. Hence, his particular version of deflationism is commonly referred to as the &quot;redundancy theory&quot;. Ramsey noted that in ordinary contexts in which we attribute truth to a proposition directly, as in &quot;It is true that Caesar was murdered&quot;, the predicate &quot;is true&quot; does not seem to be doing any work. &quot;It is true that Caesar was murdered&quot; just means &quot;Caesar was murdered&quot; and &quot;It is false that Caesar was murdered&quot; just means that &quot;Caesar was not murdered&quot;.

Ramsey recognized that the simple elimination of the truth-predicate from all statements in which it is used in ordinary language was not the way to go about attempting to construct a comprehensive theory of truth. For example, take the sentence &quot;Everything that John says is true&quot;. This can be easily translated into the formal sentence with variables ranging over propositions &quot;For all P, if John says P, then P is true.&quot; But attempting to directly eliminate &quot;is true&quot; from this sentence, on the standard first-order interpretation of quantification in terms of objects, would result in the ungrammatical formulation &quot;For all P, if John says P, then P.&quot; It is ungrammatical because P must, in that case, be replaced by the name of an &quot;object&quot; and not a proposition. Ramsey&#x27;s approach was to suggest that such sentences as &quot;He is always right&quot; could be expressed in terms of relations: &quot;For all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;R&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, if he asserts &quot;aRb&quot;, then &quot;aRb&quot;&quot;.

Ramsey also noticed that, although his paraphrasings and definitions could be easily rendered in logical symbolism, the more fundamental problem was that, in ordinary English, the elimination of the truth-predicate in a phrase such as &quot;Everything John says is true&quot; would result in something like &quot;If John says something, then &quot;that&quot;&quot;. Ramsey attributed this to a defect in natural language, suggesting that such &quot;pro-sentences&quot; as &quot;that&quot; and &quot;what&quot; were being treated as if they were pronouns. This &quot;gives rise to artificial problems as to the nature of truth, which disappear at once when they are expressed in logical symbolism...&quot; According to Ramsey, it is only because natural languages lack, what he called, &quot;pro-sentences&quot; (expressions that stand in relation to sentences as pronouns stand to nouns) that the truth predicate cannot be defined away in all contexts.

A. J. Ayer took Ramsey&#x27;s idea one step further by declaring that the redundancy of the truth predicate implies that there is no such &quot;property&quot; as truth.

There are sentences...in which the word &quot;truth&quot; seems to stand for something real; and this leads the speculative philosopher to enquire what this &quot;something&quot; is. Naturally he fails to obtain a satisfactory answer, since his question is illegitimate. For our analysis has shown that the word &quot;truth&quot; does not stand for anything, in the way which such a question requires.

This extreme version of deflationism has often been called the &quot;disappearance theory&quot; or the &quot;no truth&quot; theory of truth and it is easy to understand why, since Ayer seems here to be claiming both that the &quot;predicate&quot; &quot;is true&quot; is redundant (and therefore unnecessary) and &quot;also&quot; that there is no such &quot;property&quot; as truth to speak of.

==Performative theory==

Peter Strawson formulated a &quot;performative theory&quot; of truth in the 1950s. Like Ramsey, Strawson believed that there was no separate problem of truth apart from determining the semantic contents (or facts of the world) which give the words and sentences of language the meanings that they have. Once the questions of meaning and reference are resolved, there is no further question of truth. Strawson&#x27;s view differs from Ramsey&#x27;s, however, in that Strawson maintains that there is an important role for the expression &quot;is true&quot;: specifically, it has a &quot;performative&quot; role similar to &quot;I promise to clean the house&quot;. In asserting that &quot;p&quot; is true, we not only assert that &quot;p&quot; but also perform the &quot;speech act&quot; of confirming the truth of a statement in a context. We signal our agreement or approbation of a previously uttered assertion or confirm some commonly held belief or imply that what we are asserting is likely to be accepted by others in the same context.

==Tarski and deflationary theories==
Some years before Strawson developed his account of the sentences which include the truth-predicate as performative utterances, Alfred Tarski had developed his so-called semantic theory of truth. Tarski&#x27;s basic goal was to provide a rigorously logical definition of the expression &quot;true sentence&quot; within a &quot;specific formal language&quot; and to clarify the fundamental conditions of &quot;material adequacy&quot; that would have to be met by any definition of the truth-predicate. If all such conditions were met, then it would be possible to avoid semantic paradoxes such as the liar paradox (i.e., &quot;This sentence is false.&quot;) Tarski&#x27;s material adequacy condition, or Convention T, is: a definition of truth for an object language implies all instances of the sentential form

:(T) &quot;S&quot; is &quot;true&quot; if and only if &quot;P&quot;

where &quot;S&quot; is replaced by a name of a sentence (in the object language) and &quot;P&quot; is replaced by a translation of that sentence in the metalanguage. So, for example, &quot;&quot;La neve è bianca&quot; is &quot;true&quot; if and only if snow is white&quot; is a sentence which conforms to Convention T; the object language is Italian and the metalanguage is English. The predicate &quot;&quot;true&quot; does not appear in the object language, so no sentence of the object language can directly or indirectly assert truth or falsity of itself. Tarski thus formulated a two-tiered scheme that avoids semantic paradoxes such as Russell&#x27;s paradox.

Tarski formulated his definition of truth indirectly through a recursive definition of the satisfaction of sentential functions and then by defining truth in terms of satisfaction. An example of a sentential function is &quot;x&quot; defeated &quot;y&quot; in the 2004 US presidential elections&quot;; this function is said to be satisfied when we replace the variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; with the names of objects such that they stand in the relation denoted by &quot;defeated in the 2004 US presidential elections&quot; (in the case just mentioned, replacing &quot;x&quot; with &quot;George W. Bush&quot; and &quot;y&quot; with &quot;John Kerry&quot; would satisfy the function, resulting in a true sentence). In general, &quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; &quot;satisfy&quot; an &quot;n&quot;-ary predicate φ(&quot;x&quot;1. ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) if and only if substitution of the names &quot;&quot;a&quot;1&quot;, ..., &quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot; for the variables of φ in the relevant order yields &quot;φ(&quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;)&quot;, and φ(&quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;). Given a method for establishing the satisfaction (or not) of every atomic sentence of the form &quot;A&quot;(..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;, ...), the usual rules for truth-functional connectives and quantifiers yield a definition for the satisfaction condition of all sentences of the object language. For instance, for any two sentences &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, the sentence &quot;A&quot; &amp; &quot;B&quot; is satisfied if and only if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are satisfied (where &#x27;&amp;&#x27; stands for conjunction), for any sentence &quot;A&quot;, ~&quot;A&quot; is satisfied if and only if &quot;A&quot; fails to be satisfied, and for any open sentence &quot;A&quot; where x is free in &quot;A&quot;, (x)&quot;A&quot; is satisfied if and only if for every substitution of an item of the domain for &quot;x&quot; yielding &quot;A&quot;*, &quot;A&quot;* is satisfied. Whether any complex sentence is satisfied is seen to be determined by its structure. An interpretation is an assignment of denotation to all of the non-logical terms of the object language. A sentence &quot;A&quot; is true (under an interpretation &quot;I&quot;) if and only if it is satisfied in &quot;I&quot;.

Tarski thought of his theory as a species of correspondence theory of truth, not a deflationary theory.

==Disquotationalism==
On the basis of Tarski&#x27;s semantic conception, W. V. O. Quine developed what eventually came to be called the &quot;disquotational theory of truth&quot; or &quot;disquotationalism&quot;. Quine interpreted Tarski&#x27;s theory as essentially deflationary. He accepted Tarski&#x27;s treatment of sentences as the only truth-bearers. Consequently, Quine suggested that the truth-predicate could only be applied to sentences within individual languages. The basic principle of disquotationalism is that an attribution of truth to a sentence undoes the effects of the quotation marks that have been used to form sentences. Instead of (T) above then, Quine&#x27;s reformulation would be something like the following &quot;Disquotation Schema&quot;:

:(DS) Sentence &quot;S&quot; is true if and only if S.

Disquotationalists are able to explain the existence and usefulness of the truth predicate in such contexts of generalization as &quot;John believes everything that Mary says&quot; by asserting, with Quine, that we cannot dispense with the truth predicate in these contexts because the convenient expression of such generalization is precisely the role of the truth predicate in language. In the case of &quot;John believes everything that Mary says&quot;, if we try to capture the content of John&#x27;s beliefs, we would need to form an infinite conjunction such as the following:

:If Mary says that lemons are yellow, then lemons are yellow, and if Mary says that lemons are green, then lemons are green, and...

The disquotation schema (DS), allows us to reformulate this as:

:If Mary says that lemons are yellow, then the sentence &quot;lemons are yellow&quot; is true, and if Mary says that lemons are green, then the sentence &quot;lemons are green&quot; is true, and...

Since &quot;x&quot; is equivalent to &quot;&quot;x&quot; is true&quot;, for the disquotationalist, then the above infinite conjunctions are also equivalent. Consequently, we can form the generalization:

:For all sentences &quot;S&quot;, if Mary said S, then &quot;S&quot; is true.

Since we could not express this statement without a truth-predicate along the lines of those defined by deflationary theories, it is the role of the truth predicate in forming such generalizations that characterizes all that needs to be characterized about the concept of truth.

==Prosententialism==
Grover, Camp and Belnap developed a deflationary theory of truth called &quot;prosententialism&quot;, which has since been defended by Robert Brandom.

Prosententialism asserts that there are prosentences which stand in for and derive their meanings from the sentences which they substitute. In the statement:

:&quot;Bill is tired and he is hungry.&quot;

the pronoun &quot;he&quot; takes its reference from the noun &quot;Bill.&quot; By analogy, in the statement:

:&quot;He explained that he was in financial straits, said that this is how things were, and that therefore he needed an advance.&quot;

the clause &quot;this is how things were&quot; receives its reference from the previously occurring sentential clause &quot;he was in financial straits&quot;, according to a prosententialist account.

How does this relate to truth? Prosententialists view the statements that contain &quot;is true&quot; as sentences which do not contain a truth-predicate but rather contain &quot;some&quot; form of prosentence; the truth-predicate itself is part of an anaphoric or prosentential construction. Prosententialists point out the many parallels which exist between pronouns and prosentences. Pronouns are often used out of &quot;laziness&quot;, as in:

:&quot;Bill is tired and he is hungry&quot;

or they can be used in quantificational contexts, such as:

:&quot;Someone is in the room and he is armed with a rifle&quot;.

In a similar manner, &quot;it is true&quot; can be used as a prosentence of laziness, as in:

:&quot;Fred believes that it is raining and it is true.&quot;

and as a quantificational prosentence, such as:

:&quot;Whatever Alice believes is true&quot;.

Prosententialists therefore reject the idea that truth is a property of some sort.

==Minimalism==

Paul Horwich&#x27;s minimal theory of truth, also known as minimalism, takes the primary truth-bearing entities to be propositions, rather than sentences. According to the minimalist view then, truth is indeed a property of propositions (or sentences, as the case may be) but it is so minimal and anomalous a property that it cannot be said to provide us with any useful information about or insight into the nature of truth. It is fundamentally nothing more than a sort of metalinguistic property.

Another way of formulating the minimalist thesis is to assert that the conjunction of all of the instances of the following schema:

:&quot;The proposition that P is true if and only if P&quot;.

provides an implicit definition of the property of truth. Each such instance is an axiom of the theory and there are an infinite number of such instances (one for every actual or possible proposition in the universe). Our concept of truth consists of nothing more than a disposition to assent to all of the instances of the above schema when we encounter them.

==Objections to deflationism==
One of the main objections to deflationary theories of all flavors was formulated by Jackson, Oppy and Smith in 1994 (following Kirkham 1992). According to the objection, if deflationism is interpreted as a &quot;sentential&quot; theory (that is, one where truth is predicated of sentences on the left hand side of the biconditionals such as (T) above), then deflationism is false; on the other hand, if it is interpreted as a &quot;propositional&quot; theory, then it is trivial. Examining another simple instance of the standard equivalence schema:

:&quot;Grass is green&quot; is true if and only if grass is green.

the objection is just that, if the italicized words are taken as a &quot;sentence&quot;, then it is false, because something more is required for the whole statement to be true than merely the fact that &quot;grass is green&quot; is true. It is also necessary that the sentence &quot;grass is green&quot; means that grass is green and this further &quot;linguistic&quot; fact is not dealt with in the equivalence schema.

However, if we now assume that &quot;grass is green&quot; on the left-hand side refers to a proposition, then the theory seems trivial since grass is green is defined as true if and only if grass is green. Note that the triviality involved here is not caused by the concept of truth but by that of &quot;proposition&quot;. In any case, simply accepting the triviality of the propositional version implies that, at least within the Deflationary Theory of Truth, there can be no explanation of the connection between sentences and the things that they express; i.e., propositions.

===Normativity of assertions===
Michael Dummett, among others, has argued that deflationism cannot account for the fact that truth should be a normative goal of assertion. The idea is that truth plays a central role in the activity of stating facts. The deflationist response is that the assertion that truth is a norm of assertion can be stated only in the form of the following infinite conjunction:

One should assert the proposition that grass is green only if grass is green and one should assert the proposition that lemons are yellow only if lemons are yellow and one should assert the proposition that a square circle is impossible only if a squared circle is impossible and...

This, in turn, can be reformulated as:

:For all propositions P, speakers should assert the propositions that P only if the proposition that P is true.

It may be the case that we use the truth-predicate to express this norm, not because it has anything to do with the nature of truth in some inflationary sense, but because it is a convenient way of expressing this otherwise inexpressible generalization.

<doc id="601133" wikidata="Q756702" url="?curid=601133" title="Atlantis PbeM">
<text>Atlantis is a free open-ended multi-player computer moderated fantasy turn-based strategy game for any number of players. It is played via email. The game world is populated by many races and monsters. Players may attempt to carve out huge empires, become master magicians, intrepid explorers, rich traders or any other career that comes to mind and interact with other players in trade, war and alliances. There is no declared winner of the game, players set their own objectives, and one can join at any time.

== History ==
Russell Wallace developed the initial version and ran the first game, &quot;Atlantis 1.0&quot; in 1993. Geoff Dunbar continued the legacy, first with the extensive playtest of &quot;Atlantis 2.0&quot;, and then the commercial game &quot;Atlantis 3.0&quot;. In 1999 &quot;Atlantis 4.0&quot; was created by Geoff Dunbar and released under terms of GNU GPL. &quot;AtlantisDev&quot; Yahoo Group was formed sometime after that and Joseph Traub became the maintainer of the code. &quot;Atlantis 4.0&quot; was later expanded on by various contributors from the AtlantisDev group.

Since 2011 development uses Git. Currently several developers contribute to server code on GitHub.

== Software ==
* Atlantis 5 server source code. The project&#x27;s GitHub repository
* Atlantis Little Helper open source GUI client
* Atlantis Crystal Ball free GUI client
* Atlantis Advisor GUI client
* AtlaClient GUI client

== Running Games ==
* Atlantis New Origins. Recurring game using version 5.2.5 with updates. 3 days / week initially moving to 2 days / week turns after about turn 20. Most recent game (v7) started at 9 Sep 2024.
* Twilight Atlantis (Miskatonic 5). Version 4.2 game with 3 days / week turns.

<text>Sir Mark Trevor Phillips (born 31 December 1953) is a British writer, broadcaster and former politician who served as Chair of the London Assembly from 2000 to 2001 and from 2002 to 2003. He presented &quot;Trevor Phillips on Sunday&quot;, a Sunday morning talk show on Sky News, from 2021 to 2022, and currently presents &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; on Sky News since 2023. 

Phillips was appointed head of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2003 and was the chairman of its successor, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), from 2007 to 2012. He has been a television presenter and executive.

After retirement, he continued to chair numerous corporate and social boards. Phillips was the President of the Partnership Council of the John Lewis Partnership from 2015 to 2019 and was the first external appointment for the role since 1928.

==Early life and education==
Mark Trevor Phillips was born in Islington, London, the youngest of ten children. His parents emigrated from British Guiana (now Guyana) in 1950. He spent his childhood partly in British Guiana, and partly in Wood Green, north London; he attended Wood Green County Grammar School, but took his A-levels at Queen&#x27;s College in Georgetown, Guyana. He returned to England to study at Imperial College London, where he obtained a BSc degree in chemistry in 1975.

==Broadcasting and writing career==
Phillips worked initially as a researcher for London Weekend Television (LWT), before being promoted to head of current affairs in 1992, remaining in the post until 1994. He produced and presented &quot;The London Programme&quot; for LWT and has worked on projects for the BBC and Channel 4. With his brother, the crime writer Mike Phillips, he wrote &quot;Windrush: The Irresistible Rise of Multi-racial Britain&quot;. He has won three Royal Television Society (RTS) awards, including Documentary Series of the Year for &quot;Windrush&quot; in 1999. He is a Vice President of the RTS.

In March 2015, Channel 4 broadcast &quot;Things We Won&#x27;t Say About Race (That Are True)&quot;, a feature-length documentary written and presented by Phillips and co-produced by Pepper Productions and Outline Productions. Phillips was invited to analyse and interpret the survey for the documentary &quot;What British Muslims Really Think&quot; aired April 2016, which followed similar themes to &quot;Things We Won&#x27;t Say About Race (That Are True)&quot; relating to exploring racial truths through statistics.

From 2021 to 2022, Phillips covered for Sophy Ridge&#x27;s Sky News Sunday morning programme &quot;Sophy Ridge on Sunday&quot; while she was on maternity leave. His programme was temporarily rebranded as &quot;Trevor Phillips on Sunday&quot;.

==Political activity==
As a student at Imperial he became president of its students&#x27; union. In 1978 he was elected president of the National Union of Students as a candidate for the Broad Left.

Phillips was chairman of the Runnymede Trust, a think-tank promoting ethnic equality, from 1993 to 1998, and a commissioner for a number of other charities. He also served as chairman of the London Arts Board. His long-standing friendship with Peter Mandelson, who worked with Phillips at LWT and was best man at his first wedding, brought him close to the New Labour project, and he became friendly with Tony Blair. Phillips joined the Labour Party in London in 1996.

In 1999 Phillips ran to be Labour&#x27;s candidate in the 2000 election for the first Mayor of London. Phillips was initially Blair&#x27;s preferred choice for the role. When Blair called for the party to swiftly unite behind one candidate, Ken Livingstone, a left-winger and favourite to win the nomination, offered to form a joint ticket with Phillips as his running mate. Phillips described Livingstone&#x27;s offer as &quot;patronising&quot; in a response that was seen as an accusation of racism, though Phillips later denied this. Following this and other controversies, including his decision to send his children to a private school, Phillips withdrew from the race a few months later and was not on the final shortlist of candidates. Instead, he accepted an offer to be running mate to Labour&#x27;s Frank Dobson.
Although Dobson won the nomination, his candidature was harmed by the perception that the contest was &quot;fixed&quot; by the use of an electoral college. Livingstone ran as an independent and won. The Labour Party designated Phillips as a member of the London Assembly on 4 May 2000 as one of its &quot;top-up&quot; candidates. Phillips served as chairman of the Assembly until February 2003, resigning his seat to take up his appointment at the Commission for Racial Equality.

In March 2020, Phillips was suspended from Labour following allegations of Islamophobia. Following the suspension, Phillips defended his comments about British Muslims on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme. The suspension was lifted in July 2021.

===Multiculturalism: disagreements with Ken Livingstone===
Phillips and Livingstone had a frosty relationship throughout Phillips&#x27;s time on the London Assembly, and Phillips&#x27;s opposition to multiculturalism saw them clash time and again during his tenure at the CRE. In a &quot;Times&quot; interview in April 2004, Phillips said the government should stop supporting multiculturalism, saying it was out of date and legitimised &quot;separateness&quot; between communities, and instead should &quot;assert a core of Britishness&quot;.

In 2006, Livingstone accused Phillips of &quot;pandering to the right&quot; so much that he &quot;would soon join the BNP&quot;. Phillips replied that his views had been &quot;well documented&quot; and &quot;well supported&quot;. Phillips has made speeches stating that &quot;it was right to ask hard questions about multicultural Britain&quot;. Although he apologised for his presentation of research by the Australian academic Michael Poulsen of statistics on levels of segregation, which had led to some controversy, he welcomed the focus on integration of different communities after the launch of A Commission for Integration and Cohesion. Phillips subsequently cited later work by, among others, Professor Eric Kaufmann of Birkbeck College, London University, showing that white and non-white segregation in London and Birmingham increased during the census period to 2011.

After the 2005 riots in France, Phillips warned that &quot;inequality, race and powerlessness&quot; can be &quot;incendiary&quot;. He was invited to advise the French government and in September 2007 was made a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur.

Phillips wrote in May 2016: &quot;Rome may not yet be in flames, but I think I can smell the smouldering whilst we hum to the music of liberal self-delusion&quot; by ignoring the effects of mass immigration to the United Kingdom, explicitly comparing his warning to Enoch Powell&#x27;s 1968 &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech.

===Views on free speech===
Phillips has spoken on the need for free speech to &quot;allow people to offend each other&quot;. These comments came after the protests against the Danish cartoons satirising the Islamic prophet Muhammad, which sparked protests in the Muslim community. He stated in an ITV interview: &quot;One point of Britishness is that people can say what they like about the way we should live, however absurd, however unpopular it is.&quot;

While supporting free speech, Phillips has spoken out against providing the far right with a platform. Discussing the Oxford Union&#x27;s invitation to BNP leader Nick Griffin and Holocaust denier David Irving, he told the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Andrew Marr Show&quot;: &quot;As a former president of the National Union of Students, I&#x27;m ashamed that this has happened. This is not a question of freedom of speech, this is a juvenile provocation.&quot; Griffin has since hit back at Phillips by declaring him a &quot;black racist&quot; in an interview given to Channel 4.

===Opposition to 42-day detention===
In early June 2008 Phillips as EHRC head said that he &quot;remain[ed] unpersuaded that the government has yet provided compelling evidence for what our legal advice shows would be an effective suspension of some human rights&quot;. Phillips was responding to the growing uproar surrounding proposals to amend counter-terrorism legislation to permit 42 days&#x27; detention without charge. He raised the possibility of the EHRC legally testing the legislation by judicial review. In the event, the Brown government maintained the limit on detention without charge at 28 days (although in practice a 14-day limit was observed). Following the installation of a Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government, the limit was in January 2011 allowed to revert to 14 days.

===Views on Islam===
In 1996 Phillips initiated and sat on the Runnymede Trust&#x27;s Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia, whose report &quot;Islamophobia: a challenge for us all&quot; reviewed the state of anti-Muslim prejudice in the UK. The report helped establish the term &quot;Islamophobia&quot; in UK discourse and it noted that abuse against Muslims was often racialised therefore &quot;a legal term such as ‘religious and racial violence’ is required&quot;. It also stated that Islamophobia stemmed from closed views seeing British Muslims as monolithic, separate, and different.

The Commission&#x27;s proposals were in part implemented in UK legislation in the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 and the Equality Act 2010, both of which he influenced as Chair of the EHRC. Phillips later developed his views and in 2016, as part of his Channel 4 documentary &quot;What British Muslims Really Think&quot;, he said that the commission had correctly recognised the existence of incidents of abuse against British Muslims &quot;but we got almost everything else wrong&quot;. Phillips&#x27;s own analysis for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; asserted that the reference to the creation of a &quot;nation within a nation&quot; is not to Muslims as a whole, but to a significant minority and that the documentary acknowledged the diversity among British Muslims.

He went on to say that far from suggesting that Muslims as a group are in some way at fault, he questioned whether the rest of Britain needed to re-examine its own norms and behaviours.

Responses to the documentary were mixed. In &quot;The Spectator&quot;, political commentator Douglas Murray praised Phillips&#x27;s ability to &quot;break taboos which too many liberals in the UK are keen to continue enforcing&quot;, calling Islamophobia a &quot;fraudulent concept&quot;, while his colleague James Delingpole said it was a &quot;brave and honest programme&quot;, and the British public knew &quot;large numbers of Muslims don&#x27;t want to integrate, that their views aren&#x27;t remotely enlightened&quot;. Simon Woolley, founder of Operation Black Vote, said the documentary pandered to prejudice, treated Muslims as a monolithic group and gave &quot;no historical or social/political context&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Middle East Eye&quot;, Peter Oborne said Phillips had employed a double standard to attack social conservatism by comparing British Muslim views against Britain as a whole, rather than against other UK religious groups. In terms of views on homosexuality, religious devotion, and the role of women, Oborne said &quot;Phillips could have carried out a similar poll of Conservative Party activists, of Roman Catholics, of orthodox Jews, or many other religious minorities and come up with something roughly similar.&quot;

In August 2017, following the conviction of 17 men and one woman in Newcastle for child sex abuse offences Phillips wrote that the description of the men as simply &quot;Asian&quot; was an injustice to the majority of the UK&#x27;s Asian population, including many Muslims. A Home Office report subsequently showed child sexual abuse gangs were typically divided on race lines, but more widely that the majority of child sex offenders were made up of white men under the age of 30.

Phillips was suspended from the Labour Party pending investigation into alleged Islamophobia based on his past statements, a move which he called &quot;Corbynista payback&quot; and &quot;pure political gangsterism&quot;. Labour MP Khalid Mahmood defended Phillips saying the &quot;charges are so outlandish as to bring disrepute on all involved in making them&quot;. Phillips defended his statements on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, reiterating his view that Muslims should not be treated as a racial group and saying &quot;Muslims are different, and in many ways I think that’s admirable&quot;. Asked about his generalisations about British Muslims he said &quot;if you do belong to a group...you identify with a particular set of values, and you stand for it. And frankly you are judged by that&quot;. Conservative Member of the House of Lords Sayeeda Warsi responded that &quot;Phillips cannot treat Muslims as a homogenised group when it suits him, then later deny they are racialised&quot;.

Phillips has pointed out that his actual remarks were reported by &quot;The Times&quot; on 27 January 2016.

Phillips&#x27;s suspension from the Labour Party was lifted in June 2021, though investigations had not concluded.

==Boards and appointments==
Phillips is chairman of Green Park Interim and Executive Recruitment, director of WebberPhillips, a data analytics provider. He was the cofounder and director of Pepper Productions, an independent television production company, now dormant following the demise of co-founder Charles Armitage. He has been a member of the board of the Barbican Arts Centre, the Council of Aldeburgh Music, and a trustee of the Social Mobility Foundation, among other charities.

===Equality and Human Rights Commission===
Phillips became head of the Commission for Racial Equality in 2003, and on its abolition in 2006 was appointed full-time chairman of its successor, the EHRC (initially called the Commission for Equality and Human Rights), which had a broader remit of combating discrimination and promoting equality across other grounds (age, disability, gender, race, religion and belief, sexual orientation and gender reassignment). The EHRC also had the role of promoting and defending human rights, and secured recognition as the national human rights institution for England and Wales (alongside separate commissions in Northern Ireland and Scotland). Phillips&#x27;s tenure as EHRC chairman (which at his request became a part-time position in 2009) was at times controversial.

Phillips&#x27;s tenure as EHRC chairman is the longest for any individual in any similar position in the UK. It was said to be dogged by controversies and internal dissent. Under his leadership, six of the body&#x27;s commissioners departed after expressing concerns about his leadership and probity and others were reported to be considering their position. However, they were replaced and Phillips later completed his term in September 2012.

In 2010 Phillips was investigated regarding alleged attempts to influence a Parliamentary committee (the Joint Committee on Human Rights) writing a report on him. He would have been the first non-politician in over half a century to be convicted of contempt of Parliament, but the Lords Committee found that the allegations were &quot;subjective, and that no firm factual evidence is presented in their support; nor are they borne out by the submissions by individual members of the JCHR.&quot; He was cleared of contempt of Parliament and the House of Lords recommended that new and clearer guidance about the conduct of witnesses to Select Committees be issued. However, he was told his behaviour was &quot;inappropriate and ill-advised&quot;.

Phillips completed his second term of office in September 2012, which, together with his term at the CRE made him the longest serving leader of any UK equality commission.

In 2006 Phillips said that Britain&#x27;s current approach to multiculturalism could cause Britain to &quot;sleepwalk towards segregation&quot;. He expanded on these views in 2016 in a publication by Civitas entitled &quot;Race and Faith: the Deafening Silence&quot;, in which he said that &quot;squeamishness about addressing diversity and its discontents risks allowing our country to sleepwalk to a catastrophe that will set community against community, endorse sexist aggression, suppress freedom of expression, reverse hard-won civil liberties, and undermine the liberal democracy that has served this country so well for so long.&quot;

==Comparisons between Britain and the United States==
In an article published in 2003, Phillips stated that &quot;from Rome, through Constantinople to Venice and London, our (European) nations have a history of peacefully absorbing huge, diverse movements of people, driven by war, famine and persecution; and there is no history of long-term ethnic segregation of the kind one can see in any US city&quot;.

In a March 2008 article for &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine, Phillips supported Barack Obama as a potential Presidential candidate, and speculated that if he did become President it might &quot;postpone the arrival of a post-racial America&quot;. Following Obama&#x27;s election, in an interview for &quot;The Times&quot; on 8 November 2008, Phillips said that he believed it would be impossible for a black candidate in the United Kingdom to rise to the top in politics because of institutional racism within the Labour Party, saying:
If Barack Obama had lived here I would be very surprised if even somebody as brilliant as him would have been able to break through the institutional stranglehold that there is on power within the Labour party.

The comments received support and criticism from members of ethnic communities in the UK.

==Honours==
Phillips was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1999 New Year Honours for services to broadcast journalism.

He received a knighthood in the 2022 New Year Honours in recognition of his services to equality and human rights.

In 2007, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Loughborough University.

==Personal life==
Phillips married Asha Bhownagary, a Parsi child psychotherapist with Indian ancestry, in 1981 and they had two daughters, one of whom, Sushila, died in April 2021 due to anorexia.

<text>Reginald McKenna (6 July 1863 – 6 September 1943) was a British banker and Liberal politician. His first Cabinet post under Henry Campbell-Bannerman was as President of the Board of Education, after which he served as First Lord of the Admiralty. His most important roles were as Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer during the premiership of H. H. Asquith. He was studious and meticulous, noted for his attention to detail, but also for being bureaucratic and partisan.

==Background and education==
Born in Kensington, London, McKenna was the son of William Columban McKenna and his wife Emma, daughter of Charles Hanby. Sir Joseph Neale McKenna was his uncle. McKenna was educated at King&#x27;s College School and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. At Cambridge he was a notable rower. In 1886, he was a member of the Trinity Hall Boat Club eight that won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta. He rowed bow in the winning Cambridge boat in the 1887 Boat Race. Also in 1887 he was a member of the Trinity Hall coxless four that won the Stewards&#x27; Challenge Cup at Henley.

==Political career==
McKenna was elected at the 1895 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for North Monmouthshire. McKenna was a Liberal Imperialist. After the Khaki Election of 1900, he favoured the return to government of former Liberal Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, although this did not happen.
In December 1905 McKenna was appointed, in preference to Winston Churchill, as Financial Secretary to the Treasury. He then served in the Liberal Cabinets of Campbell-Bannerman and Asquith as President of the Board of Education, First Lord of the Admiralty (1908–11), and Home Secretary.

He was considered methodical and efficient, but his opponents thought him priggish, prissy and lacking in charisma. McKenna&#x27;s estimates were submitted to unprecedented scrutiny by the &#x27;economists&#x27; David Lloyd George and Churchill. McKenna submitted large naval estimates in December 1908 for the financial year 1909-1910 of £36,000,000. This was the Dreadnought building programme inspired by naval reformer Admiral Fisher.

In 1907 James Bryce was appointed Ambassador to the US, Augustine Birrell replaced him as Chief Secretary for Ireland, and McKenna succeeded Birrell as President of the Board of Education. He was responsible for such reforms as the introduction of free places in secondary schools and the bestowing upon local authorities the powers to deal with the health and physical needs of children, and was promoted to the cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty only a year later.

=== First Lord ===

At the Admiralty McKenna started the Labour Exchange Bill from May 1909, a policy later associated with Churchill, in an effort to relieve unemployment. He was increasingly attacked in speeches outside Parliament. The number of Dreadnoughts to be built was increased from six to eight ships; four initially and four later. Lloyd George and Churchill had attacked McKenna&#x27;s position in a plan to persuade the Liberal left of the need for defence cuts. Nonetheless McKenna was on the Cabinet finance committee that discussed Lloyd George&#x27;s budget proposal of 7 March 1910, and on 12 April refused to contemplate the chancellor&#x27;s proposed defence cuts.

He held his seat in the General Elections of 1910, and kept his post at the Admiralty in Asquith&#x27;s government. McKenna had attended the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID) on 17 December 1908 and 23 March 1909, during which periods he had fully comprehended the gravity of the naval threat. He also attended the famous meeting on 23 August 1911, chaired by the Prime Minister, at which Brigadier-General Wilson, over naval opposition, persuaded ministers to deploy an expeditionary force to France in the event of war. Asquith dismissed the Royal Navy&#x27;s war plans as &quot;wholly impracticable&quot;.

McKenna had little support in Cabinet, and Asquith, Richard Haldane, and Churchill wanted the latter to replace him at the Admiralty. Fortunately war was averted despite the Agadir Crisis. On 16 November McKenna accepted the Home Office, swapping jobs with Churchill.

In total McKenna had &#x27;laid the keels&#x27; of 18 new battleships that contributed mightily to the British fleet that would fight at the Battle of Jutland in 1916. McKenna commenced the Dreadnought Arms Race: the fundamental strategic basis was for a vast fleet, large enough to intimidate Germany to decline to fight. But in the event Britain&#x27;s advantage was ephemeral and fleeting.

=== Peacetime Home Secretary ===
McKenna accepted his move to the Home Office in October 1911 partly because he had recovered from an appendicitis operation. He was one of numerous Cabinet appointments at the time which, according to historian Duncan Tanner, &quot;pushed the (Liberal) party still further to the left&quot;. McKenna and Charles Hobhouse were responsible for the Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill finally drafted on 20 February 1912. The &quot;ODNB&quot; calls him a wise and judicious Home Secretary. He was stolidly opposed by the Conservative F.E.Smith.

Another piece of legislation ensued in the Coal Mines Bill regulating pay and conditions. McKenna enthusiastically supported the minimum wage bill in principle, but partly to prevent &#x27;civil war&#x27; in the coalfields. With Asquith&#x27;s approval McKenna left a Cabinet meeting, at which he was on the majority side, to attend on the King, having left behind an &quot;admirable memo.&quot;

Throughout the summer of 1912 he opposed the escalation of the naval race, occasioned by Churchill&#x27;s plan to build a new Mediterranean fleet.

He opposed a Temperance Bill. He also made a radical proposal to let prisoners out on short licence (the Cat and Mouse Act), which he sponsored to deal with militant suffragists, a bill unanimously approved by cabinet.On 13 March 1913 he voted against compulsory military training.

At a &quot;council of war&quot; with Lloyd George on 13 June, McKenna was left in no doubt that Asquith had refused the chancellor&#x27;s resignation over the Marconi scandal. McKenna himself was categorical as to their innocence of the share dealings. This advice may have saved the Welsh Wizard&#x27;s career. He made it clear that the Government could not secure any contracts for favours whether from Marconi or Lord Cowdray.

With Irish parentage in his own family, McKenna was happy to support the half-cash, half-stock scheme on 16 July for the Irish Purchase Act introduced by Augustine Birrell, as the prospect for Irish Home Rule drew ever nearer. Dublin was in turmoil, to McKenna and others on the Left (Walter Runciman, Charles Hobhouse, and John Burns) it was as much Edward Carson&#x27;s fault as James Larkin&#x27;s.

McKenna blamed Churchill for stirring up the Northcliffe press against the cabinet&#x27;s plans to boost the army&#x27;s budget by £800,000 and a proposed increase of £6 million in the Royal Navy&#x27;s bi-annual estimate. In the new year McKenna was one of Lloyd George&#x27;s group to analyse Churchill&#x27;s plans for Dreadnought construction; they insisted that expenditure must be reduced to that of 1912–13.

In late January 1914 his friends Charles Hobhouse and Sir John Simon agreed to lobby the Chancellor. The following day at the Treasury their &quot;entire sitting was taken up&quot; by the group&#x27;s tirade against Churchill&#x27;s management of the Admiralty. They retired the next morning to Smith Square to discuss the Home Rule crisis in Ireland; a dissolution &quot;would be a complete practical triumph for the Tory Party&quot;, wrote Hobhouse; their group was expanded to include Beauchamp and Runciman. On 29 January the group sent a petition to Asquith protesting against the Naval Estimates, now assumed to total £52.5 million.

McKenna had been receiving messages of grave concern from Irish leader John Redmond. On 17 July, before the weekend, McKenna proposed an Amending Bill to the Government of Ireland Bill to allow any Ulster county to opt out of Home Rule.

=== Wartime Home Secretary ===
The problems of Ireland paled into insignificance in early August. Broadly-speaking McKenna, an Asquithian, supported the pledge to go to war to defend Belgium&#x27;s neutrality, but he did not want to send the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Charles Masterman, Runciman and McKenna all wanted to stall the Kaiser for invaluable time. Most of the cabinet opposed armed intervention in France, almost up until the declaration of war.

The Home Secretary remained in charge of State Security: more than 6,000 espionage cases were investigated, none of which produced any traitors. The smuggling of German arms during the Irish Home Rule Crisis had sparked fears that Britain was infiltrated by a network of spies. In response cable telegraphs were laid from Dartmouth to Brest in Brittany to guarantee Allied communications links. On 20 October a warrant went out for the arrest of 23,000 Germanic aliens, and food supplies to Belgium were cut lest they fell into German hands. McKenna refused to allow the publication of the sinking of HMS &quot;Audacious&quot;; in the event it was &#x27;leaked&#x27; to &quot;The Evening News&quot; anyway. And on 30 October the Cabinet announced a general policy of censorship. In the &quot;Wilhelmina&quot; case he again referred to the legal situation, seeking a solution in international law.

McKenna disliked the autocratic and dismissive Lord Kitchener, appointed Secretary of State for War at the start of the war. Immediately on his appointment their relations soured: the policy of voluntary recruitment continued as the Army needed one million men, until the Adjutant-General complained there were too many new recruits. On 5 March 1915 McKenna reported that the Ritz Carlton Hotel, New York was being used as a spy network to inform on British intelligence; the government, determined to prevent the USA entering the war on Germany&#x27;s side, informed Washington. McKenna supported Asquith and gradually fell out with Lloyd George.

Internal wrangling in Cabinet conversations reached fever pitch: Edwin Montagu, a cousin of Herbert Samuel and ally of Lloyd George suggested that Asquith was jealous of Sir Edward Grey&#x27;s prowess in the Foreign Office. When in April 1915 the Home Secretary banned Montagu from his home for six months, the scene was set for a final split in the party. McKenna was a Teetotaller, something he had impressed upon the King was necessary for good government. His Majesty &quot;took the pledge&quot; for the duration of the war, an example which Lord Chancellor Haldane felt he had to follow for the remainder of his time in office.

=== Asquith&#x27;s Liberal Chancellor ===
In May 1915 Asquith formed a coalition government. McKenna, a reluctant coalitionist, became Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the meantime, McKenna oversaw the issue of the Second War Loan in June 1915, at an interest rate of 4.5%, although his first budget was actually on 21 September 1915 was a serious attempt to deal with an impending debt crisis. Revenues were rising, but not by enough to cover the £1.6 billion government expenditure. McKenna increased income tax rates and introduced a 50% excess profit tax, and increases in indirect taxation of goods such as tea, coffee, and tobacco. Post Office charge increases could not be included in the Budget (as they would have endangered its status as a money bill), and were instead introduced in a Post Office and Telegraph Bill.

=== McKenna duties ===
In September 1915, he introduced a 33% levy on luxury imports in order to fund the war effort. At first this excluded commercial vehicles, which were needed for war transportation. The tax, which became known as the &quot;McKenna Duties&quot;, was intended to be temporary but lasted for 41 years until it was finally axed in 1956. It was briefly waived between August 1924 and June 1925, and then extended on 1 May 1926 to cover commercial vehicles.

=== Fiscal relations and Lloyd George ===
The April 1916 budget saw further large rises in income and excess profit taxes, at a time when prices of basic food commodities were rising. Sales taxes were extended to rail tickets, mineral water, cider and perry, and entertainments. The government pledged that if they issued War Loan at the even higher interest (as they did with the 5% issue of 1917), holders of the 4.5% bonds might also convert to the new rate. His predecessor David Lloyd George criticised McKenna in his memoirs for increasing the interest rate from 3.5% on the 1914 War Loan at a time when investors had few alternatives and might even have had their capital &quot;conscripted&quot; by the government. Not only did the change ultimately increase the nation&#x27;s interest payments by £100 million/year but it meant rates were higher throughout the economy during the post-war depression. Compared with France, the British government relied more on short-term financing in the form of treasury bills and exchequer bonds during World War I; Treasury bills provided the bulk of British government funds in 1916. McKenna fell out with Lord Cunliffe, Governor of the Bank of England. Furthermore, he tried to sequestrate the assets of the US Prudential Assurance Company to pay for American war &quot;materiel&quot; purchases.

An opponent of Lloyd George, McKenna was critical of the Prime Minister&#x27;s political approach, telling Conservative politician Arthur Balfour that &quot;you disagree with us, but you can understand our principles. Lloyd George doesn&#x27;t understand them and we can&#x27;t make him&quot;. But unlike McKenna, Lloyd George had no problem with relations with Cunliffe.

McKenna nevertheless saw the state as having an important role in society, a sentiment that he shared with Asquith. As noted by his biographer and nephew, Stephen McKenna,

Without trying to define the whole duty of Liberal man, Asquith and McKenna were at one in seeing that if certain services were not undertaken by the state, they would not be undertaken at all. Old age pensions were a case in point. They had not been dangled as an electioneering bait; Asquith made no appeal to sentiment or emotion when the Cabinet committee of investigation was set up, but from their first days together at the Treasury he and McKenna had agreed that, if the money could be found, this was a matter on which a beginning must be made forthwith.

=== Conscription ===
The issue of enforced service in the armed forces was controversial in Britain. The Conservatives were almost entirely in favour, but the Liberals were split, with Asquithians largely opposed on libertarian grounds, whilst Lloyd George united with the Tories in what he declared to be a vital national interest. Sir John Simon, Liberal Home Secretary and an ally of McKenna, resigned over the conscription of bachelors in January 1916. As Chancellor of Exchequer McKenna objected to the conscription of married men in May 1916 on purely economic grounds, arguing that it would &#x27;deplete&#x27; Britain&#x27;s war industries. McKenna knew that for Asquith to remain in office he had to move towards conscription, whether he liked it or not; if he did not, the Tories would topple the government.

At a decisive meeting on 4 December 1916 McKenna tried to persuade Asquith to sack Lloyd George to save the government. McKenna retired into opposition upon the fall of Asquith at the end of 1916.

===Chairman of the Midland Bank===
He lost his seat in the 1918 general election and became a non-executive member of the board of the Midland Bank at the invitation of the chairman, Liberal MP Sir Edward Holden. Before Holden died in 1919, McKenna had sat in his office every day to observe the activities of a chairman. An elaborate coda was drafted to allow the bank&#x27;s directors to determine whether he should resign his Pontypool seat where he was presently the Liberal candidate (his previous seat of North Monmouthshire had disappeared in boundary changes). But the situation did not arise as he was not elected in 1922. The new Prime Minister Bonar Law hoped to persuade him to come out of retirement and serve once again at the Exchequer in a Conservative Cabinet, but he refused, and remained in private life. His refusal was partly because he wanted to promote an alliance between Bonar Law and Asquith, who was still official leader of the Liberal Party. The following year Bonar Law&#x27;s successor Stanley Baldwin repeated the request and McKenna was more agreeable, but again declined.

McKenna used his status as chairman of one of the big five British banks to argue that monetary policy could be used to achieve domestic macroeconomic objectives. At the Chamberlain-Bradbury committee he questioned whether a return to the gold standard was desirable. John Maynard Keynes was the only other witness to do so, although others proposed a delayed return.

=== Possible return to government ===

According to Lord Birkenhead, Lloyd George&#x27;s Liberals were of poor intellect, with no great leaders to take the government onwards. McKenna was certainly a technocrat but did not want to be Prime Minister although he might conceivably have been offered the post. In reality, the Conservatives wanted one of their own. However, he wished to enter Parliament in July 1923 as MP for the City of London, and neither of the incumbent MPs would agree to vacate in order to make room. As a result, McKenna declined, as he had no wish to vacate the bank. McKenna continued to write economic reports for Whitehall and Westminster, but by August 1923, his political career had come to an end.

The lasting impression was one of the pin-striped merchant banker, a model of precision but not a clubbable leader of men; his absence from London society and Brooks&#x27;s seemed to imply retirement. However, his financial reputation was such as to prompt Stanley Baldwin to demand his return to government in the 1930s. As late as 1939, it was proposed that he should be brought back to replace Liberal National Chancellor Sir John Simon. McKenna was the last of the Asquithians to die, in 1943.

==Family==
McKenna was married in 1908 to Pamela Jekyll (who died November 1943), younger daughter of Sir Herbert Jekyll (brother of landscape gardener Gertrude Jekyll) and his wife Dame Agnes Jekyll, née Graham. They had two sons – Michael (died 1931) and David, who married Lady Cecilia Elizabeth Keppel (12 April 1910 – 16 June 2003), a daughter of Walter Keppel, 9th Earl of Albemarle in 1934. McKenna was a talented financier, and a champion bridge player in his free time. In royal company at Balmoral McKenna played golf.

Reginald McKenna died in London on 6 September 1943, and was buried at St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Mells, Somerset. His wife died two months later, and is buried beside him. McKenna was a regular client of Sir Edwin Lutyens who designed the Midland Bank headquarters in Poultry, London, and several branches. Pamela McKenna was a high society hostess whose dinner parties charmed Asquith at their Lutyens-built townhouse, Mulberry House in Smith Square. Lutyens the unofficial imperial-government architect built several homes for McKenna, and the political classes, as well as his grave. Lutyens was commissioned to build Mulberry House, 36 Smith Square in 1911, followed by Park House in Mells Park, Somerset, built in 1925. The owners of Mells Park were Sir John Horner and his wife Frances, née Graham, who was Agnes Jekyll&#x27;s sister, and they agreed to let the park to McKenna for a nominal rent, on the understanding that he would rebuild the house. Lutyens built a final house for McKenna at Halnaker Park, in Halnaker, Sussex, in 1938. Lutyens designed the McKenna family tomb in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Mells, in 1932.

His nephew Stephen McKenna was a popular novelist who published a biography of his uncle in 1948.

<doc id="601162" wikidata="Q1241043" url="?curid=601162" title="Robert Horne, 1st Viscount Horne of Slamannan">
<text>Robert Stevenson Horne, 1st Viscount Horne of Slamannan (28 February 18713 September 1940) was a Scottish businessman, advocate and Unionist politician. He served under David Lloyd George as Minister of Labour between 1919 and 1920, as President of the Board of Trade between 1920 and 1921 and as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1921 and 1922. In 1937 he was ennobled as Viscount Horne of Slamannan.

==Background and education==
Horne was born at Slamannan, Stirlingshire, the son of Reverend Robert Stevenson Horne, the village&#x27;s Church of Scotland minister, and Mary, daughter of Thomas Lockhead. He was educated at George Watson&#x27;s College in Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow, where he studied Law and was President of the Students&#x27; Representative Council.

==Career until 1918==
Horne then spent a year teaching philosophy at the University College of North Wales, before being elected to the Faculty of Advocates (Scottish Bar) in 1896. He became a successful advocate, specialising in commercial and shipping cases, and became a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1910. He also served as Examiner in Philosophy (1896–1900) and Rector (1921–1924) at the University of Aberdeen. He was a board member of several companies including directorships of the Suez Canal Company, chairman of the Great Western Railway Company and director of several other companies and banks.

During the First World War, Horne became Director of Railways on the Western Front with the honorary rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Engineers. In 1917 he joined the Admiralty as Assistant Inspector-General of Transportation, becoming Director of Materials and Priority in 1918, and Director of Labour and Third Civil Lord later the same year.

==Political career==
Having unsuccessfully stood for Stirlingshire in both general elections of 1910, Horne was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Hillhead in 1918. He served under David Lloyd George as Minister of Labour between 1919 and 1920, as President of the Board of Trade between 1920 and 1921 and as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1921 and 1922. It was in that capacity that he was involved in the negotiations leading to the signing of the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement. Leonid Krasin pressurised Horne to support the treaty by threatening to cancel orders with textile mills in Yorkshire, as only the mills with Soviet orders were working full-time. When the treaty was signed, it was the first recognition by Britain of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

When the Lloyd George Coalition Government fell in 1922, Horne refused to join the new government of Bonar Law. Two years later, Stanley Baldwin offered to make Horne Minister of Labour once more, but Horne declined, preferring to concentrate on work in the City. Although he remained a Member of Parliament until 1937, he never again held ministerial office. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1918 for his war services, and raised to Knight Grand Cross (GBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours for his services as Minister of Labour. In 1919, he was also sworn of the Privy Council. He was ennobled as Viscount Horne of Slamannan, of Slamannan in the County of Stirling, on 9 June 1937.

==Personal life==
Horne, a womanising bachelor, was famously referred to by Baldwin as a &quot;Scots cad&quot;, a remark that has stuck. He died in September 1940, aged 69. The viscountcy became extinct with his death.

<text>The DAR 10 (ДАР 10) was a Bulgarian light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. DAR-10 was designed for horizontal and dive bombing, reconnaissance, and ground attack.

==Design and development==
The DAR 10 was designed by Zvetan Lazarov in 1938 in the DAR (&quot;Darzhavna Aeroplanna Rabotilnitsa&quot;, meaning literally &#x27;State Airplane Workshop&#x27;) factory in Bozhurishte, near the capital Sofia.

The DAR 10 was a single-engine two-seat (pilot and gunner) low-wing cantilever monoplane aircraft of conventional layout. Its two seats were in tandem under enclosed glazing. Its tailwheel undercarriage was fixed, and the mainwheels were spatted. The wings had a wooden structure, covered with plywood. Flaps were not used.

The fuselage was comparatively wide and deep, to accommodate the nose-mounted radial engine. It was constructed of steel-tube framework and wood formers, covered with fabric.

Three-bladed steel propellers were used.

Two prototypes were built, powered by different engines:
*DAR 10A &quot;Bekas&quot; (Bulgarian: &quot;snipe&quot;), powered by an Alfa Romeo 128 R.C.21 nine-cylinder radial engine rated at 950 hp (709 kW). This was the first DAR 10 to fly, on 2 July 1941. It was designed to carry four machine guns (two fixed forward-firing and two in rear gunner position). It could carry five 100-kg bombs, mounted under the wings. There was also the possibility of a fixed 20 mm forward-firing cannon installation in the forward fuselage.

This aircraft crashed in October 1942. In spite of good flight reviews, the type was not chosen for production. The high-wing KB-11 Fazan was selected for production instead.

*DAR 10F (the &quot;F&quot; to indicate its Fiat engine), powered by a Fiat A 74 R.C.38 14-cylinder radial engine rated at 870 hp (649 kW). This aircraft first flew in March 1945. It was slightly heavier and longer than the DAR-10A. Its top speed was 454 km/h (282 mph). Thanks to a stronger construction and dive brakes, it could serve also as a dive bomber. It could be equipped with two fixed fuselage-mounted 20 mm cannon firing forward, two fixed wing-mounted machine guns, and two machine guns for the gunner. It could carry one 500 kg (1,100 lb) bomb or one 250 kg (551 lb) and four 100 kg (110 lb). The bombs were mounted under the fuselage and wings.

The DAR-10 was not selected for production. Some sources suggest that it was passed over in favor of the German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber, while the improved DAR-10F was not selected as World War II had ended and Bulgaria had access to ample supplies of modern Soviet aircraft such as the Ilyushin Il-2 and Il-10.

<text>Rumex crispus, the curly dock, curled dock or yellow dock, is a perennial flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae, native to Europe and Western Asia.

== Description ==
The plant produces an inflorescence or flower stalk that grows to high. It has smooth leaves shooting off from a large basal rosette, with distinctive waved or curled edges; these can grow to . On the stalk, flowers and seeds are produced in clusters on branched stems, with the largest cluster being found at the apex. The seeds are shiny, brown and encased in the calyx of the flower that produced them. This casing enables the seeds to float on water and get caught in wool and animal fur, and this helps the seeds spread to new locations. The root structure is a large, yellow, forking taproot.

&quot;Rumex crispus&quot; has a number of subspecies with distinctive habitat preferences. &quot;R. crispus&quot; ssp. &quot;crispus&quot; occurs on waste and cultivated ground. &quot;R. crispus&quot; ssp. &quot;littoreus&quot; has a coastal distribution, and &quot;R. crispus&quot; ssp. &quot;uliginosus&quot; occurs on tidal estuarine mud. The species hybridizes readily with other &quot;Rumex&quot; species including &quot;Rumex obtusifolius&quot;, &quot;Rumex obovatus&quot;, &quot;Rumex palustris&quot; and &quot;Rumex maritimus&quot;.

==Distribution==
Native across temperate Eurasia, and widespread as an introduced species in North America and other temperate regions.

== Ecology ==
Curly dock grows in a wide variety of habitats, including disturbed soil, waste areas, roadsides, fields/meadows, shorelines, and forest edges.
It is widely naturalised throughout the temperate world and has become a serious invasive species in many areas, including throughout North America, southern South America, New Zealand and parts of Australia. It spreads through the seeds contaminating crop seeds, and sticking to clothing. It is classified as an &quot;injurious weed&quot; under the UK Weeds Act 1959. In the United States, it is classified as a noxious weed in the states of Arkansas and Iowa. It is often seen in disturbed soils at the edges of roadsides, railway beds, and car parks.

=== Host plant ===
The curled dock is an optimal host plant for certain Lepidoptera species including, &quot;Agrotis ipsilon&quot; (black cutworm). Adult moths oviposit on these dense, low-lying leaves during the spring/summer season.

== Uses and toxicity ==
It can be used as a wild leaf vegetable; the young leaves should be boiled in several changes of water to remove as much of the oxalic acid in the leaves as possible or can be added directly to salads in moderate amounts. Once the plant matures it becomes too bitter to consume. Dock leaves are an excellent source of both vitamin A and vitamin C, as well as a source of iron and potassium. Curly Dock leaves are somewhat tart due to the presence of high levels of oxalic acid, and although quite palatable, this plant should only be consumed in moderation as it can irritate the urinary tract and increase the risk of developing kidney stones. It should be used with care during lactation, as it may cause a laxative effect in the infant.

In Armenia the young plants are harvested and dried and to make a product called Aveluk (ավելուկ). During drying fermentation takes place to make it less bitter. The dried plants are braided into rings and sold. Aveluk is used extensively in Armenian cookery as the basis of salads and soups for which it is reconstituted by boiling in water. 

The seeds of the yellow dock, once dried thoroughly, are edible as well. The dark-brown to black seed pods remain on the stalk until the spring when leaves start growing again. While many wild foraged grains must be winnowed, the pods of &quot;Rumex crispus&quot; are small enough that it is more efficient to grind them with the grain. The resulting flour is much like buckwheat in flavor, and while some may find it too bitter, many prefer the seeds over the tartness of the leaves.

In Western herbalism, the root is often used for treating anemia, due to its high level of iron. It can be powdered and given in capsules, often in combination with stinging nettle (&quot;Urtica dioica&quot;). This is a classic combination with the plant. Both the leaves and root may be laxative in some individuals, though not in all, and generally it is mild. This is due to the presence of anthroquinone glycosides, and is not an action that should be relied upon, but seen as a possible effect of the plant when taken. The plant may also cause intestinal discomfort to some people. The plant will help with skin conditions if taken internally or applied externally to things like itching, scrofula, and sores. Some studies show that certain anthroquinones can help stop or slow cancer growth, but this may or may not apply to the ones in yellow dock.

Yellow dock is part of the homeopathic pharmacopoeia. It is used mainly for respiratory conditions, specifically those with a tickling cough that is worse when exposed to cold air. It mentions also passing pains, excessive itching, and that it helps enlarged lymphs.

The Zuni people apply a poultice of the powdered root to sores, rashes and skin infections, and use infusion of the root for athlete&#x27;s foot.

<doc id="601182" wikidata="Q4560879" url="?curid=601182" title="1920 Republican National Convention">
<text>The 1920 Republican National Convention nominated Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding for president and Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge for vice president. The convention was held in Chicago, Illinois, at the Chicago Coliseum from June 8 to June 12, 1920, with 940 delegates. Under convention rules, a majority plus one, or at least 471 of the 940 delegates, was necessary for a nomination.

Many Republicans sought the presidential nomination, including General Leonard Wood, Illinois Governor Frank Lowden and California Senator Hiram Johnson. Dark horse Harding, however, was nominated. Many wanted to nominate Wisconsin Senator Irvine L. Lenroot for vice president, but Coolidge was nominated instead, because he was known for his response to the Boston Police Strike in 1919.

The convention also adopted a platform opposed to the accession of the United States to the League of Nations. The plank was carefully drawn up by Henry Cabot Lodge to appease opponents of the League such as Johnson, while still allowing eventual American entry into the League.

* William Howard Taft, former President of the United States
* James E. Watson, U.S. senator from Indiana
* Frank B. Willis, former Governor of Ohio

At the start of the convention, the race was wide open. General Leonard Wood, Illinois Governor Frank Lowden, and California Senator Hiram Johnson were considered the three most likely nominees. Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding had been a front-runner, but his star had faded by the time of the convention. Many expected a dark horse to be chosen, such as Pennsylvania Governor William Cameron Sproul, Pennsylvania Senator Philander C. Knox, Kansas Governor Henry Justin Allen, Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, or 1916 nominee Charles Evans Hughes. Sproul in particular had been gaining momentum at the expense of Lowden, the candidate of the conservative wing of the party. The issue of joining the League of Nations took center stage at the convention, with some speculating that Johnson would bolt the party if the platform endorsed the League. The convention adjourned for the night after four ballots produced no clear leader, and many states stuck to favorite-son candidates.
As the balloting continued the next day, Wood, Lowden, and Johnson remained in the lead, and party leaders worked to find a candidate acceptable to both the progressive and conservative wings of the party. Conservatives strongly opposed Wood, while Lowden was opposed by the progressive wing of the party. Harding emerged as a moderately conservative candidate acceptable to the progressive wing of the party, and as the convention remained deadlocked, Harding emerged as a strong compromise candidate. After the eighth ballot, the convention recessed. During the recess, Harding&#x27;s managers lobbied Lowden&#x27;s supporters and others to support Harding. Harding was also helped by the fact that the Democrats might nominate James M. Cox of Ohio, and Republicans did not want to give the Democrats a home state advantage in electorally critical Ohio.
Harding jumped into the lead on the ninth ballot, and clinched the nomination on the tenth ballot. Many thought that Johnson could have stopped the Harding movement by throwing his support behind Knox, who could have displaced Harding as the compromise candidate. Johnson disliked Harding&#x27;s policies and disliked Harding personally, and was friends with Knox. However, Johnson never released his supporters, and Harding took the nomination.

Presidential Balloting / 5th Day of Convention (June 12, 1920)
===The smoke-filled room===
At the time, Harding&#x27;s nomination was said to have been secured in negotiations led by party bosses George Harvey and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge in a mysterious &quot;smoke-filled room&quot; at Chicago&#x27;s Blackstone Hotel.&quot; Legend says Harry M. Daugherty, Harding&#x27;s political manager was the mastermind. After Harding&#x27;s election he became United States Attorney General. On February 11, 1920, long before the convention, Daugherty predicted:
:I don&#x27;t expect Senator Harding to be nominated on the first, second, or third ballots, but I think we can afford to take chances that about 11 minutes after two, Friday morning of the convention, when 15 or 12 weary men are sitting around a table, someone will say: &#x27;Who will we nominate?&#x27; At that decisive time, the friends of Harding will suggest him and we can well afford to abide by the result.&quot;

Daugherty&#x27;s prediction described essentially what occurred, but historians argue that Daugherty&#x27;s prediction has been given too much weight in narratives of the convention. The &quot;smoke filled room&quot; was actually a suite rented by National Chairman Will H. Hays. For six hours the leaders considered numerous alternatives, including Wood, Lowden, and Johnson. However, there were objections to all of them. Headlines in the next morning newspapers suggested intrigue. Historian Wesley M. Bagby argues, &quot;Various groups actually worked along separate lines to bring about the nomination - without combination and with very little contact.&quot; Bagby finds that the key factor in Harding&#x27;s nomination was his wide popularity among the rank and file of the delegates.

==Vice Presidential nomination==
===Vice Presidential candidates===
Before Harding was nominated, Johnson, Kansas Governor Henry Justin Allen, Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, Wisconsin Senator Irvine Lenroot, Kentucky Governor Edwin P. Morrow, and Harding himself were all seen as possible vice presidential nominees. Once the presidential nomination was finally settled, Harding and the party bosses asked Johnson to join the ticket as a progressive balance to Harding. When Johnson turned down the offer, they approached Lenroot, who accepted. However, when Illinois Senator Medill McCormick stood up to nominate Lenroot, several delegates began to shout for Coolidge. Though initially he had only been nominated after the refusal of Senator Lodge (another Massachusetts man), a groundswell of support built up for Coolidge, who won the nomination over Lenroot; historian Donald R. McCoy called it the first time since the 1880 nomination of James Garfield that &quot;the delegates had taken control of a Republican convention&quot;. Coolidge, who was not at the convention during the vice presidential nomination, agreed to join the ticket.

<doc id="601186" wikidata="Q669029" url="?curid=601186" title="Charles Ritchie, 1st Baron Ritchie of Dundee">
<text>Charles Thomson Ritchie, 1st Baron Ritchie of Dundee, (19 November 1838 – 9 January 1906) was a Scottish businessman and Conservative politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1874 until 1905 when he was raised to the peerage. He served as Home Secretary from 1900 to 1902 and as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1902 to 1903.

==Background and education==
Ritchie was born at Dundee, Scotland, the third son of Elizabeth (née Thomson), daughter of James Thomson, and William Ritchie, of Rockhill near Broughty Ferry, Forfarshire. His father was head of the firm of William Ritchie &amp; Sons, of London and Dundee, East India merchants, jute spinners and manufacturers. The Ritchie family had long been connected with the town of Dundee. His elder brother James Thomson Ritchie was Lord Mayor of London from 1903 to 1904 and was created a Baronet in 1903 (a title which became extinct on his death). Ritchie was educated at the City of London School, after which he went into the family business.

On 7 December 1858, he married Margaret Ower, daughter of Thomas Ower of Perth with whom he had three sons and seven daughters.

==Political career==

In 1874, he was returned to parliament as Conservative member for the Tower Hamlets. In 1885, he was made secretary to the Admiralty, and from 1886 to 1892 was President of the Local Government Board in Lord Salisbury&#x27;s second administration, sitting as member for St George in the East. He was responsible for the Local Government Act 1888, instituting county councils; and a large section of the Conservative party always owed him a grudge for having originated the London County Council.

In Lord Salisbury&#x27;s later ministries, as member for Croydon (1895–1906), he was President of the Board of Trade (1895–1900) and Home Secretary (1900–1902); and when Sir Michael Hicks-Beach retired in August 1902, he became Chancellor of the Exchequer in Balfour&#x27;s cabinet. In his earlier years he had been a fair-trader and he was strongly opposed to Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s movement for a preferential tariff, leading to his sacking by Balfour in September 1903.
Ritchie&#x27;s son in law, the Scottish architect Mervyn Macartney, built a country house for Ritchie, Welders House, in the Buckinghamshire village of Jordans.

On 22 December 1905, he was created a peer as Baron Ritchie of Dundee, of Welders in the Parish of Chalfont St Giles in the County of Buckingham. However, he was in ill-health, and died at Biarritz, France in January 1906. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London. He was succeeded in the title by his second son, Charles.

Ritchie was elected as Rector of the University of Aberdeen in late October 1902, taking up the position the following month, serving for three years until November 1905.

<doc id="601192" wikidata="Q7380092" url="?curid=601192" title="Runnymede Trust">
<text>The Runnymede Trust is a British race equality and civil rights think tank. It was founded by Jim Rose and Anthony Lester as an independent source for generating intelligence for a multi-ethnic Britain through research, network building, leading debate and policy engagement. 

The Trust began operations in 1968, the year of two major events in global and British race relations: the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr and Enoch Powell&#x27;s &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech. Runnymede Trust has played a leading role in the UK&#x27;s national debate around race, helping shape legislation including the 1971 and 1976 Race Relations Acts, introducing popular usage of the term &quot;Islamophobia&quot; with its 1996 Commission on British Muslims, and more recently its work informing civil society&#x27;s debate of issues including the 2021 Sewell Report and the Nationality and Borders Act 2022. 

The Trust had been led since 2020 by Halima Begum as director and chief executive, until she stepped down in 2023. Its chairman is Sir Clive Jones.

==Policy areas==
Since 1968 Runnymede Trust has undertaken research in a wide variety of policy areas related to race and civil rights including:
* COVID-19 and health inequalities
* School curriculum reform
* Immigration policy and practice, including the hostile environment policy and the Windrush scandal
* Education policy
* Islamophobia, antisemitism and other forms of religious discrimination
* Criminal justice policy
* Financial inclusion and ethnicity
* Black and Minority Ethnic older people
* The Windrush scandal.

The Runnymede Trust has acted as secretariat for the all-party parliamentary group on Race and Community since the start of 2010, and holds the secretariat of the UK Race and Europe Network (UKREN), a UK-wide network of more than 200 organisations involved in race relations and combating racism at a local, national or European level.

==Research and campaigns==
=== COVID-19 ===
Runnymede has been a leading source of research and data confirming the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black and Minority Ethnic communities in Great Britain. Its survey of 2,585 adults, Over-exposed and Under-protected identified Bangladeshi and Black African communities as most vulnerable, and warned that important public safety and economic contingency measures – including &quot;Stay Home&quot; messaging and furlough advice – were not reaching BAME communities. A statement from the Department of Health said, &quot;We know that Covid-19 has had a disproportionate effect on people from BAME backgrounds ... and the equalities minister is now taking forward vital work to tackle these disparities and protect our most vulnerable communities from the impact of the virus.&quot;

In October 2020, Runnymede published a blog with the Institute for Public Policy Research calling on the government to set out a comprehensive strategy to mitigate ethnic inequalities for the subsequent months of the pandemic. Their research suggested this strategy should tackle two key inequalities. Firstly, because almost all minority ethnic groups are more likely to get COVID-19, the government should put in place measures to better protect these communities and support people to isolate. Secondly, the consequences and harms associated with COVID-19 for most minority ethnic groups, once they have caught it, are more severe. This means the government must ensure that minority ethnic groups have better access to treatment than they currently do.

=== Windrush scandal ===
Runnymede took a prominent role during the unravelling of the Windrush scandal and were acknowledged by the UK Government in bringing the injustice to light. Working with the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Runnymede organised a meeting of 14 Caribbean High Commissioners with Downing Street officials and the Prime Minister at the time, Theresa May. This meeting was organised in parallel to another meeting in Parliament, where 5 of those citizens directly affected were able to discuss their treatment with 40 parliamentarians, including the Immigration Minister and Leader of the Opposition. Runnymede was subsequently named as the only civil society representative on the Windrush Lessons Learned Review Advisory Group and one of &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s five Christmas appeal charities.

=== School curriculum ===

==== &quot;Our Migration Story&quot; ====

In 2016 Runnymede launched &quot;Our Migration Story: The Making of Britain&quot;, a collaboration with academics based at the universities of Cambridge and Manchester. The website is designed to support teachers and students studying migration to Britain and aims to present the &#x27;often untold stories of the generations of migrants who came to and shaped the British Isles&#x27; through interactive source material spanning four time-period categories: AD43–1500; 1500–1750; 1750–1900; 1900–2000s. The website also gives access to multiple teaching resources including lesson plans and classroom activities.

&quot;Our Migration Story&quot; was awarded the Royal Historical Society Public History Prize for Best Online Resource in 2018, named as a Research Champion in the 2017 Community Integration Awards and won The Guardian University Award for Research Impact in 2019.

==== &quot;Lit in Colour&quot; ====

In October 2020, Runnymede and Penguin Books launched &quot;Lit in Colour&quot;, a research project to better understand the gaps in the teaching and learning of books by ethnic minority writers in UK primary and secondary schools, and produce recommendations for change. The completed research was released in June 2021, and made recommendations to support inclusive teaching and learning in schools which were addressed to teachers, parents, publishers and teacher training providers.

=== Essays on class and race ===
In 2009, Runnymede published a collection of essays by leading thinkers on race and class, considering the relationship between social class and race equality. They argued that the white working class is discriminated against on a range of different fronts, but they are not discriminated against for being white.

=== Antisemitism ===
In 1992, The Runnymede Trust set up a committee to examine antisemitism in the UK. In 1994, after two years of research, the committee published its final report, &quot;A Very Light Sleeper – The persistence &amp; dangers of antisemitism&quot;.

=== Faith schools ===
Runnymede published research in 2008 concluding that faith schools in England must become schools for all children in order to encourage interaction between people of different faiths and ethnicities. The report was published after a two-year investigation into the impact that faith schools have on community cohesion.

=== Islamophobia ===
In 1996, Runnymede established a Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia, chaired by Gordon Conway, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sussex, and published &quot;Islamophobia: A Challenge for us All&quot; in 1997. The report, which was launched by Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw, was largely responsible for popularising the term Islamophobia in British political discourse.

=== Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain ===
In 1997, Runnymede established the Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain to consider the political and cultural implications of the changing ethnic diversity of the UK. The commission was chaired by Lord Professor Bhikhu Parekh. The commission published its findings and recommendations in October 2000. Two-thirds of its recommendations were accepted by the government.

=== Legal challenge against government appointments during the COVID pandemic ===
Amid the UK&#x27;s Covid national emergency in November 2020, the Runnymede Trust filed judicial review proceedings against the government in the High Court. The case was brought in the public interest to challenge, under the Equality Act 2010, the legality and appropriateness of the appointment by then Health Secretary Matt Hancock of his friend Baroness Dido Harding to lead the National Institute for Health Protection, and her friend Mike Coupe to lead NHS Test and Trace. In two articles published by The &quot;Times&quot; newspaper, the trust was criticised for undertaking the case in partnership with the Good Law Project, and for alleged political bias in its repudiation of the controversial and widely discredited report published by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities. However, in a preliminary finding on legal standing in 2021, the High Court ruled that the Runnymede Trust had cause to bring the case both in terms of its charitable objectives and the public interest. In its verdict on the case issued in February 2022, the High Court under Lord Justice Singh ruled that Hancock had breached the Equality Act 2010 in his appointment of both Harding and Coupe.

<doc id="601200" wikidata="Q3750914" url="?curid=601200" title="Francis Baring, 1st Baron Northbrook">
<text>Francis Thornhill Baring, 1st Baron Northbrook, (20 April 1796 – 6 September 1866), known as Sir Francis Baring, 3rd Baronet, from 1848 to 1866, was a British Whig politician who served in the governments of Lord Melbourne and Lord John Russell.

==Early life==
A member of the famous Baring banking family, he was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet, and his wife Mary Ursula Sealy, eldest daughter of Charles Sealy.

Baring was educated at Winchester College and then Eton College. He obtained a double first class from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1817, and graduated with a Master of Arts four years later. In 1818 he was commissioned as a Captain in the disembodied North Hampshire Militia, but resigned in 1825. In 1823, he was called to the Bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and in 1848, he succeeded his father as baronet.

==Political career==
Baring entered the British House of Commons in 1826, sitting as a Member of Parliament for Portsmouth until his retirement in 1865. A year later, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Northbrook. Baring was appointed a Lord of the Treasury in 1830, a post he held for the next four years until June 1834. In 1831, Baring was appointed to also serve on the Government Commission upon Emigration, which was wound up in 1832.

He was a Secretary to the Treasury until November 1834, executing this office again between 1835 and 1839. Subsequently, Baring was sworn of the Privy Council and joined the cabinet as Chancellor of the Exchequer, serving until the fall of the Melbourne government in August 1841. He returned to the cabinet in January 1849, replacing Lord Auckland as First Lord of the Admiralty in Russell&#x27;s cabinet, until its fall in 1852.

Baring was a member of the Canterbury Association. He met John Robert Godley on 24 November 1849 to discuss educational matters for the proposed settlement in Canterbury, New Zealand, and gave £600 for education as a memorial to Charles Buller, who had died in the previous year.

==Personal life==
Lord Northbrook was twice married. Firstly, on 7 April 1825 at the Dockyard Chapel, Portsmouth, Lord Northbrook married Jane Grey (1804–1838), daughter of the Sir George Grey, 1st Baronet, and niece of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey. They were the parents of:

* Hon. Mary Baring (d. 1906), who married John Bonham-Carter, son of John Bonham-Carter.
* Thomas George Baring (1826–1904), who married Elizabeth Sturt, daughter of Henry Sturt and sister of Lord Alington.

Secondly, in 1841 he married Lady Arabella Georgina Howard (1809–1884) at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. Lady Arabella was the second daughter of Kenneth Howard, 1st Earl of Effingham. They were the parents of:

* Hon. Francis Henry Baring (1850–1915), who married Lady Grace Boyle, daughter of Richard Boyle, 9th Earl of Cork.

Lord Northbrook died on 6 September 1866, aged 70, and was succeeded by his son from his first marriage, Thomas, who later was created Earl of Northbrook in 1876. Lady Northbrook died in December 1884, aged 75.

==Honours==
* Baring Bay on western Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic is named in his honour.

<doc id="601201" wikidata="Q90994" url="?curid=601201" title="Chase H.Q.">
<text>is a vehicular combat racing game, originally released as an arcade video game by Taito in 1988. It is sometimes seen as a spiritual successor to Taito&#x27;s earlier &quot;Full Throttle&quot;. The player assumes the role of a police officer named Tony Gibson, member of the &quot;Chase Special Investigation Department&quot;. Along with his partner, Raymond Broady, he must stop fleeing criminals in high-speed pursuits in a black Porsche 928.

&quot;Chase H.Q.&quot; was ported to many home computers by Ocean Software in 1989, including versions for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX, Amiga and Atari ST. Taito produced versions for the Family Computer (1989), Game Boy (1990), Master System (1990), TurboGrafx-16 (1990), Game Gear (1991), and Saturn (1996). It was released for PlayStation 2 in Japan in 2007 as part of &quot;Taito Memories II Volume 2&quot;.

The game was a commercial success, becoming Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1989 while also becoming a hit overseas for arcades and home systems. The game was also well received by critics. It was followed by three arcade-based sequels: &quot;Special Criminal Investigation&quot; (1989), &quot;Super Chase: Criminal Termination&quot; (1992) and &quot;Chase H.Q. 2&quot; (2007). Two spin-offs were also released: &quot;Crime City&quot; (1989) and &quot;Quiz H.Q.&quot; (1990).

==Gameplay==
At the start of each level the player is informed who they are pursuing, a great distance away: They must apprehend the criminal before their time limit expires. The criminal&#x27;s car is constantly moving away, so if the player repeatedly crashes or drives too slowly, the criminal will escape. At some points during the game the road splits, and the correct turn must be taken, otherwise it will take longer to catch the criminal. When their vehicle is reached, the time limit is extended; the vehicle must be rammed a number of times until the criminal is forced to stop, then is arrested.

The game includes five levels. Both the initial time limit to reach the criminal and the time extension to ram the criminal are 60, 65, or 70 seconds.

When Nancy at Chase HQ (at the start of every level) calls on the radio, the frequency is often between 144 and 148 MHz. This is actually the 2-meter band of amateur or ham radio frequencies.

Although superficially similar in technology to Sega&#x27;s &quot;Out Run&quot;, &quot;Chase HQ&quot; features significant technical advancements over that title in the presentation of perspective, hills and track splits.

Villains (for arcade versions):
:1. Ralph, the Idaho Slasher (White Lotus Esprit)
:2. Carlos, the New York armed robber (Yellow Lamborghini Countach)
:3. Chicago pushers (Silver Porsche 911)
:4. L.A. kidnapper (Blue Ferrari 288 GTO)
:5. Eastern Bloc Spy (Red Porsche 928)

The last villain&#x27;s car is always listed as unidentified.

If the level is completed, bonus points are as follows: if completed without continuing, 100,000 times level in play, otherwise, 10,000; plus, 5,000 per second saved for completing level. A 5,000,000-point award is collected for beating the game.

==Ports and related releases==
Ocean released versions of the game for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga and Atari ST in December 1989. The MSX version was released in February 1990 only in Spain, roughly one month later after the launch of the rest of Ocean&#x27;s versions in that market.

Taito produced ports (known as Taito Chase H.Q.) for the Family Computer (1989), Game Boy (1990/1991), Master System (1990), TurboGrafx-16 (1990) and Game Gear (1991). In 1992, it was released on the Genesis as Chase H.Q. II (known as Super H.Q. in Japan), with some minor changes, including alternative player vehicles.

In December 1990, the game was included on the Wheels Of Fire compilation, which also featured &quot;Hard Drivin&quot;, &quot;Power Drift&quot; and &quot;Turbo OutRun&quot; on the Commodore 64. In June 1991, the game was released on the Power Up compilation, which also featured also on the C64 &quot;Altered Beast&quot;, &quot;Turrican&quot;, &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot; and &quot;X-Out&quot;.

In 1991, the game was released for the FM Towns.

In 1993, Taito released &quot;Super Chase H.Q.&quot; (known in Japan as &quot;Super H.Q. Criminal Chaser&quot;) for the Super NES. Unlike other home versions, it is played in first person perspective and is based upon &quot;Super Chase: Criminal Termination&quot; rather than the original &quot;Chase H.Q.&quot; Gameplay is modeled on the original with some aspects of &quot;S.C.I.&quot; incorporated. A PAL version of &quot;Super Chase H.Q.&quot; was released exclusively in Australia in 1993 by Mattel (Nintendo&#x27;s ANZ distributor until 1994) and re-released by Nintendo Australia thereafter. There is also a &quot;Super Chase H.Q.&quot; for the Game Boy, which was released exclusively in North America, in 1994. The game is similar to the Game Boy&#x27;s &quot;Taito Chase H.Q.&quot; (1991).

In 1996, Taito released an emulation of the arcade original for the Sega Saturn in Japan, bundled together with &quot;Special Criminal Investigation&quot; on one disc.

In 2000, &quot;Chase H.Q. Secret Police&quot; was released for the Game Boy Color.

In July 2008, the TurboGrafx-16 version of the game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console.

A spin-off was released in 1989 titled &quot;Crime City&quot;. The game play deviates from the traditional third-person driving and is instead a side scrolling type shooter.

==Reception==
===Commercial===
Upon release in arcades, &quot;&quot; listed &quot;Chase H.Q.&quot; on their 15 November 1988 issue as being the second most-successful upright arcade cabinet of the month in Japan. It went on to become Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1989. In the United Kingdom, it was a hit in the arcades, becoming the top coin-on arcade game at one point.

The home computer conversions topped the UK sales chart in Christmas 1989. The ZX Spectrum version of the game was later number 2 on the UK sales charts in early 1990, behind &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot;.

===Critical===
The arcade game was well received by critics. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; gave it a positive review, stating &quot;at last&quot; a &quot;racing game with something more to do than just whizzing around a track to beat the course time&quot;. They concluded that it is &quot;fast and challenging with great graphics&quot; and &quot;good clear sound effects&quot; and is &quot;definitely a winner&quot;. &quot;ACE&quot; said that the &quot;&quot;Out Run&quot; theme keeps being expanded and presented in different ways&quot; like &quot;Power Drift&quot; but considered &quot;Chase HQ&quot; better than the former. They concluded that the game&#x27;s driving and violence is &quot;a winning coin-up combination&quot;. &quot;Crash&quot; said it &quot;is a great game&quot; and &quot;the ultimate arcade version of cops-and-robbers movies&quot;. According to &quot;Arcade History&quot;, it &quot;was arguably the first sprite-scaled racer since&quot; &quot;Out Run&quot; &quot;to truly capture the gaming public&#x27;s imagination&quot;.

The home computer conversions were also mostly well received by critics. The 16-bit Amiga and Atari ST versions received positive reviews, while the 8-bit ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC conversions received high review scores and are generally recognised as the most accurate and most playable of the Ocean Software home computer releases. All three of the ZX Spectrum magazines awarded it 94% or above, praising the speed of the game and the originality. &quot;Crash&quot; gave the game 95%, while &quot;Sinclair User&quot; awarded it 96%. On the other hand, the 8-bit Commodore 64 conversion received a generally negative reception.

The Master System conversion was well received by critics. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; said the &quot;gameplay is as exciting as it was in the arcades&quot; and &quot;the high-speed thrills of this conversion&quot; makes this game worth to look at it.

===Accolades===
At Japan&#x27;s 1989 , the arcade version was nominated for Hit Game of the Year, for which it was voted 10th place. According to an Ocean Software advert in 1989, the arcade version was voted Arcade Game of the Year.

At the 1989/1990 Golden Joystick Awards, the 8-bit home computer versions were awarded Best 8-Bit Coin-Op Conversion and Best 8-Bit Soundtrack. The Spectrum version also topped &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;″ &quot;The Best Games of &#x27;89&quot; list (along with &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;). The Spectrum version was voted number 1 in the &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; poll of Readers&#x27; Top 100 Games of All Time in 1993.

==Records==
Brian Kuh from Weirs Beach, New Hampshire holds the official arcade world record with a score of 3,596,680 points achieved on 1 June 2006 at Funspot Family Fun Center, Weirs Beach, New Hampshire. Robert Gray from Dumfriesshire, Scotland holds the official MAME world record with a score of 11,490,280 points achieved on 13 June 2010.

==Legacy==
&quot;Chase H.Q.&quot; was successful enough to earn two arcade-based sequels - the widely released &quot;Special Criminal Investigation&quot; released in 1989 and the extremely rare &quot;Super Chase: Criminal Termination&quot; released in 1992. It also earned two spin-offs - the run and gun &quot;Crime City&quot;, and the quiz game &quot;Quiz H.Q.&quot;.

&quot;Special Criminal Investigation&quot; expands on the original with the addition of guns - the passenger can rise out of the T-top of his Nissan 300ZX Z32 and shoot at oncoming targets. To take advantage of this, enemies are placed throughout the level and will attempt to shoot at or ram the player as they attempt to pursue the main criminal. Deviating from the relatively realistic tracks on offer in the original, the sequel features pursuits through waterfalls and unfinished sections of elevated highway.

&quot;Super Chase: Criminal Termination&quot; was the third arcade release in the &quot;Chase H.Q.&quot; series, released in 1992.

The 1997 PlayStation game &quot;Ray Tracers&quot;, developed and released by Taito, has been described as &quot;more or less a follow up&quot; to the game, with &quot;only a few differences&quot; such as a different speed-boost system and a greater variety of targets.

In February 2006, &quot;Chase H.Q.: Nancy Yori Kinkyuu Renraku&quot; (&quot;Chase H.Q. - An Urgent Call From Nancy&quot;) was presented at the Arcade Operator&#x27;s Union (AOU) trade show in Tokyo. It was shown again at AOU 2007. The game was released as &quot;Chase H.Q. 2&quot; in December 2007.

Saint Etienne recorded a demo dance track called &quot;Chase HQ&quot; that was inspired by &quot;Chase H.Q.&quot; It includes samples of the &quot;Oh man!&quot; and &quot;Punch the pedal!&quot; exclamations from the game action. The track was released as a bonus track on the 2009 Deluxe reissue of the band&#x27;s 1991 album, &quot;Foxbase Alpha&quot;.

&quot;Chase HQ&quot;″s gameplay, which involved ramming the enemy car while avoiding oncoming traffic, has been cited as a precursor to the gameplay of later titles such as &quot;Driver&quot; and &quot;Burnout&quot;.

<text>Missing in action (MIA) is a casualty classification assigned to combatants, military chaplains, combat medics, and prisoners of war who are reported missing during wartime or ceasefire. They may have been killed, wounded, captured, executed, or deserted. If deceased, neither their remains nor grave have been positively identified. Becoming MIA has been an occupational risk for as long as there has been warfare.

==Problems and solutions==
Until around 1912, service personnel in most countries were not routinely issued with ID tags. As a result, if someone was killed in action and their body was not recovered until much later, there was often little or no chance of identifying the remains unless the person in question was carrying items that would identify them, or had marked their clothing or possessions with identifying information. Starting around the time of the First World War, nations began to issue their service personnel with purpose-made identification tags. These were usually made of some form of lightweight metal such as aluminium. However, in the case of the British Army the material chosen was compressed fiber, which was not very durable. Although wearing identification tags proved to be highly beneficial, the problem remained that bodies could be completely destroyed (ranging from total body disruption to outright disintegration), burned or buried by the type of high-explosive munitions routinely used in modern warfare or in destructions of vehicles.

Additionally, the combat environment itself could increase the likelihood of missing combatants. The odds of a combatant being declared MIA could be increased by scenarios such as jungle warfare, submarine warfare, aircraft crashes in remote mountainous terrain, or sea battles. Alternatively, there could be administrative errors; the actual location of a temporary battlefield grave could be misidentified or forgotten due to the &quot;fog of war&quot;. Finally, since military forces had no strong incentive to keep detailed records of enemy dead, bodies were frequently buried (sometimes with their identification tags) in temporary graves, the locations of which were often lost or obliterated e.g. the forgotten mass grave at Fromelles. As a result, the remains of missing combatants might not be found for many years, if ever. When missing combatants are recovered and cannot be identified after a thorough forensic examination (including such methods as DNA testing and comparison of dental records) the remains are interred with a tombstone which indicates their unknown status.

The development of genetic fingerprinting in the late 20th century means that if cell samples from a cheek swab are collected from service personnel prior to deployment to a combat zone, identity can be established using even a small fragment of human remains. Although it is possible to take genetic samples from a close relative of the missing person, it is preferable to collect such samples directly from the subjects themselves. It is a fact of warfare that some combatants are likely to go missing in action and never be found. However, by wearing identification tags and using modern technology the numbers involved can be considerably reduced. In addition to the obvious military advantages, conclusively identifying the remains of missing service personnel is highly beneficial to the surviving relatives. Having positive identification makes it somewhat easier to come to terms with their loss and move on with their lives. Otherwise, some relatives may suspect that the missing person is still alive somewhere and may return someday. However, many of these identifying procedures are not typically used for combatants who are members of militias, mercenary armies, insurrections, and other irregular forces.

== History ==

===Before the 20th century===
The numerous wars which have occurred over the centuries have created many MIAs. The list is long and includes most battles which have ever been fought by any nation. The usual problems of identification caused by rapid decomposition were exacerbated by the fact that it was common practice to loot the remains of the dead for any valuables e.g. personal items and clothing. This made the already difficult task of identification even harder. Thereafter the dead were routinely buried in mass graves and scant official records were retained. Notable examples include such medieval battles as Towton, the Hundred Years&#x27; War, The Battle of Alcácer Quibir where King Sebastian of Portugal disappeared, the later English Civil Wars, and Napoleonic Wars together with any battle taking place until around the middle of the 19th century. 

Starting around the time of the Crimean War (1853-1856), American Civil War (1861-1865), and Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), it became more common to make formal efforts to identify individual soldiers. However, since there was no formal system of ID tags at the time, this could be difficult during the process of battlefield clearance. Even so, there had been a notable shift in perceptions e.g. where the remains of a soldier in Confederate uniform were recovered from, say, the Gettysburg battlefield, he would be interred in a single grave with a headstone which stated that he was an unknown Confederate soldier. This change in attitudes coincided with the Geneva Conventions, the first of which was signed in 1864. Although the First Geneva Convention did not specifically address the issue of MIAs, the reasoning behind it (which specified the humane treatment of wounded enemy soldiers) was influential. The Geneva Convention was in part inspired by the experiences of Henri Dunant after the Battle of Solferino in 1859 where 40,000 wounded soldiers had lingered in agony for lack of care, facilities and logistics to ameliorate their condition. Dunant also founded the Red Cross (in 1863), an organization dedicated to reduce the suffering of wounded in war and to ensure humane treatment of POWs. Summary executions of POWs (or in the past their abduction into slavery or human sacrifice) are another common cause for casualties to become missing in action. The Hague Convention of 1899 was the first piece of codified International law to explicitly outlaw such collective punishment as it banned &quot;no quarter&quot;. Now any execution of POWs would require a formal court martial creating a paper trail — at least for armed forces that followed the Laws of War. Technology and logistics had also changed. Railroads were used during the Crimean War and played a decisive role in several battles of the American Civil War and – especially the quick mobilisation of Prussian and allied forces – at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War. Where previously there were hardly any alternatives to bury the dead close to where they fell before their bodies decomposed, now they could – if logistics allowed – be transported elsewhere for identification and proper burial. Those killed in action at sea had previously simply been thrown overboard or their bodies pickled in distilled alcohol for preservation (as happened with Horatio Nelson). Now steamships allowed for much quicker transport than sailing or rowing vessels ever had.

===World War I===

The phenomenon of MIAs became particularly notable during World War I, where the mechanized nature of modern warfare meant that a single battle could cause astounding numbers of casualties. For example, in 1916 over 300,000 Allied and German combatants were killed in the Battle of the Somme. A total of 19,240 British and Commonwealth combatants were killed in action or died of wounds on the first day of that battle alone. It is therefore not surprising that the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme in France bears the names of 72,090 British and Commonwealth combatants, all of whom went missing in action during the Battle of the Somme, were never found and who have no known grave. Similarly, the Menin Gate memorial in Belgium commemorates 54,896 missing Allied combatants who are known to have been killed in the Ypres Salient. The Douaumont ossuary, meanwhile, contains 130,000 unidentifiable sets of French and German remains from the Battle of Verdun.

Even in the 21st century, the remains of missing combatants are recovered from the former battlefields of the Western Front every year. These discoveries happen regularly, often during the course of agricultural work or construction projects. Typically, the remains of one or several men are found at a time. However, occasionally the numbers recovered are much larger e.g. the mass grave at Fromelles (excavated in 2009) which contained the skeletal remains of no less than 250 Allied soldiers. Another example is the excavation which took place at Carspach (Alsace region of France) in early 2012, which uncovered the remains of 21 German soldiers, lost in an underground shelter since 1918, after being buried by a large-calibre British artillery shell. Regardless, efforts are made to identify any remains found via a thorough forensic examination. If this is achieved, attempts are made to trace any living relatives. However, it is frequently impossible to identify the remains, other than to establish some basic details of the unit they served with. In the case of British and Commonwealth MIAs, the headstone is inscribed with the maximum amount of information that is known about the person. Typically, such information is deduced from metallic objects such as brass buttons and shoulder flashes bearing regimental/unit insignia found on the body. As a result, headstones are inscribed with such information as &quot;A Soldier of The Cameronians&quot; or &quot;An Australian Corporal&quot; etc. Where nothing is known other than the soldier&#x27;s national allegiance, the headstone is inscribed &quot;A Soldier of The Great War&quot;. The term &quot;Sailor&quot; or &quot;Airman&quot; can be substituted, as appropriate.
===World War II===
There are many missing combatants and other persons in service from World War II.
In the United States Armed Forces, 78,750 personnel missing in action had been reported by the end of the war, representing over 19 percent of the total of 405,399 killed during the conflict.

As with MIAs from the First World War, it is a routine occurrence for the remains of missing personnel killed during the Second World War to be periodically discovered. Usually they are found purely by chance (e.g. during construction or demolition work) though on some occasions they are recovered following deliberate, targeted searches. As with the First World War, in western Europe MIAs are generally found as individuals, or in twos or threes. However, sometimes the numbers in a group are considerably larger e.g. the mass grave at Villeneuve-Loubet, which contained the remains of 14 German soldiers killed in August 1944. Others are located at remote aircraft crash sites in various countries.
But in eastern Europe and Russia, World War II casualties include approximately two million missing Germans, and many mass graves remain to be found. Almost a half million German MIAs have been buried in new graves since the end of the Cold War. Most of them will stay unknown. The German War Graves Commission is spearheading the effort. Similarly, there are approximately 4 million missing Russian service personnel scattered across the former Eastern Front, from Leningrad down to Stalingrad, though around 300 volunteer groups make periodic searches of old battlefields to recover human remains for identification and reburial.

During the 2000s, there was renewed attention within and without the U.S. military to finding remains of the missing, especially in the European Theatre and especially since aging witnesses and local historians were dying off. The group World War II Families for the Return of the Missing was founded in 2005 to work with the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command and other governmental entities towards locating and repatriating the remains of Americans lost in the conflict. The president of the group said in reference to the far more publicised efforts to find remains of U.S. dead from the Vietnam War, &quot;Vietnam had advocates. This was an older generation, and they didn&#x27;t know who to turn to.&quot;

In 2008, investigators began to conduct searches on Tarawa atoll in the Pacific Ocean, trying to locate the remains of 139 American Marines, missing since the Battle of Tarawa in 1943. Between 2013 and 2016 the remains of 37 US Marines were recovered from Tarawa. Among those recovered was Medal of Honor recipient Alexander Bonnyman.

According to official US Department of Army and Department of Navy casualty records, submitted to Congress in 1946 and updated in 1953, the combined possible total of missing service personnel worldwide is closer to approximately 6600 and probably considerably fewer. Significantly, DPAA continues to list as &quot;unaccounted for&quot; the five Sullivan brothers—arguably the single most accounted-for group of WWII casualties ever recorded. Since DPAA alone designates such WWII personnel as the entire crew of the and most of the crew of the as both &quot;missing&quot; and &quot;unaccounted for&quot; it is likely that DPAA records keeping is irregular and prone to opinion rather than fact.

As of February 15, 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, there were a total of 73677 MIAS of whom 1696 MIAS are accounted for and 71981 are unaccounted for
===Korean War===

====Korean War US MIAs repatriation (1954–2023)====

The US Department of Defense DPAA gives dates for the Korean War from June 27, 1950, to January 31, 1955. Between June and October 1950, an estimated 700 civilian and US military POWs had been captured by the North Koreans. By August 1953 only 262 were still alive; one of the survivors was Private First Class Wayne A. &quot;Johnnie&quot; Johnson, who secretly documented the deaths of 496 US military and Korean/European civilian POWs. Johnson would later be awarded the Silver Star medal for valor in 1996.

In August 1953, General James Van Fleet, who had led US and UN forces in Korea, estimated that &quot;a large percentage&quot; of those service members listed as missing in action were alive. (Coincidentally, General Van Fleet&#x27;s own son Captain James Alward Van Fleet Jr was MIA from a United States Air Force mission over North Korea April 4, 1952.)

The total number of Korean War MIAS/remains not recovered was 8,154. In 1954 during Operation Glory, the remains of 4,023 UN personnel were received from North Korea, of which 1,868 were Americans; of the recovered US remains, 848 could not be identified.

Between 1982 and 2016, 781 unknown remains were recovered from North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, and Punchbowl Cemetery in Hawaii, of which a total of 459 have been identified 950 sets of remains were uncovered in South Korea; of 20 sets of remains 11 were identified.

The U.S. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (now the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency) and the equivalent South Korean command are actively involved in trying to locate and identify remains of both countries&#x27; personnel. Remains of missing combatants from the Korean War are periodically recovered and identified in both North and South Korea. It is thought that 13,000 South Korean and 2,000 U.S. combatants are buried in the Korean Demilitarized Zone alone and never found. In the summer of 2018 President Moon Jae-in of South Korea expressed his hopes to recover the remains of Korean soldiers from the DMZ. South Korea MIAs are believed to number 120,000.&lt;br&gt; In 2018 the remains of 1 North Korean were repatriated to North Korea from the U.S.&lt;br&gt; On Sept 27, 2018, the remains of 64 South Korean soldier MIAs were repatriated to South Korea from the United States.&lt;br&gt;On June 25, 2020, the remains of 147 South Korean soldier MIAs were repatriated to South Korea from the United States.&lt;br&gt;In July 2020 it is reported that 50,000 South Korean POWS were never repatriated from North Korea in 1953.

The 1991–1993 United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs investigated some outstanding issues and reports related to the fate of U.S. service personnel still missing from the Korean War. In 1996, the Defense Department stated that there was no clear evidence any of the U.S. prisoners were still alive.

, at least 500 South Korean prisoners of war were believed to be still detained by the North Korean regime. That same year the U.S. suspended talks with North Korea over the recovery of MIAs; the George W. Bush administration had broken off relations between the US and North Korea-claiming it couldn&#x27;t guarantee Americans safety.

In 2007 New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson traveled to Pyongong and returned with six sets of remains.

In 2010, it was reported that the Obama administration was reversing the Bush administration&#x27;s suspended talks in regard to North Korea MIAs.

In 2011, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) adopted Resolution # 423 calling for renewed discussions with North Korea to recover Americans missing in action. On July 27, 2011, Congressman Charles Rangel introduced a congressional resolution calling on North Korea to repatriate POW/MIAS and abductees from North Korea.

In January 2012, it was announced that members of JPAC would go to North Korea in the spring to search for an estimated 5,000 MIAs in the Unsan &amp; the Chosin Reservoir areas.

In February 2012, talks were going ahead between the US and North Korea to resume discussions to recover US MIAs after seven years. &lt;br&gt;On March 8, 2012, the US announced it would search for MIAs in North Korea, however on March 21, 2012, US President Obama&#x27;s administration suspended talks with North Korea over the recovery of US servicemen killed and missing in North Korea.

In 2013, Korea War/Cold War Families Inc started an online petition to Obama to resolve Cold/Korean War mysteries.

In October 2014, North Korea announced it was going to move the remains of about 5,000 U.S. combatants en masse in an apparent attempt to force the U.S. to restart MIA recovery. North Korea also gave a warning that &quot;... North Korea blamed the United States &#x27;hostile policy&#x27; for causing the remains recovery missions to end. The statement warned that &quot;remains of American soldiers would soon be lost&quot;, as they were being &quot;carried away en masse due to construction projects of hydro-power stations, land rezoning and other gigantic natureremaking projects, flood damage, etc...&quot;

As of December 2015, the DPAA &quot;does not currently conduct&quot; operations in North Korea.

On June 24, 2016, Congressmen Rangel, John Conyers, Sam Johnson introduced House Resolution No. 799 calling on the U.S. Government to resume talks in regard to the US MIAs. On September 27, 2016, House Resolution No. 799 was referred to the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. It was not enacted.

In the wake of the June 2018 meeting between U.S. President Trump and North Korean leader Kim, the U.S. received 55 boxes of MIA remains on July 27, 2018—the 65th anniversary of the Korean War truce. As of September 28, 2021, 77 Korean War MIAs have been identified from these 55 boxes. As of April 1, 2022 82 remains have been identified from 55 boxes; the total of remains recovered from 1996 to 2005 are 612 of whom 16 are yet unknown.

On September 22, 2021, the first US-South Korean Joint repatriation service was held: U.S. received the remains of 1 of 6 U.S. soldiers to be repatriated; South Korea received remains of two of 68 ROK Soldiers to be repatriated.

On February 22, 2023, the second US-South Korean Joint repatriation service was held: U.S. received from South Korea the remains of 1 U.S. Soldier.

On June 25, 2023, the third US-South Korean Joint repatriation service was held: South Korea received the remains of 7 ROK soldiers of whom 1 was identified; previous repatriation ceremonies in 2012, 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2021 have returned over 200 ROK remains to South Korea.

As of September 9, 2024 the US Department of Defense has accounted for 700th Missing in Action soldier from the Korean war-Cpl Billie Charles Driver of the 8th US Cavalry Regiment. 

As of February 15, 2025, according to the US Department of Defense the total MIAs were 8157 of which accounted for number 713 and total MIA unaccounted for number 7440

====Arrowhead Hill MIA====
Remains of nine sets of remains of Korean War MIA servicemen have also been discovered at Arrowhead Hill, aka Hill 281 Battle of White Horse, which is located in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, during minesweeping operations between October and November 2018. Arrowhead Hill had previously been selected for both Koreas to jointly conduct a pilot remains recovery project.

====Australians MIA in Korea====
A number of Australian combatants and POWs have also never been recovered from Korea. Of 340 Australian servicemen killed in the Korean War, 43 are listed as MIA.

====North Korean unknowns====
Since 1996, the remains of Korean People&#x27;s Army combatants recovered from battlefield exhumations across South Korea have been buried in the Cemetery for North Korean and Chinese Soldiers, the majority of the over 770 burials are unknowns.

===Vietnam War===

Following the Paris Peace Accords of 1973, 591 U.S. prisoners of war were returned during Operation Homecoming. The U.S. listed about 1,350 Americans as prisoners of war or missing in action and roughly 1,200 Americans reported killed in action and body not recovered. By the early 1990s, this had been reduced to a total of 2,255 unaccounted for from the war, which constituted less than 4 percent of the total 58,152 U.S. service members killed. This was by far the smallest proportion in the nation&#x27;s history to that point.

About 80 percent of those missing were airmen who were shot down over North Vietnam or Laos, usually over remote mountains, tropical rain forest, or water; the rest typically disappeared in confused fighting in dense jungles. Investigations of these incidents have involved determining whether the men involved survived their shootdown and, if not, efforts to recover their remains. POW/MIA activists played a role in pushing the U.S. government to improve its efforts in resolving the fates of the missing. Progress in doing so was slow until the mid-1980s, when relations between the U.S. and Vietnam began to improve and more cooperative efforts were undertaken. Normalization of U.S. relations with Vietnam in the mid-1990s was a culmination of this process.

Considerable speculation and investigation has gone to a theory that a significant number of these men were captured as prisoners of war by Communist forces in the two countries and kept as live prisoners after the war&#x27;s conclusion for the United States in 1973. A vocal group of POW/MIA activists maintains that there has been a concerted conspiracy by the Vietnamese government and every American government since then to hide the existence of these prisoners. The U.S. government has steadfastly denied that prisoners were left behind or that any effort has been made to cover up their existence. Popular culture has reflected the &quot;live prisoners&quot; theory, most notably in the 1985 film &quot;&quot;. Several congressional investigations have looked into the issue, culminating with the largest and most thorough, the United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs of 1991–1993 led by Senators John Kerry, Bob Smith, and John McCain. Its unanimous conclusion found &quot;no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.&quot;

This missing in action issue has been a highly emotional one to those involved, and is often considered the last depressing, divisive aftereffect of the Vietnam War. To skeptics, &quot;live prisoners&quot; is a conspiracy theory unsupported by motivation or evidence, and the foundation for a cottage industry of charlatans who have preyed upon the hopes of the families of the missing. As two skeptics wrote in 1995, &quot;The conspiracy myth surrounding the Americans who remained missing after Operation Homecoming in 1973 had evolved to baroque intricacy. By 1992, there were thousands of zealots—who believed with cultlike fervor that hundreds of American POWs had been deliberately and callously abandoned in Indochina after the war, that there was a vast conspiracy within the armed forces and the executive branch—spanning five administrations—to cover up all evidence of this betrayal, and that the governments of Communist Vietnam and Laos continued to hold an unspecified number of living American POWs, despite their adamant denials of this charge.&quot; Believers reject such notions; as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Sydney Schanberg wrote in 1994, &quot;It is not conspiracy theory, not paranoid myth, not Rambo fantasy. It is only hard evidence of a national disgrace: American prisoners were left behind at the end of the Vietnam War. They were abandoned because six presidents and official Washington could not admit their guilty secret. They were forgotten because the press and most Americans turned away from all things that reminded them of Vietnam.&quot;

There are also a large number of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong MIAs from the Vietnam war whose remains have yet to be recovered. In 1974, General Võ Nguyên Giáp stated that they had 330,000 missing in action. As of 1999, estimates of those missing were usually around 300,000. This figure does not include those missing from former South Vietnamese armed forces, who are given little consideration under the Vietnamese regime. The Vietnamese government did not have any organized program to search for its own missing, in comparison to what it had established to search for American missing. The discrepancy angered some Vietnamese; as one said, &quot;It&#x27;s crazy for the Americans to keep asking us to find their men. We lost several times more than the Americans did. In any war there are many people who disappear. They just disappear.&quot; In the 2000s, thousands of Vietnamese were hiring psychics in an effort to find the remains of missing family members. The Vietnamese Army organizes what it considers to be the best of the psychics, as part of its parapsychology force trying to find remains. Additionally, remains dating from the earlier French colonial era are sometimes discovered: in January 2009, the remains of at least 50 anti-French resistance fighters dating from circa 1946 to 1947 were discovered in graves located under a former market in central Hanoi.

As of February 15, 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, US Military and Civilian personnel:of 2634 MIAS pf which 1061 accounted for and 1573 are still unaccounted

The 1991–1993 United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs investigated some outstanding issues and reports related to the fate of U.S. service personnel still missing from the Cold War. In 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin told the committee that the Soviet Union had held survivors of spy planes shot down in the early 1950s in prisons or psychiatric facilities. Russian Colonel General Dmitri Volkogonov, co-leader of the U.S.–Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs, said that to his knowledge no Americans were currently being held against their will within the borders of the former Soviet Union. The Select Committee concluded that it &quot;found evidence that some U.S. POWs were held in the former Soviet Union after WW II, the Korean War and Cold War incidents,&quot; and that it &quot;cannot, based on its investigation to date, rule out the possibility that one or more U.S. POWs from past wars or incidents are still being held somewhere within the borders of the former Soviet Union.&quot;

=== Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 ===
In the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, two companies of the Indian Army&#x27;s 15th Punjab (formerly First Patiala) were attacked by four brigades of the Pakistan Army on 3 December 1971 at 1835 hours. Nearly 4,000 Pakistani men attacked the Indian side with 15 tanks and heavy artillery support. The Indian commanders included Major Waraich, Major Singh&#x27;s and Major Kanwaljit Sandhu, who was badly injured. Major SPS Waraich was reported captured, as were many JCOs and men as the squadrons were taken by surprise and had little time to get to their bunkers. A Pakistani radio news telecast reported (in Urdu) that &quot;Maj Waraich hamari hiraasat mein hain&quot; (Maj Waraich is in our custody). There was a subsequent report that Maj Waraich was in a North West Frontier jail. Their current status is unknown. They are listed as missing by the Indian Government along with 52 others including a Maj Ashok Suri who wrote a letter to his father in 1975 from Karachi stating that he was alive and well. Pakistan denies holding any of the soldiers missing in action.

===Iran–Iraq War===

The Iran–Iraq War of 1980–1988 left tens of thousands of Iranian and Iraqi combatants and prisoners of war still unaccounted for. Some counts include civilians who disappeared during the conflict. One estimate is that more than 52,000 Iraqis went missing in the war. Officially, the government of Iran lists 8,000 as missing.

Following up on these cases is often difficult because no accurate or surviving documentation exists. The situation in Iraq is additionally difficult because unknown hundreds of thousands persons are missing due to Iraq&#x27;s later conflicts, both internal and external, and in Iran due to its being a largely closed society. In addition, relations between the countries remained quite poor for a long time; the last POWs from the war were not exchanged until 2003 and relations did not begin to improve until after the regime change brought on by the 2003 onset of the Iraq War. Some cases are brought forward when mass graves are discovered in Iraq, holding the bodies of Iranians once held prisoner. Websites have been started to attempt to track the fates of members of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force shot down and captured over Iraq.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been active in trying to resolve MIA issues from the war; in October 2008, twenty years after the end of the war, the ICRC forged a memorandum of understanding with the two countries to share information collected in pursuit of resolving cases. Families are still desperate for knowledge about the fate of their loved ones.

In Iran, efforts at answering families&#x27; questions and identifying remains are led by the POWs and Missing Commission of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army, the Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs.

In Iraq, efforts are led by the Ministry of Human Rights.

===Gulf War===
According to the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, 47 Americans were listed as POW/MIAs at some point during Operation Desert Storm. At the conclusion of the Gulf War of 1991, U.S. forces resolved all but one of those cases: 21 Prisoners of War were repatriated, 23 bodies were recovered and 2 bodies were lost over the Gulf and therefore classified as Killed-In-Action, Body Not Recovered. That one MIA case, that of U.S. Lt. Cmdr. Michael Scott Speicher, became quite well known. He was reported as missing after his F/A-18 was shot down in northern Iraq on the first night of the war. Over the years his status was changed from missing to killed in action to missing-captured, a move that suggested he was alive and imprisoned in Iraq. In 2002, his possible situation became a more high-profile issue in the build-up to the Iraq War; &quot;The Washington Times&quot; ran five successive front-page articles about it in March 2002 and in September 2002, U.S. President George W. Bush mentioned Speicher in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly as part of his case for war. However, despite the 2003 invasion of Iraq and U.S. military control of the country, Speicher was not found and his status remained under debate. It was eventually resolved in August 2009 when his remains were found in the Iraq desert where, according to local civilians, he was buried following his crash in 1991.

How many Iraqi forces went missing as a result of the war is not readily known, as estimates of Iraqi casualties overall range considerably.

The two cases KIABNR:
* Lt. Cmdr. Barry T. Cooke, U.S. Navy, was lost on February 2, 1991, when his A-6 aircraft went down in the Persian Gulf.
* Lt. Robert J. Dwyer, U.S. Navy, was lost on February 5, 1991, when his FA-18 aircraft went down in the Persian Gulf.

===Other conflicts===
As of March 26, 2024, according to the US Department of Defense, the total of unaccounted for from the category of the Iraqi Theater and other conflicts is at 6. This includes Captain Paul F. Lorence (Operation El Dorado Canyon - 1986), Lt. Cmdr. Barry T. Cooke &amp; Lt. Robert J. Dwyer (Operation Desert Storm - 1991) and civilian contractors Kirk von Ackermann, Timothy E. Bell &amp; Adnan al-Hilawi (Operation Iraqi Freedom - 2003–2010). The US Defense POW/MIA website has the following remarks:
&quot;...more than 82,000 Americans remain missing from WWII, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Cold War, and the Gulf Wars/other conflicts. Out of the 82,000 missing, 75% of the losses are located in the Indo-Pacific, and over 41,000 of the missing are presumed lost at sea (i.e. ship losses, known aircraft water losses, etc.)

<text>Antoun Saadeh (; 1 March 1904 – 8 July 1949) was a Lebanese politician, sociologist, philosopher and writer who founded the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Saadeh was born in 1904 in Dhour El Choueir, in the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate. He was the son of a Syrian Greek Orthodox Christian physician, Khalil Saadeh and Naifa Nassir Khneisser. His father was himself a Syrian nationalist as well as democracy advocate, and also an intellectual and author, who has been described as &quot;a prolific writer and polymath, whose works span the fields of politics, literature, journalism, novel-writing, and translation&quot;. Antoun Saadeh completed his elementary education in his birth town and continued his studies at the Lycée des Frères in Cairo and came back to Lebanon at the death of his mother. In the later part of 1919, Saadeh immigrated to the United States, where he resided for approximately one year with his uncle in Springer, New Mexico and worked at a local train station. In February 1921, he moved to Brazil with his father, a prominent Arabic-language journalist. In 1924, Saadeh founded a secret society to unify &quot;Natural Syria&quot;. This society was dissolved the following year. &quot;Natural Syria&quot;, according to Saadeh, included the Levant, Palestine, Transjordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and parts of Southern Turkey. His concept of Syria included all religious, ethnic and linguistic groups in this region. During his time in Brazil, Saadeh learned German and Russian. Ultimately, he became a polyglot fluent in seven languages: Arabic, English, Portuguese, French, German, Spanish and Russian.

===Activity in Lebanon===
In July 1930, he returned to Lebanon. In 1931, he wrote &quot;A Love Tragedy&quot;, which was first published with his &quot;Story of the Holiday of Our Lady of Sidnaya&quot; in Beirut in 1933. Also, in 1931, Saadeh worked at the daily newspaper &quot;Al-Ayyam&quot;; then, in 1932, he taught German at the American University of Beirut. In 1933, he continued to publish pamphlets in the Al-Majalia magazine in Beirut.

On 16 November 1932, Saadeh secretly founded the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. Three years later, on 16 November 1935, the party&#x27;s existence was proclaimed, and Saadeh was arrested and sentenced to six years imprisonment by the French colonial powers. During his confinement, he wrote his first book, &quot;The Rise of Nations&quot;. He was released from prison early but was again detained in June 1936, where he wrote another book, &quot;Principles Explained&quot;. In November of the same year, he was released from prison, but in March 1937, he was arrested again. During the time he spent in prison, he wrote his third book, &quot;The Rise of the Syrian Nation&quot;, but his manuscript was confiscated, and the authorities refused to return it to him.

===Activity in exile===

He was released from prison in late May 1937. In November 1937, Saadeh founded the newspaper &quot;Al-Nahdhah&quot;. Saadeh led the party until 1938. Then, for the second time, he left the country to establish party branches in the Lebanese communities in South America. Saadeh went to Brazil and founded the newspaper &quot;New Syria&quot;. Soon afterwards, he was arrested by the French colonial authorities and spent two months in prison. In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, Saadeh moved to Argentina, where he remained until 1947. In Argentina, Saadeh continued his activities. He founded &quot;Al-Zawba&#x27;a&quot; (&quot;The Storm&quot;) newspaper and wrote &quot;The Intellectual Conflict in Syrian Literature&quot;, which was printed in Buenos Aires. In 1943, Saadeh married Juliette al-Mir and had three daughters with her. The French colonial court sentenced him &quot;in absentia&quot; to twenty years of imprisonment.

===Return to Lebanon and execution===

Saadeh returned to Lebanon on 2 March 1947, following the country&#x27;s independence from France. After his return, he made a revolutionary speech, upon which the authorities issued an arrest warrant in force for seven months and withdrew. In Lebanon, Saadeh founded the newspaper &quot;Al-Jil Al-Jadid&quot;. On 4 July 1949, the party declared a revolution in Lebanon in retaliation for a series of provocations staged by the government of Lebanon against party members. The revolt was suppressed and Saadeh travelled to Damascus to meet with Husni al-Za&#x27;im, the President of Syria at the time, who had previously agreed to support him. However, he was handed over by al-Zai&#x27;m to the Lebanese authorities. Saadeh and many of his followers were judged by a Lebanese military court and executed by a firing squad, including Saadeh himself. The capture, trial and execution happened in less than 48 hours. Saadeh&#x27;s execution took place at the dawn of 8 July 1949. According to Adel Beshara, it was and still is the shortest and most secretive trial given to a political offender.

His party continued to be active after his death. Saadeh&#x27;s party supported the President of Lebanon Camille Chamoun during the 1958 Lebanon crisis. In 1961, the SSNP attempted a coup d&#x27;état against President Fuad Shihab, which failed. During the 1960s, party leaders were arrested, and the party was eventually splintered into separate factions.

===Syrian Social Nationalist Party===

The SSNP &quot;Zawbaa&quot; (Vortex, Tempest) is a glyph combining the Muslim crescent and the Christian cross, derived from Mesopotamian art. It symbolizes the blood shed by martyrs that makes the wheel of history whirl forward, dissipating the surrounding darkness (representing sectarianism, Ottoman occupation, and the colonial oppression that followed). Within the party, Saadeh gained a cult of personality and at the same time, Saadeh was named the party leader for life. However, according to Haytham, Saadeh stated that European fascism didn&#x27;t influence him. Haytham claims that Saadeh&#x27;s Syrian Social Nationalist ideology aimed at opposite ends.

Saadeh rejected Pan-Arabism (the idea that the speakers of the Arabic language form a single, unified nation) and argued instead for the creation of the state of United Syrian Nation or Natural Syria, encompassing the Fertile Crescent, making up a Syrian homeland that &quot;extends from the Taurus range in the northwest and the Zagros mountains in the northeast to the Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the south and includes the Sinai Peninsula and the Gulf of Aqaba, and from the Syrian Sea in the west (namely the eastern basin of the Mediterranean facing the Levant coastlines), including the island of Cyprus, to the arch of the Arabian Desert and the Persian Gulf in the east.&quot; (Kader, H. A.)

Saadeh rejected both language and religion as defining characteristics of a nation and argued that nations develop through the common development of people inhabiting a specific geographical region. Thus, he was a strong opponent of Arab nationalism and Pan-Islamism. He argued that Syria was historically, culturally, and geographically distinct from the rest of the Arab world, which he divided into four parts. He traced Syrian history as a distinct entity back to the Phoenicians, Canaanites, Assyrians, Babylonians etc. and argued that Syrianism transcended religious distinctions.

Saadeh himself denied these claims of alleged National Socialist and Fascist ideology of his party. During a 1935 speech, Saadeh said: &quot;I want to use this opportunity to say that the system of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party is neither a Hitlerite nor a Fascist one, but a pure social nationalist one. It is not based on useless imitation, but is instead the result of an authentic invention – which is a virtue of our people&quot;.

==Ideology==
===Philosophy===

Saadeh had an holistic notion of science, as &quot;knowledge is that it revolves around the interaction of the self with the surrounding physical conditions&quot; and was against epistemological reductionism, considering that &quot;the self plays an active role in creating the conditions that transform things into objects of knowledge. As a social self, this self is the product of several dynamics – mind, intuition, the practical and existential. It does not depend on one factor and exclude the others.&quot; His whole thought was a refutation of the &quot;individualist doctrine, whether in its sociological or methodological orientations&quot;. For him, the man was a totality by himself as much as in connection with his immediate surrounding, a social being but with his own dignity, which brings him closer to the personalism of someone like Nikolai Berdyaev. In his vision, the society&#x27;s main role was to shape the individual being-as-relation through the Khaldunian notion of assabiya (solidarity), which, through some common features (geography, language, culture, ...) brings out the best in him, but without oppressing his liberties nor negligible either the spiritual or the material aspect, like he witnessed in contemporary ideologies such as communism, fascism or Nazism. Thus, &quot;the concept of man-society is the axis of Sa&#x27;adeh’s theory of human existence. What is meant by this concept is that existence at a human level and existence at a social level are not independent phenomena; rather, they are one phenomenon, two aspects of the same social essence.&quot;

===Nationalism===
He had a regionalist vision of nationalism because he gave some utmost importance to geography: even if he was not an utmost environmental determinist, he thought that a man&#x27;s relation with his milieu involves a particular way of acting because of the different climate, fauna or flora; men will manage their resources differently whether they&#x27;re in mountains or desert, which will also have consequences on their interactions with foreign groups (over the control of the same resources and so on). Thus the notion of the homeland was dear to him. On racialism – which was associated with nationalism in many European ideologies -, &quot;he argued that, contrary to common belief, race is a purely physical concept that has nothing to do with the psychological or social differences between human communities. People differ by their physical features – colour, height, and appearance – and are accordingly divided into races. Nationalism, however, cannot be founded on this reality. Every nation comprises diverse racial groups, and none is the product of one race or one specific tribe.&quot;

===The socio-economic cycle===
Contrarily to Zaki al-Arsuzi and other Arab nationalists who were influenced by European thinkers&#x27; vision of race and language – notably Fichte - Saadeh thus developed his vision, more inclusive and synthetic. It&#x27;s a &quot;dynamic theory of nationalism for the whole society based on the union in life and the socio-economic cycle (...) not deterministic. Land and people are two important ingredients of the nation. Still, they are not the nation themselves (...) is a civilizing theory because it recognizes the necessity and inevitability of interaction between nations (...) the interaction process has two poles: the first, economic possibilities
of the environment, and the second, society’s ability to benefit from such possibilities (...) interaction takes place on two levels: horizontally, which determines the extent and character of regional interaction; and, vertically,
between man and land, out of which a horizontal interaction may or may not occur (...) unlike Marxism, which reduced the economic question to one of class and considered the national question synonymous with the
bourgeoisie, the concept of the socio-economic cycle is a societal concept (...) the mind is a primary factor in human progress. It is a liberating force and a complex entity that should not be viewed from just one
angle. For Sa&#x27;adeh, the mind represents the liberation of human energy and its incorporation into the process of socio-economic interaction.&quot;

<doc id="601222" wikidata="Q2518614" url="?curid=601222" title="Kingsley Wood">
<text>Sir Howard Kingsley Wood (19 August 1881 – 21 September 1943) was a British Conservative politician. The son of a Wesleyan Methodist minister, he qualified as a solicitor, and successfully specialised in industrial insurance. He became a member of the London County Council and then a Member of Parliament.

Wood served as junior minister to Neville Chamberlain at the Ministry of Health, establishing a close personal and political alliance. His first cabinet post was Postmaster General, in which he transformed the British Post Office from a bureaucracy to a business. As Secretary of State for Air in the months before the Second World War he oversaw a huge increase in the production of warplanes to bring Britain up to parity with Germany. When Winston Churchill became Prime Minister in 1940, Wood was made Chancellor of the Exchequer, in which post he adopted policies propounded by John Maynard Keynes, changing the role of HM Treasury from custodian of government income and expenditure to steering the entire British economy.

One of Wood&#x27;s last innovations was the creation of Pay As You Earn, under which income tax is deducted from employees&#x27; current pay, rather than being collected retrospectively. This system remains in force in Britain. Wood died suddenly on the day on which the new system was to be announced to Parliament.

==Early years==
Wood was born in Hull, eldest of three children of the Rev. Arthur Wood, a Wesleyan Methodist minister, and his wife, Harriett Siddons, &quot;née&quot; Howard. His father was appointed to be minister of Wesley&#x27;s Chapel in London, where Wood grew up, attending nearby Central Foundation Boys&#x27; School. He was articled to a solicitor, qualifying in 1903 with honours in his law examinations.

In 1905 Wood married Agnes Lilian Fawcett (d. 1955); there were no biological children of the marriage, but the couple adopted a daughter. Wood established his own law firm in the City of London, specialising in industrial insurance law. He represented the industrial insurance companies in their negotiations with the Liberal government before the introduction of Lloyd George&#x27;s National Insurance Bill in 1911, gaining valuable concessions for his clients.

Wood was first elected to office as a member of the London County Council (LCC) at a by-election on 22 November 1911, representing the Borough of Woolwich for the Municipal Reform Party. His importance in the field of insurance grew over the next few years; his biographer Roy Jenkins has called him &quot;the legal panjandrum of industrial insurance&quot;. He chaired the London Old Age Pension Authority in 1915 and the London Insurance Committee from 1917 to 1918, was a member of the National Insurance Advisory Committee from 1911 to 1919, chairman of the Faculty of Insurance from 1916 to 1919 and president of the faculty in 1920, 1922 and 1923. At the LCC he was a member of the council committees on insurance, pensions and housing. He was knighted in 1918 at the unusually early age of 36. It was not then, as it later became, the practice to state in honours lists the reason for the conferring of an honour, but Jenkins writes that Wood&#x27;s knighthood was essentially for his work in the insurance field.

==Member of Parliament==
Wood was elected to Parliament as a Conservative in the &quot;khaki election&quot; of 1918. His constituency, Woolwich West, was marginal, but he represented it for the rest of his life. Before being elected, he had attracted notice by advocating the establishment of a Ministry of Health; after the election he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary (an unpaid assistant to a minister, a traditional first rung on the political ladder) to the first Minister of Health, Christopher Addison.

After the collapse of the coalition government in 1922, Wood was offered no post in the Conservative government formed by Bonar Law. As a backbencher, Wood successfully introduced the Summer Time Bill of 1924. This measure, passed in the teeth of opposition from the agricultural lobby, provided for a permanent annual summer time period of six months from the first Sunday in April to the first Sunday in October.

When Baldwin succeeded Law in 1924, Wood was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health, as junior minister to Neville Chamberlain. The two served at the Ministry of Health from 11 November 1924 to 4 June 1929, becoming friends and firm political allies. They worked closely together on local government reform, including a radical updating of local taxation, the &quot;rates&quot;, based on property values. Wood&#x27;s political standing was marked by his appointment as a civil commissioner during the general strike of 1926, and, unusually for a junior minister, as a privy councillor in 1928. In 1930 he was elected as the first chairman of the executive committee of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations.

When the National Government was formed by Ramsay MacDonald in 1931, Wood was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education. After the general election of November 1931 he was promoted to the office of Postmaster General. The position did not entail automatic membership of the cabinet, but Wood was made a cabinet member in 1933.

==Ministerial service==

As minister in charge of the General Post Office (GPO), Wood inherited an old-fashioned organisation, not equipped to meet the needs of the 1930s. In particular its management of the national telephone system, a GPO monopoly, was widely criticised. Wood considered reconstituting the whole of the GPO, changing it from a government department to what would later be called a quango, and he set up an independent committee to advise him on this. The committee recommended that the GPO should remain a department of state, but adopt a more commercial approach.

Under Wood the GPO introduced reply paid arrangements for businesses, and set up a national teleprinter service. For the telephone service, still mostly dependent on manual operators, the GPO introduced a programme of building new automated exchanges. For the postal service, the GPO built up a large fleet of motor vehicles to speed delivery, with 3,000 vans and 1,200 motor-cycles. Wood was a strong believer in publicity; he set up an advertising campaign for the telephone system which dramatically increased the number of subscribers, and he established the GPO Film Unit which gained a high aesthetic reputation as well as raising the GPO&#x27;s profile. Most importantly, Wood transformed the senior management of the GPO and negotiated a practical financial deal with HM Treasury. The civil service post of Secretary to the Post Office was replaced by a director general with an expert board of management. The old financial rules, by which all the GPO&#x27;s surplus revenue was surrendered to the Treasury had long prevented reinvestment in the business; Wood negotiated a new arrangement under which the GPO would pay an agreed annual sum to the Treasury and keep the remainder of its revenue for investment.

When MacDonald was succeeded as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom by Baldwin in 1935, Wood was appointed Minister of Health. Despite its title, the Ministry was at that time at least as concerned with housing as with health. Under Wood, his biographer G. C. Peden writes, &quot;the slum clearance programme was pursued with energy, and overcrowding was greatly reduced. There was also a marked improvement in maternal mortality, mainly due to the discovery of antibiotics able to counteract septicaemia, but also because a full-time, salaried midwifery service was created under the Midwives Act of 1936.&quot; Jenkins comments that the housing boom of the 1930s was one of the two main contributors to such economic recovery as there was after the Great Depression.
When Anthony Eden resigned from Chamberlain&#x27;s government in March 1938, Wood moved to be Secretary of State for Air in the ensuing reshuffle. The UK was then producing 80 new warplanes a month. Within two years under Wood the figure had risen to 546 a month. By the outbreak of the Second World War, Britain was producing as many new warplanes as Germany. Wood&#x27;s tenure as Secretary of State for Air coincided with the Phoney War, and during this time he limited RAF activity to dropping propaganda leaflets rather than strategic bombing. When Leo Amery urged him to destroy the Black Forest with incendiary bombs in reaction to the invasion of Poland, he is said to have replied &quot;Are you aware it is private property?... Why, you will be asking me bomb Essen next!&quot; By early 1940, Wood was worn out by his efforts, and Chamberlain moved him to the non-departmental office of Lord Privy Seal, switching the incumbent, Sir Samuel Hoare, to the Air Ministry in Wood&#x27;s place. Wood&#x27;s job was to chair both the Home Policy Committee of the cabinet, which considered &quot;all social service and other domestic questions and reviews proposals for legislation&quot; and the Food Policy Committee, overseeing &quot;the problems of food policy and home agriculture&quot;. He held this position for only a few weeks; the downfall of Chamberlain affected Wood in an unexpected way.

In May 1940, as a trusted friend, Wood told Chamberlain &quot;affectionately but firmly&quot; that after the debacle of the British defeat in Norway and the ensuing Commons debate, his position as Prime Minister was impossible and he must resign. He also advised Winston Churchill to ignore pressure from those who wanted Lord Halifax, not Churchill, as Chamberlain&#x27;s successor. Chamberlain agreed to resign on 9 May, but considered going back on his decision the next day as the German attack on the Western Front had begun; Wood told him that he had to go through with his resignation. Both men acted on Wood&#x27;s advice. Churchill became Prime Minister on 10 May 1940; Wood was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer on 12 May.

==Chancellorship of the Exchequer and death==
One of the reasons for Wood&#x27;s appointment to the Treasury seems to have been Churchill&#x27;s urgent desire to be rid of the incumbent Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Simon, whom Churchill detested. Another may have been Wood&#x27;s record of working well with politicians from other parties. In peacetime, the Chancellor of the Exchequer is often the most important member of the cabinet after the Prime Minister, but the exigencies of the war reduced the Chancellor&#x27;s precedence. The Treasury temporarily ceased to be the core department of government. In Peden&#x27;s words, &quot;Non-military aspects of policy, including economic policy, were co-ordinated by a cabinet committee … The Treasury&#x27;s main jobs were to finance the war with as little inflation as possible, to conduct external financial policy so as to secure overseas supplies on the best possible terms, and to take part in planning for the post-war period.&quot;

Wood was Chancellor, as Jenkins notes, &quot;for the forty key months of the Second World War&quot;. He presented four budgets to Parliament. His first, in July 1940, passed with little notice, and brought into effect some minor changes planned by his predecessor. Of more long-lasting impact was his creation in the same month of a council of economic advisers, the most notable of whom, John Maynard Keynes, was quickly recruited as a full-time adviser at the Treasury. Jenkins detects Keynes&#x27;s influence in Wood&#x27;s second budget, in April 1941. It brought in a top income tax rate of 19s 6d (97½ pence in decimal currency) and added two million to the number of income tax payers; for the first time in Britain&#x27;s history the majority of the population was liable to income tax. Keynes convinced Wood that he should abandon the orthodox Treasury doctrine that Chancellors&#x27; budgets were purely to regulate governmental revenue and expenditure; Wood, despite some misgivings on Churchill&#x27;s part, adopted Keynes&#x27;s conception of using national income accounting to control the economy.

With the hugely increased public expenditure necessitated by the war – it increased sixfold between 1938 and 1943 – inflation was always a danger. Wood sought to head off inflationary wage claims by subsidising essential rationed goods, while imposing heavy taxes on goods classed as non-essential. The last change he pioneered as Chancellor was the system of Pay As You Earn (PAYE), by which income tax is deducted from current pay rather than paid retrospectively on past years&#x27; earnings. He did not live to see it come into effect; he died suddenly at his London home on the morning of the day on which he was due to announce PAYE in the House of Commons. He was 62.

Wood was referred to in the book &quot;Guilty Men&quot; by Michael Foot, Frank Owen and Peter Howard (writing under the pseudonym &quot;Cato&quot;), published in 1940 as an attack on public figures for their failure to re-arm and their appeasement of Nazi Germany.

<text>Margate is a small seaside town on the Channel Highway between North-West Bay and the Snug Tiers, south of Kingston in Tasmania, Australia. It is mostly in the Kingborough Council area, with about 4% in the Huon Valley Council LGA. Margate is also part of the Greater Hobart statistical area.

==Location and features==
At the 2006 census, Margate had a population of 1,368, although more people live in the immediate region around the town. Margate is part of the Kingborough Council and is a frequent stop for those travelling south towards Snug, Kettering or Bruny Island. Vineyards, grazing fields and stands of trees surround the town and its approaches. The town itself has a range of shops, schools and religious buildings as well as several notable features, including the Dru Point Bicentennial Park on the edge of North-West Bay.

Recent history has seen Margate strongly affected by the building boom of the early 2000s with new housing developments in almost all directions. This in some ways reflects demographic themes within the population. A fair percentage of the population commute into the greater Hobart area while the rest are employed locally in either the service industry or commercial enterprises such as the Tassal fish factory or the Austal shipyard. Margate Primary School has been declared a &quot;big winner&quot; from the 2009 Australian federal budget, receiving $2.5 million for new buildings. However the local ABC Learning centre narrowly avoided closure. More recently the residents of Margate were found by the &quot;Sunday Tasmanian&#x27;s&quot; National Health Test, to be the &quot;happiest in the state&quot;.

At the northern approach to Margate, just east of the Channel Highway is the final resting place of Tasmanian Government Railways M class locomotive MA3, also known as the Margate Train. The locomotive is &quot;plinthed&quot; near a former Henry Jones IXL apple barn that is now a second hand and antique warehouse. The locomotive has a number of carriages which serve as retail outlets and a pancake cafe.

Margate is also home to the Channel Heritage Centre, a museum telling the history of life in the region around the D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Channel.

==History==
In 1792 Bruni D&#x27;Entrecasteaux sailed up the channel now bearing his name, charting the coastline and naming features. He named the large bay at the top of the channel North West Bay. The expedition anchored there to collect fresh water and many Aboriginal Tasmanians were observed in the area. In January 1802, the French explorer, Nicolas Baudin anchored in the bay to collect fresh water, food and wood. An observatory was set up on a small island at the mouth of the North West Bay River to observe a solar eclipse and a number of Aboriginal people were encountered during the expedition&#x27;s stay. Baudin&#x27;s two ships were forced to remain in the bay because of adverse wind conditions and did not leave until 17 February 1802.

The original Margate township was along Beach Road because coal burning steamers would bring all the supplies by sea. Margate Post Office opened on 1 July 1866, and the primary school opened in 1869. From 1906 to 1922, the Sandfly Colliery Tramway ran from Margate Wharf to the coal mine at Kaoota. The jetty was about long, and could service ships drawing .

In June to July 2016, the town held a week of celebrations and festivals to celebrate 150 years since it was gazetted.

<text>This is a list of Bishops, Metropolitans, and Archbishops of [[Athens]]. The Church of Athens was created by Paul the Apostle during his second missionary journey, when he preached at the Areopagus, probably in 51 AD. According to the Acts of the Apostles (17:16–34), after the sermon, many became followers of Paul, thus forming the kernel of the Church in Athens. The see of Athens has been unilaterally declared autocephalous on 4 August 1833 (officially recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople on 11 July 1850) and was elevated to an archbishopric on 31 December 1923. As the head of the Church of Greece, the holder has styled Archbishop of Athens and All Greece (Αρχιεπίσκοπος Αθηνών και πάσης Ελλάδος).

<doc id="601240" wikidata="Q7449101" url="?curid=601240" title="Semantic theory of truth">
<text>A semantic theory of truth is a theory of truth in the philosophy of language which holds that truth is a property of sentences.

==Origin==

The semantic conception of truth, which is related in different ways to both the correspondence and deflationary conceptions, is due to work by Polish logician Alfred Tarski. Tarski, in &quot;On the Concept of Truth in Formal Languages&quot; (1935), attempted to formulate a new theory of truth in order to resolve the liar paradox. In the course of this he made several metamathematical discoveries, most notably Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem using the same formal technique Kurt Gödel used in his incompleteness theorems. Roughly, this states that a truth-predicate satisfying Convention T for the sentences of a given language cannot be defined &quot;within&quot; that language.

==Tarski&#x27;s theory of truth==

To formulate linguistic theories without semantic paradoxes such as the liar paradox, it is generally necessary to distinguish the language that one is talking about (the &quot;object language&quot;) from the language that one is using to do the talking (the &quot;metalanguage&quot;). In the following, quoted text is use of the object language, while unquoted text is use of the metalanguage; a quoted sentence (such as &quot;&quot;P&quot;) is always the metalanguage&#x27;s &quot;name&quot; for a sentence, such that this name is simply the sentence &quot;P&quot; rendered in the object language. In this way, the metalanguage can be used to talk about the object language; Tarski&#x27;s theory of truth (Alfred Tarski 1935) demanded that the object language be contained in the metalanguage.
Tarski&#x27;s material adequacy condition, also known as Convention T, holds that any viable theory of truth must entail, for every sentence &quot;P&quot;&quot;, a sentence of the following form (known as &quot;form (T)&quot;):

(1) &quot;P&quot; is true if, and only if, P.

For example,

(2) &#x27;snow is white&#x27; is true if and only if snow is white.

These sentences (1 and 2, etc.) have come to be called the &quot;T-sentences&quot;. The reason they look trivial is that the object language and the metalanguage are both English; here is an example where the object language is German and the metalanguage is English:

(3) &#x27;Schnee ist weiß&#x27; is true if and only if snow is white.

It is important to note that as Tarski originally formulated it, this theory applies only to formal languages, cf. also semantics of first-order logic. He gave a number of reasons for not extending his theory to natural languages, including the problem that there is no systematic way of deciding whether a given sentence of a natural language is well-formed, and that a natural language is &quot;closed&quot; (that is, it can describe the semantic characteristics of its own elements). But Tarski&#x27;s approach was extended by Davidson into an approach to theories of &quot;meaning&quot; for natural languages, which involves treating &quot;truth&quot; as a primitive, rather than a defined, concept. (See truth-conditional semantics.)

Tarski developed the theory to give an inductive definition of truth as follows. (See T-schema)

For a language &quot;L&quot; containing ¬ (&quot;not&quot;), ∧ (&quot;and&quot;), ∨ (&quot;or&quot;), ∀ (&quot;for all&quot;), and ∃ (&quot;there exists&quot;), Tarski&#x27;s inductive definition of truth looks like this:

* (1) A primitive statement &quot;A&quot; is true if, and only if, &quot;A&quot;.
* (2) &quot;¬&quot;A&quot; is true if, and only if, &quot;A&quot; is not true.
* (3) &quot;A&quot;∧&quot;B&quot; is true if, and only if, &quot;A&quot; is true&quot; and &quot;&quot;B&quot; is true&quot;.
* (4) &quot;&quot;A&quot;∨&quot;B&quot; is true if, and only if, &quot;A&quot; is true&quot; or &quot;&quot;B&quot; is true&quot; or (&quot;&quot;A&quot; is true&quot; and &quot;&quot;B&quot; is true&quot;).
* (5) &quot;∀&quot;x&quot;(&quot;Fx&quot;)&quot; is true if, and only if, for all objects x, &quot;Fx&quot; is true.
* (6) &quot;∃&quot;x&quot;(&quot;Fx&quot;)&quot; is true if, and only if, there is an object &quot;x&quot; for which &quot;Fx&quot; is true.

These explain how the truth conditions of &quot;complex&quot; sentences (built up from connectives and quantifiers) can be reduced to the truth conditions of their constituents. The simplest constituents are atomic sentences. A contemporary semantic definition of truth would define truth for the atomic sentences as follows:

* An atomic sentence &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is true (relative to an assignment of values to the variables &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;)) if the corresponding values of variables bear the relation expressed by the predicate &quot;F&quot;.

Tarski himself defined truth for atomic sentences in a variant way that does not use any technical terms from semantics, such as the &quot;expressed by&quot; above. This is because he wanted to define these semantic terms in the context of truth. Therefore it would be circular to use one of them in the definition of truth itself. Tarski&#x27;s semantic conception of truth plays an important role in modern logic and also in contemporary philosophy of language. It is a rather controversial point whether Tarski&#x27;s semantic theory should be counted either as a correspondence theory or as a deflationary theory.

==Kripke&#x27;s theory of truth==
Kripke&#x27;s theory of truth (Saul Kripke 1975) is based on partial logic (a logic of partially defined truth predicates instead of Tarski&#x27;s logic of totally defined truth predicates) with the strong Kleene evaluation scheme.

<text>John Sterling (&quot;né&quot; Sloss; born July 4, 1938) is an American retired sportscaster, best known as the radio play-by-play announcer of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball from 1989 to 2024. Sterling called 5,060 consecutive Yankees games from 1989 to 2019.

==Early life==
Sterling was born John Sloss in New York City and grew up on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, the son of advertising executive Carl H. T. Sloss. Sterling is Jewish. He briefly attended Moravian College, Boston University, and the Columbia University School of General Studies before leaving school to begin his career in radio at a small station in Wellsville, New York.

==Broadcasting career==

===Early career===
He changed his name to Sterling and began his broadcasting career in Baltimore, where he served as the play-by-play announcer for the then-Baltimore Bullets for the 1970–71 NBA season. He also did play-by-play for Morgan State University football, a role that he held from 1971 to 1978.

Sterling came to New York broadcasting as a talk show host with WMCA in 1971. He later served as the radio voice for the WHA&#x27;s New York Raiders, the WFL&#x27;s New York Stars, the NHL&#x27;s New York Islanders (where he was paired with Bob Lawrence), and the ABA/NBA&#x27;s New York/New Jersey Nets (where he was paired mainly with Mike DeTomasso). Sterling also did a stretch with the Yankees as pre-game host on WMCA and WINS radio, as well as co-host on cable segments with Mel Allen.

From 1975 through 1980, Sterling announced Nets and Islanders games for WMCA, WVNJ, WOR-TV, and SportsChannel New York, continuing his WMCA talk program until 1978. After his initial stint in New York, Sterling spent nine years in Atlanta hosting a sports call-in show on WSB radio and covering the Braves (1982–1987) and Hawks (1981–1989) for Turner Sports.

===New York Yankees (1989–2024)===
In 1989, Sterling returned to New York to broadcast the games for the Yankees on WABC radio. In 2013, the Yankees announced a move to WFAN for ten years, and Sterling was retained. His announcing partners were Jay Johnstone (1989–1990), Joe Angel (1991), Michael Kay (1992–2001), Charley Steiner (2002–2004), and Suzyn Waldman (2002–2024).

Sterling called 5,060 consecutive games for the Yankees from 1989 until he took four games off from July 4 until July 7, 2019. This included all 2,747 regular season and 158 postseason games played by Derek Jeter. On October 18, 2021, Sterling signed a new contract with WFAN for 2022 with the potential for a reduced schedule. On June 6, 2022, Sterling announced that he would start working on a reduced schedule in the second half of the MLB season, primarily taking time off from traveling to road games outside of the northeastern United States. He continued to do road trips to Fenway Park, Citi Field, and Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

On September 20, 2018, as part of a promotion called &quot;Rivalry in the Booth&quot;, Sterling and Red Sox radio broadcaster Joe Castiglione switched places in the fourth inning. From June 29–30, 2019, Sterling called the first MLB games played in Europe.

Sterling was also host of the YES Network&#x27;s &quot;Yankeeography&quot; series from 2002 to 2013, which produced biographies of New York Yankees. Among several nominations, Sterling has received two Emmy Awards for the series. He also hosted the introductions and recaps for Yankees Classics. In addition, Sterling had a nightly commentary feature on WCBS newscasts called &quot;Sterling on Sports&quot;, in which he gave his take on a recent sporting event or sports news item. This commentary aired nightly during the 6:15 pm sports report.

Sterling and former broadcasting partner Michael Kay commonly worked together representing the Yankees. They announced the annual Yankees&#x27; Old-Timers&#x27; Day. They presided at the &quot;Key to the City&quot; ceremonies following Yankee World Series victories in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009. The pair often served as masters of ceremonies on and off the field for major Yankee events, including the 2000 ticker-tape parade held in the Yankees&#x27; honor after their World Series win. Sterling has emceed several Yankees pre-game ceremonies including the number retirements of Jorge Posada, Andy Pettitte, Bernie Williams, Joe Torre, Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera&#x27;s number retirement in 2013 and Monument Park induction (2016), and the 20th anniversary of the Yankees&#x27; 1996 World Series victory in 2016. His long association with the Yankees earned him the nickname &quot;Pa Pinstripe&quot; from &quot;New York Daily News&quot; writer Bob Raissman.

Sterling announced his retirement on April 15, 2024, effective immediately, saying he was tired of traveling. The Yankees honored Sterling before their game on April 20. He did return to call two innings of the game against the Cleveland Guardians on August 20, in celebration of a team T-shirt giveaway intended the celebrate the 20th year Sterling and Waldman worked together in the radio booth, (which was planned before his abrupt retirement). Sterling called the fourth and fifth innings of the game. The following Thursday it was announced Sterling was discussing a potential postseason return, then a final retirement. On September 5, Sterling confirmed he would return to the booth for the final homestand on September 24–26 and the playoffs, including up to the 2024 World Series where he would broadcast for the last time. Sterling made his final broadcast on October 30, 2024, in Game 5 of the World Series when the Yankees lost to the Dodgers.

===Other work===
From 2013 through 2017 Sterling announced the Kitten Bowl on the Hallmark Channel.

On December 16, 2018, Sterling called the Brooklyn NetsAtlanta Hawks game on the YES Network.

==Announcing mannerisms==
Sterling has several idiosyncrasies that mark his broadcasts as distinctive, very unusual, if also divisive. In addition to a colorful vocal personality, Sterling has distinguished himself for sometimes characterizing plays differently than they may appear and for his announcing errors, habits that spark high feelings in fans and lead to comparisons with announcers like Phil Rizzuto.
Following the final out of a Yankees victory, Sterling calls &quot;Ballgame over! Yankees win! Theeeeeee Yankees win!&quot; The length of the word &quot;the&quot; is held longer after dramatic victories, as well as after victories resulting in championships (which Sterling also punctuates by saying the name of whichever series is over). It has been played over the public address system at Yankee Stadium after every Yankees victory for the past several seasons, right before Frank Sinatra&#x27;s cover of &quot;Theme from New York, New York&quot; is played. The phrase evolved from Sterling&#x27;s call of Mel Hall&#x27;s game-winning three-run homer in the ninth inning on May 27, 1991, to give the Yankees a dramatic Memorial Day win over the Boston Red Sox.

One of his signature radio remarks is his home run call &quot;It is high, it is far, it is gone!&quot; Sterling is known for devising a personalized home run catchphrase for every Yankee player.

For back to back home runs, especially homers from opposite sides of the plate, Sterling references Harry Belafonte&#x27;s &quot;Zombie Jamboree&quot; by saying &quot;it&#x27;s a back to back! ... and a belly to belly!&quot; In addition, sometimes before a pitch he will say &quot;theeeeeee pitch&quot;, lengthening the word &quot;the&quot;. If a batter swings and misses, Sterling will often say &quot;cuuuuut on-and-missed&quot;, elongating the word &quot;cut&quot;, followed by &quot;on-n-miss&quot; pronounced as one quick word. After a strikeout swinging, he says &quot;STRUCK HIM OUT SWINGING!&quot;, and for a strikeout looking he calls &quot;STRIIIIKE THREE!&quot;, elongating the &#x27;I&#x27; in strike.

In all cases when Sterling emphasizes the word &quot;the&quot;, as is one of his signatures, he uses not the long ē (&quot;thee&quot;) but the schwa ə (&quot;thuh&quot;).

==Criticism==
Sterling&#x27;s style of play calling is heavily criticized in the media. He is regularly criticized by Craig Carton and Phil Mushnick for his inaccurate calls. Jim Norton of &quot;The Opie and Anthony Show&quot; routinely mocked Sterling&#x27;s player nicknames and his emphasis on the &quot;mmm&quot; sound before saying &quot;mmm-it is high, mmm-it is far. ...&quot;

==Awards and honors==
Sterling has won 12 Emmy Awards during his career, including two for &quot;Yankeeography&quot;.

In 2024, following his retirement, he was nominated as a finalist for the Ford C. Frick Award from the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The award went to Tom Hamilton instead.

==Personal life==
Sterling is a resident of Edgewater, New Jersey. He had previously resided in Teaneck, New Jersey. He was divorced in 2008 after 12 years of marriage to wife, Jennifer and is the father of four, including a set of triplets, born in 2000. In January 2015, he was among hundreds of displaced residents after a fire destroyed the Avalon at Edgewater complex building.

In August 2020, Sterling was hospitalized for a blood infection.

On September 1, 2021, after calling a Yankees game remotely from Yankee Stadium, Sterling was stranded in his car about a mile from his home in Edgewater by flooding following Hurricane Ida. Spanish-language Yankees broadcaster Rickie Ricardo, also an Edgewater resident, was driving his Jeep Cherokee home and rescued Sterling.

On June 10, 2023, while broadcasting a game against the Boston Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, Sterling was hit in the head by a foul ball off the bat of Justin Turner. He continued broadcasting and returned to the booth the following night.

<text>Richard Gilbert Emery (19 February 19152 January 1983) was an English comedian and comic actor. His broadcasting career began on radio in the 1950s, and his self-titled television series ran from 1963 to 1981.

==Life and career==
Richard Gilbert Emery was born 19 February 1915, in University College Hospital, Bloomsbury, London. His parents were the comedy double act Callan and Emery. They took him on tour when he was only three weeks old and gave him the occasional turn on the stage during his childhood, which was always on the move and disrupted, creating problems for the future but setting the scene for eventually going into showbusiness himself. His parents split up when he was eight and he chose to stay with his mother, who gave up showbusiness. He tried a variety of jobs before the stage: mechanic, office boy, farm hand and driving instructor.

During the Second World War he was called up to the RAF and rose to the rank of corporal. However, because of family problems, he returned to London, joining the chorus line of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; at the Majestic Theatre, although he was subsequently recognised, arrested and imprisoned. He was recruited by Ralph Reader into the RAF Gang Show to entertain air and ground crew at bases in Great Britain.

At this time he created Vera Thin (the Forces&#x27; Sweetheart), loosely based on Vera Lynn, later saying, &quot;I was better in drag than combat gear&quot;. After D-Day, his unit toured forward airbases.

On leaving the RAF, he returned to the theatre as a comedian. He worked at the Windmill Theatre, though his name does not appear on the plaque commemorating the acts that played there. He toured his fledgling act around the United Kingdom.

He also auditioned for various parts and in 1952 he starred in a role in a 15-minute Radio Luxembourg series on Saturdays at 7.00pm called &quot;Chance of a Lifetime&quot;. This was a quiz sponsored by Marshall Ward in which merchandise to the value of £30 was awarded to contestants. Other radio work around this time included several appearances on &quot;Workers&#x27; Playtime&quot; on the BBC, a morale-boosting show that had started during the war to entertain factory workers in their canteens. Emery also made a guest appearance on the popular BBC radio programme &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, replacing regular cast member Harry Secombe for one episode in 1957.

During 1953 he briefly formed a double act with Charlie Drake. His television debut came in 1950 on &quot;The Centre Show&quot; on the BBC. He appeared on TV programmes including &quot;Round the Bend&quot; (BBC, 1955–56) and &quot;Educating Archie&quot; (ITV, 1958–59) and appeared with his friend Tony Hancock in several episodes of &quot;The Tony Hancock Show&quot; (ITV, 1956) and &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; (BBC, 1957).

He enhanced his reputation on two series with former Goon Michael Bentine: &quot;After Hours&quot; (ITV, 1958–59) and &quot;It&#x27;s a Square World&quot; (BBC, 1960–64). His role as Private Chubby Catchpole in the final series of &quot;The Army Game&quot;, (ITV 1960) led to an exclusive BBC contract, and the long-running &quot;The Dick Emery Show&quot; (BBC, 1963–81) began. The show involved Emery dressing up as various characters, lasted 18 series totalling 166 episodes aired between 1963 and 1981.

In a sporadic film career he made his debut in the Goons&#x27; &quot;The Case of the Mukkinese Battle Horn&quot; (directed by Joseph Sterling, 1954). He also played bungling bank robber Booky Binns in &quot;The Big Job&quot; (directed by Gerald Thomas, 1965) and was known for vocal talents as an array of characters including &quot;The Nowhere Man&quot; Jeremy Hillary Boob, the Mayor of Pepperland and Max, one of the Blue Meanies in the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; directed by George Dunning, in 1968.

Emery appeared in films as Shingler in &quot;The Fast Lady&quot; (1962), as Peter Sellers&#x27;s neighbour in &quot;The Wrong Arm Of The Law&quot;, as Harry in &quot;Baby Love&quot; (1968), as Mr Bateman in &quot;Loot&quot; (1970) and &quot;Ooh… You Are Awful&quot; (1972), in which he played many of the characters he had portrayed in his TV series. The plot of this comedy centred on Emery hunting down a bank account number. The digits of the number are tattooed on the bottoms of four young women. Emery has to see the girls naked, which requires disguises. One of the women is played by Liza Goddard.

Emery also recorded several novelty records, most notably &quot;If You Love Her&quot;, which reached number 32 in 1969, and &quot;You Are Awful&quot;, which just missed the top 40 in 1973. Other singles included &quot;A Cockney Christmas&quot; (1962), &quot;You&#x27;re The Only One&quot; (1974) and &quot;Rocking Horse Cowboy&quot; (1979). In 1979, Emery moved to ITV for three specials before returning to the BBC in 1980 and resuming &quot;The Dick Emery Show&quot;.

By 1982, Emery was tiring of the format for his BBC series and wanted to do something different. Using a new format and character, Jewish private detective Bernie Weinstock, Emery had a new outlet – two series of comedy thrillers under the banner &quot;Emery Presents&quot; (BBC, 1982–83), &quot;Legacy of Murder&quot; and &quot;Jack of Diamonds&quot;.

==Personal life==

Emery had a very difficult childhood initially, but things settled down following the departure of his father, Laurie Howe. He was devoted to his mother for most of his life and helped support her once he was able to work. This devotion caused problems in his marriages.

He was in six long-term relationships, marrying five times, and also had numerous affairs. He often appeared in tabloid newspapers with beautiful women.

At the beginning of the Second World War he married Joan (sometimes known as Zelda) Sainsbury and had one son, Gilbert Richard. After the failure of that marriage, he married Irene (Pip) Ansell but the marriage barely lasted six months. While working in summer season in 1950, at the Winter Gardens in Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, he met Iris Margaret Tully, who was also in the show. At the end of the season, they returned to London and set up home together in Iris&#x27; flat in Shaftesbury Avenue. Iris changed her name to Emery by deed poll until 1955, a year after she had given birth to his second son, Nicholas William. Emery and she married in 1955.

The marriage was a rocky one because Emery had several affairs while away on tour. He met the woman who became his fourth wife, Victoria Chambers, in the mid-1950s. He was torn between the two women, but in late 1958 he left Iris and moved to Thames Ditton in Surrey to set up home.

In 1960, however, he returned to Iris and his son and moved them to Thames Ditton, but he could never settle, and in 1962 he left Iris for Victoria. Iris divorced him in 1964. By this time, he had set up home in Esher. Vickie had a son Michael and a daughter Eliza with him. His last wife was Josephine Blake to whom he was still married at the time of his death, although he had left her to live with Fay Hillier, an actress 30 years his junior.

Outside showbusiness, he enjoyed flying, and held a pilot&#x27;s licence from 1961 onwards. He also liked fast cars and motorcycles. He was a keen maker of scale models, and was president of the Airfix Modellers&#x27; Club. He also wrote a review feature for &quot;Meccano Magazine&quot; during 1971.

While the public took him to heart, voting him BBC TV Personality of the Year in 1972, Emery suffered from severe stage fright and low self-esteem. He underwent psychoanalysis and hypnosis, and took sedatives to try to cure the problems.

He had four children, Gilbert, Nicholas, Michael and Eliza, and was the half-brother of actress Ann Emery.

==Death==
In December 1982, Emery was taken to a London hospital with severe chest pains. He died at the hospital from cardiorespiratory failure on 2 January 1983 at the age of 67.

<text>Tritonal is a mixture of 80% TNT and 20% aluminium powder, used in several types of ordnance such as air-dropped bombs. The aluminium increases the total heat output and hence impulse of the TNT – the length of time during which the blast wave is positive. Tritonal is approximately 18% more powerful than TNT alone.

The 87 kg of tritonal in a Mark 82 bomb has the potential to produce approximately 863 MJ of energy when detonated. This implies a specific energy of approximately 9 MJ/kg, compared to ~4 MJ/kg for TNT.

== History ==
TNT was first prepared by Julius Wilbrand in 1863. Germany began manufacturing TNT in 1891 and aluminium was first mixed with TNT in 1899 to produce an explosive compound. In 1902, the German Army began to use TNT, replacing picric acid, and in 1912, the US Army also started to use TNT. TNT production was limited by the availability of toluene which came from coal tar. Therefore, mixtures of TNT with other compounds became widespread to relieve the shortage of TNT.

Modern tritonal was developed as a cheaper substitute for Torpex and HBX under UWE designation (UnderWater Explosive) before it turned out Allies could produce enough RDX to cover all naval requirements late in WWII.

<doc id="601255" wikidata="Q4556636" url="?curid=601255" title="1892 Republican National Convention">
<text>The 1892 Republican National Convention was held at the Industrial Exposition Building, Minneapolis, Minnesota, from June 7 to June 10, 1892. The party nominated President Benjamin Harrison for re-election on the first ballot and Whitelaw Reid of New York for vice president.

James S. Clarkson of Iowa was the outgoing chairman of the Republican National Committee. J. Sloat Fassett of New York was the temporary chairman, and Governor William McKinley of Ohio was the permanent chair of the convention.

James G. Blaine, Harrison&#x27;s Secretary of State who had resigned from the cabinet on June 4, 1892, had his name submitted for consideration by the delegates on the eve of the convention but drew little support. Governor McKinley barely edged out Blaine for second place among the delegates.

Although successful in his bid for re-nomination, President Harrison&#x27;s performance was underwhelming for an incumbent, due in part to the crushing defeat that the party had suffered in the 1890 midterm elections. He and Reid would lose the 1892 general election to former president Grover Cleveland and his running mate Adlai Stevenson.

The 1892 RNC was also the first convention where women were allowed to be delegates. Therese Alberta (Parkinson) Jenkins, delegate from Wyoming, cast the first vote by a woman for president; Wyoming had granted full suffrage for women at statehood in 1890.

==Preconvention==
Benjamin Harrison lost the support of Mark Hanna and Thomas Brackett Reed due to his patronage decisions. Hanna was the treasurer of the Republican National Committee and raised significant funds for Harrison in 1888. Matthew Quay gave his support to the anti-Harrison movement as he felt Harrison accepted his resignation as chair of the RNC too quickly. Thomas C. Platt was critical of Harrison for not making him Secretary of the Treasury.

Quay, James S. Clarkson, and other Republicans attempted to have James G. Blaine run, but Blaine announced that he would not on February 1, 1892. Anti-Harrison Republicans considered supporting Russell A. Alger, Shelby M. Cullom, William McKinley, Reed, Whitelaw Reid, and John Sherman.

Henry W. Blair, a former U.S. senator from New Hampshire, declared his candidacy in February 1892. Quay supported McKinley at the convention.

Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio sent uninstructed delegations.

==Convention==
On November 22, 1891, the RNC voted on the seventh ballot to have Minneapolis host the convention. Cincinnati, New York City, Omaha, and San Francisco also made bids to host it.

Many of Blaine&#x27;s old supporters encouraged him to run for the nomination. Blaine had denied any interest in the nomination months before his resignation, but some of his friends, including Quay and Clarkson took it for false modesty and worked for his nomination anyway. Blaine resigned as Secretary of State on June 4, three days before the convention. This led to many Republicans believing that he would seek the nomination. Blaine&#x27;s sister-in-law Mary Abigail Dodge wrote in her biography of him that his resignation was not due to an interest in the nomination.

Harrison wanted McKinley to place his name up for nomination, but McKinley declined to answer if he would. Louis T. Michener asked McKinley at the convention if he would support Harrison, but he declined to answer. Hanna, who was a delegate to the convention, opened an unofficial headquarters for McKinley at a nearby hotel and committed the Ohio delegation for him. Harrison&#x27;s allies arranged for McKinley to become chair of the convention where he would be forced to play a neutral role. Quay praised this plan stating that it would make &quot;it impossible for McKinley to Garfield the convention&quot;.

Blaine was nominated by Colorado delegate Edward O. Wolcott, Harrison by Indiana delegate Richard W. Thompson. Warner Miller seconded Blaine&#x27;s nomination and Chauncey Depew seconded Harrison&#x27;s nomination. McKinley attempted to have the convention nominate Harrison by acclamation, but withdrew his proposal due to opposition. Harrison won the nomination on the first ballot. The convention later voted to make his nomination unanimous. McKinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him.

On July 27, Clarkson, who opposed Harrison&#x27;s renomination, was replaced as chair of the RNC by William James Campbell. Campbell resigned on July 6, and Thomas H. Carter was selected to replace him on July 16.

===Vice presidential nomination===
No Republican vice president was renominated for a second term at the time of the convention. Vice President Levi P. Morton did not campaign for renomination. Morton was dumped from the ticket, as Harrison was not particularly fond of Morton, who was closer to Blaine supporters; Morton himself was not interested in serving another term as vice president in any event, having been persuaded by his confidantes to run for governor of New York at the next scheduled election in 1894.

Reid was nominated by Edmund O&#x27;Connor and seconded by Horace Porter. Reed was nominated by Josiah T. Settle and seconded by C.M. Louthan. However, Maine&#x27;s delegation stated that Reed was not interested in the nomination. Reid won the nomination with a unanimous vote.

==Platform==

The Republican platform supported high tariffs, bimetallism, stiffer immigration laws, free rural mail delivery, and a canal across Central America. It also expressed sympathy for the Irish Home Rule Movement and the plight of Jews under persecution in czarist Russia.

<doc id="601262" wikidata="Q119132772" url="?curid=601262" title="Balangiga massacre">
<text>The Balangiga massacre was an incident in which the residents of the town of Balangiga on the island of Samar conducted a surprise attack on an occupying unit of the US 9th Infantry, killing 54. The incident is also known as the Balangiga encounter, Balangiga incident, or Balangiga conflict. The incident occurred on September 28, 1901, over five months after the April 19 publication of a &quot;Peace Manifesto&quot; by Emilio Aguinaldo acknowledging and accepting the sovereignty of the United States throughout the Philippines. Some Filipino historians have asserted that the term &quot;Balangiga Massacre&quot; more appropriately refers to actions ordered in retaliation by American General Jacob H. Smith during the pacification of Samar that resulted in an estimated 2,000 Filipino civilians killed and over 200 homes burned.

==Background==
The battle was a military operation planned by Captain Eugenio Daza (an area commander of Captain General Vicente Lukbán&#x27;s forces in southeastern Samar) and transpired in Balangiga in 1901 during the Philippine–American War. The attack was led by Valeriano Abanador, who was the &quot;Jefe de la Policía&quot; (Chief of Police).

==The operation==

===Prelude===
Samar was a major center for the production of Manila hemp, the trade of which was financing Philippine forces on the island. At the same time United States interests were eager to secure control of the hemp trade, which was a vital material both for the United States Navy and American agro-industries such as cotton.

Filipino forces in the area were under the command of Captain General Vicente Lukbán who had been sent there in December 1898 to govern the island on behalf of the First Philippine Republic under Emilio Aguinaldo. Aguinaldo had been captured by American forces on March 23, 1901. On April 1, he had sworn allegiance to the US and told his followers to lay down their arms and give up the fight.

On May 30, 1901, prior to the stationing of any Americans in Balangiga, town mayor Pedro Abayan had written to Lukban pledging to &quot;observe a deceptive policy with [Americans] doing whatever they may like, and when a favorable opportunity arises, the people will strategically rise against them.&quot;

In the summer of 1901, Brigadier General Robert P. Hughes, who commanded the Department of the Visayas and was responsible for Samar, instigated an aggressive policy of food deprivation and property destruction on the island. The objective was to force the end of Philippine resistance. Part of his strategy was to close three key ports on the southern coast, Basey, Balangiga and Guiuan prevent supplies from reaching Lukban&#x27;s forces in the interior. Company C was to close the port at Balangiga.

On August 11, 1901, Company C of the 9th US Infantry Regiment, arrived in Balangiga—the third largest town on the southern coast of Samar island—to close its port and prevent supplies reaching Philippine forces in the interior, Abaya&#x27;s letter to Lukban had been among papers captured by American troops on August 18; it read, in translation:

However, this information never reached the American troops in Balangiga.

Relations between the soldiers and the townspeople seemed amicable for the first month of the American presence in the town; indeed it was marked by extensive fraternization between the two parties. This took the form of &quot;tuba&quot; (palm wine) drinking among the soldiers and male villagers, baseball games, and arnis demonstrations. However, tensions rose due to several reasons: Captain Thomas W. Connell, commanding officer of the American unit in Balangiga, ordered the town cleaned up in preparation for a visit by the US Army&#x27;s inspector-general. However, in complying with his directive, the townspeople inadvertently cut down vegetation with food value, in violation of Lukbán&#x27;s policies regarding food security. As a consequence, on September 18, 1901, around 400 guerrillas sent by Lukbán appeared in the vicinity of Balangiga. They were to mete sanctions upon the town officials and local residents for violating Lukbán&#x27;s orders regarding food security and for fraternizing with the Americans. The threat was probably defused by Captain Eugenio Daza, a member of Lukbán&#x27;s staff, and by the parish priest, Father Donato Guimbaolibot.

A few days later, Connell had the town&#x27;s male residents rounded up and detained for the purpose of hastening his clean-up operations. Around 80 men were kept in two Sibley tents unfed overnight. In addition, Connell had the men&#x27;s bolos and the stored rice for their tables confiscated. These events sufficiently insulted and angered the townspeople, and they planned revenge against the Americans.

A few days before the attack, Valeriano Abanador, the town&#x27;s police chief, and Captain Daza met to plan the attack on the American unit. To address the issue of sufficient manpower to offset the Americans&#x27; advantage in firepower, Abanador and Daza disguised the congregation of men as a work force aimed at preparing the town for a local &quot;fiesta&quot; which, incidentally, also served to address Connell&#x27;s preparations for his superior&#x27;s visit. Abanador also brought in a group of &quot;tax evaders&quot; to bolster their numbers. Much palm wine was brought in to ensure that the American soldiers would be drunk the day after the &quot;fiesta&quot;. Hours before the attack, women and children were sent away to safety. To mask the disappearance of the women from the dawn service in the church, 34 men from Barrio Lawaan cross-dressed as women worshippers. These &quot;women&quot;, carrying small coffins, were challenged by Sergeant Scharer of the sentry post about the town plaza near the church. Opening one of the coffins with his bayonet, he saw the body of a dead child who, he was told, was a victim of a cholera epidemic. Abashed, he let the women pass on. Unbeknownst to the sentries, the other coffins hid the &quot;bolos&quot; and other weapons of the attackers.

There is much conflict between accounts by members of Company C. That day, the 27th, was the 52nd anniversary of the founding of the parish, an occasion on which an image of a recumbent Christ known as a Santo Entierro would have been carried around the parish. In modern times these Santo Entierros are enclosed in a glass case but at the time were commonly enclosed in a wooden box.

===Attack on American soldiers===
Between 6:20 and 6:45 in the morning of September 28, 1901, the villagers made their move. Abanador, who had been supervising the prisoners&#x27; communal labor in the town plaza, grabbed the rifle of Private Adolph Gamlin, one of the American sentries, and stunned him with a blow to the head. This served as the signal for the rest of the communal laborers in the plaza to rush the other sentries and soldiers of Company C, who were mostly having breakfast in the mess area. Abanador then gave a shout, signaling the other Philippine men to the attack and fired Gamlin&#x27;s rifle at the mess tent, hitting one of the soldiers. The pealing of the church bells and the sounds from conch shells being blown followed seconds later. Some of the Company C troopers were attacked and hacked to death before they could grab their rifles; the few who survived the initial onslaught fought almost bare-handed, using kitchen utensils, steak knives, and chairs. One private used a baseball bat to fend off the attackers before being overwhelmed.

The men detained in the Sibley tents broke out and made their way to the municipal hall. Simultaneously, the attackers hidden in the church broke into the parish house and killed the three American officers there. An unarmed Company C soldier was ignored, as was Captain Connell&#x27;s Philippine houseboy. The attackers initially occupied the parish house and the municipal hall; however, the attack at the mess tents and the barracks failed, with Pvt. Gamlin, recovering consciousness and managing to secure another rifle, caused considerable casualties among the Philippine forces. With the initial surprise wearing off and the attack degrading, Abanador called for the attackers to break off and retreat. The surviving Company C soldiers, led by Sergeant Frank Betron, escaped by sea to Basey and Tanauan, Leyte. The townspeople buried their dead and abandoned the town.

Of the 74 men in Company C, 36 were killed in action, including all its commissioned officers: Captain Thomas W. Connell, First Lieutenant Edward A. Bumpus and Major Richard S. Griswold. Twenty-two were wounded in action and four were missing in action. Eight died later of wounds received in combat; only four escaped unscathed. The villagers captured about 100 rifles and 25,000 rounds of ammunition and suffered 28 dead and 22 wounded.

==Aftermath==
This was described as the &quot;worst defeat of United States Army soldiers since the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876&quot;.

==Legacy==
The attack and subsequent actions on Samar have been some of the longest-running and most controversial issues between the Philippines and the United States. Conflicting interpretations by American and Philippine historians have confused the issue. The attack has been termed &quot;Balangiga Massacre&quot; in many English language sources. However, Philippine historian Teodoro Agoncillo has asserted that the term &quot;Balangiga massacre&quot; properly refers to the burning of the town by US forces following the attack and to retaliatory acts during the &quot;March across Samar&quot;. Other Philippine sources also employ this usage. In US sources, however, the term &quot;massacre&quot; is used to refer to this attack.

==Factual disputes==
Mutilation of the bodies of the Americans who were killed was reported in testimony before the US Senate Committee on the Philippines the and information about that has appeared elsewhere. The asserted mutilations have been disputed by historiat George Borrinaga with a counter-assertion to the effect that Filipinos have respect for the dead, he says, and would do no such thing.

Several asserted factual inaccuracies in early published accounts have surfaced over the years as historians continue to re-investigate the Balangiga incident. These include:
* Schott and Rey Imperial assert that Company C of the 9th US Infantry was sent to Balangiga in response to a request by its then-Mayor Pedro Abayan. This is based solely on a claim by George Meyer, a Company C survivor, in support of efforts to secure the Medal of Honor. Author Bob Couttie asserts that the American unit was sent there to close Balangiga&#x27;s port.
* James Taylor&#x27;s account inspired another author, William T. Sexton, to write that the American soldiers were &quot;butchered like hogs&quot; in &quot;Soldiers in the Sun&quot;. However, Eugenio Daza wrote, &quot;The Filipino believes that the profanation of the dead necessarily brings bad luck and misfortune ... there was no time to lose for such acts [after the Balangiga attack].&quot;

==Biography==
Hidaka was born in the Kudan area of Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan, where she attended Fujimi Elementary School. Her parents owned a Western-style clothing store named &quot;Tailor Itō&quot;. She began her career as an idol star, but switched to voice acting, and was employed by the talent management firm 81 Produce until 2006. Hidaka used to use the kanji variant 日髙 (note that the second kanji is different). She switched to the current usage (日高) around 1995 when she found that it was written that way already on many things and after friends recommended the kanji with the lower stroke count. Her fans have given her the affectionate name &quot;Nonko&quot; (ノン子). In 1982, during her time as an idol star, Hidaka appeared in the commercial for Nivea skin milk. She has also done voice-over commercials for programs and games, in which she plays a role for &quot;3rd Super Robot Wars Alpha: To the End of the Galaxy&quot;.

<doc id="601273" wikidata="Q1816034" url="?curid=601273" title="Third World (band)">
<text>Third World is a Jamaican reggae fusion band formed in 1973. Their sound is influenced by soul, funk and disco. Although it has undergone several line-up changes, Stephen &quot;Cat&quot; Coore and Richard Daley have been constant members.

==History==

=== 1970s ===
Third World started when keyboard player Michael &quot;Ibo&quot; Cooper and guitarist (and cellist) Stephen &quot;Cat&quot; Coore (son of former Deputy Prime Minister David Coore), who had originally played in The Alley Cats and then Inner Circle, subsequently left to form their own band along with Inner Circle singer Milton &quot;Prilly&quot; Hamilton. They recruited bassist Richard Daley, formerly of Ken Boothe&#x27;s band and Tomorrow&#x27;s Children, and added drummer Carl Barovier and former Inner Circle percussionist Irvin &quot;Carrot&quot; Jarrett before making their live debut in early 1974.

After recording some tracks with Geoffrey Chung which went unreleased, the band&#x27;s first single was the self-produced &quot;Railroad Track&quot; (1974). In their early days they played primarily in Kingston&#x27;s hotels and nightclubs and (along with The Wailers) supported The Jackson Five when they played at the Jamaican National Stadium.

They were soon signed by Island Records and toured Europe with The Wailers. The band&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in 1976. The album included a cover of &quot;Satta Massagana&quot;, originally performed by The Abyssinians, which became a local hit. Hamilton and Cornell Marshall (who had replaced Barovier earlier) were replaced by two more former Inner Circle members, singer William &quot;Bunny Rugs&quot; Clarke and drummer Willie Stewart, before the recording of their second album, &quot;96° in the Shade&quot; (1977), which included several local hits. Notable among its eight tracks were &quot;1865 (96° in the Shade)&quot;, a reference to the 1865 Morant Bay rebellion, &quot;Rhythm of Life&quot; and the album&#x27;s only cover, &quot;Dreamland&quot;, written by Bunny Wailer. They played in front of 80,000 people at the Smile Jamaica festival in 1976.

In 1977, the band collaborated with psychiatrist Frederick Hickling on the &quot;Explanitations&quot; show that was performed at Kingston&#x27;s Little Theatre early the following year.

=== 1980s ===
Third World&#x27;s greatest success came in the late 1970s and early 1980s, peaking with their cover version of The O&#x27;Jays&#x27; &quot;Now That We Found Love&quot; from their third album &quot;Journey to Addis&quot;. After its initial recording, the single was remixed at the behest of Island Records Special Projects division head, Alex Masucci, with new vocals and an uptempo beat. &quot;Now That We Found Love&quot; became a hit single on both sides of the Atlantic in 1978, reaching the top 10 in the UK. &quot;Journey to Addis&quot; became a top thirty hit album in the UK. 

They had first met Stevie Wonder in Jamaica in 1976, and the single prompted him to perform with them at the Reggae Sunsplash festival in 1981 in the wake of Bob Marley&#x27;s death, playing his tribute to Marley, &quot;Master Blaster&quot;. Third World went on to perform several times at the festival, and they also took part in the &quot;Reggae Sunsplash USA&quot; tour in 1985. Wonder also wrote, along with Melody A McCully, their 1982 hit &quot;Try Jah Love&quot;, which brought them further exposure in North America. They were also guests during the third season of SCTV.

In 1983, Third World had crossover success on the UK jazz-funk scene with their reggae single &quot;Lagos Jump&quot; largely thanks to Robbie Vincent and Jeff Young who played the 12-inch version on their Radio London shows. The track also became popular on the London club scene and in particular at Flicks in Dartford.

Telstar Records released a double-album compilation in 1983 which collected up all the mainstream club extended versions and remixes by artists and groups that had enjoyed relatively good UK chart success between 1981 and 1983. Entitled &quot;In the Groove&quot;, the compilation&#x27;s lead track on Part Two was Third World&#x27;s extended version of &quot;Dancing on the Floor (Hooked on Love)&quot;. The track had originally been released in 1981 in 7-inch edited and 12-inch extended versions, and included on Third World&#x27;s &quot;Rock the World&quot; album. With the release of the Telstar compilation, this brought about an upsurge of interest in Third World&#x27;s dancefloor output and certainly paved the way for the next two years recordings with Columbia Records (CBS).

In 1985, the group&#x27;s focus steered by a shifting music scene, brought about a stylistic change in musical direction with the release of &quot;Sense of Purpose&quot;. The single was released as a 7-inch edit and 12-inch extended version and later was reissued as a Shep Pettibone club remix. Whilst the single was popular, it only made the lower ends of the UK charts. The 12-inch extended version was released with an instrumental plus the full length version of their 1983 crossover hit &quot;Lagos Jump&quot; which almost certainly boosted the sales of &quot;Sense of Purpose&quot;.

In the same year, &quot;Now That We&#x27;ve Found Love&quot; returned to the UK charts again as Paul Hardcastle decided to release a club remix, similar to his D-Train remix, putting the Hardcastle signature sound of electronic keyboards on the track and reverbing the opening vocal. Whilst the remix was a UK hit, the remix had seemingly lost its reggae roots and the Hardcastle remix has since largely been forgotten in the decades that have followed. The result being that most DJs and radio stations have returned to the original reggae version.

Amid claims of artistic differences, &quot;Carrot&quot; split from the band in the mid-1980s. The resulting five-piece band then went on to record more commercial albums such as &quot;Sense of Purpose&quot;, &quot;Reggae Ambassador&quot;, &quot;Forbidden Love&quot;, and &quot;Committed&quot;.

Their version of &quot;Now That We&#x27;ve Found Love&quot; was used as the basis of Heavy D&#x27;s 1991 hit rap version. In 1992, they returned to work with Stephen Stewart and Geoffrey Chung on the album &quot;Committed&quot;.

=== 2000s-present ===
Despite several more line-up changes, including the departures of Cooper and Stewart, and a decline in mainstream success, the band is still recording and performing up to the present day, including in front of a television audience at the Cricket World Cup 2007 Opening Ceremony in Trelawny.

In 2008 the band received a lifetime achievement award from Charles Drew University.

In January 2013, the group was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Jamaica Jazz and Blues Festival in Montego Bay as they celebrated their 40th year in music. Throughout 2013, the group completed a 40th anniversary world tour. Illness forced Clarke to miss the European shows, with AJ Brown standing in as lead vocalist. Clarke later died on 2 February 2014 in a hospital in Orlando, Florida, while battling cancer. Brown was announced as Bunny Rugs&#x27; permanent replacement.

Their 21st album, &quot;Under the Magic Sun&quot;, was released in June 2014 on Cleopatra Records, featuring vocals from past members, including Bunny Rugs, Brown, Coore, and Maurice Gregory.

Irvin &quot;Carrot&quot; Jarrett died on 31 July 2018, aged 69.

The group&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;More Work to be Done&quot; received a nomination for a Grammy Award in the Best Reggae Album category, their eighth nomination in the category.

Michael &quot;Ibo&quot; Cooper died on 12 October 2023, aged 71.

==Musical style==

While the band played roots reggae, they have also incorporated other styles into their music, and it was the initial influence of The Wailers that prompted the formation of the band to take on a new direction that combined reggae with other genres. The pop-oriented sound has given rise to criticism of the band over the years, with reggae purists uncomfortable with their incorporation of American soul and R&amp;B into their sound. The band have played also folk-pop, hard rock, bossa nova, rap, light pop-jazz, doo-wop and calypso. Their style has been described as reggae fusion. Bunny Rugs described the band&#x27;s sound: &quot;Strictly a reggae band, no. Definitely a reggae band, yes.&quot; Cat Coore said of their music: &quot;The hybrid of various types of music is a natural thing because, by growing up in Jamaica, we know the direct roots of reggae and ska. At the same time we live in a country where you get to hear Chuck Berry, Fats Domino and all the R&amp;B artists.&quot; Bassist Richard Daley said &quot;we took roots reggae music and put branches on top of it&quot;.

<text>The Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (; ), abbreviated as the Volga German ASSR, was an autonomous republic of the Russian SFSR. Its capital city was Engels (known as Pokrovsk or Kosakenstadt before 1931) located on the Volga River. As a result of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the republic was abolished and Volga Germans were exiled.

==History==
The first provision of a special status for Volga Germans in the Russian SFSR was created following the October Revolution, by a 29 October (some claim 19 October) 1918 decree of the Soviet government, establishing the Labour Commune of Volga Germans. This gave Soviet Germans a special status among the non-Russians in the USSR. It was restructured as an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on 20 February 1924 (claims of 19 December 1923), by a declaration of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Russian SFSR. It became the first national autonomous unit in the Soviet Union after the Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic. It occupied the area of compact settlement of the large Volga German minority in Russia, which numbered almost 1.8 million by 1897. The republic was declared on 6 January 1924. 

At the moment of declaration of autonomy, an amnesty was announced. However, it eventually was applied to a small number of people. According to the policy of korenizatsiia, carried out in the 1920s in the Soviet Union, usage of the German language was promoted in official documents and Germans were encouraged to occupy management positions. According to the 1939 census, there were 366,685 Germans in the republic.

By 1 January 1941, the Volga German ASSR included the city of Engels and 22 cantons: Baltsersky, Gmelinsky, Gnadenflyursky, Dobrinsky, Zelmansky, Zolotovsky, Ilovatsky, Kamensky, Krasnoyarsky, Krasnokutsky, Kukkussky, Lizandergeysky, Marientalsky, Marxshtadtsky, Pallasovsky, Staro-Poltavsky, Ternovsky, Untervaldsky, Fedorovsky, Franksky, Ekgeimsky and Erlenbakhsky.

The German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 marked the end of the Volga German ASSR. On 28 August 1941, the republic was formally abolished and, out of fear they could act as German collaborators, all Volga Germans were exiled to the Kazakh SSR, Altai and Siberia. Many were interned in labor camps merely due to their heritage. On 7 September 1941, the republic was formally extinguished and its territory divided between the Saratov Oblast (15 cantons) and the Stalingrad Oblast (7 cantons).

Following the death of Stalin in 1953, the situation for Volga Germans improved dramatically. In 1964, a second decree was issued, openly admitting the government&#x27;s guilt in pressing charges against innocent people and urging Soviet citizens to give Volga Germans every assistance in their &quot;economic and cultural expansion&quot;. With the existence of a socialist German state in East Germany now a reality of the post-war world, the Volga German ASSR was never reestablished.

Beginning in the early 1980s and accelerating after the fall of the Soviet Union, many Volga Germans have emigrated to Germany by taking advantage of the German &quot;law of return&quot;, a policy which grants citizenship to all those who can prove to be a refugee or expellee of German ethnic origin or as the spouse or descendant of such a person.

At a height of there is a revolving restaurant, which seats 230 people. A full revolution takes 53 minutes. The tower also serves as a broadcast tower, and has one Deutsche Telekom maintenance elevator with a speed of , as well as two visitor lifts with a speed of which have a capacity of about 30 people per car. The travel time is about 30 seconds. The tower is open daily from 09:00 to 24:00.

There is a concept of making virtual reality weather timelapse service from Olympiaturm. In case it were implemented, it would become the first tower worldwide with such function.

<doc id="601284" wikidata="Q173746" url="?curid=601284" title="Paul Erdős">
<text>Paul Erdős (, ; 26March 191320September 1996) was a Hungarian mathematician. He was one of the most prolific mathematicians and producers of mathematical conjectures of the 20th century. pursued and proposed problems in discrete mathematics, graph theory, number theory, mathematical analysis, approximation theory, set theory, and probability theory. Much of his work centered on discrete mathematics, cracking many previously unsolved problems in the field. He championed and contributed to Ramsey theory, which studies the conditions in which order necessarily appears. Overall, his work leaned towards solving previously open problems, rather than developing or exploring new areas of mathematics. Erdős published around 1,500 mathematical papers during his lifetime, a figure that remains unsurpassed. 

He was known both for his social practice of mathematics, working with more than 500 collaborators, and for his eccentric lifestyle; &quot;Time&quot; magazine called him &quot;The Oddball&#x27;s Oddball&quot;. He firmly believed mathematics to be a social activity, living an itinerant lifestyle with the sole purpose of writing mathematical papers with other mathematicians. He devoted his waking hours to mathematics, even into his later years; he died at a mathematics conference in Warsaw in 1996. 

Erdős&#x27;s prolific output with co-authors prompted the creation of the Erdős number, the number of steps in the shortest path between a mathematician and Erdős in terms of co-authorships.

==Life==
Paul Erdős was born on 26 March 1913, in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, the only surviving child of Anna (née Wilhelm) and Lajos Erdős (né Engländer). His two sisters, aged three and five, both died of scarlet fever a few days before he was born. His parents, both Jewish, were high school mathematics teachers. His fascination with mathematics developed early. He was raised partly by a German governess because his father was held captive in Siberia as an Austro-Hungarian prisoner of war during 1914–1920, causing his mother to have to work long hours to support their household. His father had taught himself English while in captivity but mispronounced many words. When Lajos later taught his son to speak English, Paul learned his father&#x27;s pronunciation, which he continued to use for the rest of his life.

He taught himself to read through mathematics texts that his parents left around in their home. By the age of five, given a person&#x27;s age, he could calculate in his head how many seconds they had lived. Due to his sisters&#x27; deaths, he had a close relationship with his mother, with the two of them reportedly sharing the same bed until he left for college.

When he was 16, his father introduced him to two subjects that would become lifetime favourites—infinite series and set theory. In high school, Erdős became an ardent solver of the problems that appeared each month in &quot;KöMaL&quot;, the &quot;Mathematical and Physical Journal for Secondary Schools&quot;.

Erdős began studying at the University of Budapest when he was 17 after winning a national examination. At the time, admission of Jews to Hungarian universities was severely restricted under the &quot;numerus clausus&quot;. By the time he was 20, he had found a proof for Chebyshev&#x27;s theorem. In 1934, at the age of 21, he was awarded a doctorate in mathematics. Erdős&#x27;s thesis advisor was Lipót Fejér, who was also the thesis advisor for John von Neumann, George Pólya, and Paul (Pál) Turán. He took up a post-doctoral fellowship at Manchester, as Jews in Hungary were suffering oppression under the authoritarian regime. While there he met Godfrey Harold Hardy and Stan Ulam.

Because he was Jewish, Erdős decided Hungary was dangerous and left the country, relocating to the United States in 1938. Many members of Erdős&#x27;s family, including two of his aunts, two of his uncles, and his father, died in Budapest during World War II. His mother was the only one that survived. He was living in America and working at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton at the time. However, his fellowship at Princeton only got extended by 6 months rather than the expected year due to Erdős not conforming to the standards of the place; they found him &quot;uncouth and unconventional&quot;.

Described by his biographer, Paul Hoffman, as &quot;probably the most eccentric mathematician in the world,&quot; Erdős spent most of his adult life living out of a suitcase. Except for some years in the 1950s, when he was not allowed to enter the United States based on the accusation that he was a Communist sympathizer, his life was a continuous series of going from one meeting or seminar to another. During his visits, Erdős expected his hosts to lodge him, feed him, and do his laundry, along with anything else he needed, as well as arrange for him to get to his next destination.

Ulam left his post at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1943 to work on the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico with other mathematicians and physicists. He invited Erdős to join the project, but the invitation was withdrawn when Erdős expressed a desire to return to Hungary after the war.

On 20 September 1996, at the age of 83, he had a heart attack and died while attending a conference in Warsaw. These circumstances were close to the way he wanted to die. He once said,

Erdős never married and had no children. He is buried next to his mother and father in the Jewish Kozma Street Cemetery in Budapest. For his epitaph, he suggested &quot;I&#x27;ve finally stopped getting dumber.&quot; (Hungarian: &quot;Végre nem butulok tovább&quot;).

Erdős&#x27;s name contains the Hungarian letter &quot;ő&quot; (&quot;o&quot; with double acute accent), but is often incorrectly written as &quot;Erdos&quot; or &quot;Erdös&quot; either &quot;by mistake or out of typographical necessity&quot;.

==Career==
In 1934, Erdős moved to Manchester, England, to be a guest lecturer. In 1938, he accepted his first American position as a scholarship holder at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, for the next ten years. Despite outstanding papers with Mark Kac and Aurel Wintner on probabilistic number theory, Pál Turán in approximation theory, and Witold Hurewicz on dimension theory, his fellowship was not continued, and
Erdős was forced to take positions as a wandering scholar at UPenn, Notre Dame, Purdue, Stanford, and Syracuse. He would not stay long in one place, instead traveling among mathematical institutions until his death.

As a result of the Red Scare and McCarthyism, in 1954, the Immigration and Naturalization Service denied Erdős, a Hungarian citizen, a re-entry visa into the United States. Teaching at the University of Notre Dame at the time, Erdős could have chosen to remain in the country. Instead, he packed up and left, albeit requesting reconsideration from the U.S. Immigration Services at periodic intervals. At some point he moved to live in Israel. He was given a position for three months at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and then a &quot;permanent visiting professor&quot; position at the Technion. 

Hungary at the time was under the Warsaw Pact with the Soviet Union. Although Hungary limited the freedom of its own citizens to enter and exit the country, in 1956 it gave Erdős the exclusive privilege of being allowed to enter and exit the country as he pleased. 

In 1963, the U.S. Immigration Service granted Erdős a visa, and he resumed teaching at and traveling to American institutions. Ten years later, in 1973, the 60-year-old Erdős voluntarily left Hungary.

During the last decades of his life, Erdős received at least fifteen honorary doctorates. He became a member of the scientific academies of eight countries, including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the UK Royal Society. He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977. Shortly before his death, he renounced his honorary degree from the University of Waterloo over what he considered to be unfair treatment of colleague Adrian Bondy.

=== Mathematical work ===
Erdős was one of the most prolific publishers of papers in mathematical history, comparable only with Leonhard Euler; Erdős published more papers, mostly in collaboration with other mathematicians, while Euler published more pages, mostly by himself. Erdős wrote around 1,525 mathematical articles in his lifetime, mostly with co-authors. He strongly believed in and practiced mathematics as a social activity, having 511 different collaborators in his lifetime.

In his mathematical style, Erdős was much more of a &quot;problem solver&quot; than a &quot;theory developer&quot; (see &quot;The Two Cultures of Mathematics&quot; by Timothy Gowers for an in-depth discussion of the two styles, and why problem solvers are perhaps less appreciated). Joel Spencer states that &quot;his place in the 20th-century mathematical pantheon is a matter of some controversy because he resolutely concentrated on particular theorems and conjectures throughout his illustrious career.&quot; Erdős never won the Fields Medal (the highest mathematical prize available during his lifetime), nor did he coauthor a paper with anyone who did, a pattern that extends to other prizes. He did win the 1983/84 Wolf Prize, &quot;for his numerous contributions to number theory, combinatorics, probability, set theory and mathematical analysis, and for personally stimulating mathematicians the world over&quot;. In contrast, the works of the three winners after were recognized as &quot;outstanding&quot;, &quot;classic&quot;, and &quot;profound&quot;, and the three before as &quot;fundamental&quot; or &quot;seminal&quot;.

Of his contributions, the development of Ramsey theory and the application of the probabilistic method especially stand out. Extremal combinatorics owes to him a whole approach, derived in part from the tradition of analytic number theory. Erdős found a proof for Bertrand&#x27;s postulate which proved to be far neater than Chebyshev&#x27;s original one. He also discovered the first elementary proof for the prime number theorem, along with Atle Selberg. However, the circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between Erdős and Selberg. Erdős also contributed to fields in which he had little real interest, such as topology, where he is credited as the first person to give an example of a totally disconnected topological space that is not zero-dimensional, the Erdős space.

===Erdős&#x27;s problems===

Erdős had a reputation for posing new problems as well as solving existing ones – Ernst Strauss called him &quot;the absolute monarch of problem posers&quot;. Throughout his career, Erdős would offer payments for solutions to unresolved problems. These ranged from $25 for problems that he felt were just out of the reach of the current mathematical thinking (both his and others) up to $10,000 for problems that were both difficult to attack and mathematically significant. Some of these problems have since been solved, including the most lucrative – Erdős&#x27;s conjecture on prime gaps was solved in 2014, and the $10,000 paid.

There are thought to be at least a thousand remaining unsolved problems, though there is no official or comprehensive list. The offers remained active despite Erdős&#x27;s death; Ronald Graham was the (informal) administrator of solutions, and a solver could receive either an original check signed by Erdős before his death (for memento only, which cannot be cashed) or a cashable check from Graham. British mathematician Thomas Bloom started a website dedicated to Erdős&#x27;s problems in 2024.

Perhaps the most mathematically notable of these problems is the Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions:

If true, it would solve several other open problems in number theory (although one main implication of the conjecture, that the prime numbers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, has since been proved independently as the Green–Tao theorem). The payment for the solution of the problem is currently worth US$5,000.

The most familiar problem with an Erdős prize is likely the Collatz conjecture, also called the 3&quot;N&quot; + 1 problem. Erdős offered $500 for a solution. 

===Collaborators===
Erdős&#x27; most frequent collaborators include Hungarian mathematicians András Sárközy (62 papers) and András Hajnal (56 papers), and American mathematician Ralph Faudree (50 papers). Other frequent collaborators were the following:

==Erdős number==

Because of his prolific output, friends created the Erdős number as a tribute. An Erdős number describes a person&#x27;s degree of separation from Erdős himself, based on their collaboration with him, or with another who has their own Erdős number. Erdős alone was assigned the Erdős number of 0 (for being himself), while his immediate collaborators could claim an Erdős number of 1, their collaborators have Erdős number at most 2, and so on. Approximately 200,000 mathematicians have an assigned Erdős number, and some have estimated that 90 percent of the world&#x27;s active mathematicians have an Erdős number smaller than 8 (not surprising in light of the small-world phenomenon). Due to collaborations with mathematicians, many scientists in fields such as physics, engineering, biology, and economics also have Erdős numbers.

Several studies have shown that leading mathematicians tend to have particularly low Erdős numbers. For example, the roughly 268,000 mathematicians with a known Erdős number have a median value of 5. In contrast, the median Erdős number of Fields Medalists is 3. As of 2015, approximately 11,000 mathematicians have an Erdős number of 2 or less. Collaboration distances will necessarily increase over long time scales, as mathematicians with low Erdős numbers die and become unavailable for collaboration. The American Mathematical Society provides a free online tool to determine the Erdős number of every mathematical author listed in the Mathematical Reviews catalogue.

The Erdős number was most likely first defined by Casper Goffman, an analyst whose own Erdős number is 2; Goffman co-authored with mathematician Richard B. Darst, who co-authored with Erdős. Goffman published his observations about Erdős&#x27;s prolific collaboration in a 1969 article titled &quot;And what is your Erdős number?&quot;

Jerry Grossman has written that it could be argued that Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron can be considered to have an Erdős number of 1 because they both autographed the same baseball (for Carl Pomerance) when Emory University awarded them honorary degrees on the same day. Erdős numbers have also been proposed for an infant, a horse, and several actors.

==Personality==
Possessions meant little to Erdős; most of his belongings would fit in a suitcase, as dictated by his itinerant lifestyle. Awards and other earnings were generally donated to people in need and various worthy causes. He spent most of his life traveling between scientific conferences, universities, and the homes of colleagues all over the world. He earned enough in stipends from universities as a guest lecturer, and from various mathematical awards, to fund his travels and basic needs; money left over he used to fund cash prizes for proofs of &quot;Erdős&#x27;s problems&quot; (see above). He would typically show up at a colleague&#x27;s doorstep and announce &quot;my brain is open&quot;, staying long enough to collaborate on a few papers before moving on a few days later. In many cases, he would ask the current collaborator about whom to visit next.

His colleague Alfréd Rényi said, &quot;A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems&quot;, and Erdős drank copious quantities; this quotation is often attributed incorrectly to Erdős, but Erdős himself ascribed it to Rényi. After his mother&#x27;s death in 1971 he started taking antidepressants and amphetamines, despite the concern of his friends, one of whom (Ron Graham) bet him $500 that he could not stop taking them for a month. Erdős won the bet but complained that it impacted his performance: &quot;You&#x27;ve showed me I&#x27;m not an addict. But I didn&#x27;t get any work done. I&#x27;d get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. I&#x27;d have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. You&#x27;ve set mathematics back a month.&quot; After he won the bet, he promptly resumed his use of Ritalin and Benzedrine.

He had his own idiosyncratic vocabulary; although an agnostic atheist, he spoke of &quot;The Book&quot;, a visualization of a book in which God had written down the best and most elegant proofs for mathematical theorems. Lecturing in 1985 he said, &quot;You don&#x27;t have to believe in God, but you should believe in &quot;The Book&quot;.&quot; He himself doubted the existence of God. He playfully nicknamed him the SF (for &quot;Supreme Fascist&quot;), accusing him of hiding his socks and Hungarian passports, and of keeping the most elegant mathematical proofs to himself. When he saw a particularly beautiful mathematical proof he would exclaim, &quot;This one&#x27;s from &quot;The Book&quot;!&quot; This later inspired a book titled &quot;Proofs from the Book&quot;.

Other idiosyncratic elements of Erdős&#x27;s vocabulary include:
* Children were referred to as &quot;epsilons&quot; (because in mathematics, particularly calculus, an arbitrarily small positive quantity is commonly denoted by the Greek letter (ε)).
* Women were &quot;bosses&quot; who &quot;captured&quot; men as &quot;slaves&quot; by marrying them. Divorced men were &quot;liberated&quot;.
* People who stopped doing mathematics had &quot;died&quot;, while people who died had &quot;left&quot;.
* Alcoholic drinks were &quot;poison&quot;.
* Music (except classical music) was &quot;noise&quot;.
* To be considered a hack was to be a &quot;Newton&quot;.
* To give a mathematical lecture was &quot;to preach&quot;.
*Mathematical lectures themselves were &quot;sermons&quot;.
* To give an oral exam to students was &quot;to torture&quot; them.

He gave nicknames to many countries, examples being: the U.S. was &quot;samland&quot; (after Uncle Sam) and the Soviet Union was &quot;joedom&quot; (after Joseph Stalin). He claimed that Hindi was the best language because words for old age (&quot;&quot;) and stupidity (&quot;&quot;) sounded almost the same.

=== Signature ===
Erdős signed his name &quot;Paul Erdos P.G.O.M.&quot; When he became 60, he added &quot;L.D.&quot;, at 65 &quot;A.D.&quot;, at 70 &quot;L.D.&quot; (again), and at 75 &quot;C.D.&quot;
* P.G.O.M. represented &quot;Poor Great Old Man&quot;
* The first L.D. represented &quot;Living Dead&quot;
* A.D. represented &quot;Archaeological Discovery&quot;
* The second L.D. represented &quot;Legally Dead&quot;
* C.D. represented &quot;Counts Dead&quot;

==Legacy==

=== Books and films ===
Erdős is the subject of at least three books: two biographies (Hoffman&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Loved Only Numbers&quot; and Schechter&#x27;s &quot;My Brain is Open&quot;, both published in 1998) and a 2013 children&#x27;s picture book by Deborah Heiligman (&quot;The Boy Who Loved Math: The Improbable Life of Paul Erdős&quot;).

He is also the subject of George Csicsery&#x27;s biographical documentary film &quot;N is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erdős,&quot; made while he was still alive.

===Astronomy===
In 2021 the minor planet (asteroid) 405571 (temporarily designated 2005 QE87) was formally named &quot;Erdőspál&quot; to commemorate Erdős, with the citation describing him as &quot;a Hungarian mathematician, much of whose work centered around discrete mathematics. His work leaned towards solving previously open problems, rather than developing or exploring new areas of mathematics.&quot; The naming was proposed by &quot;K. Sárneczky, Z. Kuli&quot; (Kuli being the asteroid&#x27;s discoverer).

<text>The University of Tasmania (UTAS) is a public research university, primarily located in Tasmania, Australia. Founded in 1890, it is Australia&#x27;s fourth oldest university. Christ College, one of the university&#x27;s residential colleges, first proposed in 1840 in Lieutenant-Governor Sir John Franklin&#x27;s Legislative Council, was modelled on the Oxford and Cambridge colleges, and was founded in 1846, making it the oldest tertiary institution in the country. The university is a sandstone university, a member of the international Association of Commonwealth Universities, and the Association of Southeast Asian Institutions of Higher Learning.

The university offers various undergraduate and graduate programs in a range of disciplines, and has links with 20 specialist research institutes and co-operative research centres. Its Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies has strongly contributed to the university&#x27;s multiple 5 rating scores (&quot;well above world standard&quot;) for excellence in research awarded by the Australian Research Council. The university also delivers tertiary education at the Australian Maritime College, the national centre for maritime education, training and research.

The University has also demonstrated strong outcomes on climate change, sustainability, and resource management, earning it a high global ranking in the Times Higher Education Impact Ratings in 2022 and 2023. UTAS&#x27;s initiatives include climate-focused research, offering over 100 courses with climate-focused units, low-carbon energy use in new campus developments, divesting from fossil fuels, and a commitment to carbon neutrality, which has been certified by Climate Active since 2016.

==History==

===Founding and early years (1890–1938)===

The University of Tasmania was established on 1 January 1890, after the abolition of overseas scholarships freed up funds. It immediately took over the role of the Tasmanian Council for Education. Richard Deodatus Poulett Harris, who had long advocated for the establishment of the university, became its first warden of the senate. The first degrees to graduates admitted &quot;ad eundem gradum&quot; and diplomas were awarded in June 1890. The university was offered an ornate sandstone building on the Queens Domain in Hobart, previously the High School of Hobart, though it was leased by others until mid-1892. This eventually became known as University House. Three lecturers began teaching 11 students from 22 March 1893, once University House had been renovated. Parliamentarians branding it an unnecessary luxury made the university&#x27;s early existence precarious. The institution&#x27;s encouragement of female students fuelled criticism. James Backhouse Walker, a local lawyer and briefly vice-chancellor, mounted a courageous defence.

According to Chancellor Sir John Morris, from 1918 until 1939 the institution still &#x27;limped along&#x27;. Distinguished staff had already been appointed, such as historian William Jethro Brown, physicists and mathematicians Alexander McAulay and his son Alexander Leicester McAulay, classicist RL Dunbabin, and philosopher and polymath Edmund Morris Miller. Housed in the former Hobart High School, facilities were totally outgrown, but the state government was slow to fund a new campus.

In 1914 the university petitioned King George V for &quot;Letters Patent&quot;, which request he granted. The Letters Patent, sometimes called the &quot;Royal Charter&quot;, granted the university&#x27;s degrees status as equivalent to the established universities of the United Kingdom, where such equivalents existed.

===World War II (1939–45)===
During the Second World War, while the Optical Munitions Annexe assisted the war effort, local graduates, replacing soldier academics, taught a handful of students. New post-war staff, many with overseas experience, pressed for removal to adequate facilities at Sandy Bay on an old rifle range. Chancellor Sir John Morris, also Chief Justice, though a dynamic reformer, antagonised academics by his authoritarianism. Vice-chancellor Torleiv Hytten, a Norwegian-born economist, saw contention peak while the move to Sandy Bay was delayed. In a passionate open letter to the premier, Philosophy Professor Sydney Orr goaded the government into establishing the 1955 Royal Commission into the university. The commission&#x27;s report demanded extensive reform of both university and governing council. Staff were delighted, while lay administrators fumed.

===Post-war years (1946–1964)===
On 10 May 1949, the university awarded its first Doctor of Philosophy to Joan Munro Ford. Ford worked as a research biologist in the University of Tasmania&#x27;s Department of Physics between 1940 and 1950.

In early 1956 Orr was summarily dismissed, mainly for his alleged though denied seduction of a student. A ten-year battle involved academics in Australia and overseas. Orr lost an unfair dismissal action in the Supreme Court of Tasmania and the High Court of Australia. The Tasmanian Chair of Philosophy was boycotted. In 1966 Orr received some financial compensation from the university, which also established a cast-iron tenure system. The latter disappeared with the federal reorganisation of higher education in the late 1980s.

In the early 1960s The University of Tasmania at last transferred to a purpose-built new campus at Sandy Bay, though many departments were initially housed in ex-World War II wooden huts. It profited from increasing federal finance following the 1957 Murray Report. Medical and Agricultural Schools were established and the sciences obtained adequate laboratories. Physics achieved world recognition in astronomy (optical, radio and cosmic rays), while other departments attracted good scholars and graduates were celebrated in many fields. Student facilities improved remarkably.

===Mergers and the &quot;new&quot; university (1965–99)===

The 1965 Martin Report established a traditional role for universities, and a more practical role for colleges of advanced education. The Tasmanian Government duly created the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education (TCAE) in 1966 sited on Mount Nelson above the university. It initially incorporated The School of Art, the Conservatorium of Music and the Hobart Teachers College. In 1971, a Launceston campus of the TCAE was announced. These were fateful decisions, as events over the next years showed. It was argued that the TCAE attempted to compete with the university, not complement it.

In 1978 the University of Tasmania took over two of the courses offered by the TCAE in Hobart, Pharmacy and Surveying, following a report by Professor Karmel, and another by H.E. Cosgrove. Some other TCAE courses in Hobart moved to Launceston. The curious situation of three separate courses in teacher education in the State could not last, however, and following two more reports, the university incorporated the remaining courses of the Hobart campus of the College of Advanced Education in 1981, which raised its numbers to 5000. The Launceston campus of the TCAE renamed itself the Tasmanian State Institute of Technology (TSIT).

In 1987, the University Council resolved to approach the TSIT to negotiate a merger to minimise ongoing conflict. The &#x27;Dawkins Revolution&#x27; and the &#x27;unified national system&#x27; provided later support for this initiative. The Tasmanian State Institute of Technology became the Newnham Campus of the university on 1 January 1991, exactly 101 years after the university&#x27;s founding. A new campus at Burnie on the North-West Coast of Tasmania was opened in 1995, and later became known as the Cradle Coast Campus.

In 2001, the Tasmania Law Reform Institute (TLRI) was established to create a link between institutional law reform in the State created by the demise of first the Tasmanian Law Reform Commission in 1989, and then its replacement, the Tasmanian Law Reform Commissioner in 1997. The new institutes model was based on the Alberta Law Reform Institute, an agency based on an agreement between the Canadian province of Alberta, the Law Society, and the University of Alberta and funded primarily by the Government and the Law Society of Alberta. The TLRI has been used as a template for the establishment of similar institutes at the University of Adelaide with the South Australian Law Reform Institute and in the Australian Capital Territory.

Damian Bugg became the university&#x27;s chancellor in 2006, having previously served as a member of the University Council since 2001. Bugg was an alumnus of the university who studied law and resided at John Fisher College where he was president. While chancellor, he also served as Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. That year the university opened two satellite campuses in Sydney, offering nursing and paramedic education in partnership with local hospitals and health services such as St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital.

The Australian Maritime College (AMC) merged with the university in 2008. The merger helped streamline degree programs and improved provision of basic services at the combined Newnham campus.

The university formed the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) in 2010 to help integrate the Institute of Antarctic and Southern Ocean Studied and the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute, as well as the universities existing marine and Antarctic facility.

The Greenhill Observatory which houses a 1.27 metre optical telescope was opened in 2013 to replace the previous observatory at Canopus Hill, near Hobart. The observatory joined the universities two other observatories including the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory and Ceduna Radio Observatory in Ceduna, South Australia.

===Move to the city===
In 2019, the University of Tasmania announced its intention to move from its Sandy Bay campus and into the Central Business District of Hobart. As part of the plan, on 8 April 2019, UTAS acquired the K&amp;D Warehouse along Melville Street, adding to the number of university buildings within the city centre. The warehouse was initially intended for accommodation, but following the release of the Draft Masterplan in May 2021, would be proposed as the new site for Engineering and Technology.

In 2018 the University bought the Forestry building a heritage-listed complex situated at 79–93 Melville Street, Hobart. The University reported in January 2023 that the Forestry building &quot;will be restored and given new life as an inner-city hub for the learning, research and collaboration over the next two years&quot;. The project will also restore the living forest to the dome.

The masterplan includes targets for increased sustainability, community involvement, and better methods of transport into the CBD. The new city university precincts consist of West End, Midtown, Domain, Medical Precinct, and Wapping, with the old Sandy Bay campus to be transformed into a &quot;world-leading example of a sustainable urban community&quot;. The transition is expected to take place over the next 10 years, with a priority placed on student and community satisfaction. The move to the city has attracted significant community opposition (in the local council area of Hobart City Council, in which the Sandy Bay campus is located) which has culminated in an elector poll being held on the issue in October 2022 at the same time as the Tasmanian local government elections. 74.38% of polled electors in the Hobart City Council area voted against the University&#x27;s proposal to relocate. It is not known if the same concerns are held by the wider Tasmanian community.

In August 2024, another education entity, National Institute of Education and Technology (NIET, Hobart Centre) moved in Old Hytten Building at the University of Tasmania Sandy Bay campus, which is partly repurpose for the University of Tasmania old campus.

==Campuses and buildings==

The university has three main campuses based in Hobart, Launceston and Burnie. It also has a number of small, specialist facilities within the College of Health and Medicine at the Rozelle campus in Sydney. It also has a joint research facility at the city&#x27;s Australian National Maritime Museum in Pyrmont.

=== Heraldry and insignia ===

==== Coat of arms ====
The Grant of Arms was made by the College of Arms. The blazon reads:

In 1936 the University Council ran a competition to produce a draft set of Arms to replace the common seal it had used since 1901, based on the badge of the Tasmanian Council of Education with the motto &quot;Floreat Tasmania&quot; (May Tasmania Prosper). The winning design included four key elements of the current Arms of the university including a lion (representing Tasmania), a book (representing the academic side of the university), a Southern Cross (representing Australia) and a torch (representing the athletic side of the university), over a crown (Or) (signifying the royal charter held by the university). The official coat of arms was granted by the College of Heralds in 1978. The core elements of the 1936 design were kept with slight adjustments made to comply with heraldic rules.

Industry contributions now make up the backbone of the Tasmania Scholarships program. The development and growth of this initiative into one of the most successful sponsored programs in the country is exceptional by any standard. Around 10 per cent of all domestic students at UTAS receive some sort of scholarship or financial assistance. Scholarships are also offered under the banner of the Jim Bacon Memorial Scholarship, funded by the Tasmanian Government.

==Student life==

===Student union===
Until 2008, there were two separate student unions: the Tasmania University Union (TUU) in Hobart and the Student Association (SA) in Launceston. Following the abolition of compulsory student unionism in 2007, the SA and the TUU amalgamated into one statewide organisation representing all UTAS students.

The TUU is responsible for the overseeing of all the university&#x27;s many sports clubs and societies. Some of these include faculty-based societies providing academic and careers guidance; societies relating to various interests, such as the Old Nick Company; and various sporting clubs, including cricket, football, rugby union and soccer.

The TUU also publishes the independent student media at the University of Tasmania, &quot;Togatus&quot;.

Postgraduate students are represented by the TUU through the Tasmania University Union Postgraduate Council. The TUU Postgraduate Council was previously organised as the Tasmania University Postgraduate Association (TUPA). TUPA was established in 1982 to represent postgraduate research students on campus independently of the TUU.

===Residential colleges===

The university maintains a strong residential college system, as well as providing more independent apartment-style living. A key aspect of campus life, the residential colleges are equipped with modern facilities and host several events during the semesters. The colleges also maintain their respective student clubs, key in the passing of traditions from one cohort to the next. The southern colleges annually compete in a series of sporting events including Rugby, Australian Football, Cricket, Softball, Basketball, Table Tennis, Tennis and Soccer.

The college system comprises Christ College, Jane Franklin Hall and St. John Fisher College, and Hytten Hall (originally open from 1959–1980 and re-established in 2023) in Hobart, and Kerslake Hall, Leprena and Investigator Hall in Launceston. The university accommodation system also includes the University Apartments in Sandy Bay and Hobart Apartments in the Hobart CBD, Endeavour Hall in Beauty Point for students of the Australian Maritime College, Newnham Apartments and Inveresk Apartments in Launceston, and West Park Apartments in Burnie.

One other residential college once existed in Hobart – Ena Waite Women&#x27;s College (1968–1980), operated by the Catholic Church and located in central Hobart, which amalgamated with St. John Fisher College. An off-campus student residence in Launceston, Clarence House, operated from 2004 to 2008.

<text>Mahāsī [[Sayadaw|Sayādaw]] [[Burmese name#Honorifics|U]] Sobhana (, ; 29 July 1904 – 14 August 1982) was a Burmese Theravada Buddhist monk and meditation master who had a significant impact on the teaching of vipassanā (insight) meditation in the West and throughout Asia.

In his style of practice, derived from the so-called New Burmese Method of U Nārada, the meditator lives according to Buddhist morality as a prerequisite for meditation practice. Meditation itself entails the practice of &quot;bare insight,&quot; using &quot;satipaṭṭhāna&quot;, the four foundations of mindfulness, to anchor the attention on the sensations of the rising and falling of the abdomen during breathing, observing carefully any other sensations or thoughts. This is coupled to reflection on the Buddhist teachings on causality, thereby gaining insight into &quot;anicca&quot;, &quot;dukkha&quot;, and &quot;anattā&quot; and attaining stream entry.

Mahāsī Sayādaw was a questioner and final editor at the Sixth Buddhist Council on May 17, 1954.

==Biography==
Mahāsi Sayādaw was born in 1904 in Seikkhun village in Upper Burma. He became a novice at age twelve, and was ordained at the age of twenty with the name Sobhana. Over the course of decades of study, he passed the rigorous series of government examinations in the Theravāda Buddhist texts, gaining the newly introduced Dhammācariya (dhamma teacher) degree in 1941.

In 1931, U Sobhana took leave from teaching scriptural studies in Moulmein, South Burma, and went to nearby Thaton to practice intensive Vipassana meditation under Mingun Jetawun Sayādaw (also rendered Mingun Jetavana Sayādaw), also known as U Nārada. This teacher had practiced in the remote Sagaing Hills of Upper Burma, under the guidance of Aletawya Sayādaw, a student of the forest meditation master Thelon Sayādaw. U Sobhāna first taught Vipassana meditation in his home village in 1938, at a monastery named for its massive drum &#x27;Mahāsi&#x27;. He became known in the region as Mahāsi Sayādaw. In 1947, the Prime Minister of Burma, U Nu, invited Mahāsi Sayādaw to be resident teacher at a newly established meditation center in Yangon, which came to be called the Mahāsi Sāsana Yeiktha.

Mahāsi Sayādaw was a questioner and final editor at the Sixth Buddhist Council on May 17, 1954. He helped establish meditation centers all over Burma as well as in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand, and by 1972 the centers under his guidance had trained more than 700,000 meditators. In 1979, he travelled to the West, holding retreats at newly founded centers such as the Insight Meditation Society (IMS) in Barre, Massachusetts, U.S. In addition, meditators came from all over the world to practice at his center in Yangon. When the Mahāsi Sayādaw died on 14 August 1982 following a massive stroke, thousands of devotees braved the torrential monsoon rains to pay their last respects.

==Practice==
Mahāsi&#x27;s method is based on the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, which describes how one focuses attention on the breath, noticing how one breathes in and out. Practice begins with the preparatory stage, the practice of &quot;sīla&quot;, morality, giving up worldly thoughts and desires. The practitioner then engages in &quot;satipatthana&quot; by mindfulness of breathing. One pays attention to any arising mental or physical phenomenon, engaging in vitakka, noting or naming physical and mental phenomena (&quot;breathing, breathing&quot;), without engaging the phenomenon with further conceptual thinking. By noticing the arising of physical and mental phenomena, the meditator becomes aware how sense impressions arise from the contact between the senses and physical and mental phenomena, as described in the five &quot;skandhas&quot; and &quot;paṭiccasamuppāda&quot;. This noticing is accompanied by reflections on causation and other Buddhist teachings, leading to insight into anicca, dukkha, and anattā. When the three characteristics have been comprehended, reflection subdues, and the process of noticing accelerates, noting phenomena in general, without necessarily naming them.

<doc id="601304" wikidata="Q1185908" url="?curid=601304" title="Democrats for Life of America">
<text>Democrats for Life of America (DFLA) is a 501(c)(4) American political advocacy nonprofit organization that seeks to elect anti-abortion Democrats and to encourage the Democratic Party to oppose euthanasia, capital punishment, and abortion. DFLA&#x27;s position on abortion is in opposition to the current platform of the Democratic Party, which unequivocally supports abortion rights with minimal restrictions. 

Democrats for Life calls for the return of the 2000 Democratic Party Platform&#x27;s position on abortion, which acknowledged the diversity of opinion on the topic of abortion.

The group generally refrains from taking positions on socioeconomic issues or foreign policy. They have drafted the Pregnant Women Support Act, a comprehensive package of federal legislation and policy proposals that supporters hope will increase access to maternal healthcare and reduce the demand and number of abortions. They have an affiliated political action committee, DFLA PAC.

They have proposed linking a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of gestation to increased support for pregnant women and mothers, such as paid medical leave and/or more support for affordable day care.

==History==
In 1999, Democrats for Life of America was founded to coordinate, at a national level, the efforts of anti-abortion Democrats.

In the 1960s and 1970s, anti-abortion Democrats comprised a substantial portion of the party&#x27;s membership in both the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. Some Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates ran for those offices as anti-abortion, including Hubert Humphrey and Sargent Shriver. Others were once anti-abortion before running, such as Ted Kennedy, Jesse Jackson, Bill Clinton, and Al Gore. In the 1980s, the influence of anti-abortion advocates in the Democratic Party declined slowly but considerably.

At the 1992 Democratic National Convention, anti-abortion Governor Robert Casey of Pennsylvania was reportedly &quot;barred from addressing the Convention because of his anti-abortion views&quot;. The official reason given by the Convention organizers was that Casey was not allowed to speak because he did not support the Democratic ticket. Kathy Taylor, a pro-abortion rights activist from Pennsylvania, instead addressed the convention. Taylor was a Republican who had worked for Casey&#x27;s opponent in the previous gubernatorial election. Several anti-abortion Democrats did address the delegates in 1992, though they did not address the anti-abortion stance, and were not given prominent prime time slots. Governor Casey&#x27;s son Bob Casey Jr., also an anti-abortion (moderate) Democrat, spoke during the 2008 Democratic National Convention.

==Anti-abortion Democrats in recent elections==

===2004===
In their 2005 book, &quot;Take It Back: Our Party, Our Country, Our Future&quot;, Paul Begala and James Carville praised Democrats for Life for their work that led to the Pregnant Women Support Act. In the book they say the legislation &quot;is built around seventeen concrete policy proposals that would reduce the number of abortions... We believe these proposals would do more to prevent abortions than all the speeches, all the marches and all the campaign ads the pro-lifers have used over the past 30 years.&quot; They go on to call it &quot;both good politics and, we think, good policy&quot;. The initiative has become legislation known as the Pregnant Women Support Act, which &quot;has gained broad support and even has attracted some Republican backers&quot;. The Commonwealth of Virginia is the first state to pass a version of the PWSA.

Organizations and individuals who support the bill include the National Association of Evangelicals, Sojourners/Call to Renewal, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Americans United for Life, National Council on Adoption, Life Education and Resource Network, Redeem the Vote, Care Net, Tony Campolo (founder of the Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education), Joe Turnham (Chairman, Alabama Democratic Party), U.S. Senator Bob Casey Jr., and actor Martin Sheen.

===2010===
The organization has endorsed Congresswoman Kathy Dahlkemper and Congressmen Jim Oberstar, Joe Donnelly, Steve Driehaus, and many other anti-abortion Democrats for the 2010 midterm elections, and its PAC raised over $42,000 in 2010. Of the four mentioned above, only Donnelly was reelected. Oberstar was defeated after 18 terms. Additionally, all four of the freshmen endorsed by DFLA in 2008 were defeated for re-election in 2010 (see above).

=== 2018 ===
Representative Dan Lipinski, a long-time anti-abortion Democrat, from one of Illinois&#x27; Chicago-area House districts won his primary. Three Democratic Senators, who self-identify as anti-abortion, had voted to ban abortion after 20 weeks and ran for reelection to the US Senate; Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia had all voted with most Republicans on the issue. Donnelly and Manchin had been endorsed by Democrats for Life in their reelection bids.

On the afternoon of July 20, 2018, DLFA Executive Director Kristen Day hosted an event where anti-abortion Democrats from around the nation gathered for their first annual conference at a Radisson Hotel in Aurora, Colorado. Over 18 individual speaking sessions were arranged over the course of three days. The keynote speaker on Friday evening was former U.S. Representative Bart Stupak (D-MI) who was instrumental in keeping abortion funding out of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Stupak discussed the challenges of being an anti-abortion Democrat while promoting his new book &quot;For All Americans&quot;.

=== 2020 ===
Representative Dan Lipinski was defeated in a primary election against Marie Newman. Representatives Collin Peterson and Ben McAdams were both defeated in their general election races. This left Henry Cuellar as the only anti-abortion Democrat in the House of Representatives.
In the aftermath of the 2020 election, DFLA protested efforts for repeal the Hyde Amendment, staging a &quot;Day of Action&quot; after the House passed a COVID relief bill that did not include the measure.

=== 2021 ===
Treneé McGee, an anti-abortion Democrat who was endorsed by Democrats for Life, won a seat in the Connecticut House of Representatives on December 22, 2021. She won this seat in a special election following the arrest and subsequent resignation of Michael DiMassa. McGee is currently the youngest black woman ever elected to the Connecticut General Assembly.

=== 2024 ===
Terrisa Bukovinac, former president of DFLA, challenged Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary to call attention to the issue.

At the 2024 Democratic National Convention, in response to Planned Parenthood&#x27;s announcement that they would offer free abortions in a &quot;mobile health clinic&quot; parked outside of the convention, DFLA announced a diaper drive which ended up delivering over 44,000 free diapers and wipes to pregnancy centers in Chicago. The group also hosted an event outside the convention to advocate for an expanded child tax credit and a proposal to eliminate out-of-pocket medical expenses surrounding childbirth, among other things.

<doc id="601309" wikidata="Q2446658" url="?curid=601309" title="Nicky Wire">
<text>Nicholas Allen Jones (born 20 January 1969), known as Nicky Wire, is a Welsh musician, best known as lyricist, bassist and secondary vocalist of the Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers.

Prior to the group, Wire studied politics at university: this would later influence his lyrical work. He was co-writer of the band&#x27;s lyrics (alongside Richey Edwards) from 1989 to 1995, and has been the band&#x27;s primary lyricist since 1995, following Edwards&#x27; disappearance. In addition to his work with Manic Street Preachers, Wire has released two solo albums, &quot;I Killed the Zeitgeist&quot; in 2006 and &quot;Intimism&quot; in 2023.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born Nicholas Allen Jones in Llanbadoc, Monmouthshire, Wales, Wire is the younger brother of poet and author Pat Jones. He attended Oakdale Comprehensive School with James Dean Bradfield, Sean Moore and Richey Edwards. Wire played competitive schools football and, aged 14, was captain of the Welsh national schoolboys&#x27; team. Although he was offered a trial at both Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal football clubs, back and knee problems brought his football career to an end. Wire took A-levels in politics and law. He later attended Portsmouth Polytechnic, but after several months transferred to the University of Wales Swansea, starting his course a year after Edwards. He graduated with a Lower Second-Class Honours degree in politics, which has led him to comment that he may have pursued a career in the diplomatic service or the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

===Career===
Wire is a founding member of Manic Street Preachers and was originally rhythm guitarist but changed to playing the bass guitar after original bassist Flicker left the band. He co-wrote the band&#x27;s lyrics with Richey Edwards between 1989 and 1995, taking over sole responsibility following Edwards&#x27;s disappearance. Some of Edwards&#x27; lyrics were used on 1996&#x27;s &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; album, making 1998&#x27;s &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; the first album with lyrics by Wire alone. Wire remains the primary lyricist for Manic Street Preachers, though lead singer James Dean Bradfield has written a handful of songs, and the 2009 album &quot;Journal for Plague Lovers&quot; contains lyrics by Edwards posthumously used by the rest of the band. Wire usually plays Gibson Thunderbird, Rickenbacker, Fender Jazz and most recently Italia Maranello basses, one of which is a custom acoustic model made by request for the band&#x27;s 2007 acoustic sessions.

Nicky chose the pseudonym Wire because of his lanky, &quot;wiry&quot; frame (he is 6&#x27;3&quot; or 191 cm). He often dons a dress or a skirt for his group&#x27;s gigs but has curtailed his flamboyance in recent years. Wire&#x27;s cross-dressing dates back to his teens, when he would go to local pubs in Blackwood wearing a dress; he has, however, been keen to emphasise that he is not transgender. He partly attributes his attraction to glam and women&#x27;s clothes to his very close relationship with his mother.

Wire is notorious for his outspoken attitude and has been known to cause controversy in the press. He once stated during a 1992 gig, &quot;In this season of goodwill, let’s pray that Michael Stipe goes the same way as Freddie Mercury pretty soon&quot;. However, he has since expressed regret for the remark; stating that it was misinterpreted and &quot;didn&#x27;t come out the way [he] wanted it to.&quot; Wire has noted that his band has taken &quot;inspiration from Queen,&quot; Mercury&#x27;s band, as well as being noted fans of R.E.M.&#x27;s earlier albums.

In November 2007, he was recruited as chair of the advisory board for the new commercial Xfm South Wales Radio Station.

===Solo career===
On Christmas Day 2005, the Manics posted a solo track by Wire called &quot;I Killed the Zeitgeist&quot;, available to download free for one day. In early May, the rumoured first single entitled &quot;Break My Heart Slowly&quot; from his début solo album premièred on BBC Radio 6 Music with Phill Jupitus.

Wire played an intimate solo gig at the Hay Festival on 5 June 2006. The setlist consisted of material from his forthcoming album. Also included was a short acoustic rendition of &quot;Condemned to Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot; from Manic Street Preachers&#x27; début album &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot;. Speaking to NME.COM before the gig, Wire confirmed that he was currently working on a solo album and he&#x27;d already written 25 songs.
On the following day, Wire released the free track &quot;Daydreamer Eyes&quot; on his new website. He released the single &quot;The Shining Path&quot; as an exclusive iTunes only download on 17 July. His solo album, titled &quot;I Killed the Zeitgeist&quot; was released on 25 September, with the single &quot;Break My Heart Slowly&quot; released on 18 September.

In an interview with &quot;NME&quot; in March 2020, that also confirmed work on a 2021 Manic Street Preachers album and a solo album by bandmate James Dean Bradfield, Wire announced that he was working on more solo content, joking that he would not have to put in much work to meet fan demand. Bradfield later reconfirmed this, likening their simultaneous solo work to when they did the same in 2006.

==Personal life==
Wire married his childhood sweetheart, Rachel, on 25 September 1993. He missed the band&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; to promote &quot;Roses in the Hospital&quot; because of the honeymoon and was replaced on the day by a Manic Street Preachers roadie wearing a Minnie Mouse mask. The couple live in the Newport suburb Allt-yr-yn with daughter Clara Enola (born 2002) and son Stanley McCarthey (2007).

The family previously lived in a terrace house in the village Wattsville, near Blackwood. Although he was annoyed when the Daily Mirror revealed he lived there, printing a picture of his house with the number clearly visible, he later paid public tribute to his former home in the title of the track &quot;Wattsville Blues&quot; on the &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; album.

Wire follows the Welsh rugby union team, Whiteheads RFC and Dragons. He is also a fan of Warrington Wolves rugby league team (nicknamed The Wire), as well as being a supporter of football team Tottenham Hotspur, from whom he turned down an offer of a trial as a teenager.

It is a unique lake that was created thousands of years ago when a massive landslide peeled from the Lake Mountain and dammed Poker Creek with debris. The lake&#x27;s outlet flows below the surface through the natural dam and emerges from the mountain as a creek away. The mountainside scar from the landslide is still visible today.
Lake Alice is the home of the only known pure lake strain of naturally reproducing Bonneville cutthroat trout caused by the isolation of the landslide preventing outside genetic influence. At one time the subspecies was thought to be extinct in Wyoming.

The nearest city is Cokeville, Wyoming about to the southwest. Access to the lake requires traversing a winding dirt mountain road, and fording a creek with water as deep as in the spring time. A high clearance vehicle is recommended. The road ends at Hobble Creek campground and from there a hike up a moderately steep mountain trail is required to reach Lake Alice. Nine primitive tent campsites are available though camping is not restricted to a campsite.

Multiple drownings have occurred at the lake which is named after a young girl who drowned in the early 1900s. The most recent drowning occurred on August 12, 2019. Schuyler McKnight, 22, drowned while canoeing at the lake. His body was recovered 41 days later.

<doc id="601316" wikidata="Q5986015" url="?curid=601316" title="Ichabod Crane">
<text>Ichabod Crane is a fictional character and the protagonist in Washington Irving&#x27;s short story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;. Crane is portrayed in the original work, and in most adaptations, as a tall, lanky individual. He is the local schoolmaster, and strongly believes in all things supernatural, including the legend of the Headless Horseman. Crane eventually tries unsuccessfully to court the heiress Katrina Van Tassel, a decision that angers Abraham &quot;Brom Bones&quot; Van Brunt, a local man who also wishes to marry Katrina. After supposedly proposing to Katrina, Crane is on his way home alone at night when the Headless Horseman appears and chases the schoolmaster. The Horseman eventually throws his pumpkin head at Crane, causing him to mysteriously disappear without a trace.

Jonathan Arac argues that &quot;Crane immortalized one American type&quot;: that of the go-getting Yankee.

== Origin ==
Ichabod—meaning &#x27;without glory&#x27; in Hebrew—comes from the biblical figure of that name. Irving might have borrowed the name from that of Ichabod Crane, a colonel in the US Army during the War of 1812, whom he had met in 1814 in Sackets Harbor, New York.According to a notation by Irving and a certification written in longhand by Martin Van Buren, the &#x27;pattern&#x27; (Van Buren&#x27;s words) for the character of Ichabod Crane was based on the original Kinderhook schoolmaster named Jesse Merwin—born in Connecticut—whom Irving befriended in Kinderhook, New York, in 1809. The two friends continued a pen-pal correspondence for thirty years.

Kinderhook&#x27;s original schoolhouse is now owned by the Columbia County Historical Society and called the Ichabod Crane Schoolhouse. The area&#x27;s modern-day school district, Ichabod Crane Central School District, is also named for the character.

It is claimed by many in Tarrytown that Samuel Youngs is the original from whom Irving drew his character of Ichabod Crane. Author Gary Deniss asserts that while the character of Ichabod Crane is loosely based on Merwin, it may include elements from Youngs&#x27; life.

== Characteristics ==
According to Irving, Ichabod&#x27;s appearance is like that of a goofy, old scarecrow who escaped the cornfield. He is described by Irving in the story as &quot;tall, but exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have served for shovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung together. His head was small, and flat at the top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a cock perched upon his spindle neck, to tell which way the wind blew.&quot;

== Role in story ==
=== Life and vocation ===
Ichabod Crane is a schoolteacher with strong beliefs in the supernatural. He is described as &quot;a conscientious man and ever bore in mind the golden maxim, &#x27;Spare the rod and spoil the child.&#x27;&quot; However, &quot;Ichabod Crane&#x27;s scholars certainly were not spoiled. He administered justice with discrimination rather than severity; taking the burden off the backs of the weak, and laying it on those of the strong.&quot;

He made little money as a schoolmaster; his wages were &quot;scarcely sufficient to furnish him with daily bread.&quot; He was able to sustain this work through the help of locals, who &quot;according to country custom in those parts, boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers whose children he instructed . . . with these he lived successively a week at a time, thus going the rounds of the neighborhood, with all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief.&quot;

Ichabod was also known as &quot;the singing-master of the neighborhood&quot; and often on Sundays would &quot;take his station in front of the church gallery, with a band of chosen singers; where, in his own, he completely carried away the psalm from the person.&quot; In addition to his work as a schoolmaster, he &quot;instructed young folks in psalmody.&quot;

Caleb Stegall suggests that &quot;the most distinctive characteristic Irving gives Ichabod is that of a psalm singer,&quot; and that Ichabod Crane is the &quot;most celebrated Covenanter in all of the literature.&quot;

=== Supernatural beliefs and local renown ===
Ichabod was described as being well-read in the literature of the supernatural and superstition. In the story, he was &quot;esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition, for he had read several books quite through, and was regarded a master of Cotton Mather&#x27;s &quot;History of New England Witchcraft,&quot; in which, by the way, he most firmly and potently believed.&quot; In addition, he &quot;took pleasure in reading old Mather&#x27;s direful tales till dusk after school. Moreover, no supernatural story or superstition was hard for him to believe.&quot; He would often share his beliefs and readings with others. Indeed, in the story, he &quot;would delight listeners equally by his anecdotes of witchcraft, and of the direful omens and portentous sights and sounds in the air, which prevailed in the earlier times of Connecticut; and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon comets and shooting stars, and with the fact that the world did absolutely turn round, and that they were half the time topsy-turvy!&quot;

Irving describes Ichabod as &quot;a man of some importance in the female circle of a rural neighborhood; being considered a kind of idle, gentleman-like personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to the rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior in learning only to the parson.&quot; Ichabod spent ample time in the company of the locals telling tales of the supernatural and discussing local gossip. He is described as &quot;like a travelling gazette, carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house so that his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction.&quot; It is also said that &quot;another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter evenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by the fire, with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along with the hearth, and listen to their marvelous tales of ghosts and goblins, and haunted fields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted houses, and particularly of the headless horseman, or Galloping Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes called him.&quot;

=== Katrina Van Tassel ===
Ichabod is said to have a &quot;soft and foolish heart towards the [opposite] sex.&quot; In the story, Irving writes regarding Ichabod: &quot;he would have passed a pleasant life of it, despite the Devil and all his works, if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to mortal man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of witches put together, and that was—a woman.&quot;

A turning point in the story occurs when Ichabod becomes enamoured of one Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter and only child of a wealthy farmer named Baltus Van Tassel, who pays little attention to his daughter other than to be proud of her merits when they are praised. On account of her father&#x27;s wealth (which Ichabod is eager to inherit), he begins to court Katrina, who seems to respond in kind. This attracts the attention of the town&#x27;s rowdy, Abraham &quot;Brom Bones&quot; Van Brunt, who also wants to marry Katrina and is challenged in this only by Ichabod. Despite Brom&#x27;s efforts to humiliate or punish the schoolmaster, Ichabod remains steadfast, and neither contestant seems able to gain any advantage throughout this rivalry.

Later, both men are invited to a harvest festival party at Van Tassel&#x27;s where Ichabod&#x27;s social skills far outshine Brom&#x27;s. After the party breaks up, Ichabod remains behind for &quot;a tête-à-tête with the heiress&quot;, where it is supposed that he makes a proposal of marriage to Katrina but, according to the narrator, &quot;Something, however ... must have gone wrong, for he certainly sallied forth, after no very great interval, with an air quite desolate and chapfallen&quot;, meaning that his proposal is refused, allegedly because her sole purpose in courting him was either to test or to increase Brom&#x27;s desire for her. Therefore, Ichabod leaves the house &quot;with the air of one who had been sacking a hen-roost, rather than a fair lady&#x27;s heart.&quot;

=== Encounter with the Headless Horseman ===
During his journey home, Ichabod encounters another traveller, who is eventually revealed to be the legendary Headless Horseman; the ghost of a Hessian soldier who was decapitated by a cannonball during the American Revolutionary War. Ichabod flees with the Headless Horseman pursuing him, eventually crossing a bridge near the Dutch burial ground. Because the ghost is incapable of crossing this bridge, Ichabod assumes that he is safe. However, before Ichabod can react, the Headless Horseman throws his severed head at him, knocking him from the back of his own horse and sending him &quot;tumbling headlong into the dust.&quot; The next morning, Ichabod&#x27;s hat is found abandoned near the church bell bridge, and close beside it is a shattered pumpkin. Ichabod is never seen in Sleepy Hollow again and is therefore presumed to have been spirited away by the Headless Horseman.

Later, &quot;an old farmer, who had been down to New York on a visit several years after, and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure was received&quot; suggests that Ichabod had been frightened by both the Horseman and the anticipated anger of his current landlord into leaving the town forever, later to become &quot;a justice of the ten-pound court&quot; in &quot;ten-pound part of the country.&quot; Katrina marries Brom, who is said to look &quot;exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related, and always laughed heartily at the mention of the pumpkin.&quot; These events &quot;led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter than he chose to tell.&quot; Therefore, it can be assumed that Brom himself was the Horseman, whose legend he took advantage of to rid himself of his rival.

== Adaptations in other media ==

*Will Rogers portrayed Crane in the 1922 silent film &quot;The Headless Horseman&quot;.
*Crane is one of the title characters in &quot;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot; (1949), which was produced by Walt Disney Productions and packaged with a companion 30-minute short &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; based on Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;. It is probably the best-known version, as it ran for years as part of the television Halloween special &quot;Disney&#x27;s Halloween Treat&quot; and is considered one of the truest adaptations of the Irving story. This animated interpretation features Bing Crosby as the narrator and sole voice actor of the entire 30-minute piece and extends both the role of Ichabod Crane to make his (Crane&#x27;s) singing that of a crooner instead of the nasal psalmodist described in the story and that of Brom Bones to include the latter as the singer of the song about the Horseman&#x27;s legend.
*Jeff Goldblum starred as Ichabod Crane in &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1980), and NBC-produced a made-for-television movie. In this version, the story ends with Ichabod arriving at Katrina&#x27;s house and the Headless Horseman returning to the dark forest after having dealt with an imposter.
*Ed Begley, Jr. portrayed Ichabod Crane in a 1985 adaptation by Lan O&#x27;Kun for &quot;Shelley Duvall&#x27;s Tall Tales and Legends&quot;, directed by Edd Griles, which also starred Beverly D&#x27;Angelo as Katrina, Tim Thomerson as Brom and Charles Durning as narrator Doffue van Tassel, Katrina&#x27;s uncle. This version definitively identifies Brom as the Headless Horseman who chases Ichabod but also adds a twist ending that takes place on the night after Halloween.
*Crane appears as a ghost in a third-season episode of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot; called &quot;The Tale of the Midnight Ride.&quot;
*The character is featured in a two-part Halloween episode of the PBS television series &quot;Wishbone&quot; (1997), in which Crane is portrayed by the title character. 
*Constable Ichabod Crane serves as the protagonist in &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1999), directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp. In this interpretation, he is a New York City policeman from a family of noble origin with an interest in forensic science sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of grisly murders to prove the merits of his style of the investigation, after he argues against the police&#x27;s current methods. As in the original story, his horse is named Gunpowder. Ichabod&#x27;s most notable traits in the movie include an ahead-of-his-time liking for post-mortem examinations, deduction, and scientific methods, as well as his being very quirky, skittish, and disturbed by death and blood, despite his occupation. His backstory is also explored: when he was seven his mother, an &quot;innocent child of Nature&quot; was &quot;murdered to save her soul&quot; by his father, &quot;a Bible black tyrant behind a mask of righteousness&quot;, which led to a loss of faith for him. It is Ichabod who finally releases the Hessian Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken) from the control of Lady van Tassel (Miranda Richardson), whom the Horseman takes to Hell with him. Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) is seen at the end of the movie going to New York with Ichabod, along with a boy who helped him in the investigation. Brom Bones (Casper Van Dien), who at one point does disguise himself as the Horseman and throws a pumpkin at Ichabod, is killed by the real Horseman halfway in the film.
*In 1999, a telefilm entitled &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; aired on Odyssey starring Brent Carver as Ichabod Crane. It was filmed in Montreal.
*The 1999 animated FoX TV special &quot;The Night of the Headless Horseman&quot; featured William H. Macy as the voice of Crane. This version has an ending that reveals that Brom (voiced by Luke Perry) had made a &quot;Devil&#x27;s bargain&quot; with the Horseman that he was forced to fulfil thirty years later.
*The 2004 TV movie &quot;The Hollow&quot; centres on a high school student named Ian Cranston (portrayed by Kevin Zegers), a descendant of Ichabod Crane.
*Tom Mison plays Crane in &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; (2013), an American supernatural/police drama television series. The series is considered a &quot;modern-day retelling&quot; with Crane being a former professor of history at Oxford University prior to the American Revolution, he came to America with the British before switching sides and becoming a spy for the Colonials. Having beheaded the Horseman in 1781, he was brought back to life in modern times with the Horseman due to their blood mixing when they died. This version of Crane also appears in the 2015 Halloween episode of the TV series &quot;Bones&quot;. Other mentions and references to the &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; TV series exist throughout the episode.
*Ichabod Crane is also featured in the 2013 episodic video game, &quot;The Wolf Among Us&quot;, developed and produced by Telltale Games. In the game, Crane (voiced by Roger L. Jackson) is the deputy mayor of Fabletown, a secret community of magical, fairytale beings who were exiled from their homelands centuries ago, and forced to live in the world of mundane humans. In episodes 2 through 3, Crane was revealed to have been soliciting prostitutes and using a magic spell to make them look like his assistant Snow White; Sheriff Bigby Wolf and Snow arrest Crane for this and embezzling Fabletown&#x27;s money to pay for them, but Crane is then kidnapped by the minions of the Crooked Man, the crime lord Crane owes money to.
*Ichabod Crane&#x27;s ghost, voiced by Taran Killam, is featured in an episode of the Disney Junior show &quot;Vampirina&quot;. In keeping with the show&#x27;s aim at entertaining young audiences, Crane and the Headless Horseman are revealed to be enemies due to &quot;the bridge incident&quot;. In the end, the two of them make up with one another when they realize that it was all due to one big misunderstanding.
*In 2022, Sean Persaud portrayed Ichabod Crane in &quot;Headless: A Sleepy Hollow Story&quot;, a modern-day web series adaptation where Ichabod agrees to help the Headless Horseman find his head and break his curse.

<doc id="601321" wikidata="Q1836057" url="?curid=601321" title="Tommy Atkins">
<text>Tommy Atkins (often just Tommy) is slang for a common soldier in the British Army. It was well established during the nineteenth century, but is particularly associated with the First World War. It can be used as a term of reference, or as a form of address. German soldiers would call out to &quot;Tommy&quot; across no man&#x27;s land if they wished to speak to a British soldier. French and Commonwealth troops would also call British soldiers &quot;Tommies&quot;. In more recent times, the term Tommy Atkins has been used less frequently, although the name &quot;Tom&quot; is occasionally still heard; private soldiers in the British Army&#x27;s Parachute Regiment are still referred to as &quot;Toms&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Tommy Atkins&quot; or &quot;Thomas Atkins&quot; has been used as a generic name for a common British soldier for many years. The origin of the term is a subject of debate, but it is known to have been used as early as 1743. A letter sent from Jamaica about a mutiny amongst the troops says &quot;except for those from N. America ye Marines and Tommy Atkins behaved splendidly&quot;.

A common belief is that the name was chosen by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, having been inspired by the bravery of a soldier at the Battle of Boxtel in 1794 during the Flanders Campaign. After a fierce engagement, the Duke, in command of the 33rd Regiment of Foot, purportedly spotted the best man-at-arms in the regiment, Private Thomas Atkins, terribly wounded. The private said, &quot;It&#x27;s all right, sir. It&#x27;s all in a day&#x27;s work,&quot; and died shortly after. According to the Imperial War Museum, this theory has Wellington choosing the name in 1843.

According to J. H. Leslie, writing in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; in 1912, &quot;Tommy Atkins&quot; was chosen as a generic name by the War Office in 1815, in every sample infantry form in the &quot;Soldiers Account Book&quot;, signing with a mark. The Cavalry form had Trumpeter William Jones and Sergeant John Thomas, though they did not use a mark. Leslie observes the same name in the 1837 &quot;King&#x27;s Regulations&quot;, pages 204 and 210, and later editions. Leslie comments that this disproves the anecdote about the Duke of Wellington selecting the name in 1843.

Richard Holmes, in the prologue to his 2005 book, &quot;Tommy&quot;, states that:

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states its origin as &quot;arising out of the casual use of this name in the specimen forms given in the official regulations from 1815 onward&quot;; the citation references &quot;Collection of Orders, Regulations, etc.&quot;, pp. 75–87, published by the War Office, 31 August 1815. The name is used for an exemplary cavalry and infantry soldier; other names used included William Jones and John Thomas. Thomas Atkins continued to be used in the &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Account Book&quot; until the early 20th century.

A further suggestion was given in 1900 by an army chaplain named Reverend E. J. Hardy. He wrote of an incident during the Sepoy Rebellion in 1857. When most of the Europeans in Lucknow were fleeing to the British Residency for protection, a private of the 32nd Regiment of Foot remained on duty at an outpost. Despite the pleas of his comrades, he insisted that he must remain at his post. He was killed at his post, and the Reverend Hardy wrote that &quot;His name happened to be Tommy Atkins and so, throughout the Mutiny Campaign, when a daring deed was done, the doer was said to be &#x27;a regular Tommy Atkins&#x27;&quot;.

==Popular references==
Rudyard Kipling published the poem &quot;Tommy&quot; (part of the &quot;Barrack-Room Ballads&quot;, which were dedicated &quot;To T.A.&quot;) in 1892. In reply, William McGonagall wrote &quot;Lines in Praise of Tommy Atkins&quot; in 1898, which was an attack on what McGonagall saw as the disparaging portrayal of Tommy in Kipling&#x27;s poem.

In 1893, for the musical play &quot;A Gaiety Girl&quot;, Henry Hamilton (lyrics) and Samuel Potter (music) wrote the song &quot;Private Tommy Atkins&quot; for the baritone C. Hayden Coffin. It was immediately published by Willcocks &amp; Co. Ltd. in London and published by T. B. Harms &amp; Co. in New York the next year. The song was also reintroduced into later performances of San Toy for Hayden Coffin. He recalled singing it on Ladysmith Night (1 March 1900) where &quot;the audience were roused to such a pitch of enthusiasm, that they rose to their feet, and commenced to shower money on to the stage&quot;.

In the children&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Indian in the Cupboard&quot; (1980) by Lynne Reid Banks, toy soldiers representing various historical wars are brought to life by magic. One is a World War I medic who says his name is Tommy Atkins. Steve Coogan plays this character in the 1995 film adaptation.

&quot;Tommy cooker&quot; was a nickname for a British soldier&#x27;s portable stove.

<text>The Douglas DC-5 (Douglas Commercial Model 5) was a 16-to-22-seat, twin-engine propeller aircraft intended for shorter routes than the Douglas DC-3 or Douglas DC-4. By the time it entered commercial service in 1940, many airlines were canceling orders for aircraft. Consequently, only five civilian DC-5s were built. With the Douglas Aircraft Company already converting to World War II military production, the DC-5 was soon overtaken by world events, although a limited number of military variants were produced.

==Design and development==

The DC-5 was developed in 1938 as a 16-22 seat civilian airliner, designed to use either Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1690 Hornet or Wright R-1820 Cyclone radial engines. It was the first airliner to combine shoulder wings and tricycle landing gear, a configuration that is still common in turboprop airliners and military transport aircraft, although the modern versions are actually high wing, as the structure sits atop the fuselage shell rather than intersecting a significant segment.
The tricycle landing gear was innovative for transport airplanes. It provided better ground handling and better ground visibility for the pilots.

The fuselage was about two feet above the ground, so loading of passengers and cargo was easier than aircraft with the then-standard conventional landing gear.
A very early design change was the addition of a 15-degree dihedral to the horizontal tail group to negate a hint of an aeroelasticity problem. The dorsal strake, introduced in minimal form and expanded to full growth on the Boeing 307, is also well developed on the DC-5. Another significant modification was adding exhaust stacks to the engine nacelles, which was retroactively incorporated after the series entered production. An unusual optical trick was applied to the prototype. The top of the vertical stabilizer and the outline of the engine nacelles were painted a darker color following the aircraft&#x27;s contour, making the tail and engines appear somewhat smaller and the aircraft sleeker.

Prior to US entry into World War II, one prototype and four production aircraft were built.

==Operational history==

The prototype DC-5, Douglas serial 411, was built at El Segundo, California, with 1,000 hp Wright R-1820-44 Cyclone engines. The aircraft made its first flight on February 20, 1939, with Carl Cover at the controls. This sole prototype (configured with just eight seats) became the personal aircraft of William Boeing, who named it &quot;Rover&quot;. It was later impressed into the US Navy and converted for military use as an R3D-3 variant in February 1942.

The first customer for the type was KLM, who ordered four planes. Pennsylvania Central (later renamed Capital Airlines) ordered six and SCADTA (&quot;Sociedad Colombo-Alemana de Transportes Aéreos&quot;), ancestor of Avianca, ordered two. When Douglas factories went into war production, DC-5 production was curtailed to build additional SBD Dauntless dive bombers for the United States Navy (USN) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) and so only KLM received the high-winged airliner.

A dozen DC-5s were completed, of which four went into commercial service with KLM. The first two initially were put to use by the KLM West-Indisch Bedrijf and flew between Paramaribo in Surinam (now Suriname) and Curaçao in the Dutch colonial territory of the same name. The other two were sold to the Netherlands-Indies Government for use by KNILM (with no affiliations with KLM, despite having their head offices in Amsterdam) from Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia) from 1940 onwards. The first pair were later also transferred to KNILM. Of these four aircraft, three were used for the 1942 evacuation of civilians from Java to Australia; the fourth was damaged in an air strike by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force at Batavia Kemajoran Airport on February 9, 1942, and abandoned. Japanese forces captured and subsequently repaired it for testing in Japan during 1943. This DC-5, painted in camouflage with Japanese Imperial Army Air Force markings, was later used as a transport in the Japanese Home Islands.
The three remaining aircraft made their way safely to Australia where they were sold to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and operated for the Allied Directorate of Air Transport (ADAT). Two were destroyed by the end of 1942, the other was transferred to Australian National Airways (ANA), which operated it throughout the war on behalf of ADAT. In 1944 the USAAF retroactively designated the three aircraft C-110 for administrative purposes.

In 1939, the USN ordered seven aircraft. Three were delivered as R3D-1s, the first of which crashed before delivery. The remaining four were R3D-2s for the USMC and were equipped with 1,015 hp R-1820-44 engines, a large cargo hold, and 22 seats for paratroopers.

After World War II, production of the DC-5 was not resumed because of the abundance of surplus C-47 aircraft, converted for civil service as DC-3s. In 1948, the last surviving DC-5 was sold by Australian National Airways to another Australian airline, which smuggled it to Israel for military use. The aircraft arrived at Haifa in May 1948, and from there it went to Sde Dov, where its markings were removed and the name &quot;Yankee Pasha – The Bagel Lancer&quot; was crudely painted on the nose by hand. The aircraft joined 103 Squadron at Ramat David Airbase. Because Israel was in the midst of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, it was occasionally used as a bomber as well as flying transport missions. On bomber missions the aft loading door was removed and bombs were rolled out of the opening &quot;by a judicious shove from a crewman&#x27;s foot.&quot; The operational record of the aircraft is in dispute as authoritative sources do not verify its combat service.

When the war ended and 103 Squadron moved, the DC-5 was left behind at Ramat David. It eventually found its way to a technical school where it was used extensively as a ground instruction airframe at Haifa Airport. When it was no longer serviceable due to a lack of spares, the airframe was stripped of its engines and instruments and the last DC-5 was reduced to scrap in Israel sometime after 1955.

<doc id="601325" wikidata="Q4763599" url="?curid=601325" title="Anglo-Chinese Junior College">
<text>Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC) is a junior college in Singapore that offers a two-year pre-university programme leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examination. Established in 1977, Anglo-Chinese Junior College is the junior college arm of the Anglo-Chinese School family of Methodist schools in Singapore.

==History==
The history of the school dates back to 1913 when the Anglo-Chinese College building project and the fund-raising initiative were started by Reverend J S Nagle. He started negotiations with the British colonial government about setting up a college to prepare students for British university education. The proposal was turned down by the government, who decided in favour of establishing Raffles College to commemorate the centenary of the founding of Singapore.

In 1970 the ACS Board of Governors submitted their recommendations for a junior college to the Singapore government. A 6-hectare site at Rochester Park on a 30-year lease was given for the construction of the college. Thus, on 3 January 1977, Anglo-Chinese Junior College became the fifth junior college to be established in line with the Ministry of Education&#x27;s policy on pre-university education, equivalent to a British Sixth-form college, and welcoming 968 students in Pre-U 1 and Pre-U 2. To start with, it was an all-male institution. Its main complex was equipped with three lecture theatres, a library, the Tan Chin Tuan Auditorium and eight laboratories. The Shaw Sports Complex housed a 400-metre bitumen track, tennis, volleyball, basketball and sepak takraw courts.

In 1986, an expansion of the college was proposed and approved by the Ministry of Education three years later. The extension included a new four-storey Library Block to contain the Oldham Library on two levels, two lecture theatres and two micro-computer laboratories. A multi-purpose void deck was built under the extension for events to be held in the college. A new 8-lane 400m track and soccer field with floodlighting capacity was also included. This phase was completed in 1991 and cost $3.5 million.

On 1 March 1992, the college&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Day, the ACJC Sports Complex started construction. The complex contains two swimming pools, a gymnasium, badminton courts and billiard facilities. A multi-purpose hall was also built in the complex, together with a lounge, dance studios, and a Heritage Room where trophies and memorabilia are showcased. The Complex also houses a cafe on the pool deck. $500,000 for the complex were raised through the college&#x27;s annual carnival, Fun-O-Rama, and other carnivals.
In line with MOE&#x27;s requirements, such as IT-enabled facilities, a major renovation was planned for the college. In 1999, the College Upgrading Project was started at a total cost of $21 million. The main block was refurbished and a 600-seat lecture theatre and viewing gallery built, with a concourse linking it to the lobby of the building. An Oldham Wing and covered walkways to all parts of the campus were built. The renovations was completed by December 2002.

The Anglo-Chinese Junior College Center for Performing Arts is the main venue for performing arts programmes at ACJC. Commissioned in May 2008, it hosts a fully equipped theatre, a black box, a dance studio and other places for the performing arts. The CPA is home to many of the College&#x27;s musical and theatrical productions, and the facilities are also available for use by the community.

==Achievements==

===Performing arts===

====Choir====
The ACJC Choir is the four-time winner of the Singapore Youth Festival &quot;Choir of the Year&quot; award (1997, 1995, 1993, 1989) and holder of the &quot;Best Junior College Choir&quot; title (2003, 2001, 1997, 1995). In 2005 the choir was awarded the Gold with Honours award in the Singapore Youth Festival, giving a near-monopoly of the nation&#x27;s highest choral awards from 1989 to 2005. The Choir achieved the Gold award at the 2007 SYF Central Judging and the Gold with Honours awards at the 2009 and 2011 SYF Judging.

The Choir participates in overseas competitions and tours. It first gained international exposure on a choral tour to Japan in 1989. Since then it has toured South Korea (1990) and the United States (1993), where it performed at the headquarters of the United Nations and the White House. The Choir was invited by the International Federation for Choral Music to perform at the 4th World Symposium on Choral Music in Sydney, Australia in 1996. It remains the only Singaporean choir to have been invited to the event.

Since 1997 the Choir has won international competitions in Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. In 2006 the ACJC Choir competed at the Llangollen International Eisteddfod in Wales and came second in the Youth Category and first in the Mixed Category.

In June 2008 the ACJC Choir emerged as the only choir with three Gold medals at the 3rd Festa Choralis International Choir Competition in Bratislava, Slovakia. The only Asian choir at the competition, it competed alongside choirs from Poland, Great Britain, the Czech Republic, Russia and Slovakia in the Mixed Choir (Adult), Youth Choir (up to 19 years old) and Folk Song Categories. In all three categories, the ACJC Choir won gold medals with top marks and was the only choir in the competition to whom the adjudicators awarded a perfect score of 100 points.

The Choir organises the annual concert &quot;An Evening With Friends&quot;, and performs regularly at community and ministerial events.

===Sports===
ACJC has won many championships in bowling, rugby, softball, swimming, water polo, badminton, golf, billiards, netball, air rifle, football, squash, tennis and track and field.

The ACJC cross-country team was successful in the national schools&#x27; championships for 2001, 2002 and 2003 for the boys&#x27; team. The girls&#x27; team won the championship in 1999 and has consistently emerged among the top 3 teams since. In 2002 and 2003, the boys&#x27; team won individual champions. Its latest win in the national inter-school cross-country championships was in 2007.

In rugby, ACJC has held the &#x27;A&#x27; Division title since 2000 but lost it to longtime rival Raffles Junior College in 2004. In 2005 the title was finally regained by ACJC. Waterpolo has also resulted in numerous wins for the college.

In bowling, ACJC has also won many championships in the girls category, having retained the &#x27;A&#x27; division title since 2018, with a historic clean sweep of all the medals in 2021. The boys team has also constantly emerged top 3 since their last win in 2015, finishing 2nd in the 2022 National School Games.

<doc id="601331" wikidata="Q3380008" url="?curid=601331" title="Johnny Micheal Spann">
<text>Johnny Micheal &quot;Mike&quot; Spann (March 1, 1969 – November 25, 2001) was an American paramilitary officer in the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Special Activities Division. Spann was the first American killed in combat during the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. He died at the Qala-i-Jangi fortress during an al-Qaeda prisoner uprising.

==Early life==
Johnny Micheal Spann was from the small town of Winfield, Alabama, the son of real estate agent Johnny Spann and his wife Gail. His name was spelled &quot;Micheal&quot; because of his mother&#x27;s Irish ancestry. Spann graduated in 1987 from Winfield City High School, where he played football. At 17, he earned his private pilot license and later became a certified rescue diver and parachutist.

==Military service==
In December 1991, while attending Auburn University, he joined the Marine Corps Reserve. After graduating from Auburn with a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice/Law Enforcement in 1992, Spann attended the Marines&#x27; Officer Candidates School at Quantico, Virginia. He had originally wanted to go into aviation, but became a field artillery officer and eventually served with the 2nd Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company. He specialized in close air support. In 1997, he was second-in-command for UNITAS, a joint exercise expedition in Latin America and Africa. He served six years with the United States Marine Corps and was stationed in Okinawa, Japan and at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, eventually achieving the rank of Captain.

==CIA service==
Spann joined the CIA in June 1999 and trained at The Farm, where he met his future wife Shannon Verleur (née Joy) and was known as &quot;Silent Mike&quot;. On completion of training, he was assigned to Ground Branch of the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division. In early 2001, he was on a training course with a fellow former Marine called Brian (who as of 2021 was head of the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Center) and discussed the Al Qaeda threat and the USS &quot;Cole&quot;, which had been bombed in October 2000. &quot;What would we be doing right now as a country if the &quot;Cole&quot; had snapped in half and gone to the bottom of the Gulf of Aden?&quot; Spann asked Brian. &quot;Would we be on a training course?&quot; Later in 2001, Spann undertook temporary duty in Uzbekistan, where he helped train Uzbek commandos, and the Balkans. Spann returned from the Balkans on September 8, 2001 was inside CIA headquarters on 9/11 and was angered by the order to evacuate, asking colleagues: &quot;Why are we leaving when we can stay and do something?&quot; On October 17, 2001, Spann was one of the eight members of the CIA&#x27;s Team Alpha who were inserted into the Darya Suf Valley, south of Mazar-i-Sharif. Team Alpha was flown into Afghanistan in two Black Hawk helicopters from the Karshi-Khanabad Air Base in Uzbekistan. The eight were the first Americans behind enemy lines after 9/11; the CIA&#x27;s Jawbreaker team had arrived on September 26, but were located in terrain controlled by the Northern Alliance in the Panjshir Valley. Three days later, they were joined by 12 Green Berets from ODA 595. On October 27, Spann led a three-man team to Yakawlang, sixty miles west of Bamiyan, to prepare the way for the CIA’s Team Delta and ODA 553. CIA medic Mark Rausenberger and Captain Justin Sapp, a Green Beret, were under his command. Spann insisted that the Landing Zone at Yakawlang be named after his baby son, despite opposition from CIA headquarters. &quot;There are no rules here,” he said. &quot;We’re making the decisions and it’s going to be called LZ Jake.&quot; Spann&#x27;s three-man team rejoined Team Alpha just before the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif on November 9.

===Death at Qala-i-Jangi===

Spann was killed during an uprising at the Qala-i-Jangi compound near Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan. Earlier that day, he and David Tyson, a CIA case officer and Uzbek-language specialist based in Tashkent, questioned John Walker Lindh, an American citizen and Taliban member, and other prisoners. Around 400 Al Qaeda prisoners had surrendered on November 24 and been kept overnight in the cellar of the Pink House, in the southern half of the fort. Spann focused intently on Lindh after another prisoner identified him as an Irishman. Spann asked Lindh: &quot;Do you know the people here you’re working with are terrorists and killed other Muslims? There were several hundred Muslims killed in the bombing in New York City. Is that what the Quran teaches? I don’t think so. Are you going to talk to us?” Lindh remained silent. Two Afghan doctors, interviewed by author Toby Harnden, witnessed Spann&#x27;s final moments. They saw the CIA officer, who was about five yards away from them, swing around and raise his AKMS rifle to his shoulder as the prisoners revolted amid sounds of gunfire and grenade explosions. Prisoners were rushing out, straight at Spann. The doctors saw Spann shoot two or three of them with his Kalashnikov before the Qatari prisoner and others who had been sitting close to the Pink House stood up and jumped on Spann from behind, pushing him to the ground. Spann pulled out his Glock 19 pistol and fired one or two shots before he was overwhelmed, disappearing beneath a pile of prisoners desperately trying to seize his weapons. Tyson ran toward Spann after hearing his comrade shout: &quot;Dave, Dave, Dave.&quot; Tyson then used his Browning Hi-Power pistol to shoot dead four Al Qaeda prisoners on top of Spann. Kicking Spann and seeing blood on the ground, Tyson concluded Spann was dead. Tyson grabbed Spann&#x27;s AKMS rifle and used it, and other weapons, to fight his way into the northern half of the fort, killing at least a dozen and possibly up to 40 Al Qaeda prisoners.

Afghans recovered his body on November 28 as CIA officers looked on. After Afghan Northern Alliance troops, backed by U.S. airstrikes, US Army Special Forces and British Special Boat Service members, eventually quelled the uprising. Some sources said that Spann fought with his AK-47 until it ran out of ammunition, then drew his pistol until it, too, emptied, then resorted to hand-to-hand combat before finally being overcome. In a news report by &quot;Time&quot; published shortly after the events, it was stated that Spann fought only with his pistol, killing three attackers before being overwhelmed by the more numerous prisoners.

&quot;Time&quot; reported shortly after the events:

A military autopsy concluded that Spann died from two gunshot wounds to the head &quot;resulting in severe, rapidly fatal injury to the brain.&quot; One was a contact wound, indicating a gun had been held to his temple and a bullet fired through his head, exiting on the left. The other wound was &quot;intermediate range,&quot; meaning that the shot had been fired close enough to leave powder marks. The second bullet had entered the right side of his forehead and exited from the back. Spann&#x27;s body was flown back to the U.S. via Germany, where the autopsy was carried out. It was flown from Ramstein on board a US government Boeing 757-200 jet normally assigned as Vice President Dick Cheney’s Air Force Two. The 757 was being used by George Tenet, the CIA director, who had been in Islamabad meeting with President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan. Spann&#x27;s casket was also accompanied by Alex Hernandez, deputy chief of Team Alpha, and the head of the CIA&#x27;s Ground Branch.

===Burial and memorial===

Spann was buried in Section 34 of Arlington National Cemetery on December 10, 2001. His widow Shannon Spann delivered the eulogy, saying: &quot;I want to tell you that my husband is a hero. But Mike is a hero not because of the way that he died, but rather because of the way that he lived. Mike was prepared to give his life in Afghanistan, because he already gave his life every day to us at home.” Spann was memorialized with the 79th star on the CIA Memorial Wall at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia that commemorates individuals who died in the line of duty. Spann was posthumously awarded the Intelligence Star and the Exceptional Service Medallion. Because the Intelligence Star is considered the equivalent of the U.S. military&#x27;s Silver Star, Spann was approved for burial in Arlington National Cemetery. A memorial to Mike Spann was established at Qala-i-Jangi in December 2002. A forward operating base was named in his honor. The Alabama legislature named a section of Alabama Highway 129 the &quot;Johnny Micheal Spann Highway&quot; in his honor.

==Personal life==
Spann lived in Manassas Park, Virginia, and was survived by his wife, Shannon Joy, also a CIA officer, and three children, Alison, Emily, and Jake. His ex-wife, Kathryn Ann Webb, mother of two of his children, Alison and Emily, died of cancer five weeks after Spann&#x27;s death. Shannon Spann later married fellow CIA officer Thys Debruyn and had a second son, Lucas. Alison Spann became a journalist and in 2021 was a news anchor in Biloxi, Mississippi. Emily Spann graduated from her father’s alma mater, Auburn. Jake Spann entered Syracuse University.

<doc id="601334" wikidata="Q4823546" url="?curid=601334" title="Australia (Manic Street Preachers song)">
<text>&quot;Australia&quot; is a song by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 2 December 1996 through Epic Records as the fourth and final single from the fourth studio album, &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; (1996). The song peaked at number seven in the UK Singles Chart and was the fourth consecutive top-10 hit for the band.

==Background==
The sentiment of the song is that Australia is just about the furthest one can go to get away from their home in Wales and is a metaphor for Nicky Wire&#x27;s desire to escape from the emotional turmoil caused by the disappearance of his close friend and co-lyricist, Richey Edwards.

The music helps the lyrics convey the sense of freedom, featuring heavy guitar sound coupled with a raw emotion, and a crescendo bolstered by Sean Moore&#x27;s drumming.

==Release==
On 14 December 1996, &quot;Australia&quot; reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart, giving Manic Street Preachers their fourth consecutive top-10 hit, and charted for nine weeks. With this, all singles from &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; charted within the top 10 in the UK. It also made an appearance on &quot;Forever Delayed&quot;, the band&#x27;s greatest hits album, released in November 2002.

The first CD included &quot;Velocity Girl&quot;, &quot;Take the Skinheads Bowling&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; (all three being cover versions of songs originally performed by Primal Scream, Camper Van Beethoven and Frankie Valli, respectively) and the cassette featured a live recording of &quot;A Design for Life&quot;. All 3 of the CD cover versions would later feature on the &quot;Lipstick Traces&quot; compilation album in 2003 (although &quot;Take the Skinheads Bowling&quot; was re-recorded). 

==Legacy==
In October 2011, &quot;NME&quot; placed &quot;Australia&quot; at number 150 on its list of &quot;the 150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot;. The song was the theme tune to the Nickelodeon UK sitcom &quot;Renford Rejects&quot; and has also been used in adverts for the Australian Tourist Commission.

==Track listings==
All music was written by James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore except where indicated. All lyrics were written by Nicky Wire except where indicated.

<doc id="601365" wikidata="Q535352" url="?curid=601365" title="Pulmonary vein">
<text>The pulmonary veins are the veins that transfer oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. The largest pulmonary veins are the four &quot;main pulmonary veins&quot;, two from each lung that drain into the left atrium of the heart. The pulmonary veins are part of the pulmonary circulation.

==Structure==
There are four main pulmonary veins, two from each lung – an inferior and a superior main vein, emerging from each hilum. The main pulmonary veins receive blood from three or four feeding veins in each lung, and drain into the left atrium. The peripheral feeding veins do not follow the bronchial tree. They run between the pulmonary segments from which they drain the blood. 

At the root of the lung, the right superior pulmonary vein lies in front of and a little below the pulmonary artery; the inferior is situated at the lowest part of the lung hilum. Behind the pulmonary artery is the bronchus. The right main pulmonary veins (contains oxygenated blood) pass behind the right atrium and superior vena cava; the left in front of the descending thoracic aorta.

===Variation===
Occasionally the three lobar veins on the right side remain separate, and not infrequently the two left lobar veins end by a common opening into the left atrium. Therefore, the number of pulmonary veins opening into the left atrium can vary between three and five in the healthy population.

The two left lobar veins may be united as a single pulmonary vein in about 25% of people; the two right veins may be united in about 3%.

==Function==

The pulmonary veins play an essential role in respiration, by receiving blood that has been oxygenated in the alveoli and returning it to the left atrium.

==Clinical significance==
As part of the pulmonary circulation they carry oxygenated blood back to the heart, as opposed to the veins of the systemic circulation which carry deoxygenated blood. By definition, a vein is a blood vessel that carries blood to the heart, whether oxygenated or deoxygenated. 

A groundbreaking study published in 1998 identified the pulmonary vein as the predominant trigger for atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation frequently results from bursts of tachycardia that originate in muscle bundles extending from the atrium to the pulmonary veins. Pulmonary vein anatomy is highly variable among atrial fibrillation patients. Pulmonary vein isolation by transcatheter ablation can restore sinus rhythm. As atrial fibrillation becomes more persistent, the junction between the pulmonary veins and the left atrium becomes less of an initiator and the left atrium becomes an independent source of arrhythmias. Pulmonary vein isolation ablation technology has used thermal methods (radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation), which can damage adjacent tissues, notably the esophagus, lung or phrenic nerve. Electroporation, however, eliminates the risk of thermal damage. Atrial fibrillation most often recurs after ablation because of pulmonary vein reconnection. 

On chest X-ray, the diameters of pulmonary veins increases from upper to lower lobes, from 3 mm at the first intercoastal space, to 6 mm just above the diaphragm.

A rare genetic defect of the pulmonary veins can cause them to drain into the pulmonary circulation in whole or in part, this is known as a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (or drainage), or partial anomalous pulmonary connection, respectively.

<text>The Belgian Shepherd (), also known as the Belgian Sheepdog () or the Chien de Berger Belge, is a Belgian breed of herding dog of medium size. It is bred in four distinct varieties based on coat type and colour: the long-haired black Groenendael; the rough-haired fawn Laekenois; the short-haired fawn Malinois, and the long-haired fawn Tervuren. The American Kennel Club considers the four varieties to be separate breeds.

The breed descends from a common type of shepherd dog found throughout Western Europe that includes such modern breeds as the Bouvier des Ardennes, Dutch Shepherd and German Shepherd, and was a common sight in the service of Belgian shepherds for centuries. At the end of the nineteenth century a breed club was formed and attempts were made to standardise the breed.

Its historical role was as a herding dog. It is also commonly kept as a companion dog, or used as an assistance dog, detection dog, guard dog, guide dog, police dog or search and rescue dog. It has a long history of being used by Belgian police as well as military forces, serving for Belgian armed forces in both World Wars, as well as US Army since then. In the twenty-first century it is in use by a number of armed forces worldwide in a variety of roles.

==History==
The Belgian Shepherd descends from the same common type of herding dog as similar Western European breeds such as the Bouvier des Ardennes, the Dutch Shepherd and the German Shepherd, and for centuries was used by Belgian shepherds for this task. Unlike in other European countries where, throughout the nineteenth century, shepherd breeds were standardised and breeders made efforts to perpetuate their breeds, by the end of the century the Belgian Shepherd was becoming obsolete and was at danger of extinction. In 1891, the Club de Chien Berger Belge was formed with the purpose of saving the type and a team led by Adolphe Reul of the Cureghem Veterinary School conducted a field survey of the type. As the Belgian Shepherd had for centuries been bred for working ability with little consideration given to form, Reul found the type to vary greatly in appearance. As a part of their work, Reul&#x27;s team assembled 117 specimens and began the process of standardising them into distinct varieties. Classifying them as a single breed, initially Reul&#x27;s team divided the breed into six different varieties based on coat type and colour; between 1892 when the first breed standard was drafted and 1956, as few as two varieties and as many as eight were recognised by either the Club de Chien Berger Belge or the Société Royale Saint-Hubert.

In 1905 it was decided that interbreeding between the different varieties should be forbidden, but the disruptions caused by the First World War resulted in a decline in breed numbers, so in 1920 it was decided matings between the varieties should be allowed in order to preserve the breed and avoid issues resulting from inbreeding. The Second World War once again threatened the viability of the breed and in late 1945, it was decided once again that matings between dogs of the different varieties was to be encouraged, and through careful breeding the Belgian Shepherd recovered in numbers. In 1956 the current breed standard was adopted and it specified the four varieties known today; the Groenendael, Laekenois, Malinois and Tervuren.

The Groenendael variety is believed to have been created in 1885 by Nicholas Rose, owner of the Château de Groenendael. Rose owned a long-haired, black Belgian Shepherd bitch called &quot;Petite&quot;, liking her look so much he spent over a year searching for a suitable mate, eventually finding a dog named &quot;Piccard D&#x27;Uccle&quot; who belonged to a shepherd called Mr Beernaert. These two are considered the foundation stock of the variety. Their finest progeny were called &quot;Duc de Groenendael&quot; and &quot;Barroness&quot; who were mated widely to Belgian Shepherds of different appearances with the black progeny retained. Initially Rose had wanted to name the variety the &quot;Rose&quot;, but it was deemed this could cause confusion given their black colour so they were instead named after his château, Groenendael. During the First World War, Groenendaels were used by the Belgian Army to locate wounded soldiers and carry messages. Their bravery was recognised by U.S. soldiers during the war and examples were imported to the U.S. in the following years; to this day in the US the name Belgian Shepherd or Belgian Sheepdog is commonly used to refer to the Groenendael.

The Malinois variety was said to be the first variety to breed true to type and initially they became so well-known in Belgium that at one time the other varieties were collectively called &quot;other-than-Malinois&quot;, it was the Malinois that the other varieties were gauged against. The variety takes its name from the Mechelen region (called Malines in French), where it was the predominant coat type used by the local shepherds.

The Laekenois variety has always been the rarest; they take their name from the Château de Laeken, a residence of the Belgian royal family. The Laekenois was a favourite of Queen Marie Henriette, who frequently watched them in the service of the shepherds who grazed the royal domains around the château; this patronage contributed to their popularity at the time. In addition to being used as herding dogs, rough-haired Belgian Shepherds were traditionally used as guard dogs in the regions surrounding Boom, guarding valuable linens put out to bleach in the sun.

The Tervuren variety is believed to have been created when a brewer, M. Corbeel, bred his fawn long-haired Belgian Shepherd pair &quot;Tom&quot; and &quot;Poes&quot;, one of their progeny was a long-haired fawn bitch named &quot;Miss&quot; who was purchased by a M. Deanhieux. Miss was bred with Duc de Groenendael, the foundation sire of the Groenendael variety, and the fawn progeny became the Tervuren variety who take their name from the region of Tervuren. The Tervuren variety is considered particularly robust and healthy and in Europe a number of breeders use them to reinforce the bloodlines of other varieties, particularly the Groenendael.

The Groenendael remains the most numerous variety, followed by the Tervuren. The number of Malinois is growing, while the Laekenois remains comparatively rare.

===Kennel club classification===
Most of the world&#x27;s national kennel clubs including the Société Royale Saint-Hubert, as well as the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, recognise the Belgian Shepherd as a single breed with four distinct varieties. The American Kennel Club recognises the four varieties as separate breeds, leading to some difficulties for American breeders who breed from imported European stock: European Groenendaels in particular can whelp Tervuren-coloured pups; in most of the world these can be registered as Tervurens, whereas in the United States they would be disqualified from registration.

==Appearance==
The Belgian Shepherd is a medium-sized athletic breed with a body built for endurance. Dogs typically stand between , with bitches being on average shorter than dogs. They usually weigh between ; the breed standard states the ideal height is for dogs and for bitches. The breed has a long, slender head with triangular, erect ears that are rounded at the base, and a long, narrow but balanced muzzle. According to the breed standard a dog that stands 62 centimetres at the withers should have a head long and a muzzle approximately half that length. The body is muscular but not overly heavy; body length from shoulder to haunches is approximately the same as the height at the withers, proportionally slightly longer in bitches; the topline is straight and the belly neither low-slung nor overly high like that of a sighthound. The chest is deep but not overly broad; the neck is muscular, widening at the shoulders with a slight arch at the nape; the tail is strong and of medium length, and curves upwards slightly at the level of the knee. The forelegs are straight and well-boned, the hind legs muscular and powerful; the legs are not overly heavy.

===Varieties===
The four varieties vary principally in their coat types and colours. The breed standard describes three coat varieties; long-haired, short-haired and rough-haired. Long-haired dogs have a long, smooth coat with short hair on their faces, ears and legs although there is long feathering on the rear of the legs, they have an abundant mane on their neck and chest, particularly long hair on the rear of their thighs and a bushy tail that forms a plume. Short-haired dogs have particularly short hair on the faces, ears and lower portion of their legs, short over the rest of the body and slightly longer on the neck and tail. Rough-haired dogs have a coat that is rough, dry and approximately long over the body, they have shorter hair on the top of the muzzle and legs and, unlike the other coat types, they have long hair on the face and muzzle.

====Groenendael====
The Groenendael variety is long-haired, it has a solid black double coat, the outer coat is straight and particularly long around the shoulders, neck and chest; they have short hair on the face, and well feathered legs and tail.

====Laekenois====
The Laekenois variety is rough-haired, its coat is fawn in colour with discreet black overlay and is harsh, dry and normally slightly tangled in appearance; it has a bristled, feathered muzzle and limited feathering on the legs and tail. According to the breed standard, black overlay means the tips of the hair are black but not in patches or stripes such as brindle.

====Malinois====
The Malinois variety is short-haired, it is fawn in colour with black overlay, with a charcoal-coloured face and extremities.

====Tervuren====
The Tervuren variety is long-haired like the Groenendael; its double coat is typically fawn in colour with black overlay and with black extremities, although grey with black is known. It has a ruff of long hair around the neck and feathering on the legs.

==Temperament==
Belgian Shepherds are known to be highly intelligent, alert and sensitive; they are typically highly trainable, vigilant and hard-working with a strong guarding instinct making them protective of property and family, and very well suited for service with security services. The Groenendael and Tervueren varieties have a reputation for occasionally being snappy, making them less suitable as companion dogs for children; the Laekenois, whilst considered very good with children, can occasionally be troublesome with other dogs. The Belgian Shepherd responds well to training, and ideally requires training from an early age. The breed is very active – particularly the Malinois, which may reflect its continued breeding for security roles. While Belgian Shepherds of all coat types require ample exercise, the breed adapts well to living indoors. 

==Use==
The Belgian Shepherd, particularly in the Groenendael, Laekenois and Tervuren varieties, is predominantly kept as a pet or companion dog; all of the varieties may compete in obedience competitions and Schutzhund. The dogs are versatile and are often trained for use as assistance dogs, detection dogs, guard dogs, guide dogs, police dogs, and search and rescue dogs.

In recent times, the Laekenois has been employed by the Belgian Army in a variety of roles (in addition to the longstanding use of the Malinois), and the Tervuren is frequently used by government organisations as a drug detection dog. The Malinois in particular has become increasingly popular with customs, military, border guard and police forces; organisations that utilise the Malinois include the United States Armed Forces, the United States Secret Service, the Israel Defense Forces&#x27; Oketz Unit, the Australian Defence Force, and the anti-poaching canine unit at the Kruger National Park.

==Health==
A UK study found a life expectancy of 12 years for the Malinois and 13.8 years for the Tervuren compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. The Société Royale Saint-Hubert recommends all four varieties are tested for hip and elbow dysplasia and that the Malinois be tested for epilepsy. The working lines of the Malinois have been associated with Rage syndrome. A genetic polymorphism in the dopamine transporter gene has been linked to Rage syndrome, and dogs at risk of passing the genotype on to offspring can be identified through genetic testing.

==Notable examples==
*Conan, United States Army Malinois that assisted in the capture and killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
*Diesel, French police Malinois that was posthumously awarded the PDSA Dickin Medal after she was killed in the 2015 Saint-Denis raid.
*K9 Killer, Kruger National Park anti-poaching dog Malinois awarded the PDSA Gold Medal for assisting in the capture of 115 poachers.
*King Tut, US President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s pet Malinois.
*Kuga, Australian Army Malinois awarded the Dickin Medal after capturing an insurgent whilst shot during the War in Afghanistan.
*Mali, British Army Malinois awarded the Dickin Medal after completing a mission whilst injured during the War in Afghanistan.
*Meadow, the first K9 to work full time at a high school or college in the state of New Jersey to prevent school shootings. K9 Meadow is named in honor of Meadow Pollack who was murdered on 14 February 2018 during the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting.
*Yoda, a U.S. Border Control Malinois that helped capture Danilo Cavalcante after he escaped from prison and was on the run for nearly two weeks.
