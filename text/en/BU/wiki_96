<text>The year 1964 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

==Astronomy and space exploration==
* January 30 – The Soviet Union launches the first Elektron satellites.
* Spring – First recognition of cosmic microwave background radiation as a detectable phenomenon. The discovery and confirmation of the Cosmic microwave background in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe.
* March 20 – The precursor of the European Space Agency, ESRO (European Space Research Organization) is established (under an agreement of June 14, 1962).
* July 31 – Ranger program: Ranger 7 sends back the first close-up photographs of the Moon; images are 1,000 times clearer than anything ever seen from Earth-bound telescopes.
* October 12 – The Soviet Union launches the Voskhod 1 into Earth orbit as the first spacecraft with a multi-person crew and the first flight without space suits (the crew wouldn&#x27;t fit in the space capsule otherwise).

==Biology==
* British molecular biologist Robin Holliday proposes existence of the Holliday junction in nucleic acid.

==Computer science==
* April 7 – IBM announces the System/360, in six models with 32-bit architecture.
* May 1 – John George Kemeny and Thomas Eugene Kurtz run the first program created in BASIC (Beginners&#x27; All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), an easy to learn high level programming language that will eventually be included on many computers and even some games consoles.
* PL/I (Programming Language I), a block-structured computer language, is created by George Radin, while at IBM.
* Programma 101 is announced at the World&#x27;s Fair. Invented by the Italian engineer Pier Giorgio Perotto, It is one of the first commercial desktop programmable calculators.

==Earth sciences==
* March 27 (Good Friday) – Great Alaskan earthquake, the second most powerful known, with a magnitude of 9.2.
* Swiss geologist Augusto Gansser publishes &quot;Geology of the Himalayas&quot;.

==History of science and technology==
* January 23 – The Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Museum of History and Technology opens to the public in Washington, D.C.

==Mathematics==
* Paul Cohen proves the independence of the continuum hypothesis.
* Jacques Tits publishes significant work on group theory.

==Paleontology==
* August – John Ostrom identifies remains of the dinosaur &quot;Deinonychus&quot; in Montana, significant in being a small, agile species closely related to the birds.

==Physics==
* Three papers are published by Robert Brout and François Englert, Peter Higgs, and Gerald Guralnik, Dick Hagen, and Tom Kibble, predicting the Higgs boson and Higgs mechanism (or Englert–Brout–Higgs–Guralnik–Hagen–Kibble mechanism) which provides the means by which gauge bosons can acquire non-zero masses in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking. As part of &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;″ 50th anniversary celebration, the journal will recognize each of these contributions as milestone papers in its history.
* Existence of the charm quark is speculated by James Bjorken and Sheldon Glashow.
* John Stewart Bell publishes a paper on the EPR paradox originating Bell&#x27;s theorem.

==Physiology and medicine==
* January 11 – U.S. Surgeon General Luther Terry reports that smoking may be hazardous to health in the first such statement from the Federal government of the United States.
* January 16 – First angioplasty carried out, on the superficial femoral artery by U.S. interventional radiologist Charles Dotter.
* January 23 – First heart transplantation on a human, using a chimpanzee heart, carried out by U.S. surgeon James D. Hardy on Boyd Rush, but the organ is rejected after a few hours.
* March 28 – The Epstein-Barr virus is first described, by Anthony Epstein, Bert Achong and Yvonne Barr in London.
* June 27 – Iain Macintyre&#x27;s group reports it has isolated and sequenced the newly discovered hormone calcitonin and demonstrates its origin in the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland.
* Jerome Horwitz synthesizes zidovudine (AZT), an antiviral drug that will come to be used in treating HIV.
* Temazepam first synthesized.
* Lesch–Nyhan syndrome is first described, by Drs Michael Lesch and William Nyhan.
* Fernando Alves Martins of Portugal applies optical fiber technology to a gastrocamera to produce the first such device with a flexible fiberscope, for use in esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

==Psychology==
* Publication of Eric Berne&#x27;s book &quot;Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships&quot; in the United States.

==Technology==
* October – Dr. Robert Moog demonstrates his prototype synthesizers.
* Farrington Daniels&#x27; book &quot;Direct Use of the Sun&#x27;s Energy&quot; is published.

==Publications==
* &quot;Science Citation Index&quot; begins publication.

<text>In mathematics, an expression is a written arrangement of symbols following the context-dependent, syntactic conventions of mathematical notation. Symbols can denote numbers, variables, operations, and functions. Other symbols include punctuation marks and brackets, used for grouping where there is not a well-defined order of operations.

Expressions are commonly distinguished from &quot;formulas&quot;: expressions are a kind of mathematical object, whereas formulas are statements &quot;about&quot; mathematical objects. This is analogous to natural language, where a noun phrase refers to an object, and a whole sentence refers to a fact. For example, formula_1 is an expression, while the inequality formula_2 is a formula.

To &quot;evaluate&quot; an expression means to find a numerical value equivalent to the expression. Expressions can be &quot;evaluated&quot; or &quot;simplified&quot; by replacing operations that appear in them with their result. For example, the expression formula_3 simplifies to formula_4, and evaluates to formula_5

An expression is often used to define a function, by taking the variables to be arguments, or inputs, of the function, and assigning the output to be the evaluation of the resulting expression. For example, formula_6 and formula_7 define the function that associates to each number its square plus one. An expression with no variables would define a constant function. Usually, two expressions are considered equal or &quot;equivalent&quot; if they define the same function. Such an equality is called a &quot;semantic equality&quot;, that is, both expressions &quot;mean the same thing.&quot;

== History ==
=== Early written mathematics ===
The earliest written mathematics likely began with tally marks, where each mark represented one unit, carved into wood or stone. An example of early counting is the Ishango bone, found near the Nile and dating back over 20,000 years ago, which is thought to show a six-month lunar calendar. Ancient Egypt developed a symbolic system using hieroglyphics, assigning symbols for powers of ten and using addition and subtraction symbols resembling legs in motion. This system, recorded in texts like the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (c. 2000–1800 BC), influenced other Mediterranean cultures. In Mesopotamia, a similar system evolved, with numbers written in a base-60 (sexagesimal) format on clay tablets written in Cuneiform, a technique originating with the Sumerians around 3000 BC. This base-60 system persists today in measuring time and angles.

=== Syncopated stage ===
The &quot;syncopated&quot; stage of mathematics introduced symbolic abbreviations for commonly used operations and quantities, marking a shift from purely geometric reasoning. Ancient Greek mathematics, largely geometric in nature, drew on Egyptian numerical systems (especially Attic numerals), with little interest in algebraic symbols, until the arrival of Diophantus of Alexandria, who pioneered a form of syncopated algebra in his &quot;Arithmetica,&quot; which introduced symbolic manipulation of expressions. His notation represented unknowns and powers symbolically, but without modern symbols for relations (such as equality or inequality) or exponents. An unknown number was called formula_8. The square of formula_8 was formula_10; the cube was formula_11; the fourth power was formula_12; the fifth power was formula_13; and formula_14 meant to subtract everything on the right from the left. So for example, what would be written in modern notation as:
formula_15
Would be written in Diophantus&#x27;s syncopated notation as:
: formula_16
In the 7th century, Brahmagupta used different colours to represent the unknowns in algebraic equations in the &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;. Greek and other ancient mathematical advances, were often trapped in cycles of bursts of creativity, followed by long periods of stagnation, but this began to change as knowledge spread in the early modern period.

=== Symbolic stage and early arithmetic ===

The transition to fully symbolic algebra began with Ibn al-Banna&#x27; al-Marrakushi (1256–1321) and Abū al-Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī al-Qalaṣādī, (1412–1482) who introduced symbols for operations using Arabic characters. The plus sign (+) appeared around 1351 with Nicole Oresme, likely derived from the Latin &quot;et&quot; (meaning &quot;and&quot;), while the minus sign (−) was first used in 1489 by Johannes Widmann. Luca Pacioli included these symbols in his works, though much was based on earlier contributions by Piero della Francesca. The radical symbol (√) for square root was introduced by Christoph Rudolff in the 1500s, and parentheses for precedence by Niccolò Tartaglia in 1556. François Viète’s &quot;New Algebra&quot; (1591) formalized modern symbolic manipulation. The multiplication sign (×) was first used by William Oughtred and the division sign (÷) by Johann Rahn.

René Descartes further advanced algebraic symbolism in &quot;La Géométrie&quot; (1637), where he introduced the use of letters at the end of the alphabet (x, y, z) for variables, along with the Cartesian coordinate system, which bridged algebra and geometry. Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently developed calculus in the late 17th century, with Leibniz&#x27;s notation becoming the standard.

==Variables and evaluation==
 In elementary algebra, a &quot;variable&quot; in an expression is a letter that represents a number whose value may change. To &quot;evaluate an expression&quot; with a variable means to find the value of the expression when the variable is assigned a given number. Expressions can be &quot;evaluated&quot; or &quot;simplified&quot; by replacing operations that appear in them with their result, or by combining like-terms.

For example, take the expression formula_17; it can be evaluated at in the following steps:

formula_18, (replace x with 3)

formula_19 (use definition of exponent)

formula_20 (simplify)

formula_21

formula_22

A &quot;term&quot; is a constant or the product of a constant and one or more variables. Some examples include formula_23 The constant of the product is called the coefficient. Terms that are either constants or have the same variables raised to the same powers are called &quot;like terms&quot;. If there are like terms in an expression, one can simplify the expression by combining the like terms. One adds the coefficients and keeps the same variable.

formula_24

Any variable can be classified as being either a free variable or a bound variable. For a given combination of values for the free variables, an expression may be evaluated, although for some combinations of values of the free variables, the value of the expression may be undefined. Thus an expression represents an operation over constants and free variables and whose output is the resulting value of the expression.

For a non-formalized language, that is, in most mathematical texts outside of mathematical logic, for an individual expression it is not always possible to identify which variables are free and bound. For example, in formula_25, depending on the context, the variable formula_26 can be free and formula_27 bound, or vice-versa, but they cannot both be free. Determining which value is assumed to be free depends on context and semantics.

=== Equivalence ===
An expression is often used to define a function, or denote compositions of functions, by taking the variables to be arguments, or inputs, of the function, and assigning the output to be the evaluation of the resulting expression. For example, formula_6 and formula_7 define the function that associates to each number its square plus one. An expression with no variables would define a constant function. In this way, two expressions are said to be equivalent if, for each combination of values for the free variables, they have the same output, i.e., they represent the same function. The equivalence between two expressions is called an identity and is sometimes denoted with formula_30

For example, in the expression formula_31 the variable is bound, and the variable is free. This expression is equivalent to the simpler expression ; that is formula_32 The value for is 36, which can be denoted formula_33

=== Polynomial evaluation ===

A polynomial consists of variables and coefficients, that involve only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and exponentiation to nonnegative integer powers, and has a finite number of terms. The problem of polynomial evaluation arises frequently in practice. In computational geometry, polynomials are used to compute function approximations using Taylor polynomials. In cryptography and hash tables, polynomials are used to compute &quot;k&quot;-independent hashing.

In the former case, polynomials are evaluated using floating-point arithmetic, which is not exact. Thus different schemes for the evaluation will, in general, give slightly different answers. In the latter case, the polynomials are usually evaluated in a finite field, in which case the answers are always exact.

For evaluating the univariate polynomial formula_34 the most naive method would use formula_35 multiplications to compute formula_36, use formula_37 multiplications to compute formula_38 and so on for a total of formula_39 multiplications and formula_35 additions. Using better methods, such as Horner&#x27;s rule, this can be reduced to formula_35 multiplications and formula_35 additions. If some preprocessing is allowed, even more savings are possible.

=== Computation ===
A computation is any type of arithmetic or non-arithmetic calculation that is &quot;well-defined&quot;. The notion that mathematical statements should be &#x27;well-defined&#x27; had been argued by mathematicians since at least the 1600s, but agreement on a suitable definition proved elusive. A candidate definition was proposed independently by several mathematicians in the 1930s. The best-known variant was formalised by the mathematician Alan Turing, who defined a well-defined statement or calculation as any statement that could be expressed in terms of the initialisation parameters of a Turing machine. Turing&#x27;s definition apportioned &quot;well-definedness&quot; to a very large class of mathematical statements, including all well-formed algebraic statements, and all statements written in modern computer programming languages.

Despite the widespread uptake of this definition, there are some mathematical concepts that have no well-defined characterisation under this definition. This includes the halting problem and the busy beaver game. It remains an open question as to whether there exists a more powerful definition of &#x27;well-defined&#x27; that is able to capture both computable and &#x27;non-computable&#x27; statements. All statements characterised in modern programming languages are well-defined, including C++, Python, and Java.

Common examples of computation are basic arithmetic and the execution of computer algorithms. A calculation is a deliberate mathematical process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more outputs or &quot;results&quot;. For example, multiplying 7 by 6 is a simple algorithmic calculation. Extracting the square root or the cube root of a number using mathematical models is a more complex algorithmic calculation.

==== Rewriting ====
Expressions can be computed by means of an &quot;evaluation strategy.&quot; To illustrate, executing a function call codice_1 may first evaluate the arguments codice_2 and codice_3, store the results in references or memory locations codice_4 and codice_5, then evaluate the function&#x27;s body with those references passed in. This gives the function the ability to look up the original argument values passed in through dereferencing the parameters (some languages use specific operators to perform this), to modify them via assignment as if they were local variables, and to return values via the references. This is the call-by-reference evaluation strategy. Evaluation strategy is part of the semantics of the programming language definition. Some languages, such as PureScript, have variants with different evaluation strategies. Some declarative languages, such as Datalog, support multiple evaluation strategies. Some languages define a calling convention.

In rewriting, a reduction strategy or rewriting strategy is a relation specifying a rewrite for each object or term, compatible with a given reduction relation. A rewriting strategy specifies, out of all the reducible subterms (redexes), which one should be reduced (&quot;contracted&quot;) within a term. One of the most common systems involves lambda calculus.

==Well-defined expressions==
The language of mathematics exhibits a kind of grammar (called formal grammar) about how expressions may be written. There are two considerations for well-definedness of mathematical expressions, syntax and semantics. Syntax is concerned with the rules used for constructing, or transforming the symbols of an expression without regard to any interpretation or meaning given to them. Expressions that are syntactically correct are called well-formed. Semantics is concerned with the meaning of these well-formed expressions. Expressions that are semantically correct are called well-defined.

=== Well-formed ===
The syntax of mathematical expressions can be described somewhat informally as follows: the allowed operators must have the correct number of inputs in the correct places (usually written with infix notation), the sub-expressions that make up these inputs must be well-formed themselves, have a clear order of operations, etc. Strings of symbols that conform to the rules of syntax are called &quot;well-formed&quot;, and those that are not well-formed are called, &quot;ill-formed&quot;, and are do not constitute mathematical expressions.

For example, in arithmetic, the expression &quot;1 + 2 × 3&quot; is well-formed, but 
:formula_43.
is not.

However, being well-formed is not enough to be considered well-defined. For example in arithmetic, the expression formula_44 is well-formed, but it is not well-defined. (See Division by zero). Such expressions are called undefined.

===Well-defined===
Semantics is the study of meaning. Formal semantics is about attaching meaning to expressions. An expression that defines a unique value or meaning is said to be well-defined. Otherwise, the expression is said to be ill defined or ambiguous. In general the meaning of expressions is not limited to designating values; for instance, an expression might designate a condition, or an equation that is to be solved, or it can be viewed as an object in its own right that can be manipulated according to certain rules. Certain expressions that designate a value simultaneously express a condition that is assumed to hold, for instance those involving the operator formula_45 to designate an internal direct sum.

In algebra, an expression may be used to designate a value, which might depend on values assigned to variables occurring in the expression. The determination of this value depends on the semantics attached to the symbols of the expression. The choice of semantics depends on the context of the expression. The same syntactic expression &quot;1 + 2 × 3&quot; can have different values (mathematically 7, but also 9), depending on the order of operations implied by the context (See also Operations § Calculators).

For real numbers, the product formula_46 is unambiguous because formula_47; hence the notation is said to be &quot;well defined&quot;. This property, also known as associativity of multiplication, guarantees the result does not depend on the sequence of multiplications; therefore, a specification of the sequence can be omitted. The subtraction operation is non-associative; despite that, there is a convention that formula_48 is shorthand for formula_49, thus it is considered &quot;well-defined&quot;. On the other hand, Division is non-associative, and in the case of formula_50, parenthesization conventions are not well established; therefore, this expression is often considered ill-defined.

Unlike with functions, notational ambiguities can be overcome by means of additional definitions (e.g., rules of precedence, associativity of the operator). For example, in the programming language C, the operator codice_6 for subtraction is &quot;left-to-right-associative&quot;, which means that codice_7 is defined as codice_8, and the operator codice_9 for assignment is &quot;right-to-left-associative&quot;, which means that codice_10 is defined as codice_11. In the programming language APL there is only one rule: from right to left – but parentheses first.

== Formal definition ==
The term &#x27;expression&#x27; is part of the language of mathematics, that is to say, it is not defined &quot;within&quot; mathematics, but taken as a primitive part of the language. To attempt to define the term would not be doing mathematics, but rather, one would be engaging in a kind of metamathematics (the metalanguage of mathematics), usually mathematical logic. Within mathematical logic, mathematics is usually described as a kind of formal language, and a well-formed expression can be defined recursively as follows:

The alphabet consists of:

* A set of individual constants: Symbols representing fixed objects in the domain of discourse, such as numerals (1, 2.5, 1/7, ...), sets (formula_51, ...), truth values (T or F), etc.
* A set of individual variables: A countably infinite amount of symbols representing variables used for representing an unspecified object in the domain. (Usually letters like , or )
* A set of operations: Function symbols representing operations that can be performed on elements over the domain, like addition (+), multiplication (×), or set operations like union (∪), or intersection (∩). (Functions can be understood as unary operations)
* Brackets ( )

With this alphabet, the recursive rules for forming a well-formed expression (WFE) are as follows:

* Any constant or variable as defined are the atomic expressions, the simplest well-formed expressions (WFE&#x27;s). For instance, the constant formula_52 or the variable formula_53 are syntactically correct expressions.
* Let formula_54 be a metavariable for any n-ary operation over the domain, and let formula_55 be metavariables for any WFE&#x27;s.
:Then formula_56 is also well-formed. For the most often used operations, more convenient notations (like infix notation) have been developed over the centuries.
:For instance, if the domain of discourse is the real numbers, formula_54 can denote the binary operation +, then formula_58 is well-formed. Or formula_54 can be the unary operation formula_60 so formula_61 is well-formed.
:Brackets are initially around each non-atomic expression, but they can be deleted in cases where there is a defined order of operations, or where order doesn&#x27;t matter (i.e. where operations are associative).

A well-formed expression can be thought as a syntax tree. The leaf nodes are always atomic expressions. Operations formula_62 and formula_63 have exactly two child nodes, while operations formula_64, formula_65 and formula_66 have exactly one. There are countably infinitely many WFE&#x27;s, however, each WFE has a finite number of nodes.

===Lambda calculus===
Formal languages allow formalizing the concept of well-formed expressions.

In the 1930s, a new type of expression, the lambda expression, was introduced by Alonzo Church and Stephen Kleene for formalizing functions and their evaluation. The lambda operators (lambda abstraction and function application) form the basis for lambda calculus, a formal system used in mathematical logic and programming language theory.

The equivalence of two lambda expressions is undecidable (but see unification (computer science)). This is also the case for the expressions representing real numbers, which are built from the integers by using the arithmetical operations, the logarithm and the exponential (Richardson&#x27;s theorem).

==Types of expressions==
===Algebraic expression===
An &quot;algebraic expression&quot; is an expression built up from algebraic constants, variables, and the algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation by a rational number). For example, is an algebraic expression. Since taking the square root is the same as raising to the power , the following is also an algebraic expression:
:formula_67
See also: Algebraic equation and Algebraic closure

===Polynomial expression===

A polynomial expression is an expression built with scalars (numbers of elements of some field), indeterminates, and the operators of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation to nonnegative integer powers; for example formula_68

Using associativity, commutativity and distributivity, every polynomial expression is equivalent to a polynomial, that is an expression that is a linear combination of products of integer powers of the indeterminates. For example the above polynomial expression is equivalent (denote the same polynomial as formula_69

Many author do not distinguish polynomials and polynomial expressions. In this case the expression of a polynomial expression as a linear combination is called the &quot;canonical form&quot;, &quot;normal form&quot;, or &quot;expanded form&quot; of the polynomial.

===Computational expression===

In computer science, an &quot;expression&quot; is a syntactic entity in a programming language that may be evaluated to determine its value or fail to terminate, in which case the expression is undefined. It is a combination of one or more constants, variables, functions, and operators that the programming language interprets (according to its particular rules of precedence and of association) and computes to produce (&quot;to return&quot;, in a stateful environment) another value. This process, for mathematical expressions, is called &quot;evaluation&quot;.
In simple settings, the resulting value is usually one of various primitive types, such as string, Boolean, or numerical (such as integer, floating-point, or complex).

In computer algebra, formulas are viewed as expressions that can be evaluated as a Boolean, depending on the values that are given to the variables occurring in the expressions. For example formula_70 takes the value &quot;false&quot; if is given a value less than 1, and the value &quot;true&quot; otherwise.

Expressions are often contrasted with statements—syntactic entities that have no value (an instruction).
Except for numbers and variables, every mathematical expression may be viewed as the symbol of an operator followed by a sequence of operands. In computer algebra software, the expressions are usually represented in this way. This representation is very flexible, and many things that seem not to be mathematical expressions at first glance, may be represented and manipulated as such. For example, an equation is an expression with &quot;=&quot; as an operator, a matrix may be represented as an expression with &quot;matrix&quot; as an operator and its rows as operands.

See: Computer algebra expression

===Logical expression===
In mathematical logic, a &quot;logical expression&quot; can refer to either terms or formulas. A term denotes a mathematical object while a formula denotes a mathematical fact. In particular, terms appear as components of a formula.

A first-order term is recursively constructed from constant symbols, variables, and function symbols.
An expression formed by applying a predicate symbol to an appropriate number of terms is called an atomic formula, which evaluates to true or false in bivalent logics, given an interpretation.
For example, is a term built from the constant 1, the variable , and the binary function symbols and ; it is part of the atomic formula which evaluates to true for each real-numbered value of .

===Formal expression===

A formal expression is a kind of string of symbols, created by the same production rules as standard expressions, however, they are used without regard to the meaning of the expression. In this way, two &quot;formal expressions&quot; are considered equal only if they are syntactically equal, that is, if they are the exact same expression. For instance, the formal expressions &quot;2&quot; and &quot;1+1&quot; are not equal.

<text>Christopher Trotman &quot;Trot&quot; Nixon (born April 11, 1974), nicknamed &quot;Dirt Dog&quot; is an American former professional baseball right fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1996 through 2008, primarily with the Boston Red Sox from 1996 through 2006, where he was a fan favorite for his scrappy play. With the Red Sox, he won the 2004 World Series. His career wound down with limited appearances for the Cleveland Indians in 2007 and the New York Mets in 2008. He currently serves as co-host/analyst for &quot;The 5th Quarter,&quot; a high school football highlight show on WWAY-TV in his hometown of Wilmington, North Carolina.

==Youth and high school career==
Nixon was born in Durham, North Carolina and attended New Hanover High School in Wilmington, North Carolina. As a senior, he was named the State Player of the Year in both football and baseball. In football, as a senior, he broke school passing records held by former National Football League quarterbacks Sonny Jurgensen and Roman Gabriel. In baseball, as a senior, he was named the &quot;Baseball America&quot; High School Player of the Year and the State Player of the Year, and helped lead his team to the State 4A title, and finished his senior season with a .512 batting average, 12 home runs and a state-record 56 RBI, and pitched 40 innings with a 12–0 record and a 0.40 ERA. Nixon was slated to play both football and baseball at North Carolina State on a scholarship, and when negotiations with the Boston Red Sox continued to the fall, he participated in fall practice at NC State. He eventually signed with the Boston Red Sox at the signing deadline, the day classes began.

==Professional career==

===Boston Red Sox===
Nixon was drafted by the Red Sox in the 1st round of the 1993 Major League Baseball Draft, and was the seventh pick overall. He split the 1994-1998 seasons between several A, AA, and AAA minor league teams, with two brief stints with the Red Sox on the major league level in 1996 and 1998.

Nixon&#x27;s first full season in the majors was in 1999, when he played in 124 games and hit .270 with 15 home runs and 52 RBIs. He came in 9th place in Rookie of the Year voting with just a single vote point (Carlos Beltrán of the Kansas City Royals won the award by a landslide).

Nixon quickly became a fan favorite for his scrappy, enthusiastic gameplay. He was considered the inspiration for the expression &quot;Boston Dirt Dogs.&quot; The signature is that of a &quot;scrapper,&quot; a player who hustles and usually gets his uniform dirty during games.

After a decent 2000 season, Nixon produced career highs (at the time) during the 2001 season with a .280 batting average, 27 home runs, and 88 RBIs.

The 2002 season was also a good one for Nixon: he posted career bests in doubles (36) and RBIs (94). On May 5, 2002, in response to several hits by pitches, Nixon threw his bat in the direction of Tampa Bay Devil Rays pitcher Ryan Rupe, pretending that the bat slipped out of his hands while swinging. In response, Bob Watson, the Major League Baseball vice president in charge of discipline, fined him $2,000 and suspended him four games.

Nixon had the best year of his career in 2003, batting .306 with 28 home runs and 87 RBIs. On October 4, 2003, in Game 3 of the American League Division Series, he had the most prominent moment of his career. Nixon was called from the bench as a pinch hitter in the bottom of the 11th. With the Red Sox facing elimination, Nixon lined a two-run homer over the center field wall for a 3–1 Boston victory. The Red Sox went on to win the next two games, stunning the Oakland Athletics with a 3-2 series win and advancing to the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees. The Red Sox lost the ALCS in seven games despite Nixon batting .333 (8 for 24) with 3 home runs and 5 RBIs in the series.

During the 2004 season, Nixon was unavailable for several months due to a herniated disc and a tight thigh muscle. Upon his return, he generally worked as the starting right fielder during the regular and post-season. In the deciding game of the 2004 World Series, Nixon hit a two-out, two-run double off the right field wall at Busch Stadium in St. Louis in the top of the third inning to give Boston a 3–0 lead. Those were the last runs either team scored in that game as the Red Sox swept the Cardinals for the team&#x27;s first World Series title in 86 years. For the series, Nixon batted .357 (5 for 14) with 3 doubles and 3 RBIs.

Nixon also endeared himself to Sox fans by briefly wearing a mohawk hairstyle, one of many unconventional and bizarre hairstyles the Sox sported over the course of the 2004 season.

Loved by Boston&#x27;s fans, Nixon is known for an extremely volatile temper and steadfast dedication to his teammates. In August 2005, while officially on the disabled list, Nixon remained in uniform and in the dugout with the rest of the team during the game. When teammate Gabe Kapler (who often acted as Nixon&#x27;s right field replacement) hit a long fly ball off of the Green Monster, the umpires ruled it a double. Nixon leapt off the bench and argued with such passion that Kapler&#x27;s hit had been a home run (television replays confirmed that the hit had landed above the home run line, and thus should have been ruled a two-run homer) that he was ejected from the game.

On October 1, 2006, with two outs in the fifth inning of the final game of the season, manager Terry Francona replaced Nixon in right field with rookie David Murphy. Knowing Nixon might be playing his final game with the Sox, the fans gave him a grateful ovation as he ran off the field. Said Nixon, when asked if it was difficult playing what may have been his last game for the Red Sox:

After the 2006 season, the Red Sox did not offer Nixon salary arbitration as the team pursued and eventually signed free agent J. D. Drew and had a fourth outfielder, Wily Mo Peña, on the roster.

===Cleveland Indians===

In January 2007, Nixon signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Cleveland Indians. Instead of wearing number 7 as he had in Boston, Nixon chose number 33. The decision was made in part by his son Chase, based on the fact that Nixon turned 33 years old that April.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
In February 2008, he signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Arizona Diamondbacks and was subsequently sent to their Triple-A affiliate the Tucson Sidewinders.

===New York Mets===
On June 13, 2008, Nixon was acquired by the New York Mets from the Diamondbacks for cash considerations and a player to be named later. The Mets acquired him to replace injured outfielder Moisés Alou. He was added to the Mets roster on June 15, replacing outfielder Chris Aguila who was designated for assignment. The same day he was activated, Nixon started in right field against the Texas Rangers. However, he finished the season on the disabled list.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
On December 18, 2008, Nixon signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. He was put onto the inactive roster. After his release from the Brewers in March 2009, Nixon retired from baseball.

===Legacy===
In 1092 games over 12 seasons, Nixon posted a .274 batting average (995-for-3627) with 579 runs, 222 doubles, 28 triples, 137 home runs, 555 RBI, 30 stolen bases, 504 bases on balls, .364 on-base percentage and .464 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .983 fielding percentage primarily as a right fielder but also has played at center and left field. In 42 postseason games, he was productive, batting .283 (39-for-138) with 18 runs, 11 doubles, 6 home runs, 25 RBI and 14 walks.

Nixon was often described as a &quot;Dirt Dog&quot;, and nicknamed &quot;the Dirt Dog&quot; or the &quot;original dirt dog&quot;.

 He was known for wearing a hat covered in dirt, as well as a dirty batting helmet.

The area in Connecticut between Boston and New York City, has been referred to as the &quot;Munson–Nixon line&quot;, a play on the Mason–Dixon line, after Nixon and former Yankee Thurman Munson. Steve Rushin, who coined the term in a 2003 Sports Illustrated article, has pinpointed the line as running north of New Haven, south of Hartford, and along the width of central Connecticut.

In 2010, Red Sox manager Terry Francona compared rookie Red Sox outfielder Ryan Kalish&#x27;s intensity and aggressiveness to Nixon&#x27;s.

In October 2018, Nixon threw out the ceremonial first pitch of the American League Division Series to Dustin Pedroia, and collected donations outside of Fenway Park for Hurricane Florence victims.

In 2020, Nixon was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame. He was inducted in the Red Sox Hall of Fame in May 2024.

==Personal life==
Nixon became an evangelical Christian in 1993. Nixon said he relied on his faith as a calming influence on the field.

Nixon is married to his wife, Kathryn, with whom he has two sons, Chase (born September 11, 2001) and Luke (born October 1, 2004). He was flying back to Boston to be at Chase&#x27;s birth when air traffic was halted due to the September 11 attacks on the United States.

<doc id="609138" wikidata="Q750467" url="?curid=609138" title="Ramie">
<text>Ramie (pronounced: , ; from Malay ), Boehmeria nivea, is a flowering plant in the nettle family Urticaceae, native to eastern Asia. It is an herbaceous perennial growing to tall; the leaves are heart-shaped, long and broad, and white on the underside with dense, small hairs—this gives it a silvery appearance; unlike stinging nettles, the hairs do not sting. The true ramie or China grass is also called Chinese plant or white ramie.

A second type, known as green ramie or rhea, is believed to have originated in the Malay Peninsula. It has smaller leaves which are green on the underside, and it appears to be better suited to tropical conditions. The word &quot;ramie&quot; is derived from the Malay word .

==Cultivation==

Ramie is one of the oldest fiber crops, having been used for at least 6,000 years, and is principally used for fabric production. It is a bast fiber, which comes from the inner bark (phloem) of the vegetative stalks and not the woody stem itself or the outer bark. Ramie is normally harvested two to three times a year, but under good growing conditions can be harvested up to six times per year. Unlike other bast crops, ramie requires chemical processing to de-gum the fiber.

When the plant begins flowering, or just before, it signals both a decline in growth and the plant being at its maximum fibre content, and is harvested. Stems are harvested by cutting just above the lateral roots or by bending the stem. This enables the core to be broken and the cortex can be stripped from the plant &quot;in situ&quot;.

After harvesting, stems are decorticated while the plants are fresh. If this is not done while the plants are still fresh, the plants dry out and the bark will be difficult to remove. The bark ribbon is then dried as quickly as possible, preventing bacteria and fungi from attacking it.

The dry weight of harvested stem from crops ranges from 3.4 to 4.5 t/ha/year. A 4.5-ton crop yields 1,600 kg/ha/year of dry undegummed fiber. The weight loss during degumming can be up to 25%, giving a yield of degummed fiber of about 1,200 kg/ha/year.

The fiber extraction occurs in three stages. First, the cortex (bark) is removed; this can be done manually or by machine. This process is called decortication. Second, the cortex is scraped to remove most of the outer bark, the parenchyma in the bast layer and some of the gums and pectins. Third, the residual cortex material is washed, dried, and degummed to extract the spinnable fiber.

==History==
Ramie has been grown in China for many centuries, and farmers in ancient China are known to have used the fiber to weave clothing. In China, it is called zhù má (苎麻). It may have been used in cloth for wrapping mummies in Egypt. Though ramie and flax are difficult to distinguish from one another in ancient cloth, ramie&#x27;s resistance to bacteria and mildew would make it appropriate for mummy wrapping.

Taiwan&#x27;s aboriginal people have used ramie for millennia in fabric production and ramie is still used to create traditional garb.

Ramie was used to produce an open-weave fabric called mechera, used for shirts and dressing gowns suitable for warm climates. The French painter Raoul Dufy designed in the early 20th century patterns for prints on mechera used by the French shirtmaker Charvet.

Brazil began production in the late 1930s with production peaking in 1971. Since then, production has steadily declined as a result of competition from alternative crops, such as soybeans, and from synthetic fibers.

==Properties==
Ramie is one of the strongest natural fibers. It exhibits even greater strength when wet. Ramie fiber is known especially for its ability to hold shape, reduce wrinkling, and introduce a silky lustre to the fabric appearance. It is not as durable as other fibers, so is usually used as a blend with other fibers such as cotton or wool. It is similar to linen in absorbency, density, and microscopic appearance. It does not dye as well as cotton. Because of its high molecular crystallinity, ramie is stiff and brittle and will break if folded repeatedly in the same place; it lacks resiliency and is low in elasticity and elongation potential.

==Uses==

Despite its strength, ramie has had limited acceptance for textile use. The fiber&#x27;s extraction and cleaning are expensive, chiefly because of the several steps—involving scraping, pounding, heating, washing, or exposure to chemicals. Some or all are needed to separate the raw fiber from the adhesive gums or resins. Spinning the fiber is difficult due to its brittle quality and low elasticity; and weaving is complicated by the hairy surface of the yarn, resulting from lack of cohesion between the fibers. Greater utilization of ramie may depend upon development of improved processing methods and the need to find plastic alternatives.

Ramie is used to make such products as industrial sewing thread, packing materials, fishing nets, and filter cloths. It is also made into fabrics for household furnishings (upholstery, canvas) and clothing, frequently in blends with other textile fibers (for instance when used in a mixture with wool, shrinkage is reported to be greatly reduced when compared with pure wool). Shorter fibers and waste are used in paper manufacture. Ramie ribbon is used in fine bookbinding as a substitute for traditional linen tape.

For the 2010 Prius, Toyota began using plant-derived plastics made from the cellulose in wood or grass instead of petroleum. One of the two principal crops used is ramie.

Ramie is also used as an ornamental plant in eastern Asia.

In Vietnam, ramie leaves are a main ingredient in making a Vietnamese glutinous rice cake called bánh gai (thorn leaf cake) or bánh gai Tứ Trụ in Thanh Hóa province. The leaves give the cake its distinct color, flavor and fragrance.

In the Chinese Hakka community, ramie leaves are a main ingredient in making pancake-like dumplings with glutinous rice powder, sugar and water. These glutinous rice powder dumplings are similar to another Southeast Asian delicacy otherwise known as Kuih. The ramie leaves are picked, cleaned and ground in mortar, mixed into a dough of glutinous rice powder, water and sugar, kneaded thoroughly and placed on palm-sized square- or circular-cut banana leaves and steamed. The ramie leaves give the dumplings a dark green colour and unique aroma.

Ramie is also occasionally used in the construction of high performance rowing oar shafts. Mahe Drysdale used sculling oars made with ramie during the 2016 Rio Olympics where he won Gold in the Men&#x27;s 1X Scull.

==Producers==
China is the main producer of ramie. Others include Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and Brazil. Only a small percentage of the ramie produced is available on the international market. Japan, Germany, France and the UK are the main importers; the remaining supply is used domestically.

<doc id="609144" wikidata="Q1151364" url="?curid=609144" title="Formal wear">
<text>Formal wear or full dress is the Western dress code category applicable for the most formal occasions, such as weddings, christenings, confirmations, funerals, Easter and Christmas traditions, in addition to certain state dinners, audiences, balls, and horse racing events. Generally permitted other alternatives, though, are the most formal versions of ceremonial dresses (including court dresses, diplomatic uniforms and academic dresses), full dress uniforms, religious clothing, national costumes, and most rarely frock coats (which preceded morning coat as default formal day wear 1820s-1920s). In addition, formal wear is often instructed to be worn with official full size orders and medals.

The protocol indicating particularly men&#x27;s traditional formal wear has remained virtually unchanged since the early 20th century. Despite decline following the counterculture of the 1960s, it remains observed in formal settings influenced by Western culture: notably around Europe, the Americas, South Africa, Australia, as well as Japan. For women, although fundamental customs for formal ball gowns (and wedding gowns) likewise apply, changes in fashion have been more dynamic. Traditional formal headgear for men is the top hat, and for women picture hats etc. of a range of interpretations. Shoes for men are dress shoes, dress boots or pumps and for women heeled dress pumps. In western countries, a &quot;formal&quot; or white tie dress code typically means tailcoats for men and evening dresses for women. The most formal dress for women is a full-length ball or evening gown with evening gloves. Some white tie functions also request that the women wear long gloves past the elbow.

Formal wear being the most formal dress code, it is followed by semi-formal wear, equivalently based around daytime black lounge suit, and evening black tie (&quot;dinner suit/tuxedo&quot;), and evening gown for women. The male lounge suit and female cocktail dress in turn only comes after this level, traditionally associated with informal attire. Notably, if a level of flexibility is indicated (for example &quot;uniform, morning coat or lounge suit&quot;, such as seen to the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018), the hosts tend to wear the most formal interpretation of that dress code in order to save guests the inconvenience of out-dressing.

Since the most formal versions of national costumes are typically permitted as supplementary alternatives to the uniformity of Western formal dress codes, conversely, since most cultures have at least intuitively applied some equivalent level of formality, the versatile framework of Western formal dress codes open to amalgamation of international and local customs have influenced its competitiveness as international standard. From these social conventions derive in turn also the variants worn on related occasions of varying solemnity, such as formal political, diplomatic, and academic events, in addition to certain parties including award ceremonies, balls, fraternal orders, high school proms, etc.

==History==
Clothing norms and fashions fluctuated regionally in the Middle Ages.

More widespread conventions emerged around royal courts in Europe in the more interconnected Early Modern era. The justacorps with cravat, breeches and tricorne hat was established as the first suit (in an anarchaic sense) by the 1660s-1790s. It was sometimes distinguished by day and evening wear.

By the Age of Revolution in the Late Modern era, it was replaced by the previously-casual country leisure wear-associated front cutaway dress coat around the 1790s-1810s. At the same time, breeches were gradually replaced by pantaloons, as were tricorne hats by bicorne hats and ultimately by the top hat by the 19th century and thenceforth.

By the 1820s, the dress coat was replaced as formal day wear by the dark, closed-front knee-length frock coat. However, the dress coat from the transition period was maintained as formal evening wear in the form of white tie, remaining so until this day.

By the 1840s, the first cutaway morning coats of contemporary style emerged, which would eventually replace the frock coat as formal day wear by the 1920s.

Likewise, starting from the 1860s, fashion evolved to gradually introduce the more sportive, shorter suit jacket, likewise originating in country leisure wear. This evolved into the semi-formal evening wear black tie from the 1880s and the informal wear suit accepted by polite society from the 1920s.

==Dress codes==
The dress codes counted as formal wear are the formal dress codes of morning dress for daytime and white tie for evenings. Although some consider strollers for daytime and black tie for the evening as formal, they are traditionally considered semi-formal attires, sartorially speaking below in formality level.

The clothes dictated by these dress codes for women are ball gowns. For many uniforms, the official clothing is unisex. Examples of this are court dress, academic dress, and military full dress uniform.

===Morning dress===

Morning dress is the daytime formal dress code, consisting chiefly for men of a morning coat, waistcoat, and striped trousers, and an appropriate dress for women.

===White tie===
The required clothing for men, in the evening, is roughly the following: 
*Formal trousers, uncuffed, with stripes on leg seams
*White piqué front or plain stiff-fronted shirt with a detachable wing collar, cuff links and shirt studs
*White piqué bow tie
*White piqué vest (waistcoat)
*A (dress coat) evening tailcoat
*Black patent leather court shoes
*Accessories

Women wear a variety of dresses. See ball gowns, evening gowns, and wedding dresses. Business attire for women has a developmental history of its own and generally looks different from formal dress for social occasions.

==Supplementary alternatives==
Many invitations to white tie events, like the last published edition of the British &quot;Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Guide to Dress at Court&quot;, explicitly state that national costume or national dress may be substituted for white tie.

In general, each of the supplementary alternatives applies equally for both day attire, and evening attire.

===Ceremonial dress===
Including court dresses, diplomatic uniforms, and academic dresses.

===Full dress uniform===

Prior to World War II formal style of military dress, often referred to as full dress uniform, was generally restricted to the British, British Empire and United States armed forces; although the French, Imperial German, Swedish and other navies had adopted their own versions of mess dress during the late nineteenth century, influenced by the Royal Navy.

In the U.S. Army, evening mess uniform, in either blue or white, is considered the appropriate military uniform for white-tie occasions. The blue mess and white mess uniforms are black tie equivalents, although the Army Service Uniform with bow tie are accepted, especially for non-commissioned officers and newly commissioned officers. For white-tie occasions, of which there are almost none in the United States outside the national capital region for U.S. Army, an officer must wear a wing-collar shirt with white tie and white vest. For black tie occasions, officers must wear a turndown collar with black tie and black cummerbund. The only outer coat prescribed for both black- and white-tie events is the army blue cape with branch colour lining.

===Religious clothing===

Certain clergy wear, in place of white tie outfits, a cassock with ferraiolone, which is a light-weight ankle-length cape intended to be worn indoors. The colour and fabric of the ferraiolone is determined by the rank of the cleric and can be scarlet watered silk, purple silk, black silk or black wool. For outerwear, the black cape (cappa nigra), also known as a choir cape (cappa choralis), is most traditional. It is a long black woolen cloak fastened with a clasp at the neck and often has a hood. Cardinals and bishops may also wear a black plush hat or, less formally, a biretta. In practice, the cassock and especially the ferraiolone have become much less common and no particular formal attire has appeared to replace them. The most formal alternative is a clerical waistcoat incorporating a Roman collar (a rabat) worn with a collarless French cuff shirt and a black suit, although this is closer to black-tie than white tie.

Historically, clerics in the Church of England would wear a knee-length cassock called an apron, accompanied by a tailcoat with silk facings but no lapels, for a white tie occasion. In modern times this is rarely seen. However, if worn, the knee-length cassock is now replaced with normal dress trousers.
===Cultural dress===
In Western formal state ceremonies and social functions, diplomats, foreign dignitaries, and guests of honour wear a Western formal dress if not wearing their own national dress.

Many cultures have a formal day and evening dress, for example:
* — worn by both men and women in Vietnam, is a modern variation of from the Nguyễn Dynasty. Collars can be mandarin collar, round collar, wide collar, etc. Sleeves can be long-sleeved, short-sleeved or elbow-length.
* — both traditional and modern, embroidered blouse worn by women in Cambodia for special occasions and traditional festivals
* — also called Jodhpuri suit, worn by men in India, is a traditional dress
* Barong tagalog — worn by men in the Philippines
* — worn by men with and or and in formal and religious occasions, e.g. Eid, in some Eastern Arab countries like (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain and others)
* Batik shirt — worn by men and women in Indonesia. Besides counting as formal wear, batik shirts are worn well into the informal level.
* — worn as formal dress by women and men in Norway
* — a long male version of the , which originated during the Qing dynasty. It can be of cotton for ordinary wear, or of silk for those within aristocratic families. Beneath the , the man generally wears a white mandarin-collar long-sleeved shirt and a pair of dark-colored long pants. Like the , this male gown has slits on both sides (at least knee level) as well. Worn either by Chinese men in the martial arts world or as attire for weddings to match the the bride wears. The and originated as Manchu dresses which government officials, but not ordinary civilians, were required to wear under the Qing dynasty&#x27;s laws. Gradually, the general Han Chinese civilian population shifted from wearing traditional Chinese clothing to the and .
* — a modern female variation of the Qing dynasty silk dress, characterized by a high mandarin collar and side slits of varying lengths. It can be sleeveless, short-sleeved, elbow-length or long-sleeved, and has been adopted by most Chinese women as Chinese wear, depending on materials and occasions.
* — worn as formal dress by men in Nepal
* &quot;Dashiki&quot; — worn by men in West African countries
* — worn by men in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, the Maldives, and Tamil men in Sri Lanka
* — worn as formal dress by women and men in Sweden
* — worn by men in Iceland to formal events such as state dinners and weddings
* — worn by both men and women in Korea
* Highland dress with Scottish kilt — worn as formal dress by men in Scotland or of Scottish descent
* — worn by women in Malaysia and Indonesia
* Mao suit, worn as diplomatic uniform and evening dress by officials of the People&#x27;s Republic of China
* Sari — worn by women in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka
* — worn by both men and women in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh
* worn by men in India and Pakistan
===Frock coat===
Although ceased as a protocol-regulated required formal attire at the British royal court in 1936 at the order of the short-reigning King Edward VIII, the frock coat - embodying the background for all contemporary civil formal wear - has not altogether vanished. Yet, it is a rarity mostly confined to infrequent appearances at certain weddings.

The state funeral of Winston Churchill in 1965 included bearers of frock coats.

To this day, King Tupou VI of Tonga (born 1959) has been a frequent wearer of frock coats at formal occasions.

Also more recent fashion has been inspired by frock coats: Prada&#x27;s autumn editions of 2012, Alexander McQueen&#x27;s menswear in the autumn of 2017, and Paul Smith&#x27;s autumn 2018.

<doc id="609146" wikidata="Q5361176" url="?curid=609146" title="Elio Chacón">
<text>Elio Chacón Rodríguez (October 26, 1936 – April 24, 1992) was a Major League Baseball second baseman and shortstop who played in the National League from 1960 to 1962. He was the seventh baseball player from Venezuela to play in the majors.

==Early baseball career==
Born in Caracas, Chacón was listed as tall and . He threw and batted right-handed. Chacón hit .265 as a reserve second baseman with the NL champion Cincinnati Reds, starting 34 games during the season. In Game 2 of the 1961 World Series, Chacón hit a key bloop single against New York Yankees pitcher Ralph Terry, and scored the winning run in the Reds&#x27; only victory in the series.

Immediately after the World Series, on October 10, the 1961 MLB expansion draft to stock the newborn Houston Colt .45s and New York Mets was conducted in Cincinnati. After he was selected by New York with the fourth overall pick during the draft&#x27;s regular phase, Chacón was the Mets&#x27; first candidate for the starting shortstop job. In a May 28 game, Chacón got into a fight with Willie Mays. Chacón was ejected from the game.

==&#x27;¡La tengo!&#x27;==
During the 1962 season, New York Mets center fielder Richie Ashburn and Chacón frequently found themselves colliding in the outfield. When Ashburn went for a catch, he would scream, &quot;I got it! I got it!&quot; only to run into the 160-pound Chacón, who spoke only Spanish. Ashburn learned to yell, &quot;¡La tengo! ¡La tengo!&quot; which is &quot;I&#x27;ve got it&quot; in Spanish. In a later game, Ashburn happily saw Chacón backing off. He relaxed, positioned himself to catch the ball, and was instead run over by 200-pound left fielder Frank Thomas, who understood no Spanish and had missed a team meeting that proposed using the words &quot;¡La tengo!&quot; as a way to avoid outfield collisions. After getting up, Thomas asked Ashburn, &quot;What the hell is a Yellow Tango?&quot;. The band Yo La Tengo gets its name from this baseball anecdote.

Chacón led the Mets in stolen bases in their inaugural season of 1962, but then never appeared in the major leagues again. His professional career continued through 1971. In the majors, he was a .232 career hitter with 143 hits, four home runs, 28 RBI, 49 runs, and 20 stolen bases in 228 games played.

Elio Chacón died in Caracas at the age of 55.

<doc id="609147" wikidata="Q16259746" url="?curid=609147" title="Transmission (mechanical device)">
<text>A transmission (also called a gearbox) is a mechanical device which uses a gear set—two or more gears working together—to change the speed, direction of rotation, or torque multiplication/reduction in a machine. 

Transmissions can have a single fixed-gear ratio, multiple distinct gear ratios, or continuously variable ratios. Variable-ratio transmissions are used in all sorts of machinery, especially vehicles. 

== Applications ==
=== Early uses ===
Early transmissions included the right-angle drives and other gearing in windmills, horse-powered devices, and steam-powered devices. Applications of these devices included pumps, mills and hoists.

===Bicycles===
Bicycles traditionally have used hub gear or Derailleur gear transmissions, but there are other more recent design innovations.

=== Automobiles ===

Since the torque and power output of an internal combustion engine varies with its rpm, automobiles powered by ICEs require multiple gear ratios to keep the engine within its power band to produce optimal power, fuel efficiency, and smooth operation. Multiple gear ratios are also needed to provide sufficient acceleration and velocity for safe and reliable operation at modern highway speeds. ICEs typically operate over a range of approximately 600–7000 rpm, while the vehicle&#x27;s speeds requires the wheels to rotate in the range of 0–1800 rpm.

In the early mass-produced automobiles, the standard transmission design was manual: the combination of gears was selected by the driver through a lever (the gear stick) that displaced gears and gear groups along their axes. Starting in 1939, cars using various types of automatic transmission became available in the US market. These vehicles used the engine&#x27;s own power to change the effective gear ratio depending on the load so as to keep the engine running close to its optimal rotation speed. Automatic transmissions now are used in more than two thirds of cars globally, and on almost all new cars in the US.

Most currently-produced passenger cars with gasoline or diesel engines use transmissions with 4–10 forward gear ratios (also called speeds) and one reverse gear ratio. Electric vehicles typically use a fixed-gear or two-speed transmission with no reverse gear ratio.


=== Motorcycles ===
== Fixed-ratio ==
The simplest transmissions used a fixed ratio to provide either a gear reduction or increase in speed, sometimes in conjunction with a change in the orientation of the output shaft. Examples of such transmissions are used in helicopters and wind turbines. In the case of a wind turbine, the first stage of the gearbox is usually a planetary gear, to minimize the size while withstanding the high torque inputs from the turbine.
== Multi-ratio ==
Many transmissions – especially for transportation applications – have multiple gears that are used to change the ratio of input speed (e.g. engine rpm) to the output speed (e.g. the speed of a car) as required for a given situation. Gear (ratio) selection can be manual, semi-automatic, or automatic.

===Manual===
A manual transmission requires the driver to manually select the gears by operating a gear stick and clutch (which is usually a foot pedal for cars or a hand lever for motorcycles).

Most transmissions in modern cars use synchromesh to synchronise the speeds of the input and output shafts. However, prior to the 1950s, most cars used non-synchronous transmissions.

==== Sequential manual ====
A sequential manual transmission is a type of non-synchronous transmission used mostly for motorcycles and racing cars. It produces faster shift times than synchronized manual transmissions, through the use of dog clutches rather than synchromesh. Sequential manual transmissions also restrict the driver to selecting either the next or previous gear, in a successive order.
===Semi-automatic===
A semi-automatic transmission is where some of the operation is automated (often the actuation of the clutch), but the driver&#x27;s input is required to move off from a standstill or to change gears.

====Automated manual / clutchless manual ====

An automated manual transmission (AMT) is essentially a conventional manual transmission that uses automatic actuation to operate the clutch and/or shift between gears.

Many early versions of these transmissions were semi-automatic in operation, such as &quot;Autostick&quot;, which automatically control only the clutch, but still require the driver&#x27;s input to initiate gear changes. Some of these systems are also referred to as &quot;clutchless manual&quot; systems. Modern versions of these systems that are fully automatic in operation, such as &quot;Selespeed&quot; and &quot;Easytronic&quot;, can control both the clutch operation and the gear shifts automatically, without any input from the driver.

===Automatic===
An automatic transmission does not require any input from the driver to change forward gears under normal driving conditions.

==== Hydraulic automatic ====

The most common design of automatic transmissions is the hydraulic automatic, which typically uses planetary gearsets that are operated using hydraulics. The transmission is connected to the engine via a torque converter (or a fluid coupling prior to the 1960s), instead of the friction clutch used by most manual transmissions and dual-clutch transmissions.
==== Dual-clutch (DCT) ====
A dual-clutch transmission (DCT) uses two separate clutches for odd and even gear sets. The design is often similar to two separate manual transmissions with their respective clutches contained within one housing, and working as one unit. In car and truck applications, the DCT functions as an automatic transmission, requiring no driver input to change gears.

==Continuously-variable Ratio==

A continuously variable transmission (CVT) can change seamlessly through a continuous range of gear ratios. This contrasts with other transmissions that provide a limited number of gear ratios in fixed steps. The flexibility of a CVT with suitable control may allow the engine to operate at a constant RPM while the vehicle moves at varying speeds.

CVTs are used in cars, tractors, side-by-sides, motor scooters, snowmobiles, bicycles, and earthmoving equipment.

The most common type of CVT uses two pulleys connected by a belt or chain; however, several other designs have also been used at times.

==Noise and vibration==

Gearboxes are often a major source of noise and vibration in vehicles and stationary machinery. Higher sound levels are generally emitted when the vehicle is engaged in lower gears. The design life of the lower ratio gears is shorter, so cheaper gears may be used, which tend to generate more noise due to smaller overlap ratio and a lower mesh stiffness etc. than the helical gears used for the high ratios. This fact has been used to analyze vehicle-generated sound since the late 1960s, and has been incorporated into the simulation of urban roadway noise and corresponding design of urban noise barriers along roadways.

<text>Bristol Beach State Park is a undeveloped state park located on the Hudson River in the town of Saugerties in Ulster County, New York. The park was initially formed in 1967, and is managed by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.

==History==
The core of Bristol Beach State Park occupies land formerly used as a brickyard during the 19th century. It was acquired by the town of Saugerties by deed; the town eventually transferred ownership to New York State. In 1967, the then- property was transferred from the New York State Conservation Department to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. The park was expanded in the 1990s to protect adjacent parcels that were being considered for development.

In 2013, the town of Saugerties proposed re-acquiring the park to promote its development, which they felt was being under-utilized by the state.

==Description==
Bristol Beach State Park covers adjacent to the Hudson River and is largely undeveloped, with the exception of a small parking lot. Although there are no formal trails, a landing on the river is a popular spot for launching kayaks and fishing. The northern portion of the park, known as Eve&#x27;s Point, does include some basic amenities such as a gazebo and portable toilets.

Despite its name, the park does not include a developed beach and swimming is not permitted. Steep banks, undesirable substrate, and shallow off-shore water depths were noted as barriers preventing future development of a beach at the property.

<text>In telecommunications, transmission (sometimes abbreviated as &quot;TX&quot;) is the process of sending or propagating an analog or digital signal via a medium that is wired, wireless, or fiber-optic.

Transmission system technologies typically refer to physical layer protocol duties such as modulation, demodulation, line coding, equalization, error control, bit synchronization and multiplexing, but it may also involve higher-layer protocol duties, for example, digitizing an analog signal, and data compression.

Transmission of a digital message, or of a digitized analog signal, is known as data transmission.

Examples of transmission are the sending of signals with limited duration, for example, a block or packet of data, a phone call, or an email.

<text>Donald Gunn (September 1797 – 30 November 1878) was a Scottish-Canadian businessman, judge, astronomer and politician. He was a member of the Manitoba Provincial Legislative Council (which he helped to abolish).

Gunn was born in Halkirk, Caithness, Scotland, in 1797. His father was William Gunn in Braehour who was brother to Donald Gunn the sennachie in Braehour of Brawlbin who married Catherine Gunn in Osclay. She was the great granddaughter of Donald Crotach Gunn who was Chief of the Clan Gunn. Donald (Manitoba) Gunn married Margaret Swain (who was born in Rupert&#x27;s Land) in 1819; they had many children. Donald had a brother called William Gunn of Waranga, Victoria, Australia.

Donald worked in the Canadian North West for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company between 1813 and 1823, and was subsequently a Judge on the Court of Petty Sessions in Red River. He also wrote for the Smithsonian Institution and the Institute of Rupert&#x27;s Land, and was a member of the Board of Management for Manitoba College (a Presbyterian institution).

Gunn was one of the earliest contributors to the Smithsonian Institution in the field of astronomy.

Gunn was a supporter of Canadian Confederation and the Government of Adams George Archibald. In Manitoba&#x27;s first general election (27 December 1870), he ran against Provincial Secretary and fellow Archibald-supporter Alfred Boyd. He was defeated by 58 votes to 28.

Gunn was appointed to the Province&#x27;s new Legislative Council on 15 March 1871, one of seven members. In 1876, he supported the decision of the Robert A. Davis government to abolish the institution.

Donald Gunn died in 1878 in St. Andrew&#x27;s, Manitoba.

<text>Battle Island State Park is a state park located on the Oswego River in Oswego County, New York. Included within the park is the 18-hole Battle Island State Park Golf Course. The park is located on the west bank of the river, north of the City of Fulton, along New York State Route 48.

==History==
Battle Island State Park&#x27;s name refers to a battle that took place on a nearby island on July 3, 1756, during the French and Indian War. The battle commenced after a British fleet, returning from delivering supplies to Fort Ontario, was ambushed by a party of French and Indians. Although outnumbered, British and Colonial forces were able repulse several attacks by using the island as a stronghold. The island identified on maps as &quot;Battle Island&quot; was created during the excavation of an adjacent canal; the battle actually took place on a smaller island just to the south.

Battle Island State Park occupies land originally owned by Frederick A. Emerick, who deeded of the park&#x27;s property to the state in 1916. When the remainder of his property was turned over to the state in 1938, the land was officially designated as a state park.

==Facilities==
One of the park&#x27;s main attractions is its 18-hole, par 72 golf course, designed by Devereux Emmett. The course length is from its longest tees.

The park also offers trails for cross-country skiing and a food concession.

<doc id="609188" wikidata="Q6410688" url="?curid=609188" title="Kinemage">
<text>A kinemage (short for kinetic image) is an interactive graphic scientific illustration. It often is used to visualize molecules, especially proteins although it can also represent other types of 3-dimensional data (such as geometric figures, social networks, or tetrahedra of RNA base composition). The kinemage system is designed to optimize ease of use, interactive performance, and the perception and communication of detailed 3D information. The kinemage information is stored in a text file, human- and machine-readable, that describes the hierarchy of display objects and their properties, and includes optional explanatory text. The kinemage format is a defined chemical MIME type of &#x27;chemical/x-kinemage&#x27; with the file extension &#x27;.kin&#x27;.

==Early history==
Kinemages were first developed by David Richardson at Duke University School of Medicine, for the Protein Society&#x27;s journal Protein Science that premiered in January 1992. For its first 5 years (1992–1996), each issue of Protein Science included a supplement on floppy disk of interactive, kinemage 3D computer graphics to illustrate many of the articles, plus the Mage software (cross-platform, free, open-source) to display them; kinemage supplementary material is still available on the journal web site. Mage and RasMol were the first widely used macromolecular graphics programs to support interactive display on personal computers. Kinemages are used for teaching, and for textbook supplements, individual exploration, and analysis of macromolecular structures.
==Research uses==
More recently, with the availability of a much wider variety of other molecular graphics tools, presentation use of kinemages has been overtaken by a wide variety of research uses, concomitant with new display features and with the development of software that produces kinemage-format output from other types of molecular calculations. All-atom contact analysis adds and optimizes explicit hydrogen atoms, and then uses patches of dot surface to display the hydrogen bond, van der Waals, and steric &quot;clash&quot; interactions between atoms. The results can be used visually (in kinemages) and quantitatively to analyze the detailed interactions between molecular surfaces, most extensively for the purpose of validating and improving the molecular models from experimental x-ray crystallography data. Both Mage and KiNG (see below) have been enhanced for kinemage display of data in higher than 3 dimensions (moving between views in various 3-D projections, coloring and selecting candidate clusters of datapoints, and switching to a parallel coordinates representation), used for instance for defining clusters of favorable RNA backbone conformations in the 7-dimensional space of backbone dihedral angles between one ribose and the next.

==Online web use==
KiNG is an open-source kinemage viewer, written in the programming language Java by Ian Davis and Vincent Chen, that can work interactively either standalone on a user machine with no network connection, or as a web service in a web page. The interactive nature of kinemages is their primary purpose and attribute. To appreciate their nature, the demonstration KiNG in browser has two examples that can be moved around in 3D, plus instructions for how to embed a kinemage on a web page. The figure below shows KiNG being used to remodel a lysine sidechain in a high-resolution crystal structure. KiNG is one of the viewers provided on each structure page at the Protein Data Bank site, and displays validation results in 3D on the MolProbity site. Kinemages can also be shown in immersive virtual reality systems, with the open-source KinImmerse software. All of the kinemage display and all-atom contact software is available free and open-source on the kinemage web site.

<doc id="609192" wikidata="Q326356" url="?curid=609192" title="Leo Burnett">
<text>Leo Burnett (October 21, 1891 – June 7, 1971) was an American advertising executive and the founder of Leo Burnett Company, Inc. He was responsible for creating some of advertising&#x27;s most well-known characters and campaigns of the 20th century, including Tony the Tiger, the Marlboro Man, the Maytag Repairman, United&#x27;s &quot;Fly the Friendly Skies&quot;, and Allstate&#x27;s &quot;Good Hands&quot;, and for garnering relationships with multinational clients such as McDonald&#x27;s, Hallmark and Coca-Cola. In 1999, Burnett was named by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.

==Biography==
Leo Burnett was born in St. Johns, Michigan, on October 21, 1891, to Noble and Rose Clark Burnett. Noble ran a dry goods store and as a young man, Burnett worked with his father, watching Noble as he designed ads for the business. After high school, Burnett went on to study journalism at the University of Michigan and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1914.

Burnett&#x27;s first job after college was as a reporter for the Peoria &quot;Journal Star&quot; in Peoria, Illinois. In 1917 he moved to Detroit and was hired to edit an in-house publication for Cadillac Motor Car Company, Cadillac Clearing House, later becoming an advertising director for that institution. At Cadillac, Burnett met his advertising mentor, Theodore F. MacManus, whom Burnett called &quot;one of the great advertising men of all time&quot;. MacManus ran the agency that handled Cadillac&#x27;s advertising.

In 1918, Burnett married Naomi Geddes. The couple met at a restaurant near the Cadillac offices, where Naomi was a cashier. They went on to have three children: Peter, Joseph and Phoebe.

During World War I, Burnett joined the Navy for six months. His service was mostly at Great Lakes building a breakwater. After the USN, Burnett returned to Cadillac. A few employees at Cadillac formed the LaFayette Motors Company – triggering Burnett to move to Indianapolis to work for the new firm. Soon he was offered a position with Homer McKee. He then left LaFayette and joined McKee, where Burnett said of the founder, &quot;(He) gave me my first feel of what I have come to regard as the &quot;warm sell&quot; as contrasted to the &quot;hard sell&quot; and &quot;soft sell&quot;. This was his first agency job.

After spending a decade at McKee&#x27;s, and working through the stock market crash of 1929, Burnett left the company. In 1930, he moved to Chicago and was hired by Erwin, Wasey &amp; Company, where he was employed for five years.

In 1935, Burnett founded the Leo Burnett Company, Inc. Later, the operation moved to the 18th floor of the London Guarantee Building. Today, the agency has 9,000+ employees in over 85 offices globally.

In December 1967, nearing the end of his career, Burnett delivered his &quot;When To Take My Name Off The Door&quot; speech at the agency&#x27;s holiday gathering.

On June 7, 1971, Burnett went to his agency, pledging to colleagues to work three days per week due to health problems. That evening, at age 79, he died of a heart attack at his family farm in Hawthorn Woods, Illinois. He is buried at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago.

==Leo Burnett Company==
A private company formed in 1935 and officially running under the name of &quot;Leo Burnett Company, Inc.&quot;, the agency started with working capital of $50,000, eight employees and three clients. Now a part of Publicis Groupe, Leo Burnett is one of the largest agency networks with 85 offices in 69 countries and 9,000+ employees.

For the first several years, Burnett billed about $1 million annually. By 1950, billings had increased to $22 million, and by 1954 the company was at $55 million annually. By the end of the 1950s, the Leo Burnett Company was billing $100 million annually.

==Advertising techniques==
Burnett used dramatic realism in his advertising, the soft sell approach to build brand equity. Burnett believed in finding the &quot;inherent drama&quot; of products and presenting it in advertising through warmth, shared emotions and experiences. His advertising drew from heartland-rooted values using simple, strong and instinctive imagery that talked to people. He was also known for using &quot;cultural archetypes&quot; in his copy, by creating mythical creatures that represented American values. This is evident on such campaigns as Jolly Green Giant, Pillsbury Doughboy, Tony the Tiger and more famously the Marlboro Man. Indeed, these campaigns played on the 1950s attitudes towards masculinity that pervaded his campaigns.

===Corny language===
Burnett was known for keeping a folder in the lower left-hand corner of his desk called &quot;Corny Language&quot;. He collected words, phrases, and analogies that struck him as being particularly apt in expressing an idea.

==Social advertising==
In 1947, Burnett wrote &quot;The Good Citizen&quot;, a booklet concerning the duties and privileges of being a U.S. citizen. This was done as a public service for The Advertising Council and The American Heritage Foundation.

<text>A personality test is a method of assessing human personality constructs. Most personality assessment instruments (despite being loosely referred to as &quot;personality tests&quot;) are in fact introspective (i.e., subjective) self-report questionnaire (Q-data, in terms of LOTS data) measures or reports from life records (L-data) such as rating scales. Attempts to construct actual performance tests of personality have been very limited even though Raymond Cattell with his colleague Frank Warburton compiled a list of over 2000 separate objective tests that could be used in constructing objective personality tests. One exception, however, was the Objective-Analytic Test Battery, a performance test designed to quantitatively measure 10 factor-analytically discerned personality trait dimensions. A major problem with both L-data and Q-data methods is that because of item transparency, rating scales, and self-report questionnaires are highly susceptible to motivational and response distortion ranging from lack of adequate self-insight (or biased perceptions of others) to downright dissimulation (faking good/faking bad) depending on the reason/motivation for the assessment being undertaken.

The first personality assessment measures were developed in the 1920s and were intended to ease the process of personnel selection, particularly in the armed forces. Since these early efforts, a wide variety of personality scales and questionnaires have been developed, including the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF), the Comrey Personality Scales (CPS), among many others. Although popular especially among personnel consultants, the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) has numerous psychometric deficiencies. More recently, a number of instruments based on the Five Factor Model of personality have been constructed such as the Revised NEO Personality Inventory. However, the Big Five and related Five Factor Model have been challenged for accounting for less than two-thirds of the known trait variance in the normal personality sphere alone.

Estimates of how much the personality assessment industry in the US is worth range anywhere from $2 and $4 billion a year (as of 2013). Personality assessment is used in wide a range of contexts, including individual and relationship counseling, clinical psychology, forensic psychology, school psychology, career counseling, employment testing, occupational health and safety and customer relationship management.

==History==

The origins of personality assessment date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when personality was assessed through phrenology, the measurement of bumps on the human skull, and physiognomy, which assessed personality based on a person&#x27;s outer appearances. Sir Francis Galton took another approach to assessing personality late in the 19th century. Based on the lexical hypothesis, Galton estimated the number of adjectives that described personality in the English dictionary. Galton&#x27;s list was eventually refined by Louis Leon Thurstone to 60 words that were commonly used for describing personality at the time. Through factor analyzing responses from 1300 participants, Thurstone was able to reduce this severely restricted pool of 60 adjectives into seven common factors. This procedure of factor analyzing common adjectives was later utilized by Raymond Cattell (7th most highly cited psychologist of the 20th Century—based on the peer-reviewed journal literature), who subsequently utilized a data set of over 4000 affect terms from the English dictionary that eventually resulted in construction of the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) which also measured up to eight second-stratum personality factors. Of the many introspective (i.e., subjective) self-report instruments constructed to measure the putative Big Five personality dimensions, perhaps the most popular has been the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) However, the psychometric properties of the NEO-PI-R (including its factor analytic/construct validity) has been severely criticized.

Another early personality instrument was the Woodworth Personal Data Sheet, a self-report inventory developed for World War I and used for the psychiatric screening of new draftees.

==Overview==
There are many different types of personality assessment measures. The self-report inventory involves administration of many items requiring respondents to introspectively assess their own personality characteristics. This is highly subjective, and because of item transparency, such Q-data measures are highly susceptible to motivational and response distortion. Respondents are required to indicate their level of agreement with each item using a Likert scale or, more accurately, a Likert-type scale. An item on a personality questionnaire, for example, might ask respondents to rate the degree to which they agree with the statement &quot;I talk to a lot of different people at parties&quot; on a scale from 1 (&quot;strongly disagree&quot;) to 5 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;).

Historically, the most widely used multidimensional personality instrument is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), a psychopathology instrument originally designed to assess archaic psychiatric nosology.

In addition to subjective/introspective self-report inventories, there are several other methods for assessing human personality, including observational measures, ratings of others, projective tests (e.g., the TAT and Ink Blots), and actual objective performance tests (T-data).

== Topics ==

===Norms===
The meaning of &quot;personality test&quot; scores are difficult to interpret in a direct sense. For this reason substantial effort is made by producers of personality tests to produce norms to provide a comparative basis for interpreting a respondent&#x27;s test scores. Common formats for these norms include percentile ranks, z scores, sten scores, and other forms of standardized scores.

===Test development===
A substantial amount of research and thinking has gone into the topic of personality test development. Development of personality tests tends to be an iterative process whereby a test is progressively refined. Test development can proceed on theoretical or statistical grounds. There are three commonly used general strategies: Inductive, Deductive, and Empirical. Scales created today will often incorporate elements of all three methods.

Deductive assessment construction begins by selecting a domain or construct to measure. The construct is thoroughly defined by experts and items are created which fully represent all the attributes of the construct definition. Test items are then selected or eliminated based upon which will result in the strongest internal validity for the scale. Measures created through deductive methodology are equally valid and take significantly less time to construct compared to inductive and empirical measures. The clearly defined and face valid questions that result from this process make them easy for the person taking the assessment to understand. Although subtle items can be created through the deductive process, these measure often are not as capable of detecting lying as other methods of personality assessment construction.

Inductive assessment construction begins with the creation of a multitude of diverse items. The items created for an inductive measure to not intended to represent any theory or construct in particular. Once the items have been created they are administered to a large group of participants. This allows researchers to analyze natural relationships among the questions and label components of the scale based upon how the questions group together. Several statistical techniques can be used to determine the constructs assessed by the measure. Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis are two of the most common data reduction techniques that allow researchers to create scales from responses on the initial items.

The Five Factor Model of personality was developed using this method. Advanced statistical methods include the opportunity to discover previously unidentified or unexpected relationships between items or constructs. It also may allow for the development of subtle items that prevent test takers from knowing what is being measured and may represent the actual structure of a construct better than a pre-developed theory. Criticisms include a vulnerability to finding item relationships that do not apply to a broader population, difficulty identifying what may be measured in each component because of confusing item relationships, or constructs that were not fully addressed by the originally created questions.

Empirically derived personality assessments require statistical techniques. One of the central goals of empirical personality assessment is to create a test that validly discriminates between two distinct dimensions of personality. Empirical tests can take a great deal of time to construct. In order to ensure that the test is measuring what it is purported to measure, psychologists first collect data through self- or observer reports, ideally from a large number of participants.
=== Self- vs. observer-reports ===
A personality test can be administered directly to the person being evaluated or to an observer. In a self-report, the individual responds to personality items as they pertain to the person himself/herself. Self-reports are commonly used. In an observer-report, a person responds to the personality items as those items pertain to someone else. To produce the most accurate results, the observer needs to know the individual being evaluated. Combining the scores of a self-report and an observer report can reduce error, providing a more accurate depiction of the person being evaluated. Self- and observer-reports tend to yield similar results, supporting their validity.

===Direct observation reports===
Direct observation involves a second party directly observing and evaluating someone else. The second party observes how the target of the observation behaves in certain situations (e.g., how a child behaves in a schoolyard during recess). The observations can take place in a natural (e.g., a schoolyard) or artificial setting (social psychology laboratory). Direct observation can help identify job applicants (e.g., work samples) who are likely to be successful or maternal attachment in young children (e.g., Mary Ainsworth&#x27;s strange situation). The object of the method is to directly observe &quot;genuine&quot; behaviors in the target. A limitation of direct observation is that the target persons may change their behavior because they know that they are being observed. A second limitation is that some behavioral traits are more difficult to observe (e.g., sincerity) than others (e.g., sociability). A third limitation is that direct observation is more expensive and time-consuming than a number of other methods (e.g., self-report).

=== Personality tests in the workplace ===
Though personality tests date back to the early 20th century, it was not until 1988 when it became illegal in the United States for employers to use polygraphs that they began to more broadly utilize personality tests. The idea behind these personality tests is that employers can reduce their turnover rates and prevent economic losses in the form of people prone to thievery, drug abuse, emotional disorders or violence in the workplace. There is a chance that an applicant may fake responses to personality test items in order to make the applicant appear more attractive to the employing organization than the individual actually is.

Personality tests are often part of management consulting services, as having a certification to conduct a particular test is a way for a consultant to offer an additional service and demonstrate their qualifications. The tests are used in narrowing down potential job applicants, as well as which employees are more suitable for promotion. The United States federal government is a notable customer of personality test services outside the private sector with approximately 200 federal agencies, including the military, using personality assessment services.

Despite evidence showing personality tests as one of the least reliable metrics in assessing job applicants, they remain popular as a way to screen candidates.

===Test evaluation===
There are several criteria for evaluating a &quot;personality test&quot;. For a test to be successful, users need to be sure that (a) test results are replicable and (b) the test measures what its creators purport it to measure. Fundamentally, a &quot;personality test&quot; is expected to demonstrate reliability and validity. Reliability refers to the extent to which test scores, if a test were administered to a sample twice within a short period of time, would be similar in both administrations. Test validity refers to evidence that a test measures the construct (e.g., neuroticism) that it is supposed to measure.

===Analysis===
A respondent&#x27;s response is used to compute the analysis. Analysis of data is a long process. Two major theories are used here: classical test theory (CTT), used for the observed score; and item response theory (IRT), &quot;a family of models for persons&#x27; responses to items&quot;. The two theories focus upon different &#x27;levels&#x27; of responses and researchers are implored to use both in order to fully appreciate their results.

===Non-response===
Firstly, item non-response needs to be addressed. Non-response can either be &quot;unit&quot;, where a person gave no response for any of the &quot;n&quot; items, or &quot;item&quot;, i.e., individual question. Unit non-response is generally dealt with exclusion. Item non-response should be handled by imputation – the method used can vary between test and questionnaire items.

===Scoring===
The conventional method of scoring items is to assign &#x27;0&#x27; for an incorrect answer and &#x27;1&#x27; for a correct answer. When tests have more response options (e.g. multiple choice items) &#x27;0&#x27; when incorrect, &#x27;1&#x27; for being partly correct and &#x27;2&#x27; for being correct. Personality tests can also be scored using a dimensional (normative) or a typological (ipsative) approach. Dimensional approaches such as the Big 5 describe personality as a set of continuous dimensions on which individuals differ. From the item scores, an &#x27;observed&#x27; score is computed. This is generally found by summing the un-weighted item scores.

==Criticism and controversy==

===Personality versus social factors===

In the 1960s and 1970s some psychologists dismissed the whole idea of personality, considering much behaviour to be context-specific. This idea was supported by the fact that personality often does not predict behaviour in specific contexts. However, more extensive research has shown that when behaviour is aggregated across contexts, that personality can be a mostly good predictor of behaviour. Almost all psychologists now acknowledge that both social and individual difference factors (i.e., personality) influence behaviour. The debate is currently more around the relative importance of each of these factors and how these factors interact.

===Respondent faking===

One problem with self-report measures of personality is that respondents are often able to distort their responses. Intentional faking is when responses are distorted in order to gain a benefit. There are two main types of faking: faking-good presenting a better self image and faking-bad presenting a worse self image.

Several meta-analyses show that people are able to substantially change their scores on personality tests when such tests are taken under high-stakes conditions, such as part of a job selection procedure.

Work in experimental settings has also shown that when student samples have been asked to deliberately fake on a personality test, they clearly demonstrated that they are capable of doing so.
In 2007 over 5000 job applicants who completed the same personality test twice after a six month gap, found that their results showed no significant differences, potentially indicating that people may not significantly distort their responses.

Several strategies have been adopted for reducing and detecting respondent faking. Researchers are looking at the timing of responses on electronically administered tests to assess faking. Brief simple syntax tends to show longer response times in faked responses than in comparison to truthful responses; longer, more complex, and negative phrasing does not show differences in timing. One strategy involves providing a warning on the test that methods exist for detecting faking and that detection will result in negative consequences for the respondent (e.g., not being considered for the job). Forced choice (ipsative testing) has three formats: PICK (selecting a best fitting statement), MOLE (selecting a most and least fitting statement), and RANK (a most to least alike ranking), the effectiveness of using forced choice to prevent faking is inconclusive. 

More recently, Item Response Theory approaches have been adopted with some success in identifying item response profiles that flag fakers. While people can fake in practice they seldom do so to any significant level. To successfully fake means knowing what the ideal answer would be. Even with something as simple as assertiveness people who are unassertive and try to appear assertive often endorse the wrong items. This is because unassertive people confuse assertion with aggression, anger, oppositional behavior, etc.

===Psychological research===
Research on the importance of personality and intelligence in education shows evidence that when others provide the personality rating, rather than providing a self-rating, the outcome is nearly four times more accurate for predicting grades.

===Additional applications===
The MBTI questionnaire is a popular tool for people to use as part of self-examination or to find a shorthand to describe how they relate to others in society. It is well known from its widespread adoption in hiring practices, but popular among individuals for its focus exclusively on positive traits and &quot;types&quot; with memorable names. Some users of the questionnaire self-identify by their personality type on social media and dating profiles. Due to the publisher&#x27;s strict copyright enforcement, many assessments come from free websites which provide modified tests based on the framework.

Unscientific personality type quizzes are also a common form of entertainment. In particular Buzzfeed became well known for publishing user-created quizzes, with personality-style tests often based on deciding which pop culture character or celebrity the user most resembles.

Personality test have also been used as a from of aptitude test in workplace or school environments. A test covering 15 personality types, including the &quot;Big-5&quot; personality traits, was used in a study to see if there is correlation between pilots personality scores and success in the aviation field. The results showed correlation between high scores in conscientiousness and self-confidence but low levels of neuroticism had higher passing scores on aviation tests. However, personality test are not a true science and cannot accurately predict the &quot;ideal pilot.&quot;

Personality tests are also being adapted to be used on livestock. They are looking to see if the animals are bold, fearful or fearless, and how they interact with other livestock. These test are designed to predict a wide variety of things and how well they will do on the farm. For example, with chickens the test can predict whether they will vocalize their fear. These test can help farmers improve the well-being and productivity of their animals. 

===Dangers===
There is an issue of privacy to be of concern forcing applicants to reveal private thoughts and feelings through his or her responses that seem to become a condition for employment. Another danger is the illegal discrimination of certain groups under the guise of a personality test.

In addition to the risks of personality test results being used outside of an appropriate context, they can give inaccurate results when conducted incorrectly. In particular, ipsative personality tests are often misused in recruitment and selection, where they are mistakenly treated as if they were normative measures.

== Effects of technological advancements on the field ==
New technological advancements are increasing the possible ways that data can be collected and analyzed, and broadening the types of data that can be used to reliably assess personality. Although qualitative assessments of job-applicants&#x27; social media have existed for nearly as long as social media itself, many scientific studies have successfully quantized patterns in social media usage into various metrics to assess personality quantitatively. Smart devices, such as smart phones and smart watches, are also now being used to collect data in new ways and in unprecedented quantities. Also, brain scan technology has dramatically improved, which is now being developed to analyze personalities of individuals extremely accurately.

Aside from the advancing data collection methods, data processing methods are also improving rapidly. Strides in big data and pattern recognition in enormous databases (data mining) have allowed for better data analysis than ever before. Also, this allows for the analysis of large amounts of data that was difficult or impossible to reliably interpret before (for example, from the internet). There are other areas of current work too, such as gamification of personality tests to make the tests more interesting and to lower effects of psychological phenomena that skews personality assessment data. 

This data collection has also brought about machine created personality tests based on a person&#x27;s digital footprint. So far, the test have proven to be fairly accurate, but this kind of tech is very new. This paper focuses specifically on how data mining plays a role in personality. 

With new data collection methods comes new ethical concerns, such as over the analysis of one&#x27;s public data to make assessments on their personality and when consent is needed.

== Examples of personality tests ==
* The first modern personality test was the Woodworth Personal Data Sheet, which was first used in 1919. It was designed to help the United States Army screen out recruits who might be susceptible to shell shock.
* The Rorschach inkblot test was introduced in 1921 as a way to determine personality by the interpretation of inkblots.
* The Thematic Apperception Test was commissioned by the Office of Strategic Services (O.S.S.) in the 1930s to identify personalities that might be susceptible to being turned by enemy intelligence.
* The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory was published in 1942 as a way to aid in assessing psychopathology in a clinical setting. It can also be used to assess the Personality Psychopathology Five (PSY-5), which are similar to the Five Factor Model (FFM; or Big Five personality traits). These five scales on the MMPI-2 include aggressiveness, psychoticism, , negative emotionality/neuroticism, and introversion/low positive emotionality.
* Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. This 16-type indicator test is based on Carl Jung&#x27;s &quot;Psychological Types&quot;, developed during World War II by Isabel Myers and Katharine Briggs. The 16-type indicator includes a combination of Extroversion-Introversion, Sensing-Intuition, Thinking-Feeling and Judging-Perceiving. The MBTI utilizes two opposing behavioral divisions on four scales that yields a &quot;personality type&quot;.
* OAD Survey is an adjective word list designated to measure seven work related personality traits and job behaviors: Assertiveness-Compliance, Extroversion-Introversion, Patience-Impatience, Detail-Broad, High Versatility-Low Versatility, Low Emotional IQ-High Emotional IQ, Low Creativity-High Creativity. It was first published in 1990 with periodic norm revisions to assure scale validity, reliability, and non-bias. 
* Keirsey Temperament Sorter developed by David Keirsey is influenced by Isabel Myers sixteen types and Ernst Kretschmer&#x27;s four types.
* The True Colors Test developed by Don Lowry in 1978 is based on the work of David Keirsey in his book, &quot;Please Understand Me&quot;, as well as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and provides a model for understanding personality types using the colors blue, gold, orange and green to represent four basic personality temperaments.
* The 16PF Questionnaire (16PF) was developed by Raymond Cattell and his colleagues in the 1940s and 1950s in a search to try to discover the basic traits of human personality using scientific methodology. The test was first published in 1949, and is now in its 5th edition, published in 1994. It is used in a wide variety of settings for individual and marital counseling, career counseling and employee development, in educational settings, and for basic research.
* The EQSQ Test developed by Simon Baron-Cohen, Sally Wheelwright centers on the empathizing-systemizing theory of the male versus the female brain types.
* The Personality and Preference Inventory (PAPI), originally designed by Dr Max Kostick, Professor of Industrial Psychology at Boston State College, in Massachusetts, USA, in the early 1960s evaluates the behaviour and preferred work styles of individuals.
* The Strength Deployment Inventory, developed by Elias Porter in 1971 and is based on his theory of Relationship Awareness. Porter was the first known psychometrician to use colors (Red, Green and Blue) as shortcuts to communicate the results of a personality test.
* The Newcastle Personality Assessor (NPA), created by Daniel Nettle, is a short questionnaire designed to quantify personality on five dimensions: Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientious, Agreeableness, and Openness.
* The DISC assessment is based on the research of William Moulton Marston and later work by John Grier, and identifies four personality types: Dominance; Influence; Steadiness and Conscientiousness. It is used widely in Fortune 500 companies, for-profit and non-profit organizations.
* The Winslow Personality Profile measures 24 traits on a decile scale. It has been used in the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League and every draft choice for Major League Baseball for the last 30 years and can be taken online for personal development.
* Other personality tests include Forté Profile, Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Swedish Universities Scales of Personality, Edwin E. Wagner&#x27;s The Hand Test, and Enneagram of Personality.
* The HEXACO Personality Inventory – Revised (HEXACO PI-R) is based on the HEXACO model of personality structure, which consists of six domains, the five domains of the Big Five model, as well as the domain of Honesty-Humility.
* The Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) was developed in September 2012 by the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Workgroup with regard to a personality trait model proposed for DSM-5. The PID-5 includes 25 maladaptive personality traits as determined by Krueger, Derringer, Markon, Watson, and Skodol.
* The Process Communication Model (PCM), developed by Taibi Kahler with NASA funding, was used to assist with shuttle astronaut selection. Now it is a non-clinical personality assessment, communication and management methodology that is now applied to corporate management, interpersonal communications, education, and real-time analysis of call centre interactions among other uses.
* The Birkman Method (TBM) was developed by Roger W. Birkman in the late 1940s. The instrument consists of ten scales describing &quot;occupational preferences&quot; (Interests), 11 scales describing &quot;effective behaviors&quot; (Usual behavior) and 11 scales describing interpersonal and environmental expectations (Needs). A corresponding set of 11 scale values was derived to describe &quot;less than effective behaviors&quot; (Stress behavior). TBM was created empirically. The psychological model is most closely associated with the work of Kurt Lewin. Occupational profiling consists of 22 job families with over 200 associated job titles connected to O*Net.
* The International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) is a public domain set of more than 2000 personality items which can be used to measure many personality variables, including the Five Factor Model.
*The Guilford-Zimmerman Temperament Survey examined 10 factors that represented normal personality, and was used in both longitudinal studies and to examine the personality profiles of Italian pilots.
*The Short Dark Triad (SD-3) examines three socially unacceptable traits: narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.
*The Dark Triad Dirty Dozen (DTDD) is a 12-item version of a dark triad test.

=== Personality tests of the five factor model ===
Different types of the Big Five personality traits:

* The NEO PI-R, or the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, is one of the most significant measures of the Five Factor Model (FFM). The measure was created by Costa and McCrae and contains 240 items in the forms of sentences. Costa and McCrae had divided each of the five domains into six facets each, 30 facets total, and changed the way the FFM is measured.
* The Five-Factor Model Rating Form (FFMRF) was developed by Lynam and Widiger in 2001 as a shorter alternative to the NEO PI-R. The form consists of 30 facets, 6 facets for each of the Big Five factors.
* The Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) and the Five Item Personality Inventory (FIPI) are very abbreviated rating forms of the Big Five personality traits.
* The Five Factor Personality Inventory – Children (FFPI-C) was developed to measure personality traits in children based upon the Five Factor Model (FFM).
* The Big Five Inventory (BFI), developed by John, Donahue, and Kentle, is a 44-item self-report questionnaire consisting of adjectives that assess the domains of the Five Factor Model (FFM). The 10-Item Big Five Inventory is a simplified version of the well-established BFI. It is developed to provide a personality inventory under time constraints. The BFI-10 assesses the five dimensions of BFI using only two items each to cut down on length of BFI.
* The Semi-structured Interview for the Assessment of the Five-Factor Model (SIFFM) is the only semi-structured interview intended to measure a personality model or personality disorder. The interview assesses the five domains and 30 facets as presented by the NEO PI-R, and it additional assesses both normal and abnormal extremities of each facet.

<doc id="609197" wikidata="Q6143358" url="?curid=609197" title="Studentized residual">
<text>In statistics, a studentized residual is the dimensionless ratio resulting from the division of a residual by an estimate of its standard deviation, both expressed in the same units. It is a form of a Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-statistic, with the estimate of error varying between points.

This is an important technique in the detection of outliers. It is among several named in honor of William Sealey Gosset, who wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Student&quot; (e.g., Student&#x27;s distribution). Dividing a statistic by a sample standard deviation is called studentizing, in analogy with &quot;standardizing&quot; and &quot;normalizing&quot;.

==Motivation==
The key reason for studentizing is that, in regression analysis of a multivariate distribution, the variances of the &quot;residuals&quot; at different input variable values may differ, even if the variances of the &quot;errors&quot; at these different input variable values are equal. The issue is the difference between errors and residuals in statistics, particularly the behavior of residuals in regressions.

Consider the simple linear regression model

:formula_1

Given a random sample (&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot;), &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;n&quot;, each pair (&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot;) satisfies

:formula_2

where the &quot;errors&quot; formula_3, are independent and all have the same variance formula_4. The residuals are not the true errors, but &quot;estimates&quot;, based on the observable data. When the method of least squares is used to estimate formula_5 and formula_6, then the residuals formula_7, unlike the errors formula_8, cannot be independent since they satisfy the two constraints

:formula_9

and

:formula_10

(Here &quot;ε&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the &quot;i&quot;th error, and formula_11 is the &quot;i&quot;th residual.)

The residuals, unlike the errors, &quot;do not all have the same variance:&quot; the variance decreases as the corresponding &quot;x&quot;-value gets farther from the average &quot;x&quot;-value. This is not a feature of the data itself, but of the regression better fitting values at the ends of the domain. It is also reflected in the influence functions of various data points on the regression coefficients: endpoints have more influence. This can also be seen because the residuals at endpoints depend greatly on the slope of a fitted line, while the residuals at the middle are relatively insensitive to the slope. The fact that &quot;the variances of the residuals differ,&quot; even though &quot;the variances of the true errors are all equal&quot; to each other, is the &quot;principal reason&quot; for the need for studentization.

It is not simply a matter of the population parameters (mean and standard deviation) being unknown – it is that &quot;regressions&quot; yield &quot;different residual distributions&quot; at &quot;different data points,&quot; unlike &quot;point estimators&quot; of univariate distributions, which share a &quot;common distribution&quot; for residuals.

==Background==

For this simple model, the design matrix is

:formula_12

and the hat matrix &quot;H&quot; is the matrix of the orthogonal projection onto the column space of the design matrix:

:formula_13

The leverage &quot;h&quot;&quot;ii&quot; is the &quot;i&quot;th diagonal entry in the hat matrix. The variance of the &quot;i&quot;th residual is

:formula_14

In case the design matrix &quot;X&quot; has only two columns (as in the example above), this is equal to

:formula_15

In the case of an arithmetic mean, the design matrix &quot;X&quot; has only one column (a vector of ones), and this is simply:

:formula_16

==Calculation==

Given the definitions above, the Studentized residual is then

:formula_17

where &quot;h&quot;&quot;ii&quot; is the leverage, and formula_18 is an appropriate estimate of &quot;σ&quot; (see below).

In the case of a mean, this is equal to:

:formula_19

==Internal and external studentization==

The usual estimate of &quot;σ&quot;2 is the &quot;internally studentized&quot; residual

:formula_20

where &quot;m&quot; is the number of parameters in the model (2 in our example).

But if the &quot;i&quot; th case is suspected of being improbably large, then it would also not be normally distributed. Hence it is prudent to exclude the &quot;i&quot; th observation from the process of estimating the variance when one is considering whether the &quot;i&quot; th case may be an outlier, and instead use the &quot;externally studentized&quot; residual, which is

:formula_21

based on all the residuals &quot;except&quot; the suspect &quot;i&quot; th residual. Here is to emphasize that formula_22 for suspect &quot;i&quot; are computed with &quot;i&quot; th case excluded. 

If the estimate &quot;σ&quot;2 &quot;includes&quot; the &quot;i&quot; th case, then it is called the internally studentized residual, formula_23 (also known as the &quot;standardized residual&quot; ).
If the estimate formula_24 is used instead, &quot;excluding&quot; the &quot;i&quot; th case, then it is called the externally studentized, formula_25.

==Distribution==

If the errors are independent and normally distributed with expected value 0 and variance &quot;σ&quot;2, then the probability distribution of the &quot;i&quot;th externally studentized residual formula_25 is a Student&#x27;s t-distribution with &quot;n&quot; − &quot;m&quot; − 1 degrees of freedom, and can range from formula_27 to formula_28.

On the other hand, the internally studentized residuals are in the range formula_29, where &quot;ν&quot; = &quot;n&quot; − &quot;m&quot; is the number of residual degrees of freedom. If &quot;t&quot;&quot;i&quot; represents the internally studentized residual, and again assuming that the errors are independent identically distributed Gaussian variables, then:

:formula_30

where &quot;t&quot; is a random variable distributed as Student&#x27;s t-distribution with &quot;ν&quot; − 1 degrees of freedom. In fact, this implies that &quot;t&quot;&quot;i&quot;2 /&quot;ν&quot; follows the beta distribution &quot;B&quot;(1/2,(&quot;ν&quot; − 1)/2).
The distribution above is sometimes referred to as the tau distribution; it was first derived by Thompson in 1935.

When &quot;ν&quot; = 3, the internally studentized residuals are uniformly distributed between formula_31 and formula_32.
If there is only one residual degree of freedom, the above formula for the distribution of internally studentized residuals doesn&#x27;t apply. In this case, the &quot;t&quot;&quot;i&quot; are all either +1 or −1, with 50% chance for each.

The standard deviation of the distribution of internally studentized residuals is always 1, but this does not imply that the standard deviation of all the &quot;t&quot;&quot;i&quot; of a particular experiment is 1.
For instance, the internally studentized residuals when fitting a straight line going through (0, 0) to the points (1, 4), (2, −1), (2, −1) are formula_33, and the standard deviation of these is not 1.

Note that any pair of studentized residual &quot;t&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;t&quot;&quot;j&quot; (where are NOT i.i.d. They have the same distribution, but are not independent due to constraints on the residuals having to sum to 0 and to have them be orthogonal to the design matrix.

==Software implementations==
Many programs and statistics packages, such as R, Python, etc., include implementations of Studentized residual.

<text>Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupré (September 4, 1789 – January 16, 1854) was a French botanist.

==Biography==
Gaudichaud was born in Angoulême, to J-J. Gaudichaud and Rose (Mallat) Gaudichaud. He studied pharmacology informally at Cognac and Angoulême, and then under Robiquet in Paris, where he acquired a knowledge of botany from Desfontaines and Louis Richard. In April 1810, he was appointed pharmacist in the military marine, and from July 1811 to the end of 1814, he served in Antwerp. He also studied chemistry and herbology.

His greatest claim to fame was serving as botanist on a circumglobal expedition from 1817 to 1820. He accompanied Freycinet, who made the expedition on the ships &quot;Uranie&quot; and &quot;Physicienne&quot;. The wreck of the &quot;Uranie&quot; in the Falkland Islands, at the close of 1819, deprived him of more than half the botanical collections he had made in various parts of the world. He is also known for his collections in Australia.

In 1831, Gaudichaud sailed on &quot;L&#x27;Herminie&quot; to South America, visiting Chile, Brazil and Peru. In 1836, he undertook a third voyage, circumnavigating the globe on &quot;La Bonite&quot;.

He died in Paris.

==Legacy==
Gaudichaud is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of South American lizards, &quot;Ecpleopus gaudichaudii&quot; and &quot;Garthia gaudichaudii&quot; (the Chilean marked gecko), and one species of Brazilian frog, &quot;Crossodactylus gaudichaudii&quot;. Two Hawaiian species of flowering plants, in the genus &quot;Scaevola&quot; are named after him, &quot;Scaevola gaudichaudiana&quot; and &quot;Scaevola gaudichaudii&quot;. Also, a genus of South American plants in the family Malpighiaceae, &quot;Gaudichaudia&quot;, is named after Gaudichaud.

He wrote various treatises, with memoirs on potato blight, the multiplication of bulbous plants, the increase in diameter of dicotyledonous plants, and other subjects.

<text>WUWG, FM 90.7, is the radio station that formerly broadcast at the University of West Georgia in Carrollton, Georgia, and is now a part of the Georgia Public Broadcasting radio state network. This station is one of several in the GPB system that also produces its own programming; however, the vast majority of the broadcast day is a simulcast of the statewide feed. That feed is also duplicated locally both by GPB&#x27;s WJSP-FM in Warm Springs and WGPB-FM in Rome, with most NPR programming also carried by non-GPB station WABE from nearby Atlanta. Several programs are also duplicated on Atlanta&#x27;s WRAS, most of whose broadcast day was involuntarily taken from Georgia State University students in June 2014, resulting in programs like &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot; being aired in the Carrollton area on no fewer than five different frequencies at once for seven total hours every weekday. Originally licensed to the university and operated entirely by students, WUWG was transferred outright to GPB in 2004, though it is unclear under what circumstances. When GPB consolidated broadcasting operations in its Atlanta offices in 2008, Dr. Brad Yates, chair of the UWG Mass Communications department, made advances to start a new student-run radio station.

==History==
It has been on the air since 1973, originally with the call sign WWGC, when the school was named West Georgia College. The station previously broadcast a very diverse college radio format, but now carries mostly the GPB radio feed from Atlanta. With an omnidirectional antenna, it covers Carroll County and somewhat beyond with 500 watts ERP.

In August 1994, WWGC became an affiliate of Public Radio International. This allowed the school to terminate most of the student-created programs, and rely mainly on satellite feeds instead. The station ran a ratio of 70% satellite/network programming to 30% student programming, resulting in content probably more suited to WGC faculty, broadcasting that was not necessarily in the interest of the community at large or in accord with student preferences. WUWG airs local news and features, as well as a few student-produced programs in the evenings, but they are only a fraction of those provided previously before WGC obtained access to the public radio system.

In 2001, the station changed call letters from WWGC to WUWG, which reflected the school&#x27;s name change. The University of West Georgia assumed its present name in 1995.

==Personalities==
Some notable former DJs at the station include Dale Hurlebaus (a/k/a ROKNDJ), Ryan Cameron, Rhubarb Jones, Rob Parker, Randall Davidson, Jonathan Dorsey, Lisa Lang, Kevin Sanders, Robert Ray, Audra Schwarz, Trevor Head, Drew Fountain, Bubba Petty, Jim Rosser, Mike Bland, Sean Gilbert, Lacey Smith, Brooks Robinson, Errol Crane, John Crosby, Tommy Butler, Jerry Edwards, Bryan Hubbard, Sam Mills, Teri Lamprey, Singin&#x27; Steve Sedberry, Emily Alexander, Joe Harris, Joshua Head, Michael Booth, Mark Veljkov, Dave Callaway, Dave Reynolds, Alan Abernathy and Scott Evans.

<doc id="609222" wikidata="Q2581759" url="?curid=609222" title="Willis Carrier">
<text>Willis Haviland Carrier (November 26, 1876 – October 7, 1950) was an American engineer, best known for inventing modern air conditioning. Carrier invented the first electrical air conditioning unit in 1902. In 1915, he founded Carrier Corporation, a company specializing in the manufacture and distribution of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.

==Early life and education==
Willis Haviland Carrier was born on November 26, 1876, in Angola, New York, the son of Duane Williams Carrier (1836–1908) and Elizabeth R. Haviland (1845–1888). He graduated from Angola Academy in 1894 and from the Buffalo High School in 1897.

He studied at Cornell University starting in 1897 and graduated in 1901 with a Master of Engineering degree.

==Career==
After graduating, Carrier joined the Buffalo Forge Company as a research engineer.
In Buffalo, New York, on July 17, 1902, in response to an air quality problem experienced at the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing &amp; Publishing Company of Brooklyn, New York, Willis Carrier submitted drawings for what became recognized as the world&#x27;s first modern air conditioning system. It was so humid in summer that the paper grew and shrank, which resulted in poor quality images, because the color printing process involved running the same piece of paper up to four times, each with a different color ink.

The 1902 installation marked the birth of air conditioning because of the addition of humidity control, which led to the recognition by authorities in the field that A/C must perform four basic functions:

# control temperature
# control humidity
# control air circulation and ventilation
# cleanse the air

After several more years of refinement and field testing, on January 2, 1906, Carrier was granted for an &quot;Apparatus for Treating Air,&quot; the world&#x27;s first spray-type air conditioning equipment. It was designed to humidify or dehumidify air, heating water for the first function and cooling it for the second.

In 1906 Carrier discovered that &quot;constant dew-point depression provided practically constant relative humidity,&quot; which later became known among air conditioning engineers as the &quot;law of constant dew-point depression.&quot; On this discovery he based the design of an automatic control system, for which he filed a patent claim on May 17, 1907. was issued on February 3, 1914.

In 1908, the Carrier Air Conditioner Company of America was created as a subsidiary of the Buffalo Forge Company, with Willis Carrier as its vice president.

On December 3, 1911, Carrier presented what is perhaps the most significant document ever prepared on air conditioning –
&quot;&quot; – at the annual meeting of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. It became known as the &quot;Magna Carta of Psychrometrics.&quot; This document tied together the concepts of relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew-point temperature, thus making it possible to design air-conditioning systems to precisely fit the requirements at hand.

With the onset of World War I in late 1914, the Buffalo Forge Company, where Carrier had been employed for 12 years, decided to confine its activities entirely to manufacturing. The result was that seven young engineers pooled together their life savings of $32,600 to form the Carrier Engineering Corporation in New York on June 26, 1915. The seven were Carrier, J. Irvine Lyle, Edward T. Murphy, L. Logan Lewis, Ernest T. Lyle, Frank Sanna, Alfred E. Stacey Jr., and Edmund P. Heckel. The company eventually settled on Frelinghuysen Avenue in Newark, New Jersey.

===Great Depression and afterwards===
Despite the development of the centrifugal refrigeration machine and the commercial growth of air conditioning to cool buildings in the 1920s, the company ran into financial difficulties, as did many other companies, as a result of the Wall Street Crash in October 1929. In 1930, Carrier Engineering Corp. merged with Brunswick-Kroeschell Company and York Heating &amp; Ventilating Corporation to form the Carrier Corporation, with Willis Carrier named chairman of the board.

The Great Depression slowed residential and commercial use of air conditioning. The company spread out over four cities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania until Carrier consolidated and moved his company to Syracuse, New York, in 1937. The company became one of the largest employers in central New York.

Carrier&#x27;s igloo-shaped pavilion in the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair gave visitors a glimpse into the future of air conditioning, but before it became popular, World War II began. During the post-war economic boom of the 1950s, air conditioning began its tremendous growth in popularity. Today, air-conditioning and HVAC is a staple in many American homes and businesses.

At the time of his death, Carrier was a trustee of Cornell University.

==Legacy==
In 1930, Carrier started Toyo Carrier and Samsung Applications in Japan and Korea. South Korea is now the largest producer for air conditioning in the world. The Carrier Corporation pioneered the design and manufacture of refrigeration machines to cool large spaces. By increasing industrial production in the summer months, air conditioning revolutionized American life. The company became a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation in 1980, and remained so until 2020, when it was spun off again as an independent publicly traded company. The Carrier Corporation remains a world leader in commercial and residential HVAC and refrigeration. In 2018, the Carrier Corporation had sales of $18.6 billion and employed 53,000 people.

The Willis H. Carrier Total Indoor Environmental Quality Lab at the Syracuse University&#x27;s Center of Excellence in Environmental and Energy Systems is named in his honor. The lab was established in 2010 with a donation from the Carrier Corp.

==Personal life==
Carrier met Edith Claire Seymour at Cornell and they married on August 29, 1902. Edith Claire Seymour died in 1912. He married Jennie Tifft Martin on April 16, 1913. She died in 1939. He married Elizabeth Marsh Wise of Terre Haute, Indiana on February 7, 1941. Carrier and all three of his wives are buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo, New York. Carrier fathered one child, Howard Carter Willis. He also adopted another two children from Jennie Martin, Vernon Gardner Carrier (1903–1985) and Earl Gardner Carrier (1905–1983).

Carrier was a Presbyterian. He lived in Syracuse. He died on October 7, 1950, at Cornell Medical Center. He was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo.

==Awards and recognition==
For his contributions to science and industry, Willis Carrier was awarded an engineering degree by Lehigh University in 1935 and an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by Alfred University in 1942; Carrier was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal in 1942; and was inducted posthumously in the National Inventors Hall of Fame (1985) and the Buffalo Science Museum Hall of Fame (2008).

<doc id="609225" wikidata="Q204027" url="?curid=609225" title="Sergei Ivanov">
<text>Sergei Borisovich Ivanov (; born 31 January 1953) is a Russian senior official and politician who has been serving as the Special Presidential Envoy on the Issues of Environmental Activities, Ecology and Transport since 12 August 2016. He has the federal state civilian service rank of 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation.

Ivanov had held the posts of Minister of Defense of Russia from March 2001 to February 2007, of Deputy Prime Minister from November 2005 to February 2007, and of First Deputy Prime Minister from February 2007 to May 2008. After the election of Dmitry Medvedev as President of Russia, Ivanov was reappointed a Deputy Prime Minister (in office: 2008–2011) in Vladimir Putin&#x27;s second cabinet. From December 2011 to August 2016, Ivanov worked as the Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office. Having served in the Soviet KGB and in its successor, the Federal Security Service, he holds the rank of colonel general.

Before joining the federal administration in Moscow, Ivanov served from the late 1991s in Europe and in Africa (Kenya) as a specialist in law and foreign languages. As an employee of the KGB in the Soviet-Union era, Ivanov became a friend of his colleague Vladimir Putin,
who appointed him as his Deputy in 1998. He belongs to the &quot;siloviki&quot; of Putin&#x27;s inner circle.

== Youth, education, and early career ==
Ivanov was born on 31 January 1953 in Leningrad. In 1975, he graduated from the English translation branch of the Department of Philology at Leningrad State University, where he majored in English and Swedish. In the late 1970s, Ivanov began a career spanning two decades on the staff of the external intelligence service. In 1976, he completed postgraduate studies in counterintelligence, graduating from Higher Courses of the KGB in Minsk.

Upon graduating in 1976, Ivanov was sent to serve for the Leningrad and Leningrad Oblast KGB Directorate, where he became a friend of Vladimir Putin, then a colleague of his. In 1981, he studied at the Red Banner Institute of KGB.

In the 1980s, Ivanov served as Second Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki, working directly under the KGB resident Felix Karasev.

After Finland, he was sent to Kenya as KGB resident.

In 2015, Ivanov stated that his career in the KGB had been ruined and destroyed because of Oleg Gordievsky&#x27;s defection and exfiltration on 19 July 1985 from Moscow through the northwestern part of the Soviet Union near Leningrad and then through Finland to the United Kingdom. Gordievsky&#x27;s defection greatly embarrassed both the KGB and the Soviet Union. As a result, the Leningrad directorate, which was responsible for surveillance of British subjects at the time, had numerous persons purged from its service by Viktor Babunov, the head of counterintelligence, including many people close to Vladimir Putin, who also served with the Leningrad KGB at the time.

== Career in Moscow ==
In August 1998, Vladimir Putin became head of the FSB, and appointed Ivanov his deputy. As deputy director of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov solidified his reputation in Moscow as a competent analyst in matters of domestic and external security.

=== Head of the Security Council ===
On 15 November 1999, Boris Yeltsin appointed Ivanov as secretary of the Security Council of Russia, an advisory body charged with formulating presidential directives on national security. In that position, Ivanov replaced Putin as Yeltsin&#x27;s national security adviser upon Putin&#x27;s promotion to the premiership.

As secretary, Ivanov was responsible for coordinating the daily work of the council, led by the president. But Ivanov&#x27;s role as secretary was initially unclear to media observers. At the time of his appointment, the Security Council was a relatively new institution. (The council was set up by Yeltsin&#x27;s tutelage in 1991–1992). Between 1992 and Ivanov&#x27;s appointment in 1999, Yeltsin used the council as political expediency dictated but did not allow it to emerge as a relatively strong and autonomous institution. According to Western analysts, Ivanov&#x27;s predecessors in that post – including Putin – were either the second most powerful political figure in Russia or just another functionary lacking close access to the center of state power, depending on their relationship with Yeltsin.

=== Minister of Defense ===
Ivanov was named by Vladimir Putin, who had succeeded Yeltsin as president on 31 December 1999, as Russia&#x27;s Minister of Defense in March 2001. That month, Ivanov stepped down as secretary of the Security Council, but remained a member. Ivanov had resigned from military service around a year earlier, and was a civilian while serving as secretary of the Security Council. Ivanov therefore became Russia&#x27;s first civilian Defense minister. Putin called the personnel changes in Russia&#x27;s security structures coinciding with Ivanov&#x27;s appointment as Defense minister &quot;a step toward demilitarizing public life.&quot; Putin also stressed Ivanov&#x27;s responsibility for overseeing military reform as Defense minister.

Unsurprisingly to specialists on Russia, Ivanov became bogged down in the sheer difficulty of his duties as Defense Minister. But, despite bureaucratic inertia and corruption in the military, Ivanov did preside over some changes in the form of a shift towards a more professional army. Although Ivanov was not successful in abandoning the draft, he did downsize it.

As Defense Minister, Ivanov worked with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to expand Russian-U.S. cooperation against international terrorist threats to both states.

In May 2001, Ivanov was elected chairman of the Council of Commonwealth of Independent States Defense Ministers.

In October 2003, Ivanov claimed that Russia did not rule out a pre-emptive military strike anywhere in the world if the national interest demands it.

In 2004, Ivanov, as Defense Minister, pledged state support to the suspects in Chechen leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev&#x27;s assassination detained in Qatar and declared that their imprisonment was illegal. Later, Qatari prosecutors concluded that the suspects had received the order to eliminate Zelimkhan Yandarbiev from Ivanov personally.
In January 2006, Ivanov received criticism for his downplaying response to the public outcry over a particularly brutal hazing incident at a military base in the Urals, which involved Andrey Sychyov as a victim, whose legs and genitals were amputated due to the vicious beatings and abuse.

From time to time, Ivanov has disconcerted Western audiences with the bluntness of his remarks on international military and political issues, though his political orientation is moderate and generally liberal on economic issues. In a series of public comments on the 2003–2004 elections, for instance, he unequivocally stated his opposition to rolling back the Western-style economic reforms and privatizations of the 1990s.

On 15 December 2006 in Moscow, Ivanov said to foreign correspondents about Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned in London in November, which made headlines in the West: &quot;For us, Litvinenko was nothing. We didn&#x27;t care what he said and what he wrote on his deathbed.&quot;

=== Deputy Prime Minister ===
In November 2005, Ivanov was appointed to the post of Deputy Prime Minister in Mikhail Fradkov&#x27;s Second Cabinet, with added responsibility for the Manufacturing industry and arms exports. On 15 February 2007, Putin relieved him of his duties as Defense Minister and elevated him to the position as First Deputy Prime Minister with responsibility over defense industry, aerospace industry, nanotechnology and transport In June 2007, Ivanov was appointed chairman of the Government Council for Nanotechnology.

=== 2008 presidential election ===

Because of Putin&#x27;s popularity with voters, opinion polls and Russian political analysts expected Putin&#x27;s endorsement to help any preferred candidate in the 2008 Russian presidential election. Speculation intensified in November 2005 with Ivanov&#x27;s promotion to the rank of Deputy Prime Minister. The speculation further intensified in February 2007 with Ivanov&#x27;s promotion to the post of First Deputy Prime Minister, but rumours ceased after the United Russia party nominated Ivanov&#x27;s colleague Dmitry Medvedev to run for the presidency - with Putin&#x27;s backing. Ivanov expressed his support for Medvedev&#x27;s candidacy as well.

Russian opinion polls suggested that Ivanov enjoyed wide name-recognition among the Russian public with relatively strong approval ratings.

Ivanov&#x27;s career, in terms of his background and rise through Russia&#x27;s state structures, was often compared to Putin&#x27;s, fueling speculation that Ivanov might run for president in 2008. Three months younger than Putin, Ivanov had been a student contemporary of Putin&#x27;s in their hometown of Leningrad where both completed competitive specialized secondary-education programs (Putin in chemistry, Ivanov in English language) before attending Leningrad State University.
Both completed postgraduate studies in counterintelligence; and both joined the foreign intelligence service shortly afterward. However, according to Ivanov&#x27;s recollections, he did not become acquainted with Putin during their time as students, but rather when both were assigned to work in the same foreign-intelligence division in Leningrad.

=== Chief of Staff ===

In December 2011, Ivanov was appointed Chief of Staff of the Presidential Administration of Russia. He was noted for his hawkish views during the Russo-Ukrainian War and towards the West and his major role in lobbying for the Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War.

On 12 August 2016, Ivanov was relieved from his Chief of Staff position by Putin and replaced by Anton Vaino. Ivanov then became a special envoy for transportation and the environment. Putin&#x27;s firing of Ivanov was part of a series of replacements of Putin&#x27;s older peers with young loyalists. The Steele dossier (Report 2016/111) claims that his encouragement of meddling in the 2016 United States presidential election, which provoked unanticipated blowback against the Kremlin, was the catalyst for his firing.

== Personal life ==
Ivanov married in 1976 and has two children. His son, Sergei Sergeevich Ivanov (; born 23 October 1980) is a banker, graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations with a degree in economics in 2001 and in finance in 2002, worked at the State Investment Corporation () known as Gosinkor () under the Lieutenant Colonel of the Reserve KGB officer Vladimir Nikolaevich Kozhemyakin (), and then, from 2003 to 2004, was both the chief expert on international projects at Gazprom and an assistant to Andrey Akimov who is chairman of the board of Gazprombank. He was a board member and vice president of Gazprombank from January 2005 to 2011, and, from April 2011 to March 2016, headed the board of SOGAZ, then headed the Wealth Management division as a Senior Vice President of Sberbank from 24 March 2016 until 13 March 2017 when he became the CEO of the Russian state-owned diamond mining company Alrosa. Sergei Sergeevich Ivanov was sanctioned by the U.S. in February 2022.

He is fluent in English and Swedish as well as speaking Norwegian, and some French. His hobbies include fishing, and reading detective novels in the original English. Ivanov supports CSKA Moscow, he can often be seen at PFC CSKA and PBC CSKA matches.

On 20 May 2005, a Volkswagen driven by Ivanov&#x27;s eldest son, Alexander (1977–2014), struck and killed a 68-year-old woman, Svetlana Beridze, on a zebra crossing. Charges against him were, however, dropped. Alexander graduated with a degree in global economics from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, and was deputy chairman of Vnesheconombank. He died on 3 November 2014 after drowning in the United Arab Emirates.

=== Sanctions ===
On 20 March 2014, the American Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced that Ivanov and 19 other Russian oligarchs had been added to the Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN).

On 24 February 2022, the United States announced new sanctions against Ivanov and his son Sergey in response to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

<doc id="609234" wikidata="Q202770" url="?curid=609234" title="Alexei Kosygin">
<text>Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin (; – 18 December 1980) was a Soviet statesman during the Cold War. He served as the Premier of the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1980 and was one of the most influential Soviet policymakers in the mid-1960s along with General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev.

Kosygin was born in the city of Saint Petersburg in 1904 to a Russian working-class family. He was conscripted into the labour army during the Russian Civil War, and after the Red Army&#x27;s demobilization in 1921, he worked in Siberia as an industrial manager. Kosygin returned to Leningrad in the early 1930s and worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. During the Great Patriotic War (World War II), Kosygin was tasked by the State Defence Committee with moving Soviet industry out of territories soon to be overrun by the German Army. He served as Minister of Finance for a year before becoming Minister of Light Industry (later, Minister of Light Industry and Food). Stalin removed Kosygin from the Politburo one year before his own death in 1953, intentionally weakening Kosygin&#x27;s position within the Soviet hierarchy.

Stalin died in 1953, and on 20 March 1959, Kosygin was appointed to the position of chairman of the State Planning Committee (Gosplan), a post he would hold for little more than a year. Kosygin next became First Deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers. When Nikita Khrushchev was removed from power in 1964, Kosygin and Leonid Brezhnev succeeded him as Premier and First Secretary, respectively. Thereafter, as a member of the collective leadership, Kosygin formed an unofficial Triumvirate (also known by its Russian name &quot;Troika&quot;) alongside Brezhnev and Nikolai Podgorny, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, that governed the Soviet Union in Khrushchev&#x27;s place.

During the initial years following Khrushchev&#x27;s ouster, Kosygin initially emerged as the most prominent figure in the Soviet leadership. In addition to managing the Soviet Union&#x27;s economy, he assumed a preeminent role in its foreign policy by leading arms control talks with the US and overseeing relations with Western countries in general. However, the onset of the Prague Spring in 1968 sparked a severe backlash against his policies, enabling Leonid Brezhnev to decisively eclipse him as the dominant force within the Politburo. While he and Brezhnev disliked one another, he remained in office until being forced to retire on 23 October 1980, due to bad health. He died two months later on 18 December 1980.

==Early life==
Kosygin was born into a Russian working-class family consisting of his father and mother (Nikolai Ilyich and Matrona Alexandrovna) and his siblings. The family lived in Saint Petersburg. Kosygin was baptized ( 1904) one month after his birth. He lost his mother in infancy and was brought up by his father.

He and his father sympathized with the Revolution and Alexei was conscripted into a labour army on the Bolshevik side at the age of 14 during the Russian Civil War of 1917–1922. After demobilization from the Red Army in 1921, Kosygin attended the Leningrad Co-operative Technical School and found work in the system of consumer co-operatives in Novosibirsk, Siberia. When asked why he worked in the co-operative sector of the economy, Kosygin replied, quoting a slogan of Vladimir Lenin: &quot;Co-operation – the path to socialism!&quot; Kosygin stayed there for six years until Robert Eikhe personally advised him to quit, shortly before the repressions hit the Soviet consumer co-operation movement.

==Early career==
=== Pre-war period ===
He applied for a membership in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1927 and returned to Leningrad in 1930 to study at the ; he graduated in 1935. After finishing his studies, Kosygin worked as a foreman and later a manager in a textile mill director. He rose rapidly during the Great Purge, overseen in Leningrad by the provincial communist party boss, Andrei Zhdanov. He was appointed director of the October Textile Factory in 1937, head of the Industry and Transport department of the Leningrad provincial communist party in July 1938, and in October 1938, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Leningrad City Soviets of Working People&#x27;s Deputies, i.e. &#x27;mayor&#x27; of Leningrad City. In 1939, he was appointed People&#x27;s Commissar for Textile and Industry and earned a seat on the Central Committee (CC). In 1940 Kosygin became a Deputy Chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars.

=== Wartime ===
Kosygin was appointed by the State Defence Committee to manage critically important missions during the Great Patriotic War (World War II).

As deputy chairman of the Council of Evacuation, he had the task of evacuating industry from territories about to be overrun by the Axis. Under his command 1523 factories were evacuated eastwards, as well as huge volumes of raw materials, ready-made goods and equipment. Kosygin managed clearing of congestions on the railroads in order to maintain their stable operation.

During the Leningrad Blockade he was sent to his hometown to manage the construction of an ice road and a pipeline across Lake Ladoga. This allowed to evacuate some half-million people from the besieged and starving city, and to supply fuel to its factories and power plants. He was also responsible for the procurement of locally available firewood.

In 1943 Alexey Kosygin was promoted to Chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (government) of the Russian SFSR. In 1944 he was appointed to head the Currency Board of the Soviet Union.

=== Afterwar period ===
Kosygin became a candidate member of the Politburo in 1946. During the Soviet famine of 1946–47 He headed the foodstuff relief missions to the most suffering regions. He was appointed USSR Minister for Finance in February 1948, and a full member of the Politburo on 4 September 1948, putting him among the dozen or so most ranking officials in the USSR.

Kosygin&#x27;s administrative skills led Stalin to take the younger man under his wing. Stalin shared information with Kosygin, such as how much money the families of Vyacheslav Molotov, Anastas Mikoyan, and Lazar Kaganovich possessed, spent and paid their staff. (A Politburo member earned a modest salary by Soviet standards but enjoyed unlimited access to consumer goods.) Stalin sent Kosygin to each home to put their houses into &quot;proper order&quot;.

=== Temporary fall ===
Kosygin&#x27;s patron, Zhdanov, died suddenly in August 1948. Soon afterwards, Zhdanov&#x27;s old rivals Lavrentiy Beria and Georgy Malenkov persuaded Stalin to let them remove members of the decapitated Zhdanov faction, of whom the three most prominent were Nikolai Voznesensky, then Chairman of the State Planning Committee and a First Deputy Premier, Alexey Kuznetsov, the party secretary with oversight over the security, and Kosygin. During the brutal purge that followed, known as the Leningrad affair, Voznesensky, Kuznetsov and many others were arrested and shot. Kosygin was relegated to the post of USSR Minister for Light Industry, while nominally retaining his membership of the Politburo until 1952. Nikita Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs:

Kosygin told his son-in-law Mikhail Gvishiani, an NKVD officer, of the accusations leveled against Voznesensky because of his possession of firearms. Gvishiani and Kosygin threw all their weapons into a lake and searched both their own houses for any listening devices. They found one at Kosygin&#x27;s house, but it might have been installed to spy on Marshal Georgy Zhukov, who had lived there before him. According to his memoirs, Kosygin never left his home without reminding his wife what to do if he did not return from work. After living two years in constant fear, the family reached the conclusion that Stalin would not harm them. 

===Khrushchev era===
In September 1953, six months after Stalin&#x27;s death, Kosygin was appointed USSR Minister for Industrial Goods, and in December he was reinstated as a Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, under Malenkov, Stalin&#x27;s immediate successor, but lost that position in December 1956, during Khrushchev&#x27;s ascendancy, when he was appointed Deputy Chairman of the State Economic Commission. When the power struggle between Khrushchev and the so-called &#x27;Anti-Party Group&#x27; came to a head in 1957, Kosygin backed Khrushchev because, as he said later, if Malenkov and his allies had won &quot;blood would have flowed again&quot;, but the French journalist , a close observer who was based in Moscow at the time, concluded that &quot;Kosygin did not owe anything to Khrushchev&quot; and that out of the post-1957 leadership &quot;was visibly the least willing to praise the First Secretary&quot;, and that Khrushchev was &quot;somewhat reluctant&quot; to promote Kosygin.

However, despite Khrushchev&#x27;s reluctance, Kosygin&#x27;s career made a steady recovery. In June 1957, he was again appointed a Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers (for the third time), and a candidate member of the Presidium Central Committee (the renamed Politburo). In March 1959, he was made Chairman of Gosplan, and on 4 May 1960, he was promoted First deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and a full member of the Presidium.

As First Deputy Premier Kosygin travelled abroad, mostly on trade missions, to countries such as North Korea, India, Argentina and Italy. Since 1959 Kosygin headed Soviet mission to the ComEcon. Later, in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kosygin was the Soviet spokesman for improved relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. According to Michel Tatu, in 1960–62, Kosygin was one of the &#x27;big four&#x27;, with Khrushchev, Frol Kozlov and Leonid Brezhnev, who would be present in the Kremlin to greet visiting leaders of East European communist parties, implying, but in November 1962, after Khrushchev complained about the management of Gosplan, and opposed Kosygin&#x27;s plans for economic reform, he was removed from the inner leadership.

==Premiership==

===Struggle for power with Brezhnev===
When Khrushchev was removed from power in October 1964, Kosygin replaced him as Premier in a collective leadership that included Leonid Brezhnev as general secretary and Nikolai Podgorny who ultimately became Chairman of the Presidium. Overall, the new Politburo adopted a more conservative outlook than that under Khrushchev&#x27;s rule.

Kosygin, Podgorny and Andrei Kirilenko were the most reformist members, Brezhnev and Arvīds Pelše belonged to the moderate faction while Mikhail Suslov retained his leadership of the party&#x27;s Stalinist wing.

In October 1964, at a ceremony in honour of Soviet cosmonauts, Brezhnev called for the strengthening of the Party apparatus. This speech was only the beginning of a large campaign directed against Kosygin. Several newspapers, such as &quot;Pravda&quot; and &quot;Kommunist&quot;, criticized the work of the Council of Ministers, and indirectly Kosygin, its chairman, for planning the economy in an unrealistic fashion, and used the highly aggressive rhetoric previously used to condemn Khrushchev against Kosygin.

Brezhnev was able to criticize Kosygin by contrasting him with Vladimir Lenin, who – Brezhnev claimed – had been more interested in improving the conditions of Soviet agriculture than improving the quality of light industrial goods. Kosygin&#x27;s support for producing more consumer goods was also criticized by Brezhnev, and his supporters, most notably Konstantin Chernenko, for being a return to quasi First World policies. At the 23rd Party Congress, Kosygin&#x27;s position was weakened when Brezhnev&#x27;s supporters were able to increase expenditure on defense and agriculture. However, Brezhnev did not have a majority in the Politburo, and could count on only four votes. In the Politburo, Kosygin could count on Kiril Mazurov&#x27;s vote, and when Kosygin and Podgorny were not bickering with each other, they actually had a majority in the Politburo over Brezhnev. Unfortunately for Kosygin this was not often the case, and Kosygin and Podgorny were constantly disagreeing on policy.

Early during Kosygin&#x27;s tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin attempt to create stability was failing on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970, discontent within the Soviet leadership had grown to such an extent that some started to doubt both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include the handling of the Prague Spring and the later Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and the USSR were held: the Warsaw Pact Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.

By 1970, these differences had not been resolved, and Brezhnev postponed the 24th Party Congress and the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975). The delay in resolving these issues led to rumors circulating in Soviet society that Kosygin, or even Brezhnev, would lose their posts to Podgorny. By March 1971, it became apparent that Brezhnev was the leader of the country, with Kosygin as the spokesman of the five-year plan and Podgorny&#x27;s position within the collective leadership strengthened.

===Foreign policy===

Early on in his tenure, Kosygin challenged Brezhnev&#x27;s right as general secretary to represent the country abroad, a function Kosygin believed should fall into the hands of the head of government, as was common in non-communist countries. This was actually implemented for a short period, which led Henry A. Kissinger to believe that Kosygin was the leader of the Soviet Union. Kosygin, who had been the chief negotiator with the First World during the 1960s, was hardly to be seen outside the Second World after Brezhnev consolidated his position within the Politburo, but also due to Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko&#x27;s dislike of Kosygin meddling into his own ministerial affairs.The Six-Day War in the Middle East had the effect of increasing Soviet–American cooperation; to improve relations even further, the United States Government invited Kosygin to a summit with Lyndon B. Johnson, the President of the United States, following his speech to the United Nations. At the summit, which became known as the Glassboro Summit Conference, Johnson and Kosygin failed to reach agreement on limiting anti-ballistic missile systems, but the summit&#x27;s friendly and even open atmosphere was referred to as the &quot;Spirit of Glassboro&quot;. Relations between the two countries improved further when the 1970 Moscow Treaty was signed on 12 August 1970 by Kosygin and Gromyko and Willy Brandt and Walter Scheel who represented West Germany. In 1971, Kosygin gave an extensive interview to the American delegation that included David Rockefeller, presenting his views on US-Soviet relations, environmental protection, arms control and other issues. 
Kosygin developed a close friendly relationship with the President of Finland Urho Kekkonen, which helped the USSR to maintain active mutual trade with Finland and to keep it away from Cold War confrontation.

In 1972, Kosygin signed a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the government of Iraq, building on strong Soviet ties to the Iraqi Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party and previous close relations with Iraqi leader Abd al-Karim Qasim.

Kosygin protected János Kádár&#x27;s economic reforms and his position as leader of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic from intervention by the Soviet leadership. Polish leader Władysław Gomułka, who was removed from all of his posts in 1970, was succeeded by Edward Gierek who tried to revitalize the economy of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland by borrowing money from the First World. The Soviet leadership approved both countries&#x27; respective economic experiments, since it was trying to reduce its large Eastern Bloc subsidy programme in the form of cheap oil and gas exports. During the discussions within the Soviet leadership of a possible Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia Kosygin reminded leaders of the consequences of the Soviet suppression of the 1956 Hungarian revolution. Kosygin&#x27;s stance became more aggressive later on when he understood that the reforms in Czechoslovakia could be turned against his 1965 Soviet economic reform.
Kosygin acted as a mediator between India and Pakistan in 1966, and got both nations to sign the Tashkent Declaration. Kosygin became the chief spokesman on the issue of arms control. In retrospect, many of Kosygin&#x27;s colleagues felt he carried out his work &quot;stoically&quot;, but lacked &quot;enthusiasm&quot;, and therefore never developed a real taste for international politics.

The Sino–Soviet split chagrined Kosygin a great deal, and for a while he refused to accept its irrevocability; he briefly visited Beijing in 1969 due to increased tension between the USSR and Maoist China. Kosygin said, in a close-knit circle, that &quot;We are communists and they are communists. It is hard to believe we will not be able to reach an agreement if we met face to face&quot;. His view on China changed however, and according to Harold Wilson, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Kosygin viewed China as an &quot;organized military dictatorship&quot; whose intended goal was to enslave &quot;Vietnam and the whole of Asia&quot;.

During an official visit by an Afghan delegation, Kosygin and Andrei Kirilenko criticized Afghan leaders Nur Muhammad Taraki and Hafizullah Amin for Stalinist-like repressionist behaviour. He promised to send more economic and military aid, but rejected any proposal regarding a possible Soviet intervention, as an intervention in Afghanistan would strain the USSR&#x27;s foreign relations with the First World according to Kosygin, most notably West Germany. However, in a closed meeting, without Kosygin, who strongly opposed any kind of military intervention, the Politburo unanimously supported a Soviet intervention.

===Economic policy===

====Five-Year Plans====

The Eighth Five-Year Plan (1966–1970) is considered to be one of the most successful periods for the Soviet economy and the most successful when it comes to consumer production (see The &quot;Kosygin&quot; reform). It became known as the &quot;golden era&quot;. The 23rd Party Congress and the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975) had been postponed by Brezhnev due to a power struggle within the Soviet leadership. At the 23rd Party Congress Kosygin promised that the Ninth Five-Year Plan would increase the supply of food, clothing and other household appliances up to 50 percent. The plan envisaged a massive increase in the Soviet standard of living, with Kosygin proclaiming a growth of 40 percent for the population&#x27;s cash income in his speech to the congress.

The Tenth Five-Year Plan (1976–1981) was referred to by Kosygin as the &quot;plan of quality&quot;. Brezhnev rejected Kosygin&#x27;s bid for producing more consumer goods during the Tenth Five-Year Plan. As a result, the total volume of consumer goods in industrial production only stood at 26 percent. Kosygin&#x27;s son-in-law notes that Kosygin was furious with the decision, and proclaimed increased defence expenditure would become the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;complete ruin&quot;. The plan was less ambitious than its predecessors, with targets of national industrial growth no higher than what the rest of the world had already achieved. Soviet agriculture would receive a share investment of 34 percent, a share much larger than its proportional contribution to the Soviet economy, as it accounted for only 3 percent of the Soviet GDP.

====The &quot;Kosygin&quot; reform====

Like Khrushchev, Kosygin tried to reform the command economy within a socialist framework. In 1965 Kosygin initiated an economic reform widely referred to as the &quot;Kosygin reform&quot;. Kosygin sought to make Soviet industry more efficient by including some market measures common in the First World such as profit making for instance; he also tried to increase quantity of production, increase incentives for managers and workers, and freeing managers from centralized state bureaucracy. The reform had been proposed to Khrushchev in 1964, who evidently liked it and took some preliminary steps to implement it. Brezhnev allowed the reform to proceed because the Soviet economy was entering a period of low growth. In its testing phase, the reform was applied to 336 enterprises in light industry.

The reform was influenced by the works of Soviet economist Evsei Liberman. Kosygin overestimated the ability of the Soviet administrative machine to develop the economy, which led to &quot;corrections&quot; to some of Liberman&#x27;s more controversial beliefs about decentralization. According to critics, Kosygin&#x27;s changes to Liberman&#x27;s original vision caused the reform to fail.

Kosygin believed that decentralization, semi-public companies, and cooperatives were keys to catching up to the First World&#x27;s contemporary level of economic growth. His reform sought a gradual change from a &quot;state-administered economy&quot; to an economy in which &quot;the state restricts itself to guiding enterprises&quot;. The reform was implemented, but showed several malfunctions and inconsistencies early on.

=====Results=====
The salary for Soviet citizens increased abruptly by almost 2.5 times during the plan. Real wages in 1980 amounted to 232.7 rubles, compared to 166.3 rubles before the 1965 Soviet economic reform and the Eighth Five-Year Plan. The first period, 1960–1964, was characterized by low growth, while the second period, 1965–1981, had a stronger growth rate. The second period vividly demonstrated the success of the Kosygin reform, with the average annual growth in retail turnover being 11.2 billion rubles, 1.8 times higher than in the first period and 1.2 times higher than the third period (1981–1985). Consumption of goods and daily demand also increased. The consumption of home appliances greatly increased. Refrigerators increased from a low of 109,000 in 1964 to 440,000 units by 1973; consumption declined during the reversal of the reform. Car production increased, and would continue to do so until the late 1980s. The Soviet leadership, under pressure, sought to provide more attractive goods for Soviet consumers.

The removal of Khrushchev in 1964 signalled the end of his &quot;housing revolution&quot;. Housing construction declined between 1960 and 1964 to an average of 1.63 million square metres. Following this sudden decrease, housing construction increased sharply between 1965 and 1966, but dropped again, and then steadily grew (the average annual growth rate was 4.26 million square metres). This came largely at the expense of businesses. While the housing shortage was never fully resolved, and still remains a problem in present-day Russia, the reform overcame the negative trend and renewed the growth of housing construction.

=====Cancellation and aftermath=====
Growing hostility towards reform, the initial poor results, and Kosygin&#x27;s reformist stance, led to a popular backlash against him. Kosygin lost most of the privileges he had enjoyed before the reform, but Brezhnev was never able to remove him from the office of Chairman of the Council of Ministers, despite his weakened position. In the aftermath of his failed reform, Kosygin spent the rest of his life improving the economic administration through the modification of targets; he implemented various programmes to improve food security and ensure the future intensification of production. There is no proof to back up the claim that the reform itself contributed to the high growth seen in the late-1960s, or that its cancellation had anything to do with the stagnating growth of the economy which began in the 1970s.

====1973 and 1979 reforms====

Kosygin initiated another economic reform in 1973 with the intentions of weakening the central Ministries and giving more powers to the regional authorities in republican and local-levels. The reform&#x27;s failure to meet Kosygin&#x27;s goal led to its cancellation. However, the reform succeeded in creating &quot;associations&quot;, an organization representing various enterprises. The last significant reform undertaken by the pre-&quot;perestroika&quot; leadership was initiated by Kosygin&#x27;s fifth government in a joint decision of the Central Committee and the Council of Ministers. The &quot;Improving planning and reinforcing the effects of the economic mechanism on raising the effectiveness in production and improving the quality of work&quot;, more commonly known as the 1979 reform. The reform, in contrast to the 1965 reform, was intended to increase the central government&#x27;s economic involvement by enhancing the duties and responsibilities of the ministries. Due to Kosygin&#x27;s resignation in 1980, and because of Nikolai Tikhonov&#x27;s conservative approach to economics, very little of the reform was actually implemented.

==Later life and resignation==

By the early to mid-1970s Brezhnev had established a strong enough power base to effectively become leader. According to historian Ilya Zemtsov, the author of &quot;Chernenko: The Last Bolshevik: The Soviet Union on the Eve of Perestroika&quot;, Kosygin &quot;began to lose power&quot; with the 24th Party Congress in 1971 which for the first time publicized the formula &#x27;the Politburo led by Brezhnev&#x27;&quot;. Along with weakening Kosygin&#x27;s position, Brezhnev moved to strengthen the Party&#x27;s hold on the Government apparatus, weakening Kosygin&#x27;s position further. Historian Robert Wesson, the author of &quot;Lenin&#x27;s Legacy: The Story of the CPSU&quot;, notes that Kosygin&#x27;s economic report to the 25th Party Congress &quot;pointed even more clearly to the end of struggle&quot; between Brezhnev and Kosygin. Kosygin was further pushed aside when Brezhnev published his memoirs, which stated that Brezhnev, not Kosygin, was in charge of all major economic decisions. To make matters worse for Kosygin, Brezhnev blocked any future talks on economic reform within the party and government apparatus, and information regarding the reform of 1965 was suppressed.

Brezhnev consolidated his own position over the Government Apparatus by strengthening Podgorny&#x27;s position as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, literally head of state, by giving the office some of the functions of the Premier. The 1977 Soviet Constitution strengthened Podgorny&#x27;s control of the Council of Ministers, by giving the post of head of state some executive powers. In fact, because of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Council of Ministers became subordinate to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. When Podgorny was replaced as head of state in 1977 by Brezhnev, Kosygin&#x27;s role in day-to-day management of government activities was lessened drastically, through Brezhnev&#x27;s new-found post. Rumours started circulating within the top circles, and on the streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health.

Brezhnev&#x27;s consolidation of power weakened Kosygin&#x27;s influence and prestige within the Politburo. Kosygin&#x27;s position was gradually weakened during the 1970s and he was frequently hospitalized. On several occasions Kiril Mazurov, the First Deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, had to act on his behalf. Kosygin suffered his first heart attack in 1976. After this incident, it is said that Kosygin changed from having a vibrant personality to being tired and fed up; he, according to people close to him, seemed to have lost the will to continue his work. He twice filed a letter of resignation between 1976 and 1980, but was turned down on both occasions. During Kosygin&#x27;s sick leave, Brezhnev appointed Nikolai Tikhonov to the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Tikhonov, as with Brezhnev, was a conservative, and through his post as First Deputy chairman Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a standby role. At a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, not Kosygin. The powers of the Premier diminished to the point where Kosygin was forced to discuss all decisions made by the Council of Ministers with Brezhnev.

== Death ==

Kosygin was hospitalized in October 1980; during his stay he wrote a brief letter of resignation; the following day he was deprived of all government protection, communication, and luxury goods he had earned during his political life. When Kosygin died on 18 December 1980 in Moscow, none of his Politburo colleagues, former aides, or security guards visited him. At the end of his life, Kosygin feared the complete failure of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985), saying that the sitting leadership was reluctant to reform the stagnant Soviet economy. His funeral was postponed for three days, as Kosygin died on the eve of Brezhnev&#x27;s birthday, and the day of Stalin&#x27;s. Kosygin was praised by Brezhnev as an individual who &quot;laboured selflessly for the good of the Soviet state&quot;. A state funeral was conducted and Kosygin was honoured by his peers; Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, and Tikhonov laid an urn containing his ashes at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

==Personality==
Compared with other Soviet officials, Kosygin stood out as a pragmatic and relatively independent leader. In a description given by an anonymous high-ranking GRU official, Kosygin is described as &quot;a lonely and somewhat tragic figure&quot; who &quot;understood our faults and the shortcomings of our situation in general and those in our Middle East policy in particular, but, being a highly restrained man, he preferred to be cautious.&quot; An anonymous former colleague of Kosygin said &quot;He always had an opinion of his own, and defended it. He was a very alert man, and performed brilliantly during negotiations. He was able to cope quickly with the material that was totally new to him. I have never seen people of that calibre since.&quot;

Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau said Kosygin was like &quot;Khrushchev without the rough edges, a fatherly man who was the forerunner of Mikhail Gorbachev&quot;. He noted that Kosygin was willing to discuss issues so long as the Soviet position was not tackled head-on. Former United States Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said that Kosygin was devoted, nearly fanatically, to his work. Kosygin was viewed by Western diplomats as a pragmatist &quot;with a glacial exterior who was orthodox if not rigid&quot;. Andrei Sakharov, a Soviet dissident, believed Kosygin to be &quot;the most intelligent and toughest man in the Politburo&quot;. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew remembered Kosygin as &quot;very quiet-spoken, but very determined, mind of great ability and application&quot;. US economist David Rockefeller described Kosygin as a talented manager doing miracles in ruling the clumsy Soviet economy.

===Historical assessments===
Kosygin would prove to be a very competent administrator, with the Soviet standard of living rising considerably due to his moderately reformist policy. Kosygin&#x27;s moderate 1965 reform, as with Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s thaw, radicalized the Soviet reform movement. While Leonid Brezhnev was content to maintain the centralized structure of the Soviet planned economy, Kosygin attempted to revitalize the ailing economic system by decentralising management. Following Brezhnev&#x27;s death in 1982, the reform movement was split between Yuri Andropov&#x27;s path of discipline and control and Gorbachev&#x27;s liberalization of all aspects of public life.

&quot;Chernenko: The Last Bolshevik: The Soviet Union on the Eve of Perestroika&quot; author Ilya Zemtsov describes Kosygin as &quot;determined and intelligent, an outstanding administrator&quot; and claims he distinguished himself from the other members of the Soviet leadership with his &quot;extraordinary capacity for work&quot;. Historians Moshe Lewin and Gregory Elliott, the authors of &quot;The Soviet Century&quot;, describe him as a &quot;phenomenal administrator&quot;. &quot;His strength&quot;, David Law writes, was &quot;his exceptional capability as an administrator&quot;. According to Law Kosygin proved himself to be a &quot;competent politician&quot; also. Historians Evan Mawdsley and Stephen White claim that Brezhnev was unable to remove Kosygin because his removal would mean the loss of his last &quot;capable administrator&quot;. In their book, &quot;The Unknown Stalin&quot;, Roy Medvedev and Zhores Medvedev called Kosygin an &quot;outstanding organizer&quot;, and the &quot;new Voznesensky&quot;. Historian Archie Brown, the author &quot;The Rise &amp; Fall of Communism&quot;, believes the 1965 Soviet economic reform to have been too &quot;modest&quot;, and claimed that Kosygin &quot;was too much a product of the Soviet ministerial system, as it evolved under Stalin, to become a radical economic reformer&quot;. However, Brown does believe that Kosygin was &quot;an able administrator&quot;. Gvishiani, a Russian historian, concluded that &quot;Kosygin survived both Stalin and Khrushchev, but did not manage to survive Brezhnev.&quot;

Kosygin was viewed with sympathy by the Soviet people, and is still presently viewed as an important figure in both Russian and Soviet history. Because of Kosygin&#x27;s popularity among the Soviet people, Brezhnev developed a &quot;strong jealousy&quot; for Kosygin, according to Nikolai Egorychev. Mikhail Smirtyukov, the former Executive Officer of the Council of Ministers, recalled that Kosygin refused to go drinking with Brezhnev, a move which annoyed Brezhnev gravely. Nikolai Ryzhkov, the last Chairman of the Council of Ministers, in a speech to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1987 referred to the &quot;sad experiences of the 1965 reform&quot;, and claimed that everything went from bad to worse following the reform&#x27;s cancellation.

==Honours==
During his lifetime, Kosygin received seven Orders and two Awards from the Soviet state. He was awarded two Hero of Socialist Labour (USSR); one being on his 60th birthday by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1964, on this occasion he was also awarded an Order of Lenin and a Hammer and Sickle Gold Medal. On 20 February 1974, to commemorate his 70th birthday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet awarded him another Order of Lenin and his second Hammer and Sickle Gold Medal. In total, Kosygin was awarded six Orders of Lenin by the Soviet state, and one Order of the October Revolution and one Order of the Red Banner of Labour. During a state visit to Peru in the 1970s with Leonid Brezhnev and Andrei Gromyko, all three were awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun by President Francisco Morales Bermúdez. The Moscow State Textile University was named in his honour in 1981, in 1982 a bust to honour Kosygin was placed in Leningrad, present day Saint Petersburg. In 2006 the Russian Government renamed a street after him.

<text>The Allegheny Plateau ( ) is a large dissected plateau area of the Appalachian Mountains in western and central New York, northern and western Pennsylvania, northern and western West Virginia, and eastern Ohio. It is divided into the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau and the glaciated Allegheny Plateau.

The plateau extends southward into western West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, and Tennessee, where it is instead called the Cumberland Plateau.

The plateau terminates in the east at the Allegheny Mountains, which are the highest ridges just west of the Allegheny Front. The Front extends from central Pennsylvania through Maryland and into eastern West Virginia.

The plateau is bordered on the west by glacial till plains in the north, generally north of the Ohio River, and the Bluegrass Region south of the Ohio River.

Elevations vary greatly. In the glaciated Allegheny Plateau, relief may only reach one hundred feet or less. In the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau in southeastern Ohio and westernmost West Virginia, relief is typically in the range of two hundred to four hundred feet. Absolute highest elevations in this area are often in the range of . By the Allegheny Front, however, elevations may reach well over , with relief of up to .

==Geology and physiography==
The Allegheny Plateau is a physiographic section of the larger Appalachian Plateau province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division.

<doc id="609248" wikidata="Q7332669" url="?curid=609248" title="Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians">
<text>The Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, also called the Ridge and Valley Province or the Valley and Ridge Appalachians, are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Highlands division. The physiographic province is divided into three sections: the Hudson Valley, the Central, and the Tennessee. 

The river valleys were areas of indigenous settlements for thousands of years. In the historic period, the Cherokee people had towns along many of the rivers in western South Carolina and North Carolina, as well as on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains in present-day Tennessee. Similarly, the Catawba people occupied areas along the upper Catawba River in Western North Carolina, to the east of Cherokee County.

The ridge and valley system presents an important obstacle to east–west land travel even with today&#x27;s technology. It was a nearly insurmountable barrier to European-American migrants who walked or rode horses traveling west to settle the Ohio Country, and later the Northwest Territory and Oregon Country. In the era when animal power dominated transportation, there was no safe way to cross east–west in the middle of the range; crossing was only possible nearer its extremes except for a few rough passages opened mid-range during the colonial era, including Cumberland Gap, Braddock&#x27;s Road, and Forbes Road. 

These were later improved as America&#x27;s first National Roads, including Wilderness Road, Cumberland Road, Lincoln Highway, designated as U.S. Route 40 and U.S. Route 30 in later years. Early settlers of Ohio Country tended to enter it via the Ohio River; river systems were the most important transportation corridors. It was difficult in the late 19th and 20th centuries to construct railroads and modern highways through this area.

==Geography==

The eastern head of the Ridge and Valley region is marked by the Great Appalachian Valley, which lies just west of the Blue Ridge. The western side of the Ridge and Valley region is marked by steep escarpments such as the Allegheny Front, the Cumberland Mountains, and Walden Ridge. The Valley and Ridge is located on the west side of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

The Province extends from southeastern New York in the north through northwestern New Jersey, westward into Pennsylvania through the Lehigh Valley, and southward into Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. They form a broad arc between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Appalachian Plateau physiographic province, which includes the Allegheny and Cumberland plateaus. They are characterized by long, even ridges, with long, continuous valleys in between. 

==Significant ridges (from north to south)==



==Geology==
The Valley and Ridge Province was formed during the Alleghanian orogeny, a mountain-building event that occurred between 325 and 260 million years ago. The rocks in the region were subjected to immense pressure and heat, causing them to deform and fold. The softer parts of these rock units (chiefly shale and limestone) were eroded to form the valleys and the harder parts of the folds (quartzites) formed the mountain tops and ridges. The ridges represent the edges of the erosion-resistant strata, and the valleys portray the absence of the more erodible strata. Smaller streams have developed their valleys following the lines of the more easily eroded strata.

A few major rivers, including the Delaware River, the Susquehanna River, the New River, and the Potomac River, are older than the present mountains, having cut water gaps that are perpendicular to hard strata ridges. The evidence points to a wearing down of the entire region to a low level with little relief, so that major rivers were flowing in unconsolidated sediments unaffected by the underlying rock structure. The region was then uplifted slowly enough so that the rivers could maintain their course, cutting through the ridges as they developed.

Valleys in the region are either synclinal or anticlinal.

These mountains are at their development in central Pennsylvania, a phenomenon termed the Pennsylvania climax.

==Biology==
* February 13
** Max Perutz publishes the structure of hemoglobin.
** John Kendrew publishes the structure of myoglobin.
* March 5 – British marine biologist Sir Alister Hardy announces his aquatic ape hypothesis, theorising that swimming and diving for food exerted a strong evolutionary effect partly responsible for the divergence in the common descent of humans and other great apes.
* April – Robin Hill and Fay Bendall publish the &#x27;Z scheme&#x27; of electron transport in photosynthesis.
* July – Robert Burns Woodward publishes a total synthesis of chlorophyll.

* November 4 – At the Kasakela Chimpanzee Community, Jane Goodall observes a chimpanzee using a grass stalk to extract termites from a termite hill, the first recorded case of tool use by animals.
* December 10 – The first underwater park within the United States, the John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, is formally dedicated; it covers and protects coral reefs, seagrass and mangroves inside its boundaries.
* Czech biochemist Emil Paleček discovers that nucleic acids can be studied through electrochemistry, contradicting previous assumptions that DNA molecules are too large to have electrochemical properties and allowing them to be used in the diagnosis of genetic disorders.
* Jacques Ruffié invents blood typing.
* Juan Oro finds that concentrated solutions of ammonium cyanide in water can produce the nucleotide adenine.
* Four independent researchers (Sam Weiss, Jerard Hurwitz, Audrey Stevens and J. Bonner) discover the bacterial RNA polymerase that regulates the polymerization of nucleotides under the control of DNA.
* Climatron geodesic dome greenhouse opens at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis.

==Computer science==
* August – Edsger W. Dijkstra and Jaap A. Zonneveld produce the first (X1) implementation of the ALGOL 60 programming language.
* John McCarthy of MIT publishes the Lisp programming language.

==Earth sciences==
* May 22 – Valdivia earthquake: Chile&#x27;s subduction fault ruptures from Talcahuano to the Taitao Peninsula (with its epicenter near Lumaco), causing the most powerful earthquake on record (with a magnitude of 9.5) and a tsunami.
* Harry Hammond Hess proposes the concept of seafloor spreading.

==Exploration==

* Wacław Sierpiński proves the existence of Sierpinski numbers.
* Stanko Bilinski rediscovers the Bilinski dodecahedron.
* In the classification of finite simple groups, Michio Suzuki and Rimhak Ree introduce Suzuki–Ree groups; and John G. Thompson, Walter Feit and Marshall Hall prove that a group with a fixed-point-free automorphism of prime order is nilpotent, and that all finite simple CN groups of odd order are cyclic.
* C. A. R. Hoare invents the quicksort algorithm.
* Irving S. Reed and Gustave Solomon present the Reed–Solomon error correction code.

==Medicine==

<text>Concert champêtre (, &quot;Pastoral Concerto&quot;), FP 49, is a harpsichord concerto by Francis Poulenc, which also exists in a version for piano solo with very slight changes in the solo part.

It was written in 1927–28 for the harpsichordist Wanda Landowska who said she &quot;adored&quot; playing it as it made her &quot;insouciant and gay!&quot; Landowska was responsible for the composition of several other new pieces of music for the instrument, notably Manuel de Falla&#x27;s harpsichord concerto and his &quot;El retablo de Maese Pedro&quot; (at the premiere of which, at the salon of Winnaretta Singer, Poulenc and Landowska met for the first time).

After a private performance in which Poulenc played the orchestral parts on the piano, the piece&#x27;s public premiere was on May 3, 1929 at the Salle Pleyel in Paris, with Landowska playing the solo part and the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris conducted by Pierre Monteux. The work is scored for an orchestra of two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, trombone, tuba, timpani, side drums (with and without snares), tambourine, triangle, bass drum, cymbals, xylophone, and strings (the usual two sections of violins, violas, cellos and double basses—Poulenc stipulates eight each of first and second violins, and four each of violas, cellos and basses).

The piece is in three movements:

#Allegro molto – Adagio – Allegro molto
#Andante: Mouvement de Sicilienne
#Finale: Presto très gai

The piece alludes to music of the Baroque period, when the harpsichord was a common instrument, both in terms of its melodic and harmonic language and in its structure. It is for this reason, as well as the plain influence of Stravinsky&#x27;s music of the same period, that the Concert and its slightly later companion work, the &quot;Aubade&quot; for piano and orchestra, are regarded as neoclassical compositions.

A typical performance of the &quot;Concert champêtre&quot; lasts around twenty-five minutes.

Like many harpsichord works from the 20th century, this piece was written for the &#x27;revival&#x27; Pleyel contemporary harpsichord, with metal frame, pedals, leather plectra and heavy touch, which was prevalent at the time, rather than historic instruments from the 17th and 18th century. However, Trevor Pinnock has played and recorded it on a 3-manual Hass instrument with disposition 16&#x27; 8&#x27; 8 &#x27; 4&#x27; 2&#x27;, lute, 2 buffs, 2 couplers.

A recording of Poulenc himself playing the work, but on the piano, with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos on 14 November 1948, was issued in 1998 as part of a 10-CD survey of historic broadcast recordings by that orchestra.

From 1838, the area formed part of the extensive pastoral run of Thomas Chirnside, that was developed further by a succession of owners until the 1920s. The original sub-division of Chirnside Park was, at that time, known as Mooroolbark Park. Around of mainly rich black basaltic soil was grazed and cultivated, watered from two perpetual springs.

In 1921, George Chirnside sold Werribee Park, moving the family&#x27;s stud herds and the contents of Werribee Park Mansion to Mooroolbark Park. George Chirnside died in 1941, and permission to sell the estate was given in 1950, being finalised some years later. Subdivision was approved in 1956 by the Shire of Lillydale, with the residential area centred on the two-storey stone homestead, country club and golf course, named Chirnside Park in 1962 in honour of Thomas Chirnside.

Amadeo DeVincentiis, an Italian from Abruzzo, also owned great swathes of what is now known as Chirnside Park. However, he sold the land for a paltry amount in the 1960s, from which the fortunate purchasers stood to make a hefty profit. DeVincentiis spent thousands attempting to rescind the sale, but failed.

Formerly West Lilydale, the surrounding region became known as Chirnside Park in the 1970s, the Post Office opening on 25 September 1979.

==Chirnside Park today==
Nominally a suburb of Melbourne, Chirnside Park is also a satellite community of Lilydale. Thus the services that cannot be met in the nearby shopping complex are found elsewhere. The residential area was originally structured around a large 18-hole golf course, although that has now been closed and a new estate known as Cloverlea has been built on the site, with dwellings on the north-eastern corner now completed. Further residential development has occurred to the west and north. Some new medical facilities have arrived recently, Chirnside Park Family Clinic being one of them.

Most of the suburb still retains a rural flavour, extending well into the Yarra Valley to the north, with commercial wineries, orchards and livestock farming, as well as large residential estates. The Heritage Golf and Country Club, designed by Jack Nicklaus, is situated in the north-west corner of the suburb, on the Yarra River. The Chirnside Park Shopping Centre is within the suburb.

<doc id="609275" wikidata="Q328940" url="?curid=609275" title="Eurico Guterres">
<text>Eurico Barros Gomes Guterres (born 4 July 1969) is a pro-Indonesian, anti-Timorese independence militiaman recruited by the Indonesian military during East Timor&#x27;s bid for independence between 1999 and 2000. He was involved in several massacres in East Timor, and was a chief militia leader during the post-independence massacres and destruction of the capital Dili.

Indonesia officially convicted and sentenced Guterres to ten years imprisonment in November 2002, for which he was incarcerated in 2006 until 2008. In August 2003 he formed &quot;Laskar Merah Putih&quot; (The Red and White Warriors) in Indonesian Papua.

Elsham leader Aloysius Renwarin reported Guterres had 200 members consisting of Indonesian expatriates from Maluku, Timor and Sulawesi in December 2003 when Guterres requested the local government to provide his organisation offices in Timika, Papua.

==Background==

Guterres was born in Uatulari (near Viqueque), East Timor. His parents were killed in 1976 by Indonesian TNI forces due to their known pro-Fretilin views. Guterres later accused Fretilin of their deaths, after his allegiance to Indonesia was established.

Young Guterres was brought up by an Indonesian civilian until he was sent to attend the Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic school in Becora, Dili. He left senior high school and became involved in petty crime, including involvement in a government-protected gambling hall at Tacitolu, Dili.

In 1988, Indonesian military intelligence detained him for his alleged involvement in a plot to assassinate President Suharto, who was to visit Dili in October. At this time, Guterres switched from being pro-independence to being pro-Indonesia. He became an informer for the Army&#x27;s Kopassus special forces and a double-agent against the independence movement, which expelled him around 1990.

A counter-insurgency officer, Prabowo Subianto, recruited Guterres into Gardapaksi in 1994, an organisation that gave cheap loans to start small businesses, but also used borrowers as informants and in pro-military vigilante squads. East Timor Governor José Abílio Osório Soares supported Gardapaksi, which developed a record of human rights abuse. 

In 1997, with a high school certificate supposedly provided by the military, he began attending the Economics Institute in Dili. Though the Sekolah Tinggi Ilmu Ekonomi (STIE) was run by pro-integrationist Filomeno Hornay, Guterres attended only three semesters. He is married to the niece of Bishop Nascimento of Baucau, and has three children.

He is the primary suspect in the Liquiçá Church Massacre of April 1999, according to information gathered by the UNTAET Crime Scene Detachment. He was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment in 2002 by a special court, and began serving his sentence in 2006. In 2008, he was released from prison following an appeal to the Supreme Court of Indonesia.

He was part of the National Mandate Party (Partai Amanat Nasional or PAN) between 2003 and 2004. He served as leader of PAN East Nusa Tenggara from 2005 to 2015. And then became PAN East Nusa Tenggara Counselor and PAN Central Leader Council. In October 2017, he resigned from PAN, as several of his friends had earlier quit the party.

<text>The is a Japanese short-necked wooden lute traditionally used in narrative storytelling. The is a plucked string instrument that first gained popularity in China before spreading throughout East Asia, eventually reaching Japan sometime during the Nara period (710–794). 

Typically to in length, the instrument is constructed of a water drop–shaped body with a short neck, typically with four (though sometimes five) strings. 

In Japan, the is generally played with a instead of the fingers, and is often used to play . One of the &#x27;s most famous uses is for reciting &quot;The Tale of the&quot;, from the Kamakura period (1185–1333). 

In previous centuries, the predominant musicians would have been , who used the as musical accompaniment when reading scriptural texts.

The &#x27;s Chinese predecessor was the (), which arrived in Japan in two forms; following its introduction to Japan, varieties of the quadrupled. Guilds supporting players, particularly the , helped proliferate musical development for hundreds of years. performances overlapped with performances by other players many years before , and continues to this day. This overlap resulted in a rapid evolution of the and its usage and made it one of the most popular instruments in Japan.

In spite of its popularity, the Ōnin War and subsequent Warring States Period disrupted teaching and decreased the number of proficient users. With the abolition of in the Meiji period, players lost their patronage.

By the late 1940s, the , a thoroughly Japanese tradition, was nearly completely abandoned for Western instruments. However, thanks to collaborative efforts by Japanese musicians, interest in the is being revived. Japanese and foreign musicians alike have begun embracing traditional Japanese instruments, particularly the , in their compositions. 

While blind singers no longer dominate the , many performers continue to use the instrument in traditional and modern ways.

==History==
The arrived in Japan in the 7th century, having evolved from the Chinese bent-neck (), while the itself was derived from similar instruments in West Asia. This type of , known as the , was later used in ensembles and became the most commonly known type. However, another variant of the – known as the or the – also found its way to Japan, first appearing in the Kyushu region. Though its origins are unclear, this thinner variant of the was used in ceremonies and religious rites.

The became known as an instrument commonly played at the Japanese Imperial court, where players, known as , found employment and patronage. However, following the collapse of the Ritsuryō state, employed at the court were faced with the court&#x27;s reconstruction and sought asylum in Buddhist temples. There, they assumed the role of Buddhist monks and encountered the . Seeing its relative convenience and portability, the monks combined these features with their large and heavy to create the , which, as indicated by its namesake, was used primarily for recitations of &quot;The Tale of the&quot; .

Through the next several centuries, players of both traditions intersected frequently and developed new music styles and new instruments. By the Kamakura period (1185–1333), the had emerged as a more popular instrument, a cross between both the and , retaining the rounded shape of the and played with a large plectrum like the . The , smaller than the , was used for similar purposes.

While the modern and both originated from the , the was used for moral and mental training by samurai of the Satsuma Domain during the Warring States period, and later for general performances. The was used by Buddhist monks visiting private residences to perform memorial services, not only for Buddhist rites, but also to accompany the telling of stories and news.

Though formerly popular, little was written about the performance and practice of the from roughly the 16th century to the mid-19th century. What is known is that three main streams of practice emerged during this time: (the lowest level of the state-controlled guild of blind players), (samurai style), and (urban style). These styles emphasized – vocalisation with accompaniment – and formed the foundation for styles of playing, such as and .

From these styles also emerged the two principal survivors of the tradition: and . From roughly the Meiji period (1868–1912) until the Pacific War, the and were popular across Japan, and, at the beginning of the Shōwa period (1925–1989), the was created and gained popularity. Of the remaining post-war traditions, only remains a style almost solely performed by blind persons. The is closely related to the and, similarly, relies on an oral narrative tradition focusing on wars and legends.

By the middle of the Meiji period, improvements had been made to the instruments and easily understandable songs were composed in quantity. In the beginning of the Taishō period (1912–1926), the was modified into the , which became popular among female players at the time. With this, the entered a period of popularity, with songs reflecting not just &quot;The Tale of the&quot; , but also the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, with songs such as , and &quot;Hill 203&quot; gaining popularity.

However, the playing of the nearly became extinct during the Meiji period following the introduction of Western music and instruments, until players such as Tsuruta Kinshi and others revitalized the genre with modern playing styles and collaborations with Western composers.
==Types==
There are more than seven types of , characterised by number of strings, sounds it could produce, the type of plectrum, and their use. As the does not play in tempered tuning, pitches are approximated to the nearest note.

===Classic ===
 
The , a large and heavy with four strings and four frets, is used exclusively for . It produces distinctive and . Its plectrum is small and thin, often rounded, and made from a hard material such as boxwood or ivory. It is not used to accompany singing. Like the , it is played held on its side, similar to a guitar, with the player sitting cross-legged. In , it is known as the .
The , a Tang variant of , can be seen in paintings of court orchestras and was used in the context of ; however, it was removed with the reforms and standardization made to the court orchestra during the late 10th century. It is assumed that the performance traditions died out by the 10th or 11th century (William P. Malm). This instrument also disappeared in the Chinese court orchestras. Recently, this instrument, much like the harp, has been revived for historically informed performances and historical reconstructions. Not to be confused with the five-stringed variants of modern , such as .
The , a with four strings, is used to play Buddhist mantras and songs. It is similar in shape to the , but with a much more narrow body. Its plectrum varies in both size and materials. The four fret type is tuned to E, B, E and A, and the five fret type is tuned to B, e, f and f. The six fret type is tuned to B, E, B and b.

===Middle and Edo ===
The , a with four strings and five frets, is used to play &quot;The Tale of the&quot; . Its plectrum is slightly larger than that of the , but the instrument itself is much smaller, comparable to a in size. It was originally used by traveling minstrels, and its small size lent it to indoor play and improved portability. Its tuning is A, c, e, a or A, c-sharp, e, a.
The , a with four strings and four frets, was popularized during the Edo period in Satsuma Province (present-day Kagoshima) by Shimazu Tadayoshi. Modern used for contemporary compositions often have five or more frets, and some have a doubled fourth string. The frets of the are raised from the neck allowing notes to be bent several steps higher, each one producing the instrument&#x27;s characteristic , or buzzing drone. Its boxwood plectrum is much wider than others, often reaching widths of or more. Its size and construction influences the sound of the instrument as the curved body is often struck percussively with the plectrum during play.

The is traditionally made from Japanese mulberry, although other hard woods such as Japanese zelkova are sometimes used in its construction. Due to the slow growth of the Japanese mulberry, the wood must be taken from a tree at least 120 years old and dried for 10 years before construction can begin.

The strings are made of wound silk. Its tuning is A, E, A, B, for traditional , G, G, c, g, or G, G, d, g for contemporary compositions, among other tunings, but these are only examples as the instrument is tuned to match the key of the player&#x27;s voice. The first and second strings are generally tuned to the same note, with the 4th (or doubled 4th) string is tuned one octave higher.

The most eminent 20th century performer was Tsuruta Kinshi, who developed her own version of the instrument, which she called the . This often has five strings (although it is essentially a 4-string instrument as the 5th string is a doubled 4th that are always played together) and five or more frets, and the construction of the tuning head and frets vary slightly. Ueda Junko and Tanaka Yukio, two of Tsuruta&#x27;s students, continue the tradition of the modern . Carlo Forlivesi&#x27;s compositions &quot;Boethius&quot; () and () were both written for performance on the designed by Tsuruta and Tanaka.

These works present a radical departure from the compositional languages usually employed for such an instrument. Also, thanks to the possibility of relying on a level of virtuosity never before attempted in this specific repertory, the composer has sought the renewal of the acoustic and aesthetic profile of the , bringing out the huge potential in the sound material: attacks and resonance, tempo (conceived not only in the chronometrical but also deliberately empathetical sense), chords, balance and dialogue (with the occasional use of two s in ), dynamics and colour.

===Modern ===

The , a with four strings and four frets or five strings and five frets, was popularised in the Meiji period by Tachibana Satosada. Most contemporary performers use the five string version. Its plectrum is much smaller than that of the , usually about in width, although its size, shape, and weight depends on the sex of the player. The plectrum is usually made from rosewood with boxwood or ivory tips for plucking the strings. The instrument itself also varies in size, depending on the player. Male players typically play that are slightly wider and/or longer than those used by women or children. The body of the instrument is never struck with the plectrum during play, and the five string instrument is played upright, while the four string is played held on its side. The instrument is tuned to match the key of the singer. An example tuning of the four string version is B, e, f and b, and the five string instrument can be tuned to C, G, C, d and g. For the five string version, the first and third strings are tuned the same note, the second string three steps down, the fifth string an octave higher than the second string, and the fourth string a step down from the fifth. So the previously mentioned tuning can be tuned down to B, F, B, c, d. Asahikai and Tachibanakai are the two major schools of . Popularly used by female players such as Uehara Mari.
The , a modern with five strings and five frets, was popularised by the 20th-century player and composer . Its plectrum is the same as that used for the . Its tuning is C, G, c, g, g.

==Styles of music==
The , considered one of Japan&#x27;s principal traditional instruments, has both influenced and been influenced by other traditional instruments and compositions throughout its long history; as such, a number of different musical styles played with the exist.

* : In , musical instruments usually serve as accompaniments to vocal performances, which dominate the musical style, with the overwhelming majority of compositions being vocal.
* : was usually patronized by the imperial court or the shrines and temples. ensembles were composed of string, wind, and percussion instruments, where string and wind instruments were more respected and percussion instruments were considered lesser instruments. Among the string instruments, the seems to have been the most important instrument in orchestral performances.
* : While was not used in , the style of singing is closely tied to , especially and style singing. Both and are rooted in Buddhist rituals and traditions. Before arriving in Japan, was used in Indian Buddhism. The was also rooted in Indian Buddhism, and the , as a predecessor to the , was the principal instrument of the , who were blind Buddhist priests.

=== construction and tuning===
Generally speaking, have four strings, though modern and may have five strings. The strings on a range in thickness, with the first string being thickest and the fourth string being thinnest; on , the second string is the thickest, with the fourth and fifth strings being the same thickness on and . The varying string thickness creates different timbres when stroked from different directions.

In , tuning is not fixed. General tones and pitches can fluctuate up or down entire steps or microtones. When singing in a chorus, singers often stagger their entry and often sing through non-synchronized, heterophony accompaniment. In solo performances, a performer sings monophonically, with melismatic emphasis throughout the performance. These monophonic do not follow a set harmony. Instead, singers tend to sing with a flexible pitch without distinguishing soprano, alto, tenor, or bass roles. This singing style is complemented by the , which players use to produce short glissandi throughout the performance. The style of singing accompanying tends to be nasal, particularly when singing vowels, the consonant , and syllables beginning with &quot;g&quot;, such as and . performers also vary the volume of their voice between barely audible to very loud. Since pieces were generally performed for small groups, singers did not need to project their voices as opera singers did in Western music tradition.

 music is based on a pentatonic scale (sometimes referred to as a five-tone or five-note scale), meaning that each octave contains five notes. This scale sometimes includes supplementary notes, but the core remains pentatonic. The rhythm in performances allows for a broad flexibility of pulse. Songs are not always metered, although more modern collaborations are metered. Notes played on the usually begin slow and thin and progress through gradual accelerations, increasing and decreasing tempo throughout the performance. The texture of singing is often described as &quot;sparse&quot;.

The plectrum also contributes to the texture of music. Different sized plectrums produced different textures; for example, the plectrum used on a was much larger than that used on a , producing a harsher, more vigorous sound. The plectrum is also critical to creating the sound, which is particularly utilized with . What the plectrum is made of also changes the texture, with ivory and plastic plectrums creating a more resilient texture to the wooden plectrum&#x27;s twangy hum.

==Use in modern music==
 usage in Japan has declined greatly since the Heian period. Outside influence, internal pressures, and socio-political turmoil redefined patronage and the image of the ; for example, the Ōnin War of the Muromachi period (1338–1573) and the subsequent Warring States period (15th–17th centuries) disrupted the cycle of tutelage for performers. As a result, younger musicians turned to other instruments and interest in music decreased. Even the transitioned to other instruments such as the (a three-stringed lute).

Interest in the was revived during the Edo period (1600–1868), when Tokugawa Ieyasu unified Japan and established the Tokugawa shogunate. Ieyasu favored music and became a major patron, helping to strengthen guilds (called ) by financing them and allowing them special privileges. players and other musicians found it financially beneficial to switch to the , bringing new styles of music with them. The Edo period proved to be one of the most prolific and artistically creative periods for the in its long history in Japan.

In 1868, the Tokugawa shogunate collapsed, giving way to the Meiji period and the Meiji Restoration, during which the samurai class was abolished, and the lost their patronage. players no longer enjoyed special privileges and were forced to support themselves. At the beginning of the Meiji period, it was estimated that there were at least one hundred traditional court musicians in Tokyo; however, by the 1930s, this number had reduced to just 46 in Tokyo, and a quarter of these musicians later died in World War II. Life in post-war Japan was difficult, and many musicians abandoned their music in favor of more sustainable livelihoods.

While many styles of flourished in the early 1900s (such as between 1900 and the 1930s), the cycle of tutelage was broken yet again by the war. In the present day, there are no direct means of studying the in many traditions. Even players, who were quite popular in the early 20th century, may no longer have a direct means of studying oral composition, as the bearers of the tradition have either died or are no longer able to play. still retains a significant number of professional and amateur practitioners, but the , , and styles have all but died out.

As music declined in post-Pacific War Japan, many Japanese composers and musicians found ways to revitalize interest in it. They recognized that studies in music theory and music composition in Japan almost entirely consisted in Western theory and instruction. Beginning in the late 1960s, these musicians and composers began to incorporate Japanese music and Japanese instruments into their compositions; for example, one composer, Tōru Takemitsu, collaborated with Western composers and compositions to include the distinctly Asian . His well-received compositions, such as November Steps, which incorporated with Western orchestral performance, revitalized interest in the and sparked a series of collaborative efforts by other musician in genres ranging from J-Pop and to and .

Other musicians, such as Yamashika Yoshiyuki, considered by most ethnomusicologists to be the last of the , preserved scores of songs that were almost lost forever. Yamashika, born in the late Meiji period, continued the tradition until his death in 1996. Beginning in the late 1960s to the late 1980s, composers and historians from all over the world visited Yamashika and recorded many of his songs; before this time, the tradition had been a completely oral tradition. When Yamashika died in 1996, the era of the tutelage died with him, but the music and genius of that era continues thanks to his recordings.

<text>Coldstream is a town in Shire of Yarra Ranges, Victoria, Australia, located in Greater Melbourne beyond the Melbourne metropolitan area Urban Growth Boundary. Coldstream is located 36 km north-east from Melbourne&#x27;s central business district. Coldstream recorded a population of 2,199 at the 2021 census.

==History==

The township developed around the railway station after the railway arrived in 1888, the Post Office opening on 7 February 1889. Prior to that the locality was known as &quot;The Lodge&quot;.

In 1909, Dame Nellie Melba bought Coombe Cottage at Coldstream. The house is located at the junction of Maroondah Highway and Melba Highway (named in her honour). It became the home of Melba&#x27;s granddaughter, Lady Pamela Vestey, until her death in 2011. It is now the property of Lady Vestey&#x27;s son, Sam (3rd Baron Vestey), who resides in the United Kingdom.

==Today==
Coldstream has a local primary school, community centre, landfill and several farms. The Coldstream Timber and Hardware company have premises on Maroondah Highway. Coldstream is also home to the Coldstream Brewery, which opened in June 2007 and has its restaurant open 7 days a week. It had a railway station that closed to passengers in 1983, but was used for freight purposes up until 1992 when it closed after the buildings were destroyed by fire.

Coldstream Airport is owned by the Doake Family and has been in operation since the early 1960s. 
It is home to:—
* a flying school currently operated by Yarra Valley Flight Training,
* An aero club, the Coldstream Flyers Club, and
* Many private aircraft.

Coldstream has an active CFA (Country Fire Authority) volunteer fire brigade established after the serious fires of 1962. This was essentially a name change from the Lilydale Rural Fire Brigade originally established in 1939 as the Lilydale Bushfire Brigade, changing its name in 1945 on the establishment of the CFA (Country Fire Authority).

On clear winter mornings Coldstream is one of the coldest places around Melbourne, with the temperature dropping below 0 °C (32 °F) on several mornings each year (it very rarely drops below 2 °C in the centre of Melbourne). Overall, the daily minimum temperatures are even lower than nearby Mount Dandenong despite being much closer to sea level.

The Bureau of Meteorology operates an automatic weather station at Coldstream Airfield. A private automatic weather station is also maintained in the Coldstream Estate.

The Domaine Chandon Australia winery, sister to Domaine Chandon California, a division of Moët &amp; Chandon, is located there.

==Population==
In the 2016 Census, there were 2,164 people in Coldstream. 83.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 4.9%. 91.4% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 42.5%, Catholic 20.5% and Anglican 12.1%.

==Climate==
Coldstream has an oceanic climate that is transitional with the warmer interior climates, resulting in higher summer daytime temps than on the Victorian coastline. Averages even out due to lower overnight lows, where Coldstream can get close to freezing even in the midst of summer. Precipitation is relatively uniform throughout the year, although summers are slightly drier than winters.

==Sport==
The town has an Australian Rules football team, The Coldstream Cougars, competing in the Eastern Football League.

Coldstream also has Netball club.

<doc id="609283" wikidata="Q2515622" url="?curid=609283" title="Constitutionality">
<text>In constitutional law, constitutionality is said to be the condition of acting in accordance with an applicable constitution; the status of a law, a procedure, or an act&#x27;s accordance with the laws or set forth in the applicable constitution. When laws, procedures, or acts directly violate the constitution, they are unconstitutional. All others are considered constitutional unless the country in question has a mechanism for challenging laws as unconstitutional.

== Applicability ==
An act or statute enacted as law either by a national legislature or by a subordinate-level legislature such as that of a state or province may be declared unconstitutional.

However, governments do not only create laws but also enforce the laws set forth in the document defining the government, which is the constitution. 

When the proper court determines that a legislative act or law conflicts with the constitution, it finds that law unconstitutional and declares it void in whole or in part. 

Depending on the type of legal system, a statute may be declared unconstitutional by any court or only by special constitutional courts with authority to rule on the validity of a statute.

In some countries, the legislature may create any law for any purpose, and there is no provision for courts to declare a law unconstitutional. That can occur either because the country has no codified constitution that laws must conform to like in the United Kingdom and New Zealand or because the constitution is codified, but no court has the authority to strike down laws on the basis of it like in the Netherlands and Switzerland.

In many jurisdictions, the supreme court or constitutional court is the final legal arbiter that renders an opinion on whether a law or an action of a government official is constitutional. Constitutions define the powers of government, Thus, national constitutions typically apply only to government actions. Only governments can then violate the nation&#x27;s constitution, but there are exceptions.

== Examples of unconstitutional actions ==
Unconstitutional actions include:

* Actions by politicians outside the powers of their constitutionally-established offices
* Actions on behalf of the government that prevent an individual from exercising constitutionally-protected individual rights

==See also==
* Constitutional law
* Judicial review
* Unconstitutional constitutional amendment

<doc id="609289" wikidata="Q3686129" url="?curid=609289" title="Harpsichord concerto">
<text>A harpsichord concerto is a piece of music for an orchestra with the harpsichord in a solo role (though for another sense, see below). Sometimes these works are played on the modern piano (see &quot;piano concerto&quot;). For a period in the late 18th century, Joseph Haydn and Thomas Arne wrote concertos that could be played interchangeably on harpsichord, fortepiano, and (in some cases) pipe organ.

== The Baroque harpsichord concerto ==
The harpsichord was a common instrument in the 1730s, but never as popular as string or wind instruments in the concerto role in the orchestra, probably due to its relative lack of volume in an orchestral setting. In this context, harpsichords were more usually employed as a continuo instrument, playing a harmonised bass part in nearly all orchestral music, the player often also directing the orchestra.

Bach&#x27;s Brandenburg Concerto No.5 in D major, BWV 1050, may be the first work in which the harpsichord appears as a concerto soloist. In this piece, its usual continuo role is alternated with prominent solo &quot;obbligato&quot; episodes in all three movements. In the first movement the harpsichord, after rapid scales up and down the length of its range, embarks on a solo cadenza which lasts for 3–4 minutes, while the orchestra is silent.

== The concerto for solo harpsichord ==

It was also popular in the Baroque era to adapt Italian concertos for other instruments (such as violin and orchestra) for solo harpsichord (or organ)—which Bach did with many of Vivaldi&#x27;s concertos. The concerto transcriptions Bach made for harpsichord are listed as BWV 972–987. Bach&#x27;s Italian concerto BWV 971 is in this transcription style, though it was written as an original piece for harpsichord. by Christian Petzold was published in 1729. In 1738 published a similar concerto in G minor.

Bach also composed a concerto for two harpsichords without orchestral accompaniment, BWV 1061a, which is the early version of the concerto for two harpsichords and string orchestra, BWV 1061.

== The new harpsichord concerto ==

With the harpsichord revival in the 20th century, harpsichordists commissioned new pieces for the new &#x27;revival&#x27; instrument: Wanda Landowska commissioned concerti from Francis Poulenc and Manuel de Falla. Though the &#x27;revival instruments&#x27; have now fallen out of favour, concerti continue to be written for harpsichord, though are now more likely to be played on a copy of a historical instrument, perhaps with a small orchestra or some amplification to ensure it can be well heard.

<doc id="609292" wikidata="Q4357583" url="?curid=609292" title="Ralph Terry">
<text>Ralph Willard Terry (January 9, 1936 – March 16, 2022) was an American baseball player who played as a right-handed starting pitcher for twelve seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the New York Yankees, Kansas City Athletics, Cleveland Indians, and New York Mets from 1956 to 1967. He was a member of the Yankees pitching rotation on five consecutive league champions from 1960 to 1964, enjoying his best season in 1962 when he was named to his only All-Star team, going on to lead the American League with 23 victories. In the 1962 World Series he was named the Most Valuable Player after posting wins in two of the last three games, including a 1–0 shutout in the decisive game seven. He is also notable for surrendering a walk-off home run to Bill Mazeroski that won the 1960 World Series for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Terry also played for the Kansas City Athletics, Cleveland Indians, and New York Mets. He later enjoyed a successful career as a professional golfer.

==Early life==
Terry was born in Big Cabin, Oklahoma, on January 9, 1936. His father, Frank William, was employed as an attendant at Eastern Oklahoma Hospital and served in the US Navy during World War II; his mother was Laleta (Adams). Terry attended Chelsea High School in nearby Chelsea, where he played gridiron and basketball. He graduated as salutatorian of his class in 1953. He then studied at Missouri State University and the University of Kansas City. He was signed as an amateur free agent by the New York Yankees on November 19, 1953.

==Baseball career==
===Independence Indians (1953)===
Terry played for the Independence Indians in the Ban Johnson League in 1953. The home field for the Independence Indians was Shulthis Stadium in Independence, Kansas. The stadium is the same venue in which Mickey Mantle started his career with the Independence Yankees in 1949.

===New York Yankees (1956–1957)===
Terry played two seasons in the minor leagues from 1954 to 1956. He made his MLB debut on August 6, 1956, at the age of 20, pitching innings, striking out four, and being the winning pitcher in a 4–3 win over the Boston Red Sox. He ultimately posted a 1–2 win–loss record and a 9.45 earned run average (ERA) in three starts in his first MLB season. The following year, he appeared in seven games, making two starts, before being traded to the Kansas City Athletics on June 15.

===Kansas City Athletics (1957–1959)===
Terry finished the 1957 season with a 4–11 record and 3.38 ERA in 19 starts for the Athletics. He rebounded somewhat the next season, going 11–13 with a 4.24 ERA and 134 strikeouts (setting a new career high) in 40 games, including 33 starts. In 1959, he started 2–4 with a 5.24 earned run average (ERA) in 9 games. On May 26 of that year, he was traded to the New York Yankees along with Hector Lopez.

===Return to New York and stardom (1959–1964)===

Upon his return, Terry went 3–7 with a 3.39 ERA in 24 games, including 16 starts. His career began to take off in 1960, when he posted a 10–8 record and 3.40 ERA. That year, he made his first postseason appearance, in two games of the 1960 World Series. He was 0–2 with a 5.40 ERA in the two games, one start and one relief appearance, and gave up Bill Mazeroski&#x27;s walk-off home run in Game 7.

In 1961, Terry posted a 16–3 record with a 3.15 ERA in 31 games (27 starts). During the 1961 World Series, he was 0–1 with a 4.82 ERA in two starts, but won his first championship when the Yankees defeated the Cincinnati Reds in five games.

For 1962, Terry went 23–12 with a 3.19 ERA. That year, he posted career bests with 23 wins, 39 starts, innings pitched, and 176 strikeouts against 57 walks. His 23 victories led the American League. In the 1962 World Series, he went 2–1 with a 1.80 ERA and 16 strikeouts in 25 innings over three games against the San Francisco Giants. His performance earned him the World Series MVP award that season.

The next year, Terry was 17–15 with a 3.22 ERA in 37 games, including a career-high 18 complete games. He pitched three innings in the 1963 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, finishing with a 3.00 ERA, as the Yankees were swept in four games.

In 1964, Terry went 7–11 with a 4.54 ERA. In the World Series that year against the Cardinals, he gave up two hits and struck out three batters in a Yankees loss.

=== Later career (1965–1967)===
Shortly after the 1964 World Series, Terry was sent to the Cleveland Indians as a player to be named later in an earlier trade for Pedro Ramos; Bud Daley was later sent to the Indians in November to complete the trade.
In 1965, his only season in Cleveland, Terry posted an 11–6 mark with a 3.69 ERA in 30 games, (26 starts).

On April 6, 1966 he was traded for John O&#x27;Donoghue and cash to the Kansas City Athletics. He started 15 games for the Athletics, for whom he went 1–5 with a 3.80 ERA. On August 6, his contract was purchased by the New York Mets. He went 0–1 with a 4.74 ERA in 11 games, six as a reliever, for the rest of the 1966 season.

In 1967, Terry pitched in just two games, and finished one, before being released by the Mets on May 16. He subsequently retired.

In his career, Terry had 257 games started, 20 shutouts, 11 saves, 446 walks, and 1,000 strikeouts in innings pitched.

In five World Series (1960–64), Terry posted a record of 2–3, 31 strikeouts and a 2.93 ERA in nine appearances and 46 innings pitched. Both wins came in the 1962 World Series against the Giants, including a 1–0 shutout in Game 7 over Giants ace Jack Sanford. That game – and thus the Series – ended with Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson catching Willie McCovey&#x27;s line drive.

==Later life==
After baseball, Terry became a professional golfer. He won the 1980 Midwest PGA Championship, and based on his status as a PGA of America sectional champion, he qualified for and played in four PGA Tour events in 1981 and 1982. In 1986, he started playing on the Senior PGA Tour. His best finish was a tie for 10th at the 1989 Showdown Classic. He appeared at several Yankees Old-Timers&#x27; Days, most recently in 2017.

Terry lived in Larned, Kansas, where he was in the insurance business for a number of years. In his retirement, he continued to play golf as a hobby. He died March 16, 2022, at a long-term care facility in Larned. He was 86, and suffered a head injury after slipping on ice on the morning of New Year&#x27;s Eve 2021.

<doc id="609294" wikidata="Q1970043" url="?curid=609294" title="Port Charles">
<text>Port Charles (commonly abbreviated as PC) is an American television soap opera that aired on ABC from June 1, 1997, to October 3, 2003. It was a spin-off of the series &quot;General Hospital&quot;, which has been running since 1963 and takes place in the fictional city of Port Charles, New York. The show features longtime &quot;General Hospital&quot; characters Lucy Coe, Kevin Collins, Scott Baldwin, and Karen Wexler, along with several new characters, most of whom were interns in a competitive medical school program. In its later years, the program shifted more towards supernatural themes and stories, with a reduced emphasis on the original hospital setting.

==History==
===1997–2000===
Plans to spin off &quot;General Hospital&quot; were announced in December 1996. ABC had previously passed on the idea of a &quot;GH&quot; spin-off proposed by former head writer, Claire Labine. Tentatively titled &quot;GH2&quot;, the series was set to revolve around interns at the medical school across from General Hospital. &quot;General Hospital&quot; executive producer Wendy Riche was hired to fill the same role for the new series, and partnered with married soap opera writers Carolyn and Richard Culliton—the latter of whom Riche had hired as co-head writer of &quot;General Hospital&quot; in September 1996—to co-develop the concept. (The Cullitons served as head writers of &quot;Port Charles&quot; from its debut until November 1997; Richard would subsequently be appointed head writer of the NBC soap &quot;Another World&quot;, where Carolyn had previously served and would rejoin as a staff writer.) Riche said of the new show, &quot;This will be a multigenerational show, which is the kind of drama we&#x27;ve always done at &quot;GH&quot;&quot;. It was later announced that the series would be titled &quot;Port Charles&quot;, after the fictional city the series are set, and would star Jon Lindstrom and Lynn Herring, playing their roles from &quot;GH&quot;.

The series premiered with a two-hour prime time special, that aired on June 1, 1997. It started in its regular 12:30 p.m. Eastern timeslot the following day, replacing &quot;The City&quot;, a continuation of the previously cancelled &quot;Loving&quot; that ended its 17-month run on March 28. (Edited 30-minute classic episodes of &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, and &quot;General Hospital&quot; had filled the timeslot in the interim from March 31 to May 29.) The series also featured the return of &quot;General Hospital&quot; characters Scott Baldwin (Kin Shriner), and Karen Wexler (Jennifer Hammon). After the series premiered, it was unclear if Lindstrom, Herring, and Shriner would remain with the series. It was later confirmed the actors would stay on the show.

Riche later recalled the creation process by saying, &quot;We knew that &quot;The City&quot; was probably not going to last. I was having lunch with Pat [Fili-Krushel] at some event. We were talking about &quot;The City&quot; and what to do with that timeslot. I said, &#x27;If I were a programmer, I would start the ABC lineup with a half hour of the west wing of General Hospital with the interns in a learning hospital, and cap the day off with &quot;General Hospital&quot;. I would interface the characters in Port Charles with both wings of General Hospital.&#x27; Pat thought that was a great idea. She thought about it for a few hours, ran it by upper management, and told me to write it up. I sat down, wrote down some characters and storylines, sent her back some pages, and created the show. That was a natural bridge as a programmer. I had worked as a programmer at ABC and FOX so my head also thinks in those terms. We wanted to bring continuity to the show, which was Lucy, Kevin, and Scotty.&quot;

In the first episode, tenured nurse Audrey Hardy (&quot;General Hospital&quot;&#x27;s longest-running character, portrayed by Rachel Ames) was injured and an intern had to operate on her with a power drill to save her life. Despite low ratings, &quot;Port Charles&quot; celebrated its first anniversary on June 1, 1998, as the series slowly continued to establish its own audience and improve in its time slot.

In its first few years, &quot;Port Charles&quot; developed a reputation for focusing most of its energies on the medical school program, setting more of its main action at Port Charles&#x27; General Hospital than was seen on the parent show, &quot;General Hospital&quot;. As it evolved, it turned its focus to stories with gothic intrigue that included themes such as forbidden love, vampires, and life after death (somewhat similar to the earlier series &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, which also aired on ABC in the late 1960s and early 1970s).

In December 1999, Julie Hanan Carruthers was promoted to executive producer after Wendy Riche decided to step down from day-to-day oversight of the show to focus on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Carruthers was the senior supervising producer of &quot;Port Charles&quot;, while serving the same role on &quot;General Hospital&quot; at the spin-off&#x27;s inception.

===2000–2003===
In December 2000, it was announced that &quot;Port Charles&quot; would abandon the traditional open-ended style of storytelling in favor of 13-week story arcs similar to Latin telenovelas. Each arc is referred to as a &quot;book&quot;, and has its own plot line. The approach was designed to attract more younger viewers, with shorter format being easier for many viewers to keep up with. ABC&#x27;s head of daytime, Angela Shapiro said of format change, &quot;It&#x27;s not about the destination, it&#x27;s about the journey, still, we need to come up with [quicker] stories that have a beginning, middle, and end.&quot; The new production model allowed the cast, crew, and writing staff to only work six months out of the year.

====Cancellation====
On June 27, 2003, &quot;Port Charles&quot; was cancelled by ABC after six years due to low ratings and financial concerns. The final episode aired on October 3, 2003. Brian Frons said of the decision to cancel the relatively young series, &quot;This was an extremely difficult decision, we were very pleased with the creative execution of the show, but the 30 minute format in this time period posed significant financial challenges, which ultimately led to this decision.&quot; Since the program taped for only six months out of the year, the remaining episodes were aired with the cast not allowed to return to tape resolutions to storylines. This left the final episode as a cliffhanger; Caleb told Olivia that Alison (Erin Hershey Presley) was pregnant with his baby because of the wish that she (Olivia) made on his ring and it was revealed that Imani was a werewolf. ABC returned the 12:30 p.m. time slot to its affiliates after &quot;Port Charles&quot; ended its run.

After &quot;Port Charles,&quot; the characters of Scott Baldwin and Audrey Hardy returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and many of the other actors from &quot;Port Charles&quot; moved on to play roles on other dramas, including a few who took on new roles on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, such as actors Kelly Monaco, Kiko Ellsworth, Eddie Matos, Kent King, and Jay Pickett.

====Post-cancellation aftermath====
The cancellation of &quot;Port Charles&quot;, along with ABC&#x27;s relinquishing of what was historically a death slot at the time of the show&#x27;s ending, resulted in a major impact on the first-run syndication market as ABC affiliates sought new programming to fill the open timeslot in the midst of the 2003–04 television season. The most significant impact occurred in the New York television market, where the cancellation created an opening on network flagship station WABC-TV. Taking advantage of this opening, syndication distributor Buena Vista Television reached an agreement to move &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; (which had been canceled by ABC one year earlier) over to WABC&#x27;s open 12:30 p.m. slot from WCBS-TV, which had been airing the program in the 4:00 p.m. timeslot since it premiered in first-run syndication in September 2002. This situation arose after WCBS picked up syndication rights to &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; for the 2003–04 season when WNBC, which had aired the program since it was revived in 1997, dropped it from its lineup. &quot;Millionaire&quot; continued to air in that time slot until September 2014, when it was moved to 2:00 p.m. (where it would remain until its withdrawal from syndication in 2019, apart from the 2015–16 season) in order to accommodate an extension of the station&#x27;s noon newscast as a result of the cancellation of &quot;Katie&quot;. The second syndicated season of &quot;Millionaire&quot; premiered before &quot;Port Charles&quot; aired its last episode; as a result, some affiliates did not air the soap in its normal timeslot during its last few weeks.

In 2013, the writers of &quot;General Hospital&quot; revisited the final storyline of &quot;Port Charles&quot; after actors Michael Easton and Lynn Herring joined the show, putting their own spin on the &quot;PC&quot; storyline. Easton was now playing John McBain, a role he originated on the cancelled &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, while Herring would reprise her role as Lucy Coe. To work with the previous &quot;PC&quot; storyline, Easton started a dual role, playing both John and Caleb onscreen. At the conclusion of the story arc, it appeared the Caleb character had died; however, in the morgue after Lucy Coe left convinced he was dead, the true Caleb switched bodies with the Medical Examiner and walked out of the morgue.

==Cast of characters==
Popular characters such as Lucy Coe, Kevin Collins, and Scott Baldwin moved from &quot;General Hospital&quot; to &quot;Port Charles&quot; at the start of the series. New characters were introduced as doctors and interns at the local medical school. These interns included brothers Joe (Michael Dietz) and Frank Scanlon (Jay Pickett), wheelchair user Matt Harmon (Mitch Longley), Julie Morris-Devlin (Lisa Ann Hadley), Eve Lambert (Julie Pinson), Karen Wexler (Jennifer Hammon), Chris Ramsey (Nolan North), Jake Marshak (Rib Hillis). Debbi Morgan portrayed the resident in charge of the new interns, Dr. Ellen Burgess. Morgan was widely known for her portrayal of Angie Hubbard on &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;Loving&quot;, and &quot;The City&quot;. The actress described her character, which was seen as a departure for Morgan, whose Angie was known as a generally nice character, by saying &quot;She&#x27;s everything I abhor in doctors-their abruptness, the lack of that so many of them have. She&#x27;s a talented doctor and brilliant at what she does. Her bedside manner just sucks!&quot;.

As the series progressed, the storylines became less centered around the interns, and as a result, many actors ended up leaving the series. &quot;Port Charles&quot; then started to introduce new, younger characters as a part of the supernatural storylines. These characters proved to be popular with fans and critics, mainly Alison Barrington (Erin Hershey Presley), Caleb Morley (Michael Easton), Livvie Locke (Kelly Monaco), and Rafe Kovich (Brian Gaskill).

When the series ended in 2003, Shriner returned to &quot;General Hospital,&quot; while Herring was not offered a place back on the show. The actress stated, &quot;That was very disheartening. It never occurred to me that Lucy wouldn&#x27;t still have a place in town if &quot;PC&quot; didn&#x27;t work out. But you know what? Even knowing what I know now, I would still go off to do PC. I would not trade that fabulous experience for anything!&quot; Several of the younger actors took roles on different shows, including Easton, who was cast as John McBain on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Monaco transferred over to &quot;General Hospital&quot;, but in the newly created role of Sam McCall. It was said that the supernatural elements of the storyline would have made it difficult for the writers to integrate Livvie into the series.

==Story arcs==

Each 13-week arc of the story was referred to as a &quot;book&quot;. There were a total of twelve books after the series switched to that format. In order, they were:

==Crews==
===Head writers===
===Executive producers===
==Reception==
The series received mostly positive reviews from critics. In a review of the early months, &quot;The Tuscaloosa News&quot; compared the series favorably to &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;But all in all, this was quite an auspicious start for a new show. When &quot;Port Charles&quot; was conceived, this spin off was a companion piece to the highly successful &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Since then, &quot;General Hospital&quot; has lost not only its headwriter, but its direction.&quot; During the early days, many critics felt the series wouldn&#x27;t make it, but it later proved to be a critical success. The series received particular acclaim during the vampire storylines. The &quot;Star-News&quot; wrote in a review of the &quot;Tainted Love&quot; arc, &quot;Its well-placed edginess always underscores the danger. It was riveting. So was this story. We did not want it to end.&quot; The fast-paced style of storytelling has also been called &quot;Edgy, unpredictable and extreme.&quot; &quot;The Vindicator&quot; described the change in the series by saying, &quot;The series clipped along at an amazing pace and viewers became intrigued as more fantasy elements such as time travel and vampires were added to the mix. The show became the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; of its time, and although the ratings were low, it continued to grow.&quot; &quot;ABC Soaps in Depth&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Greatest Daytime Couples&quot; included Rafe and Alison at number 92, and Caleb and Livvie at number 34.

In 2003, the series was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series.Zap2it included the series on its list of &quot;The Best and Worst TV Spinoffs since 1990&quot;, noting, &quot;&quot;Port Charles&quot; never got the traction that its venerable parent show did, despite attempts to introduce the supernatural and a change in production to tell more contained story arcs. It lasted six years, and after its cancellation a few characters eventually returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot;.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; included the series on their list of &quot;15 Soap Operas We&#x27;ve Loved, Lost&quot;, noting, &quot;What started off as a simple spin-off of &quot;General Hospital&quot; ended up venturing way out there, with vampires and werewolves stalking around Port Charles. Having &quot;GH&quot; folks like Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring) and Scotty Baldwin (Kin Shriner) leading the show made for an instant audience base. Some viewers couldn&#x27;t get behind all the supernatural happenings (a vampire/human baby conceived by a wish upon a ring?), but hey, we got Kelly Monaco out of the deal.&quot;

<doc id="609296" wikidata="Q7086922" url="?curid=609296" title="Olinda, Victoria">
<text>Olinda ( ) is a town within the Dandenong Ranges in central-south Victoria, Australia, located east of Melbourne&#x27;s CBD, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Olinda recorded a population of 1,773 at the 2021 census.

It is a popular weekend destination for tourists, with a variety of restaurants and cafes. The town is home to the Dandenong Ranges Botanic Garden and R.J. Hamer Arboretum.

==History==
Olinda is named after Olinda Creek, which begins in the township. The creek was named in 1858 after Alice Olinda Hodgkinson, the daughter of Clement Hodgkinson, Victoria&#x27;s acting Surveyor General. The town was initially a logging settlement, however as land was made available for horticulture in the early 1900s, the town began to grow substantially. The Post Office opened on 21 August 1901. Berry farming, dairying, and flower growing became prosperous industries, and tourism soon flourished as the principal industry of Olinda.

In 1919 the Australian artist Sir Arthur Streeton returned to Australia and built a house on the property called Longacres, in Olinda. Guesthouses and weekend homes became a common staple for the area, allowing for the township to enter a prosperous period of guest house tourism. The popularity of guesthouses and weekend cottages in the town lasted until World War II. After which, the rise of motor vehicle transportation saw a decline in weekend trips, and a rise in day trips by motor vehicle. In 1966 the Ashendene Boys Home was located in Olinda, until its closure in 1988.
In 1952 Olinda hosted the Olinda Film Festival (also called the Melbourne Film Festival and the convention of Australian Council of Film Societies).

The first 9-hole Olinda Golf course, to the east of the township, sat on State Forests and was established in 1933 but fell into disuse during the war. There was renewed interest in the 1940s and a new club formed in 1952, but it closed in 1961. Following the 1962 bushfires, there was significant investment by the Forests Commission Victoria in expanding and upgrading the course because it doubled as an important firebreak and buffer to the township of Olinda. New facilities were built and the course extended to 18-holes. A third golf club formed in 1968 but it later closed in about 2012 In 2017, the Victorian Government announced that the site of the former golf club would be converted into parklands and gardens, along with the expansion of the rhododendron gardens into the new Dandenong Ranges Botanic Gardens.

==Demographics==
At the , Olinda had a population of 1,738 people.
The median age of the Olinda population was 44 years of age, compared to the Australian average of 38. 
74.9% of residents were born in Australia, compared to the Australian average of 66.7%. The other top responses for country of birth were England 7.2% and New Zealand 1.7%. 
When asked about religion, the most frequent response was &quot;No Religion&quot; (50%), followed by Catholic (12%), and Anglican (10%).

==Economy==
Olinda is a popular tourist destination in the Dandenong Ranges, home to cafes, restaurants, antique and craft shops, and numerous art galleries, showcasing local, national, and international artists in such areas as sculpture and painting. The town is surrounded by a number of walking trails and natural waterfalls, including the Olinda Falls &amp; Cascade Walk. The Dandenong Ranges Botanic Garden is situated to the east of the town.

==Sport==
Together with the neighbouring township of Ferny Creek, Olinda has both Australian Rules football and netball teams competing in the Outer East Football and Netball League.

==Media==
Olinda receives all Melbourne TV and Radio Channels, as it is very close to the Transmission towers, which are West of Olinda. However, being near the Transmitters and in the hills, Olinda also receives channels from Gippsland, and some from Bendigo.
TV operators are ABC, SBS, Seven Network (Melbourne), Nine Network (Melbourne), Ten Network (Melbourne), Southern Cross Nine (Gippsland and Bendigo), Prime7 (Gippsland and Bendigo), WIN Network (Gippsland and Bendigo), 7TWO (Melbourne, Gippsland, Bendigo), 7mate (Melbourne, Gippsland, Bendigo).

<doc id="609299" wikidata="Q6353868" url="?curid=609299" title="Kallista, Victoria">
<text>Kallista is a locality within Greater Melbourne beyond the Melbourne metropolitan area Urban Growth Boundary, 36 km south-east from Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Kallista recorded a population of 1,418 at the 2021 census.

Kallista, along with the other towns of the Dandenong Ranges is celebrated for its picturesque natural setting, wealth of heritage and luxury houses and gardens, and country atmosphere all within commuting distance to inner Melbourne.

Today, the town is closely associated with the work of Thomas William Roberts, the English-born Australian artist and leading member of the Heidelberg School art movement, also known as Australian impressionism, who lived and worked in Kallista between 1893 and 1931.

== Early impressions ==
&quot;It is a long, steady rise from Belgrave to Kallista, and 20 years ago the road was rough and stony. The two city artists who were with me had found the walk rather far. As we rose to the crest, topped now by the Kallista school, the water-colourist sighed, drew his hands from his trouser pockets – he always strolled with his arms buried to the wrists – and looked at me reproachfully. &#x27;Someone has stolen the end of this road,&#x27; he remarked with conviction. Five minutes later his back straightened, his eye brightened, he was a different man; we were facing that wonderful view which is framed by the soft green hills of Sassafras and Olinda. &#x27;Why didn&#x27;t I bring my paints?&#x27; he asked.&quot;

==History==

Kallista&#x27;s history has moved from likely use by Aboriginals prior to white settlement, to slow development by loggers and farmers, through settler selection to the current mix of state forest (Sherbrooke Forest, part of the Dandenong Ranges National Park), residential housing and agriculture. Kallista&#x27;s history is closely related to the suburbs around Kallista, including Sherbrooke, Sassafras, Olinda, The Patch, Monbulk and Belgrave. From being a distant holiday town from Melbourne in the early to mid part of the twentieth century, Kallista is now part of greater metropolitan Melbourne.

The earliest white occupants were probably loggers in the 1850s. Gradually other settlers arrived. In 1867, the State Government commissioned a survey of the area around what is now Kallista. were declared a forest reserve, although in 1878 the boundaries were altered and another were made available for sale. During the economic depression of the 1890s in Victoria, the President of the Board of Land and Works and Commissioner Crown Lands and Survey, John McIntyre, decided to open areas of the Dandenong Ranges for selection. Although there were protests from various groups, another were opened in 1893.

Selectors were of two types: village selectors and free selectors. Village selectors were expected to live on their selections and could work on the roads. Free selectors were unable to work on the roads, but could keep their existing jobs and work the land. South Sassafras (Kallista) was open to free selectors.

The Post Office opened around 1902 and was known as South Sassafras until 1925.

From 1912 to 1918 roads were completed between Belgrave and South Sassafras (Kallista) and Monbulk. Melburnians then began to use the area for weekenders and holiday homes as the original farm blocks were subdivided. The South Sassafras State School opened on 10 March 1919 with sixteen pupils. It was first located in the local hall known as the Mechanics Hall and by 1924 had moved to its current location on Monbulk Road. A telephone exchange was installed in 1923.

By 1924, the problem of confusion of the name of South Sassafras with Sassafras led to suggestions that the name of the town be changed. Many names were suggested, but the name &quot;Kallista&quot; (in ancient Greek, &quot;Kalliste&quot;, meaning &quot;most beautiful&quot;) was adopted and the change made on 1 April 1925.

The Great Depression saw an influx of people buying the weekend cottages from Melburnians who could not afford to keep them up. The new owners were hoping to support their families from the blocks of land.

== Early inhabitants and owners ==
John Hardy (after whom Hardy&#x27;s Creek was named) was commissioned by the State Government to survey the area around what is now Kallista in 1867. Early settlers included James Hermon (Hermon&#x27;s Saddle Reserve and Hermon&#x27;s Corner (the corner of Grantulla Road and the Belgrave-Gembrook Road)) and Matthew Hall (remembered in Hall&#x27;s Track, the original name of Grantulla Road and now the name of the track in Sherbrooke Forest that runs along Grantulla Road). Matthew Hall sold land to G.W. Selby (after whom the neighbouring suburb of Selby is named). One of Selby&#x27;s managers was William Grant, who built Grantulla. J. Jackson (Jackson&#x27;s Hill) selected the land adjoining Selby&#x27;s.

J.C. Cole, a nurseryman, started a nursery called &quot;Glen Harrow&quot; (Glen Harrow Heights Road) between Belgrave and Kallista. Coles Ridge Road was named after him.

In 1910 Mr John Garibaldi &quot;Garry&quot; Roberts and his family acquired an allotment on the north side of Sassafras Creek (now Sunnyside Avenue) opposite Beagley&#x27;s Bridge (now part of Perrins Creek Road). The property was named &quot;Sunnyside&quot; and became a focal point for many artistic guests, including CJ Dennis and Jeannie Gunn, author of &quot;We of the Never Never&quot;. Mr Roberts acquired a number of buses (retired horse-drawn trams) which were brought to Sunnyside to provide accommodation for the visitors.

CJ Dennis wrote &quot;The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke&quot; whilst staying at Sunnyside. It was illustrated by Hal Gye who was also a visitor to Sunnyside. First published on 9 October 1915, it was dedicated to Mr and Mrs JG Roberts.

The foundations of the original &quot;Sunnyside&quot; still remain after a house fire.

==The Town today==

Kallista Village is particularly known for its proximity to Sherbrooke Forest. Walks around Sherbrooke Forest range from easy to somewhat steep. Sherbrooke is well known for its Superb Lyrebird population, which has increased recently with efforts to reduce the feral cat and fox population. Although early in the morning is the best time to see and hear lyrebirds, they can be seen and heard throughout the day. The males&#x27; calls are particularly prominent in June.

Grants Picnic Ground, on Monbulk Road near Kallista Village, is very popular with tourists, as large numbers of sulphur-crested cockatoos, crimson rosellas, galahs and Australian king parrots gather to be fed bird seed by on-lookers. They will usually fly down and sit on hands, arms and (sometimes) heads.

==Notable residents==
* Jim Cairns, former Deputy Prime Minister in the Whitlam Government, would often sells his books and other counter-culture material at a stall in the Kallista markets during the 1980s.
* Don Chipp, founder of the Australian Democrats, lived in Kallista for many years during the 1980s.
* Tom Roberts, painter, lived here between 1856 and 1931. A painting of his entitled &quot;Washing Day, Kallista&quot; is hanging in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. A local road is named after him.
* C. J. Dennis, poet and author, wrote much of his &quot;The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke&quot; on J. G. Roberts&#x27; property at Sunnyside circa 1913/14.
* Paul Hester, original drummer for the band Crowded House, lived there during the 1970s.

<text>Bhagat is a term used in the Indian subcontinent to describe religious figures who have obtained high acclaim in their communities for their acts and devotion. It is also a term ascribed to one of the clans in the Mahar caste, with their clan totem being a King Cobra. Furthermore, Bhagat is additionally a surname found among Marathas, Bania communities and Punjabi Brahmins.

==Definition==
&quot;Bhagat&quot; is a Hindi and Punjabi word derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;Bhagavat&quot;, भगवत्, which means saint or devotee. It is known to be used as an epithet for Vishnu or Krishna. &quot;Bhagat&quot; is also a Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain surname, found in various communities throughout India. Though, it is most prevalent in the northern states of India.

==Sikhism==
Sikhism&#x27;s central scriptural book, Guru Granth Sahib, has teachings of 15 &quot;Bhagats&quot;, along with &quot;bani&quot; of Sikh Gurus, &quot;Bhats&quot; and &quot;Gursikhs&quot;. Because Sikhism believes in one human creed (no one belongs to a higher or a lower social status or caste) and that accounts to adding &quot;Bani&quot; of various authors, a total of 36, in Guru Granth Sahib irrespective of many belonging to religions other than Sikhism. Religious writings of those &quot;Bhagats&quot; were collected by Guru Arjan. Some of them lived before Guru Nanak, but came to have a monotheistic as opposed to a polytheistic doctrine.

Broadly speaking, therefore, a &quot;Bhagat&quot; is a holy person or a member of a community whose objectives involve leading humanity towards God and highlighting injustices in the world.

Below is a list of the &quot;Bhagats&quot; who contributed towards Sri Guru Granth Sahib:

*Bhagat Kabir
*Bhagat Ravidas
*Bhagat Farid
*Bhagat Ramanand
*Bhagat Beni 
*Bhagat Namdev 
*Bhagat Sadhana
*Bhagat Bhikhan 
*Bhagat Parmanand 
*Bhagat Sain
*Bhagat Dhanna 
*Bhagat Pipa 
*Bhagat Surdas
*Bhagat Jaidev 
*Bhagat Trilochan

<doc id="609301" wikidata="Q80680" url="?curid=609301" title="Jenever">
<text>Jenever (, ), also known as Hollands, genever, genièvre, peket, or sometimes as Dutch gin (archaic: Holland gin or Geneva gin), is the juniper-flavoured traditional liquor in the Netherlands, Belgium, and adjoining areas in northern France and northwestern Germany. As an EU and UK Protected Designation of Origin, the term &quot;jenever&quot; and its soundalikes can only be used if the product is made according to the specifications in Belgium, the Netherlands, two northern French departments, and two German federal states. Gin was developed in Britain after the introduction of jenever to the island.

==History==
Jenever was originally produced by distilling malt wine (&quot;moutwijn&quot; in Dutch) to 50% alcohol by volume. Because the resulting spirit was not palatable due to the lack of refined distilling techniques (with only the pot still available), herbs were added to mask the flavour. The juniper berry (which comes from the Latin &quot;juniperus&quot;), hence the name &quot;jenever&quot; (and the English name gin), was used for its alleged medicinal benefits.

At least in some regions, such as around Ommen in Overijssel, Netherlands, jenever is distilled from spelt, an old variety of wheat. 

The first written references to genever (or jenever) are found in scientific papers written by several Flemish authors. Jacob van Maerlant (Bruges, 1235 – 1300) described how to add parts of the juniper tree to a spirit made of distilling wine in his book &quot;Der Naturen Bloeme&quot;, published in 1266. It was the first writing of distilling in Dutch and had to do with the juniper tree. Later on, in 1522, the Antwerp-based doctor Phillipus Hermanni wrote the first recipe for genever. He described how to mix crushed juniper berries with wine and distill it afterwards. The very first versions of genever were being made for medical purposes and came from distilled wine. Later on, when cold periods drove out the vineyards in Flanders, it was replaced by distilling beer, calling it malt wine.

There is tradition that attributes the invention of jenever to the Dutch chemist and alchemist Franciscus Sylvius de Bouve (1614–1672). However, the evidence suggests that jenever was already known and used as a medicine in the 1500s. Already by 1606 (several years before Sylvius&#x27;s birth), the Dutch had levied taxes on jenever and similar liquors as alcoholic drinks, suggesting that jenever had by then stopped being considered a medicinal remedy. Furthermore, prior to Sylvius&#x27;s tenth birthday, jenever appeared in Philip Massinger&#x27;s 1623 play, &quot;The Duke of Milan&quot;, which referred to the drink as &quot;geneva&quot;. &quot;Geneva&quot; was the Anglicized name for jenever (even though the drink has no relation to the Swiss city of Geneva), a name that English soldiers had brought back with them when returning from battle in the Low Countries, first in 1587 (well before Sylvius&#x27;s birth) and again during the early 1600s.

Since the 1950s, Dutch flag carrier airline KLM has issued a series of Delft Blue houses modelled on buildings in the Netherlands filled with jenever, which are presented to passengers.

==Old and young==

There are two types of jenever: &quot;oude&quot; (old) and &quot;jonge&quot; (young). This is not a matter of aging, but of distilling techniques. Around 1900, it became possible to distill a high-grade type of alcohol that was almost neutral in taste, independent of the origin of the spirit. A worldwide tendency for a lighter and less dominant taste, as well as lower prices, led to the development of blended whisky in Scotland and in the Netherlands to &quot;Jonge Jenever&quot;. During World War I, the lack of imported cereals — and hence malt — forced the promotion of this blend. Alcohol derived from molasses from the sugar beet industry was used as an alternative to grain spirit. People started using the terms &quot;oude&quot; for the old-style jenever and &quot;jonge&quot; for the new style, which contains more grain instead of malt and can even contain plain sugar-based alcohol.

In modern times, jenever distilled from grain and malt only is labelled &quot;Graanjenever&quot;. &quot;Jonge jenever&quot; can contain no more than 15% malt wine and 10 grams of sugar per litre. &quot;Oude jenever&quot; must contain at least 15% malt wine but no more than 20 g of sugar per litre. &quot;Korenwijn&quot; (grain wine) is a drink very similar to the 18th-century-style jenever and is often matured for a few years in an oak cask; it contains from 51% to 70% malt wine and up to 20 g/L of sugar. Although the name &quot;oude jenever&quot; does not necessarily mean that the jenever is in fact old, there are some distilleries that age their jenever in oak barrels.

About 90% of all &quot;Jonge Jenever&quot; sold on the market is a blend of malt wine produced by Filliers in Belgium, sugar beet or grain based ethyl alcohol from factories in Germany, France, and (mostly) Russia, and water. Most of the bigger brands contain no malt wine, so they resemble, in essence, vodka. Distilleries in Belgium and the Netherlands actually distill jenever, which mostly produces limited volumes of specialty drinks.

==Taste==
&quot;Jonge jenever&quot; has a neutral taste, like vodka, with a slight aroma of juniper and malt wine. &quot;Oude jenever&quot; has a smoother, very aromatic taste with malty flavours. &quot;Oude jenever&quot; is sometimes aged in wood; its malty, woody, and smoky flavours resemble whisky. Different grains used in the production process — such as barley, wheat, spelt, and rye — produce different flavoured jenevers. The taste is sometimes enhanced by adopting barrels previously used for American whiskey.

==Jenever cities==
Hasselt, Deinze, Aalst, and Liège in Belgium, and Schiedam, Groningen, Amsterdam, and Delft in the Netherlands, are well known for their jenevers and often referred to as &quot;jenever cities&quot; (&quot;jeneversteden&quot;). In Amsterdam, jenever is made by &quot;The Stillery&quot;, &quot;Van Wees, &quot;and &quot;Wynand Fockink&quot;. Well-known Schiedam jenever distilleries include &quot;Nolet&quot;, &quot;Onder De Boompjes&quot;, &quot;Herman Jansen,&quot; and &quot;De Kuyper&quot;. (Jenever can appear under the English-language name &quot;schiedam&quot;.) Near the Dutch-Belgian border, in Baarle-Nassau, &quot;Zuidam&quot; produces traditional jenevers and Dutch liquors. Other jenever cities in the Netherlands are Groningen (&quot;Hooghoudt&quot;) and Dordrecht (&quot;Rutte Distillery&quot;). In Belgium, Deinze is very well known for the &quot;Filliers&quot; distillery, and Aalst is well known for &quot;Stokerij De Moor&quot; and &quot;Stokerij Van Der Schueren&quot;, both still active today. Hasselt styles itself as Belgium&#x27;s jenever capital and has a museum dedicated to the drink. Also with the Biercée Distillery in Wallonia, one of only two Belgian distilleries to export their genever to the USA.

Dutch-based Lucas Bols produces and sells &quot;oude genever&quot;, known as &quot;ginebra&quot; in Spanish, in South America. Ketel One is now more known for producing vodka, but it started out as, and still is, a jenever distillery.

==Drinking traditions==
Traditionally, the drink is served in a tulip-shaped glass filled to the brim, with the surface tension enabling the jenever to rise higher than the glass&#x27;s edge. &quot;Jonge jenever&quot;, colloquially a &quot;jonkie&quot; (&quot;young&#x27;un&quot;), is usually served at room temperature, sometimes (though this is now quite old-fashioned) with some sugar and a tiny spoon to stir. The drink is sometimes served cold from a bottle kept in a freezer or on the rocks (&quot;jonge met ijs&quot;). The higher-quality &quot;oude jenever&quot; (and &quot;korenwijn&quot;) is usually served at room temperature. When jenever is drunk alongside beer (normally lager) as a chaser, it is referred to as a &quot;kopstoot&quot; (headbutt), when the glass of jenever is dipped into the beer glass, it is called a &quot;duikboot&quot; (submarine) in Flanders and the South of Holland. Traditionally, jenever is served in full shot-glasses taken directly from the freezer. As the glass is very full, it is advisable to take the first sip without holding the glass, leaving it on the table, and bending one&#x27;s back to apply one&#x27;s mouth to the glass.

==Geographical indications==
Recognized for its historic and cultural contribution, and subject to production specifications, the European Union protected genever with 11 specific types of jenever as a geographical indication:

* Belgium, the Netherlands, small parts of France, and small parts of Germany: genever (&quot;Genièvre / Jenever / Genever&quot;), grain genever (&quot;Genièvre de grains / Graanjenever / Graangenever&quot;)
* Belgium, the Netherlands, small parts of Germany: Genièvre aux fruits / Vruchtenjenever / Jenever met vruchten / Fruchtgenever
* Belgium and the Netherlands: old genever (&quot;oude jenever / oude genever&quot;), young genever (&quot;jonge jenever / jonge genever&quot;)
* Belgium: O&#x27;de Flander real East-Flemish grain genever (&quot;O&#x27;de Flander Echte Oost-Vlaamse graanjenever&quot;), Hasselt genever (&quot;Hasseltse jenever&quot;), Balegem genever (&quot;Balegemse jenever&quot;), and the Walloon peket (&quot;Peket-Pekêt / Pèket-Pèkèt de Wallonie&quot;)
* Two provinces of France: Flanders Artois genever (&quot;genièvre Flandre Artois&quot;)
* Two states of Germany: East-Frisia cereal grain genever (&quot;Ostfriesischer Korngenever&quot;)

The names Genièvre and Genièvre de Jura are also protected geographical indications of Switzerland (recognised in the EU).

Protection as a geographical indication of Jenever also applies in Armenia, China, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Mexico, Moldova, Norway, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and Japan.

<text>Kalorama is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 35 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Kalorama recorded a population of 1,277 at the 2021 census.

The suburb was first settled by Europeans around 1855 when Isaac Jeeves, Mathew Child and Jabez Richardson took up selections. The traditional custodians of the area are the Wurundjeri of the Kulin nation.

The Post Office opened on 1 October 1909, but was known as Hand&#x27;s Corner until 1910, then Mount Dandenong North until 1926.

The area, renowned for its beauty, is the site of a famous lookout point named &quot;Five Ways&quot; which overlooks Kalorama Park, Silvan Reservoir, the National Rhododendron Gardens, and the R J Hamer Arboretum. Nearby attractions include William Ricketts Sanctuary, Olinda Falls, a gallery, and a range of tea-rooms, cafes and stores.

The forests of the region are dominated by various eucalypt species including mountain ash &quot;(Eucalyptus regnans)&quot;, the tallest known angiosperm. The local wet sclerophyll forests form habitat for many species of native bird including the superb lyrebird &quot;(Menura novaehollandiae)&quot; which can be sometimes heard voicing its characteristic mimicry from the deeper gullies and south-eastern aspects.

The area has featured in the work of many Australian artists, including Sir Arthur Streeton.

<doc id="609303" wikidata="Q967302" url="?curid=609303" title="Nicholas Hytner">
<text>Sir Nicholas Robert Hytner ( ; born 7 May 1956) is an English theatre director, film director, and film producer. He was previously the Artistic Director of London&#x27;s National Theatre. His major successes as director include &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, &quot;The History Boys&quot; and &quot;One Man, Two Guvnors&quot;. He is also known for directing films such as &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; (1994), &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1996), &quot;The History Boys&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Lady in the Van&quot; (2015). Hytner was knighted in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to drama by Queen Elizabeth II.

==Early life and education==
Hytner was born in the prosperous suburbs of south Manchester in 1956, to barrister Benet Hytner and his wife, Joyce. He is the eldest child of four, and has described his upbringing as being in &quot;a typical Jewish, cultured family&quot;.

He attended Manchester Grammar School and went to university at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he studied English. He did some acting while at university, including co-scripting and performing in a televised production of the 1977 Cambridge Footlights Revue. However, Hytner did not consider acting his strong point. &quot;I think I was savvy enough when I went to Cambridge to discover I was a poor actor,&quot; he said later. He also did some directing, including a production of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot;.

==Career==

===Early career===
After leaving Cambridge, Hytner&#x27;s first &quot;proper paid job&quot; was as assistant to Colin Graham at English National Opera. Some of his earliest professional directing work was in opera, including at Kent Opera, Wexford Festival Opera and a production of &quot;Rienzi&quot; at English National Opera. His first theatre productions were at the Northcott Theatre, Exeter. He then directed a series of productions at the Leeds Playhouse, including &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; by Peter Barnes, an adaptation of &quot;Tom Jones&quot; and a musical version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. In 1985 he became an Associate Director of the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, a position he retained until 1989.

===Theatre director===
Hytner was hired by producer Cameron Mackintosh to direct &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, the next work from &quot;Les Misérables&quot; creators Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg. &quot;I had seen several of Nick&#x27;s opera productions – Handel&#x27;s &#x27;Xerxes&#x27; and Mozart&#x27;s &#x27;Magic Flute&#x27; – as well as some of his classical plays, and he has a marvellously visual point of view,&quot; Mackintosh said. For Hytner, &quot;It just felt like a huge lark... It was gigantic, and I was into gigantic at the time, so I threw everything I knew at it. It was big, honest, moving, brash, kind of crazy. I had no idea that it would take off.&quot;

Hytner&#x27;s London production of &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; opened on 20 September 1989, and closed on 30 October 1999 after just over ten years, on its 4,274th performance, having grossed more than £150 million in ticket sales during its London run. Hytner also directed the New York production, where the show recouped its $10.9m investment in 39 weeks. The show, at New York&#x27;s Broadway Theatre, opened on 11 April 1991 and closed on 28 January 2001 after 4,092 performances.

Hytner was on a percentage for both London and New York productions, allowing him (then aged 34) to never need worry about money again. &quot;It was a huge– a massive stroke of fortune,&quot; he said in 2010. &quot;It meant that thereafter I only needed to do what I wanted to do.&quot;

What Hytner did was to continue directing theatre and opera, including several productions at London&#x27;s National Theatre (where he had first directed in 1989 with &quot;Ghetto&quot;). In 1990, he was appointed an Associate Director of the National by its then-Director Richard Eyre. One of the plays he directed was Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;The Madness of George III&quot;. When a film adaptation was commissioned, Bennett insisted Hytner should direct it, and the retitled &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; (1994) became Hytner&#x27;s film debut.

In 1994, Eyre announced he would be leaving the National Theatre in three years&#x27; time. &quot;[It] made me begin to think about the vision that is needed in such a position and the fact that this needs refreshing under every directorate. I very much felt that you had to have a big idea in order to put yourself forward for such a role and as I didn&#x27;t have this kind of idea at that time, I decided not to apply,&quot; Hytner said later. He continued as an Associate Director at the National until 1997, when the new Director, Trevor Nunn, took up his post.

Hytner directed more films: &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1996) with Daniel Day-Lewis, &quot;The Object of My Affection&quot; (1998) and &quot;Center Stage&quot; (2000). The last of these was not an adaptation from a play or novel, having been based on an original screenplay. He also spent 15 months developing a film of the musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, to star Madonna, but the project foundered and was later made with a different director and cast.

===National Theatre Director (2003-15)===
When Trevor Nunn announced that he would be leaving the National Theatre, Hytner &quot;really felt that this time I had a strong sense of what the NT should be doing under a new Director. I had a long conversation with Christopher Hogg, then Chairman of the NT Board, and Tom Stoppard about my ideas for the NT&#x27;s future. These included a redefinition of how it might be possible to use the theatre spaces and opening up the NT to new audiences by lowering prices for some performances.&quot; Hytner was successful in his application for the post, and his appointment as Director was announced in September 2001. He took over from Nunn in April 2003.

Hytner&#x27;s role as Director of the National involves decisions about what plays are staged. &quot;Essentially what I do is produce 20 shows a year here,&quot; he stated in one interview. &quot;To produce as opposed to direct, as I generate the ideas, generate the repertoire. What I do is put together the team that are going to stage the repertoire together then stand back and come in at a later stage to see how it&#x27;s all going.&quot; (Hytner does also direct plays himself at the National, and all his theatre work since 2003 has originated there.) But his role is also about the overall direction of the National Theatre as an organisation. &quot;It would be wrong to say that I confine myself only to the repertoire – I don&#x27;t. I think how we allocate our resources, exactly what we spend money on, is always an artistic decision. I think the amount of attention we give to what goes on in the foyers, what goes on outside, how the building looks at night, the amount of attention we give to our education work and our website are all artistic matters. They all stem from a sense of the artistic direction of the organization.&quot;

Under Hytner&#x27;s directorship, the National has innovated with Sunday openings, live cinema broadcasts of NT plays around the world, &quot;National Theatre Live&quot;, and with its reduced price ticket seasons. These seasons, sponsored by Travelex, have offered large numbers of reduced price seats (for £10 when the scheme was introduced in 2003, with prices rising to £12 from 2011). The reduced price seasons were credited with achieving high usage for the Olivier auditorium – between 90% and 100% full during the summer months compared to a historic average of 65%, with no loss in overall income, and with encouraging a younger and more diverse audience. In 2003 it was reported that one third of the audience for the multiracial production of &quot;Henry V&quot; in modern dress (directed by Hytner) had never been to the theatre before, and that a large section of the audience for the drama &quot;Elmina&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; were Black east Londoners new to the National.

Hytner has said that this diversity is a consequence of the theatre&#x27;s direction rather than the motivation for it. &quot;I think our repertoire is more diverse than it&#x27;s ever been,&quot; he said, &quot;and I think that reflects a more diverse society and a more diverse audience. The aim, though, was not to go out and find a diverse audience but for the repertoire to reflect a greater diversity in our culture.&quot; He has also said: &quot;The rep[ertoire] should reflect the world we&#x27;re part of, and it should put the society in which we live in the context of the past and, as far as we can, of the wider world.&quot;

Hytner&#x27;s latest innovation is &quot;NT Future&quot;, a £70 million scheme (of which £59 million had been raised at October 2012) to open up the National&#x27;s building and to contribute to the regeneration of the South Bank, to transform facilities for education and participation, and to keep ahead of new technologies and the changing needs of theatre artists and audiences.

Hytner stated as early as 2010 that he did not wish to stay as head of the National indefinitely, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve been here seven years. My predecessors have averaged 12. It&#x27;s important that someone else comes in and shakes it up again so I won&#x27;t be here in 10 years, that&#x27;s for sure.&quot; In April 2013, he announced that he would step down as Director of the National Theatre at the end of March 2015. In his role as Director of National Theatre, he appeared on the Cultural Exchange as part of the Radio Four programme &quot;Front Row&quot;, where he chose &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; by Mozart as his work of art.

=== The London Theatre Company (2017-present) ===
Hytner and Nick Starr founded the London Theatre Company opening a new 900-seat adaptable commercial theatre, Bridge Theatre near Tower Bridge in October 2017. Hytner directed the inaugural production of &quot;Young Marx&quot; followed by productions such as the hit immersive revivals of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; in 2018, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in 2019 and &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; which ran from March 2023 until January 2025.

The London Theatre Company also opened another venue with 59 Productions, The Lightroom in King&#x27;s Cross, London in February 2023 used for immersive artist-led exhibitions which will also eventually become a theatrical space.

===Opera and film===
Hytner has worked extensively in opera, with many of his productions achieving critical acclaim and commercial success – his English National Opera staging of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; was in repertory for 25 years. But Hytner has described himself (to an opera-related audience) as &quot;someone who is unimpressed by his own work on the operatic stage&quot;.

Similarly, most of Hytner&#x27;s films have achieved critical and commercial success, with &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; winning BAFTA and &quot;Evening Standard&quot; awards for best British film, but he still sees himself as primarily a theatre practitioner. &quot;I think I&#x27;m a theatre director who does other stuff,&quot; he has said. &quot;I can&#x27;t see myself as a film-maker. I love doing opera when ever I&#x27;ve done it, but I always see myself as visiting from the theatre, which is where I belong. The real film-maker thinks with a camera, which is something I just can&#x27;t do.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hytner is gay. Although brought up in a Jewish household, Hytner said in 2010, &quot;I&#x27;m not a believer, but I do think it is a significant part of my adventure and it fascinates me. I couldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a member of the Jewish community or gay community in that I don&#x27;t seek out either of those communities to hang out with, but it is an important part of who I believe myself to [be].&quot;

Hytner&#x27;s mother, Joyce Hytner , is a theatrical fundraiser, who has served on the board of many organisations including The Old Vic, the Criterion Theatre, the Royal Court Theatre and Historic Royal Palaces.

He was elected an Honorary Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 2005, and was Visiting Professor of Contemporary Theatre at Oxford University in 2000–01.

Hytner was knighted in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to drama. In spring 2014, the Royal Northern College of Music announced it was to confer Honorary Membership of the College upon Hytner. In 2014 he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Academy of Arts.

<text>Launching Place is a town in Victoria, Australia, 54 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Launching Place recorded a population of 2,495 at the .

Launching Place is located along the Warburton Highway between Woori Yallock and Yarra Junction. It is believed that Launching Place is named after the place on the Yarra River where freshly cut logs were &quot;launched&quot; into the river to be floated down to sawmills in Melbourne.

A post office opened on 12 July 1865. It was replaced by one at Hoddles Creek in 1869, but reopened on 1 September 1880, finally closing in 1994.

From 1901 to 1965, the township was served by a railway station on the Warburton line.

Launching Place has many camping grounds, and people use it was a base for camping, hiking and boating in the Yarra River.

The Derelict Aircraft Museum was formerly located in Launching Place but, by 2017, it had been closed and dismantled.

A new car park has recently been constructed behind the Launching Place General Store, improving access to the Warburton Rail Trail and the store.

<text>The Heckler &amp; Koch PSG1 (&quot;Präzisionsschützengewehr&quot;, German for &quot;precision marksman rifle&quot;) is a semi-automatic sniper rifle designed and produced by the German company Heckler &amp; Koch.

==Development==
This rifle is said to have been developed in response to the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The West German police units at the time lacked the precision shooting capability to effectively neutralize the terrorists to prevent the hostages being killed. H&amp;K was then commissioned to create a high-accuracy, large-magazine capacity, semi-automatic rifle for law enforcement and military use.

==Design details==
The PSG1 is mechanically based on the Heckler &amp; Koch G3 battle rifle that employs a roller-delayed blowback operating system. Its shot-to-shot variation is expected to be better than 1 minute of angle (MOA) with match ammunition. This level of accuracy is only average compared to most modern bolt action sniper rifles, but is still exceptional for a semi-automatic rifle and at one time was claimed to be &quot;one of the most accurate semi-automatic sniper rifles in the world.&quot;

The rifle has a strengthened receiver with rails welded over the channels where a retractable buttstock would slide and features numerous other upgrades and such to meet the necessities of police sniper units. The two sliding locking rollers that hold the bolt in battery during firing are not cylindrical shaped like in normal G3 rifles, but semi-cylindrical shaped to offer a non-random more precise positioning on corresponding flat surfaces in the barrel extension locking recesses. The PSG1 also features a low-noise bolt closing device (similar to the forward assist on many M16 rifles).

PSG1s are not supplied with iron sights but come equipped with the Hensoldt ZF 6×42 PSG1 scope with an illuminated reticle. The scope has a built-in bullet drop compensation range adjustment feature which can be adjusted from 100 to 600 m.

It has a heavy free-floating barrel with polygonal rifling and an adjustable stock. The stock is of high impact matte black plastic and has a high degree of adjustment. It is adjustable for length, and includes a pivoting butt cap and a vertically-adjustable cheekpiece. The forend is fitted with a T-way rail for sling swivel or tripod.

The rifle also features a removable and adjustable trigger unit, for further individual fitting of the rifle. The trigger pull can be modified and the whole assembly is removable from the pistol grip. The pistol grip is of a target-style with an adjustable palm shelf.

The PSG1&#x27;s official suppressor is from Brügger &amp; Thomet (B and T).

===PSG1A1===
The PSG1A1 variant was introduced by Heckler &amp; Koch in 2006, and features two major improvements. First, the cocking handle was relocated a couple of degrees counter-clockwise. This was because when locked rearward, it could physically interfere with the long scopes often used on the rifles. The second modification involved the replacement of the outdated Hensoldt scope. Non-police users often found the scope&#x27;s 600 m range limitation and simple crosshairs inadequate for their needs. In addition, the rechargeable batteries are difficult to recharge and for which to find replacements. A final fault is that Hensoldt does not service the scope in the United States. For these reasons, the PSG1A1 has been outfitted with a Schmidt &amp; Bender 3–12×50 Police Marksman II scope, mounted on rings. To remedy brass ejection a brass catcher must be installed.

==MSG90==
The MSG90 (&quot;Militärisches Scharfschützengewehr&quot;, German for &quot;militarized sharp-shooting rifle&quot;) is a militarized variant of the PSG1 that is both strengthened and lightened while less expensive. Compared to the PSG1 which is regarded as a pure sniper rifle, the MSG90 can fill the role of a designated marksman rifle.

The PSG1 and MSG90 have different trigger packs. The MSG90 uses a modified version of the push pin trigger packs of H&amp;K roller-delayed select-fire assault rifles. The composite shoulder stock of the MSG90 is adjustable for height (cheek), length of pull (shoulder), and is smaller and lighter than that of the PSG1. MSG90s have a slightly shorter contoured barrel to help with harmonic stabilization and consistent whip instead of the PSG1&#x27;s heavy barrel, but remain free-floating. As a result, these particular MSG90 A1s have a threaded barrel capable of attaching a suppressor, which is an advantage over the PSG1.

The sighting system uses the multipurpose Weaver rail mount rather than the Picatinny rail for affixing sighting systems which can be purchased separately. This same scope mounting system is used on the HK21E, HK23E, and G41 (discontinued) series.

The barrel is weighted at the muzzle to aid stabilization of barrel whip to enhance accuracy. The addition of a flash suppressor adds to the overall length.

<doc id="609309" wikidata="Q1499623" url="?curid=609309" title="Destroyer escort">
<text>Destroyer escort (DE) was the United States Navy mid-20th-century classification for a warship designed with the endurance necessary to escort mid-ocean convoys of merchant marine ships.

Development of the destroyer escort was promoted by the British need in World War II for anti-submarine ships that could operate in open oceans at speeds of up to 20 knots. These &quot;British Destroyer Escort&quot;s were designed by the US for mass-production under Lend Lease as a less expensive alternative to fleet destroyers.

The Royal Navy and Commonwealth forces identified such warships as frigates, and that classification was widely accepted when the United States redesignated destroyer escorts as frigates (FF) in 1975. From circa 1954 until 1975 new-build US Navy ships designated as destroyer escorts (DE) were called ocean escorts. Similar types of warships in other navies of the time included the 46 diesel powered &quot;Kaibōkan&quot; of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 10 &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; F-class escort ships, and the two &quot;Amiral Murgescu&quot;-class vessels of the Romanian Navy.

Postwar destroyer escorts and frigates were larger than those produced during wartime, with increased anti-aircraft capability, but remained smaller and slower than postwar destroyers. As Cold War destroyer escorts became as large as wartime destroyers, the United States Navy converted some of their World War II destroyers to escort destroyers (DDE).

==General description==
Full-sized destroyers must be able to steam as fast or faster than cruisers and fast capital ships such as fleet carriers. This typically requires a speed of (dependent upon the era and navy). They must carry torpedoes and a smaller caliber of naval guns to use against enemy ships, anti-aircraft guns, and antisubmarine detection equipment and weapons. While these requirements made the destroyer a fast all-around combatant, this made them too valuable to be relegated to convoy escort duties.

A destroyer escort needed only to be able to maneuver relative to a slow convoy (which in World War II would travel at ), be able to defend against aircraft, and detect, pursue, and attack submarines. These lower requirements greatly reduce the size, cost, and crew required for the destroyer escort. Destroyer escorts were optimized for antisubmarine warfare, having a tighter turning radius and more specialized armament (such as the forward-firing Hedgehog mortar) than fleet destroyers. The slower speed of destroyer escorts was not a liability in this context as sonar was useless at speeds over .

As an alternative to geared steam-turbine propulsion found in sloops of similar purpose, size and speed (as well as full-sized destroyers and larger warships), many US destroyer escorts of the World War II period had diesel-electric or turboelectric drive, in which the engine rooms functioned as power stations supplying current to electric motors sited close to the propellers. Electric drive was selected because it does not need gearboxes (produced on special precise machining tooling available in limited quantities, they were heavily in demand for the fast fleet destroyers) to adjust engine speed to the much lower optimal speed for the propellers. The current from the engine room can be used equally well for other purposes, and after the war, many destroyer escorts were re-used as floating power stations for coastal cities in Latin America under programs funded by the World Bank.. ships were the exception to this and they used a geared diesel engine to drive the propellers directly. s used the typical boiler and geared turbine propulsion system.

Destroyer escorts were also useful for coastal antisubmarine and radar picket ship duty. During World War II, seven destroyer escorts (DEs) were converted to radar picket destroyer escorts (DERs), supplementing radar picket destroyers. Although these were relegated to secondary roles after the war, in the mid-1950s, 36 more DEs were converted to DERs, serving as such until 1960–1965. Their mission was to extend the Distant Early Warning Line on both coasts, in conjunction with 16 s, which were converted Liberty ships.

During World War II, some 95 destroyer escorts were converted by the US to high-speed transports (APDs). This involved adding an extra deck which allowed space for about 10 officers and 150 men. Two large davits were also installed, one on either side of the ship, from which landing craft (LCVPs) could be launched.

==Origins==

The Lend-Lease Act was passed into law in the United States in March 1941, enabling the United Kingdom to procure merchant ships, warships, munitions, and other materiel from the US, to help with the war effort. This enabled the UK to commission the US to design, build, and supply an escort vessel that was suitable for antisubmarine warfare in deep open-ocean situations, which they did in June 1941. Captain E.L. Cochrane of the American Bureau of Shipping came up with a design which was known as the British destroyer escort (BDE). The BDE designation was retained by the first six destroyer escorts transferred to the United Kingdom (BDE 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, and 46); of the initial order of 50, these were the only ones the Royal Navy received, the rest being reclassified as destroyer escorts on 25 January 1943 and taken over by the United States Navy.

When the United States entered the war, and found they also required an antisubmarine warfare ship and that the destroyer escort fitted their needs perfectly, a system of rationing was put in place whereby out of every five destroyer escorts completed, four would be allocated to the U.S. Navy and one to the Royal Navy.

==Alternatives==
Destroyer escorts were designed and built to naval construction standards, and as such could only be built at yards experienced with naval standards. The United States Maritime Commission created its S2-S2-AQ1 design – which was based on the British-designed River class – for much the same role but using civilian construction standards. These ships would be classed by the Navy as the &quot;Tacoma&quot; class frigates (PF). These frigates had a greater range than the superficially similar destroyer escorts, but the US Navy viewed them as decidedly inferior in all other respects. The &quot;Tacoma&quot; class had a much larger turning circle than destroyer escorts, lacked sufficient ventilation for warm-weather operations (a reflection of their original British design and its emphasis on operations in the colder North Atlantic Ocean), were criticized as far too hot below decks, and, because of the mercantile style of their hulls, had far less resistance to underwater explosions than ships built to naval standards like the destroyer escorts.

==Post–World War II U.S. ship reclassification==
After World War II, new-build United States Navy destroyer escorts were referred to as ocean escorts, but retained the hull classification symbol DE. However, other navies, most notably those of NATO countries and the USSR, followed different naming conventions for this type of ship, which resulted in some confusion. To remedy this problem, the 1975 ship reclassification declared ocean escorts (and by extension, destroyer escorts) as frigates (FF). This brought the USN&#x27;s nomenclature more in line with NATO, and made comparing ship types with the Soviet Union easier. As of 2006, no plans existed for future frigates for the US Navy. and the littoral combat ship (LCS) were the main ship types planned in this area. However, by 2017 the Navy had reversed course, and put out a Request For Proposals (RFP) for a new frigate class, temporarily designated FFG(X). One major problem with ship classification is whether to base it on a ship&#x27;s role (such as escort or air defense), or on its size (such as displacement). One example of this ambiguity is the air-defense ship class, which is classified as cruiser, though it uses the same hull as the s.

==Vietnam War==
During the Vietnam War, the Republic of Vietnam Navy received two s from the United States.

==&quot;Captain&quot;-class frigates of the Royal Navy==

The &quot;Captain&quot; class was a designation given to 78 frigates of the Royal Navy, constructed in the United States, launched in 1942–1943 and delivered to the United Kingdom under the provisions of the Lend-Lease agreement (under which the United States supplied the United Kingdom and other Allied nations with materiel between 1941 and 1945), they were drawn from two subclasses of the destroyer escort (originally British destroyer escort) classification: 32 from the &quot;Evarts&quot; subclass and 46 from the &quot;Buckley&quot; subclass. Upon reaching the UK, the ships were substantially modified by the Royal Navy, including removal of torpedo tubes, making them distinct from the US Navy destroyer escort ships.

&quot;Captain&quot;-class frigates acted in the roles of convoy escorts, antisubmarine warfare vessels, coastal forces control frigates and headquarters ships for the Normandy landings. During the course of World War II, this class participated in the sinking of at least 34 German submarines and a number of other hostile craft with 15 of the 78 &quot;Captain&quot;-class frigates being either sunk or written off as a constructive total loss.

In the postwar period, all of the surviving &quot;Captain&quot;-class frigates except one (HMS &quot;Hotham&quot;) were returned to the US Navy before the end of 1947 to reduce the amount payable under the provisions of the Lend-Lease agreement; the last such frigate was returned to United States custody in March 1956.

==Free French==
Six &quot;Cannon&quot;-class destroyer escorts were built for the Free French Navy. Although initially transferred under the Lend-Lease Act, these ships were permanently transferred under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program (MDAP).

*FFL &quot;Algérien&quot; (F-1), ex-&quot;Cronin&quot; (DE-107)
*FFL &quot;Sénégalais&quot; (F-2), ex-&quot;Corbestier&quot; (DE-106)
*FFL &quot;Somali&quot; (F-3), ex-&quot;Somali&quot; (DE-111)
*FFL &quot;Hova&quot; (F-4), ex-&quot;Hova&quot; (DE-110)
*FFL &quot;Marocain&quot; (F-5), ex-&quot;Marocain&quot; (DE-109)
*FFL &quot;Tunisien&quot; (F-6), ex-&quot;Crosley&quot; (DE-108)

==Mutual Defense Assistance Program – Post WWII==
Under the MDAP the destroyer escorts leased to the Free French were permanently transferred to the French Navy. In addition, the following navies also acquired DEs:

<doc id="609311" wikidata="Q6713655" url="?curid=609311" title="Springfield Armory M1A">
<text>The Springfield Armory M1A is a semi-automatic rifle made by Springfield Armory, Inc., beginning in 1971, based on the M14 rifle, for the civilian and law enforcement markets in the United States. &quot;M1A&quot; is a proprietary name for Springfield Armory&#x27;s M14-pattern rifle. Early M1A rifles were built with surplus G.I. parts until Springfield Armory, Inc. began manufacturing their own. Robert Reese bought Springfield Armory from Elmer Ballance and moved the manufacturing from Devine, Texas to Geneseo, Illinois in 1974.

==Differences between the M1A and M14==
The M14 was developed to take the place of 4 different weapons systems: the M1 Garand, M1 carbine, M3 submachine gun, and M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). It was thought that in this manner the M14 could simplify the logistical requirements of the troops by limiting the types of ammunition and parts needed to be supplied. It proved to be an impossible task to replace all four as the cartridge was too powerful for the submachine gun role and the weapon was too light to serve as a light machine gun replacement for the BAR.

The Springfield Armory M1A is, for the most part, identical to the M14. There are, however, a few important differences:
M1A receivers are made from precision investment cast AISI 8620 alloy steel. The military M14 receivers were manufactured using the drop forge process, which is more complicated and more expensive. Until around the late 1990s, the M1A produced by Springfield Armory retained the cutout in the rear right of the stock for the selector switch found on the M14. Springfield Armory has also omitted the &quot;7.62-MM&quot; caliber designator on the M1A receiver since 1991.

Once the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 was passed prohibiting the manufacture of firearms with bayonet lugs (among other features), the M1A no longer shipped with a bayonet lug. Although the 1994 law expired in September 2004, making bayonet lugs on newly manufactured firearms legal again (in most states), Springfield Armory has not restored that feature. Since the bayonet lug is attached to the flash suppressor, &quot;post-ban&quot; rifles can easily be fitted with a bayonet lug by fitting a pre-ban flash suppressor.

The California Assault Weapons Ban prohibits flash suppressors on all semi-automatic rifles capable of accepting a detachable magazine. As a result, Springfield Armory designed a muzzle brake, which they installed in place of the standard flash suppressor on all models that were sold in California. The muzzle brake reduces climb of the barrel, making the rifle easier to control.

==M1A/M14 select fire rifles==
Most of the M1A rifles manufactured since 1971 were made for the commercial market and thus were only capable of semi-automatic fire. Springfield Armory, Inc. and Smith Enterprise Inc. were the two companies that produced select fire M14-type rifles for civilian ownership. Up until May 1986, Springfield Armory, Inc. had a Full Auto Department at their factory in Illinois. A few M1A rifles were converted to select fire and registered with the ATF by Class II manufacturers like Neal Smith and Rock Island Armory. The receivers of these select fire rifles have the selector lug and operating rod rail cuts for the connector assembly.

==Variants==

Besides the standard M1A, Springfield Armory also produces multiple variants. The M21 Tactical and M25 White Feather have been discontinued.

===Loaded rifles===
The Loaded variants are available with either a walnut or synthetic stock, and one model comes with a Precision Adjustable Stock. All Loaded models include the following features:
* Barrel: air-gauged medium-weight National Match (available in stainless steel or Parkerized chrome moly steel), in length with a 1:11 right-hand twist.
* Front Sight: National Match .062” Military Post
* Rear Sight: GI Match Grade Non-hooded Rear Sight: Aperture .0520, Adjustable, One-half Minute for Windage and One Minute for Elevation
* Two-stage Military Trigger, Match Tuned, 
The Loaded models do not have the action glass bedded into the stock as do the National Match models.

===Match rifles===
Two M1As are advertised as match rifles, the National Match M1A and the Super Match M1A. The National Match is a more basic model, while the Super Match is more customizable has additional features on some models such as a McMillan stock and a Douglas stainless steel barrel.

===Scout Squad===
The Scout Squad is an M1A marketed toward law enforcement users. It has an barrel, a forward-mounted optical sight base, and a proprietary muzzle stabilizer. It is advertised as being optimal for Aimpoint optics, although most mounts attached to the factory accessory rail will still require a cheekrest in order to get the proper weld. It is available in both wood-stocked and synthetic furniture options with different colors of wood and synthetic stocks.

===SOCOM rifles===

The SOCOM 16 and SOCOM II are modern variants of the M14 manufactured with lighter materials. SOCOM is an abbreviation which refers to the United States Special Operations Command. These variants have a barrel that is just slightly longer than the minimum barrel length of permissible without taxing and registration under the National Firearms Act in the United States. The gas system was reworked to ensure proper operation with the shortened barrel, and a new muzzle brake was added to help soften recoil.

The SOCOM 16 was introduced in 2004, with the SOCOM II being introduced the following year; they are essentially the same except for their accessory rails. An uncommon variant called the SOCOM II Extended Cluster Rail features a longer top rail that extends over the ejection port to the stripper clip guide, allowing the operator to mount optics farther to the rear. It appears the SOCOM II was discontinued at the end of 2014. The SOCOM 16 CQB (close-quarters battle), a SOCOM 16 with a pistol grip and telescoping stock, was introduced in early 2016.

The SOCOM 16 and SOCOM II are largely identical to the standard M1A, but feature a barrel, rather than the standard model&#x27;s barrel. The specially designed muzzle brake is designed to reduce the increased recoil produced by the shorter barrel. In addition to the top accessory rail for optics, the rifle has enclosed Garand-style iron sights, with tritium inserts for low or dim light conditions. The rifle will accept any M14 magazine, with typical capacities of 5, 10, or 20 rounds.

The only difference between the SOCOM 16 and SOCOM II is the Picatinny rails. The SOCOM 16 features a short length of Picatinny rail in front of the action, above the handguard, while the SOCOM II features a continuous top Picatinny rail from just ahead of the action to the front of the handguard, and shorter lengths of rail on the sides and bottom of the handguard. The extra Picatinny rails allow for more attachments, including scopes, grips, lights, and lasers, but also means the SOCOM II weighs , compared to the SOCOM 16&#x27;s . Because the rails add weight at the front of the weapon, it is more muzzle-heavy than the SOCOM 16, making it more difficult for some users to engage multiple targets quickly.

<text>Levoča (; ; )
is the principal town of Levoča District in the Prešov Region of eastern Slovakia, with a population of 14,256. The town has a historic center with a well-preserved town wall, a Gothic church with the tallest wooden altar in the world, carved by Master Pavol of Levoča, and many other Renaissance buildings.

On 28 June 2009, Levoča was added by UNESCO to its World Heritage List.

==Geography==
Levoča lies at an altitude of above sea level and covers an area of . It is located in the northern part of the Hornád Basin at the foothills of the Levoča Hills, at the stream &quot;Levočský potok&quot;, a tributary of Hornád. Poprad is away to the west, Prešov to the east, Košice to the southeast and Bratislava to the southwest.
Nearby settlements include:
*Levočská Dolina (=English: Levoča Valley). About out of town, on the way to Závada.
*Levočské Lúky (=English: Levoča Fields). Settlement on the road to Spišska Nová Ves.
*Závada. Village in the hills above Levočská Dolina.

==Population==
The population of Levoča as of the 2021 census was 14,256.

==Etymology==
The name is of Slovak origin and belongs to the oldest recorded Slovak settlement names in Spiš. It was originally the name of the stream Lěvoča, a tributary of river Hornád (present-day Levočský potok). The name probably derived from the adjective &quot;lěva&quot; (left, a left tributary); the linguist Rudolf Krajčovič has also suggested as an origin the word &quot;lěvoča&quot; meaning &quot;regularly flooded area”.

== History ==
Levoča is located in the historical region of Spiš, which was inhabited as early as the Stone Age. In the 11th century, this region was conquered and, subsequently, became part of the Kingdom of Hungary and remained such until 1918. After the Mongol invasions of 1241/1242, the area was also settled by Germans (later known as Zipser Germans). The town became the capital of the Association of Spiš Germans, with a form of self-rule within the Kingdom of Hungary. The oldest written reference to the city of Levoča dates back to 1249. In 1317, Levoča (at that time generally known by the German name of Leutschau - see Chronology below for lists of changing names) received the status of a royal town. In 1321, a wide storing right was granted, enticing merchants, craftsmen and mine owners to settle in this town.

In the 15th century, the town, located on an intersection of trade routes between Poland and Hungary, became a rich center of commerce. It exported iron, copper, furs, leather, corn, and wine. At the same time, the town became an important cultural centre. The English humanist Leonard Cox taught around 1520 in a school in Levoča. The bookseller Brewer from Wittenberg transformed his bookstore into a prolific printing plant, that lasted for 150 years. Finally, one of the best-known medieval woodcarvers Master Pavol of Levoča settled here.

The town kept this cultural and economic status until the end of the 16th century, in spite of two damaging fires : the first in 1550 destroyed nearly all of the Gothic architecture and another in 1599. In this period of prosperity, several churches were built, and the town had a school, library, pharmacy, and physicians. There was a printing press as early as 1624. Levoča was a center of the Protestant Reformation. The town started to decline during the anti-Habsburg uprisings in the 17th century.

In a lurid sequence of events in 1700, the mayor of the town was accidentally wounded by a local nobleman during a hunt, generating a series of revenge attacks, finally resulting in the murder of the mayor, Karol Kramler, a Saxon magistrate. The mayor&#x27;s arm was then cut off, embalmed, and preserved in the town hall as a call to further revenge. This became the subject of a Hungarian novel about the town, &quot;The Black City&quot;, by the writer Kálmán Mikszáth.

At the southern end of the main square, the Evangelical Church, Levoča was constructed from 1823 onwards, and consecrated in 1832. It replaced an earlier articular church outside the walls of the city.

The economic importance of the town was diminished in 1871 when the important new Košice–Bohumín Railway was built just to the south, bypassing Levoča and going through the nearby town of Spišská Nová Ves. Later, in 1892, only a spur line was built from Spišská Nová Ves railway station to Levoča. Before the establishment of independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, Levoča was part of Szepes County within the Kingdom of Hungary. From 1939 to 1945, it was part of the Slovak Republic. On 27 January 1945, the 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps dislodged the Wehrmacht and the Hungarian Army from Levoča and it was once again part of Czechoslovakia. It is part of independent Slovakia since 1993.

On July 3, 1995, Levoča was visited by Pope John Paul II. He celebrated a Mass for 650,000 worshippers at the traditional pilgrim site of Mariánska hora, a hill about north of Levoča with views of the town.

==Historical features==

The old town is picturesquely sited and still surrounded by most of its ancient walls. In associating the town with Spiš Castle and Žehra in June 2009 as the renamed World Heritage Site of “Levoča, Spišský Hrad, and the Associated Cultural Monuments”, UNESCO cites the town&#x27;s historic center, its fortifications, and the works of Master Paul of Levoča preserved in the town.

The main entrance to the old town is via the monumental &quot;Košice Gate&quot; (15th century) behind which is located the ornate baroque Church of the Holy Spirit and the New Minorite Monastery ().

The town square (&quot;Námestie Majstra Pavla&quot; - Master Paul&#x27;s Square) boasts three major monuments; the quaint Old Town Hall (15th-17th century) which now contains a museum, the domed Evangelical Lutheran Church (1837) and the 14th century of Basilica of St. James (in Slovak: &quot;Bazilika svätého Jakuba&quot;, often mistakenly referred to in English as St. Jacob&#x27;s). It houses a magnificently carved and painted wooden Gothic altar, the tallest in the world, (), created by Master Paul around 1520. The square is very well-preserved (despite one or two modern incursions) and contains a number of striking buildings which were the townhouses of the local nobility in the late Middle Ages. Also notable in the square is the wrought iron “Cage of Shame”, dating back to the 17th century, used for public punishment of miscreants. A plaque on one of the houses records the printing and publication in the town of the most famous work of Comenius, the &quot;Orbis Pictus&quot;. Other buildings on the square house a historical museum and a museum dedicated to the work of Master Paul.

Behind the square on Kláštorská Street are the 14th-century church and remains of the old monastery of the Minorites, now incorporated into a Church grammar school. Nearby is the town&#x27;s &quot;Polish Gate&quot;, a Gothic construction of the 15th century.

From the 16th century to the end of 1922, Levoča was the administrative center of the province of Szepes (Spiš). Between 1806 – 1826, the Hungarian architect from Eger Antal Povolny built a grandiose administration building, the Large Provincial House, as the seat of the town&#x27;s administration. He adjusted its Classicist style to Levoča&#x27;s Renaissance character by emphasizing the building&#x27;s horizontal lines. The House is considered among the most beautiful Provincial Houses in the former Kingdom of Hungary. Today, it is reconstructed and it is a seat of the administration.

The State Regional Archives (&quot;Štátny oblastný archív&quot;) are in a tan stone building on the north side of the square at nám. Majstra Pavla 60.

==Jewish community==

Compared to other places in the region, Jewish settlement began comparatively late in Levoča. The city&#x27;s census data from 1768 and 1828 indicated a lack of Jewish presence, suggesting a prohibition against Jewish settlement until around 1840. The 1840s marked the beginning of Jewish migration to Levoča, mainly from Huncovce and other parts of Eastern Slovakia. This wave of migration led to the establishment of the first Jewish households and sparked the formation of a Jewish community (kehila).

During the 1870s, the kehila saw considerable expansion, leading to the incorporation of additional structures, like a cemetery, in the 1880s. In 1899, the Jewish community inaugurated an expansive synagogue, designed in an Oriental architectural style, situated beyond the city&#x27;s perimeter. Accompanying this significant structure, a school and a ritual bath, known as a mikveh, were constructed nearby.

Following Slovakia&#x27;s attainment of autonomy in October 1938, the Jewish population began to face increasing discrimination. On 4 November 1938, 55 Jewish individuals from Levoča, who lacked citizenship, were forcefully relocated to an unclaimed region along the Slovakia-Hungary border, near Plešivec. Held for several weeks without adequate shelter and under challenging conditions, the majority were able to return to their homes only through the concerted efforts of Jewish organizations.

Upon the formation of the Slovak Republic on March 14, 1939, Jewish homes and businesses were subjected to rampant looting and destruction by the Nazi-aligned German minority. A repeat of these incidents occurred on March 23, with further devastation in August when a Hashomer Hatzair summer camp was attacked and subsequently dissolved. That same year saw the revocation of licenses for numerous Jewish professionals, the closure of Jewish taverns, and dismissals from community service roles.

During World War II, 981 local Jews were deported. The first deportations began in March 1942, at first primarily targeting young women, who were sent to a transit camp in Poprad and then to Auschwitz. More young people were sent to Majdanek, via a transit camp in Žilina.

Starting in March 1942, Jews from Levoča were systematically deported to concentration and extermination camps, beginning with a group of young women sent to Auschwitz. Despite escape attempts, further rounds of deportation included families, hospital patients, and psychiatric care patients, with about 80% of the Jewish population being deported by the end of the year.

Following this wave, a small number of Jews remained in the district, some possessing exemption letters or having converted to escape deportation. However, with the German capture of Levoča in September 1944, the remaining Jews faced intensified persecution. Many were deported or executed, while others found refuge in remote areas or joined partisan groups. Despite resistance, the synagogue, mikveh, school building, and cemetery were desecrated, and widespread hunting of Jews and partisans led to further deportations and executions.

Post-war, some surviving Jews returned to Levoča, reviving kehila life and repairing public buildings. Zionist activities resumed until most Jews immigrated to Israel in 1949. By the 1960s, a small kehila of about 60 people remained, with the once-desecrated cemetery left neglected. As of 1990, only a few Jewish families resided in Levoča.

In 2016, the historic Jewish cemetery was cleared of rubbish and tidied up thanks to the collaborative efforts of local Catholic youth organization Spoločenstvo Pavol, the Slovak Association of Christian Youth Movements, the Union of Slovak Jewish Communities, and the Town of Levoča.

<doc id="609313" wikidata="Q6548615" url="?curid=609313" title="Lilydale, Victoria">
<text>Lilydale is an outer eastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 34 km east from Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Lilydale recorded a population of 17,348 at the .

Situated in the Yarra Valley, it began as a town within the former Shire of Lillydale and is also notable as the burial site of Dame Nellie Melba (Lilydale Cemetery).

It is both a residential area of metropolitan Melbourne and an industrial area on the city&#x27;s rural-urban fringe.

== Toponymy ==

Some prefer to believe the town was named after an 1852 song &quot;Lilly Dale&quot; by H. S. Thompson but evidence shows it was named after an early settler, Lilly de Castella. Most of Victoria has been named after prominent citizens or with traditional Aboriginal names. Lilly de Castella was one of four daughters of Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Anderson and his wife Mary. Joseph Anderson was one of eight nominated (non-elected) members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. Lilly was born Elizabeth Anne on Norfolk Island, where her father was commandant from 1835 to 1839. Lilly was a typical Victorian pet-name for girls named Elizabeth. The family settled in South Yarra in 1848 and were friends of Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe and his wife Sophie. Mary Anderson was a pioneer member of the Melbourne Mechanics Institute. Colonel Anderson was also a close friend of Crown Surveyor Clement Hodgkinson and was a pallbearer at the funeral of Governor Sir Charles Hotham, who died on 31 December 1855. Lilly married Paul de Castella in 1856; Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson co-owned the couple&#x27;s Yering Station. Anderson Street in Lilydale was named after the Colonel, and the parallel Castella Street was named after his son-in-law, Lilly&#x27;s husband Paul.

== History ==
 Lilydale sits on Woiwurrung territory, traditionally part of the Kulin Nation.

Lillydale township was surveyed in 1860 by Clement Hodgkinson.

The Post Office opened on 1 September 1860 as Brushy Creek, and was renamed Lillydale in 1861 and Lilydale around 1872.

The Lilydale Hotel opened in 1862. The railway came to town with the opening of the station in 1882.

The first town hall was built in 1888 along with the Mechanics Institute Free Library building.

Lilydale has an active CFA (Country Fire Authority) volunteer fire brigade, first established in 1905. There was an unregistered brigade dating back to the 1880s prior to this. The brigade also has a satellite station in Chirnside Park.

The original 1882 station building has been preserved in its original location, with the current station and bus interchange located on the opposite side of the highway.

A bus station and taxi rank operates from the railway station servicing many of Melbourne&#x27;s far eastern suburbs.

Lilydale has segregated bicycle facilities including the start of the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail which follows the course of the Lilydale-Warburton railway line which was built in 1901 but closed in 1964.

Coldstream Airport is located approximately 5 km north east in Coldstream which has a sealed, all-weather strip to service the area with recreation, charter and fire bombing flying facilities for the local community.

Box Hill Institute and the Centre for Adult Education opened their John St Lilydale Community Campus in 2015 offering the people of Lilydale and surrounding districts access to more than 20 quality accredited, short courses and pre-accredited pathway programs.

On 15 February 2016 Box Hill Institute reopened the much larger former Swinburne campus as the Lilydale Lakeside Campus offering vocational training, TAFE and higher education. The Lilydale library, a branch of Eastern Regional Libraries, is also located at the Lakeside Campus. It offers free events for all ages, including children and seniors.

<doc id="609322" wikidata="Q555325" url="?curid=609322" title="Reverse mortgage">
<text>A reverse mortgage is a mortgage loan, usually secured by a residential property, that enables the borrower to access the unencumbered value of the property. The loans are typically promoted to older homeowners and typically do not require monthly mortgage payments. Borrowers are still responsible for property taxes or homeowner&#x27;s insurance. Reverse mortgages allow older people to immediately access the equity they have built up in their homes, and defer payment of the loan until they die, sell, or move out of the home. Because there are no required mortgage payments on a reverse mortgage, the interest is added to the loan balance each month. The rising loan balance can eventually exceed the value of the home, particularly in times of declining home values or if the borrower continues to live in the home for many years. However, the borrower (or the borrower&#x27;s estate) is generally not required to repay any additional loan balance in excess of the value of the home.

Regulators and academics have given mixed commentary on the reverse mortgage market. Some economists argue that reverse mortgages may benefit the elderly by smoothing out their income and consumption patterns over time. However, regulatory authorities, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, argue that reverse mortgages are &quot;complex products and difficult for consumers to understand&quot;, especially in light of &quot;misleading advertising&quot;, low-quality counseling, and &quot;risk of fraud and other scams&quot;. Moreover, the Bureau claims that many consumers do not use reverse mortgages for the positive, consumption-smoothing purposes advanced by economists. In Canada, the borrower must seek independent legal advice before being approved for a reverse mortgage. In the United States, reverse mortgage borrowers, similarly to other mortgage borrowers, can face foreclosure if they do not maintain their homes or keep up to date on homeowner&#x27;s insurance and property taxes.

==By country==

===Australia===

==== Eligibility ====
Reverse mortgages are available in Australia. Under the Responsible Lending Laws, the National Consumer Credit Protection Act was amended in 2012 to incorporate a high level of regulation for reverse mortgage. Reverse mortgages are also regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) requiring high compliance and disclosure from lenders and advisers to all borrowers.

Borrowers should seek credit advice from an accredited reverse mortgage specialist before applying for a reverse mortgage. Anyone who wants to engage in credit activities (including lenders, lessors and brokers) must be licensed with ASIC or be a representative of someone who is licensed (that is, they must either have their own licence or come under the umbrella of another licensee as an authorised credit representative or employee) (ASIC)

Eligibility requirements vary by lender. To qualify for a reverse mortgage in Australia,
* the borrower must be over a certain age, usually 60 or 65; if the mortgage has more than one borrower, the youngest borrower must meet the age requirement
* the borrower must own the property, or the existing mortgage balance must be low enough that it will be extinguished by the reverse mortgage proceeds, thus leaving the reverse mortgage as the only debt that remains secured against the property.

==== Loan size and cost ====
Reverse mortgages in Australia can be as high as 50% of the property&#x27;s value. The exact amount of money available (loan size) is determined by several factors:
* the borrower&#x27;s age, with a higher amount available at a higher age
* current interest rates
* property value
* the property&#x27;s location
* program minimum and maximum; for example, the loan might be constrained to a minimum of $10,000 and a maximum of between $250,000 and $1,000,000 depending on the lender.
The cost of getting a reverse mortgage depends on the particular reverse mortgage program the borrower acquires. These costs are frequently rolled into the loan itself and therefore compound with the principal. Typical costs for the reverse mortgage include:
* an application fee (establishment fee) = between $0 and $950
* stamp duty, mortgage registration fees, and other government charges = vary with location

The interest rate on the reverse mortgage varies. Some programs used to offer fixed rate loans, while others offer variable rate loans. Since the update of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act in September 2012, new reverse mortgage loans are not allowed to have fixed rates.

In addition, there may be costs during the life of the reverse mortgage. A monthly service charge may be applied to the balance of the loan (for example, $12 per month), which compounds with the principal. The best products have no monthly fees.

==== Proceeds from a reverse mortgage ====
The money from a reverse mortgage can be distributed in several different ways:
* as a lump sum, in cash, at settlement;
* as a Tenure payment, a monthly cash payment;
* as a line of credit, similar to a home equity line of credit;
* as a combination of these.

==== Taxes and insurance ====
The borrower remains entirely responsible for the property. This includes physical maintenance. In addition, some programs require periodic reassessments of the value of the property.

Income from a reverse mortgage set up as an annuity or as a line of credit should not affect Government Income Support entitlements. However, income from a reverse mortgage set up as a lump sum could be considered a financial investment and thus deemed under the Income Test; this category includes all sums over $40,000 and sums under $40,000 that are not spent within 90 days.

====When the loan comes due====
Most reverse mortgages must be repaid (including all unpaid interest and fees) when they leave the home permanently. This includes when they sell the home or die. However, most reverse mortgages are owner-occupier loans only so that the borrower is not allowed to rent the property to a long-term tenant and move out. A borrower should check this if he thinks he wants to rent his property and move somewhere else.

A common misconception is that when the borrower dies or leaves the home (e.g., goes to an aged-care facility or moves somewhere else) the house must be sold. This is not the case; the loan must be repaid. Thus, the beneficiaries of the estate may decide to repay the reverse mortgage from other sources, sale of other assets, or even refinancing to a normal mortgage or, if they qualify, another reverse mortgage.

Prepayment of the loan—when the borrower pays the loan back before it reaches term—may incur penalties, depending on the loan. An additional fee could also be imposed in the event of a redraw. Under the National Credit Code, penalties for early repayment are illegal on new loans since September 2012; however, a bank may charge a reasonable administration fee for preparation of the discharge of mortgage.

All reverse mortgages written since September 2012 must have a &quot;No Negative Equity Guarantee&quot;. This means that if the balance of the loan exceeds the proceeds of sale of the property, no claim for this excess will be made against the estate or other beneficiaries of the borrower.

On 18 September 2012, the government introduced statutory &#x27;negative equity protection&#x27; on all new reverse mortgage contracts. This means the borrower cannot end up owing the lender more than their home is worth (the market value or equity). In a reverse mortgage begun before 18 September 2012, the contract specifies whether the borrower is protected when the loan balance ends up being more than the value of the property.

When the reverse mortgage contract ends and the borrower&#x27;s home is sold, the lender will receive the proceeds of the sale and the borrower cannot be held liable for any debt in excess of this (except in certain circumstances, such as fraud or misrepresentation). Where the property sells for more than the amount owed to the lender, the borrower or his estate will receive the extra funds.

=== Canada ===
According to the October 2018 filings of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), an independent federal agency reporting to the Minister of Finance in that month, the outstanding reverse mortgage debt for Canadians soared to $CDN3.42 billion, setting a new record for both the monthly and the annual increases. Daniel Wong at &quot;Better Dwelling&quot; wrote that, the jump represented an 11.57% increase from September, which is the second biggest increase since 2010, 844% more than the median monthly pace of growth. The annual increase of 57.46% is 274% larger than the median annualized pace of growth.

Reverse mortgages in Canada are available through three financial institutions - Home Equity Bank, Equitable Bank and Bloom Financial. No reverse mortgages issued in Canada are insured by the government due to the nature of the product.

The cost of getting a reverse mortgage from a private sector lender may exceed the costs of other types of mortgage or equity conversion loans. Exact costs depend on the particular reverse mortgage program the borrower acquires and vary from lender to lender. Depending on the program, there may be other costs.

Money received in a reverse mortgage is still considered a loan and therefore is not taxable income. It therefore does not affect government benefits from Old Age Security (OAS) or Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The reverse mortgage comes due—the loan plus interest must be repaid—when the borrower dies, sells the property, or moves out of the house. Depending on the program, the reverse mortgage may be transferable to a different property if the owner moves. Prepayment of the loan—when the borrower pays the loan back before it reaches term—may incur penalties, depending on the program.

=== United States ===
The FHA-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage, or HECM, was signed into law on February 5, 1988, by President Ronald Reagan as part of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. The first HECM was given to Marjorie Mason of Fairway, Kansas, in 1989 by James B. Nutter and Company.

In the United States, the FHA-insured HECM (home equity conversion mortgage), a.k.a. reverse mortgage, is a non-recourse loan. In simple terms, the borrowers are not responsible to repay any loan balance that exceeds the net-sales proceeds of their home. For example, if the last borrower left the home and the loan balance on their FHA-insured reverse mortgage was $125,000, and the home sold for $100,000, neither the borrower nor their heirs would be responsible for the $25,000 on the reverse mortgage loan that exceeded the value of their home. The extra $25,000 would be paid from the FHA insurance that was purchased when the HECM loan was originated. A reverse mortgage cannot go upside down. The cost of the FHA mortgage insurance is a one-time fee of 2% of the appraised value of the home, and an annual fee of 0.5% of the outstanding loan balance.

According to a 2015 article in the &quot;Journal of Urban Economics&quot;, about 12% of the United States HECM reverse mortgage borrowers defaulted on &quot;their property taxes or homeowners insurance&quot;—a &quot;relatively high default rate&quot;. However, the data was derived from participants during 2006–2011 and compared them to homeowners with forward mortgages and not homeowners without a mortgage. This research caused a reform in reverse mortgages in 2013: homeowners could only withdraw 60% of their available proceeds in the first year. The retired population normally does not have the same level of income to afford increases in taxes and insurance as individuals with a traditional mortgage. In the United States, reverse mortgage borrowers as well as any homeowner can face foreclosure if they do not maintain their homes or keep up to date on homeowner&#x27;s insurance and property taxes. The FBI, Inspector General, and HUD urge American consumers, especially senior citizens, to be cautious when considering reverse mortgages to avoid scams. HUD specifically warns consumers to &quot;beware of scam artists that charge thousands of dollars for information that is free from HUD&quot;.

In a 2018 study, reverse mortgage borrowers have significantly higher financial and housing satisfaction compared to nonborrowers. Reverse mortgages received fewer complaints than any other mortgage product. Among a total of 32,000 consumer complaints received by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in 2021, only approximately 300 of those complaints — under 1% — had to do with reverse mortgage loans.

====Eligibility====
To qualify for the HECM reverse mortgage in the United States, borrowers generally must be at least 62 years of age and the home must be their primary residence (second homes and investment properties do not qualify).

On April 25, 2014, FHA revised the HECM age eligibility requirements to extend certain protections to spouses younger than age 62. Under the old guidelines, the reverse mortgage could only be written for the spouse who was 62 or older. If the older spouse died, the reverse mortgage balance became due and payable if the younger surviving spouse was left off of the HECM loan. If this younger spouse was unable to pay off or refinance the reverse mortgage balance, he or she was forced either to sell the home or lose it to foreclosure. This often created a significant hardship for spouses of deceased HECM mortgagors, so FHA revised the eligibility requirements in Mortgagee Letter 2014-07. Under the new guidelines, spouses who are younger than age 62 at the time of origination retain the protections offered by the HECM program if the older spouse who got the mortgage dies. This means that the surviving spouse can remain living in the home without having to repay the reverse mortgage balance as long as he or she keeps up with property taxes and homeowner&#x27;s insurance and maintains the home to a reasonable level.

For a reverse mortgage to be a viable financial option, existing mortgage balances usually must be low enough to be paid off with the reverse mortgage proceeds. However, borrowers do have the option of paying down their existing mortgage balance to qualify for a HECM reverse mortgage.

The HECM reverse mortgage follows the standard FHA eligibility requirements for property type, meaning most 1–4 family dwellings, FHA-approved condominiums, and PUDs qualify. Manufactured homes also qualify as long as they meet FHA standards.

Before starting the loan process for an FHA/HUD-approved reverse mortgage, applicants must take an approved counseling course. An approved counselor should help explain how reverse mortgages work, the financial and tax implications of taking out a reverse mortgage, payment options, and costs associated with a reverse mortgage. The counseling is meant to protect borrowers, although the quality of counseling has been criticized by groups such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

In a 2010 survey of elderly Americans, 48% of respondents cited financial difficulties as the primary reason for obtaining a reverse mortgage and 81% stated a desire to remain in their current homes until death.

==== Amount of proceeds available ====
The total pool of money that a borrower can receive from a HECM reverse mortgage is called the principal limit (PL), which is calculated based on the maximum claim amount (MCA), the age of the youngest borrower, the expected interest rate (EIR), and a table to PL factors published by HUD. Similar to loan-to-value (LTV) in the forward mortgage world, the principal limit is essentially the percentage of the value of the home that can be lent under the FHA HECM guidelines. Most PLs are typically in the range of 50% to 60% of the MCA, but they can sometimes be higher or lower. The table below gives examples of principal limits for various ages and EIRs and a property value of $250,000.

==== Options for distribution of proceeds ====
The money from a reverse mortgage can be distributed in four ways, based on the borrower&#x27;s financial needs and goals:
* Lump sum in cash at settlement 
* Monthly payment (loan advance) for a set number of years (term) or life (tenure)
* Line of credit (similar to a home equity line of credit)
* Some combination of the above
The adjustable-rate HECM offers all of the above payment options, but the fixed-rate HECM only offers lump sum.

The line of credit option accrues growth, meaning that whatever is available and unused on the line of credit will automatically grow larger at a compounding rate. This means that borrowers who opt for a HECM line of credit can potentially gain access to more cash over time than what they initially qualified for at origination.

The line of credit growth rate is determined by adding 1.25% to the initial interest rate (IIR), which means the line of credit will grow faster if the interest rate on the loan increases.

On 3 September 2013 HUD implemented Mortgagee Letter 2013-27, which made significant changes to the amount of proceeds that can be distributed within the first year of the loan. Because many borrowers were taking full draw lump sums (often at the encouragement of lenders) at closing and burning through the money quickly, HUD sought to protect borrowers and the viability of the HECM program by limiting the amount of proceeds that can be accessed within the first 12 months of the loan.

If the total mandatory obligations (which includes existing mortgage balances, all closing costs, delinquent federal debts, and purchase transaction costs) to be paid by the reverse mortgage are less than 60% of the principal limit, then the borrower can draw additional proceeds up to 60% of the principal limit in the first 12 months. Any remaining available proceeds can be accessed after 12 months.

If the total mandatory obligations exceed 60% of the principal limit, then the borrower can draw an additional 10% of the principal limit if available.

====HECM for purchase====
The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 provided HECM mortgagors with the opportunity to purchase a new principal residence with HECM loan proceeds — the so-called &quot;HECM for Purchase&quot; program, effective January 2009. The &quot;HECM for Purchase&quot; applies if &quot;the borrower is able to pay the difference between the HECM and the sales price and closing costs for the property. The program was designed to allow the elderly to purchase a new principal residence and obtain a reverse mortgage within a single transaction by eliminating the need for a second closing. Texas was the last state to allow for reverse mortgages for purchase.

====Taxes and insurance====
Unlike traditional forward mortgages, there are no escrow accounts in the reverse mortgage world. Property taxes and homeowners insurance are paid by the homeowner on their own, which is a requirement of the HECM program (along with the payment of other property charges such as HOA dues).

===== Life expectancy set aside (LESA) =====
If a reverse mortgage applicant fails to meet the satisfactory credit or residual income standards required under the new financial assessment guidelines implemented by FHA on March 2, 2015, the lender may require a Life Expectancy Set Aside, or LESA. A LESA carves out a portion of the reverse mortgage benefit amount for the payment of property taxes and insurance for the borrower&#x27;s expected remaining life span. FHA implemented the LESA to reduce defaults based on the nonpayment of property taxes and insurance.

==== Taxability of HECM proceeds ====
The American Bar Association guide advises that generally,
* The Internal Revenue Service does not consider loan advances to be income.
* Annuity advances may be partially taxable.
* Interest charged is not deductible until it is actually paid, that is, at the end of the loan.
* The mortgage insurance premium is deductible on the 1040 long form.
* The money used from a reverse mortgage is not taxable.

The money received from a reverse mortgage is considered a loan advance. It therefore is not taxable and does not directly affect Social Security or Medicare benefits. However, an American Bar Association guide to reverse mortgages explains that if borrowers receive Medicaid, SSI, or other public benefits, loan advances will be counted as &quot;liquid assets&quot; if the money is kept in an account (savings, checking, etc.) past the end of the calendar month in which it is received; the borrower could lose eligibility for such public programs if total liquid assets (cash, generally) is then greater than those programs allow.

==== When the loan comes due ====
The HECM reverse mortgage is not due and payable until the last borrower (or non-borrowing spouse) dies, sells the house, or fails to live in the home for a period greater than 12 months. The loan may also become due and payable if the borrower fails to pay property taxes or homeowners insurance, lets the condition of the home significantly deteriorate, or transfers the title of the property to a non-borrower (excluding trusts that meet HUD&#x27;s requirements).

==== Volume of loans ====
Home Equity Conversion Mortgages account for 90% of all reverse mortgages originated in the U.S. As of May 2010, there were 493,815 active HECM loans. As of 2006, the number of HECM mortgages that HUD is authorized to insure under the reverse mortgage law was capped at 275,000. However, through the annual appropriations acts, Congress has temporarily extended HUD&#x27;s authority to insure HECMs notwithstanding the statutory limits.

Program growth in recent years has been very rapid. In fiscal year 2001, 7,781 HECM loans were originated. By the fiscal year ending in September 2008, the annual volume of HECM loans topped 112,000 representing a 1,300% increase in six years. For the fiscal year ending September 2011, loan volume had contracted in the wake of the financial crisis, but remained at over 73,000 loans that were originated and insured through the HECM program.

Since the HECM program was created analysts have expected loan volume to grow further as the U.S. population ages. In 2000, the Census Bureau estimated that 34 million of the country&#x27;s 270 million residents were sixty-five years of age or older, while projecting the two totals to rise to 62 and 337 million, respectively, in 2025. In addition, the Center For Retirement Research at Boston College estimates that more than half of retirees “may be unable to maintain their standard of living in retirement.”. The low adoption rates can be partially explained by dysfunctional aspects of the reverse mortgage market, including high markups, complexity of the product, consumer distrust of reverse mortgage lenders, and lack of pricing transparency.

===Hong Kong===
Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC), a government sponsored entity similar to that of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the US, provides credit enhancement service to commercial banks that originate reverse mortgage. Besides providing liquidity to the banks by securitization, HKMC can offer guarantee of reverse mortgage principals up to a certain percentage of the loan value. As of 2016, reverse mortgage is available to house-owners aged 55 or above from 10 different banks. Applicants can also boost the loan value by pledging their in-the-money life insurance policies to the bank. In terms of the use of proceed, applicants are allowed to make one-off withdrawal to pay for property maintenance, medical and legal costs, in addition to the monthly payout.

===Taiwan===
A trial program for reverse mortgages was launched in 2013 by the Financial Supervisory Commission, Ministry of the Interior. Taiwan Cooperative Bank was the first bank to offer such a product. As of June 2017, reverse mortgages are available from a total of 10 financial institutions. However, social stigma associated with not preserving real estate for inheritance has prevented reverse mortgages from widespread adoption.

==Criticism==
Reverse mortgages have been criticized for several major shortcomings:
*Possible high up-front costs make reverse mortgages expensive. In the United States, entering a reverse mortgage will cost approximately the same as a traditional FHA mortgage, depending on the loan-to-value ratio.
* The interest rate on a reverse mortgage may be higher than on a conventional &quot;forward mortgage&quot;.
* Interest compounds over the life of a reverse mortgage, which means that &quot;the mortgage can quickly balloon&quot;. Since no monthly payments are made by the borrower on a reverse mortgage, the interest that accrues is treated as a loan advance. Each month, interest is calculated not only on the principal amount received by the borrower, but on the interest previously assessed to the loan. Because of this compound interest, as a reverse mortgage&#x27;s length grows, it becomes more likely to deplete the entire equity of the property. However, with an FHA-insured HECM reverse mortgage obtained in the United States or any reverse mortgage obtained in Canada, the borrower can never owe more than the value of the property and cannot pass on any debt from the reverse mortgage to any heirs. The sole remedy the lender has is the collateral, not assets in the estate, if applicable.
* Reverse mortgages can be confusing; many obtain them without fully understanding the terms and conditions, and a 2012 U.S. report suggests that some lenders have sought to take advantage of this complexity to offer contracts that disadvantage homeowners. A majority of respondents to a 2000 survey of elderly Americans failed to understand the financial terms of reverse mortgages very well when securing their reverse mortgages. &quot;In the past, government investigations and consumer advocacy groups raised significant consumer protection concerns about the business practices of reverse mortgage lenders and other companies in the reverse mortgage industry.&quot; In a 2006 survey of borrowers by AARP, ninety-three percent said their reverse mortgage had a mostly positive effect on their lives, compared with three percent who said the effect was mostly negative. Some ninety-three percent of borrowers reported that they were satisfied with their experiences with lenders, and ninety-five percent reported that they were satisfied with the counselors that they were required to see.

<doc id="609325" wikidata="Q6817713" url="?curid=609325" title="Menzies Creek, Victoria">
<text>Menzies Creek is a town in Victoria, Australia, 40 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shires of Cardinia and Yarra Ranges local government areas. Menzies Creek recorded a population of 966 at the 2021 census.

Menzies&#x27; Creek Post Office opened on 2 May 1887 and closed in 1980.

Menzies Creek railway station opened on 18 December 1900 with the opening of the Gembrook line. The station name was changed to Aura on 5 December 1904—while the Post Office remained Menzies Creek—but reverted to Menzies Creek on 4 July 1947.

The area is named after James Menzies, a gold digger in the 1860s, who worked the area for many years and is believed to be buried locally.

<doc id="609326" wikidata="Q925288" url="?curid=609326" title="National Hockey League Players' Association">
<text>The National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA, ) is the labour union for the group of professional hockey players who are under Standard Player Contracts to the 32 member clubs in the National Hockey League (NHL) located in the United States and Canada. The association represents its membership in all matters dealing with their working conditions and contractual rights as well as serving as their exclusive collective bargaining agent.

== History ==

=== First organizing efforts (1957–1959) ===

The first NHLPA was formed in 1957, led by Ted Lindsay of the Detroit Red Wings and Doug Harvey of the Montreal Canadiens, after the league had refused to release pension plan financial information. The owners sabotaged the certification of the union by, in part, trading players involved with the association or sending them to the minor leagues. After an out-of-court settlement over several players&#x27; issues, the players disbanded the organization. Lindsay&#x27;s struggle and the NHL&#x27;s union busting efforts are dramatized in the movie &quot;Net Worth&quot;.

=== Alan Eagleson era (1967–1991) ===
The association formed in June 1967, when representatives of the six NHL teams met and elected Bob Pulford their first president and appointed Alan Eagleson as its executive director.

To prevent the new NHLPA from suffering the fate of its predecessor, Pulford met with the owners of the NHL teams and demanded they recognize the new union or the union would seek official recognition from the Canadian Industrial Relations Board (CIRB). 

Additionally, the players sought guarantees where no member of the new union would be punished for being a member. The owners acceded. 

In return, the NHLPA agreed it should represent at least two-thirds of the active players in the NHL and that the players would refrain from striking for the duration of the agreement, so long as the owners did not contravene any terms or conditions.

=== Bob Goodenow era (1992–2005) ===
Eagleson stayed on until the end of 1991, when the players replaced him with Bob Goodenow. Eagleson went on to face criminal charges relating to his conduct during the time he worked at the NHLPA, and ultimately, on January 6, 1998, pleaded guilty in a Boston court to three counts of fraud, agreeing also to pay a fine of CA$1,000,000. The following day in Toronto, Eagleson pleaded guilty to another three counts of fraud and was sentenced to 18 months in jail.

Bob Goodenow would seek to restore respect and honour to the association during his successful 13 years of service to the players as executive director. He led all NHLPA members through the strike of 1992, which most notably gave players the rights to the marketing of their own images. In 1994–95, he was at the helm as the players endured a lockout, ensuring that a fair deal was reached. A decade later, in 2004–05, the owners locked out the players again, becoming the first professional sports league to cancel an entire season. Goodenow would depart following the lockout, notifying the players of his resignation in July 2005.

=== Ted Saskin era (2005–2007) ===
As Goodenow stepped down, the members of the association turned to long-time NHLPA Senior Director Ted Saskin as his successor, drawing on his experience within the association.

The NHLPA Executive Board terminated the employment of Saskin as executive director and general counsel on May 10, 2007, following alleged acts of misconduct. Toronto employment lawyer Chris Paliare concluded Saskin and executive Ken Kim, beginning in September 2005 through January 2007, covertly accessed player email accounts.

=== Paul Kelly era (2007–2009) ===
On June 28, 2007, the NHLPA&#x27;s executive board selected Michael Cammalleri (Calgary Flames), Chris Chelios (retired), Shawn Horcoff (Edmonton Oilers), Eric Lindros (retired) and Robyn Regehr (retired) to form a search committee for a new executive director. With the assistance of Reilly Partners, an executive search firm from Chicago, the search committee would review the resumes of hundreds of candidates.

The committee would ultimately recommend that Paul V. Kelly, a founding partner of Kelly, Libby and Hoopes law firm in Boston, become the fourth executive director since the NHLPA&#x27;s inception in 1967. Through a secret ballot system, the Player Representatives voted in favour of the committee&#x27;s recommendation, and Kelly would be introduced at a media conference on October 24, 2007.

On December 7, 2007, the NHLPA and the David Suzuki Foundation decided to create a pact, led by Boston Bruins defenceman Andrew Ference, which had over 500 NHL players signed up to donate $290 annually to purchase carbon credits in order to offset their regular season travel.

On August 31, 2009, Paul Kelly was fired from the NHLPA.

On October 30, 2009, interim Executive Director Ian Penny resigned.

=== Donald Fehr era (2010–2023) ===

Following Ian Penny&#x27;s resignation, board members, such as Steve Larmer, also resign. In late August 2010, it was widely speculated that former Major League Baseball Players Association Executive Director Donald Fehr would be appointed to this position. However, a day after the speculation reached a climax on August 26, both NHLPA interim director Mike Ouellet and deputy commissioner and chief legal officer of the NHL Bill Daly disputed the claims that it is all hearsay, and nothing is concrete between the NHLPA and Donald Fehr. However, Fehr would be formally named as executive director later in 2010.

On January 6, 2012, the NHLPA rejected a proposal for realignment in the league for beginning in the 2012–13 season, which impacted CBA discussions.

On September 15, 2012, with no agreement being reached on a new CBA, the owners locked out the players, thus threatening the start of the 2012–13 NHL season. Three months later, on December 14, the NHL filed a class action suit with the U.S. District Court in New York seeking to establish the lockout was legal. They also filed an unfair labor practice charge with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, stating the union had been negotiating in bad faith and their threat to disclaim interest is a negotiating ploy which violates the collective bargaining process. On December 21, a person told the Associated Press a vote was cast to give the NHLPA executive board a chance to file a disclaimer of interest, with the vote in favor 706–22. The board had until January 2, 2013, to file the disclaimer, in which then the union would have dissolved and became a trade organization, which would have allowed players to file antitrust lawsuits against the NHL.

On January 6, the NHLPA reached a tentative agreement with the NHL to end the lockout. The NHLPA then approved a league proposal for realignment in the league beginning in the 2013–14 season.

In 2023, it was announced Fehr would be replaced as Executive Director by former United States Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh.

== Organization ==
While the management of daily operations is the responsibility of the NHLPA Executive Director, the ultimate control over all NHLPA activities resides with the players, who each year elect representatives in order to form an executive board. Each of the 32 teams has one representative on the board.

<text>Millgrove is a town in Victoria, Australia, located east of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Millgrove recorded a population of 1,666 at the .

== Overview ==
Millgrove is located on either side of the Warburton Highway, between Wesburn and Warburton.

The Post Office opened on 7 November 1906, four years after the opening of the town&#x27;s railway station on 13 November 1901 on the Warburton line.

Millgrove remained a timber-milling and agricultural town, with occasional tourism and fishing, until the 1960s and 1970s. Despite the closure of the railway in 1965, cars placed Millgrove within acceptable commuting distances of larger towns.

Millgrove has a public reserve, a small shopping area (Mt Little Joe Nursery, a small general store, bakery, newsagent, fish and chips, church drop in centre), saw mill, a primary school, Millwarra PS, which shares campuses with Warburton East and a pre-school. There are two churches, Millgrove Baptist and River Valley Church of Christ. River Valley has a drop-in centre and emergency relief provision in the shopping strip and manages the Millwarra Community Building located at the school. The Community Building is a 300-seat auditorium and half court basketball stadium.

The former railway line is now a walking and cycling track.

A free community lunch (Good Tucker Day) is held in the reserve opposite the saw mill each Tuesday and there is a residents group (Millgrove Residents Action Group MRAG) as well as an environment group, MERG. Millgrove has an active and dedicated fire brigade (CFA). The fire station is opposite the saw mill and is also a purpose-built community fire refuge. Millgrove hosts a moving ANZAC Dawn service that attracts in excess of 500 people with breakfast provided by the Wesburn-Millgrove Fire Brigade.

Located beneath the forested mountains of Donna Buang, Ben Cairn and Mount Little Joe, near the Yarra River, Millgrove is a very scenic location. Often neglected by tourists (in favour of the larger, more affluent and tourist-oriented town of Warburton), it offers cycling, canoeing and bushwalking opportunities. It is also the location of Melbourne High School&#x27;s school camps.

Together with Warburton, Millgrove has an Australian Rules football team (Warburton Millgrove) competing in the Yarra Valley Mountain District Football League and a junior soccer club and soccer ground next to the pre school.

<doc id="609336" wikidata="Q719852" url="?curid=609336" title="Missouri Coteau">
<text>The Missouri Coteau, or Missouri Plateau, () is a large plateau that stretches along the eastern side of the valley of the Missouri River in central North Dakota and north-central South Dakota in the United States. In the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta this physiographic region is classified as the Uplands Missouri Coteau, which is a part of the Great Plains Province or Alberta Plateau Region, which extends across the southwest corner of the province of Saskatchewan as well as the southeast corner of the province of Alberta. Historically, in Canada the area was known as the Palliser&#x27;s Triangle and regarded as an extension of the Great American Desert and unsuitable for agriculture and thus designated by Canadian geographer and explorer John Palliser. The terrain of the Missouri Coteau features low hummocky, undulating, rolling hills, potholes, and grasslands.
Apart from being a geographical area, the Missouri Coteau also has a cultural connection to the people of the area, the Métis people of South Dakota, along with other Indigenous groups. The history of this plateau is large, and the Missouri Coteau has a significance to these people.
== Land and soil ==
Geologically, the plateau is part of the extended plateau of the Great Plains in the Dakotas, and is separated from the main plateau to the west by the Missouri River Trench. The plateau is underlain by Pierre Shale covered with hardened deposits from repeated glaciations. The plateau also contains deposits of lignite, mirabilite (sodium sulfate), and bentonite. While subjected to continental glaciation, it was north and west of the Driftless Area, an area which escaped glaciation. Agriculturally, The Missouri Coteau is known for grains and livestock agriculture, because the land cannot sustain many other forms of agriculture or farming.

==Agriculture and growing conditions==
The Missouri Coteau is known for being an area with difficult growing and agricultural conditions, and this is because of the weather and specific soil conditions of the land that makes growing a difficulty for this area. The plateau is poorly drained and is interspersed with glacial water deposits. This is because of the poor drainage in the area, and the plateau’s close proximity to the Prairie Pothole Region. It is transversed by several broad sags marking the ancient stream valleys of the eastern continuations of the Grand, Moreau, Cheyenne, Bad, and White rivers. To the east of the plateau, the lowland valley of the James River was formed by the lobe of the most recent ice age, separating the plateau from the Coteau des Prairies substantially. This specific area is also attached to the Canadian Prairies, with forests and elevated areas remaining at a minimum on these flat lands.

<doc id="609342" wikidata="Q1345983" url="?curid=609342" title="Hard palate">
<text>The hard palate is a thin horizontal bony plate made up of two bones of the facial skeleton, located in the roof of the mouth. The bones are the palatine process of the maxilla and the horizontal plate of palatine bone. The hard palate spans the alveolar arch formed by the alveolar process that holds the upper teeth (when these are developed).

==Structure==
The hard palate is formed by the palatine process of the maxilla and horizontal plate of palatine bone. It forms a partition between the nasal passages and the mouth. On the anterior portion of the hard palate are the &quot;plicae&quot;, irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help hold food while the teeth are biting into it while also facilitating the movement of food backward towards the larynx once pieces have been bitten off. This partition is continued deeper into the mouth by a fleshy extension called the soft palate.

On the ventral surface of the hard palate, some projections or transverse ridges are present which are called palatine rugae.

==Function==
The hard palate is important for feeding and speech. Mammals with a defective hard palate may die shortly after birth due to inability to suckle. It is also involved in mastication in many species. The interaction between the tongue and the hard palate is essential in the formation of certain speech sounds, notably high-front vowels, palatal consonants, and retroflex consonants such as [i] like &quot;see&quot;, like &quot;yes&quot;, [ç] (realization of /hj/ in English) like &quot;hue&quot;, and [ɻ] (/r/, only for some speakers) like &quot;red&quot;.

==Clinical significance==

===Cleft palate===
In the birth defect called cleft palate, the left and right portions of this plate are not joined, forming a gap between the mouth and nasal passage (a related defect affecting the face is cleft lip).

While a cleft palate has a severe impact upon the ability to nurse and speak, it is now successfully treated through reconstructive surgical procedures at an early age. This is the time where such procedures are available.

Due to the complexity of this birth defect, researchers still do not know exactly what causes the cleft palate to form during foetal development. Recently, these researchers found that even though there is no exact cause, there are several factors that drastically increase the risk of a baby being born with an orofacial cleft palate. As for the environmental risk factors, maternal smoking is the most influential risk factor. Based on a recent study of 103 German patients with cleft palates, it was found that 25.2% of their mothers smoked during pregnancy, a higher proportion than for the population as a whole.

While maternal smoking during pregnancy is a risk, there are also several genetic risk factors. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the PAX7 gene are implicated in the development of facial features. These variations occur at six loci: 1p36, 2p21, 3p11.1, 8q21.3, 13q31.1 and 15q22. When tested in the European and Asian communities, five of the six loci had a significant association at the 95% confidence level. Besides the PAX 7 gene variants, there were also five possible mutations found in the transforming growth factor-alpha gene (&quot;TGFA&quot;) that could lead to the development of a cleft palate. Even though several risk factors have been linked to cleft palates, more research must be done in order to determine the true causes of the defect.

===Palatal abscess===
Palatal abscesses may also occur.

=== Hard palate pigmentation ===
Long-term use of the drug chloroquine diphosphatase, used in malaria prophylaxis, rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions, was found to cause bluish-grey pigmentation in the hard palate.

<text>Monbulk is a town in Victoria, Australia, 42 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Monbulk recorded a population of 3,651 at the 2021 census.

The town is the home of the Monbulk Rangers Soccer Club, Monbulk Cricket Club and Monbulk Football and Netball Club.

==History==
The town&#x27;s name is believed to have been derived from the Wurundjeri word Monbolok or Monbolac, which means &quot;hiding place in the hills&quot; or &quot;sanctuary in the hills&quot;. Early in the initial period of European colonisation, Europeans referred to the area as the Dandenong Forest Village Settlement. A town was established in 1893, and comprised 76 farms across 10-acres or 40,000m2. When the Parish of Monbulk was established, the town&#x27;s name was changed to what it is today. The town’s abundance of rich fertile soils led to the foundation of a number farms and orchards, growing fruits and vegetables, as well as cut flowers. A number of businesses took advantage of the rich soils, and focused their production on jams and preserves, such as the Monbulk Jam Factory, established in 1897.

The town&#x27;s first school, Monbulk Primary School, was established in 1897, and by 1906 three churches had been built in the town. The town has been affected by bushfires throughout its history, with the Monbulk Primary School razed by fire in 1913. The town was again affected by bushfires in 1944. Monbulk continued to grow throughout the later half of the 20th century, growing from a post-war population of 781 in 1947, to 3,577 people at the most recent census. The town continues to be a centre of agricultural activity, with the nursery production and floriculture production industries both representing the two most common industries of employment for residents of Monbulk as of 2016.
In the 1950s, Ivan Southall, built a house at Blackwood Farm, on Old Emerald Road, Monbulk.
His children&#x27;s novels Ash Road and Hills End were written there and set in the area.

== Economy ==
Monbulk is one of the many towns of the Yarra Ranges that is known for its agricultural production. Most notably, the town&#x27;s two largest sources of employment are in nursery production and floriculture production. Monbulk is also the location of the headquarters and growing facilities for Australia&#x27;s largest online nursery and mail order garden supplier, Garden Express. The state&#x27;s oldest wholesale flower company in continual operation, Tesselaar Flowers, is also located in Monbulk.

== Geography ==
Monbulk is located 42 kilometres east of Melbourne, 7 kilometres north-east of Belgrave and 7 kilometres south-east of Mount Dandenong. Monbulk shares a border with Silvan to the north, Macclesfield to the east, Olinda to the west, and The Patch and Kallista to the south. The soils found in Monbulk are highly regarded for their drainage ability and low erodibility.

===Climate===

Monbulk experiences a warm summer Temperate climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) and receives an average rainfall higher than that of nearby Melbourne. 
== Monbulk Jam ==

Established in 1897, the Monbulk Co-operative Fruitgrowers&#x27; Association was one of the most successful fruits and preserves company in the area, with the jams produced by the company becoming a common household item through much of the 20th century. Co-founded by Daniel Camm, the co-operative constructed their own pulping and tinning facilities, to overcome issues with transporting raw product over the ranges and into Melbourne. The jams produced by the company were used during World War Two, after the company secured a contract to supply the armed forces of both Australia and Britain.

By the 1970s, the company was producing more than 5 million kilograms of jam per year, at which point the ownership of the company exchanged hands, eventually transferring to the Shepparton Fruit Preserving Company. The factory in Monbulk was eventually closed in 1991.

<doc id="609347" wikidata="Q577173" url="?curid=609347" title="Walther P99">
<text>The Walther P99 () is a semi-automatic pistol developed by the German company Carl Walther GmbH Sportwaffen of Ulm for law enforcement, security forces and the civilian shooting market as a replacement for the Walther P5 and the P88. The P99 and its variants are also made under licence by Fabryka Broni Radom.

==History==
Design work on this new generation sidearm began in 1994, and the handgun was presented in 1997 with series production commencing that same year. The weapon was first introduced chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum.

The pistol is used by the German Police in North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate and has been ordered by Bremen, Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, the Polish Police and the Finnish Army&#x27;s special forces and military police, where it carries the designation PIST 2003 (&quot;Pistooli 2003&quot;). The Walther P99Q was also chosen in 2012 to replace older pistols and revolvers of the Finnish Police, Customs and Border Guard. This gun has also been chosen to replace the Walther P5 of the Dutch Police in 2013. In 2014 the Walther P99Q was also chosen to replace the Makarov PM of the Estonian Police and Border Guard Board. Walther announced the discontinuation of the P99 in early 2023.

==Product evolution==
The Walther P99 was modified several times throughout its production history, as were the magazines. When the P99 was introduced the magazine capacities were 16 rounds for 9×19mm Parabellum and 12 rounds for .40 S&amp;W. Magazines had witness holes on both sides. Later the magazine capacities were reduced to 15 rounds for 9×19mm Parabellum and 11 rounds for .40 S&amp;W while witness holes were introduced at the rear of the magazine to view the loading condition.

===Second generation models===
Walther presented a redesigned second generation P99 in 2004, incorporating a modified trigger guard that eliminated the &quot;ski hump&quot;, which is clearly visible in the accompanying first generation images. This was done to address user comfort concerns regarding the previous style. The first generation P99 pistols had a slide release at the left side of the frame while second generation guns may have optional ambidextrous slide stop release levers. Walther also took the opportunity to redesign the slide so the user could grip it more easily, and notably, change the proprietary accessory rail to a Weaver type. Some models built in 2005 and all later models received one more design change, an elongated magazine release.

==Design details==
The Walther P99 is a short recoil-operated locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The P99 has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools.

It uses an internal striker as opposed to an external hammer, with a red-painted striker tip that protrudes from rear of the slide when the gun is cocked, as well as a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide.

The original, first-generation P99 had a traditional Double-Action/Single-Action trigger with a decocker. When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon loading, the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot and the Anti-Stress mode is activated, where the striker is cocked but the trigger has the length of pull of the double-action mode. The trigger travel is long in the Anti-Stress mode, but most of the length is slack and is similar in feel to a two-stage rifle trigger. At the end of the anti-stress travel, the pressure noticeably increases to 4.5 pounds and the user experiences a crisp trigger break and an extremely short trigger reset of about .1 inches. All subsequent shots are fired in standard single action mode, where the slack on the trigger is much shorter, but the point of release feels the same. In order to deactivate Single-Action or Anti-Stress mode, the user can manipulate the decocker button on the top of the slide, just in front of the rear sights. When decocked from Single-Action mode, the trigger will reset to the full length of its pull. The pistol is now in Double-Action mode with a pull 7.9 pounds for the full length of the .55 inch pull. After firing the first shot in Double-Action, the pistol will be fired in Single-Action for all subsequent shots.

The striker protrudes visibly and palpably from the back of the slide when the firearm is in a constant partially cocked state.
However, the striker of the second generation P99QA variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, unless fired, as the firearm is in a constant partially cocked state.

Ergonomics were a key focus in the design of the firearm, and as a result, three interchangeable grip backstraps are included (small, medium and large) to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm. This adaptable grip was innovative at the time the P99 was introduced.

The slide and other metal parts of the pistol are Tenifer treated (a nitriding process also used on Glock pistols). The Tenifer finish is between in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth. The Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, non-glare surface with a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications), making the P99 particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.

The P99 features four internal safeties, iron sights adjustable for both windage and elevation, tool-less take down, and an ambidextrous magazine release incorporated into the trigger guard. The lower forward edge of the frame also known as the dust cover has a mounting-bracket or rail interface system for attaching accessories, such as a tactical light or laser sight.

The P99 feeds from staggered-column or double-stack magazines of varying capacity. Walther also offers staggered-column magazines with a +2 baseplate that add 2 rounds to the magazine capacity at the expense of extending the grip and the pistol height by approximately .

The .40 S&amp;W caliber models incorporate a slightly larger slide in order to preserve the same recoil spring assembly used in its 9mm counterpart. The P99 is available in 4 colorations; a black frame with a black slide, a black frame with a titanium-coated slide, a military olive-drab frame with a black slide, and a desert tan frame with black slide. All three of these finishes incorporate the same black grip inserts that come with every P99. The compact versions of the P99 are only available in all black.

===Accessories===
Fixed metal 3-dot iron sights, fixed tritium night sights, adjustable sports iron sights, adjustable optic fibre iron sights, laser pointers, tactical lights, magazine flashlight adapters, holsters, magazines, magazine loaders, grip extenders and a suppressor kit with a barrel and protective cap for the muzzle threads and a silencer that reduces the sound signature by 33 dB(A) are offered as factory accessories.

==Second generation variants==
===P99AS (Anti Stress)===

Introduced in 2004, this variant comes closest to a traditional Double-Action/Single-Action trigger with a decocker. In Double-Action mode the internal striker is at rest with no pre-load and the trigger travel is long at approximately trigger pull. When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon (re)loading, the internal striker is manually pre-cocked to Single-Action mode and the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot and the Anti Stress mode is activated. The trigger travel is long in the Anti Stress mode at approximately trigger pull. On all subsequent shots, the P99AS is automatically pre-cocked and the trigger travel is reduced to at the same trigger pull. For manually deactivating the Anti Stress mode and setting the pistol to Double-Action mode the P99AS features a decocking button recessed into the top of the slide, rather than a conventional lever usually found on the side. The Anti Stress mode can also be manually activated by moving the slide approximately back.

===P99DAO (Double Action Only)===
The P99DAO is similar to the previously produced P990 Double Action Only variant. The internal striker is at rest with no pre-load. The trigger travel is approximately with a trigger pull of approximately . The trigger pull is consistent in length and force from the first shot to the last and the striker returns to its de-cocked position after each shot.

===P99QA (Quick Action)===
This variant has a Glock style trigger system with a pre-loaded internal striker. When the trigger is pulled, the striker is fully cocked and released, firing the pistol. The trigger travel is approximately with a trigger pull of approximately . The trigger pull is consistent in length and force from the first shot to the last. The P99QA was announced in 2000 and discontinued in 2011.

===P99c (Compact) versions===
Compact versions of the P99 available in the 3 preceding action types marketed as the:
*P99c AS (Compact Anti Stress)
*P99c DAO (Compact Double Action Only)
*P99c QA (Compact Quick Action)

===Training variant===
====P99RAM (Real Action Marker)====
The P99RAM is a training and simulation pistol, equipped with a CO2 blow-back system. It fires low-cost Paint- and Rubberball ammunition in caliber . In its design, controls, and handling, the P99RAM is indistinguishable from the original P99 pistol. Protective clothing is needed to adequately protect the users from Paint- and Rubberball hits during training.

===Limited editions===
Walther has also created several limited production runs of the P99 including:
*MI-6 - 1st Generation P99, a marketing tie-in with the James Bond film series during Pierce Brosnan&#x27;s tenure in the role.
*Year 2000 - a limited edition P99 fabricated to commemorate the new millennium. 2000 of these were made to reciprocate the year for which it was issued.
*P99 TA - a model prepared for the police tryouts in Baden-Württemberg in 2002, featuring a single/double-action trigger with redesigned trigger guard, center location ambidextrous decocker and an early ambidextrous slide catch as well as the removal of the &quot;captured&quot; accessory rail in favor of a standard &quot;open&quot; rail system. Lastly, this model has new contours on the lower frame just ahead of the disassembly clasp, just before the accessory rails to facilitate holstering. Approximately fifty (50) P99 TAs were produced with less than 25 sold to the public (10 imported to the U.S.).
*Final Edition - it was announced in 2023 that Walther will release a limited edition version of the P99 titled the P99 AS Final Edition. The gun features a green frame and the engraving &quot;Final Edition&quot; on the slide and is otherwise functionally the same as the regular P99 AS.

===Fabryka Broni Radom P99 RAD===
The P99 RAD variant is made under license by Fabryka Broni Radom in Poland and marketed as a military sidearm proposition.

The P99 RAD grip shape and texture has been altered when compared to the P99 variants and an extended ambidextrous slide release and extended ambidextrous magazine release levers are fitted as a standard feature. Besides that the slide shape, dimensions and serrations have been altered. The standard sights are high-contrast 3 dot sights with contrast enhancements that have been painted with afterglow paint that can aid target acquisition under unfavourable lighting conditions. As an option the P99 RAD can also be fitted with self-luminous tritium night sights. The P99 RAD pistol is available with the DAO trigger mechanism with a trigger pull of approximately and the QA trigger mechanism with a trigger pull of approximately . The grip frame has an integrated mounting MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail for attaching tactical lights and laser sighting devices.

Many of the alterations found in the P99 RAD variant were applied in the Walther PPQ pistol introduced in 2011.

===P99Q police pistol===
Many of the alterations found in the Fabryka Broni Radom P99 RAD variant were also applied in the Walther P99Q pistol. The P99Q is a designated police pistol, which has been certified according to the Technical Specifications (TR) of the German Police (Technische Richtlinie Pistolen im Kaliber 9mm x 19, Revision January 2008). The P99Q is exclusively manufactured for German and foreign police departments and is not available on the civilian market. The P99Q has a partially pre-loaded internal striker trigger mechanism that conforms to the Technical Specifications (TR) of the German Police. When the trigger is pulled, the striker is fully cocked and released, firing the pistol. Trigger travel is approximately with a trigger reset of and a trigger pull of approximately . The trigger pull is consistent in length and force from the first shot to the last. The Technical Specifications (TR 2008) of the German Police also demand an accuracy of fire for a 10-shot group with German Police certified 9×19mm Parabellum ammunition at (R100) of ≤ . This equals an accuracy of fire of ≤ 22 minute of angle (MOA) or ≤ 6.4 mrad. The grip frame has an integrated mounting MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail for attaching tactical lights and laser sighting devices.

===Smith &amp; Wesson SW99===
The Smith &amp; Wesson SW99 is a joint venture between Walther, who produces a modified receiver in Germany, and Smith &amp; Wesson, who fabricates the slides and barrels in the United States. Magazines can be interchanged between the two models, but the pistols are considered to be two separate types, and are easily distinguished from each other by the trigger guard, grip and slide design. The SW99 is also available in .45 ACP, while the P99 is not. The P99 was developed and introduced prior to the SW99. Walther introduced a color-coding system to denote the difference between early generation SW99 and P99 magazines, with the latest generation being bright blue.

All 9mm P99s have always been completely German made. Some P99 .40 components are manufactured under license by S&amp;W. The barrel, slide and frame of all 100% German-manufactured P99s bear an &quot;Eagle over N&quot; proof mark of the German Proof House at Ulm. The mark indicates the pistol was test-fired with a Proof Load; the &quot;N&quot; stands for nitrocellulose.

===Magnum Research MR Eagle===
The Magnum Research MR Eagle was another joint American/German venture, with Walther producing a black polymer frame with integral steel rails similar to the P99 series, only differing in grip texture and with the short magazine release paddles from the first gen P99. For its part, Magnum Research Inc. produced a 416 stainless steel slide and 4140 CrMo steel barrel in their Pillager, MN factory in the United States. The MR Eagle series pistols were available in 9×19mm Parabellum (MR9) and .40 S&amp;W (MR40).

<text>Montrose is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 33 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Montrose recorded a population of 6,900 at the .

Montrose varies in altitude from about 91 m to 324 m above sea level. Montrose covers an area of .

Montrose is situated at the foothills of Mount Dandenong. 

==History==
European settlers initially referred to the area of Montrose as South Mooroolbark, and used the land for farming during the late 1800s. The town was also informally called &quot;Double Pitts&quot; after the double-handed saw pit method used in the local timber industry. The settlement was renamed to Montrose in 1892 by local landowner James Walker, whose son had a store on Colchester Road, Kilsyth named Rose Mont. A post office was opened in December 1898, and closed in July 1994. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, Montrose was used extensively for orchards, partly due to its high rainfall. In 1911 the population of Montrose was only 133. However, residential development increased in the 1920s, providing accommodation for tourists and permanent residents.

The Montrose Public Hall was funded by the local community and opened in July 1914, on the eve of World War I. A monument for World War I was constructed in 1921, which also became a memorial for World War II in 1947. The population of Montrose boomed after World War II, resulting in many more young families. An infant health centre was opened in 1949. A bushfire in 1961 destroyed 23 houses. By the 1970s Montrose had become part of the sprawl of suburbs extending into the Dandenongs.

In 2024, the (peak-hour) congested roundabout to the town was removed.

==Education==

Montrose incorporates two government primary schools:
* Montrose Primary School, located on Leith Road and established in 1880 (previously called Mooroolbark South Primary School and Double Pitts School)
* Billanook Primary School, located on Sheffield Road and established in 1980

==Recreation==
===Montrose Recreation Reserve===
The Montrose Recreation Reserve is home to several sporting clubs and a scout group, and provides a range of facilities including a playground and barbecues. The reserve is a popular destination for families and features a playground largely made from a recycled plastic as well as some artwork by local artists.

===Sporting clubs===
Montrose also has a range of sporting clubs:
* Montrose Tennis Club, adjacent to Montrose Recreation Reserve

<text>Accept is a German heavy metal band from Solingen, formed in 1976 by lead guitarist Wolf Hoffmann, singer Udo Dirkschneider and bassist Peter Baltes. Their beginnings can be traced back to the late 1960s when the band got its earliest start under the name Band X. Their current lineup consists of Hoffmann, vocalist Mark Tornillo, guitarists Uwe Lulis and Philip Shouse, drummer Christopher Williams and bassist Martin Motnik. Accept has undergone numerous lineup changes; Hoffmann is the last remaining original member, and the only band member to appear on all of their albums. As of 2024, the band has released seventeen studio albums, five live albums and nine compilation albums.

Accept played an important role in the development of speed and thrash metal, and they were part of the German heavy metal scene, which had emerged by the early to mid-1980s. Accept achieved its first commercial success with their fifth studio album &quot;Balls to the Wall&quot; (1983), which is the band&#x27;s only album to be certified gold in the United States and Canada, and spawned their well-known hit &quot;Balls to the Wall&quot;.

Accept has disbanded and reformed multiple times. They first split up in 1989, several months after the release of &quot;Eat the Heat&quot; (which was their only album with Dirkschneider&#x27;s initial replacement David Reece), but reformed in 1992 and released three more albums before disbanding again in 1997. After briefly reuniting in 2005, Accept announced their third reunion in 2009, with former T.T. Quick frontman Mark Tornillo replacing Dirkschneider (who declined to participate), and the band has recorded six albums with him: &quot;Blood of the Nations&quot; (2010), &quot;Stalingrad&quot; (2012), &quot;Blind Rage&quot; (2014), &quot;The Rise of Chaos&quot; (2017), &quot;Too Mean to Die&quot; (2021), and &quot;Humanoid&quot; (2024); those albums renewed Accept&#x27;s popularity in Germany and entered the top ten charts there. As of 2024, the band has sold more than 17 million copies of their albums worldwide.

==History==
===Early years (1968–1982)===
Accept&#x27;s beginnings can be traced back to 1968 when Udo Dirkschneider and Michael Wagener formed a local band called Band X. Band X later changed its name to Accept, influenced by an album by that title by the British blues band Chicken Shack. For many years, Accept went through numerous line-up changes. This instability essentially kept the band on an amateur level, making sporadic appearances in festival concerts. Accept&#x27;s professional career began in 1976, with Udo Dirkschneider, Wolf Hoffmann, Gerhard Wahl, Peter Baltes, and Frank Friedrich, when they were invited to play at one of the first rock and roll festivals in Germany — Rock am Rhein. Following the festival, the band was offered a recording deal. Their first recording was the self-titled &quot;Accept&quot; album, which was released in 1979, but did not achieve much commercial success.

The first stable line-up of Accept was composed of vocalist Udo Dirkschneider, guitarists Wolf Hoffmann and Gerhard Wahl, bassist Peter Baltes and drummer Frank Friedrich. Friedrich and Wahl quit the band after the release of &quot;Accept&quot; and were replaced by Stefan Kaufmann and Jörg Fischer. This line-up recorded &quot;I&#x27;m a Rebel&quot; in 1980. The title track originally was written for AC/DC and recorded by the band but never released by them. The album brought some media attention, and the band was invited to make a televised appearance.

In 1981, their third studio album, &quot;Breaker&quot;, was released, and the band employed manager Gaby Hauke. The same year, Accept served as a supporting act on Judas Priest&#x27;s World Wide Blitz Tour, and obtained attention outside of Europe for the first time.

The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Restless and Wild&quot; was released in 1982. Jörg Fischer before the recording of the album began, as did his intended replacement, Jan Koemmet. &quot;Restless and Wild&quot; saw an evolution in the band&#x27;s sound, which incorporated characteristics defining the genre later dubbed speed metal. Gaby Hauke was credited as &quot;Deaffy&quot; on two of the tracks.

===Mainstream success (1983–1987)===
Accept&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Balls to the Wall&quot;, was released in 1983, now with guitarist Herman Frank (ex-Sinner). The album was more conceptual and included lyrical themes about politics, sexuality and human relationships. For example, the title track &quot;Balls to the Wall&quot; refers to slaves revolting against oppressing masters, while &quot;Fight It Back&quot; is about social misfits fighting against conformity. All songs were credited to Accept and &quot;Deaffy&quot;. Deaffy was manager Gaby Hauke&#x27;s pseudonym as the band&#x27;s lyricist, although she did not officially claim ownership until the band had broken up for the second time.

During a 1983 show in their hometown, the band met Jörg Fischer by chance and on Hauke&#x27;s insistence, Fischer rejoined the band. A world tour followed through 1984, including the Monsters of Rock festival. By this time, the band was supported by Bad Steve, a band which was led by former Accept and Band X members Dieter Rubach, Jan Koemmet and Frank Friedrich. The band also opened for Iron Maiden on their World Slavery Tour.

&quot;Metal Heart&quot; was released in 1985. Produced by Dieter Dierks (then-known for working with Scorpions), it presented the band&#x27;s creative peak. Accept toured the world supporting the album, and documented the live shows with the live mini-album &quot;Kaizoku-Ban&quot;.

The follow-up, &quot;Russian Roulette&quot;, was released in 1986. In 1987, Udo Dirkschneider was fired from the band, and later decided to embark on a solo career. According to Wolf Hoffmann, Dirkschneider was never fired but it was rather a mutual decision within the band to part ways. Supporting this decision, the songwriting team in Accept wrote his entire solo album, released in 1987 as &quot;Animal House&quot; under the band moniker U.D.O.

===David Reece period and first hiatus (1988–1991)===
Parallel to work on &quot;Animal House&quot;, Accept started to audition vocalists. The band tried out a few singers, including Ken Tamplin and Baby Tuckoo singer Rob Armitage, whom they even featured in promo photos and metal magazine interviews, and also recorded demos with. Armitage also performed live with the band and one of the shows with him was reviewed by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine. However, American vocalist David Reece was chosen and this new lineup recorded and released &quot;Eat the Heat&quot; in 1989. Accept toured in support of the album that year with bands like Metal Church, W.A.S.P., Danzig and Armored Saint.

Accept&#x27;s career came to a sudden halt when Stefan Kaufmann sustained a serious injury to his back during the tour in support of the album. He was briefly replaced by House of Lords drummer Ken Mary for the remainder of the US tour. By the time the tour ended in late 1989, the band decided that without Kaufmann, and with differences surfacing with Reece, it was time to cease their activities for the time being.

===Reunion with Dirkschneider (1992–1996)===

The live album &quot;Staying a Life&quot;, recorded in 1985, was released in 1990 as a souvenir celebrating their career.

A few years later the ex-members met with Dirkschneider and decided to relaunch the band with core members Hoffmann, Kaufmann, Dirkschneider and Baltes.

Their comeback album, &quot;Objection Overruled&quot;, was released in 1993 and was a qualified success in Europe and the United States. A world tour followed, and another album, entitled &quot;Death Row&quot;, was released in the following year. Kaufmann became unable to play once again due to his recurring back injury and Stefan Schwarzmann became the temporary replacement.

&quot;Predator&quot; (1996) was recorded in Nashville, with Udo&#x27;s long-time (school) friend and producer Michael Wagener at the helm and with Michael Cartellone (from Damn Yankees) filling in on drums. Accept&#x27;s tour supporting &quot;Predator&quot; took place in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, with their last concert in Tokyo, Japan.
===Second hiatus and brief reunion (1997–2005)===
Between 1997 and 2005, all the members continued working on their own projects. In 2005, Accept received an invitation from various European promoters for a short summer European Festival tour with Accept&#x27;s classic line-up (Hoffmann, Baltes, Dirkschneider, Frank and Schwarzmann). These festivals turned out to be a stunning success, with the last show on 27 August 2005 in Kavarna, Bulgaria, at the Kaliakra Rock Fest.

Asked in May 2007 by Lords of Metal if Accept was planning on writing and recording new music in the future, Dirkschneider replied:
On 14 May 2009, Udo Dirkschneider officially announced that he would not be participating in the rumored Accept reunion.

===Return with Mark Tornillo and &quot;Blood of the Nations&quot; (2009–2011)===
At the end of May 2009, rumors again surfaced of a possible Accept reformation, when bassist Peter Baltes revealed he spent a weekend at his house in Pennsylvania &quot;shredding away&quot; with guitarist Wolf Hoffmann. &quot;Something amazing is in the works&quot;, Baltes explained. &quot;As soon as I can, I&#x27;ll let everybody know. Let&#x27;s make the &#x27;Metal Heart&#x27; beat again.&quot;

A coincidental meeting between Accept and former T.T. Quick singer Mark Tornillo at this informal jam session occurred shortly after Tornillo was announced as the new vocalist.

A new album was written and recorded with Andy Sneap (of Megadeth, Sabbat, BLAZE, Exodus, Testament, Arch Enemy and Onslaught fame) as producer. Titled &quot;Blood of the Nations&quot;, it was the first original Accept album in fourteen years.

The new line-up made their live debut on 8 May 2010 at the Gramercy Theatre in New York City, their first American concert in fifteen years.

On 21 May 2010, the video for &quot;Teutonic Terror&quot; was number 5 on the worldwide video charts in all genres on MySpace, topping such artists as Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber and Christina Aguilera. The video also topped the MySpace Global Metal Charts at number 1.

On 13 June 2010, Accept opened for AC/DC in Stuttgart, Germany, and on 25 June 2010, they headlined the Sonisphere Festival in Romania and Turkey. With a set of over two hours, classics like &quot;Balls to the Wall&quot;, &quot;Metal Heart&quot; and &quot;Princess of the Dawn&quot; were played along with the new album material. &quot;Blood of the Nations&quot; was released in Europe on 20 August 2010 and made a chart debut at number 4 in the official German Media Control Charts, the band&#x27;s second-highest chart debut in their career.

&quot;Blood of the Nations&quot; was released on 4 September 2010 in Japan, and on 18 September in the United States. Accept spent 80 days on a summer tour traveling over 65,000 km and playing for over 450,000 fans. In October, the band appeared at the prestigious Japanese festival Loud Park outside of Tokyo to 40,000 fans along with Ozzy Osbourne, Motörhead and Stone Sour.

Within a month of the release of &quot;Blood of the Nations&quot;, Wolf Hoffmann told &quot;Metal Asylum&quot;: &quot;We are already thinking about and writing for the next record. We&#x27;ve all missed doing Accept and we realized we missed doing this. Of course, we are not 20 years old anymore and not ready to do just anything to be successful, we&#x27;re not that desperate. [laughs] We are looking to do what makes sense and that&#x27;s fun.&quot;

===&quot;Stalingrad&quot; and &quot;Blind Rage&quot; (2012–2014)===

Accept worked with Andy Sneap again to produce their thirteenth studio album, completed in early 2012. Entitled &quot;Stalingrad&quot;, it was released in April 2012.

On 8 April 2013, Wolf Hoffmann told Chile&#x27;s Radio Futuro that Accept had begun writing new material for their fourteenth studio album and would &quot;definitely go back to the studio as soon as [they] can.&quot; Four months later, on 9 August at the Bloodstock Open Air festival 2013, Wolf told Metal Shock Finland:
Accept released their fourteenth studio album &quot;Blind Rage&quot; on 15 August 2014 and on their world tour, they played in Australia for the very first time. &quot;Blind Rage&quot; became Accept&#x27;s first album to debut at number one on the charts in their home country.

===Departures of two members and &quot;The Rise of Chaos&quot; (2014–2017)===
On 28 December 2014, guitarist Herman Frank announced that he had left Accept again. Later that day, Accept announced that drummer Stefan Schwarzmann had also left the band.

On 12 April 2015, Accept announced new guitarist and drummer, respectively Uwe Lulis and Christopher Williams.

On 5 June 2015, prior to the band&#x27;s performance at the South Park festival in Tampere, Finland, bassist Peter Baltes told Kaaos TV that Accept planned to begin work on a new album after the conclusion of the &quot;Blind Rage&quot; tour. Asked in a July 2015 interview about the band&#x27;s future, guitarist Wolf Hoffmann replied, &quot;We will continue for a few more weeks, this run of touring, and then we&#x27;ll take a little break and come back in the fall, but we&#x27;re pretty much wrapping up the &quot;Blind Rage&quot; tour at this point; it&#x27;s the very last phase of this whole cycle. And then the next album will have to be written and to be recorded, and how long that&#x27;s gonna take and when that&#x27;s all gonna happen, who knows? But it&#x27;ll happen; that&#x27;s all I know.&quot; Hoffmann stated that the new album would be released around July or August 2017. Like their previous three albums, the album was produced by Andy Sneap, making it Accept&#x27;s fourth collaboration with him. On 16 April 2017, Accept announced that the album, titled &quot;The Rise of Chaos&quot;, would be released on 4 August.

On 2 June 2017, the band released the title track single digitally via Nuclear Blast accompanied by new artwork.

===Split with Peter Baltes, &quot;Too Mean to Die&quot; and &quot;Humanoid&quot; (2018–present)===
In a September 2018 interview with The Foundry, guitarist Wolf Hoffmann confirmed that Accept had begun the songwriting process for the follow-up to &quot;The Rise of Chaos&quot;. He stated, &quot;We started putting down some riffs here and there, but the majority of the stuff will happen after we stop touring because it&#x27;s really hard to do this on the road for me.&quot;

On 27 November 2018, bassist Peter Baltes announced that he had left Accept after 42 years as a member. According to the band, &quot;Peter needed a change in his life and we wish him all the best. He will always be part of the Accept family and to honor his tribute to music history, we should all wish him well.&quot; With Baltes&#x27; departure, Hoffmann remains the last member of the original lineup in the band.

Baltes was filled in on bass by Danny Silvestri for the band&#x27;s performance at the 2019 edition of the 70000 Tons of Metal cruise. On 16 April 2019, former Uli Jon Roth sideman Martin Motnik was announced as Baltes&#x27; permanent replacement. Three days later, Accept released a special seven-inch single called &quot;Life&#x27;s a Bitch&quot;, which was their first song in two years and first one without Baltes.

On 1 November 2019, Accept announced that Philip Shouse, previously a touring member, had joined the band as their third guitarist, thus converting Accept to a sextet.

On 2 October 2020, Accept released &quot;The Undertaker&quot; as the first single from their upcoming sixteenth studio album &quot;Too Mean to Die&quot;, released on 29 January 2021. Their sixteenth studio album &quot;Too Mean to Die&quot; only narrowly missed the top of the German charts. It was recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nashville and produced by Andy Sneap in the UK. About their then-new album, the band said: &quot;We are too mean to die! Weeds don&#x27;t go away! Accept won&#x27;t get down!&quot; Touring in support of the album began 2 July 2021 at Penn&#x27;s Peak in Pennsylvania. The touring cycle of &quot;Too Mean to Die&quot; lasted for nearly two years, which included a headlining U.S. tour in the fall of 2022 with Narcotic Wasteland, followed by a European tour in January and February 2023 with Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons. The latter tour was initially scheduled to take place in January and February 2022, but the COVID-19 pandemic meant that it would be postponed for a year.

On 17 February 2022, Accept announced that they had signed a worldwide deal with Napalm Records. In July, Hoffmann announced that the band had begun working on new material for the follow-up to &quot;Too Mean to Die&quot;. In June 2023, bassist Martin Motnik confirmed that Accept had begun demoing songs for the album. On 6 February 2024, the band announced &quot;Humanoid&quot; as the title of the album and that it would be released on 26 April, with a supporting tour to follow.

<text>Mooroolbark is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 37 km East of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Mooroolbark recorded a population of 23,059 at the .

Mooroolbark is at an elevation of approximately 93 metres.

==History==
&quot;Mooroolbark&quot; has been popularly believed for some time to have the meaning &quot;red earth&quot;, leading to extensive use of that meaning in the community. More recently it has been suggested that &quot;Mooroolbik&quot; is the name given by the local Wurundjeri Aboriginal people (&quot;moorool&quot; meaning great water and &quot;bik&quot; meaning place). An alternative meaning of Mooroolbark being &quot;the place where the wide waters meet&quot; is recorded by Museum Victoria. Another meaning recorded is &quot;red bark&quot;.

The Parish of Mooroolbark was surveyed in 1855, with a township originally called Brushy Creek standing where North Croydon is today. The name &quot;Mooroolbark&quot; was to be popularised with eventual European settlement in the late 19th century. A rural hub developed around the train station, which opened in 1887 and offered rail access to Melbourne. The Post Office opened shortly after on 15 March 1888.

Wonga Park used to be a part of Mooroolbark until the early 20th century when it became a separate suburb. Another locality called Mooroolbark Park was later renamed as Chirnside Park.

==Transport==

Mooroolbark has a train station which is on the Lilydale railway line. It has 595 car parking spaces. The station was rebuilt in 2021 as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project.

===Bus routes===
A number of bus routes serve the Mooroolbark area, and FlexiRide services, where passengers can request to be picked up or dropped off from home, also operate in the area. All services are operated by Ventura Bus Lines. Curiously for a Melbourne suburb, none of the buses which serve Mooroolbark run on Sundays, with the sole exception of the 664 which is more than a kilometre north of the railway station. Additionally, the FlexiRide services only run limited hours, falling well below the Victorian Government&#x27;s minimum service standards.

Bus routes 664, 675, 680 and 689 and two FlexiRide routes service Mooroolbark. (All but 664 &amp; 689 stop at the station)

664: Knox City Shopping Centre to Chirnside Park Shopping Centre (seven days)

675: to Chirnside Park Shopping Centre (Monday to Friday)

680: to Lilydale (Monday to Friday)

689: Croydon to Montrose (Monday to Saturday)

Mooroolbark FlexiRide (Monday to Saturday)

Croydon FlexiRide (Monday to Saturday)

===&quot;Five Ways&quot;===

Located in Mooroolbark is one of Melbourne&#x27;s most unusual intersections between Hull Road, Lincoln Road, Manchester Road and Cambridge Road: three consecutive roundabouts (pictured). Initially, the three latter streets simply connected to Hull Road at close, but slightly different, locations. In order to eliminate the troubles caused by vehicles failing to give way to those coming from other adjoining streets, it was decided to build individual roundabouts at each intersection, and employ the standard &#x27;give way&#x27; road rules. This has cleared up most of the troubles on Hull Road (southwest to northeast), but the prospect of passing through the intersection for those who don&#x27;t know it may be a little daunting. This intersection is usually referred to by locals as &quot;Five Ways&quot; or &quot;The Mooroolbark Roundabouts&quot;.

==Shopping district==

The main shopping district is located along Brice Avenue and Manchester Road, featuring a Coles supermarket, two gymnasiums, two pharmacies, fast food franchises, cafés, hair salons and thrift shops. Mooroolbark also has a tavern and wine bar.

==Police station==
Mooroolbark has a 24-hour police station. It is located at the corner of Hull and Cambridge Roads (&quot;Five Ways&quot;), 700 metres from the Mooroolbark train station and town centre.

==Schools==
There are a number of primary and secondary schools within Mooroolbark offering a choice between government and private education.

===Government schools===
*Bimbadeen Heights Primary School
*Manchester Primary School
* Mooroolbark East Primary School
*Pembroke Primary School
*Rolling Hills Primary
* Mooroolbark College
* Yarra Hills Secondary College

===Private schools===
* Billanook College

==Community Centre &amp; Places of Interest==
Another point of interest within Mooroolbark is the Mooroolbark Community Centre, which has undergone radical changes since 2004 as part of a civil beautification and anti-graffiti project. The community centre is now surrounded by colourful mosaics and street art, including a stencil art representation of Mooroolbark&#x27;s most famous citizen, the early 20th Century landscape designer Edna Walling.

The first Blue Light Disco in Australia was held in Mooroolbark in 1976. The &#x27;Blue Light Disco&#x27;, specifically a local Victoria Police initiative, is now a well-known attraction for teenagers Australia-wide.

The Mooroolbark library, a branch of Eastern Regional Libraries, is located at 7 Station Street. It offers a variety of events, including storytimes for preschool children. The library is next to Hookey Park, a children&#x27;s adventure park.

==Brushy Creek==
Most of Mooroolbark is in the catchment of Brushy Creek, a tributary of the Yarra River. A number of environmental concerns exist because of its location almost entirely within an urban environment.

==Community festivals==
From 1980 to 2001, Mooroolbark had the &#x27;Red Earth Festival&#x27;, usually on the third or fourth weekend of March every year beginning on Friday evening and running all day Saturday and Sunday. The &#x27;Red Earth Festival&#x27; had many stores and amusement rides. The highlights of that festival included a parade on the Saturday, which began in the grounds of the former Mooroolbark Primary School (which closed at the end of 2004) and went down Brice Avenue towards the fairground. On the Sunday, the festival hosted an open-air market followed by a fireworks display at night. Due to a number of problems including falling attendances and a significant increase in insurance premiums, the Red Earth Festival ran for the last time in March 2001.

Since 2002, there has been a smaller festival known as &#x27;Celebrate Mooroolbark&#x27;, at around the same time of the year.

==Sport ==
Mooroolbark Soccer Club &quot;The Barkers&quot; - founded as a Dutch team with the name Mooroolbark United Soccer Club in 1962, Mooroolbark&#x27;s backing changed to a British influenced club in its formative years. In 1978 the United tagline was dropped from the name. The club&#x27;s claim to fame is as Victoria&#x27;s (and Australia&#x27;s) first national sporting club side. Mooroolbark enabled the National Soccer League to proceed, breaking the deadlock which was then in force between the budding national league and clubs from Victoria whom the Victorian Soccer Federation had forbidden to join the competition.

Mooroolbark Football Club &quot;The Mustangs&quot; - Compete in Division 1 of the Eastern Football League. Their home ground is known as Heights Reserve, Longfellow Dr, Mooroolbark. Both Seniors and Juniors are represented by the club, with two junior girls teams joining the Club in 2017.

==Air monitoring==
Mooroolbark has an EPA &#x27;Air Monitoring Station&#x27;. It measures Carbon Monoxide (CO) Nitrogen Dioxide (NO²) Ozone (O³) Particles. Monitoring began on Monday, 8 April 2002. Data is compiled by EPA Victoria.

==Notable people==
In 1836 John Gardiner, one of the first to bring cattle down from the Murrumbidgee in New South Wales to the Port Phillip District, was looking for some stray cattle east of Melbourne. His search took him via the Eltham and Yarra Glen areas to where Mooroolbark now is, and he found his cattle near the Olinda Creek. News of this new grazing land travelled back to Melbourne, and graziers soon brought their stock up the Yarra Valley. The first farmers in Mooroolbark were John Lithgow in 1845 and Robert Blair in 1847.

The early 20th Century landscape designer Edna Walling purchased of land at Mooroolbark and built her first home from local and second hand materials. This home was named Sonning, after Gertrude Jekyll&#x27;s Deanery Garden, Sonning, an English garden she had visited. Her property is now the Bickleigh Vale Estate in the eastern part of Mooroolbark, which is a private residential area but in the past has been open for public display as part of Australia&#x27;s Open Garden Scheme. A stencil art representation of her is located at the Mooroolbark Community Centre.

Sam Mitchell, is an Australian Rules Football premiership captain and coach was born and raised in Mooroolbark. Prior to playing in the Australian Football League he played for the local club in Mooroolbark before moving to the Box Hill Hawks.

Barney McAll released a jazz album called Mooroolbark in 2015 which won an ARIA award.

Rebecca Barnard, an Australian singer-songwriter that fronted the band Rebecca&#x27;s Empire was originally from Mooroolbark.

Heath Hocking, is an Australian rules footballer who played for the Essendon Football Club until 2017.

<doc id="609359" wikidata="Q3321310" url="?curid=609359" title="Lazy Mutha Fucka">
<text>LMF also known as Lazy Mutha Fucka or &quot;Lazy Muthafucka&quot;, is a Cantonese hip-hop group in Hong Kong. The group, signed to Warner Music, was founded in 1993, disbanded in 2003 and regrouped in 2009. Some members of LMF are pursuing solo careers.

In contrast with the norm of commercial and packaged Cantopop, LMF write and perform original music. All members of the group hail from poverty and their songs often depict life and struggle in the underclass and working class, and are frequently controversial for their swearing and provocative subject matter. The band are not embraced by mainstream media for reasons that include their perceived negative influence on Hong Kong youth, their promotion of the hip-hop attitude, and their rough appearance that contrasts with the well-dressed and clean-cut performers managed by the music industry.

LMF offers Hong Kong an alternative to Cantopop. LMF is rare or even unique as a well-known local rap group. LMF highlights the economic oppression and social alienation faced by the lower class of Hong Kong, all coming from Hong Kong&#x27;s overcrowded public housing.

LMF&#x27;s attempt to establish a foothold in the highly commercial and monopolistic Hong Kong music industry is widely considered to be a success despite achieving only moderate commercial sales, due to their longevity, their name recognition (mostly in negative press coverage), and the original form of music they create. They have a small but die-hard fan base in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

Their last and final album, &quot;finalazy&quot;, was released just before their breakup in 2003.

LMF reformed in December 2009, ten years after their debut release, and went on the &quot;Wild Lazy Tour&quot;, including venues in Singapore and Hong Kong.

==Early years==
LMF was founded in 1992 by Cheung Yee Sic (張以式), known as Ar Sik (亞式). Cheng was the founder and organizer of &quot;Dark Entry&quot;, an annual rock concert featuring local underground bands. Initially, Cheng named his band 重金屬同學會(translation: Heavy Metal Students Association) and gave it an English name: Lazy Mother Fuckers.

Initially LMF was merely a banner under which musicians from different bands got together and played; it did not have set members and there was no intent to create original music. Cheng called the group more of a club than a band. At the finale of each Dark Entry concert, members of various bands that had performed that night would come together on stage and jam and perform as this loose collective, often fifteen or more players. Musicians from many talented Hong Kong bands - including Anodize, Zig Zag, Zenith, Fraina and Martyr - have at one time or another lent members to LMF at the Dark Entry concert.

Dark Entry lasted a few years before financial problems led to its discontinuation. With the disappearance of Dark Entry, Cheng and LMF also went into hiatus.

==The Revival==
In 1996, an unknown young DJ from Hong Kong shocked many by defeating several favourites and taking second place in the DMC World DJ Championships. DJ Tommy&#x27;s accomplishment caught the attention of Hong Kong music executives and soon the young DJ received financing to release a six-song self-titled album. DJ Tommy solicited veteran underground rapper and graffiti artist MC Yan (real name: Chan Kwong-yan) to be a guest vocalist. The release created a minor controversy for its swearing and sales were disappointing in a market dominated by commercial Cantopop. However, the collaboration between DJ Tommy and MC Yan went so well that they decided to form a band.

MC Yan had just left his longtime band N.T. (New Territory) over creative differences (he wanted to incorporate hip hop into their music while his bandmates wanted to play strictly speed metal). A well known and respected artist in the indie music circle, MC Yan had no trouble recruiting some of the best talent in Hong Kong: lead guitarist Kee (from the band Screw), rhythm guitarist Prodip, drummer Kevin, vocalists Kit and Phat.

Around this time heavy metal band Anodize, the most popular yet financially struggling indie band in Hong Kong decided to call it quits. All band members intended to retire from the music scene until they were approached by MC Yan and DJ Tommy, who were hoping to recruit Jimmy to play bass but were delighted when lead singer Wah and drummer/guitarist/keyboardist Davy decided to join too. A fourth Anodize member, Gary, joined the band as a part-time member. The addition of Anodize&#x27;s former members added gravitas and musicianship to a group already loaded with talent. MC Yan decided to adopt the LMF name and the band was formally formed in 1998.

It is unclear what role, if any, founder Cheung Yee Sik (張以式) played in LMF&#x27;s revival. Most critics attribute MC Yan (lead singer of N.T.) and DJ Tommy for turning LMF into a mostly hip hop band, one that mixes rap with heavy metal/rock.

LMF dropped the Chinese name 重金屬同學會 and named themselves 大懶堂 (Lazy Hall). The band&#x27;s English name was altered from Lazy Mother Fuckers to Lazy Mutha Fucka.

LMF ultimately stabilised with a fixed roster of members, instead of the former &quot;revolving door&quot;. MC Yan still holds that he considers LMF more of a community than an actual band. He also said he&#x27;s amazed at the smoothness of the creative process given the input of so many members. He attributes their creative success to all members sharing a vision of where they want to take their music. 
The ten full-time members and two part-time members are:

Full-time members: 
*MC Yan (vocal)
*Kit (vocal)
*Phat (vocal)
*Wah (vocal)
*DJ Tommy (turntable)
*Davy (drum and guitar)
*Kevin (drum)
*Jimmy (bass guitar)
*Kee (guitar)
*Prodip (guitar)

Part-time members:
*Gary (guitar / bass guitar)
*Sam (vocal)

===20th anniversary festival===
In 2019, the band announced a 20th anniversary festival on 28–29 December, called LMFXXYEARFEST, featuring Matt Force, Dough Boy, Future, Seanie, Tommy, KZ, Akiko, JB, 黃禍, Heyo, Phoon, Josie and The Uni Boys, R.O.O.T, 逆流 and My Little Airport.

==Music==
In the late nineties, LMF played at various clubs and generated a lot of buzz in the indie music scene. They released their self-titled debut album in 1998 under their own label - A.Room Production (&quot;A Room Studio&quot; is the name of the studio where they recorded the album. It&#x27;s also the location where Anodize, Screw, and N.T. recorded before they joined LMF). The album features six songs and sold almost 100,000 copies worldwide, an unheard-of feat for a Hong Kong indie band without backing from a major label. 

In 1999, they released a self-titled EP, which was controversial but gained them commercial success.

With the band having so many members across different genres, LMF&#x27;s music can be best described as a diverse yet coherent mix of hip hop, rock and thrash metal, with occasional funk or even reggae thrown in. The genius lies in their ability to seamlessly mesh together all genres. For example, &quot;傲氣長存&quot; features a thrash metal-like intro, evolves into a funk beat, turns into a brief hip hop mix before returning to the funk beat with rap vocal. The chorus is thrash metal with singing vocal and the interlude is speed metal with heavy guitar muting and rap vocal on top.

The song 大懶堂 (Lazy Hall), using a hypothetical aftermath of winning the lottery as a backdrop to critique Hong Kong&#x27;s competitive and stressful environment, struck a chord with the listening audience and is arguably the band&#x27;s most popular hit. However, LMF made no attempt to follow up 大懶堂&#x27;s commercial success with similar radio-friendly songs, preferring to explore new directions for their music.

Unlike most acts in the Hong Kong industry, LMF retain total control of their music creation (under their agreement with the music label) and the band have made clear they are under no pressure to produce commercial hits and would never succumb if there were any.

==Controversy==
LMF represents the youth culture and attitudes in Hong Kong. They have a subtle but great influence on Hong Kong popular culture.

The title of one of their most popular songs, &quot;&quot; (Hum Ga Ling), is one of the strongest curses in Cantonese mingled with English phrases like &quot;You know what the fuck I&#x27;m sayin~&quot;. In English, &quot;Hum Ga Ling&quot; literally means &quot;Send one&#x27;s entire family to hell (or death)&quot;. The song is packed with swearing in Cantonese and English. In ever-conservative Hong Kong society, LMF remained low key, though they were well received underground.

The emergence of LMF also caught the attention of Hong Kong&#x27;s educational authorities (HKEAA). The 1999 HKASL Chinese &amp; Chinese Culture Paper II (Cultural Problems), asked candidates to comment on the statement &quot;Foul Songs Display True Art&quot;.

==Culture==
Behind the profanity of &quot;&quot; lies a deeper message. Another popular song by LMF, &quot;1127&quot;, is a tribute to Bruce Lee. The song encourages young Chinese to take pride in their rich Chinese ancestry, culture, and history, instead of pretending to be like the Westerners. Notable lines from the lyrics include:

A documentary about the band, &quot;Dare Ya!&quot; (Cantonese title: &quot;大你&quot;), is based around interviews with the various band members.

==Politics and society==

The band members all grew up on Hong Kong&#x27;s crowded public housing estates, and the group&#x27;s music addresses the economic oppression and social alienation faced by working class Hong Kong people, especially youth. They are critical of political and economic instability in the city, such as the Asian financial crisis, as well as the incompetence of local political leaders, such as the song &quot;WTF&quot;. They also attempt to reinforce a distinct and unique Hong Kong cultural identity, urging the youth of Hong Kong to be proud, as in the song &quot;1127&quot;, taking Bruce Lee as a Chinese role model.

Many of LMF&#x27;s songs reflect the cultural problem of modern Hong Kong society&#x27;s lack of any identity for today&#x27;s youth to look up to and be proud of. Their song &quot;債&quot; (Debt) observes that many Chinese parents send their children to the opposite side of the world only to have them grow up to be &quot;Caucasians with yellow skin&quot; (Cantonese lyrics: &quot;&quot;) while the parents distance themselves from their own children and neglect the responsibility of raising them.

LMF often criticise Hong Kong&#x27;s music culture. In the song &quot;傲氣長存&quot; and &quot;樂壇班霸&quot; they say that Hong Kong is no place for music, but rather entertainment in the form of scandals created by the paparazzi. In &quot;傲氣長存&quot;, they also criticise producers inability to make good music in a line that roughly translates as &quot;if you don&#x27;t fucking know how to be creative, then don&#x27;t be so conceited.&quot;

In the song &quot;冚家拎&quot;, the majority of the song criticises Hong Kong&#x27;s corrupt society. They accuse the paparazzi of making up fake news and publishing subjective opinions to sell their newspapers and magazines. They also express anger toward adult content and the illegal gambling content (soccer betting) found in newspapers.

==Mainstream and television appearances==
In 2000, beer brewer San Miguel Corporation terminated their contract with Hong Kong movie star Tony Leung Ka Fai and signed LMF to star in six different commercials for the beer company. The commercials ran during Christmas and Lunar New Year. The song &quot;Para Salud&quot; was recorded to air in the beer commercial, and was also on their album &quot;LMFAMiGLiA&quot;.

In 2001, the band supported &quot;Cantopop Diva&quot; Sammi Cheng for an 11-night stint at the Hong Kong Coliseum.

==Trivia==
* The beginning of &quot;WTF&quot; on &quot;Finalazy&quot; samples Shirley Bassey&#x27;s theme song for the 1971 James Bond film, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;.
* In the song &quot;Thank You&quot;, one of the people thanked is 亞式, the original founder of LMF.
* Popular artist Michael Lau released several series of collectable vinyl figures based on some members of LMF. The &quot;Crazy Children&quot; is a line of collectable Lau figures that includes Davy, Prodip, MC Yan and DJ Tommy. &quot;Crazy Children&quot; is also the name of a song on LMF&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Children&quot; album. Lau also designed some of the album covers and posters for LMF and is close friends with several of the LMF members. Other covers are designed by the group members.

==Disbanding and reunion==
LMF disbanded in 2003, in part because the group was too large, with usually 10 members in each concert, as well as the difficulty of broad acceptance of their often controversial music. Members are now pursuing their own solo careers, with some forming and joining new bands while others step outside the music industry. Kit and Phat launched 24HERBS, a rap group. Phat is also the lead singer of punk rock band Hardpack, with Kevin on the drums. MC Yan has helped Edison Chen on several of his albums, making hip-hop and rap more accessible to mainstream audiences. On the underground side, MC Yan has worked with several MCs and formed a new group, Yellow Peril. Davy is DBF and still active in the music scene, most notably as a drummer in various concerts for Eason Chan. MC Yan also the founder of 福建音樂 Fu©Kin Music. while, tangentially to the music industry, Jimmy runs a popular BMX shop called DJ BMX Workshop. 

After a six-year hiatus, LMF returned to the music scene in 2009 to release one new single &quot;Clutching the Middle Finger&quot; (揸緊中指) reflecting the increasing anger of contemporary youth at the incompetence of the establishment and the increasing lack of social mobility for young people.

In 2018 and 2019 they held a series of reunion shows.

<doc id="609362" wikidata="Q2484631" url="?curid=609362" title="History of the Pitcairn Islands">
<text>The history of the [[Pitcairn Islands]] begins with the colonization of the islands by Polynesians in the 11th century. Polynesian people established a culture that flourished for four centuries and then vanished. They lived on Pitcairn and Henderson Islands, and on Mangareva Island to the northwest, for about 400 years.

In 1790, nine of the mutineers from HMS &quot;Bounty&quot;, led by Fletcher Christian, abducted 18 native Tahitians and settled on Pitcairn Island, afterwards setting fire to the &quot;Bounty&quot;. Christian&#x27;s group continued under the auspices of Ned Young and John Adams until contacted by Mayhew Folger in 1808, by which time Adams was the only surviving mutineer.

== Polynesian society ==

The earliest known settlers of the Pitcairn Islands were Polynesians who appear to have settled on Pitcairn and Henderson Islands by at least the 11th Century, and on the more populous Mangareva Island to the northwest, for several centuries. These first inhabitants may have maintained a trading relationship with Mangareva, in which they exchanged basalt, volcanic glass (obsidian) and oven stones for goods, including coral and pearl shells. Most trade occurred within the Pitcairn Islands; however, material from Pitcairn Island has been discovered on the Tuamotus and Austral Islands in French Polynesia. The alkaline basalt found at Tautama (on the south-east of Pitcairn Island) was used by early Polynesians to create some of the highest quality adzes in Polynesia; however, the adzes were not traded widely, likely due to the remoteness of the islands. It is not certain why this society disappeared, but it is probably related to the deforestation of Mangareva and the subsequent decline of its culture; Pitcairn was not capable of sustaining large numbers of people without a relationship with other populous islands. By the mid-1400s, the trade routes between the islands and French Polynesia had broken down. Important natural resources were exhausted and a period of civil war began on Mangareva, causing the small populations on Henderson and Pitcairn to be cut off and eventually become extinct.

The islands were uninhabited when they were rediscovered by the Portuguese explorer Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, working in the employ of Spain, in January 1606. The British rediscovered the island on 3 July 1767 on a voyage led by Captain Philip Carteret, and named it after the fifteen-year-old Robert Pitcairn (a son of the soldier John Pitcairn) who was the crew member who first spotted the island; he was lost at sea three years later. Carteret, who sailed without the newly-invented marine chronometer, charted the island at , and although the latitude was reasonably accurate, his recorded longitude was incorrect by about 3° () west of the island. When the &quot;Bounty&quot; mutineers arrived on Pitcairn, it was uninhabited; however, a large number of archaeological items remained, such as marae, tiki carvings, adzes and adze flakes, rock carvings and petroglyphs.

The Polynesians that disappeared may have later migrated to a bigger island further to the southeast at Easter Island, where it has been noted that the jumping-off points for the early Polynesian colonization of Easter Island originally from Mangareva are more likely to have been from Pitcairn and Henderson, which lie about halfway between Mangareva and Easter. It has been observed that there is great similarity with the Rapa Nui language and Early Mangarevan, similarities between a statue found in Pitcairn and some statues found in Easter Island, the resemblance of tool styles in Easter Island to those in Mangareva and Pitcairn, and correspondences of skulls found in Easter Island to two skulls found in Henderson, all suggesting Pitcairn and Henderson islands to have been early stepping-stones from Mangareva to Easter Island, which in 1999, a voyage with reconstructed Polynesian boats was able to reach Easter Island from Mangareva after merely a seventeen and a half day voyage.

== British and Tahitian settlement ==

After leaving Tahiti on 22 September 1789, Christian sailed &quot;Bounty&quot; west in search of a safe haven. He then formed the idea of settling on Pitcairn Island, far to the east of Tahiti; the island had been reported in 1767, but its exact location was never verified. After months of searching, Christian rediscovered the island on 15 January 1790, east of its recorded position. This longitudinal error contributed to the mutineers&#x27; decision to settle on Pitcairn.

The group consisted of British sailors Fletcher Christian, Ned Young, John Adams, Matthew Quintal, William Brown, Isaac Martin, John Mills and John Williams; William McCoy; six Polynesian men (Manarii/Menalee, Niau/Nehou, and Teirnua/Te Moa from Tahiti; Taroamiva/Tetahiti and Oher/Hu from Tubuai; and Taruro/Talalo/Tullaloo from Raiatea by way of Tahiti) and twelve Tahitian women (Maimiti/Isabella, Teehuteatuaonoa/Jenny, Teraura/Susanah, Teio/Mary, Vahineatua/Bal&#x27;hadi/Prudence, Obuarei/Puarai, Tevarua/Sarah, Teatuahitea/Sarah, Faahotu/Fasto, Toofaiti/Hutia/Nancy, Mareva, and Tinafornea) as well as a Tahitian baby girl named Sarah/Sally, daughter of Teio, who would become a respected person in the community. 

On arrival, the ship was unloaded and stripped of most of its masts and spars, for use on the island. On 23 January, five days after their arrival, as the seamen discussed whether to burn the ship, Quintal set the ship ablaze and destroyed it, either as an agreed-upon precaution against discovery or as an unauthorised act. There was now no means of escape.

The island proved an ideal haven for the mutineers—uninhabited and virtually inaccessible, with plenty of food, water, and fertile land. For a while, the mutineers and Tahitians existed peaceably. Christian settled down with Isabella; a son, Thursday October Christian, was the first child born on the island, and others followed. Christian&#x27;s authority as leader gradually diminished, and he became prone to long periods of brooding and introspection.



=== Racial tensions ===

Gradually, tensions and rivalries arose over the increasing extent to which the Europeans regarded the Tahitians as their property, in particular the women who, according to Alexander, were &quot;passed around from one &#x27;husband&#x27; to the other&quot;. The lower-caste Tahitian man, Hu, was often a victim of the white men&#x27;s beatings and abuse. Martin treated the islanders including his wife with disdain, causing increasing discord. McCoy figured out how to distill brandy from ti-root and built a still. He, Quintal, and some of the women were continually drunk. In 1791, after working side-by-side with the islanders to perform the daily tasks that sustained the colony, some of the seamen decided to loaf in the shade all day while they coerced the Polynesian men to complete the tasks too hard for the women to perform.

Quintal and McCoy required the unmarried man Te Moa to do all their work, and Martin and Mills similarly abused the other lower-caste islander, Nihau. McCoy and Quintal often abused and bullied both the Polynesian women and men. Rosalind Young, a descendant of Ned Young, relayed a story handed down to her that Tevarua went fishing one day but failed to catch enough fish to satisfy Quintal. He punished her by biting off her ear. He may have been drunk at the time, because he and William McCoy were drunk most of the time, consuming McCoy&#x27;s brandy. Tevarua fell—or, some believe, killed herself, by leaping off a cliff in 1799. The two Tahitian noblemen, Minarii and Tetahiti, still enjoyed lives of relative independence and dignity.

John Williams had sex with Hutia, the wife of Tararu, and the Tahitian leader Minarii attacked him over this insult to Minarii&#x27;s family. Williams&#x27; wife Fasto died soon after, possibly by suicide, after learning of her husband&#x27;s infidelity. Hu and Tararu plotted to kill the white men in retribution. Hu tried unsuccessfully to kill Martin by pushing him off a cliff. After Fasto died, Williams took Hutia away from Tararu to live with him, and Tararu tried and failed to murder Williams. Hutia decided to poison Tararu in retaliation and unwittingly killed both Tararu and Hu.

McCoy decided to put to a vote a proposal that the arable land be divided among the seamen, excluding the Polynesians. Christian strongly objected. He reminded the Englishmen that on Tahiti, where Minarii and Tetahiti had been chiefs, landless men were deemed outcasts. McCoy&#x27;s proposal carried by a vote of five to four. When Tetahiti learned of the vote, he went to Minarii to discuss the issue with him, only to find him standing near a pile of smoldering ashes. Quintal had burned the chieftain&#x27;s new home.

=== Massacre day ===

On 20 September 1793, the four remaining Polynesian men stole muskets and set out to kill all of the Englishmen. Within hours they beheaded Martin and Mills, shot Williams and Brown dead, and fatally wounded Christian in a carefully executed series of murders. Christian was set upon while working in his fields, first shot and then butchered with an axe; his last words, supposedly, were: &quot;Oh, dear!&quot; Three of the Englishmen&#x27;s wives took revenge, killing Te Moa and Niuha. Teraura, the wife of Ned Young, beheaded Tetahiti while he slept. Quintal killed Minarii in a violent fight.

=== Adams leads women and children ===

Young and Adams assumed leadership and secured a tenuous calm disrupted by the drunken behaviour of McCoy and Quintal. The two men and some of the women spent their days in an alcoholic stupor. Some of the women attempted to leave the island in a makeshift boat but could not launch it successfully.

On 20 April 1798, McCoy attached a rock to his neck with a rope and leapt over a cliff to his death. Quintal became increasingly erratic. He demanded to take Isabella, Fletcher Christian&#x27;s widow, as his wife, and threatened to kill Christian&#x27;s children if his demands were not granted. Ned Young and John Adams invited him to Young&#x27;s home. There they overpowered him, and killed him with an axe.

Young and Adams became interested in Christianity, and Young taught Adams to read using the Bounty&#x27;s Bible. Young died of an asthma attack in 1800. Adams lived until 1829.

=== Contact reestablished ===


After Young succumbed to asthma in 1800, Adams took responsibility for the education and well-being of the nine remaining women and 19 children. Using the ship&#x27;s Bible from &quot;Bounty&quot;, he taught literacy and Christianity, and kept peace on the island. This was the situation in February 1808, when the American sealer &quot;Topaz&quot; commanded by Mayhew Folger came unexpectedly upon Pitcairn, landed, and discovered the, by then, thriving community. News of &quot;Topaz&quot;″s discovery did not reach Britain until 1810, when it was overlooked by an Admiralty preoccupied by war with France.

In 1814, two British warships, and HMS &quot;Tagus&quot;, chanced upon Pitcairn. Among those who greeted them were Thursday October Christian and George Young (Edward Young&#x27;s son). The captains, Sir Thomas Staines and Philip Pipon, reported that Christian&#x27;s son displayed &quot;in his benevolent countenance, all the features of an honest English face&quot;. On shore they found a population of 46 mainly young islanders led by Adams, upon whom the islanders&#x27; welfare was wholly dependent, according to the captains&#x27; report. After receiving Staines&#x27;s and Pipon&#x27;s report, the Admiralty decided to take no action.

Henderson Island was rediscovered on 17 January 1819 by British Captain James Henderson of the British East India Company ship &quot;Hercules&quot;. Captain Henry King, sailing on &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, landed on 2 March to find the king&#x27;s colours already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship into a tree. Oeno Island was discovered on 26 January 1824 by American captain George Worth aboard the whaler .

In 1832, a Church Missionary Society missionary arrived. He reported that by March 1833, he had founded a Temperance Society to combat drunkenness, a &quot;Maundy Thursday Society&quot;, a monthly prayer meeting, a juvenile society, a Peace Society, and a school.

In the following years, many ships called at Pitcairn Island and heard Adams&#x27;s various stories of the foundation of the Pitcairn settlement. Adams died in 1829, honoured as the founder and father of a community that became celebrated over the next century as an exemplar of Victorian morality. Over the years, many recovered &quot;Bounty&quot; artefacts have been sold by islanders as souvenirs; in 1999, the Pitcairn Project was established by a consortium of Australian academic and historical bodies, to survey and document all the material remaining on-site, as part of a detailed study of the settlement&#x27;s development.

The Pitcairners were visited often by ships. During the 1820s, three British adventurers named John Buffett, John Evans and George Nobbs settled on the island and married children of the mutineers. Following Adams&#x27;s death in 1829, a power vacuum emerged. Nobbs, a veteran of the British and Chilean navies, was Adams&#x27;s chosen successor, but Buffett and Thursday October Christian, the son of Fletcher and the first child born on the island, who had the task of greeting visiting ships, were also important leaders during this time.

=== Resettlement ===

Fearing overcrowding, the islanders requested the British government transport them to Tahiti. In 1831 the British government relocated the islanders there. But they found it unlike the home they remembered, full of &quot;immorality, saloons, vile dances, gambling, and scarlet women.&quot; The descendants could not adapt to the changes in Tahiti, and a dozen people, including Thursday October Christian, had died of disease. The islanders were now even more leaderless, as alcoholism became a problem. They returned to Pitcairn after six months, aboard the ship of William Driver.

=== New settlers ===

In 1832, an adventurer named Joshua Hill, claiming to be an agent of Britain, arrived on the island and was elected leader, styling himself President of the Commonwealth of Pitcairn. He ordered Buffett, Evans and Nobbs to be exiled, banned alcohol and ordered imprisonments for the slightest infractions. He was eventually driven off the island in 1838, and a British ship captain helped the islanders draw up a law code. The islanders set up a system whereby they would elect a chief magistrate every year as the leader of the island.

Other important positions on the island were those of schoolmaster, doctor and pastor. Nobbs, however, was the effective leader of the island. Under this law code, Pitcairn became the first British colony in the Pacific and also the second country in the world, after Corsica under Pasquale Paoli in 1755, to give women the right to vote.

=== British colony ===

Traditionally, Pitcairn Islanders consider that their islands &quot;officially&quot; became a British colony on 30 November 1838, at the same time becoming one of the first territories to extend voting rights to women.

=== Move to Norfolk Island ===

By the mid-1850s the Pitcairn community was outgrowing the island and they appealed to Queen Victoria for help. Queen Victoria offered them Norfolk Island. In 1856, all 163 residents boarded &quot;Morayshire&quot; and crossed the Pacific to Norfolk Island, formerly a prison colony, an isolated rock between the North Island of New Zealand and New Caledonia. They arrived on 8 June after a miserable five-week trip. Eighteen months later, sixteen returned, and they were followed by 27 others in 1864.

In 1858, while the island was uninhabited, survivors of the shipwreck of the clipper &quot;Wild Wave&quot; spent several months there until rescued by . These visitors had dismantled some houses for wood and nails and had vandalised John Adams&#x27; grave. The island was also nearly annexed by France, whose government did not realise that the island had just been inhabited. George Nobbs and John Buffett stayed on Norfolk Island. By this time, an American family named Warren settled on Pitcairn Island.

During the 1860s further immigration to the island was banned. In 1886 the Seventh-day Adventist layman John Tay visited Pitcairn and persuaded most of the islanders to convert from the Church of England to his faith. He returned in 1890 on the missionary schooner with an ordained minister to perform baptisms. Since then, the majority of Pitcairn Islanders have been Adventists.

Important leaders of Pitcairn during this time were Thursday October Christian II, Simon Young and James Russell McCoy. McCoy, who was sent to England for education as a child, spent much of his later life on missionary journeys. In 1887, Britain officially annexed the island, and it was officially put under the jurisdiction of the governors of Fiji.

=== Late 19th century ===

 visited Pitcairn Island on 18 April 1881 and &quot;found the people very happy and contented, and in perfect health&quot;. At that time the population was 96, an increase of six since the visit of Admiral de Horsey in September 1878. Stores had recently been delivered from friends in England, including two whale-boats and Portland cement, which was used to make the reservoir watertight. HMS &quot;Thetis&quot; gave the islanders of biscuits, of candles, and 100 lb of soap and clothing to the value of £31, donated by the ship&#x27;s company. An American trading ship called &quot;Venus&quot; had recently bestowed a supply of cotton seed, to provide the islanders with a crop for future trade.

One crime of note during this time was that of a double murder committed in June 1897, and which concerned Harry Albert Christian, great-grandson of Fletcher Christian. 
Christian admitted having murdered, for jealous reasons, one of the island women, Julia Warren and her child, the bodies of which he subsequently threw into the sea. The bodies of the victims were never found. 

A commission was brought to Pitcairn onboard HMS &quot;Royalist&quot; in order for Christian to undergo trial for murder. 
Having been found guilty Christian was sentenced to death and detained, under effective house arrest, until he was put onboard HMS &quot;Royalist&quot; and transferred to Suva, Fiji. Christian was hanged at Suva Gaol on October 8, 1898.

=== 20th century ===
The islands of Henderson, Oeno and Ducie were annexed by Britain in 1902: Henderson on 1 July, Oeno on 10 July, and Ducie on 19 December. The population peaked at 233 in 1937. It has since decreased owing to emigration, primarily to Australia and New Zealand. In 1938, the three islands, along with Pitcairn, were incorporated into a single administrative unit called the &quot;Pitcairn Group of Islands&quot;. By the 1930s and 1940s, diminished shipping and tourism to the island resulted in the residents selling many of the pre-European cultural items and &quot;Bounty&quot;-related paraphernalia to private individuals for income. In 1940 and 1941, the British government sent Henry Evans Maude and his wife Honor Maude to the islands to modernise the government, and to establish a post office and issue stamps in order to generate revenue for the people.

== Current society==
During the 20th century, most of the chief magistrates have been from the Christian and Young families, and contact with the outside world continued to increase. In 1970 the British high commissioners of New Zealand became the governors of Pitcairn. Since August 2022 the governor has been Iona Thomas, OBE. In 1999 the position of chief magistrate was replaced by the position of mayor. Another change for the community is the decline of the Adventist church, where there are now only eight regular worshippers.

Since the population peaked at 233 in 1937, the island has suffered from emigration, primarily to New Zealand, leaving current population of 47. The islands rely heavily on tourism and landing fees as their main source of income as well as shipments from New Zealand.

=== Sex crimes convictions ===

On 30 September 2004, seven male residents of Pitcairn, about one-third of the male population, and six others living abroad, were tried on 55 sex-related offences. Among the accused was Steve Christian, Pitcairn&#x27;s Mayor, who faced several charges of rape, indecent assault, and child abuse. On 25 October 2004, six men were convicted, including Steve Christian. A seventh, the island&#x27;s former Magistrate Jay Warren, was acquitted. In 2004, the islanders surrendered about 20 firearms ahead of the sexual assault trials.

After the six men lost their final appeal, the British government set up a prison on the island at Bob&#x27;s Valley. The men began serving their sentences in late 2006. By 2010, all had served their sentences or been granted home detention status.

In 2010, mayor Mike Warren was charged with 25 counts of possessing child pornography on his computer. In 2016, Warren was found guilty of downloading more than 1,000 images and videos of child sexual abuse. Warren began downloading the images some time after the 2004 sexual assault convictions. During the time he downloaded the images, he was working in child protection. Warren was also convicted of engaging in a &quot;sex chat&quot; with someone he believed was a 15-year-old girl.

=== First female Mayor ===
Charlene Warren-Peu (born 9 June 1979) was elected in 2019 as Mayor of the Pitcairn Islands. She is the first woman to hold the position on a permanent basis. She previously served as Deputy Mayor and was on the Island Council.

<text>Soochow University () is a private university in Taipei, Taiwan. Soochow University maintains a church and a Methodist minister in residence, though it may be considered a secular institution. The university is noted for studies in comparative law and accounting.

==History==

The original Soochow University was founded by Methodists in Suzhou, Jiangsu, Qing dynasty in 1900 as a merger of three institutions: the Buffington Institute and the Kung Hang School in the city of Soochow (now spelled Suzhou), in Jiangsu Province, and the Anglo-Chinese College in Shanghai.

After the Chinese Civil War, members of the Soochow Alumni Association who fled to Taiwan established a new institution there in 1951. A law school was opened in 1954, and a full university was certified in 1971.

Meanwhile in Suzhou, the original university merged with the Southern Jiangsu College of Culture and Education and the Department of Mathematics and Physics at Jiangnan University to form the &quot;Jiangsu Teacher&#x27;s College&quot; in 1952, which revived the name Soochow University in 1982. However, while the English names are identical, the one in Suzhou uses the Chinese name 蘇州 (Soochow), not the original 
東吳 (Tung-wu).

The campus is home to the tomb of the prominent Chinese politician and diplomat Wang Ch&#x27;unghui, who fled to Taiwan after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949.

In 2014, the Japan–Taiwan Exchange Association listed Soochow University as one of the seven well-known Taiwanese universities.

== Academics ==
=== Publications ===
In 1981, the first joint-issued class-made magazine, completely founded by students, called &quot;Xu Ai&quot;, appeared in Soochow University. Students voiced political opinions as to temporal society, but the magazine was quickly banned by the strong commend of the college.

However, the next year, the political students published another critical magazine, &quot;Monthly Political Magazine of Soochow University&quot;. It was banned, a result from publishing an advertisement of &quot;Shen Geng&quot;, which was a magazine of the Chinese Nationalist Party control.

On 9 September 1982, the Academic Conference of Political Department organized an audit for second year students about Taipei City Council. But the lead teacher Huang Erxuan was charged by leading a group of students to the council to listen the interpolation produced by the outside party senator. He was fired the next year.

===Ranking===
==Excellent Long-Established University Consortium of Taiwan==
Soochow University is a member of the Excellent Long-Established University Consortium of Taiwan (ELECT), which is an organization devoted to inter-school cooperation and sharing resources between schools. The twelve union universities were all founded over half a century with each of their own strengths covering professional fields of science and technology, commerce, agronomy, medicine, media, law, education, art and design, etc. These schools allow students to have multiple options, cross-domain learning and a broader adaptive development for their education.

==Campus==


Soochow University in Taiwan has two branches: a downtown branch near the Republic of China (ROC) presidential office in Taipei&#x27;s Zhongzheng district and the main campus near the National Palace Museum in Taipei&#x27;s Shilin district. The law and business colleges are in the downtown campus. All other colleges are located in the main campus.

=== Shilin Campus ===
The Shilin Campus is in the mountainous terrain of the Shilin District. 

Faculty and student housing are available on the main campus although they cannot meet demand. There are three female student dorms and two male student dorms with a total occupancy of 1,500. Many students commute to campus by bus and the subway system.

=== Downtown Campus ===
The Downtown Campus is in the Zhongzheng District.

==Organization==
Taiwan&#x27;s first private university is headed by a president and a board of trustees. The University is divided into six schools or colleges, each having a variety of departments:

===School of Arts and Social Science===
*Department of Chinese Literature
*Department of History
*Department of Philosophy
*Department of Political Science
*Department of Sociology
*Department of Social Work
*Department of Music

==Sports==
Sports play an important role in campus life. The downtown campus has tennis and basketball courts. The main campus has indoor and outdoor basketball courts, tennis courts, a race track, a mini rock climbing wall, and a field that is used for softball and soccer. Each year the university holds two major student athletic events.

Much of the sports facilities on the main campus are on land owned by the Taipei city government rather than by the university. The city government has considered reclaiming the land to build an expressway but has decided to back off with this project.

==Clubs==
The university has 183 student clubs or societies, such as Association for Diplomacy Research (SCU A.D.R.).

==Traditions==

*24-hour International Ultramarathon: Runners from several countries, students, faculty, and celebrities such as Ryoichi Sekiya and Mami Kudo participate in this annual event. Only very few of the contestants venture running for the entire duration of the marathon. Portable toilets are set up near the race track with one or two toilets reserved for certain internationally renowned runners. Some spectators set up tents near the track and camp the entire night watching the marathon.
*Campus Christmas Carol: Students from the music department visit the faculty residential apartment complexes sing Christmas carols on Christmas Eve. Having people singing carols in the neighborhood is a rare sight in Taiwan since Christians make up a small minority of the population.

<text>Mount Dandenong, sometimes styled as Mt. Dandenong, is a township and suburb of the Greater Melbourne area in Victoria, Australia, east of the Melbourne central business district (CBD), located within the local government area of the Shire of Yarra Ranges. Mount Dandenong recorded a population of 1,271 at the 2021 census.

Light to moderate snowfalls occur on Mount Dandenong a few times most years, mostly frequently between late winter and late spring. The area around Mount Dandenong experienced a highly unusual summer snow fall on Christmas Day 2006.

==History==

Originally the town was to be named Mount Corhanwarrabul, but due to the problems that were foreseen with the spelling and pronunciation of this name, the Surveyor-General&#x27;s office opted to name it Mount Dandenong. However, today there is still a Mount Corhanwarrabul, which is on the site of Burkes Lookout. The town of Mount Dandenong was settled in 1893, along with a neighbouring town, Olinda. It was around this time that the Government established farms that would be used to harvest timber.

By around 1900 the town had its own general store and primary school. The Post Office, opened in 1902, was closed and replaced by one at Kalorama in 1991. In 1922 the first motorcars were seen in operation in Mount Dandenong.

In 1938, the 1938 Kyeema Crash occurred eighteen people were killed when the Kyeema, an Australian National Airways DC-2, VH-UYC crashed.

A proposal around 2002 for the building of a large &quot;Melbourne&quot; sign on the mountain, similar to the Hollywood sign, was vigorously opposed and not pursued.

==Climate==
Mount Dandenong has a cool oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), with cool to mild summers and cold, damp winters. Daytime temperatures are usually 4−6 °C cooler than downtown Melbourne due to its elevation and distance from the urban heat island effect of Melbourne. It is significantly cloudier than Melbourne, particularly in the winter due to the heavy orographic lifting brought about by cold fronts.

<text>A dance card or &quot;programme du bal&quot; (also known by its German-language name, &quot;Tanzkarte&quot;) is used by a woman to record the names of the men with whom she intends to dance each successive dance at a formal ball.

==History==
Dance cards appear to have originated in the 18th century, but their use first became widespread in 19th-century Vienna, especially at the large balls during Fasching before Lent.
A dance card is typically a booklet with a decorative cover, listing dance titles, composers, and the person with whom the woman intended to dance. Typically, it would have a cover indicating the sponsoring organization of the ball and a decorative cord by which it could be attached to a lady&#x27;s wrist or ball gown. From the 19th century until World War I, dance cards for the elite of Austria-Hungary were often very elaborate, with some even incorporating precious metals and jewels.

==Modern times==
In modern times the expression &quot;dance card&quot; is often used metaphorically, as when someone says &quot;pencil me into your dance card,&quot; meaning &quot;find some time to spend with me&quot;. Conversely, claiming one&#x27;s &quot;dance card is full&quot; implies that even though they may be interested, they have no time for another person.

==Air crews==
U.S. Air Force aircrews in general, and those involved in flight tests in particular, use the term to describe the first card in a &quot;deck&quot; of flight or test maneuver cards. The &quot;dance card&quot; contains administrative data about the mission, aircraft, and aircrew as well as a list of the maneuvers to be flown. The card serves as a table of contents for the mission and a quick reference for the aircrew&#x27;s use during the flight.
