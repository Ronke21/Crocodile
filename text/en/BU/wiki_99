<text>Rose Tattoo are an Australian rock and roll band, now led by Angry Anderson, which formed in Sydney in 1976. Their sound is hard rock mixed with blues rock influences, with songs including &quot;Bad Boy for Love&quot;, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Outlaw&quot;, &quot;Nice Boys&quot;, &quot;We Can&#x27;t Be Beaten&quot; and &quot;Scarred for Life&quot;. Their first four albums were produced by Harry Vanda and George Young who also worked with AC/DC. They disbanded in 1987, subsequently reforming briefly in 1993 to support Guns N&#x27; Roses on an Australian tour. They reassembled again from 1998 and have since released two more studio albums.

According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane, Rose Tattoo are &quot;one of the most revered bands of all time. The Tatts played peerless, street-level heavy blues with the emphasis on slide guitar and strident lyric statements&quot;. Guns N&#x27; Roses, L.A. Guns, Keel, Nashville Pussy, Motosierra, Pud Spuke, Helen Schneider, Skrewdriver, and the Uruguayan band the Knight&#x27;s Night have covered Rose Tattoo songs. On 16 August 2006, they were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame.

Seven former members have died. These include four of the early recording line-up: Dallas Royall (1991), Peter Wells (2006), Ian Rilen (2006), Lobby Loyde (2007), Mick Cocks (2009), Neil Smith (2013) and John Meyer (2020). Five of these died from cancer: Royall, Wells, Rilen, Loyde, and Cocks.

==History==
===Early years (1976–1977)===

Rose Tattoo were formed in Sydney in 1976 with Leigh Johnston on rhythm guitar, Tony Lake on lead vocals and they were led by slide guitarist Peter Wells — who had departed as bass guitarist of heavy metal band, Buffalo. Drummer Michael Vandersluys completed the line-up. Ian Rilen from Band of Light joined on bass guitar. He had taught himself to play while in prison and gave Wells&#x27; band the street-cred he was looking for. Rhythm guitarist Mick Cocks soon replaced Johnston; Lake and Vandersluys were substituted by former Buster Brown members Angry Anderson and Dallas &quot;Digger&quot; Royall, respectively. Melbourne-based Buster Brown had played at the 1974 Sunbury Festival and had included future AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd. Rose Tattoo had an early performance on New Year&#x27;s Eve at the local rock club, Chequers.

Chiefly inspired by the Rolling Stones, Faces and Billy Thorpe and his 1970s Aztecs, Rose Tattoo&#x27;s hard-rocking sound quickly earned a following in the Sydney area. Members of AC/DC were fans and recommended them to their label, Albert Productions. The band&#x27;s debut, single &quot;Bad Boy for Love&quot;, was written by Rilen, who left to form punk rock group X (not the L.A. band) prior to its release in October 1977. &quot;Bad Boy for Love&quot; was produced by Vanda &amp; Young (ex-The Easybeats, AC/DC&#x27;s producers) and peaked at No. 19 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. Initially Cocks switched to bass guitar to cover Rilen&#x27;s departure, then Chris Turner (ex-Buffalo) joined on bass guitar. The band toured nationally on the pub rock circuit competing with the Angels, Cold Chisel, Dragon and Kevin Borich Express.

===Self titled debut, success and follow-up albums (1978–1982)===
One-time Buster Brown bass guitarist Geordie Leach was recruited to record their self-titled debut LP, &quot;Rose Tattoo&quot;, which reached the top 40 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart in November 1978. The album, produced by Vanda &amp; Young, was released in some markets as &quot;Rock N&#x27; Roll Outlaw&quot; after their second single, &quot;Rock N&#x27; Roll Outlaw&quot; which did not reach the top 50. Leach left the band in May 1979 to be replaced in October by guitarist Lobby Loyde filling in on bass guitar (Coloured Balls, Purple Hearts, Wild Cherries). During his brief tenure, they recorded &quot;Legalise Realise&quot; which was released as an independent split single in March 1980, the other track, &quot;Bong on Aussie&quot;, was by country singer Colin Paterson, to publicise a campaign to legalise marijuana. Later in 1980, they toured the United States and then toured Europe (including United Kingdom), but by September Loyde had left and Leach returned.

Early in 1981, &quot;Rock N&#x27; Roll Outlaw&quot; started to chart in Europe, peaking at No. 2 in France, No. 5 in Germany and No. 60 in UK. The line up of Anderson, Cocks, Leach, Royall and Wells toured Europe from April. Three years after their debut the band issued the follow-up album, &quot;Assault and Battery&quot; in September, which reached the top 30 in Australia. Both &quot;Rock N&#x27; Roll Outlaw&quot; and &quot;Assault and Battery&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the UK heavy metal albums chart. Rose Tattoo&#x27;s 1981 tour of Europe included an appearance at the Reading Festival, where Anderson repeatedly head butted the amp stacks until his scalp started bleeding. They were hailed as the loudest band to play London&#x27;s Marquee Club since Led Zeppelin.

Returning to Australia, the band began work on their third album; with new guitarist Robin Riley replacing Cocks, who went on to join Heaven, they issued &quot;Scarred for Life&quot; in 1982, subsequently touring the US in support of Aerosmith and ZZ Top. The band&#x27;s US visit was not a major success but proved to be influential on the underground sleaze metal scene in Los Angeles, with bands such as Guns N&#x27; Roses which later cited Rose Tattoo as a favourite and recorded a cover of &quot;Nice Boys&quot; on &quot;Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&quot; in 1986.

===&quot;Southern Stars&quot; and &quot;Beats from a Single Drum&quot; (1983–1986)===
In 1983, after the US tour, Riley, Royall and Wells all left. The remaining duo of Anderson and Leach recruited guitarists Greg Jordan and John Meyer from Perth progressive metal band Saracen. With drummer Scott Johnston (Jimmy and the Boys, Outline, Kids in the Kitchen, Flash in the Pan, Swannee, Peter Wells) the band recorded 1984&#x27;s &quot;Southern Stars&quot;, their last album for Albert Productions and Vanda &amp; Young as producers. Leach then exited to join Cocks, Rilen, Royall and Wells in Illustrated Men, which toured during 1984–85.

Anderson took time out to play the character &#x27;Ironbar&#x27; Bassey in the 1985 film, &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot;. That year Rose Tattoo, with the line-up of Anderson, Johnston, Meyer, Andy Cichon (bass) and Tim Gaze (slide guitar), released a cover of Steppenwolf&#x27;s &quot;Born to be Wild&quot;, their first release for Mushroom Records. Meyer left and the group recorded 1986&#x27;s &quot;Beats from a Single Drum&quot; as a four-piece for Mushroom. Soon after Anderson started his solo career and the band separated by the end of 1987. The album was subsequently re-released as Anderson&#x27;s first solo album, with the ballad, &quot;Suddenly&quot;, as his debut solo single. However, Anderson has admitted regret in recording the pop/ballad-oriented album. &quot;Suddenly&quot; had little chart success until it was used on TV soap opera, &quot;Neighbours&quot; for the wedding of characters Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) and Charlene Mitchell (Kylie Minogue). &quot;Suddenly&quot; peaked at No. 2 in September 1987 and was kept out of top spot by Minogue&#x27;s own debut single, &quot;Locomotion&quot;.

===Side projects and temporary reformations (1988–1997)===
In the early 1990s, Anderson tried to reunite Rose Tattoo, but Dallas Royall died in 1991, of cancer when being treated for his heroin addiction and alcoholism, which delayed that reformation. Anderson explained to Nick Milligan in March 2011, &quot;I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the &#x27;Bound for Glory&#x27; single came off and I was hanging around with the Gunners and a lot of other LA bad boy rock bands that we supposedly influenced. I realised then that apart from the fact that I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said &#x27;Let&#x27;s reform. We&#x27;ve been apart for three years or more.&#x27; It was long enough for us to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal. I rang up each of the original members that were still interested and they all said, &#x27;Yeah, let&#x27;s get together.&#x27; So I said we should negotiate a deal where the band can come over and record in Los Angeles. But, of course, that was the year that our original drummer &quot;Digger&quot; Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform. We didn&#x27;t reform until &#x27;92&quot;.

Rose Tattoo supported Guns N&#x27; Roses on the Australian leg of their Use Your Illusion Tour. Anderson, Wells, Cocks, Leach were joined by new drummer, Paul DeMarco, from Wells&#x27; solo band reunited for the 1993 tour. The reunion was brief as each returned to solo projects. Around this time, some ex-members of Rose Tattoo formed a short lived band with ex-Candy Harlots vocalist, Aiz Lynch. It had numerous rehearsals, but only recorded one demo before disbanding.

===Second reformation: &quot;Pain&quot; to &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; (1998–2010)===
Rose Tattoo, with original bassist Ian Rilen replacing Leach, reformed yet again in 1998 for the &quot;All Hell Breaks Loose!!&quot; tour, however Rilen remained with the band only for the duration of this tour. By the following year, Leach had returned to the fold once more, although his place was taken by Steve King in 2000.

Since that time Rose Tattoo has toured regularly around Australia and throughout Europe. In 2000, the band appeared at the Wacken Open Air festival as part of their tour. These shows formed the basis of the &quot;25 to Life&quot; live album. At the &quot;Gimme Ted&quot; benefit concert on 10 March 2001 the group performed five songs. 2002 saw the release of &quot;Pain&quot;, the band&#x27;s first studio album in 16 years. Cocks rejoined the group and they prepared material for a future album.

Plans for their next album, &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; were disrupted when Wells died on 27 March 2006, four years after his diagnosis of prostate cancer. On 16 August Rose Tattoo were inducted by musician Sarah McLeod, into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame alongside former member Lobby Loyde and Daddy Cool, Divinyls, Icehouse and Helen Reddy. Anderson had informed Wells of the forthcoming induction, &quot;He was chuffed, I was so glad he knew about it. It&#x27;s good we&#x27;re getting recognized for the music. We&#x27;ve gone out and done it our own way, to our detriment or to our betterment.&quot; Founding member Ian Rilen died on 30 October from bladder cancer. One of his last public appearances was at the Hall of Fame induction.
Also in October, a number of Rose Tattoo songs were voted upon and ranked in the Triple M Essential 2006 Countdown of songs, including &quot;Bad Boy for Love&quot; (voted No. 1060 out of 2006) and &quot;We Can&#x27;t Be Beaten&quot; (voted No. 397 out of 2006). That month they were one of 55 acts voted and played in Triple J&#x27;s &quot;Impossible Music Festival&quot; of 2006, with their live recording of a gig performed on New Year&#x27;s Day 1980 at Mount Druitt, New South Wales being selected out of over 1000 &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot; recordings over the radio station&#x27;s 31-year history.

On 21 April 2007, Lobby Loyde died, aged 65, two years after being diagnosed with lung cancer. In June, Rose Tattoo supported Guns N&#x27; Roses with Sebastian Bach on their Chinese Democracy Tour&#x27;s Australian leg. In October they supported Motörhead on their Australian tour dates. In an interview with Australian rock magazine &quot;Unbelievably Bad&quot;, Anderson announced his intention to retire the band after one more album.

In 2008 they played the Download Festival in England. In April 2009 it was announced that guitarist Mick Cocks had liver cancer – he died on 22 December. By 2010 five former members had died of various cancers – Dallas Royall (throat cancer, 1991), Peter Wells (prostate cancer, 2006), Ian Rilen (bladder cancer, 2006), Lobby Loyde (lung cancer, 2007) and Mick Cocks (liver cancer, 2009).

===Final statement to &quot;Outlaws&quot; (2011–current)===
Rose Tattoo celebrated their 35th anniversary in 2011. They were demo-ing songs for a proposed new album and Anderson had told Milligan that it would be the group&#x27;s &quot;final statement&quot; but that did not eventuate. They were uncertain of continuing when DeMarco was arrested in September 2014: he pled guilty to gun supply offences and was sentenced to a minimum of six years jail. On 5 August 2017 a new line-up of Anderson, Dai Pritchard, Bob Spencer, Mark Evans and John &quot;Watto&quot; Watson was announced. In August 2018 a new drummer joined, Jackie Barnes, the son of Australian vocalist, Jimmy Barnes.

The band toured Europe during March 2020 with Justin Ngariki on drums. They released a new album, &quot;Outlaws&quot;, on Cleopatra Records in that month. In May 2020, they were due to tour the US for the first time since 1982, but the tour was deferred due to COVID-19 restrictions. &quot;Outlaws&quot; is a re-recording of the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Rose Tattoo&quot;, plus three early songs, which did not appear on the 1978 release: &quot;Snow Queen&quot;, &quot;Sweet Love (Rock n Roll)&quot; and &quot;Rosetta&quot;. Anderson provided the reasons behind making the album, &quot;Honouring the past and respecting the future.&quot; It was recorded at Hercules Studio, Sydney by Mark Opitz and Tim McArtney. It was produced by Opitz, and mixed by Opitz, Spencer and McArtney. Liner notes were written by the author, Murray Engleheart.
On 1 September 2020 it was announced through Rose Tattoo&#x27;s social media that John Meyer, the group&#x27;s slide guitarist from 1983 to 1985, had died.

After 16 years of loyal service, Dai Pritchard announced his retirement from Rose Tattoo on 14 April 2021 via Facebook, leaving the band amicably to move into a new career in mental health.
When the band resumed live performances in 2022, Paul DeMarco was back behind the drums and Mick Arnold had taken over slide guitar duties.

After 5 years of loyal service Bob Spencer announced his retirement from the band via Facebook on 18 September 2022, and has been replaced by Ronnie Simmons.

<doc id="609881" wikidata="Q2233920" url="?curid=609881" title="Battle of Bayou Fourche">
<text>The Battle of Bayou Fourche, also known as the Battle of Little Rock, was a battle of the American Civil War fought between Union and Confederate forces on September 10, 1863, in Pulaski County (present-day Little Rock and North Little Rock), Arkansas. It was the final battle of the Little Rock Campaign, resulting in the Federal occupation of Little Rock.

A Union force commanded by Major General Frederick Steele had begun an advance from Helena, Arkansas, west towards Little Rock in August. The campaign met light resistance aside from the Battle of Bayou Meto, while Confederate troops under Major General Sterling Price built fortifications on the other side of the Arkansas River from Little Rock.

To avoid a direct assault on Price&#x27;s fortifications, Steele split his troops into two wings. Steele and the infantry advanced along the north bank of the Arkansas River, while Brigadier General John W. Davidson and the Federal cavalry crossed the Arkansas River to outflank the Confederates from their fortifications. On the morning of September 10, Davidson&#x27;s cavalry crossed the river and drove back a Confederate cavalry force commanded by Colonel Archibald S. Dobbins. Dobbins&#x27;s men fell back to a body of water named Bayou Fourche, where Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke took command of the Confederate forces. The bayou separated the battlefield into two spheres of action, and Davidson advanced with troops on both sides of Bayou Fourche.

After some fighting, the Confederates on the northern portion of the field were driven back and those south of the bayou retreated as well. Price had earlier decided to abandon Little Rock, and the city fell to the Union forces. The state government relocated to Washington, Arkansas, and Price withdrew his command to Arkadelphia.

== Background ==

In early March 1862 during the American Civil War, Union forces defeated Confederate troops in northwestern Arkansas during the Battle of Pea Ridge, after which most Confederate troops were transferred out of Arkansas. During the campaigning following Pea Ridge, Union troops captured the city of Helena, Arkansas, in July 1862. The Confederates rebuilt a significant fighting force in Arkansas, but were defeated at the Battle of Prairie Grove in December. Despite these setbacks, control of the Arkansas River remained in Confederate hands at the close of 1862. On January 11, 1863, Union forces captured Confederate-held Fort Hindman on the Arkansas River in the Battle of Arkansas Post, which was about from the junction of the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers. However, instead of pushing up the Arkansas River, the troops were withdrawn to fight in the Vicksburg campaign. Other Union troops stationed in Arkansas were also transferred to the operations against Vicksburg. Confederate forces in Arkansas decided to attempt to draw off some of the pressure on Vicksburg with an assault on Helena. The ensuing Battle of Helena was a bloody Confederate repulse on July 4 in which the Confederates suffered over 1,600 casualties. Vicksburg surrendered the same day.

The fall of Vicksburg freed up Union troops for an offensive against the Arkansas River Valley and Little Rock, the state capital. Defending the region was the Confederate District of Arkansas, which was under the command of the ill Lieutenant General Theophilus Holmes, who turned command over to Major General Sterling Price on July 23. On paper, the Confederates had about 32,000 men in the district, but only 14,500 had been present for duty before Helena. Expecting an assault, Price repositioned his forces and began building fortifications across the Arkansas River from Little Rock. Price believed that he could only defend Little Rock against greater Union numbers if his fortifications were directly attacked, but this was unlikely as the Arkansas River was readily crossable at several points in the area. The flanks of Price&#x27;s fortified position were covered by a swamp on one side and the Arkansas River on the other.

Federal cavalry commanded by Brigadier General John W. Davidson moved out from Wittsburg on August 1, reaching Clarendon on August 9. Another Union force, composed of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, left Helena on August 11, under the command of Major General Frederick Steele. Steele&#x27;s command numbered about 7,000 men, and Davidson&#x27;s about 6,000. The two forces joined at Clarendon, with Steele&#x27;s men arriving in stages beginning on August 15. The overall command was known as the Army of Arkansas. Steele&#x27;s men were drawn from elements of the XIII Corps and the XVI Corps and were organized into two divisions, while Davidson&#x27;s division was taken from the Department of Missouri.

The Union units suffered badly from disease, but met only minor resistance with the exception of the August 27 Battle of Bayou Meto. After a pause beginning of September 2, the Union forces resumed their advance on September 6, reaching the Arkansas River the next day and winning the Skirmish at Ashley&#x27;s Mills. Steele decided not to directly assault Price&#x27;s fortifications on the north side of the Arkansas River, instead planning on having his infantry advance along the north bank of the river while Davidson and the cavalry crossed the Arkansas River and forced the Confederates to abandon the fortifications by outflanking them. Construction of a pontoon bridge across the river began on September 9.

== Battle ==

The Confederate cavalry was greatly outnumbered by Davidson&#x27;s men on the other side of the river, and were forced to thinly guard a long line of potential crossing sites with only about 1,200 men. On the morning of September 10 at about daybreak, Confederate cannons from Etter&#x27;s Arkansas Battery and part of Pratt&#x27;s Texas Battery fired on the pontoon bridge, but were driven off by Union artillery fire. Confederate sharpshooters kept up fire on the bridge, but it was completed at about 10:00 am. Davidson feinted at another crossing about downstream, and drove the sharpshooters away with two infantry regiments and artillery fire. By 11:00 am, Davidson&#x27;s division was across the river. At around this same time, Price began withdrawing his men from the fortifications across the river from Little Rock. At this stage of the campaign, Price had 7,749 men present for duty although only about 1,250 of them were opposing Davidson. Both wings of Steele&#x27;s force combined to 10,477 men.

Davidson&#x27;s division consisted of three brigades, with those of Colonels John M. Glover and Lewis Merrill in the advance. These two brigades numbered about 2,000 men. Glover&#x27;s men were first the advance, driving back Confederate cavalry which was commanded by Colonel Archibald S. Dobbins. Dobbins&#x27;s men were driven back to Bayou Fourche, a tributary of Fourche Creek. There Dobbins ordered 500 men commanded by Colonel Robert C. Newton to make a stand. This position was a few miles from Little Rock. Price reinforced Dobbins with men from Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke&#x27;s division. Marmaduke had recently killed Dobbins&#x27;s former commanding officer, Brigadier General Lucius M. Walker, in the Marmaduke-Walker duel; Dobbins refused to serve under Marmaduke and was placed under arrest by the latter although he was soon freed by Price. Newton temporarily took command of Dobbins&#x27;s division.

The road the Union soldiers were traveling on forked near where Bayou Fourche entered the Arkansas River. The bayou ran between the two forks of the road. Glover sent the 10th Illinois Cavalry Regiment on the right fork to the north of the bayou, while the 1st Iowa Cavalry Regiment deployed on the left fork to the south of the bayou. When Merrill arrived, his brigade was ordered to the left wing. The terrain north of the bayou was wooded and was defended by three regiments and a battalion from Marmaduke&#x27;s division under the command of Colonel William Jeffers. The ground bordering the Arkansas River was a sandy beach. Jeffers&#x27;s veteran troops included the 8th Missouri Cavalry Regiment and Greene&#x27;s Missouri Cavalry Regiment. On the Union left, opposing Merrill, were Newton&#x27;s Confederates; this part of the battlefield included a cornfield in front of the Confederate lines. Newton&#x27;s force was a mixture of Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, and Louisiana troops and were positioned behind the bayou&#x27;s west levee. Merrill advanced the 8th Missouri Cavalry Regiment, which found the 1st Iowa engaged with Newton&#x27;s Confederates. The 7th Missouri Cavalry Regiment of Merrill&#x27;s brigade was detached to support an artillery battery and did not participate in the battle. Glover sent the 10th Illinois forward, along with Lovejoy&#x27;s Missouri Battery, but the Federal cavalry was repulsed after driving back Confederate skirmishers. Lovejoy&#x27;s battery was left without support and was overrun by a charge made by Jeffers&#x27;s men.

Glover changed his tactics and had the 10th Illinois and 3rd Missouri Cavalry Regiment fight dismounted, and he also had the 1st Iowa brought over from the Union left. While Glover slowly pushed Jeffers back, Merrill advanced his men but came under fire from Pratt&#x27;s battery. Part of the 25th Ohio Battery was deployed to counter the Confederate artillery fire, but the Ohio battery&#x27;s fire produced little effect and the battery was withdrawn. Bayou Fourche created communication problems for Glover and Merrill; at one point Merill&#x27;s men came under fire from their rear and Merrill feared that his position was being flanked. Instead, after investigation, the fire turned out to be overshots from Glover&#x27;s fight with Jeffers.

At around 1:00 pm, Shelby&#x27;s Iron Brigade reinforced the Confederate, under the command of Colonel Gideon W. Thompson. However, they came under enfilade fire from Steele&#x27;s artillery across the river. Confederate infantry reinforcements also arrived, but the effect of Steele&#x27;s artillery fire prevented a counterattack from occurring. Glover&#x27;s men broke through the Confederate line, and swept into the rear of Newton&#x27;s position; the Confederates withdrew. Glover accused Merrill&#x27;s men of advancing too cautiously, while Merrill claimed that his brigade&#x27;s slow advance had been due to unfamiliarity with the terrain. The Union lost 72 men during the battle; Confederate losses are not known.

== Aftermath ==
Price had ordered Little Rock abandoned after he learned that Davidson had crossed the river. Bridges, train cars, and the gunboat CSS &quot;Pontchartrain&quot; were destroyed to prevent the Union from capturing them. Glover&#x27;s men began a pursuit from Bayou Fourche to Little Rock, but were too fatigued to make it to the city. Davidson&#x27;s third brigade under Colonel John Ritter along with the 1st Iowa finishing the movement into Little Rock. Both Davidson&#x27;s cavalry and Steele&#x27;s infantry met little resistance from the Confederates. The state government relocated to Washington, Arkansas, and Price fell back to Arkadelphia. The Union captured the Little Rock Arsenal, as well as five abandoned cannons. The Confederate troops were especially demoralized by the fall of the city, and many Confederate soldiers deserted after the campaign.

== Battlefield preservation ==
Remaining portions of the Bayou Fourche Battlefield are threatened by development. The eastern engagement area where the Federal cavalry crossed the Arkansas River is being converted for lakeside residential uses. If the remaining unprotected portions of the American Civil War battlefield are to be preserved, immediate coordination is needed among local, state, and national advocates and heritage tourism proponents.

<text>Trouble Walkin&#x27; is the second full-length solo album released by Ace Frehley (two previous albums were credited to Frehley&#x27;s Comet). The album features guest performances by former Kiss drummer Peter Criss, as well as Skid Row members Sebastian Bach, Rachel Bolan and Dave Sabo.

The album peaked at No. 102 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The lone single, a cover of The Move&#x27;s &quot;Do Ya&quot;, did not chart. &quot;Hide Your Heart&quot;, co-written by Paul Stanley, first appeared on Bonnie Tyler&#x27;s &quot;Hide Your Heart&quot; album, and later appeared on Kiss&#x27; &quot;Hot in the Shade&quot;, which was released four days later. Lead vocals for &quot;2 Young 2 Die&quot; were provided by rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Richie Scarlet. Former Kiss drummer Peter Criss was thanked for his contributions which were limited to backing vocals on &quot;Hide Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Trouble Walkin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;2 Young 2 Die&quot; and &quot;Back to School&quot;.

UK-based company Rock Candy Records reissued this album on CD in 2014.

<doc id="609884" wikidata="Q3989156" url="?curid=609884" title="The Screaming Jets">
<text>The Screaming Jets are an Australian hard rock band formed in Newcastle, Australia, in 1989 by frontman Dave Gleeson (vocals), Paul Woseen (bass guitar), Grant Walmsley (guitar), Richard Lara (guitar), and Brad Heaney (drums). The band has three albums that peaked in the top five on the Australian ARIA Charts: &quot;All for One&quot; (1991), &quot;Tear of Thought&quot; (1992), &quot;The Screaming Jets&quot; (1995), and &quot;Professional Misconduct&quot; (2023). Their 1991 single &quot;Better&quot; reached No. 4 on the related singles chart. Walmsley left in 2007 and formed his own band. In 2013, bassist Paul Woseen released an acoustic solo album, &quot;Bombido&quot;.

==Biography==
===1981–1990: Early years and &quot;The Scorching Adventures of the Screaming Jets&quot;===

Dave Gleeson and Grant Walmsley met at St Francis Xavier&#x27;s College, Hamilton, in 1981 and first performed together for a school dance at the Newcastle Town Hall. They formed the group Sudden Impact in 1985, which later became Aspect. Paul Woseen joined in 1988. Richard Lara, on guitar, and Brad Heaney joined shortly after. The band was renamed Screaming Jets in 1989. The group&#x27;s first performance as The Screaming Jets was as The Love Bomb in a Newcastle pub in March 1989; they won the inaugural National Band Competition run by youth radio broadcaster Triple J in November of that year. The group relocated to Sydney in early 1990 and supported The Angels on a national tour. In May 1990, they signed with an independent label, rooArt. Their debut extended play (EP), &quot;The Scorching Adventures of the Screaming Jets&quot;, was issued in December 1990.

Through late 1990, The Screaming Jets became infamous for a series of raucous, sometimes violent, live shows. During shows to launch the debut EP, fights often broke out as the band&#x27;s faithful Newcastle fans mixed with the new Sydney fans. A show at The Kardomah Cafe in Sydney&#x27;s red-light district saw a string of casualties being ferried to the street outside with injuries including broken noses, a broken leg and numerous victims of heat exhaustion.

===1991–1994: &quot;All for One&quot;, &quot;Living in England&quot; and &quot;Tear of Thought&quot;===

In February 1991, The Screaming Jets released &quot;Better&quot;, which peaked at number 4 on the ARIA Charts. In April, their debut studio album &quot;All for One&quot; was released. The album debuted at number 3 and peaked at number 2 on the ARIA Charts. The album showed influences from Van Halen, AC/DC and The Angels. It reached the Top 50 on the ARIA End of Year Albums Chart for 1991. &quot;Stop the World&quot; and &quot;Shine On&quot; both reached the top 40. The controversial track &quot;F. R. C.&quot; (&quot;Fat Rich Cunts&quot;) was a crowd favourite and released internationally. Gleeson would dedicate the song to Michael Gudinski or Russ Hinze at concerts. At times, &quot;F. R. C.&quot; was performed by guest vocalists from Mortal Sin, The Choirboys or The Angels.

Following the album&#x27;s release, the group relocated to the United Kingdom, where they based themselves for over two years. Their second EP, &quot;Living in England&quot;, was issued in June 1992 and included cover versions of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; and AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Fun (Waiting Round to Be a Millionaire)&quot;. The EP peaked in the top 20 in July.

In October 1992, The Screaming Jets released their second studio album, &quot;Tear of Thought&quot;, which debuted at number 20 and peaked at number 3 in 1994. A cover version of Boys Next Door&#x27;s song &quot;Shivers&quot; was released in January 1993 and peaked into the Top 20. The group supported Ugly Kid Joe on their European tour in 1993, when Heaney was fired mid-tour. He was temporarily replaced by ex-Judas Priest drummer Dave Holland. Heaney was permanently replaced in the line-up by former BB Steal drummer Craig Rosevear in July 1993. In January 1994, after a US tour backing Def Leppard, Lara was replaced by Melbourne guitarist Jimi &quot;The Human&quot; Hocking (ex-Spectre 7). Both &quot;Helping Hand&quot; and &quot;Tunnel&quot; were Top 40 singles from &quot;Tear of Thought&quot;.

While the band remained only moderately successful overseas, in Australia they became one of the top-drawing live bands of the 1990s and they achieved the rare distinction of being embraced by both commercial and indie-music focused radio.

===1995–1999: &quot;The Screaming Jets&quot;, &quot;World Gone Crazy&quot; and &quot;Hits and Pieces&quot;===

In August 1995, The Screaming Jets released their third studio album, &quot;The Screaming Jets&quot;, which peaked at No. 5. It was co-produced by the band with Robbie Adams (U2). It was the first CD launched via live Webcast. The single &quot;Friend of Mine&quot;, was released in October and reached the top 50. The group continued to tour and started recording their fourth album, &quot;World Gone Crazy&quot; which was released in August 1997 and peaked into the top 20. The album was produced by Steve James and rooArt had passed their contract to BMG. Hocking had left by June and was replaced on guitar by Ismet &quot;Izzy&quot; Osmanovic (ex-Judge Mercy). BMG released a compilation album, &quot;Hits and Pieces&quot; in November 1999. One new track, &quot;I Need Your Love&quot; was issued as a single and the limited edition included an eight-track bonus disc. In November 1999, the group participated in the extensive Last Great Rock’n’Roll Show of the Century Australian tour. the group started recording their next studio album, &quot;Scam&quot;, with former Skyhooks producer Ross Wilson. By early 2000 Rosevear left to be replaced by on drums by Col Hatchman.

===2000–2003: &quot;Scam&quot;, &quot;Live Forever&quot; and hiatus===

In early 2000 Rosevear was replaced by on drums by Col Hatchman and the group recorded their next fifth studio album, &quot;Scam&quot;, with former Skyhooks producer Ross Wilson. &quot;Scam&quot; was released in October 2000 on Grudge Records through Universal Music. They were selected to tour with Kiss and Alice Cooper in 2001. In June the band performed their last concert in Newcastle before an extended break. The live album of the show was released in December 2002 as &quot;Live Forever&quot;.

On 29 August 2000, The Screaming Jets were thrown off the inaugural Brisbane to Newcastle flight for the now defunct Impulse Airlines. The new Boeing 717-200 jet had taxied to the runway for the early morning flight when it was forced to return to the terminal after band members broke into a rendition of Puff The Magic Dragon. &quot;We thought of everything to get the press and this is it,&quot; unrepentant lead vocalist Dave Gleeson said after the band was escorted from the plane by Australian Protective Services staff.

===2004–2015: &quot;Heart of the Matter&quot;, &quot;Rock On&quot; and &quot;Do Ya&quot; and infrequent touring===

In 2004 the group recommenced recording and touring. The group signed with Universal Music Australia and released &quot;Heart of the Matter&quot; in August 2004. In November 2004, Hatchman left the group, his last performance was recorded for the live &quot;Rock On&quot; album released in 2005 by Liberation Records. Hatchman was replaced by Mickl &quot;The Slayer&quot; Sayers, formerly of Sydney band Tripguage. In October 2006, four Screaming Jets songs were listed in the Triple M Essential 2006 Countdown: &quot;Helping Hand&quot; (voted 447 out of 2006), &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; (voted 683 out of 2006), &quot;Shivers&quot; (voted 1588 out of 2006) and &quot;My Badger Drinks&quot; (voted 1596 out of 2006).

Early in 2007, founding member and guitarist Walmsley left the band and was replaced by Scotty Kingman, who engineered the band&#x27;s next album. According to Gleeson, Walmsley left because his external commitments interfered with the band&#x27;s schedules. Walmsley went on to form the indie roots band Agents of Peace. In October 2008, The Screaming Jets released their sixth studio album, &quot;Do Ya&quot; through StockXchange Music. In October 2009, Osmanovich left and Hocking returned to the line-up.

Live shows from The Screaming Jets were infrequent through 2010 and 2011, and the band played only one show in 2012, at the car festival Summernats. But the band returned for a short &#x27;Best Of&#x27; tour in late 2013. In May, 2013, bassist and key songwriter Paul Woseen released his debut solo album &quot;Bombido&quot;.

===2016–2022: &quot;Chrome&quot;, &quot;Gotcha Covered&quot; and 30th anniversary edition of &quot;All for One&quot;===

In May 2016, the band released their seventh studio album, &quot;Chrome&quot;, followed by a national tour with fellow Australian band Massive in support. The album met with critical and commercial success. In March 2017, it was announced The Screaming Jets will perform a national headline tour with Baby Animals in June and July 2017.

In July 2018, The Screaming Jets released &quot;Gotcha Covered&quot; their eighth studio album, a collection of 15 iconic Australian songs spanning from the mid 1960s to the 1990s.

In 2019, the band released a greatest hits album and national tour to celebrate 30 years as a band.

In August 2021, the band released a re-recorded &quot;All for One&quot;, celebrating its 30th anniversary. A national tour accompanied the album&#x27;s release beginning in July 2022 and concluding in October 2022.

===2023–present: &quot;Professional Misconduct&quot; and Paul Woseen&#x27;s death===
In July 2023, the band released &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot;, the lead single from their tenth studio album, &quot;Professional Misconduct&quot;.

<text>The Palermo Stone is one of seven surviving fragments of a stele known as the Royal Annals of the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. The stele contained a list of the kings of Egypt from the First Dynasty (c.3150–2890 BCE) through to the early part of the Fifth Dynasty (c.2392–2283 BCE) and noted significant events in each year of their reigns. It was probably made during the Fifth Dynasty. The Palermo Stone is held in the Regional Archeological Museum Antonio Salinas in the city of Palermo, Italy, from which it derives its name.

The term &quot;Palermo Stone&quot; is sometimes applied to all seven surviving fragments of the Royal Annals, including those held in museums in Cairo and London. The fragments are also sometimes described collectively as the &quot;Cairo Annals Stone&quot;, although the term &quot;Cairo Stone&quot; is also used to mean only those fragments of the Royal Annals now in Cairo.

The Palermo Stone and other fragments of the Royal Annals preserve what is probably the oldest historical text that has survived from Ancient Egypt and form a key source for Egyptian history in the Old Kingdom.

== Description ==
The Royal Annals stele, of which the Palermo Stone formed part, may originally have been about 60 cm high and 2.1m wide. The fragments are composed of a compact hard black stone, probably a form of basalt.

The Palermo Stone itself is an irregular shield-shaped fragment, 43.5 cm high, 25 cm wide and 6.5 cm thick (maximum dimensions).

The inscription on the &quot;front&quot; (recto) of the Palermo Stone consists of six horizontal bands or registers of hieroglyphic text running right to left. The first register lists the names of predynastic kings of Lower Egypt (identified as such by the wearing of the Red Crown). The second and subsequent registers contain portions of royal annals for pharaohs of the First to Fourth Dynasties, that is lists of the key events in each year of the reign of each king, arranged chronologically. The second register on the Palermo Stone begins with the final year entries for a king of the First Dynasty whose name is not preserved, but who is generally assumed to be either Narmer or Aha. The rest of the second register is taken up with the first nine annual entries for this king&#x27;s successor, who is again not named on the fragment, but is assumed to be either Aha or his successor Djer. The remainder of the inscription on this side continues with royal annals down to the kings of the Fourth Dynasty.

The text continues on the &quot;back&quot; (verso) of the Palermo Stone, cataloguing events during the reigns of pharaohs down to Neferirkare Kakai, third ruler of the Fifth Dynasty. From the surviving fragments, it is unclear whether the Royal Annals originally continued beyond this point in time. Where a king is named, the name of his mother is also recorded, such as Betrest mother of the First Dynasty king Semerkhet and Meresankh I mother of the Fourth Dynasty king Seneferu.

Information recorded in the Royal Annals (as preserved on the Palermo Stone) includes measurements of the height of the annual Nile flood (see Nilometer), the inundation, details of festivals (such as Sed festivals), taxation, sculpture, buildings, and warfare.

== Archaeological history ==
The original location of the stele is unknown and none of the surviving fragments have a secure archeological provenance. One fragment now in Cairo is said to have been found at an archaeological site at Memphis, while three other fragments now in Cairo were said to have been found in Middle Egypt. No find site for the Palermo Stone itself has been suggested.

The Palermo Stone was purchased by a Sicilian lawyer, Ferdinand Guidano, in 1859 and it has been in Palermo since 1866. On 19 October 1877, it was presented to the Palermo Archaeological Museum by the Guidano family, where it has remained since.

There are five fragments of the Royal Annals in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, four of which were acquired between 1895 and 1914. The fifth was purchased on the antiquities market in 1963. One small fragment is in the Petrie Museum of University College London, forming part of the collection of the archeologist Sir Flinders Petrie (and purchased by him in 1914).

The importance of the Palermo Stone was not recognized until it was noticed by a visiting French archaeologist in 1895. The first full publication and translation was that done in 1902 by Heinrich Schäfer.

== Uncertainties ==
There are uncertainties regarding the date of the Palermo Stone and of the Royal Annals it records. It is unknown whether the inscription was done all at once or whether it was added to over time. It is also unknown whether or not it dates from the latest period it describes (i.e. from no later than the Fifth Dynasty). It has been suggested that the stele was made much later, perhaps in the Twenty-fifth Dynasty (747–656 BCE). It seems clear from the content of the inscription that even if the Royal Annals, as preserved by the Palermo Stone and other fragments, were not carved during, or soon after, the period they describe, they are directly based on an Old Kingdom original. 

It is also unknown whether all the surviving fragments are parts of the same stele or whether they come from separate copies. None of the smaller fragments held in Cairo have any clear provenance, and they might not all be genuine.

Various parts of the ancient text are in widely varying states of preservation, which makes the text difficult to decipher. If the text is a later copy, rather than a Fifth Dynasty original, errors and invention may have crept in during the copying process.

== Significance ==
The Palermo Stone and the other associated fragments of the Royal Annals are a vital source for the history of the Old Kingdom and, for example, preserve names of members of the royal families during the first five dynasties, which are not otherwise recorded.

The surviving Royal Annals fragments contains the names of the following pharaohs:
* Hor-Aha (1st dynasty).
* Djer (1st dynasty).
* Den (1st dynasty).
* Semerkhet (1st dynasty).
* Nynetjer (2nd dynasty).
* Khasekhemwy (2nd dynasty).
* Huni (3rd dynasty).
* Sneferu (4th dynasty).
* Khufu (4th dynasty), builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza.
* Djedefre (4th dynasty), first pharaoh using the sun symbol in a royal cartouche.
* Shepseskaf (4th dynasty)
* Userkaf (5th dynasty), founder of the 5th dynasty.
* Sahure (5th dynasty)
* Neferirkare Kakai (5th dynasty)

New Kingdom Egyptian king lists, such as the Turin Canon (13th century BCE) and the Abydos king list (reign of Seti I, 1294–1279 BCE), identify Menes (probably Narmer) (c. 3100 or 3000 BCE) as the first king of the First Dynasty and so credit him with unifying Egypt. However, the top register of the &quot;Royal Annals&quot; names some predynastic rulers of Upper and Lower Egypt, presumably referring to a time before Egypt was unified. Identification of these kings with historical persons remains controversial.

The ancient historian Manetho may have used information similar to the complete Royal Annals stele to construct his chronology of the early dynasties of Egypt, forming part of his &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; (History of Egypt), written during the third century BCE, although the surviving king list most closely related to his work (as preserved by later ancient and later writers) is the Turin Canon.
The Palermo stone also mentions 9 predynastic pharaohs from Lower Egypt. These may be mythical kings preserved through oral tradition, or may even be completely fictitious.
* …pu 
* Hsekiu, alternatively Seka
* Khayu
* Tiu, also known as Teyew
* Thesh, also known as Tjesh and Tesh
* Neheb
* Wazner, also Wazenez, Wadjenedj and possibly Wenegbu
* Mekh
* …a

<text>Next Position Please is the seventh studio album by American rock band Cheap Trick, produced by Todd Rundgren and released in 1983.

The title track was originally demoed for the band&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Dream Police&quot;, which had lead singer Robin Zander, lead guitarist Rick Nielsen, and bassist Tom Petersson each singing a verse. The song did not go beyond a demo, but it was referenced in &quot;High Priest of Rhythmic Noise&quot;, a track from 1980&#x27;s &quot;All Shook Up&quot;. &quot;Position&quot; was eventually re-recorded for this album, and features only Zander singing.

Produced by Todd Rundgren, &quot;Next Position Please&quot; marks a return to the more pop-oriented sound of 1977&#x27;s &quot;In Color&quot;. The LP spent 22 weeks on the Billboard 200 LP charts and peaked at number 61.

The then-band member Bun E. Carlos considers it one of their best albums. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Take It&quot; has become a concert staple over the years. Several of the album&#x27;s tracks were re-worked versions of older material, such as the title track and &quot;You Talk Too Much.&quot;

Physical copies of the album were out of print for several years (except in Japan), but on April 6, 2010, it was reissued together with the previous album, &quot;One On One&quot;, on a single CD.

==Cover art==
The album cover is a parody of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s pose on the cover of &quot;Born to Run&quot;. The guitar on the cover is Rick Nielsen&#x27;s Hamer double-neck &quot;Uncle Dick&quot;. Rick Nielsen is pictured on the cover with eight fingers extended, plus a folded-in-half pinky. &quot;8 1/2&quot; was a potential title for the album, Cheap Trick having released seven full albums and a four-song EP prior to this release.

==Releases==
The original vinyl record included 12 tracks. &quot;You Talk Too Much&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Our Love a Crime&quot; appeared as bonus tracks on the cassette version and later on the CD. The record was originally supposed to include both of these tracks along with two others called &quot;Twisted Heart&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Hit Me With Love&quot;, but Cheap Trick&#x27;s label at the time, Epic Records, forced the band to include a cover of the Motors&#x27; &quot;Dancing the Night Away&quot; and the outtake &quot;You Say Jump&quot; in their place. Rundgren refused to produce &quot;Dancing the Night Away&quot;, so the track ended up being produced by the band with Ian Taylor, who had engineered the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;One on One&quot;. &quot;Twisted Heart&quot; eventually surfaced on the box set &quot;Sex, America, Cheap Trick&quot;. There was one video shot for this LP; &quot;I Can&#x27;t Take It&quot;.

In 2006, Cheap Trick and Epic/Legacy reissued &quot;Next Position Please&quot; as a digital download, calling it &quot;Next Position Please (The Authorized Version)&quot;. The title refers to the fact that the 13 tracks intended for the original album were restored and sequenced according to the band&#x27;s wishes, while &quot;You Say Jump&quot; and &quot;Dancing the Night Away&quot; were put at the end as &quot;bonus tracks&quot; along with the previously unreleased track &quot;Don&#x27;t Hit Me With Love&quot;. The track &quot;I Don&#x27;t Love Here Anymore&quot; is incorrectly titled &quot;I Don&#x27;t Love Her Anymore&quot;.

==Reception==

Upon release, &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote: &quot;This quartet sticks with what it does best: hard-edged but melodic guitar rock laced with echoes of the best &#x27;60s British and American bands.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; commented: &quot;Rundgren offers his nimble fingers to mold Cheap Trick into a viable pop force once again, and just judging from the first number, he&#x27;s succeeded admirably. Other cuts should receive an enthusiastic response from old and new fans.&quot;

J.D. Considine of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated: &quot;A better title for this one would have been &quot;Next Producer Please&quot;, because from the signature harmonies of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Take It&quot; to the predictable chorus of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Falling,&quot; it&#x27;s clear that this album belongs as much to producer Todd Rundgren as to the members of Cheap Trick. Throughout the album, every shred of melody is given the hard sell, so that when everything clicks, &quot;Next Position Please&quot; approximates the snap of the band&#x27;s overlooked classic, &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot;. But things really don&#x27;t click all that often, and a large part of the problem seems to be that Cheap Trick don&#x27;t really remember what they&#x27;re supposed to sound like.&quot;

In a retrospective review of the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented: &quot;Todd Rundgren wielded a heavy hand during his production, pushing Cheap Trick toward making a record that could easily be mistaken for a Utopia record. &quot;Next Position Please&quot; is still very much a new wave-era Cheap Trick album - this is shiny surfaces, not kicks to the gut - but it&#x27;s the best of the lot, and one of their best-ever albums.&quot;

<text>Eileen Gray (born Kathleen Eileen Moray Smith; 9 August 187831 October 1976) was an Irish interior designer, furniture designer and architect who became a pioneer of the Modern Movement in architecture. Over her career, she was associated with many notable European artists of her era, including Kathleen Scott, Adrienne Gorska, Le Corbusier, and the architect Jean Badovici, with whom she was romantically involved and who taught her architecture and collaborated with her on various buildings. Their most famous work is the house known as E-1027 in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France.

==Early life==
Gray was born Kathleen Eileen Moray Smith on 9 August 1878 at Brownswood, an estate near Enniscorthy in County Wexford in the south-east of Ireland. She was the youngest of five children.

Her father, James McLaren Smith, was a Scottish landscape painter. He encouraged Gray&#x27;s interest in painting and drawing. Although he was a minor figure, James corresponded with major artists of the day.

Her parents’ marriage ended in divorce when she was eleven and her father left Ireland to live and paint in Europe.

Gray&#x27;s mother, Eveleen Pounden, was a granddaughter of Francis Stuart, 10th Earl of Moray. She became the 19th Baroness Gray in 1895 after the death of her uncle. Although the couple was already separated by this point, Gray&#x27;s father changed his name to Smith-Gray by royal licence and the four children were from then on known as Gray.

Gray split her upbringing between Brownswood House in Ireland and the family&#x27;s home at No. 14 The Boltons, in Kensington, London. She was presented as a debutante at Buckingham Palace in 1898.

Both Gray&#x27;s brother and father died in 1900.

== Education ==
Gray briefly attended a school in Dresden, Germany but was mainly educated by governesses.

Gray&#x27;s serious art education began in 1900 at the Slade School in London. Gray was a registered fine arts student at the Slade from 1900 to 1902. Although fine arts education was typical for a young woman of Gray&#x27;s class, Slade was an unusual choice. Known as a bohemian school, the classes at Slade were generally co-educational which was usual for the time. Gray was one of 168 female students in a class of 228.

Gray had many influential teachers at the Slade, including Philip Wilson Steer, a Romantic landscape painter, Henry Tonks, a surgeon and figure painter, and Frederick Brown.

While at the Slade, Gray met furniture restorer Dean Charles in 1901. Charles was Gray&#x27;s first introduction to lacquering and she took lessons in the technique from his company in Soho. Further on in her carer, she created the Brick Screen which used the Japanese Lacquer techniques she learnt at the Slade School of Art

In 1902, Gray moved to Paris with Kathleen Bruce and Jessie Gavin. They enrolled at the Académie Colarossi, an art school popular with foreign students, but soon switched to the Académie Julian.

In 1905, Gray returned to London to be with her ill mother. For the next two years, she studied lacquering with Dean Charles before returning to Paris. When she returned to Paris, Gray purchased a flat in the rue Bonaparte, and began training with Seizo Sugawara. Sugawara was from Jahoji, a village in northern Japan famous for its lacquer work, and he was in Paris to restore the lacquer pieces Japan had sent to the Exposition Universale. Gray was so dedicated to learning the trade that she suffered the so-called lacquer disease, a painful rash on her hands, but that did not stop her from working.

In 1910, Gray opened a lacquer workshop with Sugawara. By 1912, she was producing pieces to commission for some of Paris&#x27;s richest clients.

Gray served as an ambulance driver at the beginning of World War I before returning to England to wait out the war with Sugawara.

== Interior design ==
After the war Gray and Sugawara returned to Paris. In 1917, Gray was hired to redesign the Rue de Lota apartment of society hostess Juliette Lévy. Also known as Madame Mathieu Levy, Juliette owned the fashion house and millinery shop. 
The Rue de Lota apartment has been called &quot;the epitome of Art Deco.&quot; A 1920 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; describes the Rue de Lota apartment as ‘thoroughly modern although there is much feeling for the antique’. The furniture included some of Gray&#x27;s best known designs – the Bibendum Chair and the Pirogue Day Bed. The Bibendum chair was a take on the Michelin Man with tire like shapes sitting on a chromed steel frame. The chair&#x27;s shape is reminiscent of the voluptuous figures of women in renaissance paintings, while the geometry calls back to the ideals of Werkbund. The Pirogue Day Bed was gondola-shaped and finished in patinated bronze lacquer, and is inspired by Polynesian dugout canoes. This &quot;boat-bed&quot; may also have been influenced by the Irish currach.
The critical and financial success of the project prompted Gray to open her own shop in 1922. Jean Désert was located on the fashionable Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris. The shop was named after an imaginary male owner “Jean” and Gray&#x27;s love of the North African desert. Gray designed the facade of the shop herself. Jean Désert sold the abstract geometric rugs designed by Gray and woven in Evelyn Wyld&#x27;s workshops. Clients included James Joyce, Ezra Pound and Elsa Schiaparelli.

Early on Gray used luxurious materials like exotic woods, ivory and furs. In the mid-1920s, her pieces became simpler and more industrial. This reflects her growing interest in the work of Le Corbusier and other Modernists, who valued utility and mathematical principles over ornamentation.

Jean Désert closed due to financial losses in 1930.

== Architecture ==

By 1921, Gray was romantically involved with Romanian architect and writer Jean Badovici who was 15 years her junior. He encouraged her growing interest in architecture. From 1922/1923 to 1926 Gray created an informal architectural apprenticeship for herself as she never received any formal training as an architect. She studied theoretical and technical books, took drafting lessons, and arranged to have Adrienne Gorska take her along to building sites. She also traveled with Badovici to study key buildings and learned by reworking architectural designs.

In 1926, she started work on a new holiday home near Monaco to share with Badovici. Because a foreigner in France couldn&#x27;t wholly own property, Gray bought the land and put it in Badovici&#x27;s name, making him her client on paper. Construction of the house took three years and Gray remained on site while Badovici visited occasionally.

The house was given the enigmatic name of E-1027. It was code for the lovers&#x27; names; the E standing for Eileen, the 10 for J, meaning Jean, the 2 for B standing for Badovici and the 7 for G standing for Gray. E-1027 is routinely described as a masterpiece.

E-1027 is a white cuboid built on rocky land on raised on pillars. According to Frances Stonor Saunders, E-1027 was formulated on Le Corbusier&#x27;s &quot;Five Points of the New Architecture&quot; because it is an open plan house which stands on pillars with horizontal windows, an open facade and a roof accessible by staircase. However, Gray was critical of the avant-garde movement&#x27;s focus on the exterior of buildings, writing &quot;The interior plan should not be the incidental result of the facade; it should lead to a complete harmonious, and logical life.&quot; According to architecture critic Rowan Moore, E-1027 &quot;grows from furniture into a building.&quot; By this point, Gray was fascinated by lightweight, functional, multi-purpose furniture which she called &quot;camping style&quot;. She created a tea trolley with a cork surface, to reduce the rattling of cups, and positioned mirrors so a visitor could see the back of their head. At the entrance of E-1027 Gray created a celluloid niche for hats with net shelves to allow a clear view without the risk of dust settling.

When E-1027 was finished, Badovici devoted an edition of his magazine to it and announced himself as its joint architect. This claim is disputed by Jennifer Goff, a curator at the National Museum of Ireland. According to Goff&#x27;s research all extant plans of the house were in Gray&#x27;s hand alone and “Badovici’s role was firstly client and secondly consultant architect.” In her six-year collaboration with Badovici, Gray was able to create 9 buildings and renovations, 4 of which were credited to Badovici.

Gray and Badovici broke up and in 1931 Gray started work on a new house, Tempe à Pailla, above the nearby town of Menton. The name Tempe à Pailla is translated into English as &quot;Time and Hay&quot; and references a Provençal proverb that say both are needed for figs to ripen. It was a small two bedroom house with a large terrace. Much of the furniture was transformable, including expandable wardrobes and a dining banquette that both folded for storage and could be turned into an occasional table. With Tempe à Pailla, Gray moved away from Le Corbusier&#x27;s free plan ideal and created more separate spaces while maximizing the house&#x27;s panoramic views. Gray&#x27;s design also maximized airflow and natural light with features such as shuttered windows and skylights. Gray&#x27;s multi-level kitchen was influenced by Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky&#x27;s Frankfurt Kitchen.

Le Corbusier often stayed at E-1027 as a guest of Badovici, who owned it, and in 1938/1939 he painted murals there. Gray had expressed a wish that E-1027 be free of any decoration. His drawing &quot;Three Women&quot; might depict Eileen and Jean together. Beatriz Colomina, in her seminal article &quot;War On Architecture: E.1027&quot;, makes the assertion that, as the archetypical colonist, Le Corbusier didn&#x27;t think of it as &quot;an invasion, but as a gift [...the type of gift that] can not be returned&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;The Observer&quot; critic Rowan Moore called it an “act of naked phallocracy” by a man asserting “his dominion, like a urinating dog, over the territory”, the nature of this &quot;spasm of comic brutality&quot; being &quot;hotly debated&quot; as &quot;an act of vandalism... infringement of the original architect&#x27;s intellectual property... a bravura improvement&quot; or &quot;just plain snobbery and sexism&quot;. One of the murals, titled &quot;Three Women&quot;, might be Le Corbusier&#x27;s response to Gray&#x27;s use of desire and femininity in her work. The content of the painting (three feminine figures intertwined) could be a reference to Gray&#x27;s bisexuality.

Other owners of E-1027 included Marie-Louise Schelbert, a friend of Corbusier&#x27;s, and Heinz Peter Kägi. Architect Renaud Barrés is the current owner.

E-1027 was also the setting for many tragedies. In 1965, Le Corbusier died of a heart attack shortly after swimming at the beach located nearby. In 1996, Heinz Peter Kägi, Marie-Louise Schelbert&#x27;s gynecologist, was stabbed to death during an altercation with two men in the living room.

== World War I ==
In 1919 the 10th Salon des Artistes Decorateurs featured inexpensive postwar furniture. The goal of the Salon des Artistes was to reconstruct Paris and erase the scars of the war left on the country. In its efforts, multiple artists sought to reestablish that Paris was still the &quot;intellectual capital of the world&quot;. During this post-war reconstruction the push for modernization was ever-more evident. This exhibition was made in an attempt to endorse new arts of the French renaissance, stepping up to German designers. Gray participated in the exhibition, however her works were not recorded. In 1920 &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, an article dedicated to keeping record of Gray&#x27;s lacquer work stated &quot;Laquer Walls and Furniture Displace Old Gods in Paris and London.&quot;

== World War II ==
During World War II, Gray was interned as a foreign national, and her houses were looted. Many of her drawings, models, architectural notes, and personal papers were destroyed by bombing. German soldiers used the walls of E-1027 for target practice.

== Later life ==
Renewed interest in Gray&#x27;s work began in 1967 when historian Joseph Rykwert published an essay about her in the Italian design magazine &quot;Domus&quot;. After the publishing of the article many &quot;students began to ring at her door&quot; as eager to learn from the now famous designer.

At a Paris auction of 1972, Yves Saint Laurent bought &quot;Le Destin&quot; and revived interest in Gray&#x27;s career.

The first retrospective exhibition of her work, titled &quot;Eileen Gray: Pioneer of Design&quot;, was held in London in 1972. A Dublin exhibition followed the next year. At the Dublin exhibit, the 95 year-old Gray was given an honorary fellowship by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.

In 1973 Gray signed a contract to reproduce the Bibendum chair and many of her pieces for the first time, with Aram Designs Ltd, London. They remain in production.

Eileen Gray died on Halloween 1976. She is buried in the Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris, but because her family omitted to pay the licence fee her grave is not identifiable.

==Personal life==
Gray was bisexual. She mixed in the lesbian circles of the time, being associated with Romaine Brooks, Loie Fuller, Marie-Louise Damien (a singer with the stage name &quot;Damia&quot;), and Natalie Barney.

Gray&#x27;s intermittent relationship with Marie-Louise Damien ended in 1938, after which they never saw each other again, although both lived into their nineties in the same city.

Gray also had for some time an intermittent relationship with Jean Badovici, the Romanian architect and writer. He had written about her design work in 1924 and encouraged her interest in architecture. Their romantic involvement ended in 1932.

Having never lived in Ireland during her adult life, in her old age she reportedly stated, &quot;I am without roots, but if I have any, they are in Ireland&quot;.

==Posthumous==

Gray&#x27;s achievements were restricted during her lifetime. According to Reyner Banham, &quot;[Eileen Gray&#x27;s work] was, also, in its day, part of a personal style and philosophy of design which was, by the look of things, too rich for the punditry to take. And if the punditry didn&#x27;t publish you, particularly in the great canon-defining compendia of the thirties, forties and fifties you dropped off the record, and ceased to be a part of the universe of scholarly discourse.&quot;

The National Museum of Ireland has a permanent exhibition of her work in the Collins Barracks site.

In February 2009, Gray&#x27;s &quot;Dragons&quot; armchair made by her between 1917 and 1919 (acquired by her early patron Suzanne Talbot and later part of the Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé collection) was sold at auction in Paris for €21.9 million (US$28.3 million), setting an auction record for 20th-century decorative art.

Marco Orsini&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Gray Matters&quot;, was released in 2014. A biopic on Gray&#x27;s life by Mary McGuckian, &quot;The Price of Desire&quot; opened in 2016. A 2020 short film by Michel Pitiot, &quot;In Conversation with Eileen Gray&quot;, was based on an unreleased 1973 interview with Andrew Hodgkinson. In 2024 a Swiss documentary by Beatrice Minger and Christoph Schaub with the title &quot;Eileen Gray and the House by the Sea&quot; was screened at the Zurich Film Festival.

<text>Powertrip is the fourth studio album by American rock band Monster Magnet, released on June 16, 1998. The album was the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough, achieving mainstream success due largely to the hit single &quot;Space Lord&quot;. Other hit songs on the album include &quot;Powertrip&quot;, &quot;Temple of Your Dreams&quot;, and &quot;See You in Hell&quot;. The album reached #1 on the Heatseekers Charts, #21 in the German Charts, #65 in the UK Charts, and #97 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on January 25, 1999. Music videos were made for the songs &quot;Space Lord&quot;, &quot;Powertrip&quot;, and &quot;See You in Hell&quot;.

==Recording==
After the Dopes to Infinity tour, Dave Wyndorf flew to Las Vegas to work on the group&#x27;s next album. He got a hotel room outside the city, where he would write one song a day for twenty-one days. Most of the songs were based on the themes of Las Vegas, such as naked women and people losing their money. The song &quot;Tractor&quot; is a re-recorded version of the song originally released on the band&#x27;s 1990 EP &quot;Monster Magnet&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Powertrip&quot; is featured in the film &quot;Soldier&quot;, starring Kurt Russell, and was the official theme song for the WWE pay-per-view event No Way Out (2007).

<doc id="609904" wikidata="Q622770" url="?curid=609904" title="Turin King List">
<text>The Turin King List, also known as the Turin Royal Canon, is an ancient Egyptian hieratic papyrus thought to date from the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II, now in the Museo Egizio (Egyptian Museum) in Turin. The papyrus is the most extensive list available of kings compiled by the ancient Egyptians, and is the basis for most chronology before the reign of Ramesses II.

==Creation and use==
The papyrus is believed to date from the reign of Ramesses II, during the middle of the New Kingdom, or the 19th Dynasty. The beginning and ending of the list are now lost; there is no introduction, and the list does not continue after the 19th Dynasty. The composition may thus have occurred at any subsequent time, from the reign of Ramesses II to as late as the 20th Dynasty.
The papyrus lists the names of rulers, the lengths of reigns in years, with months and days for some kings. In some cases they are grouped together by family, which corresponds approximately to the dynasties of Manetho&#x27;s book. The list includes the names of ephemeral rulers or those ruling small territories that may be unmentioned in other sources.

The list also is believed to contain kings from the 15th Dynasty, the Hyksos who ruled Lower Egypt and the River Nile delta. The Hyksos rulers do not have cartouches (enclosing borders which indicate the name of a king), and a hieroglyphic sign is added to indicate that they were foreigners, although typically on King Lists foreign rulers are not listed.

The papyrus was originally a tax roll, but on its back is written a list of rulers of Egypt – including mythical kings such as gods, demi-gods, and spirits, as well as human kings. That the back of an older papyrus was used may indicate that the list was not of great formal importance to the writer, although the primary function of the list is thought to have been as an administrative aid. As such, the papyrus is less likely to be biased against certain rulers and is believed to include all the kings of Egypt known to its writers up to the 19th or 20th Dynasty.

==Discovery and reconstruction==
The papyrus was found by the Italian traveler Bernardino Drovetti in 1820 in Luxor (Thebes), Egypt and was acquired in 1824 by the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy and was designated Papyrus Number 1874. When the box in which it had been transported to Italy was unpacked, the list had disintegrated into small fragments. Jean-Francois Champollion, examining it, could recognize only some of the larger fragments containing royal names, and produced a drawing of what he could decipher. A reconstruction of the list was created to better understand it and to aid in research.

The Saxon researcher Gustav Seyffarth re-examined the fragments, some only one square centimeter in size, and made a more complete reconstruction of the papyrus based only on the papyrus fibers, as he could not yet determine the meaning of the hieratic characters. Subsequent work on the fragments was done by the Munich Egyptologist Jens Peter Lauth, which largely confirmed the Seyffarth reconstruction.

In 1997, prominent Egyptologist Kim Ryholt published a new and better interpretation of the list in his book, &quot;The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c. 1800–1550 B.C.&quot; After another study of the papyrus, an updated version from Ryholt is expected. Egyptologist Donald Redford has also studied the papyrus and has noted that although many of the list&#x27;s names correspond to monuments and other documents, there are some discrepancies and not all of the names correspond, questioning the absolute reliability of the document for pre-Ramesses II chronology.

Despite attempts at reconstruction, approximately 50% of the papyrus remains missing. This papyrus as presently constituted is 1.7 m long and 0.41 m wide, broken into over 160 fragments. In 2009, previously unpublished fragments were discovered in the storage room of the Egyptian Museum of Turin, in good condition. A new edition of the papyrus is expected.

The name Hudjefa, found twice in the papyrus, is now known to have been used by the royal scribes of the Ramesside era during the 19th Dynasty, when the scribes compiled king lists such as the Saqqara King List and the royal canon of Turin and the name of a deceased pharaoh was unreadable, damaged, or completely erased.

==Contents of the papyrus==
The papyrus is divided into eleven columns, distributed as follows. The names and positions of several kings are still being disputed, since the list is so badly damaged.

*Column 1 – Gods of Ancient Egypt
*Column 2 – Gods of Ancient Egypt, spirits and mythical kings
*Column 3 – Rows 1–10 (Spirits and mythical kings), Rows 11–25 (Dynasties 1–2)
*Column 4 – Rows 1–25 (Dynasties 2–5)
*Column 5 – Rows 1–26 (Dynasties 6–8/9/10)
*Column 6 – Rows 12–25 (Dynasties 11–12)
*Column 7 – Rows 1–2 (Dynasties 12–13)
*Column 8 – Rows 1–23 (Dynasty 13)
*Column 9 – Rows 1–27 (Dynasty 13–14)
*Column 10 – Rows 1–30 (Dynasty 14)
*Column 11 – Rows 1–30 (Dynasties 14–17)

It&#x27;s possible that a twelfth column once existed that contained Dynasties 18–19/20, but that section has since been lost.

These are the actual names written on the papyrus, omitting the years, summations and headings:

*The Manuel de Codage text was written using the Open Source hieroglyphic editor JSesh.

<text>J.-H. Rosny was the pen name of Joseph Henri Honoré Boex (17 February 1856 – 11 February 1940), a Belgian author considered one of the founding figures of modern science fiction.

Born in Brussels in 1856, he wrote in French in collaboration with his younger brother, Séraphin Justin François Boex, under the joint pen name J.-H. Rosny until 1909. After they ended their collaboration, Joseph Boex continued to write under the name Rosny aîné (&quot;Rosny the Elder&quot;) while his brother used J.-H. Rosny jeune (&quot;Rosny the Younger&quot;). 

==Overview==
Rosny aîné was very much like H. G. Wells or Olaf Stapledon in his concepts and his way of dealing with them in his novels. He was the second most important figure after Jules Verne in the history of modern Belgian science fiction.

Because his writing was not translated into English before his death, and his readers did not always understand his science fiction novels, his impact on the early evolution of the genre was limited.

Rosny&#x27;s first science fiction tale was the short story &quot;Les Xipéhuz [The Shapes]&quot; (1887). In the story, which takes place a thousand years before Babylonian times, primitive humans encounter inorganic aliens, with whom all forms of communication prove impossible. Men eventually drive away the invaders, but the hero mourns the loss of another life. This was the first time that science fiction abandoned its usual anthropomorphic approach in the description of alien life.

The story &quot;Un Autre Monde&quot; [&quot;Another World&quot;] (1895) establishes that humans share the Earth with the land-bound Moedigen (Dutch for &#x27;brave ones&#x27;) and the air-borne Vuren (&#x27;fires&#x27;), two infinitely flat and invisible species who cohabit with us. Only a mutant whose vision is superior to that of ordinary men can see them. In &quot;Le Cataclysme&quot; [The Cataclysm] (1896), an entire region of France sees the physical laws of nature change, as a result of the arrival of a mysterious electro-magnetic entity from outer space.

Rosny&#x27;s short novel, &quot;La Mort de la Terre&quot; [&quot;The Death of the Earth&quot;] (1910), takes place in the distant future, when the Earth has all but dried out. The last descendants of mankind become aware of the emergence of a new species, the metal-based &quot;Ferromagnetals&quot;, fated to replace them.

Another novel, &quot;La Force Mystérieuse&quot; [&quot;The Mysterious Force&quot;] (1913), tells of the destruction of a portion of the light spectrum by a mysterious force—possibly aliens from outer space who, for a brief while, share our physical existence. This causes an initial panic, followed by a progressive and potentially deadly cooling of the world.

&quot;L&#x27;Énigme de Givreuse&quot; [&quot;The Enigma of Givreuse&quot;] (1917) is another novel about a fissiparous human being, divided into two totally similar individuals, each naturally believing himself to be the original.

The novella &quot;La Jeune Vampire&quot; [&quot;The Young Vampire&quot;] (1920) was the first time that vampirism was described as a genetic mutation, transmissible by birth.

&quot;L&#x27;Étonnant Voyage d&#x27;Hareton Ironcastle&quot; [&quot;The Amazing Journey of Hareton Ironcastle&quot;] (1922) is a more traditional adventure novel; in it, explorers eventually discover a fragment of an alien world, with its fauna and flora, attached to Earth. The novel was adapted and retold by Philip José Farmer.

Rosny&#x27;s masterpiece is &quot;Les Navigateurs de l&#x27;Infini&quot; [&quot;The Navigators of Infinity&quot;] (1925) in which the word astronaut, &quot;astronautique&quot;, was coined for the first time . In the story, Rosny&#x27;s heroes travel to Mars in the &quot;Stellarium&quot;, a spaceship powered by artificial gravity and made of &quot;argine&quot;, an indestructible, transparent material. On Mars, the human explorers come in contact with the gentle, peaceful, six-eyed, three-legged &quot;Tripèdes&quot;, a dying race who is slowly being replaced by the &quot;Zoomorphs&quot;, alien entities who bear some resemblance to the &quot;Ferromagnetals&quot; of &quot;La Mort de la Terre&quot;. Later, a young Martian female, capable of bearing children parthenogenetically by merely wishing it, gives birth to a child after falling in love with one of the human explorers. This heralds the rebirth of the Martian race and, with Man&#x27;s help, the eventual reconquering of their planet.

Rosny also penned five prehistoric novels: &quot;Vamireh&quot; (1892), &quot;Eyrimah&quot; (1893), the world-renowned classic &quot;La Guerre du Feu&quot; better known as &quot;The Quest for Fire&quot; (1911) which served as the basis for the 1981 film; &quot;Le Félin Géant&quot; [&quot;The Giant Cat&quot;] (1918) (sometimes known as &quot;Quest of the Dawn Man&quot;) and &quot;Helgvor du Fleuve Bleu&quot; [&quot;Helgvor of the Blue River&quot;] (1930). The narrative is a combination of various of modern drama with the ability to depict Man&#x27;s early days.

In 1897, Joseph Boex was awarded the French Légion d&#x27;honneur and in 1903 was named to the first jury of the Prix Goncourt along with his younger brother. Boex remained involved with the Académie Goncourt and in 1926 became its president. Romain Rolland nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1928 and 1933. Joseph Boex died in Paris in 1940.

=== Personal life ===
Boex married Gertrude Emma Holmes when she was 16 and he was 24 in London on 22 November 1880. They had 4 children together.

<text>In architecture, a machicolation () is an opening between the supporting corbels of a battlement through which defenders could target attackers who had reached the base of the defensive wall. A smaller related structure that only protects key points of a fortification are referred to as Bretèche. Machicolation, hoarding, bretèche, and murder holes are all similar defensive features serving the same purpose, that is to enable defenders atop a defensive structure to target attackers below. The primary benefit of the design allowed defenders to remain behind cover rather than being exposed when leaning over the parapet. They were common in defensive fortifications until the widespread adoption of gunpowder weapons made them obsolete.

==Etymology==
The word machicolation derives from Old French , mentioned in Medieval Latin as &quot;&quot;, probably from Old French &#x27;crush&#x27;, &#x27;wound&#x27; and &#x27;neck&#x27;. The verb &quot;Machicolate&quot; is first recorded in English in the 18th century, but &quot;machicollāre&quot; is attested in Anglo-Latin. 

==Origins and Regional Prevalence==
The oldest known buildings with machicolation are Ancient Roman fortifications of the Limes Arabicus dating from the 4th century AD. The design was brought to Europe from the Levant following the crusades and became especially prevalent in Southern Europe.

Machicolations were more common in French castles than English, where they are usually restricted to the gateway, as in the 13th-century Conwy Castle. Within France, machicolation is more common on southern castles. One of the oldest extant examples of machicolation in northern France is at Château de Farcheville which was built from 1290 to 1304.

<text>J.-H. Rosny was the pseudonym of Séraphin Justin François Boex (July 21, 1859 – July 21, 1948), a French author of Belgian origin who, along with his better known older brother J.-H. Rosny aîné, is considered one of the founding figures of modern science fiction. Born in Brussels in 1859, until 1909 he wrote together with his older brother Joseph Henri Honoré Boex under the pen name J.-H. Rosny. After they ended their collaboration Joseph Boex continued to write under the name J.-H. Rosny aîné (&quot;Rosny Senior&quot;) while Séraphin used &quot;Rosny jeune&quot; (&quot;Rosny Junior&quot;).

In 1903, Séraphin Boex was named to the first jury of the Prix Goncourt along with his brother. He died in 1948 in Ploubazlanec, Côtes-du-Nord, France.

<doc id="609940" wikidata="Q3002736" url="?curid=609940" title="Conscription crisis">
<text>A conscription crisis is a public dispute about a policy of conscription, or mandatory service in the military, known in US English as a &quot;draft&quot;. A dispute can become a crisis when submission to military service becomes highly controversial and popular revolt ensues. From the point of view of military officials, the crisis is one of supply; where they may claim to lack enough troops to accomplish a military objective, and have, to some degree, lost control of their political ability to enforce existing conscription law.

When conscripted soldiers are sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, or under pretexts and contexts that are otherwise controversial, conscription has historically been highly politically contentious within democracies.

==List==
There were a number of conscription crises in history.

* The War in the Vendée involved an early case of a conscription crisis in 1793 as the revolutionary government sought to conscript portions of local communities for the Revolutionary Wars. Similar events occurred in Brittany.
* The New York Draft Riots of 1863 represented protests in response to President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Enrollment Act of Conscription to draft men to fight in the ongoing Civil War.
* The Tragic Week of 1909 was a series of confrontations between the Spanish army and the working classes of in the Spanish region of Catalonia, caused by the calling-up of reserve troops to be sent as reinforcements to the Second Rif War in Morocco.
* The Conscription Crisis of 1917 was a political and military crisis in Canada during World War I.
* In the Conscription Crisis of 1918, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland government legislated for power to extend conscription to Ireland, leading to increased support for Irish nationalism. No steps were ever taken to exercise the power to conscript in Ireland.
* Other conscription crises during World War I happened in Newfoundland, Australia and New Zealand.
* The Conscription Crisis of 1944 was a political and military crisis in Canada during World War II.
* Protests against the Vietnam War in the late 1960s and early 1970s to a large degree dealt with the issue of conscription, particularly in the United States and Australia which conscripted troops for the war (other countries, like New Zealand, did not send conscripts). Decades later, the then-popular book &quot;IV-F&quot; that centered on easily faked ways to be held medically unqualified for military service without any real incapacitation remains in college libraries as a reminder of how systemic resistance to the draft then was. It ended in 1972, when President Nixon ended conscription and pardoned contentious objectors as a response to the crisis.
* The insubordinate movement in Spain. Since the Spanish Civil War, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses refused to be drafted, facing death penalty in 1937. The first non-religious conscientious objector was imprisoned in 1971, starting mass civil disobedience which peaked in the mid-1980s and 1990s with hundreds of objectors jailed, until conscription was ruled out in 2001.
*The Ukrainian conscription crisis during the Russian invasion of Ukraine

<text>Sree Padmanabhadasa Sree Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma , popularly known as Sree Chithira Thirunal (7 November 1912 – 20 July 1991), was the last ruling Maharaja of the Indian princely state of Travancore, in southern India until 1949 and later the Titular Maharajah of Travancore until 1991. His reign is known for several notable reforms that have indelible impact on the society and culture of Kerala.

Sree Chithira Thirunal was the eldest son of Junior Maharani of Travancore, Sethu Parvathi Bayi, and Sri Pooram Nal Ravi Varma Koyi Thampuran of the Royal House of Kilimanoor. He was privately educated, and became the Maharajah of Travancore, at the age of 11, upon the death of his maternal great uncle, the then Maharajah of Travancore Sree Moolam Thirunal, on 7 August 1924. For the duration of his reign he was either under a regency or effectively controlled by his autocratic Dewan, Sir C.P. Ramaswami Iyer.

Upon India&#x27;s independence from the British on 15 August 1947, Sree Chithira Thirunal initially chose to keep his domain an independent country. As this was unacceptable to the Government Of India, several rounds of negotiations were held between the Maharaja and the Indian representatives. Finally an agreement was reached in 1949 and Sree Chithira Thirunal agreed to merge Travancore officially as a part of the Union of India.

In 1949, Travancore was united with Cochin, and Sree Chithira Thirunal served as the first and only &quot;Rajpramukh&quot; (Governor equivalent) of the Travancore-Cochin Union from 1 July 1949 until 31 October 1956. On 1 November 1956, the state of Kerala was created by uniting the Malayalam-speaking areas of the Travancore-Cochin Union with Malabar, and Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s office of &quot;Rajpramukh&quot; came to an end.

Sree Chithira Thirunal was an Hon. Major General with the British Indian Army and the Colonel-in-Chief and the Supreme Commander of the Travancore Military and of the Travancore-Cochin State Forces, for the period 1924–56. He became an Hon. Colonel in the Indian Army since 1949, as the Travancore Military was integrated by him into the former, as the 9th (1st Travancore) and the 16th Battalion of the Madras Regiment (2nd Travancore).

After the Constitutional Amendment of 1971, he was stripped of his political powers and emoluments from the privy purse by the Indira Gandhi government. At the age of 78, following a stroke, he fell into a coma for nine days and died on 20 July 1991. Along with the Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology, many other charitable trusts were established using the funds, land and buildings provided by him.

Sree Chithira Thirunal also sponsored the higher education of a young K. R. Narayanan who went on to become the 10th President of India.

==Early years==

Sree Chithira Thirunal was the eldest son of Sethu Parvathi Bayi, popularly known as &quot;Amma Maharani&quot;, the Queen Mother and Junior Maharani of Travancore, by her consort, Ravi Varma Kochu Koyi Thampuran of Royal House of Kilimanoor, a Sanskrit scholar and the great-nephew of the celebrated painter Raja Ravi Varma. He was born on Deepavali on his mother&#x27;s sixteenth birthday, on 7 November 1912, as the &quot;Heir Apparent&quot; to the throne of Travancore. His siblings were Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi and Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma. Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s mother, Sethu Parvathi Bayi, was distantly related, by birth, to the royal house of Travancore in the direct female line. In 1900, following the absence of heirs in the Travancore royal family, she had been adopted by her maternal great-aunt. According to the matrilineal traditions of the Travancore royal family, Sree Chithira Thirunal, at the time of his birth, was proclaimed the Heir Apparent of Travancore with the title of : &quot;Sree Padmanabhadasa Maharajkumar Sree Balarama Varma II, Elaya Rajah (Crown Prince) of Travancore&quot;.

===Education===
At the age of 6, Sree Chithira Thirunal began his education under tutors specially chosen by his uncle, Maharajah Sree Moolam Thirunal, in subjects like Malayalam, Sanskrit, Tamil, English, Mathematics, History, Geography, General Literature, Art and Culture. His early education in Malayalam and Sanskrit was imparted by the eminent scholar of the time, Sri Attoor Krishna Pisharody and in English by Mr. Dowel I.C.S (Indian Civil Service) and T. Raman Nambeeshan. Later he had his higher education under Captain G.T.B. Harvey, and Mr Dutt I.C.S (Indian Civil Service).

At the age of 16, he began his training in State Craft and Administration, for two years, in Bangalore. Sree Chithira Thirunal lived in Bangalore until 1 July 1931, and acquired knowledge in practical administration for 15 months, under the guidance of Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, the Maharajah of Mysore. The head tutor of Sree Chithira Thirunal, Captain. Harvey, quoted in his report to the Travancore government that : &quot;His Highness is an intelligent and willing pupil and his educational progress has been quite satisfactory. His mental equipment and the present standard of his knowledge in English, Malayalam and other subjects like Mathematics, History and Geography are higher than those laid down by the Committee ruling &#x27;Minor Ruler&#x27;s Education and Training in Administration&#x27;. His Highness continued to make very satisfactory progress in his studies and that mental progress and expansion of personality have been marked and rapid. The establishment of a separate household, has resulted in much greater self-reliance, initiative and power of decision. Opportunities for studying the laws and institutions of a progressive State have greatly broadened His Highness&#x27; experience and enlarged His Highness&#x27; sympathies and interests&quot;. By the time he reached the majority age of eighteen, Sree Chithira Thirunal, had finished his administrative training in Mysore and returned to Travancore.

==Maharajah of Travancore==

Even after turning eighteen, Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s investiture ceremony wasn&#x27;t done and his accession to full power looked unlikely, as rumours were spread about him that he was not mentally stable and hence not qualified to occupy the throne. His mother, Maharani Sethu Parvathi Bayi, contacted Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyar, a family friend, who then presented Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s case to the then Viceroy of India, Lord Wellington, and arranged a meeting between the two. After meeting the young monarch, the Viceroy was highly impressed and found the rumours baseless, and thus all the obstacles, in Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s accession to power, were removed. As Sree Chithira Thirunal was quite young, and because of the amount of controversy that had been swirling around him, Viceroy Lord Wellington insisted that Sir C.P. must become the Legal and Constitutional Adviser to the young monarch. Sree Chithira Thirunal attained full ruling powers on 6 November 1931, with the title : &quot;Major General His Highness Sree Padmanabhadasa Vanchipala Sree Chithira Thirunal Sir Balarama Varma II, Manney Sultan Maharajah Raja Ramaraja Bahadur, Shamsher Jang, Maharajah of Travancore, Knight Grand Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, Knight Grand Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire&quot;. As was customary, he took the regnal name &quot;Sree Chithira Thirunal&quot; as he was born under the &quot;Chithira nakshatram&quot; or star. ln his speech, after assuming full power as the &quot;Maharajah of Travancore&quot;, he declared: &quot;It is my hope that I shall be enabled by God&#x27;s grace to earn the affection and esteem of all communities and classes amongst my people whose advancement in every department of life will be my perpetual pre-occupation and my sole aim.&quot;

All Travancore Maharajahs including Sree Moolam Thirunal conducted &quot;Hiranyagarbham&quot; ceremony. Sree Chithira Thirunal is the only Maharajah of Travancore not to have conducted &quot;Hiranyagarbham&quot; or &quot;Tulaapurushadaanam&quot; as he considered these as extremely costly ceremonies thereby making himself a Nair and not a Samantha Kshatriya.

Sree Chithira Thirunal was able to secure the services of eminent statesman, Sir C.P.Ramaswami Aiyar, who initially served as his Legal and Constitutional Adviser and later as his Prime minister, for several years. Sree Chithira Thirunal went abroad, on a foreign tour, commencing on 8 April 1933 and visited England, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy etc. He had met with King George V in London and Pope Pius XI at the Vatican. Sree Chithira Thirunal also had a beautiful palace built for him named &quot;Kowdiar Palace&quot;, finished in 1934 prior to the wedding of his sister Maharani Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi to Lt. Col. G. V. Raja. It was previously an old &quot;Nalukettu&quot;, given by Maharajah Sree Moolam Thirunal to Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s mother, Sethu Parvathi Bayi, in 1915.

===Bicameral assembly===
In 1932, Sree Chithira Thirunal conducted a Constitutional Reform by forming the first Bicameral Legislature there by reducing some of his political powers. The Legislative Council of Travancore and Sree Moolam Popular Assembly were replaced with a formal bicameral system consisting of an Upper House—&quot;the Travancore Sree Chitra State Council&quot;, and a Lower House—&quot;the Sree Moolam Assembly&quot;. It was specified that no fewer than 55% of the members should be elected and no more than one third should be officials. In the case of the Assembly, not less than 48 members were required to be elected. Of not more than 24 nominated members, 12 should be officials. The Assembly had 72 members while the &quot;Sri Chitra State Council&quot; had 37 members. This bicameral system continued to function till September 1947, until it gave way to a constituent assembly that later led to the merger of Cochin state and the eventual joining into the Indian Union. The new bodies started functioning from 1 January 1933. The Assembly could vote on the budgetary demands for grants with powers to reduce and omit items. For the first time, a Public Accounts Committee was created making the executive increasingly accountable to the legislature. The Prime Minister (Dewan) was the President of both the Houses. The Assembly elected its own Deputy President and the term was four years.

But Ezhavas, Christians and Muslims feared the new reforms would secure for them only a few number of seats in the enlarged legislature than the Nairs. They demanded dividing the seats on the basis of population and they decided to abstain from voting and thus Abstention movement began in Travancore. The government finally acceded to protesters demand and introduced Communal Reservation on appointments in the Travancore Government Service.

===Important regulations===
In 1932, Sree Chithira Thirunal passed &quot;The Travancore Kshatriya Regulation&quot; (excluding Travancore royal family), for the first time, to define and amend laws related to succession, marriage &amp; or its dissolution, property management and maintenance. The same year, the &quot;Travancore Muslim Succession Regulation&quot; was also passed to amend and define rules of succession among Muslim community. Another important bill passed in 1932 was &quot;The Jenmi-Kudiyaan Regulation&quot;. This bill proclaimed that the landlord (jenmi) will not have any right, claim or interest in the land holding except the right to receive land dues (jenmi karam). The right to review or enhance the jenmikaram rested with the government. This bill gave complete freedom for tenants (kudiyaan) over the tenant land, for the first time in history, without the interference of the landlords (janmi). It also stated that the tenant should pay the land dues to the government, in order to prevent exploitation and the government will then remit the dues to the land lords. Sree Chithira Thirunal also concentrated on improving the condition of women and children.

In Travancore, women were held in high respect due to the matrilineal law of inheritance, and widow remarriage was prevalent in majority of the communities. But widow remarriage was prohibited among certain communities like Vellalas, Nambuthiris, Potties, and many Brahmin communities in Travancore also. For Brahmin communities, other than Nambuthirs and potties, pre-pubescent marriage was also compulsory. So in order to stop the sufferings of widows and to prevent child marriages and other similar social evils and for the betterment of women, several new Bills were passed by the King: &quot;The Travancore Hindu Widows Remarriage Regulation (1938), The Travancore Child Marriage Restraint Act &amp; The Travancore Suppression Of Immoral Traffic Act (1941), The Travancore Maternity Benefit Act (1943)&quot; etc. aimed at the betterment of women and children.

===Educational reforms===

Sree Chithira Thirunal established the University of Travancore (now the University of Kerala) in under &quot;The Travancore University Regulation&quot; in 1937. The need for a separate University for Travancore had been felt for long. Two Committees were appointed to enquire into the question of establishing a separate University, in 1919 and 1924. After considering their recommendations, on 1 November 1937, Sree Chithira Thirunal issued the &quot;University Act&quot;. Special emphasis was given to vocational education to meet the requirements of modern conditions. The administration of the Government Colleges and the control of all the Private Colleges in the Kingdom were transferred to the university.

&quot;The Institute of Textile Technology&quot;, an Engineering College and Central Research Institute, to carry on research in Pure and Applied Sciences, were also started. &quot;A Department of Marine Biology&quot; was another significant addition. Institutions like the &quot;Observatory, the Public Library and the School of Arts&quot; were also placed under the university. He also formed a new form of University Training Corps, viz. Labour Corps, preceding the N C C, in the educational institutions. The expenses of the university were to be met fully by the Government. The College of Engineering, Medical College Hospital at Ulloor, Trivandrum&#x27;s SAT hospital were created at Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s behest. &quot;The Travancore Primary Education Act&quot;, by which Sree Chithira Thirunal introduced Free, Universal and Compulsory Education irrespective of caste, gender etc. The Act also prohibited child labour and also prohibited religious instruction in schools, thus making education completely secular.

===Industrial and infrastructure development===
According to historian, A. Sreedhara Menon, Sree Chithira Thirunal also initiated industrialization and increased the role of the public sector in Travancore. He introduced heavy industry in the State and established giant public sector undertakings. As many as twenty industries were established, mostly for utilizing the local raw materials such as rubber, ceramics and minerals. A majority of the premier industries running in Kerala even today were established by Sree Chithira Thirunal. Travancore Rubber Works, Kundara Ceramics, Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT), Travancore Titanium Products Ltd, Travancore-Cochin Chemicals, Punalur Paper Mills etc. are some of the industries started by him. Historian A. Sreedhara Menon referred to the administration of Sree Chithira Thirunal as &#x27;enlightened&#x27; as his reign saw remarkable progress in the fields of education, economy, defence &amp; society as a whole. Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, Public Transport Department (renamed Kerala State Road Transport Corporation), Pallivasal Hydro-electric project etc. was begun by him. 12 September 1945 as Travancore Bank Ltd. later known as STATE BANK OF TRAVANCORE (SBT). SBT was established in 1945 as the Travancore Bank Ltd., at the initiative of Travancore Diwan C. P. Ramaswami Iyer under the guidance of Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma.

Instead, the bank considered the Maharaja of Travancore Sri Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma as the founder. Although the Travancore government put up only 25% of the capital, the bank undertook government treasury work and foreign exchange business, apart from its general banking business. Its head office was at Thiruvananthapuram.

In 1960, it became a subsidiary of State Bank of India under the SBI Subsidiary Banks Act, 1959, enacted by the Parliament of India, and thus achieved the name &#x27;State Bank of Travancore&#x27;.

===Art, sports and culture===
Sree Chithira Thirunal patronized musicians, artists, dancers and Vedic scholars. He appointed, for the first time, an Art Advisor to Government, Dr. J. H. Cousins. He also inaugurated an art gallery named Sree Chitra Art Gallery, features a unique collection of traditional and contemporary paintings, including the works of Raja Ravi Varma, Nicholas Roerich, Svetoslav Roerich, Jamini Roy, Rabindranath Tagore, V. S. Valiathan, C. Raja Raja Varma, and K. C. S. Paniker. Sree Chithira Thirunal also started efforts to popularize Carnatic Music, especially the works of his ancestor &amp; Maharaja Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma. He assigned musicians Muthiah Bhagavathar and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer for this task. In 1939, Sree Chithira Thirunal started &quot;Sri Swathi Thirunal Music Academy&quot; (renamed as Sree Swathi Thirunal College of Music in 1962) with the primary objective of popularizing the Maharajah Sree Swathi Thirunal kritits (compositions). Nellikkampatty Game Sanctuary (renamed Periyar National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary (PNP)) was also created under his instructions. Sree Chithira Thirunal supported the vision and untiring works of his brother-in-law, Lt. Col. G. V. Raja, in the fields of Sports and Tourism. Lt. Col. G. V. Raja was synonymous with the establishment of Royal Flying Club, renamed Thiruvananthapuram International Airport and development of tourism in Travancore as well as Kerala. However, &quot;The Travancore Dramatic Performances Act&quot; in 1939 is considered by researchers as an attack on freedom of expression, as it prohibited materials that criticized the British Emperor or the government.
=== Banning of untouchability and Temple Entry Proclamation ===
During and immediately after the Vaikom Satyagraha, the general public started to support the temple entry movement in Kerala and due to the participation of Mahatma Gandhi, it got all India level importance as well. The Travancore Government, under the reign of Maharajah Sree Chithira Thirunal, decided to appoint a Temple Entry Enquiry Committee. The committee was formed on 25 November 1932 as per the order of the Maharajah. The committee was required to report on the subject of Temple Entry for the dalits, and appointed V.S. Subramania Aiyar as its president. But the Committee took a negative stance against Temple Entry and advised against the temple entry citing the possibility of civil disorder from the part of the upper castes.

The committee made the following observations regarding the temple entry:

The committee also suggested certain methods to the government by which the rigour of the custom, that excluded the dalits from the temple, might be softened. The Committee stated that Hindu community is bound to take immediate and adequate measures for the upliftment of the dalits, socially and economically, and it should be done independently of the question of temple entry.

The committee suggested for this following steps for the upliftment of dalits:

* Theendal (distance of pollution) should be removed by appropriate legislative measures, subject to reservations in the matter of entry into temples and into their adjuncts like temple-tanks, temple-wells, Homapura (places where prayer rituals were conducted), Anakottils (places where elephants are cared for) etc.
* Public tanks used for bathing purposes should be thrown open, after separate cisterns are attached to them or portions of them are walled off, where people could wash their clothes, etc. before getting into the tanks for bath.
* Public wells should be thrown open, after they are provided with cisterns, in which water should be stored from the wells by Municipal or Health Department employees, and from which water should be drained through taps.
* Government sathroms (inns) should be thrown open, after they are provided with separate kitchens, as in the case of such as are already open to all classes.

The above four observations were immediately put into action by the government and thus all restrictions on the usage of public amenities, like roads, wells, tanks etc. by the dalits, were removed. The practice of theendal (distance of pollution) or untouchability was immediately banned.

* Arrangements should be made for providing Bhajanamadoms (prayer centres), instituting religious lectures, opening schools for adult instruction, and having proper housing and sanitation and the adequate supply of wells and tanks for such Avarna Communities as in the opinion of Government require such assistance. This item may be so worked as to be completed in a definite period, say, ten years.
*&quot;In important centres, temples may be built and consecrated, where Savarnas (upper castes) and Avarnas may worship together, such savarnas retaining their full rights of worship etc., in temples where Avarnas are not now admitted.&quot;

According to Mahatma Gandhi University researchers, the report made by the Temple Entry Enquiry Committee was not relevant and became useless as it could not make satisfactory recommendations in the matter of temple entry for which it was primarily formed. After the submission of the Committee Report, people were not much interested in the temple entry movement in Travancore. But the temple entry question was discussed occasionally in Travancore without any serious organised attempts. Based on the research provided on Shodganga site, the efforts of &quot;Kerala Harijan Sevak Sangh&quot; played a big part in bringing the attention of the people, back to the cause. On 22 March 1936, at the annual meeting of Kerala Harijan Sevak Sangh, held at Trivandrum, a Temple Entry Committee was appointed for starting temple entry agitation in Kerala. By the decision of the Temple Entry Committee, several temple entry conferences were held at the capitals of Harijan Sevak Sangh in Kerala. After the conference, volunteers marched at various places to focus the attention of people in the matter of temple entry. In Travancore, though holding processions were prohibited at the time, they were permitted to conduct it by the government. Kerala Harijan Sevak Sangh also managed to gather the support of upper castes for the temple entry question and observed 19 April 1936 as the &quot;Temple Entry Day&quot; in Kerala. About 55,000 signatures of upper castes in Travancore were collected by their efforts. The Kerala State Temple Entry Conference held at Trivandrum on Mary 9th and 10th, presided by Srimathi Rameshwari Nehru, gathered more force and voice to the temple entry agitation. The resolution of temple entry, on equal status to all Hindus introduced by K. Kelappan, was unanimously passed in that conference. A team was also created in the Conference to introduce matter of the temple entry before Maharajah Sree Chithira Thirunal. Srimathi Rameshwari Nehru made a two weeks tour throughout Kerala and achieved public support for the temple entry movement. The study done by Mahatma Gandhi University researchers, published in the website, Shodhganga, has pointed out that, Sree Chithira Thirunal was indeed in full favour of a proper temple entry even when, the Maharajah of Cochin and British Malabar&#x27;s Zamorin, opposed it vigorously. G. D. Birla, the then President of &quot;All India Harijan Sevak Sangh&quot; had an audience with the Maharajah and did an interview with him in the third week of June 1936, which is mentioned in the research paper, &quot;TEMPLE ENTRY FREEDOM IN KERALA&quot;. The interview with Maharajah revealed that he indeed had favourable attitude towards the temple entry for dalits. A. V. Thackar, the Secretary of All India Harijan Sevak Sangh, in his speech at Calicut on 6 November 1936 too said that the Maharajah of Travancore may be taking the decision about the matter on the next birth day of Maharajah on 12 November, same year. The team from Kerala State Temple Entry Conference also met the then Prime Minister of Travancore, Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyer and handed over the memorial for submitting it to the Maharajah.

The historians also point out the fact that both the immediate predecessors of Sree Chithira Thirunal, i.e., Maharajah Moolam Thirunal as well as Regent Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, were against temple entry for dalits. The Vaikom Satyagraha leaders and volunteers were arrested and imprisoned on a large scale, during the reign of Moolam Thirunal. During the Regency of Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi those imprisoned were released and at the request of Mahatma Gandhi, she opened the west, south &amp; north public roads to Vaikom Mahadeva Temple to all castes. But she refused to open the eastern road to the same temple as it was used by Brahmins and also refused to give temple entry for all castes. For this, she was criticized by the likes of Mannathu Padmanabhan who accused that the Regent Maharani was under the influence of Tamil Brahmins, and her excuse that as the Regent she had no power to decide, was a lie. He retorted that she had complete power to give temple entry but she simply refused to do the same. This was further proved when Mahatma Gandhi, during a visit to Travancore, posed the question of temple entry to Regent Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi. She glossed over the question by saying that, it was wrong and most unfortunate but she had no power to do so as she was just a &#x27;Regent&#x27; for her then minor nephew, Maharajah Sree Chithira Thirunal and that Gandhi should the pose the question to him. A frustrated Gandhi repeated the question to the boy Maharajah. But much to the embarrassment of Regent Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, the 12-year-old Sree Chithira Thirunal, readily and without any consultation, promised Gandhi that he would allow temple entry during his reign. This incident was later quoted by Dr. K. R. Narayanan, the former President of India, in his speech referring to the progressive mind of Sree Chithira Thirunal even as a young boy.

With an outlook which no previous Indian ruler had been able to entertain for thousands of years, Sree Chithira Thirunal signed the Proclamation. On 12 November 1936, the Travancore Government published an extra-Ordinary Gazette which contained the Temple Entry Proclamation. Thus the Proclamation, issued by Maharajah Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, finally abolished the ban on Dalits from entering Hindu temples in Travancore (now part of Kerala, India) and also ended the cruel practice of untouchability. Historians and sociologists consider the proclamation as a milestone in the history of Travancore as well as the rest of Kerala. It was published on the eve of Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s birthday in 1112 (1936 A.D.). The Proclamation was received throughout India with delight and admiration.

Thus, Travancore achieved equal temple entry freedom of worship to all classes of Hindus in 1930s itself. The Proclamation was the first of its kind in Princely States as well as in British India. Even though there were agitations in various parts of India as well as rest of Kerala for temple entry, none managed to achieve their aim. The Travancore Temple Entry Proclamation could not make any serious effects in Cochin or British Malabar. The attitude of the Zamorin and the Maharajah of Cochin was not favourable towards it. Neither Zamorin nor the Maharajah of Cochin had any wishes to change the existing customs and usages in temples. According to historians, in such a context, the proclamation has far more importance, and through it, Travancore achieved the popularity as an enlightened progressive Princely State.

Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyer, the then Prime Minister of Travancore credited the Proclamation to the conviction of the young Maharajah and said:

The Prime Minister of Madras described the Proclamation as the &quot;greatest religious reform in India after the time of Asoka termed Sree Chithira Thirunal as the Modern Asoka of India&quot;.

Mahatma Gandhi in an open letter, addressed to Sree Chithira Thirunal, wrote:
The researchers believe that it was Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar&#x27;s legal skill that ironed out all the practical difficulties, posed by the orthodox section, before the Proclamation. He foresaw all the objections that could be raised against Temple Entry and dealt with them one by one. He was also able to ensure that the actual declaration was known beforehand to only very few people. To the people of Travancore, it came as a momentous announcement. The Universities of Andhra and Annamalai conferred D.Litts on the Maharajah. A life size statue of Sree Chithira Thirunal was erected in Trivandrum as well as Madras by the citizens there which were unveiled by the Rajah of Bilkanir and Lord Erstine, the then Governor of Madras, respectively.

===Political unrest===

Despite all the development and prosperity attained by his reign, Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s ruling period saw severe political unrest due to the then ongoing Indian freedom struggle. The Haripura Session of the Indian National Congress February 1938 resolved that in the Princely States by independent organisations may be encouraged to carry on internal struggles in these states. Gandhi&#x27;s view was that the demand made by the people of princely states for responsible government was just and proper added fuel to their works. Thus, the Travancore State Congress with Pattom Thanu Pillai, a lawyer and public figure of Travancore as its first president. The Travancore State Congress started an active campaign for the creation of responsible government in Travancore. Sir C. P. tried every possible measure to curb the congress activities but the party had become one of the major critics of Prime Minister (Diwan), Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyar. Meetings and demonstrations were banned and A. Narayana Pillai was arrested on a charge of sedition. According to Shodhganga website, &quot;the Dewan soon started a reign of terror to suppress the State Congress.&quot; The State Congress presented a memorandum to Sree Chithira Thirunal making him aware of the immediate need for the grant of responsible government and also bringing to his notice the repressive policies of his Prime Minister&#x27;s administration. Sir C. P. retaliated by declaring State Congress and its ally &#x27;All Travancore Youth League&#x27; as disloyal and subversive bodies. The Diwan cancelled the licences of news papers, Malayala Manorama and Kerala Kaumudi which published news relating to the activities of the State Congress. On 26 August 1938, the State Congress started a widespread Civil Disobedience Movement but leaders like Pattom Thanu Pillai and T. M. Varghese were arrested in Trivandrum. Then the congress organized a massive rally under the leadership of Akkamma Cherian on the birthday of the Maharaja on 12 November 1938. After understanding the seriousness of the situation, Sree Chithira Thirunal announced the withdrawal of the ban on the State Congress and the unconditional release of its leaders. But Sir C. P. put forward the condition of withdrawing the earlier memorandum which contained personal allegations against him which the Youth League opposed and left the Congress and strengthened the ranks of the Youth League whereas some formed radical group with Communist leanings and K. Krishna Pillai as its leader. The radical wing of the Youth League, consisting of the Communists, had decided to cooperate with the government in its war efforts following the entry of the USSR in the Second World War. But after the war, the Communist staged a violent protest against Sir C. p. which came to known as the much disputed Punnapra-Vayalar uprising. What ever be the aim or motive of the Communists for conducting Punnapra-Vayalar uprising, the government action which led to the death of hundreds of Communist Party workers, marred the otherwise progressive reign of Sree Chithira Thirunal. The image of Sir C. P. was destroyed irreparably, and has been since cast into the light of a &#x27;villain&#x27; by the entire political class in Kerala. The State Congress&#x27; long struggle for a responsible government finally became a reality in 1948 when Sree Chithira Thirunal announced the first public election in Travancore.

===Accession of Travancore to India===

On 3 June 1947, British announced the date of their withdrawal from India &amp; creation of two dominions. The Indian Independence Act 1947 provided that the suzerainty of the British Crown over the princely states would simply be terminated, with effect from 15 August 1947, that would leave the princely states completely independent. After British India became independent as two dominions in 1947, British Suzerainty was lifted from Travancore and in essence Travancore became Independent. The Instrument of Accession was a legal document created in 1947 to enable each of the rulers of the princely states under British suzerainty to join one of the new dominions of India or Pakistan created by the Partition of British India. Thus on 11 July, the Travancore Prime Minister, Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyar announced, at the behest of Sree Chithira Thirunal, that the Kingdom of Travancore will neither join India nor Pakistan but will remain an Independent Country. This led to protests in Travancore mainly from Congress and other political parties who feared that it only sought to perpetuate the autocratic rule of the then Diwan. Family sources indicate that Sir C. P., himself, was not in favour of independence but only greater autonomy and that a favourable agreement had been reached between Sir C. P. and the Indian representatives by 23 July 1947 and accession to the Indian Union could not be carried out only because it was pending approval by the Maharajah. Nevertheless, an assassination attempt was made on Sir C. P. by a Brahmin youth named K.C.S. Mani on 25 July 1947 during a concert commemorating the anniversary of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal.

As Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s decision to keep Travancore independent of India was unacceptable to the Indian government, several rounds of negotiations were held between the Maharaja and the Indian representatives. After holding discussions with Mountbatten, Sree Chithira Thirunal agreed to enter into a Stand-still Agreement with the Indian Union on 10 August 1947. And according to the Stand-still Agreement, Travancore&#x27;s domestic sovereignty will be accepted by the Indian government even though foreign policy &amp; defence will be in Indian government&#x27;s hand. But Travancore could indulge in foreign trade without India&#x27;s permission; also that there won&#x27;t be any interference in internal matters of Travancore by the Indian govt. But Louis Mountbatten withdrew all his assurances regarding maintaining Travancore&#x27;s sovereignty and another round of discussion started between Sree Chithira Thirunal and Indian representative, V. P. Menon. In 1948, Sree Chithira Thirunal announced first public election in Travancore to create responsible government with the Maharaja as the Constitutional Head of State.

At the same time, negotiation with the Indian union was ongoing and finally Sree Chithira Thirunal agreed to accede his state to the new Dominion of India in 1949. The neighbouring Cochin state was united with the Kingdom of Travancore. According to V. P. Menon, Sree Chithira Thirunal came close to refusing the post of &quot;Rajpramukh&quot; because he could not give oath to the Indian government as he had already taken the oath in front of his family deity Sree Padmanabha. He stated that he &quot;would rather abdicate his position and stand down for the welfare of his people.&quot; Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s conditions were accepted by the Indian representatives and V. P. Menon, the chief Indian negotiator, put forward the suggestion that as Sree Chithira Thirunal was unwilling to take the oath, he should write a letter to the Indian government assuring them his full co-operation and commitment to the post of &quot;Rajpramukh&quot;. Thus Sree Chithira Thirunal became the Rajpramukh of the newly created United States of Travancore-Cochin and his ancient Travancore Kingdom merged into the Union of India. He was an &quot;Hon. Major General&quot; with the British Indian Army and the &quot;Colonel-in-Chief and the Supreme Commander&quot; of the Travancore Army and of the Travancore-Cochin State Forces for the period 1949–54. He became an &quot;Hon. Colonel&quot; in the Indian Army as the Travancore Army was integrated by him into the former, after 1949, as the 9th (1st Travancore) and the 16th Battalion of the Madras Regiment (2nd Travancore).

==Rajpramukh of the United State of Travancore-Cochin==

 Following the national policy of integration, the State of Kochi and Travancore were merged into Travancore-Cochin State under a Rajpramukh. The rulers of Travancore and Cochin had entered into a Covenant to unite their States into one, with a common Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. The new entity was named the &quot;United State of Travancore and Cochin&quot;, better known as &quot;Thiru-Kochi&quot; inaugurated on 1 July 1949. Sree Chithira Thirunal became the Rajpramukh, Governor equivalent, of the newly formed United State. A Council of Ministers was to advise him in the exercise of his functions. They were to comply with the directions of the Government of India. Questions of disputed succession in regard to the State were to be decided by the Rajpramukh after referring it to the High Court of the United State and in accordance with the opinion of the latter.

According to Article XI of the Covenant, Rajpramukh Sree Chithira Thirunal promulgated an ordinance which declared that the laws existing in the two states should continue to be in force in their respective territories and the courts, both civil and criminal. They would continue to enjoy their existing jurisdiction and powers conferred on them. The courts were to eliminate conflicts arising from the application of laws by interpretation. Another Ordinance led to the creation of the High Court of the United State of Travancore-Cochin. Sree Chithira Thirunal was empowered to appoint the Chief Justice and other judges of the High Court whose number was fixed at not less than five. The Ordinance prescribed the powers and jurisdiction of the High Court including the superintendence over all subordinate courts. All appeals pending before the High Courts of Travancore and Cochin were to be heard by the High Court of the United State. The seat of the new High Court was decided to be at Ernakulam. Sree Chithira Thirunal had already executed an &quot;Instrument of Accession&quot; under section 6 of the Government of India Act, 1935, thereby accepting the supremacy of Dominion Legislature. He served as the first and only Rajpramukh of the Travancore-Cochin Union from 1 July 1949 to 31 October 1956, which was the entire duration of the existence of that political entity.

The movement for a united (Aikya) Kerala gathered momentum with the attainment of independence. The first concrete step in this direction was taken on 1 July 1949. The next step came with the reorganization of States on a linguistic basis in the light of the report of the States Reorganization Commission. It was decided to add Malabar district and the Kasargod taluk of south Canara district to Travancore-Kochi and to separate the Tamil-speaking southern region of old Travancore from Travancore-Kochi for inclusion in Madras State. On 1 November 1956, the state of Kerala was created by uniting the Malayalam-speaking areas of the Travancore-Cochin Union with those of neighbouring Madras State, and Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s office of Rajpramukh came to an end. Thus, after a hectic public life of 25 years, Maharajah Sree Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma retired from active public service in 1956.

==Criticism and allegations==
V. P. Menon, the chief Indian negotiator, alleged in his book that, Sree Chithira Thirunal was against the prospect of the Maharajah of Cochin becoming &quot;Uprajpramukh&quot;, as both Travancore and Cochin Kingdoms had a long-standing rivalry from early times itself; Cochin used to be a tributary of Travancore before the arrival of the British. Also when Sree Chithira Thirunal did the Temple Entry Proclamation in Travancore, allowing untouchables to enter all Travancore Hindu temples, the ruler of Cochin refused to accept it. This caused a further strain in their already shaky relationship.

Lakshmi Raghunanadan (a granddaughter of Senior Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi) alleged that Sree Chithira Thirunal initiated a move to overtake her grandmother&#x27;s summer estate at Peermade in 1938 which however did not happen due to the intervention of the then British Resident of Travancore. A division of royal properties and estates were done, after the cancellation of Privy Purse by the Indian government, in 1971. The properties were divided between the branch of Sethu Lakshmi Bayi and Sethu Parvathi Bayi, the Senior and Junior Maharanis of Travancore. The terms of division of properties was accepted by all members of both branches. But later Revathi Thirunal Balagopal Varma, (the grandson of Senior Queen Sethu Lakshmi Bayi) who at the time of property division was a minor, accused that Sree Chithira Thirunal had taken away a property, Poojappura Satelmond Palace, that rightly belonged to his grandmother, the Senior Maharani. Sree Chithira Thirunal had given away this Palace to the Government of Kerala to construct a new Medical Centre, the now famous, Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology, in 1974. Revathi Thirunal Balagopal Varma also accused Chithira Thirunal of unlawfully taking away the traditional holdings of Sethu Lakshmi Bayi as Senior Rani of Attingal. Her case was presented to the then Viceroy of India in the 1930s but was dismissed by him, as former Travancore Maharaja Marthanda Varma had already removed all the powers of Attingal Queens in the 18th century itself.

Revathi Thirunal Balagopal Varma took his grievance first to the High Court of Kerala and later to the Supreme Court of India. However, at both courts, the verdicts came in favour of Sree Chithira Thirunal and the appellant Revathi Thirunal&#x27;s case was dismissed in the final judgement of 1991 by the Supreme Court of India.

==Later years==

After retiring from active public life in 1956, Sree Chithira Thirunal turned his attention towards business and acquired some shares in the spice trading company &quot;Aspinwall Ltd&quot;. In the early 1970s, when the English owners decided to withdraw their investment, major portion of the company&#x27;s shares was bought by Sree Chithira Thirunal. After his demise, his legal heirs in the Travancore royal family hold the controlling interests of the company to date. As part of the agreement during Travancore-Cochin Union formation, the control of &quot;Sree Padmanabhaswami Temple&quot; was also left to Sree Chithira Thirunal. When the Privy Purse was cancelled, according to his niece and writer Aswathy Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi, in one stroke, he lost 18 Lakhs (per year), the majority of which he was using to support the &quot;Padmanabhaswami Temple&quot;, despite this, he supported the temple from his own private funds. As Padmanabhadasa and hereditary head trustee, he conducted the &quot;Murajapam&quot; and &quot;Lakshadeepam&quot; ceremonies in Padmanabhaswamy Temple, more times than all his predecessors. He also decided to use electric lights for the first time for the &quot;Lakshadeepam&quot; when there was scarcity of oil and cost escalation. Under his decision, &quot;Padmanabhaswami Temple&quot; was electrified except inside the Sreekovil. He also brought forth Pension system for the employees of &quot;Padmanabhaswami Temple&quot;.

On 28 December 1971, Sree Chithira Thirunal lost his privy purse when the Government of India de-recognized the status of the Maharajahs of the erstwhile princely states, as rulers and was thus politically stripped. However the titles as well as other clauses of the agreements signed between the Government of India and the Maharaja in 1947 legally still hold. He thus became the Titular Maharajah of Travancore from 1971. The famous Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology was created with the personal funds of Sree Chithira Thirunal, after Privy Purse was cancelled by the Govt. Of India. Sree Chithira Thirunal established many charitable trusts for helping the needy financially in medical, educational and cultural fields. Sree Chithira Thirunal also sponsored the higher education of a young K. R. Narayanan who went on to become the 10th President of India.

===Personal life===

Sree Chithira Thirunal was famous for his devotion and piety towards his family deity &quot;Sree Padmanabha&quot; and many has often compared him to his ancestor Maharaja Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma in terms of devotion to the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. According to his niece, Pooyam Thirunal Gauri Parvathi Bayi, Sree Chithira Thirunal led a simple life as &quot;Padmanabhadasa&quot; and that he had a tremendous sense of humour, love for painting and drawing, fondness for knowledge about Puranas, religion, politics and history. Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s devotion to Sree Padmanabha Swamy was very famous and had been referred to by many leaders including Sardar Patel, Indira Gandhi etc. He was called &quot;Ponnammavan&quot; by his family at Kowdiar.

Sree Chithira Thirunal was married to Panapillai Lakshmi Pillai of Kattakkada Amma Veedu and the couple had a daughter, Sethu Parvathy Devi Thankachhi.

==Death==
According to niece and writer Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi, by the late 1980s, Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s health had deteriorated rapidly. But against the warnings of his doctors, he continued to lead the Arattu Processions of Padmanabhaswamy Temple. And on 31 March 1991 despite his highly weakened body and advanced age, he led the procession, and other temple rituals, by walking barefoot with four and half kilogram sword in his hand, escorting the deities to the Shankumugham beach as well as back to the Padmaanabhaswamy Temple, which the common people considered as the symbol of Sree Chithira Thirunal&#x27;s devotion to his Tutelary deity, &quot;Sree Padmanabha&quot;. After 15 days, he was hospitalized and was discharged after a couple of days.

On 11 July 1991, while getting ready for his daily morning darshan to Padmanabhaswamy Temple, Sree Chithira Thirunal fell down unconscious. It was diagnosed that he had suffered a stroke and was admitted to the Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology, aged seventy-eight. He remained in a state of coma for nine days and died, early morning on 20 July, the same year. After his death, there was a massive outpouring of public grief, he was a widely respected and much adored figure of Kerala. He was given full military as well government honours, as the Maharaja of Travancore as well as the former Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Travancore Armed Forces and the then Hon. Colonel of the 9th and 16th Battalion (formerly the 1st &amp; 2nd Travancore Infantry) of the Madras Regiment. The Indian Army oversaw and controlled the public proceedings of his cremation. He was cremated at his official residence, Kowdiar Palace, based on the rites and rituals of Kshatriyas. Adhering to Marumakkathayam Law, his funeral rites were done by his younger brother, Sree Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma and his only nephew Sree Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma who are the legal heirs of Sree Chithira Thirunal. He had ruled Travancore for 67 years and at his death, was one of the last surviving rulers of a first-class princely state in the old British Raj. He was also the last surviving &quot;Knight Grand Commander&quot; of both the Order of the Star of India and of the Order of the Indian Empire. The Government of India issued a stamp in 1991, commemorating the reforms that marked the reign of Sree Chithira Thirunal as the Maharaja of Travancore. He was succeeded, as head of the Travancore royal house as well as the Titular Maharajah of Travancore, by his younger brother, Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma.

===Sree Chithira Thirunal Memorial Lecture===

Every year, since 1992, the Sree Chithira Thirunal Memorial Lecture is held in the honour of the Maharajah on his birth anniversary at Kanakakunnu Palace, Thiruvananthapuram. The first ever Lecture was delivered by the then Vice President of India, Dr. K. R. Narayanan. The lecture is organized by &quot;Sree Chithira Thirunal Smaraka Samithi&quot;, a trust that organizes all celebrations related to the birth anniversary of the Maharajah every year.

===Sree Chithira Thirunal National Award===

The Sree Chithira Thirunal National Award was set up by the &quot;Sree Chithira Thirunal Trust&quot; in the memory of the Maharajah Sree Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma in 2006. It carries a purse of one lakh Indian rupees and a citation. It honours those individuals who have made exceptional contributions in fields such as science, sports, technology, literature, art, medicine, cinema and education.

The winners are selected by a panel consisting of trust Chairman T. Raveendran Thampi, managing trustee T. Satheesh Kumar and by eminent individuals from different fields of the society.

<text>In aircraft design and aerospace engineering, a high-lift device is a component or mechanism on an aircraft&#x27;s wing that increases the amount of lift produced by the wing. The device may be a fixed component, or a movable mechanism which is deployed when required. Common movable high-lift devices include wing flaps and slats. Fixed devices include leading-edge slots, leading edge root extensions, and boundary layer control systems.

==Purpose==
The size and lifting capacity of a fixed wing is chosen as a compromise between differing requirements. For example, a larger wing will provide more lift and reduce the distance and speeds required for takeoff and landing, but will increase drag, which reduces performance during the cruising portion of flight. Modern passenger jet wing designs are optimized for speed and efficiency during the cruise portion of flight, since this is where the aircraft spends the vast majority of its flight time. High-lift devices compensate for this design trade-off by adding lift at takeoff and landing, reducing the speed and distance required to safely land the aircraft, and allowing the use of a more efficient wing in flight. The high-lift devices on the Boeing 747-400, for example, increase the wing area by 21% and increase the lift generated by 90%.

==Types of device==

===Flaps===

The most common high-lift device is the flap, a movable portion of the wing that can be lowered to produce extra lift. When a flap is lowered this re-shapes the wing section to give it more camber. Flaps are usually located on the trailing edge of a wing, while leading edge flaps are used occasionally. There are many kinds of trailing-edge flap.

Simple hinged flaps came into common use in the 1930s, along with the arrival of the modern fast monoplane which had higher landing and takeoff speeds than the old biplanes.

In the split flap, the lower surface hinges downwards while the upper surface remains either fixed to the wing or moves independently.

Travelling flaps also extend backwards, to increase the wing chord when deployed, increasing the wing area to help produce yet more lift. These began to appear just before World War II due to the efforts of many different individuals and organizations in the 1920s and 30s.

Slotted flaps comprise several separate small airfoils which separate apart, hinge and even slide past each other when deployed. Such complex flap arrangements are found on many modern aircraft. Large modern airliners make use of &quot;triple-slotted flaps&quot; to produce the massive lift required during takeoff.

===Slats and slots===

Another common high-lift device is the slat, a small aerofoil shaped device attached just in front of the wing leading edge. The slat re-directs the airflow at the front of the wing, allowing it to flow more smoothly over the upper surface when at a high angle of attack. This allows the wing to be operated effectively at the higher angles required to produce more lift. A slot is the gap between the slat and the wing. The slat may be fixed in position, with a slot permanently in place behind it, or it may be retractable so that the slot is closed when not required. If it is fixed, then it may appear as a normal part of the leading edge of a wing, with the slot buried in the wing surface immediately behind it.

A slat or slot may be either full-span, or may be placed on only part of the wing (usually outboard), depending on how the lift characteristics need to be modified for good low speed control. Slots and slats are sometimes used just for the section in front of the ailerons, ensuring that when the rest of the wing stalls, the ailerons remain usable.

The first slats were developed by Gustav Lachmann in 1918 and simultaneously by Handley-Page who received a patent in 1919. By the 1930s automatic slats had been developed, which opened or closed as needed according to the flight conditions. Typically they were operated by airflow pressure against the slat to close it, and small springs to open it at slower speeds when the dynamic pressure reduced, for example when the speed fell or the airflow reached a predetermined angle-of-attack on the wing.

Modern systems, like modern flaps, can be more complex and are typically deployed hydraulically or with servos.

===Boundary layer control and blown flaps===
Powered high-lift systems generally use airflow from the engine to shape the flow of air over the wing, replacing or modifying the action of the flaps. Blown flaps take &quot;bleed air&quot; from the jet engine&#x27;s compressor or engine exhaust and blow it over the rear upper surface of the wing and flap, re-energising the boundary layer and allowing the airflow to remain attached at higher angles of attack. A more advanced version of the blown flap is the circulation control wing, a mechanism that ejects air backwards over a specially designed airfoil to create lift through the Coandă effect. The Blackburn Buccaneer had a sophisticated boundary layer control (BLC) system which involved compressor air blown onto the wings and tailplane to reduce the stalling speed and facilitate operations from smaller aircraft carriers. 

Another approach is to use the airflow from the engines directly, by placing a flap so that it deploys into the path of the exhaust. Such flaps require greater strength due to the power of modern engines and also greater heat resistance to the hot exhaust, but the effect on lift can be significant. Examples include the C-17 Globemaster III.

===Leading edge root extensions===

More common on modern fighter aircraft but also seen on some civil types, is the leading-edge root extension (LERX), sometimes called just a leading edge extension (LEX). A LERX typically consist of a small triangular fillet attached to the wing leading edge root and to the fuselage. In normal flight the LERX generates little lift. At higher angles of attack, however, it generates a vortex that is positioned to lie on the upper surface of the main wing. The swirling action of the vortex increases the speed of airflow over the wing, so reducing the pressure and providing greater lift. LERX systems are notable for the potentially large angles in which they are effective.

===Co-Flow Jet===

A Co-Flow Jet (CFJ) wing has an upper surface with an injection slot after the leading edge and a suction slot before the trailing edge, to augment lift, increase the stall margin and reduce drag.
CFJ is promoted by the mechanical and aerospace engineering department of the University of Miami.
For a hybrid-electric regional aircraft based on the ATR 72 with the same wing area, size and weight, CFJ improves its cruise lift coefficient for a higher wing loading, allowing more fuel and batteries for longer range.

<text>The year 1958 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

==Events==
* During International Geophysical Year
** Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere is discovered.
** The 3rd Soviet Antarctic Expedition discovers the subglacial Gamburtsev Mountain Range in Antarctica; also becoming the first to reach the Southern Pole of Inaccessibility (December 14).
** The Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition completes (March 2) its three-year mission to make the first overland crossing of Antarctica, via the South Pole. The first (and third ever) team to reach the Pole overland (January 3) is Edmund Hillary&#x27;s, using adapted Ferguson TE20 tractors, the first powered vehicles to complete a trip here.
* April 17–October 19 – Expo 58 in Brussels. The centrepiece is the Atomium; and a model of tobacco mosaic virus structure by Rosalind Franklin&#x27;s research team is exhibited.
* July 9 – 1958 Lituya Bay megatsunami: A 7.8 strike-slip earthquake in Southeast Alaska causes a landslide that produces a megatsunami. The runup from the waves reaches on the rim of Lituya Bay.

==Astronomy and space exploration==
* January 4 – Sputnik 1 falls to Earth from its orbit and burns up (launched on October 4, 1957).
* January 31 – The first successful American satellite, Explorer I, is launched into orbit.

* February 11 – The strongest known solar maximum is recorded.
* March 5 – Explorer 2 fails to reach orbit.
* March 17 – Vanguard 1 becomes the first of its program to enter space, after three failed attempts.
* March 26 – Explorer 3 is launched into orbit.
* April 14 – Sputnik 2 re-enters Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.
* July 29 – The United States Congress formally creates the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
* September 14 – Two rockets designed by Ernst Mohr (the first post-war German rockets) reach the upper atmosphere.
* December 18 – The United States launches SCORE, the world&#x27;s first communications satellite.

==Biology==
* Francis Crick states the &quot;central dogma of molecular biology&quot;.
* John Gurdon clones a frog using somatic-cell nuclear transfer from a &quot;Xenopus&quot; tadpole.
* Anne McLaren, with John D. Biggers, reports the first mammals, a litter of mice, grown from embryos developed &quot;in vitro&quot; and transferred to a surrogate mother.
* Danish virologist Preben von Magnus gives the first confirmation of monkeypox virus and description of monkeypox (in laboratory crab-eating macaques).

==Chemistry==
* Denatonium, the bitterest chemical compound known (used as an aversive agent), is discovered during research on local anesthetics by Macfarlan Smith of Edinburgh, Scotland, and registered under the trademark &quot;Bitrex&quot;.
* Instant noodles introduced by Momofuku Ando.

==Computer science==
* May 27–June 2 – A joint meeting of the ACM and GAMM at ETH Zurich agrees to produce the &quot;International Algebraic Language&quot;, which will become the programming language ALGOL.
* Friedrich L. Bauer and other members of the ZMMD-Group build a working ALGOL 58 compiler.
* John McCarthy specifies the Lisp programming language.

==History of science==
* Society for the History of Technology established.

==Mathematics==
* School Mathematics Study Group, directed by Edward G. Begle, established to develop a new school mathematics curriculum for the United States; it is influential in the promotion of New Math.

==Medicine==
* May 22 – Jérôme Lejeune, working with Marthe Gautier in Raymond Turpin&#x27;s French laboratory, discovers that the genetic cause of Down syndrome is an extra copy of chromosome 21, the first time that a defect in intellectual development is shown to be linked to chromosomal abnormalities.
* June 7 – Ian Donald publishes an article in &quot;The Lancet&quot; which describes the diagnostic use of ultrasound in obstetrics.
* October 31 – The first clinical implantation into a human of a fully implantable artificial pacemaker takes place at the Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden, using a pacemaker designed by Rune Elmqvist and surgeon Åke Senning. The patient, Arne Larsson (1915–2001), survives until age 86, having been fitted with 22 pacemakers throughout his life.
* Engineer Earl Bakken (U.S.) produces the first &quot;wearable&quot; external artificial pacemaker, for a patient of Dr. C. Walton Lillehei.
* B. Eiseman and colleagues from Colorado first describe fecal microbiota transplantation.
* Denis Parsons Burkitt first describes Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma.

==Paleontology==
* February 7 – Discovery of &quot;Deep Skull&quot; in Niah Caves in Sarawak by Barbara and Tom Harrisson, at around 40,000 years BP the oldest known evidence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; in southeast Asia.

<doc id="609945" wikidata="Q6068186" url="?curid=609945" title="Iraqi sovereignty during the Iraq War">
<text>[[Iraq]]i sovereignty was interrupted by the multinational forces which overthrew Saddam Hussein in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

On 8 June 2004, the United Nations Security Council resolution 1546 was adopted unanimously, calling for &quot;the end of the occupation and the assumption of full responsibility and authority by a fully sovereign and independent Interim Government of Iraq by 30 June 2004.&quot;

The transfer of sovereignty actually took place a day or two ahead of schedule. Though resulting in the legal return of sovereignty to an Iraqi-led governing force and technically ending the occupation, practical responsibilities continue to be handed over by the multinational force in Iraq.

==History==

After major combat operations ended, US President George W. Bush set up the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and led by United States civilian administrator Paul Bremer. On July 22, 2003, the CPA formed the Iraqi Governing Council. The council created a provisional constitution guaranteeing freedom of religion but also forbidding any law to be created that violates the principles of Islam.

The multinational forces set June 30 as the deadline for transferring power back to the Iraqis. As the deadline loomed, fighting increased, with various local insurgents trying to grab power away from the national council and (presumably) prevent Iraq from becoming a sovereign republic. Instability, resentment, and a vacuum of legitimate power resulting from the occupation encouraged some militants from neighboring countries to join in the fight. &quot;Washington Times&quot; reporter Rowan Scarborough wrote, &quot;Foreign fighters from Syria have become a major stumbling block to stabilizing Iraq and turning over sovereignty by June 30&quot;. On 8 June 2004, the United Nations Security Council resolution 1546 was adopted unanimously and the transfer took place a day or two ahead of schedule.

On January 30, 2005, Iraq&#x27;s first post-war democratic elections were held, without much violence. These elections created the Iraqi National Assembly, which in April 2005 appointed a new administration, including President Jalal Talabani and Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari. The US administration has repeatedly claimed that they would leave the country if asked to do so by the Iraqi leadership. Talabani stated that improvements in the strength of Iraq&#x27;s own army could enable US troop reductions of up to 50,000 by the end of 2005, though he later backtracked from that claim.

Under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1790, the mandate of the multinational force in Iraq was extended until December 31, 2008. On June 6, 2008, the &quot;Independent&quot; reported that the United States was applying pressure to the government of Iraq to sign a &quot;strategic alliance&quot; (not a &quot;treaty&quot;, which would require approval of the US senate), giving US forces broad freedom in continuing to operate in Iraq.

==Controversy==

Supporters of the Iraq war tend to agree with the view that Iraq regained its sovereignty in June 2003, and that the occupation has thus ended. These advocates regard the insurgents as rebels against the Iraqi authorities. Some opponents of the war regard the continued presence of the multinational forces in Iraq as constituting an occupation.

Accordingly, they describe the insurgents in positive terms as &quot;resistance&quot; fighters whose main aim is to expel the foreign forces. Critics may make comparisons to the Vichy regime in France and the 1980s Kremlin-backed regime in Soviet-occupied Afghanistan (which was considered a puppet regime by Britain and America, who backed mujahadeen guerrillas against the Russians and Afghan regime forces). These claims would be disputed by those who consider Iraq is now sovereign.

<doc id="609947" wikidata="Q7762642" url="?curid=609947" title="The Scottish Play">
<text>The Scottish Play and the Bard&#x27;s play are euphemisms for the William Shakespeare play &quot;Macbeth&quot;. The first is a reference to the play&#x27;s Scottish setting, and the second is a reference to Shakespeare&#x27;s popular nickname. According to a theatrical superstition, called the &quot;Scottish curse&quot;, speaking the name &quot;Macbeth&quot; inside a theatre, other than as called for in the script while rehearsing or performing, will cause disaster. On top of the aforementioned alternative titles, some people also refer to the classical tragedy as &quot;Mackers&quot; for this reason. Variations of the superstition may also forbid quoting lines from the play within a theatre except as part of an actual rehearsal or performance of the play.

Because of this superstition, the title character is often referred to as the &quot;Scottish King&quot; or &quot;Scottish Lord&quot;. Lady Macbeth is often referred to as the &quot;Scottish Lady&quot; or &quot;Lady M&quot;. However, one of the most popular traditions among Shakespeare-specific actors allows &quot;Macbeth&quot; as a reference to the character. Nonetheless, many call the pair &quot;Macb&quot; and &quot;Lady Macb&quot;.

==Origins==
The traditional origin is said to be a curse set upon the play by a coven of witches, angry at Shakespeare for using a real spell. One hypothesis for the origin of this superstition is that &quot;Macbeth&quot;, being a popular play, was commonly put on by theatres in financial trouble, or that the high production costs of &quot;Macbeth&quot; put theatres in financial trouble. Hence, an association was made between productions of &quot;Macbeth&quot; and theatres going out of business.

==Cleansing rituals==
When the name of the play is spoken in a theatre, tradition requires the person who spoke it to leave, perform traditional cleansing rituals, and be invited back in. The rituals are supposed to ward off the evil that uttering the play&#x27;s name is feared to bring on.

The rituals include turning three times, spitting over one&#x27;s left shoulder, swearing, or reciting a line from another of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. Popular lines for this purpose include, &quot;Angels and ministers of grace defend us&quot; (&quot;Hamlet&quot; 1.IV), &quot;If we shadows have offended&quot; (&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; 5.II), and &quot;Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you&quot; (&quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, 3.IV). A more elaborate cleansing ritual involves leaving the theatre, spinning around and brushing oneself off, and saying &quot;Macbeth&quot; three times before entering again. Some production groups insist that the offender may not re-enter the theatre until invited to do so, therefore making it easy to punish frequent offenders by leaving them outside.

A portrayal of the ritual occurs in the 1983 film &quot;The Dresser&quot;, in which the lead character Sir is the offender, and his dresser Norman officiates over the propitiation.

The cleansing rituals have been parodied numerous times in popular culture, including in &quot;Blackadder&quot;, &quot;Slings and Arrows&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and &quot;Make It Pop&quot;. For example, in the &quot;Blackadder&quot; episode &quot;Sense and Senility&quot;, a parody ritual performed by two actors involves slapping each other&#x27;s hands pat-a-cake fashion, followed by tweaking the other person&#x27;s nose. In &quot;Slings and Arrows&quot;, a guest director mocks the superstition by saying &quot;Macbeth&quot; onstage. While spinning around, she falls off on her third spin, resulting in an injury that takes her out of commission for the rest of the season. On &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the core five are invited into a performance by Ian McKellen (in Scottish attire, clearly in the title role). The family keeps saying the title, which only makes more bad luck strike the actor, including lightning striking him and the &quot; falling from the signage (leaving the &quot;).

Patrick Stewart, on the radio program &quot;Ask Me Another&quot;, asserted that &quot;if you have played the role of the Scottish thane, then you are allowed to say the title, any time anywhere.&quot;

==Historical mishaps==
English actor Harold Norman, playing Macbeth, was mortally wounded in a sword fight during a performance of &quot;Macbeth&quot; at Oldham&#x27;s Colosseum Theatre on 30 January 1947. He died in hospital three weeks later.

On 2 December 1964, a fire burned down the D. Maria II National Theatre in Lisbon, Portugal. At the time, the play being shown was &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

In 1980, a production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; at The Old Vic starring Peter O&#x27;Toole, often referred to as &quot;Macdeath&quot;, was performed. It was reviewed so badly that the Prospect Theatre Company disbanded shortly after the play.

Mishaps on the set of his film &quot;Opera&quot; led director Dario Argento to believe that the film had been affected by the Macbeth curse; the opera being performed within the film is Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

In 1988, Bulgarian singer, coach, and translator Bantcho Bantchevsky committed suicide while attending a nationally broadcast matinee of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;. He propelled himself backward from a balcony railing at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Square.

Ari Aster, writer and director of &quot;Hereditary&quot;, said that during filming, &quot;Alex Wolff told me not to say the name of William Shakespeare&#x27;s Scottish play out loud because of some superstitious theater legend. I smugly announced the name, and then one of our lights burst during the shooting of the following scene.&quot;

At the 94th Academy Awards, Chris Rock congratulated Denzel Washington on his performance in &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot;, saying the name of the Scottish play aloud in the Dolby Theatre. Moments later, Rock was slapped by Will Smith after making a joke about Smith&#x27;s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. Viewers, including playwright Lynn Nottage, quickly took to social media to joke that Rock had suffered the curse of the Scottish play.

Further instances include the Astor Place Riot in 1849, injuries sustained by actors at a 1937 performance at The Old Vic that starred Laurence Olivier, Diana Wynyard&#x27;s accidental fall in 1948, and burns suffered by Charlton Heston in 1954.

<text>Alexander Cruden (31 May 16991 November 1770) was the Scottish author of an early Bible concordance, a proofreader and publisher, and self-styled Corrector of the nation&#x27;s morals.

==Early life and career==

Alexander Cruden was born in Aberdeen in Scotland (baptised on 8 June 1699, St. Nicholas Kirk, Aberdeen, according to recent research) and was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and Marischal College, University of Aberdeen, and became an excellent Latin, Greek and Biblical scholar.

He took the degree of Master of Arts, but soon after began to show signs of insanity, owing to a disappointment in love. After a term of confinement he recovered and removed to London. In 1722 he had an engagement as private tutor to the son of a country squire living at Eton Hall, Southgate, and also held a similar post at Ware.

In 1729 he was employed by the 10th Earl of Derby as a reader and secretary, but was discharged on the 7th of July for his ignorance of French pronunciation. He then lodged in a house in Soho frequented exclusively by Frenchmen, and took lessons in the language in the hope of getting back his post with the earl, but when he went to Knowsley Hall in Lancashire, the earl would not see him.

==Concordance==

Cruden&#x27;s Bible Concordance became well-known, and further editions were published after his death. It has not been out of print since 1737 and is still encountered today on the shelves of priests and biblical scholars.

There were some primitive concordances before Cruden; however, they were unsystematic, popular aids rather than scholarly tools. Cruden worked alone and produced the most consistent and complete concordance until the introduction of computerised indexing. As well as compiling occurrences, he also invented a new method of presentation, which showed the surrounding sentence rather than just the verse reference. It provided the literary context and so made the concordance significantly easier to handle for false positives.

Cruden presented the first edition of his work on 3 November 1737 to Queen Caroline (wife of George II); but she died some days later without rewarding Cruden, who had to go into debt to finance the printing. The second edition of the &quot;Concordance&quot; was dedicated to King George III and presented to him in person on 21 December 1761; the King awarded Cruden £100 for his efforts. The third edition was published in 1769. After the slow success of the first edition, the second and third made Cruden considerable profit.

==Corrector==

As well as producing the concordance, Cruden worked as a proofreader and bookseller. Several editions of Greek and Latin classics are said to have owed their accuracy to his care. He opened a booksellers shop in the Royal Exchange. In April 1735 he obtained the title of bookseller to the Queen by recommendation of the Lord Mayor and most of the Whig aldermen. The post was an unremunerative sinecure. After failing to obtain the honour of knighthood, he was nominated as Parliamentary candidate for the City of London in 1754, but he decided to withdraw. At some point after this, Cruden adopted the title of &quot;Corrector&quot;. Cruden saw it as his personal mission to safeguard the nation&#x27;s spelling and grammar, and through that, the nation&#x27;s moral health. He was particularly concerned with misspelt signs, graffiti, swearing and the keeping of the Sabbath, and was in the habit of carrying a sponge, with which he effaced all inscriptions and signs which he thought incorrect or contrary to good morals.

He was treated with the respect due to his learning by officials and residents in both (Oxford and Cambridge) universities, but experienced some boisterous fooling at the hands of the undergraduates. At Cambridge he was knighted with mock ceremonies. There he appointed deputy correctors to represent him in the university. He also visited Eton, Windsor, Tonbridge, and Westminster schools, where he appointed four boys to be his deputies. &quot;An Admonition to Cambridge&quot; is preserved among letters from J. Neville of Emmanuel to Dr. Cos Macro, in the British Museum.

Against the radical John Wilkes, whom he hated, he wrote a small pamphlet, and used to delete with his sponge the number 45 wherever he found it, this being the offensive symbol of Wilkes.

&quot;The Correctors Earnest Address to the Inhabitants of Great Britain,&quot; published in 1756, was occasioned by the earthquake at Lisbon. In 1762 he saved an ignorant seaman, Richard Potter, from the gallows, and in 1763 published a pamphlet recording the history of the case. In 1769 he lectured in Aberdeen as Corrector, and distributed copies of the fourth commandment and various religious tracts. The wit that made his eccentricities palatable is illustrated by the story of how he gave to a conceited young minister whose appearance displeased him &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Catechism dedicated to the young and ignorant&quot;.

==Other works==

Cruden published a pamphlet dedicated to Lord H. (probably Harrington, a Secretary of State) entitled &quot;The London Citizen exceedingly injured, or a British Inquisition Displayed&quot;. He also published an account of his legal problems, dedicated to the King.

He superintended the printing of one of Matthew Henry&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot;, and in 1750 printed a small &quot;Compendium of the Holy Bible&quot; (an abstract of the contents of each chapter). In 1761 Cruden compiled &quot;A Complete Concordance to the Apocrypha&quot;, generally known as &quot;Cruden&#x27;s Concordance&quot;. 
&quot;The Scripture Dictionary&quot;, compiled during Cruden&#x27;s later years, was printed in Aberdeen in two volumes shortly after his death in 1770.

==Mental health==

After his University education, Cruden was set to enter the church until his mental health was called into question and he was institutionalised. This was the first of several stays in mental hospitals throughout his life.

Cruden&#x27;s frequent institutionalisation is a matter of academic debate. Traditionally, Cruden&#x27;s apparent madness has been interpreted as the other side of his focused brilliance. However Julia Keay argued that he was not mad, but he was initially put away to silence his criticisms of incestuous marriages among the nobility, and later by women who rejected his unwanted affections; he paid unwelcome addresses to a widow which resulted in an enforced stay in Matthew Wright&#x27;s Private Madhouse in Bethnal Green, London.

In September 1753, through being involved in a street brawl, he was confined in an asylum in Chelsea for seventeen days at the insistence of his sister (Mrs. Isobella Wild of Middle Green Langley). He brought an unsuccessful action against his friends, and seriously proposed that they should go into confinement as an atonement.

In April 1755 he printed a letter to The Speaker and other Members of the House of Commons, and about the same time an &quot;Address&quot; to the King and Parliament. Also in 1755 he paid unwelcome addresses to the daughter of Sir Thomas Abney, of Newington (1640–1722).

Cruden was never married.

==Death==

Cruden died suddenly while praying in his lodgings in Camden Passage, Islington, on 1 November 1770. He was buried in the ground of a Protestant dissenting congregation in Dead Man&#x27;s Place, Southwark. He bequeathed a portion of his savings for a bursary at Aberdeen, which preserves his name on the list of benefactors of the university.

<text>Cathine, also known as -norpseudoephedrine or as (+)-norpseudoephedrine, is a psychoactive drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine groups which acts as a stimulant. Along with cathinone, it is found naturally in &quot;Catha edulis&quot; (khat), and contributes to the overall effects of the plant. Cathine has approximately 7 to 10% of the potency of amphetamine.

==Pharmacology==
Like amphetamines, cathinone and ephedrine, cathine acts as a norepinephrine releasing agent (NRA). It also acts as a dopamine releasing agent (DRA).

==Chemistry==
Cathine is one of the four stereoisomers of phenylpropanolamine (PPA).

==Regulation==
The World Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s list of prohibited substances (used for the Olympic Games among other athletic events) bans cathine in concentrations of over 5 micrograms per milliliter in urine. Cathine is a Schedule III drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In the United States, it is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance.

In Australia, Cathine is officially a schedule 4 drug prescription only, but is not available or approved for any medical use.

In Hong Kong, cathine is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong&#x27;s Chapter 134 &quot;Dangerous Drugs Ordinance&quot;. Unlawful possession is punishable by severe fines and imprisonment.

==Pregnancy==
Ephedra, found in many &quot;Ephedraceae&quot; species, is a Chinese and Western herb that contains, among other amphetamines, -norpseudoephedrine. In the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, which included 18,438 women from 10 states from 1999 to 2003, 1.3% of women reported using ephedra during pregnancy. During the trial, five cases of anencephaly were born to women who used ephedra, however there was no statistically significant association to women not using ephedra (odds ratio 2.8, confidence interval 1.0–7.3).

A small study of 642 participants in Yemen found that among pregnant women who chewed khat (containing -norpseudoephedrine) there was no increased risk of stillbirth or congenital malformations. Among lactating women who chew khat, -norpseudoephedrine is found in breastmilk.

<text>Semyon Mikhailovich Budyonny (; – 26 October 1973) was a Russian and Soviet cavalryman, military commander during the Russian Civil War, Polish–Soviet War and World War II, and politician, who was a close political ally of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.

Born to a poor peasant family from the Don Cossack region in southern Russia, Budyonny was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army in 1903. He served with distinction in a dragoon regiment during the First World War, earning all four classes of the Order of St. George. When the Russian Civil War broke out Budyonny founded the Red Cavalry, which played an important role in the Bolshevik victory; Budyonny became renowned for his bravery and was the subject of several popular patriotic songs. In 1922 he also became commander of all the troops in the north Caucasian military district. While serving as inspector of the Red Army&#x27;s cavalry (1924–37) and commander of the Moscow military district (1937–40). As a political ally of Joseph Stalin, he became one of the original five Marshals of the Soviet Union. He was one of the two most senior army commanders that survived the Great Purge and in post at the time of German invasion of the USSR in 1941. After the Soviet forces under Budyonny&#x27;s command were routed in the battles of Kiev and Uman, he was removed from frontline command. He received the blame for many of Stalin&#x27;s military strategic errors in the early part of World War II, but he was retained in the Soviet high command. In 1953 he resumed his post of inspector of the cavalry.

Budyonny was a staunch proponent of horse cavalry. During the Great Purge, he testified against Mikhail Tukhachevsky&#x27;s efforts to create an independent tank corps, claiming that it was so inferior to cavalry and illogical that it amounted to &quot;wrecking&quot; (sabotage). After being told of the importance of the tank in the coming war in 1939, he remarked, &quot;You won&#x27;t convince me. As soon as war is declared, everyone will shout, &#x27;Send for the Cavalry!

==Early life==
Budyonny was born into a poor peasant family on the Kozyurin farmstead near the town of Salsk in the Don Cossack region of the southern Russian Empire (now Rostov Oblast). Although he grew up in a Cossack region, Budyonny&#x27;s family were ethnic Russians from Voronezh province. He worked as a farm labourer, shop errand boy, blacksmith&#x27;s apprentice, and driver of a steam-driven threshing machine, until the autumn of 1903, when he was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army.

He became a cavalryman reinforcing the 46th Cossack Regiment during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. After the war, he was transferred to the Primorsk Dragoon Regiment. In 1907, he was sent to the Academy for Cavalry Officers in the St. Petersburg Riding School. He graduated first in his class after a year, becoming an instructor with the rank of junior non-commissioned officer. He returned to his regiment as a riding instructor with a rank of senior non-commissioned officer. At the start of World War I, he joined a reserve dragoon cavalry battalion.
== World War I ==
During World War I, Budyonny was the 5th Squadron&#x27;s non-commissioned troop officer in the Christian IX of Denmark 18th Seversky Dragoon Regiment, Caucasian Cavalry Division on the Eastern Front. He became famous for his attack on a German supply column near Brzeziny, and was awarded the St. George Cross, 4th Class. However, there was general ineptitude among the officers under whom he served (primarily Caucasian aristocrats who received commissions based on their social standing).

In November 1916, the Caucasian Cavalry Division was transferred to the Caucasus Front, to fight against the Ottoman Turks. He was involved in a heated confrontation with the squadron sergeant major regarding the officers&#x27; poor treatment of the soldiers and the continual lack of food. The sergeant major struck out at Budyonny, who retaliated by punching the ranking officer, knocking him down. The soldiers backed Budyonny during questioning, claiming that the sergeant major was kicked by a horse. Budyonny was stripped of his St. George Cross, though he could have faced a court martial and death.

Budyonny would go on to be awarded the St. George Cross, 4th class, a second time, during the Battle of Van. He received the St. George Cross, 3rd class, fighting the Turks near Mendelij, on the way to Baghdad. He then received the St. George Cross, 2nd class, for operating behind Turkish lines for 22 days. He received the St. George Cross, 1st class, for capturing a senior non-commissioned officer and six men.

== The Red Cavalry ==

After the February Revolution overthrew the Tsarist regime in 1917, Budyonny was elected chairman of the squadron committee and a member of the regimental committee. When the Caucasian Cavalry Division was moved to Minsk, he was elected chairman of the regimental committee and deputy chairman of the divisional committee.

Returning to Platovskaya, Budyonny was elected deputy chairman of the Stanitsa Soviet of Workers&#x27;, Peasants&#x27;, Cossacks&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies on 12 January 1918. On 18 February, he was elected to be a member of the Salsk District Presidium and head of the District Land Department. On the night of 23 February, Budyonny organized a force of 24 men to retake Platovskaya from the white guards, but was soon joined by a large number of new recruits. By morning, they had freed 400 inhabitants and killed 350 White Russian soldiers. His force now consisted of 520 men, from whom, on 27 February, he formed what was later recognised as the first 120-strong squadron of red cavalry. Eventually he was elected battalion commander.
Budyonny met Stalin and Voroshilov in July 1918. Both supported the idea of creating a cavalry corps to fight on the Bolshevik side in the Russian Civil War; but when Leon Trotsky, the People&#x27;s Commissar for War, visited south Russia soon afterward, he told Budyonny that cavalry was &quot;a very aristocratic family of troops, commanded by princes, barons, and counts.&quot;

Despite Trotsky&#x27;s objections, the 1st Socialist Cavalry Regiment was formed in Tsaritsyn in October 1918, commanded by Boris Dumenko, with Budyonny as deputy commander. Budyonny joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1919. During the summer of 1919, while the Red Cavalry were in action against the White General Anton Denikin, Trotsky described them contempuously as &quot;Budyonny&#x27;s corps — a horde, and Budyonny — their Ataman ring leader...He is today&#x27;s Stenka Razin, and where he leads his gang, there will they go: for the Reds today, tomorrow for the Whites.&quot;

However, in October 1919, Budyonny pulled off a spectacular victory when, in the greatest cavalry battle of the civil war, he attacked and defeated the White army corps commanded by Konstantin Mamontov. On 25 October, Trotsky sent a dispatch forecasting that the White army in the south would never recover from this defeat, and hailing Budyonny as &quot;a true warrior of the workers and peasants&quot;.

==Polish–Soviet War==

When Poland declared independence, there was no agreement between its government and the Soviet authorities over where the border would be. In April 1920, Budyonny&#x27;s cavalry was assigned to driving the Polish army out of Ukraine. On 5 June, he took part in recapturing Kiev, and over the next few days successfully drove the Poles westward. At the start of the war with Poland, he was assigned to the southern front, which Stalin commanded. On 15 August, he asked the commander-in-chief of Soviet forces in Poland, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, for authority to swing north and assist in capturing Warsaw. With Stalin&#x27;s agreement, he attempted to capture Lviv first. Unsuccessful, he eventually diverted to the North but by that time Tukhachevsky&#x27;s forces had been driven back, forcing a general retreat. After Budyonny&#x27;s army was defeated in the Battle of Komarów (one of the biggest cavalry battles in history), he was forced to withdraw onto Soviet-held territory.

Budyonny took part in the reconquest of Crimea, the final phase of the Russian Civil War.

== Reputation ==
Despite the defeat in Poland, Budyonny was one of Soviet Russia&#x27;s military heroes by the end of the Civil War. With Semyon Timoshenko and Kliment Voroshilov he was one of the Cavalry Army clique leaders, and a supporter of Stalin.

In 1920, Soviet songwriter Dmitry Pokrass wrote the song &quot;Budyonny&#x27;s March&quot;, which was one of the first songs to become widely popular throughout the Soviet Union.

The writer Isaac Babel rode with Budyonny&#x27;s cavalry in Poland, and published a series of short stories about the experience, which achieved worldwide acclaim as one of the greatest contributions to Soviet literature – but which offended Budyonny, who made a &quot;rare and furious foray into print&quot; in March 1924, demanding that the Red Cavalry&#x27;s reputation should be protected against &quot;slander&quot; by a &quot;literary degenerate&quot;. This provoked a response from Maxim Gorky, then the most famous living Russian writer, defending Babel, but in 1928, Budyonny returned to the attack in an open letter to Gorky accusing Babel of &quot;crude, deliberate and arrogant slander&quot;, which Gorky said was an &quot;undeserved insult&quot;.

William Reswick, a correspondent for the American agency AP, described a celebration backstage at an opera house around the 10th anniversary of the revolution, at which:

==Later military career==

From 1921 to 1923, Budyonny was deputy commander of the North Caucasian Military District. In 1923, Budyonny arrived in Chechnya with a proclamation from the Central Executive Committee announcing the formation of the Chechen Autonomous Region. The same year, he was also appointed assistant commander of the Red Army&#x27;s cavalry. During 1924–37, he was Inspector of Cavalry of the Red Army. He spent a great amount of time and effort in the organization and management of equestrian facilities and developing new breeds of horses.

Budyonny was considered a courageous and colourful cavalry officer, but displayed disdain for the tools of modern warfare, particularly tanks, which he, along with Grigory Kulik, saw as &quot;incapable of ever replacing cavalry&quot;. This brought him into direct conflict with Tukhachevsky, who was in charge of weapons developed, and foresaw the imminence of mechanized warfare. Even after Tukhachevsky&#x27;s arrest, the Red Army never stopped developing large scale mechanized corps, and each front had numerous such corps attached as a second echelon force by 1940–41, but Budyonny was never criticised for being on the wrong side of the argument, being a faithful ally of Stalin and Voroshilov.

Budyonny graduated from the M. V. Frunze Military Academy in 1932. In 1934, he was made a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

In 1935 Budyonny was made one of the first five Marshals of the Soviet Union. Three of these five were executed in the Great Purge of the late 1930s, leaving only Budyonny and Voroshilov.

== Role in the Great Purge ==
Early in the Great Purge, Budyonny was appointed commander of the Moscow Military District, possibly because Stalin was nervous that there would be a military coup after he had decided to move against two of the most popular Bolsheviks, Nikolai Bukharin and Alexei Rykov. When Bukharin was trying to defend himself, during a plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on 26 February 1937, Budyonny barracked him, calling him a Jesuit.

On 24 May 1937, Budyonny was copied into a resolution proposing to arrest Marshal Tukhachevsky, and the high ranking party official Janis Rudzutaks. He wrote on it: &quot;It&#x27;s necessary to finish off this scum.&quot;

On 11 June, he was one of the judges at the trial of Tukhachevsky and seven other Red Army commanders, whose execution was the start of a massive purge of the Red Army officer corps. At the trial, he provided testimony that Tukhachevsky&#x27;s efforts to create an independent tank corps was so inferior to horse cavalry and so illogical that it amounted to deliberate &quot;wrecking&quot;. Half a century after the trial, the Soviet authorities admitted that all eight defendants were innocent. The &#x27;evidence&#x27; consisted of confessions forced out of them under torture. Two weeks after their execution, Budyonny sent a memo to Voroshilov disclosing that Tukhachevsky initially withdrew his confession, yet Budyonny concluded that all eight were &quot;patented spies ... since 1931, and a few of them even earlier were worming their way into our ranks ever since the beginning of the revolution&quot; .

Later, as the Great Purge continued, the NKVD came to interrogate and arrest Budyonny; Budyonny&#x27;s response was to arm himself with his service Nagant M1895 revolver and call Stalin to demand he have the agents removed. Stalin complied and the event was not discussed again.

By December 1937, Budyonny had been allocated a large &quot;dacha&quot; with orchards, raspberry and gooseberry bushes, a workhorse, a black cow and a pig weighing .

== Second World War service ==
In July–September 1941, Budyonny was Commander-in-Chief (главком, &quot;glavkom&quot;) of the Soviet armed forces of the Southwestern Direction (Southwestern and Southern Fronts) facing the German invasion of Ukraine. This invasion began as part of Germany&#x27;s Operation Barbarossa which was launched on June 22. He also served as an original member of the Stavka of the Supreme High Command, the highest Soviet body of military command during the Great Patriotic War, from the start of the war until February 17, 1945. Operating under strict orders from Stalin (who attempted to micromanage the war in the early stages) not to retreat under any circumstances, Budyonny&#x27;s forces were eventually surrounded during the Battle of Uman and the Battle of Kiev by Nazi forces. The disasters which followed the encirclement cost the Soviet Union 1.5 million men killed or taken prisoner. This was the largest encirclement in military history.

On 13 September 1941, Stalin sacked Budyonny as a scapegoat, replacing him with Semyon Timoshenko. He was never allowed to command troops in combat again. First he was put in charge of the Reserve Front (September–October 1941), then made Commander-in-Chief of the troops in the North Caucasus Direction (April–May, 1942), Commander of the North Caucasus Front (May–August, 1942) - but was removed from this post as the Germans approached, and appointed Cavalry Inspector of the Red Army (from 1943), as well as various honorific posts.

Despite his bravery as a cavalry commander, the view of his fellow officers was that Budyonny was demonstrably incompetent at commanding an army in a mechanized war. Soon after the war, Marshal Konev told the Yugoslav communist, Milovan Đilas: &quot;Budyonny never knew much, and he never studied anything. He showed himself to be completely incompetent and permitted awful mistakes to be made.&quot; German Field Marshal Rundstedt, commander of Army Group South in the battles of Kiev and Uman, said after the war: &quot;Of Budyonny, who commanded the armies facing me, a captured Russian officer aptly remarked — ‘He is a man with a very large moustache, but a very small brain.’&quot;

Because of his exceptional Civil War record and public popularity, he continued to enjoy Stalin&#x27;s patronage and suffered no real punishment for the disaster in Kiev.

==Post-war career==

After the war, Budyonny was appointed deputy Minister of Agriculture of the USSR, responsible, among other things, for horse breeding. When he retired, he retained his membership of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

Budyonny died of brain hemorrhage on 26 October 1973, at the age of 90. He was buried with full military honours in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, in one of the twelve individual tombs located between the Lenin Mausoleum and the Kremlin wall. Pallbearers at his funeral included the General Secretary of the CPSU Leonid Brezhnev and the USSR Minister for Defence, Marshal Grechko.

== Other contributions and legacy ==

Budyonny wrote a five-volume memoir, in which he described the stormy years of civil war as well as the everyday life of the First Cavalry Army. He was frequently commemorated for his bravery in many popular Soviet military songs, including &quot;The Red Cavalry song&quot; (Konarmieyskaya) and &quot;The Budyonny March&quot;. Budenovka, a part of Soviet military uniform, is named after Semyon Budyonny. He was also frequently named in the cavalry-oriented works of Isaac Babel. Babel had originally begun covering Budyonny as a writer for a Soviet newspaper during the Polish–Soviet War.

Budyonny, who was a renowned horse breeder, also created a new horse breed that is still kept in large numbers in Russia: the Budyonny horse, which is famous for its high performance in sports and endurance.

Semyon Budyonny was also an amateur bayan player; a few instrumental vinyl records were issued in the USSR featuring a duo with his friend, cossack bayanist Grigory Zaytsev, titled as &quot;Duo of bayanists&quot; (Дуэт баянистов).

The Military Academy of the Signal Corps in St. Petersburg carries the name of honour S. M. Budyonny.

== Personal life ==
Budyonny&#x27;s first wife was an illiterate Cossack whose forename and patronymic were Nadezhda Ivanovna. They were married in 1903, immediately before he joined the army. He did not see her for seven years. After the Bolshevik revolution, she travelled with the Red Cavalry, organising food and medical supplies. In 1920–23, the couple lived with the Voroshilovs in Yekaterinoslav. They moved to Moscow in 1923.

In 1924, Nadezhda Ivanovna was killed by a gunshot. Her death led to numerous stories. Mikhail Soloviev, a Soviet army officer who settled in the west after being captured early in the German–Soviet War, alleged that Budyonny killed his wife after she had confronted him over his infidelity. Budyonny told his daughter by a subsequent marriage that she shot herself, possibly unintentionally, when their marriage was failing.

In 1925, he married a singer, Olga Stefanovna Mikhailova, who was around half his age, the daughter of a railway worker from Kursk. After their marriage, she entered the Moscow Conservatory, graduating in 1930, then joined the Bolshoi Theatre. According to the Croatian communist, Ante Ciliga, members of the Communist Youth (Komsomol) were so shocked to see him with his new bride at a public banquet, kissing her hands, that they threatened to create a scandal which the party authorities &quot;had to use a very heavy hand to stifle&quot;. Budyonny divorced her before September 1937.

Next, Budyonny married Olga&#x27;s cousin, Maria Vasilevna, a student 33 years his junior, who cooked for him after Olga&#x27;s arrest. This marriage lasted until his death. They had two sons, Sergei, born 1938, and Mikhail, born 1944, and a daughter, Nina, born 1939.

<text>Tarkhan (, or ; ; ; ; ; alternative spellings &quot;Tarkan&quot;, &quot;Tarkhaan&quot;, &quot;Tarqan&quot;, &quot;Tarchan&quot;, &quot;Turxan&quot;, &quot;Tarcan&quot;, &quot;Turgan, Tárkány, Tarján, Tarxan&quot;) is an ancient Central Asian title used by various Turkic, Hungarian, Mongolic, and Iranian peoples. Its use was common among the successors of the Mongol Empire and Turkic Khaganate.

==Etymology==

The origin of the word is not known. Various historians identify the word as either East Iranian (Sogdian or Khotanese Saka) or Turkic.

Although Richard N. Frye reports that the word &quot;was probably foreign to Sogdian&quot;, Gerhard Doerfer points out that even in Turkic languages, its plural is not Turkic (sing. &quot;tarxan&quot; → plur. &quot;tarxat&quot;), suggesting a non-Turkic origin. L. Ligeti comes to the same conclusion, saying that &quot;&quot;tarxan&quot; and &quot;tegin&quot; [prince] form the wholly un-Turkic plurals &quot;tarxat&quot; and &quot;tegit&quot;&quot; and that the word was unknown to medieval western Turkic languages, such as Bulgar. Taking this into consideration, the word may be derived from medieval Mongolian (plural suffix &quot;-at&quot;), itself perhaps derived from the earlier Sogdian word &quot;*&quot; (&#x27;free of taxes&#x27;). A. Alemany gives the additional elaboration that the possibly related East Iranian Scytho-Sarmatian (and Alanic) word &quot;*&quot; still survives in Ossetic (&#x27;argument, trial&#x27;) and (&#x27;to judge&#x27;). Harold Walter Bailey also proposes an Iranian (Khotanese Saka) root for the word, L. Rogers and Edwin G. Pulleyblank argue that the Mongolian word may have actually originated among the Xiongnu, as a pronunciation of the word recorded in Old Chinese as &quot;chanyu&quot;, which Pulleyblank argues may have originally represented a Chinese approximation of &quot;dān-ĥwāĥ&quot; for &quot;*darxan&quot;.

==History==
Tarkhan was used among the Sogdian, Saka, Hephthalite, Turkic, and proto-Mongol peoples of Central Asia and by other Eurasian nomads. It was a high rank in the army of Timur. Tarkhans commanded military contingents (roughly of regimental size under the Turkic Khazars) and were, roughly speaking, generals. They could also be assigned as military governors of conquered regions.

The Göktürks probably adopted the title darqan from the Rourans or Avars. &quot;Oğul Tarqan&quot; (𐰆𐰍𐰞𐱃𐰺𐰴𐰣) and other &quot;tarqat&quot; (𐱃𐰺𐰴𐱃) were mentioned in the Orkhon inscription of Kul Tigin (d. c. 731 CE). They were given high honors such as entering the yurt of the khagan without any prior appointment and shown unusual ninefold pardon to the ninth generation from any crime they committed. Although the etymology of the word is unknown, it is attested under the Khitan people, whose Liao dynasty ruled most of Mongolia and North China from 916 to 1125. G. Clauson argued that Tarqan in Ancient Turkic was considered to be the supreme title and was not even, like Tegin and Shad, peculiar to the royal family, but that it was still a high title, carrying administrative responsibility.

The title has different meanings in different times. In Uyghurs, it meant &#x27;deputy, minister&#x27;. By Oghuz Turks, it meant &#x27;head constable&#x27;.

Like many titles, Tarkhan also occurs as a personal name, independent of a person&#x27;s rank, which makes some historical references confusing. For example, Arabic texts refer to a &quot;Tarkhan, king of the Khazars&quot; as reigning in the mid ninth century. Whether this is a confused reference to a military official or the name of an individual Khazar khagan remains unclear. The name is occasionally used today in Turkish and Arabic speaking countries. It is used as family name in Hungary today.

In the Mongol Empire, the darkhans were exempted from taxation, socage and requisitioning. Genghis Khan made those who helped his rise darkhans in 1206. The families of the darkhans played crucial roles later when the succession crisis occurred in Yuan dynasty and Ilkhanate. Abaqa Khan (1234–82) made an Indian Darkhan after he had led his mother and her team all the way from Central Asia to Persia safely. A wealthy merchant of Persia was made a Darkhan by Ghazan (1271–1304) for his service during the early defeat of the Ilkhan. In Russia, the Khans of the Golden Horde assigned important tasks to the Darkhan. A jarlig of Temür Qutlugh (ca. 1370–1399) authorized rights of the tarkhan of Crimea.

After suppressing the rebellion of the right three tumens in Mongolia, Dayan Khan exempted his soldiers, who participated the battle of Dalan-Terqin, from imposts and made them Darkhan in 1513. Even after the collapse of Northern Yuan dynasty with the death of Ligdan Khan in 1635, the title of darkhan continued to be bestowed on religious dignitaries, sometimes on persons of low birth. For example, in 1665, Erinchin Lobsang Tayiji, the Altan Khan of the Khalkha, bestowed the title on a Russian interpreter and requested the Tsar of Russia to exempt the interpreter from all tax obligations.

A tarkhan of the Arghun dynasty, Muhammad &#x27;Isa Tarkhan, established the Tarkhan dynasty, which ruled Sindh from 1554 to 1591.

All craftsmen held the status of darkhan and were immune to occasional requisitions levied incessantly by passing imperial envoys. From then on, the word referred to craftsmen or blacksmiths in the Mongolian language now and is still used in Mongolia as privilege. People who served the Khagan&#x27;s orda were granted the title of darkhan and their descendants are known as the &quot;darkhad&quot; in Ordos City, Inner Mongolia.

One of the seven Magyar (Hungarian) tribes was called Tarjan () according to Constantin VII&#x27;s De Administrando Imperio, and it is a common geographical name used in many villages and city names.

<doc id="609987" wikidata="Q5593180" url="?curid=609987" title="Graham Richardson">
<text>Graham Frederick Richardson (born 27 September 1949) is an Australian former Labor Party politician who was a Senator for New South Wales from 1983 to 1994 and served as a Cabinet Minister in both the Hawke and Keating governments. He is currently a media commentator, public speaker, and political lobbyist.

During his time in the Senate, Richardson was often referred to as a &quot;power broker&quot; within the Labor Right faction. Prior to entering parliament, Richardson was a Labor Party branch organiser and held the position of General Secretary of the Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch) from 1976 to 1983. Since retiring from politics, Richardson has become a political commentator for Sky News Australia, and previously hosted a weekly commentary program &quot;Richo&quot;.

==Early life==
Richardson, born in Sydney, was the only surviving child of Fred and Peggy Richardson, who were respectively New South Wales State Secretary and office manager of the Amalgamated Postal and Telecommunications Union. Raised as a Catholic, he was influenced as an adolescent by the factional fights that arose during the Labor split. His early years of schooling were at Marist College Kogarah. In November 1965, he was seriously injured in a car accident, in which his father was driving, at Tom Uglys Bridge at Dolls Point, resulting in the removal of his spleen, a torn bowel and 200 stitches to his face. A Catholic priest gave Richardson the last rites on two occasions in hospital. He later recalled:

Nevertheless, Richardson completed his schooling at Sydney Technical High School, where he passed his Leaving Certificate. From 1966, he was active in the Catholic Youth Organisation, a recruiting ground for the right wing of Young Labor, where he formed friendships with Joe Hasham, Bob Scipelliti, and Brian Webb, the latter two acting as silent business partners for Richardson later in life. Motivated by the continued factional fighting impacting on his parents&#x27; life, Richardson joined the Monterey branch of the Labor Party in 1966, aged 17. Having earlier dropped out of an arts degree in 1969, Richardson followed his mother&#x27;s encouragement and commenced studies for a Bachelor of Laws at the University of Sydney. Peggy Richardson died suddenly, aged 42, distracting Richardson from his studies as he threw himself into union and Labor politics.

==Early political career==
Encouraged by a Labor right-wing factional ally, Senator Kerry Sibraa, to seek election for a role as a Labor Party branch organizer in 1971, Richardson was successful, left his university studies, and discovered the powerbrokers in the NSW Right. He apprenticed himself to learn from these men, some of the toughest in the Labor Party, and progressed to become Assistant Secretary of the New South Wales (NSW) Labor Party in 1976 and General Secretary a little later that year, aged 26 – the youngest ever person to hold that role. John Faulkner, of Labor&#x27;s socialist left faction, was Richardson&#x27;s Assistant Secretary and for eight months, so great was their mutual hatred, they did not exchange a word.

===Influence of Daniel Casey===
Marrying Cheryl Gardiner in 1973, Richardson described the rigors of his early married life and union work to &quot;The National Times&quot;&#x27; Alan Ramsey in October 1983: 

Richardson later told the Woodward Royal Commission that in 1973 he met Daniel Casey, a senior figure in Labor right-wing politics, and regarded him as a friend, drank with him at the Sackville Hotel in Rozelle, near Balmain, borrowed $2,000 from him, and paid it back by cheque in two instalments. Again, Ramsay reports Richardson as saying: Then in &#x27;76 I had this huge salary movement which made all these things (the mortgages and such) just not a problem at all.&quot; However, Evan Whitton, a noted journalist and campaigner against organized crime, claims that in May 1977 Richardson&#x27;s wife, Cheryl, went on the payroll, at approximately $130 a week, of Casey&#x27;s Balmain Welding, but did not have to attend at the office. Richardson later told the Woodward Royal Commission, it was the policy of the company not to hire office staff, so they sent the typing out to Mrs Richardson. She kept the job until about May 1979, by which time she was getting about $160 a week from Balmain Welding. Richardson&#x27;s links with Casey were brought to public notice through the reconvening of the Woodward Royal Commission in 1980 due to allegations that Casey had funnelled $20,000, alleged to be a product of gambling and drugs, into NSW Labor. Richardson told the commission on 28 March 1980 that Casey had not donated $20,000 to the Party, and the Commission found no evidence against Casey.

===Numbers man===
In his years working at Labor&#x27;s Sussex St offices, Richardson became renowned for an ability to bring in numbers; he was often referred to as a &quot;numbers man&quot; for the right wing of the NSW branch of Labor. Bill Hayden claimed that Richardson once explained to him: &quot;... all decisions are democratically taken at a meeting of one; me.&quot; Richardson was highly effective in this position and became known as a &quot;king maker&quot;; three years after Richardson became party secretary, Paul Keating became elected unopposed as President of NSW Labor, succeeding John Ducker. Keating is believed to be the youngest President in the history of NSW Labor. Richardson was also instrumental in the 1983 coup that led to Bob Hawke succeeding Hayden as Leader of the Opposition, which ultimately led to Hawke becoming prime minister.

===Enmore branch and factional fights===
During Richardson&#x27;s time as General Secretary, there were significant battles over factional control of a number of inner city Labor branches. Peter Baldwin, a Labor member of the Legislative Council and a member of the socialist-left faction, was bashed by unknown assailants in his home on 16 July 1980. Baldwin had earlier initiated inquiries into &quot;rorts&quot; in the Enmore and other branches. Police began investigation into the assault on Baldwin, and included matters relating to the affairs of the Labor Party Enmore branch. Five people, including Joe Meissner and Tom Domican were charged with various offences. Richardson, in a later interview, confirmed that at the time he wrote to Attorney-General Frank Walker and all other Cabinet Ministers in the Wran Government to ask that the case be dropped on the grounds that it was a Labor Party and not a police matter. Even the Magistrate, was approached. In dismissing the Enmore charges, the Magistrate said: It seems that some force or forces were working improperly to undermine the strength of the prosecution. I am firmly of the opinion that this matter calls for further investigation.&quot;

It was subsequently alleged by Meissner, who was at the time secretary of the Enmore branch of the Labor Party and one of the central figures in the controversy, that the bashing was undertaken by Domican, an underworld figure with close links to the right-wing faction of NSW Labor, acting on suggestions from Richardson. Richardson, claiming that he had been defamed, commenced legal action that was eventually settled out of court in 2007 in Richardson&#x27;s favor.

Richardson groomed his successor for General Secretary, Stephen Loosley who took over in 1983 following Richardson&#x27;s successful nomination for the Senate.

==Parliamentary career==
Richardson was preselected as a candidate for election to the Australian Senate following the retirement of Senator Tony Mulvihill. As the Hawke Labor opposition defeated the Fraser-Anthony Liberal-National coalition, Labor retained its four Senate seats in New South Wales, with Richardson polling the third highest quota at the 1983 federal election. At age 33, he was the youngest ever Senator elected and initially sat on Senate committees on electoral reform, regulations and ordinances, finance and government operations, and estimates in the first term of parliament.

Richardson was re-elected to the Senate at the 1984, 1987, and 1993 federal elections.

===1987–1990===
Following the 1987 federal election, Richardson was appointed Minister for the Environment, a position in the outer ministry in the Third Hawke Ministry. In January 1988, he was elevated to Cabinet. As the Hawke government sought to claim the &#x27;green agenda&#x27; against the growing influence of the Australian Greens and the Wilderness Society, Richardson&#x27;s period as Environment Minister was notable for the Federal Government intervening in Tasmanian state planning issues and blocking the Wesley Vale pulp mill. As Minister for the Environment, Richardson also advocated for and was successful in inscribing the Daintree Rainforest and surrounding areas on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1988, and a protected status for Kakadu National Park, prior to inscribing Stage 2 of Kakadu NP on the World Heritage List in 1987. Some media commentators speculated that Richardson&#x27;s motives for these moves were driven, not by a concern for the environment and heritage of the lands, but by purely political motives:

As Minister for Sport, Richardson oversaw the merging of the Australian Institute of Sport into the Australian Sports Commission.

In 1990, a looming tight election saw Richardson tasked with responsibility to attract second-preference votes from the Australian Democrats and other environmental parties. Richardson claimed this as a major factor in the government&#x27;s narrow re-election in 1990.

===1990–1993===
Richardson felt that the importance of his contribution to Labor&#x27;s victory would automatically entitle him to the ministerial portfolio of his choiceTransport and Communications. He was shocked, however, at what he perceived as Hawke&#x27;s ingratitude in allocating him initially Defence, and then later, Social Security instead.

Prior to Richardson being appointed Social Security Minister, he was offered the post of High Commissioner in London. For some reason Hawke wanted Richardson out of politics altogether.

Richardson vowedin a telephone conversation with Peter Barron, a former Hawke political stafferto do &#x27;whatever it takes&#x27; to &#x27;get&#x27; Hawke. He immediately transferred his allegiance to Keating and subsequently claimed credit for playing a vital role in Keating&#x27;s campaign for the leadership as a numbers man. Interviewed by John Laws a few months following announcement of the Fourth Hawke Ministry, Richardson commented on his new portfolio, feigning interest:
Richardson&#x27;s switch to support Keating helped the latter to become Prime Minister in December 1991. Keating appointed Richardson to his coveted portfolio of Transport and Communications – earning him the nickname, &quot;Minister for Channel Nine&quot; – due to his close relationship with media magnate, Kerry Packer. Keating was content to have Richardson by his side, organizing the Labor Right faction numbers; considering Richardson good in this role, but not necessarily suited to significant office.

In May 1992, Richardson was forced to resign his commission as Minister following revelations that he had used his position and influence to help his cousin by marriage, Gregory Symons. Symons had been arrested in the Marshall Islands for forging government documents relating to a migration scam, and was later subsequently jailed. The event was known as the Marshall Islands affair. A judicial inquiry was necessary to resolve allegations of ministerial impropriety where it was alleged that Richardson attempt to help Symons avoid penalty. Richardson sat out the remainder of this term of parliament on the backbench.

===1993–1994===
Following the 1993 election, Richardson was returned to cabinet in the second Keating Ministry as Minister for Health. In a highly publicized tour, of the Northern Territory and following the Mabo decision and the lodging of Wik claim, Richardson promised to make health care the key components of a new social justice package being negotiated with Aborigines. Richardson went on national television and said that $1.3 billion was needed in new funding and he would deliver it. Keating&#x27;s secretary, Mike Codd, described Richardson during his term as Minister for Health as being &quot;passionate about Aboriginal health. Genuinely passionate. He could have achieved an awful lot in that portfolio, but he had to resign.&quot;

A little under a year later, he assumed additional responsibilities of the Environment, Sport and Territories, following the resignation of Ros Kelly over the sports rorts affair – ironically over the $30m Community Cultural, Recreational and Sporting Facilities Program initiated by Richardson in 1988 when he was Minister for Sport.

Four weeks later, on 25 March 1994, Richardson resigned both positions and retired from parliament, citing ill-health. However, at the same time, allegations were mounting that Richardson was involved in acquiring prostitutes for his personal use, supplied by Robert Burgess and Nick Karlos. Karlos reportedly had been accused of having serious criminal connections; meanwhile Richardson had signed a letter of support on Ministerial letterhead for Burgess which was then used to set up a meeting between Richardson and the senior executive of a US defence company, where Richardson discussed Burgess&#x27; interests. Richardson denied the allegations.

==Post-parliament career==
Richardson is now primarily seen by the Australian public through election night television coverage. He was a political commentator for the Seven Network (having previously appeared on the Nine Network) and broadcaster with 2GB. He has also authored memoirs titled &quot;Whatever it Takes&quot;, published by Bantam Books, Sydney, 1994. For the 2000 Sydney Olympics he was the chairman of the Olympic ticketing operations, Mayor of the Olympic village and had a seat on the Sydney Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (SOCOG).

In 1999, as chairman of the 2000 Sydney Olympics ticketing operations, Richardson oversaw a deal where over 500,000 selected tickets were withheld from the public ticket lottery and reserved for high-paying package-deal customers. This resulted in considerable public criticism at the time and the tickets were eventually made available to the general public.

He has continued a role as a broker in other aspects of NSW public life, including the high-profile contract dispute between the National Rugby League player Sonny Bill Williams and his club, the Canterbury Bulldogs.

===Cash for comment===
Richardson was implicated in the Cash for comment scandal in Australian radio broadcasting, where prominent radio personalities – such as John Laws and Alan Jones – were found to have been promoting certain companies while on the companies&#x27; payroll, while keeping the deal secret from listeners to make it look like the comments were genuine opinion/editorial pieces, or that they had demanded payments from companies in exchange for refraining from making negative comments. Richardson was being paid by Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL), and spruiked for PBL-owned companies Channel 9 and Crown Casino during his radio show.

===Tax evasion===
In 2006, Richardson became embroiled in allegations of tax evasion involving the late Rene Rivkin. On 27 September 2006, Justice James Allsop, of the Federal Court, released a document showing that Richardson had an undeclared Swiss bank account containing $1.4 million. He was one of the shareholders of the Offset Alpine Printing company.

In October 2008, Richardson agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to end his ongoing A$2.3 million dispute with the Australian Taxation Office. The Tax Office took action against Mr Richardson in 2005 after the late stockbroker Rene Rivkin told Swiss investigators that Rivkin, businessman Trevor Kennedy and Richardson were the secret owners of a $27 million stake in Offset Alpine. The Tax Office had sought $700,000 it claimed was owed in unpaid taxes, along with a $1.6 million interest and penalty payment.

=== Political commentator ===
Richardson is now a political commentator for both Channel Seven and Sky News Australia, where he is commonly referred to as &#x27;Richo&#x27;. For Seven, he provides frequent commentary on political issues to Seven News, Sunrise and The Morning Show, as well as co-hosting election night coverage. On Sky News, Richardson was a regular contributor to the channel&#x27;s various panel programs, before being given his own weekly panel show named &quot;Richo&quot; in 2011.

From 2013, Richardson was given a second program on Sky News co-hosting with Alan Jones named &quot;Richo + Jones&quot;. The episode of &quot;Richo + Jones&quot; on 22 April 2014 was the twentieth most watched show on subscription television reaching 39,000 viewers and was the channel&#x27;s second highest broadcast that day. An episode on 17 June, featuring a live interview with Clive Palmer, was the seventeenth most watched show on subscription television and the most watched broadcast on Sky News with 43,000 viewers.

&quot;Richo&quot; finished broadcasting in 2021.

==Health==
Richardson was diagnosed in 1999 with chondrosarcoma, a rare bone cancer, and had five major tumors removed in three operations, the latest in 2012.

Seven months of chemotherapy failed to shrink another tumor on his pelvic wall, and his doctors were concerned that as it became bigger, it could invade his organs. They told him that he required radical surgery, known as pelvic exenteration. Richardson was quoted as saying: &quot;They say it&#x27;s all got to come out – bowel, bladder, prostate, rectum – the lot&quot;.

In April 2016, Richardson temporarily stepped down from his two Sky News programs to undergo major surgery. Weeks after the operation had occurred, it was reported he suffered breathing difficulties and was moved back to the intensive care unit. Richardson returned to Sky News after a two-month post-surgery recovery period, in time to cover the 2016 federal election on 2 July 2016.

<text>Progressive house is a subgenre of house music that emerged in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its evolving, melodic structures, subtle transitions, and layered sound design. Initially rooted in a deeper underground sound, progressive house evolved to gain mainstream appeal by the 2010s, blending with festival styles and incorporating anthemic elements, leading to broader interpretations.

==Etymology==

In the context of popular music the word &quot;progressive&quot; was first used widely in the 1970s to differentiate experimental forms of rock music from mainstream styles. Such music attempted to explore alternate approaches to rock music production. In disco music, and later house music, a similar desire to separate more exploratory styles from standard approaches saw DJs and producers adopting the word &quot;progressive&quot; to make a distinction.

According to DJ and producer Carl Craig, the term &quot;progressive&quot; was used in Detroit in the early 1980s in reference to Italo disco. The music was dubbed &quot;progressive&quot; because it drew upon the influence of Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s Euro disco rather than the disco inspired by the symphonic sound of Philadelphia soul. In Detroit, prior to the emergence of techno, artists like Alexander Robotnick, Klein + M.B.O. and Capricorn filled a vacancy left after disco&#x27;s demise in America. In the late 1980s, UK music journalist Simon Reynolds introduced the term &quot;progressive dance&quot; to describe acts such as 808 State, The Orb, Bomb the Bass and The Shamen. Between 1990 and 1992, the term &quot;progressive&quot; referred to the short-form buzz word for the house music subgenre &quot;progressive house&quot;.

==History==

=== Origins and early development (1990s–2000s) ===
Progressive house emerged after the first wave of house music. The roots of progressive house can be traced back to the early 1990s rave and club scenes in the United Kingdom. The buzz word emerged from the rave scene around 1990 to 1992, describing a new sound of house that broke away from its American roots. In 1992, Mixmag described it at the time as a &quot;new breed of hard but tuneful, banging but thoughtful, uplifting and trancey British house.&quot; A combination of US house, UK house, Italian house, and techno largely influenced one another during this era.

In June 1992, &quot;Mixmag&quot; published a list that contained what the magazine viewed as the top progressive house tracks at that time.

* Leftfield - &quot;Not Forgotten&quot; (Outer Rhythm)
* Slam - &quot;IBO/Eterna&quot; (Soma Quality Recordings)
* React 2 Rhythm - &quot;Whatever You Dream&quot; (Guerilla)
* Soundclash Republic - &quot;Cool Lemon EP&quot; (Junk Rock Records)
* DOP - &quot;Musicians of the Mind EP&quot; (Guerilla)
* Gat Decor - &quot;Passion&quot; (Effective Records)

* The Sandals - &quot;A Profound Gas&quot; (Acid Jazz)
* Herbal Infusion - &quot;The Hunter&quot; (Zoom Records)
* Smells Like Heaven - &quot;Londres Strut&quot; (Deconstruction)
* Spooky - &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot; (Guerilla)
* Andronicus - &quot;Make You Whole&quot; (Hooj Choons)
* Sublime – &quot;Sublime (Breakdown)&quot; (Limbo Records)
According to American DJ/producer duo Gabriel &amp; Dresden, Leftfield&#x27;s October 1990 release &quot;Not Forgotten&quot; was possibly the first progressive house production. The record label Guerilla Records, set up by William Orbit &amp; Dick O&#x27;Dell, is thought to have been pivotal in the growth of a scene around the genre. The 1994 &quot;,&quot; mixed by Sasha and John Digweed, and &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; in 1996 have both been credited with establishing the genre, helping to define its sound and structure. As well as Guerilla Records, the labels Deconstruction Records, Hooj Choons and Soma Records contributed to the scene&#x27;s development in the early to mid 1990s. Among its derivative genres, progressive breaks emerged in the late 1990s as a subgenre of breaks.

In the early 2000s, progressive house evolved by incorporating elements from deep house, tech house, and progressive trance. Pioneering artists such as Sasha, John Digweed, Hernán Cattáneo, and Sander Kleinenberg were instrumental in shaping its sound. This period also saw a convergence with the progressive trance movement, as artists like Deep Dish and Nick Warren infused more ethereal and cinematic elements into their productions. In contrast to this trend, dark progressive house emerged as a deep, hypnotic and atmospheric variant of the genre.

=== Mainstream expansion and stylistic shifts (2010s–present) ===

By the 2010s, the term &quot;progressive house&quot; had broadened significantly, often diverging from its original underground meaning to a more mainstream and festival-oriented productions. This shift was reinforced by electronic music (EDM) charts and industry rankings, particularly &quot;DJ Mag&quot;’s Top 100 DJs list and digital platforms like Beatport, which categorized a wide range of commercially successful tracks under the &quot;progressive house&quot; label. As a result, the genre&#x27;s definition became increasingly ambiguous, with some artists and fans distinguishing between two distinct styles: the classic progressive house sound rooted in the 1990s and the more energetic, big room-influenced style that gained prominence in the 2010s. This new style has been labeled with different terms such as mainstage progressive house, festival progressive house, and big room progressive house to distinguish it from the original genre.

During this period, the emerging style of progressive house gained widespread global popularity, thanks to artists such as Avicii, Swedish House Mafia, Alesso, Nicky Romero, and Martin Garrix. Avicii&#x27;s 2011 hit &quot;Levels&quot; became one of the defining tracks of the era, blending uplifting melodies with festival-ready energy. Similarly, Swedish House Mafia, the group composed by Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso, and Steve Angello, propelled the genre further with &quot;Don&#x27;t You Worry Child&quot; (2012), an anthem that solidified progressive house&#x27;s position in radio-friendly EDM. Swedish music labels Axtone, Refune, and Size played a pivotal role in defining the sound. This era saw progressive house incorporating elements of big room house, a subgenre characterized by simplified structures, heavy drops, and grand, anthemic melodies, which take its roots in electro house. The fusion of these styles contributed to the commercial expansion of the genre, making it a staple at major EDM festivals worldwide. Despite this shift, some artists remained committed to the original ethos, focusing on gradual builds, atmospheric textures, and intricate sound design. Eric Prydz and Deadmau5, for instance, continued to refine and evolve the classic progressive house style, maintaining its connection to trance-influenced roots. &quot;Strobe&quot; by Deadmau5 is a good example, which had been cited by Billboard Dance as the artist&#x27;s all-time best song.

In recent years, after the early 2010s commercial &quot;EDM boom&quot;, underground sounds have regained popularity. Labels like Anjunadeep, Lost &amp; Found, and Sudbeat played a significant role in fostering this new wave of progressive house. These labels, led by artists such as James Grant, Guy J, Hernán Cattáneo focused on rich melodic structures, atmospheric soundscapes, and intricate arrangements, distancing themselves from the &quot;big room&quot; style that had dominated the EDM scene. Furthermore, the new wave of melodic house and melodic techno in the late 2010s and the early 2020s has led to a resurgence in clubs and festivals, blending progressive house with modern electronic textures. This ongoing duality within progressive house reflects its evolution, as the genre continues to exist in both its underground and mainstream forms, catering to different audiences within the electronic music landscape.

==Stylistic elements==
=== Progressive house ===
The progressive house sound of the early 1990s is characterized by a fusion of US house, UK house, Italian house, and techno influences. It features long tracks (typically 8–12 minutes) with evolving structures, subtle transitions, and layered melodies, creating a deep, hypnotic, and atmospheric experience on the dance floor. Intensity is added by the regular addition and subtraction of layers of sound. Phrases are typically 4, 8, or 16 bars long and often begin with a new or different melody or rhythm.

=== Dark progressive house ===
In the early 2000s, dark progressive house emerged as a hypnotic and atmospheric evolution of progressive house, moving away from mainstream trends, characterized by deep basslines, intricate percussion, and dark synths.

=== Mainstage progressive house ===

The 2010s mainstage progressive house style became more structured (4–6 minutes), favoring punchy kicks, bright supersaw leads, and anthemic melodies. Tracks follow a predictable build-break-drop format with massive energy shifts, often designed for festival crowds. The breakdowns were dramatic, leading to euphoric, explosive drops with sidechained synths and heavy reverb, making it more commercially oriented than its 90s counterpart.

<text>Fort Henry was a colonial fort which stood about ¼ mile from the Ohio River in what is now downtown, Wheeling, West Virginia. The fort was originally known as Fort Fincastle and was named for Viscount Fincastle, Lord Dunmore, Royal Governor of Virginia. Later it was renamed for Patrick Henry, and was at the time located in Virginia. The fort was subject to two major sieges, two notable feats (McColloch&#x27;s Leap and Betty Zane&#x27;s trek through the battle) and other skirmishes.

==History==
Built in June 1774, Fort Henry was not erected by any specific plan or design, but was one of a number of similar forts built to protect settlers on the frontier in the middle years of the 1770s. The outbreak of Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War, a conflict between American Indians of the Ohio Country and Virginia, was the immediate reason for its construction.

Construction was supervised by Colonel William Crawford under the orders of the Royal Governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore.

It would appear that the need for a fortified shelter was noticed simultaneously by the residents of the area, and by the military authorities at Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania), in the spring of 1774. John Connolly wrote to the settlers at Zanesburg and urged them to fortify themselves as soon as possible.

Ebenezer Zane and John Caldwell began the fort, which was completed with the help of Captain William Crawford, Colonel Angus McDonald and 400 militia and regulars from Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania). A letter preserved in the Pennsylvania Archives shows that Connolly told Crawford &quot;to proceed to Zanesburg and complete the fort.&quot;

A letter from Lord Dunmore dated June 20, 1774 to Connolly states that Dunmore &quot;entirely [approved] of the measures [Connolly] have taken to build a fort at Wheeling.&quot; Dunmore, then, did not specifically order the fort to be built, but did approve of it. Connolly, according to some accounts, left Fort Pitt with 100 men to help build the fort, but was harassed by a small raiding party of Indians. He returned to Fort Pitt, and then sent out Crawford and McDonald with 400 men.

==Form==
The fort enclosed about and was defended on three sides by the topography. On the south and west (river) sides, the bluff prevented or greatly hindered assaults. On the north, the ravine provided protection. The only level ingress would have been from the east. Zane&#x27;s blockhouse protected the entrance since attackers had to pass by it to attack the fort. They would have been caught in a crossfire between the fort and the blockhouse. All of the recorded attacks on Fort Henry came from the east.

The outer palisade wall was made of timbers, with blockhouses built at each of the four corners. In 1781 a two-story log structure was added near the front gate on which a cannon was mounted.

==American Revolutionary War==
The fort was besieged twice during the American Revolutionary War, once in 1777 and again in 1782.

===First Siege of Fort Henry===

In 1777, Native Americans of the Shawnee, Wyandot and Mingo tribes joined to attack colonial settlements along the Ohio River. Local men later joined by recruits from Fort Shepherd (in Elm Grove) and Fort Holliday defended the fort. The native force subsequently burned the surrounding cabins and destroyed livestock. Major Samuel McColloch led a small force of men from Fort Vanmetre along Short Creek to assist the besieged Fort Henry. McColloch was separated from his men and was chased by attacking Indians. Upon his horse, McColloch charged up Wheeling Hill and made what is known as McColloch&#x27;s Leap down its eastern side to safety. The Indians rushed to the edge, expecting to see the Major lying dead in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the hill. To their great surprise they instead saw McColloch, still mounted on his white horse, galloping away from them.

===Second Siege of Fort Henry===

In 1782, an Indian force along with some Loyalist soldiers attempted to capture Fort Henry. During this siege, Fort Henry&#x27;s supply of ammunition was exhausted. The defenders decided to dispatch one of its men to secure more ammunition from the Zane homestead. Betty Zane volunteered for the dangerous task. During her departing run, she was heckled by both the Indians and Loyalists. Upon successfully reaching the Zane homestead, she gathered a tablecloth and filled it with gunpowder. During her return, she was fired upon but was uninjured. It is believed that one bullet did, in fact, pierce her clothing. As a result of Zane&#x27;s heroism, Fort Henry remained in American control. Numerous other skirmishes took place nearby.

==Disposition==
The fort was dismantled soon after the end of the Revolutionary War, though some parts of it remained standing until 1808. In 1793, General Anthony Wayne built a blockhouse on the site for relay and storage as he moved his troops down the Ohio River prior to his Ohio Country campaign. Today the site is covered by city streets of Wheeling.

Isaacs was born in Glasgow from what were described as &quot;Scottish Jewish roots&quot;. He grew up in Hillhead, the son of a jeweller and a GP, and is a cousin to virologist Alick Isaacs. He was educated at the independent Glasgow Academy and Merton College, Oxford, where he read Classics. Whilst at Oxford he served as President of the Oxford Union. He also served in the Royal Scots Fusiliers.

==Television career==
Isaacs began his career in television when he joined Granada Television in Manchester as a producer in 1958. At Granada he was involved in creating or supervising series such as &quot;World in Action&quot; and &quot;What the Papers Say&quot;. He worked for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; in the 1960s and was the overall producer for the 26-episode series &quot;The World at War&quot; (1973–74) for Thames Television. He was Director of Programmes for Thames between 1974 and 1978. He produced &quot;Ireland: A Television History&quot; (1981) for the BBC and co-produced the twenty-four episode television documentary series &quot;Cold War&quot; (1998) and the ten-part series &quot;Millennium&quot; (1999).

===Channel 4===
Isaacs was the founding chief executive of Channel 4 between 1981 and 1987, overseeing its launch period and setting the channel&#x27;s original cultural approach with opera and foreign language film, although programmes with popular appeal such as the game show &quot;Countdown&quot;, the pop music series &quot;The Tube&quot;, and soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot; had a place in the schedule from the beginning. The channel commissioned Michael Elliott&#x27;s production of &quot;King Lear&quot; (1983) with Laurence Olivier in the title role and Isaacs recommissioned a number of programmes from his time at Granada including &quot;What the Papers Say&quot;. 

Isaacs&#x27; appointment of David Rose, previously long with the BBC, as the Commissioning Editor for Fiction led to the channel&#x27;s involvement with the 1980s revival of the British film industry via the Film on Four strand. Despite a general liberal atmosphere, a few commissioned programmes, such as Ken Loach&#x27;s &quot;A Question of Leadership&quot;, were withdrawn from transmission.

In 1989, Isaacs named 26 personal favourites from his tenure as Channel 4&#x27;s chief executive, running from A (the discussion series &quot;After Dark&quot;) to Z (a four-hour dramatisation of a Gothic horror novel, &quot;Zastrozzi&quot;).

When handing over responsibility for running the channel to Michael Grade, Isaacs threatened to throttle him if he betrayed the trust placed in him to respect the channel&#x27;s remit.

==Later career==
After leaving Channel 4 at the end of 1987, and having failed to be appointed director-general of the BBC, Isaacs became General Director of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, a role he fulfilled until 1996. This was a difficult period for the ROH, which was not helped by the broadcast of the revealing &quot;The House&quot; (1996) documentary series on BBC2. Isaacs also served on the Board of Governors of the British Film Institute in the 1980s.

From 1989 to 1998, Isaacs was the interviewer in a revival of the BBC series &quot;Face to Face&quot;; the former politician and journalist John Freeman had filled this role in the original 1959–62 run.

Between 1997 and 2000, Isaacs was president of the Royal Television Society. He was also chairman of Artsworld before it was sold to Sky.

<text>The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) is an intergovernmental organisation created through an international convention agreed by a current total of 30 European Member States.

EUMETSAT&#x27;s primary objective is to establish, maintain and exploit European systems of operational meteorological satellites. EUMETSAT is responsible for the launch and operation of the satellites and for delivering satellite data to end-users as well as contributing to the operational monitoring of climate and the detection of global climate changes.

The activities of EUMETSAT contribute to a global meteorological satellite observing system coordinated with other space-faring states.

Satellite observations are an essential input to numerical weather prediction systems and also assist the human forecaster in the diagnosis of potentially hazardous weather developments. Of growing importance is the capacity of weather satellites to gather long-term measurements from space in support of climate change studies.

EUMETSAT is not an institution or agency of the European Union, although the majority of its members are EU member states. The organisation became a signatory to the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters in 2012, thus providing for the global charitable use of its space assets.

== Member and cooperating states ==
The national mandatory contributions of member states are proportional to their gross national income. However, the cooperating countries contribute only half of the fee they would pay for full membership. The convention establishing EUMETSAT was opened for signature in 1983 and entered into force on 19 June 1986.

== Satellite programmes ==


There are two types of programmes:

* Geostationary satellites, providing a continuous view of the Earth disc from a stationary position in space.
* Polar-orbiting satellites, flying at a much lower altitude, sending back more precise details about atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles, although with less frequent global coverage.

=== High-level, stationary in space (Geostationary satellites) ===

The current provision of geostationary satellite surveillance is enabled by the Meteosat series of satellites operated by EUMETSAT, generating images of the full Earth disc and data for forecasting.

The first generation of Meteosat, launched in 1977, provided continuous, reliable observations to a large user group. In response to demand for more frequent and comprehensive data, Meteostat Second Generation (MSG) was developed with key improvements in swift recognition and prediction of thunderstorms, fog, and the small depressions which can lead to dangerous wind storms. MSG was launched in 2004. To capture foreseeable user needs up to 2025, a Meteostat Third Generation (MTG) is in active preparation.

=== Low-level orbiting (Polar satellites) ===

==== EUMETSAT Polar System ====

The lack of observational coverage in certain parts of the globe, particularly the Pacific Ocean and continents of the southern hemisphere, has led to the increasingly important role for polar-orbiting satellite data in numerical weather prediction and climate monitoring.

EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) Metop mission consists of three polar orbiting Metop satellites, to be flown successively for more than 14 years. The first, Metop-A, was launched by a Russian Soyuz-2.1a rocket from Baikonur on October 19, 2006, at 22:28 Baikonur time (16:28 UTC). Metop-A was initially controlled by ESOC for the LEOP phase immediately following launch, with control handed over to EUMETSAT 72 hours after lift-off. EUMETSAT&#x27;s first commands to the satellite were sent at 14:04 UTC on October 22, 2006.

The second EPS satellite, Metop-B, was launched from Baikonur on 17 September 2012, and the third, Metop-C, was launched from Centre Spatial Guyanais in Kourou, French Guiana on 7 November 2018 by Arianespace using a Soyuz ST-B launch vehicle with a Fregat-M upper stage.

Positioned at approximately above the Earth, special instruments on board Metop-A can deliver far more precise details about atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles than a geostationary satellite.

The satellites also ensure that the more remote regions of the globe, particularly in Northern Europe as well as the oceans in the Southern hemisphere, are fully covered.

The EPS programme is also the European half of a joint program with NOAA, called the International Joint Polar System (IJPS). NOAA has operated a continuous series of low earth orbiting meteorological satellite since April 1960. Many of the instruments on Metop are also operated on NOAA/POES satellites, providing similar data types across the IJPS.

===== Instruments on Metop =====
* A/DCS (Advanced Data Collection System)
* AMSU-A1 and AMSU-A2
* ASCAT Advanced Scatterometer
* AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer)
* GOME-2 (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment) — instrument to monitor ozone levels
* GRAS (GNSS Receiver for Atmospheric Sounding: global navigation satellite systems radio occultation)
* HIRS (High Resolution Infrared Sounder)
* IASI (Infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer)
* MHS (Microwave Humidity Sounder)
* SARP-3 and SARR (Search And Rescue Processor and Search And Rescue Repeater)
* SEM (Space Environment Monitor, to measure the intensity of the Earth&#x27;s radiation belts and the proton/electron flux.)

==== Jason / Sentinel-6 ====
;Jason-2
The Jason-2 programme is an international partnership across multiple organisations, including EUMETSAT, CNES, and the US agencies NASA and NOAA.
Jason-2 was launched successfully from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a Delta-II rocket on 20 June 2008, 7:46 UTC. EUMETSAT – What We Do – Jason-2 – Launch Description

Jason-2 reliably delivers detailed oceanographic data vital to our understanding of weather forecasting and climate change monitoring. Jason-2 provides data on the decadal (10-yearly) oscillations in large ocean basins, such as the Atlantic Ocean; mesoscale variability, and surface wind and wave conditions. Jason-2 measurements contribute to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) satellite data assimilation, helping improve global atmosphere and ocean forecasting.

Altimetric data from Jason-2 have also helped create detailed decade-long global observations and analyses of the El Niño and La Niña phenomena, opening the way to new discoveries about ocean circulation and its effects on climate, and providing new insights into ocean tides, turbulent ocean eddies and marine gravity.

;Jason-3
Jason-3 was Launched on 17 January 2016, Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 launcher. It is operational since 14 October 2016.
Jason-3 is on a non-Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit at 66° inclination and 1336 km altitude, optimised to eliminate tidal aliasing from sea surface height and mean sea level measurements. Jason-2, flies on the same orbit but at 162°.
It is built on the same cooperation as Jason-2, involving EUMETSAT, NOAA, CNES and NASA, with Copernicus expected to support the European contribution to operations, as part of its HPOA activity, which also covers contributions to the Jason-CS programme.

;Sentinel-6/Jason-CS
The Jason satellites were succeeded by the Sentinel-6 for the radar altimeter mission, part of the European Union&#x27;s Copernicus Programme for Earth observation, with the objective of providing an operational service for high-precision measurements of global sea-level. This mission is implemented as a multi-partner cooperation between the European Commission and EUMETSAT, ESA, NOAA and NASA, with support from the French space agency, CNES.

The mission, implemented through the two Sentinel-6/Jason-CS satellites (Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich and Sentinel-6B), aims to continue high precision ocean altimetry measurements in the 2020–2030 time-frame. A secondary objective is to collect high resolution vertical profiles of temperature, using the GNSS Radio-Occultation sounding technique, to assess temperature changes in the troposphere and stratosphere and to support Numerical Weather Prediction.

The launch of the first satellite – Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich – occurred successfully on 21 November 2020 from Vandenberg AFB in California, USA on a SpaceX Falcon-9 launch vehicle. The satellite was named in honour of Michael Freilich (oceanographer), an oceanographer and former director of NASA&#x27;s Earth Science Division. Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich succeeded Jason-3 as the reference mission for satellite ocean altimetry in April 2022.

The launch of Sentinel-6B is foreseen for late-2025, also on a SpaceX Falcon-9.

<text>George A. Hart (fl. late 20th century) is a physicist and is best known in regard to his regular appearances on the Coast to Coast AM late-night radio talk show, and to a lesser extent for a discovery leading to an improvement of the rare gas halide excimer laser.
Hart specialized in the application of supercomputers to the mathematical modeling of systems exhibiting extremely complex behavior. As a consultant to the Pentagon, he continues to work on the next generation of Strategic Defense Initiative technology.

==Excimer laser==
The first excimer laser was invented in 1970 by Nikolai Basov, yet Dr. Hart continued to take credit for having invented the excimer laser on several occasions from 2012 to 2013 while appearing on the air on the Coast to Coast AM late-night talk show. Five years after its inception and two years after Northrop Corporation Research and Technology Center&#x27;s team leader, Dr. Bhaumik announced the successful demonstration of the world&#x27;s first efficient excimer laser at the Denver, Colorado meeting of the Optical Society of America in May 1973, Hart along with Naval Research Laboratory colleague, Stuart Searles, (also confer Charles Brau, James J. Ewing) invented (and patented) an excimer laser improvement. Hart also had nothing to do with the invention of LASIK, as the first patent was granted by the U.S. Patent Office to Dr. Gholam A. Peyman on June 20, 1989.

==MERLIN Project==

In 1989, Hart began an ongoing collaboration with futurist Paul Guercio which resulted in the creation of The MERLIN Project (Time-Pattern) research. MERLIN, a Fortran-written software program is claimed to be the first scientifically based forecasting technology that combines equations derived from celestial phenomena with past historical data to produce a graphical time-line, or &#x27;timetrak.&#x27; With their progress on the development of the program, Hart and Guercio have been able to predict a number of future events, including the re-election of Barack Obama by July 2012.

&quot;MERLIN was initially developed in the summer of 1989. In the fall of the same year, the collapse of the Honicker government in East Germany and subsequent dissolution of the entire Soviet Union, was MERLIN&#x27;s first and most prescient call to date.&quot;

On Coast To Coast AM, it was admitted that the core working math found in Astrology was at least observed in the process of coming up with the math behind MERLIN. The project&#x27;s similarities with Astrology has led to criticism that Dr. Hart &amp; Mr. Guercio have &#x27;gone to great measures&#x27; to &#x27;disguise and mislead from the fact that they are doing Astrology,&#x27; although there are many technical differences between Astrology and MERLIN. MERLIN does not explicitly forecast events, but rather it can be used to find patterns between concerning time-lines to offer a prediction.

&quot;Based on a starting date (in the case of a person - their birth), the timetraks graph out periods of cyclical intervals, showing peak activity, as well as lulls.&quot;

Claims of &#x27;misleading language&#x27; include that of George Hart &amp; Paul Guercio&#x27;s other websites, where &quot;they imply a connection between the Pentagon and their astrological work on MERLIN,&quot; where George Hart is claimed to be a consultant on an unrelated issue. &quot;On their website, they make the claim that they sent in a white paper. So could anyone. That does NOT mean that the Pentagon values nor pays for their astrological work.&quot;

==Awards==

In 1992, Hart was awarded, along with five colleagues, the RANK Prize &quot;For their discoveries leading to the development of the rare gas halide excimer lasers&quot;.

<doc id="610020" wikidata="Q701383" url="?curid=610020" title="Legend of the Galactic Heroes">
<text>, sometimes abbreviated as LOTGH, LOGH, LGH or in Japanese (and also depicted as Heldensagen vom Kosmosinsel in the anime intro), is a series of epic science fiction novels written by Yoshiki Tanaka. In humanity&#x27;s distant future, two interstellar states – the monarchic Galactic Empire and the democratic Free Planets Alliance – are embroiled in a never-ending war. The story focuses on the exploits of rivals Reinhard von Lohengramm and Yang Wen-li, as they rise to power and fame in the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance, respectively.

An anime adaptation of the novels, produced by Kitty Films, ran from 1988 to 1997. There is also a manga based on the novels, with art by Katsumi Michihara. In addition, there are several video game adaptations, with the most recent release in 2008 being a real-time strategy game. The series did not receive an official English release until 2015, when North American anime and manga distributor Viz Media announced they had acquired the license to the novels. On the same day, North American anime licensor Sentai Filmworks announced their license to the anime; the anime was later released on Hidive in 2017. A new anime adaptation by Production I.G is being released since 2018.

==Setting==
In AD 2801, the Galactic Federation is formed, resulting in political power moving away from the planet Earth (now named Terra) and the Space Era calendar replacing the Gregorian calendar, with 2801 AD now being SE 1. Rudolf von Goldenbaum, an ex-admiral turned dictatorial politician, is elected to power. After declaring himself Emperor Rudolf I, absolute monarch of the renamed Galactic Empire, he restarts the calendar again, beginning the Imperial Calendar on SE 310/AD 3110. His regime adopts extremist policies, including the suppression of any opposition and the extermination of anyone perceived too weak (such as the disabled and the poor), which is carried out until his death in IC 42/SE 351/AD 3151. He also moves the capital of the Empire to the planet Odin, the third planet in the Valhalla system.

In IC 164/SE 473/AD 3273, a group of serfs in the Altair Starzone manage to escape captivity and make &quot;the Long March of 10,000 Light-Years&quot; into the Sagittarius Arm to escape the Galactic Empire, located within the Orion Arm. These people set up the Free Planets Alliance, a democratic republic which uses the Space Era calendar, founding the Alliance in SE 527/IC 218/AD 3327 on the planet Heinessen. In SE 640/IC 331/AD 3440, the first battle between the Empire and Alliance occurs, resulting in a major Alliance victory. The two realms have been at war ever since.

A third realm is also set up, the Dominion of Fezzan, a planet-state (city-state on a galactic scale) with connections to Terra. It technically remains a part of the Empire and pays tribute, but also maintains a relationship with the Alliance. Ruled by a domain lord called the &quot;landsherr&quot;, Fezzan gains power by acting as both paragon and trickster, providing the only link between the Empire and Alliance, while simultaneously playing the two sides against one another.

==Plot==

The story is staged in the distant future within our own Milky Way Galaxy, starting in SE 796/IC 487/AD 3596. A portion of the galaxy is filled with terraformed worlds, inhabited by interstellar traveling human beings. For 150 years, two mighty space powers have intermittently warred with each other: the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance.

Within the Galactic Empire, an ambitious military genius, Reinhard von Müsel, later conferred the name Reinhard von Lohengramm, is rising to power. He is driven by the desire to free his sister Annerose, who was taken by the Kaiser as a concubine. Later, he wants not only to end the corrupt Goldenbaum dynasty, but also to defeat the Free Planets Alliance and unify the whole galaxy under his rule.

In the Free Planets Alliance Star Fleet is another genius, Yang Wen-li. He originally aspired to become a historian through a military academy, and joined the tactical division only out of need for tuition money. He was rapidly promoted to commodore because he demonstrated excellence in military strategy in a number of decisive battles and conflicts. He becomes the arch-rival of Reinhard, though they highly respect one another. Unlike Reinhard, he is better known for his underdog victories and accomplishments in overcoming seemingly impossible odds and mitigating collateral damages and casualties due to military operations.

As a historian, Yang often predicts the motives behind his enemies, narrating the rich history of his world and offering commentary. One of his famous quotes is &quot;There are few wars between good and evil; most are between one good and another good.&quot;

Besides the two main heroes, the story is full of vivid characters and intricate politics. All types of characters – from high nobility, admirals, and politicians, to common soldiers and farmers – are interwoven into the story. The story frequently switches away from the main heroes to the Unknown Soldier fighting for his life on the battlefield.

There is a third neutral power nominally attached to the Galactic Empire, the Fezzan Dominion, a planet-state that trades with both warring powers. There is also a Terraism cult, which believes that humans should go back to Earth, gaining popularity throughout the galaxy. Throughout the story, executive political figures of Fezzan, in concert with the upper-hierarchy of the Terraism cult, orchestrate a number of conspiracies to shift the tide of the galactic war to favor their objectives. The name &quot;Fezzan&quot; is a reference to Fezzan, a region of modern Libya that played an analogous historical role to the one in the anime.

Christopher Farris of the Anime News Network wrote that the novels focus on &quot;personal matters of the main players&quot; instead of being &quot;rote historical accounts&quot;, while the 1988-1997 anime series focuses on &quot;the big picture of the war&quot;, with multiple characters chronicled, and the 2018 series focuses &quot;only on the major plays by our two main actors to fit within its shorter, more focused format.&quot;

==Media==
===Novels===
The series proper is based on a ten-novel series written by Yoshiki Tanaka, as well as a number of other shorter stories set in the same universe, collected in five &quot;Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden&quot; volumes. It won the Seiun Award for &quot;Best Novel of the Year&quot; in 1988. On July 2, 2015, Viz Media had announced that it had licensed the novels for release in North America under their Haikasoru imprint. The company had only initially licensed the first three novels, but stated that it would license more if sales are good. The first novel, &quot;Dawn&quot;, was released on March 8, 2016. The company eventually licensed and released all the novels, and the final volume, &quot;Sunset&quot;, was released on November 19, 2019. The novels were translated by Daniel Huddleston, Tyran Grillo and Matt Treyvaud. First three novels were also released as audiobooks.

===Anime===
====&quot;My Conquest is the Sea of Stars&quot;====
 is the first animated adaptation of Yoshiki Tanaka&#x27;s &quot;Legend of the Galactic Heroes&quot; series of novels. It was originally released in Japan on 6 February 1988. The film chronicles the first combat encounter between Reinhard von Müsel (who later adopted the Lohengramm name) and Yang Wen-li, the two primary protagonists of the series. The main original video animation (OVA) series followed only months later.

====&quot;Legend of the Galactic Heroes&quot;====

 is the second and longest-running animated adaptation of Tanaka&#x27;s series of novels. It was released in direct home video installments during four separate periods between December 1988 and March 1997. The OVA comprises 110 episodes. It was later shown on television and has seen multiple releases on both DVD and Blu-ray formats. It is also known by the (grammatically incorrect) German title Heldensagen vom Kosmosinsel, which is used in its opening credits.

====&quot;Golden Wings&quot;====
 is the third animated adaptation of &quot;Legend of the Galactic Heroes&quot;, adapting the short story of the same name. It was originally released on home video in Japan in October 1992, then released in cinemas in December of that year. Its art style is notable in that it follows the art style of the Katsumi Michihara&#x27;s manga adaptation rather than the other animated works. Its ending theme song is &quot;Futari Mita Yume ~Two of Us~&quot;, performed and composed by Hiroyuki Matsuda, written by Gorou Matsui, and arranged by David Campbell.

====&quot;Overture to a New War&quot;====
 is the fourth animated adaptation of Tanaka&#x27;s novels. It was originally released in Japan on 18 December 1993. It expands upon the events covered in the first two episodes of the 1988 OVA series.

====&quot;Gaiden&quot;====
 is the fifth animated adaptation (counting films) of Tanaka&#x27;s novel series. It was originally released in Japan between February 1998 and July 2000. It served as a prequel to the main series, adapting &quot;Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden&quot;, or side stories, series of novels, (then) uncollected short stories, and also original stories.

Series 1 released from February to September 1998, consisted of adaptations of the short stories &quot;Silver-White Valley&quot;, &quot;Dream of the Morning, Song of Night&quot; and &quot;Disgrace&quot; (later included in the &quot;Golden Wings&quot; collection), and the novel &quot;A Hundred Billion Stars, a Hundred Billion Lights&quot;.

Series 2 released between December 1999 and June 2000, consisted of the adaptations of the novels &quot;Spiral Labyrinth&quot; and part of &quot;The Star Crusher&quot; (&quot;The Third Tiamat Battle&quot;), as well as the original stories &quot;The Mutineer&quot;, &quot;The Duellist&quot;, and &quot;The Retriever&quot;.

====&quot;Die Neue These&quot;====
 started being produced by Production I.G during 2017. Shunsuke Tada directed the series and Noboru Takagi supervised the scripts. Yoko Kikuchi, Iwao Teraoka, and Katsura Tsushima designed the characters. The mecha designs by Naoyuki Kato were drafted by Atsushi Takeuchi, Shinji Usui, and Shinobu Tsuneki. DMM Pictures, Shochiku, and Tokuma Shoten were credited with production of the anime, alongside Production I.G. The anime stars Mamoru Miyano as Reinhard von Lohengramm, Kenichi Suzumura as Yang Wen-li, and Yuichiro Umehara as Siegfried Kircheis. The series premiered from April 3 to June 26, 2018, and ran for 12 episodes. The opening theme is &quot;Binary Star&quot; by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Uru, and the ending theme is &quot;Wish&quot; by Elisa.

A second season, premiered in Japanese theaters as three films, each with four episodes, in 2019. The films premiered on September 27, October 25, and November 29, 2019, respectively. The ending theme for the films is &quot;Tranquility&quot; by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Anly. It was broadcast on TV with a reairing of the first season in 2020.

A third season, premiered in Japanese theaters as a three-part film series in 2022 on March 4, April 1, and May 13, respectively. The opening theme for the films is &quot;dust&quot; by SennaRin, while the ending theme is &quot;melt&quot; by SennaRin.

A fourth season, premiered in Japanese theaters as a three-part film series in 2022 on September 30, October 28, and November 25, respectively.

A fifth season was announced in November 2023.

====English-language release====
An English dub pilot was produced by Outis Productions and Ocean Productions in 1999. The dubbed episodes were the episodes 51 and 52. The dub was never picked up due to a lack of interest.

On 2 July 2015, Sentai Filmworks announced their license to the anime series at their panel at Anime Expo, and later commented that they hoped to create the &quot;definitive release&quot;.

On 20 June 2017, Sentai Filmworks announced the streaming release on Hidive&#x27;s anime streaming service starting the same day.

&quot;Die Neue These&quot; is streamed in North America by Crunchyroll.

===Manga===
The first manga adaptation was authored by Katsumi Michihara, and adapts the first two volumes of the original novel. It was published from 1986 to 2000, and collected in eleven volumes. A four-volume continuation, &quot;Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Portrait of Heroes&quot;, was published from 2006 to 2012 and adapts the third volume of the original novel. This manga story is faithful to the original, possibly more faithful than the OVAs. However, there are some changes that could be considered major, e.g. the gender and ethnicity of Adrian Rubinsky are changed. Akira Kasahara cooperated in drawing mechanics. Michihara also adapted the side story &quot;Golden Wings&quot; into a one-shot manga of the same name in August 1986.

A manga adaptation by Ryu Fujisaki started in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Young Jump&quot; on October 8, 2015. The manga was transferred to &quot;Ultra Jump&quot; on February 19, 2020. Shueisha has compiled its chapters into individual &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes, with the first volume being released on February 19, 2016. As of December 18, 2024, 31 volumes have been published.

=== Games ===
Several video games based on &quot;Legend of the Galactic Heroes&quot; have been released for various platforms, including an online multiplayer strategy game. All of them have been released in Japan whilst some of them have been introduced in the Republic of Korea. Most of these games were published by Bothtec and Tokuma Shoten. A board game was released in 1998. Characters from the series were added to the game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIV as DLC.

===Stage productions===
In 2012, the series was adapted as a musical by the all-female performance troupe Takarazuka Revue.

In February 2014, the most recent stage production of &quot;Legend of the Galactic Heroes&quot; opened, and it ended with an announcement of a new anime adaptation. Tanaka&#x27;s secretary, Hirofumi Adachi, confirmed the news and relayed the producer&#x27;s comments that the new anime is not a remake of the earlier anime, but another anime adaptation of the original novels with a new staff.

==Reception and legacy==
The series received several reviews in English media, years or even decades before its official release.

The English debut of the novel series in 2016 was described as long-awaited and overdue. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; criticized the Daniel Huddleston&#x27;s translation of the first novel, &quot;Dawn&quot;, stating it was &quot;a slog&quot;. The novel as-a-whole was criticized for the &quot;shallow&quot; female characters. Also that year, reviewing the same book for the &quot;Forbes&quot; portal, Ollie Barder was much more positive, noting that the series is &quot;an epic space opera that needs to be read&quot; and &quot;a fascinating novel and essential reading for anyone that enjoys immaculately complex fiction&quot;. Rachel S. Cordasco, reviewing the novel series in &quot;Locus Magazine&quot; in 2020, praised the work as &quot;a remarkable series... a multi-layered, multi-textual work [that] tells different stories on multiple levels&quot;, also observing that it is not just a space opera, but also, an &quot;in-depth historiography&quot; of the future military conflict, comparing it to the 18th-century historical work &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;.

In 2017, the 1988–1997 anime&#x27;s official English release received a number of reviews in the English media. Anne Laurenroth of the Anime News Network gave a positive review, stating that despite its length, it has, arranged well in advance, &quot;one of the most satisfying anime endings ever written&quot;. Daryl Surat, writing for &quot;Otaku Magazine&quot;, called the series &quot;anime&#x27;s greatest sci-fi epic&quot;.

Takumi Sato noted that the character of Reinhard von Lohengramm as depicted in the anime could be related to the &quot;aestheticization of Hitler&#x27;s image&quot;, comparing this phenomenon to similar Japanese works, such as &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;.

The series has been described as &quot;highly influential&quot; in the development of Chinese online literature.

<text>Stephen Roger Bruce (born 31 December 1960) is an English professional football manager and former player who was a centre-back in a twenty-year playing career. He is currently the head coach of EFL League One club Blackpool.

Born in Corbridge, Northumberland, Bruce was a promising schoolboy footballer but was rejected by several professional clubs. He was on the verge of quitting the game altogether when he was offered a trial with Gillingham. He was offered an apprenticeship and went on to play more than 200 games for the club before joining Norwich City in 1984, winning the League Cup in 1985. In 1987, he moved to Manchester United, with whom he achieved great success, winning twelve trophies including three Premier League titles, three FA Cups, one League Cup and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. He also became the first English player of the 20th century to captain a team to the Double. Despite his success on the field, he was never selected to play for the England national team. Commentators and contemporaries have described him as one of the best English players of the 1980s and 1990s never to play for his country at full international level.

Bruce began his managerial career with Sheffield United, and spent short periods of time managing Huddersfield Town, Wigan Athletic and Crystal Palace before joining Birmingham City in 2001. He twice led Birmingham to promotion to the Premier League during his tenure of nearly six years, but resigned in 2007 to begin a second spell as manager of Wigan. At the end of the 2008–09 season, he resigned to take over as manager of Sunderland, a post he held until he was dismissed in November 2011. Seven months later, he was appointed manager of Hull City and led the club to two promotions to the Premier League, as well as the 2014 FA Cup Final, before leaving in July 2016. He took over at Aston Villa four months later but was dismissed in October 2018. He became manager of Sheffield Wednesday in February 2019, and left in July that year to take over at Newcastle United. He managed the club through the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping them in the Premier League, and left in November 2021 following the club&#x27;s takeover by the Public Investment Fund. His final match in charge was his 1,000th in club management. In February 2022, Bruce took over as manager of West Bromwich Albion but was dismissed in October of the same year due to a poor start to the 2022–23 season. He was appointed head coach of Blackpool in September 2024.

==Early life==
Bruce was born in Corbridge in Northumberland, the elder of two sons of Joe and Sheenagh Bruce. His father was local; his mother was a native of Bangor, Northern Ireland. The family lived in Daisy Hill, near Wallsend, and Bruce attended Benfield School.

Bruce, a boyhood fan of Newcastle United, said that he sneaked into St James&#x27; Park without paying to watch the team play, saying &quot;I have always been a Newcastle lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the turnstiles to get in to try and save a bob or whatever it was. They were my team, I went to support them as a boy and being a Geordie it&#x27;s in-bred, you follow the club still the same today.&quot; Like several other future professionals from the area, he played football for Wallsend Boys Club. He was also selected for the Newcastle Schools representative team, and at the age of 13 was among a group of players from that team who were selected to serve as ball boys at the 1974 League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.

Having been turned down by several professional clubs, including Newcastle United, Sunderland, Derby County and Southport, Bruce was about to start work as an apprentice plumber at the Swan Hunter dockyard when he was offered a trial by Third Division club Gillingham, whose manager Gerry Summers had seen him playing for Wallsend in an international youth tournament. He travelled down to Kent with Peter Beardsley, another player from the Wallsend club, but although Gillingham signed Bruce as an apprentice, they turned Beardsley away. At the time, Bruce was playing as a midfielder, but he was switched to the centre of defence by the head of Gillingham&#x27;s youth scheme, Bill Collins, whom Bruce cites as the single biggest influence on his career.

==Playing career==
===Gillingham===
Bruce spent the 1978–79 season in Gillingham&#x27;s reserve team and, despite playing in defence, scored 18 goals to finish the season as top scorer. In January 1979, he was selected to represent the England youth team, and he went on to gain eight caps, participating in the 1980 UEFA European Under-18 Championship. He came close to making his debut for the club&#x27;s senior team in May 1979, but Summers decided at the last minute that, as Gillingham were chasing promotion from the Third Division, Bruce was not yet ready to handle the pressure of the occasion. He eventually made his senior debut in a League Cup tie against Luton Town on 11 August 1979, and made an immediate impact in the team, winning the club&#x27;s Player of the Year award at the end of the 1979–80 season. He went on to make more than 200 appearances for the club, and was twice voted into the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association&#x27;s Third Division Team of the Year.

Confident that he was being targeted by clubs from higher divisions, Bruce resolved not to sign a new contract with Gillingham when his existing deal expired at the end of the 1983–84 season. In an April 1983 match against Newport County, he attempted, in a moment of anger, to deliberately injure opposition player Tommy Tynan, but connected awkwardly and succeeded only in breaking his own leg, leaving him unable to play again for six months. He returned in time to play a key role in Gillingham achieving two draws against Everton in the FA Cup in 1984, attracting the attention once again of scouts from First Division clubs. Arthur Cox, manager of Bruce&#x27;s beloved Newcastle United, expressed an interest in signing the player, but resigned from his job before any further action could be taken. Bruce eventually opted to sign for Norwich City in August 1984 for a fee variously reported as £125,000 or £135,000. In 2009, he was voted into Gillingham&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

===Norwich City===
Bruce began the 1984–85 season by scoring an own goal in the first minute of his debut for Norwich against Liverpool, but went on to score the team&#x27;s winning goal in the semi-final of the League Cup against local rivals Ipswich Town, and was named man of the match in Norwich&#x27;s victory in the final. Bruce was voted Norwich City Player of the Season, but the team was relegated to the Second Division. Bruce played in every match as Norwich won promotion back to the top division at the first time of asking in the 1985–86 season, after which he was chosen to replace the departing Dave Watson as club captain. The following season he helped the club to its highest league finish to date of fifth position.

In 1987, he was chosen to captain the England B team in a match against the full national team of Malta, but it was to be his only appearance in an England shirt, and he has subsequently been described as one of the best defenders of his era never to be selected for the full England team. Bruce later stated, &quot;I bumped into former England manager Bobby Robson in Benfica&quot; (sic)&quot;. He came up to me and said &#x27;I should have capped you&#x27;. It was nice to hear but it still didn&#x27;t get me one ... I&#x27;ll always be a little disappointed I didn&#x27;t get one.&quot;

Bruce began to attract the attention of big-name clubs in late 1987, with Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Rangers all reported to be interested in signing him. Manchester United quickly emerged as the front runners for his signature, and Bruce publicly expressed his desire to sign for the club. The deal came close to collapsing when Norwich asked for a transfer fee of £900,000 after initially agreeing to accept £800,000, leading to Bruce refusing to play any further matches for the club, which he felt was jeopardising his dream move. On 17 December 1987, shortly before his 27th birthday, the deal was concluded and Bruce officially left Carrow Road, for a fee reported as £800,000 or £825,000. Norwich fans remembered his contribution, and in 2002 voted him into the Norwich City Hall of Fame.

===Manchester United===
Bruce made his Manchester United debut in a 2–1 win over Portsmouth on 19 December 1987, and played in 21 of United&#x27;s remaining 22 league fixtures, helping the club to a top-two place in the First Division for the first time since 1980. The team only finished in mid-table in the following season, prompting manager Alex Ferguson to bring in several new players, including Gary Pallister, who joined the club in August 1989 from Middlesbrough. His partnership with Bruce in the centre of defence was described in 2006 by the then-United captain, Gary Neville, as the best in the club&#x27;s history. &quot;Dolly and Daisy&quot;, as the pair were affectionately known, are described as &quot;arguably the best&quot; on the official Manchester United website. Bruce and Pallister were part of the team that won the 1990 FA Cup Final against Crystal Palace in a replay.

Following the lifting of the five-year ban on English clubs from European competitions, which had been imposed after the Heysel Stadium disaster, United became England&#x27;s first entrants into the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in the 1990–91 season. Bruce played regularly, and scored three goals, in the team&#x27;s progress to the final against FC Barcelona. He came close to scoring the first goal, only for Mark Hughes to deflect the ball over the line and claim the goal, and United went on to win the game 2–1. This was a particularly high-scoring season for Bruce, who found the net 13 times in the First Division and 19 times in total in all competitions. He also played again at Wembley, in the League Cup final, in which United were defeated by Sheffield Wednesday of the Second Division.

Bruce missed several weeks of the 1991–92 season when he underwent an operation on a longstanding hernia problem, in which Leeds United, after a season-long tussle, beat Manchester United to the championship by four points. Bruce helped United win their first-ever League Cup in April 1992, captaining the team in the final in place of the injured Bryan Robson. Injuries continued to take their toll upon Robson during the 1992–93 season, leading to Bruce captaining the team in the majority of United&#x27;s matches during the first season of the new Premier League. Bruce scored two late goals in a win over Sheffield Wednesday which proved decisive in United winning the inaugural Premier League title, the first time the club had won the championship of English football since 1967, and he and Robson received the trophy jointly after the home victory over Blackburn Rovers on 3 May.

At the height of his success with United, Bruce was contacted by Jack Charlton, manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, who had discovered that, due to his mother&#x27;s place of birth, Bruce was eligible to play for Ireland. Bruce states in his autobiography that further investigation revealed that, while his earlier appearance for England B in a friendly was not an issue, his appearances for the England Youth team in a UEFA-sanctioned tournament prohibited him from playing for the senior team of another country. He has subsequently claimed that he chose not to play for Ireland as it would have caused problems for his club at a time when UEFA restricted the number of foreign players that a club could have in their squad in its competitions.

United dominated English football in the 1993–94 season, winning a second consecutive Premier League title and then defeating Chelsea in the FA Cup final to become only the fourth team, and Bruce the first English captain, to win the Double in the 20th century, The 1994–95 season was a disappointing one for Bruce and United, as the club failed in its bid to win a third consecutive Premier League title and lost to Everton in the FA Cup final.

During the following season Bruce was offered the job of manager by three clubs, but Ferguson refused to allow him to pursue the opportunities as he felt the player still had a role to play in the United team. Bruce made a further 30 Premier League appearances, as United managed to overcome a 12-point deficit to Newcastle United to win the championship once again. A week later he was left out of United&#x27;s squad for the FA Cup final due to a slight injury. At the end of the match Eric Cantona, who had captained the team and scored the only goal in a 1–0 win over Liverpool, attempted to persuade Bruce to be the one to receive the trophy, but Bruce declined. Ferguson denied that Bruce&#x27;s omission was a sign that his time at the club was nearing an end, but Bruce opted to join First Division club Birmingham City on a free transfer, having signed a contract valued at nearly £2 million over two years, which made him one of the highest-paid players in the country.

===Later playing career===
Bruce was among five former Premier League players signed by Birmingham manager Trevor Francis to add experience to a squad expected to challenge for promotion. He was made captain of the team, but his Birmingham career was dogged by a series of disagreements with Francis. Director David Sullivan felt the need to publicly deny rumours that Bruce was lined up to replace Francis as manager after the club&#x27;s stock market flotation. While playing for Birmingham, Bruce was the subject of several bids from his old Manchester United colleague Bryan Robson to sign for Middlesbrough, but the transfer never happened.

The 1997–98 season saw Bruce being left out more frequently, and his omission against Nottingham Forest provoked a public war of words, which fuelled rumours that the manager was to be dismissed and that Bruce would take over as caretaker until the end of the season. At the end of the season he accepted the post of player-manager of Sheffield United. Though the deal was delayed while Birmingham attempted to negotiate a transfer fee for his playing contract, he took up his new position on 2 July 1998. He played 11 matches for the club before retiring as a player, his final appearance being in a home match against Sunderland on 28 November 1998.

==Style of play==
During the early part of his career, Bruce&#x27;s sometimes over-enthusiastic playing style, which he later described as &quot;rampaging&quot;, caused him disciplinary problems. He later developed into a solid and dependable all-round player, characterised as &quot;an honest trier who made the absolute most of limited natural ability&quot;. In his prime, he was particularly noted for his calm and deliberate passing of the ball, and his ability to control it under pressure, often with his chest. At the time, Mark Wright of Liverpool was said to be the only other centre-back able to match Bruce&#x27;s level of skill in these areas.

Bruce was also known for his unusually high goalscoring rate for a centre-back, resulting from a combination of his ability to powerfully head the ball and his effectiveness in taking penalty kicks. Although lacking poise and grace, and often criticised for his lack of pace, his bravery and willingness to take knocks from opposition players made him the &quot;heart&quot; of the defence during his time with Manchester United. He was well known for continuing to play even when injured, including returning to the United team at short notice in 1992 even though he was awaiting an operation on a hernia. His indomitable spirit and motivational abilities were deemed vital to the United team, and Alex Ferguson has commented on his &quot;determination and heart&quot;.

==Managerial career==
===Early managerial career===
In his first season as a manager, Bruce guided Sheffield United to eighth place in the First Division, nine points away from a place in the play-offs. He caused controversy when he attempted to take his team off the pitch during an FA Cup match against Arsenal. Bruce felt that the Gunners had broken an unwritten rule of sportsmanship by scoring the winning goal from a throw-in instead of returning the ball to United, who had intentionally kicked it out of play to allow an injured player to be attended to. Although the game eventually continued to a finish, following a gesture by Arsenal the match was declared void and replayed. In May 1999, Bruce resigned from his post after just one season in charge, citing turmoil in the club&#x27;s boardroom and a shortage of funds for transfers. He contemplated leaving football for a job in television, but was persuaded by Huddersfield Town owner Barry Rubery to become the club&#x27;s manager.

Huddersfield were early promotion contenders in the 1999–2000 season, winning six consecutive matches to rise to third place in the First Division table by late November, but lost form and failed to reach the play-offs. The team continued to struggle at the start of the 2000–01 season, gaining just six points from 11 matches, and Bruce was sacked in October 2000. He then became involved in a dispute with Rubery, who accused him of &quot;wasting&quot; £3 million on players and having &quot;an ego to feed&quot;. Although he was linked with the manager&#x27;s job at Queens Park Rangers, Bruce remained out of the game until he was appointed manager of Wigan Athletic in April 2001. The team reached the Second Division play-offs but lost in the semi-finals, and Bruce almost immediately left the club, where he had been in charge for less than two months, to take over as manager of Crystal Palace.

Although his new club began the 2001–02 season strongly, topping the First Division table and looking well placed for regaining the Premier League place that it had last held in the 1997–98 season, Bruce tendered his resignation less than three months into the season in order to return to Birmingham City as manager. Although he was initially prevented from doing so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed. By now he had acquired a reputation as a manager who rarely held down a job for a significant length of time.

===Birmingham City===
Upon his arrival, the Blues were in a mid-table position in the First Division, but a lengthy unbeaten run saw the team qualify for the play-offs. The team went on to beat Bruce&#x27;s former club Norwich City in the final after a penalty shoot-out to gain promotion to the Premier League, ending a 16-year absence from the top level of English football. Birmingham spent the early part of the 2002–03 season struggling near the foot of the Premier League table, but Bruce&#x27;s signing of Christophe Dugarry revitalised the team, who ended the season in 13th place and finished higher than local rivals Aston Villa for the first time since the 1970s.

The following season began well for Birmingham, who climbed as high as fourth in the table, but the team&#x27;s fortunes declined and they could only finish in tenth place at the end of the season. Despite this disappointment, Bruce signed a new contract in June 2004 designed to keep him at St Andrew&#x27;s for a further five years, but just two months later Freddy Shepherd, chairman of Newcastle United, was reported to have made Bruce his main target in the search for a new manager to replace Bobby Robson. The club was reportedly prepared to pay Birmingham more than £3 million in compensation, and Bruce himself was said to be keen to take over at St James&#x27; Park, but he ultimately remained at Birmingham. He stated that &quot;as far as I&#x27;m concerned, I&#x27;ve got a job to do [at Birmingham City] and I&#x27;m determined to get on with it&quot;, but it was also reported that Newcastle would have been required to pay a much larger compensation fee or face legal action had he been persuaded to switch clubs. Initial expectations were high for the 2004–05 season, but the club once again finished in a mid-table position, ending the season in 12th place.

Following the sacking of Graeme Souness as Newcastle manager in February 2006, Bruce was again linked with the job, which ultimately went to Glenn Roeder. By this stage of the 2005–06 season, Birmingham were struggling in the league, and on 21 March 2006 were beaten 7–0 at home by Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Some supporters of the club began to call for his resignation, but Bruce insisted that he would fight on as manager. The team managed to climb out of the relegation zone for the first time in nearly six months after a win over Bolton Wanderers in early April 2006. However, they were soon overtaken by Portsmouth, whose victory over Wigan Athletic on 29 April left Birmingham mathematically unable to match their points total and therefore relegated.

Although Bruce had the largest transfer budget in the division made available to him, Birmingham made a slow start to the 2006–07 season in the Championship and, after a 1–0 defeat at home to Norwich City, the team&#x27;s fifth consecutive match without a win, there were calls from fans and local journalists for the manager to be sacked. Bruce publicly accepted responsibility for the team&#x27;s poor run and admitted that he feared for his job, but the team responded with a 1–0 victory over Derby County, and then recorded a further five consecutive league victories to be joint leaders of the league table by late November. On 29 April 2007, Birmingham secured promotion to the Premier League, with one match to play, by virtue of Derby County&#x27;s 2–0 defeat at Crystal Palace. Chairman David Gold told the press &quot;There have been some dark days but Steve has been outstanding. He was determined to bounce back. He has rebuilt the team and now we are all back where we want to be.&quot;

===Wigan Athletic===
In May 2007, Birmingham&#x27;s board agreed a new contract for Bruce, but the unwillingness of the club&#x27;s prospective purchaser Carson Yeung to ratify it left his future uncertain. In October 2007, Bolton Wanderers were refused permission to speak to him about their managerial vacancy.
Later that month, Bruce and Yeung held a meeting which reportedly had positive results. Bruce later claimed that Birmingham&#x27;s managing director Karren Brady had &quot;shafted&quot; him on a new contract with the club, and when Wigan Athletic requested permission to speak to Bruce about their managerial vacancy, he was receptive to their approach. As required under the terms of his contract, Wigan agreed to pay Birmingham a then-world record compensation for the loss of his services of around £3 million, and they were then allowed to speak to him. On 19 November, Wigan announced the signing of Bruce for a second time.

On 21 November, during a press conference which was intended to formally present Bruce as the new manager of Wigan, the club&#x27;s chief executive Brenda Spencer informed the media that the deal had been put on hold by &quot;unknown issues&quot; between Bruce and Birmingham City, reported to centre on the advance payment of the image rights element of Bruce&#x27;s contract at St Andrew&#x27;s. On 23 November 2007 Wigan announced that Bruce had now signed his contract and would officially rejoin the Latics. His first game in charge was a 1–1 home draw with Manchester City on 1 December 2007. Wigan spent the remainder of the season struggling against relegation, but the club secured Premier League survival with victory over Aston Villa in the penultimate game of the season. In September 2008, Bruce was once again linked with the manager&#x27;s job at Newcastle United following the departure of Kevin Keegan.

Bruce led Wigan to an 11th-place finish in the 2008–09 season, despite the loss of midfielder Wilson Palacios to Tottenham Hotspur in the January transfer window.

===Sunderland===
On 27 May 2009, Bruce was reported to have been given permission to talk to Sunderland about succeeding Ricky Sbragia, who resigned as manager after the last match of the season. Bruce was confirmed as the new manager of Sunderland on 3 June after signing a three-year contract. He was joined at Sunderland by three of his former Wigan Athletic coaching staff, assistant Eric Black, goalkeeping coach Nigel Spink, and reserve team coach Keith Bertschin. In his first season at Sunderland, despite a run of 14 games without a win, Bruce led the Black Cats to a 13th-place finish in the Premier League.

Bruce made wholesale changes to Sunderland&#x27;s squad, signing 13 players and selling 15 in his first 18 months at the club. On 25 February 2011, Bruce signed an extension to his contract, keeping him at Sunderland until 2014, with chairman Niall Quinn stating that &quot;In only 18 months he has reshaped our squad beyond recognition, bringing in some fantastically talented players. He embodies the ethos of teamwork and the importance of camaraderie in creating a wonderful spirit of togetherness amongst the players and staff&quot;.

Bruce was dismissed as manager on 30 November 2011, with Sunderland in 16th position following a poor run of form which culminated with a 2–1 home defeat to bottom club Wigan four days earlier. He later linked his dismissal from the managerial post with the fact that he is a fan of Newcastle United, Sunderland&#x27;s bitter rivals.

===Hull City===
On 8 June 2012, Bruce was appointed as manager at Championship club Hull City on a three-year contract. In his first season with the club, he led them to promotion to the Premier League, clinching second place in the Championship on the final day of the season. The following season, the &quot;Tigers&quot; came 16th with a club record tally of 37 points, and reached the final of the FA Cup for the first time. They took a two-goal lead in the first ten minutes of the final, but opponents Arsenal scored a goal in each half to take the game into extra-time and then scored a third to win the trophy. Reaching the final qualified Hull for the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, their first European campaign.

In March 2015, Bruce signed a three-year contract extension. A run of poor form left Hull near the bottom of the table going into the final game of the 2014–15 season and needing to defeat Bruce&#x27;s former club Manchester United to stand any chance of avoiding relegation. They could only manage a 0–0 draw and were relegated to the Championship. The poor performances of a number of players signed by Bruce, including club record signing Abel Hernández, were identified as key factors in the club&#x27;s failure to remain in the Premier League.

In January 2016, Bruce won the Championship Manager of the Month after leading Hull to four victories; Hernández, who scored six times, got the players&#x27; equivalent. Hull finished the season in fourth, qualifying for the play-offs, where they defeated Derby County in the semi-finals. In the final on 28 May, a 25-yard goal from Mohamed Diamé against Sheffield Wednesday won Hull promotion to the Premier League for the second time during Bruce&#x27;s spell in charge. Bruce said after the game that he had considered resignation following the team&#x27;s relegation, and would hold talks with the prospective new owners to be assured of his future. In July 2016, with his future at Hull seemingly still uncertain, he was interviewed by officials of The Football Association concerning the vacant position of manager of England. Three days later, Bruce met with Hull City officials and announced his resignation later that day amid claims he became frustrated by a lack of transfer activity at the club.

===Aston Villa===
On 12 October 2016, Bruce was appointed manager of Championship club Aston Villa. In his second match in charge, Villa defeated Reading, the club&#x27;s first win in 11 games and the first away win for 14 months. He brought in Colin Calderwood as assistant manager from Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Stephen Clemence from old club Hull City as first-team coach. In the 2017–18 season, Villa secured a play-off place and defeated Middlesbrough to reach the final, but lost 1–0 to Fulham in the final and thus missed out on promotion to the Premier League. On 2 October 2018, Villa surrendered a two-goal lead, drawing 3–3 at home to bottom club Preston North End. One spectator threw a cabbage at Bruce and there were calls from home fans on the Holte End for Bruce to go. The following day, he was sacked by Villa after a poor run of form.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
In January 2019, Bruce was appointed manager of Championship club Sheffield Wednesday with effect from the start of the following month. On 27 January, his delay in taking up this appointment was criticised by &quot;Match of the Day&quot; pundits Danny Murphy and Ruud Gullit during a 3–0 FA Cup defeat away to Chelsea. Bruce subsequently defended his decision, as he had had two operations since leaving Aston Villa and needed time to recuperate, as well as the need to recover from the death of both his parents in 2018.

===Newcastle United===
BBC Sport reported in July 2019 that Bruce had resigned from his position at Wednesday, after he earlier admitted that he had held talks with Premier League Newcastle United over their managerial vacancy. His appointment at Newcastle was confirmed on 17 July. Sheffield Wednesday, however, soon filed a report to the Premier League alleging misconduct in his appointment, stating that there were still outstanding legal issues with Bruce having resigned just 48 hours earlier, whilst also suspecting that confidential details of Bruce&#x27;s contract were leaked making it impossible for him to remain at the club. Newcastle United denied any wrongdoing and stated that they were confident no case could be escalated. Reaction from the fans was mixed, with some feeling Bruce would not achieve the standard set by his predecessor Rafael Benítez, whilst his recent lack of Premier League football and management of rival club Sunderland proved controversial. Bruce acknowledged Benítez&#x27;s popularity, and stated he hoped the fans would not rush to judgement and give him time to prove himself. Bruce soon made six signings, notably securing Joelinton from 1899 Hoffenheim for £40 million, breaking the club&#x27;s transfer fee record previously set by the purchase of Miguel Almirón for £21 million six months earlier.

In his first season in charge, Newcastle were tipped for relegation by some pundits but finished 13th, as the campaign was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The following season, almost entirely played behind closed doors due to the ongoing pandemic, saw Bruce guide the club to 12th. In October 2021, the club was bought for £300 million by a consortium led by the Saudi Arabian government&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund. With the team close to the bottom of the Premier League, Bruce was widely expected to be dismissed from his job by the new owners, but remained in charge and was recognised by the League Managers Association as only the 34th manager in the modern era of English football to have taken charge for 1,000 competitive matches. Newcastle lost that match 3–2 to Tottenham Hotspur at St James&#x27; Park on 17 October 2021, and some Newcastle supporters called for Bruce to be removed from his post during and after the game. Bruce left Newcastle by mutual consent three days later on 20 October 2021, after receiving a reported £8 million payout for the remainder of his contract. He had a 27.4% win percentage from 84 league games at Newcastle, the 9th best compared to previous Newcastle managers who had been in charge of at least 20 matches in the Premier League era.

===West Bromwich Albion===
On 3 February 2022, Bruce was appointed manager of EFL Championship club West Bromwich Albion, replacing Valérien Ismaël. Bruce signed an 18-month contract with West Brom who, at the time, were in sixth place in the Championship. He left the role eight months later with the team 22nd in the division, their lowest league position for more than two decades.

=== Blackpool ===
Bruce was appointed head coach of EFL League One team Blackpool on 3 September 2024, replacing Neil Critchley. Following a perfect start to his time in charge, winning his first four matches, he was named EFL League One Manager of the Month for September 2024.

==Life outside football==
===Personal life===
Bruce has been married since February 1983 to Janet (née Smith), who is also from the Hexham area, and went to the same school as Bruce. The couple have two children, Alex (born 1984) and Amy (born 1987). Alex also became a professional footballer, and was signed by his father for Hull City in July 2012. He had previously played under his father&#x27;s management at Birmingham City, but left the club in 2006, in part due to accusations of nepotism levelled at his father. Amy was linked romantically with Aston Villa player Lee Hendrie in tabloid newspaper stories in 2004, which provoked an angry response from her father, who described the reports as &quot;lies&quot;, and claimed that journalists had gone so far as to contact his doctor and examine his household waste in an attempt to uncover gossip. In September 2004, Bruce was involved in an altercation outside his home with two men who were attempting to steal his daughter&#x27;s car. The affray left him with facial injuries but did not prevent him from travelling to a Premier League match the same day. After the incident one newspaper attempted to connect it with the allegations concerning Hendrie, leading Bruce to contemplate legal action.

===Other activities===
Bruce&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Heading for Victory&quot;, was published in 1994. In 1999, while manager of Huddersfield, he wrote a trio of novels: &quot;Striker!&quot;, &quot;Sweeper!&quot; and &quot;Defender!&quot;. The books centred on fictional football manager Steve Barnes, based on Bruce, who solved murder mysteries and thwarted terrorists. Bruce later expressed his embarrassment at the books, which have become sought-after collectables. He intended to publish a new autobiography in late 2019 but the book was postponed indefinitely due to the deaths of his parents and his desire to concentrate on his job at Newcastle.

<text>Admiral John Byng (baptised 29 October 1704 – 14 March 1757) was a Royal Navy officer, politician and colonial administrator who was court-martialled and executed by firing squad. After joining the navy at the age of thirteen, he participated at the Battle of Cape Passaro in 1718. Over the next thirty years he built up a reputation as a solid naval officer and received promotion to vice-admiral in 1747. He also served as Commodore-Governor of Newfoundland Colony in 1742, Commander-in-Chief, Leith, 1745 to 1746 and was a member of Parliament from 1751 until his death.

Byng failed to relieve a besieged British garrison during the Battle of Minorca at the beginning of the Seven Years&#x27; War. He had sailed for Minorca at the head of a hastily assembled fleet of vessels, some of which were in poor condition. In the ensuing battle with a French Royal Navy off the Minorcan coast, he was defeated and the fleet under his command considerably damaged. He then elected to withdraw to Gibraltar to repair his ships. Upon return to Britain, Byng was court-martialled and found guilty of failing to &quot;do his utmost&quot; to prevent Minorca from falling to the French. He was sentenced to death and, after pleas for clemency were denied, was shot dead by a firing squad on 14 March 1757.

== Origins ==
John Byng was born at Southill Park in the parish of Southhill in Bedfordshire, England, the fourth son of Rear-Admiral Sir George Byng. His father had supported King William III in his successful bid to be crowned King of England in 1689 and had seen his own stature and fortune grow.

George Byng was a highly skilled naval commander, had won distinction in a series of battles, and was held in esteem by the monarchs whom he served. In 1721, he was rewarded by King George I with a viscountcy, being created Viscount Torrington.

== Career ==
John Byng entered the Royal Navy in March 1718, aged 13, when his father was a well-established admiral at the peak of a uniformly successful career. Early in his career, Byng was assigned to a series of Mediterranean postings. In 1723, aged 19, he was promoted lieutenant and, at 23, rose to become captain of . His Mediterranean service continued until 1739 without much action.

In 1742 he was appointed Commodore-Governor of the British colony of Newfoundland. He was promoted to rear-admiral in 1745 and appointed Commander-in-Chief, Leith, a post he held until 1746. Byng, stationed off Scotland, thwarted the resupply of Bonnie Prince Charlie&#x27;s forces during the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. The admiral also assisted the Duke of Cumberland in Britain&#x27;s crackdown after the Battle of Culloden. He was promoted to vice-admiral in 1747 and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. He served as a Member of Parliament for Rochester from 1751 until his death.

=== Wrotham Park ===

Having purchased a large estate in Hertfordshire, in 1754 Byng commissioned the building within it of Wrotham Park, a Palladian mansion (sited within the present-day bounds of Potters Bar). It is doubtful that he ever lived there. Byng never married and the house was left to a brother&#x27;s eldest son, a descendant of whom still owns it.

=== Battle of Minorca ===

The island of Minorca had been a British possession since 1708, when it was captured during the War of the Spanish Succession. On the approach of the Seven Years&#x27; War, numerous British diplomats based in the Mediterranean raised the alarm that Minorca was threatened by a French naval attack from Toulon. Since 1748, British downsizing of the Royal Navy meant that only three ships-of-the-line were assigned to protect trading interests in the Mediterranean by 1755. The &quot;London Evening Post&quot; had reported as far back as April 1755 that Toulon was outfitting twelve brand new &quot;men of war&quot;. Lord George Anson, head of the Admiralty, chose to focus instead on preventing a French invasion, keeping warships close to Britain.

Byng was given orders to raise a fleet on 11 March 1756, with only six of ten assigned ships present in Portsmouth, and all of them severely undermanned. Byng&#x27;s orders were multiplex, his first target being the alleged new French fleet at Toulon, while the British garrison of Fort St Philip at Port Mahon was a secondary concern.

Despite his protests, he was not given enough money or time to prepare the expedition properly. His fleet was delayed in Portsmouth for over a month, and he was ordered by the Admiralty Office to outfit other Channel ships ahead of his own fleet. Additionally, half of his assigned ships were in disrepair or missing. When the pulled into Portsmouth, for example, the warship was missing its fore and main topmast.

By 6 April, still short of over 800 men, Byng set sail from Portsmouth using Colonel Robert Bertie&#x27;s fusiliers in place of sailors. While he was en route, the French Toulon fleet, on 17 April 1756, escorted over 1,000 tartanes and transport ships landing 15,000 troops under the command of General Richelieu at Ciutadella, on the far west end of Minorca.

Byng arrived at Gibraltar and was told of the French landing. Remarkably, General Thomas Fowke, then in command at Gibraltar, held a war council and refused to supply him with a regiment of marines, as ordered by the War Office. Further, naval facilities at Gibraltar were dilapidated.

Byng wrote a letter to the Admiralty Office, explaining the situation as dire. Many military historians have interpreted that dispatch as Byng preparing for failure and that he did not believe that the garrison could hold out against the French force. Without marines to land, and with only fusiliers to lend to the garrison (which would render his fleet once again severely undermanned), Byng nonetheless took his fleet to Minorca to assess the situation for himself.

Byng sailed on 8 May 1756. On 19 May, Byng&#x27;s fleet appeared off of Port Mahon, and he endeavoured to open communications with the fort. The French squadron appeared before he could open up a line of communication with any fort officer, however.

The Battle of Minorca was fought on the following day. Byng had gained the weather gage, which both forces had attempted to gain. However, the two fleets were not parallel with one another. Byng called for a lasking manoeuvre, meaning that all his ships would turn in unison and, with the wind behind them, sail straight toward the enemy bow first. But Captain Thomas Andrews of the &quot;Defiance&quot;, the lead ship due to the angled approach, did not steer directly for the first French ship in the enemy&#x27;s line, but instead steered a parallel course. The , , and followed the example set by the &quot;Defiance&quot;. It took two cannon shots from Byng&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Ramillies&quot;, and some ten to fifteen minutes for the admiral to redirect the lasking. But by this time, the French admiral had ordered his ships to pull more sail and lead away from the attempted lasking. This delay cost Byng the element of surprise, and it also allowed the French to make the rest of the battle a &quot;running fight&quot;, as Captain Augustus Hervey later called it.

Because of the angle, the leading van took the brunt of the damage. The last ship in that squadron, the , was heavily damaged, losing three of its masts, including the main. The next three ships, the &quot;Revenge&quot;, and &quot;Trident&quot;, did not pass the now listing &quot;Intrepid&quot; to keep the sanctity of the battle line. Instead, those ships nearly collided with one another, with Captain Frederick Cornwall of the &quot;Revenge&quot; eventually navigating his ship between the &quot;Intrepid&quot; and the enemy.

Byng&#x27;s battle line was broken. It cost him twenty to thirty minutes to reform the line, and once the line was reformed, the French pulled full sail and expediently pulled away. Byng was told by Captain Arthur Gardiner, his flag captain, that he could set full sail for the enemy, thus providing an example to the three bottled-up ships on what to do. He declined, recalling that Admiral Thomas Mathews had been dismissed for doing so at the Battle of Toulon in 1744. After four to four and a half hours, neither side had lost a ship in the engagement, and casualties were roughly even, with 43 British sailors killed and 168 wounded, against French losses of 38 killed and 175 wounded.

Byng remained near Minorca for four days without establishing communication with the fort or sighting the French. On 24 May, he called a war council of his own where, by unanimous voting, the fleet would return to Gibraltar for repairs, succour, sailors and more marines for the garrison. The fleet arrived at Gibraltar on 19 June, where they were reinforced with four more ships of the line and a 50-gun frigate. Repairs were effected to the damaged vessels and additional water and provisions were loaded aboard. But, before his fleet could return to sea, another ship arrived from England with further instructions, relieving Byng, Fowke and several others of their command and ordering a return to home.

On arrival in England, Byng was placed in custody. The garrison resisted the Siege of Fort St Philip until 29 June, when it was forced to capitulate.

=== Fallout after Minorca ===
News of the Battle of Minorca&#x27;s outcome was wanting. The Newcastle ministry had suffered military setbacks elsewhere in the British Empire; George Washington&#x27;s defeat at Fort Necessity at the hands of the French and Indians, Edward Braddock&#x27;s army&#x27;s losses in Pennsylvania, the siege of Fort Oswego, and the renewal of the Carnatic Wars in India, with the fall of Calcutta. Domestically, conditions were also horrid: food riots had broken out, beginning in the Midlands, spreading to Wales to the south and as far north as Glasgow. Another failure would challenge Newcastle&#x27;s hold on power. Indeed, in the wake of publication of the battle, George II was flooded with petitions and addresses to investigate the government&#x27;s poor handling of a whole host of issues.

When news of the Battle of Minorca did arrive, it was via a Spanish diplomat, who carried a dispatch from the French admiral, Byng&#x27;s counterpart, Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissonière. Without any word from Byng, or any other naval or army officer attached to his fleet, ministers chose to recall several officers, Byng included. It would be another 20 days before Byng&#x27;s version of the battle arrived in London. By then, however, ministers had chosen a course of action detrimental to Byng. 

On 26 June 1756, the government newspaper, &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, printed an edited version of Byng&#x27;s report removing passages and rewording others to make the admiral appear a coward. Protest against Byng began with effigy burnings mostly in port cities throughout England and one as far away as Boston, Massachusetts.

Newcastle also received his share of odium. In a letter to Robert Craggs-Nugent, the First Minister wrote,
I have touched upon a Ticklish Point... I thought it not fair, to lay the Loss expressly upon Byng, Tho&#x27; there it will, &amp; must be laid, &amp; there only.

Even prior to the battle, George Bubb Dodington informed Henry Fox that ministers had already chosen a scapegoat in case events in the Mediterranean went astray. Clearly the government had chosen Byng to take the fall for their neglect of the Mediterranean theatre.

== Court-martial ==
Byng&#x27;s perceived failure to relieve the garrison at Minorca caused public outrage among fellow officers and the country at large. Byng was brought home to be tried by court-martial for breach of the Articles of War which had been revised eleven years prior to mandate capital punishment for officers who did not do their utmost against the enemy, either in battle or pursuit.

The revision followed an event in 1745 during the War of the Austrian Succession, when a young lieutenant named Baker Phillips had been court-martialled and shot after his ship was captured by the French. His captain had done nothing in order to prepare the vessel for action and was killed almost immediately by a broadside. Taking command, the inexperienced junior officer had been forced to surrender the ship when she could no longer be defended. The negligent behaviour of Phillips&#x27;s captain was noted by the subsequent court-martial and a recommendation for mercy was entered, but Phillips&#x27;s sentence was approved by the Lords Justices of Appeal.

This sentence angered some in parliament, who felt that an officer of higher rank would likely have been spared or else given a lighter punishment and that Phillips had been executed because he had been a powerless junior officer and thus a useful scapegoat. The Articles of War were amended to become one law for all: the death penalty for any officer of any rank who did not do his utmost against the enemy in battle or pursuit.

Byng&#x27;s court-martial was convened on 28 December 1756 aboard the elderly 96-gun vessel HMS &quot;St George&quot;, which was anchored in Portsmouth Harbour. The presiding officer was Admiral Thomas Smith, supported by rear admirals Francis Holburne, Harry Norris and Thomas Broderick, and a panel of nine captains. The verdict was delivered four weeks later on 27 January 1757, in the form of a series of resolutions describing the course of Byng&#x27;s expedition to Minorca and an interpretation of his actions.

The court acquitted Byng of personal cowardice. However, its principal findings were that Byng had failed to keep his fleet together while engaging the French; that his flagship had opened fire at too great a distance to have any effect; and that he should have proceeded to the immediate relief of Minorca rather than returning to Gibraltar. As a consequence of these actions, the court held that Byng had &quot;not done his utmost&quot; to engage or destroy the enemy, thereby breaching the 12th Article of War.

Once the court determined that Byng had &quot;failed to do his utmost&quot;, it had no discretion over punishment under the Articles of War. In accordance with those Articles the court condemned Byng to death, but unanimously recommended that the Lords of the Admiralty ask King George II to exercise his royal prerogative of mercy.

=== Death warrant ===
It fell to Admiral John Forbes, in his role as Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty, to sign Byng&#x27;s death warrant. This he refused to do, believing the sentence to be illegal, instead attaching to the warrant a document explaining his refusal. A copy of the document, believed to be Forbes&#x27; draft, on three sheets of paper, is in the archives of the Society of Genealogists. Another copy, signed &quot;J.F. 16 February 1757&quot;, is in the Senate House Library at the University of London. It was also published as a broadside.

== Clemency denied and execution ==

First Lord of the Admiralty Richard Grenville-Temple was granted an audience with George II, to request clemency, but this was refused in an angry exchange. Four members of the board of the court-martial petitioned Parliament, seeking to be relieved from their oath of secrecy to speak on Byng&#x27;s behalf. The Commons passed a measure allowing this, but the Lords rejected the proposal.

Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder was aware that the Admiralty was at least partly to blame for the loss at Minorca due to the poor manning and repair of the fleet. The Duke of Newcastle, the politician responsible, had by now joined the Prime Minister in an uneasy political coalition and this made it difficult for Pitt to contest the court-martial&#x27;s verdict as strongly as he would have liked. He did, however, petition the King to commute the death sentence. The appeal was refused; Pitt and the king were political opponents, with Pitt having pressed for George to relinquish his hereditary position of Elector of Hanover as being a conflict of interest with the government&#x27;s policies in Europe.

The severity of the penalty, combined with suspicion that the Admiralty had sought to protect themselves from public anger over the defeat by throwing all the blame on the admiral, led to a reaction in favour of Byng in both the Navy and the country, which had previously demanded retribution. Pitt, then Leader of the House of Commons, told the King: &quot;the House of Commons, Sir, is inclined to mercy&quot;, to which George responded: &quot;You have taught me to look for the sense of my people elsewhere than in the House of Commons.&quot;

The King did not exercise his prerogative to grant clemency. Following the court-martial and pronouncement of sentence, Byng was detained aboard in the Solent and, on 14 March 1757, he was taken to the quarterdeck for execution in the presence of all hands and men from other ships of the fleet in boats surrounding &quot;Monarch&quot;. The admiral knelt on a cushion and signified his readiness by dropping his handkerchief, whereupon a squad of Marines shot him dead.

== Burial and succession ==
He is buried in the Byng Mausoleum in All Saints&#x27; Church in Southill, Bedfordshire, built for the burial of his father. He died unmarried, so having left no children he bequeathed his estates, including Wrotham Park, to one of his younger nephews, George Byng (c. 1735–1789), the eldest son of his next elder brother Robert Byng (1703–1740), Governor of Barbados, who had died 17 years before the admiral&#x27;s death. (His eldest surviving nephew, George Byng, 4th Viscount Torrington, had already inherited the grand paternal mansion and estate at Southill Park.) In 2018, the estate and house, largely unchanged, remained the home and property of George Byng&#x27;s descendant (via a female line) Robert Michael Julian Wentworth Byng (born 1962), the grandson of Lady Elizabeth Alice Byng (born 1897), briefly the wife of Michael Lafone, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Edmund Henry Byng, 6th Earl of Strafford (1861–1951).

== Legacy ==
Byng&#x27;s execution was satirised by Voltaire in his novel &quot;Candide&quot;. In Portsmouth, Candide witnesses the execution of an officer by firing squad and is told that &quot;in this country, it is good to kill an admiral from time to time to encourage the others&quot; &quot;(Dans ce pays-ci, il est bon de tuer de temps en temps un amiral pour encourager les autres)&quot;.

Byng was the last of his rank to be executed in this fashion and, 22 years after the event, the Articles of War were amended to allow &quot;such other punishment as the nature and degree of the offence shall be found to deserve&quot; as an alternative to capital punishment.

In 2007, some descendants of the Byng family petitioned the government for a posthumous pardon. The Ministry of Defence refused. Members of his family continue to seek a pardon, along with a group at Southill in Bedfordshire where the Byng family lived.

Byng&#x27;s execution has been called &quot;the worst legalistic crime in the nation&#x27;s annals&quot;. Some defend the policy, however; naval historian N. A. M. Rodger believes it may have influenced the behaviour of later naval officers by helping inculcate:
a culture of aggressive determination which set British officers apart from their foreign contemporaries, and which in time gave them a steadily mounting psychological ascendancy. More and more in the course of the century, and for long afterwards, British officers encountered opponents who expected to be attacked, and more than half expected to be beaten, so that [the latter] went into action with an invisible disadvantage which no amount of personal courage or numerical strength could entirely make up for.

Such policy considerations were no comfort to the family of their victim. Warren Tute said &quot;far from encouraging anyone at all, this judicial murder had the opposite effect&quot;.
Admiral Byng was buried in the Byng vault at the Church of All Saints in Southill, Bedfordshire. His epitaph there expresses their view:

<text>In statistics, consistency of procedures, such as computing confidence intervals or conducting hypothesis tests, is a desired property of their behaviour as the number of items in the data set to which they are applied increases indefinitely. In particular, consistency requires that as the dataset size increases, the outcome of the procedure approaches the correct outcome.
Use of the term in statistics derives from Sir Ronald Fisher in 1922.

Use of the terms &quot;consistency&quot; and &quot;consistent&quot; in statistics is restricted to cases where essentially the same procedure can be applied to any number of data items. In complicated applications of statistics, there may be several ways in which the number of data items may grow. For example, records for rainfall within an area might increase in three ways: records for additional time periods; records for additional sites with a fixed area; records for extra sites obtained by extending the size of the area. In such cases, the property of consistency may be limited to one or more of the possible ways a sample size can grow.

==Estimators==

A consistent estimator is one for which, when the estimate is considered as a random variable indexed by the number &quot;n&quot; of items in the data set, as &quot;n&quot; increases the estimates converge in probability to the value that the estimator is designed to estimate.

An estimator that has Fisher consistency is one for which, if the estimator were applied to the entire population rather than a sample, the true value of the estimated parameter would be obtained.

==Tests==

A consistent test is one for which the power of the test for a fixed untrue hypothesis increases to one as the number of data items increases.

==Classification==
In statistical classification, a consistent classifier is one for which the probability of correct classification, given a training set, approaches, as the size of the training set increases, the best probability theoretically possible if the population distributions were fully known.

== Relationship to unbiasedness ==
An estimator or test may be consistent without being unbiased. A classic example is the sample standard deviation which is a biased estimator, but converges to the expected standard deviation almost surely by the law of large numbers. Phrased otherwise, unbiasedness is not a requirement for consistency, so biased estimators and tests may be used in practice with the expectation that the outcomes are reliable, especially when the sample size is large (recall the definition of consistency). In contrast, an estimator or test which is not consistent may be difficult to justify in practice, since gathering additional data does not have the asymptotic guarantee of improving the quality of the outcome.

<doc id="610029" wikidata="Q746983" url="?curid=610029" title="Dunnottar Castle">
<text>Dunnottar Castle (, &quot;fort on the shelving slope&quot;) is a ruined medieval fortress located upon a rocky headland on the northeast coast of Scotland, about south of Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire. 

The surviving buildings are largely of the 15th and 16th centuries, but the site is believed to have been fortified in the Early Middle Ages. Dunnottar has played a prominent role in the history of Scotland through to the 18th-century Jacobite risings because of its strategic location and defensive strength.

Dunnottar is best known as the place where the Honours of Scotland, the Scottish crown jewels, were hidden from Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s invading army in the 17th century. The property of the Keiths from the 14th century, and the seat of the Earl Marischal, Dunnottar declined after the last Earl forfeited his titles by taking part in the Jacobite rebellion of 1715. The castle was restored in the 20th century and is now open to the public.

The ruins of the castle are spread over , surrounded by steep cliffs that drop to the North Sea, below. A narrow strip of land joins the headland to the mainland, along which a steep path leads up to the gatehouse. The various buildings within the castle include the 14th-century tower house as well as the 16th-century palace. Dunnottar Castle is a scheduled monument, and twelve structures on the site were listed buildings.

==History==
===Early Middle Ages===
A chapel at Dunnottar is said to have been founded by St Ninian in the 5th century, although it is not clear when the site was first fortified, but in any case the legend is late and highly implausible. Possibly the earliest written reference to the site is found in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; which record two sieges of &#x27;Dún Foither&#x27; in 681 and 694. The earlier event has been interpreted as an attack by Brude, the Pictish king of Fortriu, to extend his power over the north-east coast of Scotland. The &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; records that King Donald II of Scotland, the first ruler to be called &quot;rí Alban&quot; (King of Alba), was killed at Dunnottar during an attack by Vikings in 900. The English king Æthelstan led a force into Scotland in 934, and raided as far north as Dunnottar according to the account of Symeon of Durham.

W. D. Simpson speculated that a motte might lie under the present castle, but excavations in the 1980s failed to uncover substantive evidence of early medieval fortification. The discovery of a group of Pictish stones at Dunnicaer, a nearby sea stack, has prompted speculation that Dún Foither was actually located on the adjacent headland of Bowduns, to the north.

===Later Middle Ages===
During the reign of King William the Lion (ruled 1165–1214), Dunnottar was a centre of local administration for The Mearns. The castle is named in the &quot;Roman de Fergus&quot;, an early 13th-century Arthurian romance, in which the hero Fergus must travel to Dunnottar to retrieve a magic shield. In May 1276, a church on the site was consecrated by William Wishart, Bishop of St Andrews. The poet Blind Harry relates that William Wallace captured Dunnottar from the English in 1297, during the Wars of Scottish Independence. He is said to have imprisoned 4,000 English prisoners of war in the church and burned them alive.

In 1336, Edward III of England ordered William Sinclair, 8th Baron of Roslin, to sail eight ships to the partially ruined Dunnottar for the purpose of rebuilding and fortifying the site as a forward resupply base for his northern campaign. Sinclair took with him 160 soldiers, horses, and a corps of masons and carpenters. Edward himself visited in July, but the English efforts were undone before the end of the year when the Scottish Regent Sir Andrew Murray led a force that captured and again destroyed the defences of Dunnottar.

In the 14th century, Dunnottar was granted to William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland (d.1370); in 1346, a licence to crenellate was issued by David II. Around 1359, William Keith, Marischal of Scotland, married Margaret Fraser, niece of Robert the Bruce, and was granted the barony of Dunnottar at this time. Keith then gave the lands of Dunnottar to his daughter Christian and son-in-law William Lindsay of Byres, but in 1392 an excambion (exchange) was agreed whereby Keith regained Dunnottar and Lindsay took lands in Fife. William Keith completed construction of the tower house at Dunnottar, but was excommunicated for building on the consecrated ground associated with the parish church. Keith had provided a new parish church closer to Stonehaven, but was forced to write to the Pope, Benedict XIII, who issued a bull in 1395 lifting the excommunication. William Keith&#x27;s descendants were made Earls Marischal in the mid 15th century, and they held Dunottar until the 18th century.

===16th-century rebuilding===

James IV came to Dunnottar on 15 October 1504. A child played a musical instrument called a monochord for him, and he gave money to poor people. The king had brought his Italian minstrels and an African drummer, known as the &quot;More taubronar&quot;.

Through the 16th century, the Keiths improved and expanded their principal seats: at Dunnottar and also at Keith Marischal in East Lothian. James IV visited Dunnottar in 1504, and in 1531 James V exempted the Earl&#x27;s men from military service on the grounds that Dunnottar was one of the &quot;principall strenthis of our realme&quot;. Mary, Queen of Scots, visited in 1562 after the Battle of Corrichie, and returned in 1564. James VI stayed for 10 days in 1580, as part of his through Fife and Angus, during which a meeting of the Privy Council was convened at Dunnottar. 

King James came again on 17 April 1589 and spent the night at Cowie watching for the Catholic rebel earls of Huntly and Erroll. During the rebellion of Catholic nobles in 1592, Dunnottar was captured by Captain Carr on behalf of the Earl of Huntly, but was restored to Lord Marischal just a few weeks later.

In 1581, George Keith succeeded as 5th Earl Marischal, and began a large-scale reconstruction that saw the medieval fortress converted into a more comfortable home. As the founder of Marischal College in Aberdeen, the 5th Earl valued Dunnottar as much for its dramatic situation as for its security. A &quot;palace&quot; comprising a series of ranges around a quadrangle was built on the north-eastern cliffs, creating luxurious living quarters with sea views. The 13th-century chapel was restored and incorporated into the quadrangle. An impressive stone gatehouse was constructed, now known as Benholm&#x27;s Lodging, featuring numerous gun ports facing the approach. Although impressive, these are likely to have been fashionable embellishments rather than genuine defensive features. The earl had a suite of &#x27;Samson&#x27; tapestries which may have represented his religious outlook.

===Civil wars===


In 1639, William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal, came out in support of the Covenanters, a Presbyterian movement who opposed the established Episcopal Church and the changes which Charles I was attempting to impose. With James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, he marched against the Catholic James Gordon, 2nd Viscount Aboyne, Earl of Huntly, and defeated an attempt by the Royalists to seize Stonehaven. However, when Montrose changed sides to the Royalists and marched north, Marischal remained in Dunnottar, even when given command of the area by Parliament, and even when Montrose burned Stonehaven.

Marischal then joined with the Engager faction, who had made a deal with the king, and led a troop of horse to the Battle of Preston (1648) in support of the royalists. Following the execution of Charles I in 1649, the Engagers gave their allegiance to his son and heir. Charles II was proclaimed king, arriving in Scotland in June 1650. He visited Dunnottar in July 1650, but his presence in Scotland prompted Oliver Cromwell to lead a force into Scotland, defeating the Scots at Dunbar in September 1650.

===Honours of Scotland===
Charles II was crowned at Scone Palace on 1 January 1651, at which the Honours of Scotland (the regalia of crown, sword and sceptre) were used. However, with Cromwell&#x27;s troops in Lothian, the honours could not be returned to Edinburgh. The Earl Marischal, as Marischal of Scotland, had formal responsibility for the honours, and in June the Privy Council duly decided to place them at Dunnottar. They were brought to the castle by Katherine Drummond, hidden in sacks of wool. Sir George Ogilvie (or Ogilvy) of Barras was appointed lieutenant-governor of the castle, and given responsibility for its defence.

In November 1651, Cromwell&#x27;s troops called on Ogilvie to surrender, but he refused. During the subsequent blockade of the castle, the removal of the Honours of Scotland was planned by Elizabeth Douglas, wife of Sir George Ogilvie, and Christian Fletcher, wife of James Granger, minister of Kinneff Parish Church. The king&#x27;s papers were first removed from the castle by Anne Lindsay, a kinswoman of Elizabeth Douglas, who walked through the besieging force with the papers sewn into her clothes. Two stories exist regarding the removal of the honours themselves. Fletcher stated in 1664 that over the course of three visits to the castle in February and March 1652, she carried away the crown, sceptre, sword and sword case hidden amongst sacks of goods. Another account, given in the 18th century by a tutor to the Earl Marischal, records that the honours were lowered from the castle onto the beach, where they were collected by Fletcher&#x27;s servant and carried off in a creel (basket) of seaweed. Having smuggled the honours from the castle, Fletcher and her husband buried them under the floor of the Old Kirk at Kinneff.

By May 1652 the commander of the blockade, Colonel Thomas Morgan, had taken delivery of the artillery necessary for the reduction of Dunnottar. Ogilvie surrendered on 24 May, on condition that the garrison could go free. Finding the honours gone, the Cromwellians imprisoned Ogilvie and his wife in the castle until the following year, when a false story was put about suggesting that the honours had been taken overseas. Much of the castle property was removed, including twenty-one brass cannons, and Marischal was required to sell further lands and possessions to pay fines imposed by Cromwell&#x27;s government.

At the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the honours were removed from Kinneff Church and returned to the king. Ogilvie quarrelled with Marischal&#x27;s mother over who would take credit for saving the honours, though he was eventually rewarded with a baronetcy. Fletcher was awarded 2,000 merks by Parliament but the sum was never paid.

===Whigs and Jacobites===
Religious and political conflicts continued to be played out at Dunnottar through the 17th and early 18th centuries. In 1685, during the rebellion of the Earl of Argyll against the new king James VII, 167 Covenanters were seized and held in a cellar at Dunnottar. The prisoners included 122 men and 45 women associated with the Whigs, an anti-Royalist group within the Covenanter movement, and had refused to take an oath of allegiance to the new king. The Whigs were imprisoned from May 24 until late July. A group of 25 escaped, although two of these were killed in a fall from the cliffs, and another 15 were recaptured. Five prisoners died in the vault, and 37 of the Whigs were released after taking the oath of allegiance. The remaining prisoners were transported to Perth Amboy, New Jersey, as part of a colonisation scheme devised by George Scot of Pitlochie. Many, like Scot himself, died on the voyage. The cellar, located beneath the &quot;King&#x27;s Bedroom&quot; in the 16th-century castle buildings, has since become known as the &quot;Whigs&#x27; Vault&quot;.

Both the Jacobites (supporters of the exiled Stuarts) and the Hanoverians (supporters of George I and his descendants) used Dunnottar Castle. In 1689, during Viscount Dundee&#x27;s campaign in support of the deposed James VII, the castle was garrisoned for William III and Mary II with Lord Marischal appointed captain. Seventeen suspected Jacobites from Aberdeen were seized and held in the fortress for around three weeks, including George Liddell, professor of mathematics at Marischal College. In the Jacobite Rising of 1715 George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal, took an active role with the rebels, leading cavalry at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. After the subsequent abandonment of the rising Lord Marischal fled to the Continent, eventually becoming French ambassador for Frederick the Great of Prussia. Meanwhile, in 1716, his titles and estates including Dunnottar were declared to the crown.

===Later history===

The seized estates of the Earl Marischal were purchased in 1720 for £41,172, by the York Buildings Company who dismantled much of the castle. In 1761, the Earl briefly returned to Scotland and bought back Dunnottar only to sell it five years later to Alexander Keith (1736–1819), an Edinburgh lawyer who served as Knight Marischal of Scotland. Dunnottar was held by Alexander Keith and then his son, Sir Alexander Keith (1768–1832) before being inherited in 1852 by Sir Patrick Keith-Murray of Ochtertyre, who in turn sold it in July 1873 to Major Alexander Innes of Cowie and Raemoir for about £80,000. It was purchased by Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray, in 1925, after which his wife embarked on a programme of repairs. Since that time, the castle has remained in the family, and has been open to the public, attracting 52,500 visitors in 2009, and over 135,000 visitors in 2019.

Dunnottar Castle, and the headland on which is stands, was designated as a Scheduled monument in 1970.
In 1972, twelve of the structures at Dunnottar were listed. Three buildings were listed at category A as being of &quot;national importance&quot;: the keep; the entrance gateway; and Benholm&#x27;s Lodging. The remaining listings were at category B as being of &quot;regional importance&quot;. However, in 2018, the listed status for those buildings was removed as part of Historic Environment Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Dual Designation 2A Project&quot;.

The Hon. Charles Anthony Pearson, the younger son of the 3rd Viscount Cowdray, currently owns and runs Dunnottar Castle which is part of the Dunecht Estates. Portions of the 1990 film &quot;Hamlet&quot;, starring Mel Gibson and Glenn Close, were shot there. In the Disney movie &quot;Brave&quot;, Dunnottar Castle was chosen for Merida&#x27;s home.


==Description==
Dunnottar&#x27;s strategic location allowed its owners to control the coastal terrace between the North Sea cliffs and the hills of the Mounth, inland, which enabled access to and from the north-east of Scotland. The site is accessed via a steep, footpath (with modern staircases) from a car park on the coastal road, or via a cliff-top path from Stonehaven.

Dunnottar&#x27;s several buildings, put up between the 13th and 17th centuries, are arranged across a headland covering around . The dominant building, viewed from the land approach, is the 14th-century keep or tower house. The other principal buildings are the gatehouse; the chapel; and the 16th-century &quot;palace&quot; which incorporates the &quot;Whigs&#x27; Vault&quot;.

===Defences===
The approach to the castle is overlooked by outworks on the &quot;Fiddle Head&quot;, a promontory on the western side of the headland. The entrance is through the well-defended main gate, set in a curtain wall which entirely blocks a cleft in the rocky cliffs. The gate has a portcullis and has been partly blocked up. Alongside the main gate is the 16th-century Benholm&#x27;s Lodging, a five-storey building cut into the rock, which incorporated a prison with apartments above. Three tiers of gun ports face outwards from the lower floors of Benholm&#x27;s Lodging, while inside the main gate, a group of four gun ports face the entrance. The entrance passage then turns sharply to the left, running underground through two tunnels to emerge near the tower house.

Simpson contends that these defences are &quot;without exception the strongest in Scotland&quot;, although later writers have doubted the effectiveness of the gun ports. Cruden notes that the alignment of the gun ports in Benholm&#x27;s Lodging, facing across the approach rather than along, means that they are of limited efficiency. The practicality of the gun ports facing the entrance has also been questioned, though an inventory of 1612 records that four brass cannons were placed here.

A second access to the castle leads up from a rocky cove, the aperture to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a small boat could be brought. From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff-top, which in turn offers access to the castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward. A small sentry box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.

===Tower house and surrounding buildings===
The late 14th-century tower house has a stone-vaulted basement, and originally had three further storeys and a garret above. Measuring , the tower house stood high to its gable. The principal rooms included a great hall and a private chamber for the lord, with bedrooms upstairs. Beside the tower house is a storehouse, and a blacksmith&#x27;s forge with a large chimney. A stable block is ranged along the southern edge of the headland. Nearby is Waterton&#x27;s Lodging, also known as the Priest&#x27;s House, built around 1574, possibly for the use of William Keith (died 1580), son of the 4th Earl Marischal. This small self-contained house includes a hall and kitchen at ground level, with private chambers above, and has a projecting spiral stair on the north side. It is named for Thomas Forbes of Waterton, an attendant of the 7th Earl.

===Palace===
The palace, to the north-east of the headland, was built in the late 16th century and early to mid-17th century. It comprises three main wings set out around a quadrangle, and for the most part is probably the work of the 5th Earl Marischal who succeeded in 1581. It provided extensive and comfortable accommodation to replace the rooms in the tower house. In its long, low design it has been compared to contemporary English buildings, in contrast to the Scottish tradition of taller towers still prevalent in the 16th century.

Seven identical lodgings are arranged along the west range, each opening onto the quadrangle and including windows and fireplaces. Above the lodgings of the west range comprised a gallery. Now roofless, the gallery originally had an elaborate oak ceiling, and on display was a Roman tablet taken from the Antonine Wall. At the north end of the gallery was a drawing room linked to the north range. The gallery could also be accessed from the Silver House to the south, which incorporated a broad stairway with a treasury above.

The basement of the north range incorporates kitchens and stores, with a dining room and great chamber above. At ground floor level is the Water Gate, between the north and west ranges, which gives access to the postern on the northern cliffs. The east and north ranges are linked via a rectangular stair. The east range has a larder, brewhouse and bakery at ground level, with a suite of apartments for the countess above. A north-east wing contains the Earl&#x27;s apartments, and includes the &quot;King&#x27;s Bedroom&quot; in which Charles II stayed. In this room is a carved stone inscribed with the arms of the 7th Earl and his wife, and the date 1645. Below these rooms is the Whigs&#x27; Vault, a cellar measuring . This cellar, in which the Covenanters were held in 1685, has a large eastern window, as well as a lower vault accessed via a trapdoor in the floor. Of the chambers in the palace, only the dining room and the Silver House remain roofed, having been restored in the 1920s.

The central area contains a circular cistern or fish pond, across and deep, and a bowling green is located to the west. At the south-east corner of the quadrangle is the chapel, consecrated in 1276 and largely rebuilt in the 16th century. Medieval walling and two 13th-century windows remain, and there is a graveyard to the south.

<text>Passy () is an area of Paris, France, located in the 16th arrondissement, on the Right Bank. It is adjacent to Auteuil to the southwest, and Chaillot to the northeast.

It is home to many of the city&#x27;s wealthiest residents, hence its informal grouping in the Neuilly-Auteuil-Passy area. Many embassies are based in Passy.

==History==
===Early history===


The earliest mentions of Passy appears in the mention of a lease in villenage in 1250 by members of the Congregation of France. The Château de Passy (no longer existing) had been built in 1381, later renamed to Château de Boulainvilliers in 1747. During the 14th century, King Charles V of France authorized Passy&#x27;s inhabitants to enclose walls around their fields, and a century later in 1416, Passy became a Lordship. In 1658, hot mineral springs were discovered near what is now Rue des Eaux where spa facilities were developed. This attracted Parisian society and English visitors, some of whom made the area, which combined attractive countryside with both modest houses and fine residences, their winter retreat, as it was located between Paris and the Chateau de Versailles. It was dependent on the parish of Auteuil until 1761. Anne Gabriel Henri Bernard de Boulainvilliers was the last lord of Passy, after he sold it to escape the guillotine.

===Benjamin Franklin in Passy===

The Hôtel de Valentinois (at that time the property of Monsieur de Chaumont) in Passy was the home of Benjamin Franklin during the nine years that he lived in France during the American Revolutionary War, when he represented American interests and sought French support for American independence.

Franklin established a small printing press in his lodgings to print pamphlets and other material as part of his mandate to maintain French support for the revolution. He called it the Passy Press. Among his printing projects, he produced comics he called &quot;Bagatelles&quot; and passports. He developed a typeface known as &quot;le Franklin&quot;. He also printed a 1782 treatise by Pierre-André Gargaz titled &quot;A Project of Universal and Perpetual Peace&quot;, which laid out a vision for maintaining a permanent peace in Europe. It proposed a central governing council composed of representatives of all the nations of Europe to arbitrate international disputes.

He also worked on his scientific projects at a laboratory he shared with others, which had been installed by Louis XV in the Château de la Muette.

When Franklin returned to America, the new American Ambassador to France, Thomas Jefferson, wrote: &quot;When he left Passy, it seemed as if the village had lost its patriarch.&quot; To this day, a street in Passy bears the name Rue Benjamin Franklin.

===After the French Revolution===

After the French Revolution, Passy became a commune of Seine. The population was 2,400 in 1836, 4,545 in 1841, but larger in summer. In 1861 the population was 11,431. Passy&#x27;s population was 17,594 when it was absorbed into Paris along with several other communities in 1860.

====Artists of Passy====

The painting Albert Gleizes painting &quot;Les ponts de Paris (Passy), The Bridges of Paris (Passy)&quot;, housed in the collection of the Museum Moderner Kunst (mumok), Vienna, refers to the spirit of solidarity among the newly formed &quot;Artists of Passy&quot;, during a time when factions had begun to develop within Cubism. &quot;Les Artistes de Passy&quot; consisted of a diverse grouping of avant-garde artistes (painters, sculptors and poets), including several who previously held meetings in 1910 at the rue Visconti studio of Henri Le Fauconnier. Their first diner presided over by neo-symbolist Paul Fort was held at the house of Balzac, rue Raynouard, in the presence of Guillaume Apollinaire, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marie Laurencin, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, André Mare, Jean Metzinger, Francis Picabia, Henry Valensi, and Jacques Villon. Albert Gleizes chose Passy as the subject of this painting.

==Landmarks==
Passy is home to the Musée Marmottan Monet, housed in the Château de la Muette, and the Jardin du Ranelagh park. It is served by the Ranelagh metro station.

There is now a &quot;rue Benjamin Franklin&quot; and a &quot;square de Yorktown&quot; near the Trocadéro.

A lively street in the area is Rue de Passy, which goes from La Muette to the Place de Costa Rica just behind the Trocadéro. It has boutiques and chain stores along its length.

The Cimetière de Passy, located at 2, rue du Commandant Schœlsing, is the burial place for many well-known persons including American silent film star Pearl White, the painters Édouard Manet and Berthe Morisot, and composer Claude Debussy.

Honoré de Balzac lived in Passy for over six years, and his house is now a museum (Maison de Balzac).

The apartment in which Marlon Brando trysts with Maria Schneider in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; was located in Passy.

Notre-Dame-de-Grace de Passy, the church where Brigitte Bardot married Roger Vadim in 1952.

<text>Maria Philomena Potter (3 January 1925 – 7 April 2004), known as Maureen Potter, was an Irish singer, actress, comedienne and performer.

==Early life==
Potter was born in Dublin and educated at St. Mary&#x27;s school in Fairview. She had a long career in Irish theatre, mainly as Ireland&#x27;s première comedienne, but also as a straight actress. She was a regular performer at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin and for many years starred in Christmas pantomime. She became the first star to have a bronze cast of her handprints outside the theatre. She married Jack O&#x27;Leary in 1959, an Irish army officer whom she had first met in 1943, and he wrote most of her comedic material.

=== Career ===
Among Potter&#x27;s many dramatic roles in the theatre was that of Maisie Madigan in &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot;. While still a teenager, she toured abroad before World War II as a singer and dancer with Jack Hylton (known as Jack Haylton and his orchestra). On a tour of Germany, they once performed in front of Adolf Hitler and other Nazis. In January 1938, Potter appeared on the BBC Television Service with Jack Hylton and his Band. Film of her performance is held by the Alexandra Palace Television Society. In 2001, the Archivist of the Alexandra Palace Television Society gave Potter a copy of her 1938 television appearance, and she recalled her memories:&quot;&quot;I was 13 years of age when I appeared with the Jack Hylton Band in RadiOlympia, a programme that went out on television all those years ago. What I remember most is the heavy ochre make-up the performers had to wear. I was excused the make-up for some reason; maybe mine was such a long shot that it was not deemed necessary. If you blink you miss me! However, June Malo, the Henderson Twins, Peggy Dell, Bruce Trent and Freddie Schweitzer had this heavy ochre make-up plastered on them. Plastered is the only word! Having toured with them for over 12-months and used to seeing them in stage make-up they looked very strange. Mr Hylton was excused also. He was always Mr Hylton to me. He called me &quot;Morine&quot;, (the American pronunciation, and was a kind man who made such a difference to my career. He always wore those two-tone shoes that were so popular at the time. It is wonderful to see him so trim and dapper in the tape, which Simon Vaughan has sent me.&quot;&quot;Potter first appeared professionally with Jimmy O&#x27;Dea in pantomime and appeared frequently on television and in cabaret. She played the role of Dante Riordan in Joseph Strick&#x27;s film, &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; (1977).
In the 1970s, Potter appeared alongside puppets in adverts for Jacob&#x27;s &quot;Mikado&quot;, &quot;Kimberley&quot; and &quot;Coconut Cream&quot; biscuits, with the line &quot;Someone you love would love some mum&quot;.

== Later life and death ==

Potter was conferred with the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1984, and was later awarded an honorary degree from Trinity College Dublin in 1988. She died in her sleep at her home in Clontarf on 7 April 2004, at the age of 79. She was survived by her husband, Jack O&#x27;Leary and her sons, John and Hugh.

==Advertising==
In the late 1970s she advertised Jacob&#x27;s biscuits.

<doc id="610038" wikidata="Q5473816" url="?curid=610038" title="Crown land">
<text>Crown land, also known as royal domain, is a territorial area belonging to the monarch, who personifies the Crown. It is the equivalent of an entailed estate and passes with the monarchy, being inseparable from it. Today, in Commonwealth realms, crown land is considered public land and is apart from the monarch&#x27;s private estate.

==Australia==

In Australia, public lands without a specific tenure (e.g. National Park or State Forest) are referred to as Crown land or State Land, which is described as being held in the &quot;right of the Crown&quot; of either an individual State or the Commonwealth of Australia (as Australia is a federation, there is no single &quot;Crown&quot; as legal entity). Most Crown lands in Australia are held by the Crown in the right of a State. The only land held by the Commonwealth consists of land in the Northern Territory (surrendered by South Australia), the Australian Capital Territory, Jervis Bay Territory, and small areas acquired for airports, defence and other government purposes.

Each jurisdiction has its own policies towards the sale and use of Crown lands within the State. For example, New South Wales, where over half of all land is Crown land, passed a controversial reform in 2005 requiring Crown lands to be rated at market value. Crown lands include land set aside for various government or public purposes, development, town planning, as well as vacant land. Crown lands comprise around 23% of Australian land, of which the largest single category is vacant land, comprising 12.5% of the land.

Crown land is used for such things as airports, military grounds (Commonwealth), public utilities (usually State), or is sometimes unallocated and reserved for future development.

In Tasmania, Crown land is managed under the &quot;Crown Lands Act 1976&quot;. In Queensland, Unallocated State Land is managed under the &quot;Land Act 1994&quot;. In South Australia, the relevant Act is the &quot;Crown Land Management Act 2009&quot;. In Victoria, it is the &quot;Crown Land (Reserves) Act 1978&quot; and the &quot;Land Act 1958&quot;.

==Austria==
From the late 18th century onwards, the territories acquired by the Austrian Habsburg monarchy were called crown lands (). Initially ruled in personal union by the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, they played a vital role as constituent lands of the Habsburg nation-building and were ultimately reorganised as administrative divisions of the centralised Austrian Empire established in 1804. During the restoration period after the Revolutions of 1848, the Austrian crown lands were ruled by &quot;Statthalter&quot; governors directly subordinate to the Emperor according to the 1849 March Constitution.

By the 1861 February Patent, proclaimed by Emperor Franz Joseph I, the Austrian crown lands received a certain autonomy. The traditional &quot;Landstände&quot; (estates) assemblies were elevated to &quot;Landtage&quot; legislatures, partly elected according to the principle of census suffrage.

After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Kingdom of Hungary (with the Principality of Transylvania), the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and Fiume became constituent parts of the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen (&quot;Transleithania&quot;); ruled in real union with the remaining Austrian crown lands (officially: &quot;The Kingdoms and Lands represented in the Imperial Council&quot;) of &quot;Cisleithania&quot; until the disintegration of the dual monarchy in 1918.
==Bohemia==

The medieval European state of the Crown of Bohemia, which was an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire, consisted of crown lands: the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Margraviate of Moravia, the Duchies of Silesia, Upper and Lower Lusatia.

==Barbados==
When it was a commonwealth realm, in Barbados, the term crown land extended to all land that is under the control or ownership of The Crown (a.k.a. the Government). This could also pertain to land seized by the government, (either through eminent domain or due to criminal activity), or toward lands with backed taxes. The term Crown lands had been used in relation to government owned farms, beaches, and other land areas also maintained by the National Housing Corporation. The Government did not allow private ownership of Barbados&#x27; of coastal beaches in the country, and all areas below the high-tide watermark in the country were considered specifically as &quot;Crown land&quot;.

After 30 November 2021, Barbados had transitioned to a republic, replacing the Monarchy of Barbados with a president as head of state. This caused all crown lands to become &quot;state lands&quot; instead. Effectively in practice, however, functions of state lands remained the same as crown lands.

==Canada==
Within Canada, Crown land is a designated territorial area belonging to the Canadian Crown. Though the monarch owns all Crown land in the country, it is divided in parallel with the &quot;division&quot; of the Crown among the federal and provincial jurisdictions, so that some lands within the provinces are administered by the relevant provincial Crown, whereas others are under the federal Crown. About 89% of Canada&#x27;s land area () is Crown land: 41% is federal crown land and 48% is provincial crown land. The remaining 11% is privately owned. Most federal Crown land is in the territories (Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon) and is administered by Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada. Only 4% of land in the provinces is federally controlled, largely in the form of national parks, Indian reserves, or Canadian Forces bases. In contrast, provinces hold much of their territory as provincial Crown land, which may be held as provincial parks or wilderness.

Crown land is the equivalent of an entailed estate that passes with the monarchy and cannot be alienated from it; thus, per constitutional convention, these lands cannot be unilaterally sold by the monarch, instead passing on to the next king or queen unless the sovereign is advised otherwise by the relevant ministers of the Crown. Crown land provides the country and the provinces with the majority of their profits from natural resources, largely but not exclusively provincial, rented for logging and mineral exploration rights; revenues flow to the relevant government and may constitute a major income stream, such as in Alberta. Crown land may also be rented by individuals wishing to build homes or cottages.

===Alberta===
In the province of Alberta, Crown land, also called &quot;public land&quot;, is territory registered in the name of &quot;His Majesty the King in right of Alberta as Represented by [specific Minister of the Crown]&quot; and remains under the administration of the mentioned minister until the land is sold or transferred via legislation, such as an order in council. Crown land is governed by the &quot;Public Lands Act&quot;, originally passed as the &quot;Provincial Lands Act&quot; in 1931 and renamed in 1949.

===British Columbia===
94% of the land in British Columbia is provincial Crown land, 2% of which is covered by fresh water. Federal Crown land makes up a further 1% of the province, including Indian reserves, defence lands and federal harbours, while 5% is privately owned. The Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations issues Crown land tenures and sells Crown land on behalf of the Crown in Right of British Columbia.

===Saskatchewan===
Approximately 65% of Saskatchewan&#x27;s land is Crown land.

===Newfoundland and Labrador===
95% of Newfoundland and Labrador is provincial Crown land.

===New Brunswick===
Currently, 48% of New Brunswick&#x27;s territory is Crown land, used for such things as for conservation projects, resource exploitation, and recreation activities. However, through treaties between First Nations and the Crown in Right of Canada, the provincial Crown grants or denies long-term use of Crown lands by aboriginals, as per the treaties.

===Nova Scotia===
As of October 2013, of the of land in Nova Scotia, approximately 1.53 million hectares (3.8 million acres or about 29% of the province) is designated as Crown land. Crown land is owned by the province and managed by the Department of Natural Resources on behalf of the citizens of Nova Scotia. It is a collective asset which belongs to all Nova Scotians. Many acres of Crown land are licensed for a variety of economic purposes to help build and maintain the prosperity of the province. These purposes range from licenses and leases for cranberry bogs, forestry operations, peat bogs, power lines, wind energy, to broadband towers, and tidal energy. In addition, most of the submerged lands (the sea bed) along the province&#x27;s of coastline are also considered Crown land. Exceptions would include federally and privately owned waterlots. The province owns other land across Nova Scotia, including wilderness areas, protected areas, highways, roads, and provincial buildings. These parcels and structures are managed and administered by other departments and are not considered Crown land.

===Manitoba===
By the &quot;Crown Lands Act&quot;, the Lieutenant Governor-in-Council alone has the ability to augment or disperse Crown land and to determine the price of any Crown land being bought or leased. Crown land is used for varying purposes, including agriculture, wind farming, and cottages, while other areas are set aside for research, environmental protection, public recreation, and resource management. Approximately 95% of the province&#x27;s forests sit within provincial Crown land.

===Ontario===
87% of the province is Crown land, of which 95% is in northern Ontario. It is managed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry and is used for economic development, tourism and recreation.

===Prince Edward Island===
88% of the land on Prince Edward Island (PEI) is privately held, leaving 12% of the land as public, or Crown, land. It is the province with the smallest percentage of Crown land, and it is managed by the Ministry of Environment, Energy, and Climate Action. Usage of these lands is for non-economic purposes such as hunting, fishing, trapping, foraging, hiking and bird watching.

===Quebec===
More than 92% of Quebec&#x27;s territory is Crown land. This heritage and the natural resources that it contains are developed to contribute to the socioeconomic development of all regions of Quebec. Public land is used for a variety of purposes: forestry, mineral, energy, and wildlife resources; developing natural spaces, including parks for recreation and conservation, ecological preserves, and wildlife refuges and habitats; developing infrastructure for industrial and public utilities purposes as well as for leisure and vacation purposes.

==France==

The crown lands, crown estate, or royal domain (&quot;domaine royal&quot;) of France refers to the lands and fiefs directly possessed by the kings of France. Before the reign of Henry IV, the royal domain did not encompass the entirety of the territory of the kingdom of France and for much of the Middle Ages significant portions of the kingdom were direct possessions of other feudal lords.

In the 10th and 11th centuries, the first Capetians—while being rulers of France—were among the least powerful of the great feudal lords of France in terms of territory possessed. Patiently, through the use of feudal law (and, in particular, the confiscation of fiefs from rebellious vassals), skillful marriages with female inheritors of large fiefs, and even by purchase, the kings of France were able to increase the royal domain, which, by the 16th century, began to coincide with the entire kingdom. However, the medieval system of appanage (a concession of a fief by the sovereign to his younger sons and their sons after them, although they could be reincorporated if the last lord had no male heirs) alienated large territories from the royal domain and created dangerous rival territories (especially the Duchy of Burgundy in the 14th and 15th centuries).

==Hawaii==

Prior to the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, the Hawaiian monarchs had access to 1.8 million acres (7,300 km2), the private lands of Kamehameha III which he set aside for the dignity of the royal office for the ruler of the Hawaiian monarchy on 8 March 1848 during the Great Mahele. Kamehameha III and his successors made these lands their private property, selling, leasing or mortgaging at their enjoyment. At the death of Kamehameha IV, it was decided by the Kingdom&#x27;s Supreme Court that under the above-mentioned instrument executed by Kamehameha III, reserving the Crown Lands, and under the confirmatory Act of 7 June 1848, &quot;the inheritance is limited to the successors to the throne&quot;, &quot;the wearers of the crown which the conqueror had won,&quot; and that at the same time &quot;each successive possessor may regulate and dispose of the same according to his will and pleasure as private property, in like manner as was done by Kamehameha III.&quot; Afterwards an Act was passed 3 January 1865, &quot;relieve the Royal Domain from encumbrances and to render the same inalienable.&quot; This Act provided for the redemption of the mortgages on the estate, and enacted that the remaining lands are to be &quot;henceforth inalienable and shall descend to the heirs and successors of the Hawaiian Crown forever,&quot; and that &quot;it shall not be lawful hereafter to lease said lands for any terms of years to exceed thirty.&quot; The Board of Commissioners of Crown Lands shall consist of three persons to be appointed by His Majesty the King, two of whom shall be appointed from among the members of His Cabinet Council, and serve without remuneration, and the other shall act as Land Agent, and shall be paid out of the revenues of the said lands, such sum as may be agreed to by the King.&quot;

The lands were held by Queen Lili&#x27;uokalani before 17 January 1893. On this date, the monarchy was overthrown. The crown lands were taken in charge by the provisional and republican governments. When the Republic of Hawaii joined the United States in 1898, the territorial government took ownership. In 1910, Liliuokalani, the former Queen, unsuccessfully attempted to sue the United States for the loss of the Hawaiian Crown Lands.

In March 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a unanimous opinion in Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, reversing the Hawaii Supreme Court&#x27;s holding that the federally enacted Apology Resolution of 1993 bars the State of Hawaii from selling to third parties any land held in public trust until the claims of Native Hawaiians to the lands have been resolved. The Court first held that it had jurisdiction to review the Hawaii Supreme Court&#x27;s opinion because it rested on the Apology Resolution. It then found the Hawaii Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretation of the Apology Resolution to be erroneous, and held that federal law does not bar the State from selling land held in public trust. Accordingly, it remanded the case to the Hawaii Supreme Court to determine if Hawaiian law alone supports the same outcome.

==Hong Kong==
All &quot;Crown leases&quot; in the former British crown colony became &quot;government leases&quot; on 1 July 1997 upon the change of status of the territory.

==Poland and Lithuania==
===Legal condition===
In Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth crown lands were known as &quot;królewszczyzny&quot; which translates to &quot;regality&quot; or &quot;royal land&quot;.

In the Kingdom of Poland under the rules of Piast then Jagiellonian dynasties the institution of crown lands was similar to those in Great Britain or Austria-Hungary: the lands were the property of the monarch or dynasty. Beginning in 15th century the properties were often leased, gifted or hocked to the members of the nobility. Those nobles who had received the privilege of administering the crown lands (and thus keeping most of its profits) had the title of Starosta. Once given a crown land, one had the right to keep it &quot;for life&quot;. Families of Starostas often wanted to unlawfully keep the royal properties, and that led to common abuses of law.

After the end of Kingdom in Poland the era of new political system called &quot;Republic of szlachta (nobility)&quot; started in late 16th century already in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. As a result of reform and the introduction of the royal election of Polish kings, the &quot;royal lands&quot; became &quot;public property or state property&quot;.

Formally &quot;royal lands&quot; formed about 15–20% of Poland (later, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), and were divided into two parts:

* the (&quot;dobra stołowe&quot; or &quot;ekonomie&quot;), which were provided money for king&#x27;s personal treasure and expenses, among them the support of the army (wojsko kwarciane)
* the rest, which the king was obliged to lease to the outstanding members of the nobility.

Among the largest Crown lands in the 16th and 17th centuries were the territories of Malbork and Wielkorządy with Niepołomice, Sambor in the Crown of the Polish Kingdom.

Monarch&#x27;s economies in, as it was called, &quot;Republic&quot; of Lithuania (Grand Duchy of Lithuania) were: biggest Šiauliai economy, Alytus economy, also economies in Grodno and Mohylew.

The legal conditions of peasants were better in the Crown lands than on the hereditary estates of the nobility, as there were fewer serfdom obligations.

===Conditions in the Crown===
Mostly due to lack of constant dynasty in Poland (see: Royal elections in Poland), royal lands were under notorious, often illegal, control of powerful local magnates, sometimes even semi-independent from the state.

Ruch egzekucyjny (execution movement) of the late 16th century, led by Lord Grand Chancellor of the Crown Jan Zamoyski (against the interests of his own family), put as one of its goals the &quot;execution of lands&quot;, i.e. return of all crown lands, which were often illegally held by next generations of Starostine families. In 1562–1563 they forced most of the crown land in the Crown of the Polish Kingdom to be returned to the monarch, however later the whole cycle repeated. In the following centuries Ruch egzekucyjny (lit. &quot;execution movement&quot;) and subsequently elected Kings were gradually weakened because szlachta achieved more and more privileges – the &quot;Golden&quot; Liberty.

Eventually the nobility controlled most of the crown lands. People without a formal title of nobility inherited or granted were not allowed to be infeudated with regalities.

After the First Partition of Poland crown lands were reformed in 1775, lessening the abuses of the nobility, and the Great Sejm of 1788–1792 decided to put them on sale, to raise funds for reforms and modernisation of the army.

After the following partitions of Poland in 1795 the &quot;royal lands&quot; were directly annexed by the partitioning powers.

===Situation in Lithuania===
In the Great Duchy of Lithuania political nation did not follow experience of neighbouring Poland. Lithuanian magnates retained such lands in their hands.

==Spain==
Historically, the kings of Spain have possessed vast lands, palaces, castles and other buildings, however, at present all those properties are owned by the State. The Crown lands are administered by an independent institution called Patrimonio Nacional, which is responsible for the maintenance of these properties that are always available to the King or Queen of Spain.

==United Kingdom and its predecessor states==
Historically, the properties now known as the Crown Estate were administered as possessions of the reigning monarch to help fund the business of governing the country. By the Civil List Act 1760, George III surrendered control over the Estate&#x27;s revenues to the treasury, in order to relieve him from paying for the costs of the civil service, defence costs, the national debt, and his own personal debts, and, in return, to receive an annual grant known as the Civil list.

==Vietnam==
The &quot;Domain of the Crown&quot; ( (); ) was originally the Nguyễn dynasty&#x27;s geopolitical concept for its protectorates and principalities where the Kinh ethnic group did not make up the majority. Later it became a type of administrative unit of the State of Vietnam. It was officially established on 15 April 1950 and dissolved on 11 March 1955. In the areas of the Domain of the Crown, Chief of State Bảo Đại was still officially (and legally) titled as the &quot;Emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty&quot;.

<text>Shishak, also spelled Shishaq or Susac (, Tiberian: , ), was, according to the Hebrew Bible, an Egyptian pharaoh who sacked Jerusalem in the 10th century BC. He is usually identified with the pharaoh Shoshenq I.

He supported Jeroboam against king Rehoboam of Judah, and led a successful campaign through that country with a large army. Shishak did not destroy Jerusalem but took the treasures of Solomon&#x27;s Temple and the king&#x27;s house. His campaign records, found in the Bubastite Portal at Karnak and a relief at el-Hibeh, list several conquered towns but fail to mention Jerusalem. The omission has sparked various theories, with some scholars questioning the historical accuracy of the Biblical account and others suggesting possible explanations for the omission. Shishak has also appeared in popular culture, notably in the film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.

==Biblical narrative==
Shishak&#x27;s campaign against the Kingdom of Judah and his sack of Jerusalem are recounted in the Hebrew Bible, in 1 Kings 14:25 and 2 Chronicles 12:1–12. According to these accounts, Shishak had provided refuge to Jeroboam during the later years of Solomon&#x27;s reign, and upon Solomon&#x27;s death, Jeroboam became king of the tribes in the north, which separated from Judah to become the Kingdom of Israel. In the fifth year of Rehoboam&#x27;s reign, commonly dated ca. 926 BC, Shishak swept through Judah with a powerful army of 60,000 horsemen and 1,200 chariots, in support of Jeroboam. According to , he was supported by the Lubim (Libyans), the Sukkiim, and the Kushites (&quot;Ethiopians&quot; in the Septuagint).

Shishak took away treasures of the Solomon&#x27;s Temple and the king&#x27;s house, as well as shields of gold which Solomon had made; Rehoboam replaced them with bronze ones.

According to Second Chronicles,

Flavius Josephus in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; adds to this a contingent of 400,000 infantrymen. According to Josephus, his army met with no resistance throughout the campaign, taking Rehoboam&#x27;s most fortified cities &quot;without fighting&quot;. Finally, he conquered Jerusalem without resistance, because &quot;Rehoboam was afraid.&quot; Shishak did not destroy Jerusalem, but forced King Rehoboam of Judah to strip the Temple and his treasury of their gold and movable treasures.

Shishak was also related by marriage to Jeroboam. The wife of Jeroboam is unnamed in the Masoretic Text, but according to the Septuagint, she was an Egyptian princess called Ano:
:&quot;And Sousakim gave to Jeroboam Ano, the eldest sister of Thekemina his wife, to him as wife; she was great among the king&#x27;s daughters...&quot; 

==Shishak&#x27;s name==
The spelling and pronunciation of Shishak&#x27;s name is not consistent throughout the Hebrew Bible. It occurs three times as &quot;Šīšaq&quot; (שִׁישַׁק), three times as &quot;Šīšāq&quot; (שִׁישָׁק), and once as &quot;Šūšaq&quot; (שׁוּשַׁק).

==Identified as Pharaoh Shoshenq I==
In the very early years after the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs, on chronological, historical, and linguistic grounds, nearly all Egyptologists identified Shishak with Shoshenq I of the 22nd dynasty, who invaded Canaan following the Battle of Bitter Lakes. A common variant of Shoshenq&#x27;s name omits its &#x27;n&#x27; glyphs, resulting in a pronunciation like, &quot;Shoshek&quot;. This position has been maintained by most scholars ever since, and remains the majority position today.

===Campaign records===
Shoshenq I left behind &quot;explicit records of a campaign into Canaan (scenes; a long list of Canaanite place-names from the Negev to Galilee; stelae), including a stela [found] at Megiddo&quot; which supports the traditional interpretation.

The Bubastite Portal, a relief discovered at Karnak, in Upper Egypt, and similar reliefs on the walls of a small temple of Amun at el-Hibeh, shows Pharaoh Shoshenq I holding in his hand a bound group of prisoners. The names of captured towns are located primarily in the territory of the kingdom of Israel (including Megiddo), with a few listed in the Negeb, and perhaps Philistia. Some of these include a few of the towns that Rehoboam had fortified according to Chronicles. However, the inscription makes no mention of Jerusalem itself, nor of Rehoboam or Jeroboam. Various explanations of this omission of Jerusalem have been proposed: its name may have been erased, the list may have been copied from an older pharaoh&#x27;s list of conquests, or Rehoboam&#x27;s ransoming the city (as described in the Second Book of Chronicles) would have saved it from being listed.

===Critical questions===
It has been claimed that the numbers of Egyptian soldiers given in Chronicles can be &quot;safely ignored as impossible&quot; on Egyptological grounds; similarly, the numbers of chariots reported in 2 Chronicles is likely exaggerated by a factor of ten—leading 60,000 horses through the Sinai and Negev would have been logistically impossible, and no evidence of Egyptian cavalry exists from before the 27th Dynasty. Some authors, such as Israel Finkelstein, deem the treasures taken by Shishak as unlikely, alleging the material culture of 10th century Jerusalem and surroundings to have been too primitive to allow for any treasure that an Egyptian pharaoh would have been interested in. Finkelstein concludes that the looting narrative &quot;should probably be seen as a theological construct rather than as historical references&quot;. By contrast, Krystal V. L. Pierce has pointed that a relief from Karnak records Sheshonq I presenting the tribute from his Levantine campaign to Amun-Re, and that the Pharaoh used the tribute to finance the construction of several monumental structures across Egypt.

==Fringe theories==
Other identifications of Shishak have been put forward by chronological revisionists, arguing that Shoshenq&#x27;s account does not match the Biblical account very closely, but these are considered fringe theories. In his book &quot;Ages in Chaos&quot;, Immanuel Velikovsky identified him with Thutmose III of the 18th dynasty. More recently, David Rohl&#x27;s New Chronology identified him with Ramesses II of the 19th dynasty, and Peter James has identified him with Ramesses III of the 20th dynasty.

==In popular culture==
Shishak is mentioned in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s action-adventure film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; as the pharaoh who seized the Ark of the Covenant from the Temple of Solomon during his raids on Jerusalem and hid it in the Well of Souls in Tanis.

<text>Felsite is a very fine-grained volcanic rock that may or may not contain larger crystals. Felsite is a field term for a light-colored rock that typically requires petrographic examination or chemical analysis for more precise definition. Color is generally white through light gray, or red to tan and may include any color except dark gray, green or black (the colors of trap rock). The mass of the rock consists of a fine-grained matrix of felsic materials, particularly quartz, plagioclase and potassium feldspar, and may be termed a quartz felsite or quartz porphyry if the quartz phenocrysts are present. This rock is typically of extrusive origin, formed by compaction of fine volcanic ash, and may be found in association with obsidian and rhyolite. In some cases, it is sufficiently fine-grained for use in making stone tools. Its fine texture and felsic components allow for good knapped pieces, much like working chert, producing conchoidal fracture. 

Dendritic manganese oxides such as pyrolusite or iron oxides such as limonite may precipitate along rock crevices, giving some rock chunk surfaces multicolored or arborescent patterned textures.

<text>Bombay Hindi, also known as &quot;Bambaiya Hindi&quot; or &quot;Mumbaiya Hindi&quot;, is the Hindustani dialect spoken in Mumbai, in the Konkan region of India. Its vocabulary is largely from Hindi–Urdu, additionally, it has the predominant substratum of Marathi-Konkani, which is the official language and is also widely spoken in the Konkan division of Maharashtra. Bombay Hindi also has elements of Gujarati.

==General==
While many such local dialects have evolved in cosmopolitan cities around the world, Bombay Hindi is widely known throughout India, as a result of its frequent use in Bollywood movies. Initially, this dialect was used to represent crooks and uncouth characters as, to quote film critic Shoma A. Chatterji, &quot;Indian films have the unique quality of different characters speaking different varieties of Hindi according to their social status, their caste, communal identity, education, profession, financial status, etc. [...] The villain&#x27;s goons, speak in a special vulgarised, Bambaiya Hindi concocted specifically to typify such screen characters in Hindi cinema.&quot;. Lately, however, Bambaiya Hindi has become popular and prominent, particular with the success of the Munnabhai movies, in which the lead characters – being members of the Mumbai criminal underworld – speak entirely in this dialect.

Despite this increase in popularity, this dialect has its critics, and is sometimes seen as being disrespectful and demeaning.

Among the more prominent neologisms which originated in Bambaiya Hindi but have spread throughout India are the words (from Marathi bindhast = without fear, relaxed; this word was incorporated into the Oxford English Dictionary in 2005) and Gandhigiri (coined in the movie &quot;Lage Raho Munna Bhai&quot;, a combination of Gandhi and &quot;-giri&quot;, which is similar to the English &#x27;ism&#x27; (as in Gandhi-ism, though slightly more informal).

Bollywood has also incorporated many Marathi words in Hindi like weni, thaska, wakda, porgi, navri, navrai, kombdi, mulga/mulgi. Many Hindi songs have some Marathi words added.

<text>Operation Plumbat is an alleged Israeli covert operation in 1968 to obtain yellowcake (processed uranium ore) to support the Israeli nuclear weapons effort.

France stopped supplying Israel with uranium fuel for the Dimona nuclear reactor after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Numerous sources believe that in 1968 Israel managed to obtain 200 tonnes of yellowcake from the Belgian mining company Union Minière, which shipped processed uranium mined in Shinkolobwe, in the present-day Haut-Katanga Province of Democratic Republic of the Congo, out of Antwerp to Genoa for a European front company by transferring the ore to another vessel at sea. This Mossad covert operation violated Euratom controls of nuclear materials.

The name of Operation Plumbat is derived from the Latin &quot;plumbum&quot;, meaning lead, and is a reference to the labeling of the drums used to transport the yellowcake.

== Mossad operation ==
Mossad agents arranged to set up a fictitious company called Biscayne Trader&#x27;s Shipping Corporation in Liberia to purchase an ocean freighter; this became &quot;Scheersberg A&quot; (Scheersberg is a town in northern Germany, near the border with Denmark). With the assistance of a friendly official at a German petrochemical company, $3.7 million was paid to Union Minière for 200 tonnes of yellowcake uranium. The yellowcake was left over inventory from uranium mined from Shinkolobwe, in upper Katanga. This was loaded onto the newly renamed freighter and a contract was arranged with an Italian paint company for the yellowcake to be processed.

The cargo was loaded in November 1968 in barrels marked &quot;PLUMBAT&quot; (a harmless lead product). The Spanish crew were replaced by sailors recruited by Mossad and forged passports provided. The freighter sailed for Genoa on November 17. Approximately seven days into her voyage, she rendezvoused with an Israeli freighter under cover of darkness, somewhere east of Crete. The cargo was transferred in near silence whilst Israeli gunboats kept watch nearby. After loading the Israeli freighter set sail toward Haifa, and eventually the Tunnel, a six-level automated chemical plant for processing fuel rods into plutonium at Dimona.

&quot;Scheersberg A&quot; docked in Turkey eight days later; without any cargo to deliver, the contract with the Italian paint company was cancelled. Several pages were missing from the ship&#x27;s log and no explanation was offered; the Italian paint company assumed the cargo had been lost to hijack or piracy.

== Mossad Operative confession ==
In 1973, suspected Mossad operative Dan Ert (Dan Ærbel) was arrested in Norway, alleged to have helped assassinate Ahmed Bouchikhi, a waiter, mistaken for one of the Palestinian terrorists who had killed eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic games in Munich. Ert recounted the story whilst imprisoned as a way of proving to Norwegians that he was a Mossad operative. The story seemed more credible once it was found that Ert had been listed as president of the Liberian shipping company used to purchase &quot;Scheersberg A&quot;.

In 1977 the Plumbat Affair was leaked by Paul Leventhal, a former U.S. Senate attorney, at a disarmament conference, he said the stolen yellowcake shipment was enough to run a reactor such as Dimona for up to ten years.

Israeli officials at first were silent when enquiries were made, then issued a denial of all aspects of the story that related to Israel.

==Popularization==

A factual book called &quot;The Plumbat Affair&quot; by Elaine Davenport, Paul Eddy and Peter Gillman, published in 1978 by Futura Publications Ltd, 

The book &quot;Operation Uranium Ship&quot; by Menachem Portugali, Dennis Eisenberg and Eli Landau, published in 1978 by Signet Books, claims to provide details.

The 1979 book &quot;Triple&quot; by Ken Follett, also by Signet, is a fictional recreation of the events.

<doc id="610064" wikidata="Q1367860" url="?curid=610064" title="Talthybius">
<text>Talthybius () was herald and friend to Agamemnon in the Trojan War. Talthybius is a Greek soldier who serves as both a messenger and a herald during the time of the Trojan War. Only two mortal men are present in Euripides’ play The Trojan Women, and Talthybius is the one who interacts with the Trojan women the most. Although he represents a hostile nation, he surprisingly shows his vulnerable side and affection towards these women. Even though he must obey orders (which in result, he will end up hurting these women) he does make an effort to lessen their suffering. Talthybius is a complex character who tries to be empathetic despite enabling the rape and enslavement of Troy&#x27;s women.

== Mythology ==
Talthybius was the one who took Briseis from the tent of Achilles. Preceding the duel of Menelaus and Paris, Agamemnon charges him to fetch a sheep for sacrifice. He died at Aegium in Achaia.

Talthybius appears in Euripides’ &quot;Hecuba&quot; and &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;. In addition, he has a small role in The &quot;Iliad&quot;. In Book IV, Agamemnon orders Talthybius to fetch the medic Machaon after Menelaus is wounded with an arrow shot by Pandarus. In &quot;Hecuba&quot; and &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;, Talthybius seems to always be the bearer of bad news. In &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;, he tells Hecuba that all of the women are being divided up and given to different Greek Heroes as slaves. He says that Cassandra will be given to Agamemnon and that Hecuba herself will be given to Odysseus. Furthermore, Talthybius is the one who tells Andromache of the Greeks’ plan to kill Astyanax, her son by Hector. The plan is to throw Astyanax (who is only a small child) from the towers of Troy because it would not be wise to let the son of a Trojan hero reach adulthood. In &quot;Hecuba&quot;, Talthybius brings an order from Agamemnon to Hecuba, telling her to bury her daughter, Polyxena, who was sacrificed to Achilles.

He exercises significant independence in the way he carries out his orders given to him from the commanders. He served in the Trojan War alongside his followers and others who supported him. Talthybius was committed to the interests of the Greek commanders and takes care to avoid their disapproval. In his dealings with the captive women he is felt in the main to be a sympathetic figure.

== Worship ==
He was worshipped as a hero at Sparta and Argos, where sacrifices were offered to him.

<text>The National Intelligence Centre (, CNI) is the Spanish official intelligence agency, acting as both its foreign and domestic intelligence agency. Its headquarters are located next to the A-6 motorway near Madrid. The CNI is the successor of the Centro Superior de Información de la Defensa, the Higher Centre for Defence Intelligence. Its main target areas are North Africa and South America and it operates in more than 80 countries. CNI&#x27;s official budget for 2023 is approximately €337.1 million (the CNI can get further resources from the classified funds).

The Secretary of State-Director of the CNI is currently Esperanza Casteleiro.

== Goals and operation ==
The centre&#x27;s essential goal is to provide the Spanish Government all the necessary information to prevent and avoid any risk or menace that affects the independence or integrity of Spain, its national interests, institutions and rule of law. In the same way, the law states that the specific goals of the CNI will be determined and approved yearly by the Council of Ministers. These goals will be included in a secret document, the Intelligence Guidelines.

Besides this organic control of the centre by the Ministers Council, there is also a judiciary control, given the fact certain activities require such intervention. This control is carried out by a judge of the Spanish Supreme Court, chosen by a qualified majority. In this sense, those actions requiring previous authorization by the court are those regarding communications interdiction, entry and registration at home or enterprise addresses, or any other would-be violations of the fundamental rights granted by the Spanish Constitution of 1978.

== Precedents and history ==

The first Spanish intelligence service was created in 1935, in a short-lived experience with an almost null activity, due to the Spanish Civil War paralysing its development. 
During the civil war, the Servicio de Información Militar (SIM) provided intelligence service to the Republicans while the Servicio de Información y Policía Militar (SIPM) provided intelligence service to the Nationalists. Both organizations were dissolved at the end of the civil war.

Student revolts by the end of the 1960s motivated the creation of a National Countersubversive Organization, which was the seed for the Servicio Central de Documentación (SECED), founded in 1972. The Centro Superior de Información de la Defensa (CESID) was formed between 1976 and 1977, from the fusion of the SECED and the High Staff of the Army Information Service (Spanish: &quot;Servicio de Información del Alto Estado Mayor&quot; (SIAEM)).

In 2001, the Government of the People&#x27;s Party reached consensus with other political groups represented in the Congress of Deputies, in particular with the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, to draft the laws that were to regulate the Spanish intelligence services. This was intended to reach the greatest possible consensus in the creation of such State Agencies in order to safeguard the democratic State, removing them, as much as possible, from party politics.

In 2002, the current legal regulation of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) was reached, which was assigned a new name that simplifies and accurately determines its true function. The result of the aforementioned parliamentary agreements was the enactment of two complementary laws, one of which, Law 11/2002 of May 6, regulates the National Intelligence Center, while the other, of an organic nature (Organic Law 2/2002, of May 6), establishes judicial control prior to that certain actions must be submitted to the CNI. Later, in March 2004, the Royal Decree that regulates the National Cryptologic Center (CCN), a body attached to the CNI for the security of information technologies.

The legal framework of the CNI is completed by the provision relating to the statutory regime of its personnel. The personnel regulations of the previous organization date back to 1995. The Law 11/2002 provides for the development of a new statute for the Center&#x27;s staff. The 1995 regulations were modified in 2004. In 2013, a new regulation for personnel was approved.
In 2011, after a ministerial reform undertaken by PM Mariano Rajoy, the CNI became attached to the Ministry of the Presidency but, after the change in government in 2018, PM Pedro Sánchez has once again assigned the CNI to the Ministry of Defence.

== Controversies ==
In 2013, thanks to the Global Surveillance Leaks by Edward Snowden, it was learned that the CNI has been collaborating with the NSA in the massive espionage of millions of Spaniards, directly intercepting or helping to intercept millions of metadata of call logs, text messages and emails.

In 2022 it was revealed that the CNI had spied on at least 18 phones of Catalan separatist politicians. In May 2022, the head of the CNI, Paz Esteban López, was then fired. Esteban later admitted in a committee of the Spanish parliament that her agency, after obtaining court approval, had the devices of Catalan separatists infected with the help of the Israeli spy software Pegasus.

In 2024 the CNI was revealed to be responsible for carrying out a major illegal espionage operation against the Catalan movement through the use of Pegasus spyware.

<text>Ubisoft Blue Byte GmbH (Blue Byte until 2017) is a German video game holding company owned by Ubisoft. It was founded in October 1988 by Thomas Hertzler and Lothar Schmitt as a developer and ís best known for developing the &quot;Anno&quot; and &quot;The Settlers&quot; series. The studio was acquired by Ubisoft in 2001. Related Designs was merged into Blue Byte in 2013, and a third studio in Berlin was established in 2018. Since 2019, Ubisoft Blue Byte acts as the parent company of Ubisoft&#x27;s three German studios, which became branded as Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Mainz and Ubisoft Berlin. The three studios comprise 695 employees as of August 2024.

== History ==

=== Foundation and first games (1988–1993) ===
In 1988, Thomas Hertzler and Lothar Schmitt left Rainbow Arts, a German video game developer, and founded their own, Blue Byte, in October that year. To do so, Hertzler and Schmitt used a starting capital of 10,000 Deutsche Mark borrowed from Hertzler&#x27;s parents and established an office in the attic of Hertzler&#x27;s home in Mülheim.

Blue Byte&#x27;s first published game was the tennis simulation &quot;Great Courts&quot;, released in 1989 by Ubi Soft (later renamed Ubisoft). Blue Byte&#x27;s first big success in Germany and Europe was the turn-based strategy game &quot;Battle Isle&quot;, completed in 1991. Inspired by the Japanese game &quot;Nectaris&quot; for the PC Engine, &quot;Battle Isle&quot; spawned numerous add-ons and sequels, such as the World War I game &quot;History Line: 1914-1918&quot;. The company&#x27;s next big success followed in 1993 with the release of the managerial game &quot;Die Siedler&quot;, marketed internationally as &quot;The Settlers&quot;. &quot;The Settlers&quot; also had numerous sequels and became the most well-known of Blue Byte&#x27;s products.

=== Major projects (1994–2000) ===
Over the years, Blue Byte developed and/or published numerous innovative titles including &quot;Chewy: Escape from F5&quot; and &quot;Albion&quot;, but most of them were not successful internationally. Efforts to break into the American market, usually aided with publishing by Accolade, failed and success was limited to Germany and parts of Europe. In 1995 a Chicago-based entrepreneur named Julian Pretto travelled to Germany and convinced the founders to open a North American office. Following the successful release of &quot;Battle Isle 2020&quot; in the United States, Pretto left the firm to pursue other interests. Three years later, Blue Byte moved from Chicago, Illinois, to its new facilities in Austin, Texas.

The popular turn-based strategy &quot;Battle Isle&quot; series from the early 1990s achieved cult status similar to &quot;Settlers&quot;. However, when it was revised in 1997 as a 3-D tactical game &quot;Incubation&quot; similar to &quot;X-COM: UFO Defense&quot; and later in 2001 &quot;Battle Isle: The Andosia War&quot;, which tried to bridge the gap between turn-based strategies and real-time strategies, it alienated many players who came to expect that the &quot;Battle Isle&quot; brand would represent traditional turn-based strategies.

=== As a subsidiary of Ubisoft (2001–present) ===
In February 2001, Blue Byte was acquired by Ubi Soft and tasked to focus on Blue Byte&#x27;s two most popular series. At the time of the acquisition, Blue Byte had a staff of 64 people and was active in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States.

Around 2013, Blue Byte worked with Related Designs on two of its titles including &quot;Might &amp; Magic Heroes Online&quot;. Related Designs was acquired by Ubisoft in April 2013, from which point on the company would develop projects in tandem with Blue Byte. Related Designs was merged into Blue Byte in June 2014, becoming Blue Byte&#x27;s second internal studio. In 2014, Blue Byte developed &quot;The Settlers: Kingdoms of Anteria&quot;. In 2015, the studio worked on &quot;Anno 2205&quot;. In 2016, the studio worked on &quot;Champions of Anteria&quot;, replacing &quot;The Settlers: Kingdoms of Anteria&quot;. The new game was a change from the original &quot;The Settlers&quot; series, with new gameplay. In 2017, the studio helped on the development for the game &quot;Skull &amp; Bones&quot;. By late 2017, it had also worked on &quot;For Honor&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Six: Siege&quot;. In 2018, the studio announced &quot;The Settlers&quot;, the eighth game in the series. Blue Byte is also developing &quot;Anno 1800&quot;. The studio is also working on Beyond Good and Evil 2 together with Ubisoft Montpellier.

In 2017, Blue Byte was rebranded Ubisoft Blue Byte, with a new logo introduced just prior to the Gamescom event in August. A third Blue Byte studio in Berlin was announced in April 2017. The studio was formed out of a building formerly occupied by the Berliner Bank. Ubisoft Blue Byte&#x27;s studio operations manager, Istvan Tajnay, became the new studio&#x27;s studio manager. Although part of Ubisoft Blue Byte, the Berlin-based studio was intentionally named &quot;Ubisoft Berlin&quot;. Ubisoft Berlin began operating in early 2018 and held its official opening on 25 September 2018, then employing 60 people. At the same time, Blue Byte&#x27;s Düsseldorf and Mainz studios had 230 and 100 employees, respectively. At Gamescom in August 2019, Ubisoft Blue Byte revealed a new corporate identity in which its self-branded studios were renamed Ubisoft Düsseldorf and Ubisoft Mainz. The move primarily aimed at attracting further employees as Ubisoft Blue Byte expected to expand from 520 staff members at the time to 1,000 by 2023. All three studios remain under the Ubisoft Blue Byte legal umbrella. By December 2020, the &quot;Ubisoft Blue Byte&quot; branding was mostly phased out, with the previously stale social media channels deactivated. However, Ubisoft Blue Byte remained the legal parent to its three studios.

<text>Johann Peter Hebel (10 May 1760 – 22 September 1826) was a German short story writer, dialectal poet, Lutheran theologian and pedagogue, most famous for a collection of Alemannic lyric poems (&quot;Allemannische Gedichte&quot;) and one of German tales (&quot;Schatzkästlein des rheinischen Hausfreundes&quot;&quot;Treasure Chest of Rhenish Tales&quot;).

Born in Basel, Hebel entered primary school in 1766 and joined a Latin school three years later; he visited the schools in Basel during summer and in Hausen and Schopfheim respectively in the nearby Wiesental during winter. After the death of his mother in 1773, he remained at school, graduating with the help of friends from the &quot;Gymnasium illustre&quot; of Karlsruhe in 1778 and going on to study theology. He became a home tutor, an assistant preacher, an assistant teacher, a subdeacon and, in 1798, a professor and court deacon.

Hebel was interested in botany, natural history and other subjects. His literary work began with &quot;Allemannische Gedichte&quot;, which is perhaps the most popular work written in Alemannic. He had success with his calendar stories in the &quot;Badischer Landkalender&quot;, and later with &quot;Rheinländischer Hausfreund&quot; (Rhenish Family Treasury), but a dispute between Catholics forced him to resign as editor of the calendar. In his last years he devoted himself increasingly to religion, becoming a prelate in 1819, but his wish to become a parish priest was never fulfilled. His last works were biblical stories for young readers, which served as textbooks until 1855. Hebel died 1826 in Schwetzingen. Goethe, Tolstoy, Gottfried Keller, Hermann Hesse, Martin Heidegger and other writers have praised his works.

==Early life==

Johann Peter Hebel was born on 10 May 1760 in Basel, where his parents were employed in a patrician household during the summer. He spent half of his childhood in Basel and the other half in the village of Hausen im Wiesental, where his father worked as a weaver during the winters. As he wrote in an autobiographical sketch, &quot;there I learned early on what it meant to be poor and rich ... to have nothing and to have everything, to be happy with the happy people and to be sad with those who cried&quot;. Memories of both places had a deep influence on his literary work. Hebel&#x27;s father, who had moved to southern Baden from the Hunsrück area, died of typhus early in 1761, as did his younger sister, who was only a few weeks old. Hebel went to primary school in Hausen in 1766, and in 1769 went on to the Latin school in Schopfheim, where his teacher was the theologian August Gottlieb Preuschen. During the summer months he went to a parish school in Basel, and later to the prestigious cathedral school (&quot;Gymnasium am Münsterplatz&quot;). His mother died when he was thirteen.

In 1774, with financial help from friends, Hebel joined the &quot;Gymnasium Illustre&quot; in Karlsruhe (now the Bismarck-Gymnasium), where he graduated in 1778. After studying theology in Erlangen from 1778 to 1780, he became a home tutor and assistant preacher in Hertingen, Bad Bellingen, and was appointed &quot;Präzeptoratsvikar&quot; (assistant teacher) in 1783 at the &quot;Pädagogium&quot; in Lörrach, now called the Hebel-Gymnasium in his honour. He became friends with the headmaster, Tobias Günttert, and through him met Gustave Fecht, Günttert&#x27;s sister-in-law, with whom he had a long-lasting, platonic relationship and to whom he sent numerous letters. Hebel remained unmarried all his life, although in later years he adored the actress Henriette Hendel-Schütz. In 1791 he returned to Karlsruhe to take up a position as a deacon at the Karlsruhe Gymnasium, but was instead only named a &quot;subdeacon&quot;. Apart from teaching, Hebel occasionally preached at court, where he enjoyed great popularity.

==Later life==

In 1798 Hebel became a professor and court deacon. He taught several other subjects in the Gymnasium, among them botany and natural history. He took a broad interest in botany; he maintained a herbarium and rearranged the botanical terms and diagnoses in &quot;Flora badensis alsatica&quot;, written by his friend, botanist Karl Christian Gmelin. In his honour, Gmelin named a plant &quot;Hebelia allemannica&quot;, though it was later renamed &quot;Tofieldia calyculata&quot;. Hebel became an honorary member of the mineralogical society in Jena in 1799, and three years later a corresponding member of the &quot;Vaterländischen Gesellschaft der Ärzte und Naturforscher in Schwaben&quot;. In his youth he enjoyed the works of Klopstock and Jung-Stilling. Later he especially liked Jean Paul and Johann Heinrich Voß.

Hebel lived in Karlsruhe until his death, but made occasional journeys to other regions. His wish to become a parish priest in Wiesental was never fulfilled, though he wrote an inaugural sermon for a rural parish in 1820. In this sermon he wrote, &quot;to live and die as a pastor in a peaceful country town, among honest people, has always been my sole wish, up to this hour; it was what I wished for in the happiest and in the darkest moments of my life&quot;. Instead, he was &quot;led higher and higher by an invisible hand, ever further away from my modest goals&quot;. In 1805 he was offered the Lutheran parish of Freiburg im Breisgau, but he declined it at the behest of Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden. He was rewarded in 1808 with his appointment as director of the Gymnasium in Karlsruhe. In 1819 he became a prelate of the Lutheran regional church, a leading position that brought with it a seat in the Upper House of the Parliament (&quot;Ständeversammlung&quot;) of Baden. As a member of parliament he devoted himself mainly to education, the church and social policy. He later gave a speech at the consecration of the statehouse in Karlsruhe. Even though the Lutheran and Reformed regional churches of Baden merged in 1821 with strong support from his side, into today&#x27;s Evangelische Landeskirche in Baden, his position as the prelate of the unified Protestant church was not endangered.

Hebel&#x27;s health deteriorated after 1815. In 1826 he travelled to Heidelberg and Mannheim to oversee school exams, and he died on 22 September 1826 in nearby Schwetzingen. His grave is there. Johannes Bähr succeeded him as prelate in the regional church of Baden.

==Writings==

===&quot;Allemannische Gedichte&quot;===

Apart from a few early attempts, Hebel&#x27;s began his literary work near the end of the 18th century. After returning to Karlsruhe from a trip to Wiesental in 1799, he began to write &quot;Allemannische Gedichte&quot;, inspired by a longing for his home. (&quot;Allemannische&quot; is the spelling he used; normally it has just one &quot;l&quot;.) The 32 poems &quot;for friends of the rural way of life&quot; were written in Alemannic, the local dialect of Wiesental. Hebel could not find a Basel publisher willing to produce the book in Alemannic, and the collection was only published in 1803 by Philip Macklot in Karlsruhe, after Hebel and his friends managed to collect enough advance subscriptions. The first edition was published anonymously, possibly because Hebel was concerned about getting a rustic image.

In &quot;Allemannische Gedichte&quot;, Hebel depicts the local life and customs of his homeland, with topics ranging from a description of the river Wiese, through praise of the Breisgau area, to his work in the ironworks in Hausen. Perhaps the most famous poem is &quot;Die Vergänglichkeit&quot;, a dialogue in blank verse about death, in which the father (Alemannic: &quot;Ätti&quot;) tells his son (&quot;Bueb&quot;) a story based on Rötteln Castle, about how a glorious town like Basel will decline and likewise the whole world. Hebel also included his experience of his mother&#x27;s death: the conversation between Ätti and Bueb takes place in a cart on the street between Steinen and Brombach, where Hebel&#x27;s mother had died.

&quot;Allemannische Gedichte&quot; was very successful, and a new edition was published a year later, this time crediting the author. When Hebel read the poems aloud to margrave Charles Frederick, the duke praised them, and Hebel noticed his exact local knowledge: &quot;I am surprised how the margrave knew all the villages, every small place, every shrub and hedge from Utzenfeld to Lörrach, and could always say: this is this, and yes, that&#x27;s how it is.&quot; In the following decades, further editions were released in Aarau, Vienna and Reutlingen. Famous poets such as Jean Paul (1803) and Goethe (1804) wrote reviews of the poems. Hebel was elated at this success and wrote in a letter: &quot;In certain moments I feel all proud inside, and as if drunk with happiness, that I could make our otherwise despised and ridiculed language so classical and give it such artistic fame&quot;.

===Calendar stories===
Hebel&#x27;s second famous work is his calendar stories, which he wrote from 1803 on for the &quot;Badische Landkalender&quot; and especially from 1807 for its successor, the &quot;Rheinländischer Hausfreund&quot;. This old Lutheran calendar was selling poorly in the early 19th century, and Hebel was a member of the commission appointed to suggest improvements. After several discussions, Hebel finally became editor of the new calendar, which was first released in 1807. One of the biggest improvements was to have more text, featuring &quot;instructive news and funny stories&quot;. Hebel wrote about 30 of these stories each year, and they were highly successful. The &quot;Schatzkästlein des rheinischen Hausfreundes&quot; was issued in 1811 as a collection of the most interesting of these stories. Further editions followed in 1816 and 1827. The calendar stories included news, short stories, anecdotes, comical stories and modified fairy tales. They were intended both to entertain and to provide moral education. The best-known of Hebel&#x27;s calendar stories are &quot;Unverhofftes Wiedersehen&quot; (unexpected reunion) and &quot;Kannitverstan&quot; (I cannot understand). The philosopher Ernst Bloch called the first &quot;the most beautiful story of the world&quot;. There was a dispute in 1815, as Hebel&#x27;s calendar story &quot;Der fromme Rat&quot; (pious advice), issued in 1814, was partially criticised by Catholics as being offensive, leading to its removal from the calendar. There he portrays a Catholic who prays to heaven instead of to the cross-bearing priest; the change can be viewed as a conversion of the Catholic to Protestantism. Hebel rounded off his story with the words: &quot;The family friend knows to praise and venerate that, although he has never prayed to a rosary, else he would not write to the Lutheran calendar.&quot; Subsequently, Hebel resigned as editor and wrote far fewer calendar stories, except in 1819, when he wrote more than ever to make that year&#x27;s issue of the &quot;Rheinländischer Hausfreund&quot; possible.

===Bible stories ===
After the calendar stories, Hebel wrote &quot;Biblische Geschichten&quot; (Bible stories), a new school book for lutheran religious education. His criteria were that it should be clearly written and tell biblical stories in an exciting narrative style aimed at children from ten to fourteen. It took five years to write and was completed and released in 1824. It was used as a textbook until 1855.

==Reception and legacy==

Hebel&#x27;s admirers include Goethe, Gottfried Keller, Martin Heidegger, W. G. Sebald, Tolstoy, and Walter Benjamin. Goethe, who tried to write a poem (the &quot;Schweizerlied&quot;, Swiss song) in Alemannic himself, praised the &quot;Allemannische Gedichte&quot; highly. According to him, Hebel &quot;countrified the universe in the most naive, graceful fashion&quot;. But on the question of whether he would translate Hebel&#x27;s works, Goethe said: &quot;Such a great poet should be only read in the original! One just needs to learn this language!&quot; The Brothers Grimm also admired Hebel, and he met Jacob Grimm in Karlsruhe in 1814. German composer Wilhelmine Schwertzell used Hebel’s text in her song “Wächteruf.”

Hebel&#x27;s work reflects the links between popular culture and deeper ideas. August Vilmar, for example, praised Hebel&#x27;s &quot;Vergänglichkeit&quot; (transience), saying that it gives the folk-like foreground a background not found in other poets who wrote folk idylls. Vilmar further emphasises Hebel&#x27;s description of nature by the river Wiese, the poem &quot;Sonntagsfrühe&quot;, and especially the stories of the &quot;Schatzkästlein&quot;: &quot;In their mood, their deep and genuine feeling, the liveliness of their imagery, the stories are unsurpassable, and worth a whole cart-load of novels&quot;. Theodor Heuss praised Hebel&#x27;s use of the native Alemannic language, not only for parody and vulgarity, but also to make it &quot;a true tool of the poetic craft&quot;, and according to Heuss he created a work that &quot;resonates with the durable, the valid, the eternal, the eternally human&quot;.

Later authors appreciated Hebel&#x27;s work too. Hermann Hesse once commented, &quot;As far as I know, in no literary history do we yet read that Hebel was the greatest German novelist, as great as Keller and more confident and purer and mightier in effect than Goethe.&quot; Theodor W. Adorno lauded his essay &quot;Die Juden&quot; as &quot;one of the most beautiful German prose plays in defence of the Jews&quot;. In &quot;Die gerettete Zunge, Geschichte einer Jugend&quot;, Elias Canetti described the influence that Hebel&#x27;s &quot;Schatzkästlein&quot; had on him: &quot;I never wrote a book, but that I did not secretly aspire to his style, and I began by writing everything in shorthand, the knowledge of which I owe to him alone.&quot; Marcel Reich-Ranicki wrote, &quot;Hebel&#x27;s stories are among the most beautiful in the German language&quot;, and included the &quot;Schatzkästlein&quot; and &quot;Die Rose&quot; in his &quot;Kanon Deutscher Literatur&quot;. The first was also listed in the &quot;ZEIT-Bibliothek der 100 Bücher&quot;.

The Johann-Peter-Hebel-Preis was endowed in 1936 in honour of Hebel. The 10,000-euro prize is awarded every two years to writers, translators, essayists, media representatives or scientists from the German district of Baden-Württemberg who write in Alemannic or are connected with Hebel. The prizegiving ceremony takes place in Hausen im Wiesental, which is also home to the Hebelfest every 10 May. The community of Hausen also awards the annual Johann-Peter-Hebel-Plakette to personalities from the Upper Rhine.

The Lörracher Pädagogium was renamed the Hebel-Gymnasium in 1926. Several &quot;Gymnasien&quot; in Pforzheim and Schwetzingen were named after him. Basic schools, in Essen, Berlin and especially Südbaden bear his name, as do numerous German streets. Monuments to Hebel are found in the Karlsruhe Palace, in Basel, Hausen and in the Hebelpark Lörrach. The Hebelbund Lörrach, Müllheim and the Basler Hebelstiftung are dedicated to his life and work.

<text>A salvage pathway is a pathway in which a biological product is produced from intermediates in the degradative pathway of its own or a similar substance. The term often refers to nucleotide salvage in particular, in which nucleotides (purine and pyrimidine) are synthesized from intermediates in their degradative pathway.

Nucleotide salvage pathways are used to recover bases and nucleosides that are formed during degradation of RNA and DNA. This is important in some organs because some tissues cannot undergo de novo synthesis. The salvaged products can then be converted back into nucleotides. Salvage pathways are targets for drug development, one family being called antifolates.

A number of other biologically-important substances, like methionine and nicotinate, have their own salvage pathways to recycle parts of the molecule.

==Substrates==
The nucleotide salvage pathway requires distinct substrates:

===Pyrimidines===
Uridine phosphorylase or pyrimidine-nucleoside phosphorylase substitutes the anomeric-carbon-bonded phosphate of ribose 1-phosphate for the free base uracil, forming the nucleoside uridine. Uridine kinase (aka uridine–cytidine kinase) can then phosphorylate the 5’-carbon of this nucleoside into uridine monophosphate (UMP). UMP/CMP kinase () can phosphorylate UMP into uridine diphosphate, which nucleoside diphosphate kinase can phosphorylate into uridine triphosphate.

Thymidine phosphorylase or pyrimidine-nucleoside phosphorylase adds 2-deoxy-alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate to thymine, with thymine bonding at the anomeric carbon of the deoxyribose, forming the deoxynucleoside thymidine. Thymidine kinase can then phosphorylate the 5’-carbon of this compound into thymidine monophosphate (TMP). Thymidylate kinase can phosphorylate TMP into thymidine diphosphate, which nucleoside diphosphate kinase can phosphorylate into thymidine triphosphate.

The nucleosides cytidine and deoxycytidine can be salvaged along the uracil pathway by cytidine deaminase, which converts them to uridine and deoxyuridine, respectively. Alternatively, uridine–cytidine kinase can phosphorylate them into cytidine monophosphate (CMP) or deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP). UMP/CMP kinase can phosphorylate (d)CMP into cytidine diphosphate or deoxycytidine diphosphate, which nucleoside diphosphate kinase can phosphorylate into cytidine triphosphate or deoxycytidine triphosphate.

===Purines===
Phosphoribosyltransferases add activated ribose-5-phosphate (Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, PRPP) to bases, creating nucleoside monophosphates. There are two types of phosphoribosyltransferases: adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). HGPRT is an important enzyme in Purine pathway metabolism and its deficiency is implicated in Lesch–Nyhan syndrome. 

==Folate biosynthesis==
Tetrahydrofolic acid and its derivatives are produced by salvage pathways from GTP.

==Other salvage pathways==
L-methionine salvage is the pathway that regenerates methionine from its downstream products. A version of the pathway uses methylthioadenosine (MTA), forming the so-called MTA cycle with its synthesizing reaction. This sulphur-recycling action is found in humans, and seems to be universal among aerobic life.

Nicotinate salvage is the process of regenerating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide from nicotinic acid. This pathway is important for controlling the level of oxidative stress in cells. The human gene NAPRT encodes the main enzyme in the pathway. Cancer cells, which have increased NAD requirements, tend to upregulate the pathway.

Salvage pathways also exist for ceramide, cobalamin, cell wall components, and tetrahydrobiopterin in various organisms.

<doc id="610074" wikidata="Q44483" url="?curid=610074" title="Alexander Oparin">
<text>Alexander Ivanovich Oparin (; – 21 April 1980) was a Soviet biochemist notable for his theories about the origin of life and for his book &quot;The Origin of Life&quot;. 

He also studied the biochemistry of material processing by plants and enzyme reactions in plant cells. He showed that many food production processes were based on biocatalysis and developed the foundations for industrial biochemistry in the USSR.

==Life==
Oparin was born in Uglich in 1894 into a merchant family. He and his parents soon moved to Kokayevo, a nearby village. Oparin had an older brother, , who became an economist.

Oparin graduated from the Moscow State University in 1917 and became a professor of biochemistry there in 1927. Many of his early papers were about plant enzymes and their role in metabolism. His first experimental studies were devoted to the chemistry of respiration. In them, he showed that chlorogenic acid is an essential component of redox reactions in the cell. In 1924 he put forward a hypothesis suggesting that life on Earth developed through a gradual chemical evolution of carbon-based molecules in the Earth&#x27;s primordial soup. In 1935, along with academician Aleksei Bach, he founded the Biochemistry Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In 1939, Oparin became a Corresponding Member of the Academy, and, in 1946, a full member. In 1937, he organized the Department of Technical Biochemistry at the Moscow Technological Institute of Food Industry.

In 1940s and 1950s, Oparin supported the theories of Trofim Lysenko and Olga Lepeshinskaya, who made claims about &quot;the origin of cells from noncellular matter&quot;. &quot;Taking the party line&quot; helped advance his career. However, according to cytologist :
From 1942 to 1960, Oparin headed the Department of Plant Biochemistry at Moscow State University, where he gave lectures on general biochemistry, technical biochemistry, and special courses on enzymology and the problem of the origin of life. In 1970, he was elected President of the International Society for the Study of the Origins of Life.

Oparin was one of the academicians of the USSR Academy of Sciences who signed a letter from scientists to the newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; in 1973 condemning &quot;the behavior of Academician A.D. Sakharov.&quot; The letter accused Sakharov of having &quot;made a number of statements discrediting the political system, foreign and domestic policies of the Soviet Union,&quot; and the academics assessed his human rights activities as &quot;discrediting the honor and dignity of the Soviet scientist.&quot;

Oparin died in Moscow on 21 April 1980, and was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

Oparin became Hero of Socialist Labour in 1969, received the Lenin Prize in 1974, and was awarded the Lomonosov Gold Medal in 1979 &quot;for outstanding achievements in biochemistry&quot;. He was also a five-time recipient of the Order of Lenin.

==Theory of the origin of life==

Although Oparin&#x27;s started out reviewing various panspermia theories, including those of Hermann von Helmholtz and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), he was primarily interested in how life began. As early as 1922, he asserted that:

# There is no fundamental difference between a living organism and lifeless matter. The complex combination of manifestations and properties characteristic of life must have arisen as a part of the process of the evolution of matter.
# Taking into account the recent discovery of methane in the atmospheres of Jupiter and the other giant planets, Oparin suggested that the infant Earth had possessed a strongly reducing atmosphere, containing methane, ammonia, hydrogen and water vapor. In his opinion, these were the raw materials for the evolution of life.
# In Oparin&#x27;s formulation, there were first only simple solutions of organic matter, the behavior of which was governed by the properties of their component atoms and the arrangement of these atoms into a molecular structure. Gradually though, he said, the resulting growth and increased complexity of molecules brought new properties into being and a new colloidal-chemical order developed as a successor to more simple relationships between and among organic chemicals. These newer properties were determined by the interactions of these more complex molecules.
# Oparin posited that this process brought biological orderliness into prominence. According to Oparin, competition, speed of cell growth, survival of the fittest, struggle for existence and, finally, natural selection determined the form of material organization characteristic of modern-day living things. 
Oparin outlined a way he thought that basic organic chemicals might have formed into microscopic localized systems, from which primitive living things could have developed. He cited work done by de Jong and Sidney W. Fox on coacervates and research by others, including himself, into organic chemicals which, in solution, might spontaneously form droplets and layers. Oparin suggested that different types of coacervates could have formed in the Earth&#x27;s primordial ocean and been subject to a selection process that led, eventually, to life.

While Oparin himself was unable to conduct experiments to test any of these ideas, later researchers tried. In 1953, Stanley Miller attempted an experiment to investigate whether chemical self-organization could have been possible on pre-historic Earth. The Miller–Urey experiment introduced heat (to provide reflux) and electrical energy (sparks, to simulate lightning) into a mixture of several simple components that would be present in a reducing atmosphere. Within a fairly short period of time a variety of familiar organic compounds, such as amino acids, were synthesised. The compounds that formed were somewhat more complex than the molecules present at the beginning of the experiment.

===The influence of dialectical materialism on Oparin&#x27;s theory===
The Communist Party&#x27;s official interpretation of Marxism, dialectical materialism, fit Oparin&#x27;s speculation on the origins of life as &#x27;a flow, an exchange, a dialectical unity&#x27;. This notion was re-enforced by Oparin&#x27;s association with Lysenko.

<text>A spokeshave is a hand tool used to shape and smooth woods in woodworking jobs such as making cart wheel spokes, chair legs, paddles, bows, and arrows. The tool consists of a blade fixed into the body of the tool, which has a handle for each hand. Historically, a spokeshave was made with a wooden body and metal cutting blade. With industrialization metal bodies displaced wood in mass-produced tools. Being a small tool, a spokeshave is not suited to working large surfaces.

== History ==
The name spokeshave dates back to at least the 16th century, though the early history of the tool is not well documented. The name spokeshave reflects the early use of the tool by wheelwrights.

The first spokeshaves were made of wood – usually beech – with steel blades, before being largely superseded by the development of metal-bodied spokeshaves in the latter half of the 19th century, though many woodworkers still use wooden spokeshaves. Due to their widespread use and versatility vintage wooden spokeshaves remain commonly available and relatively low in price.

== Types ==
Spokeshaves consist of a &quot;blade&quot; or &quot;iron&quot; secured to the &quot;body&quot; or &quot;stock&quot; of the tool, which has two handles – one for each hand. The bottom surface of the tool is called the &quot;sole&quot;. The blade can be removed for sharpening, and adjusted to vary the depth of the cut.

An early design consisted of a metal blade with a pair of tangs to which the wooden handles were attached, as with a drawknife. Unlike a drawknife, but like a plane, spokeshaves typically have a sole plate that fixes the angle of the blade relative to the surface being worked.

There are a wide variety of different types of spokeshave, suited to different trades and applications. However, based on the shape of the sole and blade spokeshaves can be categorised into the following:
* Flat bottom – Used for flat and concaved surfaces and curves
* Concave – For use on convexed surfaces and curves
* Convex – For use on concaved surfaces and curves
* Rounded bottom – For use on concaved surfaces, especially on tight curves
* Combination – One edge of the blade is convexed, the opposite edge concaved, so the tool can be used on concaved and convexed surfaces.

Spokeshaves can include one or more sharpened notches along which the wooden shaft is pulled in order to shave it down to the proper diameter.

Some convex, wooden variants of the spokeshave are called &quot;travishers&quot;.

== Uses ==

Spokeshaves are used two-handed and are either pushed or pulled depending on the circumstance. As with hand planes, spokeshaves are generally used &#x27;with the grain&#x27; to reduce tear-out.

<text>net was a monthly print magazine that published content on web development and design. Founded in 1994, the magazine was published in the UK by Future plc. It was widely recognized as the premiere print publication for web designers. 

The magazine was initially aimed at the general Internet user, but was adapted into a title aimed at professional and novice web designers; a significant proportion of its readers were full-time web developers. Its sister publication, the web design-focused Creative Bloq blog, is estimated to receive over 10 million monthly readers according to analytics firm SimilarWeb.

The company, and its parent Future plc, were also known for their annual The Net Awards, which was an awards body recognizing outstanding achievements in the web development industry. The magazine ended publication in June 2020.

==History==
The magazine was founded in 1994, originally titled as &quot;.net&quot;, with the first issue appearing in December. Its then editor was Richard Longhurst and assistant editor was Ivan Pope. It was initially aimed at the general Internet user in the early days of the internet and World Wide Web gaining wider momentum. Regular contributors included Bill Thompson and Davey Winder.

In 2001, Haymarket Media Group closed its competing internet magazine &quot;The Net&quot; and sold the subscriber list and the rights to the masthead of the magazine to Future in exchange of Future&#x27;s football title &quot;Total Football&quot;, subsequently Future absorbed &quot;The Net&quot; into &quot;.net&quot;.

In August 2006 (Issue 152), the magazine was redesigned to include a new themed cover design and a new inner layout. Other changes were the addition of a new section at the back of the magazine called &quot;Trash&quot; replacing comics by drew and the Hi! Monkey Soon after the redesign a column entitled &quot;Web Drifter&quot; was introduced; written by Martin Sargent, it usually contained issues and language considered vulgar by the readership, and it was subsequently cancelled.

Also in August 2006, the &quot;Penny Forum&quot; section was removed but reinstated for issue 153 onwards due to large reader response to its removal. Another addition was &quot;Web Pro&quot; in the latter half of the magazine. This is sectioned into several topics (web security, careers, search engine news and web hosting) and written by industry professionals. There is also a web FAQ section.

In December 2013 (issue 248) it was re-badged as &quot;net&quot; to end confusion with Microsoft&#x27;s .NET Framework which launched in 2002. Along with the name change the magazine was given the tagline &quot;The voice of web design&quot;.

Future announced in April 2020 that it would cease publication due to commercial reasons caused by COVID-19 pandemic with issue 332 (June 2020) being the last.

==Net Awards==
The &quot;.net&quot; brand was known throughout the web development industry for its long-running annual The Net Awards, which awards outstanding achievements in the field. The awards recognized the new talent, trends, and technologies that had pushed the web forward over the previous twelve months, as well as recognizing outstanding contributions by established individuals and companies. The annual judging panel was made up of notable industry veterans and thought leaders.

Categories included Agency of the Year, Individual Outstanding Contribution, Developer of the Year, and Best Collaborative Project. Notable past winners include BBC News (redesign of the year), Dropbox (mobile app of the year), Old Spice (viral campaign of the year), Flickr (mobile site of the year), and Jeffrey Zeldman (web standards advocate).

The annual voting process began with a public nominations phase. In 2015 alone, over 1,000 nominee considerations were submitted. These were whittled down to ten nominees per category by the award&#x27;s judging body. Next, a public voting phase occurred to allow for community impact to play a role in each project&#x27;s consideration. Finally, the judges weighed in to determine the winners of each category. Awards were given out live at the year-end ceremony in London.

==Conference==
net launched its Generate Conference in 2014. The event consisted of a single-track, two-day series of speeches and workshops presented by prominent individuals in the web design industry.

The inaugural conference took place in London, with Shopify and Badoo acting as featured sponsors. The 2015 conference took place in New York City, with Media Temple acting as the featured sponsor.

Past speakers included Dan Cederholm (of Dribbble), Jake Archibald (of Google Chrome), Remy Sharp (of Polyfill), Ethan Marcotte (of responsive web design), and Elliot Jay Stocks (of Adobe Typekit).

<doc id="610098" wikidata="Q6847562" url="?curid=610098" title="Mike Krahulik">
<text>Michael Krahulik (; born September 25, 1977) is an American artist for the webcomic &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; and co-founder with Jerry Holkins of Child&#x27;s Play, a charity that organizes toy drives for children&#x27;s hospitals. He goes by the online moniker &quot;Jonathan Gabriel&quot; or &quot;Gabe&quot;. Krahulik does not physically resemble his comic strip counterpart, as the character was not originally meant to represent him.

== Work ==
Mike Krahulik credits cartoonist Stephen Silver as a major influence on his drawing style. His style has dramatically changed since he began drawing &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; in 1998.

Krahulik has done promotional comics for &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot; and many other video games. He also provided the illustrations for the cover of &quot;Agent to the Stars&quot; by John Scalzi. In his early career he contributed artwork to the Daily Victim, a regular feature that used to run on GameSpy, totaling more than 300 illustrations. He has also designed and drawn advertisements, promotional artwork, and pre-order bonuses for several video games, including &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Revelations&quot;, &quot;Uncharted 3: Drake&#x27;s Deception&quot;, and others, mostly from Ubisoft. Krahulik and &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; writer Jerry Holkins have archived these projects and keep them within their web page.

Krahulik also portrays the infamous wizard Jim Darkmagic of the Newhamp Shire Darkmagics (a location deemed much more suitable by gamemaster Chris Perkins than regular New Hampshire) in &quot;Acquisitions Incorporated&quot;, a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; podcast/live show. Through this, he and Holkins had the opportunity to play the new release of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; Fourth Edition in Seattle for a day with Chris Perkins from Wizards of the Coast, Scott Kurtz of &quot;PvP&quot;, and Wil Wheaton.

== Publicity ==
In 2005, anti-video game activist Jack Thompson wrote an open letter (&quot;A Modest Video Game Proposal&quot;) in which he said he would donate $10,000 USD if a game developer would create an ultra-violent game whose protagonist murders video game developers. Krahulik responded to Thompson with an email in which he said that he and fellow gamers had raised about half a million dollars toward charity. Krahulik later said, &quot;Jack actually just called and screamed at me for a couple minutes. He said if I email him again I will &#x27;regret it&#x27;. What a violent man.&quot; After a group of developers made such a game (2006&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m O.K – A Murder Simulator&quot;), Thompson refused to make the donation, calling the game subpar and saying that his proposal was satirical, not serious. Krahulik and the &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; staff then donated $10,000 to the Entertainment Software Association with the note, &quot;For Jack Thompson, because Jack Thompson won&#x27;t&quot;.

Along with Holkins, Krahulik was included on the 2010 &quot;Time&quot; 100 for their work on &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;.

In 2010, Krahulik and Penny Arcade were criticized for several comics and statements about the transgender community and rape, particularly in response to a comic featuring fictional creatures known as &quot;dickwolves.&quot; Krahulik and Holkins dismissed these criticisms, later selling &quot;Team Dickwolves&quot; T-shirts. In June 2013, Krahulik apologized and donated $20,000 to LGBTQ youth suicide prevention group The Trevor Project.

In 2011, Krahulik wrote a foreword for the book &quot;The Art and Making of Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;, which was about the production of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;.

<doc id="610101" wikidata="Q600041" url="?curid=610101" title="Scipione Ammirato">
<text>Scipione Ammirato (; 7 October 153111 January 1601) was an Italian author, philosopher and historian who lived during the Renaissance. He is regarded as an important figure in the history of political thought.

Ammirato&#x27;s best-known work is the political treatise &quot;Discorsi sopra Cornelio Tacito&quot; (&quot;Discourses on Tacitus&quot;), published in 1594. The book soon became “an international classic” with numerous translations. In his &quot;Discorsi&quot; Ammirato presents himself as an anti-Machiavellian from the start, leaving no stone unturned in his efforts to confute the main theses of &quot;Il Principe&quot;. Unlike Botero and Lipsius, Ammirato did not see Tacitism as a surrogate form of Machiavellianism. On the contrary, his &quot;Discorsi&quot; present the works of the Roman historian as an antidote to &quot;Il Principe&quot;, and this approach was to prove widely popular during the long Tacitus revival.

Moreover, Ammirato&#x27;s doctrine of reason of state defined such “reason” as violating neither natural nor divine law; it was the reason of the greater public good (such as public safety) and thus, in departing from the ordinary moral order in extraordinary circumstances, the modern prince did not come into conflict with Christianity.

== Biography ==
Scipione Ammirato was born at Lecce in the Kingdom of Naples in 1531, of a noble family of Florentine origin. In 1547, he was sent to Naples to study law, but he soon turned to literature instead. He devoted himself to the study of classical literature, to satisfy his interest in the ancient world. Ammirato attended literary clubs, striking up a friendship with the poet Berardino Rota, the historian Angelo di Costanzo and the polymath Bartolomeo Maranta.

In 1551 he received the minor orders from the Bishop of Lecce Braccio Martelli, who appointed him a canon of Lecce Cathedral. He afterwards travelled about Italy in quest of occupation; he resided some time at Rome, Padua and Venice, where he became secretary to Alessandro Contarini, a Venetian patrician, and became acquainted with Sperone Speroni, Vittoria Colonna, and Pietro Aretino. He contributed the &quot;Argomenti dei canti&quot; to the edition of Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; published in 1556 by Vincenzo Valgrisi, with the collaboration of Girolamo Ruscelli. He was forced to hurriedly abandon the city on account of the discovery of his love affair with a member of the Contarini family. He took refuge in his native Lecce where in 1558 he founded the Accademia dei Trasformati.

In his native country Ammirato was temporarily employed by several noblemen, and was sent by the Archbishop of Naples on a mission to Pope Pius V. It was a flourishing period in the history of papal Rome. Sixtus V was about to initiate “a program of urban development without parallel in any other European city.” Intellectual life was lively and characterized by a “new humanism.” There Ammirato associated with the humanist Giovanni Pietro Maffei, the philosopher Franciscus Patricius, and the Piedmontese political writer Giovanni Botero. He entered the patronage network of the reforming churchman Girolamo Seripando, to whom he dedicated the philosophical dialogue &quot;Il Dedalione o ver del poeta&quot;.

He then went initially to Naples but was not supported by the Spanish who refused to appoint him official historian of the viceroyalty. In 1569 he fixed his residence at Florence, where the Grand Duke Cosimo I offered him a position as state historiographer at the respectable salary of 300 scudi a year, and Cardinal Ferdinando de&#x27; Medici gave him the use of his own country house at La Petraia. Ammirato became a member of the Florentine Accademia degli Alterati, under the pseudonym &quot;Il Trasformato&quot; (“The Transformed”). In 1583, Bernardo Davanzati submitted to the academy the first book of his translation of the &quot;Annals&quot;, drawing Ammirato&#x27;s attention to the works of Tacitus. In 1595 he was made canon of the Cathedral of Florence. He died in Florence in 1601. At his death, he made his secretary, Cristoforo del Bianco, his heir on condition that del Bianco should adopt the name of Ammirato. Accordingly, he is known as Scipione Ammirato the younger. Several of Ammirato&#x27;s works were edited after his death by del Bianco.

==Major works==
=== &quot;Discorsi sopra Cornelio Tacito&quot; ===
Ammirato invoked Tacitus to refute Machiavelli&#x27;s secular republicanism and composed his &quot;Discorsi&quot; as a counter to Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;Discourses on Livy&quot;. Although Machiavelli is never mentioned by name in the &quot;Discorsi&quot; of Ammirato, his works are discussed in many passages. Machiavelli is always referred to vaguely (“altri,” “l&#x27;autor presupposto,” etc.), even when an exact citation of his work is provided in the margin. Ammirato blames Machiavelli for having subjugated the Christian religion to the demands of the State. Rather than adjust religion to fit themselves, he writes, men, and especially princes, must adjust laws to fit religion, «since in the nature of men in the fields and the caverns, before cities were built, there was a belief in God sooner than there were civil gatherings, on behalf of which laws were made; because it would not otherwise be necessary to say that religion should accommodate to civil life, than who might say that seasons of the year should change to fit individuals rather than the other way round.» 

Ammirato defines the reason of state as:

The reason of state should always have the good of the public as its aim and have to be compatible with religion. Ammirato accepted the derogation from the dictates of natural and positive law only when the preservation of the state was at stake, but rejected as a sign of tyranny any infringement of laws on the grounds of desire for glory or private interest. Ammirato made it clear, however, that though reason of state might authorize a ruler to set aside positive law, it did not permit him to act in violation of divine law.

The work is notable for its &quot;Tacitean&quot; style, concise to the point of obscurity. Ammirato intermixes modern examples with ancient ones, to make it clear, as he says in one of his &quot;Discorsi&quot;, that the truth of things is not changed by the difference of times.

Ammirato&#x27;s &quot;Discorsi sopra Cornelio Tacito&quot; went through four Italian editions before 1599 and two more at the beginning of the next century. They were translated into Latin for the benefit of German readers in 1609 and 1618 and appeared in French translations twice in 1618 and in 1628, 1633, and 1642. In 1612 French royal geographer and humanist Antoine de Laval recapitulated Ammirato&#x27;s arguments in his &quot;Dessein des problèmes politiques&quot;. Abraham Nicolas Amelot de la Houssaye considered Ammirato&#x27;s commentary &quot;unquestionably one of the best that we have upon Tacitus&quot;. Ammirato was widely read in England. Thomas Hobbes was surely acquainted with his work, and Thomas Gordon&#x27;s commentaries on Tacitus owed much to the work of Malvezzi, Ammirato and Alamos de Barrientos.

=== &quot;Istorie Fiorentine&quot; ===
The &quot;Istorie Fiorentine&quot;, were published in two parts. Books I-XX (from the foundation of the city up to 1434, when Rinaldo degli Albizzi was exiled and Cosimo de&#x27; Medici invited to return) were printed in Florence in 1600; Books XXI-XXXV (up to 1574, the year in which Ammirato&#x27;s patron Cosimo I died) were published posthumously in 1641 by Scipione Ammirato the younger, and dedicated to the Grand Duke Ferdinando II. In 1647 Scipione Ammirato the younger published a second and improved edition of the first part, with additions, in 2 vols. fol. The &quot;Istorie&quot; may not be a great imaginative work, but it is securely based on original archive sources, many of which had been previously inaccessible. It is widely considered “a far more complete and comprehensive history of Florence than any which existed in his own day”, and was greatly praised by Tiraboschi. Ammirato, was highly critical of Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;Florentine Histories&quot; and accused the Florentine secretary of having «altered names, twisted facts, confounded cases, increased, added, subtracted, diminished and did anything that suited his fancy without checking, without lawful restraint and what is more, he seems to have done so occasionally on purpose.»

* These are biographical notices of the bishops of those three sees.

===Genealogical works===

* &quot;Delle Famiglie Nobili Napoletane&quot;, a genealogical work in two parts, folio, the first of which was published in 1580, and the second in 1651, after the author&#x27;s death.
* &quot;Delle Famiglie nobili Fiorentine&quot;, completed and published in 1615 by Scipione Ammirato the younger, in fol.
* &quot;Albero e Storia dei Guidi coll&#x27;Aggiunte di Scipione Ammirato il Giovane&quot;, fol. 1640, and again, with additions, in 1650. The Guidi were a prominent aristocratic family that played an important role in the history medieval Florence;
* &quot;Discorsi delle Famiglie Paladina e Antoglietta&quot;, 1595. Ammirato was a careful and accurate genealogist, and his works on these subjects are based on thorough historical research. He examined fifty thousand archival documents for his work on the Neapolitan families, and six thousand for those of Florence.

===Literary works===
* &quot;Il Rota ovvero delle Imprese&quot;, 1562; a treatise upon the heraldic devices, in the form of a dialogue between prominent Neapolitan intellectuals. It is named in honour of one its interlocutors, Berardino Rota, a distinguished humanist and poet and a close friend of Ammirato&#x27;s.
* &quot;Rime spirituali sopra i Salmi&quot;, Venice, 1634.
* &quot;Opuscoli&quot;, a collection of his minor works, in 3 vols, 1637–1642. They contain orations addressed to several princes and popes, biographies of King Ladislaus and his sister Joanna II of Naples, and of several distinguished members of house of Medici; treatises, short poems, and dialogues. Most important among them is the dialogue &quot;Dedalione&quot;, published in the third volume of the &quot;Opuscoli&quot; (1642), in which the seer Tiresias answers the objections raised by Daedalion against poetry, basing his argument on certain passages in Plato.

Ammirato left several manuscript works, among others a continuation of the Monte Cassino Chronicle, and his own autobiography, which is kept in the library of Santa Maria la Nuova of Florence.

<doc id="610102" wikidata="Q3002564" url="?curid=610102" title="Whiteleg shrimp">
<text>Whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei, synonym &quot;Penaeus vannamei&quot;), also known as Pacific white shrimp or King prawn, is a species of prawn of the eastern Pacific Ocean commonly caught or farmed for food.

==Description==
&quot;Litopenaeus vannamei&quot; grows to a maximum length of , with a carapace length of . Adults live in the ocean, at depths to , while juveniles live in estuaries. The rostrum is moderately long, with 7–10 teeth on the dorsal side and two to four teeth on the ventral side.

==Distribution and habitat==
Whiteleg shrimp are native to the eastern Pacific Ocean, from the Mexican state of Sonora to as far south as northern Peru. It is restricted to areas where the water temperatures remain above throughout the year.

==Fishery and aquaculture==
During the 20th century, &quot;L. vannamei&quot; was an important species for Mexican inshore fishermen, as well as for trawlers further offshore.
In the late 20th century, the wild fishery was overtaken by the development of aquaculture production; this began in 1973 in Florida using prawns captured in Panama, that were used in hatcheries for larvae production.

In Latin America, the culture of &quot;L. vannamei&quot; started to develop with the availability of hatchery larvae, the development of feeds, the technification of the growth processes, the freezing installations and market channels, among others.

From Mexico to Peru, most countries developed large production areas in the 70s and 80s.
Ecuador became one of the world leaders producers of this type of shrimp.

Around the beginning of the millennium, Asia introduced this species in their aquaculture operations (changing from &quot;Penaeus monodon&quot;).
China, Vietnam, India and others have become major packers as well.

The packing of shrimp from aquaculture origin has surpassed the quantity of ocean caught wild shrimp in recent years. 
Both origins, ocean caught and aquaculture, are subject to weather changes and diseases.

By 2004, global production of &quot;L. vannamei&quot; approached 1,116,000 t, and exceeded that of &quot;Penaeus monodon&quot;.

&quot;Litopenaeus vannamei&quot; have been cultivated indoors through a recirculating aquaculture systems at TransparentSea Farm, a startup in Downey, California.

== Weather effect==
Normally, there are peaks of production during the warm El Niño years, and reduced production during the cooler La Niña years. The effect is on ocean caught as well as on aquaculture origin.

==Diseases==
There are several known diseases. Production of &quot;L. vannamei&quot; is limited by its susceptibility to white spot syndrome, Taura syndrome, infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis, baculoviral midgut gland necrosis, and &quot;Vibrio&quot; infections.

==Impact on nature==
In 2010, Greenpeace International added the whiteleg shrimp to its seafood red list.
This lists fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries. The reasons given by Greenpeace were &quot;destruction of vast areas of mangroves in several countries, overfishing of juvenile shrimp from the wild to supply shrimp farms, and significant human rights abuses&quot;. In 2016, &quot;L. vannamei&quot; accounted for 53% of the total production of farmed crustaceans globally.

<text>Sunspot (Roberto &quot;Bobby&quot; da Costa) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is most commonly associated with X-Men-related groups, the New Mutants and X-Force.

Classified as a mutant, Sunspot possesses the ability to absorb and channel solar power into physical strength. His personality is idealistic and impulsive, but despite this he is considered a close friend by many of his teammates. He is initially portrayed as an important member of the X-Men&#x27;s 1980s-era junior team and its reincarnation X-Force. He later retires as Sunspot and garners a massive fortune that allows him to buy out the Advanced Idea Mechanics organization, which he re-brands to Avengers Idea Mechanics. He then operates under the code name [[Citizen V]].

Adan Canto portrays the character in &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;. Henry Zaga portrays the character at a younger age in &quot;The New Mutants&quot;. Gui Agustini voices the character in &quot;X-Men &#x27;97.&quot;

==Publication history==
The character of Sunspot was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Bob McLeod. The hero first appeared in &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #4: &quot;The New Mutants&quot; (September 1982). Immediately after this appearance, the character became part of the regular cast of &quot;The New Mutants&quot;, as part of the titular super group.

Sunspot is one of the first Latin American superheroes in mainstream US comics. He is the second Brazilian superhero, after Green Fury (DC).

He was a member of the Avengers in the 2012 relaunch of the &quot;Avengers&quot; title.

Sunspot is one of the main characters in the &quot;U.S.Avengers&quot; series.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Sunspot, or Roberto da Costa, is an Afro-Brazilian, the son of wealthy Afro-Brazilian businessman Emmanuel da Costa and white American archaeologist Nina da Costa. In &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #7, his father is described as a very driven man, who &quot;grew up [...] a barefoot houseboy&quot;, was &quot;by age 20 [...] a millionaire [and] by 30, an economic and political force to be reckoned with.&quot; Emmanuel constantly pushes his son to reach for both his physical and intellectual peaks. Thanks to his father&#x27;s encouragement, Roberto rises to the position of star soccer player at school and is considered by recruiters for the Olympic Games. When Roberto is playing a soccer game with his team, racist members of the opposing team assault him. While taking a brutal beating, his mutant powers manifest, suddenly transforming him into a creature of solid black solar energy. Surprised and terrified, everyone abandons the stadium except for his girlfriend, Juliana.

===New Mutants===
Soon after Roberto discovers his powers, a mutant-hating faction of mercenaries led by Donald Pierce, called the Hellfire Club, kidnap Juliana and use her as bait to lure Roberto into a trap. He engages the kidnappers, but is eventually defeated when the solar power he absorbed runs out. A telepathic mutant named Professor Xavier hears about Pierce&#x27;s evil plan and sends two young mutants called Karma and Psyche to rescue Roberto. During the following battle, Juliana sacrifices her life for Roberto, jumping in front of a bullet meant for him.

Roberto joins Karma and Psyche in pursuit of Pierce. The three are joined by Wolfsbane, and after the battle by Sam Guthrie (Cannonball), one of Pierce&#x27;s misguided mutant hirelings, despite initial reservations from the others. Professor Xavier offers to train the five teenagers to control their new mutant powers. They accept the offer and become the founding members of the New Mutants, a group of junior X-Men. Although Professor X&#x27;s intentions are for them to only be students, over the course of the &quot;New Mutants&quot; series, they grow into superheroes and travel to space, Asgard, and the Amazon, as well as the past and the future. During Roberto&#x27;s tenure with the New Mutants, he and Sam become best friends.

He is at some point reunited with his parents, and then with the New Mutants, when he visits Nova Roma. Some time after, Sunspot and Woflsbane are injected with the drug that helped create Cloak and Dagger and he briefly becomes a monster. He then encounters the White Queen and her Hellions for the first time. He is later abducted and forced to serve as one of the Gladiators. On another adventure with the New Mutants, he visits Asgard. Alongside the New Mutants, he fights Warlock&#x27;s father, the Magus. He also battles Cameron Hodge and the Right. With the New Mutants, he battles Freedom Force. He also falls in love with the alien Gosamyr.

===X-Force===
When the time travelling antihero Cable takes over the New Mutants and turns them into the paramilitary group X-Force, Sunspot parts ways with the team. During this time, Sunspot is tutored by Gideon of the Externals, an old business partner of Roberto&#x27;s father (who has since died), who suspects Sunspot to be a fellow External. Gideon experiments on Sunspot, granting him new powers such as flight and the ability to fire blasts of solar energy. For a time, Sunspot becomes lost in the spacetime continuum after interfering with the teleportation powers of Locus. During this time, a villain called Reignfire appears, with a remarkably similar appearance to Sunspot.

===Reignfire===

The villain Reignfire first appears before Sunspot&#x27;s mysterious disappearance in &quot;X-Force&quot; #28 (1993), and assumes command of the Mutant Liberation Front. Dani Moonstar, who has infiltrated the MLF, sees Reignfire without his mask and believes him to be Sunspot, and in a battle with X-Force, Reignfire removes his mask to reveal himself as Sunspot. The moment is interrupted by the Age of Apocalypse and when reality is restored, Cable &#x27;heals&#x27; Sunspot of this persona dominating his body, transferring some of his Askani knowledge into Sunspot, allowing Sunspot to speak the Askani language and know of their meditation techniques. When X-Force reconnects with their former teammate Skids, it is discovered that Reignfire is actually a protoplasmic mutant symbiote injected with Sunspot&#x27;s blood. Reignfire is defeated when Sunspot leaches him of his powers, reducing him to his original protoplasmic state which is then claimed by S.H.I.E.L.D.

===X-Force Roadtrip===
Roberto joins the rest of the X-Force on an extended road trip, separating themselves from Cable. Along the way, they have several problems, including Roberto&#x27;s money being tied up in litigation, forcing the team into doing a variety of odd jobs, including providing protection for a small businessman being hassled by the mob. During this time, Roberto has a short fling with Sam&#x27;s girlfriend Tabitha Smith, a teammate.

===Hellfire Club===
Later during his X-Force career, Roberto is approached by Selene of the Hellfire Club. She offers Roberto his deceased father Emmanuel&#x27;s seat in the club&#x27;s Inner Circle, as the seats are inherited. She promises Roberto that she will resurrect Juliana if he joins and he agrees. Selene does bring back the spirit of Juliana, but put it into the body of a comatose girl. Possibly because he feels obliged to fulfill his promise, Roberto decides to stay, becoming Selene&#x27;s Black Rook. Roberto attempts to contact the resurrected Juliana, but seeing she has no memory of her previous life, he decides to leave her alone.

Roberto next surfaces in the title &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; as the head of the Los Angeles branch of X-Corporation, along with former New Mutant Magma and former Hellion Empath. Roberto&#x27;s ties to the Hellfire Club are not severed, as Sebastian Shaw approaches, having taken over the position of Hellfire Club&#x27;s Lord Imperial and wanting Roberto as his Black King. Shaw claims that he is trying to turn the Club into a force of good, so Roberto accepts, though he keeps his involvement with Shaw a secret.

Soon after, Shaw is injured in battle by Donald Pierce. His injuries make him incapable of overseeing the Hellfire Club. Roberto takes over as Lord Imperial. At his side is Sage, who leaves the X-Men to make sure Roberto is not corrupted by the power he wields. After the events of M-Day, Cyclops calls for the shutting down of all branches of the X-Corporation to better pool the resources of the X-Men. In Endangered Species, Sebastian Shaw is thinking of reclaiming his place and is angry at Sunspot.

===Secret Invasion===
During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, Sunspot is among the several X-Men helping to fight off the Skrulls during their invasion of San Francisco.

===Young X-Men===
Sunspot, who remains Lord Imperial of the Hellfire Club, is revealed by Cyclops to belong to the newest incarnation of the Brotherhood of Mutants along with Danielle Moonstar, Cannonball, and Magma. However, while battling members of Cyclops&#x27; new team of X-Men alongside Cannonball, there is confusion after Rockslide makes reference to the two mutants&#x27; membership in the Brotherhood. During the battle, Sunspot is seriously wounded by Wolf Cub, who slashes his face and stomach with his claws. It is eventually revealed that &quot;Cyclops&quot; is in reality Donald Pierce, the former White King of the Hellfire Club, who is posing as the X-Men leader using an image inducer. Pierce&#x27;s reasons for recruiting these &quot;X-Men&quot; is unknown, but it appears that his primary focus is to eliminate the Lord Imperial and he created the ruse that Sunspot and his allies formed a new Brotherhood to convince the former Xavier students to attack their former teachers and allies.

Later on, Sunspot leaves the Hellfire Club and joins the X-Men in San Francisco, as noted by Sebastian Shaw, who is currently looking for a replacement. Cyclops later asks Sunspot and Danielle Moonstar to help train the Young X-Men and both accept.

===Reforming the New Mutants===
After receiving an anonymous tip in Colorado about a young mutant endangering a small town, Dani and Shan are sent to investigate and calm the locals. During their mission, Magik reappears back at the X-Men&#x27;s base in San Francisco after teleporting into the future after the events of &quot;X-Infernus&quot;. Upon her return, she informs Sam and Roberto that Shan and Dani are in fatal danger. Sam assembles a team with Sunspot, Magma, and Magik to go find them. Sam and Roberto come across a tied-up and comatose Shan in the back of a bar, while Magik and Magma are tricked into freeing Legion from a box, who apparently has Shan&#x27;s personality imprisoned inside of him. Roberto and Sam approach Shan&#x27;s body but when Roberto gets too close he almost gets pulled into Legion&#x27;s mind. After they leave the bar, they find they&#x27;re surrounded by police; Roberto and Sam fly away to the jail to find Dani.

When they arrive, Legion is trying to kill Dani. After Roberto and Sam repel him, Legion comes back and Roberto fights him. Cannonball soon joins him and they fend Legion off and regroup. During the fight, Legion takes on Magma, Cannonball, and Roberto, who gets seriously injured when Legion slashes him with a shard of metal.

===Avengers===
After the events of &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot;, Roberto and Sam are offered membership in the Avengers by Captain America and accept. The two become involved in a time travel plot involving the Next Avengers, children of the Avengers from an alternate future, but their memories of this event are wiped by Maria Hill.

During an eight-month time-skip, Roberto engages in a hostile takeover of Advanced Idea Mechanics and gets rid of the villainous upper management. He uses the resources of A.I.M. to intervene in the conflict between the forces of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Illuminati, while also sending a team of Avengers to deal with the multiversal threat of the Incursions.

===New Avengers===
After the events of &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, Roberto re-tools A.I.M. into Avengers Idea Mechanics, hiring various superheroes as a new Avengers team consisting of Hawkeye, Songbird, Squirrel Girl, Hulking, Wiccan, Power Man and White Tiger. S.H.I.E.L.D. sends two operatives, Dum Dum Dugan and Hawkeye, to keep on eye on the team. Despite orders to spy on the new A.I.M., both men reveal their mission, as they have come to respect Sunspot. His new team faces off against W.H.I.S.P.E.R., an organization run by the Maker, the Ultimate Universe&#x27;s version of Reed Richards. The Maker&#x27;s plans cause trouble for the Avengers all along the time stream.

During the events of &quot;&quot;, Roberto orders his Avengers team to free Rick Jones from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. In response, the American government sends the American Kaiju to attack A.I.M. Island. Roberto, having seen this coming, has the island evacuated, and the American Kaiju are depowered by Avenger-5, a giant mech suit. As a result, Maria Hill decides to try and shut down A.I.M., at the same time the Maker launches his own attack. However, Roberto also sees these attacks coming, aided by Songbird playing double agent, and manipulates both sides so that W.H.I.S.P.E.R. is destroyed and the Maker imprisoned. It is also revealed that Roberto has become exposed to a cloud of terrigen mist, which is toxic to Mutants, and every use of his powers now accelerates Roberto&#x27;s aging. With the Maker captured, Roberto strikes a deal with the U.S. government to round up the remaining rogue branches of A.I.M. The operation is successful. In the middle of this, Roberto presents Wiccan and Hulkling with a parting gift of an expensive apartment.

===U.S.Avengers===
Following the deal that would get the Avengers Idea Mechanics to merge with the U.S. government as the American Intelligence Mechanics, Sunspot leads the U.S.Avengers under the alias of Citizen V. Their first mission takes place at the Secret Empire&#x27;s floating volcanic island base. Red Hulk crash-lands into the floating volcanic island base, destroying it. The team is approached by a future version of Danielle Cage as Captain America, who tells them that her nemesis, the Golden Skull, came to their timeline to steal all its wealth. In Miami, Florida, the team crash a charity gala only to discover that the wealthy CEOs were kidnapped and replaced by robots. During the battle, the team manages to defeat and capture the Golden Skull. Danielle then goes back to her timeline with the Golden Skull as her prisoner. Sunspot sends Red Hulk to confront and defeat an out-of-control American Kaiju, who was attacking Europe.

During the &quot;Opening Salvo&quot; part of the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Captain America, whose memory has been altered by Red Skull&#x27;s clone using the powers of Kobik, has a meeting with Roberto and tells him that he is no longer in charge of the team. Roberto then sees footage of the supervillain attacks in Manhattan, deep space, and in Europe. Roberto assembles the team but is attacked by one of his scientists who has allied with Hydra. He&#x27;s later seen in a prison cell, nearly dead, by Red Hulk and Toni Ho. Toni heals Roberto just in time when Hydra soldiers show up at their cell. Roberto uses his powers to defeat the guards and free Red Hulk from the nanites controlling him, taking control of the prison. In the aftermath, Roberto, during a meeting with the team&#x27;s new congressional liaison in the White House, resigns from his position despite objections from the senator. He meets Izzy Kane, Cannonball&#x27;s wife, who tells him that Cannonball, who went missing in action during the takeover and was presumed dead, is still alive on another planet.

While travelling through space, Smasher and the U.S.Avengers are attacked by space pirates known as warpjackers. After a brief fight, the pirates tell them that Glenbrook is actually a planet named Kral X ruled by the ruthless Ritchie Redwood. Arriving on Kral X, the heroes help Cannonball and the planet&#x27;s rebels overthrow Redwood, and head home.

On return to Earth, Roberto redubs himself Citizen X. He assists Agent Jimmy Woo with his investigations into the mysterious Eternity Mask.

===The War of the Realms===
After the Age of X-Man sends most X-Men members to an alternate reality, Sunspot reappears to assist Mirage and the remaining X-Men in repelling Malekith&#x27;s invasion of Midgard. In a ploy to allow Magik to teleport the invading horde to Limbo, he breaks a cursed amulet blocking Mirage&#x27;s powers, and in doing so, is vaporized, joining the fallen Valkyries in their journey to the afterlife.

===Dawn of X===
Roberto is resurrected on the newly established Mutant nation of Krakoa. He invites Cannonball, still living in Shi&#x27;ar space, to join him, and talks several of the New Mutants into accompanying him.

Later at the Hellfire Gala, Sunspot, disappointed at not having been chosen to join the X-Men team, decides after a few drinks with friends to create a new, secret team.

Sunspot is contacted by Lady Deathbird about a threat to Empress Xandra&#x27;s life. Sunspot has saying he is the leader of the X-Men and the Empress needs their help. Sunspot tells Cannonball that he wants to create a team and already has its members lined up: himself, Cannonball, Banshee, Boom-Boom, Armor, Tempo, Marrow, and Strong Guy. After this new team and Forge accept the mission, Sunspot reveals that it is for The Shi&#x27;ar Empress. Sunspot and Cannonball meet with Gladiator, who reveals that many people have betrayed the Empress because she is considered too young to lead. They also tell the team that Deathbird and the Empress are missing. Sunspot leads his team into space, and Forge makes them matching outfits. During their travels, they are attacked by Sidri bounty hunters, but Banshee repels them. Forge creates an algorithm to find Deathbird&#x27;s ship. Using Tempo&#x27;s powers, they can run the program thousands of times in a few minutes. The group arrives on the planet and meets with the Empress, Deathbird, and two advisors. After a brief talk, they are attacked, and Deathbird is hit with a teleport mine. Sunspot, upset that his target was hurt, uses his ability to destroy the ship of his assailants. As the Secret X-Men leave, the Empress erases their memories of Deathbird&#x27;s disappearance.

==Powers and abilities==

Sunspot is a mutant whose cells have the ability to absorb solar energy and convert it for use as physical strength. He is also able to create thermal updrafts for flight, project heat and light, and create concussive blasts of solar energy. At will, he is able to take on a superhuman form that is entirely nonreflective black, save for his eyes and teeth which turn a solid bright white. The color black optimizes solar absorption, but he absorbs solar power at all times, not only in his &quot;powered up&quot; form. If he has not absorbed sufficient amounts of solar energy in normal form, he will be too weak to &quot;power up&quot;. Likewise, when not in direct sunlight, use of his superhuman strength rapidly exhausts the stores of energy within his body.

In his solar form, Sunspot has a corona effect, an aura that has been depicted in multiple ways, though two predominant conventions exist for its portrayal: the air close to him manifests black globes of various sizes, reminiscent of Kirby dots, or his aura is a unified field glowing bright yellow or white. Although Sunspot can absorb energy from stars and reflected solar energy from the Moon, the amounts that reach him on Earth are too minuscule to add significantly to his power. In other regions, such as Asgard, his power is significantly enhanced, allowing him - with much effort - to lift Volstagg off the ground for a few seconds before suffering a backache.

Originally, Sunspot&#x27;s superhuman power was limited solely to superhuman strength and enhanced durability, and only in his solar form. Unlike many superhumanly strong heroes, Sunspot&#x27;s physical resistance to impact only increased somewhat when he employed his superhuman strength, and he was not bulletproof. The phrase, &quot;Careful Bobby, you&#x27;re strong, not invulnerable!&quot; or variations was seen many times. Sunspot&#x27;s powers have radically changed and grown since the character was introduced; he can now withstand the force of a speeding eighteen-wheeler traveling at speeds of 100 mph, and survived an A.I.M explosive charge attached to his side.

Sunspot maintained his original powers for roughly the first ten years of his appearances, remaining a super strong but vulnerable individual throughout the entire &quot;New Mutants&quot; series. During the mid-1990s in &quot;X-Force&quot; his powers begin to change, under writer Fabian Nicieza. Nicieza had the supervillain Gideon capture Roberto and subject him to experimentation where the limits of his power absorption are tested by feeding him immense amounts of solar power. Sunspot is rescued by X-Force, but the overload permanently alters his powers so he is able to release concussive blasts of solar energy, with considerable heat and light projection; this experimentation also makes him immune to all types of heat and fire. He can also absorb other forms of energy; such as heat, light or radiation in a manner similar to photo/radio- or thermokinesis. Sunspot has some capacity to manipulate light-based energy effects, but it remains a largely unexplored aspect of his mutant power.

In &quot;X-Force&quot; #28, Sunspot uses the concussive solar blasts as a means of propulsion, flying by blasting in the opposite direction of where he wants to go – initially he leaves a slight trail behind him, but in later years, he learns to use the propulsion more subtly – appearing to hover in place with no blast wake at all other than his usual &quot;powered up&quot; corona effect. His capacity to fly has similarly been enhanced as he is able to breach planetary orbit and reach Saturn&#x27;s belt with relative ease.

Sunspot has the rituals and ideas of the Askani inside his head, due to telepathic contact with Cable. He is strongly influenced by this for a while, but the memories seem to fade.

His non-superhuman abilities include business administration; he owns and runs a multibillion-dollar international conglomerate. He is an Olympic-class athlete as the result of being trained in combat by the X-Men and Cable. He is fluent in many languages and has other minor talents such as piloting aircraft. He was trained in swordsmanship by the Gladiators, and is also an excellent soccer player.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
Sunspot was in the X-Ternals with Jubilee, Strong Guy, and Gambit. They take money from Apocalypse and give it to the poor. Magneto sends them to the Shi&#x27;ar Galaxy to steal the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal. Sunspot dies after absorbing too much energy in an attempt to help his teammates escape.

===Days of Future Past===
In an alternate future in &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;, a war between mutants and humans, started by the latter, results in a mutant victory thanks to an alliance between Xavier&#x27;s Institute and the Hellfire Club. Magma and Sunspot become the Chief Arbitrators of the Lords Cardinal, and create an idyllic state for mutants, while regular humans are left to fend for themselves. Mutants born to humans are taken from their parents and those who oppose Magma and Sunspot are brainwashed by the Hellfire Club&#x27;s agents.

===Days of Future Now===
In this reality, Sunspot is the leader of the Gene Nation.

===Mutant X===
Sunspot is part of a murderous team of &#x27;Marauders&#x27;, which consists of Jubilee, Wolfsbane, Cannonball, and Husk.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel version of Sunspot is an angry vigilante. Originally coming from Harlem in this continuity, he sees the X-Men as decadent Uncle Tom figures and accuses them of living in an ivory tower, considering themselves separate from &quot;second-class muties&quot; like himself. He harbors a deep hatred for Magneto and his followers because of the anti-mutant hysteria that followed the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s destruction at the hands of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

He joins Emma Frost&#x27;s Academy of Tomorrow, a school for gifted beings. Initially, Roberto is confused by his admission as he knows his grades are not impressive. Frost assures him that grades (or mutant powers) do not always classify a person as &#x27;gifted&#x27;. Soon after Roberto is accepted into the school, fellow student Lorna Dane is framed and imprisoned for the murder of several dozen people. He is approached by Alex Summers (Polaris&#x27;s boyfriend) and is convinced to help assist in breaking Lorna out, working with Northstar and Cannonball. The team relies on Roberto&#x27;s knowledge of New York City, but because Roberto had rarely been outside of Harlem, the team gets lost. The X-Men attack them, and Roberto is subdued and removed from the fight.

Magneto has him killed in &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, along with the rest of the Academy of Tomorrow except Havok. He is buried on the grounds of the X-Mansion.

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker traveled to Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. Roberto joined his father in attending a meeting with the rest of Maker&#x27;s Council.

===What If?===
In the What If? story &quot;What if Some of the X-Men Had Stayed In Asgard?&quot;, Sunspot, among other X-Men and New Mutants, chose to remain in Asgard before he is later killed by Hela.

<text>OpenCms is an open-source content management system written in Java. It is distributed by Alkacon Software under the LGPL license. OpenCms requires a JSP Servlet container such as Apache Tomcat.

It is a CMS application with a browser-based work environment, asset management, user management, workflow management, a WYSIWYG editor, internationalization support, content versioning, and many more features including proxying of requests to another endpoint.

OpenCms was launched in 1999, based on its closed-source predecessor MhtCms. The first open source version was released in 2000.

OpenCms is used or has been used by large organizations such as WIPO, the LGT Group, the University of Stuttgart, the Archdiocese of Cologne, or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

== User interface ==
The OpenCms user interface runs in a web browser, placing control elements directly on the web page that is edited. Content on a page can be modified by drag and drop. Text can be edited &quot;inline&quot; directly on the web page, or in an alternative form based editor.

Web pages and their navigation structure are managed in a dedicated sitemap editor. Content elements are stored in galleries and can be reused between different web pages or web sites. An additional &quot;power user&quot; interface for Administrators provides role and permission management. Since version 9.5 OpenCms offers layout and template creation without coding.
== Technology ==
OpenCms runs on the Java platform as a servlet. It uses several libraries provided by the Apache foundation. The user interface has been developed using Vaadin and the Google Web Toolkit.

The OpenCms content repository is stored in a database, with MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, HSQLDB, Oracle, MSSQL and IBM Db2 being natively supported. It can be accessed with CMIS, WebDAV as an SMB network share or through the native web interface.

Text content in OpenCms is defined using an XML schema. The user interface for the content managers creates XML files based on these schemas, which are stored in the database repository. A template system based on JavaServer Pages then creates web pages from the XML.

== Versions ==
OpenCms has been under continuous development as an open source project since the year 2000. Currently a major version is released every 6 months in April and October. The revision control of the OpenCms source code is done using Git on GitHub. The following table provides an overview of all major OpenCms releases.

<text>Sir James Lancaster (c. 1554 – 6 June 1618) was an English privateer and trader of the Elizabethan era.

==Life and work==
Lancaster came from Basingstoke in Hampshire. 

Lancaster was brought up in Portugal as a merchant and soldier, but returned to England in 1587. He thereafter became a trusted employee of the London merchant Thomas Cordell, commanding his merchant ship ‘Edward Bonaventure’ in the fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, serving under Sir Francis Drake.

===East India activities===
On 10 April 1591 Lancaster started from Torbay in Devon, with George Raymond and Samuel Foxcroft, on his major voyage to the East Indies; this fleet of three ships (&quot;Penelope&quot;, &quot;Marchant Royal&quot; and &quot;Edward Bonaventure&quot;) was the earliest of the English overseas Indian expeditions. They reached Table Bay on 1 August 1591.

Losing one ship off Cape Correntes on 12 September, the squadron rested and refitted at Zanzibar (February 1592), rounded Cape Comorin the following May, and reached the Malay Peninsula having arrived at Penang in June. Here Lancaster remained on the island until September of the same year.

After a later crossing to Ceylon, the crews insisted on returning home. The return voyage was disastrous, with only twenty-five officers and men surviving to reach England in May 1594. Lancaster himself reached Rye on 24 May 1594. His Indian voyage, like Ralph Fitch&#x27;s overland explorations and trading, was an important factor in the foundation of the East India Company. In the same year he led a privateering expedition against Pernambuco and Recife in Brazil, aimed at seizing the cargo of a storm-damaged Portuguese carrack which had put in there on its way back from India. Unlike the East Indies voyage, this was (according to Hakluyt&#x27;s account) highly professional in its conduct and very successful; after picking up a chance-met separate squadron under Captain Henry Middleton, he led an assault landing, seized the town and (with the assistance of a flotilla of Dutch traders who also threw in their lot with him) held it for several weeks and embarked the carrack&#x27;s cargo along with local produce such as Brazil-wood (the source of a valuable red dye used in the woollen textile industry).

In 1600 he was given command of the East India Company&#x27;s first fleet (which sailed from Torbay on 22 April, 1601); his vessel was the &quot;Red Dragon&quot;. He was also accredited as Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s special envoy to various Eastern potentates. Going by the Cape of Good Hope (1 November 1601) Lancaster visited the Nicobars (from 9 April 1602), Aceh and other parts of Sumatra (from 5 June 1602), and Bantam in Java. An alliance was established with Aceh, the first English East India Company factory established at Bantam and a commercial mission dispatched to the Moluccas. Lancaster also seized a large Portuguese galleon and looted it. The return voyage from 20 February to 11 September 1603 was speedy and prosperous, and Lancaster (whose success both in trade and diplomacy had been brilliant) was rewarded with a knighthood from the newly crowned James I in October 1603.

Lancaster continued to be one of the chief directors of the East India Company until his death in June 1618. Most of the voyages of the early Stuart period both to India and in search of the Northwest Passage were undertaken under his sponsorship and direction. In July 1616, Lancaster Sound, the entrance to the Northwest Passage, on the north-west side of Baffin Bay (74° N.), was named by William Baffin after Sir James.

===Will===
His will (dated 18 April 1618) established two charitable trusts administered by the Skinners&#x27; Company. One was for the benefit of officials and poor people in Basingstoke, and was subsequently transferred by court order to Basingstoke Corporation in 1717. The other was for poor divinity students at Oxford and Cambridge, to whom the Skinners&#x27; Company still provides grants today.
==Scurvy==
At some point in his travels, Lancaster noted the efficacy of fresh fruit as a preventative for scurvy. 

In 1601 Lancaster performed an experimental study of the antiscorbutic effects of lemon juice. His fleet of four ships departed Torbay in southwest England on 21 April 1601, and scurvy began appearing in three of the ships by 1 August (4 months after sailing). By the time of arrival, 9 September, at Table Bay in southern Africa, the three ships were so devastated by scurvy that the men of Lancaster&#x27;s ship, &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, had to assist the rest of the fleet into the harbor. Lancaster&#x27;s men remained in better health than the men on the other ships because every morning he gave them three spoonfuls of bottled lemon juice that he had taken to sea. Lancaster would spend much of his time in Madagascar, where he would retrieve more lemon juice, and other citrus to treat his men. 

The Admiralty received Lancaster&#x27;s report. In 1795 – nearly 200 years later and after countless, unnecessary deaths – the Admiralty finally mandated lemon juice for all sailors.
