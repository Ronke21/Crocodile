<text>The Heckler &amp; Koch MK 23, MK 23 MOD 0, Mark 23, or USSOCOM MARK 23 is a semi-automatic large-frame pistol chambered in .45 ACP, designed specifically to be an offensive pistol. The USSOCOM version of the MK23 came paired with a laser aiming module (LAM) and suppressor. The USSOCOM MK23 was adopted by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for special operations units, beating out the nearest competitor, Colt&#x27;s OHWS. Development of the pistol began in 1991 as special operations representatives identified the need for an &quot;Offensive Handgun Weapons System—Special Operations Peculiar&quot;, and delivery of the pistols began in May 1996 to the special operation units.

While the USSOCOM MK23 designation usually applies to the complete system, it is also commonly used in reference to the pistol component alone. The LAM and suppressor were developed by Insight Technology and Knight&#x27;s Armament Company (KAC), respectively. The civilian version of the MK23 sold by itself is designated the Mark 23.

==Overview==
The MK 23 is considered a match grade pistol, and is capable of making a group at . The MK 23 is designed for exceptional durability in harsh environments, being waterproof and corrosion-resistant. The barrel is manufactured with polygonal rifling, which is reported to improve accuracy and durability, and is much more expensive to produce. It also features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release on both sides of the frame. The magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard, which is wide enough to allow the use of gloves. A decocking lever is on the left side, which will silently lower the cocked hammer. The MK 23 is part of a larger weapon system that includes an attachable Laser Aiming Module (LAM), a suppressor, and some other features such as a special high-pressure match cartridge (.45 +P ammunition).

The firearm was tested and found to be capable of firing tens of thousands of rounds without a barrel change. It remains reliable in harsh conditions, making it suitable for use by special forces. The .45 ACP round is subsonic in the standard loading, making it suitable for use with a suppressor.

==Development==
In 1989, US SOCOM began reviewing their equipment to see which gear fit the needs of their special close quarters battle role. Studying small arms revealed that there were 120 types and configurations of infantry weapons in different units. The logistics of getting spare parts for all these weapons was overwhelming. In response, SOCOM decided to standardize small arms among all units. One area of improvement was the pistol, undertaken by the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) competition. It would replace pistols like the 9 mm M9, which was used by regular troops as a secondary weapon. SOCOM&#x27;s use of small units that operate in close means that pistols are more likely to be used as primary weapons.

The caliber for the OHWS was quickly decided not to be the NATO standard 9 mm due to lack of stopping power. The FBI had selected the 10 mm auto to replace their 9 mm pistols, but it was too powerful, few manufacturers produced it, and the round caused short weapon service life. The .45 ACP caliber was chosen and improved upon with the high velocity, high pressure +P loading.

The OHWS pistol had to fire many types of rounds in addition to the +P cartridge and have a long service life with the high pressure ammo. The M1911 had been proven in service for over 70 years, but was rejected. High pressure rounds would destroy it and it did not fire reliably with a suppressor. Upgrading the M1911 would cost more than it was worth, so it was decided that they would select an entirely new design. A request for quote was for a system that included a pistol, suppressor, and laser aiming module. The pistol had to be corrosion resistant, have a high mean rounds between failures (MRBF), and be able to serve as a primary weapon.

After several tests, Heckler &amp; Koch and Colt submissions were selected to move to phase I of the OHWS program in August 1991. They were awarded developmental contracts to produce 30 systems. At the time the program was beginning, HK was studying what aspects were most desirable in handguns for the U.S. civilian market. They came up with a design that had these features including reliability, durability, affordability, and others by February 1991. Colt however essentially drew upon existing technologies for their submission called the Colt OHWS. They used an M1911 frame that could accept a 10-round magazine, the decocking mechanism from the Colt Double Eagle, and the rotating barrel locking system from the All American 2000. The barrel of the Colt OHWS could not directly attach a suppressor, so a mounting was added to a rail in front of the handguard.

Colt was eliminated after phase I, leaving only HK to move on to phase II. This phase subjected the pistols to the strictest reliability testing any pistol ever went through. The requirement was for no less than 2,000 MRBF; the HK OHWS averaged 6,027 MRBF and could reach 15,122 MRBF. Three pistols went through a 30,000-round endurance test and maintained accuracy of at 25 meters; only the O-ring needed replacement after 20,000 rounds. The weapons worked in temperatures from -25 degrees Fahrenheit to 140 degrees Fahrenheit while exposed to mud, ice, and sand. Phase III was the awarding of a production contract to HK in June 1995. Their pistol was type classified as the Mark 23 Mod 0, and 1,950 systems were ordered at $1,186 each. All pistols were produced in Germany and the first was delivered to SOCOM on 1 May 1996.

Even though the Mark 23 had performed admirably, several factors worked against its use. Previous operators were trained to fire multiple 9 mm rounds and they thought firing extra rounds made up for not using harder hitting but larger and heavier .45 ACP rounds. The introduction of the smaller and lighter HK USP, political pressures, and shortages of +P ammunition also contributed against the pistol. As the War on Terror went on, operators saw the effectiveness of the .45 ACP in combat and renewed use of the Mark 23, as well as other pistols chambered for the round.

==Adoption==
The MK 23 MOD 0 was built as an &quot;offensive&quot; handgun for U.S. special operations forces under USSOCOM, per request made in 1989. Military versions of the firearm have the writing &quot;MK23 USSOCOM&quot; engraved on the slide. The first MK 23 production models were delivered to SOCOM on May 1, 1996.

HK commercially markets the MK 23 and derivatives of it, but not the complete SOCOM system. The suppressor is made by Knight&#x27;s Armament Company, and was selected over the one HK originally included as part of its entry. Insight Technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module, later designated AN/PEQ-6. One version of the LAM produces a visible light dot, while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles. There have since been different LAM models and, at least commercially, different suppressors as well. It has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed, but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem.

===Civilian Mark 23===
Heckler &amp; Koch has offered the MK 23 on the civilian market and law enforcement as the MARK 23. It is distributed by its subsidiaries HK Inc. (United States) and HKJS GmbH (Germany).

The models for the U.S. market initially came with a 10-round magazine, to comply with the U.S. Assault Weapons Ban. In 2004 the ban expired, and the civilian Mark 23 comes with the same 12-round magazine as the government variants, except in a few states that enforce their own bans on magazines larger than 10 rounds. In Canada, the Mark 23 pistol is still supplied only with 10-round magazines, as per the 1995 Firearms Act.

According to the &quot;Operators Manual&quot;, there are few differences between the civilian Mark 23 and the government MK 23. These differences are the slide engraving &quot;Mark 23&quot; which is only for the first half of the first year of production in 1996 (KG date code), the roll-mark &quot;MARK 23&quot; which is for mid 1996 to now, these instead of &quot;MK23 USSOCOM&quot;, Matte vs shiny finish for different civilian years, tan vs black frame (500 tan ones were made), and a barrel conforming to SAAMI headspace specifications for the military vs civilian made, as the military barrels were made to allow ball ammunition to work more reliably.

==Alternatives==
In spite of its positive points, the MK 23&#x27;s large size and weight have resulted in some criticism. The handgun was designed for offense rather than defense, the size and weight intentionally incorporated to help absorb recoil forces and retain greater accuracy; but this also decreased its ease of use, comfort, and draw speed in defensive situations which require a more conventional, compact pistol.

In response, HK developed the USP Tactical pistol based on the original USP. The USP Tactical and MK 23 look similar, although they are different pistols by design and purpose, the Tactical retains much of the performance of the MK 23 without the bulky size. It uses a different suppressor (due to 16 x 1mm left handed threading, as opposed to 16 x 1mm right-handed on the MK 23). An even more compact pistol than the USP Tactical for counter-terrorist and special forces use is the HK USP Compact Tactical, which has its own optional LAM. The USP-CT is lighter and is capable of fitting a suppressor, making it a prime choice for Special Forces on covert operations. Recently, HK has developed the HK 45, a much more contoured pistol based on the P2000, P8 and P30 models.

<text>Mat (, &quot;matershchina&quot; / &quot;materny yazyk&quot;) is the term for vulgar, obscene, or profane language in Russian and some other Slavic language communities. 

== Four pillars of mat ==
In 2013, Roskomnadzor compiled a list of four lexical roots, with any words derived from these roots - nouns, adjectives, verbs, participles etc. - of the Russian language which it deemed &quot;absolutely unacceptable in the mass media&quot;: &quot;khuy&quot; (&quot;cock&quot;); &quot;pizda&quot; (&quot;cunt&quot;); &quot;yebat&quot;&#x27; (&quot;to fuck&quot;); and &quot;blyad&quot; (&quot;whore&quot;). Roskomnadzor defined the banned terms as follows: &quot;Obscene designation of the male genital organ, obscene designation of the female genital organ, obscene designation of the process of copulation and obscene designation of a woman of dissolute behavior, as well as all linguistic units derived from these words&quot;.

David Remnick writes that &quot;mat&quot; has thousands of variations but ultimately centers on those four words.

Mat-words were included by Polish publisher Jan Baudouin de Courtenay in the 3rd and 4th editions of the &quot;Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language&quot;, which was printed four times in 1903–1909 (twice) and in 1911–1912, 1912–1914. The inclusion of rude and abusive words became an obstacle to the reprinting of this version of the dictionary in the Soviet Union for censorship reasons.

=== Khuy ===

&quot;Khuy&quot; (), often also written in Latin as &quot;hui&quot; or even &quot;hooy&quot; by Russian schoolchildren/beginners in their English studies, means &quot;cock&quot;, &quot;penis&quot;, or for an equivalent colloquial register: &quot;dick&quot;. The etymology of the term is unclear. Mainstream theories include from Proto-Indo European (PIE) *&quot;ks-u-&quot;, related to &quot;хвоя&quot; (&quot;khvoya&quot;, &quot;pine needles&quot;), attributed to Pederson, 1908. 

From PIE *hau-, related to &quot;хвост&quot; (&quot;khvost&quot;, &quot;tail&quot;), attributed to Merlingen, 1955; from Mongolian хуй (&quot;khui&quot;, meaning &quot;sheath&quot; or &quot;scabbard&quot;). This was the etymology endorsed by the Soviet government and attributed to Maxim Gorky, who claimed it was a loan word, imposed during the Mongol yoke. Alexander Gorokhovski suggests the derivation from the Latin &quot;huic&quot; (lit. &quot;for that&quot;, used on prescriptions for genital diseases) as a euphemism, because the old Russian &quot;ud/uda&quot; (from PIE root *&quot;ud-&quot; meaning &quot;up, out&quot;) became taboo in the mid-18th century. 

The first volume of the &quot;Great Dictionary of Mat&quot; by the Russian linguist and folklorist treats only expressions with the stem &quot;хуй&quot; (&quot;khuy&quot;), numbering over 500 entries; 12 volumes are planned. The word &quot;khuy&quot; also appears in various other Slavic languages with the same meaning and pronunciation but not always the same spelling, such as the Polish &quot;chuj&quot;.

=== Pizda ===
&quot;Pizdá&quot; () means &quot;cunt&quot;. A derivative of this word is the interjection and noun &quot;pizdets&quot;. This word, depending on the situation, can express a vivid form of almost any emotion, ranging from sadness and annoyance (&quot;Pizdets, my girlfriend cheated on me&quot;, or &quot;Pizdets, I missed my flight&quot;), to an expression of joy (&quot;Pizdets, my son has just been born!&quot;) As a noun, it generally denotes an extremely unfortunate event (&quot;This is pizdets, my car has broken down&quot;).

=== Yebát&#x27; ===
&quot;Yebát″&quot; () means &quot;to fuck (somebody)&quot;. This verb usually expresses a unilateral action and requires (or implies) a direct object.The mutual action expressed in English with verbs &quot;to copulate&quot;, &quot;to have intercourse&quot; is rendered in mat by the reciprocal form of the verb, &quot;yebát″sya&quot; (): &quot;to fuck each other&quot;. Historically, women have been perceived as sexually submissive, so the verb mostly refers to an action of a man. In modern times it may refer to a woman&#x27;s action, in contexts when she initiates (or plans to initiate) the intercourse or plays an active role. See the wiktionary entry for some figurative uses of the word. 

It can also be used as an objectless interjection (, meaning &quot;Fuck, what a luck!&quot;), or can be used as an intransitive verb meaning &quot;to know&quot;, &quot;to care&quot; ( is translated &quot;Like I know?&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t care}, means &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t care&quot;.). In that latter meaning the word can only be used with implicit or explicit negation - one cannot say &quot;я ебу&quot; to convey the meaning of &quot;I know&quot; or &quot;I care&quot;.

=== Blyád&#x27; ===

&quot;Blyád&quot;&#x27; () means &quot;whore&quot;. In the Old East Slavic the word блѧдь (блядь in modern orthography) – &quot;blyad&quot;, meaning: &quot;deception, nonsense, insane, adulteress&quot;, is preserved in the Church Slavonic in three meanings: &quot;deception, delusion&quot;, &quot;idle talk, trivia&quot; and &quot;debauchery, adultery&quot;.

To enhance the expressivity, the word may be combined with the non-&quot;mat&quot; insult &quot;suka&quot; (, bitch) to form &quot;suka, blyád&quot; (сука, блядь) especially among Internet users and memes, an approximate analogue for the expression &quot;fucking shit&quot;. The term is popular in the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; video game community in the stylized form of &quot;rush B, cyka blyat&quot;.

== History and use ==
Some claim that the term &quot;mat&quot; derives from the Russian word for mother, a component of the key phrase &quot;Ёб твою мать&quot;, &quot;yob tvoyu mat (fuck your mother). However there is a Russian expression &quot;благим матом&quot; (&quot;blagim matom&quot;) which has no relation to obscenities, and whose etymology is unsure as well.

Obscenities are among the earliest recorded attestations of the Russian language (the first written &quot;mat&quot; words date to the early Middle Ages).

Mikhail Lermontov&#x27;s 1834 &quot;A Holiday in Peterhof&quot; (&quot;Петергофский праздник&quot;) is one example of the usage of &quot;mat&quot;.

The prologue to &quot;Luka Mudishchev&quot;, probably written at some time in the mid 19th century, was often ascribed to Ivan Barkov, an obscene poet who lived in the 18th century:
&quot;Mat&quot; is also used in humor or puns by juxtaposing innocent words so that the result will sound as if an obscene word was used. An example is a Don Cossack song cited in &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot; by Mikhail Sholokhov:

:Щуку я, щуку я, щуку я поймала.
:Девица красная, уху я варила.
:Уху я, уху я, уху я варила. 

Here &quot;Уху я варила&quot; (&quot;I cooked the fish stew&quot;) may be reinterpreted as &quot;У хуя варила&quot; (&quot;Cooked near the dick&quot;) or even &quot;Ух, хуй я варила&quot; (&quot;Ooh, I cooked a dick&quot;).

The contemporaneous use of &quot;mat&quot; is widespread, especially in the army, police, blue-collar workers, the criminal world, and many other all-male milieus, with particular fervor in the male-dominated military and the structurally similar social strata. An article by Victor Erofeyev (translated by Andrew Bromfeld) analyzing the history, overtones, and sociology of mat appeared in the 15 September 2003 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

In the context of the Russo-Ukrainian War, two mat phrases were popularized internationally: &quot;Putin khuylo!&quot; and &quot;Русский военный корабль, иди нахуй&quot; (&quot;Russian warship, go fuck yourself&quot;), as expressions of the Ukrainian defiance.

===Legal issues===
In the Soviet Union obscenity was censored in print and in the media, and could be prosecuted as petty hooliganism when used in public places. With the collapse of the Soviet Union censorship of mat stopped, and a number of writers, singers, and actors started using taboo-shattering &quot;mat&quot; in their works. For example, the singer Sergey &quot;Shnur&quot; Shnurov is notorious of using mat in his songs.

In 2013 &quot;mat&quot; has been banned in Russia in all mass media, printed and electronic. Since July 1, 2014, &quot;mat&quot; has been banned in Russia from all movies, theatrical productions, and concerts. 

In modern Russia, since the times of the Soviet Union, the use of obscenities in public aggravates a disorderly conduct and may lead to its qualification as petty hooliganism, punishable under article 20.1.1 of the Offences Code of Russia, although there was no clear legal definition what exactly constitutes an obscenity.

<doc id="595511" wikidata="Q141526" url="?curid=595511" title="Larry Thompson (lawyer)">
<text>Larry Dean Thompson (born November 15, 1945) is an American lawyer and law professor, who served as deputy Attorney General of the United States under United States President George W. Bush until August 2003.

== Early life and education ==
Thompson, the son of a railroad laborer, was born and raised in Hannibal, Missouri. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree, graduating &quot;cum laude&quot;, from Culver-Stockton College in 1967, his master&#x27;s degree from Michigan State University in 1969, and his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Michigan in 1974.

In 1970, Thompson married Brenda Anne Taggart. They have two sons.

== Corporate career ==
Thompson worked as an industrial relations representative for Ford Motor Company during law school. After graduation he worked as an attorney for Monsanto Company in St. Louis until 1977. That year he joined the law firm of King &amp; Spalding in Atlanta, Georgia. He left the firm in 1982 for four years with the Justice Department, then returned and was made a partner in 1986. In 1991, as a member of the legal team for Clarence Thomas, Thompson &quot;was among those who devised a strategy to portray Judge Thomas&#x27;s accuser, Anita F. Hill, as suffering from erotomania.&quot; He left King &amp; Spalding in 2001 to go back to the Justice Department as Deputy Attorney General.

== U.S. government service==
From 1982 to 1986, he served as U.S. attorney for the northern District of Georgia, and led the Southeastern Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes him as &quot;a moderate&quot; who is &quot;respected by both Democrats and Republicans.&quot;

=== Independent Counsel ===
Thompson served as Independent Counsel for the Department of
Housing and Urban Development Investigation from 1995 to 1998, completing an investigation and prosecution started by Judge Arlin Adams in 1990.

=== Deputy U.S. Attorney General ===
In 2001, Thompson was appointed as Deputy U.S. Attorney General by President Bush. At the time of his appointment he was a member of the Federalist Society.

==== Thompson Memorandum ====
In January 2003 Thompson issued an internal Justice Department document informally titled the &quot;Thompson Memorandum&quot; written to help federal prosecutors decide whether to charge a corporation, rather than or in addition to individuals within the corporation, with criminal offenses. The guidelines were considered tough because they require that to claim cooperation, companies must (1) turn over materials from internal investigations, (2) waive attorney–client privilege, and (3) not provide targeted executive with company-paid lawyers. The guidelines were criticized for, among other things, &quot;seriously eroding&quot; attorney-client privilege. These guidelines were &quot;eased&quot; in December 2006 by Deputy Attorney General Paul J. McNulty who issued a revised version of the memorandum.

== Career after Department of Justice ==

In August 2003 Thompson left the Justice Department and was a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution for a year before accepting the position of senior vice-president for government affairs and general counsel at PepsiCo in Purchase, New York. Since 2011, he has served as the John A. Sibley Professor in Corporate and Business Law at the University of Georgia School of Law, where he teaches corporate responsibility and white collar criminal law, and serves on the school’s Dean Rusk International Law Center Council.

Thompson was named in the press as a leading candidate for Attorney General after John Ashcroft resigned on November 9, 2004. Thompson, if selected, would have been the first African-American ever to head the Justice Department. Instead, Alberto Gonzales was selected as Ashcroft&#x27;s replacement. Later, Thompson&#x27;s name was mentioned as a possible candidate to replace Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor. With the resignation of Gonzales in August 2007, Thompson&#x27;s name again surfaced a candidate for Attorney General. He supported former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the 2008 presidential election, and the American Bar Association mentioned Thompson again as a possible Attorney General or Supreme Court justice during a potential John McCain administration.

Thompson was named independent corporate monitor overseeing compliance reforms at Volkswagen AG for the next three years by the U.S. government on April 21, 2017.

Thompson and his wife Brenda are noted collectors of art by African American artists. In 2012 they donated works of art to the Georgia Museum of Art and endowed a curatorial chair there. An exhibition of the works occurred at the Museum in 2017.

Thompson has been a member of the Board of Curators for the Georgia Historical Society since 2020.

<text>The newsboy cap, newsie cap, gatsby, jeff cap, or baker boy hat (British) is a casual-wear cap similar in style to the flat cap. 

It has a similar overall shape and stiff peak (visor) in front as a flat cap, but the body of the cap is rounder, made of eight pieces, fuller, and paneled with a button on top, and often with a button attaching the front to the brim (as the flat cap sometimes has).

==History==
The style was popular in Europe and North America in the early 20th century among both boys and adult men. As the name suggests, this headwear was predominately worn by working-class boys, especially newspaper boys. The style was also preferred by the middle-class businessmen who disliked the bulkiness of top hats, also popular at the time.

Flat caps were very common for North American and European men and boys of all classes during the early 20th century and were especially prevalent during the 1910s and 1920s, particularly among the working &quot;lower&quot; classes. A great many photographs of the period show these caps worn not only by newsboys, but by dockworkers, high steel workers, shipwrights, costermongers, farmers, beggars, bandits, artisans, and tradesmen of many types. This is also well attested in novels and films of this period and just after. Eight-piece style caps are, stylistically, an offshoot of a Scottish tam o&#x27; shanter.

While they were worn by boys and men of all social classes, they were worn by the &quot;upper&quot; classes primarily for leisure activities, and the style became associated with well-to-do country sportsmen, drivers, and wealthy golfers.

==Resurgence==

Although traditionally a men&#x27;s cap, it has recently seen a resurgence as it has become popular with affluent women and fashion houses in the 2000s. It has also become popular among the hipster subculture. Baker boy hats are now seen in many high street retailers. For summer, many girls and women are choosing soft cotton options as the brim offers sun protection. In winter, wool blend baker boy hats are a popular option for those who want to wear a natural material. In 2011, floral cottons became a trend following a renewed interest in home sewing.

Roots Canada outfitted the Canadian Olympic team at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. The outfit&#x27;s most popular item was the red &quot;poorboy&quot; cap (or poor boy cap), worn backwards.

Harry Hibbs, a Newfoundland accordionist, wore this style of hat as his trademark headgear. Brian Johnson of the rock band AC/DC is frequently photographed wearing this style of hat. Athlete David Beckham is frequently photographed wearing his signature baker boy hat from James Lock &amp; Co. WWE Sami Zayn wears this style of hat. &quot;Impractical Jokers&#x27;s&quot; Brian Quinn commonly wears this style of hat in many of episodes. The hat is worn by the Shelby family and their associates in the British TV series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;.

<doc id="595522" wikidata="Q4818607" url="?curid=595522" title="Attorney-General of Australia">
<text>The attorney-general of Australia (AG), also known as the Commonwealth attorney-general, is the minister of state and chief law officer of the Commonwealth of Australia charged with overseeing federal legal affairs and public security as the head of the Attorney-General’s Department. The current attorney-general is Mark Dreyfus, who was chosen by prime minister Anthony Albanese in June 2022 following the 2022 federal election. By convention, the attorney-general is a lawyer.

The attorney-general is one of only four positions in the Commonwealth Government to have continuously been held since federation, along with the prime minister, the minister for defence and the treasurer.

==History==
The attorney-general is nearly always a person with legal training, and eleven former attorneys-general have received senior judicial appointments after their ministerial service.

Billy Hughes was the longest-serving attorney-general of Australia, serving for thirteen and a half years over four non-consecutive terms; this included six years during his own prime ministership.

Historically, the attorney-generalship was seen as a stepping stone to higher office – Alfred Deakin, Billy Hughes, and Robert Menzies all became prime minister, while John Latham, H. V. Evatt, and Billy Snedden were leaders of the opposition. Lionel Bowen was deputy prime minister under Bob Hawke in the 1980s. Additionally, four former attorneys-general have won appointment to the High Court – Isaac Isaacs, H. B. Higgins, John Latham, Garfield Barwick, and Lionel Murphy. Isaacs later became governor-general.

==Role and functions==

=== Role ===
The attorney-general is the minister responsible for legal affairs, national and public security. The attorney-general also serves as a general legal adviser to the Cabinet, and has carriage of legislation dealing with copyright, human rights and a range of other subjects. They are responsible for the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity.

=== Functions ===
Functions of the state and federal attorneys-general include the administration of the selection of persons for nomination to judicial posts and the authorizing of prosecutions. In normal circumstances, the prosecutorial powers of the attorney-general are exercised by the Director of Public Prosecutions and staff; however, the attorney-general maintains formal control—including the power to initiate and terminate public prosecutions and take over private prosecutions.

Statutory criminal law provides that prosecutions for certain offences require the individual consent of the attorney-general. This is generally for offences whose illegality is of a somewhat controversial nature or where there is perceived to be a significant risk that prosecutions of a political nature may be embarked upon. The attorney-general also generally has the power to issue certificates legally conclusive of certain facts (e.g., that the revelation of certain matters in court proceedings might constitute a risk to national security); the facts stated in such certificates must be accepted by the courts and cannot legally be disputed by any parties. The attorney-general also has the power to issue a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; with respect to a case, which authoritatively determines that the state (in whose name prosecutions are brought) does not wish to prosecute the case, so preventing any person from doing so.

=== Relationship with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation ===
==List of attorneys-general==
The following individuals have been appointed as attorney-general for Australia:

Notes
: A member of the Protectionist Party, Higgins served in the Labor ministry of Chris Watson, because Labor had no suitably qualified lawyer in Parliament.
: Hughes took silk in 1909, and became a King&#x27;s Counsel.
: Whitlam served as part of a two-man ministry together with Lance Barnard for fourteen days, until the full ministry was commissioned.
: Prime Minister Paul Keating&#x27;s original choice for Attorney-General in 1993 had been Michael Lavarch, but Lavarch&#x27;s re-election was delayed by the death of an opposing candidate for the seat of Dickson; Duncan Kerr held the portfolio in the interim until Lavarch won the resulting supplementary election. Kerr served as Attorney-General for 26 days. There was no Attorney-General for the eight days between Duffy&#x27;s commission ending on 24 March 1993 and Kerr&#x27;s commission commencing on 1 April 1993.
: Gallagher served as part of an interim five-person ministry for nine days, until the full ministry was commissioned.

== Former ministerial titles ==
=== List of ministers for justice===
== Parliamentary secretaries ==
While previously there existed informal titles for junior ministers, since 1980 they have been officially designated &quot;parliamentary-secretaries&quot;. They have also been titled &quot;assistant minister&quot; and &quot;minister assisting&quot;. Parliamentary-secretaries to the attorney-general are listed below.

In 2022, Matt Thistlethwaite was titled the &quot;Assistant Minister for the Republic&quot; and was tasked with promoting the Albanese government&#x27;s policy of establishing of a republic. However, he was also formally the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General. 
==Attorneys-general of the states and territories==
The Australian states each have separate attorneys-general, who are state ministers with similar responsibilities to the federal minister with respect to state law. For attorneys-general of the various states and territories of Australia, see:

* Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory
* Attorney-General of New South Wales
* Attorney-General of the Northern Territory
* Attorney-General of Queensland
* Attorney-General of South Australia

<doc id="595524" wikidata="Q300701" url="?curid=595524" title="Grand Trunk Road">
<text>The Grand Trunk Road (formerly known as Uttarapath, Sadak-e-Azam, Shah Rah-e-Azam, Badshahi Sadak, and Long Walk) is one of Asia&#x27;s oldest and longest major roads. For at least 2,500 years it has linked Central Asia to the Indian subcontinent. It runs roughly from Teknaf, Bangladesh on the border with Myanmar west to Kabul, Afghanistan, passing through Chittagong and Dhaka in Bangladesh, Kolkata, Kanpur, Agra, Aligarh, Delhi, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Prayagraj in India, and Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Peshawar in Pakistan.

The highway was built along an ancient route called Uttarapatha in the 3rd century BCE, extending it from the mouth of the Ganges to the north-western frontier of India. Further improvements to this road were made under Ashoka. The old route was re-aligned by Sher Shah Suri to Sonargaon and Rohtas. The Afghan end of the road was rebuilt under Mahmud Shah Durrani. The road was considerably rebuilt in the British period between 1833 and 1860.

Over the centuries, the road acted as one of the major trade routes in the region and facilitated both travel and postal communication. The Grand Trunk Road is still used for transportation in the present-day Indian subcontinent, where parts of the road have been widened and included in the national highway system.

The road coincides with the current N1, Feni (Chittagong to Dhaka), N4 &amp; N405 (Dhaka to Sirajganj), N507 (Sirajganj to Natore) and N6 (Natore to Rajshahi towards Purnea in India; NH 12 (Purnea to Bakkhali), NH 27 (Purnea to Patna), NH 19 (Kolkata to Agra), NH 44 (Agra to Jalandhar via New Delhi, Panipat, Karnal, Ambala and Ludhiana) and NH 3 (Jalandhar to Attari, Amritsar in India towards Lahore in Pakistan) via Wagah; N-5 (Lahore, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Lalamusa, Kharian, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, Peshawar and Khyber Pass towards Jalalabad in Afghanistan) in Pakistan and AH1 (Torkham-Jalalabad to Kabul) to Ghazni in Afghanistan.

== History ==
=== Ancient times ===
The Buddhist literature and Indian epics such as Mahabharata refer to the existence of Grand Trunk road even before the Maurya Empire and was called Uttarapatha or the &quot;Northern road&quot;. The road connected the eastern region of India with Central Asia, the terminus of the Khorasan Road.

=== Mauryan Empire ===
The precursor of the modern Grand Trunk road was built on the orders of the emperor Chandragupta Maurya and was inspired by the Persian Royal Road (more precisely, its eastern stretch, the Great Khurasan Road that ran from Media to Bactria). During the time of the Mauryan Empire in the 3rd century BCE, overland trade between India and several parts of Western Asia and Bactria world went through the cities of the north-west, primarily Takshashila and Purushapura (present-day Taxila and Peshawar respectively, in Pakistan). Takshashila was well connected by roads with other parts of the Mauryan Empire. The Mauryas had maintained this very ancient highway from Takshashila to Patliputra (present-day Patna in India). Chandragupta Maurya had a whole army of officials overseeing the maintenance of this road as told by the Greek diplomat Megasthenes who spent fifteen years at the Mauryan court. Constructed in eight stages, this road is said to have connected the cities of Purushapura, Takshashila, Hastinapura, Kanyakubja, Prayag, Patliputra and Tamralipta, a distance of around .

The route of Chandragupta was built over the ancient &quot;Uttarapatha&quot; or the Northern Road, which had been mentioned by Pāṇini. The emperor Ashoka had it recorded in his edict about having trees planted, wells built at every half kos and many &quot;nimisdhayas&quot;, which is often translated as rest-houses along the route for the travelers. The emperor Kanishka is also known to have controlled the Uttarapatha.

=== Suri and Mughal Empires ===
Sher Shah Suri, the medieval ruler of the Sur Empire, took to repair The Chandragupta&#x27;s Royal Road in the 16th century. The old route was further rerouted at Sonargaon and Rohtas and its breadth increased, a sarai was built, the number of kos minars and baolis increased. Gardens were also built alongside some sections of the highway. Those who stopped at the sarai were provided food for free. His son Islam Shah Suri constructed an additional sarai in-between every sarai originally built by Sher Shah Suri on the road toward Bengal. More sarais were built under the Mughals. Jahangir under his reign issued a decree that all sarais be built of burnt brick and stone. Broad-leaved trees were planted in the stretch between Lahore and Agra and he built bridges over all water bodies that were situated on the path of the highways. The route was referred to as &quot;Sadak-e-Azam&quot; by Suri and &quot;Badshahi Sadak&quot; by the Mughals.

=== British Empire ===
In the 1830s the East India Company started a program of metalled road construction, for both commercial and administrative purposes. The road, now named the Grand Trunk Road, from Calcutta, through Delhi, to Kabul, Afghanistan was rebuilt at a cost of £1000/mile.

The road is mentioned in a number of literary works including those of Foster and Rudyard Kipling. Kipling described the road as: &quot;Look! Look again! and chumars, bankers and tinkers, barbers and bunnias, pilgrims – and potters – all the world going and coming. It is to me as a river from which I am withdrawn like a log after a flood. And truly the Grand Trunk Road is a wonderful spectacle. It runs straight, bearing without crowding India&#x27;s traffic for fifteen hundred miles – such a river of life as nowhere else exists in the world.&quot;

The ensemble of historic sites along the road in India was submitted to the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2015, under the title &quot;Sites along the Uttarapath, Badshahi Sadak, Sadak-e-Azam, Banho, Grand Trunk Road&quot;. The Indian sections of the Grand Trunk Road coincide with NH 19, NH 112 and NH 44 of the National Highways in India.
Psephologists sometimes refer to the area around the GT Road as the &quot;GT Road belt&quot; it is also known as Gujarat road sometimes within the context of elections. For example, during the elections in Haryana the area on either side of the GT Road from Ambala to Sonipat, which has 28 legislative assembly constituencies where there is no dominance of one caste or community, is referred to as the &quot;GT road belt of Haryana&quot;.

<doc id="595525" wikidata="Q27074817" url="?curid=595525" title="African grey hornbill">
<text>The African grey hornbill (Lophoceros nasutus) is a member of the hornbill family of mainly tropical near-passerine birds found in the Old World. It is a widespread resident breeder in much of sub-Saharan Africa and the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula. The African grey hornbill has escaped or been deliberately released into Florida, USA, but there is no evidence that the population is breeding and may only persist due to continuing releases or escapes.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the African grey hornbill in the fourth volume of his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name &quot;Le calao à bec noir du Sénégal&quot; and the Latin name &quot;Hydrocorax Senegalensis Melanorynchos&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognized by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot;. Linnaeus included a terse description of the African grey hornbill, placed it with the other hornbills in the genus &quot;Buceros&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Buceros nasutus&quot;.

The African grey hornbill is now placed in the genus &quot;Lophoceros&quot; that was introduced in 1833 by two German naturalists, Wilhelm Hemprich and Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg. This genus was resurrected in 2013 to contain a group of hornbills that had previously been placed in the genus &quot;Tockus&quot;. The genus name &quot;Lophoceros&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;lophos&quot; meaning &quot;crest&quot; with &quot;kerōs&quot; meaning &quot;horn&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;nasutus&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;large-nosed&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognized:

* &quot;L. n. nasutus&quot; — Senegal and Gambia to Ethiopia, central Kenya, and southwest Arabia
* &quot;L. n. epirhinus&quot; — south Uganda and south Kenya to northern South Africa

==Description==

At in length, the African grey hornbill is a large bird, although it is one of the smaller hornbills. Its plumage is grey and brown, with the head, flight feathers and long tail being of a darker shade. There is a white line down each side of the crown and another down the back which is only visible in flight. Their long curved bills feature a small casque along the upper culmen, which is more prominent in males than females. A dark upper mandible with creamy-yellow mark or horizontal stripe is diagnostic of males, whereas females have tricoloured, red-tipped mandibles. The plumage of the male and female is similar. That of juveniles doesn&#x27;t differ much from adults, but their bills are initially uniformly blackish. The flight is undulating. The similarly sized red-billed hornbills occur in similar savannah habitats but have pied plumage.

This conspicuous bird advertises its presence with a piping &quot;pee-o pee-o pee-o&quot; call.

==Distribution and habitat==
African grey hornbill is widespread over much of sub-Saharan Africa. It prefers open woodland and savannah.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
The female lays two to four white eggs in a tree hollow, which is blocked off during incubation with a cement made of mud, droppings and fruit pulp. There is only one narrow aperture, just large enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and the chicks. When the chicks and female outgrow the nest, the mother breaks out and rebuilds the wall, after which both parents feed the chicks.

===Food and feeding===
The African grey hornbill is omnivorous, taking insects, fruit and reptiles. It feeds mainly in trees.

<text>The Nuclear Risk Reduction Center (NRRC) is part of the United States Department of State. Its Russian counterpart in Moscow is the National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center in the Russian Ministry of Defense.

The NRRC was created in 1987 by an agreement between the United States Secretary of State and the Soviet Foreign Minister. Its purpose was to create an additional channel of communication for the prevention of nuclear war, in addition to the Hot Line and diplomatic channels. The NRRC began operations on April 1, 1988. The NRRC is online 24 hours a day and relays information regarding the arms activities of both nations so as to prevent accidental outbreak of nuclear war.

In 2013, the Nuclear Risk Reduction Center was expanded in scope in order to convey inquiries and messages regarding cybersecurity incidents. On October 31, 2016, the channel was used to convey a message demanding an end to Russian interference with the United States Presidential election.

<doc id="595530" wikidata="Q4908149" url="?curid=595530" title="Bill Birch">
<text>Sir William Francis Birch (born 9 April 1934), usually known as Bill Birch, is a New Zealand retired politician. He served as Minister of Finance from 1993 to 1999 in the fourth National Government.

==Early life==
Birch was born in Hastings on 9 April 1934, the son of Charles and Elizabeth Birch. He was educated at Hamilton&#x27;s Technical High School and through Wellington Technical Correspondence School. He was trained as a surveyor, and established a business in Pukekohe, a small town south of Auckland. Birch quickly became involved in various Pukekohe community organisations. He served on Pukehohe&#x27;s borough council from 1965 to 1974, and was deputy mayor from 1968 to 1974.

In 1953, Birch married Rosa Mitchell, and the couple went on to have four children.

==Member of Parliament==



Birch first entered parliament in the and would remain an MP for the next twenty-seven years.

At first, Birch stood in , succeeding the retiring National Party MP and Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives Alf Allen. The seat had once been held by Prime Minister William Massey. Its name and shape changed regularly as required by post-New Zealand census boundary adjustments. Over Birch&#x27;s career, the extreme borders of his electorate sometimes extended as far as north as Beachlands, as far west as Pirongia Mountain and as far east as Thames (though never all at once). However, no matter the name, Birch&#x27;s electorate always included the town of Pukekohe.

After his retirement in 1999, he was succeeded by Paul Hutchison as MP for Port Waikato.

===Third National Government, 1975–1984===
Birch&#x27;s initial term of Parliament was in Opposition, but under leader and finance spokesperson Robert Muldoon, the National Party won the following three elections and formed the Third National Government. After holding a number of internal National Party positions in his first six years as an MP, including senior whip from 1976 to 1979, Birch was made Minister of National Development, Minister of Energy, and Minister of Science and Technology when National won its second term in government at the 1978 election.

As a minister in the Third National Government, Birch supported the Government&#x27;s dawn raids against overstayers, which disproportionately targeted the Pasifika community. In response the Polynesian Panthers activist group staged &quot;counter raids&quot; on the homes of Birch and the Minister of Immigration Frank Gill, surrounding them with light and chanting with megaphones. As Minister of Energy during the 1979 oil crisis, Birch oversaw the introduction of temporary petrol demand reduction measures including carless days and the ban on petrol sales during weekends.

After the 1981 election, he swapped the Science and Technology role for the Regional Development portfolio. As Minister for National Development, Birch was closely involved in the Think Big project, a series of high-cost programmes designed to reduce New Zealand&#x27;s dependence on imported fuel. When National lost the , Birch&#x27;s ministerial career was interrupted, but he remained in parliament.

===Opposition, 1984–1990===
Muldoon kept Birch on in the Energy and National Development portfolios when he announced his shadow cabinet in July 1984. He then was one of four ex-ministers who challenged Muldoon for the leadership of the party which resulted in Jim McLay becoming leader. McLay promoted Birch to replace Muldoon in the finance portfolio and third rank in the party caucus. McLay later dumped Birch as finance spokesman in an attempt to &quot;rejuvenate&quot; the party and instead allocated him the job of spokesperson for Labour and Employment and the twelfth rank. This motivated Birch to support a successful challenge to McLay a month later. Under new leader Jim Bolger, Birch returned to his position as third-ranked in caucus and retained the Labour and Employment portfolios. In the second opposition term, from 1987 to 1990, he was additionally the spokesperson for immigration and state services.

===Fourth National Government, 1990–1996===
After National regained power in the , Birch re-entered cabinet as part of the fourth National government. Over the next three years, he was to hold a number of ministerial roles, including Minister of Labour, Minister of Immigration, Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Minister of Employment, Minister of Health, Minister of State Services, and Minister responsible for the ACC. As Minister of Labour, Birch introduced the Employment Contracts Act, which radically liberalised the labour market, most noticeably by reducing the power of trade unions by removing their monopoly on worker representation.

In 1992, Birch was made a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, an honour reserved for senior New Zealand politicians. Between 1992 and 1996 Birch was known as the &quot;Minister of Everything&quot; in acknowledgement that Prime Minister Jim Bolger relied heavily on Birch&#x27;s capacity and ability for resolving problems.

During this period, Birch clashed a number of times with the controversial Minister of Finance, Ruth Richardson. The Prime Minister, Jim Bolger, had never been a supporter of Richardson&#x27;s strong laissez-faire policies, and preferred the more conservative Birch for the Finance portfolio. At the , which National nearly lost, Bolger chose for Birch to replace Richardson as Minister of Finance.

Birch&#x27;s appointment to the Finance portfolio raised eyebrows, given Birch&#x27;s association with the Think Big projects. However, he soon developed a reputation for a frugal finance minister, delivering a succession of balanced budgets. He also privatised a number of state assets.

===National-New Zealand First Coalition Government, 1996–1999===
After the , National needed to form a coalition with the New Zealand First party in order to govern. New Zealand First&#x27;s leader, Winston Peters, insisted on control of the Finance role as part of the coalition agreement, and National eventually agreed. The Minister of Finance role was split into two separate offices. The senior position was given the title &quot;Treasurer&quot; and was assigned to Peters; Birch retained the title of Minister of Finance and its remaining responsibilities. Some, however, have voiced the opinion that whatever the official arrangement may have been, Birch still performed most of the job&#x27;s key functions. Mike Moore of the Labour Party commented that &quot;we are always impressed when Winston Peters answers questions, because Bill Birch&#x27;s lips do not move.&quot;

During the compilation of the coalition agreement between National and New Zealand First, Birch added the proviso to almost every page that &quot;All funding proposals subject to being considered within the agreed spending policy parameters&quot; which essentially rendered every policy agreement provisional, much to Peters&#x27; annoyance. When the coalition with New Zealand First broke down, Birch took over the role of Treasurer. For a short period he held both financial offices until Bill English was promoted to be Minister of Finance, leaving Birch with the senior role. In the middle of 1999, as part of the preparations for Birch&#x27;s planned retirement, Birch and English were swapped. English became the Treasurer and Birch served once again as Minister of Finance.

==Retirement==
Birch retired from Parliament at the 1999 general election. His wife, Rosa, Lady Birch, died in Pukekohe on 22 June 2015.

In 2020 his biography, &quot;Bill Birch: Minister of Everything&quot;, written by Brad Tattersfield was published.

==Honours and awards==
Birch was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, and the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal in 1990. In the 1999 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Knight Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for public services as a Member of Parliament and Minister of the Crown.

<doc id="595531" wikidata="Q911562" url="?curid=595531" title="Ecuadorian sucre">
<text>The Sucre () was the currency of Ecuador between 1884 and 2000. Its ISO code was ECS and it was subdivided into 10 &quot;decimos&quot; and 100 &quot;centavos&quot;. The sucre was named after Latin American political leader Antonio José de Sucre. The currency was replaced by the United States dollar as a result of the 1998–99 financial crisis.

==History==
The Ecuadorian peso was renamed as the &quot;Sucre&quot; on 22 March 1884, and was then linked to the silver standard. The sucre was tied to 22.5 g of fine silver (equivalent to 5 LMU francs). Outdated coins were taken out of circulation between 1887 and 1892, with only the silver-backed coins remaining in circulation.

The decline of the international price of silver during the 1890s prompted Ecuador to switch to the gold standard on 3 November 1898, with the sucre tied to 732.224 mg of fine gold (equivalent to 2 shillings sterling).

The Sucre became inconvertible shortly after World War I began in 1914 due to international political tension. Despite extensive measures to support the Sucre&#x27;s value, the exchange rate continued to rapidly decline. The Sucre&#x27;s exchange rate was eventually stabilized during 1926, at which point Ecuador re-established the gold standard with the sucre equal to 300.933 mg fine gold or $0.20 USD (a devaluation of 58.8%).

Following the suspension of the gold standard on 8 February 1932, foreign exchange controls were adopted on 30 April which fixed the official buying rate at 5.95 per U.S. dollar. Once the price of silver rose above the nominal value of most silver coins during 1930s, Ecuador banned the export of silver on 17 May 1935. This was followed by several adjustments to the nation&#x27;s foreign exchange system as the sucre continued to depreciate. The foreign exchange controls were finally lifted in September, 1937 and the official rate was set at 13.5 sucre per U.S. dollar. The sucre was eventually devalued to 14.77 sucre per USD on 4 June 1940, and controls were once again imposed. The official rate became 14 sucre per USD in 1942 and 13.5 per USD in 1944.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) established the purchasing power parity of the sucre at 13.5 per USD on 18 December 1946. When the IMF adopted a system of multiple exchange rates in 1947, the sucre&#x27;s IMF parity was devalued to 15 sucre per USD by 1950, 18 by 1961, and 25 per USD by 1970.

The Sucre maintained a fairly stable exchange rate against the U.S. dollar until 1983 when it was devalued to 42 per USD and a crawling peg was adopted. Depreciation increased rapidly and the Sucre&#x27;s free market rate was over 800 per USD by 1990 and nearly 3000 by 1995. The sucre lost 67% of its foreign exchange value during 1999; its value nosedived an additional 17% over the course of one week, ending at 25,000 sucre per USD on 7 January 2000.

On 9 January, President Jamil Mahuad announced that the US dollar was to be adopted as Ecuador&#x27;s official currency, although the US dollar had already had wide informal use in Ecuador before this decision was made. The US dollar became legal tender in Ecuador on 13 March 2000, as sucre notes ceased to be legal tender on 11 September 2000. Sucre notes were exchangeable at a rate of 25,000 sucre per dollar at Banco Central until 30 March 2001.

==Coins==
In 1884, cupro-nickel one and a half centavo coins, as well as silver half decimo coins, one and two decimo coins, sucre and half sucre coins were introduced. Centavo coins minted as denominations of the peso continued to circulate after the introduction of the sucre. Copper replaced cupronickel as the material used for the one and a half centavo in 1890, while silver half decimo coins were introduced in 1893. The 10 centavo coin was called a &quot;real&quot;, with the 5 centavo coin known as a &quot;medio&quot; (meaning half). Gold 10 sucre coins were issued in 1899 and 1900.

In 1909, cupro-nickel 1, 2 and 5 centavo coins were issued, followed by centavos in 1917 and 10 centavos in 1918. Production of silver coins was suspended in 1916. In 1928, a new coinage was introduced consisting of a bronze 1 centavo, nickel , 5 and 10 centavos, silver 50 centavos, 1 and 2 sucres, and gold 1 condor. The 1 sucre coin was reduced from 25 grams of 90% silver to 5 grams of 72% silver, while the condor, worth 25 sucres, was equivalent to a U.S. quarter eagle coin. The new coins were dubbed &quot;Ayoras&quot; after the president, Isidro Ayora. In 1937, nickel 20 centavo and 1 sucre coins were introduced, followed by brass 5, 10 and 20 centavos in 1942 and silver 5 sucres in 1943. The last silver coins (2 and 5 sucres) were struck in 1944.

Cupro-nickel replaced brass in the 5, 10 and 20 centavos in 1946, with a cupro-nickel 1 sucre introduced in 1959. 1959 also saw the introduction of nickel-clad-steel 20 centavos, with this metal replacing others in the 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1 sucre between 1963 and 1970.

In 1988, nickel-clad steel coins for 10, 20 and 50 sucres were introduced, while high inflation in the 1990s lead to bi-metallic coins for 100, 500 and 1000 sucres being introduced between 1995 and 1996.

==Banknotes==

The first sucre-denominated banknotes were issued by private banks. The Banco Central del Ecuador (&quot;&quot;) issued provisional notes for 80 centavos and 4 sucres between 1885 and 1887 due to a conversion rate of 5 pesos = 4 sucres for the earlier notes of this bank. Regular notes were issued until 1926 in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 sucres. 1 sucre notes were issued by the Banco Anglo-Ecuatoriano in 1885 and 1886, and by the Banco de Quito in 1885.

The Banco de la Unión issued notes between 1887 and 1895 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 100 sucres, while the &quot;Banco Internacional&quot; issued notes between 1887 and 1894 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 100, 500 and 1000 sucres. The Banco Comercial y Agricola issued notes between 1895 and 1925 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 sucres. The Banco del Pinchincha issued notes for 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 sucres between 1907 and 1924. The Banco del Azuay issued 1, 2, 5 and 10 sucres notes between 1914 and 1924. The Campañia de Crédito Agricola e Industrial issued 2 and 10 sucres notes in 1921. Finally, the Banco de Decuento issued 5 and 50 sucres notes in 1923 and 1924.

In 1926, the Caja Central de Emisión y Amortización was established to effect the transition of currency issues from private banks to a central bank. It issued notes in 1926 and 1927 in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 1000 sucres which were overprints on the notes of private banks.

The first notes of the Central Bank were issued in 1928 in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 sucres. These notes had a gold redemption clause, promising the bearer of the currency its value in gold. (). The gold clause was retained on Banco Central&#x27;s notes until 1939, when the text was modified to &quot;Pagará al portador á la vista CINCO SUCRES&quot;. Additional denominations of 500 and 1000 sucres were authorized in 1944.

In 1949–1950, Banco Central introduced new notes of reduced size (157 × 68 mm) in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 sucres and dropped the phrase &quot;Pagará al portador á la vista&quot;, leaving only the literal numerical value of the presidency. All banknotes circulated since 1928 had been printed by the American Bank Note Company, but Waterlow and Sons were now given the contract for the 5 and 50 sucre notes, which were the first Ecuadorian notes to have a security thread. In the late 1950s, Waterlow was dropped in favour of Thomas de la Rue, which printed 5, 20, 50 and 100 sucre notes, while American Bank Note continued printing 5, 10, 20 and 100 sucre notes. Notes of both printers shared the same basic design, but while American Bank Note used collared planchets as a security device, de la Rue used a metal thread. These notes went through several modifications, and inflorescent security ink was introduced in about 1970. A small-size 1000-sucre note was finally put into circulation in 1973. The next change came in 1975, when the back of all circulating notes was redesigned to show the new national coat of arms. A small-size 500-sucre note appeared at the end of the 1970s.

Beginning in 1984, the title &quot;Banco Central del Ecuador&quot; appears on the notes, without a printer&#x27;s imprint and without &quot;Sociedad Anonima&quot;. As inflation gained momentum, higher denominations were introduced: 5000 in 1987, 10,000 in 1988, and 20,000 and 50,000 sucres notes in 1995.

Notes used during the last years of the sucre (together with 100, 500 and 1000 sucre coins) include:

*S/. 5,000 (Obverse: writer/author Juan Montalvo from Ambato. Reverse: Galápagos tortoise), worth (at dollarization time) US$0.20
*S/. 10,000 (Obverse: Ecuador&#x27;s second (first Ecuadorian born) president Vicente Rocafuerte. Reverse: Independence Monument at Quito&#x27;s main square (Plaza Grande)), worth US$0.40
*S/. 20,000 (Obverse: former Conservative president Gabriel García Moreno. Reverse: Ecuador&#x27;s coat of arms), worth US$0.80
*S/. 50,000 (Obverse: former Liberal president Eloy Alfaro Delgado. Reverse: Ecuador&#x27;s coat of arms), worth US$2.00

<text>Foreclosure is a legal process in which a lender attempts to recover the balance of a loan from a borrower who has stopped making payments to the lender by forcing the sale of the asset used as the collateral for the loan.

Formally, a mortgage lender (mortgagee), or other lienholder, obtains a termination of a mortgage borrower (mortgagor)&#x27;s equitable right of redemption, either by court order or by operation of law (after following a specific statutory procedure).

Usually, a lender obtains a security interest from a borrower who mortgages or pledges an asset like a house to secure the loan. If the borrower defaults and the lender tries to repossess the property, courts of equity can grant the borrower the equitable right of redemption if the borrower repays the debt. While this equitable right exists, it is a cloud on title and the lender cannot be sure that they can repossess the property. Therefore, through the process of foreclosure, the lender seeks to immediately terminate (that is, literally foreclose any future use of) the equitable right of redemption and take both legal and equitable title to the property in fee simple. Other lien holders can also foreclose the owner&#x27;s right of redemption for other debts, such as for overdue taxes, unpaid contractors&#x27; bills or overdue homeowner association dues or assessments.

The foreclosure process as applied to residential mortgage loans is a bank or other secured creditor selling or repossessing a parcel of real property after the owner has failed to comply with an agreement between the lender and borrower called a &quot;mortgage&quot; or &quot;deed of trust&quot;. Commonly, the violation of the mortgage is a default in payment of a promissory note, secured by a lien on the property. When the process is complete, the lender can sell the property and keep the proceeds to pay off its mortgage and any legal costs, and it is typically said that &quot;the lender has foreclosed its mortgage or lien&quot;. If the promissory note was made with a recourse clause and if the sale does not bring enough to pay the existing balance of principal and fees, then the mortgagee can file a claim for a deficiency judgment. In many states in the United States, items included to calculate the amount of a deficiency judgment include the loan principal, accrued interest and attorney fees less the amount the lender bid at the foreclosure sale.

==Types==

The mortgage holder can usually initiate foreclosure at a time specified in the mortgage documents, typically some period of time after a default condition occurs. In the United States, Canada and many other countries, several types of foreclosure exist. In the US for example, two of themnamely, by judicial sale and by power of saleare widely used, but other modes are possible in a few other U.S. states.

===Judicial===
&quot;Foreclosure by judicial sale,&quot; commonly called &quot;judicial foreclosure&quot;, involves the sale of the mortgaged property under the supervision of a court. The proceeds go first to satisfy the mortgage, then other lien holders, and finally the mortgagor/borrower if any proceeds are left. Judicial foreclosure is available in every US state and required in many (Florida requires judicial foreclosure). The lender initiates judicial foreclosure by filing a lawsuit against the borrower. As with all other legal actions, all parties must be notified of the foreclosure, but notification requirements vary significantly from state to state in the US. A judicial decision is announced after the exchange of pleadings at a (usually short) hearing in a state or local court in the US. In some rather rare instances, foreclosures are filed in US federal courts.

A judicial officer supervises the sale and executes the legal papers and deed if any. This may be done by a superior court judge or a referee specially appointed by a court of judicial privacy.

===Nonjudicial===
&quot;Foreclosure by power of sale,&quot; also called &quot;nonjudicial foreclosure&quot;, and is authorized by many states if a &quot;power of sale&quot; clause is included in the mortgage or if a deed of trust with such a clause was used, instead of an actual mortgage. In some US states, like California and Texas, nearly all so-called mortgages are actually deeds of trust. This process involves the sale of the property by the mortgage holder without court supervision (as elaborated upon below). This process is generally much faster and cheaper than foreclosure by judicial sale. As in judicial sale, the mortgage holder and other lien holders are respectively first and second claimants to the proceeds from the sale.

===Strict===
Other types of foreclosure are considered minor because of their limited availability. Under &quot;strict foreclosure&quot;, which is available in a few states including Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont, if the mortgagee wins the court case, the court orders the defaulted mortgagor to pay the mortgage within a specified period of time. Should the mortgagor fail to do so, the mortgage holder gains the title to the property with no obligation to sell it. This type of foreclosure is generally available only when the value of the property is less than the debt (&quot;under water&quot;). Historically, strict foreclosure was the original method of foreclosure.

==Acceleration==
Acceleration is a clause that is usually found in Sections 16, 17, or 18 of a typical mortgage in the US. Not all accelerations are the same for each mortgage, as it depends on the terms and conditions between lender and obligated mortgagor(s). When a term in the mortgage has been broken, the acceleration clause goes into effect. It can declare the entire payable debt to the lender if the borrower(s) were to transfer the title at a future date to a purchaser. The clause in the mortgage also instructs that a notice of acceleration must be served to the obligated mortgagor(s) who signed the Note. Each mortgage gives a time period for the debtor(s) to cure their loan. The most common time periods allot to debtor(s) is usually 30 days, but for commercial property it can be 10 days. The notice of acceleration is called a Demand and/or Breach Letter. In the letter it informs the Borrower(s) that they have 10 or 30 days from the date on the letter to reinstate their loan. Demand/Breach letters are sent out by Certified and Regular mail to all notable addresses of the Borrower(s). Also in the acceleration of the mortgage the lender must provide a payoff quote that is estimated 30 days from the date of the letter. This letter is called an FDCPA (Fair Debt Collections Practices Acts) letter and/or Initial Communication Letter. Once the Borrower(s) receives the two letters providing a time period to reinstate or pay off their loan the lender must wait until that time expires in to take further action. When the 10 or 30 days have passed that means that the acceleration has expired and the Lender can move forward with foreclosing on the property.

The lender will also include any unpaid property taxes and delinquent payments in this amount, so if the borrower does not have significant equity they will owe more than the original amount of the mortgage.

Lenders may also accelerate a loan if there is a transfer clause, obligating the mortgagor to notify the lender of any transfer, whether; a lease-option, lease-hold of 3 years or more, land contracts, agreement for deed, transfer of title or interest in the property.

The vast majority (but not all) of mortgages today have acceleration clauses. The holder of a mortgage without this clause has only two options: either to wait until all of the payments come due or convince a court to compel a sale of some parts of the property in lieu of the past due payments. Alternatively, the court may order the property sold subject to the mortgage, with the proceeds from the sale going to the payments owed the mortgage holder.

==Process==
The process of foreclosure can be rapid or lengthy and varies from state to state. Other options such as refinancing, a short sale, alternate financing, temporary arrangements with the lender, or even bankruptcy may present homeowners with ways to avoid foreclosure. Websites which can connect individual borrowers and homeowners to lenders are increasingly offered as mechanisms to bypass traditional lenders while meeting payment obligations for mortgage providers. Although there are slight differences between the states, the foreclosure process generally follows a timeline beginning with initial missed payments, moving to a sale being scheduled and finally a redemption period (if available).

===Strict and judicial===
In the United States, there are two types of foreclosure in most states described by common law. Using a &quot;deed in lieu of foreclosure,&quot; or &quot;strict foreclosure&quot;, the noteholder claims the title and possession of the property back in full satisfaction of a debt, usually on contract.

In the proceeding simply known as foreclosure (or, perhaps, distinguished as &quot;judicial foreclosure&quot;), the lender must sue the defaulting borrower in state court. Upon final judgment (usually summary judgment) in the lender&#x27;s favor, the property is subject to auction by the county sheriff or some other officer of the court. Many states require this sort of proceeding in some or all cases of foreclosure to protect any equity the debtor may have in the property, in case the value of the debt being foreclosed on is substantially less than the market value of the real property; this also discourages a strategic foreclosure by a lender who wants to obtain the property. In this foreclosure, the sheriff then issues a deed to the winning bidder at auction. Banks and other institutional lenders may bid in the amount of the owed debt at the sale but there are a number of other factors that may influence the bid, and if no other buyers step forward the lender receives title to the real property in return.

===Nonjudicial===
Historically, the vast majority of judicial foreclosures have been unopposed, since most defaulting borrowers have no money to hire counsel. Therefore, the U.S. financial services industry has lobbied since the mid-19th century for faster foreclosure procedures that would not clog up state courts with uncontested cases, and would lower the cost of credit (because it must always have the cost of recovering collateral built-in). Lenders have also argued that taking foreclosures out of the courts is actually kinder and less traumatic to defaulting borrowers, as it avoids the &quot;in terrorem&quot; effects of being sued.

In response, a slight majority of U.S. states have adopted nonjudicial foreclosure procedures in which the mortgagee (or more commonly the mortgagee&#x27;s servicer&#x27;s attorney, designated agent, or trustee) gives the debtor a notice of default (NOD) and the mortgagee&#x27;s intent to sell the real property in a form prescribed by state statute; the NOD in some states must also be recorded against the property. This type of foreclosure is commonly called &quot;statutory&quot; or &quot;nonjudicial&quot; foreclosure, as opposed to &quot;judicial&quot;, because the mortgagee does not need to file an actual lawsuit to initiate the foreclosure. A few states impose additional procedural requirements such as having documents stamped by a court clerk; Colorado requires the use of a county &quot;public trustee,&quot; a government official, rather than a private trustee specializing in carrying out foreclosures. However, in most states, the &quot;only&quot; government official involved in a nonjudicial foreclosure is the county recorder, who merely records any pre-sale notices and the trustee&#x27;s deed upon sale.

In this &quot;power-of-sale&quot; type of foreclosure, if the debtor fails to cure the default, or use other lawful means (such as filing for bankruptcy to temporarily stay the foreclosure) to stop the sale, the mortgagee or its representative conduct a public auction in a manner similar to the sheriff&#x27;s auction. Notably, the lender &quot;itself&quot; can bid for the property at the auction, and is the &quot;only&quot; bidder that can make a &quot;credit bid&quot; (a bid based on the outstanding debt itself) while all other bidders must be able to immediately (or within a very short period of time) present the auctioneer with cash or a cash equivalent like a cashier&#x27;s check.

The highest bidder at the auction becomes the owner of the real property, free and clear of interest of the former owner, but possibly encumbered by liens superior to the foreclosed mortgage (e.g., a senior mortgage, unpaid property taxes, weed/demolition liens). Further legal action, such as an eviction, may be necessary to obtain possession of the premises if the former occupant fails to voluntarily vacate.

===Defenses===
In some US states, particularly those where only judicial foreclosure is available, the constitutional issue of due process has affected the ability of some lenders to foreclose. In Ohio, the US federal district court for the Northern District of Ohio has dismissed numerous foreclosure actions by lenders because of the inability of the alleged lender to prove that they are the real party in interest. The same happened in a Colorado district court case in June 2008.

In contrast, in six federal judicial circuits and the majority of nonjudicial foreclosure states (like California), due process has already been judicially determined to be a frivolous defense. The entire point of nonjudicial foreclosure is that there is no state actor (i.e., a court) involved. The constitutional right of due process protects people only from violations of their civil rights by state actors, not private actors. (The involvement of the county clerk or recorder in recording the necessary documents has been held to be insufficient to invoke due process, since they are required by statute to record all documents presented that meet minimum formatting requirements and are denied the discretion to decide whether a particular foreclosure should proceed.)

A further rationale is that under the principle of freedom of contract, if debtors wish to enjoy the additional protection of the formalities of judicial foreclosure, it is their burden to find a lender willing to provide a loan secured by a traditional conventional mortgage instead of a deed of trust with a power of sale. Courts have also rejected as frivolous the argument that the mere legislative act of authorizing or regulating the nonjudicial foreclosure process thereby transforms the process itself into state action.

In turn, since there is no right to due process in nonjudicial foreclosure, it has been held that it is irrelevant whether the borrower had actual notice (i.e., subjective awareness) of the foreclosure, as long as the foreclosure trustee performed the tasks prescribed by statute in an attempt to give notice.

===Equitable foreclosure===
&quot;Strict foreclosure&quot; available in some states is an equitable right of the foreclosure sale purchaser. The purchaser must petition a court for a decree that cancels any junior lien holder&#x27;s rights to the senior debt. If the junior lien holder fails to object within the judicially established time frame, his lien is canceled and the purchaser&#x27;s title is cleared. This effect is the same as the strict foreclosure that occurred in English common law of equity as a response to the development of the equity of redemption.

===Title search and tax lien issues===
In most jurisdictions, it is customary for the foreclosing lender to obtain a title search of the real property and to notify all other persons who may have liens on the property, whether by judgment, by contract, or by statute or other law, so that they may appear and assert their interest in the foreclosure litigation. This is accomplished through the filing of a &quot;lis pendens&quot; as part of the lawsuit and recordation of it in order to provide public notice of the pendency of the foreclosure action. In all U.S. jurisdictions, a lender who conducts a foreclosure sale of real property that has a federal tax lien must give 25 days notice of the sale to the Internal Revenue Service. Failure to give notice results in the lien remaining attached to the real property after the sale. Therefore, it is imperative the lender search local federal tax liens, so that if parties to the foreclosure have a federal tax lien filed against them, the proper notice to the IRS is given. A detailed explanation by the IRS of the federal tax lien process can be found.

==Contesting a foreclosure==
Because the right of redemption is an equitable right, foreclosure is an action in equity. To keep the right of redemption, the debtor may be able to petition the court for an injunction. If repossession is imminent, the debtor must seek a temporary restraining order. However, the debtor may have to post a bond in the amount of the debt. This protects the creditor if the attempt to stop foreclosure is simply an attempt to escape the debt.

A debtor may also challenge the validity of the debt in a claim against the bank to stop the foreclosure and sue for damages. In a foreclosure proceeding, the lender also bears the burden of proving they have standing to foreclose.

Several U.S. states, including California, Georgia, and Texas impose a &quot;tender&quot; condition precedent upon borrowers seeking to challenge a wrongful foreclosure, which is rooted in the maxim of equity principle that &quot;he who seeks equity must first do equity&quot;, as well as the common law rule that the party seeking rescission of a contract must first return all benefits received under the contract.

In other words, to challenge an allegedly wrongful foreclosure, the borrower must make legal tender of the &quot;entire&quot; remaining balance of the debt prior to the foreclosure sale. California has one of the strictest forms of this rule, in that the funds must be &quot;received&quot; by the lender before the sale. One tender attempt was held inadequate when the check arrived via FedEx on a Monday, three days after the foreclosure sale had already occurred on Friday.

At least one textbook has attacked the paradox inherent in the tender rule—namely, if the borrower actually had enough cash to promptly pay the entire balance, they would have already paid it off and the lender would not be trying to foreclose upon them in the first place—but it continues to be the law in the aforementioned states.

Occasionally, borrowers have raised enough cash at the last minute (usually through desperate fire sales of other unencumbered assets) to offer good tender and have thereby preserved their rights to challenge the foreclosure process. Courts have been unsympathetic to attempts by such borrowers to recover fire sale losses from foreclosing lenders.

One noteworthy court case questions the legality of the foreclosure practice is sometimes cited as proof of various claims regarding lending. In the case &quot;First National Bank of Montgomery v. Jerome Daly&quot;, Jerome Daly claimed that the bank did not offer a legal form of consideration because the money loaned to him was created upon signing of the loan contract. The myth reports that Daly won, did not have to repay the loan, and the bank could not repossess his property. In fact, the &quot;ruling&quot; (widely referred to as the &quot;Credit River Decision&quot;) was ruled a nullity by the courts.

In a recent New York case, the Court rejected a lender&#x27;s attempt to foreclose on summary judgment because the lender failed to submit proper affidavits and papers in support of its foreclosure action and also, the papers and affidavits that were submitted were not prepared in the ordinary course of business. Many borrowers&#x27; attorneys will establish a lender proof of compliance with the 90-day pre-foreclosure notice requirement in order to delay and prolong forecosure proceedings giving the borrower an extra 3 months to clean their record and pay off debt.

==Foreclosure auction==
When the entity (in the US, typically a county sheriff or designee) auctions a foreclosed property the noteholder may set the starting price as the remaining balance on the mortgage loan. However, there are a number of issues that affect how pricing for properties is considered, including bankruptcy rulings. In a weak market, the foreclosing party may set the starting price at a lower amount if it believes the real estate securing the loan is worth less than the remaining principal of the loan. Time from notice of foreclosures to actual property sales depends on many factors, such as the method of foreclosure (judicial or non-judicial).

When the remaining mortgage balance is higher than the actual home value, the foreclosing party is unlikely to attract auction bids at this price level. A house that has gone through a foreclosure auction and failed to attract any acceptable bids may remain the property of the owner of the mortgage. That inventory is called REO (real estate owned). In these situations, the owner/servicer tries to sell it through standard real estate channels.

==Further borrower&#x27;s obligations==
The mortgagor may be required to pay for Private Mortgage Insurance, or PMI, for as long as the principal of his or her primary mortgage is above 80% of the value of his or her property. In most situations, insurance requirements guarantee that the lender gets back some pre-defined proportion of the loan value, either from foreclosure auction proceeds or from PMI or a combination of those.

Nevertheless, in an illiquid real estate market or if real estate prices drop, the property being foreclosed could be sold for less than the remaining balance on the primary mortgage loan, and there may be no insurance to cover the loss. In this case, the court overseeing the foreclosure process may enter a deficiency judgment against the mortgagor. Deficiency judgments can be used to place a lien on the borrower&#x27;s other property that obligates the mortgagor to repay the difference. It gives lender a legal right to collect the remainder of debt out of mortgagor&#x27;s other assets (if any).

There are exceptions to this rule. If the mortgage is a non-recourse debt (which is often the case with owner-occupied residential mortgages in the U.S.), lender may not go after borrower&#x27;s assets to recoup his losses. Lender&#x27;s ability to pursue deficiency judgment may be restricted by state laws. In California and some other US states, original mortgages (the ones taken out at the time of purchase) are typically non-recourse loans; however, refinanced loans and home equity lines of credit are not.

If the lender chooses not to pursue deficiency judgment—or cannot because the mortgage is non-recourse—and accepts the loss, the borrower may have to pay income taxes on the unrepaid amount if it can be considered &quot;forgiven debt&quot;. However, recent changes in tax laws may change the way these amounts are reported.

Any liens resulting from other loans against the property being foreclosed (second mortgages, HELOCs) are &quot;wiped out&quot; by foreclosure.

==Renegotiation alternative==
In the wake of the United States housing bubble and the subsequent subprime mortgage crisis there has been increased interest in renegotiation or modification of the mortgage loans rather than foreclosure, and some commentators have speculated that the crisis was exacerbated by the &quot;unwillingness of lenders to renegotiate mortgages&quot;. Several policies, including the U.S. Treasury sponsored Hope Now initiative and the 2009 &quot;Making Home Affordable&quot; plan have offered incentives to renegotiate mortgages. Renegotiations can include lowering the principal due or temporarily reducing the interest rate. A 2009 study by Federal Reserve economists found that even using a broad definition of renegotiation, only 3% of &quot;seriously delinquent borrowers&quot; received a modification. The leading theory attributes the lack of renegotiation to securitization and a large number of claimants with security interest in the mortgage. There is some support behind this theory, but an analysis of the data found that renegotiation rates were similar among unsecuritized and securitized mortgages. The authors of the analysis argue that banks don&#x27;t typically renegotiate because they expect to make more money with a foreclosure, as renegotiation imposes &quot;self-cure&quot; and &quot;redefault&quot; risks.
Government supported programs such as Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) may provide homeowners the ability to refinance their mortgages if they are unable to obtain a traditional refinance due to their declined home value.

A dual-tracking process appeared to be in use by many lenders, however, where the lender would simultaneously talk to the borrower about a &quot;loan modification&quot;, but also move ahead with a foreclosure sale of the borrower&#x27;s property. Borrowers were heard to complain that they were misled by these practices and would often be &quot;surprised&quot; that their home had been sold at foreclosure auction, as they believed they were in a &quot;loan modification process&quot;. California has enacted legislation to eliminate this type of &quot;dual-tracking&quot; – The Homeowner Bill of Rights – AB 278, SB 900, That went into effect on January 1, 2013.

==Experiences of households post-foreclosure==
A 2011 research paper by the Federal Reserve Board, “The Post-Foreclosure Experience of U.S. Households,” used credit reports from more than 37 million individuals between 1999 and 2010 to measure post-foreclosure behavior, especially in regard to future borrowing and housing consumption. The study found that: 1) On average 23% of people experiencing foreclosure had moved within a year of the foreclosure process starting. In the same time, a control group (not facing foreclosure) had only a 12% migration rate; 2) Only 30% of post-foreclosure borrowers moved to neighborhoods with median income at least 25% lower than their previous neighborhood; 3) The majority of post-foreclosure migrants do not end up in substantially less-desirable neighborhoods or more crowded living conditions; 4) There was no significant difference in household size between the post-foreclosure and control groups. However, only 17% of the post-foreclosure individuals had the same number and composition of household members after a foreclosure than before. By comparison, the control group maintained the same household companions in 46% of cases; and, 5) Only about 20% of post-foreclosure individuals chose to live in households where one person maintained a mortgage. Overall, the authors conclude that it is “difficult to say whether this small effect is because the shock that leads to foreclosure is not long-lasting, because the credit constraints imposed by having a foreclosure on one’s credit report are not large, or because housing services are more inelastic than other forms of consumption.&quot;

==Affected demographics==
Recent housing studies indicate that minority households disproportionately experience foreclosures. Other overly represented groups include African Americans, renter households, households with children, and foreign-born homeowners. For example, statistics show that African American buyers are 3.3 times more likely than white buyers to be in foreclosure, while Latino and Asian buyers are 2.5 and 1.6 times more likely, respectively. As another statistical example, over 60 per cent of the foreclosures that occurred in New York City in 2007 involved rental properties. Twenty percent of the foreclosures nationwide were from rental properties. One reason for this is that the majority of these people have borrowed with risky subprime loans. There is a major lack of research done in this area posing problems for three reasons. One, not being able to describe who experiences foreclosure makes it challenging to develop policies and programs that can prevent/reduce this trend for the future. Second, researchers cannot tell the extent to which recent foreclosures have reversed the advances in homeownership that some groups, historically lacking equal access, have made. Third, research is focused too much on community-level effects even though it is the individual households that are most strongly affected. Many people cite their own or their family members medical conditions as the primary reason for undergoing a foreclosure. Many do not have health insurance and are unable to adequately provide for their medical needs. This again points to the fact that foreclosures affects already vulnerable populations.
Credit scores are greatly impacted after a foreclosure. The average number of points reduced when you are 30 days late on your mortgage payment is 40 – 110 points, 90 days late is 70 – 135 points, and a finalized foreclosure, short sale or deed-in-lieu is 85 – 160 points.

==Recent trends==
In 2009, the United States Congress tried to rescue the economy with a $700 billion bailout for the financial industry; however, there was a growing consensus that the deepening collapse of the housing market was at the heart of the country&#x27;s acute economic downturn. After spending billions of dollars rescuing financial institutions only to see the economy spiral even deeper into crisis, both liberal and conservative economists and lawmakers pushed to redirect an economic stimulus bill to what they saw as the core problem: the housing market. But beneath the consensus over helping the housing market, there were huge differences over who should benefit under the competing plans. Democrats wanted to aim money directly at people in the greatest distress; and Republicans wanted to aim money at almost all homebuyers, on the theory that a rising tide would eventually lift all boats.

In 2010, there was a 14% increase in the number of homes receiving a default notice between July and September. In that year one in every 45 homes received a foreclosure filing and the problem has become more widespread with the increasing rates of unemployment across the nation. Banks have become extremely aggressive without much patience for those who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments, and there are more families entering the foreclosure process sooner than ever. In 2011, banks were on track to repossess over 800,000 homes. In 2010, the highest rates of foreclosure filings were in Las Vegas, Nevada; Fort Myers, Florida; Modesto, California; Scottsdale, Arizona; Miami, Florida; and Ontario, California. The geographic diversity of these cities is made up for by the fact they these are all relatively metropolitan areas. Big cities like Houston, Texas saw a 26% increase in 2010, 23% in Seattle, Washington and 21% in Atlanta, Georgia. These cities had the lowest rates of unemployment. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the cities with the lowest rates of foreclosure were Rome, NY; South Burlington, VT; Charleston, WV; Bryan, TX; and Tuscaloosa, AL. Not surprisingly, these areas had some of the highest nationwide rates of unemployment, helping to further demonstrate this correlation. A quote from RealtyTrac CEO James Saccacio summarizes the recent trends:
“Foreclosure floodwaters receded somewhat in 2010 in the nation’s hardest-hit housing markets. Even so, foreclosure levels remained five to 10 times higher than historic norms in most of those hard-hit markets, where deep fault-lines of risk remain and could potentially trigger more waves of foreclosure activity in 2011 and beyond.”

As per the foreclosure data report of RealtyTrac for January 2014, 1 in every 1,058 homes in U.S. received a foreclosure filing. This figure falls in the higher spectrum of foreclosure frequency. As of August 2014, the foreclosure rate was 33.7%, 1.7% up from the last year. The rise in foreclosure activity has been most significant in New York and New Jersey, the two most densely populated areas in U.S. Closely following them is Florida.

==Impact of foreclosure==

The impact of foreclosure goes beyond just homeowners but also expands to towns and neighborhoods as a whole. Cities with high foreclosure rates often experience more crime and thefts with abandoned houses being broken into, garbage collecting on lawns, and an increase in prostitution. Foreclosures also impact neighboring housing sales on two levels—space and time. For any given time frame, foreclosures have a greater negative impact when they are closer to the property attempting to be sold. The conventional view suggested is that the increase in foreclosures will cause declines in the sales value of neighboring properties, which, in turn, will lead to an extension of the housing crisis. Another significant impact from increased foreclosure rates is on school mobility of children. In general, research suggests that switching schools is damaging for children, although this does significantly depend on the quality of the origin and destination schools. A study done in New York City revealed that students who changed schools most often entered a school with lower, on average, test scores and overall school performance. The effect of these moves on academic performance for individual students requires further research. Foreclosures also have an emotional and physical effect on people. In one particular study of 250 recruited participants who had experienced foreclosure, 36.7% met screening criteria for major depression.

==By country==
===Australia and New Zealand===

Foreclosure has been prohibited by law in New Zealand for well over a century. Instead the mortgagee realises the security through sale, the exercise of the power of sale also being regulated by statute.

In both of these countries statutory reform has altered the manner in which real property dealings are conducted. What is termed a &quot;mortgage&quot; is a legal interest that is registered against the fee simple title of the property. Since in both countries, the Torrens title system of land registration is used, being registered as proprietor or as a mortgagee creates an indefeasible interest (unless the acquisition of the registration was by land transfer fraud). The mortgagee therefore never holds the fee simple, and there is a statutory process for initiating and conducting a mortgagee sale in the event that the mortgagor defaults. In New Zealand, as in England, say, the land title database is now electronic so there are no paper &quot;title documents&quot;.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, foreclosure has been abolished by the Land and Conveyancing Reform Act 2009 but Chapter 4 of Part 9 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 provides for vesting orders that are equivalent to foreclosure but may only be used by NAMA.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
Foreclosure in the People&#x27;s Republic of China takes place as a form of debt enforcement proceedings under strict judicial foreclosure, which is only allowed by law of guarantee and law of property right.

China amended the &quot;Constitution of the Peoples&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; (adopted April 12, 1988), to allow transfer of land rights, from &quot;granted land rights&quot; to &quot;allocated land rights&quot; thus paving the way for private land ownership, allowing for the renting, leasing, and mortgage of land. The &quot;1990 Regulations on Granting Land Use Rights&quot; dealt further with this followed by the &quot;Urban Real Estate Law&quot; (adopted July 5, 1994), the &quot;Security Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; (adopted June 30, 1995), and then the &quot;Urban Mortgage Measures&quot; (issued May 9, 1997) resulting in land privatization and mortgage lending practices.

====Mortgages and foreclosure====
Chinese law and mortgage practices have progressed with safeguards to prevent foreclosures as much as possible. These include mandatory secondary security, rescission (Chinese Contract Law), and maintaining accounts at the lending bank to cover any defaults without prior notice to the
borrower. A mortgagee may sue on a note without foreclosing, obtain a general judgment, and collect that judgment against other property of the mortgagor, without foreclosing. When all other avenues have failed a lender may seek a judgement of foreclosure. Under the &quot;Civil Procedure Law&quot;, foreclosures should be finalized in a six-month time frame but this is dependent on several things including if the mortgager applies to the court for execution of the judgment. Mortgages are formally foreclosed at auction by a licensed auction specialist.

===Philippines===
There are two modes of foreclosure in the Philippines. A mortgagee may foreclose either judicially or extrajudicially, as governed by Rule 68 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure and Act. No. 3135, respectively. A judicial foreclosure is done by filing a complaint in the Regional Trial Court of the place where the property is located. The judge renders judgment, ordering the mortgagor to pay the debt within a period of 90–120 days. If the debt is not paid within the said period, a foreclosure sale satisfies the judgment. In an extrajudicial foreclosure, the mortgagee need not initiate an action in court but may simply file an application before the Clerk of Court to secure attendance of the Sheriff who conducts the public sale. This is done pursuant to a power of sale. Note that these two modes specifically apply to real estate mortgages. Foreclosure of chattel mortgages (mortgage of movable property) are governed by Sec. 14 of Act No. 1506, which gives the mortgagee the right to sell the chattel at a public sale. It has also been held that as regards chattel mortgages, the law does not prohibit that the foreclosure sale be done privately if it is agreed upon by the parties.

===Spain===
Unlike in the United States, where a foreclosure means the end of the line, the foreclosure hearing in Spain is just the beginning of the homeowner&#x27;s troubles. They will have to work for the bank for many years and will be unable to ever own anything—even a car. Spanish mortgage holders are responsible for the full amount of the loan to the bank in addition to penalty interest charges, and court fees. Much of this can be attributed to Spain having the highest unemployment rate in the &quot;euro zone&quot;. Unlike in the US, bankruptcy is not an adequate solution since mortgage debt is specifically excluded. Unlike other European countries, you cannot go to the courts for any sort of debt relief. There has been much contention over these policies in the Spanish Parliament but the government is convinced that keeping these policies will prevent Spanish banks from ever experiencing something similar to the US mayhem. With repossessed real estate properties on their books worth about €100 billion the banks in Spain are eager to get rid of foreclosures.

===South Africa===
For a developing country, there is a high rate of foreclosures in South Africa because of the privatisation of housing delivery. One of the biggest opponents of foreclosures is the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign which sees foreclosures as unconstitutional and a particular burden on vulnerable poor populations.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, foreclosure takes place as a form of debt enforcement under Swiss insolvency law.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, true foreclosures are quite uncommon, with mortgage possession (or alternatively, repossession) being more common.

In the case of mortgage possession or repossession, if the home is sold or auctioned for a price that exceeds the loan balance, those funds are returned to the consumer. Mortgage possession involves legal proceedings in which a mortgagee or other lienholder, usually a lender, obtains a court order for possession of a property, prior to exercising the mortgagor&#x27;s equitable right of redemption. The eviction is carried out by bailiffs. Once the lender has obtained possession, it can then sell the home to recoup any lost arrears. If the proceeds from a mortgage possession are insufficient to cover the loan then the debtor remains liable for the balance, although in most cases this will become an unsecured debt and the mortgage company will be treated on an equitable basis with the debtor&#x27;s other unsecured creditors (particularly if the debtor simultaneously or subsequently becomes bankrupt or enters into a voluntary arrangement with creditors).

By contrast, in the case of foreclosure the mortgage company retains all rights to proceeds from a sale or auction but the debtor is not liable for any shortfall. Courts almost never allow it especially if a large surplus is likely to be realised; furthermore, when a substantial surplus is unlikely to be realised then mortgagees are disinclined to seek foreclosure in the first place since that remedy leaves them no recourse to recover a shortfall. Instead, the courts usually grant an order for possession and an order for sale, which both mitigates some of the harshness of the repossession by allowing the sale while allowing lenders further recourse to recover any balance owing following a sale.

The UK has some pre-action protocols in place. Mortgage companies are required to work with homeowners to arrive at a resolution and it is possible to delay court action (ultimately, enabling many to avoid the loss of their home) in situations where the borrower has enrolled in individual programs or if the borrower&#x27;s income is about to improve significantly with a new job or other measures that would allow them to pay off the arrears. There is no precise parallel to an American short sale, although the UK does have a process known as Assisted Voluntary Sale. An Assisted Voluntary Sale does have some negative credit impact for the consumer, but the adverse effect is less pronounced than one might suffer if the case were to proceed to the courts.

Mortgagors can lose their properties by default on their lease. This could occur where there is unpaid ground rent or unpaid rent on a shared ownership property. In this circumstance the property (or rather the lease) would be subject to forfeiture. Typically, a lender on these properties would pay the ground rent and add it to the mortgage debt to avoid losing their rights to the property.

===Canada (Alberta)===
In Alberta, Canada, there are three steps to foreclosure. First, the owner is behind in mortgage payments but still retains full control of the property. Then, the owner is still on title but has lost control of the property to the Court of Queens Bench of Alberta. Last, the legal title has been transferred by the courts to the banks.

The entire foreclosure process in Alberta can take a year or longer. The original owners try to sell over the value to solve their financial problems. The courts favour the owners over the banks and so rarely sell under value. The banks have the money and so never sell under value.

Foreclosures are also sold as is with no recourse for buyers if something goes wrong. That makes foreclosures generally overpriced and risky.

<doc id="595538" wikidata="Q2028178" url="?curid=595538" title="Cabinet of Australia">
<text>The Cabinet of Australia, also known as the Federal Cabinet, is the chief decision-making body of the Australian government. The Cabinet is selected by the prime minister and is composed of senior government ministers who administer the executive departments and ministries of the federal government.

Ministers are appointed by the governor-general, on the advice of the prime minister, who is the leader of the Cabinet. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. There are several Cabinet committees focused on governance and specific policy issues, with administrative support provided by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The outer ministry consists of junior ministers outside of Cabinet. There are also a number of assistant ministers (designated as parliamentary secretaries under the &quot;Ministers of State Act 1952&quot;), responsible for a specific policy area and reporting directly to a senior Cabinet minister of their portfolio. The Cabinet, the outer ministry, and the assistant ministers collectively form the full Commonwealth ministry of the government of the day. Officials and advisors are not allowed to attend Cabinet, with only Cabinet ministers and the three official note-takers that produce Cabinet minutes able to be present during deliberations. 

The Cabinet is a product of convention and practice. There is no reference to the Cabinet in the Australian Constitution and its establishment and procedures are not the subject of any legislation. The prime minister of the day determines the shape, structure and operation of the Cabinet and its Committees.

Decisions of Cabinet (formally known as &quot;Cabinet minutes&quot;) do not in and of themselves have legal force, requiring the endorsement from individual ministers, holders of statutory office, Parliament or the governor-general as advised by the non-deliberative Federal Executive Council—the highest formal executive body mentioned in the Constitution. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet.

== History ==
Until 1956 the Cabinet comprised all ministers. The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical, and in 1956 Liberal Prime Minister Robert Menzies created a two-tier ministry, with only senior ministers being members of the Cabinet, while the other ministers are in the outer ministry. This practice has been continued by all governments since, with the exception of the Whitlam government.

When the non-Labor parties have been in power, the prime minister has advised the governor-general on all Cabinet and ministerial appointments at his own discretion, although in practice he consults with senior colleagues in making appointments. When the Liberal Party and its predecessors (the Nationalist Party and the United Australia Party) have been in coalition with the National Party (or its predecessor the Country Party), the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right to nominate his party&#x27;s members of the Coalition ministry, and to be consulted by the prime minister on the allocation of their portfolios.

When Labor first held office under Chris Watson, Watson assumed the right to choose members of his cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party (the Caucus), with the prime minister retaining the right to allocate portfolios. This practice was followed until 2007. Between 1907 and 2007, Labor prime ministers exercised a predominant influence over who was elected to Labor ministries, although the leaders of the party factions also exercised considerable influence. However, in 2007 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, assumed the power to choose the ministry alone. Later, the caucus regained this power in 2013. According to reporting by the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, ministerial positions are allocated by the Left and Right factions proportionally according to their representation in the Parliament.

Under two-tier ministerial arrangements introduced in 1987, each senior or portfolio minister was a member of the Cabinet. In 1996 this was modified by the Howard government, whereby two portfolio ministers, one being the attorney-general, were not members of Cabinet, and one portfolio had two Cabinet ministers. In subsequent Howard ministries, and the 2007 Rudd Labor ministry, all portfolio ministers were in the Cabinet.

== Composition ==
Members of both the House of Representatives and Senate are eligible to serve as ministers and parliamentary secretaries. A minister does not have to be a member of either house, but section 64 of the Constitution requires the minister to become a member within three months. The prime minister and treasurer are traditionally members of the House of Representatives, but the Constitution does not have such a requirement. As amended in 1987, the &quot;Minister of State Act 1952&quot; permits up to 30 ministers. As members of one house cannot speak in the other, ministers in each house serve as representatives of colleagues in the other for answering questions and other procedures.

 every government since Federation has had senators serve as ministers. The Senate typically provides one-quarter to one-third of the ministry. Some former senators and others have proposed that senators should not be eligible to serve as ministers, stating that doing so is inappropriate for members of a chamber that act as the states&#x27; house and a house of review and because governments are only responsible to the House of Representatives. John Uhr and Senator Baden Teague state that an advantage of senators serving in ministries is that the Senate can compel them to answer questions about the government.

Since the introduction of the two-tier ministry, meetings of Cabinet are attended by members only, although other ministers may attend if an area of their portfolio is on the agenda. Cabinet meetings are chaired by the prime minister, and a senior public servant is present to write the minutes and record decisions.

Since 1942, every member of the Cabinet has been a member of the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, or the National Party of Australia.

=== Prime minister ===
The prime minister is responsible for the membership of the Cabinet, determines and regulates all Cabinet arrangements for the government and is the final arbiter of Cabinet procedures. As chair of the cabinet, the Prime minister sets the Cabinet’s agenda and determines when and where meetings take place. The Prime minister leads and guides discussion to achieve a collective response; however where a collective decision is not possible, the prime minister’s view is authoritative.

== Principles of operation ==
The Australian Cabinet follows the traditions of the British parliamentary cabinet system. This entails collective decision-making and responsibility, Cabinet solidarity and confidentiality. 

=== Collective decision-making and responsibility ===

The role of collective decision-making reflects the parliamentary tradition that the confidence given to governments by the House of Representatives is collective, rather than towards individual ministers. Similarly, the governor-general, in acting on ministerial advice, needs to be confident that they only give effect to government policy. In practice this means that a decision of the Cabinet is binding on all members of the government, regardless of whether they were present when the decision was taken or their personal views. Issues are debated within the confidential setting of Cabinet meetings so that some form of consensus can be summarised by the prime minister, as chair of the Cabinet, to be recorded in the Cabinet minute.

=== Cabinet solidarity ===
Cabinet collective responsibility is most obviously expressed in the principle of Cabinet solidarity. In governments using the Westminster system, members of the Cabinet must publicly support all government decisions made in Cabinet, even if they do not agree with them. Cabinet ministers cannot dissociate themselves from, or repudiate the decisions of, their Cabinet colleagues unless they resign from the Cabinet. 

=== Confidentiality ===
The principle of collective responsibility requires that ministers should be able to express their views frankly in Cabinet meetings in the expectation that they can argue freely in private while maintaining a united front in public when decisions have been reached. This in turn requires that opinions expressed in the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees, including in documents and any correspondence, are treated as confidential. As such, Cabinet documents are broadly immune from &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot; requests. All Cabinet documents are destroyed once they are no longer needed or at a change of government, with the exception of Cabinet records and Cabinet notebooks which since 1986 are released after 30 years. Cabinet documents are considered the property of the political government of the day, with access by successive governments only granted by request. However, the documents themselves are not legally protected, allowing the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 2018 to publish some Cabinet documents found in filing cabinets whose keys had been lost and subsequently sold at a government surplus auction. The documents revealed the inner workings of recent governments, and were characterised by the ABC as the largest breach of cabinet security in the nation&#x27;s history.

== Cabinet committees ==
As with other Westminster system cabinets, Cabinet committees play an important role in the effectiveness of the Cabinet system and providing avenues for collective decision-making on particular policy issues. As of 2024, the Cabinet committees are:

The National Security Committee (NSC) focuses on major international security issues of strategic importance to Australia, border protection policy, national responses to developing situations (either domestic or international) and classified matters relating to aspects of operation and activities of the Australian Intelligence Community. Decisions of the NSC do not require the endorsement of the Cabinet. The NSC is chaired by the prime minister with the deputy prime minister as deputy chair and includes the attorney-general, the minister for foreign affairs, the minister for defence, the treasurer, the minister for immigration and border protection, and the Cabinet secretary.

The Expenditure Review Committee (ERC) considers matters of regarding expenditure and revenue of the Australian federal budget and the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Decisions of the ERC must be endorsed by the Cabinet. The ERC is chaired by the prime minister with the treasurer as deputy chair and includes the deputy prime minister, the minister for social services, the minister for health, the minister for finance, and the minister for revenue and financial services.

The Parliamentary Business Committee (PBC) considers priorities for the Australian government&#x27;s legislation program and requests to the prime minister for the presentation of ministerial statements. Decisions of the PBC do not require the endorsement of the Cabinet. The PBC is chaired by the leader of the house with the leader of the government in the Senate as deputy chair and includes manager of government business in the senate, the deputy leader of the house, and the assistant minister to the prime minister.

The other committees are the Government Communications Subcommittee, the National Security Investment Subcommittee, the Net Zero Economy Committee and the Priority and Delivery Committee.

== Current Cabinet ==

== Shadow cabinet ==
Led by the leader of the Opposition, the Opposition in parliament appoints from its ranks a shadow cabinet to monitor government ministers and present itself as an alternative government. The portfolios of shadow ministers usually correspond with those of the government. When the Liberal and National parties are in Opposition, the shadow cabinet is appointed by the leader of the Opposition in consultation with the leader of the Nationals. When Labor has been in Opposition, the caucus has elected the shadow ministry and the leader has allocated portfolios. Smaller non-government parties often appoint spokespersons for Cabinet portfolios, but these are not referred to as a shadow cabinet.

<doc id="595541" wikidata="Q1002570" url="?curid=595541" title="Bugis">
<text>The Bugis people, also known as Buginese, are an Austronesian ethnic groupthe most numerous of the three major linguistic and ethnic groups of South Sulawesi (the others being Makassarese and Torajan), in the south-western province of Sulawesi, third-largest island of Indonesia. The Bugis in 1605 converted to Islam from Animism. Although the majority of Bugis are Muslim, a small minority adhere to Christianity as well as a pre-Islamic indigenous belief called &quot;Tolotang&quot;.

The Bugis, whose population numbers around six million and constitutes less than 2.5% of the Indonesian population, are influential in the politics in the country; and historically influential on the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, Lesser Sunda Islands and other parts of the archipelago where they have migrated en masse, starting in the late seventeenth century. The third president of Indonesia, B. J. Habibie, and a former vice president of Indonesia, Jusuf Kalla, are Bugis descent. In Malaysia, the reigning Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia), Sultan Ibrahim and eighth prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, have Bugis ancestry.

Most Bugis people speak a distinct regional language called Bugis () in addition to Indonesian. The Bugis language belongs to the South Sulawesi language group; other members include Makassarese, Torajan, Mandarese and Massenrempulu. The name Bugis is an exonym which represents an older form of the name; &quot;(To) Ugi&quot; is the endonym.

==Etymology==
* Endonym and exonym: The designation &quot;Bugis&quot; is classified as an exonym, referring to a term applied by external groups rather than the community itself. Within their own linguistic and cultural context, the Bugis people identify as &quot;To Ugi&quot; or &quot;To Bugis&quot;. This distinction suggests that the term &quot;Bugis&quot; likely originated from external interactions, particularly during the colonial period, reflecting the influence of cross-cultural encounters on ethnonyms.
* Mythological associations: The origin of the term Bugis has been linked to La Sattumpugi, a central character in the South Sulawesi epic La Galigo. According to oral traditions, La Sattumpugi, a sailor and kingdom founder in Wajo, is believed to have inspired the term &quot;Ugi&quot;, which later evolved into Bugis. Notably, the term Bugis itself is absent from La Galigo, indicating that this nomenclature and associated identity may have crystallised in subsequent historical periods.
* Colonial records: The term Bugis appears in colonial documentation as early as the 16th century, particularly in Portuguese sources. These records highlight the increasing recognition and usage of the term during the era of European colonial expansion in Southeast Asia, reflecting the broader integration of the Bugis into regional historical narratives.

==Origins and antecedents==
===ToaleanPre-Austronesian South Sulawesi===
The earliest inhabitant of South Sulawesi is potentially related to the Wajak Man, of the Proto-Australoid origin. There are a few flake materials found in Walanae River valley and Maros, likely dating between 40,000 and 19,000 BC. The hunter-gatherer culture in South Sulawesi is also known as Toalean culture, and largely based on blade, flake and microlith complex. They are probably of Melanesoid or Australoid stock, hence related to the contemporary population of New Guinea or to Australian aborigines.

In 2015, the remains of Bessé´, a young woman was unearthed Leang Panninge, South Sulawesi. Dated over 7,200 years old, half of her DNA was identified to be connected to the indigenous Australians, the people in New Guinea and the Western Pacific; together with a previously unknown and unique human lineage that diverged approximately 37,000 years ago. Her DNA provided important evidence pertaining to the understanding on ancient human migration.

===The arrival of Austronesians===

Their Austronesian ancestors settled on Sulawesi around 2500 B.C. There is &quot;historical linguistic evidence of some late Holocene immigration of Austronesian speakers to South Sulawesi from Taiwan&quot;which means that the Bugis have &quot;possible ultimate ancestry in South China&quot;, and that as a result of this immigration, &quot;there was an infusion of an exogenous population from China or Taiwan.&quot; Migration from South China by some of the paternal ancestors of the Bugis is also supported by studies of Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups.

Christian Pelras, an anthropologist, hypothesized that the proto-Bugis were potentially arrived from abroad, possibly from Borneo, to the western seaboard of South Sulawesi. Their arrival was largely drawn to control the mineral and natural resources in the hinterland. As the group began to spread towards the interior of the present-day Bugis heartland, they become increasingly diverged from their neighbouring Makassarese, Mandarese and Torajan brethren; simultaneously, the proto-Bugis too would assimilated the former Austronesian tribes in the sparsely-populated area, a process whereby the native populations would gradually adopt the language of the new arrivals. Hence, a redesigned hybrid-identity through ethnogenesis emerged, binding the original elements derived from the indigenous people together with the introduction of revolutionary techniques, items and ideas bought by the new settlers, including weaving, metal arts and theological doctrine. The society however, remains largely divided between two separate classes, the prevailing nobility and the common people.

===Tana OgiLand of the Bugis===
The homeland of the Bugis is the area around Lake Tempe and Lake Sidenreng in the Walannae Depression in the south-west peninsula of Sulawesi. It was here that the ancestors of the present-day Bugis settled, probably in the mid- to late second millennium B.C. The area is rich in fish and wildlife and the annual fluctuation of Lake Tempe (a reservoir lake for the Bila and Walannae rivers) allows speculative planting of wet rice, while the hills can be farmed by swidden or shifting cultivation, wet rice, hunting and gathering.

Around A.D. 1200, the availability of prestigious imported goods including Chinese and South-East Asian ceramics and Gujarati print-block textiles, coupled with newly discovered sources of iron ore in Luwu stimulated an agrarian revolution which expanded from the great lakes region into the lowland plains to the east, south and west of the Walennae depression. This led over the next four hundred years to the development of the major kingdoms of South Sulawesi, and the social transformation of chiefly societies into hierarchical proto-states.

==History==
===Early society===

The lifestyle of ancient Bugis people were, to some extent, preserved by the pagan Torajan people until the dawn of the 20th century. Their homes were mainly constructed on stilts and the communities were likely to be scattered along the river banks, sea or lake shores. The main undertakings during this period were farming rice, millet, adlay and other edible crops, catching fish and shellfish, obtaining forest produce and hunting wild animals. Buffaloes were imported and used for important occasions.

The earliest inhabitants potentially clad under a simple clothing. The women potentially wore a skirt; while for the men, a loincloth and possibly a headcloth. Remains of bronze and gold ornaments have also been retrieved based on archeological evidence. Pottery is evident, although bamboo containers were more extensively used together with the usage of bamboo knives. The weapons were sourced from iron and stones together with helmets and shields made from rattan.

Theologically, the early Bugis potentially practiced ancestor worshipping. There were also ancient rituals related to agriculture and fertility. They generally buried their corpses, although there were several cases where the deceased body were being disposed by immersion in the sea or lakes, or positioned in trees. Other mortuary practices includes cremation, especially for the rulers.
Despite being located in a sparsely populated communities, they were not living in an absolute isolation with the outside world. Instead, trade and commerce were held high and regarded to be of pivotal importance in the society. The archeological findings near Bantaeng and Ara unearthed ancient artifacts dating from 300 to 100 BC, denoting evidence that the southern part of Sulawesi has played an integral role in the axis of early insulindian trade. There are also traces of imported Chinese and other continental Southeast Asian ceramics and stoneware found in the pre-Islamic cemeteries.

However, in contrast to much of Southeast Asia, the indicators of Hindu and Buddhist materials are rather sparse in South Sulawesi cultures. Their writing system, and some of their names and words, along with few Buddhist bronze images found in Mandar and Bantaeng only suggest that the existence of trade relations made with the western archipelago and the presence of foreigners alike. It is likely that despite being benefited with the trade relationship, they would resist external assimilation. Thus, outside elements are almost absent in the development of native religion and the indigenous states.

The intensity on the early insulindian trade has led to a gradual shift in terms of the economic development, social construct, political interest and the balance of power amongst the South Sulawesi people, which has fundamentally led to the Bugis states, dynasties and polities began to flourish.

===The growth of Bugis kingdoms===

The progress of inter-insular commercial activities and the increasing interactions with Maritime Silk Road were potentially among the main factors contributing to the economic prosperity for a few leading South Sulawesi communities. The period between 1200 and 1600 witnessed a radical change throughout the political landscape of lowland South Sulawesi Peninsula.

The trade in South Sulawesi was based on the export of rare commodities, a business which was easily dominated by an exclusive ruling class. The administrative structure is fairly basic, a majority of the states are small and in a form of a local chiefdom. A small population is sufficient to assist the elite with food, physical work and military assistance to preserve their state&#x27;s independence.

However, by the 15th century, a major economic revolution taken place, and agricultural become an important economic foundation. To continue their powers in the agrarian-based society, the ruling elites are now required to handle the near unprecedented growth on the rice-producing territories to accommodate a major population boom. Hence, in order adapt with the economic and societal change, a new system and intermediaries are needed.

Trade and commerce however, still retains its essential importance for the South Sulawesi economy. Rice become a major source of export; and at the same time, the economy is stimulated by the import of prestige goods from other parts of archipelago. The area potentially experienced exceptional growth following the rise of Malacca as a regional entrepôt. Conversely, the wealth for the elite families in South Sulawesi would also consequently rose due to this intensive commercial transactions, despite the fact that trade is now not solely regarded as their single source of riches.

===Emergence of new political strengths over the peninsula===

In the 1500s, Luwu was the major political force in the Bugis heartland, with its authority proclaimed throughout a large section of the peninsula. Nevertheless, new geopolitical players that would resist its dominance were already beginning to take shape by the end of the century.

The impact following the rise of Malacca were more visible in the western coast of South Sulawesi, an area with a high concentration of Malay and Minangkabau merchants arriving from the west. It slowly gained the attention of the kingdoms of Soppeng and Sindereng, with the pursuit to include the area in their territorial expansions, these Bugis states have already lost their direct sea access in the west coast by Luwu.

Sidenreng, a tributary under the domain of Soppeng had slowly grown into prominence and slowly seemed to be resistant to accept Luwu&#x27;s dominance in the area. In cooperation with a few Bugis kingdoms in the western coastSawitto&#x27;, Alitta, Suppa&#x27; and Bacukiki&#x27;; as well as Rappang in the interior, they formed a loose confederation known as Aja&#x27;tappareng (&#x27;the lands west of the lake&#x27;).

Conversely, the neighbouring Bugis territory of Wajo also possessed an aspiration for an autonomy against Luwu, and it too started to extend their influence and dominance in the surrounding areas. By 1490, they entered an agreement with Luwu, and in the agreement they would no longer be considered as &quot;its servant&quot; but as a &quot;Luwu&#x27;s child&quot;. By 1498, the Wajorse enthroned Arung Matoa Puang ri Ma&#x27;galatung as their ruler, he would later turn the domain as one of the major Bugis Kingdom.

The lower western seaboard, the Bugis Kingdom of Bone under the rule of King Kerrampelua&#x27; (c.1433–83) had also enacted an expansion plan to absorb parts of neighboring Luwu territories into its vassalage. Thus, by two centuries later, it has become an area for intense confrontation between the two kingdoms.

While the Makassarese, traditionally occupied the deep down in the south and the western coast of the peninsula were mainly concentrated their political rule in Siang and Bantaeng (the latter was potentially still under Luwu&#x27;s nominal control). However, the small twin states of Gowa and Tallo (better known by foreigners as a single state of Makassar) were started to gain its importance during this period.

===Bugis-Makassar society in the 16th century===

By the 16th century, the Bugis life is noted by a burgeoning tolerance towards foreign influences, overseas products were no longer limited to the ruling class, but also among the commoners as well. The method of home construction, remains the same. Sketches from few western sources in the first half of 17th century illustrates tall and strong wooded home raised on piles.

Nonetheless, inside of the more wealthy homes, some foreign furnitures, namely tables and chairs began to emerge, and basic wall opening sometimes become real windows with shutters. The Bugis names for these objects signaled their Portuguese connection, &quot;Jandela&quot; (window) deriving from &quot;Janela&quot;, &quot;Kadera&quot; (chairs) from &quot;Cadeira&quot;; and &quot;Mejang&quot; (table) from &quot;Mesa&quot;. A gradual change is also noted in the household tools and utensils, including glasses and Iberian-style jugs and trays. There were also the adoption of few Portuguese games notably dice, card game and marbles. The Portuguese and Spaniards also introduced new food and produce in the local diet, mainly from the New World crops: sweet potato and tobacco, and also other important itemsmanioc, maize and chilies.

During the period, the women don under a baggy trousers and pants; the usage of short tunics and sleeves were also noted by the free married women. For the affluent male, there were potentially also a favour towards western shirts and hats; and sometimes being paired together with a plume, and a jacket. The slave class and the male commoners however, would usually go topless.
The aftershocks following the Fall of Malacca were potentially being strongly felt in South Sulawesi. As noted from Tomé Pires in Suma Oriental, few traders from &#x27;The Macassar Islands&#x27;, including the Bugis and Bajo were amongst the people who arrived in Melaka to trade, although they are small in numbers. Conversely, the Muslim-Malay traders from Patani, Pahang, and Ujung Tanah in the Malay Peninsula; as well as from Champa in Indochina; and Minangkabau in Sumatra settled throughout the port cities in the western coast, including Suppa&#x27;, Pancana-Tanete, Siang, Tallo, Sanrabone and Gowa. Due to this extensive bilateral connection, the people of South Sulawesi were generally well aware on the political-religious changes taken place in the western half of the archipelago.

It can be inferred that following the Conquest of Malacca by the Portuguese Conquistadors, the trading links intensified between South Sulawesi to other commercial powerhouse: namely Johor and Patani in the peninsula, Acheh in Sumatra, Banjarmasin in Borneo and Demak in Javaall having the status as a bastion for Islamic faith. However, as far as the mid 16th century, South Sulawesi persist to be one of the few remaining significant domains in the regional native trading network where Islam has yet to take hold.

===Early attempts to Christianize the Bugis states===

While early contacts with Islam had been made since 1490 with the trading relationship between Siang and Malacca, most Bugis were still believer of the native patturioloang religion. In year 1540, two aristocrats from Makassar were baptized in Ternate. They later embarked on another visit the following year and bought many of the region&#x27;s previous materials, including gold, sandalwood and iron weapons. Antonio de Paiva, a Portuguese trader, made multiple voyages between Sulawesi and Malacca from 1542, potentially intrigued by the potential riches of the region. During his expedition to the Bugis states of Suppa&#x27; and Siang, he was involved in a theological discussion and was requested to baptize La Putebulu, Datu of Suppa&#x27; and his family, followed by king of Siang in 1544. The baptism was also concluded with a military alliance with both states.

De Paiva&#x27;s return to Malacca was not only together with official gifts to the Kingdom of Portugal, but also accompanied with four young Bugis men who would later attend the Jesuit college in Indian Goa. The two Bugis Kings also requested priests and a possible military support from the Portuguese Malaccan governor, potentially to curb the increasing peril imposed by the neighboring Makassarese states of Gowa-Tallo. Further baptism continued in 1545 by a priest, Father Vicente Viegas, which was involved the Christianization of Bugis rulers in Alitta and Bacukiki&#x27;, according to Manuel Godinho de Erédia, kings of Sawitto and Sidenreng also participated, all were allies of Suppa&#x27; part of Ajatappareng alliance.

Relations with Portuguese were still good, until an elopement between a Portuguese officer and daughter of La Putebulu from Suppa was exposed as they married secretly in Malacca, which would result in the birth of Manuel Godinho de Erédia. The Portuguese vessel had to rapidly left Sulawesi to avoid severe violence and they did not dared to travel back to the island until 1559. One member of the voyage, Manuel Pinto, decided to remain in South Sulawesi, he recorded the political development and involved in discussions with several Bugis-Makassar rulers in the region before returning to Malacca (via Java). However Datu of Suppa and its population alongside other Ajatappareng states remain largely Christians according to Manuel Godinho de Erédia.

Following the restoration of economic relations with the Portuguese Malacca in 1559, there were repeated requests made from South Sulawesi primarily Ajatappareng states for priests, however not many were available and the Portuguese did not consider Bugis as their prime concern. Not until 1584 did the Portuguese send four Franciscans fathers to the area, and their stay was a short one. Also not known were the fates of the four Bugis men sent for education in Indian Goa. Subsequently, no new attempts to baptized Sulawesi were taken after the period, nor Portuguese military support against invasion by King of Gowa-Tallo, Karaeng Lakiyung Tunipalangga, which annexed and vassalized Siang alongside other Ajatappareng states.

===Quest for prestige, influence and powers over the peninsula===

During the resumption of Portuguese-South Sulawesi relations in 1559, the political dynamic of the region have effectively morphed. The Makassarese state of Gowa had exerted his influence towards the north, and absorbed many Bugis states that have had a friendly relations towards the Portuguese.

Simultaneously, the Kingdom of Bone also commenced its southward expansion, and soon come into a direct contact with the Makassarese. Both kingdoms are pursuing dominance in the entirety of the Peninsula together with the important trade routes.

Thus, the two growing kingdoms are bound for a major collision course and a war finally broke out in 1562. Gowa was assisted by Luwu; and also by Wajo and Soppeng, the latter two would probably preferred in favour of a distant sovereign like Luwu or Gowa, as they would furnish Wajo and Soppeng with a greater autonomy in contrast to a nearby kingdom like Bone, which would likely dominate them.

The war concluded in 1565 and a peace negotiation followed afterwards. The two states agreed in the Tengka River as their respective spheres of influence under the Treaty of Caleppa. The citizens of Bone and Gowa were also awarded equal rights in each other&#x27;s jurisdiction.

The ambitions for dominance continued in South Sulawesi. Between 1570 and 1591, several military operations were conducted by Gowa, in which oftentimes with the support of Luwu. Although a distant power, Gowa tend to be rather hard towards its Bugis vassals of Wajo and Soppeng, this made these two states become inclined to the invitation by Bone to restore their autonomy. In 1590, the three kingdoms (Wajo, Soppeng and Bone) entered an alliance known as &quot;Tellumpocco&#x27;e&quot;, &#x27;the Three Summits&#x27; or &#x27;the Big Three&#x27;.

In 1590, Daeng Mammeta embarked on another campaign to annihilate Wajo, but he was killed during an amok. A truce was followed soon after in 1591, the peace negotiation, under the Treaty of Caleppa was thus renewed.

===The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar===

In the later half of the 16th century, the contest between Islam and Christianity was still largely undecided in South Sulawesi Peninsula. Most of the surrounding kingdoms in Sulawesi have already become Muslims under the sway of Ternate-Gorontalo in 1525 and Buton in 1542. There were already individual converts in South Sulawesi.

In 1550, the Malay-Muslim community of Macassar were awarded special privileges by the ruler of Gowa according to &quot;Lontarak Patturiolonga&quot;. However, in 1575, during the visit by Abdul Makmur (Dato&#x27; ri Bandang), one of the Minangkabau proselytizers of Islam, he noted that there are several difficulties to convert the localsthe superfluous liking towards dried boar flesh, raw deer liver diced with blood (lawa) and palm liquor. He then embarked to promulgate the teaching of Islam in the Kingdom of Kutei, eastern Borneo, in which he was more triumphant. In 1580, the Sultan of Ternate, Babullah, advised the ruler of Gowa to embrace the teaching of Islam, the king declined. However, as a gesture of kindness, he awarded the Makassar-Malay community the consent to construct a mosque.
Abdul Makmur returned to Makassar with Sulaiman (Dato&#x27; ri Pa&#x27;timang) and Abdul Jawad (Dato&#x27; ri Tiro). All three of them are from Minangkabau and likely to have been educated in Aceh, before they visited Johor-Riau to study South Sulawesi culture from Bugis-Makassar sailors, followed by study under Wali Songo of Java, in a proselytization mission facilitated by Sultan of Johor. After their new attempts to introduce the Islamic teaching once more met with opposition, they left for Luwu. This was because Luwu was the spiritual center of South Sulawesi and its indigenous belief of Dewata SewwaE had some similarities with Islam. They successfully converted the Pattiarase, Datu of Luwu and in February 1605 he took the name of Sultan Muhammad. The group then revisited Makassar and the three of them later managed promoted Islam to the Gowan ruler, to become Muslim under the name of Sultan Ala&#x27;uddin. In November 1607, the first public prayers were promulgated in the newly constructed Tallo&#x27; Mosque. Conversion began slowly and adapted with native Ammatoa practitioners centered in Bulukumba.

The twin kingdom of Gowa and Tallo persuaded other South Sulawesi Kingdoms to emulate their move on adopting Islam as their religion. When this invitation was declined, they launched a series of military actions known as &quot;the Islamic wars&quot;. In 1608, the west coast states of Bacukiki&#x27;, Suppa&#x27;, Sa wino&#x27; and Mandar; and in the east coast, Akkotengeng and Sakkoli&#x27; submitted; followed by subjugation of Sidenreng and Soppeng in 1609, Wajo in 1610.

Pursuant to the submission from the Bugis state of Bone in 1611, most of the South Sulawesi Peninsula (with the exception of Toraja highlands) have accepted Islam. Bone, subsequently would continue to Islamize its two vassal states located in the edge of the Torajan realmnamely Enrekang and Duri.

The Islamisation in most of South Sulawesi have provided a platform for a faith and ideological revolution. Islamic laws and principles were observed and absorbed into the Makassar, Bugis and Mandar cultures.

Dato&#x27; ri Bandang directed first towards the foundation of Sharia principles on the land, having emphasis on the importance of religious service at the circumcision ceremony, marriage and funerals. However, with the exception of funeral rites which were absolutely Islamized; other rites of passage based on the Islamic understanding were simply incorporated with the existing traditional practices, norms and customs. As for prohibition, there are also strong enforcement against adultery and the consumption of pork; other behaviors including consuming alcohol and opium, offerings to sacred places, worshipping at regalia, lending money with interest (Riba) and gambling were also condemned.

As Islamization was slowly taking root among the society in the peninsula, mosques were built in each of the states and domains. Thus, appointments were made for the newly established positions of qadi, imam and khatib throughout the Bugis-Makassar lands.

Despite being devout Muslims, the process did not serve as a hindrance towards the Makassarese Muslim King of Gowa to maintain a friendly relationship with Portuguese and Christianity. Despite so, the Bugis and Makassarese realms became Muslim and were now prevented to convert to Christianity by the local ruler.

===The twilight of dominance===

Beginning from the end of the 17th century and the dawn of the 19th, the highly delicate balance of power in South Sulawesi was completely plunged on a downward spiral due to a series of radical changes in the local statecraft, including internal dynastic disputes, geopolitical tensions, growing secondary influence from the western consumerism and the Fall of Makassar.

After over a century following the monumental struggle between Gowa and Bone for the conquest of the peninsula, another war was slowly being reignited between the two rivaling powers. The conflict traced its origin from a domestic affair in the Kingdom of Bone, who was ruled from 1631 to 1634 by La Ma&#x27;daremmeng. The king enforced rules based on the strong Islamic principles, including removing the pagan bissu and forbidding the consumption of palm beer and other superstitious practice. The final straw was the prohibition of slavery, which resulted the rebellion by the mother of the king. She later then sought the assistance of Gowa and a major military operation ensured. The Makassarese forces managed to achieve success and captured 30,000 Bugis prisoners, including La&#x27;daremmeng and installed a Makassarese governor. After a subsequent revolt, Bone was transformed into a full-fledged colony. This resulted the anger amongst the Bone people and its nobility.

At the same time, the Dutch was also eyeing their attention towards the port city of Makassaran important capital of commerce, wealth, political and military base in the eastern archipelago. Conversely, both Makassarese Kingdom of Gowa and the Dutch perceived each other as an imminent threat against their dominance within the highly lucrative spice trade.
The opportunity for Bone came after the victorious Dutch attack on Makassar in 1660. Required to sign an unfavorable truce, the Gowans requested 10,000 Bone people for a forced ditch digging as defense against potential attacks from the land. Few Bone noblemen, including Arung Pallaka, took refuge in the neighbouring Buton and presented for a Bugis-Dutch alliance against Makassar. The military alliance was also joined by Soppeng state, which, akin to Bone, aimed the attacks as an act of retribution against the action of Gowa for enslaving thousands of their people to construct the facilities in Makassar.

The war erupted in 1666, with the Bugis-Dutch alliance being assisted with troops from Ternate, Ambon and Buton. The main Makassarese ally during the war was the northern Bugis state of Wajo. Despite being an associate of Bone by treaty in the past, the Wajorese leader decided to enter an alliance with Gowa to combat against the Dutch influence.

The fall of Makassar was proven to be fatal. Sultan Hasanuddin of Gowa was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bongaya on 18 November 1667. This required the Makassarese to removed most of its fortification, relinquish its trade in spices, end its import of foreign goods with the exception of the Dutch East India Company, banish the Portuguese and other non-Dutch Europeans, and reject any other attempts of suzerainty, in both Bugis lands or other parts of the archipelago. In 1669, Sultan Hasanuddin abdicated from the throne.

The Dutch have succeeded to achieve its goal after the fall of Makassar, but they are not the sole victor; another was the Bugis State of Bone, despite having a few restriction following the treaty that it also signed, the kingdom would effectively maintain its sovereignty until the 19th century. Hence, in the Bone narration, Arung Palakka holds the status as an independence warrior; while in Makassar heritage, the rivaling Sultan Hasanuddin is hailed as the hero for the Makassarese.

Once liberated from Makassar, the power vacuum has possibly set the stage for Bone to hold an unchallenged sovereignty across the whole peninsula. However, the prospect of unifying all the Bugis lands under a sole ruler was stopped by the existence of the Dutch in the region. The peninsula then continued to persist under a mosaic of various small and large confederations.

===A new golden age===

One of the major ripple effect following the conquest of Makassar was the change in the design of navigation and emigration routes among the South Sulawesi people. The cosmopolitan harbour of Makassar become a crucial maritime starting point for not only for the Makassarese, but also for the Bugis who seek for wealth and fame in the western Archipelago, as the Dutch set a heavy restriction for their access on the eastern spice islands.

Concurrently, during the later 17th and 18th centuries, a transformative period emerged, marked by the establishment of a crucial sea-trading network. Ambitious migrants engaged in bold overseas ventures, contributing to the gradual rise of a merchant middle class that would later hold a prominent position in Bugis society. The construction of this pivotal sea-trading network left a lasting impact, shaping economic activities and fostering connectivity both within their native South Sulawesi and in foreign regions. Nevertheless, during this timeframe, they also underwent a flourishing art and cultural renaissance in their homeland. Many of their important literary works, including the majority of their post-La Galigo productions, originated from these years.

The Age of Sail also marked with other closely interconnected waves of mass migration and trade towards Riau Archipelago, Malay Peninsula, Singapore, Sumatra, Batavia, northern coast of Java, Bali, Madura, Alor, the Lesser Sunda Islands, coastal Borneo, Sulu Archipelago and other parts of Sulawesi in search of riches, prestige and political influence.

During the same period, they ushered a new golden era. With the consolidation of Islamic faith and values on one side, and the recognition as one of the major maritime society on the other; the two redefining elements that would be infused to become part and parcel with the Bugis identity until the early 20th century.

==Culture==
===Language and dialects===

The Bugis language constitutes a part of the larger Austronesian family. It is among the major languages located in the southwest hemisphere of Sulawesi, the others being Makassar, Toraja, Massenrempulu and Mandar. These languages collectively belong to the South Sulawesi languages.

Bugis speakers are dominant in most of the districts in South Sulawesinamely Bone, Soppeng, Wajo, Sidrap, Pinrang, Barru, Sinjai, and Parepare. In Bulukumba, Pangkep, and Maros, the populations are checkerboarded between Bugis and Makassar-speaking villages, each villages having their own separate language identity intact. A similarly unsharp language border can also be observed in the northwestern coastal towns of Pinrang (in South Sulawesi Province) and Polmas (in West Sulawesi), being a transitional area between the traditional Bugis and Mandarese cultural areas.

Located in the periphery of the Bugis-Torajan world, the Massenrempulu people (constituting Duri, Enrekang, Maiwa and Malimpung groups) from Enrekang and northern Pindrang as well as the Tae&#x27; speakers of Luwu are also occasionally identified and embraced as among the subgroups of the Bugis family due to the shared tradition and common religious affiliation. Culturally, they formed a continuum between the Bugis and Toraja people; linguistically, the Massenrempulu&#x27;s and Tae&#x27;s mother tongue generally inherited a closer linguistic intelligibility with the Torajan language.
Despite having some divergence in the local expression and dialects, the Bugis variants (with the exception of Massenrempulu and Tae&#x27;, when considered) commonly retain a high level of mutual intelligibility between one another. Nonetheless, it is an accepted practice amongst the mainstream Bugis society to distinguish themselves regionally and culturally based on the location of their traditional and ancestral states.

There are a subtle differences on the language spoken in these areas and linguist identified these versions as separate dialects (rather than distinct languages). Presently, there are ten main branches of Bugis DialectsBone, Camba, Pangkep, Sidrap, Pasangkayu, Sinjai, Soppeng, Wajo, Barru and Luwu, as well as dozens of smaller subdialects deriving from the main branches. However, some researchers are divided whether Sawittoa divergent Bugis variety spoken in central Pinrangremains under the same language group or being diverged enough to be considered as a separate language.
The present-day Bugis people are mostly bilingual. In South Sulawesi, they use two leading languages, either Bugis or Indonesian, tailored based on the environment, social circle and activities. Bahasa Indonesia is largely incepted on official situations, it is the language of formal education, administration, mass media and modern literature; Bahasa Indonesia is also prevalent during conversation with non-Bugis speakers. In the informal and casual settings around the Bugis-speaking circle, a code-switch would be a commonplace, or intertwined with elements of both languages in varying degrees, such as speaking Bahasa Indonesia with a strong Bugis-influenced elements and vice versa.

In the South Sulawesi province, the affixes such as -ki&#x27;, -ko, na-, -ji, - mi, etc. are emulated and conceived in the Indonesian-Bugis-Makassar hybrid. The Bugis-Makassar accent, known as &quot;Okkots&quot; is also observed for the usage of a stronger -ng pronunciation in parts its speech. The fixture is not exclusively confined in the borders of South Sulawesi, the pattern can also be heard in other parts of Indonesia with a visible Bugis population. Outside the province, the language hybrid is not solely influenced by Bahasa Indonesia, but alongside traces of other local languages and dialects amalgamated with the diaspora Bugis language. Similarly beyond Indonesia, the extension of the language blend can also be seen in parts of Malaysia and Singapore, home to a sizable Bugis community. Instead of having influenced with Bahasa Indonesia, the Bugis communities in these countries would also be influenced by the Malay language and its local dialects.

Outside from their ancestral heartland in the lowland plains of South Sulawesi, the Bugis language, dialects and hybrids are found throughout their extensive network of diaspora and ethnic enclaves in Sulawesi and all across Insular Southeast Asia. However, presently there tends to be a pronounced language shift among the diaspora outside of South Sulawesi, hence the understanding and the command on the Bugis language may vary based on the personal background, exposure, interest and contacts with their ancestral language.

===Philosophy===
The Bugis-Makassar possessed a rich heritage, philosophy, religious and social structure. Their customs are based on the concept &quot;Pangadereng&quot;originally consist of &quot;Ade&quot; (custom), &quot;Rapang&quot; (Jurisprudence), &quot;Bicara&quot; (Judiciary) and &quot;Warik&quot; (Social system); following the Islamisation of the Bugis-Makassar, &quot;Syara&quot;&#x27; (Syariah) was incorporated into its core values.

Another fundamental local wisdom includes &quot;Siri&#x27; na pacce&quot;. It serves as a guidance, social convention and moral conduct. &quot;Siri&quot; signifies the consolidation a demeanor of shame and self-esteem, it acted as a pillar that bear the importance of dignity, virtue, esteem, solidarity and responsibility. &quot;Siri&quot; is essential for someone to be regarded as a &quot;tau&quot; (human). &quot;Pacce&quot; manifest as a presence of compassion and solidarity. It involves a person&#x27;s ability on emotional intelligence, which includes love, sadness, pain, and solidarity. Other interpretation of &quot;Pecce&quot; revolves on self-sacrifice, hard work, and abstinence. In addition to the Bugis and Makassarese, the traditional ethos is also shared by their northern cousinsthe Torajans and Mandarese.

Translated as the &quot;four corners&quot;&quot;Sulappa Eppa&quot; represents the ancient philosophy, ideas and theories of the Bugis-Makassar on the notion that the universe was built in a form of a giant rhombus, created by four salient fundamentalswind, fire, water and earth. Thus, the classical Bugis-Makassar aesthetic vibes, articulations and nuances are largely created and envisioned in a dominant four-cornered composure; including on their traditional writing scripts (the lontara), architectural layouts, ceremonial cuisines (&quot;songko&quot; and &quot;songkolo&quot;), artistic designs, textile (sarong motives) and philosophical values. The four elements are also synonymously evoked by a sense of four distinct colorswind (yellow), fire (red), water (white) and earth (black). Additionally, the &quot;Lipa&#x27; Sabbe&quot; or &quot;sarung sutra&quot; (a sarung-cloth made from silk) signifies as an embodiment to honor the refined Bugis-Makassar cultural paradigm in its purest form.

===Traditional script===

The Lontara traced its origin from the Kawi script; however, it has received a localized development and modification to accommodate the writings in the Bugis, Makassar and Mandar language. It was traditionally used for formal and official documents such as contracts, trade laws, treaties, maps, and journals, both in Western book format and in the traditional palm-leaf manuscript. Following the rise of South Sulawesi as a naval powerhouse in eastern archipelago, the script expanded its influence, being introduced and incorporated as the Lonta Ende in Flores, Mbojo in eastern Sumbawa and Satera Jontal in western Sumbawa, albeit with alternations for the latter languages.

Its designation, &quot;Lontara&quot; was acquired from the term &quot;Lontar&quot;, the Javanese and Malay name from Palmyra Palm, whose leaves were commonly utilized for writing the manuscripts. It is also sometimes characterized as the Bugis script, as many of the historical writings are widely found in this language. In the Bugis Language, the writing system is styled as &quot;urupu sulapa eppa&quot;, being described as &quot;square&quot; or &quot;four-cornered letters&quot;, which served as a vivid illustration of the early Bugis-Makassar interpretation on the four ingredients that molded the universefire, water, earth and air.

During the Dutch colonization of East Indies, the writing system is largely being superseded with the introduction of Latin Alphabet. Nonetheless, the script still retains its intimate cultural importance amongst the Bugis-Makassar society in their homeland and being use for the traditional ceremony, calendar and literature; as well as in personal documents and handwritten items, for instance, in letters and notes. The script is also being taught in many schools in South Sulawesi and the usage are visible on some street signs across the province. Presently, there is also notable efforts by Indonesian typographers and graphic designers on introducing the script to a larger audience beyond its traditional borders.

In addition to Lontara, there is also another form of Bugis-Makassar traditional writing based on the Arabic-script, known as the Serang Alphabet. Relatively on an almost similar parallel module with its sister scripts, Jawi and Pegon for Malay and Javanese respectively, the Serang writing system incorporated the usage of Arabic elements with few additional characters to integrate with the local language.

===Folklore and literary traditions===

Bugis literature connotes to the forms of literature expressed in the Bugis languagewhich comprises both written and oral traditions. The earliest works of Bugis literature were verbally transmitted, written literature began to arose and gradually codified with the evolution of the Lontara script by the 1400s. Its foundation largely coincides and intersects with the Makassarese literatureof whom it shared a closely related development with. The Bugis literary tradition mainly focuses on the wisdom, moral, social life and cultural environment of the Bugis identity.

Bugis folk literature is an oral composition deeply rooted in Bugis understanding and perception of lifein the form of prose, poetry and lyric. The classification raging from various short poems, &quot;élong&quot;; long narrative poems, &quot;tolo&quot;&#x27;; playful sayings, such as riddles, &quot;atteppungeng&quot; and nursery rhymes; magical spells, &quot;jappi, baca-baca&quot;; pre-Islamic ritual expressions, &quot;sabo, sessukeng, lawolo&quot;; precepts, &quot;pappaseng&quot;; and oaths of allegiance, &quot;aru&quot;. Other important oral heritage includesstories, &quot;curita&quot;; sermons, &quot;katoba&quot;; and speeches. Although they are essentially verbal, many of the works are also subsequently being written in the language.
Writings in the Lontara Script was likely to be first appeared around 1400. The earliest texts were inscribed on palm leaves, followed by volumes of handwritten composition on paper manuscripts, potentially from 1500 onwards, or even earlier. The works of literature commonly commissioned by writing specialists known as &quot;palôntara&quot;, the &quot;palôntara&quot; is being delegated the task as a researcher on creating and compiling the Bugis manuscripts. The manuscripts tend to be rich and varied, with a plethora of themes and subjectsincluding historical chronicles, poems, legal works, ritual texts, manuals, ethics, among few. Printed materials in the Bugis language were introduced in the latter half of the 19th century, albeit with a smaller circulation, such as in dictionaries, grammars books, chrestomathies and translations.

Consist of over 6,000 pages, the La Galigo is regarded as the magnum opus in the Bugis literary heritage. Composed in the old Bugis language, the saga traced its origin from the early oral traditions. The poetic text serves as a revered almanac and provide narrations about the ancient understanding on humanity and kingdoms. In the Bugis culture, episodes from La Galigo are commonly reenacted through chant and poetic recitation performance led by a La Galigo specialist, known as &quot;passure&quot;. The performance is sometimes held during festivals, wedding or during a house-moving ceremony. In 2012, two of the La Galigo manuscripts are included in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Programme.

However, the largest collection of Bugis literature is in the form of family genealogies. It is regarded as an important family heirloom, especially amongst the members of nobility and aristocratic families. Some dated as early as 1400about two hundred years prior to their Islamisation, the early Bugis genealogies provide a rare glimpse on the culture and ideology of an early and literate Austronesian society.

===Dress, textiles and weaving traditions===

In the traditional Bugis-Makassar culture, textiles and clothes are revered and occupied a special place in the society. Historically, the colours and motives donned by the wearer possessed an important indicator and serves as a defining symbol on the person&#x27;s identity, age and status.

The term Baju Bodo derived from the Makassarese language, being described as &quot;short clothing&quot;. Conversely, in the Bugis language, it is also known as &quot;Waju Tokko&quot; and &quot;Waju Ponco&quot;&#x27;. A short-sleeved tunic, the costume is commonly worn together with silk or a woven sarong. The attire traced its origin as early as the 9th century, following the introduction of muslin cloth by the foreign traders to the harbors of South Sulawesi. The textile, being thin and light, is highly suitable to accommodate the local tropical weather in the region. In addition to muslin cloth, the Baju Bodo is also commonly sourced from pineapple-fiber fabric and cotton.
With the rise of Islamisation among the Bugis-Makassar, another closely related form of Baju Bodo emerged. Having a longer sleeve, the &quot;Baju La&#x27;bu&quot; (from Makassarese &#x27;long&#x27;), also known as &quot;Bodo Panjang&quot; (both defined as &quot;long cloth&quot;) is tailored in accordance of Islamic interpretation of &quot;Aurat&quot; and modesty. The Baju La&#x27;bu is also traditionally made from silk, a departure from the semi-transparent and translucent fabric of its predecessor.

The Bugis-Makassarese handloom industry potentially commenced in the 1400s. The locally-made sarung motives were initially basic, having rudimentary stripes of vertical, horizontal or in a checkered pattern, potentially inspired by &quot;Sulappa Eppa&quot; (the four elements) foundations. By the 1600s, the designs are becoming progressively ornamented, with the inclusion of a multitude of geometrical shapes, contour and sequence. Almost in a coordination with the function of Baju Bodo in the past, the motives and design of the sarung would also be used to denote the status of its wearer. The sarung material is usually sourced from silk and cotton.

The corresponding mode for the Bugis male is known as &quot;Jas Tutu&quot;&#x27; or &quot;Jas Tutup&quot; (an &quot;enclosed coat&quot;), the garment is in a form of long-sleeved coat with a collar. The Jas Tutu is also synonymous to be worn with the &quot;Songkok recca/Pabiring/Songkok To Bone&quot; (Bugis songkok), &quot;Lipa&#x27; Sabbe&quot; (sarong) and a gold or silver-coloured button. The Bugis-styled Songkok is made of woven rattan and golden thread. During a traditional wedding ceremony, the groom would also accompanied by a highly elaborated accessories, including &quot;Tataroppeng&quot; (Keris), &quot;Pabekkeng&quot; (belt), &quot;Rope&quot; (Songket), &quot;Sigara&quot; (headgear), &quot;Salempang&quot; (sash), &quot;Gelang&quot; (bangle) and &quot;Sapu tangan&quot; (handkerchief).

In the present day, the Baju Bodo and Jas Tutu are largely being reserved as a formal wear, the sightings are common during weddings, as well as in other ceremonial and cultural functions.

===Culinary traditions===

The Bugis cuisine constitutes an essential part of its heritage, comprises various culinary styles and recipes frequently associated with the Bugis people. It shares many common gastronomical traditions and characteristics with the surrounding Makassarese, Mandarese and Torajans. Many of the meals are indigenously developed in the island of Sulawesi, with a focus on native ingredients; while others exhibit a notably stronger outside influences and customized according to the local palates.

Foreign cooking techniques in the South Sulawesi cuisine can be seen on the adoption of &quot;Jalangkote&quot;, a small fried pie adopted from Portuguese &quot;papeda&quot;. The fillings for &quot;Jalangkote&quot; usually consist of rice vermicelli (denoting Chinese influence) combined with sliced vegetables, boiled eggs and mincemeat. Meanwhile Indian elements are visible and demonstrated in the localised dishes, for instance the creamy &quot;Gagape&quot;, &quot;Toppa Lada&quot; and the spicy &quot;Juku palumara&quot;.

There is also a wide array of cuisines that signifies a bolder endemic origin: Rice cakes are particularly popular with the likes of &quot;Burasa&quot;&#x27; and &quot;Tumbu/Lapa-lapa/Langka&quot;. The rice dumplings are steamed and wrapped in leave containers with coconut milk, thus contributing to its rich and creamy flavor. It is usually served as a substitute for white rice and eaten together with soups or other side dishes. Another distinguished forms of rice cake in the Bugis-Makassar community includes &quot;Gogos&quot;roasted glutinous rice with fish fillings, wrapped in banana leaf. It is commonly being eaten as snacks.
The peninsula&#x27;s long coastline has contributed a great fishing industry in the region, creating oceanic produce as an important part of the meal. Dishes such as &quot;Pa&#x27;Deme&quot; (anchovies sambal), &quot;Bajabu&quot; (&quot;serundeng&quot;), &quot;Lawa Bale&quot; (marinated raw fish) and the clear broth soups of &quot;Nasu Bale&quot; and &quot;Nassu Meti&quot; captures its extensive maritime connection.

In addition to seafood, there is also a diverse culinary traditions with the emphasis on meat, which can be seen in the hearty slow cooked dishes, namely &quot;Nasu Likku&quot;&#x27;, &quot;Nasu Palekko&quot; and &quot;Goré-Goré&quot;. The meals are usually acted as an accompanying side dish to complement the &quot;Nasi Putih&quot; (plain white rice), or in other cases, the rice cakes.

Banana occupied a major importance after rice in the Bugis staple, as it is widely cultivated in South Sulawesi. Aside from being eaten fresh after a meal, Banana-based meals are extensive in the forms of snacks and dessertsraging from the sweet tasting &quot;Berongko&quot; (steamed Banana pudding), caramelized &quot;Sanggara&#x27; Balanda&quot;, to crispy and savory snacks such as &quot;Sanggara Pappek&quot; (smashed bananas).

Other popular meals associated with the Bugis includes congee dishes&quot;Barobbo&quot; (rice and corn porridge) and the sago-based &quot;Kapurung&quot;; and traditional &quot;Kues&quot;, notably the &quot;Kue bugis&quot;, &quot;Kue Dange&quot;, &quot;Kue Sikaporo&quot; and &quot;Bolu Peca&quot;. Due to the extensive and continuous friendly interactions as well as prevalent intermarriage with the kindred Makassarese people, many of the unique Makassarese meals are also widely enjoyed by the Bugis, including &quot;Coto Makassar&quot;, &quot;Sop Sodara&quot;, &quot;Pallubasa&quot;, &quot;Pallu Kacci&quot;, &quot;Pallumara&quot; and &quot;Konro&quot;, or desserts like &quot;Cucuru&#x27; Te&#x27;ne&quot; and &quot;Es Palu Butong&quot;.

Beyond their native soil, Burasa&#x27; and other Bugis-Makassar traditional cuisines are also commonly presented as a ceremonial dish by their diaspora community. It is prepared as a significant legacy to honor their ancestral roots from the plains of South Sulawesi.

===Weaponry and military traditions===
A plethora of blades, knives and firearms constitute the arsenal of Bugis-Makassar weaponry. However, the Badik, also known as &quot;Kawali&quot;, is hailed as the traditional weapon strongly associated with their identity and possessed a revered status in the sociological construct of the Bugis-Makassar society. The item is not solely perceived as a mere weapon, but as an emblem designated to represent the personal character of its owner. It is historically used as a vital tool for hunting animals and as a self-defense mechanism.

In the traditional Bugis-Makassar understanding, the hierarchal level of Badik is regarded as a second after the Keris. A far-cry from the Badik which known to have an almost universal usage throughout all ranks of the society, the &quot;Keris Pusaka&quot; (the &quot;Dynasty Keris&quot;) is reserved as an important family regalia amongst the elite royal houses in South Sulawesi. Thus, historically the Badik received a prevalent identity as a companion for the Bugis-Makassar man.

In the past, Badik is used as a tool of defense to protect an individual and the family honor. The doctrine is largely based on the philosophical interpretation of &quot;Siri&quot;, a cornerstone of the Bugis-Makassar culture, siri represents a responsibility to maintain the dignity in the society. The concept is historically entranced in the cognitive psyche amongst the people and traditionally become a binding force on the moral values and social system. Badik is also commonly passed from one generation to another, acting as an important family heirloom.
Another important sword owned by the Bugis is the Keris, also known as &quot;Tappi&quot;. It has some minor different features in contrast to the Javanese Keris; however, the Bugis Keris is noted to bear a closer anatomical resembles with the Malay-version of the dagger, the item potentially being introduced by the Malays to the people of South Sulawesi. Almost parallel with the Badik, the Keris equally carried a revered symbol amongst many Bugis-Makassar people.

In addition to Badik and Keris, they were known to host a multitude of classical armaments. Most of the items are collectively classified under the &quot;parewa bessi&quot; (Iron weapons) category made by the Bugis-Makassar blacksmiths. Some of the other notable collections include &quot;Alamang&quot; and &quot;Sundang&quot;, a long-sword; &quot;Bessing&quot;, a spear; &quot;Kanna&quot;, shield; Pantu&#x27;, a traditional fighting stick; &quot;Waju Rante&quot;, armor; and &quot;Tado&quot;, a trapping rope.

The art of weapon among the Bugis-Makassar is constantly developed through the millennia. The ancient peoples of South Sulawesi are recorded to have a usage of blowpipes with poisoned darts, spears, short swords, kris and rattan helmets. By the early modern era, the Bugis-Makassar gained further exposure on the artillery knowledge with the introduction of various firearms: muskets, culverins and cannons that enhance their warfare and combatant skills. Mail armor with metal plates (&quot;baju lamina&quot;) is estimated to be used starting from this era, and still being worn until the 19th century.

The strong mutual relationship between the arms development and its militaristic culture formed the advantageous momentum that fueled to their quest for political advancement and influence outside from the traditional Bugis-Makassar homeland. It become one of the wielding tools that seals their historical figures and status as soldiers, mercenaries, warriors and fighters throughout the maritime realm.

===Traditional architecture===

In the Bugis society, architecture is regarded as an emblem of philosophy, designed to endorse the occupier belief, faith and understanding about cosmos and universe. It is strongly rooted in its long and rich history, blending elements on the native interpretation of cosmology with culture, faith, mythology, aesthetic and functionality. The Bugis architectural style is broadly classed together with the Makassarese, of whom it shares strong architectural features and identity.

Based on the Bugis philosophical understanding, a home is regarded as the legitimate expression of the spiritual rite of passage as a human being: a place to be born, a place to raised and nurtured as a child, a place to become a husband and wife, and a place to perish. Consequently, the habitation is designed to be solemn, sacred and highly revered. It provides ones with a place for solitude, energy, nourishment, well-being and honour to its dwellers. The presence of a home in the Bugis society is part-and-parcel with life, hence home ownership is regarded in utmost importanceto commemorate life and to become a beacon symbol of life.
In the Bugis culture, architecture is not only solely perceived as a question of practice, but a subject of theological dialogue. The formula of &quot;Sulapa Eppa&quot; (the four elements) was interpreted and constructed with such intention. The layout plan for the Bugis buildings would commonly have a rectangular and symmetrical consistency, the aim is to intergrade with the early Bugis understanding that the universe is in a form of a giant rhombus and the four ingredients that created the universe (wind, water, fire and earth); together with the four wind directions (north, south, east and west). Thus, the Bugis houses would traditionally faces north, as an origin for positive energy; or towards east, the dawn of light.
The houses were commissioned into three separate levels, signifying the three position of the universe based on the pre-Islamic Bugis interpretation. &quot;Rakeang&quot; (the upper world)a tribute to the heavens above, the attic is designed to be the apex of the house and it is regarded to be a sacred place to store rice, crops and important heirlooms. &quot;Ale Bola&quot; (the middle world), appeared for a respect to the human world, thus represented by the living and the common space of the house. &quot;Awa Bola&quot; (the underworld), a place of dark and ferocious, this concept was exemplified by the shed and where the livestock are stored beneath the human dwelling.

The concept of &quot;rupa-tau&quot; (&#x27;likeness of a person&#x27;) is also extensively explored and adopted in the Bugis architectural principles. This led to the building structured as a grandiose manifestation of an anatomical relationship. The housing framework was monumentally characterized by distinct components based on a human physique: &quot;Aje-bola&quot; (the foot), by the stilts of the house; &quot;ale-bola&quot; (body), the common living space; &quot;ulu-bola&quot; (the head), the roof; and &quot;posi-bola&quot; (the navel) by the middle area of the house.

The development of the Bugis architecture is originated on the belief that a home is constructed with an optimistic faith for a greater future. Based on the classical Bugis myth and understanding, the stars, skies and constellations held a great divine significance; in response, a human is entrusted to maintain the harmonious arrangement of the universein order to have a safer and tranquil life, as well as to avoid natural calamities (notably floods, landslides, tornado and earthquake). Thus, such ethos and essences are extensively emulated, absorbed and vividly radiated in the traditional Bugis architectural articulations.

===Maritime, mercantile and migratory traditions===

Across archipelagic Southeast Asia, the Bugis-Makassar earned the reputation as sailors, navigators and seafaring traders. Their naval foundation largely coordinated with the extensive shipbuilding traditions, nautical skills and the dominant presence in the inter-insular trade routes.

Conversely, they too acquired the title as &quot;The Vikings of Southeast Asia&quot;. Their extensive maritime and trading expedition has historically bought them to be as one of the notable regional players in the transoceanic journeys to Indochina, Macau, Manila, Papua and northern Australia, together with the Southeast Asian islands that lies between these areas. Their ships were commonly use to carry and transport exotic spices, sandalwood, textiles, rice, luxury marine products, porcelains, pearls and other important goods and materials across the ancient spice trade routes.

During the Age of Sail, their seafaring odysseys were largely aided by padewakang, one of the early type of Bugis-Makassar vessel, which later morphed into the palari. Steep in history, the first of such watercraft was born based on the legendary tradition of Sulawesi.

Up until the nineteenth century, the classic Padekawang was traditionally led by a captain, known as &quot;nakoda&quot; or &quot;anakoda&quot;; followed by his second-in-command, the &quot;juragang&quot;. It is also usual for the ship to have two , &quot;jurumudi&quot; delegated the task on directing the ship&#x27;s course; two &quot;jurubatu&quot; , responsible to measure the depth on approaching the coast, reefs or shoals; and a single secretary known as &quot;jurutulisi&quot;, acting as an agent on behalf of the owner of the vessel. The names are largely adopted from the Malay language, with an influence from Persian, such as the term of &quot;&quot;.
In order to identify the course of their maritime routes, the sailors would typically inclined to use a multitude of convergent nautical practice, from determining the rising and setting points of the sun; the location horizon, stars and constellations; the marine environmentthe flow of the oceanic swell, the form of the waves and the water appearance; faunathe actions of the fish and the flight arrangement of the birds; the wind directions; and specific geographical landmarks.

The original pinisi-rigged ship (palari), is about in length overall, with light laden waterline of . Smaller palari is only about 10 m in length. A two-masted sailing vessel, the name &quot;pinisi&quot; derives from the type of gaff rig, use for its configuration. Its unique canted rectangular mainsails and tripod masts give its unparalleled design composition, a departure from other western ships. In the contemporary era, palari is also equipped with motors for its seafaring journeys.

There are many revered shipbuilding centers in the region, including Ara, Tanah Lemo and Bira. However, the Konjo, a subgroup of the Makassarese, are particularly known as one of the respected master builders of pinisi-rigged ships, enjoying a long-prized tradition of watercraft and boat-production, a knowledge commonly inherited from fathers to sons for centuries.
For the Konjos in Bulukumba, the boatmaking identity is deeply rooted to their lives as a precious embodiment of art, culture and rituals. Being a highly dedicated community, the Konjo people are traditionally restricted from sailing to the seas, as their elders feared that their clan would not return to their homeland, creating a perilous risk of losing their valuable shipbuilding wisdom amongst their kinsmen. Thus in South Sulawesi, the transoceanic sailing responsibility were vastly executed by their closely related brethren — the Bugis and Makassarese.

The rich nautical culture of Bugis-Makassar is equally captured and reinforced by a plethora of shipsranging from &quot;penjajap&quot;, warship; pajala, a smaller boat, also used for fishing; palari, another descendant of the padewakang; Lambo, a trading boat; and the early ships of &quot;Somba Lete&quot; and &quot;sompe tanja&quot;. These vessels collectively have left a significant impact on the local and regional development.

As the seafaring identity began to take root in the coastal South Sulawesi society, it gradually become a profound icon that navigated their influence and presence in the region. Following the Bugis-Makassar migratory tradition known as &#x27; (to sail) and &#x27;; it was here, from among these historical ships, vessels and boats that many Bugis and Makassar man, woman and children braved away from their traditional heartland in search of economic pursuits, prosperity and opportunities, while others embarked for an educational experience, adventure, personal dignity, military quest or prestigious political ambitions. Thus, most, if not all Bugis in the diaspora may ultimately traced their ancestral origin to one of the &quot;&quot;&#x27; (a term for people who sailed/ventured beyond their native soil). Tales and trails from the past waves of sails and settlements can still be witnessed until the present day, evidently illustrated by their extensive centuries-old ethnic enclaves and various diaspora communities established throughout the islands and coastal regions of maritime Southeast Asia.

===Rice and agrarian traditions===
A visible departure from the extensive maritime and nautical culture dominated by their coastal brethren, the inland Bugis-Makassar country bear witness to its strong agricultural legacy. Regarded as among the most important crop amongst the society, rice has been cultivated across the peninsula for centuries. The grain has been deeply ingrained to their agricultural way of life for generations. It is not only hailed as a primary food source on the diet, but also woven into the social, legends, theories, economic, political and ideological fabric. In a sense, their traditional identity is also being coexisted by an agrarian culture.

The simple grain is regarded as among the essence of their traditions, it has indeed enjoyed a complex and long connections with the Bugis-Makassar. The earliest trace of rice in maritime Southeast Asia was found in Ulu Leang Cave, in Maros, South Sulawesi. Dated between 4000 BC to 2000 BC, the grains potentially tied up with the arrival of their Austronesian ancestors to the region, or among the earlier Toalean hunter-gatherer society.

Rice serves a nourishment, deeply embedded to their historical development. By the 14th century, their radical transformation from local warlords to major kingdoms was largely coincides by the unprecedented population boom across the peninsula, which in turn being a correlated result intersected from the earlier improvement of the agricultural practices. Blood, sweat and tears have had been shed over the soil in the quest of favorable harvests, for instance during the 16th century, the Ajatappareng confederation (constituting the Bugis states of Sidenreng, Rappang, Suppa&#x27;, Bacukiki, Alitta&#x27;, and Sawitto) was incorporated by the expansionist pursuit by Gowa, driven by their ambitions to control the bountiful local corps of the region.

In their ancient beliefs and understanding, rice was perceived as a symbolism associated with providence and of creation, as well as blessing and joy by linking ancient customs, mythology and the people. The cultivation of the grains has had led to the development of an economic life circle centered primarily around the core of agriculture. Rooted in the pre-Islamic belief system, the &quot;mappalili&quot; (paddy growing season) was organized among the Bugis to pray for a plentiful crop season, while the grand harvest festival was held by the agrarian societies act as a joyous thanksgiving conclusion after a successful harvest. Rice is also highly venerated, based on the historical Bugis manual-almanac known as &quot;Kutika&quot;, only during specific schedules, day and time were permitted for cultivating activities; at home, the rice is traditionally stored at the attic of the house, signifying its zenith position in the social order; while during war, the destruction of rice fields was perceived as a highly forbidden taboo.

The creed of Bugis-Makassar states was undoubtedly built on horticulture standing as its salient pillar. Rice farming also has influenced many other aspects of their old economic activities. During the medieval era, it become one of the earliest main commodities of exports from the South Sulawesi heartlands to the rest of the insular Southeast Asia. The commodities may also serves as an early guidance to their fundamental mercantile and enterprising skills, before being rapidly evolved into amongst their major tools of trade during their maritime involvement in the regional trade routes.

The rice-reigned supremacy and its strong agrarian foundations of the South Sulawesi people persist until this day. In 2022, the province was estimated to produce 5.4 million tonnes of rice, becoming among the prominent rice bowls in modern-day Indonesia.

===Festivals, celebrations and religious traditions===
The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar states initiated by Luwu and Gowa in the 17th century has greatly morphed the religious landscape throughout the peninsula. As a consequence, most of the liturgical festivals by the Bugis are primarily coordinated with the Islamic calendar, albeit embraced with a strong sense on the localized cultural orientations.

The biannual &quot;Hari Raya&quot; (eid) celebrations of Idul Fitri and Idul Adha are regarded as the largest festivals for the Bugis. The Idul Fitri (known as &quot;Maleppe&quot;, meaning &quot;release&quot; in the Bugis language) serves as a triumphal rite after completing a month of fasting and religious activities during Ramadhan. In the Bugis language, the term &quot;Mallepe&quot; holds a philosophical symbol as a release from the sins and the bad habits of a person. While Idul Adha is a religious observance commemorating the sacrifice made by Ibrahim (Abraham).

A day before eid many Bugis families prepare &quot;Burasa&quot;&#x27; and &quot;Tumbu&quot; rice cakes in a tradition known as &quot;Ma&#x27;burasa&quot; and &quot;Ma&#x27;tumbu&quot;. The tradition of visiting friends, relatives and holding a grand feast for visitors are also centralknown as Massiara, the visits usually commenced after the eid prayers.
Other common traditions during eid includes &quot;Mabbaca-baca&quot;, a solemn thanksgiving dua gathering and feast led by the community religious leaders known as &quot;&#x27;Puang Anre Guru&quot; or &quot;Daeng Imam&quot;. A visit the final resting place of the departed love ones is also a major commonplace during the season, in the custom known as &quot;Masiara Kuburu&quot;, the visit to the grave is regarded as a gesture of love, respect and honour.

Other Islamic holidays Bugis observe include Ramadan and &quot;Maulu/ma maulu&quot;&#x27; (Mawlid), honoring the birth of Muhammad, when special ceremonial meals and colorful eggs are given to the mosque attendees; &quot;Esso Sura&quot; (Ashura), remembrance of Muharram, where a special porridge (known as &quot;Bubu Petu&quot; and &quot;Bella Pitunrupa&quot;) are prepared, the day also marked as a major shopping period for the Bugis-Makassar, as many would traditionally buy new house utensils during the Ashura. Furthermore, the Bugis and Makassar families would also arrange &quot;Massuro Baca&quot;, special ceremonial doa and feast held a week before Ramadhan to remember the departed relatives, as well as a preparation to cleanse the inner-self before the holy month.

Islamic elements are also materialized during celebrations on an individual level. Being a predominantly Muslim community, the act of &quot;Mabbarazanji/Barzanji&quot; (Mawlid al-Barzanjī), communal prayers and praise to Muhammad is regarded as among the focal points during such ceremonies. The Bugis would commonly organized a &quot;selamatan&quot; feast for divine favor, protection, thanksgiving and gratitudeincluding weddings, newborn celebration, aqiqah, house construction ceremony, sending a pilgrim for umrah and hajj, and funerals.

The importance of such personal and communal ceremonies collectively act as a testament of their mainstream ethnic character. It serves as a bind, propelled to their rite of passage as a Muslim and a manifestation of their cultural identity. The events also performed as a juxtaposition, intertwined between the essence of religion and custom; together with a sense of responsibility to solidify their values into the contemporary era.

Historically, there are also some regional events deeply rooted to their ancient beliefs, reflected by their pre-Islamic past, geographical location, local demographic and occupation. In a few agrarian Bugis communities, the grand harvest festivals of &quot;Mappangolo Datu Ase&quot;, &quot;Mappadendang&quot;, &quot;Manre Sipulung&quot;, &quot;Maccerak Ase&quot; and &quot;Maccerak Rakkapeng&quot; acted as a thanksgiving and celebratory gesture for the abundance of harvest obtained. Meanwhile, in the coastal and lakeside communities where fishery industry is regarded to be in the utmost importance, they would commemorate with &quot;Maccera Tappareng&quot; and &quot;Maccerak Tasik&quot;. However, with the rise of various socioeconomic and educational revolution, together with mass industrialization and the introduction of modern farming and fishing techniques throughout the 19th and 20th century, the collective impact of these festivals began to waned in favor of a much aligned practice with Islamic understanding among the mainstream Bugis society. Despite so, such regional celebration offered a brief outlook on the past, on a traditional ancient religion of a once agrarian community.

===Musical traditions and performing arts===

Music and dance has long occupied an integral part of the people in the South Sulawesi. It is considered as an ancient art form, pictured as a dramatic and complex encapsulation of the heritage. The Bugis performing arts can be broadly divided into four distinct categoriesentertainment medium, ritualistic performance, court dance and martial arts.

In the Bugis culture, choreography is regarded as a form of folkloric entertainment. It has enjoyed a long creative industry and maintained a close relationship with the people. It is usually presented during the communal occasions and used as a celebratory expression to commemorate significant events. The best known Bugis dance genre are &quot;Pajaga&quot;, and the more lively Pajogek — combining the elements of Ronggeng, Jaipong and accompanied by a pair of &quot;gendeng&quot; (drum). Other type of dances include Jeppeng, having a fusion of stronger Islamic elements; and &quot;Tari Paduppa&quot;, a traditional welcome dance.

In the past, the performing arts played an extensive role on the Bugis ritualistic function and observance. During such magico-religious ceremonies, esoteric energy were present and ancient dance techniques were accomplished by a Bugis shaman, known as &quot;Bissu&quot;. The depiction was characterized by a combination of spiritual aura and artistic elements to achieve a high level of possession-trance. The practice of possession used to be conducted by a &quot;Bissu&quot; during a vital cultural rite, such as to commemorate the beginning of the &quot;mappalili&quot; (paddy growing season) or during the important royal functions. Among the well-known ritualistic Bugis performance includes &quot;Tari Maggiri&quot;, &quot;Tari Alusu&quot; and &quot;Maddewata&quot;.
Martial art also serves as an outlook that mirrors the symbolic ideals of its strong militaristic traditioncourage, power, heroism, prestige, strength and preparation for war. Elements of martial skills were largely drawn from the local fighting culture and being incorporated in a repertoire of Bugis performing arts, such as in &quot;Manunencak/Mencak Baruga&quot; (Bugis Pencak Silat), &quot;Mallanca&quot; and &quot;Masempek&quot;. A close parallel can equally be observed in the Bugis war dance. The combatant qualities were emulated to commemorate the fortitude and spirit of the military class. The Bugis war dance of &quot;Penjaga Welado&quot;, &quot;Pajaga Gilireng&quot; and &quot;Pajaga Mutaro&quot; extensively captures such rendition.

Historically enjoyed a royal patronage, the Bugis court ballet consist of a juxtaposed movement of fast and slow; and a contrast between passive and active, such adaptation can be seen in the Bugis courtly portrayal in &quot;Pajaga Boneballa Anakdara&quot;, &quot;Pajaga Lelengbata Tulolo&quot; and &quot;Pajaga Lili&quot;. The artistic styles constitute the essence of Bugis aesthetic impulsesinvolving various movements, gestures, poise, balance and music. Historically among the members of Bugis nobility, dance was perceived as a social importance to develop and mold an individual&#x27;s personal qualities on &quot;kedo&quot; (mannerism) and &quot;ampe&quot; (speech) according to the royal standards and etiquettes.

The Bugis also hosted a multitude of classical instruments, including &quot;Soling&quot;, flutes; &quot;Kacapi&quot; and &quot;Talindo&quot;, string musical instruments; &quot;Jalappa/Kancing-Kancing&quot;, a traditional cymbal; &quot;Aloso/Laluso&quot;, a Bugis percussion instrument, similar to Shekere; &quot;Gesok–Gesok/Keso–Keso&quot;, a Bugis-styled Rebab; &quot;Gendrang&quot; (not to be mistaken with Makassarese &quot;Ganrang&quot;), a two-headed drum; and &quot;Puik Puik/Pui-Pui&quot;, a classical trumpet. As with many Sulawesian musical traditions, the Gendrang occupied a prominent and sacred role in Bugis musical traditions forming the base of many accompaniments, although somewhat less revered compared with the Makassarese. In recent years, Makassarese Ganrang traditions have eroded the education of Bugis Gendrang, although sharing many similarities, such as using multiples drums with different patterns to create syncopation.

The Bugis art of dance was predominantly being inherited via an oral tradition from one generation to another. To some extent, each of the artforms serves as an episode to the past and navigated as a kaleidoscopic narration on the complex development of their intricate ethnic identityfrom the once prevalent ancient ancestral beliefs led by a &quot;Bissu&quot;; the royal court and military traditions during the classical era; the extensive bilateral cultural exchange with the Makassarese; and the subsequent Islamisation of the mainstream Bugis society.

<text>Think Big (1970 – 23 February 1995) was a Thoroughbred racehorse who raced in Australia, winning the Melbourne Cup in both 1974 and 1975.

==Background==
Bred by the estate of the late L. A. Alexander, Think Big was purchased by Australian trainer Bart Cummings for Malaysian businessman, Dato Tan Chin Nam for $10,000 at the Trentham yearling sales in New Zealand. Initially co-owned by Dato Tan Chin Nam and Queensland property developer Rick O&#x27;Sullivan, the two owners later included Malaysia&#x27;s first Prime Minister (&#x27;the Father of Malaysia&#x27;) Tunku Abdul Rahman in Think Big&#x27;s interests. He was conditioned for racing by Cummings, who maintained a share in the horse,

==Racing career==
Think Big started eight times at age two, earning just one win. As a three-year-old he had fifteen starts for five wins. His third to Igloo in the Brisbane Cup was an indication of better things to come.

The popular Bart Cummings trained mare Leilani was the favourite for the 1974 Melbourne Cup but she was run down in the last fifty metres by her stablemate Think Big under jockey Harry White. The win gave Cummings his fourth Melbourne Cup win and his third quinella of the race.

Following his second last in the lead up MacKinnon Stakes, Think Big started at 33–1 in the 1975 Melbourne Cup, assigned high-weight of 58 kg. He had not won a race since his victory the previous year. But at his favourite course and distance, again under jockey Harry White, he fought off a challenge from stablemate Holiday Waggon to record his second win.

==Retirement==
A gelding, after his racing career was over Think Big lived out his days at jockey Harry White&#x27;s 200-hectare farm in Gisborne near Victoria, Australia where he died, on 23 February 1995, and is buried.

In his autobiography &quot;Bart: My Life&quot; Cummings recounts the story of Think Big being named by co-owner Rick O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s wife Joan at a dinner between the O&#x27;Sullivans and Dato Tan Chin Nam in Melbourne. When the subject of the possibility of winning the Melbourne Cup was raised, Joan O&#x27;Sullivan said to her husband &quot;You are always thinking big.&quot;

<doc id="595548" wikidata="Q2483906" url="?curid=595548" title="Cross-country riding">
<text>Cross country equestrian jumping forms one of the three phases of the sport of eventing; it may also be a competition in its own right, known as hunter trials or simply &quot;cross-country&quot;, although these tend to be lower-level, local competitions.

The object of cross-country is to prove the speed, endurance and jumping ability of the true cross-country horse when he is well trained and brought to the peak of condition. At the same time, it demonstrates the rider&#x27;s knowledge of pace and the use of this horse across country. (While cross-country tests a horse&#x27;s endurance over a short period, endurance itself is a separate sport, involving long-distance cross-country riding without jumps).

==Course==

===Length and types of obstacles===
The cross-country course is approximately two and three quarter to four miles (6 km) long, comprising some twenty-four to thirty-six fixed and solid obstacles. Obstacles usually are built to look &quot;natural&quot; (out of logs, for instance), however odd materials and decorations may be added to test the horse&#x27;s bravery. Obstacles can include all those that might be found if riding across the countryside, including water, trees, logs, banks, and ditches.

All obstacles or compulsory passageways are flagged, with a red flag on the right and a white flag on the left. A black stripe on the red flag indicates that it is an option for the obstacle, and another route may be taken if the rider so chooses, without penalty. All obstacles are numbered, and the color of the numbering can indicate which level the fence is for if multiple levels are competing at the event. (for example, white numbers on a green background indicate that the fence is on the Preliminary level course, however, in British eventing, this color combination would indicate the intermediate track, so riders should always check the course map for course markers).

===Design===
Cross-country courses for eventing are held outdoors through fields and wooded areas. The terrain is unique for each course, which usually incorporates the course into the natural terrain of the area, and therefore events in certain parts of the world may be held on mostly flat land, while others are over very strenuous hills.

Good course designers will use the terrain to either help the inexperienced horse and rider at the lower levels to prepare for an obstacle, or to make an obstacle more difficult for the experienced competitors. For example, the designer may place a fence at the opening of a wooded area, resulting in a lighting difference between the takeoff and landing side. This requires careful riding and a confident horse. Designers may make an obstacle more difficult by placing it along the side of a steep hill, at the top of a mound (so the horse can not see the landing until he is about to take off, testing bravery), or use the natural trees and ditches to force riders to take slightly more difficult lines to their fences. 

A good course designer will be able to incorporate the obstacles into the landscape so that they seem natural, yet still fairly test the horse and provide the horse an option to run-out if the rider makes a mistake. Most designers use accuracy fences, such as skinnies (fences with a narrow face) and corners, to make the rider&#x27;s job more difficult, while still being very &quot;horse-friendly.&quot;

All courses begin with a &quot;start box,&quot; where the horse and rider wait as the time keeper begins to count-down to their start time. They are not allowed to go out the front of the box before the timer reaches zero on the count-down, nor are they allowed to have a flying start. The first few fences of most well-designed courses are usually straightforward and inviting, such as a large log or roll-top, which helps to build the horse and rider&#x27;s confidence, get them settled in a galloping rhythm, and beginning to focus on the job at hand. The technicality of the obstacles then begins to increase, and elements such as banks, ditches, and water are introduced. The final fences of a course are usually slightly easier, to allow the horse and rider to finish on a good note, before they gallop across the finish.

===Footing===
Good footing is very important to most riders, as it helps decrease the wear-and-tear the sport has on their horses and avoid injury that may occur due to deep or slippery ground. The rider should always take care to note the footing while walking the course, and adjust the planned route to avoid patches that are especially boggy, slippery, or rough, and to avoid holes that may be present.

Footing is never used to make a course more difficult (for example, a fence is never purposely placed in a boggy area or one with sharp rocks). Instead, most competitions go out of their way to keep the footing safe, and many of the larger events may &quot;groom&quot; the footing to get it to the appropriate firmness.

===Walking===
Riders walk a cross-country course, usually between 1–3 times, before they actually ride it. This allows them to evaluate the course and determine how each jump needs to be ridden. While walking the course, riders need to be sure to pay attention to:

==Conditioning==

Conditioning is an essential part of preparing a horse for cross-country. Although the lowest levels may not require anymore riding than the usual 5 or 6 days each week used to train the horse, all upper level horses are placed into strict conditioning programs. Most riders plan their schedule around per-determined events, taking into consideration the length of the particular course, the climate in which they will have to run their horse, the speed that will be required, and the terrain over which they will be traveling (such as hills). In extreme situations, such as when riders had to condition their mounts for the intense heat at the Athens Olympics, horses will be shipped in early to certain locations to help their body adjust.

The rider must also consider the starting condition of the horse, the breed which they will be competing (heavier breeds will require more conditioning than most Thoroughbreds), and most importantly, the individual horse. Horses which have been brought to peak fitness before will generally be easier to get back to top condition than a horse that has never had to work at that level. Some horses need more distance work and others more speed work. Determining these factors is generally done through experience.

===Training for cross-country===
All horses are started with distance work, at a slow speed (usually a walk or trot), to improve endurance. This &quot;base&quot; of fitness is vital to ensure the horse is physically sound enough to progress to more rigorous work, such as galloping. Horses who do not have a base are much more at risk for soft tissue injury. After a base has been placed on the horse, riders add in galloping sets to improve cardiovascular fitness. Most riders use interval training, in which the heart rate is raised to a certain level before the horse is allowed a rest, and then the horse is again asked to work before the heart has a chance to fully recover. This can improve the cardiovascular fitness of the horse with less overall galloping, helping to maintain the horse&#x27;s soundness.

Work up an incline (hill work) is often favored over longer stretches of galloping for improving fitness, because it requires the horse to work harder while placing less wear-and-tear on their body. Through experience, a rider may gauge the difficulty of a hill and determine what its comparative worth is to galloping on a flat surface.

To condition the horse&#x27;s bones, riders may walk on roads or other hard surfaces. However, this is generally only used when the ground conditions are quite soft. Although popular in Britain, most American riders do not do road work. If used too much, it can encourage arthritis.

Some riders also have access to equine treadmills or swimming pools. Treadmills can sometimes be adjusted to have a slight incline, allowing the horse to work without the added weight of the rider. Swimming is an excellent form of conditioning, and allows the rider to increase the horse&#x27;s cardiovascular and muscular condition without adding undue stress to the bones or soft tissue.

===Considerations===
Riders should always be wary of the ground conditions. Conditioning on hard ground can cause lameness problems, both short and long-term. Conditioning on deep, heavy footing (such as right after a rain) increases the pull on the tendons, and may lead to soft tissue damage. Conditioning on slippery ground increases the risk that the horse will slip and have a soft-tissue injury. In general, older horses do better on softer footing, which is kinder to any joint problems they may have. Younger horses, which may not have the same strength of soft tissue, are best worked on slightly firmer ground.

The rider should also take care to &quot;slowly&quot; increase the amount of work. As a general rule, the distance may be increased or the speed may be increased, but not both at once. Pushing a horse too fast can lead to injury or lameness. The rider should also be aware of the horse&#x27;s breathing, and feel how tired the animal is underneath. Horses conditioning for the upper levels are often conditioned with heart rate monitors, so the rider will have a great insight into the horse&#x27;s condition over time.

The rider should always be willing to cut back conditioning work if the horse feels exhausted or if he has a very high respiration rate. Heat and humidity make work much harder, so should be considered while conditioning. Horses that are pushed too hard may injure themselves or may overheat, which can be deadly if not correctly cared for.

The rider must also understand that the muscling and improved cardiovascular fitness that is seen within a month or two of conditioning work does not indicate that the horse&#x27;s entire body is at the same peak. Soft tissue can take several months to condition, and bone, up to a year.

==Ideal cross-country mount==
At the lowest levels, most horses can be trained to successfully negotiate a cross-country course and, with proper conditioning, can usually make the time. As the rider moves up the levels, however, cross-country requires that the horse be very quick-thinking and well-trained, as the course increasingly becomes more technical and difficult to negotiate. The horse must also be very agile, and able to get out of a rough spot should a mistake occur. With proper training, the horse can develop what is referred to as a &quot;fifth leg,&quot; or an ability to save himself from falling, even if he trips over a fence or has a &quot;sticky&quot; jump.

Horses at the upper levels need to be bold and brave, willing to jump a variety of obstacles (at the highest level, cars and trucks are sometimes on course). Horses are taught to think for themselves, and the high degree of obedience that is required in dressage is not always desirable, as the horse must not always be looking to the rider for help. However, the horse must still be very ride-able and adjustable: horses that &quot;take over&quot; on cross-country and ignore their rider are usually not able to get through the more technical questions.

As horses move up the levels, their jumping ability becomes increasingly more important. Although horses do not need to have a very &quot;round&quot; jump—indeed, large bascule is often detrimental to an event horse while on cross-country because it wastes energy and time, and also makes certain jump efforts, such as drop fences, bigger than they really are—the horse should have a safe jump, with the forearms parallel to the ground or higher. The horse should also have enough scope to clear the obstacles, which although they never get exceedingly high (maximum of 3&quot;11&quot;) can be very wide.
An increase in level will also lead to an increase in the difficulty of the cross-country test: the course will be longer, with a greater number of jumping elements, more physically demanding terrain, and a faster speed required to make the time. Therefore, upper level horses must be able to achieve a high level of speed and stamina through training. Horses that are heavily muscled, such as draft horses, or those with short strides will require a greater amount of energy to complete the course and may not have the speed needed, regardless of the training they receive. Horses must also have good conformation and be naturally sound, as poorly-conformed horses will not be able to physically hold up to the demands that are placed on them. Most horses that compete today are Thoroughbreds, Thoroughbred-crosses (including the Irish Horse), and lightly built Warmbloods, or Warmbloods with a high degree of Thoroughbred blood, such as the Trakehner. However, should the horse possess the qualities needed to get around an upper-level course, breed is considered secondary to athletic ability.

==Scoring==
Because the lowest score wins, each combination of horse and rider seeks to complete the cross-country with as few penalties as possible. If larger faults occur, such as multiple refusals, the horse will be eliminated (E) from competition and will not be allowed to finish the course. Elimination has also been subdivided in the United States to include Technical Elimination (TE), if a mistake is made that is unrelated to the horse (for example, jumping two fences in the wrong order). Riders may also choose to retire (R) on course if their horse is having a poor run. This prevents the rider from continuing the competition, but is often a good choice if the horse is physically or mentally over faced by the challenges. Mandatory Retirement (MR) occurs if the horse falls, even if he is not noticeably injured, to help protect the horse&#x27;s welfare. Withdrawing (W) only occurs if the horse is taken out of competition when he is not on course. Rider may be disqualified (DQ) if they endanger their mount or other people on course. The United States added Dangerous Riding penalties in 2007, to be added at the discretion of the ground jury if a rider is going around the course in an unsafe manner (for example, at an extreme speed).
===Disobediences from the horse===
* First refusal or crossing tracks (circling) in front of an obstacle: 20 penalties per obstacle
* 2nd refusal or crossed tracks &quot;at the same obstacle&quot;: 40 additional penalties
* 3rd refusal or crossed tracks at the same obstacle (an &quot;obstacle&quot; includes all its elements): elimination
* 4th cumulative refusal or crossed tracks on the entire course: elimination

===Errors on course===
* Jumping obstacles in the wrong order (#5 before #4, or element B before A): elimination
* Jumping a fence in a direction which is not flagged: elimination
* Omission of a jump or compulsory passage: elimination
* Note: the only time a competitor may jump an obstacle twice in a row is if a refusal occurs at a second element (B) and the rider can not approach &quot;B&quot; without re-jumping &quot;A&quot; (a bounce, for example)
* Note: the horse is only allowed to jump from a standstill if the obstacle&#x27;s height is no higher than 30 cm (for example, banks and ditches). Jumping any other obstacles from a standstill (a &quot;prolonged halt&quot;) counts as a refusal.
* Note: horses are allowed to step sideways, but any step back is considered a refusal.
===Falls===

* Fall of Rider: Elimination
* Fall of horse (quarters and shoulder touches ground): Mandatory retirement
* Note: riders may dismount at any time on course without penalty. Dismounts attributed to attempting an obstacle are penalized as a fall.

===Time faults===
* Every second commenced above the optimum time, rounded up to the nearest second: 0.4 penalties/sec
* Exceeding the allowed time (2× the optimum time): elimination
* In the United States, going too fast for the level will result in &quot;Speed Faults&quot;: 0.4 penalties/sec for every second under the Speed fault time
* Trying to increase one&#x27;s time, or &quot;willful delay,&quot; to avoid speed faults (circling, serpentining, walking, or halting between the final fence and the finish): 20 penalties

===Other reasons for elimination===
* Rider without headgear or a &quot;fastened&quot; harness strap
* Improper saddlery (for example, riding with a running martingale and no rein stops)
* Overtaking another rider on course in a dangerous manner (for example, jumping a fence at the same time as the other rider)
* Willful obstruction of an overtaking competitor
* Failure to stop on course when signaled
* Horses head and front shoulder outside of the flags
* In lower level cross country competitions, failure to wear medical armband (at discretion of Ground Jury)

==Levels of eventing ==
In the United States, eventing begins at the Beginner Novice level, followed by Novice, Training, Preliminary, Intermediate, and then Advanced. 
Levels in the UK begin with BE80(T) – a training level event which runs slightly differently from normal classes, then BE90 (formerly known as Intro), then BE100 (formerly Pre-novice). In 2009, the Intro and Pre Novice classes were renamed BE90 and BE100 (the numbers relate to the height of the cross country fences in centimeters) in the hopes of making the sport easier to understand for the general public. In 2010, British Eventing introduced &quot;Foundation Points&quot; at the BE90 and BE100 levels in order to prove a horse&#x27;s success at the lower levels. Levels then continue from Novice, through Intermediate to Advanced at which success points are awarded to the top finishers (the number of finishers receiving points depends on the number of competitors in the event). A horse will accumulate points throughout its career (regardless of rider) and when a certain number of points have been reached the horse must compete at the next level up. Exceptions to this are the &#x27;open&#x27; classes, at which any horse can compete regardless of career success and also a horse may be allowed to compete in an event as &quot;hors concours&quot;, which means not eligible to be placed or awarded prizes or points. BE100+, Intermediate-Novice and Advanced-Intermediate are interim classes where the dressage and show jumping runs at the higher level, with the cross-country at the lower level. For example, an Intermediate-Novice class uses an Intermediate dressage test and Intermediate standard Show Jumping, but the cross-country takes place round a Novice level track. These classes are intended to help horse and rider step up to a higher level without the initial risk of the more demanding cross-country. The highest level of Cross Country is 5* forms part of international 3 day eventing.

==Types of cross country obstacles==

There are many different types of cross county obstacles, all designed, in some degree, to imitate or resemble obstacles that a horse and rider could theoretically encounter in actual cross-country riding. Some obstacles are single jumps, or &quot;verticals&quot; made of different types of materials. Some may have multiple elements taken in a single jump, such as triple bars or oxers, sometimes called &quot;spread&quot; fences. Water obstacles are also usually used on most courses, as are log jumps. Yet others are combinations of several elements including logs, banks, water, and ditches.

<text>The Critic is an American adult animated sitcom revolving around the life of New York film critic Jay Sherman, voiced by Jon Lovitz. It was created by writing partners Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had previously worked as writers and showrunners on the third and fourth seasons of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. 23 episodes of &quot;The Critic&quot; were produced. The show was first broadcast on ABC in 1994 and finished its original run on Fox in 1995.

Episodes featured film parodies with notable examples including a musical version of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;; &quot;Howard Stern&#x27;s End&quot; (&quot;Howards End&quot;); &quot;Honey, I Ate the Kids&quot; (&quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids/The Silence of the Lambs&quot;); &quot;The Cockroach King&quot; (&quot;The Lion King&quot;); &quot;Abe Lincoln: Pet Detective&quot; (&quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;); and &quot;Scent of a Jackass&quot; and &quot;Scent of a Wolfman&quot; (&quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;). The show often referenced popular films, such as &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; and &quot;The Godfather&quot;, and routinely lampooned Marlon Brando, Orson Welles, Woody Allen, and Dudley Moore, usually as his character Arthur Bach from the 1981 film &quot;Arthur&quot;.

Despite the ratings improving, &quot;The Critic&quot; was cancelled after two seasons. It continued to air through reruns on Comedy Central and then on Locomotion. From February 1, 2000, to 2001, ten webisodes were produced using Macromedia Shockwave; these webisodes were broadcast on AtomFilms.com and Shockwave.com.

In the late 2000s, reruns of the show aired again on ReelzChannel in the US and on Teletoon&#x27;s programming block Teletoon at Night in Canada.

==Premise==
The show follows the life of a 36-year-old film critic from New York named Jay Sherman. His televised review show, &quot;Coming Attractions&quot;, airs on the Philips Broadcasting cable network. Sherman is cold, mean-spirited, and elitist as a movie critic, but in his everyday life he has a gentler nature and is filled with self-doubt. His signature line, upon seeing a terrible film, is &quot;It stinks!&quot; Each episode is full of film references and parodies. Some of the secondary characters that are a part of Jay&#x27;s story include his zany adoptive parents and their biological daughter Margo, his well-meaning son Marty, the Australian film star Jeremy Hawke, his snide make-up lady Doris, his ex-wife Ardeth, and his boss Duke Phillips. In the second season, Jay acquires a love interest: a Southern woman named Alice Tompkins, who later becomes his long-term girlfriend.

==Episodes==

==Production==

The show was created by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who, along with James L. Brooks, served as executive producers. &quot;The Critic&quot; was produced by Gracie Films, the same company behind &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in association with Columbia Pictures Television. The show&#x27;s animation was done by Film Roman, who were also still working on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; at this time. It was co-produced by Patric Verrone.

Jean and Reiss were showrunners on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and had been approached by series creator Matt Groening to design a spin-off centered on Krusty the Clown. Their pitch featured many similarities to &quot;The Critic&quot; – Krusty would be a single father in New York with a prickly make-up lady and an eccentric boss resembling Ted Turner. Groening turned down the idea, instead wanting the Krusty spin-off to be a live-action series led by the character&#x27;s animated voice, Dan Castellaneta.

In 1993, Brooks approached Jean and Reiss with the idea of a sitcom based on a morning television program. The pair adapted their Krusty pitch to the new idea. Brooks recommended Jon Lovitz as the lead, based on his performance in &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;. Lovitz initially turned down the role due to his commitments with three upcoming films, so, at the last moment, the series became animated.

The show sometimes included appearances of real-life critics, such as Gene Shallit, Rex Reed, Gene Siskel, and Roger Ebert, who provided their own voices. When choosing things to parody, Reiss and Jean made a conscious decision to find the right balance between current pop culture and references that would stand the test of time.

===Broadcast===
&quot;The Critic&quot; was &quot;the first major non-family sitcom animated program to appear in primetime.&quot; The show started out on ABC on January 26, 1994, where it aired 13 episodes. It was cancelled by the network after half a season and was then moved onto Fox the following year, where it ran for another ten-episode season. Around this time, in an attempt to popularize the show, it was included in a &quot;shameless plug&quot; crossover with &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (in their episode &quot;A Star Is Burns&quot;) and was scheduled in the timeslot immediately after The Simpsons. But despite improvement of the ratings, Fox moved it to a different timeslot after five episodes and also cancelled it after this run had finished airing in May 1995. According to &quot;The TV IV&quot;, nine scripts were already written for the planned third season, and the show was going to be moved to UPN, but an agreement was not reached. Fox refused to officially cancel the show until much later. The show was not renewed on any network and effectively became cancelled. The show returned in Flash-animated webisode form in 2000–2001, for a third season, with 10 three- to five-minute installments. In Spain, it aired on Canal+ in the 1990s and on Cartoon Network from 2000 to 2001 through a nightly block aimed at adults, vaguely as a pre-beta to Adult Swim, both times alongside &quot;Duckman&quot;.

===Design===

Four people have a design credit on the show: David Silverman, Rich Moore, David Cutler, and Everett Peck. Silverman designed the look of Jay Sherman. Moore and Cutler designed the general look of the show including some of the backgrounds and supporting cast. The character of Doris was based on Peck&#x27;s drawings. Cutler helped standardize all these designers&#x27; styles. Moore was the supervising director and thus oversaw a lot of the design process; he was also responsible for how the action would play out and how each shot would be framed. Rich Moore explains &quot;the design of Jay Sherman began as a sketch done by David Silverman&quot; on a napkin/place-mat in a restaurant. He was designed as &quot;Kaufmanesque,&quot; and Jim Brooks liked the design, so his design remained much the same for the pilot episode. Moore had his reservations as the character had a &quot;flat head and tiny eyes that were hard to act with&quot; and was composed of shapes that were difficult to turn in a 3D space. It was decided, however, that the drawing encapsulated the humanity and reality of the character, so it was left unchanged. Nonetheless, over the course of the two seasons, the design was altered slightly. The flat head was made more round, and his eyes became bigger, to make Sherman more appealing and easier to animate. The design team never intended to make the characters too cartoony as it would not have fit tonally with the type of show. The characters were designed via a general think-tank process of &quot;what do we like about the characters and what are we trying to say about them?&quot;. Quick sketches were completed in front of the full creative team, after a discussion about characters, which were then critically analysed. In particular, the design of the parents caused some issues. Jim Brooks described the father as a &quot;crazy wasp.&quot; The designs were eventually based on a photo of a professor and his wife. Moore explains that the animation should never &quot;step on the voices or the writing.&quot;

Vlada, an Eastern European restaurateur, was named after Jean and Reiss&#x27;s film professor at Harvard University, Vlada Petrić. The character&#x27;s physical appearance was based on Gábor Csupó, a Hungarian animator on the early seasons of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Though some believed Sherman to look like the film critic James Wolcott, this was not intentional.

===Casting===
Script supervisor Doris Grau, who had played Lunchlady Doris on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, was cast as Sherman&#x27;s make-up lady, Doris. Four actresses, including Margaret Cho, were hired and dismissed as the voice of Sherman&#x27;s younger sister Margo. The role eventually went to the voice of Bart Simpson, Nancy Cartwright, who was pleased to finally be voicing a female. Duke Phillips, Jay&#x27;s Ted Turner-esque boss, was played by Charles Napier, using his real voice. Due to the sheer number of film and TV parodies, the team also sought character actors who could play many different roles. During the audition process, they asked them to perform their acts, which Reiss described as &quot;very entertaining.&quot; Maurice LaMarche impressed Jean by doing &quot;perfect&quot; impressions. LaMarche even beat out genuine Australians for the role of Australian actor Jeremy Hawke. He was often asked to work on his accent of a pop culture figure related to media just released or that would have been released by the time of the episode&#x27;s airing. Depending on who could do the voice better, the characters were divided up between Nick Jameson and LaMarche. Each would play about 20–30 characters per show. According to LaMarche, he played twenty-seven characters in one episode. He specialized in impressions, while Jameson&#x27;s specialty was accents and dialects.

==Relationship with &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==

Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; explains &quot;in creating &quot;The Critic&quot;, Al Jean and Mike Reiss set out to make the show as dissimilar from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as humanly possible&quot;. Nevertheless, there are many similarities between the two series. &quot;Gen X TV: The Brady Bunch to Melrose Place&quot; argues that &quot;The Critic&quot; became a critical success while other animated shows of the early 1990s flopped was because &quot;the makers of these shows failed to realize that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; didn&#x27;t become a hit because of animation [but] because of its style of humor&quot;, and says that &quot;The Critic&quot; understood this. It adds the show &quot;took the media-obsession/parody portions of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and created a separate show around them&quot;. &quot;Planet Simpson&quot; describes the show as &quot;the closest thing &quot;The Simpsons&quot; ever had to a spin-off.&quot; &quot;The Critic&quot; also shares &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ love for criticizing Fox and the audience, such as Jay&#x27;s frequent line &quot;You&#x27;re watching Fox, shame on you&quot; and &quot;&quot;The Critic&quot; will be right back, you TV-addicted couch monkeys&quot; before the show went to commercial break. Rabin said &quot;&quot;The Critic&quot; made its protagonist the anti-Homer Simpson. Where Homer is a booze-sodden everyman, Jay Sherman is an unabashed elitist. Where Homer is a rudely physical creature, Jay leads a life of the mind. Homer is a slob. Jay is a snob.&quot; While &quot;Springfield is very aggressively and deliberately Anywhere, United States, &quot;The Critic&quot; is an extended Valentine to a certain kind of pointy-headed East Coast elitism.&quot; PopMatters said &quot;&quot;The Critic&quot;″s humor is very much in the spirit of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, taken in a more brazenly surreal direction.&quot;

Matt Groening had no part in its inception, and wanted to make this very clear, so he would not be associated with any success or failure the show would have. He claimed that in the public consciousness, this was his show—a direct spin-off to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Many voice actors appear in both &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The Critic&quot;, and regulars on both shows have made cameos in the others. For example, Nancy Cartwright, Doris Grau, Tress MacNeille, Russi Taylor, and Jon Lovitz have all played primary/secondary characters on both shows. Maurice LaMarche, who played many characters on &quot;The Critic&quot;, &quot;played George C. Scott getting hit in the groin with a football&quot; in the crossover episode. His only line was &quot;Ow, my groin.&quot; He also did Jay&#x27;s belch in the episode.

===Crossovers===
In &quot;Dukerella&quot;, Jay and Alice attend a costume ball dressed as Homer and Marge. Homer and Bart Simpson made a brief appearance in &quot;Dial M for Mother&quot;. During an interview with Geraldo Rivera, Jay is asked about talking over the heads of his audience and does just that in his answer. An annoyed family watching changes the channel to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, where Homer—after stepping on a rake—exclaims, &quot;D&#x27;oh!&quot; and Bart replies, &quot;¡Ay caramba!&quot; The family&#x27;s father comments, &quot;Now, this I understand.&quot;

Jay makes a guest appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in &quot;A Star Is Burns&quot; presiding over a local film festival. When Jay enters the Simpson household, Bart is watching a &quot;Flintstones&quot;-&quot;Jetsons&quot; crossover show, which he criticizes; he then praises Jay and &quot;Coming Attractions&quot;/&quot;The Critic&quot;, before shuddering and saying to himself &quot;I feel so &quot;dirty&quot;.&quot; At the end of the episode, as he is leaving for New York, Jay offers the Simpsons an appearance on &quot;Coming Attractions&quot;/&quot;The Critic&quot;, but Bart declines, saying, &quot;Nah, we&#x27;re not going to be doing that.&quot; Jay has yellow skin when he appears on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; but pink skin on &quot;The Critic&quot;. This episode caused some conflict between &quot;Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening and executive producer James L. Brooks. Groening decided to take his name off the credits and did not appear in the DVD commentary. He publicly complained about the episode, which went to air in the end. He said &quot;for more than six months I tried to convince Jim Brooks and everyone connected with the show not to do such a cynical thing, which would surely be perceived by the fans as nothing more than a pathetic attempt to...advertise &quot;The Critic&quot; at the expense of the integrity of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.&quot; In response, Brooks said &quot;[Groening] is a gifted, adorable, cuddly ingrate. But his behavior right now is rotten. And, it&#x27;s not pretty when a rich man acts like this.&quot;

Jay appeared briefly on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; a few more times. In the episode &quot;Hurricane Neddy&quot;, he was in a mental hospital, apparently unable to say anything more than his catchphrase (&quot;It stinks! It stinks! It stinks!&quot;) In the episode &quot;The Ziff Who Came to Dinner&quot;, he is seen at Moe&#x27;s Tavern with all the other characters on the show that Lovitz voices or has voiced.

==Hallmarks==
Much like the opening sequence in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; with its chalkboard, sax solo, and couch gags, &quot;The Critic&quot; has a distinctive opening sequence featuring minor gags. Jay is always awakened by a disquieting phone call or radio news report, and eventually watches a clip that parodies a well-known film before delivering the same negative opinion: &quot;It stinks!&quot; He watches the closing credits in a theater and delivers one of four comeback lines (five, once the character of Alice Tompkins was added in the second season) to an usher who tells him the show is over.

==Themes==
One of the main elements featured on &quot;The Critic&quot; is the lampooning of the entertainment industry. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; mentioned that Jean and Reiss&#x27;s &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episodes have a high number of parodies, spoofs and homages from the characters watching television and films: &quot;They didn&#x27;t need any such excuse for film parodies on &quot;The Critic&quot; since Jay&#x27;s life was inherently and organically filled with film. It proved the perfect delivery system for an endless series of clever, bite-sized spoofs.&quot; The book &quot;I&#x27;m an English Major—Now What?&quot; epitomises this by recounting a scene where Jay is forced to rate films &quot;on a scale of good to excellent&quot;—thereby negating his credibility as a film critic. Sherman says &quot;but what if I won&#x27;t like something,&quot; to which his boss Duke replies, &quot;That&#x27;s what good is for.&quot; This shows the corruption of an industry that aims to provide unbiased thoughtful analyses of films, due to bribery and politics. Another example is in the June 22 episode &quot;L.A. Jay,&quot; where after trying to break into the film business by writing a script, which is revealed to be rather good, a studio buys it off him for $100,000 in order to bury it, thereby keeping quality out of the industry. While episodes typically dealt with his private life, Jay&#x27;s position as a film critic &quot;offer[ed] numerous opportunities for the show to satirize the film industry, establishing a dialogue with popular culture&quot; in a very similar way to what &quot;The Simpsons&quot; had been doing for years.

&quot;The Critic&quot; often made fun of celebrities and also frequently comments on television. For example, one episode satirizes Duke&#x27;s project involving making the films &quot;more attractive to a contemporary audience&quot; by &quot;inserting computer-generated happy endings&quot; (ex: &quot;Casablanca&quot;″s Rick Blaine gets his girl while the restored version of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;deadwood&quot; &quot;Spartacus&quot; combined with a chase scene spoofing &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;). The article &quot;Ten Frighteningly Prophetic Parodies from &quot;The Critic&quot;&quot; claimed that some of the show&#x27;s spoofs &quot;have come true (or close to true), proving that there really isn&#x27;t anything that&#x27;s too stupid for Hollywood to make&quot;.

GrabBagCinema said the show would appeal to cinema fans &quot;because it really understood movies, celebrities, Hollywood and humour...[you would understand] the references and [see] the effort the writers and animators put in, to recapture the movies you grew up loving and remembering... but they did it with clever humour that wouldn&#x27;t offend you.&quot; The same review praised how unlike many modern critics, Sherman was honest with how much he disliked certain films.

==Reception and legacy==

===Contemporaneous===
&quot;The Critic&quot; received mixed to positive reviews when it first aired. In 1994, The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave a typical review of the show with, &quot;Jay Sherman, the eponymous culture vulture of &quot;The Critic&quot;, would undoubtedly say his new animated comedy on ABC &#x27;stinks.&#x27; Fortunately for him [The Critic] smells pretty good to me.&quot; The show has since developed a cult following, with much of it coming through the show&#x27;s weekend reruns on Comedy Central up until about 2005.

The DVD set also got many positive reviews, such as one from Animated Views which gave it an overall rating of 10/10. Mike Reiss&#x27;s favourite episode is the Siskel and Ebert one.

In September 2006, IGN ranked &quot;The Critic&quot; ninth on its list of the &quot;Top 25 Primetime Animated Series of All Time&quot;. In January 2009, they ranked the show 26th in their other list of the &quot;Top 100 Best Animated TV Series&quot;. In the latter article, IGN said: &quot;Of all the projects completed by ex-Saturday Night Live players, &quot;The Critic&quot; is the most fully realized, hilarious and heartwarming. It took its cues from Woody Allen movies like &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;Manhattan&quot;, and offered up a style of random abstract humor that wouldn&#x27;t really be seen again until &quot;Family Guy.&quot;&quot; In December 2011, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked the show 6th in their list of &quot;The 25 Most Underrated Animated TV Shows Of All Time&quot;.

&quot;People&quot; magazine gave it a B, saying &quot;This animated series is slyly amusing when sticking it to showbiz, taking sarcastic swipes at everyone from Steven Seagal to Gene Shalit. At its best, it&#x27;s still several strides behind the savage, protean wit of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and the humor sputters when the focus is personal.&quot; Of the third season, IGN said &quot;I was thrilled to find out that Gracie Films has started producing new episodes of the cancelled ABC/Fox/Comedy Central show &quot;The Critic&quot;—and for web cartoons that don&#x27;t depend on the violence/swear cop-out for the humor, the shows are actually really well produced.&quot;

Early on in its run, &quot;Siskel and Ebert&quot; did a review of the show. It was the only television series they ever reviewed. Some of the criticisms they provided, if left unattended to, may have been factors to the show&#x27;s cancellation. They said the show didn&#x27;t have as many memorable characters as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and encouraged the writers to work on that. They said the second episode was a let down because &quot;it didn&#x27;t seem to be about the world of a movie critic,&quot; and was instead about &quot;a single dad and his geeky son.&quot; They said the jokes involving Jay&#x27;s dad get tiresome, and that the station boss isn&#x27;t as sharp a parody as he could be. Gene Siskel said, &quot;if &quot;The Critic&quot; is gonna succeed—and I hope it does—it desperately needs to refocus itself on the movies and the way critics interact with them.&quot; He added that the show needs a second critic, and jokingly said he and Roger Ebert should (and would love to) save the show by writing scripts for them. Ebert said the show should have 2 to 3 movie/genre parodies per episode. He added he would like to see Jay watch television to allow the show to satirize that medium as well. This would focus the show on the media, and not let it become another show about a man and his problems. Siskel said the writers should keep Jay as a smart critic. Regardless of his personality, if his critiques are witty and intelligent, by extension the show&#x27;s satire becomes much sharper. The two critics later appeared as themselves in an episode where they ended their partnership and each recruited Jay to join them for a new series; when Jay realized that Gene and Roger deeply missed working together, he engineered their reconciliation and went back to his own series.

===Later analysis===
AOL TV published an article in 2009 entitled &quot;Gone Too Soon: The Critic&quot;, in which they analyzed the cancellation of the show. It said &quot;The creators and Lovitz seem to [care about the show], as there are always talks cropping up of a revival of &quot;The Critic&quot;, either as an animated project, or possibly a live-action one. There are fan sites out there, but as time passes with no new material, many of these are becoming floating time capsules&quot;. Plus, a lot of effort was put into the release of the DVD (for which there was a lot of demand), meaning there is still a fan base as well as a passionate cast and crew.

&quot;Drawn to Television&quot; says that like Jay&#x27;s show-within-a-show Coming Attractions, &quot;audiences never quite warmed up to Sherman and his surrounding cast of characters&quot; in &quot;The Critic&quot;, perhaps due to the lack of warmth between character interactions in both shows. He also criticized the sometimes rather mean-spirited ways the fat jokes were directed at Marlon Brando or Orson Welles. The book &quot;The Magic Behind the Voices&quot; put its cancellation down to &quot;so-so ratings and network politics.&quot; &quot;Planet Simpson&quot; says it &quot;failed to click with &quot;Simpsons&quot; fans.&quot; In 1994, Austin American-Statesman said &quot;&quot;The Critic&quot; never had a prayer on ABC, where the comedy overload consists of domestic sitcoms&quot;. The show is generally considered one of the great TV shows cancelled too early into its run. The &quot;Columbia Spectator&quot; said the show was &quot;one of television&#x27;s great lost causes.&quot; Voice actor Maurice LaMarche considered &quot;The Critic&quot; one of his &quot;personal favorites,&quot; saying &quot;I would almost give anything to bring back &quot;The Critic&quot;, along with &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;; those are the two most satisfying jobs I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; Ogeeku said &quot;This show did not last as long as it should have and that is truly a shame. &quot;The Critic&quot; was in its time, one of the greatest animated shows ever made and one of the funniest shows period on television.&quot; Reiss thinks the show holds up very well.

PopMatters considered Sherman a perfect role for Lovitz, due to his strengths of &quot;sarcasm and ironic overacting,&quot; but believed that there were too many jokes about the character&#x27;s obesity, and these were too similar to and inferior to such jokes about Homer Simpson. The same review called the show &quot;outlandish in a way that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; would not adopt until later&quot;, and likened its cutaway humor to &quot;Family Guy&quot;. However, it considered the cutaways on &quot;The Critic&quot; to be better than those of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, due to &quot;Family Guy&quot;″s greater reliance on shock value.

<text>Lipót Schulhof (12 March 1847 in Baja – October 1921 in Paris; ; ; ) was a Hungarian-Jewish astronomer, born in the Austrian Empire, who first worked at the Vienna Observatory and later spent most of his time at the Paris Observatory, observing comets and asteroids.

He provided a prediction for the 1893 return of comet 15P/Finlay, discovered the main-belt asteroid 147 Protogeneia in 1875, and was awarded the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences in 1893. Schulhof won the Lalande Prize again in 1920 for his calculation, assisted by Joseph Bossert, of the orbit of the periodic comet 12P/Pons–Brooks, discovered in 1812 by Pons.

Schulhof calculated the orbits of many asteroids and comets, taking perturbative interactions into account. With his exhaustive studies of objects such as comet 27P/Crommelin and others, he advanced the recovery of lost comets as well as those of lost minor planets.

The main-belt asteroid 2384 Schulhof, discovered by Marguerite Laugier in 1943, was named in his honor.

<text>Collinsia heterophylla, known as purple Chinese houses or innocence, is a flowering plant native to California and the Peninsular Ranges in northern Baja California.

==Description==
&quot;Collinsia heterophylla&quot; is an annual plant growing in shady places, in height. It can be found in most of California (other than desert regions) below about .

It blooms from mid spring to early summer. Like other species in the genus &quot;Collinsia&quot;, which also includes the blue-eyed Marys, it gets its name from its towers of inflorescences of decreasing diameter, which give the plants in full flower a certain resemblance to a pagoda.

Dried in air, the seeds weigh about 1 mg each.

===Varieties===
*&quot;Collinsia heterophylla&quot; var. &quot;austromontana&quot;
*&quot;Collinsia heterophylla&quot; var. &quot;heterophylla&quot;

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described as &quot;Collinsia bicolor&quot; by George Bentham in 1835, but this name proved to be a later homonym of &quot;Collinsia bicolor&quot; Raf. (described in 1824), necessitating the name change to &quot;C. heterophylla&quot;. Despite this, the name &quot;C. bicolor&quot; is still sometimes used in references.

<text>Georges-Étienne Bonnet (; 23 July 1889 – 18 June 1973) was a French politician who served as foreign minister in 1938 and 1939 and was a leading figure in the Radical Party.

== Early life and career ==
Bonnet was born in Bassillac, Dordogne, the son of a lawyer. Bonnet&#x27;s father worked at the Cour de cassation and used his wealth to give his son the best education that money could buy in France. Bonnet was educated the elite Lycée Henri IV, École supérieure des hautes études and École des sciences politiques. Bonnet studied law and political science at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques and University of Paris.

Bonnet began his career as an &quot;auditeur&quot; at the Conseil d&#x27;État. In 1911, he launched his political career after he married Odette Pelletan, the granddaughter of Eugène Pelletan. Bonnet&#x27;s wife, often known as Madame Soutien-Georges, ran a salon and had great ambitions for her husband. One contemporary reported that Madame Bonnet was &quot;so wildly ambitious for her husband that when a new ministry was being formed he was afraid to go home at night unless he had captured a post for himself.&quot; Many privately mocked Bonnet for the way in which his wife dominated him. Bonnet&#x27;s wife&#x27;s nickname was a French pun on the word for brassiere (&quot;soutien-gorge&quot;) and was both a reference to Madame Bonnet and to the size of her breasts.

In 1914, Bonnet joined the French Army. During his service during the First World War, Bonnet was a much-decorated soldier who won the &quot;Croix de guerre&quot; medal for bravery under fire. in 1918 he served as director of demobilization. Bonnet served as the editor on Alfred de Tarde&#x27;s book &quot;L&#x27;âme du soldat&quot; (&quot;The Soul of a Soldier&quot;). Bonnet highlighted the passage by de Tarde in which he wrote: &quot;The France of 1914-1917 is more sincerely democratic than it has ever been, and she is in love with command&quot;. As an upper-class man, Bonnet was in some awe of the camaraderie and fighting spirit of the mostly lower-class &quot;poilus&quot; and saw it as his duty to record their experiences. Bonnet seemed to have been jealous of the toughness of the ordinary French soldiers, who lived under conditions that he could never accept. Bonnet often recounted the story of a &quot;poilu&quot;, named Lauteau, a happily married man with two children, who was killed while displaying a reckless disregard for his own life while he was repairing a telephone wire that had been severed by German artillery. Bonnet used the story of Lauteau as an example of the &quot;Union sacrée&quot; in action, as he argued in his 1919 book &quot;Lettres à un bourgeois de 1914&quot; that it was love of &quot;la patrie&quot; that had inspired the &quot;poilus&quot; to resist.

In 1919, Bonnet served as a secretary to the French delegation at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and wrote a book, &quot;Lettres à un bourgeois de 1914&quot;, that called for widespread social reforms. The British historian Anthony Adamthwaite noted that &quot;Lettres à un bourgeois de 1914&quot; was the last serious interest that Bonnet was to display in social reform.
Bonnet served in the Chamber of Deputies from 1924 to 1928 and again from 1929 to 1940. He was appointed undersecretary of state in 1925, the first in a series of high ministerial positions throughout the 1920s and the 1930s. During his time as in the Chamber, Bonnet was regarded as a leading expert in financial and economic matters. As a minister, Bonnet had a reputation for working hard, being always well prepared in parliamentary debates and excelling at political intrigue. In 1931, in response to an appeal for help from China, the League of Nations sent a group of educational experts to suggest improvements to the Chinese educational system. The experts were Carl Heinrich Becker, the former education minister of Prussia; the Christian Socialist British historian R. H. Tawney who was the only member of the group who had been to China before and who could speak some Mandarin; Marian Falski, a senior bureaucrat with the Polish Ministry of Education in charge of all primary schools in Poland; and the scientist Paul Langevin of the &quot;Collège de France&quot;. Bonnet joined the group, as he was serving as the director of the Paris-based Institution of Intellectual Co-Operation, and the League wanted someone outside of the educational system to serve as the chairman of the group.

On 30 August 1931, the group left for China and saw first-hand the furious protests that erupted all over China in response to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, which had started on 19 September 1931. Although most of the university and high school students in China were protesting the loss of Manchuria, the group was able to have cordial talks with Chinese educational officials about possible reforms and in 1932 released the book &quot;The Reorganisation of Education in China&quot;. In 1932, Bonnet headed the French delegation at the Lausanne Conference, where he first met Franz von Papen, who was serving as the German chancellor. During the Lausanne Conference, British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, commenting on Bonnet&#x27;s abilities, asked: &quot;Why isn&#x27;t he in the Cabinet?&quot;

==Economic expert ==
In 1933, Bonnet was a prominent member of the French delegation to the London Conference and was a leading critic of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s actions during the conference. In 1936, Bonnet emerged as the leader of 18 Radical deputies who objected to their party&#x27;s participation in the Popular Front. Bonnet was regarded as the leader of the right wing of the Radical Socialist party, which, despite its name, was neither radical nor socialist. As a result, the French Premier Léon Blum, a socialist, effectively exiled Bonnet in January 1937 by appointing him Ambassador to the United States even though Bonnet did not speak English.

Upon hearing of Bonnet&#x27;s appointment, the American Ambassador to France, William Christian Bullitt, Jr., wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt about Bonnet: &quot;I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll like him. He is extremely intelligent and competent on economic and financial matters, but he&#x27;s not a man of character. You may remember that he led the French delegation to the London economic conference where he led the attacks against you&quot;. Despite his short stay in the United States and his inability to speak English, Bonnet thereafter and for the rest of his life claimed to be an expert on all things American.
On 28 June 1937, Bonnet returned to France when Premier Camille Chautemps appointed him Finance Minister. Bonnet&#x27;s first major act as Finance Minister was to oversee the devaluation of the franc, the second devaluation in less than nine months, with the value of the franc going from 110.8 francs per British pound to 147.20. The devaluation was forced on Bonnet since the 10 billion francs that had been set aside in September 1936 in a currency reserve fund to defend the value of the franc after that year&#x27;s devaluation had been spent by mid-1937. As Finance Minister, Bonnet imposed sharp cuts in military spending. He felt that the costs of the arms race with Germany were such that it was better for France to reach an understanding that might end the arms race than continue to spend gargantuan sums on the military. Besides the economic problems associated with budgetary stability and his attempts to maintain the value of the franc against currency speculation, Bonnet was concerned with the social conflict caused by the need for increased taxation and the decreased social services to pay for arms.

In a meeting with Papen, now the German Ambassador to Austria, in November 1937, Bonnet and Chautemps expressed the hope that an understanding might be reached in which France might accept Central and Eastern Europe as Germany&#x27;s exclusive sphere of influence in return for German acceptance of Western Europe as France&#x27;s sphere of influence. Moreover, Bonnet became the leading spokesman within the French Cabinet for the idea that the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so-called &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, was a net liability that served only to embroil France in conflicts with Germany. Throughout his career, Bonnet was noted as an advocate of &quot;sacred egoism&quot;: French interests should always take precedence over other nations&#x27; interests. Bonnet regarded himself as a &quot;realist&quot;, and his thinking on foreign policy tended to be coloured in equal measure by pragmatism and insularity.

Bonnet&#x27;s cuts in military spending led to a clash with War Minister Édouard Daladier, who persuaded the Cabinet to rescind the most severe cuts to the French Army budget by pointing out that in the current international climate, the Army needed more funding, not less. Since the Ministers of the Air and the Marine were not as substantial personalities as Daladier, the French Navy and French Air Force could not reverse the Finance Minister&#x27;s cuts. In January 1938, after the fall of Chautemps&#x27;s government, Bonnet made a serious effort to form a new government but in the end had to content himself with being appointed Minister of State.

== Foreign Minister of the republic, 1938–1939 ==
===Appointment as foreign minister ===
In April 1938, after the fall of the second Blum government, Bonnet was appointed Foreign Minister under Daladier as premier (they had reconciled their 1937 quarrel). In 1938 and 1939, there were three factions within the French government. One, the &quot;peace lobby&quot; led by Bonnet, felt that France could not afford an arms race with Nazi Germany and sought a détente with the &quot;Reich&quot;. As an expert in financial matters and a former finance minister, Bonnet was acutely aware of the damages inflicted by the arms race on an economy that was already weakened by the Great Depression. A second faction, led by Paul Reynaud, Jean Zay and Georges Mandel, favoured a policy of resistance to German expansionism. A third faction, led by Daladier, stood halfway between the other two and favoured appeasement of Germany to buy time to rearm. The American historian Ernest R. May wrote: &quot;Small and dapper with a pointed long nose and a prominent Adam&#x27;s apple, Georges Bonnett was privately mocked behind his back for overdoing the bidding of his young, sensual and well-to-do wife, Odette Pelletan... But Bonnet was no lightweight... As a minister, he worked long hours, always knew his briefs and had formidable skill at parliamentary intrigue&quot;. The secretary-general of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, Alexis St. Léger, later wrote that of the many foreign ministers he served, Bonnet was the worst, and he described Bonnet as a man committed to appeasement.
Daladier left foreign policy largely to Bonnet as the best way of avoiding a war against Germany in 1938. In addition, Daladier felt that the best way of watching Bonnet was to include him in the Cabinet: he wished to keep the Popular Front together, but Bonnet wanted to pull the Radical Socialists out of it. Daladier&#x27;s thought if Bonnet were outside of the Cabinet, his ability to engage in intrigues to break up the Popular Front and seize the premiership for himself would be correspondingly increased. Including him in the Cabinet limited his room to maneuver. The Radical Socialist Party, which had a largely-lower-middle class membership, was divided between a left-liberal wing associated with Daladier that was willing to accept participation in the Popular Front as a way to defend France from fascism both at home and abroad and a right-wing &quot;neo-radical&quot; wing that was associated with Bonnet and saw the participation in the Popular Front as a betrayal of the party&#x27;s traditional defence of private property and capitalism. The &quot;neo-radical&quot; wing of the Radicals tended to support appeasement and saw the foreign policy of the Popular Front as potentially leading France into a disastrous war with Germany that would benefit only the Soviet Union. The Radicals were mostly the party of farmers, small businessmen and tradesmen but the party was dependent upon donations from wealthier businessmen, and the &quot;neo-radical&quot; Bonnet&#x27;s presence in an influential position as the foreign minister helped Daladier resist pressure from the more conservative Radical deputies, senators and the industrialists to pull the party out of the Popular Front. An additional complication in the Daladier-Bonnet relationship was posed by Bonnet&#x27;s desire for the premiership, which gradually led to a breakdown with his once warm relations with Daladier.

Bonnet was extremely critical of what he regarded as the &quot;warmongers&quot; of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, and from the very beginning of his time as Foreign Minister, he tended to exclude his senior officials from the decision-making progress and preferred instead to concentrate authority in his own hands. In Bonnet&#x27;s opinion, the Franco-Czechoslovak Treaty of 1924 committing France to come to the aid of Czechoslovakia in the event of a German invasion was a millstone and could lead France into a disastrous war with Germany. Bonnet believed that the best course for France in 1938 was to pressure the Czechoslovak government into conceding to German demands to prevent a Franco-German war. Alternatively, if the Czechoslovaks refused to make concessions, that refusal could be used as an excuse for ending the alliance. While pursuing that course, Bonnet not only kept his senior officials at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay uninformed but sometimes also Daladier. That led the Premier to rebuke his Foreign Minister several times for behaving as if French foreign policy was made by &quot;one minister&quot;.

Between 27 and 29 April 1938, Bonnet visited London with Daladier for meetings with Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax to discuss the possibility of a German-Czechoslovak war breaking out and what the two governments could do to stop such a war. During the talks, the French ministers argued for firm declarations that both nations would go to war in the event of a German aggression and agreed to a British suggestion that the two nations pressure Prague into making concessions to the Sudeten &quot;Heimfront&quot; of Konrad Henlein. The London summit marked the beginning of a pattern that was to last throughout 1938 in which the French would begin talks with the British by demanding a harder line against the &quot;Reich&quot; and then agree to follow the British line. In the view of Bonnet and Daladier, those tactics allowed them to carry out their foreign policy goals but provide them with a cover from domestic critics by presenting their foreign policy as the result of British pressure. As Bonnet told Bullitt, his &quot;whole policy was based on allowing the British full latitude to work out the dispute&quot; because otherwise, France would have to bear the main responsibility for pressuring concessions on Czechoslovakia. Throughout summer 1938, Bonnet allowed most of the diplomatic pressure that was applied to Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš for concessions to Henlein to come from London. That led to sharp complaints from the British that Bonnet should do more to apply pressure on Beneš.

Bonnet&#x27;s relations with Wellington Koo, the Chinese ambassador in Paris, were difficult, as Bonnet was in favour of ending arms shipments to China as a way of improving relations with Japan. One of the main supply lines that kept China fighting was the railroad linking of French Indochina to China. The arms from the Soviet Union were landed at the port of Haiphong and were taken via trains to China. Bonnet&#x27;s great rival, Colonial Minister Georges Mandel allowed the Soviet arms to be transshipped via French Indochina over the intense protests of Bonnet, who warned him that the Japanese would invade French Indochina in response. Mandel argued against Bonnet that to allow the Japanese to conquer China would make it more likely that the Japanese would try to seize French Indochina and so it was in France&#x27;s own self-interest to keep China fighting. When the dispute between Bonnet and Mandel reached Daladier, Daladier listened to Mandel.

Between 9 and 14 May 1938, Bonnet attended the spring sessions of the League of Nations in Geneva. There, Bonnet met with the Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov, who offered vague and evasive answers to Bonnet&#x27;s questions about what the Soviet Union proposed to do in the event of a German attack on Czechoslovakia. Meanwhile, Bonnet was informed by the Polish and Romanian delegations at the League that if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, they would refuse the Red Army transit rights to Czechoslovakia&#x27;s aid and that any Soviet violation of their neutrality would be resisted with force. After his return to Paris, Bonnet met a visiting Lord Halifax and urged him to &quot;work as hard as he could for a settlement in Czechoslovakia so that the French would not be faced with a crisis which they definitely did not want to face&quot;. As Halifax reported to the British Cabinet, Bonnet &quot;wanted His Majesty&#x27;s Government to put as much pressure as possible on Dr. Beneš to reach a settlement with the &quot;Sudeten-Deutsch&quot; in order to save France from the cruel dilemma between dishonouring her agreement [the Franco-Czechoslovak alliance of 1924] or becoming involved in war&quot;.

===May Crisis ===
During the 1938 May Crisis, Bonnet advised Lord Halifax on 21 May that Britain should warn Berlin that if the Germans attacked Czechoslovakia, Britain would become involved in the ensuing war, only to be informed that London had already delivered such a warning. In a talk with the British Ambassador, Sir Eric Phipps, Bonnet attacked Beneš for ordering partial Czechoslovak mobilization without informing France first and criticised Prague for its &quot;hasty action&quot;, but at a meeting with the Czechoslovak Minister to Paris, Štefan Osuský, on 21 May, Bonnet did not criticise Prague in violation of his promises to Phipps. Phipps urged Bonnet to use the crisis as an excuse to renounce the Franco-Czechoslovak alliance of 1924, but Bonnet refused unless France could secure a stronger commitment from Britain to come to France&#x27;s aid in the event of war with Germany. Throughout the 1938 crisis, Count Johannes von Welczeck, the German ambassador in Paris, reported to Berlin statements from Daladier and especially Bonnet that seemed to suggest that France would not to go to war if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. Adamthwaite wrote if the dispatches that Welczeck were sending back to Berlin recording what Bonnet had told him had been public knowledge in France in 1938, Bonnet would almost certainly would have been forced to resign in disgrace.
During the crisis, Bonnet issued a cautiously worded press statement supporting Prague but refused to issue a &quot;démarche&quot; in Berlin. At a subsequent meeting with Phipps on 22 May, Bonnet was informed not to interpret the British warnings to Berlin during the May Crisis as a blank cheque of British support for either Czechoslovakia or France. Bonnet took &quot;copious notes&quot; on the British message and stated that &quot;if Czechoslovakia were really unreasonable, the French Government might well declare that France considered herself released from her bond&quot;. On 25 May 1938, Bonnet told Welczeck that France would honour her alliance with Czechoslovakia if Germany invaded that nation, and he highlighted his main foreign policy goals when he declared that &quot;if the problem of the minorities in Czechoslovakia was settled peacefully, economic and disarmament problems might be considered&quot;.

Welczeck reported to Berlin on 25 May 1938 that Bonnet had told him during the same meeting that France &quot;recognised the effort&quot; made by German to prevent the May Crisis from turning into a war. Bonnet&#x27;s account of the meeting recorded him as saying, &quot;I pointed out to Count Welczeck that if I had not asked him officially to come earlier it was because I feared that in this period of tension it might have been considered that I was making a comminatory &quot;démarche&quot;&quot;. On 26 May, Bonnet received a note from Colonel Józef Beck, the foreign minister of Poland, that promised that Poland would go to war against Germany if France did so even though the Franco-Polish alliance was only a defensive one, and Beckwas ready for &quot;a friendly discussion of all new phenomena in Central Europ, based on a mutual understanding of the interests of France and Poland&quot;. Bonnet was not interested in Beck&#x27;s offer and did not reply.

On 31 May, Bonnet refused a British request for an Anglo-French &quot;démarche&quot; to Beneš demanding concessions to the Sudeten German &quot;Heimfront&quot;, but he promised to commit the French Minister in Prague, Victor de Lacroix, to do more to pressure the Czechoslovaks. In his instructions to Lacroix for the &quot;démarche&quot;, Bonnet instead merely asked for more information and stated: &quot;The information that you have transmitted to me on the state of the negotiations between the Prime Minister and the representatives of the Sudetens does not allow me to pronounce as fully as the British Government believes itself able to do on the character and substance of M. Henlein&#x27;s proposals... I ask you, therefore to obtain urgently the necessary details on the proposals submitted to M. Hodža&quot;. The British discovery of Bonnet&#x27;s instructions, which Lacroix inadvertently revealed to the British Minister in Prague, Sir Basil Newton, led to much Anglo-French recrimination.

===Sudetenland Crisis===
Bonnet was the leading voice for appeasement in France. He was a &quot;munichois&quot;, a defeatist and pacifist. The British historian Martin Thomas described Bonnet as the most &quot;active&quot; voice for the appeasement of Japan in the French Cabinet, as Bonnet argued that French Indochina, the most profitable French colony in the world, was militarily indefensible and that France must not provoke Japan by supporting China. From June 1938 onward, the prospect of war against Germany made Bonnet more in favor of the appeasement of Japan as he believed that Japan would take advantage of war in Europe to seize French Indochina. Throughout the spring and the early summer of 1938, Bonnet refused to apply pressure on Czechoslovakia through official channels and instead used unofficial emissaries to carry the message that France might not go to war in the event of a German invasion, which led Prague to place more assurance on French statements of public support that was warranted.

Bonnet had his friend, the journalist Jules Saurerwein, tell Beneš in an interview: &quot;Victory is not a state that endures forever&quot;. Not until 17 July 1938 would Bonnet issue a set of instructions to Lacroix, which explicitly warned Beneš and Czechoslovak Prime Minister Milan Hodža that because of the attitude of the British, France could not risk a war in 1938, and Prague should do its utmost to reach a settlement with Germany.
Starting with the May Crisis, Bonnet began a campaign of lobbying the United States to become involved in European affairs by asking that Washington inform Prague that in the event of a German-Czechoslovak war, the &quot;Czech government would not have the sympathy of the American government if it should not attempt seriously to produce a peaceful solution...by making concessions to the Sudeten Germans which would satisfy Hitler and Henlein&quot;. In a meeting with US Ambassador William Christian Bullitt, Jr. on 16 May 1938, Bonnet stated his belief that another war against Germany would be more dreadful than any previous war and that Bonnet &quot;would fight to the limit against the involvement of France in the war&quot;. As part of his effort to gain Bullitt&#x27;s trust, Bonnet showed the American notes received from the British ambassador, Sir Eric Phipps, during the May Crisis. In a radio broadcast that was sent directly to the United States on 4 July 1938, Bonnet proclaimed his belief in the &quot;common ideals&quot; that linked France and the United States as a way of pressuring for greater American interest in the crisis in Central Europe.

In June 1938, there was a major dispute between Daladier and Bonnet over the question of continuing French arms shipments to the Spanish Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. The Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War had created a major strategic problem for French policy-makers. Because of Germany&#x27;s greater population, it was considered crucial in France to tap the vast manpower of North Africa to compensate for it. That strategy required French control of the western Mediterranean to ensure that no inference would be possible with troop convoys from Algeria to Marseilles. As a result of the Italian intervention, a number of Italian bases had been set up in the strategic Balearic Islands. It was widely feared in France that the Italians would at least receive permission from the Spanish Nationalists to make their presence in the Baleric Islands permanent or even would ask for and receive the cession of them. The prospect of a Franco-German war breaking out with the Italians siding with the latter and using the Balearics to make naval and air attacks on French troop convoys was considered to be highly undesirable by French decision-makers, and a major objective of French foreign policy in the late 1930s was to remove the Italians from the Balearics. Daladier was for continuing arms shipments to the Spanish Republicans as long as the Italian forces were in Spain, but Bonnet argued for ending arms supplies as a way of improving relations with Italy and even told Phipps that his country should &quot;lay great stress with Daladier on the importance to the Pyrenees frontier remaining closed&quot;. It was Bonnet&#x27;s hope that ending arms supplies for the Spanish Republic would be reciprocated by a total Italian withdraw from all Spanish territory, especially the Balearics. Bonnet was successful in having the frontier closed.

After reports from General Joseph Vuillemin of the French Air Force after a visit to Germany about the strength of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and a memo from André François-Poncet, the French Ambassador to Germany, on 18 August 1938 stating that it was quite likely that Adolf Hitler planned to attack Czechoslovakia sometime soon, Bonnet began quite insistent for sending a joint Anglo-French warning sent to Berlin against plans to invade Czechoslovakia. On 22 August 1938, Bonnet had Charles Corbin, the French Ambassador in London, press for an explicit British commitment to come to France&#x27;s side in the event of war breaking out in Central Europe and use the ensuing British refusal as a reason to justify France&#x27;s lack of intervention in a possible German-Czechoslovak conflict. In August 1938, Bonnet started to become hostile towards what he felt was Daladier&#x27;s excessive belligerence and lack of willingness to compromise with the Germans and often urged in private for Daladier to change his stance.
On 9 August 1938, Welczeck reported to Berlin that Bonnet had told him earlier that day that &quot;we [the French] would have to go to the extreme limits of compromise in the Sudeten German question, even though this did not suit the Czechs&quot;. On 12 August, Bonnet, in a memo to Daladier, attacked Beneš for proposing to increase the length of military service in Czechoslovakia to three years, which he warned would offend Hitler. In the same memo, Bonnet warned against staff talks among the general staffs of France, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union as likely to offend Germany. Bonnet, however, went on to recommend informal contacts via the French military and air attaches in Moscow to find out what forces the Soviets planned to send to Czechoslovakia and finally to learn the answer to the long-sought question: the precise route that the Red Army planned to take on its way to Czechoslovakia. Bonnet promised also to use the influence of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay to bring in the general staffs of Poland and Romania. Only at the end would Bonnet reveal what Thomas called the &quot;sting in the tail&quot;: he also planned to keep the British government fully informed and knew very well that the Chamberlain government would object to even the limited informal talks that the memo had just proposed. In early September 1938, as part of his effort to prevent war by a mixture of threat and conciliation, Bonnet had a series of meetings with Welczeck and told him that France would honour the terms of the Franco-Czechoslovak treaty if the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia but insisted that his government was quite open to a compromise solution.

On 2 September 1938, Bonnet informed Welczeck, &quot;France was definitely going to stand by its commitments&quot;. However, Welczeck also wrote that Bonnet had told him that &quot;after a repetition of the general peace talk, which I have often heard from him, he added that... he himself, Daladier and other members of the cabinet were sincere admirers of the &quot;Führer&quot;... he, Bonnet, wished for nothing more ardently than to see the &quot;Führer&quot; in Paris as the guest of the French government... In the present situation, he wanted to leave no room for doubt that France and Britain at her side, were firmly resolved to hasten to the assistance of the Czechs if they were attacked by German troops... In France and Britain, however, nothing was so ardently desired as peace...we could depend upon it, that the Czechoslovak government would be forced to accept Runciman&#x27;s verdict, which in all probability would mean the fulfilment of 70, 80 or 90 percent of the Sudeten German demands&quot;. Welczeck consistently portrayed Bonnet in his reports as a man who did not want to honour France&#x27;s alliances with Czechoslovakia in 1938 and Poland in 1939.

During a speech delivered on 4 September 1938 at the unveiling of a commemorative plaque at Pointe de Grave honouring La Fayette&#x27;s departure to America in 1777 and the arrival of the American Expeditionary Force in 1917, Bonnet stated obliquely that France would go to war if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia and expressed the hope that the US would fight on France&#x27;s side. During the same ceremony, Bullitt stated that &quot;France and the United States were united in war and peace&quot;, which led to a storm of criticism by American isolationists and to a statement from President Franklin D. Roosevelt that it was &quot;100 per cent wrong&quot; the US would join a &quot;stop-Hitler bloc&quot;. Roosevelt&#x27;s statement had the effect of confirming Bonnet in his course of seeking to avoid a war with Germany. In addition, a highly exaggerated estimate of the strength of the Luftwaffe presented by Charles Lindbergh in August 1938, supplemented by a highly-negative assessment of the ability of the French Air Force by Vuillemin to survive a war, had the effect of reinforcing Bonnet&#x27;s determination to avoid a war with Germany.

When it appeared quite likely in mid-September 1938 that war could break out at any moment in Central Europe after Hitler&#x27;s violent speech blasting Czechoslovakia on 12 September and a failed revolt in the Sudetenland, Bonnet become quite frantic in his efforts to save the peace. Bonnet told Phipps, &quot;I repeated all this with emotion to Sir Eric Phipps telling him that at no price should we allow ourselves to be involved in war without having weighted all the consequences and without having measured in particular the state of our military forces&quot;. On 14 September, Bonnet told Phipps, &quot;We cannot sacrifice ten million men in order to prevent three and half million Sudetens joining the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;. Bonnet went on to advocate as his preferred solution to the crisis the neutralization of Czechoslovakia with wide-ranging autonomy for the Sudetenland, but he was prepared as a &quot;last resort&quot; to accept a plebiscite on the Sudetenlanders joining Germany. During the same conversation, Bonnet &quot;expressed great indignation with the Czechs who, it seems, mean to mobilise without consulting the French... he has therefore given a broad hint to Beneš that France may have to reconsider her obligations&quot; and that &quot;we are not ready for war and we must therefore make the most far-reaching concessions to the Sudetens and to Germany&quot;. At a summit meeting in London with the leading British ministers on 18 September, Bonnet and Daladier agreed formally to the idea of ceding the Sudetenland to Germany but pressed strongly as the price for making such a concession a British guarantee of the remainder of Czechoslovakia.

On his return to Paris, in a meeting with the Czechoslovak minister to France, Štefan Osuský, Bonnet was very vehement for Prague to agree at once to the Anglo-French plan that had been agreed to in London. In a letter to Daladier on 24 September 1938, Bonnet wrote, &quot;If France declared war against Germany, her position would be weaker than at any time since 1919. In fact, France in this case would have to stand alone on land the force of the combined German and Italian armies, without counting Japan, which in the Far East, will doubtless attack Indo-China... For five months, night and day, in the course of our confident collaboration, we have struggled for peace. I beg you to continue in this course. It is the only one which can save the country&quot;. At the same time, Bonnet&#x27;s relations with René Massigli, the Quai d&#x27;Orsay&#x27;s Political Director, began to deteriorate quite rapidly, as Massigli felt that Bonnet was too anxious to avoid a war at any price.

On 25 September, Daladier and Bonnet returned to London for another set of meetings with Chamberlain and Halifax. During the summit, Bonnet said almost nothing. The man Bonnet most feared in September 1938 was Litvinov, who he was convinced would make an offer of Soviet support, which would ensure that Beneš rejected the Anglo-French peace plan that just been imposed on him. That, in turn, would lead to Germany invading Czechoslovakia. When Britain rejected Hitler&#x27;s Bad Godesberg ultimatum on 26 September, Bonnet sought to prevent the news of the British rejection appearing in the French press, as it now appeared that British were pushing the French towards war and depriving him of using British pressure as an excuse. As the crisis reached its climax in late September 1938, Bonnet called upon his &quot;peace lobby&quot;, a collection of various politicians, journalists and industrialists to pressure the Cabinet against going to war for Czechoslovakia. Some of the prominent members of Bonnet&#x27;s &quot;peace lobby&quot; were the politicians Jean Mistler, Henri Bérenger, Jean Montigny, Anatole de Monzie, François Piétri, Lucien Lamoureux, and Joseph Caillaux; the industrialist Marcel Boussac; and the journalists Jacques Sauerwein, Emile Roche, Léon Bassée, and Emmanuel Berl. Together with Bonnet, the &quot;peace lobby&quot; sought to influence the government both within the corridors of power and by appealing to public opinion. In that regard, Bonnet especially valued the contribution of his close friend Bassée, who served as the political director of the Havas news agency. Another unofficial member of the &quot;peace lobby&quot; was Phipps, whose dispatches to London often reflected Bonnet&#x27;s influence. The most celebrated of Phipps&#x27;s dispatches was a message on 24 September 1938 that claimed that &quot;all that is best in France is against war, almost at any price&quot; and that they were opposed by a &quot;small, but noisy and corrupt, war group&quot;.

In the aftermath of the British rejection of the Bad Godesberg ultimatum, Daladier stated at a Cabinet meeting that if Hitler persisted with the terms of the ultimatum, France &quot;intended to go to war&quot;. At a Cabinet meeting on 27 September, Bonnet spoke out against French mobilisation and threatened to resign if the Cabinet ordered such a step. The atmosphere at the Cabinet meeting was very tense, as Daladier insisted upon mobilisation, which led to many heated words between him and Bonnet. At the cabinet meeting of 27 September, Bonnet&#x27;s case was greatly helped by the report of Vuillemin, who stated that most of the aircraft of the French Air Force were obsolete and that in the event of war, 40% of all French aircraft would be destroyed within the first month and 64% in the first two months. Bonnet used Vuillemin&#x27;s report at a cabinet meeting on 27 September with great effect, and two hours after the meeting, Daladier agreed with him that France must avoid a war at almost any cost.
The crisis was suddenly averted on 28 September, when Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that he had received an invitation from Benito Mussolini for a four-power conference to be held on 30 September in Munich to settle the crisis. Bonnet was very much for of the Munich Conference of 30 September, which averted the war that he opposed, but he was not part of the French delegation to the Munich Conference as Daladier was afraid of what Bonnet might do if he attended it.

After the Munich Conference, Bonnet visited his hometown of Périgueux, where he was greeted with a deluge of flowers and shouts of &quot;Vive Bonnet!&quot; and &quot;Merci Bonnet!&quot; Bonnet, who long been opposed to the Radical Socialists taking part in the Popular Front, used the communist demonstrations against the Munich Agreement as an argument for pulling the Radicals out of the Popular Front. He saw France as primarily as a &quot;Mediterranean&quot; nation, which should not be involved in Eastern Europe, and believed that the Munich Agreement was the beginning of a disengagement from Eastern Europe, which would allow France to focus on its colonial empire and its interests in the Mediterranean.

===From Munich to Prague===
Relations between Bonnet and his officials at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, especially Massigli, were very poor, which led to Bonnet to condemn Massigli quite strongly in his memoirs. In turn, Massigli accused Bonnet of seeking to alter the documentary record in his favour by falsifying and burning documents. In the aftermath of Munich, relations between Bonnet and Massigli, which had already been poor, declined even further. On 24 October 1938, Bonnet had Massigli sacked as the Quai d&#x27;Orsay&#x27;s Political Director and exiled him by having him serve as Ambassador to Turkey. Massiglii first learnt that Bonnet had fired him by reading his morning newspaper.

On the same day that Massigli was exiled, Pierre Comert, the Director of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay&#x27;s Press Service, whose news releases during the Czechoslovak crisis were not in accord with the line that Bonnet wanted to hear, was sent off to the American department. Bonnet had also wanted to sack the Quai d&#x27;Orsay&#x27;s Secretary-General Alexis Saint-Legér Léger and replace him with a man more in tune with his policies, but Saint-Legér Léger&#x27;s increasing friendship with Daladier served to protect him. A popular legend has it that Saint-Legér Léger was not fired because he knew too much about stock market speculations that Bonnet was alleged to have engaged in during the war crisis of September 1938, but there is no evidence to support that story. In the aftermath of the purge, Bonnet was congratulated by Phipps for removing the &quot;warmongers&quot; Massigli and Comert from the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, but Phipps went on to complain that the &quot;warmonger&quot; Saint-Legér Léger should have been sacked as well. In response, Bonnet claimed that he and Saint-Legér Léger saw &quot;eye to eye&quot;, which led to Phipps, who knew about the true state of relations between them, to remark drily that &quot;in that case the eyes must be astigmatic&quot;. On 2 October 1938 former British Cabinet Secretary Sir Maurice Hankey wrote in his diary about the recent visit to Paris by the anti-appeasement Conservative MPs Winston Churchill and Edward Spears to contact anti-appeasement politicians in France: &quot;Winston Churchill&#x27;s sudden visit to France by aeroplane, accompanied by General Spears, and his visit only to the members of the French government like Mandel, who is opposed to the policy of peace, was most improper-Bonnet, the French Foreign Minister has complained about it, asking what we would say if our prominent French statesmen did the same: he has also protested against being rung up by Churchill and Spears from London for information&quot;. On 12 October 1938, Bonnet told Phipps that he envisioned &quot;some revision of France&#x27;s engagements towards Russia and Poland&quot;.

On 19 October 1938, at the last meeting between the French ambassador to Germany, André François-Poncet, who just been appointed ambassador to Italy, and Adolf Hitler, the former had suggested to the latter that a Franco-German Declaration of Friendship might offer a way of improving relations between the two countries and avoiding a repeat of the crisis of September 1938. When François-Poncet reported to Paris Hitler&#x27;s favourable attitude towards such a declaration and his willingness to send Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to Paris to sign the proposed declaration, Bonnet enthusiastically embraced the idea and felt that such a declaration might open the way for a series of economic and cultural agreements that would end forever the prospect of another Franco-German war. Bonnet was also jealous over the Anglo-German Declaration of 30 September, which Chamberlain had forced upon Hitler after the Munich Conference and wanted his own declaration.

In October 1938, the French opened secret talks with the Americans with the aim of buying American aircraft to make up productivity deficiencies in the French aircraft industry. Daladier commented in a message to Roosevelt: &quot;If I had three or four thousand aircraft Munich would never have happened&quot;. The major problems in the Franco-American talks were the issue of how the French were to pay for the American aircraft and the implications of American Neutrality Acts about such sales. An even greater problem was that the American Johnson Act forbade loans to nations that had defaulted on their debts to the United States, which the French had done in 1932 by ceasing to repay the loans that they had contracted during the First World War, which made it impossible for American banks to lend money to pay for the American aircraft. In February 1939, the French offered to cede their possessions in the Caribbean and the Pacific to the United States, together with a lump sum payment of ten billion francs, in exchange for the ability to access loans from American banks to buy American aircraft.

In October 1938, Bonnet became increasingly preoccupied with the subject of Jewish refugees from Germany who were arriving in France in increasing numbers, and sought a &quot;friendly settlement&quot; with Germany. In November 1938, Chamberlain and Halifax visited Paris, where Bonnet told them that he was &quot;much preoccupied with the question of Jewish immigration into France&quot;. Bonnet stated that although France had accepted 40, 000 Jewish refugees, &quot;France could not a stand a Jewish immigration on a large scale. She was already saturated with foreigners, of whom there were about 3 million in the country&quot;. Bonnet complained that the United States, by far the favourite destination of Jewish refugees, was unwilling to change its immigration quotas, which left him with two alternatives: to send Jewish refugees to one of the European colonies in Africa and/or for Germany to permit Jews to emigrate &quot;normally&quot;. The last statement was a reference to the practice of the &quot;Reich&quot; government of asset-stripping German Jews of almost everything that they owned as the condition for leaving Germany, which led Bonnet to comment that it &quot;would greatly facilitate matters&quot; if Jewish refugees ceased to arrive in France penniless.

On 31 October 1938, Bonnet informed Welczeck that he wanted to see the German draft of the Declaration of Franco-German Friendship in the near future, as he wanted to sign the declaration before the end of 1938. Bonnet warned Welczeck that the French people had celebrated the Munich Agreement, which prevented a world war in 1938, but French public opinion was turning against the Munich Agreement with the feeling being that France had sacrificed too much in exchange for nothing in return. Bonnet expressed his concerns about the declaration being signed before the coming visit of Chamberlain to Paris on 24 November 1938 and stated that he wanted to avoid the impression that &quot;the agreement had been made under British tutelage&quot;. On 8 November 1938, Welczeck informed Bonnet that Ribbentrop did not share his fears about Chamberlain&#x27;s visit and that signing the declaration was not viewed as an especially-urgent matter in Berlin.

Throughout his career, Bonnet was widely respected for his intelligence but often inspired great mistrust in others, in part because of his highly secretive methods of working and his preference for verbal, as opposed to written, instructions. During his time as Foreign Minister, Bonnet was distrusted by the British, Daladier and senior officials in the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, all of whom suspected that he was in some way not quite being honest with them. Neville Chamberlain described Bonnet as &quot;clever, but ambitious and an intriguer&quot;. Colonies minister Georges Mandel said, &quot;His long nose sniffs danger and responsibility from afar. He will hide under any flat stone to avoid it&quot;. The anti-appeasement French political columnist André Géraud, who wrote under the pen-name Pertinax, stated that Bonnet pursued only the line &quot;of least resistance&quot;. Winston Churchill described him as &quot;the quintessence of defeatism&quot;. In December 1938, Lord Halifax&#x27;s private secretary, Oliver Harvey, referred to Bonnet as &quot;a public danger to his own country and to ours&quot;. In December 1939, British Chief Diplomatic Advisor Robert Vansittart wrote: &quot;As to M. Bonnet he had better trust to time and oblivion rather than to coloured self-defence. He did a lot of really dirty work in 1938... if I ever had to play cards with M. Bonnet again I would always run through the pack first, just to make sure that the joker had been duly removed&quot;. Throughout &quot;Berlin Diary&quot;, the author William L. Shirer referred to him as &quot;the insufferable Georges Bonnet&quot;.

Others were more sympathetic to Bonnet. Lord Halifax wrote in response to Vansittart&#x27;s memo: &quot;I am disposed to think but I know it is a minority view that M. Bonnet is not so black (or so yellow) as he is often painted&quot;. Joseph Paul-Boncour, a political opponent of Bonnet and his predecessor as foreign minister, spoke of his great &quot;kindness and help&quot;. The editor of &quot;Le Petit Parisien&quot; newspaper, Élie J. Bois, felt that Bonnet had &quot;the makings of a good, perhaps a great, foreign minister&quot;. On another occasion, Bois, who disliked Bonnet, wrote of Bonnet&#x27;s &quot;features...instinct with the intelligence of a fox on the alert&quot;. Bonnet&#x27;s friend, Public Works Minister Anatole de Monzie commented, &quot;Whilst very courageous in the long run, he is much less so in the heat of the moment... Because he is reticent, he is accused of lying or of deceit. False accusation... Bonnet is discreet so that his policy may be successful... There is in him an obvious ability, an excessive flexibility. He jumps too quickly, on to the bandwagon, on to all bandwagons. What does it matter to me?... If he aims for the goal and means to reach it by devious means, I care only for the goal. Now I note that having adopted the peace party, he is sticking to it with all the foresight of a statesman&quot;. The French historian Yvon Lacaze has argued against the popular image of Bonnet as a slick and amoral opportunist and instead attributes Bonnet&#x27;s views about avoiding another war with Germany to his memories of service in the trenches of the First World War .

In the fall of 1938, Bonnet started to advocate the ending of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe and ordered his officials at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay to start preparing grounds for renouncing the French treaties with the Soviet Union and Poland. Speaking before the Foreign Affairs Commission on the Chamber of Deputies in October 1938, Bonnet spoke of his desire to &quot;restructure&quot; the French alliance system in Eastern Europe and of his wish to &quot;renegotiate&quot; treaties that might bring France into a war &quot;when French security is not directly threatened&quot;. In his efforts to end the eastern alliances, Bonnet found his hands tied by opposition from other members of the French government. As he noted during talks in October with a group of Deputies that had formally asked the Foreign Minister to end French commitments in Eastern Europe, &quot;If I was free, I would carry out your policy; but I am not: I would have against me the majority of the Cabinet, led by Reynaud and Mandel, and I cannot count on Daladier, for Gamelin believes that in the event of war Polish military assistance would be indispensable&quot;. As part of his general tendency towards seeking to weaken the eastern alliances, Bonnet did his best to put off giving the international guarantee to Czecho-Slovakia that France had promised during the Munich Agreement. On 24 November during Chamberlain&#x27;s visit to Paris, Bonnet deprecated the Franco-Soviet alliance, which he dismissed as being inconsequential and told Chamberlain that the alliance would never come into effect if a German-sponsored Ukrainian nationalist movement were to win Soviet Ukraine independence from the Soviet Union.

On 25 November 1938, Bonnet informed the French Ambassador to Poland, Léon Noël, that France should find an excuse for terminating the 1921 Franco-Polish alliance, but found that his views on that issue created considerable opposition within the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, which was argued that Poland was too valuable an ally to be abandoned, and if France renounced the Polish alliance, Warsaw would align herself with Berlin. On 30 November 1938, there were what were very misleadingly described as &quot;spontaneous&quot; demonstrations in the Italian Chamber of Deputies, which had been organised by Benito Mussolini and his Foreign Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, who demanded that France cede Tunisia, Corsica, Nice, and French Somaliland (now Djibouti) to Italy. At the cue call, all of the fascist deputies rose up to scream abuse at France, which Ciano sought to explain away as merely an expression of the &quot;spontaneous&quot; rage felt by the Italian people over the French &quot;occupation&quot; of the lands that he insisted rightfully belonged to Italy. Mussolini believed in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement that France was no longer a great power, and now was the time to pursue Italian irredentist ambitions against France. In response, Bonnet sent out a message to François-Poncet, who was now the French Ambassador in Rome, to inform him that he should see Count Ciano to complain, &quot;Such behaviour may appear rather unusual in the presence of the French Ambassador and immediately following the unconditional recognition of the Italian Empire&quot;. That was in reference to the French recognition of the annexation of Ethiopia.

In December 1938, during the visit of German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to Paris to sign the largely-meaningless Franco-German Declaration of Friendship, Ribbentrop had conversations with Bonnet that he later claimed included a promise to him that France would recognise all of Eastern Europe as Germany&#x27;s exclusive sphere of influence. Ribbentrop was to use Bonnet&#x27;s statement to convince Hitler that France would not go to war to defend Poland in 1939. Both Bonnet and Saint-Legér Léger were quite vehement in insisting that no such remark had ever been made. Bonnet spent much of 6–7 December 1938 talking to Ribbentrop about the need for a &quot;solution to the Jewish problem&quot;, by which he meant shipping Jewish refugees to the French colony of Madagascar. On 15 December 1938, Bonnet gave his account of his meeting with Ribbentrop at the Hôtel Crillon on 7 December 1938 to Edwin C. Wilson, the counsellor of the American embassy, in which he mentioned no moral objections to Nazi policies and instead asked for Germany to be &quot;more reasonable&quot;. The Canadian historian Michael Marrus and the American historian Robert O. Paxton wrote, &quot;On the subject of Madagascar, Bonnet&#x27;s postwar version is entirely misleading&quot;.

In January 1939, Bonnet commissioned a study for the French Cabinet that concluded that the 1935 Franco-Soviet alliance was now defunct, and there were no grounds for hope about help from the Soviet Union. Rumours in the French press over the winter of 1938–1939 that France was seeking the end of the eastern alliances generated concerns both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the press, which led Bonnet to state in a speech to the Chamber on 26 January 1939: &quot;So, gentlemen, let us dispose of the legend that our policy has destroyed the engagements that we have contracted in Eastern Europe with the USSR and with Poland. These engagements remain in force and they must be applied in the same spirit in which they were conceived&quot;. In response to Bonnet&#x27;s speech, Ribbentrop summoned the French Ambassador to Germany, Robert Coulondre, on 6 February 1939 to offer a formal protest over his speech. Ribbentrop told Coulondre that because of Bonnet&#x27;s statement of 6 December 1938 accepting Eastern Europe as Germany&#x27;s zone of influence meant that &quot;France&#x27;s commitments in Eastern Europe&quot; were now &quot;off limits&quot;, a claim that stunned Coulondre.

Besides seeking to end the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, Bonnet&#x27;s major initiative in foreign policy after Munich was a series of economic agreements that he sought to negotiate with the Germans. Bonnet&#x27;s economic diplomacy was intended to achieve four goals:
*He wanted to end the Great Depression in France;
*Like many other appeasers on both sides of the Channel, Bonnet believed that German foreign policy was driven by economic grievances, not by Nazi racial theories about &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, which Bonnet considered far-fetched, as he felt that the Nazis did not take their ideology seriously. Thus, in Bonnet&#x27;s view, arrangements to offer Germany greater prosperity would tame German complaints against the existing international order and reduce international tensions.
*Like other economic experts around the world in the 1930s, Bonnet was disturbed by the implications of the increasing tendency in Germany towards protectionism, currency manipulation, use of &quot;blocked accounts&quot; for foreign businesses in Germany and foreign-holders of German debt, autarky, a growing statism in the German economy and the Germans&#x27; drive to create their own economic zone in Europe since he felt that Franco-German economic agreements would at least ensure that France would not be locked out of the German economic sphere of influence and even moderate some of the most worrisome German economic practices.
*He wanted a Franco-German friendship that would both banish the prospect of another war and end the arms race that had placed such a burden on the French economy.

However, during the winter of 1938–1939, negotiations with the Germans proceeded slowly, in large part because the Germans refused to abandon the economic policies that caused such concern. The atmosphere, following the German destruction of Czecho-Slovakia (as Czechoslovakia had been renamed), on 15 March 1939 was not considered conducive for France to be pursuing any sort of agreements with the Germans, and the talks were called off, never to be resumed. At the same time, Bonnet ordered Charles Corbin, the French Ambassador in London, to warn Chamberlain and Lord Halifax during their scheduled visit to Rome in January 1939 against any weakening of Anglo-French relations in exchange for improved Anglo-Italian relations. During a meeting between François-Poncet and Count Ciano, the latter claimed that the anti-French demonstrations were purely &quot;spontaneous&quot; and did not reflect the views of his government. As part of an effort to gain British support against the Italian campaign, Bonnet issued a statement that France would always rush to Britain&#x27;s aid in the event of aggression, in the hope that his statement might lead to a similar British statement of support for France. In January 1939, a pro-appeasement British newspaper proprietor, Kenneth de Courcy, reported after a visit to Paris: &quot;Monsieur Bonnet seems to be generally distrusted by most Frenchmen of the centre and right&quot;. However, the fiercest criticism of Bonnet came from the French left, which saw him as a someone who was all too willing to make deals with fascist regimes.

In early January 1939, Bonnet and Daladier approved of the idea of sending the banker Paul Baudoin as an unofficial diplomat to find out just what exactly the Italians wanted from France. The reasoning for the Baudoin mission was if the price of Italian friendship was not too expensive, it might be worth paying as a way of detaching Italy from Germany and thus reducing France&#x27;s potential enemies. When Baudoin visited Rome in February 1939, he reported that the Italians were asking only for some economic concessions from the French in the Horn of Africa and Italian representation on the board of the Suez Canal Company. However, before any decisions were made in Paris about accepting the Italian demands, the news of Baudoin&#x27;s secret visit was leaked to the French press, which forced Bonnet to disavow him. In response to furious complaints from François-Poncet about Baudoin&#x27;s mission, which he had first learned about after the story had been leaked, Bonnet replied to François-Poncet, &quot;The rumours you are telling me have no basis in fact. You are fully aware that any conversation, any Franco-Italian negotiation official or unofficial could only be handled by you, and that no direct or indirect transaction could be considered outside your purview&quot;.

In January 1939, negotiations were opened between France and Turkey over resolving the Hatay dispute. Leading the French delegation were Gabriel Puaux, the High Commissioner of Syria and Massigli, the French Ambassador in Ankara. The continuing feud between Massigli and Bonnet was reflected in Bonnet&#x27;s habit of refusing Massigli negotiating instructions for weeks on end to place Massigli in an embarrassing situation during his talks with the Turks. During the Franco-Turkish talks, Bonnet had first backed Puaux against any weakening of French control over the &quot;Sanjak&quot; of Alexandretta before he decided to settle the dispute in favour of the Turks as a way of potentially winning Turkish support in the event of a war with Germany. Despite efforts to maintain some sort of French presence in Alexandretta, the Franco-Turkish talks were to end in June 1939 with the Turks being given total control over the disputed region.

By early 1939, it was clear that the days of the Spanish Republic were numbered, and Bonnet felt that it was time for France to recognise the Spanish Nationalists as the legitimate government of Spain (Paris had recognised the Republican government as the legitimate government). On 20 January 1939, Bonnet had a meeting with the former president of Mexico, Francisco León de la Barra, who was living in exile in Paris, and asked him to serve as an unofficial French diplomat in talks with the Spanish Nationalists. In response to reports from de la Barra that ties between General Francisco Franco and the Axis powers were strained, Bonnet then sent out Senator Léon Bérard to sound out the Nationalists about establishing diplomatic relations.

Bonnet told Bérard to inform General Francisco Gómez-Jordana Sousa, the Nationalist Foreign Minister, that if Franco was willing to promise that all German and Italian forces were to be withdrawn after the end of the Spanish Civil War, Paris would recognise the Nationalists. The major disputes during the talks between Bérard and Jourdana were if the recognition of the Burgos government would be &quot;de jure&quot;, as Franco wanted, or &quot;de facto&quot;, as Bonnet wanted, and if Franco would promise to remain neutral in a Franco-German war. However. by February 1939, Bonnet believed that the rapid collapse of the Republican war effort made recognition of the Burgos government imperative if France had any hope of having influence with Franco, and on 28 February 1939, France had broken diplomatic relations with the Republican government in Madrid and recognised the Nationalist government in Burgos. Much to the relief of Bonnet, Franco kept his word about ensuring the withdrawal of Axis forces from Spanish territory, especially the departure of the Italians from the Balearic Islands.

In early 1939, the British Embassy in Paris was bombarded with a series of reports that public opinion in France was highly dejected and demoralised and that unless Britain made the &quot;continental commitment&quot; of unequivocally linking British security to French security and committing to sending a large British Expeditionary Force to France like the one that had ultimately been sent during the First World War, the French would resign themselves to becoming a German satellite state. Theose reports, which had secretly originated with the French government, hoped to pressure the British into making the long-sought &quot;continental commitment&quot;. The French were assisted in a conspiracy of convenience by the leadership of the British Army, which disliked the funding implications of Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;limited liability&quot; doctrine that held that during the next war, British efforts were to be largely limited to the sea and the air, with the army playing an ancillary role at best.

On 24 January 1939, Bonnet informed Welczeck that a speech that he was going to make before the Chamber of Deputies to affirm France&#x27;s willingness to stand by its alliances in Eastern Europe &quot;had been framed for domestic consumption&quot;. Bonnet read out to Welczeck several excerpts from the speech he was going to give and asked the ambassador to tell Ribbentrop not to take his speech literally. Despite Bonnet&#x27;s efforts via Welczeck, Ribbentrop was enraged when he read the excerpts and ordered Welczeck to express Germany&#x27;s &quot;astonishment&quot; that Bonnet had spoken of &quot;fostering and extending French friendships in eastern and central Europe&quot;.

On 11 February 1939, Welczeck met with Bonnet. The French and German records of the meeting contradict each other. In the French version of the meeting, Bonnet defended the speech he gave before the Chamber of Deputies on 26 January 1939 while the German version of the meeting Bonnet apologized for the speech, saying that it did not reflect his views on foreign policy at all. Welczeck had Bonnet saying to him: &quot;Things were often said during a foreign affairs debate, which were obviously designed for domestic consumption... If a French foreign minister, against the storm and wave of opposition, substantiated our claims to the Sudeten German territory... and then drew his own conclusions privately from the changed situation in Central Europe, he could not be expected to withdraw all along the line when facing the Chamber.&quot;

The French effort for a British &quot;continental commitment&quot; was given a huge and unexpected boost by the &quot;Dutch war scare&quot; of January 1939. In response to the &quot;Dutch war scare&quot;, which gripped London in late January 1939 when the British government received false reports of an imminent German invasion of the Netherlands, Lord Halifax had Phipps inquire what France would do if such an invasion took place. The Germans were then believed to have planned to overrun the Netherlands and to use Dutch airfields to launch a bombing campaign that would be meant to achieve a knockout blow against Britain and to raze British cities to the ground. The French attitude towards a German invasion of the Netherlands was crucial because France was the only country in Western Europe that possessed an army large enough and modern enough to save the Dutch.

Moreover, the importance of France to British security had increased after a violent anti-British propaganda campaign launched in Germany in November 1938, which had led the Chamberlain government to perceive German foreign policy as anti-British. That scare was combined with rumours that Bonnet was secretly attempting to negotiate a Franco-German &quot;special relationship&quot;, which might leave Britain facing a hostile Germany without any allies with the large armies that Britain lacked. In response to Phipps&#x27;s message, Bonnet had Corbin inform Lord Halifax that the French attitude towards German aggression towards the Netherlands would depend upon the British attitude towards France if the latter were the victim of aggression. Chamberlain stated to the House of Commons on 6 February 1939 that any German attack on France would automatically be considered an attack on Britain, which led the British to make the &quot;continental commitment&quot; to send a large army to defend France that successive French diplomats had struggled to obtain since 1919. In a newspaper column on 11 March 1939, Pertinax wrote that Bonnet ruled his ministry in an autocratic style. As he wrote: &quot;In theory, foreign policy is conducted by the entire cabinet, the ministers being collectively responsible for their actions. In reality, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is absolute master of his department&quot;.

In March 1939, after the German destruction of the rump state of Czecho-Slovakia and the proclamation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Bonnet had Hervé Alphand of the Ministry of Commerce, who was in Berlin to negotiate a trade treaty, recalled in protest. The violation of the Munich Agreement badly damaged Bonnet&#x27;s creditability, and as part of the aftermath, 17 French intellectuals sent out a letter that called for an inquiry into Bonnet&#x27;s conduct of foreign affairs. Ties between Daladier and Bonnet were strained when in protest over the German coup, Daladier ordered the recall of Robert Coulondre, the French Ambassador to Germany, without consulting Bonnet, who was much offended by Daladier&#x27;s act. Welczeck reported that Bonnet had told him that he had no official opinion about the occupation, but his &quot;personal view&quot; was that &quot;the peace and appeasement policy of the &#x27;men of Munich&#x27; had suffered a lamentable disaster... in every country warmongers who would lead Europe toward catastrophe were bound to gain the upper hand&quot;.

===Danzig crisis and &quot;peace front&quot;===
During the Tilea Affair of March 1939 in which the Romanian government, as part of an effort to enlist British support against German demands for the control of the Romanian oil industry, had the Romanian Minister in London, Viorel Tilea, make a series of highly-misleading statements to the British government to the effect that it was on the verge of an immediate German invasion, Bonnet happened to be in London as part of the company that was accompanying the state visit of President Albert Lebrun. The importance of Romania was that Germany possessed no oil of its own and was highly dependent on oil from the New World (the coal liquefaction plants that would supply Germany with oil during World War II were not yet in operation). As such, a naval blockade of Germany would have highly damaging effects on the German economy, and conversely, a German seizure of Romania would undermine the effectiveness of a blockade. When the war scare began on 18 March 1939, Bonnet&#x27;s first response was to inform the Romanians that they should accept aid from the Soviet Union, as there was nothing France could do to save them. The Romanians rejected the French advice, and Jakob Suritz, the Soviet Ambassador to France, stated the Soviet Union would take no initiatives in resisting German aggression in Eastern Europe, and France must show the way.
During an emergency meeting with Halifax on 20 March, Bonnet sought to shift responsibility to dealing with the crisis onto British shoulders and strongly suggested that the ideal country to save Romania and its oil was Poland. Bonnet argued that Britain should take the lead in persuading the Poles to come to Romania&#x27;s aid and suggested that if Poland was involved, perhaps the Romanians might be persuaded to accept Soviet aid as well. Bonnet&#x27;s reasons for arguing that Britain should take the lead in persuading Poland to come to Romania&#x27;s aid were his fear that if France made such an effort, the price of Polish support would a tightening of the Franco-Polish alliance, which was against Bonnet&#x27;s general policy of seeking to weaken France&#x27;s eastern alliances.

On 23 March 1939, Lebrun was having lunch with the royal family at Windsor Castle when Bonnet had another meeting with Lord Halifax and mentioned that he had received a series of messages from François-Poncet. Bonnet claimed that it would create a highly-negative impression on Mussolini and would hamper efforts to detach him from his alignment with Germany if Britain and France aligned themselves with only the Soviet Union. Bonnet&#x27;s statement was to lead the British government into considering the idea of making a &quot;guarantee&quot; of Polish independence as the best way of securing Polish support for Romania. In that way, Bonnet played a major if indirect role in the progress leading to the British &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland on 31 March 1939. On 30 March, Phipps told Bonnet that Chamberlain would be announcing the &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland the next day and asked for Bonnet&#x27;s approval, which was granted without Bonnet informing the rest of the French cabinet.

Daladier was enraged with Bonnet for giving his approval of the &quot;guarantee&quot;, as he remarked to the French cabinet the next day: &quot;the guarantee goes a long way, indeed further than our own alliance, because the decision to engage Britain&#x27;s entire military strength will rest in Warsaw&quot;. With the British &quot;guarantee&quot;, Daladier had lost leverage over Colonel Beck, who now had two great power allies, instead of one, and it soon dawned on Daladier that Bonnet had approved of the British &quot;guarantee&quot; as a way to sabotage Daladier&#x27;s policy of restructuring the Franco-Polish alliance to confront the &quot;Reich&quot;. General Gamelin, likewise, complained that Chamberlain should have forced Beck to grant transit rights to the Red Army as a precondition of the &quot;guarantee&quot;, instead of giving the &quot;guarantee&quot; unconditionally, which meant that both Britain and France had lost leverage over Colonel Beck. After the British &quot;guarantee&quot; of Polish independence on 31 March 1939, followed by the announcements that London wished to build a &quot;peace front&quot; to resist aggression in April 1939, Bonnet felt there was now a great opportunity of building an Anglo-French-Soviet combination, which might deter Germany from war.

On 14 April 1939, Bonnet had a meeting with Suritz and asked &quot;in a form to be determined&quot; for the Soviet Union to provide military support for Poland and Romania if they were attacked by Germany. Bonnet suggested to Surittz that an annex to the Franco-Soviet Pact of 1935 should be added to declare the Soviets would go to war if Germany attacked either Poland or Romania. In particular, Bonnet stated: &quot;It was obvious that there had to be an agreement between the USSR and Romania or the USSR and Poland for the Franco-Soviet Pact to come usefully into play&quot;. Suritz commented that unless the Poles and Romanians allowed the Red Army transit rights, there was little that the Soviets could do for those nations, which led Bonnet to reply that he felt that he could pressure both nations into agreeing to provide the desired transit rights. Bonnet commented that he felt that it was time to &quot;begin immediate discussions between France and the USSR in order to precisely determine the help the USSR could provide to Romania and Poland in the event of German aggression&quot;.

In April 1939, Bonnet in turn went behind Daladier&#x27;s back in suggesting that Britain apply pressure on Daladier to make more concessions to Italy on the Franco-Italian disputes over influence in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea regions. The differences between Daladier and Bonnet over the question of making concessions to Italy, which Daladier firmly opposed, led Daladier increasingly to take control of foreign policy by dealing directly with the Quai d&#x27;Orsay&#x27;s Secretary-General, Alexis Saint-Legér Léger, and pushing Bonnet aside from April 1939 onwards. On 27 April 1939, Phipps told Bonnet that the Chamberlain government had hopes that &quot;a serious attempt would be made to reestablish contact between France and Italy&quot;. St. Legér was utterly opposed to Bonnet&#x27;s policy of making concessions to Italy and had the support of Daladier, who felt that France should not have to make concessions to Mussolini. Later in April 1939, Daladier told Romanian Foreign Minister Grigore Gafencu that &quot;he was going to get rid of Bonnet quite shortly&quot;. On 6 May, Daladier stated to Bullit that he had a great deal of &quot;mistrust of Bonnet and said that he might replace him in the immediate future&quot;. As Welczeck noted in May 1939: &quot;Bonnet was... a man who would go to the utmost limits to avoid a European war up to the last moment. He regretted therefore that foreign affairs were so much more in the hands of M. Daladier than M. Bonnet&quot;.

On 14 May 1939, the French &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; at the consulate in Singapore warned Bonnet that France&#x27;s only hope of preventing the Imperial Japanese Navy from dominating the South China Sea was the Royal Navy, as the bulk of the French fleet was concentrated in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Admiral François Darlan, the commander-in-chief of the French Navy, had already declared that his force&#x27;s primary mission was in the Mediterranean and that the South China Sea was only a secondary concern. The report warned that in the event of the Danzig crisis turning into a war, the Japanese would probably seek to dominate the South China Sea as a prelude towards the invasions of French Indochina and British Malaya, both of which were well provided with rubber plantations. Despite the report&#x27;s recommendation that closer co-operation with Britain was the best way to protect French Indochina, Bonnet remained committed to the appeasement of Japan.

On 19 May 1939, Bonnet met with Welczeck, who told him that the &quot;Reich&quot; did not want a war against France and attacked Britain for an alleged &quot;encirclement&quot; policy against Germany. Welczeck went on to say that France would have to bear &quot;the main burden of the struggle conjured up by Britain and make enormous sacrifice of life&quot;, as he claimed that France was being used by Britain. It was after that statement that the French and the German versions of the meeting diverged. The French version had Bonnet saying that France could not accept the use of force by Germany to resolve the Danzig crisis. The German version had Bonnet saying to Welczeck: &quot;he [Bonnet] would never deviate from the main lines of his policy and would fight for peace to the very last. In spite of everything he held fast to the idea of bringing back co-operation with Germany... If I met unfriendliness in the French press where he had some influence, he would remedy matters, as far as lay his power&quot;. During the Danzig crisis, Bonnet found himself opposed by almost all of the officials of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, led by St. Léger, who accused him of wanting to end the alliance with Poland. Morale was high in the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, as one French diplomat, Jean Chauvel, recalled in 1971: &quot;But finally and most important was their conviction that Hitler could not fight a war&quot;. Chauvel stated that he and the other officials worked to sabotage Bonnet&#x27;s policies and wrote: &quot;Their practical purpose was to resist the minister&#x27;s policies and if necessary, thwart any action on his part&quot;.

In contrast to his enthusiasm for improving ties with Moscow as the Danzig crisis began, Bonnet felt the opposite about relations with Warsaw. In May 1939, during talks in Paris with the Poles aimed at strengthening the political and military aspects of the Franco-Polish alliance, Bonnet sabotaged the negotiations by bogging down the talks on the political accord on procedural details to ensure that no political accord was signed, which were the precondition for the military accords. (Not until 3 September 1939 would the political accord finally be signed). Bonnet&#x27;s sought to block the signing of the Franco-Polish political accord as a way of applying pressure on the Poles to grant the Soviets transit rights, because if the negotiations for the &quot;grand alliance&quot; failed, he did not wish to see France any more committed to Poland&#x27;s defence.

During the ultimately-failed talks for an Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance in the spring and summer of 1939, Bonnet and the rest of the French leadership pressed quite strongly for the revived Triple Entente, often to the considerable discomfort of the British. In the spring and the summer of 1939, Bonnet very strongly believed that a &quot;grand alliance&quot; of the Soviet Union, Britain and France would deter Germany from attacking Poland. At a meeting with Lord Halifax on 20–21 May 1939 while he was returning from Geneva, Daladier, Bonnet and Saint-Léger pressured Halifax repeatedly for a &quot;grand alliance&quot; as the only way of stopping another world war. In the spring of 1939, Bonnet went so far as to inform Moscow that he supported turning over all of eastern Poland to the Soviet Union, regardless of what the Poles felt about the issue, if that was to be the price of the Soviet alliance. On 2 June 1939, when the Soviet government offered up its definition of what constituted &quot;aggression&quot; upon which the intended alliance was to come into play, Bonnet sided with the Soviets against the British, who felt that the Soviet definition of &quot;aggression&quot;, especially &quot;indirect aggression&quot;, was too loose a definition and was phrased in such a manner as to imply the Soviet right of inference in the internal affairs of nations of Eastern Europe.

On 24 June 1939, Coulondre visited Paris to meet Bonnet. Coulondre complained that Bonnet&#x27;s equivocal statements to Count Johannes von Welczeck about what France would do if Germany invaded Poland had convinced Ribbentrop that France would do nothing. Coulondre advised Bonnet to make an unequivocal statement to Welczeck that France would stand by its alliance with Poland if Germany invaded, which Bonnet ignored. In June 1939, a long war of words between Bonnet and Ribbentrop began in the summer of 1939 over just what precisely Bonnet actually said to Ribbentrop, who issued a statement to the French media stating that Bonnet had told him on 6 December 1938 that he recognised Eastern Europe as being the exclusive sphere of influence for the &quot;Reich&quot;. Adamthwaite wrote that all of the evidence supports Ribbentrop&#x27;s version of events. Later in June 1939, Bonnet&#x27;s reputation was badly damaged when the French agent of the &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot;, Otto Abetz, was expelled from France for engaging in espionage, French newspaper editors were charged with receiving bribes from Abetz and the name of Bonnet&#x27;s wife was prominently mentioned in connection with the Abetz case as a close friend of the two editors; but despite much lurid speculation in the French press at the time, there was no conclusive evidence linking Bonnet or his wife to German espionage or bribery. As Bonnet continued to ignore Coulondre&#x27;s advice on making a firm statement to Welczeck, Coulondre appealed directly to Daladier in a phone call. Daladier, in turn, ordered Bonnet to make such a statement to Welczeck. On 1 July 1939, Bonnet told Welczeck that Germany should not try to unilaterally change the status of Danzig and that France would honour its alliance with Poland.

On 1 July 1939, in response to a message from Soviet Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov about the nations that the intended &quot;grand alliance&quot; was meant to protect, Bonnet sent a telegraph in reply to state that the purpose of the &quot;grand alliance&quot; was &quot;the mutual solidarity of the three great powers... in those conditions the number of countries guaranteed is unimportant&quot;. Besides working for the &quot;peace front&quot; with Britain and the Soviet Union, Bonnet tried to enlist Turkey in the &quot;peace front&quot; in July 1939 by arranging for the French and the British treasuries to provide financial support to Ankara. By early July 1939, Bonnet grew increasingly irritated over what he regarded as British foot-dragging in the talks with the Soviets and the Polish refusal to grant transit rights to the Red Army. Bonnet wrote to Halifax at the time, &quot;We are reaching a critical moment, where we find it necessary to do everything possible to succeed&quot;. As part of his effort to save the talks, Bonnet wrote up and presented to both London and Moscow the text of a joint communiqué, stating to the world their determination to resist aggression and that they &quot;agreed on the main points of the political agreement&quot;. Bonnet&#x27;s effort was blocked by Molotov, who stated that his government had no interest in issuing such a communiqué.

On 18 July 1939, Bonnet had a discussion with Daladier in which he stated that he felt that Hitler was serious about going to war with Poland, and Bonnet believed that the best solution would be for France to pressure Poland into allowing the Free City to &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; as the necessary price of peace. Bonnet also recommended having France pressure Poland into returning the Polish Corridor and Upper Silesia, neither of which Hitler had yet demanded. Bonnet&#x27;s preferred solution to the Danzig crisis was an international conference, and he stated that had a long conversation with Sir Nevile Henderson, the British ambassador in Berlin, during his visit to Paris. Bonnet presented Henderson&#x27;s views in a manner that implied that Henderson was speaking for London. Daladier very much opposed Bonnet&#x27;s recommendations and stated that St. Léger had informed him that he was convinced that the Anglo-French-Soviet &quot;peace front&quot; would soon come into existence, which would deter Germany from war. Daladier expressed the view that Hitler was bluffing in his threats and would not choose war if he was confronted with overwhelming force. Bonnet was not as quite sanguine as Daladier was about the &quot;peace front&quot;, as he noted the issue of transit rights for the Red Army across Poland still had to be resolved, but he agreed that the &quot;peace front&quot; was the best way of deterring Hitler from war.

In August 1939, Bonnet took up a Turkish effort of mediation between the British and the Soviets as part of an attempt to break the deadlock. On 2 August 1939, Bonnet told Phipps that his main opponents in the cabinet were Daladier, along with Paul Reynaud, the minister of finance; César Campinchi, the minister of the marine; Albert Sarraut, the minister of the interior; and Georges Mandel, the minister of colonies. Bonnet further maintained that his enemies within the Quai d&#x27;Orsay were St. Léger, along with his friends, Coulondre and Corbin.

When the Anglo-Franco-Soviet talks were on the verge of breaking down in August 1939 over the issue of transit rights for the Red Army in Poland, Bonnet instructed the French Embassy in Moscow to inform the Kremlin falsely that the Poles had granted the desired transit rights, as part of a desperate bid to rescue the alliance talks with the Soviets. At the same time, immense French diplomatic pressure was applied in Warsaw for the Poles to agree to the transit rights for the Red Army, but Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck was very firm in refusing to consider such an idea. On 19 August 1939, Beck stated in a message to Paris: &quot;We have not got a military agreement with the USSR. We do not want to have one&quot;. The conclusion of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939 left Bonnet highly dejected, as he believed the prospect of Soviet economic support for Germany would undermine the effectiveness of a British naval blockade of Germany, which was widely assumed in France to be a prerequisite of defeating Germany, and he returned to advocating renouncing the Polish alliance as the best way of avoiding war for France.

After the Non-Aggression Pact, Bonnet urged Daladier that the French should inform the Poles that they should give the Free City of Danzig to Germany, and if the Poles refused, the French should use that as an excuse to renounce the alliance with Poland. At a cabinet meeting on 22 August 1939, Bonnet spoke against French mobilisation and argued that France should seek to find a way to end the alliance with Poland. Bonnet supported by St. Léger-Léger and Daladier argued for making one more attempt to win the Soviet alliance. Reynaud and Mandel both spoke for French mobilisation, which Bonnet argued against and stated would increase Polish &quot;intransigence&quot;. Bonnet&#x27;s comment about French mobilization was &quot;I do not ask for this&quot;.

At a meeting of the Standing Committee on National Defense, which comprised the Premier, the Ministers of War, the Navy, the Air and Foreign Affairs, and all of the top French military officials on 23 August 1939, Bonnet sought to pressure General Maurice Gamelin into stating that France could not go to war in 1939, as Bonnet maintained that France should find a way of renouncing the 1921 alliance with Poland. Bonnet argued that as Poland could be saved only by Soviet support, it was no longer possible for France to risk war because of the Non-Aggression Pact. Bonnet further asserted that oil-rich Romania, hemmed in by Germany and the Soviet Union, would now lean towards the totalitarian states and that the Soviets would not allow Turkey, which had been leaning in a pro-Allied direction, to enter the war if Germany attacked a state in the Balkans. At that meeting, Bonnet&#x27;s arguments for abandoning Poland were countered by Gamelin, who argued that if war came, there was little France could do for the Poles, who Gamelin felt could hold out for about three months, but abandoning Poland would be equivalent to abandoning great power status for France. As Bonnet continued his efforts against going to war for Poland, Daladier increasingly came to feel that appointing Bonnet to the Quai d&#x27;Orsay had been a mistake and was now consumed with hatred for him. Juliusz Łukasiewicz, the Polish Ambassador to France, accused Bonnet of &quot;preparing a new Munich behind our backs&quot;. On 25 August 1939, Daladier told Łukasiewicz that he should avoid speaking to Bonnet under all conditions and maintained that the views of the Foreign Minister regarding the Danzig crisis were not his own, and he advised Łukasiewicz to speak only to himself or St. Léger. On the evening of 27 August 1939, Coulondre wrote a letter to Daladier declaring: &quot;One must hold firm, Hitler faced with force is a man who will climb down&quot;.

On the evening of 31 August 1939, at a meeting of the French cabinet, Bonnet was the leading spokesman for the idea of using the peace mediation proposals of Benito Mussolini as a pretext for ending the alliance with Poland. Before the cabinet meeting opened, Bonnet together his close ally, Public Works Minister Anatole de Monzie, sought to pressure some of the most hesitant hawks in the Cabinet such as Charles Pomaret, Henri Queuille and Jean Zay into endorsing Mussolini&#x27;s offer. Zay was clearly torn, as he stated that he hated the idea of another world war, and he stated he was willing to support Mussolini&#x27;s conference if it was &quot;not a new Munich&quot;. As the cabinet meeting opened, Daladier quite consciously turned his back on Bonnet and refused to speak to him as a way of showing he was against the &quot;munichois&quot; faction in the cabinet, headed by Bonnet.

One who was present wrote that Daladier &quot;bristled like a hedgehog. He turned his back on Bonnet from the first minute. His expression was one of contemptuous disgust&quot;. At that cabinet meeting, Bonnet stated that France should accept the Italian offer and reject the British precondition for acceptance, the demobilisation of the German Army. Daladier had been well briefed by St. Léger to rebut Bonnet. Daladier read out to the cabinet Coulondre&#x27;s letter, which he had received two days earlier, and then said, &quot;The trial of strength turns to our advantage. It is only necessary to hold, hold, hold!&quot; St. Léger had kept Coulondre&#x27;s letter a secret from Bonnet but passed it on to Daladier.

Bonnet was taken by surprise by Coulondre&#x27;s letter and was left fuming in rage, as Coulondre&#x27;s letter won over the cabinet. Daladier, strongly supported by Gamelin, argued that Mussolini&#x27;s proposed peace conference was a trick to prevent France from declaring war on Germany, and France should not send a delegation to attend it. Despite the cabinet meeting, Bonnet ordered François-Poncet to tell Count Ciano that France would attend the conference. Likewise, Bonnet told Phipps that he would attend Mussolini&#x27;s conference, and at 10:15 a.m. on the morning of 1 September 1939, Halifax received a dispatch stating that France was going to attend the conference to stop a war that had already broken out earlier that morning.

=== Final days of peace===
When Bonnet first learned of the German attack on Poland at 8:20 a.m., on 1 September 1939, his first reaction was to contact the Italian Ambassador to France, Baron Raffaele Guariglia, and informed him that France had accepted Mussolini&#x27;s mediation offer. Guariglia received a phone call from his French cousin, the Comte de Ronceray, who, in turn, had been briefed by de Monzie. The Comte de Ronceray dismissed the German invasion of Poland as an unfortunate &quot;contretemps&quot; but told Guariglia that Bonnet had lied that Bonnet had won over the cabinet into accepting Mussolini&#x27;s conference. At 10 am, Guariglia met Bonnet at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay and was told by Bonnet that France had accepted the Italian plan for a conference. Present in Bonnet&#x27;s office were his allies François Piétri; Henri Béranger, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee; Jean Mistler, the chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee; and Air Minister Guy la Chambre. Bonnet then ordered François-Poncet to see Mussolini about when the peace conference could begin. Bonnet argued very strongly in the cabinet against a French declaration of war and instead urged that the French take up Mussolini&#x27;s mediation offer. If the Poles refused to attend Mussolini&#x27;s conference, which was widely expected since Mussolini&#x27;s revised peace plan on 1 September called for an armistice, not for the removal of German troops from Poland, the major Polish precondition to accepting the Italian plan, the French should denounce the Polish alliance.

The French cabinet met later that morning to vote to order French mobilization at once and called upon a special session of the National Assembly to vote for a request for 75 billion francs in war credits. Bonnet continued to argue for attending Mussolini&#x27;s conference. Later,that day, Bonnet ordered the Ambassador in London, Charles Corbin, to tell the British that Mussolini&#x27;s peace offers had been accepted by France. Corbin, in turn, reported that now that war had begun, the British were starting to lose interest in the Italian mediation offer. Likewise, the Ambassador in Warsaw Léon Noël was instructed to see if the Poles would agree to attending Mussolini&#x27;s proposed conference, only to receive an angry reply from Beck about when France proposed to honour the Franco-Polish alliance by declaring war on Germany. Strong British pressure for a warning to be delivered in Berlin made Bonnet reluctantly order Ambassador Robert Coulondre late on the afternoon of 1 September to warn Ribbentrop that if Germany continued with its aggression, France would declare war on Germany. At midnight on 1 September, Bonnet had Havas issue a statement: &quot;The French government has today, as have several other Governments, received an Italian proposal looking to the resolution of Europe&#x27;s difficulties. After due consideration the French government has given a &#x27;positive response&#x27;&quot;.

On the morning of 2 September, an angry scene occurred at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay when Polish Ambassador Juliusz Łukasiewicz marched in unannounced and during a stormy interview with Bonnet demanded to know why France had not yet declared war. Later that day, Bonnet, during a phone conversation with Count Ciano, made a great point of insisting that the French &quot;démarche&quot; of 1 September was not an ultimatum, as he urged that the Italians start the peace conference as soon as possible. Bonnet was serious about the conference, but the proposed conference was aborted when Halifax stated that unless the Germans withdrew from Poland immediately, Britain would not attend.

During a phone call to Halifax later on 2 September, Bonnet could not persuade Halifax to drop the precondition about a German withdrawal. At about 5:00 p.m., Bonnet had another tempestuous interview with Łukasiewicz, who pressed him very strongly for a French declaration of war and accused Bonnet of plotting to betray Poland by keeping France neutral. As part of an effort to gain British acceptance of the Italian plan, Bonnet sought to see if it was possible for the Germans to stage a &quot;symbolic withdrawal&quot; from Poland, only to learn from Lord Halifax that a &quot;symbolic withdrawal&quot; was unacceptable and from Ribbentrop that no withdrawal, symbolic or otherwise, was being considered in Berlin.

Corbin sought to sabotage Bonnet&#x27;s policy by advising Chamberlain that he should speak only to Daladier. Bonnet, together with his allies in the &quot;peace lobby&quot; both in and out of the government like Anatole de Monzie, Jean Mistler, Marcel Déat, Paul Faure, Paul Baudoin, Pierre Laval, René Belin, Adrien Marquet, and Gaston Bergery, spent 1 to 3 September lobbying the Daladier government, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against going to war with Germany. Bonnet told Daladier the lie that that Count Ciano had persuaded the Germans to accept an armistice as part of the peace plan, but in fact, Ciano had told Bonnet the precise opposite.

There was a moment that Bonnet believed that he could use the Italian conference as an excuse for renouncing the alliance with Poland and keeping France out of the war. However, Daladier continued to insist that the &quot;Reich&quot; had to cease its war against Poland and pull out all of its forces from Poland, and he lost interest when he learned the peace plan did not include those demands. The cabinet decided for war on 2 September but agreed for an extra 24 hours, as Gamelin insisted that France needed more time to mobilise millions of men to the colours without fear of Luftwaffe attacks. At 10:30 pm.. on 2 September 1939, Lord Halifax, in a phone call to Bonnet, told him that Britain would declare war on Germany the next day and abandoned interest in a planned simultaneous presentations of declarations of war.

On 3 September 1939, Britain declared war on Germany, which had the effect of resolving the debate in Paris, and Daladier finally had the French declaration of war issued later that same day. For a week after the war was declared, Daladier avoided having the cabinet meet to ensure that Bonnet would not have a chance to put forward his views about seeking peace with Germany. Bonnet was demoted to minister of justice on 13 September.

==Later career==
In the latter half of March 1940, Bonnet together with his &quot;peace lobby&quot; allies such as Anatole de Monzie, Pierre-Étienne Flandin, Pierre Laval, Jean Montigny, Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, Georges Scapini, René Dommanage, Gaston Bergery, René Chateau, and René Brunet, made a major lobbying effort to have Laval appointed foreign minister as a prelude to making peace with Germany. Besides chairing meetings of the &quot;peace lobby&quot;, which met six times during the Phoney War, Bonnet otherwise remained silent as Justice Minister. On 21 June 1940, Bonnet, together with Laval, helped to pressure President Albert Lebrun to change his mind about leaving for Algeria.

On 10 July 1940, Bonnet voted in favour of granting the cabinet presided by Marshal Philippe Pétain authority to draw up a new constitution, thereby effectively ending the French Third Republic and establishing Vichy France. He supported the Vichy government and served on its National Council from December 1940. As the council never met, his role in Vichy was small. Bonnet spent most of World War II living on his estate in the Dordogne and attempting to secure himself an office in Vichy, but Bonnet was later to claim to have been involved in the French Resistance. According to Gestapo records, Bonnet contacted the Germans once in February 1941 to see if the Germans would pressure Laval to include him in the Cabinet and again in June 1943 to reassure them that he had no intention of leaving France to join the Allies. In November 1942, Bonnet agreed to testify for the prosecution at the planned trial of Herschel Grynszpan. Bonnet was to testify that his efforts at reaching a rapprochement with the &quot;Reich&quot; had been sabotaged by the Jews, who were intent on starting a war with Germany, and that Grynszpan had assassinated Ernst vom Rath as part of an alleged Jewish conspiracy to push France into war with Germany. However, the trial was never held, as Gryszpan&#x27;s planned defence that he was having a homosexual relationship with Rath and had shot him as part of a lover&#x27;s quarrel meant that from the German viewpoint, the trial was too risky, as people might have believed that claim.

On 5 April 1944, Bonnet fled France for Switzerland and claimed that his life was in danger. Bonnet stayed in exile until March 1950. After the war, proceedings were begun against him but were eventually dropped although he was expelled from the Radical Party in 1944. During his time in exile, Bonnet was to write a five-volume set of memoirs. Bonnet, throughout his career, had been very much concerned with his reputation, and during his time as Foreign Minister, he had a team of journalists to engage in what is known in France as &quot;Bonnetiste&quot; writing, a series of books and pamphlets meant to glorify him as the defender of the peace and Europe&#x27;s savior. After leaving the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, Bonnet took with him a large number of official papers, which he then used to support the claims made in his voluminous memoirs in which Bonnet depicted himself as waging a single-handed heroic battle to save the peace. Many have charged Bonnet with &quot;editing&quot; his papers to present himself in the best possible light, regardless of the facts. In particular, criticism has centered on some of the contradictory claims in the Bonnet memoirs. At various points, Bonnet claimed that British pressure had driven France towards Munich in 1938 and that his government wanted to fight for Czechoslovakia. At other times, Bonnet states the military and economic situation in 1938 was such that France could not risk a war in 1939.

In the early 1950s, Bonnet had an intense debate on the pages of the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; with one of his leading critics, the British historian Sir Lewis Namier over some of the claims contained in his memoirs. At issue was whether Bonnet had, as Namier charged, snubbed an offer by Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Józef Beck in May 1938 to have Poland come to the aid of Czechoslovakia in the event of a German attack. Bonnet denied that such an offer had been made, which led Namier to accuse Bonnet of seeking to falsify the documentary record. Namier established that Bonnet had been less than honest in his account, and he concluded the debate in 1953 with these words: &quot;The Polish offer, for what it was worth, was first torpedoed by Bonnet the statesman, and next obliterated by Bonnet the historian&quot;. The real significance of the debate was over Bonnet&#x27;s freedom of manoeuvre. In his memoirs, Bonnet claimed that he had been often forced by circumstances beyond his control to carry out a foreign policy that he opposed. Namier charged that Bonnet had other options and was carrying out the same foreign policy that he had wanted to carry out.

Readmitted to the Radicals in 1952, in 1953 Bonnet was allowed to run for office again. He was once again expelled in 1955 for refusing to support Pierre Mendès France. Nevertheless, he was once again elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1956 for his old seat in the Dordogne and continued to serve in that body until he lost his seat in 1968.

<text>Michel Jean Barnier (; born 9 January 1951) is a French politician who served as Prime Minister of France from September to December 2024. A member of a series of Gaullist parties (UDR, RPR, UMP, LR), Barnier has served in several French cabinet positions under the governments from Édouard Balladur to François Fillon from 1993 to 2009. At the European Union (EU) level, Barnier was European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services from 2010 to 2014 and vice-president of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) from 2010 to 2015. From October 2016 to 2021, he was the EU&#x27;s chief negotiator on Britain&#x27;s exit from the European Union.

In August 2021, Barnier sought his party&#x27;s nomination for President of France in the 2022 presidential election, but obtained third place at the 2021 The Republicans congress. In September 2024 President Emmanuel Macron appointed him to the premiership following the 2024 snap legislative election. 

At the age of 73, Barnier is the oldest person to take office as prime minister under the Fifth Republic. On 4 December 2024, three months into his tenure, his government was brought down by a vote of no confidence in Parliament. The following day, Barnier and his government resigned. Barnier was succeeded on 13 December by François Bayrou. His tenure as Prime minister is the shortest so far under the Fifth Republic.

Barnier is a pro-European, Gaullist conservative. He has advocated for stricter controls on extra-European immigration, expanding prison capacity and the introduction of mandatory minimum sentences for certain crimes.

== Early life and education ==
Michel Jean Barnier was born at La Tronche in the French Alps, into a Gaullist family in 1951. His father, Jean Barnier, was a leather and textiles craftsman. His mother, Denise Durand, was a practising member of the Christian left, who founded a local chapter of the &quot;&quot; (League against road violence). Barnier is the youngest of the couple&#x27;s three sons.

In his youth, Barnier was a scout and choirboy. He graduated from the École Supérieure de Commerce de Paris (ESCP) in 1972. During his studies at the ESCP, he was a classmate of Jean-Pierre Raffarin, future prime minister, and a member of the Conférence Olivaint, a student organisation intended to prepare members for political life.

== Political career ==
=== National politics ===
Barnier served on the staff of various Gaullist ministers in the 1970s, before being elected in 1978, aged 27, to the National Assembly as deputy for the department of Savoie representing the neo-Gaullists, Rally for the Republic (RPR), serving until 1993. In the 1980s, he voted for the abolition of capital punishment and against reducing the age of consent for same-sex relationships to that of mixed-sex couples.

Barnier became the youngest president of the departmental council of Savoie in 1982, following a deal called the between right-wing and centrist parties in the council. In 1992, he co-organised the Winter Olympics in Albertville.

Barnier first joined the Cabinet as Minister of the Environment following the right&#x27;s landslide victory in the 1993 legislative election. In 1995, Jacques Chirac appointed him Minister for European Affairs, a role in which he served until the defeat of the presidential majority in the 1997 legislative election. Barnier then served as a European Commissioner for Regional Policy in the Prodi Commission from 1999 until 2004. He subsequently served as Foreign Minister in Jean-Pierre Raffarin&#x27;s government until June 2005 when Dominique de Villepin replaced him with Philippe Douste-Blazy. From 2006 until 2015, Barnier was vice-president of the European People&#x27;s Party. In 2007, under Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s presidency, he re-joined the Cabinet as Minister of Agriculture.

In 2016, the investigating judge Sabine Kheris requested that the case of Barnier, Dominique de Villepin and Michèle Alliot-Marie be referred to the Court of Justice of the Republic. The former ministers were suspected of having allowed the exfiltration of the mercenaries responsible for the attack on the Bouaké penal camp during the 2004 Ivory Coast conflict, killing nine French soldiers. Supporters of the Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo accused the French government of using the attack as a pretext for military retaliation against him.

=== European politics ===

Barnier worked in 2006 as a special adviser to José Manuel Barroso, then President of the European Commission, and presented a report to the Council of Ministers proposing the creation of a European civil-protection force. During 2006–2007, he served as member of the Amato Group, a group of high-level European politicians unofficially working on rewriting the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe into what became known as the Treaty of Lisbon following its rejection by French and Dutch voters.

Barnier led the UMP list in Ile-de-France for the 2009 European Parliament election. In February 2010 he was confirmed as European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services. In charge of European banking system reform, he argued for a &quot;coherent single market with intelligent rules that apply everywhere&quot;. As European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, Barnier handled many important issues, such as the reform of the financial sector (40 pieces of legislation between 2010 and 2014), the banking union (starting with European Banking Supervision) and the digital single market.

Barnier stood unsuccessfully for the nomination of the European People&#x27;s Party to become President of the European Commission in March 2014, losing to Jean-Claude Juncker. He was twice appointed Acting Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship in Antonio Tajani&#x27;s stead  first from 19 April to 25 May 2014, while Tajani was on electoral campaign leave for the 2014 European Parliament elections, and secondly from 1 to 16 July 2014, after Tajani was elected and took up his seat. From 2015, Barnier served as an unpaid special adviser to Juncker on defence policy.

=== Brexit negotiator ===
On 27 July 2016, Barnier was announced as the European Commission&#x27;s chief negotiator with the United Kingdom over leaving the European Union, under of the Treaty on European Union. Commenting on the appointment, Juncker said: &quot;I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job.&quot;

From 2019 to 2021, Barnier led the European Commission&#x27;s Task Force for Relations with the United Kingdom (UK Task Force/UKTF). He was the main negotiator for the 2020 trade deal talks between the UK and EU, receiving his negotiating mandate from the European Council on 25 February 2020.

In January 2021, Barnier was appointed special adviser to President Ursula von der Leyen overseeing the ratification of the EUUK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, under new arrangements that handed responsibility for implementing the agreement to Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič.

===2022 presidential campaign===
In February 2021, Barnier set up a political faction within the Republicans under the name &quot;Patriot and European&quot; in preparation for a possible bid in the 2022 presidential election.

On 27 August 2021, Barnier launched his presidential campaign. At the party&#x27;s 2021 congress in December, he placed third in the first round of voting with 23.93% of the vote, after Éric Ciotti (on 25.59%) and Valérie Pécresse (on 25.00%); he subsequently endorsed Pécresse. Pécresse was nominated in the second round with 61% of the vote, and proceeded to place in fifth place in the first round of the presidential election, the worst result ever recorded by the Republicans or their Gaullist predecessors She endorsed Macron for the second round of the election. After his defeat, Barnier retreated from front-line politics for most of the three following years.

==Prime Minister of France==

Following gains by opposition parties in the legislative elections called by President Emmanuel Macron in the summer of 2024, the prime minister, Gabriel Attal, resigned. Macron initially refused his resignation but accepted it on 16 July. On 5 September, Barnier was appointed as prime minister by Macron. The period between Attal&#x27;s resignation and Barnier&#x27;s appointment was the longest period that the French Fifth Republic had spent under a caretaker government. Barnier is the oldest prime minister in modern French history. Dominique Moïsi, a French political scientist, described Barnier as a compromise candidate, chosen to be acceptable to parties from the centre, the right and the far right. 

Barnier&#x27;s initial challenges as Prime Minister was forming a new government, passing the vote of confidence (with a minimum of 289 out of 577 votes) and submitting the 2025 budget by 1 October to parliament according to &quot;Reuters&quot;, further remarking that it would &quot;be no easy task with the budget deficit already this year running billions of euros over target, leaving Barnier tough choices about calibrating spending cuts and tax rises&quot; and risking the government&#x27;s position in parliament. On 6 September, Barnier stated that he would continue some of Macron&#x27;s policies, including refusing to repeal the raising of the retirement age to 64. On immigration he said, &quot;There still is a feeling that our borders are sieves and that migration flows aren&#x27;t being controlled.&quot; In an interview, he remarked that the new government would include the &quot;presidential camp&quot; and &quot;maybe maybe ministers of the previous government&quot;.

Barnier was faced with a National Assembly divided nearly evenly into three blocs: the leftist New Popular Front with a plurality of seats, Macron&#x27;s centrist to centre-right Ensemble, and the far-right National Rally. Marine Le Pen, the leader of National Rally, praised Barnier as &quot;respectful of National Rally voters&quot;, but expressed caution as to his legislative agenda. The New Popular Front rejected Barnier&#x27;s appointment and called for demonstrations against Macron. Olivier Faure, the leader of the Socialist Party, accused Macron of a &quot;denial of democracy.&quot; Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the left-wing La France Insoumise, said that Macron had &quot;stolen&quot; the election by not appointing a prime minister from the New Popular Front and called for protests against the new government. According to France&#x27;s Interior Ministry, around 110,000 people took part in these protests, which were held in Paris, Montauban, Nice, Lille, Strasbourg and Montpellier, as well as in several rural areas.

On 2 December 2024, Barnier invoked article 49.3 of the French Constitution to adopt the Social Security budget for 2025 without submitting it to a parliamentary vote. The decision happened after several last-ditch concessions to find a compromise failed, prompting both the New Popular Front and the National Rally to file motions of no confidence against his government. On 4 December, a majority of deputies voted to oust Barnier&#x27;s government, which became the first to lose a motion of no-confidence since Georges Pompidou&#x27;s in 1962.

== Political positions ==
Following his appointment as prime minister in 2024, the BBC described Barnier as &quot;a committed, patriotic conservative in the tradition of ... Charles de Gaulle&quot;. In a conversation with &quot;Politico&quot; during July 2024, after the 7 July snap election, Barnier said France&#x27;s most pressing issues were immigration, the state of its public finances and rebuilding its industrial and agricultural capacities. Upon his appointment as prime minister, he listed his main priorities as education, security and immigration control.

During his 2021 presidential campaign, Barnier stated he would be in favour of proposing a referendum on whether to tighten the legal framework for immigration in France. As a candidate, he stated his intention in &quot;putting a stop to non-European immigration for three to five years,&quot; during an interview with French weekly magazine Le Point. He proposed to &quot;immediately stop regularizations, rigorously limit family reunification, reduce the reception of foreign students and the systematic execution of the double penalty&quot;. He also proposed expanding prison capacity by 20,000 and imposing mandatory minimum sentences for certain crimes.

On economic issues, Barnier has been characterised as close to the neoliberal policies of Emmanuel Macron, including the reduction of taxes and business regulation. As a presidential candidate, Barnier proposed cutting production taxes by €10 billion, raising the retirement age from 62 to 65, lengthening the working week and tightening the conditions for access to social assistance.

Barnier is regarded as pro-European, as supporting NATO, and as favouring support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. He was described as a &quot;Euro-ecstatic&quot; by François Cornut-Gentille, his supporter and colleague in the Republicans. During his presidential campaign, many media organisations commented that Barnier sounded like a Eurosceptic and Brexit supporter, contradicting previous positions he had taken on the matter.

In 1981, Barnier voted for the abolition of capital punishment, following a number of other right-wing deputies in breaking party instructions not to do so. In the same year, he was among the conservative politicians, including Jacques Chirac and François Fillon, who voted against reducing the age of consent for same-sex relationships to 15, the same as that for mixed-sex couples. He has made few statements on same-sex relations in the years since.

== Personal life ==
Barnier has been a member of the Sustainability and Legacy Commission of the International Olympic Committee, and of the board of trustees of Friends of Europe, a Brussels-based think tank. In 2021, he published &quot;My Secret Brexit Diary&quot;, a memoir of the EU&#x27;s negotiations with the UK during its withdrawal from the bloc.

In 1982, Barnier married Isabelle Altmayer, a lawyer; they have three children.

In October 2024, Barnier underwent surgery for a cervical lesion.

<text>Arthur Owen Barfield (9 November 1898 – 14 December 1997) was an English philosopher, author, poet, critic, and member of the Inklings.

==Life==
Barfield was born in London, to Elizabeth (née Shoults; 1860–1940) and Arthur Edward Barfield (1864–1938). He had three elder siblings: Diana (1891–1963), Barbara (1892–1951), and Harry (1895–1977). He was educated at Highgate School and Wadham College, Oxford and in 1920 received a first class degree in English language and literature. After finishing his B.Litt., which became his third book &quot;Poetic Diction&quot;, he was a dedicated poet and author for over ten years. After 1934 his profession was as a solicitor in London, from which he retired in 1959 aged 60. Thereafter he had many guest appointments as visiting professor in North America. Barfield published numerous essays, books, and articles. His primary focus was on what he called the &quot;evolution of consciousness,&quot; which is an idea which occurs frequently in his writings. He is best known as the author of &quot;Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry&quot; and as a founding father of Anthroposophy in the English speaking world.

==Family==
In 1923 he married the musician and choreographer Maud Douie. They adopted three children, Alexander, Lucy, and Geoffrey. Their sole grandchild is Owen A. Barfield, son of Alexander. After the death of his wife in 1980 he spent his final years in a retirement hotel in Forest Row, East Sussex.

== The Inklings ==

Barfield has been known as &quot;the first and last Inkling.&quot; He had a profound influence on C. S. Lewis and, through his books &quot;The Silver Trumpet&quot; and &quot;Poetic Diction&quot; (dedicated to Lewis), an appreciable effect on J. R. R. Tolkien, who made use of the ideas in his writings with the theme of decline and fall in Middle-earth. Tolkien embedded this into his legendarium through the device of repeated fragmentation, of the created light, of language, and of peoples especially in the sundering of the Elves. Barfield&#x27;s contribution, and their conversations, persuaded both Tolkien and Lewis that myth and metaphor have always had a central place in language and literature. &quot;The Inklings work... taken as a whole, has a significance that far outweighs any measure of popularity, amounting to a revitalisation of Christian intellectual and imaginative life.&quot;

Barfield and C. S. Lewis met in 1919 as students at Oxford University and were close friends for 44 years. &quot;It is no exaggeration to say that his friendship with Barfield was one of the most important in his [Lewis&#x27;s] life...&quot; The friendship was reciprocal. Almost a year after Lewis&#x27;s death, Barfield spoke of his friendship in a talk in the USA: &quot;Now, whatever he was, and as you know, he was a great many things, CS Lewis was for me, first and foremost, the absolutely unforgettable friend, the friend with whom I was in close touch for over 40 years, the friend you might come to regard hardly as another human being, but almost as a part of the furniture of my existence.&quot; When they met, Lewis was an atheist who told Barfield, &quot;I don&#x27;t accept God!&quot; Barfield was influential in converting Lewis. Lewis came to see that there were two kinds of friends, a first friend with whom you feel at home and agree (Lewis&#x27;s close friend Arthur Greeves was an example of this) and a second friend who brings to you a different point of view. He found Barfield&#x27;s contribution in this way particularly helpful despite, or because, &quot;during the 1920s, the two were to engage in a long dispute over Barfield&#x27;s (and their mutual friend, A.C. Harwood&#x27;s) connection to anthroposophy and the kind of knowledge that imagination can give us... which they affectionately called &#x27;The Great War&#x27;. Through their conversations, Lewis gave up materialist realism – the idea that our sensible world is self-explanatory and is all that there is – and moved closer to what he had always disparagingly referred to as &quot;supernaturalism.&quot; These conversations influenced Lewis towards writing his Narnia series. As well as being friend and teacher to Lewis, Barfield was (professionally) his legal adviser and trustee.

Barfield was an important intellectual influence on Lewis. Lewis wrote his 1949 book &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, the first Narnia chronicle, for his friend&#x27;s daughter Lucy Barfield and dedicated it to her. He also dedicated &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; to Barfield&#x27;s adopted son Geoffrey in 1952. Barfield also influenced his scholarship and world view. He dedicated his first scholarly book, &quot;The Allegory of Love&quot; (1936) to his &#x27;wisest and best of my unofficial teachers,&#x27; stating in its preface that he asked no more than to disseminate Barfield&#x27;s literary theory and practice. Barfield&#x27;s more than merely intellectual approach to philosophy is illustrated by a well-known interchange that took place between himself and Lewis, which Lewis did not forget. Lewis one day made the mistake of referring to philosophy as &quot;a subject.&quot; &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a &quot;subject&quot; to Plato,&quot; said Barfield, &quot;it was a way&quot;. In the third lecture of &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot; (1947), Lewis suggests that Barfield&#x27;s mentor, Rudolf Steiner, may have found the way to a &quot;redeemed scientific method that does not omit the qualities of the observed object&quot;.

Barfield was also an important influence on Tolkien. In a letter to C. A. Furth of Allen and Unwin in 1937, Tolkien wrote, &quot;the only philological remark (I think) in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is...: an odd mythological way of referring to linguistic philosophy, and a point that will (happily) be missed by any who have not read Barfield (few have), and probably by those who have.&quot; The reference in question comes when Bilbo visits the dragon Smaug&#x27;s treasure hoard within the Lonely Mountain:
&quot;To say that Bilbo&#x27;s breath was taken away is no description at all. There are no words left to express his staggerment, since Men changed the language that they learned of elves in the days when all was wonderful. Bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards before, but the splendour, the lust, the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to him. His heart was filled and pierced with enchantment...&quot;

Lewis wrote to Barfield in 1928 about his influence on Tolkien: &quot;You might like to know that when Tolkien dined with me the other night he said, apropos of something quite different, that your conception of the ancient semantic unity had modified his whole outlook, and he was always just going to say something in a lecture when your concept stopped him in time. &#x27;It is one of those things,&#x27; he said, &#x27;that when you have once seen it there are all sorts of things you never say again.&quot;

Barfield&#x27;s notion of final participation (the idea of a fully conscious participative unity with nature) brought to the Inklings ideas similar to those later expounded by others as radical orthodoxy, with its long theological history. It has roots in the Platonic idea of &quot;methexis&quot; passed on by Augustine and Aquinas, and offered a sacramental view of reality which Tolkien takes up in &quot;The Ring&quot; in, for example, the contemplative artistry and natural oneness of the elves, Tom Bombadil and the Hobbits&#x27; simple pleasures.

==Anthroposophy==
Barfield became an anthroposophist after attending a lecture by Rudolf Steiner in 1924. He studied the work and philosophy of Rudolf Steiner throughout his life, translated some of his works, and had some of his own early essays published in anthroposophical publications. This part of Barfield&#x27;s literary work includes the book &quot;The Case for Anthroposophy&quot; containing his Introduction to selected extracts from Steiner&#x27;s &quot;Riddles of the Soul&quot;. Steiner is always a formative presence in Barfield&#x27;s work, probably his major influence but Barfield&#x27;s thought should not be considered merely derivative of Steiner&#x27;s. Barfield expert G. B. Tennyson suggests that: &quot;Barfield is to Steiner as Steiner was to Goethe&quot;, which is illuminating so long as it isn&#x27;t taken as referring to relative stature. Barfield&#x27;s writing was not derivative, it was profoundly original, but he did not see himself as having moved beyond Steiner, as, in his opinion, Steiner had moved beyond Goethe. Barfield considered Steiner a much greater man in possession of a greater mind than Goethe, and of course he considered himself very small compared to both of them.

==Influence and opinions==
Barfield might be characterised as both a Christian writer and a learned anti-reductionist writer. His books have been republished by Barfield UK, with new editions including &quot;Unancestral Voice&quot;; &quot;History, Guilt, and Habit&quot;; &quot;Romanticism Comes of Age; The Rediscovery of Meaning; Speaker&#x27;s Meaning;&quot; and &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;. &quot;History in English Words&quot; seeks to retell the history of Western civilisation by exploring the change in meanings of various words. &quot;Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry&quot; is on the 1999 &quot;100 Best Spiritual Books of the Century&quot; list by Philip Zaleski.

Barfield was also an influence on T. S. Eliot who called Barfield&#x27;s book &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; &quot;a journey into seas of thought very far from ordinary routes of intellectual shipping.&quot;

In her book &quot;Splintered Light: Logos and Language in Tolkien&#x27;s World&quot;, Verlyn Flieger analyses the influence of Barfield&#x27;s &quot;Poetic Diction&quot; on the writing of J.R.R. Tolkien.

More recent discussions of Barfield&#x27;s work are published in Stephen Talbott&#x27;s &quot;The Future Does Not Compute: Transcending the Machines in Our Midst&quot;, Neil Evernden&#x27;s &quot;The Social Creation of Nature&quot;, Daniel Smitherman&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy and the Evolution of Consciousness&quot;, Morris Berman&#x27;s &quot;The Reenchantment of the World,&quot; and Gary Lachman&#x27;s &quot;A Secret History of Consciousness.&quot; In 1996 Lachman conducted perhaps the last interview with Barfield, versions of which appeared in &quot;Gnosis&quot; magazine and the magazine &quot;Lapis.&quot;

In his book &quot;Why the World Around You isn&#x27;t as it Appears: A Study of Owen Barfield&quot; (SteinerBooks, 2012), Albert Linderman presents Barfield&#x27;s work in light of recent societal examples and scholarship while writing for an audience less familiar with philosophical categories and history.

In a foreword to &quot;Poetic Diction&quot;, Howard Nemerov, US Poet Laureate, stated: &quot;Among the poets and teachers of my acquaintance who know POETIC DICTION it has been valued not only as a secret book, but nearly as a sacred one.&quot;

Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize–winning novelist, wrote: &quot;We are well supplied with interesting writers, but Owen Barfield is not content to be merely interesting. His ambition is to set us free. Free from what? From the prison we have made for ourselves by our ways of knowing, our limited and false habits of thought, our &#x27;common sense&#x27;.&quot;

The culture critic and psychologist James Hillman called Barfield &quot;one of the most neglected important thinkers of the 20th Century&quot;.

Harold Bloom, describing &quot;Poetic Diction&quot;, referred to it as &quot;a wonderful book, from which I keep learning a great deal&quot;.

The film &quot;Owen Barfield: Man and Meaning&quot; (1994), co-produced and written by G. B. Tennyson and David Lavery, directed and edited by Ben Levin, is a documentary portrait of Barfield.

Barfield has been held in high esteem by many contemporary poets, including Robert Kelly, Charles Stein, George Quasha, Tom Cheetham, and others.

===&quot;Poetic Diction&quot;===
Barfield&#x27;s book &quot;Poetic Diction&quot; begins with examples of &quot;felt changes&quot; arising in reading poetry, and discusses how these relate to general principles of poetic composition. But his greater agenda is &quot;the study of meaning&quot;. Using poetic examples, he sets out to demonstrate how the imagination works with words and metaphors to create meaning.
He shows how the imagination of the poet creates new meaning, and how this same process has been active, throughout human experience, to create and continuously expand language. For Barfield this is not just literary criticism:
it is evidence bearing on the evolution of human consciousness. This, for many readers, is his real accomplishment: his unique presentation of &quot;not merely a theory of poetic diction, but a theory of poetry, and not merely a theory of poetry, but a theory of knowledge&quot;. This theory was developed directly from a close study of the evolution of words and meaning, starting with the relation between the primitive mind&#x27;s myth making capacity, and the formation of words. Barfield uses numerous examples to demonstrate that words originally had a unified &quot;concrete and undivided&quot; meaning, which we now distinguish as several distinct concepts.
For example, he points out that the single Greek word &quot;pneuma&quot; (which can be variously translated as &quot;breath&quot;, &quot;spirit&quot;, or &quot;wind&quot;) reflects the original unity of these concepts of air, spirit, wind, and breath, all included in one &quot;holophrase&quot;. This Barfield considers to be not the application of a poetic analogy to natural phenomena, but the discernment of an actual phenomenal unity. Not only concepts, but the phenomena themselves, form a unity, the perception of which was possible to primitive consciousness and therefore reflected in language. This is the perspective Barfield believes to have been primordial in the evolution of consciousness, the perspective which was &quot;fighting for its life&quot;, as he phrases it, in the philosophy of Plato, and which, in a regenerate and more sophisticated form, benefiting from the development of rational thought, needs to be recovered if consciousness is to continue to evolve.

===&quot;Worlds Apart&quot;===
&quot;Worlds Apart&quot; is one of Barfield&#x27;s most brilliant performances. It is a fictional dialogue between a physicist, a biologist, a psychiatrist, a lawyer-philologist (who might be taken for Barfield himself), a linguistic analyst (more or less the villain), a theologian (who has reminded some readers of C. S. Lewis), a retired Waldorf School teacher, and a young man employed at a rocket research station. During a period of three days, the characters discuss and debate first principles, occasioned at first by the observation that the various branches of modern thought seem to be taking for granted an incompatibility with one another. The discussion culminates in a crescendo of some length from the retired teacher, who expounds the anthroposophical point of view.

===&quot;Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry&quot;===
&quot;Saving the Appearances&quot; explores the development of human consciousness across some three thousand years of history. Barfield argues that the evolution of nature is inseparable from the evolution of consciousness. What we call matter interacts with mind and wouldn&#x27;t exist without it. In Barfield&#x27;s lexicon, there is an &quot;unrepresented&quot; underlying base of reality that is extra-mental. This is comparable to Kant&#x27;s notion of the &quot;noumenal world&quot;. However, unlike Kant, Barfield entertained the idea that the &quot;unrepresented&quot; could be directly experienced, under some conditions.

Similar conclusions have been made by others, and the book has influenced, for example, the physicist Stephen Edelglass (who wrote &quot;The Marriage of Sense and Thought&quot;), and the Christian existentialist philosopher Gabriel Marcel, who wanted the book to be translated into French.

Barfield points out that the &quot;real&quot; world of physics and particles is completely different from the world we see and live in of things with properties.

<doc id="595567" wikidata="Q560682" url="?curid=595567" title="Hubert Védrine">
<text>Hubert Yves Pierre Védrine (; born 31 July 1947) is a French retired senior civil servant and politician who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1997 to 2002. A member of the Socialist Party (PS), he was an advisor and later secretary general at the Élysée under President François Mitterrand. Following his retirement from politics, Védrine became an advisor at Moelis &amp; Company.

== Early life and career ==
Following a history degree and graduating from both Sciences Po and ENA, Védrine had toyed with the idea of entering journalism but, on the advice of the historian and family friend Jean Lacouture, instead took a post at the culture ministry.

Védrine was one of the longest-serving aides to a French President and worked closely with President François Mitterrand from 1981 to 1995. Védrine served first as Mitterrand&#x27;s diplomatic advisor (the French equivalent of the National Security Advisor) from 1981 to 1988, then as Mitterrand&#x27;s spokesperson from 1988 to 1991, and finally as Secretary-General of the French presidency (the equivalent of the White House Chief of Staff) from 1991 to 1995.

Védrine then served as Foreign Minister of France from 1997 to 2002 in the government of Lionel Jospin.

After the re-election of Jacques Chirac in May 2002, Védrine was replaced by Dominique de Villepin. All three men were characterised by their strong opposition to unilateral action by the United States in Iraq.

Védrine popularized the neologism hyperpower to describe what he saw as the historically-unparalleled influence and might that were held by the United States at the turn of the century.

== Later career ==
In 2003, Védrine founded Hubert Vedrine Conseil, a consulting firm.

In 2005, he was appointed by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a member of the High Council for the Alliance of Civilizations, an initiative that seeks to galvanize international action against extremism through intercultural and interreligious dialogue and cooperation.

He took part in 2007 on the committee preparing the Paris Conference on the Environment to lay the foundations for a future United Nations Environment Organization.

Védrine is the author of more than 19 books, two of them having been translated in English by Philip H. Gordon: &quot;France in an age of globalization&quot;, co-authored with Dominique Moïsi (publisher: Brookings Institution Press, 2001) and &quot;History strikes back : how states, nations, and conflicts are shaping the twenty-first century&quot; (publisher: Brookings Institution Press, 2008), co-authored with Adrien Abecassis and Mohamed Bouabdallah.

Around the 2017 elections, news media reported that later President Emmanuel Macron sought regularly the advice of Védrine on foreign policy issues. In 2020, he was appointed by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to join a group of experts to support his work in a reflection process to further strengthen NATO&#x27;s political dimension.

<text>Hervé de Charette (; born 30 July 1938 in Paris) is a French centrist politician. He is a descendant of the royalist military leader François de Charette and of king Charles X of France. Member of the Union for French Democracy (UDF), he was elected deputy for the first time in 1986 as representative of the Maine-et-Loire &quot;département&quot;. During the first cohabitation, from 1986 to 1988, he served as Minister of Civil Service, then, during the second, from 1993 to 1995, as Minister of Housing. In the UDF, he remained faithful to the leader Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. Like him, and contrary to the most part of the UDF politicians, he supported the winning candidacy of Jacques Chirac in the 1995 presidential election and not that of Prime Minister Édouard Balladur. In this, after the campaign, he found and led the Popular Party for French Democracy (PPDF), a component of the UDF, and served as Minister of Foreign Affairs until the defeat of the Presidential Majority in the 1997 legislative election. In 2002, he joined the Union for a Popular Movement (&quot;Union pour un mouvement populaire&quot; or UMP). In December 2009, he left this party for the Nouveau Centre.

<text>Roland Dumas (; 23 August 1922 – 3 July 2024) was a French lawyer and Socialist politician who served as Foreign Minister under President François Mitterrand from 1984 to 1986 and from 1988 to 1993. He was also President of the Constitutional Council from 1995 to 2000.

==Biography==
===Youth===
Born in Limoges, Roland Dumas was the son of Élisabeth Lecanuet (1900–1964) and Georges Dumas (1895–1944), a civil servant in Limoges&#x27;s region and Socialist resistant to the German Occupation during the Second World War. Shot at by the Gestapo, he conveyed weapons for the Resistance. Roland Dumas was arrested after organizing a boycott of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra by French students. After the war, he completed his law and political science studies in the &quot;Ecole libre des sciences politiques&quot; and the London School of Economics.

As a journalist and lawyer, he defended 
Jean Mons, Secretary-General of the Defence Committee, from charges of negligence in a case where Mons&#x27;s assistant was accused of passing secrets of national security to communists. Because of this, he became close to François Mitterrand, president of the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance (UDSR) party, himself suspected in the same scandal.

===Politics===
In 1956, he was elected deputy for Haute-Vienne department under the UDSR banner. He lost his seat in the 1958 legislative election, which followed the return of General Charles de Gaulle to power. He came back into the French National Assembly between 1967 and 1968 as representative of the Corrèze department. As a member of the renewed Socialist Party (PS) led by Mitterrand, he became deputy for Gironde in 1973, then for Dordogne on the occasion of the &quot;pink wave&quot; of 1981. In 1974, he acted as defence lawyer for Hilarion Capucci, who was prosecuted in Israel on charges of smuggling weapons into the country for the PLO.

When President Mitterrand appointed Laurent Fabius as Prime Minister in July 1984, Dumas joined the cabinet as Minister of European Affairs. Five months later, he replaced Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson. He remained in this position until the Socialist defeat in the March 1986 legislative election. Nevertheless, he returned to the Quai d&#x27;Orsay after the re-election of Mitterrand in May 1988, until the PS defeat in the March 1993 legislative elections. He was the French Foreign Minister during the collapse of the Soviet Bloc, the Gulf War, and the negotiations of the Maastricht Treaty.

After losing reelection to the French National Assembly in 1993, he was nominated for President of the Constitutional Council in 1995. Under his presidency, the body argued in favour of complete judicial immunity for the French President.

Dumas was a member of the Emergency Committee for Iraq.

In June 2013, during an appearance on the French news channel La Chaîne parlementaire, Dumas claimed that British officials had been preparing for intervention in Syria two years before the start of the Arab Spring. &quot;I was in England two years before the violence in Syria on other business,&quot; he said. &quot;I met with top British officials, who confessed to me that they were preparing something in Syria. This was in Britain not in America. Britain was organising an invasion of rebels into Syria.&quot;

===Convictions===
Accused in the Elf affair, he resigned from the Presidency of the Constitutional Council in January 1999.

Dumas&#x27; conviction for criticising a public prosecutor in his book was found unlawful by the European Court of Human Rights in 2010, by five votes to two.

In May 2007, Dumas received a 12-month jail sentence (suspended) for funds he mis-appropriated acting as executor of the will of the widow of Alberto Giacometti.

=== Controversial comments on Valls ===
In February 2015, Dumas suggested Prime Minister Manuel Valls was probably acting under Jewish &quot;influence&quot;. During an interview on BFM-TV, Dumas stated that the prime minister &quot;has personal alliances that mean he has prejudices... Everyone knows he is married to someone really good but who has an influence on him,&quot; an apparent reference to Valls&#x27; wife, Anne Gravoin, who is Jewish. When directly asked by a reporter if Valls &quot;[was] under a Jewish influence?&quot; Dumas responded, &quot;Probably, I would think so.&quot; The Socialist Party subsequently released a statement declaring that Dumas&#x27;s claims were &quot;unworthy of a Socialist decorated by the Republic&quot;. Valls declined to comment on Dumas&#x27;s claims, except to say that Dumas was &quot;a man with a known past and his remarks which have done no credit to the Republic for a long time&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Dumas was married to Théodora Voultepsis, a former Miss Greece from 1951 through 1954, and to Anne-Marie Lillet, whom he married in 1961. (She was scion of the Lillet beverage family; they separated but never divorced.) Dumas turned 100 in August 2022, and died in Paris on 3 July 2024 at the age of 101.

<text>Claude Cheysson (; 13 April 1920 – 15 October 2012) was a French Socialist politician who served as Foreign Minister in the government of Pierre Mauroy from 1981 to 1984.

==Career==
Cheysson was born in Paris and attended the Cours Hattemer, a private school. He fled from France during World War II and joined the 2nd Armored Division of General Leclerc, serving as a second lieutenant in the 12th Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique Regiment. He joined the Foreign Ministry in 1948 and became head of the liaison service with the West German authorities the following year. As he moved through the ranks of the Foreign Ministry, he served as counsellor to the president of the government of French Indochina in 1952, cabinet chief of Premier Pierre Mendès France from 1954 to 1955, and general secretary of the Commission for Technical Cooperation in Africa from 1957 to 1962. He was director of the &quot;Organisme Saharien&quot; from 1962 until 1965, and ambassador to Indonesia from 1966 to 1969.

In 1973, Cheysson was appointed the French European Commissioner. His first post, which he held until 1977, was in charge of development policy, cooperation, budgets, and financial control. From 1977 until 1981, he took on the development portfolio.

In 1981 he left the commission and became a member of the French Government, serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs until 1984. (The ministry was renamed as the Ministry of External Relations, but the previous name was re-established in 1986.) He joined the Delors Commission, where he was responsible for Mediterranean policy and north–south relations, from 1985 to 1989.

By 1999, Cheysson joined the &quot;Collectif Liberté pour l&#x27;Afghanistan&quot;, an organization lobbying for the West to stop tolerating the Taliban and &quot;Osama bin Laden, the millionaire Saudi financier of terror&quot;.

<text>Friedrich Tietjen (1832 in Westerstede, Oldenburg – 1895 in Berlin) was a German astronomer.

He was director of the &quot;Astronomisches Rechen-Institut&quot; (ARI) from 1874 until his death in 1895. The Minor Planet Center credits him with the discovery of one minor planet, the 120-kilometer sized asteroid 86 Semele.

<text>The United States Department of Defense&#x27;s Office of Net Assessment (ONA) was created in 1973 by Richard Nixon to serve as the Pentagon&#x27;s &quot;internal think tank&quot; that &quot;looks 20 to 30 years into the military&#x27;s future, often with the assistance of outside contractors, and produces reports on the results of its research&quot;. The Director of Net Assessment is the principal staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense on net assessment.

According to Defense Directive 5111.11, the Director shall develop and coordinate net assessments of the standing, trends, and future prospects of U.S. military capabilities and military potential in comparison with those of other countries or groups of countries in order to identify emerging or future threats or opportunities for the United States. Paul Bracken explains that it is important to have a good grasp of net assessment because it is an &quot;important part of the language spoken by leaders in the higher levels of DOD&quot; and officers who lack familiarity &quot;will be at a disadvantage in communicating with the civilian leadership&quot;.

Andrew Marshall was named its first director, a position he continued to hold under succeeding administrations. In October 2014, Marshall announced plans to retire in January 2015. He was replaced by Jim Baker in May 2015.

==List of directors==
* Andrew Marshall, 1973 – January 2, 2015
* James H. Baker, May 14, 2015 – Present

==Notable staff==

<doc id="595587" wikidata="Q3485017" url="?curid=595587" title="Sinkin' in the Bathtub">
<text>Sinkin&#x27; in the Bathtub is the first Warner Bros. theatrical cartoon short as well as the first of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series. The short was released on April 19, 1930, at the Warner Bros. Theater in Hollywood. The cartoon features Bosko, and the title is a pun on the 1929 song &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Bathtub&quot;. The film was erroneously copyrighted under the same title as the 1929 song. It is now in the public domain in the United States as the copyright was not renewed.

The name of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series bears an obvious debt to the Walt Disney Animation Studios&#x27; &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; series, which began in 1929. Steve Schneider writes that this &quot;immediately reveals Harman and Ising&#x27;s belief that the only way to compete—or even to survive—in the cartoon trade was to cleave to the Disney version.&quot;

Made in 1930, this short marked the theatrical debut of Bosko the &quot;Talk-Ink Kid&quot; whom Harman and Ising had created to show to Warner Bros. Bosko became their first star character, surpassed only much later by Porky Pig and Daffy Duck. Notably, this is the only publicly released Bosko short to feature Bosko&#x27;s original blackface dialect provided by animator Carman Maxwell; the character would later adopt a more falsetto voice (played by sound effects man Bernard B. Brown and, later on, singer Johnny Murray) for later films. Bosko&#x27;s girlfriend Honey was voiced by Rochelle Hudson.

The short was produced, directed, supervised and co-animated by Harman and Ising, with animation by a very young Friz Freleng and his friends. Leon Schlesinger was credited as an associate producer, and the title card also gave credit to the Western Electric apparatus used to create the film.

Frank Marsales served as music director, arranging the tunes to be played by drummer-bandleader Abe Lyman and his orchestra of Brunswick Records musicians. All of the songs were recently popular numbers in the Warner Bros. catalog, which added a cross-promotional aspect. Beyond the title song which is heard at the beginning and the end, tunes included &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&quot;, &quot;Lady Luck&quot; from the 1929 film &quot;The Show of Shows&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Forever Blowing Bubbles&quot;, and &quot;Painting the Clouds with Sunshine&quot;.

==Plot synopsis==
The film opens with Bosko taking a bath while whistling &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Bathtub&quot;. A series of gags allows him to play the shower spray like a harp, pull up his pants by tugging his hair, and give the limelight to the bathtub itself, which stands on its hind feet to perform a dance. (There is a clear shot of a toilet during this scene, and the bathtub tears off sheets of toilet paper during its dance, permissible only in the pre-Hays Code days.)

Once he finds his car, which had left the garage to use the outhouse, Bosko goes to visit his girlfriend Honey, who is showering in front of an open window. &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&quot; plays in the background. A goat eats the flowers he brought, so he serenades her to get her to come out. A saxophone full of bubbles (caused when she dumps a bathtub full of soapy water into Bosko&#x27;s saxophone due to his butchering of &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&quot;) provide a floating cascade of steps for her as she alights from the balcony. &quot;I&#x27;m Forever Blowing Bubbles&quot; accompanies this action.

Their country drive presents grave perils for Bosko, with the first obstacle being a stubborn grazing cow. After the cow is pushed out of the way, the indignant cow walks away to the tune of Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Pomp and Circumstance Marches&quot;. The drive continues as the car is at first resistant to go up a steep hill, then speeds out of control while Bosko collides into various objects that create the sounds of ascending and descending C major scales. (Bosko exclaims &quot;mammy&quot; in the original version during this portion of the film.) The sequence ends with the car plunging over a cliff into a lake. Always able to adapt, Bosko continues their date as a boating trip and plays the last refrain (a reprise of &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Bathtub&quot;) using lilypads as a marimba.

The cartoon ends with Bosko saying the now-classic line &quot;That&#x27;s all Folks!&quot;

==Production==
This cartoon was first theatrically released with the lost Warner Bros./Vitaphone Technicolor film &quot;Song of the Flame&quot;.

This is the first publicly released non-Disney cartoon to have a pre-recorded soundtrack (in addition, &quot;Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid&quot; had a pre-synched track.)

Some of the animation by Hugh Harman and Rudy Ising was lifted from some of the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons they made a couple of years earlier.

==Release==
The short originally had a special premiere alongside the lost film Song of the Flame at the Warner Bros. Theater in Hollywood on April 19, 1930. Both would be released in theaters in the United States on May 25, 1930.

==In popular culture==
A clip of the cartoon was seen on &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; in the 1990 episode &quot;Accidental Playhouse.&quot;

==Home media==
The short was released on the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3&quot; box set.

<doc id="595593" wikidata="Q2357709" url="?curid=595593" title="Sisyrinchium">
<text>Sisyrinchium is a large genus of annual to perennial flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. Native to the New World, the species are known as blue-eyed grasses. Although they are not true grasses (Poaceae), they are monocots.

Several species in the eastern United States are threatened or endangered. This may be due to niche species emerging from their unique tendency toward rapid speciation which helps them adapt to specialized arenic habitats.
==Description==

These are not true grasses, but many species have the general appearance of grasses, as they are low-growing plants with long, thin leaves. They often grow on grasslands. Many species resemble irises, to which they are more closely related. Most species grow as perennial plants, from a rhizome, though some are short-lived (e.g. &quot;Sisyrinchium striatum)&quot;, and some are annuals (e.g. &quot;Sisyrinchium iridifolium&quot;).

The flowers are relatively simple and often grow in clusters.

Many species, particularly the South American ones, are not blue, despite the common name. The genus includes species with blue, white, yellow, and purple petals, often with a contrasting centre. Of the species in the United States, the Western Blue-eyed Grass &quot;(Sisyrinchium bellum&quot;) is sometimes found with white flowers, while the California Golden-eyed Grass (&quot;Sisyrinchium californicum&quot;) has yellow flowers.

==Taxonomy==

The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, based on the species &quot;Sisyrinchium bermudiana&quot; (commonly called &quot;Bermudiana&quot;). The taxonomy of this genus is rather perplexing and confusing, as several of these species, such as &quot;Sisyrinchium angustifolium&quot;, form complexes with many variants named as species. More genetic research and cladistic analysis need to be performed to sort out the relationships between the species. Some species, notably &quot;Sisyrinchium douglasii&quot;, have been transferred to the separate genus &quot;Olsynium&quot;. 

The greatest diversity for the genus is found in South America.

Approximately one third of the species in the genus have oil producing hairs called elaiophores to attract oil-bees. Nearly all these species are native to South America.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Sisyrinchíon&quot; is the Greek word, recorded by Pliny and Theophrastus, for the Barbary nut iris (&quot;Iris&quot; or &quot;Moraea sisyrinchium&quot;), and refers to the way the corm tunics resemble a shaggy goat&#x27;s-hair coat, &quot;sisýra&quot;. Authors as early as 1666 give the dubious etymology of Latin &quot;sūs&quot; &quot;pig&quot; and Greek &quot;rhynchos&quot; &quot;nose&quot;, referring to pigs grubbing the roots. As Goldblatt and Manning explain, &quot;the reason for applying the name to a genus of New World Iridaceae was apparently arbitrary.&quot;

== Selected species ==

There are up to 200 species, including:

<doc id="595601" wikidata="Q2846671" url="?curid=595601" title="Andrew Marshall (foreign policy strategist)">
<text>Andrew W. Marshall (September 13, 1921 – March 26, 2019) was an American foreign policy strategist who served as director of the United States Department of Defense&#x27;s Office of Net Assessment from 1973 to 2015. Appointed to the position by President Richard Nixon, Marshall remained in office during all successive administrations that followed until his retirement on January 2, 2015. He was succeeded in the role by James H. Baker.

==Early life and education==
Raised in Detroit, Michigan, Marshall pursued autodidactic interests in history, literature and the natural and social sciences from a young age. He graduated from Cass Technical High School (where he trained in machining and received the second-highest score on a citywide aptitude test for honors students similar in provenance to the SAT) in 1939. After briefly working in a factory and attending the University of Detroit for a year, he dropped out to take a position at the Murray Body Company, where he manufactured machine tools used in fabricating British airplane parts. Unable to serve in World War II due to a heart murmur, Marshall continued to work at Murray for the remainder of the war. He eventually resumed his formal studies at Wayne State University in 1943.

Marshall was admitted to the University of Chicago with graduate standing in 1945; under the chancellery of Robert Maynard Hutchins, students who were not enrolled in the generalist &quot;Chicago Plan&quot; undergraduate program pursued a course of study that led to a master&#x27;s degree instead of the baccalaureate. Strongly influenced by Friedrich Hayek, he earned an M.A. in economics from the institution in 1949. His master&#x27;s thesis was a sensitivity analysis of Lawrence Klein&#x27;s econometric model of the US economy; influential for its methodology, it has never been published except for a short abstract.

==RAND Corporation==
After electing to defer his studies in favor of eventually pursuing a Ph.D. in statistics (a program not yet offered by the University of Chicago), Marshall joined the RAND Corporation, the original &quot;think tank,&quot; at the behest of mentor W. Allen Wallis in 1949. While he would briefly return to academia to cover Wallis&#x27;s courses during the 1953-1954 term and continued to take statistics courses at George Washington University, Marshall soon gained the cachet of being part of &quot;a cadre of strategic thinkers&quot; that coalesced at the RAND Corporation in the 1950s and 1960s, a group that also included Charles J. Hitch, Herman Kahn, James Schlesinger and Daniel Ellsberg. Notably, he worked with Kahn on developing and advancing Monte Carlo methods.

==Office of Net Assessment==
Schlesinger would later become the U.S. Secretary of Defense and personally oversaw the creation of the Office of Net Assessment where Marshall would become the first director. The original main task of the office was to provide strategic evaluations on nuclear war issues. James Roche, Secretary of the Air Force in the administration of George W. Bush, worked for Marshall during the 1970s.

Andrew Marshall was consulted for the 1992 draft of Defense Planning Guidance (DPG), created by then-Defense Department staffers I. Lewis Libby, Paul Wolfowitz, and Zalmay Khalilzad; all of whom took to influential roles in the administration of George W. Bush.
Marshall has been noted for fostering talent in younger associates, who then proceed to influential positions in and out of the federal government: &quot;a slew of Marshall&#x27;s former staffers have gone on to industry, academia and military think tanks.&quot; Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Wolfowitz, among others, have been cited as Marshall &quot;star protégés.&quot;

In 2003, Marshall commissioned a report for the Pentagon predicting that abrupt climate change could bring the planet to the edge of anarchy as countries develop a nuclear threat to defend and secure dwindling food, water and energy supplies. The report, authored by Peter Schwartz and Doug Randall, predicted that &#x27;catastrophic&#x27; shortages of water and energy supply would become increasingly harder to overcome, plunging the planet into war by 2020. Schwarz and Randall further claimed that major European cities would be sunk beneath rising seas as Britain is plunged into a &#x27;Siberian&#x27; climate by 2020. At the time of the report&#x27;s publishing, it became notable for its link to Marshall and its accusations that leadership of the Pentagon purportedly &quot;covered up&quot; the report for four months until it was obtained by the British weekly &quot;The Observer&quot;.

In an interview in 2012, Major General Chen Zhou, the main author of four Chinese defence white papers, stated that Marshall was one of the most important figures in changing Chinese defence thinking in the 1990s and 2000s.

Andrew Marshall funded and published three best selling books by Michael Pillsbury: &quot;Chinese Views of Future Warfare&quot; in 1998, &quot;China Debates the Future Security Environment&quot;, and in 2015 an international bestseller, &quot;The Hundred-Year Marathon: China&#x27;s Secret Strategy to Replace America&quot;. According to a biography, &quot;The Last Warrior: Andrew Marshall and the Shaping of Modern American Defense Strategy&quot;, &quot;There was every reason for Marshall to expect that Chinese modes of thought would be even more alien to American ways of thinking than the Soviet leadership&#x27;s had been, and that some insight into the thinking of China&#x27;s political and military leaders could be gleaned from surveying open source writings. Pillsbury&#x27;s work on China, which Marshall had encouraged and supported since the early 1970s, illustrates both points.&quot; According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; March 26, 2019, obituary of Marshall, &quot;His gift was the framing of the question, the discovery of the critical question,&quot; said Michael Pillsbury, a China expert who advised and worked with Mr. Marshall throughout his career.&quot; The &quot;Washington Post&quot; obituary about Marshall stated, &quot;He had an uncanny ability to pick out only the most significant questions, then to drill down deeply,&quot; Pillsbury, a colleague of 45 years, said in an interview. &quot;He developed an iconoclastic, contrarian image.&quot;

&quot;Foreign Policy&quot; named Marshall one of its 2012 Top 100 Global Thinkers, &quot;for thinking way, way outside the Pentagon box&quot;.

==Death==
Marshall died on March 26, 2019, in Arlington, Virginia, at the age of 97. House Armed Services Committee ranking member Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX) announced his death during a hearing, saying, &quot;I can think of fewer people who have had a bigger impact of focusing our defense efforts, our national security, in the right direction than Mr. Marshall. He has been before our committee I don’t know how many times over the years. So I wanted to note that passing, but also to honor his memory because he made such a difference.&quot;

<text>The coat of arms of Lithuania is a mounted armoured knight holding a sword and shield, known as  (). Since the early 15th century, it has been Lithuania&#x27;s official coat of arms and is one of the oldest European coats of arms. It is also known by other names in various languages, such as , in the Lithuanian language or as , , (romanized: ) in the Polish, and Belarusian languages, meaning &quot;Chase&quot;. is translatable as Chaser, Pursuer, Knight, Horseman, similar to the Slavic vityaz (Old East Slavic for brave, valiant warrior). Historically – (mounted epic hero of old) or in heraldry – (mounted sovereign).

The once powerful and vast Lithuanian state, first as Duchy, then Kingdom, and finally Grand Duchy was created by the initially pagan Lithuanians, in reaction to pressures from the Teutonic Order and Swordbrothers which conquered modern-day Estonia and Latvia, forcibly converting them to Christianity. The Lithuanians are the only Balts that created a state before the modern era. Moreover, the pressure stimulated Lithuanians to expand their lands eastward into territory of Ruthenian Orthodox in the Dnieper&#x27;s upper basin and that of the Eurasian nomads in the Eurasian Steppe between lower Dnieper and Dniester, conquering present-day Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Russian lands in the process. This expansive Lithuania was conveyed in the coat of arms of Lithuania, the galloping horseman. The usage of the coat of arms of Lithuania spread even further throughout the country as the Third Statute of Lithuania (adopted in 1588) required to use it on each county&#x27;s seal.

The ruling Gediminid dynasty first adopted the horseback knight as a dynastical symbol which depicted them. Later, in the early 15th century, Grand Duke Vytautas the Great made the mounted knight on a red field the coat of arms of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Ever since, the Lithuanian rulers and nobles related to the ruling dynasty used the coat of arms. The knight&#x27;s shield was designed for decoration with the Columns of Gediminas or the Jagiellonian Double Cross. Article 15 of the Constitution of Lithuania, approved by national referendum in 1992, stipulates, &quot;The Coat of Arms of the State shall be a white Vytis on a red field&quot;.

== Blazoning ==
The heraldic shield features the field gules (red) with an armoured knight on a horse &quot;salient&quot; argent (silver). The knight is holding in his dexter hand a sword argent above his head. A shield azure hangs on the sinister shoulder of the knight with a double cross/two-barred cross or (gold) on it. The horse saddle, straps, and belts are azure. The hilt of the sword and the fastening of the sheath, the stirrups, the curb bits of the bridle, the horseshoes, as well as the decoration of the harness, are or (gold).


== Names of the coat of arms ==
In early heraldry, a knight on horseback is usually depicted as ready to defend himself and is not yet called . It is unknown for certain what Lithuania&#x27;s coat of arms was initially called.

=== Lithuanian language ===
The origins of the Lithuanian proper noun are also unclear. At the dawn of the Lithuanian National Revival, Simonas Daukantas employed the term &#x27;, referring not to the Lithuanian coat of arms, but to the knight, for the first time in his historical piece , published in 1846. The etymology of this particular word is not universally accepted; it is either a direct translation of the Polish &#x27;, a common noun constructed from the Lithuanian verb (&quot;to chase&quot;), or, less likely, a derivative from the East Slavic vityaz. In western South Slavic languages (Slovenian, Croatian/Serbian/Montenegrin and Macedonian) and Hungarian, denotes the lowest feudal rank, a knight. According to the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, is derived from the Old High German word .

The first presumption, raised by the linguist Pranas Skardžius in 1937, is challenged by some, as &#x27; does not mean &quot;chasing (knight)&quot;. In support of the second proposal, the Lithuanian language has words with the stem -&quot;vyt&quot; in personal names like Vytenis; furthermore, &#x27; has a structure common to words derived from verbs. According to professor Leszek Bednarczuk, there existed a derivative word , in the Old Lithuanian language, which translates to English as pursuit (from ), chase (from ).

For the 13th century the Old Prussian word &quot;vitingas&quot; is attested, meaning &quot;knight&quot; or &quot;nobleman&quot;. In today&#x27;s Lithuania, it can be found in place names, personal names and action verbs. So it is possible that in the Old Lithuanian language there was a similar word describing act of chasing an enemy or an armed horseman chasing an enemy. Another possibility is that Grand Duke Vytenis name is derived from the Old Prussian word &quot;vitingas&quot;. Therefore, Vytenis&#x27; reign (1295–1316) is also associated with the word &quot;Vytis&quot; as the Ruthenian Hypatian Codex mentions that after beginning to rule the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th century, he came up with a seal with an armored horseman and a sword raised above his head (in the Codex&#x27;s original Old Church Slavonic it is written that Vytenis named it ).

Several historical sources mention place names which names are probably derived from the word. 
A Teutonic source, probably dating from the late 14th century or early 15th century, mentions a place referred to as . This is translatable to Vytenis&#x27; Court in German. It was located close to the Lithuanian Bisenė fortress, the base for Vytenis&#x27; attack on the Teutonic Christmemel fortress in 1315. In 1629 Konstantinas Sirvydas used a toponym () on the basis of a document from , and associated it with personal names Vygailas, Vytenis, Vytautas. This version is also supported by the fact that the Grand Dukes of Lithuania themselves were depicted on early Lithuanian seals, therefore it is likely that the horseman on the seal of Vytenis was named after him. Moreover, an old militant caste of knights among the Scandinavians and Lithuanians was called &quot;Viti&quot; (the origin of this name is unknown), who became particularly active since ~1150 for religious reasons.

In the 17th century in his Polish-Latin-Lithuanian dictionary Konstantinas Sirvydas translated the Polish word &quot;Pogonia&quot; in the sense of the person doing the chasing into Lithuanian as &quot;Waykitoias&quot;, and in the sense of the act of chasing as &quot;Waykimas&quot;. Today &quot;Waykimas&quot; (&quot;Vaikymas&quot; in the modern Lithuanian orthography) is considered to be the earliest known Lithuanian language name for the coat of arms of Lithuania. In the multilingual book of poetry , published by Vilnius University in 1729, the coat of arms of Lithuania in Lithuanian language is described as the Horse of Palemon (). &#x27; was also used into the 19th century, together with another Lithuanian name – &#x27;.

In 1884, Mikalojus Akelaitis referred to the coat of arms of Lithuania &quot;per se&quot; as in the &quot;Aušra&quot; newspaper. This name became popular and eventually became official in the independent Republic of Lithuania. Originally called in 1st person Sg. Dat., by the 1930s came to be called in 1st person Sg. Dat.

=== Slavic languages ===
The words &quot;pogoń&quot; and &quot;pogonia&quot; have been known in Polish since the 14th century in the sense of &quot;pursuit&quot; or the legal obligation to chase fleeing opponent. It was not until the 16th century that the use of the word appeared to describe an armed horseman.

The word came into heraldic use in 1434, when King Władysław II granted a coat of arms with this name (&quot;Pogonya&quot;) to Mikołaj, the mayor of Lelów. The coat of arms depicted a hand wielding a sword emerging from a cloud. The resemblance to the Lithuanian coat of arms of the king is obvious, so it is possible that it was an abatement of the ruler&#x27;s coat of arms. The word &quot;pogonia&quot; to describe the Lithuanian coat of arms in the Polish language for the first time appears in Marcin Bielski&#x27;s chronicle, published in 1551. However, Bielski makes a mistake, and speaking about the Lithuanian coat of arms he describes Polish noble coat of arms: &quot;From this custom Lithuanian principality uses Pogonia as its coat of arms, that is an armed hand passes a bare sword&quot;. The term gradually became established with the spread of the Polish language and culture. is also found in Prince Roman Sanguszko&#x27;s documents from 1558 and 1564.

The emblem was described a century earlier, in a document of Supreme Duke Władysław III Jagiellon from 1442 in which he confirmed the rights of the Czartoryski, descendants of Karijotas, to use the armed horseman (; ), as well as in Jan Długosz&#x27;s or the early 16th-century Bychowiec Chronicle. Another popular Polish term was &#x27;. The symbol&#x27;s meaning and appearance also changed: the old defender of the land became more and more like a rider chasing an enemy. The name &#x27; was first recorded legally in the Third Statute of Lithuania of 1588. The Lithuanian Statutes were used not only in Lithuania, but also in White Ruthenia and Little Russia following the Partitions in 1795, into the 19th century.

== Possible early beginnings ==

The leader of neo-pagan movement Romuva, Lithuanian ethnologist and folklorist Jonas Trinkūnas suggested that the Lithuanian horseman depicts Perkūnas, considered as the god of the Lithuanian soldiers, thunder, lightning, storms, and rain in Lithuanian mythology. It is believed that the may represent Perkūnas as supreme god or Kovas who was also a war god and has been depicted as a horseman since ancient times. Very early on, Perkūnas was imagined as a horseman and archeological findings testify that Lithuanians had amulets with horsemen already in the 10th–11th centuries, moreover, Lithuanians were previously buried with their horses who were sacrificed during pagan rituals, and prior to that it is likely that these horses carried the deceased to the burial sites. One of the pendants made from brass and symbolizing a horseman was found in tumulus in the Plungė District Municipality, dating to the 11th–12th centuries.

Lithuanian mythologists believe that the bright rider on the white horse symbolizes the ghost of the ancestral warrior, reminiscent of core values and goals, giving strength and courage. Gintaras Beresnevičius also points out that a white horse had a sacral meaning to Balts. These interpretations coincide with one of the interpretations of the German coat of arms, that suggests an &quot;adler&quot; being the bird of Odin, a god of war, which is commonly depicted as a horserider.

== Emblems of Lithuania&#x27;s rulers (before 1400) ==
The old Lithuanian heraldry of the Lithuanian nobles was characterized by various lines, arrows, framed in shields, colored and passed down from generation to generation. They were mostly used until the Union of Horodło (1413) when 47 Lithuanian families were granted various Polish coat of arms, yet some Samogitian nobles retained old Lithuanian heraldry up to the mid-16th century.

The second redaction of the Lithuanian Chronicles, compiled in the 1520s at the court of Albertas Goštautas mentions that semi-legendary Grand Duke Narimantas (late 13th century) was the first Grand Duke to adopt knight on horseback as his and the Grand Duchy&#x27;s coat of arms. It describes it as an armed man on a white horse, on the red field, with a naked sword over his head as if he was chasing someone, as the author explains that is why it is called &quot;погоня&quot; (&quot;pohonia&quot;). A slightly later edition of the chronicle, so-called Bychowiec Chronicle, tells a similar story, without mentioning coat of arms name: &quot;when Narimantas took the throne of the Grand Duke of Lithuania, he handed his Centaur coat of arms to his brothers and made a coat of arms of a rider with a sword for himself. This coat of arms indicates a mature ruler capable of defending his homeland with a sword&quot;.

The legend of the adoption of the Lithuanian coat of arms at the time of Narimantas in the version of Bychowiec Chronicle is repeated by later authors: Augustinus Rotundus, Maciej Stryjkowski, Bartosz Paprocki and later historians and heraldists of the 17th and 18th centuries.

=== Symbols of Mindaugas ===

We do not know the symbols used by the first rulers of Lithuania. One of the few relics that have survived to our times is the seal of Mindaugas. In 1236 Mindaugas united several Lithuanian tribes and accepted Roman Catholicism in 1251. In 1253 he was crowned by the papal legate as King of Lithuania and his realm was elevated to the rank of a kingdom. However the authenticity of a partially survived seal, attached to the act of 1255, according to which Selonia was transferred to the Livonian Order, is disputed. According to the 1393 description, when the legend was still intact, the seal of Mindaugas had an inscription: ().
In 1263, following the assassination of King Mindaugas and his family members by Daumantas and Treniota, Lithuania suffered internal disorder as three of his successors: Treniota, his son-in-law Švarnas, and his son Vaišvilkas were assassinated during the next seven years. Stability returned with Traidenis&#x27; reign, designated Grand Duke c. 1270. At a similar time, the ancient Lithuanian capital Kernavė was first mentioned in 1279 in the &quot;Livonian Rhymed Chronicle&quot; by noting that the Livonian Order&#x27;s army devastated an area in King Traidenis&#x27; lands, which was their main objective (part of early military clashes prior to the Lithuanian Crusade). The coat of arms, seals or symbols of Traidenis are unknown. However, archaeological findings in the 13th and 14th century necropolis in Kernavė offer an astounding variety of symbols and ornaments, of which plants, herbs, palmettes motifs, and suns (swastikas) are one of the most distinct symbols, depicted on the discovered headbands and rings, dating to the pagan period before the Christianization of Lithuania.

=== Symbols of Gediminas ===
Grand Duke Gediminas&#x27;s authentic symbols did not survive to this day. On 18 July 1323 in Lübeck imperial scribe John of Bremen made a copy of three letters sent by Gediminas on 26 May to the recipients in Saxony. According to the notary&#x27;s transcript, the oval seal of Gediminas had a twelve corners edging, at the middle of the edging was an image of a man with long hairs, who sat on a throne and held a crown (or a wreath) in his right hand and a sceptre in his left hand, moreover, a cross was engraved around the man along with a Gediminas&#x27; title in Latin.

=== Symbols on coins of Vytautas and Jogaila ===
The unique symbol of a spearhead with a cross appeared on Pečat&#x27;-type coin minted in the late 14th century. These coins are usually attributed to Jogaila and Vytautas.Several very rare Lithuanian coins were found with a lion or leopards and the Columns of Gediminas, dated to the reign of Vytautas the Great and Jogaila in the 14th century (one of them was found in Kernavė). There is still disagreement where these coins were minted, with the most likely location being Smolensk, other proposed are Polotsk, Vyazma, Bryansk, Ryazan or Vilnius. Such coins symbolized the Ruthenian vassalship. The leopards were depicted with lily-shaped tails, which symbolized a sovereign ruler, therefore such coins must have been minted after the Pact of Vilnius and Radom in 1401 when Vytautas became fully in charge of the Lithuanian affairs. Vytautas minted such coins with leopards in the Principality of Smolensk before its Uprising of 1401 and after 1404 when it became a permanent part of Lithuania. Another type of coins with lion and node symbol are found in eastern Lithuania and Vilnius, researchers associate them with Skirgaila or Jogaila, however such associations lack genuine evidence as the seal of Jogaila attached to the Union of Krewo and the 1382 seal of Skirgaila were not preserved. Despite that, it is possible that the Ruthenian lion also was one of the early coat of arms of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as Jogaila in the Union of Krewo styled himself as: (). Historian suggested that the lion was abolished as the Lithuanian coat of arms after the Union of Krewo because in medieval heraldry it was equivalent to the Polish Eagle (lion is the king of animals, while eagle is the king of birds) and Lithuania at the time became a vassal state of the Kingdom of Poland, thus with a lower status.
The Lithuanian dukes and nobles declined Uliana of Tver&#x27;s, Jogaila&#x27;s mother, suggestion to baptise the Lithuanians as Orthodox before the Union of Krewo and sought Catholicism instead. Grand Duke Jogaila also rejected the Grand Prince of Moscow Dmitry Donskoy&#x27;s offer to marry his daughter Sofia, convert Lithuania into an Orthodox state and to recognize himself as a vassal of Dmitry Donskoy, instead he chose Catholicism and married Queen Jadwiga of Poland, while also continuing to title himself as ruler of all the Rus&#x27; people, therefore minting coins with his portrait (as a horseman) on the obverse and a lion with a braid above him on the reverse, other Jogaila&#x27;s coins features the Polish Eagle instead of his portrait on one side and a lion on the other side. In 2021, a treasure was discovered in Raišiai, with 40 Jogaila&#x27;s coins (Denars), some of which are with lions while others are with horsemen wielding swords or spears, most of these coins were minted in 1377–1386 (prior to crowning of Jogaila as the Polish King).
The Treasure of Verkiai, discovered in 1941, has 1983 coins of Vytautas the Great which resembles the &quot;Pečat&quot;-type coins, however, they likely have a crossbow bolt (instead of an arrowhead or a spearhead) and a cross on one side and the Columns of Gediminas on the other side, thus they presumably have been minted later than the &quot;Pečat&quot;-type coins. Quite a lot of such coins of Vytautas the Great were also found in other places of Lithuania (mostly in the southeastern and central part, but also in Samogitia), Ukraine (especially in Volhynia), and Belarus. In comparison, coins attributed to Jogaila, which have a similar appearance to the &quot;Pečat&quot;&#x27;-type coins, has a spearhead and a cross on one side and the Double Cross of the Jagiellonians () in a shield on the other side.

Following the Christianization of Lithuania, in circa 1388, Grand Duke Jogaila minted new coins: with a fish rolled into a ring (Christian sign of the fish) and inscription &quot;КНѦЗЬ ЮГА&quot; (Duke Jogaila) on the obverse and with a Double Cross of the Jagiellonians in a shield on the reverse. It is believed that such coins were minted to commemorate the Christianization of Lithuania and the Christian sign of the fish could have been chosen when Pope Urban VI officially recognized Lithuania as a Catholic state (such recognition occurred on 17 April 1388). Nevertheless, a fish–blossom symbol, depicted on the coins, can also be associated with an earlier date of 11 March 1388 when Pope Urban VI recognized the Roman Catholic Diocese of Vilnius, which was established by Grand Duke Jogaila. In any case, the main purpose of this symbol was to showcase the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as a Catholic state, recognized and under the auspices of the Pope. Lithuania was the last state in Europe to be Christianized.

=== Knight on horseback ===

The coat of arms of Lithuania originate from rulers depictions on seals. Originally the riding horseman symbolized the ruler of the Duchy of Lithuania (Duchy of Vilnius), which was the most important land of the state. Algirdas was probably the first ruler to use a seal with a depiction of himself on horseback. The seal, which was attached to Polish-Lithuanian treaty of 1366, wasn&#x27;t preserved, and we know its appearance only thanks to historian Tadeusz Czacki who claimed to have seen the seal. The oldest preserved such seal is Jogaila&#x27;s seal that he was using in years 1377–1380, when he became Grand Duke of Lithuania. Duke of Kernavė Vygantas&#x27; seal of 1388 is the oldest preserved seal with a riding knight depicted on the shield, giving it a status of a coat of arms. Jogaila and other Algirdas sons: Skirgaila, Lengvenis, Kaributas, Vygantas, and Švitrigaila all were using seals with a horseman-type images. The horseman was chosen due to at the time flourishing culture of knighthood in Europe. At first, the charging knight was depicted riding to left or right, and holding a lance instead of the sword: two seals of Lengvenis of 1385 and of 1388 exhibit this change. Initially Kęstutis and his son Vytautas were depicted on their seals as standing warriors. Only later Vytautas adopted, like other Lithuanian dukes, the image of a riding knight.
The establishment of the sword in the heraldry of the Lithuanian rulers is related to the ideological changes of the ruling Gediminids dynasty. The lance was more often exhibited on the seals of Skirgaila and Kaributas. In 1386, after Jogaila was crowned as King of Poland, a new heraldic seal was made for him, with four coat of arms: white eagle, representing Kingdom of Poland, knight on a horse, with lance in hand and a Double Cross on his shield, representing the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and coat of arms Kalisz land and Kuyavia. It was the first time that a double cross was depicted on the Lithuanian horseman&#x27;s shield. The Double Cross was adopted by Jogaila after his baptism as Władysław and marriage with a queen Jadwiga of Poland in 1386, daughter of Louis I of Hungary, therefore the Double Cross was most likely taken over from the Kingdom of Hungary where it spread in the 12th century from the Byzantine Empire. It is also possible that the new coat of arms was made in imitation of the Holy Cross relics from the sanctuary of Łysa Góra, and with this gesture the newly crowned king emphasised his sincere faith. The symbolism of the Double Cross was connected with this event&#x27;s significance for both Jogaila and the entire land. A similar cross in Western heraldry is called the patriarchal Cross of Lorraine, and it is used by archbishops while the cross itself symbolizes baptism.
=== Columns of Gediminas ===

The Columns of Gediminas are one of the earliest surviving national symbols of Lithuania and its historical coats of arms. Historian Edmundas Rimša, who analyzed the ancient coins, suggested that the Columns of Gediminas symbolize the Trakai Peninsula Castle Gates. There is no data that they were used by Grand Duke Gediminas himself, and it is believed that their name originated when Gediminas was considered the founder of the Gediminids dynasty. Since 1397, the Columns of the Gediminids were undoubtedly used on Vytautas the Great coat of arms, and it is believed that a similar symbol may have been used by his father Kęstutis, who was Duke of Trakai and Grand Duke of Lithuania, titles which Vytautas inherited. After Vytautas&#x27; death, the symbol was taken over by his brother Grand Duke Sigismund Kęstutaitis. At first, the Columns used to represent the family of Kęstutis, and since the 16th century, when Grand Duke Jogaila&#x27;s successors started using them in Lithuania as well, the Columns became the symbol of all Gediminids. It was Grand Duke Casimir IV Jagiellon who made the Columns of the Gediminids as the coat of arms of his dynasty after becoming the Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1440.
In heraldry, the Columns of Gediminas were usually pictured in gold or yellow on a red field, while they were occasionally portrayed in silver or white since the second half of the 16th century. There is no doubt that the Columns of the Gediminids are of local origin as similar symbols can be found on the insignias of the Lithuanian nobility. It is believed that the Columns of the Gediminids were derived from signs used to mark property.

Compared to the Double Cross of the Jagiellonian dynasty, the Columns of the Gediminids had been used more predominantly in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Columns of the Gediminids were featured on the Lithuanian coins of the 14th and subsequent centuries; the banners of the regiments led by Grand Duke Vytautas at the Battle of Grunwald; the 15th- and 16th-century church paraphernalia given to Vilnius Cathedral; the 15th-century seals of the Lithuanian Franciscans and major state seals in 1581–1795; book graphics; and the pieces of work by Vilnius&#x27; goldsmiths. Combined with the knight on horseback, the Columns of Gediminas were also embedded on the Lithuanian cannon barrels in the 16th and 17th centuries. The symbol also decorated horse bridles and landmarks of the dominions of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania. In 1572, after the death of the last male Gediminid descendant, Grand Duke Sigismund II Augustus, the Columns of Gedimimas remained in the insignias of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as the secondary (alongside the knight on horseback) coat of arms of the state. In later years, the Columns of Gediminas were called simply as the Columns (it is known from the early 16th century sources).

== Official coat of arms of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ==

=== 15th century ===
The meaning of the Lithuanian ruler&#x27;s coat of arms and the coat of arms of the Lithuanian state was given to the horseman not by Jogaila, but by his cousin, the Grand Duke Vytautas the Great. Firstly, around 1382, he changed the infantry on his coat of arms, inherited from his father Grand Duke Kęstutis, to a horseman, then made the portrait heraldic – in Vytautas&#x27; majestic seal (early 15th century), he is surrounded by the coat of arms of lands belonging to him, in one hand he holds a sword, which represents the power of the Grand Duke of Lithuania, in the other hand – a raised shield (on which a horseman is depicted), which, like an apple of royal power, symbolizes the Lithuanian state ruled by him. Furthermore, Vytautas the Great minted coins with the horseman on one side and the Columns of Gediminas on the other side.

In the 15th century, Jan Długosz claimed that Vytautas brought forty regiments to the victorious Battle of Grunwald in 1410 and that everyone used red flags of which thirty regiments flags had an embroidered armored horseman with a raised sword riding on a white, sometimes black, bay or dappled horse, while the rest of ten regiments flags had embroidered Columns of Gediminas with which Vytautas marked his elite troops with horses. According to Długosz, those flags were named after lands or dukes: Vilnius, Kaunas, Trakai, Medininkai, Sigismund Korybut, Lengvenis, and other. It is believed that the regiments with the Columns of Gediminas were brought from Vytautas&#x27; homeland (the Duchy of Trakai), and with a horseman – from other areas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Sigismund Korybut during his visit to Prague at the invitation of the Czech Hussites in 1422 as a delegate of Grand Duke Vytautas the Great, was depicted in a drawing wherein he carries his armorial banner decorated with a white charging knight on a red field; at its top, there is a narrow streamer, which the Germans, in particular, were fond of depicting in the 15th century.

The history between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Lithuanian Jagiellonian dynasty and the Kingdom of Hungary and Kingdom of Croatia is closely related as Władysław III Jagiellon, the eldest son of Władysław II Jagiełło and his Lithuanian wife Sophia of Halshany, was crowned as the King of Hungary and King of Croatia on 15 May 1440 in Visegrád, moreover, following his father&#x27;s death, he also inherited the title of the Supreme Duke () of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, held it in 1434–1444 and presented himself with it, as such share of powers was agreed in the Union of Horodło of 1413 between his father and Grand Duke Vytautas the Great. The Royal Seal of Władysław III Jagiellon includes a Lithuanian (&quot;&quot;) with wings laid out above the coat of arms of Hungary and alongside the Polish Eagle.

At the end of the 14th century, the knight on horseback appeared on the first Lithuanian coins, however, this figure had not yet fully formed, therefore in some coins, the knight is depicted as riding to the left, in others – to the right. In some he holds a spear while others depict a sword; the horse can either be standing in place or galloping. The Double Cross was used in isolation on the Lithuanian coins of the late 14th century and on the banner of the royal court referred to in the Lithuanian language as ().
During Grand Duke Alexander Jagiellon&#x27;s reign in Lithuania from 1492 to 1506, the depiction of the knight&#x27;s direction was established – the horse was always galloping to the left (in the heraldic sense – to the right). Also, the knight was for the first time depicted with a scabbard, while the horse – with a horse harness, however, the knight does not yet have on his shoulder a shield with the double-cross of the Jagiellonian dynasty. Moreover, Alexander&#x27;s coins also depict an eagle as the symbol of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania&#x27;s dynastic claim to the Polish throne. During the reign of Grand Duke Sigismund I the Old, who ruled Lithuania from 1506 to 1544, the image of the horseman was moved to the other side of the coins – the reverse, thus marking that it was the coin of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The knight was also for the first time depicted with a shield with the Double-Cross of the Jagiellonian dynasty. In heraldry, such an image of the horseman is only associated with the Lithuanian state. In the 15th century, the Double Cross of the Jagiellonians became an integral part of the Lithuanian coat of arms and was started to be depicted on the horseman&#x27;s shield.

At the beginning of the 15th century, the colors and composition of the seal became uniform: on a red field a white (silver) charging knight with a sword raised above his head, with a blue shield with a Double Golden Cross to his left shoulder (during the reign of Kęstutaičiai dynasty – red shield with the golden Columns of Gediminas); horse bridles, leather belts and a short girdle – colored in blue. Metals (gold and silver) and the two most important colors of medieval coats of arms were used for the Lithuanian coat of arms – Gules (red) then meant material, or earthly (life, courage, blood), Azure (blue) – spiritual, or heavenly (heaven, divine wisdom, mind) values.

=== 16th century ===

Only in the 16th century a distinction between the ruler (Grand Duke) and state emerged (it was the same entity previously), from which time one also finds mention of a state flag. In 1578, Alexander Guagnini was the first to describe such a state flag, according to him the state flag of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was made of red silk and had four tails, its principal side, to the right of the flag staff, was charged with a white mounted knight underneath the ducal crown; the other side bore an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The highly revered Blessed Virgin Mary was considered the patron saint of the state of Lithuania, and even the most prominent state dignitaries favoured her image on their flags, thus the saying: &quot;Lithuania – land of Mary&quot;. Later only the knight is mentioned embroidered on both sides of the state flag.

After the Union of Lublin, which was signed on 1 July 1569 in Lublin, Poland, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was established, thus a joint coat of arms of the new country was adopted. Nevertheless, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania remained a separate state within the Commonwealth and had a separate army which continued using the coats of arms of Lithuania on its uniforms. Its four quarterly fields portrayed, in diagonal, the eagle and the riding knight as the symbols of the two constituent states. Hence, the old colors of the coat of arms of Lithuania, probably influenced by the colors of the coat of arms of Poland (red, white, and yellow), began to change: sometimes the horse blanket was depicted in red or purple, the leather belts in yellow; however the horseman&#x27;s shield with the golden Double Cross changed less. In 1588 the third Statute of Lithuania was adopted and in the 12th article of the fourth chapter of the Statute it is stated that each county is given seals with the coat of arms of Lithuania for approval of decisions, and the name of the county must be written on these seals.

In 1572, following the death of Grand Duke Sigismund II Augustus, the last male descendant of the Jagiellonian dynasty as he did not leave any male heir to the throne, the Double Cross remained as a symbol in the national coat of arms and was started to be referred to as simply the Cross of &quot;&quot; after losing the connection with the dynasty.

=== 17th century to 1795 ===
The Renaissance introduced minor stylistic changes and variations: long feathers waving from the tip of the knight&#x27;s helm, a long saddle-cloth, the horsetail turned upwards and shaped as nosegay. With these changes, the red flag with its white knight survived until the end of the 18th century and Grand Duke Stanislaus II Augustus was the last Grand Duke of Lithuania to employ it. His flag was colored in crimson, had two tails, and was decorated with the knight on one side and the ruler&#x27;s monogram – SAR (Stanislaus Augustus Rex) on the other side. SAR monogram was also inscribed on the flagpole finial. In 1795, after the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Grand Duchy of Lithuania was annexed to the Russian Empire, with a smaller part going to the Kingdom of Prussia, and traditional coat of arms of Lithuania, which represented the state for more than four centuries, was abolished and the Russification of Lithuania was imposed.

== 1795–1918 ==
At first, the charging knight was interpreted as the country&#x27;s ruler. As time passed, he became a knight who is chasing intruders out of his native country. Such an interpretation was especially popular in the 19th century, and the first half of the 20th century, when Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire and sought its independence. During the Lithuanian National Revival in the 19th century, Lithuanian intellectuals Teodor Narbutt and Simonas Daukantas claimed that the reviving Lithuanian nation is the inheritor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania heritage, including the Lithuanian coat of arms &quot;, which was widely used in their organized events.

=== 19th-century anti-Russian uprisings ===
Uprisings to restore the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth like the 1830–31 November Uprising and 1863–64 January Uprising saw &quot; being used as a symbol of rebellion against the Russian Empire. The Lithuanian Vytis was widely used alongside the Polish White Eagle throughout the uprisings on flags, banners, coins, banknotes, seals, medals, etc. After the dethronement of Emperor Nicholas I Romanov (Emperor of Russia since 1825, King of Poland 1825–1831) by the Sejm during its proceedings in Warsaw on 25 January 1831, the coats of arms of the Russian Emperors were removed from the mint dies and Polish złotys with Eagle and Vytis were introduced into circulation, which were manufactured at the Warsaw&#x27;s Banknote Factory and minted at the Warsaw Mint, as on 9 December 1830 the Provisional Government appointed the Bank Polski to manage the Warsaw Mint.

The 1863–64 January Uprising spread especially wide in the ethnic Lithuanian lands, whereas many rebels demanded for a completely independent, sovereign Lithuanian state, however at the time the majority of the Lithuanians decided to support the Polish–Lithuanian union in order to fight the Russian oppression more effectively. In the Soviet times, the 1863–64 January Uprising was interpreted as a class struggle between peasantry and landed aristocracy, while since 1990, it came to be seen in Lithuania as a strife for liberation from the Russian rule. On 22 November 2019, upon the rediscovery of their remains on the Gediminas&#x27; Hill, the 1863–64 January Uprising commanders Konstanty Kalinowski and Zygmunt Sierakowski were buried at the Rasos Cemetery in Vilnius, while the flags covering their coffins were presented to the President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda and the President of Poland Andrzej Duda.

=== In the Russian Empire (1795–1915) ===
Following the partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, most of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was absorbed by the Russian Empire and Vytis was incorporated into the Greater Coat of arms of the Russian Empire. Vytis was the coat of arms of the Vilna Governorate following the incorporation of Vilnius and surrounding lands into the Russian Empire. Statues of Vytis placed on the White Columns of Vilnius greeted visitors at the entrances to Vilnius from 1818 until 1840, when the statues were replaced with the double-headed eagles – the state symbol of the Russian Empire. In 2019, the Mayor of Vilnius Remigijus Šimašius suggested that the White Columns of Vilnius in the city&#x27;s eldership of Naujamiestis should be restored. A notable example of the coat of arms of Lithuania usage during the Tsarist period is on the bridge railings above the Vilnelė River in Vilnius. Several authentic coat of arms of Lithuania survived the occupations and annexations. For example, on the side wall of the Vilnius Cathedral, on the main portal of the Dominican Church of the Holy Spirit and on the Gate of Dawn.
However, in 1845 Tsar Nicholas I confirmed a coat of arms for the Vilna Governorate that closely resembled the historical one. A notable change was the replacement of the Double-Cross of the Jagiellonians with the Patriarchal cross on the knight&#x27;s shield.

In 1905, the Great Seimas of Vilnius took place in Vilnius during which the decision to demand wide political autonomy of Lithuania within the Russian Empire was made. It was proposed by the Chairman of the Great Seimas of Vilnius Jonas Basanavičius to recognize the flag of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (a white horse rider on a red bottom) as the flag of Lithuania, but this proposal was rejected due to the negative associations of red color with the 1905 Russian Revolution.

=== 1915–1918 ===
The discussions on the national flag resumed during World War I. Following the German Empire occupation of Lithuania in September 1915, the Lithuanians gathered into committees and organizations of various currents, which united their representatives. According to the signatory of the Act of Independence of Lithuania of 16 February 1918 Petras Klimas, they considered the main problems of the reestablishment of Lithuania&#x27;s statehood, among which one of the main questions were the national colors and the national flag. Although, serious discussions about the Lithuanian state flag and coat of arms resumed only in 1917 when the real prospect of restoring the Lithuanian state emerged.

For the first time, according to Petras Klimas, a specific question of the national flag and national colors was raised at the Lithuanian intelligentsia Consortium Meeting of 6 June 1917 in the premises of the Lithuanian Scientific Society (the so-called Consortium Meeting united Lithuanian intellectuals in Vilnius, such as, Jonas Basanavičius, Povilas Dogelis, Petras Klimas, Jurgis Šaulys, Antanas Smetona, Mykolas Biržiška, Augustinas Janulaitis, Steponas Kairys, Aleksandras Stulginskis, Antanas Žmuidzinavičius). During this Consortium Meeting, Jonas Basanavičius read a report in which he proved that in the past the color of the Lithuanian flag was red and that on the red bottom was depicted a rider with a raised sword on a dapple-grey horse. Jonas Basanavičius suggested continuing this tradition and choosing this option as the flag of the reborn Lithuanian state. There was nobody who opposed it, however considerations began that such variant of the national flag does not solve the issue of the national colors, especially because a red flag without &quot;Vytis&quot; (&quot;Pogonia&quot;) could not be used.

As a result, new colors had to be chosen that could form a simple, everyday, easily sewn flag, which would be used alongside the historical flag of &#x27;. The members of this meeting established the principle according to which national colors had to be chosen: everyone agreed that it is necessary to choose such colors that are most often found in folk wares, ribbons, aprons, etc. Everyone agreed that such colors are green and red, therefore the task of harmonizing these colors in the flag was assigned to the artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius, however the searching for a color combination took a long time. Artist and archeologist Tadas Daugirdas&#x27;, who was invited as a consultant, combinations of the national flag colors varied from those proposed by Antanas Žmuidzinavičius. In general, a question of the number of colors arose as some demanded a green-red flag (such proposal was also supported by the Lithuanian Americans), while the others demanded a tricolor combination. Finding the third color was the most difficult task, even an exhibition of flag projects was held, however, the question was not solved until the Vilnius Conference of 1917, therefore a question of the national colors was included into the agenda of the Vilnius Conference.

During the preparation of the Vilnius Conference, which met in Vilnius and set out the guidelines for the restoration of Lithuania&#x27;s independence and elected the members of the Council of Lithuania, Antanas Žmuidzinavičius prepared a green-red Lithuanian flag project with whom the Vilnius City Theater Hall (present-day Old Theatre of Vilnius) was decorated. However, the flag proposed by Antanas Žmuidzinavičius seemed gloomy to the Vilnius Conference participants. Consequently, Tadas Daugirdas proposed the flag consisting of green at the top, white in the middle and red at the bottom, but he himself was not fond of such proposal as he preferred the green and red combination because these colors dominated in the Lithuanian cloths. Finally, Tadas Daugirdas proposed to include a narrow yellow line between the other two colors of green and red with the yellow color symbolizing dawn (the first national Lithuanian newspaper was also named &quot;Aušra&quot;) and rebirth (Lithuanian National Revival). Despite that, Antanas Žmuidzinavičius categorically defended the green and red flag as these colors symbolized love and hope, while the others demanded for a green (at the bottom; symbolizing green fields and meadows), yellow (at the middle; symbolizing yellow blossoms), and red (at the top; symbolizing the rising sun). As a result, the participants of the conference did not decide on the colors of the flag, therefore assigned this question to a commission formed by the Council of Lithuania that consisted of Jonas Basanavičius, Antanas Žmuidzinavičius, and Tadas Daugirdas.

On 16 February 1918, the Council of Lithuania declared the Independence of Lithuania and adopted Vytis as its coat of arms with the first drafts of the coat of arms being designed by Tadas Daugirdas and Antanas Žmuidzinavičius. On 19 April 1918, the commission accepted a Lithuanian flag project which consisted of three equal width horizontal lines of yellow, green, and red colors. On 25 April 1918, the Council of Lithuania unanimously approved this flag project as the Flag of the State of Lithuania. At the meeting of the same day, it was proposed to raise the tricolor flag of the Lithuanian state above the Tower of the Gediminas&#x27; Castle, which was done in the middle of 1918 after difficult negotiations with the German authorities.

Following the occupation of Vilnius by Soviet Russia, the Lithuanian institutions were evacuated to the temporary capital Kaunas in the first days of January 1919. In the temporary capital Kaunas, the historical flag of Lithuania was raised above the Presidential Palace, Palace of Seimas, and on top of the Tower of the Vytautas the Great War Museum (this historical flag was previously adopted by the Council of Lithuania and had a white horseman on a red bottom on one side and the Columns of Gediminas on the other side).

== Republic of Lithuania in the interwar period ==
When Lithuania restored its independence in 1918–1920, several artists produced updated versions of the coat of arms. Almost all included a scabbard, which is not found in its earliest historical versions. A romanticized version by Antanas Žemaitis became the most popular. The horse appeared to be flying through the air (&quot;courant&quot;). The gear was very ornate. For example, the saddle blanket was very long and divided into three parts. There was no uniform or official version of the coat of arms. To address popular complaints, in 1929 a special commission was set up to analyze the best 16th-century specimens of Vytis to design an official state emblem. Mstislav Dobuzhinsky was the chief artist. The commission worked for 5 years, but its version was never officially confirmed. Meanwhile, a design by Juozas Zikaras was introduced for official use on Lithuanian coins.

The Columns of the Gediminids and the Double Cross of the Jagiellonians were particularly widely used in the first half of the 20th century following the restoration of the independent state of Lithuania on 16 February 1918. These symbols, as a distinctive sign, were adopted by the Lithuanian Land Forces, Lithuanian Air Force, and other public authorities. It was used to decorate Lithuanian coins, banknotes orders, medals, and insignias and became an attribute of numerous public societies and organizations. To commemorate the 500th anniversary of the death of Grand Duke Vytautas the Great, flags decorated with the Columns of the Gediminids were hoisted in Lithuanian cities and towns in 1930. Moreover, in his honor, a Lithuanian state award was instituted in the same year – Order of Vytautas the Great, which was awarded for distinguished services to the State of Lithuania and since 1991 is still conferred nowadays.
In 1919, the Double Cross of the Jagiellonians was named the Cross for Homeland and was featured on one of the highest-ranking Lithuanian state decorations – Order of the Cross of Vytis, which was awarded for acts of bravery performed in defending the freedom and independence of Lithuania (the order was abolished following the occupations of Lithuania, but was re-established in 1991). According to a presidential decree of 3 February 1920, issued by the President of Lithuania Antanas Smetona, the Cross for Homeland was renamed to the Cross of Vytis. In 1928, the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas was instituted and was awarded to the citizens of Lithuania for outstanding performance in civil and public offices (it was also abolished following the occupations of Lithuania, but was re-established in 1991).

Vytis was the state emblem of the Republic of Lithuania until 1940 when the Republic was occupied by the Soviet Union and national symbols were suppressed, those who still displayed them received severe punishments. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Vytis, together with the Columns of Gediminas and the national flag, became symbols of the independence movement in Lithuania. In 1988, Lithuania&#x27;s Soviet authorities legalized the public display of .

== Republic of Lithuania in the post-Cold War era ==

On March 11, 1990, Lithuania declared its independence and restored all of its pre-war national symbols, including its historic coat of arms &quot;Vytis&quot;. On March 20, 1990, the Supreme Council of Lithuania approved the description of the State&#x27;s coat of arms and determined the principal regulations for its use. The design was based on Juozas Zikaras&#x27; version. This was to demonstrate that Lithuania was resuming the traditions of the state that existed between 1918–1940. Later on 10 April, the Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas adopted the &quot;Law on the National Coat of Arms, Emblems, and Other Insignias of the Republic of Lithuania&quot;, which regulates the usage of the Lithuanian national coat of arms Vytis and the historical national symbols of Lithuania. According to the 6th article of this Law, the historical national symbols of Lithuania are the Double Cross of the Jagiellonians and Columns of Gediminas.

On September 4, 1991, a new design by Arvydas Každailis was approved based on the recommendations of a special Lithuanian Heraldry Commission. It abandoned romantic interwar interpretations, harkening back to the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Nevertheless, it re-established the original colors and metals (red, blue, silver, and gold), dating to the reign of Grand Duke Vytautas the Great, but placed the horse and rider in an ostensibly more &quot;defensive&quot; posture, airs above the ground, rather than leaping forward and sword simply elevated rather than poised to strike. The revival of historical colors and the historical coat of arms &#x27; meant that the Republic of Lithuania is not only the heir and follower of the traditions of statehood of independent Lithuania of 1918–40, but also of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania, adopted by citizens of the Republic of Lithuania in the Constitutional Referendum of 25 October 1992, states that the Coat of Arms of the State shall be a white &quot;Vytis&quot; on a red field. Despite the newly adopted Každailis&#x27; variant of &#x27;, the Lithuanian litas coins featured Zikaras&#x27; design until they were replaced by the euro in 2015.

The coats of arms of Lithuania are widely used by the Lithuanian Armed Forces on uniforms, badges, and flags.
In 2004, Lithuania&#x27;s Seimas confirmed a new variant of the &quot;Vytis&quot; on the historical flag of Lithuania, the final design was approved on 17 June 2010. It is depicted on a rectangular red fabric, recalling the old battle flags of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The flag does not replace the yellow-green-red tri-color national flag of Lithuania and it is used on special occasions, anniversaries, and buildings of historical significance (e.g. Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, Trakai Island Castle, Medininkai Castle).

It is currently proposed that a greater version of the coat of arms be adopted. It would feature a line from &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot;, the national anthem of Lithuania, &quot;&quot; (&quot;May unity blossom&quot;). The Seimas already uses a larger version of the coat of arms with this phrase as its motto, along with two supporters: the dexter one a griffin argent beaked and membered or, langued gules, and the sinister one a unicorn argent, armed and unguled or, langued gules, and the ducal hat on top of the shield.
The President of Lithuania uses the circular seal and document forms with the coat of arms of Lithuania, the seal has a text &quot;&quot;.

Lithuania joined the Eurozone by adopting the euro on 1 January 2015. The designs of Lithuanian euro coins share a similar national side for all denominations, featuring the &quot;Vytis&quot; and the country&#x27;s name in Lithuanian – &quot;Lietuva&quot;. The design was announced on 11 November 2004 following a public opinion poll conducted by the Bank of Lithuania. The horse is again leaping forward, as in more traditional versions.

The Kaunas Castle unveiled the Freedom Warrior monument on 14 July 2018, which features a graphical representation of &quot;Vytis&quot;. It was created by Lithuanian artist Arūnas Sakalauskas and Ukrainian artists Boris Krylov and Olesius Sidoruk in Kyiv, Ukraine.

Gintautas Genys released a three-tomes historical adventure novel book &quot;&quot; (), which analyzes different periods of the history of Lithuania: the first tome, released in 2012, is about the last decade of the 18th century (close to the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), the second tome, released in 2014, presents the vision of the restoration of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the sticky web of intrigues and conflicts of the monarchs of France, Russia, and Prussia, while the third tome, released in 2019, presents the course of the history of Russia, Poland, and Lithuania from the 1810s to 1860s, consistently and vividly reveals the terrible drama of mutual relations between them.

In 2023, Lithuanian vehicle registration plates design was modified to include &quot;Vytis&quot;.

== Related and similar coats of arms ==
===Lithuania===

Recently adopted coats of arms of Vilnius and Panevėžys counties use different color schemes and add additional details to the basic image of the knight. Several towns in Lithuania use motifs similar to Vytis. For example, the coat of arms of Liudvinavas is parted per pale. One half depicts the Vytis and the other, Lady Justice.

===Poland===

As Lithuania and Poland were closely related for centuries, especially during the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth period, the Lithuanian coat of arms was also depicted in Poland.

===Belarus===
The Belarusian lands had been part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since the Middle Ages, so the Lithuanian coat of arms grew into the local heraldic tradition and was used in the coats of arms of Belarusian towns and administrative districts, even during Russian rule. Thus, Belarusian nationalists who claimed that the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was part of a Belarusian statehood tradition adopted Lithuania&#x27;s coat of arms as the Belarusian national emblem during the period of national revival in 1918. Pahonia (&quot;Пагоня&quot;, ultimately from &quot;Pogonia&quot;) is the Belarusian version of the coat of arms of Lithuania, also depicting an armed white horseman on a red background. However, in the Belarusian version, the two-barred cross depicted on the horseman&#x27;s shild has uneven bars, the saddle blanket is in the Renaissance style, the horse&#x27;s tail points down instead of up, and azure is absent from it altogether.

Pahonia was chosen by the founders of the short-lived Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic as the state emblem. During 1918 to 1923, it was used by the military units of the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic, as well as those formed within the Lithuanian and Polish armies. Subsequently, it was used in this role by Belarusians residing in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and other countries in the interwar period.

During the Second World War, under German occupation Belarusians displayed Pahonia, it was used by collaborationist organisation, such as Belarusian People&#x27;s Self-Help (BNS). They were also used by the Belarusian Central Council. During the Soviet period, the Pahonia coat of arms was banned and its possession was punishable by imprisonment. Soviet propaganda defamed Belarusian national symbols as being used by &quot;Nazi collaborators&quot;. However, the coat of arms was used freely by Belarusian organisations in the West.

The white–red–white flag and Pahonia were yet again adopted upon proclaiming of Belarus&#x27; independence in 1991. Soon after the 1994 Belarusian presidential election, the Belarusians voted for the introduction of a modified version of the Soviet flag and emblem in a 1995 referendum, initiated by President Alexander Lukashenko, and abolished &quot;Pahonia&quot; as an official symbol. However, Lukashenko still signed decrees to incorporate similar symbols into several reginal flags and coats of arms as in Gomel Region and Vitsebsk Region, and the previous national symbols continued to be used by the Belarusian opposition and gained exceptional popularity among the Belarusians during the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests.

===Ukraine===
The horseman was featured on the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, on the Seal of King Yuri II Boleslav with the Ruthenian lion on the coat of arms, on the Mykhailo Hrushevsky&#x27;s proposal of the coat of arms of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, and other Ukrainian coats of arms.

===Russia===
Due to historical connections with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (and later Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), some Russian regions adopted Lithuanian coat of arms from the Russian Empire period. After the dissolution of the USSR, such coats of arms were restored.
===Noble families===
The Lithuanian coat of arms with some modifications was adopted by several Gediminid Lithuanian, Polish and Russian noble families, namely Czartoryski, Sanguszko, Chowanski, Trubetskoy and Golitsyn. In Polish heraldry, those coat of arms are called &quot;Pogoń Litewska&quot;.

<text>The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) is an intergovernmental agency that is organized under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Originally formed on 1 February 1958 with the name European Nuclear Energy Agency (ENEA)—the United States participated as an Associate Member—the name was changed on 20 April 1972 to its current name after Japan became a member.

The mission of the NEA is to &quot;assist its member countries in maintaining and further developing, through international co-operation, the scientific, technological and legal bases required for the safe, environmentally friendly and economical use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.&quot;

== History ==
The creation of the European Nuclear Energy Agency (ENEA) was agreed by the OEEC Council of Ministers on December 20, 1957.

== Members ==
NEA currently consists of 33 countries from Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2021, Bulgaria accessioned to NEA as its most recent member. In 2022, following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, Russia&#x27;s membership was suspended.

Together they account for approximately 85% of the world&#x27;s installed nuclear capacity. Nuclear power accounts for almost a quarter of the electricity produced in NEA Member countries. The NEA works closely with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna and with the European Commission in Brussels.

Within the OECD, there is close co-ordination with the International Energy Agency and the Environment Directorate, as well as contacts with other directorates, as appropriate.

== Areas of work ==

* Nuclear safety and regulation
* Nuclear energy development
* Radioactive waste management
* Radiation protection and public health
* Nuclear law and liability
* Nuclear science
* Data bank
* Information and communication
* European Nuclear Energy Tribunal

== Structure ==

Since 1 September 2014, the Director-General of the NEA is William D Magwood, IV, who replaced Luis E. Echávarri on this post. The NEA Secretariat serves seven specialised standing technical committees under the leadership of the Steering Committee for Nuclear Energy—the governing body of the NEA—which reports directly to the OECD Council.

The standing technical committees, representing each of the seven major areas of the Agency&#x27;s programme, are composed of member country experts who are both contributors to the programme of work and beneficiaries of its results. The approach is highly cost-efficient as it enables the Agency to pursue an ambitious programme with a relatively small staff that co-ordinates the work. The substantive value of the standing technical committees arises from the numerous important functions they perform, including: providing a forum for in-depth exchanges of technical and programmatic information; stimulating development of useful information by initiating and carrying out co-operation/research on key problems; developing common positions, including &quot;consensus opinions&quot;, on technical and policy issues; identifying areas where further work is needed and ensuring that NEA activities respond to real needs; organising joint projects to enable interested countries to carry out research on particular issues on a cost-sharing basis.

== NEA Annual Report ==
The NEA Annual Report, issued in English and French, is a definitive guide to the agency&#x27;s yearly undertakings, major publications, and the evolving global nuclear energy sector. It aims to equip governments, stakeholders, and industry specialists with in-depth analysis and foresight on nuclear technology developments.

The 2022 edition highlights that there were 423 nuclear reactors in operation worldwide, providing a total of 379 GWe. NEA member countries manage 312 of these reactors, constituting roughly 80% of the global capacity. Additionally, the year witnessed the grid connection of six new reactors, contributing 7,360 MWe, and the construction of 57 reactors, reflecting a dynamic and expanding nuclear industry.

<doc id="595610" wikidata="Q940037" url="?curid=595610" title="Emperor Wu of Southern Qi">
<text>Emperor Wu of Southern Qi (南齊武帝) (440– 27 August 493), personal name Xiao Ze (蕭賾), courtesy name Xuanyuan (宣遠), childhood name Long&#x27;er (龍兒), was the second emperor of the Chinese Southern Qi dynasty. He is generally considered to be an able and diligent emperor, although he is also criticized for leading a lavish lifestyle.

== Background ==

Xiao Ze was born in the Liu Song capital Jiankang in 440, when his father Xiao Daocheng was just 13 years old. He was the oldest son of his father, and his mother Liu Zhirong was Xiao Daocheng&#x27;s wife.

By 466, when Xiao Daocheng was a Liu Song general, Xiao Ze was a county magistrate at Gan County (贛縣, in modern Ganzhou, Jiangsi), when he was stuck in the civil war between Emperor Ming, whose claim his father Xiao Daocheng supported, and Emperor Ming&#x27;s nephew Liu Zixun, who also claimed the throne. Because of Xiao Daocheng&#x27;s support for Emperor Ming, Xiao Ze, who was deep in the territory controlled by Liu Zixun, was arrested and imprisoned. His associate Huan Kang () fled with Xiao Ze&#x27;s wife Pei Huizhao and his two sons Xiao Zhangmao and Xiao Ziliang (), and then organized some 100 people, along with Xiao Ze&#x27;s distant relative Xiao Xinzu (), to make a surprise attack on Gan and rescue Xiao Ze. Xiao Ze then started an uprising at Gan against Liu Zixun. After Liu Zixun was defeated later that year, for Xiao Ze&#x27;s contributions, Emperor Ming created him the Viscount of Gan, but he declined.

In 477, after Xiao Daocheng assassinated Emperor Ming&#x27;s violent and arbitrary son and successor Emperor Houfei, the general Shen Youzhi, from his base of Jing Province (荊州, modern central and western Hubei), started a campaign against Xiao Daocheng. At that time, Xiao Ze, who had just previously been the chief of staff for Emperor Houfei&#x27;s brother Liu Xie () the governor of Ying Province (郢州, modern eastern Hubei), was returning to Jiankang with Liu Xie. He had reached Xunyang (尋陽, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi) when news of Shen&#x27;s uprising arrived. His associates all recommending speeding back to the capital Jiankang, but Xiao Ze instead took up defense position at Pencou (湓口, also in modern Jiujiang) to block the Yangtze River in anticipation of Shen&#x27;s advancing east. When Xiao Daocheng received Xiao Ze&#x27;s report, he gladly stated, &quot;He is really my son!&quot; (As it turned out, the defense was not needed, as Shen became mired in his siege of Yingcheng (郢城, in modern Wuhan, Hubei), and eventually his forces collapsed when he could not capture Yingcheng quickly, but Xiao Ze&#x27;s tactical setup would have provided additional difficulty for Shen had he advanced further.) Xiao Ze was subsequently created the Marquess of Wenxi, and then the Duke of Wenxi, as his father progressed toward taking the throne. In 479, after Xiao Daocheng took the throne from Emperor Shun, ending Liu Song and establishing Southern Qi as its Emperor Gao, Xiao Ze was created the crown prince.

== As crown prince ==

As crown prince, Xiao Ze was often involved in the important matters of state. In 479, for example, when the official Xie Duo () publicly displayed refusal to submit to Emperor Gao after he took the throne, Xiao Ze suggested that Emperor Gao execute Xie to warn others, but Emperor Gao refused, instead finding another excuse to remove Xie.

In 480, Xiao Ze&#x27;s wife, Crown Princess Pei Huizhao, died. He would not have a wife after that point, although he had a multitude of concubines.

Because Xiao Ze was only 13 years younger than his father Emperor Gao, and he felt that he contributed greatly to the establishment of Southern Qi, he often interjected himself into governmental matters, and he often used items that were properly only usable by the emperor. He also trusted his jester Zhang Jingzhen (), who was so luxurious in his lifestyle to be like an emperor. When the official Xun Boyu () reported this to Emperor Gao while Xiao Ze happened to be away from the capital Jiankang to worship the ancestors, Emperor Gao was enraged. Xiao Ze&#x27;s brother Xiao Ni the Prince of Yuzhang found this out and quickly rode on a horse to personally warn Xiao Ze. Xiao Ze quickly returned to Jiankang, and the next day, Emperor Gao sent Xiao Ze&#x27;s two sons, Xiao Zhangmao the Prince of Nan Commandery and Xiao Ziliang the Duke of Wenxi, to rebuke Xiao Ze for him and to order Zhang put to death in Xiao Ze&#x27;s name. It took about a month for Emperor Gao&#x27;s furor to subside, after a feast organized by the official Wang Jingze () at the crown prince&#x27;s palace. For some time, however, Emperor Gao considered replacing Xiao Ze as crown prince with Xiao Ni, but because Xiao Ni continued to serve his brother faithfully and carefully, their brotherly relations were not affected.

In 482, Emperor Gao died, and Xiao Ze took the throne as Emperor Wu.

== Early reign ==
Immediately after taking the throne, Emperor Wu posthumously honored his wife Crown Princess Pei as Empress Mu, and he created his oldest son (by her) Xiao Zhangmao crown prince. He also allowed a number of late-Liu Song officials who had opposed or been opposed by Emperor Gao, including Shen Youzhi, Yuan Can, Liu Bing, and Liu Jingsu (), to be reburied with proper honors, reasoning that they were faithful officials who deserved recognition. He largely handed important governmental matters himself, while having Wang Jian, Wang Yan (), his brother Xiao Ni, and his son Xiao Ziliang as the key advisors. However, his associates Lü Wendu (), Ru Faliang (), and Lü Wenxian () were also powerful behind the scenes.

In 483, in what is considered a major blot on his record, Emperor Wu, still resentful that Xun Boyu had informed Emperor Gao of his misbehavior, had Xun and the general Yuan Chongzu (), whom he suspected of the same and who was a friend of Xun&#x27;s, put to death under false accusations of treason. He also put to death the ambitious general Zhang Jing&#x27;er () and the official Xie Chaozong ().

In 485, displeased that Li Shuxian () the governor of Jiao Province (交州, modern northern Vietnam) had been nominally submissive but had actually acted independently, Emperor Wu sent the general Liu Kai () to attack Li. Li, in fear, fled back to Jiankang in submission. Later that year, Emperor Wu reestablished the national university and merged the imperial research facility &quot;Zongmingguan&quot; () into it, having Wang Jian as its head.

In late 485, with the people fearful that Emperor Wu was using a new census bureau to discover cases of tax fraud and prosecute them, Tang Yuzhi () rose in Fuyang and captured a number of commanderies, claiming imperial title in spring 486. His rebellion was, however, soon suppressed.

In 487, the migrant Huan Tiansheng (), who claimed to be a descendant of Huan Xuan, rose in Nanyang, with aid from Northern Wei. However, after several months, he was defeated.

== Late reign ==
In 490, in response to peace overtures that Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei made, Emperor Wu made peace with Northern Wei.

In fall 490, Emperor Wu&#x27;s son Xiao Zixiang () the Prince of Badong and governor of Jing Province, who had been interested in military matters, was accused of making improper trades of weapon with barbarian tribes. His staff members secretly informed Emperor Wu of this, and when Xiao Zixiang learned of this, he killed the staff members who reported on him. In response, Emperor Wu sent a small detachment of soldiers under the command of general Hu Xiezhi (), to force Xiao Zixiang to give up his post and return to Jiankang to receive punishment. Hu, however, mishandled the situation as he refused all attempts by Xiao Zixiang to surrender, forcing Xiao Zixiang to engage him in battle and defeat him. Xiao Zixiang subsequently tried to head to Jiankang alone to confess his guilt, but on the way, he was intercepted by the general Xiao Shunzhi (), whom Crown Prince Zhangmao, who was fearful of Xiao Zixiang, had secretly instructed to find someway to have Xiao Zixiang killed, and Xiao Shunzhi strangled Xiao Zixiang to death. Emperor Wu, while mourning Xiao Zixiang, publicly declared his guilt and posthumously demoted him to marquess.

In 491, in contravention with the traditional Confucian ceremonies of ancestral worship, Emperor Wu ordered that his parents (Emperor Gao and his wife Liu Zhirong) and grandparents (Emperor Gao&#x27;s father Xiao Chengzhi () and mother Chen Daozhi () make offerings, for sacrificial purposes, items that they favored as foods, rather than the Confucian requirement of sacrificing one pig, one cow, and one goat each. The items offered those ancestors, instead, were:

* Emperor Gao: ground pork sauce, pickled vegetable soup
* Liu Zhirong: green tea, fried dough strips, grilled fish
* Xiao Chengzhi: leavened bread, duck porridge
* Chen Daozhi: young bamboo shoots, duck eggs

Emperor Wu was heavily criticized by Confucian scholars for disobeying tradition (particularly because he also commissioned his sister-in-law, Xiao Ni&#x27;s wife Princess Yu, to be in charge of the ancestral worship), but this act appeared to show quite a bit of humanity in his relationship with his parents and grandparents.

Also in 491, a project that Emperor Wu commissioned in 489—the revision of the penal statutes to eliminate contradictory provisions in the statutes written by the Jin officials Zhang Fei () and Du Yu—was completed, which greatly eliminated arbitrary and unfair enforcement of the laws. However, while Emperor Wu also ordered that the national university add a department for legal studies to eliminate the issue where officials were not familiar with penal laws, the order was not actually carried out.

In 493, Crown Prince Zhangmao, to whom Emperor Wu had delegated part of imperial authority late in his reign, died. Emperor Wu created Crown Prince Zhangmao&#x27;s son, Xiao Zhaoye the Prince of Nan Commandery, as crown prince to replace his father. Later that year, he died, and while there was initially an attempt by the official Wang Rong () to have Xiao Ziliang made emperor instead, Xiao Zhaoye took the throne to succeed Emperor Wu.

The Liang Dynasty historian Xiao Zixian (Emperor Wu&#x27;s nephew), in his &quot;Book of Qi&quot;, had these comments about Emperor Wu:

:&quot;When Shizu [Emperor Wu&#x27;s temple name] reigned, he was attentive to the important matters of state, oversaw what was important, was strict and intelligent, and resolute and decisive. He gave his commandery governors and county magistrate long office terms, and if their subordinates violated the law, he would send the imperial swords to the governors or magistrates to have them carry out the capital punishments. Therefore, during his era of &quot;Yongming&quot;, the people were rich and peaceful, and there was little crime. However, he also favored feasting and gaming, and while he expressed displeasure at luxuries and wastefulness, he could not avoid them himself.&quot;

<text>Emperor Gao of Southern Qi ((南)齊高帝; 427– 11 April 482), personal name Xiao Daocheng (蕭道成), courtesy name Shaobo (紹伯), childhood name Doujiang (鬥將), was the founding emperor of the Southern Qi dynasty of China. He served as a general under the preceding dynasty Liu Song&#x27;s Emperor Ming and Emperor Houfei. In 477, fearful that the young, cruel Emperor Houfei would kill him, he assassinated Emperor Houfei and seized power, eventually taking the throne in 479 to start Southern Qi.

== Background ==

Xiao Daocheng was born in 427. His ancestors traced their line to the famed Western Han dynasty chancellor Xiao He. If their records were accurate, Xiao Daocheng was Xiao He&#x27;s 24-generation descendant. During the Jin and Liu Song dynasties, Xiao&#x27;s ancestors served as low-level officials. His father Xiao Chengzhi () was a general under Emperor Wen of Song, and for his contributions in campaigns against rival Northern Wei was created the Baron of Jinxing. Xiao Daocheng first studied the Confucian classics at the imperial university set up by Emperor Wen and headed by the hermit and scholar Lei Cizong (:zh:雷次宗) when he was 12, but by age 15 he was serving in the military. He continued serving as a military officer during the reigns of Emperors Wen and Xiaowu (Emperor Wen&#x27;s son).

== Under Emperor Ming of Liu Song ==
By the time that Emperor Xiaowu&#x27;s brother Emperor Ming and Emperor Xiaowu&#x27;s son Liu Zixun were fighting for the throne in 466 after the brief reign and assassination of Emperor Xiaowu&#x27;s son Emperor Qianfei, Xiao Daocheng was a general, and his allegiance was with Emperor Ming. He participated in the campaign against the army nominally commanded by Liu Zixun&#x27;s brother Liu Zifang () the Prince of Xunyang and governor of Kuaiji Commandery along the southern shore of Hangzhou Bay. He subsequently defeated the army sent south by Xue Andu () the governor of Xu Province (徐州, modern northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui). For these contributions, Emperor Ming created him the Marquess of Xiyang and made him the acting governor of South Xu Province (南徐州, modern western central Jiangsu). Later, he became the governor of Southern Yan Province (南兗州, modern eastern central Jiangsu), defending the important city of Huaiyin (淮陰, in modern Huaian, Jiangsu). It was said that, while at this post, he began to engage a group of talented followers.

During Emperor Ming&#x27;s reign, there were rumors that Xiao Daocheng&#x27;s facial features were unusual and were signs that he would become emperor. By 471, Emperor Ming – who had already carried out a campaign of killing most of his brothers and some high-level officials in fear that they would not be loyal to his son Liu Yu the Crown Prince after his death – became suspicious of Xiao, particularly because there were rumors that Xiao was secretly communicating with Northern Wei. Emperor Ming sent his general Wu Xi (), a friend of Xiao&#x27;s, with a sealed pot of wine to Huaiyin to deliver to Xiao. Xiao became fearful that the wine was poisoned and was preparing to flee to Northern Wei. Wu secretly told Xiao that the wine was not poisoned and drank some himself, before Xiao would dare to drink.

Once Wu returned to the capital Jiankang, he assured Emperor Ming that Xiao was loyal. But after details of Wu&#x27;s leaking the information to Xiao became known to Emperor Ming, Emperor Ming forced Wu to commit suicide; he did not take any actions against Xiao. Soon thereafter he recalled Xiao to Jiankang. Xiao&#x27;s followers largely suspected that Emperor Ming would kill him and suggested that he resist, but Xiao believed that Emperor Ming would not do so. He therefore returned to Jiankang, where he became a commanding general of Crown Prince Yu&#x27;s guards. (In secret, Xiao told his followers that he believed that Liu Song would not last much longer and that he would need their support when opportunity presented itself.) When Emperor Ming grew gravely ill in 472, on the recommendation of the high-level official Chu Yuan (to whom, along with Yuan Can, Emperor Ming entrusted the care of Crown Prince Yu), who was a friend of Xiao, Xiao became a commanding general of the capital defense force. Emperor Ming soon died, and Crown Prince Yu took the throne as Emperor Houfei.

== Under Emperor Houfei of Liu Song ==
In 474, Emperor Houfei&#x27;s uncle Liu Xiufan () the Prince of Guiyang and governor of Jiang Province (江州, modern Jiangxi and Fujian), angry that he had not been made the regent, rebelled and made a quick advancement toward Jiankang. At a major military strategy session, although there were a number of high-level officials, powerful associates of the emperor, and senior generals present, no one dared to speak first. Then Xiao Daocheng proposed the strategy of not sending an army to engage Liu Xiufan but rather defend the strong defensive posts in the outskirts of Jiankang and not actively engage Liu Xiufan, forcing him into a stalemate and causing him to run out of food supplies. Without significant opposition, Xiao&#x27;s plan was adopted.

Liu Xiufan&#x27;s forces soon arrived. He made a direct assault against Xiao&#x27;s defensive position. With Xiao&#x27;s approval, his officers Huang Hui () and Zhang Jing&#x27;er () falsely surrendered to Liu Xiufan and then further informed Liu Xiufan that Xiao wished to surrender as well. While pretending to secretly convey the information, Zhang and Huang then assassinated Liu Xiufan. However, because they had to then discard Liu Xiufan&#x27;s head to avoid Liu Xiufan&#x27;s guards, the news was not known initially. Liu Xiufan&#x27;s forces intensified their siege against the various defense positions. Xiao was barely able to hold his position, but Liu Xiufan&#x27;s general Ding Wenhao () was able to defeat and kill Liu Mian () and Wang Daolong () and put the palace under siege. Soon, news of Liu Xiufan&#x27;s death became gradually known, and Ding&#x27;s forces collapsed.

In the aftermaths of Liu Xiufan&#x27;s defeat, Xiao was promoted. He, with Yuan Can, Chu Yuan, and Emperor Houfan&#x27;s distant uncle Liu Bing, were in charge of the affairs of government and known as the &quot;four nobles&quot; (). In 476, when Emperor Houfei&#x27;s cousin Liu Jingsu () the governor of South Xu Province, who received wrong information that Jiankang had fallen into a state of confusion, started a rebellion, Xiao coordinated the campaign against Liu Jingsu (although he did not personally command troops), and Liu Jingsu was defeated and killed.

In 477, Emperor Houfei, by now age 14, was growing increasingly impulsive and violent, often wandering outside the palace with his guards and killing all people or animals they encountered. One day, he suddenly charged into Xiao&#x27;s headquarters and saw Xiao sleeping naked. He was intrigued by the large size of Xiao&#x27;s belly. He woke Xiao up, drew a target on Xiao&#x27;s belly, and prepared to shoot him with arrows. Xiao pleaded for his life, and Emperor Houfei&#x27;s attendant Wang Tian&#x27;en () pointed out that if he killed Xiao with an arrow, he would lose Xiao&#x27;s belly as a wonderful target. So, at Wang&#x27;s suggestion, Emperor Houfei shot Xiao with bone-made round-point arrows and was pleased when he was able to target Xiao&#x27;s bellybutton successfully. Xiao became fearful after the incident; he initially discussed with Yuan and Chu the possibilities of deposing the emperor but could not get them to go along with his plan. Xiao therefore acted on his own, associating with Emperor Houfei&#x27;s attendants and eventually getting one of them, Yang Yufu (), to kill Emperor Houfei while Emperor Houfei was asleep. Xiao then forced Yuan and Liu Bing to effectively grant him near-imperial powers, leading to concerns that Xiao would next take the throne.

== Under Emperor Shun of Liu Song ==
Xiao Daocheng made Emperor Houfei&#x27;s brother Liu Zhun the Prince of Ancheng emperor (as Emperor Shun). In response, the general Shen Youzhi arose with the troops of his Jing Province (荊州, modern central and western Hubei), accusing Xiao of wanting to usurp the throne. Yuan Can and Liu Bing also believed that that was Xiao&#x27;s intent. As Xiao prepared for a campaign against Shen, they secretly planned another uprising within Jiankang to overthrow Xiao. Yuan, believing that the plot would not succeed without Chu Yuan&#x27;s support, told Chu of the plot as well. Chu, who was friendly with Xiao, quickly informed Xiao. Yuan, not aware of this, continued his preparations, aligning with a number of generals and preparing to rise. However, Liu Bing panicked during the preparation stage and fled to Yuan&#x27;s defense post at the fortress of Shitou Cheng several hours before the scheduled time, alarming Xiao and allowing him to further start a counterinsurrection, arresting and killing several generals aligned with Yuan and Liu Bing before they could act. Xiao&#x27;s troops then besieged Yuan&#x27;s defenses at Shitou, killing Yuan and Liu Bing.

Meanwhile, the provincial governors whom Shen invited to join him all declined and either resisted him or stood by. Shen nevertheless had a strong army, and the imperial army generals were apprehensive about facing him. He initially progressed quickly toward Jiankang. But as he went past Yingcheng (郢城, in modern Wuhan, Hubei), he was provoked by insults of Liu Shilong (), the chief of staff for Liu Zan () the Prince of Wuling and governor of Ying Province into stopping and putting the well-fortified Yingcheng under siege.

In 478, with his forces unable to capture Yingcheng, Shen Youzhi&#x27;s soldiers began to desert. Shen aggravated the situation by imposing severe punishments on the commanding officers of deserting soldiers — which caused &quot;them&quot; to desert. Shen&#x27;s officer Liu Rangbing () surrendered to Liu Shilong, causing his forces to collapse. Shen tried to retreat to Jiangling (the capital of Jing Province). By the time he did so, Zhang Jing&#x27;er, whom Xiao had made the governor of Yong Province (雍州, modern southwestern Henan and southwestern Hubei) with the intent of having him attack Shen from the rear, had already captured Jiangling and killed Shen Yuanyan, whom Shen Youzhi had left in charge of Jiangling. Shen&#x27;s remaining army, seeing that Jiangling had fallen, collapsed, and he initially tried to flee, but realizing that his escape route had been cut off he committed suicide. Xiao was now without substantial opposition, particularly after he killed Huang Hui, who had been implicated in conspiracies with Liu Jingsu and Yuan Can, later that year after Huang showed signs of insubordination. He began to put his sons into important posts as well. He also engaged the nobly born official Wang Jian as a key assistant and, with Chu&#x27;s tacit agreement, started making moves toward the throne, including quietly assassinating Emperor Houfei&#x27;s brothers. In 479, over a brief two months, he had Emperor Shun create him the Duke of Qi, and then the Prince of Qi, and bestow upon him the nine bestowments, all progressive steps toward the throne. In summer 479, he forced the fearful Emperor Shun into yielding the throne to him, ending Liu Song and starting Southern Qi, as its Emperor Gao.

== Reign ==

A major trend that Emperor Gao tried to start after he took the throne was a move against wastefulness and luxury and a move toward frugality. He appeared to be fairly frugal, although the effects his edicts on those subjects had on his officials and nobles are unclear.

Later in 479, when someone was riding a horse near the mansion of the former Emperor Shun (now the Prince of Ruyin), the guards whom Emperor Gao posted to watch over the former emperor panicked, believing someone was about to start a rebellion. They killed the former emperor. Emperor Gao did not punish these guards, but rewarded them and further carried out a massacre of Liu Song&#x27;s imperial clan. Later that year, he made princes of his son Xiao Ze (who had by that point been known as an able general, now crown prince), his other sons, as well as Xiao Ze&#x27;s oldest son Xiao Zhangmao.

Meanwhile, Emperor Gao received reports that Northern Wei was about to make an attack and claim to be trying to reestablish Liu Song on the behalf of Liu Chang () the Prince of Danyang, a son of Liu Song&#x27;s Emperor Wen who had in 465 fled to Northern Wei over fears that Emperor Qianfei would kill him. Emperor Gao prepared the northern borders in anticipation of a major attack, which Northern Wei launched in winter 479. The Northern Wei attack ended, however, after Northern Wei forces made a failed siege of Shouyang. Realizing that Jiankang was relatively defenseless (as throughout Jin and Liu Song, a wall had never been built around Jiankang), he started a construction project to build a wall around Jiankang. Northern Wei and Southern Qi forces would continue to have minor border battles for another year, until spring 481, but there would be no further major campaigns by either side.

In spring 482, Emperor Gao died. Crown Prince Ze succeeded him as Emperor Wu.

<text>Lake Valencia (), formerly Lake Tacarigua, is a lake within Carabobo State and Aragua State in northern Venezuela.

==Geography==
Lake Valencia is the third largest lake in Venezuela, after Lake Maracaibo and Lake Guri reservoir.

The lake is located in one of the Aragua valleys, between the parallel sub-Serranía del Interior in the Cordillera de la Costa Central, of the Venezuelan Coastal Ranges system.

The endorheic lake has natural discharge level at 427 m above sea level; the water level declined below this height about 250 years ago. Its surface level currently is 410 m above sea level, and is about 30 km long, has an area of 350 km2. The maximum depth is 39 m, the mean depth 18 m. The lake has a number of small islands, with some inhabited.

Its drainage basin (watershed area) of 2,646 km2. The most important river emptying into the lake is the Aragua River. Others include the El Limón River, Guacara River, Güigüe River, Mariara River and Turmero River, which flow through or near their respective cities, El Limón, Guacara, Güigüe, Mariara and Turmero.

==History==
The lake was formed approximately 2–3 million years ago due to faulting and subsequent damming of the Cabriales River. The lake has been completely dry during several discrete periods of its geologic history.

Alexander von Humboldt visited the lake in 1800. He documented the negative impact of the surrounding population&#x27;s land cultivation on the ecosystem. Deforestation and water diversion for irrigation led to the desiccation of Lake Valencia by dramatically reducing water levels. Lake Valencia is where Humboldt developed his conception of anthropogenic climate change. He later wrote:When forests are destroyed, as they are everywhere in America by the European planters, with an imprudent precipitation, the springs are entirely dried up, or become less abundant, The beds of the rivers remaining dry during a part of the year, are converted into torrents, whenever great rains fall on the heights. The sward and moss disappearing from the brush-wood on the sides of the mountains, the waters falling in rain are no longer impeded in their course: and instead of slowly augmenting the level of the rivers by progressive filtrations, they furrow during heavy showers the sides of the hills, bear down the loose soil, and form those sudden inundations that devastate the country.Since 1976, the water levels in Lake Valencia have risen due to diversion of water from neighboring drainage basins—it currently acts as a reservoir for the surrounding urban centers (such as Maracay and Valencia).

==Ecology==
The lake suffers from algal blooms caused by continual influx of untreated wastewater from the surrounding urban, agricultural, and industrial land uses. This contributes to ongoing eutrophication, contamination, and salinization of the lake.

Despite its picturesque location between the Cordillera de la Costa to the north and the Serrania del Interior to the south, Lake Valencia&#x27;s poor water quality limits opportunities for tourism and recreational activities. Due to pollution and other human induced changes, almost 60% of the native fish species in the lake were lost between 1960 and 1990. Among the fish in the lake is the diamond tetra, which is commonly kept in aquaria, while two species of catfish, &quot;Lithogenes valencia&quot; and &quot;Pimelodella tapatapae&quot; are entirely endemic to the lake basin.

A lake clean-up scheme with finance from IDB has been described along with information on pollution loads, reuse opportunities and wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure, which was installed between 1991 and 2002.

<doc id="595617" wikidata="Q1141013" url="?curid=595617" title="Xiao Zhaoye">
<text>Xiao Zhaoye (蕭昭業; 473 – 7 September 494), often known by his posthumously demoted title of Prince of Yulin (鬱林王), courtesy name Yuanshang (元尚), childhood name Fashen (法身), was an emperor of the Chinese Southern Qi dynasty. He is known as the Prince of Yulin because that was the title he was posthumously demoted to after his granduncle Xiao Luan assassinated him in 494. During his brief reign, he was known as overly devoting his time on games and pleasure, unaware that the ambitious Xiao Luan had targeted him for removal. After his death, Xiao Luan briefly made his half-brother Xiao Zhaowen emperor, but then seized the throne himself.

== Background ==
Xiao Zhaoye was born in 473, when his great-grandfather Xiao Daocheng was a Liu Song general. Initially, after Xiao Daocheng seized the throne in 479, ending Liu Song and establishing Southern Qi (as its Emperor Gao), Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s father Xiao Zhangmao, as the oldest son of the crown prince Xiao Ze, was created the Prince of Nan Commandery. Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s mother Wang Baoming, Xiao Zhangmao&#x27;s wife, was created the Princess of Nan Commandery. Xiao Zhaoye himself was not given any titles at the moment. He was the only son of Xiao Zhangmao born of Princess Wang, as she was not much favored by her husband.

== As Prince of Nan Commandery, then Crown Prince ==
In 482, after Emperor Gao died, Xiao Ze succeeded him as Emperor Wu. Xiao Zhangmao was created the Crown Prince, and Xiao Zhaoye, as Xiao Zhangmao&#x27;s oldest son, was given his father&#x27;s old title of Prince of Nan Commandery. In 484, at age 11, he married He Jingying as his princess.

On the surface, when Xiao Zhaoye was the Prince of Nan Commandery, he was thought to be studious, careful, filially pious, elegant in his behavior, and dexterious. Therefore, his grandfather Emperor Wu favored him greatly. However, when not in the presence of his grandfather or father, Xiao Zhaoye was instead frivolous and spending time with people who were bad influences. During this time, he lived with his uncle Xiao Ziliang (蕭子良) the Prince of Jingling in Xifu (西府), an important suburb of the capital Jiankang. As Xiao Zhangmao often limited his activities and budget, Xiao Zhaoye often borrowed money from rich households, who would not dare to refuse. He also duplicated a set of keys for the fortress gates so that he could spend night time in games at various military camps. Exasperated, his teachers Shi Renzu (史仁祖) and Hu Tianyi (胡天翼), believing that they and their households would be in trouble regardless of whether they informed this to Emperor Wu or Crown Prince Zhangmao or not, both committed suicide. Xiao Ziliang&#x27;s wife Princess Yuan raised him with love, but Xiao Zhaoye, as he grew, became suspicious that his uncle was interested in taking the throne himself.

Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s wife Princess He was known for her adulterous activities, as she carried on affairs with others while she was princess. The most infamous affair she carried out was with Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s attendant Yang Min (楊珉) -- it was said that they spent day and night together, just like husband and wife. However, He Jingying also was very loving in her relationship with Xiao Zhaoye, and so Xiao Zhaoye turned a blind eye to her adulterous activities. (Some historians indicate that there could have also been a sexual relationship between Xiao Zhaoye and Yang Min, suggesting a ménage à trois.)

In 493, when Xiao Zhangmao was ill, Xiao Zhaoye displayed great distress, so much so that his own health appeared to be in jeopardy, and those who saw him were touched. However, as soon as he arrived at his house, he became happy and feasted. He often requested a witch named Yang to curse his grandfather and father so that he could become emperor sooner. Soon, Xiao Zhangmao died, and Xiao Zhaoye gave Lady Yang much rewards, believing her curses to be effective, and asked her to continue to curse his grandfather. Not realizing Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s activities, Emperor Wu created Xiao Zhaoye crown prince to replace Xiao Zhangmao. Princess He was created crown princess, and Crown Princess Wang became crown princess dowager. Emperor Wu himself soon fell sick, and while Xiao Zhaoye continued to put on a front of distress, he was in fact quite happy, and when he wrote to the Crown Princess, he wrote one large character of &quot;Xi&quot; (喜, meaning &quot;happiness&quot;) surrounded by 36 smaller Xi characters.

As Emperor Wu fell extremely ill, the official Wang Rong (王融), who was friendly with Xiao Ziliang, tried to carry out a plot to put Xiao Ziliang on the throne instead of Xiao Zhaoye. The plot, however, was thwarted by Emperor Wu&#x27;s cousin Xiao Luan the Marquess of Xichang, and after Emperor Wu soon died in August 493, Xiao Zhaoye took the throne.

== Reign ==
Emperor Wu&#x27;s will instructed Xiao Zhaoye to entrust governmental matters to Xiao Ziliang and Xiao Luan, but Xiao Zhaoye, believing Xiao Ziliang to be complicit in Wang Rong&#x27;s plot, immediately carried out several actions that were intended to show his distrust, leaving actual power in Xiao Luan&#x27;s hands while entrusting palace and military matters to several associates he had endeared himself to while he had been the Prince of Nan Commandery, while leaving Xiao Ziliang with a highly honored but ceremonial post. Xiao Zhaoye also ordered Wang to commit suicide. As soon as Emperor Wu was placed in a coffin, Xiao Zhaoye resumed the playing of music, which was traditionally considered inappropriate during times of mourning. He also took Emperor Wu&#x27;s favorite concubine Consort Huo as his own consort—an act then considered incest—and, in order to avoid this from being known, had her name changed to Xu. He honored Crown Princess Dowager Wang as empress dowager, while creating Crown Princess He empress. He spent his days on feasting, games, and on rewarding his associates, often seen talking to money, &quot;Before, it was not easy for me to obtain even one of you. Now there is no one to stop me from using you.&quot; The treasury surpluses that the frugal Emperor Gao and the relatively frugal Emperor Wu had built up were expended in less than a year. His associates were selling offices openly, and Xiao Zhaoye not only did not curb them in, but approved their requests handily.

Xiao Luan, seeing that Xiao Zhaoye was not behaving appropriately, began considering deposing Xiao Zhaoye. He also often counseled Xiao Zhaoye to change his ways, but Xiao Zhaoye did not listen and began to be suspicious of Xiao Luan, particularly after Xiao Luan subsequently forced him to execute Empress He&#x27;s lover Yang Min and his associate Xu Longju (徐龍駒) after accusing them of crimes. He tried to discuss the matter with Emperor Wu&#x27;s younger brother Xiao Qiang (蕭鏘) the Prince of Poyang, who however opposed the action. Meanwhile, Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s trusted generals Xiao Chen (蕭諶) and Xiao Tanzhi (蕭坦之), seeing how frivolous his actions were, instead secretly joined Xiao Luan&#x27;s party and were informing Xiao Luan of Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s actions. Soon, Xiao Luan was finding excuses to execute several other associates of Xiao Zhaoye—including the general Zhou Fengshu (周奉叔), the teacher Du Wenqian (杜文謙), and the head of the household Qiwu Zhenzhi (綦毋珍之) -- in order to weaken Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s associates. Meanwhile, Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s own alertness was reduced after Xiao Ziliang died of anxiety on 4 May 494.

By fall 494, however, Xiao Zhaoye was tired of Xiao Luan, and he plotted with Empress He&#x27;s uncle He Yin (何胤) to have Xiao Luan killed. He Yin did not dare to do so, and suggested that Xiao Luan be observed further. Xiao Zhaoye therefore stopped giving important tasks to Xiao Luan. Xiao Luan then started his coup, in conjunction with Xiao Chen and Xiao Tanzhi —- and Xiao Zhaoye, not realizing that Xiao Chen and Xiao Tanzhi had betrayed him, sought help from Xiao Chen when he realized Xiao Luan was beginning an attack on the palace. His hopes were dashed when he saw Xiao Chen enter the palace. His palace guards were still ready to fight, but Xiao Zhaoye instead fled, and Xiao Chen chased him down and killed him. The day before, on 6 September 494, Xiao Luan had issued an edict in Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s name, demoting Xiao Zhaoye to the rank of prince (with the title of Prince of Yulin, which became the title by which he was thereafter known) and making his younger half-brother Xiao Zhaowen, the Prince of Xin&#x27;an, emperor.

<doc id="595619" wikidata="Q1190405" url="?curid=595619" title="Xiao Zhaowen">
<text>Xiao Zhaowen (蕭昭文) (480 – December 494), formally Prince Gong of Hailing (海陵恭王), courtesy name Jishang (季尚), was an emperor of the Chinese Southern Qi dynasty. He is known as the Prince of Hailing because that was the title he was demoted to after he was deposed by his granduncle Xiao Luan in December 494. (Xiao Luan had made him emperor earlier in September 494 after assassinating his half-brother Xiao Zhaoye.) After Xiao Luan deposed him and assumed the throne himself, he had Xiao Zhaowen poisoned.

== Background ==
Xiao Zhaowen was born in 480, as the second son of the then-Southern Qi Price of Nan Commandery Xiao Zhangmao, the oldest son of the crown prince Xiao Ze. His mother was Xiao Zhangmao&#x27;s concubine Lady Xu. Little is known about his childhood. After the death of his great-grandfather Emperor Gao in 482, his grandfather Xiao Ze became emperor (as Emperor Wu), and his father Xiao Zhangmao became Crown Prince. In 486, at age six, Xiao Zhaowen was created the Duke of Linru. In 490, he married Wang Shaoming, the daughter of the official Wang Ci (王慈), as his duchess. Early in 493, his father Xiao Zhangmao died, and his older brother Xiao Zhaoye became Crown Prince. Several months later, still in 493, Emperor Wu died as well, and Xiao Zhaoye became emperor. Xiao Zhaoye created Xiao Zhaowen the Prince of Xin&#x27;an.

Xiao Zhaoye was a frivolous and wasteful ruler, spending much time in feast and games. In fall 494, the prime minister Xiao Luan the Marquess of Xichang, cousin of Emperor Wu, seeing Xiao Zhaoye as an incompetent ruler and believing that Xiao Zhaoye was going to act against him, carried out a coup and assassinated Xiao Zhaoye. He placed Xiao Zhaowen on the throne to succeed Xiao Zhaoye.

== Reign ==
While Xiao Zhaowen, now 14, carried the title of emperor, actual authority was in the hands of Xiao Luan, and Xiao Luan had himself initially created the Duke of Xuancheng, and then the Prince of Xuancheng. In Xiao Zhaowen&#x27;s name, Xiao Luan soon carried out the executions of a large number of princes who were sons of Emperors Gao and Wu, whom he viewed as threats against himself:

* Xiao Qiang (蕭鏘), the Prince of Poyang, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Zilong (蕭子隆), the Prince of Sui, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Zimao (蕭子懋), the Prince of Jin&#x27;an, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Zijing (蕭子敬), the Prince of Anlu, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Rui (蕭銳), the Prince of Nanping, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Qiu (蕭銶), the Prince of Jinxi, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Keng (蕭鏗), the Prince of Yidu, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Shuo (蕭鑠), the Prince of Guiyang, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Jun (蕭鈞), the Prince of Hengyang, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Feng (蕭鋒), the Prince of Jiangxia, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Zizhen (蕭子真), the Prince of Jian&#x27;an, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Zilun (蕭子倫), the Prince of Baling, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Ziqing (蕭子卿), the Prince of Luling, son of Emperor Wu

Initially, Xiao Zhaowen&#x27;s younger brother Xiao Zhaoxiu (蕭昭秀), the Prince of Linhai, was to be killed as well, but was spared at the last minute. In place of these imperial princes from Emperors Gao and Wu&#x27;s lines, Xiao Luan, because his own sons were young, installed his nephews Xiao Yaoguang (蕭遙光), Xiao Yaoxin (蕭遙欣), and Xiao Yaochang (蕭遙昌) in important posts. Less than three months after Xiao Zhaowen became emperor, Xiao Luan issued an edict in the name of Xiao Zhangmao&#x27;s wife Empress Dowager Wang Baoming, stating that Xiao Zhaowen was not sufficiently intelligent and healthy to be emperor, giving the throne to Xiao Luan, who then took the throne as Emperor Ming.

== After reign ==
The edict deposing Xiao Zhaowen created him the title of the Prince of Hailing. About a month after he was removed from the throne, however, Xiao Luan, on pretenses that Xiao Zhaowen was ill, sent imperial physicians to see him, but instead instructed the physicians to have him poisoned. Xiao Zhaowen was given the posthumous name &quot;Gong&quot; (恭, meaning &quot;respectful&quot;) and buried with great honors, but not imperial honors.

<doc id="595621" wikidata="Q1563511" url="?curid=595621" title="Joy Electric">
<text>Joy Electric is the brand label for a series of electropop/synthpop productions by Ronnie Martin. Martin began producing music under the Joy Electric name in 1994, after the demise of Dance House Children, a band Ronnie was in with his brother Jason Martin of Starflyer 59. Starflyer 59 bass player and Velvet Blue Music owner Jeff Cloud joined Joy Electric from 1996 until 2002. Joy Electric is currently a solo act.

== Pre-Joy Electric history ==
Having experimented with live shows, formed countless after-school bands, and recorded an album that was never to be released under the moniker Morella&#x27;s Forest with Randy Lamb, Ronnie and his brother Jason found their way onto Michael Knott&#x27;s fledgling label, Blonde Vinyl, with a dance album to produce, &quot;Songs and Stories&quot;.

After buying an old Akai sampler and a few synthesizers, Ronnie began crafting his own spin-off of current electronic &quot;club&quot; music. Still working with his brother Jason, Ronnie&#x27;s new band, Dance House Children, posited cold, hypnotic electronica against quaint, old-fashioned lyrics. After producing another album, &quot;Jesus&quot;, Dance House Children found Jason leaving to pursue his own musical endeavors, Starflyer 59.

With the help of a few friends, Ronnie turned from the club-oriented music to a more melodic, orchestrated sound. A large range of instruments were used on his third album, containing timpanis, Moog synthesizers, and far more exotic sounds than anything he had previously produced. It was evident that Martin was quickly moving beyond the level of pre-programmed keyboard sounds as he became more well-versed in the programming of his synthesizers. &quot;Rainbow Rider: Beautiful Dazzling Music No. 1&quot;, the name of his third album, formed the bridge between Martin&#x27;s &quot;techno&quot;-like early days and his enigmatic Joy Electric creation. 

== Melody and Five Stars for Failure ==
During the process of writing his fourth album - originally intended as &quot;Beautiful Dazzling Music No. 2&quot;, then &quot;Fairy Tale Melodies&quot; (some Tooth and Nail promotional material came out with this name), and then later to be renamed simply as &quot;Melody&quot; - Martin found the sound of his project changing radically. Of course, changes were quite evident during &quot;Beautiful Dazzling Music&quot;, but this fourth album carried things to the extreme. Analog synths began to dominate the studio floor-space. Furthermore, Martin began perfecting a clock-like musical technique that had a strange assortment of blips and whirls constantly rotating in the background. The fourth album resulted in several things: a new band name (Joy Electric), his signing with a new label (Tooth &amp; Nail Records), and the launching of Martin&#x27;s signature sound which he carries to this day.

== We Are the Music Makers and Old Wives Tales ==
By this time, Martin became increasingly fascinated with the idea of musical &quot;purism&quot;. Finding inspiration in &#x27;70s electronic bands that were &quot;purists&quot; out of necessity (having nothing but simple analog synthesizers with which to assemble an entire collage of blurpy sounds), Martin delegated nearly his entire studio to the closet and vowed to build an album up, brick by brick, from the sounds of just one master synthesizer. Under this constraint he went to work—designing, programming, and storing all his sounds for the new album in a Roland JD-990.

Putting all his eggs in one basket (or synthesizer in this case) left Martin particularly vulnerable to one perennial problem: his synthesizer&#x27;s storage memory got wiped clean. It&#x27;s uncertain how this happened, but halfway through the new album Martin found that all his work had been lost. Martin had to begin again from scratch. Taking this opportunity to reconsider his approach, he decided to move into an even more purist direction than before, determined to create a cohesive synthesizer concept album with a medieval, Tolkienesque feel. Since the first half-completed album is no longer in existence, it is impossible to gauge just how radical a change this was from Martin&#x27;s original effort.

&quot;We Are the Music Makers&quot; includes Arthurian songs of dim castles, assemblies of knights riding out to battle, dedications to monarchy, and crumbling recollections of Christendom. This Medieval theme was unusual subject matter for a mid-&#x27;90s electronic album.

Of all his albums, Martin consistently cites this as his least favorite. (On top of feeling burnt out from the amount of work he put into the album, he came to feel in retrospect that the albums&#x27; more experimental sound concealed a somewhat subpar group of songs, in terms of hooks and melodies). Some find the album shows Martin&#x27;s inexperience at this new &quot;purist&quot; model. However, other fans claim that this album contains some of Martin&#x27;s most memorable and emblematic work, including &quot;Burgundy Years,&quot; &quot;Hansel (I Will Be Your Friend),&quot; and &quot;I Beam, You Beam&quot;.

Martin quickly followed this album with yet another EP, this one titled &quot;Old Wives Tales&quot;. While retaining the Black Forest fairy-tale theme, he dropped the darker, gothic strains and produced a set of songs mixing pop and nostalgia. Joy Electric, in some way or another, has always been an escapist band, leading the listener into a sort of musical land largely unfamiliar and isolated. &quot;Old Wives Tales&quot; stands as the high-point of that escapism, and proved to be just what fans were looking for. Audiences began to grow, the EP sold in greater numbers, and favorable articles appeared in all sorts of music magazines.

== Robot Rock and Christiansongs ==
Riding this building wave of popularity, Joy Electric began commanding greater respect both abroad and at home. This attention at Tooth &amp; Nail was especially critical, leading to a series of albums that were designed to, and indeed succeeded in, garnering some degree of commercial success. Music videos were made and became more widely distributed. The music moved out of cult circles and picked up new fans in rapid numbers.

&quot;Robot Rock&quot; was the first album to capitalize on this. The album moved away from the world of &quot;bedroom production&quot; and into professional studio hands. The vocals came across as polished and well-groomed. Having practiced on his analog synthesizers for years, Martin commanded better control of his synthesizers&#x27; sounds. To showcase these growing skills, the songs were generally more sparse. The entire album harked back, more than any other release, to his groundbreaking work in &quot;Melody&quot;.

Following his pattern, Martin released an EP as well, titled &quot;The Land of Misfits&quot;, containing &quot;Monosynth&quot;, two remixes of songs from &quot;Robot Rock&quot;, a remix of &quot;The Cobbler&quot; from &quot;Old Wives Tales EP&quot; and one new song. It was generally considered a disappointment by fans, containing only one new song along with reworkings of songs from &quot;Robot Rock&quot;.

Eventually another EP materialized, the &quot;Children of the Lord&quot; maxi single. While still including covers on the EP, Martin this time brought some greater variety to the release. Two songs covered radically different influences: Punk rockers MxPx and seventies singer Keith Green. The last song was a Cloud2Ground remix of a song from the upcoming album.

In 1999, &quot;Christiansongs&quot; was released. Concerning the title, Martin explained his frustration over Christian music groups attempting to downplay their religion in hopes for greater commercial success. Having grown up a Christian, Martin had rarely allowed his faith to intrude heavily upon his music. He nevertheless disapproved of statements like &quot;we&#x27;re Christians but we&#x27;re not a Christian band&quot;. In contrast, and to set the record straight for any fans, Martin&#x27;s new album title left no doubt concerning the matter.

&quot;Christiansongs&quot; contained some of Joy Electric&#x27;s most overt references to Christianity, exhorting believers to remain strong (&quot;Lift Up Your Hearts&quot;), singing musical prayers of religious dedication (&quot;Make My Life a Prayer&quot;, which was a cover of a song written by Melody Green), and proclaiming general obedience to God (&quot;True Harmony&quot;). But the album contained deep lyrical divides. The religious songs were overwhelmingly religious. The other half of the album was, more or less, the usual Joy Electric fare.

&quot;Christiansongs&quot; also demonstrated Martin&#x27;s ability to move beyond bubbly-happy songs that critics condemned for being too shallow. The album showcased a wide range of feelings, spanning to familiar exuberant territory all the way into new, darker directions.

== The Legacy Series ==
2001 saw the release of Legacy Volume 1: &quot;The White Songbook&quot;. A year and a half in the making, &quot;The White Songbook&quot; continued in the synthesized tradition of the past few albums by using nothing but a Roland System 100, but with many intricate and interwoven layers of sounds building on each other. The music was divided into four thematic chapters, and the very sparse artwork of the album was meant to invoke the sense of an old book. This album also brought the relatively successful single &quot;We Are Rock.&quot; In spite of a level of critical success, Ronnie was miserable during the album&#x27;s long and tedious production. The companion EP to this album is &quot;Starcadia&quot;, which has since gone out of print and become a much sought after collectible.

The Legacy series continued with &quot;The Tick Tock Treasury&quot;, whose sparseness was a musical reaction to the thick and lush nature of &quot;The White Songbook&quot;. Instead of including lyrics in the booklet, Ronnie opted to include a short story which served as inspiration for the title of the album. As opposed to &quot;The White Songbook&quot;, &quot;The Tick Tock Treasury&quot;&#x27;s placement in the Legacy series was found only in a small and passing liner note in the CD insert. The companion EP to this album is &quot;The Tick Tock Companion&quot;, a long-running set of experimental synthesizer music recorded in one take.

The third Legacy album was &quot;Hello, Mannequin&quot;. Like its predecessor, its place in the Legacy series was only shown by a small liner note. This album brought a significantly more rigid structure to the songs, with basslines sometimes not changing for the duration of an entire track. The companion EP, &quot;Friend of Mannequin&quot;, contains remixes, several new songs, and a three-part interview.

&quot;The Ministry of Archers&quot;, identified as a Legacy album only by the mark &quot;lv4&quot; (for Legacy Volume 4) in the liner notes, was also the first to be produced in the newly renovated Electric Joy Toy Company on Ronnie&#x27;s new Moog synthesizer equipment. The new synthesizer brought a significant change in sound, though the album bears some resemblance to previous Legacy works. Namely, it is broken into chapters like &quot;The White Songbook&quot; and its lyrics are not printed in the sleeve, like &quot;The Tick Tock Treasury&quot;. The companion EP, &quot;Montgolfier and the Romantic Balloons&quot;, is split into two sections: an eponymous mini concept album, and a collection of remixes and extra tracks called &quot;Other Archers.&quot; &quot;The Ministry of Archers&quot; was released on compact disc by Tooth &amp; Nail Records on August 30, 2005, and on colored 12&quot; vinyl by Republic of Texas Recordings and Somewherecold Records in October 2005.

&quot;The Otherly Opus&quot; was released on March 20, 2007 as the fifth and final volume in the Legacy series, noted as &quot;Moog Dynasty Years Volume 2&quot;. The album includes some of the most intricate vocal work on a Joy Electric album to date. Thematically, the album is split in two-halves. The first half is known as &quot;The Otherly Opus&quot;, while the second half is &quot;The Memory of Alpha&quot;, a mini concept album about antediluvian times. The album&#x27;s companion EP, &quot;Their Variables&quot;, contains remixes of all songs on &quot;The Otherly Opus&quot; as well as two new songs. It was released on September 18, 2007.

==Moog Dynasty==
Continuing on the Moog tradition of the previous two albums, Joy Electric&#x27;s album &quot;My Grandfather, The Cubist&quot; was released May 27, 2008. The following year, two EPs were released: &quot;Early Cubism&quot; is a digital download consisting of demos of three tracks from &quot;My Grandfather, The Cubist&quot;, while &quot;Curiosities and Such&quot; contains six new songs.

In 2009, Joy Electric released &quot;Favorites at Play&quot;, an album composed of covers of artists such as Coldplay, The Killers, Blink 182 and more.

==Dwarf Mountain Alphabet==
On March 20, 2012, Joy Electric announced that the new album would be released independently. A Kickstarter campaign was launched to raise $6,000 to fund the project. The goal was reached within nine hours. Dwarf Mountain Alphabet had been previously announced in an interview with Ronnie Martin in Fall 2011. The album was released on December 4, 2012.

<text>The Congo pied hornbill (Lophoceros fasciatus) is a bird of the hornbill family, a family of tropical near-passerine birds found in the Old World.

The Congo pied hornbill is native to the Congo Basin. This is a bird of mainly forest habitats. The female lays up to four white eggs in a tree hole, which is blocked off during incubation with a cement made of mud, droppings and fruit pulp. There is only one narrow aperture, just big enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and the chicks.

==Morphology==
This is a large bird, in length. It has mainly black plumage, with white belly and tail tip. The long, curved black and yellow bill has a medium-sized casque. The sexes are similar, but the female has a smaller casque. Immature birds are duller, have a smaller bill, and no casque. The flight is undulating.

==Behaviour==
The Congo pied hornbill is omnivorous and eats fruit and insects. It feeds mainly in trees and is attracted to oil palms.

This conspicuous and gregarious bird advertises its presence with its whistling &quot;pii-pii-pii-pii-&quot; call.

When the chicks and the female are too big to fit in the nest, the mother breaks out and rebuilds the wall. Then both parents feed the chicks.

<doc id="595624" wikidata="Q1149132" url="?curid=595624" title="Emperor Ming of Southern Qi">
<text>Emperor Ming of Southern Qi ((南)齊明帝) (452 – 1 September 498), personal name Xiao Luan (蕭鸞), courtesy name Jingqi (景棲), childhood name Xuandu (玄度), was an emperor of the Southern Qi dynasty of China. He was a nephew of the Southern Qi founder Emperor Gao, who later became prime minister during the reign of Emperor Gao&#x27;s great-grandson Xiao Zhaoye.

Believing that Xiao Zhaoye was an incompetent emperor who might act against him, Xiao Luan carried out a coup d&#x27;état and assassinated Xiao Zhaoye. After briefly making Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s brother Xiao Zhaowen emperor, he deposed Xiao Zhaowen as well, and took over himself as emperor. During his reign, he was known for being exacting and demanding, but also being frugal. He is seen as a very dark figure in history, because he slaughtered the surviving sons of Emperor Gao and Emperor Gao&#x27;s son Emperor Wu, despite their kindness toward him.

== Background ==
Xiao Luan was born in 452. His mother&#x27;s name is lost to history, and his father was Xiao Daosheng (蕭道生), a mid-low-level official during Liu Song. Xiao Daosheng died early, and Xiao Luan was raised by Xiao Daosheng&#x27;s younger brother Xiao Daocheng, a Liu Song general. He had two brothers, Xiao Feng (蕭鳳), who was older, and Xiao Mian (蕭緬), who was younger. Xiao Daocheng was said to have loved Xiao Luan greatly, even more so than his own sons. In 472, at the age of 20, Xiao Luan was made a county magistrate, and during the next few years, as his uncle&#x27;s powers increased, he was promoted through a number of positions, becoming a general in 478. When Xiao Daocheng took over the throne from Emperor Shun of Liu Song in 479, ending Liu Song and establishing Southern Qi, he created Xiao Luan the Marquess of Xichang.

== During Emperors Gao and Wu&#x27;s reigns ==

During the reigns of Emperors Gao and Wu, Xiao Luan was steadily promoted, until he reached the higher echelon of power late in the reign of Emperor Wu. He was well regarded by the public and officials alike for his humble attitude and frugality in living, as he did not use luxury items and took on the clothing of an ordinary member of the intelligentsia. At one time, Emperor Wu considered making him the minister in charge of the civil service, but Emperor Wu changed his mind after the idea was opposed by the official Wang Yan (王晏), who believed that Xiao Luan was capable but did not know powerful clans well, and therefore would be ill-equipped to handle the civil service, which at the time weighed the officials&#x27; lineages heavily in decisions. Xiao Luan was friendly with Emperor Wu&#x27;s son Xiao Ziliang (蕭子良) the Prince of Jingling, who served as prime minister. However, Emperor Wu&#x27;s crown prince Xiao Zhangmao did not like him, and Xiao Ziliang had to defend Xiao Luan before Xiao Zhangmao, and often endorsed Xiao Luan to Emperor Wu. As a result, after the Xiao Zhangmao&#x27;s death in 493, Emperor Wu, who was himself ill later in the year, designated Xiao Ziliang and Xiao Luan in his will to be the two individuals in charge of the government for his new crown prince, Xiao Zhangmao&#x27;s son Xiao Zhaoye. Xiao Luan was subsequently instrumental in discovering and thwarting the plot of the official Wang Rong (王融), who tried to divert succession of the throne to Xiao Ziliang. When Emperor Wu died soon thereafter, Xiao Zhaoye succeeded to the throne.

== During Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s reign ==

As a result of Wang Rong&#x27;s plot, Xiao Zhaoye distrusted Xiao Ziliang, and while he granted Xiao Ziliang highly honored titles, actual power rested in Xiao Luan&#x27;s hands. Soon, however, Xiao Zhaoye demonstrated himself to be a frivolous ruler, spending most of his time in feast and games while expending the treasury surpluses that Emperors Gao and Wu had built up. Xiao Luan tried several times to counsel him to change his ways, with no changes in his behavior, and Xiao Zhaoye in fact began to suspect Xiao Luan and wanted to kill him, but could not resolve to do so, particularly after he consulted with his granduncle (Emperor Wu&#x27;s son) Xiao Qiang (蕭鏘) the Prince of Poyang, and Xiao Qiang opposed the action. Meanwhile, Xiao Luan also became suspicious that Xiao Zhaoye was going to kill him, and therefore began to set up relationships with key generals—including Xiao Chen (蕭諶) and Xiao Tanzhi (蕭坦之), both of whom were well-trusted by Xiao Zhaoye—while finding pretexts to remove close associates of Xiao Zhaoye, including Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s wife He Jingying&#x27;s lover Yang Min (楊珉), the eunuch Xu Longju (徐龍駒), the general Zhou Fengshu (周奉叔), the teacher Du Wenqian (杜文謙), and the head of the household Qiwu Zhenzhi (綦毋珍之). However, Xiao Zhaoye appeared to be unaware of Xiao Luan&#x27;s actual intentions, and his own alertness decreased after Xiao Ziliang died of anxiety in summer 494.

By fall 494, however, Xiao Zhaoye was tired of Xiao Luan, and he plotted with Empress He&#x27;s uncle He Yin (何胤) to have Xiao Luan killed. He Yin did not dare to do so, and suggested that Xiao Luan be observed further. Xiao Zhaoye therefore stopped giving important tasks to Xiao Luan. Xiao Luan then started his coup, in conjunction with Xiao Chen and Xiao Tanzhi—and Xiao Zhaoye, not realizing that Xiao Chen and Xiao Tanzhi had betrayed him, sought help from Xiao Chen when he realized Xiao Luan was beginning an attack on the palace. His hopes were dashed when he saw Xiao Chen enter the palace. His palace guards were still ready to fight, but Xiao Zhaoye instead fled, and Xiao Chen chased him down and killed him. On 6 September 494, Xiao Luan issued an edict in Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s name, demoting Xiao Zhaoye to the rank of prince (with the title of Prince of Yulin, which became the title he was thereafter known for) and making his younger brother Xiao Zhaowen the Prince of Xin&#x27;an emperor.

== During Xiao Zhaowen&#x27;s reign ==

While Xiao Zhaowen, now 14, carried the title of emperor, actual authority was in the hands of Xiao Luan, and Xiao Luan had himself initially created the Duke of Xuancheng, and then the Prince of Xuancheng. In Xiao Zhaowen&#x27;s name, Xiao Luan soon carried out the executions of a large number of princes who were sons of Emperors Gao and Wu, whom he viewed as threats against himself:

* Xiao Qiang (蕭鏘), the Prince of Poyang, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Zilong (蕭子隆), the Prince of Sui, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Zimao (蕭子懋), the Prince of Jin&#x27;an, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Zijing (蕭子敬), the Prince of Anlu, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Rui (蕭銳), the Prince of Nanping, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Qiu (蕭銶), the Prince of Jinxi, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Keng (蕭鏗), the Prince of Yidu, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Shuo (蕭鑠), the Prince of Guiyang, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Jun (蕭鈞), the Prince of Hengyang, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Feng (蕭鋒), the Prince of Jiangxia, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Zizhen (蕭子真), the Prince of Jian&#x27;an, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Zilun (蕭子倫), the Prince of Baling, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Ziqing (蕭子卿), the Prince of Luling, son of Emperor Wu

Initially, Xiao Zhaowen&#x27;s younger brother Xiao Zhaoxiu (蕭昭秀), the Prince of Linhai, was to be killed as well, but was spared at the last minute. In place of these imperial princes from Emperors Gao and Wu&#x27;s lines, Xiao Luan, because his own sons were young, installed his nephews Xiao Yaoguang (蕭遙光), Xiao Yaoxin (蕭遙欣), and Xiao Yaochang (蕭遙昌) in important posts. Less than three months after Xiao Zhaowen became emperor, Xiao Luan issued an edict in the name of Xiao Zhangmao&#x27;s wife Empress Dowager Wang Baoming, stating that Xiao Zhaowen was not sufficiently intelligent and healthy to be emperor, giving the throne to Xiao Luan, who then took the throne as Emperor Ming.

== Reign ==
Emperor Ming was commonly regarded as an intelligent and frugal ruler, and he took a hands-on approach to governance. He was, however, also known for his suspecting nature, and few high-level officials could feel safe during his reign. He also periodically continued to kill the descendants of (presumably to Emperors Gao and Wu) and cry bitterly, before carrying out the actions.

Emperor Ming created his second son Xiao Baojuan crown prince, as his oldest son Xiao Baoyi (蕭寶義) was said to be so disabled that he could not speak (and was also not born of Emperor Ming&#x27;s wife Liu Huiduan (劉惠端), who had died in 489, long before he became emperor). As Emperor Ming&#x27;s sons were young, he entrusted great responsibilities to his nephews Xiao Yaoguang, Xiao Yaoxin, and Xiao Yaochang. When Xiao Zhaowen was removed from the throne, the edict that Emperor Ming issued in Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s name created him the Prince of Hailing. About a month after he was removed from the throne, however, Emperor Ming, on pretenses that Xiao Zhaowen was ill, sent imperial physicians to see him, but instead instructed the physicians to have him poisoned. Xiao Zhaowen was given the posthumous name &quot;Gong&quot; (恭, meaning &quot;respectful&quot;) and buried with great honors, but not imperial honors.

Meanwhile, Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei used Emperor Ming&#x27;s usurpation of the throne as a pretense to launch a major attack against Southern Qi in late 494. After several largely inconclusive battles, however, Northern Wei forces abandoned the campaign in spring 495. As soon as the campaign was over, Emperor Ming executed Xiao Chen, one general he was allied with during the coup against Xiao Zhaoye, and Xiao Chen&#x27;s brothers, as he suspected Xiao Chen of plotting a coup. He also, on pretense that they were plotting with Xiao Chen, executed Emperor Wu&#x27;s sons Xiao Ziming (蕭子明) the Prince of Xiyang, Xiao Zihan (蕭子罕) the Prince of Nanhai, and Xiao Zizhen (蕭子貞) the Prince of Shaoling. In 497, he also killed the high-level official Wang Yan, who had also participated in the coup against Xiao Zhaoye, on suspicion of plotting against him.

In fall 497, Northern Wei&#x27;s Emperor Xiaowen launched another major attack on Southern Qi. The results were again largely indecisive, although the key border city Wancheng (宛城, in modern Nanyang, Henan) fell to Northern Wei, as did Xinye (新野, also in modern Nanyang). Meanwhile, during the campaign, with Emperor Ming himself being ill, he, in consultation with Xiao Yaoguang, executed 10 more princes from Emperor Gao&#x27;s line—all of the surviving sons of Emperors Gao and Wu and Xiao Zhangmao, as he perceived them to be threats to his own sons. Each time he conducted these killings, he would first offer incenses 
* Xiao Xuan (蕭鉉), the Prince of Hedong, son of Emperor Gao
* Xiao Ziyue (蕭子岳), the Prince of Linhe, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Ziwen (蕭子文), the Prince of Xiyang, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Zijun (蕭子峻), the Prince of Hengyang, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Zilin (蕭子琳), the Prince of Nankang, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Zimin (蕭子珉), the Prince of Yongyang, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Zijian (蕭子建), the Prince of Xiangdong, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Zixia (蕭子夏), the Prince of Nan Commandery, son of Emperor Wu
* Xiao Zhaocan (蕭昭粲), the Prince of Guiyang, son of Xiao Zhangmao
* Xiao Zhaoxiu (蕭昭秀), the Prince of Baling, son of Xiao Zhangmao

What was particularly unusual about Emperor Ming&#x27;s actions in executing these princes was that after he executed them, he ordered the high-level officials to accuse these princes of crimes and seek their executions—and then he first formally rejected the recommendations, and then accepted them. This was largely perceived as an attempt by him to be seen as only doing what was necessary.

In summer 498, the retired general Wang Jingze (王敬則), believing that Emperor Ming was about to have him executed, rebelled from his retirement place of Kuaiji (modern Shaoxing in Zhejiang). He claimed to want to support Emperor Gao&#x27;s grandson (the son of Xiao Ni the Prince of Yuzhang) Xiao Zike (蕭子恪) the Marquess of Nankang as leader. As a result, Emperor Ming, again with counsel from Xiao Yaoguang, ordered all of the male descendants of Emperors Gao and Wu into the palace, ready to poison them. However, after Xiao Zike fled back to the capital Jiankang and showed that he was not part of Wang&#x27;s rebellion, Emperor Ming changed his mind at the last moment and spared them. About 20 days after the start of Wang&#x27;s rebellion, he was killed in battle, and his rebellion dissipated.

Three months later, Emperor Ming died. Crown Prince Baojuan succeeded him as emperor (later to be known as the Marquess of Donghun).

<doc id="595625" wikidata="Q235770" url="?curid=595625" title="Miss Kittin">
<text>Caroline Hervé (born 15 July 1973), known professionally as Kittin, is a French electronic music producer, DJ, singer, and songwriter. Since rising to prominence in 1998 for her singles &quot;1982&quot; and &quot;Frank Sinatra&quot; with The Hacker, she has worked with other musicians such as Chicks on Speed, Felix da Housecat and Golden Boy. She released her debut solo album &quot;I Com&quot; in 2004, a second, &quot;BatBox&quot;, in 2008, and a third, &quot;Calling from the Stars&quot;, in 2013. She achieved international popularity with the singles &quot;Rippin Kittin&quot; and &quot;Silver Screen Shower Scene&quot;.

==Life and career==

===1973–1994: Early life===
Miss Kittin was born Caroline Hervé in 1973 in Grenoble, a city in the Alps, in southeastern France. Music such as Genesis, Supertramp, Miles Davis, Maria Callas, Pink Floyd and The Beatles became a prominent part of her and her parents&#x27; lives. At the age of 6, Hervé often played piano for fun at her grandparents&#x27;, and reproduced melodies from the radio. Miss Kittin tried taking piano lessons but gave up after 2 years. In addition, she started practicing ballet when she was 5 years old and continued until she was 22.

After earning her high school diploma in 1990, Miss Kittin studied art, first in Marseille (1991), then in the Beaux-Arts of Grenoble to specialize in contemporary art (1993–94). She finished her graphic design program in Amiens in 1995 before starting her full-time DJ job.

===1995–1997: Career beginnings===
As time progressed, Kittin found herself emulating her parents&#x27; musical tastes by developing an interest in musical genres ranging from classic, jazz, funk, and disco to English pop. Finding her niche in electronic music in 1991, Kittin raved all around the country before doing her first mix in April 1993. Her first set came one year later in 1994, at which time she started her career with Tekmics Booking Agency. When she was 22, she began DJing, spinning records in France, Moscow and Chicago with Mike Dearborn. A major break came for the producer/DJ when she received bookings for the Dragon Ball events in southern France. In 1996, she moved to Geneva, Switzerland, and joined the Mental Groove Records group. A trio of early productions on various-artists compilations were scattered throughout 1996 and 1997.

===1998–2003: The Hacker, &quot;First Album&quot; and &quot;Or&quot;===
The first records she bought for DJing were Richie Hawtin&#x27;s &quot;Fuse&quot; and Robert Hood&#x27;s &quot;The Protein Valve&quot;. It took her three months to earn enough money at her job as a supermarket cashier to buy a secondhand pair of Technics decks, both of which she still uses. In 1997, she met DJ Hell in Marseille, who wanted her to record for his International DJ Gigolo label. In 1998, she presented him with the EP &quot;Champagne&quot; that she recorded with The Hacker. &quot;Champagne&quot; included tracks such as &quot;1982&quot; and &quot;Frank Sinatra&quot;, which became anthems of the electroclash scene and underground hits in Europe. It further included a cover of the song &quot;Dirty Talk&quot; by Klein + M.B.O. In 1999, the duo released the EP &quot;Intimités&quot;, which included a cover of the Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot;.

Miss Kittin &amp; The Hacker released &quot;First Album&quot; in 2001. &quot;First Album&quot; received positive reviews from contemporary critics; according to the music review aggregation of Metacritic, it garnered an average score of 68/100. The album was listed on several &quot;Best Albums of the Decade&quot; lists. Despite not charting, the album sold over 50,000 copies worldwide. Slant Magazine placed &quot;Frank Sinatra&quot; at number eighty-six on its &quot;100 Greatest Dance Songs&quot; list. Other songs on the album include &quot;Stock Exchange&quot; and &quot;The Beach&quot;.

While touring with The Hacker in support of their debut album, Miss Kittin met Felix da Housecat at a Swiss festival. The next day, Kittin and Felix composed &quot;Silver Screen Shower Scene&quot; and &quot;Madame Hollywood&quot; in a friend&#x27;s small studio in Geneva. She also cowrote and was featured on the songs &quot;Voicemail&quot; and &quot;What Does It Feel Like?&quot; from Felix da Housecat&#x27;s album &quot;Kittenz and Thee Glitz&quot;. The album received positive reviews from contemporary critics, garnering an average score of 78/100 on the music review aggregation of Metacritic. &quot;Silver Screen Shower Scene&quot; became one of the first electroclash songs to reach the UK Top 40, peaking at number thirty-nine. &quot;Madame Hollywood&quot; peaked at number nineteen on the Canadian Singles Chart. In 2001, Sven Väth featured Miss Kittin on a cover of &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non-plus&quot;, the Serge Gainsbourg song. After shooting the music video for &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non-plus&quot;, Miss Kittin decided to move to Berlin and take a job as an A&amp;R consultant at Mute Records Germany.

In 2002, she released the techno music compilations &quot;On the Road&quot; and &quot;Radio Caroline Vol.1&quot;. Both albums received positive reviews for showcasing her talents &quot;as a DJ rather than an electroclash diva&quot;, who &quot;finally tears down the facade, proving that she is much more than the champagne-toasting chanteuse that her sensual accent and fashionista lyrics have always suggested.&quot;

Golden Boy first met Miss Kittin after she remixed one of his songs. In 2001, the duo released the album &quot;Or&quot; on &quot;Ladomat 2000&quot;. The single &quot;Rippin Kittin&quot;, released in the same year, references the Misfits&#x27; song &quot;Mommy, Can I Go Out &amp; Kill Tonight?&quot; from the band&#x27;s album &quot;Walk Among Us&quot;. After being endorsed by Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys, the single became a club success in Europe and became Miss Kittin&#x27;s first No. 1 single on the UK Dance Chart. Pitchfork Media placed &quot;Rippin Kittin&quot; at number four-hundred thirty-five on its &quot;Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s&quot; list. In addition, Stylus Decade placed the song at number seventy-five on its &quot;Top 100 Singles of the 2000s&quot; list.

She collaborated with Chicks on Speed and sang on the songs &quot;Shick Shaving&quot; and &quot;Wordy Rappinghood&quot; from their album &quot;99 Cents&quot; in 2003. &quot;Wordy Rappinghood&quot; also featured guest vocals by other female musicians such as Kevin Blechdom, Le Tigre, Adult.&#x27;s Nicola Kuperus, and Tina Weymouth of the Tom Tom Club. The song became a moderate dance hit in Europe, peaking at number five on the Belgian Dance Chart, and at number sixty-six on the UK Singles Chart.

===2004–2007: Solo career and &quot;I Com&quot;===

On 24 May 2004, Miss Kittin released her debut solo album &quot;I Com&quot; through NovaMute in the United Kingdom, and through Astralwerks in the United States. She collaborated with The Hacker, Toby Neumann and Thies Mynther for the album. Miss Kittin had met Tobi Neumann and Thies Mynther aka &quot;Glove&quot; after working with them on the Chicks on Speed song &quot;Shick Shaving&quot; and after recording lyrics for Steve Bug. The album received positive reviews from contemporary critics, earning an average score of 73/100 on the music review aggregation of Metacritic. &quot;I Com&quot; yielded three singles: &quot;Professional Distortion&quot;, &quot;Requiem for a Hit&quot; and &quot;Happy Violentine&quot;. The song &quot;Professional Distortion&quot; became Miss Kittin&#x27;s first solo single to chart on the French Singles Chart. Several of the remixes of the three singles were later complied and released on Miss Kittin&#x27;s EP &quot;Mixing Me&quot;.

In 2004, Miss Kittin created her own label Nobody&#x27;s Bizzness. The label would eventually release her albums &quot;BatBox&quot; and &quot;Two&quot; after her departure from NovaMute. She said of the label&#x27;s purpose, &quot;I created my own label &#x27;Nobody&#x27;s Bizzness&#x27; to release my finished album and keep the maximum freedom with my music.&quot; Additionally, Kittin appeared on the song &quot;Masterplan&quot; from The Hacker&#x27;s album &quot;Rêves Mécaniques&quot; in 2004.

She released &quot;Live at Sónar&quot; in 2006, recorded at the electronic music festival &quot;Sónar&quot; in Barcelona. For Sónar, Miss Kittin provided impromptu new vocals to her established catalogue. During the festival, she was assisted by Aphex Twin, Modeselektor, Boom Bip, and The Hacker. The album was jointly released by Labels and NovaMute.

Miss Kittin also released the double-disc CD &quot;A Bugged Out Mix&quot; in 2006 through Resist Music and System Recordings. Disc One &quot;Perfect Night&quot; combines underground classics (Mike Ink), electro (Cajmere) and minimal techno (Adam Beyer) while the second disc &quot;Perfect Day&quot; is a mix of Miss Kittin&#x27;s favourite post-club tracks from artists such as Wagon Christ, Monolake and Biosphere.

In 2007, Miss Kittin &amp; The Hacker reunited to release the single &quot;Hometown / Dimanche&quot; through Good Life Recordings. The music video for &quot;Hometown&quot; was directed by Régis Brochier of 7th floor Productions.

===2008–2012: &quot;BatBox&quot;, Reunion with The Hacker and &quot;Two&quot;===
After two years in the making and almost four years since her debut album &quot;I Com&quot;, Miss Kittin released her second album, &quot;BatBox&quot; on 4 February 2008, on her label Nobody&#x27;s Bizzness. &quot;BatBox&quot;&#x27;s thirteen original songs were composed whilst touring throughout the world. Miss Kittin described the tracks as a flirtation with Goth culture, as reflected in vocal lines such as &quot;bat in a box / show me what you goth&quot;. Artist Rob Reger designed the cover and included his &quot;Emily the Strange&quot; cartoon in a 12-page foldout booklet for the album. Miss Kittin released the singles &quot;Kittin Is High&quot; and &quot;Grace&quot; to promote the album.

In 2008, Miss Kittin &amp; The Hacker reunited as a duo, and toured throughout America and around the world, before they both started recording new songs, some of which were performed whilst touring. &quot;Two&quot;, their second album together, was released in March 2009. The album was released 8 years after their first and only full LP as a duo. &quot;Two&quot; received positive reviews from contemporary critics; according to the music review aggregation of Metacritic, it garnered an average score of 62/100. Their first single from the album &quot;PPPO&quot; was released in March 2009 followed by the single &quot;1000 Dreams&quot;. Their third and final single from the album &quot;Party in My Head&quot; was released in June 2009. The Thieves Like Us remix of &quot;Party in My Head&quot; was released a free download on &quot;XLR8R&quot;″s website. Miss Kittin &amp; The Hacker also included a cover of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; on the album, for which they filmed a promotional music video directed by Régis Brochier of 7th floor Productions. &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; was later featured on the downloadable for free mixtape &quot;Skull of Dreams&quot; by Little Boots.

Miss Kittin was featured on Primal Scream&#x27;s cover of &quot;Diamonds, Fur Coat, Champagne&quot; for a limited-edition 10-inch vinyl pressing. A total of 3,000 copies were pressed and released on 30 March 2009. The song is a part of a series of Suicide covers by other musicians such as The Horrors and Lydia Lunch released on the Blast First Petite label to celebrate Suicide frontman Alan Vega&#x27;s 70th birthday. Miss Kittin remixed Felix da Housecat&#x27;s song &quot;We All Wanna Be Prince&quot; in 2009, changing the word &quot;Prince&quot; into &quot;princess&quot;. She also appeared on the single &quot;Le Flaneur&quot; from the album &quot;Elemental Assets&quot; by Estroe in 2009. In 2010, Miss Kittin was featured on the song &quot;DNA&quot; from the album &quot;Ever Since&quot; by Xenia Beliayeva.

On 10 January 2011, Miss Kittin released the single &quot;All You Need&quot; on Mobilee Records. On 28 March, a free download of her song &quot;Silver Lake&quot; was released through SoundCloud to promote Soul Aid, a program to raise money for Civic Force, an emergency relief organization stationed in Kesennuma after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

===2013–2017: &quot;Calling from the Stars&quot;===
Miss Kittin released &quot;Calling from the Stars&quot; on 19 April 2013. A double album with 23 new songs, it includes a cover version of R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;. Some of the tracks were made available prior to the album release, such as &quot;Bassline&quot;.
She also released the Track &quot;Hide&quot; on the Vocal Collaboration Album &quot;Features&quot; by Kris Menace. The Video to the Single received an Vimeo Staff Pick.

===2018–2021: &quot;Cosmos&quot;===

Miss Kittin released her first concept album &quot;Cosmos&quot; under the name Kittin on 2 November 2018. 
She wrote: &quot;Who are we, why are we here and where are we going?
Metaphysics - Quantum Physics - Science - Philosophy - Spirituality - Art - Poetry - Existential questions.
Everything is energy. Back to the core. Curiosity. Freedom.
Free of pop and dance floor diktats: no chorus no verse no 4/4 beats.
Just chords, organic atmospheres and textures.
A research on the sound reflecting soul and mind, art and science.
Voice as an instrument like any other.
A continuous soundtrack with no break no silence.
An odyssey.
An ode to the most classical form of electronic music that is Electronica, Ambient, IDM (Intelligent Dance Music) and its heroes.&quot;

<text>Xiao Baojuan (蕭寶卷) (483 – 31 December 501), né Xiao Mingxian (蕭明賢), commonly known by his posthumously demoted title of Marquess of Donghun (東昏侯), courtesy name Zhizang (智藏), was an emperor of the Southern Qi dynasty of China, during the Northern and Southern dynasties period. He was a violent ruler who executed high-level officials at his whim, and this drew several major rebellions, the last of which, by his general Xiao Yan, overthrew him and eventually his dynasty, with Xiao Yan establishing the Liang dynasty. He is known as the Marquess of Donghun because Xiao Yan demoted him to that title after he was killed in a siege of the capital Jiankang.

== Background ==
Xiao Baojuan was born in 483, when his father Xiao Luan was a mid-high-level official and the Marquess of Xichang, as the cousin of Emperor Wu. His original name was Xiao Mingxian. He was Xiao Luan&#x27;s second son, and his mother Liu Huiduan () was Xiao Luan&#x27;s wife. (His only older brother Xiao Baoyi () was born to Xiao Luan&#x27;s concubine Lady Yin.) His mother Marchioness Liu had three other sons, Xiao Baoxuan (), Xiao Baoyin, and Xiao Baorong, before dying in 489.

In 494, with Emperor Wu&#x27;s frivolous and incompetent grandson Xiao Zhaoye as emperor and with Xiao Luan as his prime minister, Xiao Luan carried out a coup d&#x27;état and overthrew Xiao Zhaoye. (It was around this time that Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s name was changed from Mingxian to Baojuan.) Xiao Luan initially made Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s younger brother Xiao Zhaowen emperor, but after further cementing his power, including killing many sons of both Emperor Wu and Emperor Wu&#x27;s father Emperor Gao, Southern Qi&#x27;s founding emperor, Xiao Luan took over the throne himself (as Emperor Ming). As Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s older brother Xiao Baoyi was said to be severely disabled and unable to talk, Xiao Baojuan, as the second son and the oldest born of Xiao Luan&#x27;s wife, was created crown prince.

== As crown prince ==
Not much is known about Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s activities as crown prince. What is known was that Emperor Ming often told him about how Xiao Zhaoye had considered killing him, and warning him that he needed to act decisively. It was also said that he disliked studies but rather liked to spend time in games, and that he was an introvert who did not like to talk. In 495, his father gave the daughter of his official Chu Cheng (), Chu Lingqu, to him as his crown princess in marriage. In 496, he had a coming-of-age ceremony. In 498, during the rebellion of the retired general Wang Jingze (), despite the fact that Wang&#x27;s army was some distance away from the capital Jiankang, Xiao Baojuan mistook a fire as a sign that Wang&#x27;s army was near the capital and changed into a jumpsuit to try to flee, but subsequently Wang&#x27;s army was defeated.

In fall 498, Emperor Ming died. Xiao Baojuan succeeded to the throne as emperor.

== Reign ==
Emperor Ming&#x27;s will left a group of high-level officials in charge of the government—Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s cousin Xiao Yaoguang () the Prince of Shi&#x27;an, the prime minister Xu Xiaosi (), the trusted Jiang Shi () and his brother Jiang Si (), Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s uncle Liu Xuan (), and the general Xiao Tanzhi (). Xiao Baojuan himself was anxious to exercise imperial authority, but often spent his time in games with his close associates, whom he often awarded money. The high-level officials, particularly Jiang Shi, tried to curb his behavior, and this brought great resentment from the young emperor, who was described as not liking meetings with officials but favored eunuchs, bodyguards, and messengers. He created his wife Crown Princess Chu empress, and created his only known son Xiao Song (), by his concubine Consort Huang, crown prince.

With the young emperor&#x27;s lack of virtues becoming evident, Jiang Shi began a discussion among high-level officials to depose him and to replace him with his younger brother Xiao Baoxuan the Prince of Jiangxia. However, Liu Xuan disliked Xiao Baoxuan, and Xiao Yaoguang used this to steer the discussion to making himself emperor. However, Liu opposed this as well, and Xiao Yaoguang, in 499, in anger, unsuccessfully tried to assassinate Liu, who then reported the plot to Xiao Baojuan. Xiao Baojuan immediately had Jiang Shi and Jiang Si arrested and executed. Xiao Yaoguang, in fear, feigned illness and resigned, but subsequently feared that Xiao Baojuan would execute him anyway, and started a rebellion, putting the palace under siege. Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s forces, commanded by Xiao Tanzhi and two other generals, Zuo Xingsheng () and Cao Hu (), counterattacked, and put Xiao Yaoguang&#x27;s headquarters under siege, capturing and executing him.

In the aftermaths of Xiao Yaoguang&#x27;s rebellion, Xiao Baojuan now controlled more power than before, and initially he promoted Xu Xiaosi, Xiao Tanzhi, Liu Xuan, Cao Hu, as well as the official Shen Wenji (), to reward them for their contributions and loyalty during Xiao Yaoguang&#x27;s rebellion. However, less than a month later, Xiao Baojuan, upon reports by his associates who disliked Xiao Tanzhi, had him arrested and executed. Soon, the same fate fell Liu and Cao, and from this point on, the entire government was in fear, not knowing whom the emperor would next kill. Two months later, Xu and Shen, as well as Shen&#x27;s nephew Shen Zhaolüe, were killed as well. Upon hearing how Xiao Baojuan was slaughtering the high-level officials, the senior general Chen Xianda (), then the governor of Jiang Province (江州, modern Jiangxi and Fujian), started a rebellion, advancing quickly on Jiankang and reaching the outskirts of the capital in less than a month, around new year 500. However, Chen then died in battle, and his rebellion was defeated.

After Chen was defeated, Xiao Baojuan became even more arbitrary in his behavior. He liked to visit many places outside the palace, but did not like to have people see his face, and so would first send guards to expel people from their homes and business before heading to the location. Anyone who did not evacuate, either willfully or not, would be executed. By this point, the common people began to resent the emperor as well. In spring 500, in fear, the general Pei Zhaoye (), the governor of Yu Province (豫州, modern central Anhui), surrendered the important city Shouyang to rival Northern Wei.

Xiao Baojuan sent the generals Cui Huijing () and Xiao Yi () to try to recapture Shouyang. However, as soon as he left the capital region, Cui announced that because of the emperor&#x27;s violent character, he was starting a rebellion to overthrow the emperor. He persuaded Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s brother Xiao Baoxuan to join him, and in just 12 days they reached the capital and put the palace under siege. Cui declared Xiao Baojuan be deposed as Prince of Wu. However, Cui, believing that victory was at hand, did not carry out the campaign diligently, and Xiao Baojuan sent messengers to recall Xiao Yi to try to save the capital. Xiao Yi advanced quickly back on the capital and defeated Cui, who fled but was killed during flight. Xiao Baoxuan was executed.

After Cui&#x27;s death, Xiao Baojuan grew even more confident, and his associates quickly controlled the government. He favored his concubine Consort Pan Yunu, awarding her and her father Pan Baoqing () with many things. Pan Baoqing often falsely accused other people of crimes and had them executed, seizing their property. Xiao Baojuan also carried out a large number of construction projects and often demanded tributes of luxury items from the people—and his associates used this opportunity to demand even more things, and the people grew weary.

To award Xiao Yi, Xiao Baojuan had made him prime minister after he defeated Cui Huijing, but he soon grew suspicious of Xiao Yi as well, and with his associates persuading him to, he soon forced Xiao Yi to commit suicide in winter 500. Xiao Yi&#x27;s brother Xiao Yan, the governor of Yong Province (雍州, modern northwestern Hubei) thus declared a rebellion from his provincial capital Xiangyang. Xiao Baojuan sent the general Liu Shanyang () to attack Xiao Yan, but, in fear of a surprise attack from Liu Shanyang, Xiao Yingzhou (), the chief of staff for Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s brother Xiao Baorong, who served as the titular governor of Jing Province (荊州, modern central and western Hubei), instead joined Xiao Yan and surprised and killed Liu Shanyang. Both Xiao Yan and Xiao Yingzhou then declared that they wanted to overthrow Xiao Baojuan and make Xiao Baorong emperor. Xiao Yingzhou remained at Jiangling with Xiao Baorong, while Xiao Yan attacked east.

Xiao Yan&#x27;s progress was not fast but was steady, and by spring 501 the western half of the empire was under the control of his forces. Meanwhile, Xiao Yingzhou had Xiao Baorong declared emperor (as Emperor He). For the next several months, then, Southern Qi had two emperors. Initially Emperor He nominally demoted Xiao Baojuan to commoner rank, and when his officials suggested Xiao Baojuan be created Marquess of Lingyang, he declined, instead he agreed their suggestion to create Xiao Baojuan Prince of Fuling. Meanwhile, two other Jiankang-based plots to kill Xiao Baojuan—one by his cousin Xiao Zhaozhou () the Prince of Baling (a grandson of Emperor Wu), and one by the general Zhang Xintai (), failed. By winter 501, Xiao Yan had reached Jiankang and put the city under siege, but while he was initially successful in defeating Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s forces, the city was initially ably defended by the generals Wang Zhenguo () and Zhang Ji (), and the siege stalled. Meanwhile, Xiao Yingzhou, who had maintained a balance of power with Xiao Yan, died of illness, and from this point, there was no doubt that Xiao Yan was in control of the rebellion.

Around the new year 501, Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s associates told him that, in their opinion, it was because Wang Zhenguo and Zhang Ji were not wholehearted that Xiao Yan&#x27;s army could not be defeated. Hearing of this, in fear, Wang and Zhang had Xiao Baojuan assassinated, and had his head presented to Xiao Yan. Xiao Baojuan was posthumously demoted to the title of Marquess of Donghun. Consort Pan and his other associates were executed, and Empress Chu and Crown Prince Song were both demoted to commoner rank. By 502, Xiao Yan had taken over the throne from Xiao Baorong as well and had ended Southern Qi and established Liang Dynasty.

<doc id="595631" wikidata="Q1200267" url="?curid=595631" title="Dermoid cyst">
<text>A dermoid cyst is a teratoma of a cystic nature that contains an array of developmentally mature, solid tissues. It frequently consists of skin, hair follicles, and sweat glands, while other commonly found components include clumps of long hair, pockets of sebum, blood, fat, bone, nail, teeth, eyes, cartilage, and thyroid tissue.

As dermoid cysts grow slowly and contain mature tissue, this type of cystic teratoma is nearly always benign. In those rare cases wherein the dermoid cyst is malignant, a squamous cell carcinoma usually develops in adults, while infants and children usually present with an endodermal sinus tumor.

==Location==
Due to its classification, a dermoid cyst can occur wherever a teratoma can occur.

===Vaginal and ovarian dermoid cysts===

Ovaries normally grow cyst-like structures called follicles each month. Once an egg is released from its follicle during ovulation, follicles typically deflate. Sometimes fluid accumulates inside the follicle, forming a simple (containing only fluid) cyst. The majority of these functional cysts resolve spontaneously.

While all ovarian cysts can range in size from very small to quite large, dermoid cysts are not classified as functional cysts. Dermoid cysts originate from pluripotent germ cells (which are present at birth) that differentiate abnormally, developing characteristics of mature dermal cells. Complications exist, such as torsion (twisting), rupture, and infection, although their incidence is rare. Dermoid ovarian cysts which are larger present complications which might require removal by either laparoscopy or laparotomy (traditional surgery). Rarely, a dermoid cyst can develop in the vagina.

===Periorbital dermoid cysts===
Dermoid cysts can appear in young children, often near the lateral aspect of the eyebrow (right part of the right eyebrow or left part of the left eyebrow). Depending on the perceived amount of risk, these are sometimes excised or simply kept under observation.

An inflammatory reaction can occur if a dermoid cyst is disrupted, and the cyst can recur if it is not completely excised. Sometimes complete excision is not practical if the cyst is in a dumbbell configuration, whereby it extends through a suture line in the skull.

If dermoid cysts appear on the medial aspect, the possibility of an encephalocele becomes greater and should be considered among the differential diagnoses.

Other areas where a dermoid cyst may appear are the brain, scrotum and the pharynx.

Dermoid cysts develop during pregnancy. They occur when skin cells and things like hair, sweat glands, oil glands or fatty tissue get trapped in the skin as a baby grows in the womb. Dermoid cysts are present at birth (congenital) and are common. It can be months or years before a dermoid cyst is noticed on a child because the cysts grow slowly.

Dermoid cyst symptoms are minor and the cysts are usually painless. They are not harmful to a child&#x27;s health. If they become infected, the infection must be treated and the cyst should be removed. It is easier to remove cysts and prevent scars if the cyst is removed before it gets infected.

===Spinal dermoid cysts===
Spinal dermoid cysts are benign ectopic growths thought to be a consequence of embryology errors during neural tube closure. Their reported incidence is extremely rare, accounting for less than 1% of intramedullary spinal cord tumours. It has been proposed that a possible 180 cases of spinal dermoid tumours have been identified over the past century in the literature.

Dermoid cysts more often involve the lumbosacral region than the thoracic vertebrae and are extramedullary presenting in the first decade of life.

Various hypotheses have been advanced to explain the pathogenesis of spinal dermoids, the origin of which may be acquired or congenital.

* Acquired or iatrogenic dermoids may arise from the implantation of epidermal tissue into the subdural space i.e. spinal cutaneous inclusion, during needle puncture (e.g. lumbar puncture) or during surgical procedures on closure of a dysraphic malformation.
* Congenital dermoids, however, are thought to arise from cells whose position is correct but which fail to differentiate into the correct cell-type. The long-time held belief was that the inclusion of cutaneous ectodermal cells occurred early in embryonic life, and the displaced pluripotent cells developed into a dermoid lesion.
Spinal abnormalities, e.g. intramedullary dermoid cysts may arise more frequently in the lumbosacral region (quite often at the level of the conus medullaris) and may be seen with other congenital anomalies of the spine including posterior spina bifida occulta as identified by the neuroradiological analysis.

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===
A small dermoid cyst on the coccyx can be difficult to distinguish from a pilonidal cyst. This is partly because both can be full of hair. A pilonidal cyst is a pilonidal sinus that is obstructed. Any teratoma near the body surface may develop a sinus or a fistula, or even a cluster of these. Such is the case of Canadian Football League linebacker Tyrone Jones, whose teratoma was discovered when he blew a tooth out of his nose.

==Treatment==
Treatment for dermoid cyst is complete surgical removal, preferably in one piece and without any spillage of cyst contents. Marsupialization, a surgical technique often used to treat pilonidal cyst, is inappropriate for dermoid cyst due to the risk of malignancy.

The association of dermoid cysts with pregnancy has been increasingly reported. They usually present the dilemma of weighing the risks of surgery and anesthesia versus the risks of untreated adnexal mass. Most references state that it is more feasible to treat bilateral dermoid cysts of the ovaries discovered during pregnancy if they grow beyond 6 cm in diameter.

<doc id="595632" wikidata="Q1190420" url="?curid=595632" title="Emperor He of Southern Qi">
<text>Emperor He of Southern Qi () (488 – 2 May 502; r. 14 April 501– 20 April 502), personal name Xiao Baorong (), courtesy name Zhizhao (), was the last emperor of the Chinese Southern Qi dynasty. He was put on the throne by the generals Xiao Yingzhou () and Xiao Yan in 501 as a competing candidate and substitute for the throne to his violent and arbitrary older brother Xiao Baojuan. In 502, with Xiao Baojuan having been defeated and killed and Xiao Yingzhou dead, Xiao Yan seized the throne from Emperor He and took the throne himself, ending the Southern Qi dynasty and starting the Liang dynasty. Soon, Xiao Yan had the 14-year-old former Emperor He put to death.

==Background==
Xiao Baorong was born in 488, when his father Xiao Luan was the Marquess of Xichang and a mid-high-level official under Emperor Wu, a cousin of Xiao Luan&#x27;s. His mother was Xiao Luan&#x27;s wife Marchioness Liu Huiduan (), who died the following year (489). After Xiao Luan seized power from and killed Emperor Wu&#x27;s grandson Xiao Zhaoye in a coup in 494, and then further took the throne later that year from Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s brother Xiao Zhaowen as Emperor Ming, Xiao Baorong, as the new emperor&#x27;s son, was created the Prince of Sui Commandery (随郡王). In 499 (after Emperor Ming&#x27;s death in 498), Xiao Baorong&#x27;s older brother Xiao Baojuan, who had inherited the throne, changed his title to Prince of Nankang instead. (Sometime between 494 and 499, Xiao Baorong married Wang Shunhua, the granddaughter of the early Southern Qi prime minister Wang Jian, as his wife.) Also in 499, Xiao Baojuan made Xiao Baorong the governor of the important Jing Province (荊州, modern central and western Hubei), although the actual responsibilities for governing the province were in staff members&#x27; hands, particularly those of the chief of staff, Xiao Yingzhou.

==Rebellion against Xiao Baojuan==
Xiao Baojuan was an arbitrary and violent ruler, and he often executed high-level officials based on his perception of them as threats to his rule. In winter 500, he executed his prime minister Xiao Yi (), and Xiao Yi&#x27;s brother Xiao Yan, the governor of Yong Province (雍州, modern northwestern Hubei) declared a rebellion from the capital of Yong Province, Xiangyang (襄陽, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei). In response, Xiao Baojuan sent the general Liu Shanyang () to Jing Province, ordering him to rendezvous with Xiao Yingzhou and then attack Xiangyang. Xiao Yan, however, persuaded Xiao Yingzhou that Liu&#x27;s orders were to attack both Jing and Yong Provinces, and Xiao Yingzhou, after making Liu believe his good faith by executing Xiao Yan&#x27;s messenger Wang Tianhu (), surprised and killed Liu, seizing his forces. He then openly declared rebellion and supported Xiao Baorong as nominal leader. Xiao Yingzhou and Xiao Baorong remained at Jiangling (江陵, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), the capital of Jing Province, which was then made into the provisional capital, while Xiao Yan advanced east against Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s forces. In spring 501, Xiao Baorong was proclaimed emperor (as Emperor He), but actual powers were in Xiao Yingzhou&#x27;s hands.

While Xiao Yan&#x27;s campaign east initially stalemated at Yingcheng (郢城, in modern Wuhan, Hubei), by fall 501 he had captured Yingcheng and continued to advance east. He quickly arrived at the capital Jiankang, putting it under siege. (During the siege of Jiankang, Xiao Yingzhou, anxious over the facts that Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s general Xiao Gui () was approaching Jiangling and that Xiao Yan was so easily able to reach Jiankang and becoming popularly supported, died; from that point on, Emperor He was controlled by Xiao Yingzhou&#x27;s lieutenant Xiahou Xiang () and Xiao Yan&#x27;s brother Xiao Dan (), both of whom supported Xiao Yan.) Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s forces, commanded by the generals Wang Zhenguo () and Zhang Ji () were initially able to hold the defenses. However, Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s associates and henchmen then told him that they believed that the reason why Jiankang remained under siege was that Wang and Zhang were not fighting with all their strength—which led Wang and Zhang to be apprehensive, and they assassinated Xiao Baojuan and surrendered.

==After Xiao Baojuan&#x27;s defeat==
Xiao Yan, after triumphing over Xiao Baojuan, for several months appeared to act as if Emperor He did not exist, having Xiao Zhaoye&#x27;s mother Empress Dowager Wang Baoming serve as titular regent in Jiankang instead and effectively ruling in her name. He had her grant him progressively higher titles, including the titles of Duke of Liang and then Prince of Liang, and also granting him the nine bestowments. All of Xiao Baorong&#x27;s brothers were gradually killed, except for Xiao Baoyi () the Prince of Jin&#x27;an, who was disabled, and Xiao Baoyin the Prince of Poyang, who fled to Northern Wei, and Xiao Baoyuan the Prince of Luling, who would soon die of illness. Only in late spring 502 did Xiao Dan send Emperor He on a journey back east toward the capital, but before he reached the capital, Xiao Yan had him issue an edict yielding the throne to Xiao Yan, ending Southern Qi and starting the Liang Dynasty. The edict was confirmed and ratified by Empress Dowager Wang.

Xiao Yan (as Emperor Wu of Liang) initially created Xiao Baorong the Prince of Baling, issuing orders to have a palace built at Gushu (姑孰, in modern Ma&#x27;anshan, Anhui) for Xiao Baorong. However, just one day later, on advice of the official Shen Yue, who believed that Xiao Baorong would pose a future threat, Xiao Yan sent messengers to force Xiao Baorong to commit suicide by drinking poisoned wine. Xiao Baorong refused to commit suicide, but indicated that he was willing to be killed, and he got himself drunk. Xiao Yan&#x27;s messenger Zheng Boqin () then killed him. He was buried with honors due an emperor.

===Yan Jianyuan===
Yan Jianyuan () (480s - early May 502) was a native of Linyi, Langya Commandery (now Shandong Province). He was on the staff of Xiao Baorong, and died several days later due to a hunger strike and anger. Yan Jianyuan is a member of the Yan clan of Langya (). He had a son, Yan Xie (颜协; 498 - 539). Yan Xie had two sons: Yan Zhiyi (颜之仪) and Yan Zhitui (颜之推).

<doc id="595633" wikidata="Q1372485" url="?curid=595633" title="John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)">
<text>John Arthur Thomas Robinson (16 May 1919 – 5 December 1983) was an English New Testament scholar, author and the Anglican Bishop of Woolwich. He was a lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge, and later Dean of Trinity College until his death in 1983 from cancer. Robinson was considered a major force in New Testament studies and in shaping liberal Christian theology. Along with the Harvard theologian Harvey Cox, he spearheaded the field of secular theology and, like William Barclay, was a believer in universal salvation.

==Early life and education==
Robinson was born on 16 May 1919 in the precincts of Canterbury Cathedral, England, where his late father had been a canon. He was educated at Marlborough College, then an all-boys&#x27; public school in Marlborough, Wiltshire. He studied at Jesus College, Cambridge, and Trinity College, Cambridge, and then trained for ordination at Westcott House.

==Ordained ministry==
Robinson was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon in 1945 and as a priest in 1946. From 1945 to 1948, he served his curacy at St Matthew&#x27;s Church, Moorfields in the Diocese of Bristol. The vicar at the time was Mervyn Stockwood.

In 1948, Robinson became chaplain of Wells Theological College, where he wrote his first book, &quot;In the End, God&quot;. In 1951, he was appointed Fellow and Dean of Clare College, Cambridge and a lecturer in divinity at Cambridge University.

Following an invitation from Stockwood, by then the Bishop of Southwark, Robinson became the Bishop of Woolwich in 1959. 
The appointment of Robinson as a suffragan bishop was in Stockwood&#x27;s gift, and whilst the Archbishop of Canterbury (at that point Geoffrey Fisher) questioned the appointment on the grounds that he believed Robinson at that point would be doing more valuable work as a theologian, he accepted that once he had given advice he had &quot;done all that it was proper for him to do&quot; and proceeded to consecrate Robinson to the episcopate. In 1960 Robinson served as a witness for the defence in the obscenity trial of Penguin Books for the publication of D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;. Following a ten-year period at Woolwich, Robinson returned to Cambridge in 1969 as Fellow and Dean of Chapel at Trinity College, where he lectured and continued to write.

==Death==
Robinson was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1983 and died on 5 December of that year in Arncliffe, North Yorkshire.

==Selected writings==

===&quot;In the End, God&quot; (1950)===
Modern Universalist writer Brian Hebblethwaite cites Robinson&#x27;s &quot;In the End, God: A Study of the Christian Doctrine of the Last Things&quot; as arguing for the universal reconciliation of all immortal souls. Ken R. Vincent, in &quot;The Golden Thread&quot; states: &quot;Robinson notes that Christ, in Origen&#x27;s old words, remains on the Cross so long as one sinner remains in [H]ell. This is not speculation: it is a statement grounded in the very necessity of God&#x27;s nature.&quot; George Hunsinger, author of &quot;Disruptive Grace: Studies in the Theology of Karl Barth&quot; writes that &quot;[i]f one is looking for an uninhibited proponent of universal salvation, Robinson leaves nothing to be desired.&quot;

===&quot;Jesus and His Coming&quot; (1957) ===
In this book, an analysis of the early history of the doctrine of the parousia, Robinson states: &quot;That the heart of the Christian hope was now, once more to &#x27;wait for God&#x27;s son from heaven&#x27;, for a second and final coming which would complete and crown the first, is a belief for which we have found no firm foundation in the words of Jesus himself.&quot; Robinson further argued that there was a tendency in the early church to alter the meaning of sayings of Jesus that originally referred to his death and ascension into heaven, to refer to an event in the future that had not yet happened.

===&quot;Honest to God&quot; (1963)===

Robinson wrote several well-received books. The most popular was &quot;Honest to God&quot; published in 1963. According to &quot;Exploration into God&quot; in (1967), he felt its chief contribution was its attempt to synthesize the work of theologians Paul Tillich and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, both of them well known in theological circles, but whose views were largely unknown to the people in the pews. The book proved contentious because it called on Christians to view God as the &quot;Ground of Being&quot; rather than as a supernatural being &quot;out there&quot;. The modifications of the Divine image posited by Robinson have some aspects in common with the psychological deconstruction of God-ideas put forward by his fellow Cambridge theologian Harry Williams in his contribution to the symposium &quot;Soundings&quot; edited by Alec Vidler and published in 1962. When that book was being produced, Robinson was not asked to contribute, because he was then thought to be too conservative a New Testament scholar. This view has never quite dissipated, for in his later books, Robinson would champion early dates and apostolic authorship for the gospels, largely without success.

The media furore concerning &quot;Honest to God&quot; – one which was to portray him as anything but conservative in the public mind – led to a criticism of Robinson in the Church Assembly (the precursor of the General Synod of the Church of England) by the Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey, and there were calls from many quarters for Robinson to resign or be deposed. Whilst Ramsey took Robinson to task for his views, Ramsey&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Image Old and New&quot; rushed out as a response, did not entirely dismiss what had been said. Indeed, Ramsey would later admit in a letter to Mervyn Stockwood that he regretted the way in which he had handled the matter. The book, which has remained almost consistently in print, proposes abandoning the notion of God &quot;out there&quot;, existing somewhere as a &quot;cosmic supremo&quot;, just as we have abandoned already the idea of God &quot;up there&quot;, the notion of &quot;the old man up in the sky&quot;. In its place, he offered a reinterpretation of God as &quot;Love&quot;. After endorsing Paul Tillich&#x27;s assertion that God is the &quot;ground of all being&quot;, Robinson wrote: &quot;For it is in [Jesus] making himself nothing, in his utter self-surrender to others in love, that he discloses and lays bare the ground of man&#x27;s being as Love ... For assertions about God are in the last analysis assertions about Love&quot;. While some of its ideas have been taken up by more liberal circles of Christian thought, proponents of the traditional interpretation of Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, reject Robinson&#x27;s thesis as an unnecessary capitulation to Modernism.

To what extent this is in fact the case depends very much on the frame of reference of the reader. However, the work of Robinson in &quot;Honest to God&quot; provided a departure point which would be followed up in the writings of the radical theologians Don Cupitt and John Shelby Spong and in the 1977 symposium &quot;The Myth of God Incarnate&quot;, edited by John Hick. Whether Robinson would have gone as far as Cupitt did in declaring the idea of God to be an entirely human creation is something which can only be conjectured. However, he said as he was dying that he &quot;never doubted the essential truth of Christianity&quot;. Robinson seemed to rapidly become a person upon whom religious people projected their own ideas of what he was like, and the book &quot;The Honest to God Debate&quot;, edited by Robinson and by David L Edwards, also published in 1963, contains a mixture of articles which either praise Robinson for his approach or accuse him of atheism.

===&quot;Redating the New Testament&quot; (1976)===
Although Robinson was considered a liberal theologian, he challenged the work of like-minded colleagues in the field of exegetical criticism. Specifically, Robinson examined the reliability of the New Testament as he believed that it had been the subject of very little original research during the 20th century. He also wrote that past scholarship was based on a &quot;tyranny of unexamined assumptions&quot; and an &quot;almost wilful blindness&quot;.

Robinson concluded that much of the New Testament was written before AD 64, partly basing his judgement on the sparse textual evidence that the New Testament reflects knowledge of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in AD 70. In relation to the four gospels&#x27; dates of authorship, Robinson placed Matthew as being written sometime between AD 40 and the AD 60s, Mark sometime between AD 45 and AD 60, Luke sometime during the AD 50s and the 60s and John sometime between AD 40 and AD 65 or later. Robinson also argued that the letter of James was penned by a brother of Jesus Christ within twenty years of Jesus&#x27; death, that Paul authored all the books attributed to him, and that the &quot;John&quot; who wrote the fourth Gospel was the apostle John. Robinson also suggested that the results of his investigations implied a need to rewrite many theologies of the New Testament.

In a letter to Robinson, the New Testament scholar C. H. Dodd wrote, &quot;I should agree with you that much of the late dating is quite arbitrary, even wanton[;] the offspring not of any argument that can be presented, but rather of the critic&#x27;s prejudice that, if he appears to assent to the traditional position of the early church, he will be thought no better than a stick-in-the-mud.&quot; Robinson&#x27;s call for redating the New Testamentor, at least, the four gospelswas echoed in subsequent scholarship such as John Wenham&#x27;s work &quot;Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke: A Fresh Assault on the Synoptic Problem&quot; and work by Claude Tresmontant, Günther Zuntz, Carsten Peter Thiede, Eta Linnemann, Harold Riley, Jean Carmignac, and Bernard Orchard.

Bart Ehrman maintains that Robinson&#x27;s early dates for the gospels, especially those for John, have not been taken up among most liberal scholars of Biblical historicity. Some conservative and traditionalist scholars, however, concur with his dating of the synoptic gospels.

===&quot;The Priority of John&quot; (1984)===
In &quot;The Priority of John&quot;, Robinson furthered the argument put forward in &quot;Redating the New Testament&quot; that all the books were written before 70 AD, by focusing on the book that is placed early least often. He also wanted to prove that John is independent of the Synoptics and better than them at describing the length and time period of Jesus&#x27; ministry, Palestinian geography, and the cultural milieu of the early first century there.

This work was put together posthumously by J. F. Coakley according to Robinson&#x27;s basically complete but unfinished notes for his Bampton Lectures.

==Other==
Robinson was also noted for his 1960 court testimony against the censorship of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;, claiming that it was a book which &quot;every Christian should read.&quot;

Robinson&#x27;s legacy includes the work of the now late Episcopal bishop John Shelby Spong in best-selling books that include salutes by Spong to Robinson as a lifelong mentor. In a 2013 interview, Spong recalls reading Robinson&#x27;s 1963 book: 

The Bishop John Robinson School in Thamesmead, south-east London, which is within the area for which he was responsible as Bishop of Woolwich, is named after him.

<text>CodeWarrior is an integrated development environment (IDE) published by NXP Semiconductors for editing, compiling, and debugging software for several microcontrollers and microprocessors (Freescale ColdFire, ColdFire+, Kinetis, Qorivva, PX, Freescale RS08, Freescale S08, and S12Z) and digital signal controllers (DSC MC56F80X and MC5680XX) used in embedded systems.

The system was developed by Metrowerks on the Macintosh, and was among the first development systems on that platform to cleanly support both the existing Motorola 68k and the PowerPC (PPC) instruction set architectures. During Apple&#x27;s transition to PowerPC, CodeWarrior quickly became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard development system for the Mac, rapidly displacing Symantec&#x27;s THINK C and Apple&#x27;s own Macintosh Programmer&#x27;s Workshop. Apple&#x27;s purchase of NeXT in 1996 led to a decline in CodeWarrior&#x27;s relevance as Mac programming moved to the NeXT platform&#x27;s own developer tools: Interface Builder and Project Builder, which were built on top of the GNU Compiler Collection.

Metrowerks responded by porting CodeWarrior to Microsoft Windows and introducing compilers for a wider variety of platforms. It became a major part of the software stack for Motorola&#x27;s varied lines of microcontrollers, and eventually led to them purchasing Metrowerks in 1999. It was widely used on most platforms based on PPC or other Motorola processors, as well as many games consoles. The product moved to Freescale Semiconductor when that company formed in 2004, and then to NXP when they purchased Freescale in 2015.

Originally a single integrated product, now known as the &quot;Classic IDE&quot;, the IDE was later replaced with Eclipse IDE. The current versions are 6.3 of the Classic IDE, and 11.0 for the Eclipse IDE. Languages supported are C, C++, and assembly language.

==History==
===Origins===
In October 1992, John McEnerney, formerly development manager of Symantec&#x27;s Language Products Group, left the company to work on his own on a PowerPC product, initially thinking about a Pascal compiler. Rich Siegel, author of BBEdit, heard that McEnerney had left Symantec and told Greg Galanos of Metrowerks in Montreal. Galanos phoned McEnerney and asked him to &quot;describe your dream job&quot;. McEnerney said he wanted to write a code generator for the new PowerPC (PPC) chip that Apple had announced they would be using in the future.

Metrowerks had already developed Pascal and Modula-II compilers, originally for the Atari ST, but later ported to a number of contemporary machines including the Mac. They flew McEnerney to Montreal to meet with Galanos and his partner Jean Belanger. They felt that there was a huge opportunity for a new toolchain on the PPC, combining their compilers with a new code PPC code generator written by McEnerney. They felt could get to market more rapidly than Symantec, the leading supplier of development systems on the Mac. Symantec was nowhere near the release of their products for PPC, and Apple was using updated versions of their own Macintosh Programmers Workshop (MPW) for development on the PPC, a product that had been ignored for years. McEnerney was interested, but unimpressed with their compilers, and little came of this initial contact.

Around the same time, Andreas Hommel was in university in Germany completing a MS in computer science. He developed an interest in writing computer games in C, but found that existing compilers generated poor-quality code. Over a series of years he developed his own C compiler for the 68k along with a simple integrated development environment (IDE). When he completed university he was offered a job in Hamburg but decided to try to see if there was a market for his compiler. A few months later he received a call from Galanos. After several transatlantic phone calls, Galanos invited Hommel to come to Montreal and discuss working with them.

===Development===
In February 1993, Galanos called McEnerney and asked if they could meet in Palo Alto so McEnerney could review a new C compiler Metrowerks had acquired. McEnerney was extremely impressed; the system looked like early versions of Think C, and was very fast. Describing it as &quot;a diamond in the rough&quot;, McEnerney signed a contract with Metrowerks within hours. Hommel would extend his C compiler to a full C++ implementation while disentangling it from the code generation stage. McEnerney would write a new PPC code generator that would be driven by Hommel&#x27;s compiler. Hommel&#x27;s existing 68K code generator would be used for that platform, slightly modified to support Pascal as well. Berardino Baratta and Marcel Achim in Montreal would continue developing the IDE and develop a Pascal compiler running on the same code generators.

Examining the new system, McEnerney decided to take an entirely new approach to code generation. Typical compilers of the era would repeatedly examine their intermediate representation (IR) producing more and more optimized versions of the code until they finally converted it to machine instructions. This approach was less important for RISC platforms, as the instruction set architecture was much simpler and there was far less work involved in deciding which particular type of instruction to use for a given task. Instead, McEnerney&#x27;s new code generator took the initial IR and converted that directly to PPC code.

The major change was to implement Chaitin&#x27;s algorithm for register use. This system, introduced in 1982, was a landmark development in compiler technique. It allowed a code generator to map local variables to processor registers with very high efficiency. On a machine that relied on register use for performance, which is one of the primary concepts of RISC processors, this technique can lead to huge improvements. The downside is that it is expensive to calculate the results, being an O(N2) process.

To help develop the PPC compiler, Apple&#x27;s Jordan Mattson sent McEnerney one of their RS/6000 systems. By August 1993 the basic system was running. McEnerney got a phone call from a former Symantec colleague, Dan Podwall, who was looking for work at Metrowerks. Galanos called Podwall, who was immediately hired to write a debugger, completed in only four weeks.

A prototype Power Macintosh machine was sent to the company in September 1993. At the time, the main IDE and compiler toolchain was still running on the 68k machines, producing PPC binaries that were then moved to the prototype and debugged. This allowed them to quickly port the system to the PPC, and by December the entire system was ready for production.

===Release===
The system was launched as CodeWarrior at the MacWorld Expo in January 1994. The Power Macs were slated to be launched that month as well, but a series of delays forced this to be set off until the official launch of the Power Mac machines on 14 March.

At the time, both Apple&#x27;s MPW and Symantec&#x27;s Think C ran only on 68k machines, and only MPW was able to generate PPC binaries. Running natively on the PPC, and based on code dedicated to the platform, CodeWarrior offered dramatically higher performance, while allowing one to develop and debug on a single machine. Sales of other development systems ended practically overnight. Symantec, who had owned the Mac development market since 1986, did not release a native PPC version until late March 1995. By this time, several major Mac software vendors had moved to CodeWarrior and Symantec was never able to re-establish any sort of marketshare on the Mac.

CodeWarrior was a key factor in the success of Apple&#x27;s transition of its machine architecture from 68K processors to PowerPC because it provided a complete, solid PowerPC compiler when the competition (Apple&#x27;s MPW tools and Symantec C++) was mostly incomplete or late to the market. Metrowerks also made it easy to generate fat binaries, which included both 68K and PowerPC code.

Java support in CodeWarrior for Macintosh was announced for May 1996, slated for CodeWarrior 9. Metrowerks took the approach to add Java tools support in CodeWarrior, including debugging, rather than write a new IDE.

===Moving to multiple platforms===
In 1997, Apple purchased NeXT in order to use their operating system, OpenStep, as the basis for future Mac products. OpenStep was based around the concept of the entire operating system and all of its applications being built using an internal development system. This was, in turn, based on the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). While CodeWarrior would still be important for developers writing &quot;classic&quot; Mac applications on the platform, there was a clear time frame after which development would primarily be through the new OpenStep platform, and therefore be through the GCC. 

In August 1996, Metrowerks announced CodeWarrior for BeBox, a BeOS version of the IDE named &quot;BeIDE&quot; supplementing the PowerPC compiler that was already available to BeOS software developers.

===Motorola era===
After Metrowerks was acquired by Motorola in 1999, the company concentrated on embedded applications, devoting a smaller fraction of their efforts to compilers for desktop computers. On 29 July 2005, they announced that CodeWarrior for Mac would be discontinued after the next release, CodeWarrior Pro 10. Metrowerks indicated that revenue share of the product fell from 22% to 5% in the last four years and the effort by the company to concentrate on the embedded development market. The demand for CodeWarrior had presumably fallen during the time Apple began distributing Xcode (its own software development kit for OS X) for free. In addition, Apple&#x27;s switch to Intel chips left Metrowerks without an obvious product as they had sold their Intel compiler technology to Nokia earlier in 2005.

During its heyday, the product was known for its rapid release cycle, with multiple revisions every year, and for its quirky advertising campaign. Their &quot;geekware&quot; shirts were featured in the fashion pages of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Old versions==
Prior to the acquisition of the product by Freescale, versions existed targeting Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, Linux, Solaris, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Nintendo DS, Wii, Dreamcast, SuperH, M·CORE, Palm OS, Symbian OS, and BeOS.

Metrowerks versions of CodeWarrior also included Pascal, Object Pascal, Objective-C, and Java compilers.

Older versions of CodeWarrior can be used to develop on classic Mac OS. Classilla is built with Metrowerks CodeWarrior 7.1.

==Origin of the name==
During the 1990s, Apple Computer released a monthly series of developer CD-ROMs containing resources for programming the Macintosh. These CDs were, in the early days, whimsically titled using punning references to various movies but with a coding twist; for example, &quot;The Hexorcist&quot; (&quot;The Exorcist&quot;), &quot;Lord of the Files&quot; (&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;), &quot;Gorillas in the Disc&quot; (&quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;), etc.

One of these, volume 9, was titled &quot;Code Warrior&quot;, referring to the movie &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;. Later Apple dropped the whimsical titling in favor of a more sober &quot;Developer CD series&quot;. Coincidentally the Metrowerks founder, Greg Galanos, an Australian, was also inspired by the movie and proposed the CodeWarrior name. Metrowerks subsequently used the name for their new developer product.

CodeWarrior CD packaging was very much in the tradition of the Apple developer CDs, featuring slogans such as &quot;Blood, Sweat, and Code&quot; and &quot;Veni, Vidi, Codi&quot; in prominent lettering. Competing products such as Symantec&#x27;s THINK C were more conventionally marketed.

==CodeWarrior Latitude==

Metrowerks foresaw as it had with the transition to PowerPC, a need to provide a must have developer tool to help developers transition from MacOS software to Apple&#x27;s future operating system, codenamed Rhapsody.

In 1997, Metrowerks acquired the principal assets of &quot;The Latitude Group Inc.&quot; from David Hempling and his partners. Latitude was a software compatibility layer used to port Macintosh applications to the NeXT Computer and other UNIX systems.

Latitude presented itself as a library that implemented the Macintosh System 7 API in the same way that Lee Lorenzen&#x27;s Altura Mac2Win software as well as Apple&#x27;s own Quicktime for Windows SDK allowed Macintosh applications to be recompiled for Windows with minimal modifications. Latitude had previously been used successfully by Adobe to port Photoshop and Premiere to Silicon Graphics and Solaris workstations.

Metrowerks rebranded Latitude as CodeWarrior Latitude, updated it for Rhapsody starting with Developer Preview 1 and then marketed it to Macintosh developers as a separate product for $399, alongside CodeWarrior Professional.

Latitude Developer Release 1 (DR1) was previewed at WWDC 1997 in the CodeWarrior Lounge. Latitude DR2 was released on Oct 27, 1997 and won an Eddy Award at the 1998 Macworld for Best Tool for New Technologies beating out Joy from AAA+ Software F&amp;E and Visual Cafe for Macintosh 1.0.2 by Symantec.

At the time, Steve Jobs was heavily promoting the OPENSTEP API (renamed &quot;Yellow Box&quot;) in order to access the new features of the operating system. For C/C++/Pascal Macintosh developers, this presented a substantial hurdle because it was markedly different from the classic MacOS API that ran inside &quot;Blue Box&quot; and was Objective-C based. Latitude was for a short time coined as the &quot;Green Box&quot; for obvious reasons and appeared to be another hit for Metrowerks and further solidify its dominance in the Macintosh developer tools market but Apple secretly had plans of its own.

CodeWarrior&#x27;s IDE for Rhapsody and CodeWarrior Latitude were both demonstrated at Worldwide Developers Conference in 1998 in the third party developer pavilion but were quietly discontinued at the show following Steve Jobs keynote address. Apple&#x27;s announcement of its forthcoming Carbon API (codenamed &quot;Ivory Tower&quot;) to appeal to developers who required a practical way to transition to the new operating system eliminated the need for any third-party solutions.

Metrowerks used Latitude internally to port CodeWarrior to run on Red Hat and SuSE Linux for commercial sale and additionally to Solaris under contract from Sun Microsystems. Both products utilized gcc command line compilers rather than Metrowerks own compiler technologies to promote adoption within the UNIX developer community.

The final version of Latitude supported Solaris 2.3, SGI Irix 5.2 and Rhapsody DP2, dropping HP-UX support.

<doc id="595638" wikidata="Q6596375" url="?curid=595638" title="List of San Francisco Bay Area wildflowers">
<text>&#x27;
This is a list of San Francisco Bay Area wildflowers. The San Francisco Bay Area is unusual, for a major metropolitan area, in having ready access to rural and wilderness areas, as well as major urban parks. Particularly in spring, these offer a rich range of wild flowers.

==List scope==
The native plants of the San Francisco Bay Area are not always typical of other regions of California, and some species are endemic. This list covers the flowers of the Bay Area one is most likely to see within its nine counties. It starts with flowers that are (a) common and/or (b) already have an article in Wikipedia. Flowering shrubs and trees are only included if their flowers are visually significant.

==List==
:The list is divided into forbs (herbs), shrubs, and trees.

===Flowering herbs (forbs)===
*California poppy, &quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot;
*Purple Chinese houses, &quot;Collinsia heterophylla&quot;
*Yellow pansy, &quot;Viola pedunculata&quot;
*Franciscan wallflower, &quot;Erysimum franciscanum&quot;
*Douglas iris, &quot;Iris douglasiana&quot;
*Baby blue-eyes, &quot;Nemophila menziesii&quot;
*Coral bells, &quot;Heuchera spp.&quot;
*Western blue-eyed grass, &quot;Sisyrinchium bellum&quot;
*Calypso orchid, &quot;Calypso bulbosa&quot;
*Fiddlenecks, &quot;Amsinckia&quot;
*Blue flax, &quot;Linum lewisii&quot;
*Cow parsnip, &quot;Heracleum maximum&quot;
*Common star lily, &quot;Toxicoscordion fremontii&quot;
*Crimson columbine, &quot;Aquilegia formosa&quot;
*Wavy-leafed soap plant, &quot;Chlorogalum pomeridianum&quot;
*Farewell to spring, &quot;Clarkia amoena&quot;

===Bushes, shrubs, and climbers===
*Bush lupin, &quot;Lupinus ssp.&quot;
*Manzanitas, &quot;Arctostaphylos spp.&quot;
*California wild grape, &quot;Vitis californica&quot;
*California lilacs, &quot;Ceanothus spp.&quot;
*Pipestem clematis, &quot;Clematis lasiantha&quot;
*Salmonberry, &quot;Rubus spectabilis&quot;
*California rose, &quot;Rosa californica&quot;
*California huckleberry, &quot;Vaccinium ovatum&quot;
*California manroot, &quot;Marah fabacea&quot;
*Currants, &quot;Ribes spp.&quot;
*Chaparral currant, &quot;Ribes malvaceum&quot;

===Flowering trees===
*California buckeye, &quot;Aesculus californica&quot;
*Black elderberry, &quot;Sambucus nigra&quot;
*Pacific madrone, &quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot;
*Coast live oak, &quot;Quercus agrifolia&quot;

==Garden escapes==
Garden escapes are introduced species, plants that have established in the area - via their seeds, underground runners, or by exuberant growth - beyond the limits of gardens where planted. Some may be reproducing in the wild as invasive species and noxious weeds. Because of the large population of the Bay Area and its variety of garden styles, many plant species may be encountered as garden escapes. 
:Among those seen are:
*&quot;Acacia&quot; spp.
*&quot;Bougainvillea&quot; spp. 
*Common Broom (Spanish, French, others)
*&quot;Cortaderia&quot; spp. (Pampas grass)
*&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; spp.
*Forget-me-nots (&quot;Myosotis discolor&quot; and &quot;M. latifolia&quot;) 
*Ice plant - several genera
*Ivy - &quot;Hedera&quot; spp.
*Lavender
*&quot;Nassella tenuissima&quot; - Mexican feather grass
*&quot;Pelargonium&quot; spp.
*&quot;Pennisetum setaceum&quot;
*&quot;Rubus armeniacus&quot; – Himalayan Blackberry
*Searocket 
*&quot;Vinca major&quot;

===Weeds===
*Purple salsify
*Artichoke thistle
*Red Valerian 
*Herb Robert 
*Wild radish 
*Scarlet Pimpernel 
*Pale Flax
