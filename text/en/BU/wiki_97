<text>Thuy Trang (December 14, 1973 – September 3, 2001) was a Vietnamese-born actress based in the United States. She was known for her role as Trini Kwan, the original Yellow Ranger on the original cast of the television series &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;.

Trang&#x27;s father was a South Vietnamese army officer who fled the country in 1975 after the fall of Saigon, leaving his family behind. When Trang was six, she and her mother and brothers boarded a cargo ship bound for Hong Kong, a difficult journey during which Trang became very ill. They reunited with Trang&#x27;s father in the United States in 1980 and settled in California. She enrolled at the University of California, Irvine to study civil engineering, but switched her focus to acting after a talent scout spotted her.

Trang was chosen for &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, her first major role, after participating in an audition process that included about 500 actresses. Like the other cast members, Trang mostly portrayed her character in scenes when she was out of her Power Rangers uniform; the in-costume fight scenes were footage adapted from the long-running Japanese television series &quot;Super Sentai&quot;, with Trang&#x27;s voice dubbed over the action. Trang appeared in 80 episodes in the series, which included the entire first season, and the first twenty episodes of the second. She performed many of her own stunts, and was repeatedly hurt on the set.

Trang left &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; in the middle of the second season, along with fellow cast members Austin St. John and Walter Emanuel Jones, due to contractual and payment disputes and was replaced by Karan Ashley as a new Yellow Ranger named Aisha Campbell. She had a brief appearance in the film &quot;Spy Hard&quot; (1996), and played one of the lead villains in the film &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot; (1996). Trang had planned to appear in several films along with St. John and Jones, but none were ultimately made. Trang died in a car crash at the age of 27.

==Early life==
Thùy Trang was born in Saigon, South Vietnam, now Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, on December 14, 1973, to father Ky Trang and mother Be Trang. She had two brothers and one sister. Her father, a South Vietnamese army (ARVN) officer, was tasked with protecting Saigon from communist North Vietnamese army. After the fall of Saigon in 1975, he was forced to leave his family behind and fled the country, immigrating to the United States. Trang and her family lived in a detention camp as her father petitioned the U.S. government for political asylum for his family. They fled Saigon when Trang was two years old.

In 1979 when Trang was five, she and her family secretly boarded a cargo ship bound for Hong Kong. It was a very difficult journey, with people packed tightly due to limited space, lacking in food and water. The trip lasted about eight or nine months, and at least four people died. Trang went long periods of time without eating and fell ill, with her mother having to force food down her throat while she was unconscious to keep her alive. At one point, the other passengers wrongly believed Trang to be dead and wanted to throw her body overboard to make more room for the other refugees, but her mother prevented them from doing so. Trang&#x27;s family and her father were eventually reunited in the United States in 1980, and settled in the city of Fountain Valley, California.

Trang did not speak English upon first arriving in the United States and had to learn it. Trang began studying Shaolin kung fu, and eventually received a black belt. Trang said of studying kung fu:

It&#x27;s really good because it builds a lot of character and it makes me stronger as a person, especially going through all the stuff I went through, coming over here to America. It just teaches me a lot about who I am and what I am, and about respect, discipline, patience, and perseverance, and endurance.

Trang&#x27;s father died in 1992 when she was 18. She graduated from Banning High School in the Wilmington neighborhood of Los Angeles, and enrolled at the University of California, Irvine to study civil engineering, planning to follow her father and siblings into the field. Trang&#x27;s hobbies included playing tennis, jogging, and reading romance novels. She also had a dog named Nia. Trang switched her focus to acting after a chance run in with a talent scout while hanging out with friends. This led to an introductory acting class at UCI in 1992 where she was spotted for a commercial for the Church of Scientology, even though she herself was a Buddhist. Trang, the first person in her family to study acting, said she intended to later finish her education despite undertaking an acting career.

==Career==
===&quot;Power Rangers&quot;===
Trang earned her first major role in 1993, as Trini Kwan, the Yellow Ranger in the original cast of the TV series &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;. Her agent arranged for her to participate in an audition process that included about 500 actresses of various races. Casting director Katy Wallin said the day of Trang&#x27;s screen test, &quot;Thuy was so nervous that she almost couldn&#x27;t complete her final callback.&quot; She was paired with Jason David Frank, the martial arts instructor and actor who went on to portray the Green Ranger Tommy Oliver, during the audition. It took place before a room of about 20 executives and required each actor to read the part and present their physical skills. Wallin told Trang to run into the room screaming, jump onto the audition table, and perform a karate move. Trang did so, then quietly stepped off the table, did her reading, and walked out of the room. Wallin said of her screen test: &quot;I loved her and was very proud of her fearless approach to becoming the Yellow Ranger.&quot; The pool of finalists for the part was narrowed down to 10 actresses, then five, then three, before Trang was finally selected.
The role was originated by actress Audri Dubois in the pilot episode before Trang took over the part. After securing the role, Trang moved from Fountain Valley to Los Angeles to be closer to the set of the show, which she found to be a major adjustment. Trang described her character as having &quot;quick hands and a peaceful soul&quot;, and felt the character was inspiring for viewers who have long desired an Asian superhero: &quot;Asians are not portrayed in the media very well, and there are not many roles for Asian people except for the stereotypes – gangsters, hookers, things like that. A lot of older Asian people come up to me and say that I&#x27;m doing a service to the Asian community.&quot;

While Trang and the other cast members appeared in scenes with the characters out of the Power Rangers costumes, the in-costume fight scenes were footage adapted from the long-running Japanese television series &quot;Super Sentai&quot;. In that series, the Yellow Ranger was a male character, but the American show producers wanted more female characters in their cast, so they changed the character to a female during out-of-costume scenes and dubbed Trang&#x27;s voice over the male actor&#x27;s performance in the Japanese scenes. This is why the Yellow Ranger costume does not have a skirt like the Pink Ranger, who was female in both the Japanese and American versions of the show. The decision to put Trang, an Asian American actress, into the role of Yellow Ranger has received criticism and been the subject of jokes due to the connotation of yellow as an ethnic slur. Producers have said that race had nothing to do with colors of the costumes.

Trang appeared in 80 episodes in the series, which included the entire first season and a portion of the second season. Trang performed many of her own stunts. She jogged and exercised regularly during her time on the show to stay in shape, and received training from martial arts experts on the set, including Jason David Frank. New to the acting profession, Trang said she learned a great deal during her time on the show: &quot;I&#x27;m finding that acting is all about being honest and truthful in every moment. The camera is so close that it sees everything, so if you&#x27;re truthful and honest, the audience will know.&quot; She believed the show conveyed positive messages to children, particularly about teamwork and having self-confidence. Trang became close friends with co-star Amy Jo Johnson, and the two would often have slumber parties at each other&#x27;s houses. They were together when the 1994 Northridge earthquake struck, which badly frightened both women, but they were forced to go to the studio for filming that day anyway; no scenes were ultimately shot because the crew did not arrive. Trang was repeatedly hurt on the set of the show, and often had to be physically carried by others during shooting because of injuries. Jason David Frank said of her injuries: &quot;She put her all into the scenes, so sometimes things happen.&quot;

Trang left &quot;Power Rangers&quot; in the middle of the second season, along with fellow cast members Austin St. John and Walter Emanuel Jones, due to contractual and payment disputes. The actors were receiving non-union pay, in the amount of about $60,000 per year without any compensation for merchandising for the show, which was estimated to be worth about $1 billion. Trang, St. John, and Jones were all represented by agent Ingrid Wang, and they requested more compensation and union recognition. Amy Jo Johnson later expressed regret that she and the other cast members did not join the three departing cast members in calling for union wages and recognition, wondering if all of them standing together may have led to a different result. Within the show, the actors&#x27; departure was explained by their characters being chosen as representatives in an international &quot;Peace Conference&quot; in Switzerland. Trang, St. John, and Jones released a joint statement about their departure:

&quot;Opposites Attract&quot;, the 20th episode of season two, was the final &quot;Power Rangers&quot; episode in which Trang personally appeared; her character appears in episodes 21 through 28, but only in costumed form and not portrayed by Trang. Trang&#x27;s character&#x27;s departure was explained in the two-part episode &quot;The Power Transfer&quot;, in which the powers of the Red, Black, and Yellow Rangers are transferred to new characters using an ancient magical artifact called the Sword of Light. Archival and deleted footage of St. John, Jones, and Trang were used in these episodes. Trang was replaced as the Yellow Ranger by Karan Ashley, who was chosen from an audition process that included 4,000 actors in five cities seeking the three vacated roles. Jackie Marchand, a writer and producer with the series, said the departure of the three actors was &quot;a difficult shift, and it was pretty intense at the office&quot;. Margaret Loesch, president of Fox Children&#x27;s Network, released a statement about Trang and the other departing actors: &quot;We will always consider them part of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; family.&quot; Trang said of her departure: &quot;The show was great, it gave me a lot of experience; but it&#x27;s time to move on, and I&#x27;m focusing on doing feature films and becoming more serious of an actress.&quot;

===Post-&quot;Power Rangers&quot;===
On January 4, 1995, Trang and her &quot;Power Rangers&quot; co-stars St. John and Jones hosted an informational session about martial arts at the United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C., where they taught basic techniques to Newt Gingrich and other members of the United States House of Representatives from the 104th United States Congress. Trang and St. John were interviewed on &quot;The Encyclopedia of Martial Arts&quot;, a 1995 documentary that explored the history of Asian martial arts and the role they have played in the Hollywood film industry. Trang made cameo appearances in martial arts videos made by St. John and Jones. Trang, St. John, and Jones also planned to unite for a live touring stage and arena show. She made a guest appearance at the Little Saigon Tet Festival, an event honoring Vietnamese culture, in Westminster, California, on February 4, 1995. During the festival, she spoke about her time on &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, other aspects of her career, and her experiences trying to break into film and television as an Asian-American actress.

Trang&#x27;s first film role was a manicurist in the 1996 movie &quot;Spy Hard.&quot; Trang was mistakenly credited as playing a masseuse in the film; her screen credit was accidentally switched with Tara Leon, who played a masseuse in the same short scene but was credited as a manicurist. Trang later played a lead villain, Kali, in the feature film &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot;, also released in 1996. She was not cast until very late in the pre-production process, right before filming began. Trang played Kali, a member of a gang led by notorious drug kingpin Judah Earl, who killed the protagonist, mechanic Ashe Corven, and his eight-year-old son after they witnessed Judah&#x27;s henchmen murdering a fellow drug dealer. Trang&#x27;s character was killed by a resurrected Corven after a fight scene. Dougal Macdonald, a writer with &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; who was otherwise critical of the film, described Trang as &quot;deliciously evil&quot;. Other reviewers were more negative about Trang&#x27;s performance: &quot;The Advocate&quot; writer John Wirt called her &quot;a flop&quot;, and Jon Bowman of &quot;The Santa Fe New Mexican&quot; said her &quot;sneer is her most pronounced feature&quot;.

Trini Kwan was included as a cameo in an early draft of &quot;&quot; (1997), but Kwan&#x27;s scene was cut from the final film. Trang had planned to appear in several films in the mid-1990s along with her &quot;Power Rangers&quot; co-stars St. John and Jones, including &quot;Cyberstrike&quot;, &quot;Act of Courage&quot;, and &quot;Children of Merlin&quot;, the latter of which was to be developed by Landmark Entertainment Group. None of the three films were ultimately made. Additionally, Trang was expected to appear in a TV show called &quot;The Adventures of Tracie Z&quot;, which also never came to fruition, though a pilot was apparently filmed.

==Death==

On September 3, 2001, Trang was traveling with her friend, then-actress and model Angela Rockwood, for whom Trang was to be a bridesmaid in her upcoming marriage to Dustin Nguyen. They were passengers in a car traveling on Interstate 5 between San Jose and Los Angeles. The driver, another bridesmaid named Steffiana de la Cruz, struck some loose gravel in a groove along the side of the road, and lost control of the vehicle. The car swerved violently across the road before hitting the roadside rock face, flipping several times before hitting the safety rail and plunging over the bank and into a second rock face. Rockwood was thrown 35 feet out of the car and survived, but her spinal cord was severed and she was rendered paraplegic., the driver also survived the crash, and Trang suffered internal injuries. A helicopter arrived to take her to the hospital, but she died while in transit.

Trang&#x27;s body was cremated a week later on September 10, and her ashes were either scattered or interred at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California, though there is no headstone for her. Her &quot;Power Rangers&quot; co-stars Amy Jo Johnson and David Yost attended the funeral and memorial service. Fellow co-star Jason David Frank could not attend due to the death of his older brother, but he sent his condolences to Trang&#x27;s family. Fellow co-stars Walter Emanuel Jones and Austin St. John also sent condolences. Jones said of Trang: &quot;It hurt my heart to lose her. She was way too young and had so much more to share with the world. ... Her energy drew you in, and her smile made your heart feel safe.&quot; Johnson said: &quot;I&#x27;ll always remember her spunky, strong personality. She was such a bright light. It&#x27;s hard to believe she&#x27;s gone.&quot; The episode &quot;Circuit Unsure&quot; of &quot;Power Rangers Time Force&quot;, the first &quot;Power Rangers&quot; episode to air after her death, was dedicated to Trang&#x27;s memory, as was the 2023 special &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;, which was also dedicated to Frank, who had committed suicide in November 2022.

==Legacy==
In the 2017 film adaptation of the original series, the Trini Kwan character, portrayed by singer Becky G, has a scene wearing a T-shirt with &quot;1973&quot; on it, the year of Trang&#x27;s birth, as an homage to the original actress. Austin St. John, Trang&#x27;s co-star from the original series, said of the new film: &quot;One of the hardest roles for me to accept was Trini&#x27;s role because Thuy is gone now. It would be tough for me to see anybody in that role.&quot;

Some fans were offended by marketing posters for the film that they considered disrespectful to Trang&#x27;s memory. The promo showed an image of the Becky G&#x27;s Yellow Ranger standing on her Zord, along with the text &quot;Driver&#x27;s Ed not required.&quot; Several fans responded on the social media platforms Facebook and Twitter that the message was offensive because Trang died in a car crash, with some users replying with the hashtag &quot;#JusticeforThuy&quot;. The official Twitter account of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise removed the posts in response to the criticism, although international distributor eOne Films, which had also released the same tweets, did not remove them.

The film &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;, which was produced to celebrate the franchise&#x27;s 30th anniversary, is dedicated to the memory of Trang and Jason David Frank. The special was written and filmed with Trang&#x27;s legacy in mind and focuses on the aftermath of the 1993 series&#x27; in-universe death of Trini Kwan. Frank died while the film was in production, leading to the use of additional stock footage and a joint dedication.

<text>An English muffin is a small, round and flat yeast-leavened (sometimes sourdough) bread which is commonly round and tall. It is generally split horizontally and served toasted. In North America, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, it is frequently eaten with sweet or savoury toppings such as butter, fruit jam, honey, eggs, sausage, bacon, or cheese. English muffins are an essential ingredient in eggs Benedict and a variety of breakfast sandwiches derived from it, such as the McMuffin.

These products are called &quot;English muffins&quot; to distinguish them from the sweeter cupcake-shaped products also known as muffins, although in the UK, English muffins are sometimes referred to simply as &quot;muffins&quot;. English muffins are available in a wide range of varieties, including whole wheat, multigrain, cinnamon raisin, cranberry, and apple cinnamon.

==Origin==
The word &quot;muffin&quot; is thought to come from the Low German , meaning &quot;little cakes&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; also suggests a possible link to Old French , a type of bread. Originally it meant &quot;any of various kinds of bread or cake&quot;.

The first recorded use of the word &quot;muffin&quot; was in 1703, and recipes for muffins appear in British cookbooks as early as 1747 in Hannah Glasse&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Cookery&quot;. The muffins are described by Glasse as being &quot;like a Honey-comb&quot; inside.

In the &quot;Oxford Companion to Food&quot;, Alan Davidson states that &quot;[t]here has always been some confusion between muffins, crumpets, and pikelets, both in recipes and in name&quot;. The increasing popularity of flatbread muffins in the 19th century is attested by the existence of muffin men, a type of hawker who would travel door to door selling English muffins as a snack bread before most homes had their own ovens.

===Bell ringing===

The bell-ringing of muffin men became so common that by 1839, the British Parliament passed a bill to prohibit bell ringing by muffin men, but it was not adhered to by sellers. In 1861, &quot;goodsized&quot; muffins from street-sellers were commonly sold for a halfpenny each; crumpets were about a penny.

Comparing the bell-ringing of muffin men to the melodic chimes from an approaching ice cream van that generates excitement in children today, Michael Paterson in &quot;A Brief History of Life in Victorian Britain&quot; writes, “the ringing of a handbell was one of the most joyous sounds in a Victorian childhood”. The tradition of the muffin man continued until the Second World War.

==In popular culture==
The traditional English nursery rhyme &quot;The Muffin Man&quot;, which dates from 1820 at the latest, traces to that custom.

A well-known reference to English muffins is in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s 1895 play &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;.

==By country==
===United Kingdom===

English muffins are usually referred to simply as &quot;muffins&quot; in the UK; sweet American-style cupcake-shaped muffins are occasionally referred to as &quot;American muffins&quot; to differentiate. They are usually consumed with tea or coffee, and sometimes feature in afternoon tea served in UK hotels. They are also consumed for breakfast in the form of American-style breakfast sandwiches.

===United States===
&quot;Mush muffins (called &quot;slipperdowns&quot; in New England) were a Colonial [American] muffin made with hominy on a hanging griddle.&quot; These and other types of flatbread muffins were known to American settlers, but they declined in popularity with the advent of the quickbread muffin.

References to English muffins appear in U.S. newspapers starting in 1859, and detailed descriptions of them and recipes were published as early as 1870.

A popular brand of English muffin in the U.S. is Thomas&#x27;, which was founded in Manhattan, New York, by English immigrant Samuel Bath Thomas in 1880. Thomas opened a second bakery around the corner from the first at 337 West 20th Street in a building that remains known as &quot;The Muffin House&quot;. Today the company is owned by Bimbo Bakeries USA, which also owns the Entenmann&#x27;s, Boboli, Stroehmann, Oroweat, and Arnold brands.

Foster&#x27;s sourdough English muffins was a popular brand of English muffin originally from San Francisco. They were a signature menu item at Foster&#x27;s restaurants from the 1940s to the 1970s, and continued to be produced as a packaged brand until 2008.

===Portugal===
English muffins are very similar to the Portuguese .

<text>Sassafras () is a locality and township within Greater Melbourne, beyond the Melbourne metropolitan area Urban Growth Boundary, 43 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Knox and Shire of Yarra Ranges local government areas. Sassafras recorded a population of 970 at the 2021 census.

==Location==
The Sassafras village is located at an altitude of approximately 500 metres, in a saddle on the top of the ridgeline of the Dandenong Ranges, a few kilometres south of the highest peak of Mount Dandenong.

The locality of Sassafras extends from Hilton Road in the south, to just north of the village. In the east, it extends down the Sassafras Gully, whilst to the West much of the locality is within the Dandenong Ranges National Park.

==History==
The area was named Sassafras Gully, after the sassafras trees which grow in gully along Sassafras Creek. The land was opened to small scale farming in 1893 and a small township developed. The Post Office opened on 1 June 1901 and has always been known as Sassafras Gully. The Sassafras Primary School was established in 1894, originally meeting in a bark slab hut, before relocating to the Sassafras Mechanics Institute hall in 1895. The school moved to its present site in 1915. In the early 1900s tourism began to increase and the township consequently grew. Artist Henrietta Maria Gulliver established a garden estate called Panteg there in 1915. Today Sassafras is a tourist destination with several boutique stores including Devonshire tea outlets, cafés, toy shops, antique shops and nurseries.

The area has had a history of bushfires, and areas near the town are known to have burnt since the 1850s, most recently in 1962.

==Waterways==

Sassafras village is on the watershed between the Yarra River Catchment and the Dandenong Creek. Sassafras Creek is located to the east of the township while tributaries of the Dandenong Creek are west and north of the township. Both creeks provide important corridors for native flora and fauna, and are both largely protect by parklands.

Sassafras Creek flows generally east until it meets Ti-Tree Creek, where they joint to form the Woori Yallock Creek. Woori-Yallock Creek then flows northward to eventually join the Yarra River next to the Warramate Nature Conservation Reserve. Sassafras Creek&#x27;s Riparian Zone is almost entirely protected by public land, which in this case is Dandenong Ranges National Park.

Tributaries of the Dandenong Creek rise on the western face of the Dandenong Ranges and flow west to Dandenong Creek, where it flows southward into the Patterson River and then into Port Phillip Bay at Patterson Lakes.

==Natural environment==

Sassafras Creek is protected by the Sassafras Creek Nature Conservation Reserve, which is nowadays incorporated into the Dandenong Ranges National Park.
Sassafras has many exotic flora largely due to the fertile volcanic soils. Most private land contains exotic flora.

The Dandenong Ranges Tourist Track, a walking trail, runs for 15 km alongside the Sassafras Creek, past Kallista and Monbulk to Emerald.

<text>Selby is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 37 km east from Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Selby recorded a population of 1,626 at the .

The town hosts the second station on the narrow-gauge railway to Gembrook (now the Puffing Billy Railway).

==History==
The settlement of Selby occurred in conjunction with Menzies Creek, a short distance to the east. After the narrow-gauge railway opened in 1900, the provision of a station in May 1904 required a name. Selby was chosen, as a compliment to a local landowner and councillor, George Selby. The post office opened on 1 August 1913, closing in 1994.

The land around Selby is particularly hilly, as evidenced by the curves in both the road and the railway. The eastern side of the township is dominated by the steep Black Hill, on which there is a reserve. Whilst the topography put restraints on farming it attracted tourists and weekenders. In the 1920s Selby&#x27;s weekend population rivalled Belgrave&#x27;s, but scarcity of subdivided land drew holiday makers and others away from Selby. Some notable Melburnians built homes in Selby, and the Carlotta Tye memorial Anglican church commemorates the wife of Allen Tye, son of George Tye, owner of a Melbourne furniture emporium.

Selby&#x27;s proximity to Belgrave ultimately attracted residential subdivisions, and a primary school was built in 1951. The township has several reserves and is home to the first Neighbourhood House in the area. Sadly the general store has been closed for several years.

Following a landslide beyond Selby in 1953, the narrow-gauge railway fell into disuse as a regular railway and was closed the following year, only to be re-opened in 1962 as the current Puffing Billy Railway. Regular trains only stop at Selby if required, but this is rare.

Selby&#x27;s census population rose from 159 in 1933 to 1,652 in 2016.

Wildlife abounds in and around Selby. King parrots, galahs, yellow-tailed black cockatoos, black wallabies, echidnas, koalas and wombats are often sighted. Visits from barking owls have been recorded as recently as 2005.

==Business==

Selby has, amongst other businesses, a medical practice &amp; creative production agency OBG Productions.

==Facilities==

Selby contains a CFA fire brigade, established in 1926, whose area of primary protection includes the township of Selby, parts of the Dandenong Ranges National Park, farmland, and other areas of bushland both private and public. A new fire station was built on the existing site and opened in 2019 with a Welcome to Country and Smoking Ceremony by Wurundjeri Elder Uncle Dave Wandin and State Government Minister for Emergency Services, the Hon. James Merlino. 

It also includes a community house, established in 1975, which offers community development as well as educational, IT services and other community lead courses.

Selby Primary School was established in 1951. Puffing Billy and the historic trestle bridge are featured on the school logo. The school population has levelled out around 320 students.

Seville sits within the Yarra Valley wine region. It is serviced by bus 683 from Chirnside Park to Warburton via Lilydale railway station. The township sits on a dismantled railway line which is now the Warburton Trail, a vibrant community resource used by walkers, runners, cyclists and horse riders.

A plan for a large scale shopping centre in the land adjacent to the service station was put forward to the council (June 2011) and was finally opened in June 2014.

The town has a primary school, which celebrated its centenary in 1987. It also has an active fire brigade, the Seville CFA. An active community learning centre, the Seville Community House provides short courses and classes on a wide variety of subjects.

The Seville Recreation Reserve is the hub for all sporting activities within the town and is home for football, netball, tennis &amp; cricket teams that compete in local competitions every weekend of the year as well as equestrian activities. The Seville Reserve also has ample space for passive leisure activities undertaken by the local community and visitors to the town.

In 2011, the Seville Water Play Park was opened and is a unique way to experience and play with water.

The town is home to many wineries, which are highlighted in Shedfest, held annually on the second weekend of October.

The Seville Township Group is a local advocacy community group, dedicated to improving Seville for the local community and surrounds.

<doc id="609395" wikidata="Q2580436" url="?curid=609395" title="MAC-11">
<text>The Military Armament Corporation Model 11, officially abbreviated as &quot;M11&quot; or &quot;M-11&quot;, and commonly known as the MAC-11, is a machine pistol/submachine gun developed by American firearm designer Gordon Ingram at the Military Armament Corporation (MAC) during the 1970s in Powder Springs, Georgia, United States. The weapon is a sub-compact version of the Model 10 (MAC-10), and is chambered to fire the smaller .380 ACP round.

This weapon is sometimes confused with the Sylvia &amp; Wayne Daniels M-11/9, its successor the Leinad PM-11, or the Vulcan M-11-9, both of which are later variants of the MAC chambered for the 9 mm Parabellum cartridge. Cobray also made a .380 ACP variant called the M12.

==Design==
===Operation===
Like the larger M-10, the M-11 has iron sights with the rear pinhole sight welded to the receiver. These sights are for use with the folding stock, as using them without the stock is nearly useless because of the initial jump of the weapon due to its heavy, open-bolt design. The M-11A1 also has two safety features which are also found on the Model 10A1. The charging handle rotates to 90 degrees to lock the bolt in the forward position thus preventing the weapon from being cocked. The second safety is a slider that is pushed forward to lock the trigger, which in turn pins the bolt to the rear (cocked) position. This prevents the weapon from discharging even when dropped, which is not uncommon with an open-bolt design.

===Performance===
The rate of fire of the M-11A1 is one of the biggest complaints about the firearm. Listed as 1,200 rounds per minute, the MAC-11&#x27;s high cyclic rate is able to empty the entire 32-round magazine in about two seconds, which many users view as a drawback. Extreme trigger discipline is required to discharge short bursts, which are required for combat effectiveness. Without proper training, the natural tendency of the inexperienced shooter is to hold down the trigger, discharging the entire magazine, often with poor accuracy due to recoil. The rate of fire also varies depending on the weight of bullets used. The gun also has a selector switch that allows it to fire only one round at a time in semi-automatic mode.

Noting the weapon&#x27;s poor accuracy, in the 1970s International Association of Police Chiefs weapons researcher David Steele described the MAC series as &quot;fit only for combat in a phone booth&quot;.

The M-11 is the least common version in the MAC family of firearms.

===Sound suppressor===

A specific suppressor was developed for the MAC-11, which used wipes as baffles, instead of the reflex baffles that Mitchell WerBell III created for the MAC-10. Though wipes are less durable than reflex baffles, they had the advantage of proving quieter for the MAC-11. The suppressor is long and is covered with Nomex, a heat-resistant material.

== Manufacturers ==
MAC-type submachine guns and semi-automatic pistols were first manufactured by the Military Armament Corporation, and later by RPB Inc., Cobray (later named Leinad, then Sylvia/Wayne Daniel Inc.), Jersey Arms, MasterPiece Arms, and Vulcan.

==Users==
* : In 1972, 20 were acquired for police and intelligence services. A further 24 were acquired for the Army and air force in 1973.

Koch has been the chairman of the Port Adelaide Football Club, an Australian Football League (AFL) club since October 2012.

==Early life and education ==

David James Koch was born in Adelaide, South Australia to a Jewish family. 

He trained as an accountant.

== Financial journalism ==
Koch started as a cadet on the business pages of &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper before joining &quot;BRW&quot; magazine soon after its launch in the early 1980s. He was one of the founders of consumer finance journalism in Australia and created &quot;Personal Investment&quot; magazine, which made him the youngest editor in the Fairfax Media group. He then launched &quot;Personal Investment&quot; magazines in New Zealand and the UK. He produced Britain&#x27;s first &quot;rich list&quot; which started in &quot;Money Magazine&quot; which he had bought for Fairfax.

In 1988, he launched trade publishing group Australian Financial Press in a joint venture with Fairfax. AFP went on to create &quot;Business Magazine&quot;, &quot;New Accountant&quot; and &quot;Money Management&quot; magazines.

He provides business and financial commentary for several publications, including Pacific Magazines, Yahoo Finance, and the &quot;Your Money&quot; section of News Ltd newspapers.

Koch was a director of the NSW Small Business Development Corporation Ltd for eight years after its inception in 1996. As a former business owner and operator and now director of Pinstripe Media Pty Ltd, he speaks regularly at corporate events about small business, finance and investment issues.

Koch has presented a weekly small business program on the Seven Network, &quot;Kochie&#x27;s Business Builders&quot;. It was produced by Koch&#x27;s company Pinstripe Media.

In 2013, Koch launched KBB Digital, a digital marketing agency for small business which is an extension of the Kochie&#x27;s Business Builders brand. 

In 2020, in partnership with Kylie Merritt, Koch launched ausbiz, an Australian business and finance streaming platform. 

In August 2023, Koch joined Compare the Market Australia as an economic director.

==Television career==

=== Sunrise ===
Koch was co-host of Seven Network&#x27;s Sunrise breakfast program for 21 years, from 2002 until 2023. He was initially hired to replace Chris Reason who stepped down after a cancer diagnosis towards the end of 2002; however, his position later became permanent. He and his original co-host, Melissa Doyle, hosted the program over a period that saw viewer ratings grow until &quot;Sunrise&quot; became the leading breakfast television show in Australia.

In August 2022, the Seven Network released a statement declaring Sunrise had won the breakfast TV ratings in its timeslot for the 19th year in a row.

Koch announced on 28 May 2023 that he would leave the program to spend time with family and to manage the Port Adelaide Football Club. After a 21-year tenure, he is Australia&#x27;s longest-serving breakfast television host, having broadcast 16,000 hours of live TV across 5,300 shows, and conducted 50,000 interviews. Matt Shirvington was announced as his replacement on 5 June 2023. His last broadcast was on 9 June 2023.

=== Other ===
Koch also co-hosted another Seven Network production, &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot;, also with then-&quot;Sunrise&quot; co-host Melissa Doyle. He also hosts a show for small businesses, &quot;Kochie&#x27;s Business Builders&quot;, which airs on Sundays on the Seven Network.

He has also co-hosted Seven Network&#x27;s annual Christmas TV special Carols in the Domain eight times between 2014 and 2022.

==Recognition==

Koch was nominated for a silver Logie in 2004 and 2005 for Best TV Presenter. 

In 2007, readers of &quot;Banking and Finance Magazine&quot; voted Koch Australia&#x27;s Best Finance Journalist, while the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia presented him with the &quot;Small Business Champion award&quot; in recognition of his support of Australian small business.

Koch was named 2007 Australian Father of the Year by the Australian Father&#x27;s Day Council on 31 August 2007.

Koch was honoured with the Order of Australia (AM) in 2024, &quot;for significant service to media as a television presenter and to economic journalism&quot;.

=== Parodies ===
After he had published a book of jokes compiled from his daily joke segment on TV, the book was parodied in an episode of &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot; where reading jokes from &quot;Kochie&quot; was the only thing that got a laugh at a stand-up comedy club. 

Koch was frequently parodied on the television show &quot;Comedy Inc.&quot;, in which he was played by Paul McCarthy. &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; listed him in the top 50 Most Trusted Australians.
== Port Adelaide Football Club ==

Koch was the number one ticket-holder of Australian Football League team Port Adelaide Football Club from 2007, jointly with Australian model and actress Teresa Palmer in 2009. 

On 2 October 2012, Koch was announced as the chairman of the club, effective from the beginning of 2013, succeeding Brett Duncanson.

== Other activities ==
Koch appeared on Australian soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot; in 2007 and appeared on &quot;All Saints&quot; in 2004 as an Elvis impersonator. 

He played the voice of the News Report in the Australian version of the 2009 DreamWorks film, &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot;. 

In October 2014, Koch launched his website rescue competition (Rescue My Website), to help change the digital lives of three Australian small businesses.

He has climbed Mt Kilimanjaro twice to raise money for charity and walked the Kokoda Track.

==Philanthropy==

Koch is a patron of Youth Off The Streets&#x27; Koch Centre For Youth and Learning in Sydney&#x27;s Macquarie Fields, which opened in 2011.

He has also been involved with the Channel Seven Perth Telethon, an annual event raising money for charities, including the Perth Children&#x27;s Hospital and Melbourne&#x27;s Good Friday Appeal, raising money for the Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital. Koch has been involved in 13 consecutive Good Friday Appeal fundraisers.

Through a &quot;Sunrise&quot; campaign and his involvement in ShareLife, Koch influenced the federal government to establish a national authority (the Organ &amp; Tissue Authority) to oversee Australia&#x27;s organ transplant system. Previously Australia had the highest level of registered organ donors per head of population in the world but one of the lowest transplant rates. The new national authority aims to bring Australian transplant rates up to world&#x27;s best practice. Koch was Chairman of the &#x27;Organ and Tissue Authority Advisory Council&#x27; but resigned on-air, during a &quot;Sunrise&quot; broadcast on 27 May 2015, in protest over a government review of organ donation. Assistant Health Minister Fiona Nash had failed to advise him about the review.

==Controversy==
In May 2006, Koch and then &quot;Sunrise&quot; co-host Melissa Doyle were acquitted of contempt of court charges in a Melbourne Local Court after the name of a 14-year-old boy was published in a case in which the boy sought an irreconcilable differences order against his parents. The Seven Network and the show&#x27;s producer were convicted of the offence.

On 18 January 2013, Koch attracted criticism after he made comments about breastfeeding, which were condemned by media consultant Mia Freedman.

On 16 October 2018, Koch made a &quot;clumsy&quot; joke in relation to slavery when reviewing a segment about Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt training with the Central Coast Mariners (a soccer team) in Australia&#x27;s A-League. There was extensive backlash about the incident on social media.

On 18 March 2019, Koch was criticised by viewers for allegedly bullying One Nation Leader Pauline Hanson on the Sunrise program.

Koch&#x27;s name and image have been falsely used in several online scams in Australia, which Koch warned &quot;Sunrise&quot; viewers about in January 2023.

<text>Sherbrooke is a locality in Victoria, Australia, 35 km east of Melbourne, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Sherbrooke recorded a population of 294 at the .

Permanent European settlement began with Robert W. Graham, an ex sea captain (born 1836 in Ludlow, Shropshire England) who spent eight years living in Quebec, Canada, before migrating to Australia with his family. He built a small house , hand-cut from the forest, using horizontal-slab wall construction, an adobe floor, weatherboards and a sapling/shingle roof. Now noted as the &#x27;father of Sherbrooke&#x27;, Graham named the area after Sherbrooke the location near his place of residence in Canada. He is also credited with discovering Sherbrooke Falls, originally named Graham falls. He was the first Post Master of Sherbrooke, the position he held from 1894 until his death in 1918. A rough hut at the back of the house, with a delivery slot cut in the door, served as the first post office. Both the house and the post office building still stand.

In March 2019, “Burnham Beeches”, a 1930s art deco property owned by celebrity chef Shannon Bennett, was transformed into an art installation by street artist Rone aka Tyrone Wright. Originally the home of industrialist Alfred Nicholas and his family, it later served as a research facility, a children&#x27;s hospital, and a luxury hotel. It is again slated for conversion into a luxury hotel, beginning in mid-2019.

==Flora==
Sherbrooke Forest, a cool temperate rainforest, is listed as endangered and is protected by the state&#x27;s Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act. It is a habitat of the tallest flowering plant in the world, Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans), which can exceed 100 metres in height.

==Fauna==
Sherbrooke Forest has populations of swamp wallabies, wombats, platypus, echidnas and several species of possums and gliders. It is also a habitat of the lyrebird. Other birds found in the area include Galahs, Long-billed and Little Corellas, Australian King-Parrots, Crimson Rosellas and Sulphur-crested Cockatoos.

<text>Louis de Bernières (born 8 December 1954) is an English novelist. He is known for his 1994 historical war novel &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot;. In 1993 de Bernières was selected as one of the &quot;20 Best of Young British Novelists&quot;, part of a promotion in &quot;Granta&quot; magazine. &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot; was published in the following year, winning the Commonwealth Writers Prize for Best Book. It was also shortlisted for the 1994 Sunday Express Book of the Year. It has been translated into at least 11 languages and is an international best-seller.

On 2008, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by De Montfort University in Leicester, which he had attended when it was Leicester Polytechnic.

Politically, he identifies himself as Eurosceptic and has voiced his support for the United Kingdom&#x27;s exit from the European Union.

== Biography ==
Louis H. P. de Bernières-Smart was born near Woolwich in London in 1954 and grew up in Surrey. The name &quot;de Bernières&quot; is inherited from a French Huguenot ancestor. He was educated at Grenham House school—where he reported the pupils were subjected to &quot;hellish abuse&quot;—and at Bradfield College, and joined the army when he was 18, but left after four months of the officer training course at Sandhurst. He next attended the Victoria University of Manchester and the Institute of Education, University of London. Before he began to write full-time he held a wide variety of jobs, including being a mechanic, a motorcycle messenger and an English teacher in Colombia. he lived near Bungay in Suffolk.

In 2009 he separated from his partner, actress Cathy Gill, who took custody of their children, Robin and Sophie. Eventually, he gained equal custodial rights. He has never remarried.

De Bernières is an avid musician. He plays flute, mandolin, clarinet and guitar, although he considers himself an &quot;enthusiastic but badly-educated and erratic&quot; amateur. His literary work often references music and the composers he admires, such as the guitar works of Villa-Lobos and Antonio Lauro in the Latin American trilogy, and the mandolin works of Vivaldi and Hummel in &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot;. He has dystonia, which affects his playing.

== Books ==

=== Latin American trilogy ===
According to de Bernières, his experiences in Colombia, and the influence of writer Gabriel García Márquez—he describes himself as a &quot;Márquez parasite&quot;—profoundly influenced his first three novels, &quot;The War of Don Emmanuel&#x27;s Nether Parts&quot; (1990), &quot;Señor Vivo and the Coca Lord&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman&quot; (1992).

=== &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot; ===
De Bernières&#x27; most famous book is his fourth, &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot;, in which the eponymous hero is an Italian soldier who is part of the occupying force on the Greek island of Cephalonia during the Second World War. In the US it was originally published as &quot;Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot;.

In 2001, the book was turned into a film. De Bernières strongly disapproved of the film version, commenting, &quot;It would be impossible for a parent to be happy about its baby&#x27;s ears being put on backwards.&quot; He does however state that it has redeeming qualities, and particularly likes the soundtrack.

Since the release of the book and the movie, Cephalonia has become a major tourist destination, and the tourist industry on the island has begun to capitalise on the book&#x27;s name. Of this, de Bernières said: &quot;I was very displeased to see that a bar in Agia Efimia has abandoned its perfectly good Greek name and renamed itself Captain Corelli&#x27;s, and I dread the idea that sooner or later there might be Captain Corelli Tours, or Pelagia Apartments.&quot;

=== &quot;Red Dog&quot; ===
His book &quot;Red Dog&quot; (2001) was inspired by a statue of a dog he saw during a visit to the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It was adapted as a film of the same name in Australia in 2011.

=== &quot;Birds Without Wings&quot; ===
&quot;Birds Without Wings&quot; (2004) is set in Turkey, and portrays the tragic fate of the diverse people in a small village, who belong to different language-speaking groups and religions, towards the end of the Ottoman Empire, the rise of Kemal Atatürk, and the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War from the Turkish viewpoint. The book was shortlisted for the 2004 Whitbread Novel Award and the 2005 Commonwealth Writers Prize (Eurasia Region, Best Book).

=== &quot;A Partisan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; ===
&quot;A Partisan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2008) tells of the relationship between a young Yugoslavian woman and a middle-aged British man in the 1970s, set in London.

=== &quot;Notwithstanding&quot; ===
&quot;Notwithstanding&quot; (2009) is a collection of short stories revolving around a fictional English village, Notwithstanding, and its eccentric inhabitants. Many of the stories were published separately earlier in de Bernières&#x27;s career. &quot;Notwithstanding&quot; is based on the village of Hambledon in Surrey where he grew up, and he muses whether this is, or is no longer, the rural idyll. Some of the stories are autobiographical, such as &quot;Silly Bugger 1&quot; about a boy who brings up an abandoned rook, which becomes his companion, the rook sitting on his shoulder as he goes about his life – de Bernières is pictured on his website with a rook sitting on his shoulder. &quot;Notwithstanding&quot; is rich in local detail, containing references to the nearby villages and towns of Godalming, Chiddingfold, and Haslemere, as well as to Waitrose, Scats, the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, the Merry Harriers pub and the &quot;suicidal driving&quot; of the nuns at St Dominic&#x27;s School. De Bernières reflects in the Afterword:

&quot;I realised that I had set so many of my novels and stories abroad, because custom had prevented me from seeing how exotic my own country is. Britain really is an immense lunatic asylum. That is one of the things that distinguishes us among the nations... We are rigid and formal in some ways, but we believe in the right to eccentricity, as long as the eccentricities are large enough... Woe betide you if you hold your knife incorrectly, but good luck to you if you wear a loincloth and live up a tree.

===&quot;Blue Dog&quot;===
The movie &quot;Red Dog: True Blue&quot; (2016) is adapted from a screenplay by Daniel Taplitz. In this prequel to the &quot;Red Dog&quot;, a boy named Mick is sent to the outback to live with his Granpa after a tragedy befalls on him, it looks as if he has a lonely life but while exploring the floodwaters, he finds a lost puppy covered in mud and half-drowned. Mick and his dog immediately become inseparable as they take on the adventures offered by their unusual home, and the business of growing up, together. Louis de Bernières tells the story of a young boy and his Granpa, and the charismatic and entertaining dog..

===&quot;The Daniel Pitt Trilogy&quot;===
The &quot;Daniel Pitt Trilogy,&quot; comprising the three novels &quot;The Dust that Falls from Dreams&quot; (2015), &quot;So Much Life Left Over&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Autumn of the Ace&quot; (2020)&quot;,&quot; follows the life of its central character Daniel Pitt, a flying ace in WWI, and the McCosh family through the 20th century. The story was strongly inspired by de Bernières&#x27; own grandfather&#x27;s life.

<doc id="609419" wikidata="Q6109744" url="?curid=609419" title="Jaap Sahib">
<text>Jaap Sahib (or Japu Sahib; , pronunciation: ) is the morning prayer of the Sikhs. The beaded prayers were composed by the Tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh and is found at the start of the Sikh scripture Dasam Granth. 
This Bani is an important Sikh prayer, and is recited by the &quot;Panj Pyare&quot; while preparing &quot;Amrit&quot; on the occasion of &quot;Amrit Sanchar&quot; (initiation), a ceremony held to Amrit initiates into the Khalsa and it is a part of a Sikh&#x27;s &quot;Nitnem&quot; (daily meditation). The &quot;Jaap Sahib&quot; is reminiscent of &quot;Japji Sahib&quot; composed by Guru Nanak, and both praise God.

==Meaning of &quot;jaap&quot; ==
Following are some accepted meanings of &quot;jaap&quot;:
* The popular meanings of Jaap is &quot;to recite&quot;, to repeat, or &quot;to chant&quot;.
* &quot;Jaap&quot; also means &quot;to understand&quot;. Gurbani cites &quot;Aisa Giaan Japo Man Mere, Hovo Chakar Sache Kere&quot;, where Jap word means to understand wisdom.

&quot;Jaap&quot; is a Sanskrit word meaning &quot;to utter in a low voice, whisper, mutter (especially prayers or incantations); to invoke or call upon in a low voice&quot;.
&quot;Jaap Sahib&quot; is a rhythmic hymn composed like a necklace of pearls and gems, beauteously (beautifully) arranged around a string: the string is the Supreme God; the pearls and gems are His attributes, excellences, and glories. It basically helps reader do a daily Greetings to Waheguru in 199 verses, just like we do hello to each other. The glories sung by Guru Sahib revolve around the following attributes of God:

*God is metaphysical, beyond time, Eternal, Unborn, Uncreated, Self-existent, and without form, feature, colour or contour. Therefore, neither can God be described or depicted, nor can anyone make an image or idols of that which is undefinable.
*God&#x27;s manifestations are universally pervasive. God cannot be confined to any particular place, land, country, religion, race, garb, body or name.
*God is the Creator of the Universe and the laws governing it. Never can anyone be outside the ambit of these laws nor can anyone have the power to oppose them. God&#x27;s Law and Justice is Righteous and Ultimate.
*God&#x27;s is pervasive in all that &#x27;He&#x27; has created, yet God also extends beyond &#x27;His&#x27; creations; God is thus Immanent in His Creation and at the same time Transcends it.
*God is Omnipotent, Omnipresent, and Omniscient; nothing, whether good or evil, can happen outside of the Creator&#x27;s Will; God is the Creator-Sustainer-Annuller of His Creation. God is the Life of life, the Death of death, the Darkness of darkness, the Light of light.

==Content==

The Jaap Sahib is a recitation and praise of God. It includes various names of God in various languages. Understand the fact that god has no name but is called by various names by devotees based on their experience and the blessings they have obtained from him. There is only one sole religion of humans - humanity, and the worldly path that we choose to understand the natural power, our source, source of creation - is called faith only.

All faiths are rivers and are destined to merge into one great &quot;Ocean - the lord, the light&quot;; whatever you may call, think, believe or perceive.

==Form==
&quot;Jaap Sahib&quot; is made up of 199 verses and is the first Bani of the Dasam Granth (p. 1-10).

The Jaap Sahib begins with the words:

This line is clearly intended to authenticate Guru Gobind Singh Ji as the Author of the Dasam Granth.

&quot;Jaap&quot; is a Sanskrit word which means &quot;to utter in a low voice, whisper, mutter (especially prayers or incantations); to invoke or call upon in a low voice.&quot; The form of the word here is &quot;Japu&quot;, which makes it a noun, meaning &quot;meditation on nothing but the Truth; (&#x27;God&#x27;) (or The True God).

==Language==
The language of Jaap, is close to classical with words and compounds drawn from Sanskrit, Brij Bhasha, Arabic and Urdu. The contents of Jaap Sahib, are divided into various &quot;Chhands&quot; bearing the name of the related meter according to the then prevalent system of prosody in India.

==Japji Sahib and Jaap Sahib==
The Guru Granth Sahib starts with &quot;Japji Sahib&quot;, while Dasam Granth starts with Jaap Sahib also called Japu Sahib. Guru Nanak is credited with the former, while Guru Gobind Singh is credited with the latter. The Jaap Sahib, unlike Japji Sahib, is composed in Braj bhasha, Sanskrit and Arabic, and with 199 stanzas, is longer than Japji Sahib. The Jaap Sahib is, like Japji Sahib, a praise of God as the unchanging, loving, unborn, ultimate power.

<doc id="609420" wikidata="Q14935296" url="?curid=609420" title="Tecoma, Victoria">
<text>Tecoma ( ) is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 35 km east from Melbourne&#x27;s central business district and 1 km west of Belgrave, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Tecoma recorded a population of 2,064 at the 2021 census.

The suburb is named after the shrub &quot;Tecoma&quot; that grew in the area when the need was identified for a railway station for the timber mill that occupied the site where Tecoma Primary School now stands. The Post Office opened on 7 January 1929, closing in 1976.

Tecoma is a small suburb, nestled between Belgrave and Upwey, adjoining Sherbrooke Forest to the north. It is historically recognised as a foothill township of the Dandenong Ranges, an area of cultural significance and biodiversity.

== Demographics ==
In the 2016 census the population of Tecoma was 2,082, 50.2% female and 49.8% male. The median age was 41.

79.4% of people living in Tecoma were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were England 6.7%, New Zealand 1.5%, South Africa 0.9%, Netherlands 0.6% and United States of America 0.6%.

92.0% of people living in Tecoma only spoke English at home. The other top languages spoken at home were German 0.5%, Russian 0.5%, Dutch 0.3%, Italian 0.3% and Mandarin 0.3%.

== History ==
Until 1925 Tecoma did not have a separate name, only known as part of Upper Ferntree Gully, Upwey or as Lower Belgrave. The name arose when the residents of &#x27;Lower Belgrave&#x27; persuaded the Victorian Railways to build a railway station there, which got named Tecoma after a plant which grew in the locality.

==McDonald&#x27;s controversy==

In 2011 a plan by the multinational fast food chain McDonald&#x27;s to build a 24-hour takeaway restaurant in the main street of Tecoma was met with strong community opposition. The original application for planning approval was rejected by Yarra Ranges Shire Council however McDonald&#x27;s launched a successful appeal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal and was granted planning approval in October 2012. Construction began in July 2013 and subsequent community opposition and protest led to widespread media attention. Protests and media attention peaked in the final months of construction leading to the April 2014 opening of the store and included Victoria Police action against the protesters during construction and a large police presence on the opening day of the store.

<doc id="609421" wikidata="Q7884879" url="?curid=609421" title="Uniface">
<text>In archaeology, a uniface is a specific type of stone tool that has been flaked on one surface only. There are two general classes of uniface tools: modified flakes and formalized tools, which display deliberate, systematic modification of the marginal edges, evidently formed for a specific purpose.

== Modified flakes ==
While many worked stone tools can be technically designated as &quot;modified flakes,&quot; for lithic analysis purposes a modified flake is usually defined as a lithic flake with one or more edges that were altered either through opportunistic use or through nonsystematic retouching; it is often difficult to identify the process that produced the observed edge. Opportunistic use occurs when a sharp flake is used as-is, without edge-modification. Nonsystematic retouching occurs when pressure flaking is used to remove a few trimming flakes from the edge, in no discernible or extensive pattern.

== Formalized uniface tools ==
Some unifaces are characterized by systematic edge retouch, which was used to thin, straighten, sharpen, and smooth an artifact&#x27;s edge, and were usually created with a specific purpose in mind. These formalized unifaces were often intended for woodworking, cutting, chopping, or hide-working purposes, and generally fall into easily classifiable types. While the following discussion does not cover some specialized types of unifaces, it does include the most common types.

Scrapers are unifacial tools that were used either for hideworking or woodworking. Whereas this term is often used for any unifacially flaked tool that defies classification, most lithic analysts maintain that the only true scrapers are defined on the base of use-wear, and are usually worked at their distal ends—i.e., &quot;end scrapers.&quot; Other scrapers include the so-called &quot;side scrapers.&quot; Most scrapers are either oval or blade-like in shape. The working edges of scrapers tend to be convex, and many have trimmed and dulled lateral edges to facilitate hafting. One important variety of scraper is the thumbnail scraper, a scraper shaped much like its namesake. This scraper type is common at Paleo-Indian sites.

Gouges (or adzes) may be either bifacial or unifacial, and are defined as tools with chisel-like working edges that were used for woodworking purposes; they may also have been used to remove marrow from bones. Gouges are generally triangular in shape, with the working edge—characteristically steep-angled—appearing at the wide base of the triangle. The opposite edge, at the point of the triangle, was the hafted end; the tool itself was generally hafted at right angles to the handle.

Denticulate tools display edges that are worked into a multiply notched shape, much like the toothed edge of a saw. Indeed, these tools might have been used as saws, more likely for meat processing than for wood. It is possible, however, that some or all of these notches were used for smoothing wooden shafts or for similar purposes.

<text>The Imperial Crypt (), also called the Capuchin Crypt (&quot;Kapuzinergruft&quot;), is a burial chamber beneath the Capuchin Church and monastery in Vienna, Austria. It was founded in 1618 and dedicated in 1632, and located on the Neuer Markt square of the Innere Stadt, near the Hofburg Palace. Since 1633, the Imperial Crypt serves as the principal place of entombment for the members of the House of Habsburg. The bones of 145 Habsburg royalty, plus urns containing the hearts or cremated remains of four others, are here, including 12 emperors and 18 empresses. The visible 107 metal sarcophagi and five heart urns range in style from puritan plain to exuberant rococo. Some of the dozen resident Capuchin friars continue their customary role as the guardians and caretakers of the crypt, along with their other pastoral work in Vienna. The most recent entombment was in 2023.

==History==

Anna of Tyrol, wife of Emperor Matthias conceived the idea of a Capuchin cloister and burial crypt for herself and her husband, to be built in the neighborhood of the Hofburg castle in Vienna. She provided funds for it in the will she made on 10 November 1617 and died the following year in 1618 which released the funds, allowing for planning and construction to commence. Her spouse died in 1619.

The foundation stone was laid on 8 September 1622 in the presence of Emperor Ferdinand II and after slow progress caused by the distractions of the Thirty Years&#x27; War the church was dedicated on 25 July 1632. At Easter the following year, the simple sarcophagi containing the remains of Emperor Matthias and Empress Anna were transferred with great ceremony to what is now called the Founders Vault.

Emperor Leopold I enlarged the crypt in 1657 in the area under the nave of the church and his son Emperor Joseph I extended it further westward and built another mausoleum chamber and a chapel to the east in 1710, but awkwardly, beginning the vault that his brother Emperor Charles VI continued westward in 1720 that extends under the chancel and the apse choir above. For the first time, a well-known architect (Lukas von Hildebrandt) was involved with an enlargement of the crypt.

In 1754, his daughter Empress Maria Theresa went even further west, completely past the church above, into the monastery garden with her domed addition that admits natural light. The imposing dome and crypt is the work of architect Jean Jadot de Ville-Issey. During the reign of her grandson Emperor Francis II architect Johann Aman turned to the north for his addition in 1824.

The monastery surrounding the church had fallen into disrepair after 200 years of constant use, so during the reign of Emperor Ferdinand in 1840 the monastery (but not the church) was torn down and rebuilt. As part of that project, architect Johann Höhne built the Ferdinand Vault and the Tuscan Vault as part of the basement of the new structure.

As part of the jubilee celebrating his 60 years on the throne in 1908, Emperor Franz Joseph had architect Cajo Perisic build another mausoleum chamber and a chapel to the east of Franz II and Ferdinand&#x27;s vaults. At the same time, new annexes for visitors were created on either side of the church.

By 1960 it was obvious from the deteriorating condition of the tombs that the environment of changing heat and humidity needed to be controlled if the historic sarcophagi were to survive for future generations. The New Vault, north of the Tuscan, Ferdinand&#x27;s and the Franz Joseph Vault, was built by architect Karl Schwanzer, with metal doors by sculptor Rudolf Hoflehner. It added about 20% to the space of the crypt, and was used as part of a massive rearrangement of the tombs in the vaults.

The original small vault had held, besides the tombs of the two founders, those of a dozen children and had been called the Angel&#x27;s Vault. Those were moved to open niches newly made in the front wall of the Leopold Vault. Selected tombs from various other vaults were moved to the New Vault and grouped in themes such as Bishops, the direct ancestors of the last reigning emperor, and the immediate family of Archduke Charles the victor of Aspern.

Thirty seven other tombs, of some minors and minor members of the ruling family, were walled-up into four piers created in the Ferdinand Vault. Thus about half of all the tombs were moved out of the original vaults to more orderly places as part of that great reorganization.

In 2003 another project made the crypt accessible to disabled visitors, and opened previously unused doors so that the visitor route no longer requires the 100% backtracking that was necessary before. The entire crypt was also air conditioned to prevent deterioration of the tombs.

==The sarcophagi==
The free-standing tombs are usually variations of either a flat-topped storage chest, or a tub with sloping sides and a convex lid of tapered decks. Ornamentation ranges from simple to elaborate. Until far in the 18th century, the most common material for a sarcophagus here was a bronze-like alloy of tin, coated with shellac. The splendid tombs of the baroque and rococo eras are made of true bronze, a nobler and therefore more expensive material. Reforming Emperor Joseph II decreed simplified burial customs for the people, and introduced the use of lighter and cheaper copper into the Imperial Crypt, where it was then used into the 19th century. In the later 19th century a mixture of cast brass and bronze as well as silver-bronzed copper was adopted. Other metals were used only rarely, except for silver and gold plating on decorations.

Various techniques of metalworking were used: full casting for the sarcophagus; hollow casting for decorative sculpture; carving, engraving, and hammered relief for surface decoration. The parts for chests and covers are riveted together, ornaments and decorative figures are screwed on. The sculptor responsible for the most elaborate tombs is Balthasar Ferdinand Moll.

In order to guarantee the stability of the enormous display tombs, they have iron bracings and wood lining inside. This avoids both cave-ins and a buckling of the side walls from the weight of the cover. The cover of the double tomb of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband alone weighs approximately 1700 kg (3800 lb).

Within the outer case lies a wooden coffin that is wrapped in silk (black with gold trim for rulers, red with silver trim for others). The coffin usually has two locks, the key to one is kept by the Capuchin Guardian of the crypt, the other is kept in the Schatzkammer of the Hofburg palace in Vienna.

Within the coffin, the body usually has had the organs removed as a necessary part of the embalming process for its display before the funeral. For about one-third of the bodies, the heart has been placed into a silver urn and sent elsewhere (usually the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche), and for some the intestines and other organs have been put into a copper urn and deposited in the Dukes Crypt in the catacombs of Vienna&#x27;s cathedral, the Stephansdom.

===Conservation of the tombs===
Over the centuries, constant humidity, variations in temperature, and the host of visitors had taken a great toll on the sarcophagi. Corrosion craters, holes and tears had developed. Layers of the horizontal surfaces had peeled, base plates had broken through, decorative fixtures had been broken or stolen by visitors, the cast metal absorbed too much humidity and puffed up, and heavy covers had caused some sidewalls to bend or cave.

The first major restoration effort was undertaken in 1852, but further work was needed by 1956 when the &quot;Gesellschaft zur Rettung der Kapuzinergruft&quot; (Association for Saving the Capuchin Crypt) came into being to inform the public of the problem, raise funds, and preserve and restore the tombs.

It was first necessary to create additional space and to dehumidify the crypt. After completion of the New Vault in 1960 and the transfer of 26 tombs from the overflowing Tuscan Vault, the work of dehumidification could begin. Also, a workshop was created in the south end of the Tuscan Vault where highly skilled artisans could work on selected tombs temporarily moved there for restoration.

In 2003 remodelling of the ground-level visitor facilities took place to create a new visitor entrance and make the crypt accessible to disabled visitors. The visitor route was also changed so that visitors now see the tombs in historical sequence by entering at one end and leaving at the other, instead of both entering and leaving via a single stairway that is in the middle of the route. Most importantly, the entire crypt was air conditioned so that humidity can be controlled.

The repair and conservation of the artistic work takes place in close cooperation with the monks, the Association, the Austrian Monument Office and the Vienna Old City Preservation Fund.

==People buried here==
The bodies of 145 people (mainly members of the ruling line of the House of Habsburg and the successor House of Habsburg-Lorraine), plus urns containing the hearts or cremated remains of four others, are deposited in one of the ten interconnected Vaults of the Imperial Crypt.
They include 12 Emperors and 18 Empresses. The most recent entombment, that of Archduchess Yolande of Austria, wife of Archduke Carl Ludwig, was on 7 October 2023.

From other families there are 33 spouses, plus four others, who have found their resting place here.

The longest-lived person entombed here is Yolande De Ligne, aged 100 years and 5 months. The next longest-lived is Otto von Habsburg, eldest son of the last Austrian emperor, at 98 years. Several died at birth and over 25% of those entombed here were five years of age or younger when they died.

* Go directly to descendants of Emperor Francis II (c. 1775 – end of the monarchy)
* Go directly to descendants of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany (c. 1775 – c. 1900).

== Vaults ==

The vaults consist of an interconnected series of ten subterranean vaulted rooms, built at various times as more space was needed.

The visible 107 metal sarcophagi and five heart urns range in style from puritan plain to exuberant rococo.

The bodies of 145 nobles, plus urns containing the hearts or cremated remains of four others, are deposited here. There is only one space left.
They include 12 Emperors and 18 Empresses. The most recent entombment was in 2023.

From other families there are 33 spouses, plus four others, who have found their resting place here. Everyone else in the Imperial Crypt was born with the Habsburgs-only title of Archduke or Archduchess.

In 1960, with the various vaults overcrowded, a major rearrangement project began which resulted in the construction of the Children&#x27;s Columbarium and the New Vault. At the same time many bodies were moved to those new areas, others were moved from the Tuscan Vault and the Ferdinand Vault and walled up into the corner piers of the Ferdinand Vault.

===Founders Vault===
The &quot;Gründergruft&quot; is the oldest part of the Kaisergruft, dating from the original construction of the church (completed in 1632), and lies under the Emperor Chapel at the left of the nave of the church above. The room is low, plain, and windowless, and visible through baroque gates from the Leopold Vault. Here stand the two plain sarcophagi of the founding couple.

&quot;Looking through the gate, from left to right:&quot;
* Third son of Emperor Maximilian II. Once governor of the Austrian Netherlands, he wrested power over Austria, Hungary and Moravia from his inept brother Emperor Rudolf II in 1608 and inherited the rest in 1612. He built the original hunting lodge that became Schönbrunn, and died only three months after his wife Empress Anna. His heart is buried in urn 2 in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche. His intestines are buried in urn 18 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Daughter of Ferdinand II, Duke of Tyrol and wife of her cousin Emperor Matthias who was 28 years older than she was. She provided in her will of 1617 for the establishment of a crypt for her and her husband in a Capuchin&#x27;s Church to be built in Vienna, and died only one year later, at age 33 after seven years of a childless marriage. Her heart is buried in urn 1 in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche. Her intestines are buried in urn 17 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.

===Leopold Vault===
The &quot;Leopoldsgruft&quot; was built under the nave of the church above, beginning in 1657 by Emperor Leopold I of Austria, following the edict of his father Emperor Ferdinand III that the hereditary burial place of the imperial family would be in this church. Considering that Leopold contributed his three wives and 16 of his children—plus himself—to the population of the crypt, it was inevitable that other vaults would be needed soon.

====&quot;Children&#x27;s Columbarium&quot;====
Turning to the left of the gates to the Founders Vault, in the thick east foundation wall of the church are twelve longitudinal recessed niches built in the 1960s containing sarcophagi of 12 children. The coffins had previously been in either the Founders Vault or the main hall of this vault, but were generally in poor condition and have now been placed into identical cases. No markings or documentation identifies which child lies in which coffin, but those buried in these niches are:

&quot;Four children of Emperor Ferdinand III&quot;:
* Infant son of Emperor Ferdinand III and Empress Maria Anna.
* Two-year-old son of Emperor Ferdinand III and Empress Maria Anna.
* Infant daughter of Emperor Ferdinand III and Empress Eleonora.
* Infant son of Emperor Ferdinand III and Empress Eleonora. His viscera are buried in urn 22 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.

&quot;Seven children of Emperor Leopold I&quot;:
* Infant son of Emperor Leopold I and Empress Margarita Teresa. His intestines are buried in urn 25 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Infant son of Emperor Leopold I and Empress Margarita Teresa. His intestines are buried in urn 27 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Infant daughter of Emperor Leopold I and Empress Margarita Teresa. Her intestines are buried in urn 28 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Infant daughter of Emperor Leopold I and Empress Claudia Felicitas. Her viscera are buried in urn 30 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Infant daughter of Emperor Leopold I and Empress Claudia Felicitas. Her heart is in a gold and silver urn atop her mother&#x27;s sarcophagus in the Dominican Church. Her viscera are buried in urn 32 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Infant daughter of Emperor Leopold I and Empress Eleonora Magdelena.
* Infant daughter of Emperor Leopold I and Empress Eleonora Magdelena. Her heart is buried in urn 34, and her viscera in urn 35, in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.

&quot;Grandson of Emperor Ferdinand III&quot;:
* Son of Johann Wilhelm of Pfalz-Neuberg and Archduchess Maria Anna Josepha.

====&quot;Main Hall&quot;====
&quot;In front of the Children&#x27;s Columbarium:&quot;
* Daughter of Emperor Leopold I. Her body is in the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora in Lisbon, beside her husband John V of Portugal.

&quot;Proceeding along the north wall, east-to-west:&quot;
* Sixteen-year-old daughter of Emperor Leopold I. Her heart is buried in urn 10 the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche, and her viscera are buried in urn 40 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Daughter of Emperor Ferdinand III. Wife of Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine.
* Daughter of Emperor Ferdinand III. Wife of Michael Korybut Wiśniowiecki, King of Poland, then of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, by whom she became grandmother of the two brothers who married Empress Maria Theresia and her sister.
* Third wife of Emperor Ferdinand III. Foundress of the Order of the Starry Cross (the Sternkreuzorden). Her heart is buried in urn 7 in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and her viscera are buried in urn 33 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Niece and first wife of Emperor Leopold I at age 15. She is the blonde princess depicted in the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez&#x27; masterpiece &quot;Las Meninas&quot; (&quot;The Maids of Honor&quot;, 1656), where she is surrounded by her ladies-in-waiting and other persons of the Spanish court. Her 21-year-old heart is buried in urn 6 the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and her viscera are buried in urn 29 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Second wife of Emperor Ferdinand III. Married at age 16, died in childbirth of Archduke Karl Joseph the next year.
* Born Infanta of Spain, first wife of Emperor Ferdinand III.
* Six-year-old youngest daughter of Emperor Charles VI. Her viscera are buried in urn 45 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Second wife of Emperor Leopold I. Her body, by her own request, is dressed in the habit of a Dominican nun and is entombed beside her mother in the Dominican Church. Her viscera are buried in urn 31 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.

&quot;Proceeding along the south wall, east-to-west:&quot;
* Twelve-year-old daughter of Emperor Leopold I. Her heart is buried in urn 9 in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and her viscera are buried in urn 37 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Son of Emperor Leopold I. His sarcophagus is normal sized although he was only two years old when he died.
* Third son of Emperor Ferdinand II. Nine of his children are buried here. His viscera are buried in urn 21 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Daughter of Emperor Leopold I and wife of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria. Her heart is buried in urn 8 in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and her viscera are buried in urn 36 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Eldest son of Emperor Ferdinand III. His heart is buried in urn 4 in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and his viscera are buried in urn 20 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom. He established the tradition of burial of different parts in three separate Vienna churches.
* Six-month-old only son of Emperor Charles VI. His death later led to the War of the Austrian Succession because his father had no other male heirs. His heart is buried in urn 43, and his viscera in urn 44, in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Daughter of Emperor Leopold I.
* Third wife of Emperor Leopold I.

===Charles Vault===
The first part of the Charles Vault (&quot;Karlsgruft&quot;) was built in 1710 by Emperor Joseph I. In 1720 it was extended by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt on the orders of Emperor Charles VI and shelters 8 containers:

&quot;Proceeding along the south wall, from left to right:&quot;
* Second son of Emperor Ferdinand III and father of Emperors Joseph I and Charles VI. He repelled an effort by the Muslims to conquer Europe at the Second Siege of Vienna. He built the Leopold&#x27;s Wing of the Hofburg, used today as the offices of the president of Austria. He can be seen sculpted, kneeling prayer for the end of the plague epidemic, on the plague column &quot;(Pestsäule)&quot; in Vienna. Died at age 65 after a reign of 48 years. His three wives and 16 of his children are buried here. His heart is buried in urn 11 the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and his viscera are in urn 41 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Daughter of Emperor Leopold I. Unmarried, she was appointed governor of the Austrian Netherlands in her own right and when she died at age 69, was originally buried in Brussels but was transferred here 8 years later. Her heart is buried in urn 14 in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and her viscera are in urn 51 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Daughter of Emperor Charles VI. and sister of Empress Maria Theresia. She married Charles of Lorraine, brother of Maria Theresia&#x27;s husband, Emperor Franz I Stephen. They were joint governors of the Austrian Netherlands. She died in Brussels at age 24 whence her body was transferred at her sister&#x27;s order. Her heart is buried in urn 15 in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and her viscera are in urn 52 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Younger son of Emperor Leopold I. Raised in Spain in preparation to inherit the Spanish throne upon the death of his childless cousin, the War of the Spanish Succession ended when Charles unexpectedly inherited the Empire upon his brother Joseph&#x27;s early death and no one wanted to allow the dominance that would come from empowering Charles with both realms. Moving to Vienna, he brought the Spanish Riding School with him and built the magnificent hall it uses today. Because he had no surviving male heirs, he negotiated the Pragmatic Sanction to assure that his daughter Maria Theresa would succeed him, going so far as to pre-bribe the nine Electors but, of course, once he died they ignored their promises but kept the money, resulting in the War of the Austrian Succession. He died after a reign of 29 years, at age 55 after catching a cold while hunting. His heart is buried in urn 13 the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and his viscera are in urn 48 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.

His tomb is one of the most remarkable, with a death&#x27;s head at each corner wearing one of the distinctive crowns of his major realms (the Empire, Bohemia, Hungary, and Austria).

&quot;The empty plaza at the west third of this vault was used as the area for reception ceremonies when new bodies were brought in after the funeral ceremonies upstairs.&quot;

&quot;Returning along the north wall, from left to right:&quot;
* Wife (1708) of Emperor Charles VI and mother of Empress Maria Theresa. Died at age 59 of heart failure brought on by corpulence and rheumatism. Her sarcophagus is the earliest by Balthasar Ferdinand Moll. Her heart is buried in urn 17 the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and her viscera are buried in urn 53 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Son of Emperor Leopold I. Allied with the British during the War of the Spanish Succession where his great general Eugene of Savoy worked with the Duke of Marlborough to prevent the throne of Spain going to the French. With no surviving son, he died of the black pox at age 33 after a reign of 6 years. The heart of his wife is nearby. His heart is buried in urn 12 the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and his viscera are buried separately in urn 42 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Wife (1699) of Emperor Joseph I. The wing of the Hofburg in which she had living space during her widowhood is named after her, but she founded the Salesian Cloister in Vienna 1712 to educate young women and spent much of her time there. She died of edema at age 69. Her body lies dressed in a nun&#x27;s habit entombed in a simple stone sarcophagus below the high altar in the Salesian Cloister in Vienna.
* Infant son of Emperor Joseph I. Died of hydrocephalus. His viscera are buried in urn 38 in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.

===Maria Theresa Vault===

The three vaults of the Imperial Crypt held 44 bodies plus urns containing the hearts of two other persons when Empress Maria Theresa started construction of the &quot;Maria Theresien Gruft &quot; in 1754. It is behind the church above, with its dome rising into the monastery courtyard and contains the tombs of 16 persons:

&quot;In the entrance archway:&quot;
* Son of Empress Maria Theresa. A populist who became known as &quot;the people&#x27;s emperor&quot;, he initiated many reforms (including a prohibition on embalming and elaborate burials), many of which he repudiated in disillusionment shortly before his death. In keeping with his edict, his body is unembalmed and intact within a simple copper tomb. He died shortly before his 49th birthday after an official reign of 10 years. His equestrian statue in the Josefsplatz of the Hofburg palace is where Harry Lime&#x27;s auto accident occurs in The Third Man. His two wives and two children are buried in this vault.

&quot;In the small chamber immediately north of Emperor Joseph II:&quot;
* Long-time family retainer and governess to Empress Maria Theresia, her sisters and her children. The inscription of gratitude on the lid of her sarcophagus is signed by Empress Maria Theresa, who ordered her burial with the imperial family (although she had no direct blood or matrimonial connection to the Habsburgs) when she died at age 73.
&quot;In the center of the vault, from left to right:&quot;
* Eldest surviving descendant of Emperor Charles VI, her ascension was contested and officially the crown of the Empire went to her husband (1736) Emperor Franz I Stephen. Dying at age 63, her forty years&#x27; reign is thought of by the Austrians as the British think of Queen Victoria: the golden years of power, prestige and empire. A prominent statue of her enthroned and surrounded by her ministers is a landmark at the entrance to the Museumsplatz. Her heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Duke of Lorraine and Grand Duke of Tuscany. Husband of Empress Maria Theresa, he died at age 56 after nominally being Emperor for 25 years. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.

This double tomb of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband, Francis I Stephen, sculpted by Balthasar Ferdinand Moll is of particular artistic merit and is probably the most glorious in terms of design.

&quot;In the small chamber immediately south of Emperor Joseph II:&quot;
* Still-born daughter of Emperor Franz I Stephen and Empress Maria Theresa.

&quot;Along the south wall, young children of Emperor Franz I Stephen and Empress Maria Theresa. From left to right:&quot;
* Second son of Emperor Franz I Stephen and Empress Maria Theresa. Died of smallpox shortly before his 16th birthday. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Eighth daughter of Emperor Franz I Stephen and Empress Maria Theresa. Died of smallpox at age 12. Her heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Ninth daughter of Emperor Franz I and Empress Maria Theresa. Unhappy with the marriage arranged for her, she died of smallpox the day before her wedding, at age 16.

&quot;At the southwest bend:&quot;
* Daughter of Prince Charles of Lorraine and Archduchess Maria Anna (sister of Empress Maria Theresa).

&quot;Along the west wall, mainly the family of Emperor Joseph II. From left to right:&quot;
* Three-years old, eldest daughter of Emperor Franz I Stephen and Empress Maria Theresa. Her intestines are buried separately in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Second wife (1765) of Emperor Joseph II. She was the daughter of the only non-Habsburg Emperor since 1438, Karl VII of Bavaria and his wife, a daughter of Emperor Joseph I. Especially because of the unusually potent form of smallpox of which she died at age 28, her body was not embalmed but immediately placed intact into her coffin. Her husband of 2 years had not developed a regard for her, and did not attend her funeral.
* First wife (1760) of Emperor Joseph II. Daughter of Philip, Duke of Parma (1720–1765) (brother of King Philip V of Spain) and Princess Marie Louise Élisabeth of France (14 August 1727 – 6 December 1759) (daughter of King Louis XV of France). Greatly beloved by her husband, at age 21 she contracted smallpox during her second pregnancy and died 5 days after giving birth to a still born daughter. Under her husband&#x27;s orders, her body was buried whole and unembalmed.
* Still-born second daughter of Emperor Joseph II and his first wife Archduchess Isabella. Her tomb rests beneath that of her mother.
* Eldest daughter of Emperor Joseph II and his first wife Archduchess Isabella. Died at almost 8 years of age.
* Third daughter of Emperor Francis I Stephen and Empress Maria Theresa. Died at age 1-year. Her intestines are buried separately in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.

&quot;Beside the entrance to the Franz Vault on the north wall:&quot;
* Infant, only child of Duke Albert of Saxony-Teschen and Archduchess Maria Christina.

===Franz Vault===
In 1824 the four vaults of the Imperial Crypt held 78 bodies and urns containing the hearts of three other persons. In that year Emperor Franz II built the octagonal &quot;Franzensgruft,&quot; attaching it to the right wing of the Maria Theresa Vault. It is in the Biedermeier style, as are the five tombs within it.

&quot;In the center:&quot;
 Eldest son of Emperor Leopold II. He was emperor during the times of Napoleon Bonaparte and Ludwig van Beethoven. He changed crowns from Franz II of the Holy Roman Empire to Franz I of the Austrian Empire in mid-reign, and thus is often denoted as Franz II/I. The full-size crown atop his tomb is that of the Austrian Empire. He died at age 67 after a reign of 43 years. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche. His statue, dressed as a Roman emperor, stands in the main courtyard of the Hofburg palace.

&quot;In the corners, clockwise starting from the near left (south west) corner:&quot;
* First wife (1788) of Emperor Franz II. She died at age 22 a day after giving birth to Ludovika Elisabeth Franziska.
* Second wife (1790) at age 18 of Emperor Franz II. Mother of Empress Maria Louise (second wife of Napoleon), Emperor Ferdinand, and all subsequent children of her husband. Because her mother was a sister of her husband&#x27;s father the couple were first cousins. She died at age 34 of tubercular pleurisy just days after giving premature birth to Amalia Therese. Her heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Fourth wife (1816) of Emperor Franz II. Died the day after her 81st birthday, having survived her husband by 38 years and two reigns.
* Third wife (1808) at age 20 of 40-year-old cousin Emperor Franz II, she contracted tuberculosis shortly after their wedding, suffering from it for the eight years of marriage before dying at age 28. Her heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.

Until 1940, this vault also held the body of a grandson of Emperor Franz II, Franz Joseph Karl, Duke of Reichstadt (1811–1832). Adolf Hitler ordered that the body be sent to France where it now rests in Les Invalides in Paris near the body of his father, Napoléon Bonaparte. His heart is still buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.

Through the doorway in the west wall to the left is the south part of the Tuscan Vault. In the east wall is the west entrance to the Crypt Chapel. The north wall opens into the Ferdinand Vault.

===Ferdinand Vault===
The &quot;Ferdinandsgruft&quot; was built in 1842, along with the Tuscan Vault, in conjunction with the reconstruction of the monastery above. Although the visitor sees an almost-empty room with only two sarcophagi, this vault actually contains one-fourth of the Imperial Crypt&#x27;s entire population, walled-up into the corner piers.

* Son of Archduke Karl Salvator and Maria Immakulata. Died at 24.
* Wife of Archduke Karl Salvator. Died at age 54.
* Son of Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany. Among his sons was Franz Salvator, who married Marie Valerie, a daughter of Emperor Franz Joseph. Died at 52.

* At age 18 she became the third wife (1873) of the twice-widowed Archduke Karl Ludwig who was 22 years older, and she survived him by 48 years. For the seven years after the death of Crown Prince Rudolf her husband was the heir-apparent and she undertook many of the representational duties neglected by the ever-travelling Empress Elisabeth &quot;(&quot;Sissi&quot;)&quot; until her married stepson Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Este became the heir-apparent. During World War I she worked as a nurse, and accompanied the last emperor, Karl I into exile on Madeira but returned to spend her old age in Vienna.
* Second son of Archduke Ferdinand IV of Tuscany. Like his cousin Archduke Leopold Salvator he had an interest in ballooning, and once flew his balloon from Linz to Dieppe in only 16 hours. His interest in things aeronautical had brought him into contact with the future head of the German air force, Hermann Göring, who later used his influence to free the Archduke from the German concentration camp at Dachau in 1938 after only 80 days there. Had issue from two morganatic marriages.

===Tuscan Vault===
The &quot;Toscanagruft&quot; was built in 1842, along with the Ferdinand Vault. At that time there were 85 bodies plus the heart urns of three other persons in the five vaults of the crypt.

The Tuscan Vault once held many more than the present 14 tombs, but most were moved to the New Vault or enclosed within the piers of the Ferdinand Vault during the major rearrangement of 1960. The 5-meter wide vault is very large, being 21 meters long, and extends along the entire western lengths of both the Ferdinand Vault and the Franz Vault, ending only when it meets the outside wall of the west transept of the Maria Theresia Vault.

This vault takes its name from the many descendants of the younger sons of Emperor Leopold II, as Grand Duke of Tuscany, who are entombed here.

&quot;Note: the arrangement of tombs listed below was accurate before the 2003 renovation, but they have been rearranged since then.&quot;

&quot;In the archway from the Ferdinand Vault, from left to right:&quot;
* Husband of Archduchess Maria Christina. The Albertina museum, in his former palace, is named for him because his collection of paintings formed the nucleus of the museum. After the early death of their only child, the couple became the adoptive parents of Archduke Karl, the victor of Aspern. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Favorite daughter of Empress Maria Theresa. Her mother stalled arranged marriages until after the death of her father, Emperor Franz I Stephen, so that Maria Christina could marry for love instead of reasons of state—the only child allowed to do so. She chose Duke Albert of Teschen. The famous and moving monument he erected to her memory is in the Augustinerkirche. She died of Typhus at age 56. Her heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Third son of Empress Maria Theresa. Most of his career was spent in Florence, reforming the governance there as Grand Duke of Tuscany, and only his final two years were as Emperor. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Originally contracted to marry Empress Maria Theresa&#x27;s second son, Archduke Karl Joseph, his early death diverted her instead to the third son, who later became Emperor Leopold II. In the course of 21 years, she bore her not-always-faithful husband 16 children, among them Emperor Francis II, and Archduke Karl the victor of Aspern. Grieving for her husband, she outlived him by only two months leaving many small children. Her heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.

&quot;Behind them, from left to right:&quot;
* Fourth son of Empress Maria Theresa. Governor of Lombardy and, later, the Austrian Netherlands. Founder of the House of Austria-Este., His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Wife of Archduke Ferdinand Karl Anton.
* Daughter of Empress Maria Theresa. Wife of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. Almost everyone buried in the Imperial Crypt who was born after 1765 is a descendant of her or her brother Emperor Leopold II. Her heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.

&quot;To the right of the archway, along the north wall, from left to right:&quot;
* Son of Archduke Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Married (1856) Anne of Saxony (Dresden 4 January 1836 – Naples 10 February 1859), then (1868) Alicia of Bourbon-Parma (Parma 27 December 1849 – Schwertberg 16 January 1935). Lost his throne, nine months after his father had abdicated it to him, when Tuscany was annexed to Italy in 1860.
* Son of Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Abdicated his throne in 1859 in favor of his son.
* Son of Archduke Rainer. Married Archduchess Marie Karoline. A major ancient manuscript collector, his 100,000-piece collection is the nucleus of the Papyrus Museum of the Austrian National Library.

&quot;To the left of the archway, along the west wall, from left to right:&quot;
* Son of Archduke Ferdinand Karl Anton. Military commander during the Napoleonic Wars. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Eighth son of Emperor Leopold II. Last Grand Master of the Order of Teutonic Knights before Napoleon suppressed it outside of the Habsburg lands. It still functions today, as a religious order operating charitable hospitals in Europe. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Eleventh son of Emperor Leopold II. Promoter of industrialization in Austria after studying its success in England. Member of the Council of State that exercised power during the reign of the feeble-minded Emperor Ferdinand of Austria. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.

&quot;In front of them, along the east wall:&quot;
* Son of Franz IV of Austria-Este. After the death of his mother Maria Beatrice of Savoy in 1840, he was considered the legitimate heir to the British throne by Jacobites. He was the last reigning Duke of Modena, which was forcibly incorporated into the new Kingdom of Italy in 1860. Having no surviving descendant, he left most of his huge estate to his ill-fated cousin Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who subsequently used the title Archduke of Austria-Este. The art collection of his now-extinct branch, accumulated over centuries, is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum.

===New Vault===

The &quot;Neue Gruft&quot; was built between 1960 and 1962 under the monastery grounds as a 280 square meter enlargement to eliminate the overcrowded jumble of 140 bodies (plus cremation and heart urns of four other persons) in the other nine vaults, and to provide a climate-controlled environment to protect the metal sarcophagi from further deterioration. Its stark concrete walls evoke the solemnity of death. The New Vault is entered from the Ferdinand Vault, and exits into the back of the Franz Joseph Vault. It contains 26 sarcophagi:

&quot;Skip ahead to tombs:&quot; 115–119, 120–126, 127, 128–134, 135–141

&quot;To the left of the entrance, proceeding along the west wall from south to north, the &quot;Bishops Row&quot;:&quot;
* Son of Emperor Ferdinand II. Named at age 13 to take over his uncle Leopold&#x27;s renounced see at Halberstaedt (when he became 22, this was confirmed by the Pope) and later became also Bishop of Olomouc, Bishop of Breslau, and Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche and his intestines are buried separately in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Son of Emperor Ferdinand III and Empress Maria Leopoldina, who died during his birth. Bishop of Olomouc and Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights at age 13 as heir to his uncle, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm.

His intestines are buried separately in the Ducal Crypt of the Stephansdom.
* Son of Archduchess Eleonora Maria and Charles V, Duke of Lorraine. Archbishop of Trier. Uncle of Emperor Franz I Stephen, the husband of Empress Maria Theresia.

====&quot;South Wall&quot;====
&quot;Along the south wall:&quot;
* Daughter of Emperor Franz II. Empress of France as second wife of Napoléon Bonaparte, later Duchess of Parma in her own right.

====&quot;North Wall&quot;====
&quot;Proceeding along the north wall, from west to east, the first ledge contains the immediate family of Archduke Karl the victor of Aspern:&quot;
* Youngest son of Archduke Karl. Became Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights.
* Son of Archduke Karl.
* Duke of Teschen, third son of Emperor Leopold II. He was adopted by the childless Albert of Saxony-Teschen and Archduchess Maria Christina. A statue of him on horseback, holding the regimental colors aloft to rally his troops against Napoleon, stands in the Heldenplatz in Vienna. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Wife of Archduke Karl. She is the only Protestant buried here, after Emperor Franz II overrode the resistance of the resident clergy.
:*Urn with heart and entrails of Henriette of Nassau-Weilburg.
* Infant son of Archduke Karl. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.

&quot;On its own pedestal, directly across from the tomb of Empress Maria Louise:&quot;
* Second son of Archduke Franz Karl and brother of Emperor Franz Joseph. Created Emperor of Mexico by France and the Mexican Conservative rival government, he was overthrown and executed by forces of the warring Mexican Liberals, who would go on to restore the Republic.

&quot;The next ledge along the north wall, from left to right, mostly contains the family of Archduke Albrecht a great military commander of the following generation:&quot;
* Eldest son of Archduke Karl. Because of a distinguished military career, an equestrian statue of him was erected on the ramp outside of his former home, the Albertina in Vienna.
* Wife of Archduke Albrecht. Sister of Adelgunde of Bavaria. Her heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Daughter of Archduke Albrecht. At age 18, trying to hide a burning cigarette behind her back, she set her clothes afire and died from her injuries. Her heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Infant son of Archduke Albrecht.
* Eldest son of Archduke Karl Salvator. During a brilliant military career, he reorganized and modernized the Austrian artillery, becoming Inspector General in 1908. He flew hot air balloons and work on the development of airships. He grew rich from his inventions such as all-wheel drive and half-track trucks for the army. Married (1889) Blanca Infanta of Spain (Graz 7 Sep 1868 – Viareggio 25 Oct 1949).
* First son of Archduke Leopold Salvator. Unmarried.
* First wife (1856) of her mother&#x27;s nephew, Archduke Karl Ludwig. The marriage had not yet produced any children when she fell ill of typhus while on holiday in Monza and died at age 18. Her heart is buried in the Hofkapelle in Innsbruck.

====&quot;East Wall&quot;====
&quot;Proceeding along the east wall, from north to south, the direct ancestors of the last emperors:&quot;
* Third son of Emperor Franz II. When his elder brother Emperor Ferdinand abdicated in 1848, he stood aside so that his son, Emperor Franz Joseph, could succeed to the throne instead. Great grandfather of the last reigning emperor, Emperor Karl I. His heart is buried in the Herzgruft in the Augustinerkirche.
* Infant son of Archduke Franz Karl.
* Wife (1824) of Archduke Franz Karl. Friendly with Napoleon&#x27;s son in her youth. She tried to arrange a marriage between her son Emperor Franz Joseph and the eldest daughter of her sister, but he chose the youngest daughter &quot;Sissi&quot; instead.
* Third son of Archduke Franz Karl. Brother of Emperor Franz Joseph, father of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Este and Otto and grandfather of Emperor Karl I. After the death of Crown Prince Rudolf he was the heir-presumptive.
* Second wife (1862) of Archduke Karl Ludwig. Sister of Maria Immakulata of Bourbon – Two Sicilies.
* Second son of Archduke Karl Ludwig. Father of Emperor Karl I. Usually remembered for the widely circulated story that he had been spotted in a hallway at the Hotel Sacher about to enter a lady&#x27;s room, wearing only a sword.
* Wife (1886) of Archduke Otto. She strove to keep her children away from the influence of her notorious husband, and her ability to avoid excessive displays of grief when he died was much noted. She would probably wish her tomb was not exactly where it now is. She accompanied the last reigning emperor, Karl I into exile, and spent the remainder of her life with his family after his death.

===Franz Joseph Vault===

By 1908 the seven vaults of the crypt already held 129 bodies, plus the heart urns of another three persons. In that year the &quot;Franz Josephs Gruft&quot; was built, along with the adjacent Chapel, as part of the celebrations of Emperor Franz Joseph&#x27;s 60 years on the throne. The vault is usually entered from the north wall in the rear, through the southeast door of the New Vault.

&quot;From the foot of the tombs, left to right:&quot;
* Wife of Emperor Franz Joseph.
* Son of Archduke Franz Karl.
* Son of Emperor Franz Joseph.

Turning around from the foot of the tombs, the doorway on the south wall of this vault leads into the Crypt Chapel.

===Crypt Chapel===
The &quot;Gruftkapelle&quot; was built, along with the Franz Joseph Vault, in 1908. It is usually entered from the south doorway of the Franz Joseph Vault.

&quot;As one enters, to the right extending from the west wall:&quot;
* (1923–2023), wife (1950) of Archduke Carl Ludwig
* (10 March 1918 – 11 December 2007), son of Emperor Karl I of Austria.
* Wife (1911) of Emperor Karl I of Austria. The hearts of this couple are in the crypt of the Loretto Chapel of the Benedictine Monastery at Muri, Switzerland.
* A memorial tablet to &quot;the first victims of the World War 1914–1918&quot;, Archduke Franz Ferdinand (1863–1914), son of Archduke Karl Ludwig, and to Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenburg (1868–1914). Because Sophie could not be buried here, the couple is buried instead in the crypt of the castle at Artstetten.

&quot;Ahead, to the right of the altar along the south wall:&quot;
* , eldest son of Emperor Karl I of Austria and claimant to the thrones (renounced in 1961) and later (1979) elected by German voters to a seat in the European Parliament, where after many reelections he served longer than any other member.
&quot;To the left of the altar:&quot;
* , wife of Archduke Otto.

&quot;To the left, in front of the east wall:&quot;
* A statue of the Madonna, presented by Hungarian ladies in 1899 as a memorial to Empress Elisabeth of Bavaria.

&quot;In the far-right (southeast) corner:&quot;
* A memorial bust of (Blessed) Emperor Karl I of Austria (1887–1922), the last reigning Emperor, whose body is buried in the Nossa Senhora do Monte church in Funchal on the Portuguese island of Madeira. 

The doorway to the right enters the east side of the Franz Vault; the west doorway, to the left, is an exit stairway.

== Future entombments ==
Archduchess Yolande (1923–2023), wife (1950) of Archduke Carl Ludwig, was the most recent entombment in the Crypt, taking the final reserved space within the Crypt Chapel.
There is room for two others along the east wall.

Any other entombments would most easily be located along the south wall in the
New Vault.
There is also room in the
Tuscan Vault,
but that would not follow the generally chronological arrangement of the tombs.

Cremated remains can be accommodated within the piers in the corners of the Ferdinand Vault.

Since 1971 members of the family (e.g. Archduke Rudolf (1919–2010)) are mostly entombed in the crypt of the Loretto Chapel of the Benedictine Monastery at Muri, Switzerland, which was founded in 1027 by Count Radebot von Habsburg.

==Genealogies==
=== Founders&#x27; family ===

=== Empress Maria Theresa&#x27;s family ===

=== Tuscan line ===
When the second son of Empress Maria Theresa was called from his post of Grand Duke of Tuscany to become Emperor, he separated the Grand Duchy from the inheritance that goes with the imperial crown, installing his second son, Ferdinand and his heirs as successors to those lands and that title. This group shows that line until the absorption of Tuscany into the Kingdom of Italy.

<text>The Patch is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 39 km east from Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. The Patch recorded a population of 1,046 at the .

==History==

In the 1860s, a patch of Mountain Ash trees were prevalent in just one area and so that area was named The Patch—as recounted in Helen Coulson&#x27;s book &quot;Story of the Dandenongs&quot;. A part of Monbulk not far from Kallista has come under the locality now considered to be The Patch.

There was a brief gold-rush in the area in 1858. During the depression of the 1890s, under the Settlement on Lands Act (1893) in response to poverty, inspired by the idealism of the Rev. Horace Finn Tucker, land around The Patch was divided into 10-acre farming selections and for unemployed city people, most of whom lived in earth-floored paling shacks with of calico instead of glass for windows and who cooked with stream water over camp fires. Many of the people sent had little knowledge of farming or the bush and were doomed to failure. However berry growing was established successfully in the area by the late 1890s, though it was made difficult by poor transport through the hills to metropolitan markets. A successful grower Daniel Camm established Monbulk Jams, with sales worldwide.

The Post Office opened on 1 September 1908. A Post Office also opened at Fairy Dell on 1 July 1916 and closed in 1971.

The Anglican church was built in 1934, the community hall in the 1950s and the primary school in 1983–4. The hall is near the post office (which is also the general store) and the school. The Patch contains area previously known as Coonan and Fairy Dell. Its census population in 1933 was 88 and in 1947 it was 195. It remains a small township and scenic area.

==The Town today==

The Patch is a very small suburb and consists only of houses, a community hall, a general store, a primary school, several commercial nurseries and a tennis court. Most of the suburb is classified &quot;Rural Residential&quot;.

<text>Wandin East is a town in Victoria, Australia, 45 km east from Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Wandin East recorded a population of 408 at the .

Wandin Yallock Creek and Boggy Creek flow through the town.

==History==

The area was first surveyed as the township of Wandin Yallock in 1866, however the town centre moved north (now known as Wandin North) when the Lilydale to Warburton railway opened in 1901. A Post Office called Wandin opened in 1892 but was soon renamed Wandin South (later Silvan). Later, a Post Office called Peacock&#x27;s Jam Factory opened in around 1902 and was renamed Wandin around 1908 (closing in 1964).

==Industry==
The area is set on fertile red soil (terra rossa) and there are many fruit orchards in the town. Major crops include cherries, strawberries, raspberries, apples and more recently, wine grapes.

The Wild About Fruit Company is a fruit growing and processing company. The company is owned and operated by a third generation of the Mould family. Its main operations take place in Wandin.

CherryHill Orchards is an Australian owned cherry farm that has been operating in Wandin East since 1940. In addition to growing and processing fruit, in spring it is home to Australia&#x27;s largest cherry blossom festival.

==The town today==

Wandin East itself does not have any shopping centre, but has a town hall, cricket oval, tennis and badminton club. Wandin East Reserve is home to the annual Wandin-Silvan Field Days (a major agricultural fair).

Just up the road from the Wandin East Reserve is Jay Berries, a family owned and operated u-pick farm established in Wandin East in 1995.

Wandin is a great place to live and bring up a family. The Sawicki strawberry farm and company Fresh and Fruity are both founded and located in Wandin.

Wandin East is the home to the &#x27;Five Oaks&#x27; vineyard.

Wandin has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Yarra Valley Mountain District Football League.

== East Wandin Cricket Club ==

East Wandin CC has been around since early 1930, the club has always had at least one team. Early 1990 the club was very successful in producing a couple of trophies, at one stage the club had three teams in seniors and a couple in juniors.

The Mcleod family was a strength that at times has held the club together for many years and there is over 100 years experience at the club between the family. Since 2000 with the introduction of new blood into the club, the club has seen recent success after some years of poor results. In the past 7 seasons, the club has made the finals 6 times, with 3 premierships, and the opportunity for a 4th this season. The club has also been successful of late by winning several FTGDCA competition awards handed out by the club having standout performers during recent seasons.

The club has gone through recent changes at the top, with the new leadership group looking at continuing to grow the club throughout the coming years.

<doc id="609444" wikidata="Q5259486" url="?curid=609444" title="Denticulate tool">
<text>In archaeology, a denticulate tool is a stone tool containing one or more edges that are worked into multiple notched shapes (or teeth), much like the toothed edge of a saw. Such tools have been used as saws for woodworking, processing meat and hides, craft activities and for agricultural purposes. Denticulate tools were used by many different groups worldwide and have been found at a number of notable archaeological sites. They can be made from a number of different lithic materials, but a large number of denticulate tools are made from flint.

Due to the nature of denticulate tools they can be difficult to classify, this leads to what is known as a &#x27;typology dilemma&#x27;. It can be difficult for archaeologists to sort and classify these tools because it is impossible for them to know if the notches were created intentionally, or if they are a result of unintentional damage. Incorrectly classifying items found at archaeological sites is problematic because it can have a significant impact on how the tools and the site are interpreted by archaeologists.

These tools are included in the Mousterian tool industry by Neanderthal culture, proceeded by small hand axes and side scrapers.

== Uses ==
Denticulate tools have many different uses which can differ based on the material, size and shape of the tool. The tools can be used for woodworking, processing meat and hides, craft activities and agricultural purposes.

=== Woodworking ===
Experiments carried out by archaeologists found that using denticulate tools &quot;seem to provide more control when working wood than a raw flake or even a scraper might&quot;, because they hold their position well on the wood because of the notches. Shaped wooden artefacts have been found uncovered at sites alongside denticulate tools, suggesting these tools were used to shape these items. If denticulate tools are examined under a microscope and traces of use wear may suggest they were used to scrape wood, for example if the edges are more polished and uniform.

=== Meat and hide processing ===
There is evidence which suggests denticulate tools were also used on softer surfaces such as meat and hides. Use-wear analysis carried out on denticulate tools at sites in Spain and Italy suggests that they were &quot;employed in hide-working and butchery activities&quot; The sort of polish on the notches of a denticulate tool can also indicate it was used to scrape hides or skin.

=== Craft activities ===
Evidence shows that denticulate tools were used by Palaeolithic craftsmen. Some denticulate tools found in Spain have characteristics which suggest they were used for craft activities, in particular, crafts that required careful and precise action or work on small items such as needles or handles.

=== Agriculture ===

Researchers in China have examined denticulate tools found at Peiligang sites which show signs they were used for agricultural purposes, these specific tools are referred to as &#x27;denticulate sickles&#x27;. Denticulate sickles are characterised by a denticulated cutting edge with grooves carved into it and a concave back opposite to grooves, one end of the tool is pointed and the other has a notch where a wooden handle may have once been connected. These tools can range in size from 10 to 20 cm and are made from soft lithic materials. Usewear analysis of these tools suggests they were used for harvesting cereals, cutting grass and reeds and stripping fruits and nuts from branches. However, findings concluded that &quot;denticulate sickles were multi-purpose tools, rather than specialised implements for harvesting cereals.&quot;

There is also evidence that denticulate tools were used to carry out what is known as &#x27;plant splitting&#x27;, which involves using a tool and a specific and hand movement (&quot;twist-of-the-wrist&quot;) to split bamboo shoots and reeds or to remove bark from trees Archaeologists have also theorised that it was the process plant splitting itself that created the notches on the denticulate tools, rather intentional retouch.

== Distribution ==
Denticulate tools have a wide distribution and have been found in many places around the world, including Europe, Asia and Africa.

=== Notable Sites ===
Denticulate tools have been found at a number of notable archaeological sites around the world, include Pech de l&#x27;Aze IV and Payre in France, the El Collado site and el Miron Cave in Spain, Jiahu, Shigu and Egou in China and the Tabon Caves in the Philippines.

==== Pech de l&#x27;Azé IV ====

Pech de l&#x27;Azé IV is an archaeological site located in the south of France which was the home to Neanderthals during the Ice Age, 90,000-30,000 BCE. Over 20,000 lithic tools were found at the site during the most recent excavations, including 43 denticulate tools, which for the purpose of this excavation were classified as &quot;types which have two or more adjacent notches&quot;. Some of the denticulate tools found at this site were made from very thin flakes and had complex notches resembling saws, which were most likely used for woodworking and for the processing of meat and hides. Francois Bordes, an archaeologist whose work focused on the typology of lithic tools, was involved in excavations at this site.

==== Payre ====
Payre is site located in Southeast France, by the Rhone River and human remains excavated at the site reveal that it was home to humans of the Neanderthal lineage. Researchers identified a number of stone tools at the site, which included 49 denticulates, made from either flint or quartz. Researchers found that out of all the types of stone tools found at the site, the denticulate tools were made from the largest and thickest flakes.

==== El Collado ====
El Collado is a Mesolithic funerary site in Spain where a number of denticulate tools were found. Analysis of these tools indicates that they were used in craft activities that involved working with wood and bone. The denticulate tools found at this site were mainly made from flint.

==== el Mirón Cave ====
The el Mirón Cave in Spain is another site with an abundant lithic artefact assemblage, which includes denticulate tools, which are assumed to have been used as domestic tools. However, denticulate tools only made up a small number of the lithic tools found at this site. The lithic tools found at this site were made from local non-flint materials and non-local flint materials.

==== Jiahu, Shigu and Egou ====
Jiahu, Shigu and Egou are Peiligang sites in China where denticulate tools have been found. The tools range from 10 to 20 cm in length and were most likely used for agricultural purposes. Denticulate tools found at these sites vary in shape “from a narrow body with a sharp-angled tip to a wide body with a more obtuse angled tip” and most have worn down teeth, indicating heavy usage.
==== Tabon Caves ====
41 denticulate tools were found in the Tabon Caves in the Philippines, which are thought to have been used for ‘plant splitting’. Some of tools found show evidence of intentional retouching while other denticulate tools may have been formed unintentionally.

=== Other ===

==== Egypt ====
A large proportion of the denticulate tools in the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s collection come from different areas in Egypt. In ancient Egypt flint denticulate tools adhered to wooden handles were used to reap grain from the 5th to 4th millennia BC.

==== England ====
Denticulate tools have also been found in England, in the Robin Hood Cave and in Etton, Cambridgeshire

== Raw Materials ==

Denticulate tools are usually made from flint, but can also be made from other materials such as limestone and quartz.

The availability and quality of the raw materials used to create denticulate tools is heavily influenced by the geographic area and analysis of raw materials and where they come from can provide information about the travel and trading habits of the inhabitants of the ancient sites.

Researchers at Pech de l&#x27;Azé IV identified denticulate tools made from different types of flint, including Coniacian flint, Campanian flint and Bergerac flint. At Pech de l&#x27;Azé IV 95% of lithic tools found were made from local raw materials and a small number of tools were made from exotic raw materials such as chalcedony. At Payre 47 of the denticulate tools found were made from flint and 4 were made from quartz.

Denticulate tools found at the Peiligang sites were made from a number of different raw materials including; tuff, sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, slate and siliceous limestone. These are softer lithic materials that allow for easier manufacture through filing and grinding.

Denticulate tools found at the Tabon Caves in the Philippines were made from red jasper, white chert and andesite.

The tools found at the el Mirón Cave were made from local non-flint materials and non-local flint materials.

== Typology Dilemma ==

Denticulate tools have been proven to be relevant enough in the Mousterian tool industry to have been identified as a specific tool type in Typologie du Paléolithique ancien et moyen 1961, written by French archaeologist and geologist Francois Bordes. Many archaeologists use Bordes&#x27; typology when classifying lithic tools but this can prove difficult, especially “when too many questionable pieces appeared in an assemblage”. Even Bordes himself found it difficult when attempting to classify denticulate tools within his typology.

It is sometimes hard for typologists to tell whether lithic artefacts were retouched intentionally or unintentionally, for example as a result of wear over time or human trampling. The question then becomes:

&quot;“should the term denticulates be restricted to tools intentionally retouched or encompass all tools with adjacent notches whatever the origin of the latter is?”&quot; 

It is important that lithic tools are accurately classified because the way these tools are sorted can impact how they are interpreted. Lithic tools can provide important information on the social and economic realities of the lives of the ancient people who were using them, so archaeologists must take care when attempting to classify them.

Archaeologists have run tests to see whether the human trampling of stone flakes can damage the edges of the flakes in a way that appears to be deliberate retouch. Flakes of chert and obsidian were used in the experiment, they were placed in substrate and then the archaeologists walked over the substrate and finally excavated the flakes. This experiment created what the archaeologists referred to as &#x27;pseudo-tools&#x27;, which resemble deliberately retouched Palaeolithic formal tools so closely that they would be classified as such. The archaeologists who carried out this study warn that, when working with denticulate tools &quot;any typological analysis and conclusions about economic activities, social organisation, or cultural affinities must be made with caution&quot; 

The typology dilemma can also occur as a result of excavator bias, which impacts the way artefacts are classified and sorted and can distort the interpretation of the uncovered collection. Sometimes artefacts are thrown away because they are not recognised as artefacts at all, for example, an early excavator at the site of site of Combe-Capelle Bas discarded all the denticulate tools because they did not recognise them as &#x27;valid tool types&#x27;. As a result, the collection was dominated by scrapers and did not accurately reflect the range of tools used at the site.

=== Types of Denticulate tools ===
Within the category of denticulate tools, there are further classifications that can be used when examining or studying the tools. Three different types have been distinguished based on the length of the notches on the cutting edge. Theodoropoulou, Moncel and Navarro (2009) describe the different types as follows:

* macrodenticulates: with notches with lengths of more than 5mm 
* microdenticulates: with notches with lengths of less than 5mm the length of notches is smaller than 5 mm 
* festooned denticulates: with notches with lengths of more or less than 5mm the length of notches varies 
The degree of modification of denticulate tools also can also be used to classify them further – with modification being considered either as small, average or invasive.

<text>Warburton is a town in Victoria, Australia, east of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Warburton recorded a population of 2,020 at the .

==History==

The name &quot;Warburton&quot; has been shared between two townships over the years. The mining town of &quot;Yankee Jim&#x27;s Creek&quot; was located on the gold-bearing slopes of Mount Little Joe. Hostile terrain, fire, drought, flood, steep slopes, unsustainable roads, crime and easier pickings for miners further upstream put an end to &quot;Old Warburton&quot;. Land was surveyed and sold in the valley below in 1884.

The Post Office opened around 1884. Two earlier offices named Warburton were renamed as Launching Place and Hoddle&#x27;s Creek.
Warburton was connected to Lilydale by a Victorian Railways branch line, which was closed in 1965. The railway path is now used for the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail, a rail trail used by pedestrians, cyclists, and horse-riders.

East of Warburton is a large water catchment area called Upper Yarra Dam, which is designed to supply Melbourne with water sourced from the Thomson catchment area. Robert Hoddle first surveyed this area in 1845 after persistent overwhelming floods impeded the development of the city of Melbourne.

Warburton was named after the middle name of unpopular goldfields Police Magistrate for Castlemaine, Charles Warburton Carr by District Surveyor Clement Hodgkinson during the 1860s. It received an official title in 1884. Hodgkinson became Australia&#x27;s Father of Forestry. Carr was confronted with a population explosion upon opening of the Yarra goldfields in 1859 amid economic depression and was honoured for dutiful administration of the law despite public protests against him. Carr was also Secretary to the Government Inquiry into the Eureka Stockade 3 December 1854 at Ballarat. Charles Warburton Carr never lived in Warburton, he lived in Avoca.

Hodgkinson&#x27;s good friend, Gold Commissioner for Bendigo and Magistrate for the Yarra Valley, Joseph Panton, named Mt Donna Buang above Warburton in 1865. The sketch map of the upper Yarra water and new bridle track to Woods Point, from Lillydale to Traveller&#x27;s rest on great mountain road, lithographed at Office of Lands and Survey, 11 Sept. 1865, is available online at the State Library of Victoria. In a letter to &quot;The Argus&quot; 1 July 1911, Panton stated, &quot;having ascertained from the chief and head of the aboriginal tribe of the Yering valley that the mountain was known as &#x27;Donna Buang&#x27; I at once entered that name. My map was published by the Crown Lands department on the original scale of two miles to the inch.&quot; Panton was Colonel Anderson&#x27;s nephew; both good friends with Melbourne Botanic Gardens creator Baron Von Mueller and Hodgkinson.

The last major town before Warburton, Lilydale, has similar polar histories, an evidence base that shows that Hodgkinson named the town after Lilly de Castella, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Anderson who served as one of the first nominated members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly in the 1850s, and another history, proposes it was named by public servant clerk John Hardy who heard convicts singing when building a road. The town attracted the wealth of Federation tourism at the turn of the 20th century. It was a honeymoon town.

==Sport==
Golfers play at the course of the Warburton Golf Club on Dammans Road.

Together with its neighbouring township Millgrove, Warburton has an Australian Rules football team (Warburton Millgrove) competing in the Yarra Valley Mountain District Football League.

<doc id="609459" wikidata="Q1007407" url="?curid=609459" title="Fort Saskatchewan">
<text>Fort Saskatchewan is a city along the North Saskatchewan River in Alberta, Canada. It is northeast of Edmonton, the provincial capital. It is part of the Edmonton census metropolitan area and one of 24 municipalities that constitute the Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board. Its population in the 2021 federal census was 27,464.

The city was founded as a North-West Mounted Police fort and later home to a large provincial jail. The original fort was located across the river from the hamlet of Lamoureux, and Fort Saskatchewan opened a replica of the fort next to its original site in 2011. Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by Strathcona County to the south and east, Sturgeon County to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest. Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.

The city is best known for its proximity to chemical plants, including Dow Chemical, Sherritt International, Nutrien (formerly Agrium), Linde (Praxair), and Shell Canada. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.

== History ==
=== Pre-colonization and founding ===
Prior to colonization of the region, the area around what is now Fort Saskatchewan was a gathering place and home for many Indigenous nations, including the Cree and Métis. Indigenous peoples of the region commonly travelled the North Saskatchewan River by canoe. The mouth of the Sturgeon River, located near modern-day Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s industrial business park, was an ideal location to gather the materials necessary to construct canoes. The Cree name of the area of modern-day Fort Saskatchewan is (Birch Hills) because birch bark was an important component for making canoes and scrolls with Cree syllabics inscribed on them.

Inspector William D. Jarvis, who led a column of North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) during the March West, established Sturgeon Creek Post in 1875. The post was soon renamed &quot;Fort (on the) Saskatchewan&quot;, and it became a key northern police garrison. Its location caused outrage among residents of Edmonton, who held a meeting voicing their concern that the police garrison was located far from their settlement. Chief Factor Richard Hardisty, in charge of Fort Edmonton, wanted the police garrison to be located across the river and slightly upstream from his fort. However, Inspector Jarvis preferred the downstream site because he believed that its narrower and shallower river banks were better suited for a future railway crossing.

The NWMP made Fort Saskatchewan the headquarters of &#x27;G&#x27; Division in 1885, and considered moving it to Edmonton to accommodate an expansion. The residents of Edmonton were enthusiastic about this proposal; they held a meeting to voice their support for the move, and submitted a 250-signature petition to the Minister of the Interior. However, the existing (temporary) NWMP barracks in Edmonton were so dilapidated that some officers mutinied in 1886 – an event known among police at the time as &quot;the Big Buck&quot;. It was cheaper to expand Fort Saskatchewan at its current location than to rebuild and expand the garrison in Edmonton. Despite the efforts of Edmonton&#x27;s residents, who would continue to protest and voice their discontent until 1888, Fort Saskatchewan remained where it was.

The palisade wall surrounding the fort was dismantled in 1886, and the fort was expanded for a second time in 1889. As headquarters of &#x27;G&#x27; Division, it hosted patrols that extended as far as Fort Simpson and Chesterfield Inlet. The NWMP transferred the property to the Alberta government in 1911 for the construction of a provincial jail, and the fort was soon demolished. Artifacts and structural features have been discovered during subsequent digs, including clothing buttons, a possible privy deposit, and structural remains of the original palisade wall. The site of the fort has been partially damaged by the installation of underground utilities, and the construction of the provincial jail. Fort Saskatchewan was incorporated as a village in 1899, a town in 1904, and a city in 1985.

==== Hanging of Swift Runner ====
Five hangings were conducted at the fort between 1879 and 1914. On December 20, 1879, Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s police garrison conducted the first hanging in the North-West Territories (which included present-day Alberta).

Swift Runner (Ka-Ki-Si-Kutchin), a Cree man, was considered by locals to be smart and trustworthy, and he had previously served as a guide for local police. He was expelled from Fort Saskatchewan, and later his tribe as well, after developing a severe addiction to whisky. After he eventually arrived back at Fort Saskatchewan alone, it was discovered that he killed and ate his six children, his wife, his brother, and his mother. Possible motives for his acts have been proposed, such as trauma from previously being forced to eat a deceased hunting partner out of necessity, or being possessed by Wendigo – a flesh eating spirit in some Indigenous cultures.

Charged for murder and cannibalism, Swift Runner was sentenced to death in August 1879 by a jury consisting of three Métis residents, four locals who knew the Cree language, and a Cree translator. Scaffolding was built for his hanging in December, and an army pensioner was paid $50 to act as the hangman. Local Indigenous Chiefs were also invited to observe the execution to pacify rumours of unnecessary cruelty inflicted upon the condemned. The hanging was delayed after locals used the trap from the scaffolding as fire kindling, and the hangman forgot straps to bind Swift Runner&#x27;s arms. At 9:30 am, Swift Runner was hanged in front of 60 onlookers and pronounced dead shortly after. Within an hour, his body was cut from the rope and buried in the snow outside the fort walls.

=== Early growth ===
==== Arrival of the railway ====
Prior to the arrival of the railway, travellers to and from Edmonton had to traverse a dirt trail that wound around woods and swamps.

The Canadian Northern Railway (CNR) reached Fort Saskatchewan in 1905, placing the town on what would eventually become a transcontinental rail line. The CNR station is a modified third-class station design (100-19 plan); a &quot;special station&quot; that was used by CNR at the most significant stops along their line. It has several unique features, such as a longer footprint than other third-class stations, and a freight shed; these reflected Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s status as the centre of an agricultural district and the largest community on the CNR line between Edmonton and North Battleford, Saskatchewan. A second freight shed was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. The station is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta. In the decade after the railway arrived, the town&#x27;s population nearly doubled to 993.

The first bridge leading to Fort Saskatchewan, crossing the North Saskatchewan River, was also built at this time; CNR paid for it in exchange for free land for its station. It had a railway deck on its upper level and a wooden road deck on its lower level. Previously, the only method to cross the river at Fort Saskatchewan was via ferry. At the time of the bridge&#x27;s construction, the &quot;Edmonton Bulletin&quot; described it as the second largest bridge in the CNR. The road deck was too narrow to allow more than one-way traffic, and traffic lights were later installed on each side of the bridge to help prevent collisions. Some drivers ignored the traffic lights at night, and proceeded if they did not see any oncoming headlights; even if they had a red light. A heavy vehicle struck the bridge in 1950, and a girder was forced out of alignment by the impact. The safety concerns illustrated by these two factors caused the province to open a new two-lane bridge downstream of the railway bridge. After it opened in 1957, the railway bridge&#x27;s lower traffic deck was dismantled.

The railway station and line through Fort Saskatchewan were in use until the late 1980s. Declining rail traffic and safety concerns regarding the transportation of dangerous goods prompted the Canadian National Railway to divert the line away from the city&#x27;s non-industrial areas. The station and its property, including the railway track directly in front of it, were sold to the Province of Alberta, which immediately re-sold it to Fort Saskatchewan. The 1905 bridge was demolished soon after the railway was diverted. The old piers still stand in the river as of 2022.

As of 1987, all freight and passenger rail connections occur in Edmonton, and a new bridge, downstream and northeast of Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s downtown, carries a rail line that goes through Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s industrial area without going through residential areas.

==== Combined fire and town hall ====
Town council, meeting in the Odd Fellows Hall, approved the construction of a combined fire and town hall in 1905. The building would also contain two cells for police use. Council originally voted to purchase land for the building behind the Queen&#x27;s Hotel for $675, but a public petition successfully persuaded council to instead purchase land on the north-west corner of 100 Avenue and 103 Street for $1,250. Local taxpayers voted for $6000 to be spent on the construction of the building, and $7000 on fire-fighting equipment.

The fire and town hall was completed in 1906; the fire department occupied the bottom level, and the town hall and council chamber were located on the upper floor. The fire department occupied the bottom floor until 1958, while the town hall was located in the building until 1970. The building is now privately owned and used as commercial space.

==== Hydroelectric dam ====
After purchasing the Fort Electric Company in 1910, Town Council voted to purchase land near the mouth of the Sturgeon River, and construct a $30,000 wooden hydroelectric dam and power plant which were expected to last approximately 20 years. The town had to take over construction of the dam and plant in 1911 after the contracted firm went bankrupt. There were two separate instances in June 1911 where water rose above the dam and flooded the construction area. By its completion in December 1911, Fort Saskatchewan had spent $80,000 on the project. Minor leaks were detected throughout the next few months, and the plant was shut down in April 1912 after a washout at the penstock damaged the canal, a bulkhead, and parts of the natural riverbank. This incident was blamed on faulty construction.

The town decided in September 1912 that there was no cost-effective way to repair the dam. It instead retrofitted its old power house for $3000, and absorbed the financial losses associated with prematurely decommissioning the dam. The power plant on the grounds of the gaol supplied the entire town for eight years, during-which Fort Saskatchewan faced numerous issues with residents neglecting to pay their power bills. The town finalized an agreement for Calgary Power to purchase the town&#x27;s equipment for $26,000 in June 1928, and supply the town with power for ten years.

==== Public emergencies ====
===== Downtown fire =====
A fire swept through a large portion of the town&#x27;s business section on January 21, 1913. It is thought to have started in the Queen&#x27;s hotel, before quickly leaping across the street to nearby buildings. The fire department struggled to start their engine, and their hose froze; by the time they fixed their equipment, the fire was too large to be contained. Five businesses, primarily located in the Fetherstonhaugh Block, were lost to the fire — costing a total of $24,000 in damages. In the spring of 1913, construction began on $69,500 worth of buildings in the business section. These new buildings included the Williamson Block, which replaced the Fetherstonhaugh Block, and a new Queen&#x27;s Hotel.

===== Influenza epidemic of 1918–1919 =====
In response to the worsening Spanish Influenza outbreak, the local Board of Health placed Fort Saskatchewan under quarantine on October 30, 1918. Guards were placed at all roads leading into the town, and nobody could enter or leave without a pass from the health board. The town reached 86 cases of the Spanish Flu in November 1918, representing approximately nine percent of its total population. Fort Saskatchewan did not have its own hospital, so a local home owner, Mrs. Graham, donated her house to be used as a temporary medical facility; four residents were treated there. Three residents died from the Spanish Flu. The town&#x27;s quarantine lasted for three weeks, and was lifted on November 17, 1918.

=== Provincial jail===
A $200,000 provincial jail opened in 1915 on the site of the old fort, to replace the 34-cell guard house that had been used since the NWMP fort was constructed in 1875. This was necessary because by the early 1900s, the guard house was often filled beyond capacity; in August 1912, it held up to 71 prisoners at one time. The fort was demolished after the gaol opened, and in 1927 the prison&#x27;s warden unveiled a cairn on the site of the old guard room, made from stones taken from its foundation, to commemorate the old fort.

There were various additions to the jail throughout the next 70 years, including more cell blocks, a gymnasium, a stand-alone power plant, and carpentry, auto body, and license plate shops. The prison grew food for inmates on a nearby 324 hectare (800 acre) farm. A new house for the warden and his family was completed in 1937, replacing the commanding officer&#x27;s quarters of 1889. The warden&#x27;s house was symbolically constructed on municipal grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves — providing convenient access to the prison for the warden while normalizing life for his wife and children. The warden&#x27;s house was converted into office space in early 1973.The prison was primarily used to house people awaiting their trials or serving sentences of under two years, and 29 prisoners were hanged on-site between 1914 and 1960. Noteworthy prisoners who were executed include Florence Lassandro (the only woman hanged in Alberta), and Robert Raymond Cook (the last man to be hanged in Alberta). By 1973, the jail employed 220 people and housed 300 male and female offenders. The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 (Veterans Way) on 101 Street. The cell blocks were demolished in 1992. The warden&#x27;s house is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.

==== Riot ====
96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room on January 19, 1955, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison&#x27;s bakery. The riot started only 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed. Dishes and furniture were thrown and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was destroyed by fire after the ringleaders torched clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as &quot;get the story straight&quot; to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ringleaders were pulled from the bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison had previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage.

=== 1950–present ===
Sherritt Gordon Mines started construction on a $25-million nickel refinery in 1952, which started production in 1954. As a result, more industries constructed plants in Fort Saskatchewan. Between 1951 and 1956, the town&#x27;s population doubled from 1,076 to 2,582. Dow Chemical acquired 700 acres in Fort Saskatchewan in 1959, opening its plant in 1961 and further expanding it in 1967. The population increased from 2,972 in 1961, when operations at Dow began, to 4,152 in 1966.
The Fort Saskatchewan Town Police force (est. 1904) was disbanded in 1972, and the RCMP resumed policing duties in the town for the first time since 1917. As part of a royal tour during the XI Commonwealth Games, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip arrived in Fort Saskatchewan from Vegreville via a special train on August 2, 1978. The royal couple met with then-Premier Lougheed on the platform of the CNR station, gave a speech to local residents at Turner Park, and then traveled to Edmonton in a limousine.

Muriel Abdurahman was elected as Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s first female mayor in 1980. Abdurahman was elected for a second term in 1983, and she became the first mayor of the City of Fort Saskatchewan after it gained official city status in 1985. She later resigned as mayor to pursue a career in provincial politics, and was succeeded by Pryce Alderson.

Fort Saskatchewan annexed of land from Strathcona County on January 1, 2020. The land is mainly located south of the city&#x27;s old boundaries. Fort Saskatchewan originally requested from Strathcona County, including industrial land to the north, but the two municipalities negotiated an agreement involving less land.

Since Fort Saskatchewan was incorporated as a town in 1904, it has had 30 residents serve as its mayor as of 2021.

==== Annexation dispute ====
Fort Saskatchewan submitted a bid to annex of industrial land to its east from Strathcona County in 1988. Dow Chemical was constructing a plant on some of this land, and the refinery was expected to generate $4 million in tax revenues once it was complete. After Fort Saskatchewan declined to split Dow&#x27;s taxes between the two municipalities, and in protest over being &quot;chiseled away&quot; by its urban neighbours, Strathcona County submitted a counter-bid to the Local Authorities Board in 1989 to retake of land from Fort Saskatchewan. The claim encompassed most of Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s tax-rich industrial land, which had been ceded to the city in 1959. In the late 1980s, Fort Saskatchewan had the richest tax base in the Edmonton Area, with 74% involving commercial or industrial properties, and it had the lowest homeowners tax in the region. After the provincial government tried unsuccessfully to mediate an agreement between the two sides in late 1989, the Edmonton Metropolitan Regional Planning Commission voted in 1990 in favour of Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s bid, and rejected Strathcona County&#x27;s counter-bid.

As the dispute continued into late 1990, Fort Saskatchewan purchased a full-page advertisement in the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot;, urging the provincial government to respect the Local Authorities Board&#x27;s &quot;non-political decision&quot;, regardless of what its verdict was. The province announced that Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s bid was successful in 1991, stating that the city would annex of land from Strathcona County on December 31, 1991. In turn, the county would be protected from further annexations for 20 years, and the two municipalities would have to reach an agreement on tax-sharing. The two sides continued to face difficulties negotiating with one another, and neither believed that an arbitration process could be agreed upon. In March 1992, a Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench judge ruled in favour of Strathcona County. He declared that over the next 19 years, the county was to receive approximately $27 million in tax revenue from the land annexed by Fort Saskatchewan, while the city would receive about $55 million of tax revenue over that same period. Mayor Pryce Alderson of Fort Saskatchewan, and Reeve Iris Evans of Strathcona County, issued a joint statement that welcomed the decision, stating that they would work together moving forward.

Companies with operations in the area include Dow Chemical, Sherritt International, Nutrien (formerly Agrium) and Shell Canada. These plants are major employers for residents of Fort Saskatchewan and the surrounding area.

The city has attracted a number of major retailers including Wal-Mart, The Home Depot, Canadian Tire, Safeway, Federated CO-OP, and Freson Bros. Fort Saskatchewan has also developed as a regional hub for stores and services; in 2019 it served a catchment area of approximately 75,000 people, both locally and from communities to its north and east, including Lamont, Bruderheim, and Redwater.

=== Fort Station Mall ===

On September 15, 2015, Haro Developments opened phase one of its redevelopment of the site, which it renamed Fort Station Mall. The majority of the old mall was demolished and replaced with outward-facing commercial units. Future plans for development include the construction of additional commercial units, apartments, and an assisted-living facility for seniors. A report commissioned by the City of Fort Saskatchewan noted: &quot;As of 2019, there is another phase of the site, yet to be redeveloped, but the project continues to progress towards completion.&quot;

== Attractions ==
=== Recreational ===

The centerpiece of Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s recreation and culture is the Dow Centennial Centre, a multi-use facility that includes an ice arena, gymnasium, field house, indoor track and fitness centre. The facility, which opened in September 2004, also features a 550-seat performing arts theatre, a permanent art gallery with monthly shows, a banquet hall and the local pottery guild.

The city has two other indoor ice arenas the Jubilee Recreation Centre and the Sportsplex, that are used during the winter months by hockey, ringette and figure skating associations. In the summer months, the lacrosse association uses them. Fort Saskatchewan also has Harbour Pool: An indoor swimming pool with a hot tub, sauna, and slide. The city opened Taurus Field in 2018 – a FIFA-certified artificial turf field for soccer and football matches. It features seating for more than 1000 people, a press box, four large dressing rooms, and lights surrounding the field.

There is one nine-hole golf course located within the city&#x27;s boundaries, and a six-sheet curling club; they are both operated by the Fort Golf and Curling Club. The city&#x27;s west end features a boat launch into the North Saskatchewan River, called Red Coat Landing, and a provincially preserved natural area called the Fort Saskatchewan Prairie. Elk Island National Park is located southeast of the city.

==== Trail network ====

Fort Saskatchewan has over of paved multi-use trails as of 2021, including approximately throughout the river valley and the city&#x27;s parks. A pedestrian bridge crossing the North Saskatchewan River has been under construction since 2019; once completed it will connect Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s trail network to Sturgeon County&#x27;s trails. This is part of the Trans Canada Trail network, reflecting Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s status as a hub for numerous provincial and national trails.

=== Cultural ===
The 11 hectare (27 acre) Fort Heritage Precinct is a municipally operated museum and historic site. It contains a variety of historically significant buildings from the area which form a historical village. The Fort Heritage Precinct features a full-scale replica of the original NWMP fort, which can be explored in guided tours. Phase one of the replica fort, which included the Men&#x27;s Quarters and the Officers&#x27; Quarters, opened in 2011. The fort also features a horse stable, a guard room with jail cells, and an ice house which was completed in the summer of 2015.

The replica fort was constructed beside the site of the original fort to preserve the original site&#x27;s archaeological integrity. The city has placed eight wooden markers to show the position of the original fort: one marker is at each of the four corners where the wall once stood, and two sets of markers indicate the positions of the original east and west gates (which provided access to the settlement and to the river respectively).

The historical society hosts a two-day event called &quot;The Peoples of the North Saskatchewan&quot; every May, which educates students about Métis and settler cultures. A flock of sheep are kept at the Heritage Precinct every summer to maintain the grass, and members of the public are allowed to interact with them. The city&#x27;s mascot is a sheep mascot named Auggie, which is a reference to the North West Company&#x27;s Fort Augustus which was located nearby.

Fort Saskatchewan is served by a public library located in the same building as City Hall. The city is also home to a local theatre group, called The Sheeptown Players Drama Society, which regularly performs throughout the community.

== Sports ==
The Pyramid Corp. Hawks of the Capital Junior Hockey League play out of the Jubilee Recreation Centre. The Fort Saskatchewan Traders, of the Alberta Junior Hockey League, relocated to St. Albert in 2007, and renamed the St. Albert Steel.

There are youth sports associations for hockey, soccer (indoor and outdoor), baseball, ringette, indoor lacrosse, and figure skating, and sports associations for cross-country skiing and swimming.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Emergency services ===

==== Policing ====
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police&#x27;s K Division maintains a detachment which serves Fort Saskatchewan and the surrounding region. In 2015, the detachment moved into a new station, which also houses the city&#x27;s protective services and municipal enforcement personnel. A local police official predicted that the new location, which provides direct access to Highway 21 (Veterans Way), would allow officers to cut emergency response times by 60–90 seconds. The station features a boardroom that local organizations are able to use. The Families First Society, a local not-for-profit resource centre for families, parents, and children, moved into the old police station in April 2016.

==== Fire department ====

The Fire Department (est. 1906), based at the Walter Thomas Fire Station, is staffed by 14 full-time firefighters who are supported by part time firefighters and three full-time administrative staff. The full-time firefighters rotate between a 10-hour day shift and a 14-hour night shift.

The full-time staffing model was introduced in early 2020. Prior to its introduction, the fire station was vacant every evening, and paid on-call volunteers would have to travel to the station before they could respond to an emergency. The introduction of full-time staff has reduced response times from up to 15 minutes, to a standard of 105 seconds in 2019. New sleeping quarters were constructed at the fire station to accommodate the full-time staff.

The city purchased property for a second fire station in 2017, reflecting the increase in call volumes coming from its newer neighbourhoods.

Fort Saskatchewan was also home to Canada&#x27;s longest serving firefighter: Walter Thomas (1922–2017). Walter joined the department on May 1, 1947, and served until May 2017, a few months before he died. Walter&#x27;s last position in the department was as its official historian.

=== Public health ===
 Fort Saskatchewan has one hospital — the 38-bed Fort Saskatchewan Community Hospital. It opened in 2012 to replace the city&#x27;s aging health centre. It is attached to a new health facility that provides home care, mental health, rehabilitation, community health, and child and family services.

The city also has a 58-bed, publicly operated, supportive-living seniors lodge, called Dr. Turner Lodge. Southfort Bend, a privately operated facility, also has supportive living for seniors. The lone assisted-living facility in Fort Saskatchewan, the Rivercrest Care Centre, is also home to a hospice.

Fort Air Partnership (FAP) monitors the air quality of the airshed located immediately north and east of Edmonton. FAP maintains 10 continuous monitoring stations — three of which are located in Fort Saskatchewan — and 47 passive monitoring stations.

=== Public transit ===

Fort Sask Transit (FST) operates two daily routes, which mostly traverse the same parts of the city but go in opposite directions. To help facilitate regional travel, Strathcona County Transit is contracted by Fort Saskatchewan to provide peak-hour service between Fort Saskatchewan and the Bethel Transit Terminal in Sherwood Park. All three routes terminate at the FST park and ride at the Dow Centennial Centre. All of FST&#x27;s buses are accessible to riders with mobility issues, and the Special Transportation Service Society, a volunteer service operated by the Fort Saskatchewan Lions Club, offers a specialized minivan service for people who cannot use regular transit options because of physical disabilities.

=== Utilities ===
Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s water is supplied by the Capital Region Northeast Water Services Commission. The commission purchases water from the Edmonton-based utilities company EPCOR, which supplies treated water from the North Saskatchewan River. Waste water is treated at a facility in Strathcona County, which is owned by the Alberta Capital Region Wastewater Commission. EPCOR provides the Regulated Retail Offering for electricity in Fort Saskatchewan, and the wire service (distribution and transmission) is provided by Fortis Alberta. Direct Energy Regulated Services provides regulated natural gas to the city, and its distribution is provided by ATCO.

=== Waste management ===
Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s residents separate their household waste into three categories: organic waste is put into green bins, garbage is picked up in black bins, and recycling is collected in blue bags. The three-stream system was introduced in June 2018, after a successful pilot program. Garbage is collected bi-weekly, organics are collected weekly or bi-weekly depending on the time of year, and recycling is collected weekly. Blue bins were used for recycling in the pilot program, but the city reverted to blue bags when launching the new waste system city-wide. This was because objects could get jammed in the blue bins, and crews could not easily tell if the loads inside blue bins were contaminated like they could with blue bags. Prior to the introduction of this system, the municipality contracted out collection of garbage and recycling only; recycling was collected in blue bags, but garbage cans were not regulated by the city.

== Government ==

Fort Saskatchewan is directly governed by a city council consisting of one mayor and six councillors. Municipal elections, which are non-partisan, occur every four years on the third Monday in October. The last election was held on October 18, 2021, where Gale Katchur was re-elected for a fourth term as Mayor; becoming the longest-serving Mayor in Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s history. The mayor is elected separately from the councilors, who are elected at-large (as opposed to the ward system).

At the provincial level of government, Fort Saskatchewan is part of the Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville riding, which has been represented by Jackie Armstrong-Homeniuk (United Conservative Party) since 2019.

At the federal level, Fort Saskatchewan is part of the Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan riding and is represented by Garnett Genuis (Conservative Party of Canada).

In 2024, Mayor Gale Katchur made headlines when she advocated for the killing of feral cats at a televised committee meeting. She claimed that in the past, farmers in Fort Saskatchewan would &quot;drown cats in the river&quot; or &quot;burn them on exhaust pipes&quot;. She later apologized.

== Education ==
Fort Saskatchewan has no post-secondary schools that are open to the public, but its corrections centre partners with NorQuest College to provide academic upgrading, personal development courses, and employment training courses to inmates. Most residents of Fort Saskatchewan commute or move to Edmonton to attend post-secondary classes at the University of Alberta, MacEwan University, or NAIT.

Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s schools are governed by two different school boards – Elk Island Public Schools and Elk Island Catholic Schools. Both school boards have their head offices located in Sherwood Park. Fort Saskatchewan&#x27;s elected trustees on the EIPS board are Heather Wall and Harvey Stadnick. Al Stewart is the lone Fort Saskatchewan trustee on the EICS board.

== Media ==
Fort Saskatchewan has two local newspapers. The &quot;Fort Saskatchewan Record&quot; (&quot;The Fort Record&quot;) is a weekly home-delivered newspaper published on Thursdays. It took over the offices and plant of &quot;The Conservator&quot;, the previous weekly newspaper, and was first published on April 5, 1922. The &quot;Sturgeon Creek Post&quot;, established in 1996, is a weekly newspaper published on Wednesdays that is available at local businesses and newsstands. The &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; and the &quot;Edmonton Sun&quot; are also distributed in the community.

Fort Saskatchewan has one local radio station that broadcasts live. It is branded Mix 107.9 FM, and owned by Kenner Media Ltd. Fort Saskatchewan had an internet radio station named FortRadio.com, which came online in November 2010.

The city also used to have a local news site, FortSaskOnline.com, before being updated to Heartland News, a news website for Edmonton and the surrounding area (Sherwood Park, Strathcona County, St. Albert, Lamont County, and Sturgeon County), not to be confused with the former KFVS-TV newscast of a similar name.

<text>A presidium or praesidium is a council of executive officers in some countries&#x27; political assemblies that collectively administers its business, either alongside an individual president or in place of one. The term is also sometimes used for the governing body of European non-state organisations.

==Communist usage==
In Communist states the presidium is the permanent committee of the legislative body. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet existed after 1936, when the Supreme Soviet of the USSR supplanted the Congress of Soviets of the USSR, as a replacement for the Central Executive Committee which was headed by &quot;the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee&quot;. In its place was the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet alone, no Central Executive Committee, and from 1938 to 1989, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was the formal title of the head of state of the USSR until the office of Chairman of the Supreme Soviet was introduced in 1989, later to be replaced by the President of the Soviet Union in March 1990. The Republics of the Soviet Union were each led by Presidiums, such as the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, whose chairmen were the &quot;de facto&quot; head of state in those republics.

From 1952 to 1966, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was known as the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, but despite the similarity in name with the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the two Presidia were very different in power and function.

The term &quot;presidium&quot; is currently used in the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly) and in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (Presidium of the National People&#x27;s Congress, Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress; the Chinese word for &quot;presidium&quot; is while &quot;standing committee&quot; is ). In the same way, the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea is led by the Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea, made up of 5 members or fewer.

==Other usage==
===Bangladesh===
In the Bangladeshi political party Awami League, the Presidium is the innermost or topmost circle of members who are of highest importance within the party.

===European countries===
In Germany, the Presidium of the Bundestag consists of a president, who traditionally represents the largest party group, and at least one vice president from each party group. It is responsible for the legislature&#x27;s routine administration, nowadays including its clerical and research activities. The Bundesrat of Germany is also led by a Presidium, of a President and 2 deputies. Earlier German states also had parliaments led by Presidiums; see Presidium of the Reichstag (German Empire), Presidium of the Reichstag (Weimar Republic), Presidium of the Reichstag (Nazi Germany) and Presidium of the Volkskammer in East Germany.

Similarly, Norway&#x27;s Parliament, the is led by a Presidium, with a President and 5 vice-presidents. The Swedish is also led by a Presidium of a Speaker and 3 deputies. The Hellenic Parliament in Greece is led by a Presidium composed of the Speaker, 7 deputies, 3 deans and 6 secretaries.

In Poland, the Sejm is led by the &quot;Prezydium&quot;, made up of the Marshal and the Deputy Marshals of the Sejm. The Head of the Chancellery of the Sejm also attends the meetings of the Presidium in an advisory capacity. The Presidium of the Senate of the Republic of Poland is similarly made up of the Marshal and Deputy Marshals of the Senate. The Senate may elect no more than 4 Deputy Marshals, whilst in the Sejm the number of Deputy Marshals is determined at the pleasure of the house.

=== Non-state organisations ===
The Presidium of the Socialist International advises its president and prepares questions for consideration. In Flemish and Scandinavian student organisations, &quot;presidium&quot; is an umbrella term for all the chairmen in the organisations&#x27; administration.

A Presidium headed by a president, elected together quinquennially, governs the International Association of Wagner Societies.

<text>Slavophilia () was a movement originating from the 19th century that wanted the Russian Empire to be developed on the basis of values and institutions derived from Russia&#x27;s early history. Slavophiles opposed the influences of Western Europe in Russia. Depending on the historical context, the opposite of Slavophilia could be seen as Slavophobia (a fear of Slavic culture) or also what some Russian intellectuals (such as Ivan Aksakov) called &quot;zapadnichestvo&quot; (westernism).

== History ==
Slavophilia, as an intellectual movement, was developed in 19th-century Russia. In a sense, there was not one but many Slavophile movements or many branches of the same movement. Some were left-wing and noted that progressive ideas such as democracy were intrinsic to the Russian experience, as proved by what they considered to be the rough democracy of medieval Novgorod. Some were right-wing and pointed to the centuries-old tradition of the autocratic tsar as being the essence of the Russian nature.

The Slavophiles were determined to protect what they believed were unique Russian traditions and culture. In doing so, they rejected individualism. The role of the Russian Orthodox Church was seen by them as more significant than the role of the state. Socialism was opposed by Slavophiles as an alien thought, and Russian mysticism was preferred over &quot;Western rationalism&quot;. Rural life was praised by the movement, which opposed industrialization and urban development, and protection of the &quot;mir&quot; was seen as an important measure to prevent the growth of the working class.

The movement originated in Moscow in the 1830s. Drawing on the works of Greek Church Fathers, the philosopher Aleksey Khomyakov (1804–60) and his devoutly Orthodox colleagues elaborated a traditionalistic doctrine that claimed Russia has its own distinct way, which should avoid imitating &quot;Western&quot; institutions. The Russian Slavophiles criticised the modernisation of Peter the Great and Catherine the Great, and some of them even adopted traditional pre-Petrine dress.

Andrei Okara argues that the 19th-century classification of social thought into three groups, the Westernizers, the Slavophiles and the Conservatives, also fits well into the realities of the political and social situation in modern Russia. According to him, examples of modern-day Slavophiles include the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Rogozin and Sergei Glazyev.

The doctrines of Aleksey Khomyakov, Ivan Kireyevsky (1806–1856), Konstantin Aksakov (1817–1860) and other Slavophiles had a deep impact on Russian culture, including the Russian Revival school of architecture, composers such as The Five (active in the 1850s and 1860s), the novelist Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852), the poet Fyodor Tyutchev (1803-1873) and the lexicographer Vladimir Dahl (1801-1872). Their struggle for purity of the Russian language had something in common with ascetic views of Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910). The doctrine of , the term for organic unity and integration, was coined by Kireyevsky and Khomyakov. It was to underline the need for cooperation between people, at the expense of individualism, on the basis that opposing groups focus on what is common between them. According to Khomyakov, the Orthodox Church organically combines in itself the principles of freedom and unity, but the Catholic Church postulates unity without freedom, and in Protestantism, on the contrary, freedom exists without unity. In the Russian society of their time, the Slavophiles saw in ideal form in the peasant . The recognized the primacy of collectivity but guaranteed the integrity and the welfare of the individual within the collective.

In the sphere of practical politics, Slavophilism manifested itself as a pan-Slavic movement for the unification of all Slavic people under leadership of the Russian tsar and for the independence of the Balkan Slavs from Ottoman rule. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 is usually considered a high point of this militant Slavophilism, as expounded by the charismatic Russian military commander General Mikhail Skobelev.
Russians&#x27; attitudes towards other nations with Slavic origins varied, depending on the group involved. Classical Slavophiles believed that &quot;Slavdom&quot;, alleged by the Slavophile movement to grant a common identity to all people of Slavic origin, was based on Eastern Orthodox religion.

The Russian Empire, besides containing Russians, ruled over millions of other Slavs: Ukrainians, Poles and Belarusians, who had their own national identities, traditions and religions. Towards Ukrainians and Belarusians, the Slavophiles developed the view that they were part of the same &quot;Great Russian&quot; nation, Belarusians being called the &quot;White Russians&quot; and Ukrainians &quot;Little Russians&quot; or &quot;Malorussians&quot;. Slavophile thinkers such as Mikhail Katkov (1818-1887) believed that both these nations should be ruled under Russian leadership and were an essential part of the Russian state. At the same time, they denied the separate cultural identity of Ukrainian and Belarusian people, believing that their national as well as linguistic and literary aspirations were a result of &quot;Polish intrigue&quot; to separate them from Russians. Other Slavophiles, like Ivan Aksakov, recognized the right of Ukrainians to use the Ukrainian language but saw it as completely unnecessary and harmful.
Aksakov, however, did see some practical use for the &quot;Malorussian&quot; language: it would be beneficial in the struggle against the &quot;Polish civilizational element in the western provinces&quot;.

Besides Ukrainians and Belarusians, the Russian Empire also included the Poles, Slavs whose country had disappeared in 1795 after three neighboring states, including Russia, partitioned its territory. In 1815 the decisions of the Congress of Vienna expanded Russian control into more Polish-inhabited areas, including Warsaw. Poles proved to be a problem for the ideology of Slavophilism. The very name &quot;Slavophiles&quot; indicated that the characteristics of the Slavs were based on their ethnicity, but at the same time, Slavophiles believed that Orthodoxy equaled Slavdom. This belief was belied by very existence of Poles within the Russian Empire, who, while having Slavic origins, were also deeply Roman Catholic, the Catholic faith forming one of the core values of Polish national identity. Also, while Slavophiles praised the leadership of Russia over other nations of Slavic origin, the Poles&#x27; very identity was based on Western European culture and values, and Poles saw resistance to Russia as resistance to something representing an alien way of life. As a result, Slavophiles were particularly hostile to the Polish nation, often emotionally attacking it in their writings.

When the Polish uprising of 1863 started, Slavophiles used anti-Polish sentiment to foster feelings of national unity in the Russian people, and the idea of the cultural union of all Slavs was abandoned. With that, Poland became firmly established to Slavophiles as a symbol of Catholicism and Western Europe, that they detested, and as Poles were never assimilated within the Russian Empire -constantly resisting Russian occupation of their country - in the end, Slavophiles came to concede that annexation of Poland was a mistake when they realised that the Polish nation could not be russified.
&quot;After the struggle with Poles, Slavophiles expressed their belief, that notwithstanding the goal of conquering Constantinople, the future conflict would be between the &quot;Teutonic race&quot; (Germans), and &quot;Slavs&quot;, and the Slavophile movement turned to Germanophobia.

Most Slavophiles were liberals and ardently supported the emancipation of serfs, which finally took place in the emancipation reform of 1861. Press censorship, serfdom and capital punishment were viewed as baneful influences of Western Europe. Their political ideal was a parliamentary monarchy, as represented by the medieval Zemsky Sobors.

== After serfdom ==
After serfdom was abolished in Russia and the end of the uprising in Poland, new Slavophile thinkers appeared in the 1870s and 1880s, represented by scholars such as Nikolay Danilevsky, who expounded a view of history as circular, and Konstantin Leontiev.

Danilevsky promoted autocracy and imperialistic expansion as part of Russian national interest. Leontiev believed in a police state to prevent European influences from reaching Russia.

== &quot;Pochvennichestvo&quot; ==

Later writers Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Konstantin Leontyev, and Nikolay Danilevsky developed a peculiar conservative version of Slavophilism, &quot;Pochvennichestvo&quot; (from the Russian word for &quot;soil&quot;). The teaching, as articulated by Konstantin Pobedonostsev (Ober-Procurator of the Russian Orthodox Church), was adopted as the official tsarist ideology during the reigns of Alexander III and Nicholas II. Even after the Russian Revolution of 1917, it was further developed by the émigré religious philosophers like Ivan Ilyin (1883–1954).

Many Slavophiles influenced prominent Cold War thinkers such as George F. Kennan, instilling in them a love for the Russian Empire as opposed to the Soviet Union. That, in turn, influenced their foreign policy ideas, such as Kennan&#x27;s belief that the revival of the Russian Orthodox Patriarchate, in 1943, would lead to the reform or overthrow of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rule.

<doc id="609467" wikidata="Q315518" url="?curid=609467" title="Nikolai Tikhonov">
<text>Nikolai Aleksandrovich Tikhonov (; ; – 1 June 1997) was a Soviet Russian-Ukrainian statesman during the Cold War. He served as Chairman of the Council of Ministers from 1980 to 1985, and as a First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, literally First Vice Premier, from 1976 to 1980. Tikhonov was responsible for the cultural and economic administration of the Soviet Union during the late era of stagnation. He was replaced as Chairman of the Council of Ministers in 1985 by Nikolai Ryzhkov. In the same year, he lost his seat in the Politburo; however, he retained his seat in the Central Committee until 1989.

He was born in the city of Kharkiv in 1905 to a Russian-Ukrainian working-class family; he graduated in the 1920s and started working in the 1930s. Tikhonov began his political career in local industry, and worked his way up the hierarchy of Soviet industrial ministries. He was appointed deputy chairman of the Gosplan in 1963. After Alexei Kosygin&#x27;s resignation Tikhonov was voted into office as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. In this position, he refrained from taking effective measures to reform the Soviet economy, a need which was strongly evidenced during the early–mid-1980s. He retired from active politics in 1989 as a pensioner. Tikhonov died on 1 June 1997.

==Early life and career==
Tikhonov was born in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on to a Russian-Ukrainian working-class family; he graduated from the St. Catherine Institute of Communications in 1924. Tikhonov worked as an assistant engineer from 1924 to 1926. Four years later, in 1930, Tikhonov graduated as an engineer, earning a degree from the Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute. From 1930 to 1941, Tikhonov worked as an engineer at the Lenin Metallurgical Plant in Dnipropetrovsk; he was appointed as the plant&#x27;s Chief Engineer in January 1941.

It was during his stay in Dnipropetrovsk that he met Leonid Brezhnev, a future leader of the Soviet Union. Tikhonov joined the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) in 1940 and by the end of the decade, had secured a job as a plant director. As a director, Tikhonov was able to show off his organisational skills; under his leadership the plant became the first in the region to reopen a hospital, organising dining rooms and restoring social clubs for workers caught up in the aftermath of the Eastern Front. Tikhonov was quickly promoted, and started working for the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy in the 1950s. Between 1955 and 1960 Tikhonov became a Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy, a member (and later chairman) of the Scientific Council of the Council of Ministers, and finally, a deputy chairman of the State Planning Committee. At the 22nd Party Congress Tikhonov was elected to the Central Committee as a non-voting member. At the 23rd party congress in 1966, Tikhonov was elected a member of the Central Committee. Tikhonov was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour award for his first time.

During his tenure as Deputy Premier, Tikhonov was in charge of metallurgy and chemical industry; his responsibilities did not change with his ascension to the post of First Deputy Premier. However, he did provide a general coordination for heavy industry. When Alexei Kosygin, the Premier, was on sick leave in 1976 Brezhnev took advantage of his illness by appointing Tikhonov to the office of First Deputy Premier. As First Deputy Premier, Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a standby figure. Tikhonov was, however, one of the few who got along with both Brezhnev and Kosygin, both of them liked his candor and honesty. In 1978 Tikhonov was elected a candidate member of the Politburo and was made a voting member of the Politburo in 1979. Tikhonov was not informed of the decision to intervene in Afghanistan; the reason being his bad relationship with Dmitriy Ustinov, the Minister of Defense at the time.

==Premiership (1980–1985)==
===Appointment and the 26th Congress===
When Alexei Kosygin resigned in 1980, Tikhonov, at the age of 75, was elected the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers. During his five-year term as premier Tikhonov refrained from reforming the Soviet economy, despite all statistics from that time showing the economy was stagnating. Tikhonov presented the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–85) at the 26th Party Congress, and told the delegates that the state would allocate nine million roubles for mothers who were seeking parental leave. In his presentation to the congress, Tikhonov admitted that Soviet agriculture was not producing enough grain. Tikhonov called for an improvement in Soviet–US relations, but dismissed all speculations that the Soviet economy was in any sort of crisis. Despite this, Tikhonov admitted to economic &quot;shortcomings&quot; and acknowledged the ongoing &quot;food problem&quot;; other topics for discussion were the need to save energy resources, boost labour productivity and to improve the quality of Soviet produced goods. Early in his term, in January 1981, Tikhonov admitted that the government&#x27;s demographic policy was one of the weakest areas of his cabinet. In reality, however, he along with many others, were beginning to worry that not enough Russians were being born. The Era of Stagnation reduced the birth rate, and increased the death rate of the Russian population.

===Under Andropov and Chernenko===

Leonid Brezhnev awarded Tikhonov the Hero of Socialist Labour, after being advised to do so by Konstantin Chernenko. Upon Brezhnev&#x27;s death in 1982, Tikhonov supported Chernenko&#x27;s candidacy for the General Secretaryship. Chernenko lost the vote, and Yuri Andropov became General Secretary. It has been suggested that Andropov had plans of replacing Tikhonov with Heydar Aliyev. Historian William A. Clark noted how Aliyev, a former head of the Azerbaijani KGB, was appointed to the First Deputy Premiership of the Council of Ministers without Tikhonov&#x27;s consent; however, Andropov&#x27;s death in 1984 left Tikhonov secure in his office. Some Western analysts speculated that the appointment of Andrei Gromyko to the First Deputy Premiership, again without Tikhonov&#x27;s consent, was a sign that his position within the Soviet hierarchy was weakened. Tikhonov was on a state visit to Yugoslavia when Gromyko was appointed to the First Deputy Premiership.

With his health failing, Andropov used his spare times to write speeches to the Central Committee. In one of these speeches Andropov told the Central Committee that Mikhail Gorbachev, and not Chernenko, would succeed him upon his death. His speech was not read out to the Central Committee plenum because of an anti-Gorbachev &quot;&quot; consisting of Chernenko, Dmitriy Ustinov and Tikhonov. During Andropov&#x27;s last days, Tikhonov presided over the Politburo sessions, headed the 1984 Soviet delegation to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance conference in East Berlin, conducted bilateral relations with the Eastern Bloc states, and hosted the Prime Minister of Finland when he visited the Soviet Union. In short, in-between Andropov&#x27;s last days and Chernenko&#x27;s rise to power, Tikhonov was the dominant driving figure of the Soviet Union. However, Tikhonov peacefully stepped away, and supported Chernenko&#x27;s candidacy for General Secretary. When Chernenko died in 1985, Tikhonov tried, but failed, to find a contender to Gorbachev&#x27;s candidacy to the General Secretaryship.

===Gorbachev and resignation===
Upon Gorbachev&#x27;s ascension to power, Tikhonov was elected chairman of the newly established Commission on Improvements of the Management System. The title of chairman was largely honorary, and its &quot;de facto&quot; head was its deputy chairman, Nikolai Ryzhkov. On 23 May 1985 Tikhonov presented his development plan for 1985 to 1990, and up until 2000, the plan was criticised by co-workers, and Gorbachev told his colleagues that Tikhonov was &quot;ill-equipped&quot; for the Premiership. Tikhonov forecast estimated growth of 20–22 percent in Soviet national income, an increase of 21–24 percent in industrial growth and doubling Soviet agriculture output by 2000. As part of Gorbachev&#x27;s plan of removing, and replacing, the most conservative members of the Politburo, Tikhonov was compelled to retire. Ryzhkov succeeded Tikhonov in office on 27 September 1985. His resignation was made official at a Central Committee plenum in September 1985. It is noteworthy that by the time of his resignation, Tikhonov was the oldest member of the Soviet leadership. Tikhonov was active in Soviet politics, albeit in a much less prominent role, until 1989 when he lost his seat in the Central Committee.

==Later life and death==
After his forced resignation from active politics in 1989, Tikhonov wrote a letter to Mikhail Gorbachev which stated that he regretted supporting his election to the General Secretaryship. This view was strengthened when the Communist Party was banned in the Soviet Union. After his retirement, he lived the rest of his life in seclusion at his &quot;dacha&quot;. As one of his friends noted, he lived as &quot;a hermit&quot; and never showed himself in public and that his later life was very difficult as he had no children and because his wife had died. Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union Tikhonov worked as a State Advisor to the Supreme Soviet. Tikhonov died on 1 June 1997 and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery. Shortly before his death, he wrote a letter addressed to Yeltsin: &quot;I ask you to bury me at public expense, since I have no financial savings.&quot;
According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Tikhonov was a &quot;tried and tested yes man&quot; who had very little experience in foreign and defence policy when he took over the Premiership from Alexei Kosygin. This view is dubious, and not shared by Brezhnev - who referred to Tikhonov as his &#x27;Greatest Critic&#x27;. A bust dedicated to Tikhonov was erected in Kharkiv, his birthplace, but was dismantled following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Tikhonov, when compared to other Soviet premiers, has made little impact on post-Soviet culture and his legacy is remembered by few today. During his lifetime Tikhonov received several awards; he was awarded the Order of Lenin nine times, the Order of the Red Banner of Labour twice, one Red Star, two Stalin Prizes and several medals and foreign awards.

<doc id="609470" wikidata="Q893312" url="?curid=609470" title="Borah Peak">
<text>Borah Peak, also known as Mount Borah or Beauty Peak, is a mountain in the western United States and the highest summit in Idaho. One of the most prominent peaks in the contiguous United States, it is located in the central section of the Lost River Range, within the Challis National Forest in eastern Custer County. On February 11, 2021, the USGS officially recognized Mt. Borah as Idaho&#x27;s only active glacier.

==Description==

The mountain was nameless until it was discovered to be higher than Hyndman Peak, previously regarded as the state&#x27;s highest point. In February 1934, the U.S. Geological Survey named it for William Borah, the prominent senior U.S. Senator from Idaho, who had served for nearly 27 years at the time and was dean of the Senate. An outspoken isolationist, the &quot;Lion of Idaho&quot; ran for president two years later in 1936, but did not win the Republican nomination, and died in office in 1940.

==Climate==
==1983 earthquake==

The 1983 Borah Peak earthquake occurred on Friday, October 28, at 8:06:09 MDT in the Lost River Range at Borah Peak in central Idaho, United States, measuring 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale. Mount Borah rose about and the Lost River Valley in that vicinity dropped about . The peak was scarred on the western side, and the mark is still visible. Two children in Challis were the only fatalities of the quake, struck by falling masonry while walking to school.

==Climbing==
The normal route involves ascending from the trailhead to the summit in just over . This route on the southwest ridge, the most popular route, is a strenuous hike for the most part until one reaches a Class 4 arête just before the main summit crest. This point is known as &quot;Chicken-out Ridge&quot; as many people will abort the attempt once they see the hazards up close. In the cooler seasons, this crossing usually involves a traverse over snow, with steeply slanting slopes on either side. An ice axe, and the ability to use it, is recommended for this section when icy.

Borah Peak&#x27;s north face is one of Idaho&#x27;s only year-&#x27;round snow climbs and provides a much greater challenge than the normal route. The face features a number of Grade II class 5 routes on mixed terrain.

Three climbers are known to have died on Borah Peak: two climbers, Vaughn Howard and Guy Campbell, ascended the northwest ridge on November 24, 1977 and were killed in an avalanche. The bodies were not recovered for nine months, until August 26, 1978. On June 13, 1987, another climber, Dave Probst, died on a glissade.

<doc id="609471" wikidata="Q1363352" url="?curid=609471" title="Alfonso Soriano">
<text>Alfonso Guilleard Soriano (born January 7, 1976) is a Dominican former professional baseball left fielder and second baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Texas Rangers, Washington Nationals, and Chicago Cubs, and in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp.

Soriano began his professional career with Hiroshima in 1996, but signed with the Yankees as a free agent in 1998 and was assigned to play in minor league baseball. The next year, he was the Most Valuable Player (MVP) in the All-Star Futures Game, and made his MLB debut for the Yankees, with whom he would win two American League championships. The Yankees traded Soriano to the Rangers after the 2003 season, and the Rangers traded Soriano to the Nationals after the 2005 season. He signed a contract as a free agent with the Cubs before the 2007 season. The Cubs traded Soriano to the Yankees in 2013, and the Yankees released him in 2014.

Soriano was a seven-time MLB All-Star, and won the All-Star Game MVP Award in 2004. He won the Silver Slugger Award four times. He is one of only six players in the 40–40 club, achieving the feat in 2006. He played primarily as a second baseman for the Yankees and Rangers before being converted to an outfielder with the Nationals. Soriano is one of only 58 major league players to hit 400 or more career home runs, and was seventh among active players in home runs at the time of his retirement.

==Professional career==

===Hiroshima Toyo Carp (1996–1997)===
Soriano began his professional baseball career in Japan with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, training at their Carp Academy for Dominican players. Soriano spent 1996 playing in Japan in the minor Western League. In 1997, he was promoted to the varsity team, and, wearing uniform number 74, he appeared in nine games, batting .118 (2 for 17) with two walks.

Soriano disliked the intense Japanese practice schedule, and the Carp denied him a salary increase from $45,000 to $180,000 per year. Like Hideo Nomo and Hideki Irabu, who had previously left Japan to play in the United States, Soriano hired Don Nomura to help his situation. After first attempting to void Soriano&#x27;s Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) contract by unsuccessfully arguing that the player was legally a minor when he signed it, Nomura advised him, like Nomo, to retire from NPB and pursue a career in MLB. This prompted Carp executives to file an injunction against Soriano, and to send letters to MLB teams demanding that they cease all negotiations with him. After the Nomo case, NPB officials had amended the Working Agreement without consulting any MLB officials in an attempt to prevent the situation from recurring. Since MLB had not agreed to any changes to the agreement, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig declared that MLB would recognize Soriano as a free agent on July 13, 1998 and the Carp backed down.

===New York Yankees (1998–2003)===
Soriano signed as a free agent with the New York Yankees in 1998, starting his career as an infielder, first as a third baseman, and then moving over to second base. Soriano was named to the All-Star Futures Game in 1999. He won the game&#x27;s most valuable player award after hitting two home runs in the contest.

He played in New York for five seasons. His first hit in MLB came in 1999 when he hit a game-winning home run against Norm Charlton of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He finished in third place for Rookie of the Year honors in 2001. In the World Series that year, he hit the go-ahead home run off Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Curt Schilling in the seventh game, but Arizona won anyway when Luis Gonzalez hit his series-winning single on a cut fastball by closer Mariano Rivera.

In 2002, Soriano became the second Yankee in franchise history to record 30 home runs and 30 stolen bases in the same season (the first being Bobby Bonds in 1975), then repeated the feat in 2003. Also in 2002, he led the American League with 696 at bats, 209 hits, 92 extra base hits, 41 stolen bases, 128 runs and set a Yankees&#x27; team record for most at bats (696) and most strikeouts (157) in a season.

In 2003, Soriano set the record for most home runs to lead off a game in a season with 13, and for the second straight year, led the league in at bats, and finished in the top five for base hits, doubles, home runs, stolen bases, and strikeouts. In 2003 he again led the major leagues in power-speed number (36.4).

===Texas Rangers (2004–2005)===
In 2004, the Yankees traded Soriano to the Texas Rangers, along with minor leaguer Joaquin Árias for Alex Rodriguez and cash amounting to $67 million of the $179 million remaining on Rodríguez&#x27; contract.

On May 8, 2004, Soriano had six hits in nine innings—the first Texas Ranger to do so—in a 16–15, 10-inning victory over the Detroit Tigers. The game featured an hour-long fifth inning, where Detroit scored eight runs in the top half of the inning to take a ten-run lead over the Rangers, only to see Texas score ten runs in the bottom half of the inning to tie the game, the largest deficit ever overcome by the Rangers and tying an MLB record for most runs in an inning by two teams. That same year, Soriano was elected to the All-Star Game as the starting second baseman. He hit a three-run home run off Roger Clemens in the first inning and was named the MVP of the game.

In 2005, he finished sixth in the AL for stolen bases, and third for extra base hits (as well as eighth in strikeouts). He led the major leagues in power-speed number (32.7).

===Washington Nationals (2006)===
On December 7, 2005, Soriano was traded to the Washington Nationals in exchange for Brad Wilkerson, Terrmel Sledge, and minor league pitcher Armando Galarraga. On February 10, 2006, Soriano set a record for the highest salary ever awarded in arbitration, receiving $10 million, even though he lost his request of $12 million. The previous high had been set in 2001 by Andruw Jones of the Atlanta Braves when he earned $8.2 million. The Nationals offered Soriano a five-year, $50-million extension, but Soriano rejected the offer. Soriano and his agent Diego Bentz instead opted to open contract negotiations during the off-season, so that he would become a free agent.
On March 20, 2006, Nationals manager Frank Robinson inserted Soriano in the lineup as the left fielder. Soriano, who since 2001 had played exclusively at second base, refused to take the field, and the Nationals organization threatened him with disqualification, which would have meant forfeiture of his salary, and he would not have received credit for service time in fulfillment of the obligations of his contract. With his contract&#x27;s service terms officially still unfulfilled, he would then have been ineligible for free agency at season&#x27;s end. Two days later, Soriano relented and played in left field for the Nationals in their exhibition game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Robinson indicated that he considered Soriano&#x27;s move to left field to be permanent and would not consider moving Soriano back to second base at any point during the season. In his comments following that game, Soriano indicated that he would accept his new position without further argument. As the season got underway, Soriano began to enjoy his new position, and by the All-Star break he led the league in outfield assists. Soriano made his fifth consecutive All-Star team and became only the third man to start All-Star games for both leagues at two different positions.

On August 25, a week after reaching 30–30, he became the fastest man in baseball history to reach 200 home runs and 200 stolen bases, reaching the mark in 929 games (breaking the previous record of 1,053 games held by Eric Davis).
 In September, he completed his 20th outfield assist, becoming the only player in baseball history with 40 home runs, 40 stolen bases, and 20 assists.

On September 16, Soriano stole second base in the first inning to become the fourth player to join the 40–40 club, after Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds, and Alex Rodriguez. Many considered Soriano&#x27;s 40–40 season to be the only one &quot;clean&quot;, as Canseco, Bonds and Rodriguez were all involved in the steroid controversy. Soriano was also the only one of the four to reach the feat while playing at home. Six days later, he became the first player to reach 40 home runs, 40 stolen bases and 40 doubles in one season.

Soriano set a new career high in walks with 67 (previously 38). He also reached a career high in home runs with 46 (previously 39). He also led the National League in extra-base hits (89) and the major leagues in power-speed number (43.36), the latter of which was the second-highest single season career mark ever until Ronald Acuna Jr. set a new record in 2023.

====Possible trade====

The Nationals considered trading Soriano before the deadline on July 31, because he was in the last year of his contract, which would grant him free agency at the end of the season. If the Nationals lost Soriano at the end of the season, they would receive a first- or second-round draft pick from the team that signed him and a &quot;sandwich&quot; pick between the first and second rounds as compensation. Soriano did not want to engage in contract negotiations during the season. However, Soriano expressed his strong desire to stay with the team. Both fans and players began to be more vocal in their support to keep Soriano. Manager Frank Robinson praised Soriano&#x27;s leadership in the clubhouse, and further suggested that Soriano should be considered for MVP of the National League. There were plenty of suitors, including sending Soriano back to the Yankees, and the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers were also interested. However, Nationals general manager Jim Bowden felt that what he was offered was not worth trading him. The Nationals hoped to sign him to a long-term deal before the season ended but on October 12, 2006 he rejected a $70 million deal.

===Chicago Cubs===

====2007====
The Chicago Cubs signed Soriano to an eight-year contract worth nearly $136 million. The contract marked the most expensive deal in the Cubs&#x27; franchise history at the time and went through 2014. It contained a no-trade clause, meaning Soriano could not be traded without his consent. The Cubs&#x27; manager, Lou Piniella, assigned Soriano to play center field, but later moved him to left field after he sustained a hamstring injury. He struggled during the first month of the season, during which he posted a .270 batting average, with no home runs. He managed to hit his first home run during the Cubs&#x27; first game in May, and gradually increased his batting average throughout the month.

Soriano was extremely productive in June. In a game against the Atlanta Braves, Soriano hit three home runs off Lance Cormier. Soriano had accomplished the same feat in his past, coincidentally, also against the Atlanta Braves. Soriano also played an integral part in the Cubs&#x27; offense during the team&#x27;s annual Cross-town Classic with the Chicago White Sox at US Cellular Field. He hit home runs in three consecutive games.

His efforts merited the National League&#x27;s Player of the Month title for June. He was later selected as a reserve outfielder in the 2007 MLB All-Star Game, where he hit a two-run home run for the National League in the bottom of the ninth inning. Soriano led the Cubs in home runs during their National League Central chase in June and July, during which they erased the Milwaukee Brewers&#x27; eight game lead over the division. After losing the tie for first in early August, Soriano tore his right quadriceps during a game against the New York Mets on August 5. The Cubs placed him on the fifteen-day disabled list, and expected him to miss several weeks while recovering from the injury.

The Cubs used Matt Murton, who had been recalled from the Triple-A Iowa Cubs, in left field. He began to show signs of improvement around on August 21, when he was seen running and working out with trainers. Soriano stated he felt healthy enough to return in a few days, but made his actual return on August 28, 2007. Upon his return, Soriano proceeded to have the most productive September in the franchise&#x27;s history. He hit fourteen home runs, twenty-seven runs batted in, and recorded a .320 batting average within twenty-nine games. Soriano said upon his return from the quad injury that he had also been suffering from wrist injuries and the time off to heal his leg also helped his wrists. The Cubs went on to win the National League Central Division, but were swept by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League Division Series. Soriano finished the season with thirty-three home runs (including eleven lead-off home runs), seventy runs batted in, and a .299 batting average. He led the Cubs in home runs, triples, runs, strikeouts, and Slugging percentage, among all regular starters.

====2008====
During the first few weeks of the 2008 season with the Cubs, Soriano struggled. He was only hitting .190 at the time he was put on the DL with a strained calf. After being activated, Soriano got off to a quick start, raising his average to .280 and increasing his home run total. In a one-week stretch in May, he hit 7 home runs in just 6 games, hitting nearly .500 during that stretch. At the end of May he had 12 home runs and 33 RBIs. However, his defense was extremely poor, and after being placed on the DL early in the season, Soriano was encouraged to stop hopping as he caught fly balls. This seemed to affect his play in the field as he misjudged two balls in St. Louis on May 2, shortly after being activated. After being severely booed by Cub fans who had traveled to St. Louis in that particular game, he homered in the ninth to send the game to extra innings. Later that month, he lost a ball in the sun and dropped what would have been the game&#x27;s final out in the 9th inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates, allowing Jason Bay to reach safely and eventually costing the Cubs a win.

On June 11, 2008, Soriano was hit by a pitch and broke a bone just under the ring finger in his left hand. On July 7, 2008, Soriano was voted a starter in the 2008 MLB All-Star Game. However, due to the injury, he was replaced in the starting lineup by Matt Holliday of the Colorado Rockies.

As poor as Alfonso&#x27;s defense was perceived to be, his arm had been just as much an asset to the Cubs, and he was one of the league&#x27;s leaders in outfield assists. Soriano also led the team in home runs, despite having played in only 109 games. On August 22, Soriano accomplished one of baseball&#x27;s rarest feats, as he stole home plate in a loss to his old team, the Washington Nationals.

In early September, Soriano helped end the Cubs six-game losing streak by slugging out three home runs with five RBI against the Cincinnati Reds. It marked the third three-home run game of his career. However, as the Cubs went into the playoffs against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Soriano, like nearly everyone else on the team, hit poorly in the NLDS.

Soriano had an embarrassing moment in a day-night double header on Wednesday, August 13, 2008, where he hit a long ball which he thought was a home run. He watched it, and slowly trotted down to 1st, yet the ball never left the park. He wound up with only a single. Between games, he apologized to his team and promised that it would never happen again.

====2009====

Soriano had gotten off to a quick start, hitting a solo home run in his first at bat of the 2009 season.
Soriano also hit a game-tying solo home run off LaTroy Hawkins in the 8th inning in the second game of the young season. On April 11, Soriano hit a 2-run home run off of Carlos Villanueva in the top of the ninth giving the Cubs a 6 to 5 victory over rival Milwaukee. Comcast Sportsnet awarded Soriano with &quot;Play of the Day&quot;. Soriano homered again, the very next day, on the first pitch he saw from Jeff Suppan, his 51st lead-off home run. On April 17 with one out in the bottom of the eighth, Soriano hit a two-run home run to give the Cubs an 8–7 lead over the St. Louis Cardinals. However, Soriano only hit .216 in the month of May.

In voting for the 2009 All-Star Game, Soriano was fourth among NL outfielders (2,692,994 votes), trailing Ryan Braun (4,138,559), Raúl Ibañez (4,053,355), and Carlos Beltrán (2,812,295).

Shortly before the All-Star break, manager Lou Piniella dropped Soriano in the batting order and made it clear that it was not a temporary change. For the first time in his career, Soriano seemed to accept not being a leadoff hitter and actually praised his manager for making the necessary decision, citing the fact that &quot;I&#x27;m not doing my job.&quot;

The batting order change helped Soriano. In the first series after the All-Star break, he hit two go-ahead home runs against the Nationals. On July 27, he hit a walk-off grand slam against the Houston Astros during the 13th inning.

In September 2009, Soriano underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee.

In 2009, Soriano led all major league left fielders in errors, with 11, and had the lowest fielding percentage among them (.950).

====2010====
After a poor season in 2009, Soriano was placed permanently in the 6th spot in the Cubs lineup, where he rebounded nicely, by playing in the most games(147 games) that season for the Cubs. He also collected 40 doubles, and 79 RBIs. On June 11, 2010, Soriano hit his 300th home run off of Jake Peavy. In 2010, on defense he led major league left fielders in errors, with 7, and had the lowest fielding percentage, at .968.

====2011====
In 2011, Soriano had a less than stellar year on defense and led in errors by a left fielder, with 7, and had the lowest fielding percentage, at .965. He batted .244, drove in 88 runs, and hit 26 home runs.

====2012====
2012 was Soriano&#x27;s best year in some time, hitting 32 home runs, his best batting average in years (.262) and his personal best for RBIs (108), which ranked third in the National League.

In the field, he made only one error, which was also Soriano&#x27;s personal best on the field.

====2013====
Soriano started the 2013 season with the Cubs by playing 93 games with a .254 average, 17 home runs, and 51 RBI. Soriano&#x27;s batting average and home run production for the Cubs was especially strong in June and July, making him a hot commodity as the trading deadline approached.

=== Second stint with the New York Yankees (2013–2014)===
====Rest of 2013====

On July 26, 2013, the Cubs traded Soriano to the New York Yankees, who paid him $5 million prorated for 2013 and $5 million of the $18 million owed to him in 2014. The Cubs received pitcher Corey Black from the Single-A Tampa Yankees. On August 11, 2013, Soriano recorded his 2,000th career hit, a home run off of Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander.

On August 13, 2013, Soriano hit two home runs and had a career-high six RBIs. The next day, he broke his career high set the previous day by driving in seven runs. He became one of only three players in the live-ball era to drive in at least six runs in back-to-back games (the other two being Rusty Greer in 1997 and Geoff Jenkins in 2001). He also became just one of seven players to record 13 RBI in a two-game span, and fell just two RBI short of the all-time record set by former Yankee Tony Lazzeri.

From August 13 to 16, Soriano batted in 18 runs over four games, tying the Major League record for most RBI in four consecutive games. Soriano also recorded 13 hits during this stretch, becoming the only player in MLB history with 18 RBI and at least 12 hits in a four-game stretch. The other players who have recorded 18 RBI in four games are Jim Bottomley (St. Louis Cardinals, July 6–9, 1929), Lou Gehrig (New York Yankees, July 29–31, 1930), Tony Lazzeri (New York Yankees, May 21–24, 1936), Joe DiMaggio (New York Yankees, August 28—September 1, 1939), and Sammy Sosa (Chicago Cubs, August 8–11, 2002). Soriano was named the AL Player of the Week for August 12–18.

On August 27, Soriano hit two home runs, the second of which was the 400th of his career. For the rest of the 2013 season with the Yankees, Soriano played 58 games batting .256 with 17 home runs and 50 RBI. Overall in 2013, combined with the two teams, Soriano played 151 total games batting .255 with 34 home runs and 101 RBI.

====2014====
With the signings of Carlos Beltrán and Jacoby Ellsbury, Soriano started the 2014 season as the designated hitter and sometimes played at right field. His playing time became limited as he struggled at the plate. Soriano was designated for assignment by the Yankees on July 6, 2014. He was released on July 14. In 67 games, Soriano batted .221 with 6 home runs and 23 RBI.

===Retirement===
Soriano announced his retirement on November 4, 2014. He stated: Soriano&#x27;s 412 career home runs put him in 53rd place on the all-time list at the time of his retirement.

<text>Bajaj Auto Limited ( ) is an Indian multinational automotive manufacturing company based in Pune. It manufactures motorcycles, scooters and auto rickshaws. Bajaj Auto is a part of the Bajaj Group. It was founded by Jamnalal Bajaj (1889–1942) in Rajasthan in the 1940s.

Bajaj Auto is the world&#x27;s third-largest manufacturer of motorcycles and the second-largest in India. It is the world&#x27;s largest three-wheeler manufacturer. In December 2020, Bajaj Auto crossed a market capitalisation of , making it the world&#x27;s most valuable two-wheeler company.

==History==

Bajaj auto was established on 29 November 1945 as M/s Bajaj Trading Corporation Private Limited. It initially imported and sold two- and three-wheelers in India. In 1959, it obtained a license from the Government of India to manufacture two-wheelers and three-wheelers and obtained a licence from Piaggio to manufacture Vespa scooters in India. It became a public limited company in 1960.

With the launch of motorcycles in 1986, the company changed its branding from a scooter manufacturer to a two-wheeler manufacturer.

In 1984, Bajaj Auto signed a technical assistance agreement with Kawasaki, cooperating to expand production and sales of motorcycles in the local market.

In the early 2000s, Bajaj Auto bought a controlling stake in the Tempo Firodia company, renaming it &quot;Bajaj Tempo&quot;. Germany&#x27;s Daimler-Benz owned 16% of Bajaj Tempo, but Daimler sold their stake back to the Firodia group. It was agreed that Bajaj Tempo would gradually phase out the use of the &quot;Tempo&quot; brand name, as it still belonged to Mercedes-Benz. The name of the company was changed to Force Motors in 2005, dropping &quot;Bajaj&quot; as well as &quot;Tempo&quot;, over the objections of Bajaj Auto with whom the company shares a long history as well as a compound wall.

In 2007, Bajaj Auto, through its Dutch subsidiary Bajaj Auto International Holding BV, purchased a 14.5% stake of Austrian rival KTM, gradually increasing its stake to a 48% non-controlling share by 2020. In December 2020, Bajaj started discussions on swapping its stake from KTM to KTM&#x27;s controlling shareholder Pierer Mobility, a subsidiary of Pierer Industrie.

On 26 May 2008, Bajaj Auto Limited was split off into three corporate entities — Bajaj Finserv Limited (BFL), Bajaj Auto Ltd (BAL), and Bajaj Holdings and Investment Ltd (BHIL).

In 2017, Bajaj Auto and Triumph Motorcycles Ltd teamed up to build mid-capacity motorcycles.

In 2017, Bajaj and Kawasaki ended a sales and services partnership in India for the sale and after-sales service of Kawasaki motorcycles, which had been established in 2009. The partnership&#x27;s dealerships were later converted into KTM ones. Bajaj and Kawasaki continue with their relationship in overseas markets.

On 26 November 2019, Bajaj Auto invested about ₹57 crore ($8 million) in bicycle and electric scooter rental startup Yulu. In this deal, Bajaj would also manufacture customised electric scooters for Yulu.

Bajaj Auto continued its operations in Russia despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While many international companies ceased operations in Russia, Bajaj has maintained business as usual in the Russian market.

== Manufacturing ==
The company has plants in Chakan, Waluj in Aurangabad and Pantnagar. The oldest plant at Akurdi in Pune houses the R&amp;D centre &#x27;Ahead&#x27;.

Bajaj is the first Indian two-wheeler manufacturer to deliver 4-stroke commuter motorcycles with sporty performance for the Indian market. Bajaj achieved this with the 150cc and 180cc Pulsar.

Motorcycles produced by Bajaj include the CT 100 Platina, Discover, Pulsar, Avenger, and Dominar.
In FY 2012–13, it sold approximately 37.6 lakh (3.76 million) motorcycles which accounted for 31% of the market share in India. Of these, approximately 24.6 lakh (2.46 million) motorcycles (66%) were sold in India, and the remaining 34% were exported.

During the FY 2012–13, it sold approx. 4,80,000 three-wheelers which was 57% of the total market share in India. Out of these 4,80,000 three-wheelers, 47% were sold in the country and 53% were exported. In Indonesia, Bajaj three-wheelers are described as &quot;iconic&quot; and &quot;ubiquitous&quot; to the point that the word &quot;bajaj&quot; (pronounced &quot;bajay&quot;) is used to refer to auto rickshaws of any kind.

===Low-cost cars===
In 2010, Bajaj Auto announced cooperation with Renault and Nissan Motor to develop a US$2,500 car, aiming at a fuel efficiency of (3.3 L/100 km), or twice an average small car, and carbon dioxide emissions of 100 g/km.

On 3 January 2012, Bajaj auto unveiled the Bajaj Qute (formerly &quot;Bajaj RE60&quot;), a mini car for intra-city urban transportation, which is legally classified as a quadricycle. The target customer group was Bajaj&#x27;s three-wheeler customers. According to its Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj, the RE60 powered by a new 200 cc rear mounted petrol engine will have a top speed of , a mileage of and carbon dioxide emissions of 60 g/km.

=== Electric scooters ===
Bajaj launched its first electric scooter, the Chetak, in India in January 2020. In December 2021, Bajaj announced an investment of 300 crore to build an electric vehicle production facility in Pune. According to the company, the plant would be able to produce 500,000 electric vehicles (EVs) each year, catering to both domestic and international markets.

<doc id="609487" wikidata="Q976033" url="?curid=609487" title="Gelfond–Schneider theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Gelfond–Schneider theorem establishes the transcendence of a large class of numbers.

==History==

It was originally proved independently in 1934 by Aleksandr Gelfond and Theodor Schneider. 

==Statement==

: If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are algebraic numbers with &quot;a&quot; formula_1 and &quot;b&quot; not rational, then any value of &quot;ab&quot; is a transcendental number.

===Comments===

* The values of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are not restricted to real numbers; complex numbers are allowed (here complex numbers are not regarded as rational when they have an imaginary part not equal to 0, even if both the real and imaginary parts are rational).
* In general, is multivalued, where log stands for the complex natural logarithm. (This is the multivalued inverse of the exponential function exp.) This accounts for the phrase &quot;any value of&quot; in the theorem&#x27;s statement.
* An equivalent formulation of the theorem is the following: if &quot;α&quot; and &quot;γ&quot; are nonzero algebraic numbers, and we take any non-zero logarithm of &quot;α&quot;, then is either rational or transcendental. This may be expressed as saying that if , are linearly independent over the rationals, then they are linearly independent over the algebraic numbers. The generalisation of this statement to more general linear forms in logarithms of several algebraic numbers is in the domain of transcendental number theory.
* If the restriction that &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; be algebraic is removed, the statement does not remain true in general. For example,
::formula_2
:Here, &quot;a&quot; is , which (as proven by the theorem itself) is transcendental rather than algebraic. Similarly, if and , which is transcendental, then is algebraic. A characterization of the values for &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; which yield a transcendental &quot;ab&quot; is not known.
* Kurt Mahler proved the &quot;p&quot;-adic analogue of the theorem: if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are in C&quot;p&quot;, the completion of the algebraic closure of Q&quot;p&quot;, and they are algebraic over Q, and if formula_3 and formula_4 then formula_5 is either rational or transcendental, where log&quot;p&quot; is the &quot;p&quot;-adic logarithm function.

==Corollaries==
The transcendence of the following numbers follows immediately from the theorem:

* Gelfond–Schneider constant formula_6 and its square root formula_7
* Gelfond&#x27;s constant formula_8 
* formula_9

==Applications==

The Gelfond–Schneider theorem answers affirmatively Hilbert&#x27;s seventh problem.
==See also==
* Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem
* Baker&#x27;s theorem; an extension of the result
* Schanuel&#x27;s conjecture; if proven it would imply both the Gelfond–Schneider theorem and the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem

<doc id="609514" wikidata="Q366524" url="?curid=609514" title="Nikolai Ryzhkov">
<text>Nikolai Ivanovich Ryzhkov (; ; 28 September 1929 – 28 February 2024) was a Russian politician. He served as the last chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union from 1985 to 1991 and was succeeded by Valentin Pavlov as prime minister. The same year, he lost his seat on the Presidential Council, going on to become Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s leading opponent in the 1991 presidential election of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. He was the last surviving premier of the Soviet Union following the death of Ivan Silayev on 8 February 2023.

Ryzhkov was born in the city of Shcherbynivka, Ukrainian SSR (now Toretsk) in 1929. After graduating in 1959, he worked first in local industry before being moved into government in the 1970s, working his way up through the hierarchy of Soviet industrial ministries. He was appointed First Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee in 1979. Following Nikolai Tikhonov&#x27;s resignation as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Ryzhkov was voted into office in his place. During his tenure he supported Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s 1980s reform of the Soviet economy.

Elected to the State Duma of the Russian Federation in December 1995 as an independent, Ryzhkov subsequently led the Power to the People voting bloc, later becoming the formal leader of the People&#x27;s Patriotic Union of Russia alongside Gennady Zyuganov, who was an unofficial leader. On 17 September 2003, he resigned his seat in the Duma and became a member of the Federation Council representing Belgorod Oblast, which he held until he retired in 2023.

==Early life and career==
Nikolai Ivanovich Ryzhkov was born to Russian parents on 28 September 1929, in Dzerzhynsk, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Soviet Union. He graduated from the Ural Polytechnic Institute in 1959. A technocrat, he started work as a welder, proceeded through the ranks at the Sverdlovsk Uralmash Plant to become chief engineer, then became between 1970 and 1975 Factory Director of the Uralmash Production Amalgamation. Ryzhkov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1956. He was transferred to Moscow in 1975 and appointed to the post of First Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Heavy and Transport Machine Building. Ryzhkov became First Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee in 1979 and was elected to the CPSU Central Committee in 1981. He was one of several members of the Soviet leadership affiliated to the &quot;Andrei Kirilenko faction&quot;.

Yuri Andropov appointed Ryzhkov head of the Economic Department of the Central Committee where he was responsible for overseeing major planning and financial organs, excluding industry. As head of the department, he reported directly to Mikhail Gorbachev and as head of the Central Committee&#x27;s Economic Department he met with Andropov once a week. Ryzhkov became convinced that had Andropov lived at least another five years, the Soviet Union would have seen a reform package similar to that implemented in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. During Konstantin Chernenko&#x27;s short rule, both Ryzhkov and Gorbachev elaborated several reform measures, sometimes in the face of opposition from Chernenko.

When Gorbachev came to power, Nikolai Tikhonov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, was elected Chairman of the newly established Commission on Improvements to the Management System. His title of chairman was largely honorary, with Ryzhkov the &quot;de facto&quot; head through his position as deputy chairman. Along with Yegor Ligachev, Ryzhkov became a full rather than a candidate member of the Politburo on 23 April 1985 during Gorbachev&#x27;s tenure as General Secretary. Ryzhkov succeeded Tikhonov on 27 September 1985.

==Premiership==

===Political events===
Following the Chernobyl disaster, along with Yegor Ligachev, Ryzhkov visited the crippled plant between 2–3 May 1986. On Ryzhkov&#x27;s orders the government evacuated everyone within a radius of the plant. The 30 km radius was a purely random guess and it was later shown that several areas contaminated with radioactive material were left untouched by government evacuation agencies.

In the aftermath of the 1988 earthquake in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, Ryzhkov promised to rebuild the city of Spitak within two years. A Politburo commission was established to provide guidance for the local ASSR Government with Ryzhkov elected its chairman. The commission then travelled to the ASSR to assess damage caused by the earthquake. During Gorbachev&#x27;s subsequent visit to the ASSR, and aware of local feelings following the disaster, Ryzhkov persuaded the less sensitive Gorbachev to forgo use of his limousine in favor of public transport. When Gorbachev left the ASSR, Ryzhkov remained to coordinate the rescue operation and made several television appearances which increased his standing amongst the Soviet leadership and the people in general. With his standing thus boosted, on 19 July 1988, at the Central Committee Plenum, Ryzhkov criticised nearly every one of Gorbachev&#x27;s policies, further complaining that as Party Secretary he should devote more time to the Party. In the end, Ryzhkov failed in his promise to rebuild Spitak, partly due to the Soviet Union&#x27;s mounting economic problems, and partly because many of the city&#x27;s Soviet-era buildings had not been designed with adequate earthquake protection, making their reconstruction more difficult.

===Economic policy===
Historian Jerry F. Hough notes that Gorbachev treated Ryzhkov and his reform attempts just as badly as Leonid Brezhnev treated Alexei Kosygin, one-time Chairman of the Council of Ministers, during the Brezhnev era. Brezhnev&#x27;s most notable snub was over the 1965 Soviet economic reform.

Ryzhkov was an early supporter of the Gorbachev policy calling for an increase in the quantity and quality of goods planned for production during the period of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (1986–1990). To achieve these goals, the government pumped money into the machine-building sector but as time went by, Gorbachev increasingly diverged from his original stance. He now wanted to increase overall investment in nearly all industrial sectors; a move which Ryzhkov knew was a budgetary impossibility. However, Ryzhkov&#x27;s economic policies were not much better as he continued to advocate an unreasonable increase in the production of consumer goods. Gorbachev and Ligachev&#x27;s anti-alcohol campaign was opposed by Ryzhkov, who agreed with the State Planning Committee and the Ministry of Trade that such a drive would deprive from the state billions of roubles in income. Nevertheless, the campaign went ahead, losing the Soviet Government millions in revenues. Ryzhkov&#x27;s opposition to the campaign was strengthened by his belief that both Gorbachev and Ligachev placed ideology before practical considerations, and he instead advocated an alternative long-term program rather than one designed to have immediate effect.

Ryzhkov and Gorbachev continued their work on economic reform and in 1987, began drafting the Law on the State Enterprise, which restricted the authority of central planners. This would later come into effect and give workers an unrealistically high level of power. Nikolai Talyzin, Chairman of the State Planning Committee, became the scapegoat for the failure of this reform and on the orders of Ryzhkov he was replaced by Yuri Maslyukov.

While supporting the transition away from a planned economy, Ryzhkov understood that privatisation would weaken the government&#x27;s power. As changes occurred, skepticism over &quot;perestroika&quot; and privatisation was not limited to high-level government officialdom. Several middle and low-ranking officials, who owed their rise in the hierarchy to government-owned enterprises, wanted to retain the existing system. Gorbachev also blamed Ryzhkov and the Council of Ministers for the economic difficulties which arose during &quot;perestroika&quot;, a move which fostered resentment for both Gorbachev and &quot;perestroika&quot;. Nevertheless, in 1986, Ryzhkov stated that he, along with the rest of the Soviet leadership, were already discussing the possibility of creating a market economy in the Soviet Union. Ryzhkov supported the creation of a &quot;regulated market economy&quot; where the government sector occupied the &quot;commanding heights&quot; of the economy as well as the creation of semi-private-public companies. His second cabinet, several high-standing members of the KGB and the military establishment all supported Ryzhkov&#x27;s opposition to the 500 Days Programme, which espoused a quick transition to a market economy. Matters did not improve when at the second session of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the Soviet Union, Ryzhkov proposed postponing the transition to a market economy until 1992, further suggesting that in the period between 1990–1992, recentralisation of government activities would ensure a period of stabilisation.

Ryzhkov&#x27;s economic reform plan was a hybrid of Leonid Abalkin&#x27;s and one created by himself in conjunction with the Maslyukov chaired State Planning Committee along with several other government institutions. On 5 July 1989, the State Commission of the Council of Ministers on Economic Reforms was established, which replaced Maslyukov&#x27;s reform commission. The new commission was chaired by Abalkin, who had also been appointed Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

With strong support from Ryzhkov, Gorbachev abolished the Central Committee economic department, thereby strengthening the authority of central government over economic matters. From then on, the government could not be blamed for economic policies initiated by the Party leadership. The establishment of the post of President of the Soviet Union by Gorbachev in 1990 weakened the power of the government apparatus; a move Ryzhkov and his second cabinet opposed.

===Price reform===
According to Swedish economist Anders Åslund, Ryzhkov differed little from Gorbachev when it came to price reform. There were, however, subtle differences between the two men&#x27;s views, with Ryzhkov supporting an administratively controlled price increase while Gorbachev, as a radical economist who supported market reform, opposed such measures. As Hough noted, Ryzhkov supported &quot;the need for greater fiscal responsibility&quot;, while Gorbachev advocated the need for more rational prices which, according to Hough, would have brought inflation under control. Ryzhkov proposed price reform measures to Gorbachev several times but was turned down on each occasions, even though Gorbachev had argued strongly on the need for price reform in his speeches. Gorbachev strengthened his public image by accusing the Soviet leadership&#x27;s conservative faction together with Ryzhkov, of delaying implementation of the necessary price reform. Ryzhkov had the backing of several high-standing institutions, such as the Ministry of Finance and the State Committee on Prices, chaired by the future Soviet Premier Valentin Pavlov. In contrast to Gorbachev, Ryzhkov actually had, according to Hough, a plan for a transition to a market economy. Gorbachev on the other hand was never able to turn words into deeds.

By 1988, Ryzhkov increasingly sided with Leonid Abalkin, one of the few economists who advocated fiscal responsibility. At the 19th Conference of the Central Committee, Abalkin was severely criticised by Gorbachev, and accused of &quot;economic determinism&quot;. Several conference delegates agreed with Gorbachev, but Ryzhkov&#x27;s support remained solid. Abalkin was ordered to deliver a report to the Presidium of the Council of Ministers by December, which as things turned out, put financial stability at the top of its agenda. Gorbachev disliked Abalkin&#x27;s report and rejected Ryzhkov&#x27;s requests that he support it. Ryzhkov was then forced to create an even more conservative reform plan for 1989 in which price reform was to be postponed until 1991. When the Abalkin report was proposed at the Central Committee plenum, the majority of delegates indirectly attacked Gorbachev for his indecisiveness when it came to the implementation of price reform. In April 1990, after submitting a draft to the Presidential Council and the Federation Council, Ryzhkov&#x27;s price reform was initiated. However, a short while later it was once more put on hold following severe criticism from Boris Yeltsin and several pro-Gorbachev intellectuals. The economic turmoil which hit the Soviet Union in 1990 was blamed on Ryzhkov, even though it was Gorbachev who had delayed Ryzhkov&#x27;s proposed reform.

In his memoirs, Gorbachev vaguely asserts that a single price increase would be better than several. Things did not improve for Ryzhkov when, at the 28th Party Congress, Gorbachev claimed it would be &quot;absurd&quot; to begin serious economic reform with price increases.

===Fall from power===
In August 1990, several leading officials tried to persuade Gorbachev to force Ryzhkov to resign from his post. Gorbachev did not bow to this pressure, fearing that Ryzhkov&#x27;s removal would lead to increased activity by many of his pro-republican first secretaries and Politburo members. Ryzhkov&#x27;s numerous supporters were not concerned about policy issues; they backed him simply because he opposed some of Gorbachev&#x27;s economic and political reforms. In July 1990, as the Politburo underwent restructuring at the 28th Party Congress, all government officials except Gorbachev and Vladimir Ivashko, the Deputy General Secretary, were excluded with Ryzhkov losing his Politburo seat by default. Nevertheless, Ryzhkov, along with many others, was elected a member of the Presidential Council. On 19 October 1990, the Russian Supreme Soviet, by a vote of 164 to 1 with 16 abstentions, forced the resignation of Ryzhkov and his cabinet and the implementation of the 500 Days Programme. In stark contrast, Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union support for Ryzhkov&#x27;s economic reform plan increased. Ryzhkov&#x27;s economic reform plan was passed by an overwhelming majority, with 1,532 deputies in favour, 419 against and 44 deputies abstaining. The parliamentary Interregional Group&#x27;s vote of no confidence in Ryzhkov&#x27;s government also failed, with 199 members in favour of Ryzhkov and his cabinet&#x27;s resignation, 1,685 against and 99 abstaining. As the result of a propaganda war launched against Ryzhkov by Gorbachev supporters, several leading members of the Council of Ministers and its Presidium urged Ryzhkov to resign so that the Soviet Government could reach a compromise with the Russian Government. To make matters worse, the Russian Government which was headed by Ivan Silayev, stopped following Ryzhkov&#x27;s orders, and Silayev refused to visit the Moscow Kremlin.

Ryzhkov&#x27;s Plan and the 500 Days Programme were broadly similar, with both supporting price liberalisation, decentralisation and privatisation. The main difference between the two was Ryzhkov&#x27;s desire to retain much of the social security system, free education for all and the continuance of a strong central government apparatus. The 500 Days Programme did not mention political union with the other Soviet republics, but instead weakened the authority of the central government by establishing a market economy. In other words, they left the question of continuing or dissolving the Soviet Union open. On 17 September, in a meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev openly supported the 500 Days Programme, claiming it would not lead to the reestablishment of capitalism, but instead to a mixed economy where private enterprise played an important role.

In December 1990, Ryzhkov suffered a heart attack. During his recovery, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union dissolved the Council of Ministers and replaced it with the Cabinet of Ministers headed by Valentin Pavlov, Ryzhkov&#x27;s former Minister of Finance. The law enacting the change was passed on 26 December 1990, but the new structure was not implemented until 14 January 1991 when Pavlov took over as Prime Minister of the Soviet Union. Between Ryzhkov&#x27;s hospitalisation and Pavlov&#x27;s election as prime minister, Lev Voronin acted as the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The reorganisation of the government made it subordinate to the Presidency, weakening the head of government&#x27;s hold on economic policy. In contrast to Hough&#x27;s view that Gorbachev had little reason to remove Ryzhkov, Gordon M. Hahn argues that there were good reasons to replace him given that with Ryzhkov&#x27;s Politburo support much reduced, the reformist opposition saw him as a conservative.

==1991 presidential campaign==


After recovering from his heart attack in early 1991, Ryzhkov stood as the Communist candidate in the first election of the President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). Ryzhkov&#x27;s vice presidential candidate was Boris Gromov, a Soviet war veteran who led the Soviet military during the final stages of the war in Afghanistan. Running as the Communist Party nominee, Ryzhkov placed second in the election. He received a total of 13,395,335 votes, equal to 16.9% of the total vote. He placed more than forty points behind Boris Yeltsin, who won the election.

==Post-Soviet Russia==

During the 1995 legislative campaign, Ryzhkov defended his own tenure as Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, claiming that Russians were far worse off under capitalism than Soviet communism. Russian TV channel NTV broadcast a debate featuring only Ryzhkov and Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal politician who strongly supported economic reforms. At the election, he was elected to the State Duma Federal Assembly as an independent candidate. Once elected, he headed the Power to the People! bloc, a communist faction with nationalist tendencies. The Power to the People bloc came about through the merger of Ryzhkov&#x27;s supporters and the All-People&#x27;s Union headed by Sergey Baburin. Its policies were left-wing and included revival of the Soviet Union, the introduction of a planned economy, more state involvement in the economy and the promotion of nationalism and patriotism. In the Second State Duma &quot;Power to the People!&quot; sided with another national-patriotic forces in Narodovlastie faction, also led by Ryzhkov. During the 1996 presidential election, Ryzhkov endorsed Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) candidate, for the presidency.

In 1996, Ryzhkov was one of the founders of the CPRF-led alliance of leftists and nationalists known as the People&#x27;s Patriotic Union of Russia (NPSR) and was elected chairman of its Duma faction. The NPSR&#x27;s formal leaders were Ryzhkov and Zyuganov, who was an unofficial leader. In September 2003, Ryzhkov entered the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation as the representative for Belgorod Oblast, subsequently resigning his seat in the State Duma. He served as Chairman of the Federation Council Commission on Natural Monopolies, as a member of the Committee on Local Self-Governance and as co-chairman of the Russian–Armenian commission on inter-parliamentary cooperation. Ryzhkov resigned as a member of the Federation Council on 25 September 2023.

In 2014, Ryzhkov supported the introduction of Russian troops into Ukraine, and in 2022, he expressed his support for the annexation of four regions from Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Ryzkhov died in Moscow on 28 February 2024, at the age of 94.
He was buried at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery.

==Sanctions==
In March 2014, following the Crimean status referendum, the U.S. Treasury put Ryzhkov on the Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN), a list of individuals sanctioned as &quot;members of the Russian leadership&#x27;s inner circle.&quot; The sanctions freeze any assets he held in the US and banned him from entering the United States. On 17 March 2014, Ryzhkov was added to the European Union sanctions list due to his role in the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. He was barred from entering EU countries, and his assets in the EU were frozen.

==Awards, decorations, and orders==
Ryzhkov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour twice, in 1966 and 1985, the Order of the October Revolution in 1971, the Order of Lenin in 1976 and 1979 and the Order of Merit for the Fatherland, 4th class (27 September 2004 – for outstanding contribution to the strengthening of the Russian state and many years of diligent work). A monument in recognition of his significant personal contribution to the reconstruction in Armenia after the 1988 Spitak earthquake was erected by the Armenian Government. In 2008, the Armenian Government awarded Ryzhkov their highest state decoration, the National Hero of Armenia. The Ukrainian Government awarded him the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise, 5th class, &quot;for his outstanding contribution to the development of Russian–Ukrainian cooperation and on the occasion of his 75th birthday&quot; on 24 September 2004. The Russian President awarded Ryzhkov the Diploma of the President on 3 October 2009.

<text>Semmangudi Radhakrishna Srinivasa Iyer (25 July 1908 – 31 October 2003) was an Indian Carnatic vocalist. He was the youngest recipient of the Sangeetha Kalanidhi awarded by the Music Academy in 1947, a distinction he holds to this day as of 2024, probably the only musician to receive that honour before reaching 40. He had received many other awards as well, including Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan from the Government of India, Rajyasevanirata title from Travancore&#x27;s erstwhile ruling family, Sangeet Natak Academy award (1953), &quot;Isai Perarignar&quot; from Government of Tamil Nadu and Kalidas Samman from Government of Madhya Pradesh. He was affectionately addressed as &quot;Semmangudi Maama&quot; (Semmangudi Uncle) by his disciples. He was also considered the &quot;Pitamaha&quot; or the grand sire of modern Carnatic Music. He was conferred with an honorary doctorate by University of Kerala in 1979.

==Early life and training==
He was born in Tirukkodikaval, Tanjore district as the third son of Radhakrishna Iyer and Dharmasamvardhini Ammal into a Tamil Iyer Brahmin family. He lived with his maternal uncle Tirukkodikaval Krishna Iyer, a violin maestro, until the age of four and after his death, moved back to his parents&#x27; home in Semmangudi, Tiruvarur District. At the age of eight he started learning music from his cousin Semmangudi Narayanaswamy Iyer. This was followed by some rigorous training under Thiruvadaimaruthur Sakharama Rao, a famous Gottuvadhyam exponent, an event considered by Semmangudi as a turning point in his life. This was followed by another training stint with Narayanaswamy Iyer, during which time he learnt a lot of varnams and keerthanams. He also learned under vocalist Umayalpuram Swaminatha Iyer. Then he had a musical apprenticeship with Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer. In 1926, he performed his first music recital at Kumbakonam. In 1927 he gave a concert in the Madras session of Indian National Congress, another event considered by Semmangudi as a turning point in his life, as it catapulted him into the big league of vidwans at that time. He was known for producing soulful music, highly creative and yet very orthodox, despite a recalcitrant voice.

He was instrumental, along with Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar, for the work on the krithis of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma. After attending one of his concerts in 1934, Maharani Sethu Parvati Bai of Travancore was so impressed by his talent and scholarship that she invited him to come to Thiruvananthapuram to edit and popularise the compositions of Swati Tirunal. He succeeded Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar as Principal of the Swathi Thirunal College of Music at Thiruvananthapuram, a post he held for 23 years, until the age of 55. At this age, he handed over his responsibilities to another Carnatic legend, G. N. Balasubramaniam and at the behest of the Government of India, became the Chief Producer of Carnatic music at All India Radio, Madras from 1957 to 1960. In later life, he concentrated on concert performances and tutoring youngsters. He gave public concerts even after the age of 90.

==Concert performances==

Semmangudi was widely renowned for his virtuosity as a concert performer. He was famous for the meticulous planning that he put into every concert, including the choice of krithis, raagas and duration. He was also widely acknowledged as a master of improvisation, particularly in the form of niravals.

Semmangudi was noted for his choice of songs, speed in rendering swarams and his ability to combine choice and speed with Bhakti. Some most memorable concerts over the years had geniuses in accompaniment, including Pudukottai Dakshinamurthy Pillai, Kumbakonam Rajamanickam Pillai, Mysore T Chowdiah, Palghat Mani Iyer, Palani Subramaniam Pillai, Palghat R Raghu, Mavelikkara Velukkutty Nair, Karaikudi Mani, Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman, Lalgudi Jayaraman, Nagercoil S Harihara Iyer, T. N. Krishnan, Nagercoil S.Ganesa Iyer, Trichy Sankaran, Guruvayur Dorai, Vellore G. Ramabhadran. Some of his very famous renditions of kritis included Marubalka in Sri Ranjani raga, Chakkani Raja Margamu in Kharaharapriya, etc.

==Voice==

Semmangudi was well known for his uncharacteristically nasal voice in an era when practically every prominent Carnatic singer had an impeccable voice. In his youth, famous kanjira performer, Dhakshinamurti Pillai commented to his brother and teacher, &quot;His voice is as melodious as the noise created when a coconut shell is scraped on a rock. Don&#x27;t bother to give him vocal training. Let him learn to play the violin.&quot; Despite such criticism, Semmangudi worked hard to improve his voice through practice and rigorous training. In the end, his natural talent for music emerged victorious over his deficient voice and he became a phenomenon in the Carnatic world.

His singing style has been widely followed, and his most prominent disciples include Sangeetha Kalanidhis, M. S. Subbulakshmi and her stepdaughter Radha Viswanathan, T. M. Thiagarajan, and violinist Prof. T. N. Krishnan. His senior disciples include P. S. Narayanaswamy, Sri K. R. Kedaranathan, Smt. Seetha Rajan, V. Subramaniam (a.k.a. Rajamani),Smt Parassala Ponnammal, K.J.Yesudas, T.M.Krishna, Trivandrum G Seethalakshmi Ammal, Palai C. K. Ramachandran, Mavelikkara Prabhakara Varma, Prof. Kumara Kerala Varma, Vaigal S.Gnanaskandhan, Smt. Meera Kedaranathan, Kadayanallur Venkataraman, V. R. Krishnan, Smt. Seethalakshmi Venkatesan, Smt. Radha Namboodri, Smt. Visalakshi Ramachandran.

==Family==

At a very young age, he was married to Thayyu ammal. Thayyu ammal, he always acknowledged, was a pivotal factor in the success of his career. The entire family was run with stream line precision by Thayyu ammal, when he had to frequently travel for concerts and also spend most of his time involved in music.

<doc id="609520" wikidata="Q795565" url="?curid=609520" title="Common emerald dove">
<text>The emerald dove or common emerald dove (Chalcophaps indica), also called Asian emerald dove and grey-capped emerald dove, is a widespread resident breeding pigeon native to the tropical and subtropical parts of the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The dove is also known by the names of green dove and green-winged pigeon. The common emerald dove is the state bird of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The Pacific emerald dove and Stephan&#x27;s emerald dove were both considered conspecific.

==Taxonomy==
In 1743, the English naturalist George Edwards included a picture and a description of the common emerald dove in his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;Green Wing&#x27;d Dove&quot;. His drawing was made from a live bird at the home a merchant in Rotherhithe near London. Edwards was told that the dove had come from the East Indies. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the common emerald dove with all the other pigeons in the genus &quot;Columba&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Columba indica&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27;s work. The specific epithet &quot;indica&quot; is Latin for &quot;Indian&quot; and is used by Linnaeus to denote the East Indies. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Chalcophaps&quot; that was introduced by the English ornithologist John Gould in 1843.

Six subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. i. indica&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – India to south China, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesian and west Papuan islands
* &quot;C. i. robinsoni&quot; Baker, ECS, 1928 – Sri Lanka
* &quot;C. i. maxima&quot; Hartert, 1931 – Andaman Islands
* &quot;C. i. augusta&quot; Bonaparte, 1855 – Nicobar Islands
* &quot;C. i. natalis&quot; Lister, 1889 – Christmas Island (Indian Ocean)
* &quot;C. i. minima&quot; Hartert, 1931 – Numfor, Biak and Mios Num islands (off north New Guinea)

== Description ==
The common emerald dove is a stocky, medium-sized pigeon, typically in length. The back and wings are bright emerald green. The flight feathers and tail are blackish, and broad black and white bars show on the lower back in flight. The head and underparts are dark vinous pink, fading to greyish on the lower belly. The eyes are dark brown, the bill bright red and legs and feet rufous.
The male has a white patch on the edge of the shoulders and a grey crown, which the female lacks. Females will tend to have a browner complexion with a grey mark on the shoulder. Immature birds resemble females but have brown scallops on their body and wing plumage.

== Distribution and habitat ==
This is a common species in tropical forests and similar dense wet woodlands, farms and mangroves. It builds a scant stick nest in a tree up to five metres and lays two cream-coloured eggs.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Emerald doves usually occur singly, pairs or in small groups. They are quite terrestrial, often searching for fallen fruit on the ground and spending little time in trees except when roosting. They eat seeds and fruits of a wide variety of plants and are generally tame and approachable. They are usually found foraging in small groups or pairs. If there&#x27;s a resource-rich area, small groups will maintain a territory. 

Their flight is fast and direct, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. They often fly low between patches of dense forest, but when disturbed, they will frequently walk away rather than fly. They are particularly good weavers when flying through forests. When flying, they expose a buff underwing and a chestnut colour of their flight feathers.

The call is a low soft moaning cooing consisting of about six to seven coos, starting quietly and rising. They also call a nasal &quot;hoo-hoo-hoon&quot;. Males perform a bobbing dance during courtship.

<text>Joseph Charles Wilson IV (November 6, 1949 – September 27, 2019) was an American diplomat who was best known for his 2002 trip to Niger to investigate allegations that Saddam Hussein was attempting to purchase yellowcake uranium; his &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed piece, &quot;What I Didn&#x27;t Find in Africa&quot;; and the subsequent leaking by the Bush/Cheney administration of information pertaining to the identity of his wife Valerie Plame as a CIA officer. He also served as the CEO of a consulting firm he founded, JC Wilson International Ventures, and as the vice chairman of Jarch Capital, LLC.

==Early life and education==
Joseph Charles Wilson IV was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on November 6, 1949, to Joseph Charles Wilson III, and Phyllis (Finnell) Wilson; he grew up in California and Europe. He was raised in a &quot;proud Republican family&quot; in which &quot;there [was] a long tradition of politics and service to the farm&quot; and for which &quot;[p]olitics was a staple around the table&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s father Joe was a Marine pilot in World War II and narrowly escaped death by taking off immediately before the bombing of the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Franklin&quot;, in which 700 other American servicemen died.

In 1968, Wilson entered the University of California, Santa Barbara, majoring, he said, in &quot;history, volleyball, and surfing&quot; and maintaining a &quot;C&quot; average. He worked as a carpenter for five years after his 1972 graduation. Later, he received a graduate fellowship, studying public administration. Wilson was influenced by the Vietnam War protests of the late 1960s.

==Diplomatic career==

Diplomatic postings and government positions:
* 1976–1978: General Services Officer, Niamey, Niger
* 1978–1979: Administrative Office, Lomé, Togo
* 1979–1981: Administrative Officer, US State Department, Washington, D.C.
* 1981–1982: Administrative Officer, Pretoria, South Africa
* 1982–1985: Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), Bujumbura, Burundi
* 1985–1986: Congressional Fellow, offices of Senator Al Gore and Representative Tom Foley
* 1986–1988: DCM, Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo
* 1988–1991: DCM, Baghdad, Iraq
* 1992–1995: Ambassador to Gabon and São Tomé and Príncipe
* 1995–1997: Political Advisor (POLAD) to the Commander in Chief of US Armed Forces, Europe (EUCOM), Stuttgart, Germany
* 1997–1998: Special Assistant to President Bill Clinton and Senior Director for African Affairs, United States National Security Council, Washington, D.C.

Having become fluent in French as a teenager, Wilson entered the US Foreign Service in 1976, where he would be employed until 1998.

From January 1976 through 1998, he was posted in five African nations; as a general services officer in Niamey, Niger, (his first assignment) he was &quot;responsible for keeping the power on and the cars running, among other duties&quot;. From 1988 to 1991, he was the Deputy Chief of Mission (to US Ambassador to Iraq April Glaspie) at the US Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq. In the wake of Saddam&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, he became the last American diplomat to meet with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, sternly telling him in very clear terms to leave Kuwait. When Hussein sent a note to Wilson (along with other embassy heads in Baghdad) threatening to execute anyone sheltering foreigners in Iraq as a deterrent, Wilson publicly repudiated the President by appearing at a press conference wearing a homemade noose around his neck and declaring, &quot;If the choice is to allow American citizens to be taken hostage or to be executed, I will bring my own fucking rope.&quot;
Despite Hussein&#x27;s warnings, Wilson sheltered more than 100 Americans at the embassy and successfully evacuated several thousand people (Americans and other nationals) from Iraq. For his actions, he was called &quot;a true American hero&quot; by President George H. W. Bush. From 1992 to 1995, he served as US ambassador to Gabon and São Tomé and Príncipe.

From 1995 to 1997, Wilson served as Political Advisor (POLAD) to the Commander in Chief of US Armed Forces, Europe (EUCOM), in Stuttgart, Germany. From 1997 until 1998, when he retired, he helped direct Africa policy as Special Assistant to President Bill Clinton and as National Security Council Senior Director for African Affairs.

==Subsequent employment==
After retiring from government service in 1998, Wilson managed JC Wilson International Ventures Corp., an international business development and management company. Early in 2007, Wilson became vice chairman of Jarch Capital, LLC., to advise the firm on expansion in areas of Africa considered &quot;politically sensitive.&quot;

Wilson also served as a guest speaker and panelist in conferences and other programs devoted to African business policies and political affairs, as well as on the matters pertaining to the CIA leak scandal.

==Political involvement==
At the midpoint of his career as a diplomat, Wilson served for a year (1985–1986) as a Congressional Fellow in the offices of Senator Al Gore and Representative Tom Foley; he would later attribute his working for the Democratic Party to &quot;happenstance.&quot; That experience helped him gain his position as Special Assistant to President Bill Clinton and Senior Director for African Affairs, National Security Council, in 1997–1998.

Over the years, Wilson made contributions to the campaigns of Democratic candidates, such as Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts and Congressman Charles B. Rangel of New York, and to Republican Congressman Ed Royce of California. In 2000, he donated funds both to Gore&#x27;s and Bush&#x27;s presidential campaigns.
In 2003, Wilson endorsed John Kerry for president and donated to his campaign; in 2003 and 2004, he served as an advisor to and speechwriter for the campaign (410–12). Wilson endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2008 US presidential election. He made speeches on her behalf and attended fundraisers for the campaign. After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Wilson supported activist groups like Win Without War, a nonpartisan coalition of groups united in opposition to the Iraq War After the invasion and the publication of his memoir, &quot;The Politics of Truth&quot;, he spoke frequently in the public media and at colleges and universities.

==Trip to Niger==
In late February 2002, Wilson traveled to Niger at the CIA&#x27;s request to investigate the possibility that Saddam Hussein had purchased enriched yellowcake uranium. Wilson met with the current US Ambassador to Niger, Barbro Owens-Kirkpatrick (1999–2002) at the embassy and then interviewed dozens of officials who had been in the Niger government at the time of the supposed deal. He ultimately concluded: &quot;it was highly doubtful that any such transaction had ever taken place.&quot;

Wilson learned that the Iraqis had in fact requested a meeting to discuss &quot;expanding commercial relations&quot; but that Niger&#x27;s Prime Minister Mayaki had declined, due to concern about U.N. sanctions against Iraq.

==&quot;What I Didn&#x27;t Find in Africa&quot;==
President Bush&#x27;s 2003 State of the Union Address included these 16 words: &quot;The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.&quot;
In response, in the July 6, 2003, issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Wilson contributed an op-ed entitled &quot;What I Didn&#x27;t Find in Africa,&quot; in which he states that on the basis of his &quot;experience with the administration in the months leading up to the war&quot; he has &quot;little choice but to conclude that some of the intelligence related to Iraq&#x27;s nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.&quot;

Wilson described the basis for his mission to Niger as follows: &quot;The vice president&#x27;s office asked a serious question [about the truth of allegations that Iraq was seeking to purchase uranium yellowcake from Niger]. I was asked to help formulate the answer&quot;.

In the last two paragraphs of his op-ed, Wilson related his perspective to the Bush administration&#x27;s rationale for the Iraq War:

==Administration reactions to disclosure==

At a press conference on Monday, July 7, 2003, the day after the publication of the op-ed, Colin Powell said: &quot;There was sufficient evidence floating around at that time that such a statement was not totally outrageous or not to be believed or not to be appropriately used. It&#x27;s that once we used the statement, and after further analysis, and looking at other estimates we had, and other information that was coming in, it turned out that the basis upon which that statement was made didn&#x27;t hold up, and we said so, and we&#x27;ve acknowledged it, and we&#x27;ve moved on.&quot; He also said: &quot;the case I put down on the 5th of February [2003], for an hour and 20 minutes, roughly, on terrorism, on weapons of mass destruction, and on the human rights case ... we stand behind&quot;

In a July 11, 2003, statement, CIA director George Tenet, stated that the President, Vice President and other senior administration officials were not briefed on Wilson&#x27;s report (otherwise widely distributed in the intelligence community) because it &quot;did not resolve whether Iraq was or was not seeking uranium from abroad&quot;. In his 2007 memoir, Tenet wrote that Wilson&#x27;s report &quot;produced no solid answers&quot; and &quot;was never delivered to Cheney. In fact, I have no recollection myself of hearing about Wilson&#x27;s trip at the time.&quot;

In the July 11 statement, Tenet also noted that, according to Wilson&#x27;s report, a former Niger official interpreted an Iraqi approach as an &quot;overture as an attempt to discuss uranium sales.&quot; Asked about this the following October, Wilson said that the official in question had declined the meeting, due to U.N. Security Council sanctions against Iraq, but speculated &quot;maybe they might have wanted to talk about uranium&quot;.

There was substantial disagreement about whether Wilson implied in the op-ed that he was sent to Niger at the request of the vice president, or his office. The implication that Cheney or his office sent Wilson to Niger, whether made by Wilson or the media, was apparently a cause of consternation to vice-presidential aide I. Lewis Libby, who called NBC&#x27;s Tim Russert to complain.
On July 6, 2003, in a &quot;Meet the Press&quot; interview with Andrea Mitchell, Wilson stated: &quot;The question was asked of the CIA by the office of the vice president. The office of the vice president, I am absolutely convinced, received a very specific response to the question it asked and that response was based upon my trip out there.&quot;

==Disclosure of Valerie Plame&#x27;s identity==
The week after the publication of Wilson&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, Robert Novak, in his syndicated &quot;Washington Post&quot; column, disclosed that Wilson&#x27;s wife, Valerie Plame, worked for the CIA as an agency operative in an article entitled &quot;Mission to Niger.&quot; Subsequently, former Ambassador Wilson and others alleged that the disclosure was part of the Bush administration&#x27;s attempts to discredit his report about his investigations in Africa and the op-ed describing his findings because they did not support the government&#x27;s rationale for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Wilson&#x27;s allegations led to a federal investigation of the leak by the United States Department of Justice, to the appointment of a Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, and to the Plame affair grand jury investigation.

In 2005, retired US Army Major General Paul E. Vallely claimed that former Ambassador Wilson &quot;mentioned Plame&#x27;s status as a CIA employee&quot; in 2002 [one year before she was allegedly &quot;outed&quot;] in the Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;green room&quot; in Washington, D.C., as they waited to appear on air as analysts.

Although no one was &quot;indicted for actually leaking Plame&#x27;s identity,&quot; the investigation resulted in the federal criminal trial &quot;United States v. Libby&quot; in which Lewis Libby, the former Chief of Staff to Vice President of the United States, Dick Cheney, was tried on five federal felony counts. He was convicted on four of the counts, involving false statements, perjury, and obstruction of justice, none of which related directly to the Plame revelation but rather to his failure to cooperate with the subsequent investigation into the revelation. Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Libby&#x27;s prison sentence was commuted by President Bush, who let the conviction and fine stand. Libby was later granted a full pardon by President Trump.

==&quot;The Politics of Truth&quot;==
In 2004, Wilson published a political and personal memoir entitled &quot;The Politics of Truth: Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed My Wife&#x27;s CIA Identity: A Diplomat&#x27;s Memoir&quot;. The book describes his diplomatic career, his personal life and family, and his experiences during the Valerie Plame affair. Wilson&#x27;s autobiographical account of over two decades of his life in foreign service includes detailed descriptions of his extensive diplomatic-career experiences, his first marriage and family, briefer references to his second marriage, his meeting of Valerie Plame, their courtship and marriage, and a detailed narrative of the events leading to his decision to go public with his criticisms of the George W. Bush administration and its aftermath.

==Commentaries==
An editorial in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published in mid-July 2004, finds some justification for his perspective presented in &quot;What I Didn&#x27;t Find in Africa&quot;, but highlights some evidence of Iraq&#x27;s &quot;attempts&quot; at acquiring uranium yellowcake from African nations such as Niger, on which Iraq did not follow through.

But another editorial published July 13, 2005, in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; asserts that Wilson had lied in his &quot;What I Didn&#x27;t Find in Africa&quot; about &quot;what he&#x27;d discovered in Africa, how he&#x27;d discovered it, what he&#x27;d told the CIA about it, or even why he was sent on the mission.&quot;

An editorial headlined &quot;A Good Leak&quot; published April 9, 2006, in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; claims that &quot;Mr. Wilson was the one guilty of twisting the truth and that, in fact, his report [to the CIA] supported the conclusion that Iraq had sought uranium.&quot;

Some commentators and newspaper readers believed that this &quot;Washington Post&quot; editorial contradicted a news article in the paper&#x27;s same issue, which reported that the administration had misrepresented its actual confidence level in the intelligence reports that Hussein was seeking uranium.

Complaints to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ombudsman Deborah Howell about the apparent contradiction between the article and editorial, resulted in her acknowledging &quot;the high wall between editorial and news&quot; and also that &quot;it would have been helpful if the editorial had put statements about Wilson in more context&quot;.

==Richard Armitage==
In their 2006 book &quot;Hubris&quot;, Michael Isikoff and David Corn assert that it was Richard Armitage, Deputy Secretary of State, who first revealed that Wilson&#x27;s wife worked for the CIA to Robert Novak sometime before July 8, 2003. In late August 2006, along with advance publicity for the book, news accounts and editorials began focusing on that public revelation: &quot;Richard L. Armitage, a former deputy secretary of state, has acknowledged that he was the person whose conversation with a columnist in 2003 prompted a long, politically laden criminal investigation in what became known as the C.I.A. leak case, a lawyer involved in the case said on Tuesday [August 29, 2006].&quot;

Wilson and his wife then amended their civil lawsuit (see below) to add Armitage as a defendant along with Vice President Dick Cheney and I. Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby. According to their complaint, Richard Armitage was being sued individually (independently of his White House colleagues) for having nevertheless also violated Plame&#x27;s right to privacy and property (ability to make a living), while not reducing the culpability of the others as claimed.

In a column posted in TownHall.com on September 14, 2006, however, Novak disputes details of Armitage&#x27;s contemporaneous media accounts of their conversations. According to Novak, &quot;Armitage did not, as he now indicates, merely pass on something he had heard and that he &#x27;thought&#x27; might be so. Rather, he identified to me the CIA division where Mrs. Wilson worked, and said flatly that she recommended the mission to Niger by her husband, former Amb. Joseph Wilson. Second, Armitage did not slip me this information as idle chitchat, as he now suggests. He made clear he considered it especially suited for my column.&quot; He noted that critics would not be able to &quot;fit Armitage into the left-wing fantasy of a well-crafted White House conspiracy to destroy Joe and Valerie Wilson. The news that he and not Karl Rove was the leaker was devastating news for the Left.&quot;

In the &quot;American Journalism Review&quot;, editor Rem Rieder noted that the disclosure that Armitage was Novak&#x27;s &quot;primary source&quot; was insufficiently covered in the media.

==Reactions to the Libby trial and commutation==
In response to the verdict on March 6, 2007, finding Lewis Libby guilty of four of the five charges in the Fitzgerald grand jury indictment against him, the Wilsons issued a statement in a press release posted on the website of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. They stated that they respected the jury&#x27;s verdict and believed justice was done, as well as affirming their commitment to pursuing their civil suit.

Wilson criticized President George W. Bush&#x27;s July 2, 2007, commutation of Lewis Libby&#x27;s prison sentence, calling it &quot;a cover-up of the Vice President&#x27;s role in this matter and quite possibly the role of the President and/or some of his senior White House advisers.&quot; Wilson also complained that the President&#x27;s action and others&#x27; actions leading to President Bush&#x27;s commutation of Libby&#x27;s sentence could seriously damage United States national security by harming its intelligence capability.

==Warner Bros. feature film==
On the evening of the verdict in the Libby trial, Joseph C. Wilson appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, during which he announced that he and his wife had &quot;signed a deal with Warner Bros of Hollywood to offer their consulting services—or maybe more—in the making of the forthcoming movie about the Libby trial&quot;, their lives and the CIA leak scandal. According to an article by Michael Fleming published in &quot;Variety&quot; earlier in the week, the feature film, a co-production between Weed Road&#x27;s Akiva Goldsman and Jerry and Janet Zucker of Zucker Productions, with a screenplay by Jez and John Butterworth, is based in part on Valerie Wilson&#x27;s then-forthcoming book &quot;Fair Game&quot;, whose publication, in October 2007, after a delay of two months, was contingent on CIA clearances.

The film, &quot;Fair Game&quot;, was released November 5, 2010, starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn. It is based on two books, one written by Wilson, and the other by his wife.

==Civil suit==

On July 13, 2006, Joseph and Valerie Wilson filed a civil suit against Vice President Dick Cheney, his former Chief of Staff I. Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, top Presidential advisor Karl Rove, and other unnamed senior White House officials (among whom they later added Richard Armitage), for their alleged role in the public disclosure of Valerie Wilson&#x27;s classified CIA status.
On September 13, 2006, Joseph and Valerie Wilson amended their original lawsuit, adding Richard Armitage as a fourth defendant. Unlike their charges against Rove, Cheney, and Libby, &quot;claiming that they had violated her constitutional rights and discredited her by disclosing that she was an undercover CIA operative&quot;, the Wilsons sued Armitage &quot;for violating the &#x27;Wilsons&#x27; constitutional right to privacy, Mrs. Wilson&#x27;s constitutional right to property, and for committing the tort of publication of private facts.&#x27;&quot;

===Dismissal===
United States District Court for the District of Columbia Judge John D. Bates dismissed the Wilsons&#x27; lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds on July 19, 2007, stating that the Wilsons had not shown that the case belonged in federal court. Bates also ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction over the claim because the couple had not yet exhausted their administrative remedies. Bates stated that the lawsuit raised &quot;important questions relating to the propriety of actions undertaken by our highest government officials&quot; but also noted that &quot;there can be no serious dispute that the act of rebutting public criticism, such as that levied by Mr. Wilson against the Bush administration&#x27;s handling of prewar foreign intelligence, by speaking with members of the press is within the scope of defendants&#x27; duties as high-level Executive Branch officials&quot;, even if &quot;the alleged means by which defendants chose to rebut Mr. Wilson&#x27;s comments and attack his credibility&quot; were perhaps &quot;highly unsavory.&quot;

===Appeal===
On July 20, 2007, Ms. Sloan and the Wilsons announced publicly that they had filed an appeal of the US District Court&#x27;s decision to dismiss their lawsuit. On August 12, 2008, in a 2–1 decision, the three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the dismissal. Melanie Sloan, of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which represents the Wilsons, &quot;said the group will request the full D.C. Circuit to review the case and appeal to the US Supreme Court.&quot; Agreeing with the Bush administration, the Obama Justice Department argues the Wilsons have no legitimate grounds to sue. On the current justice department position, Sloan stated: &quot;We are deeply disappointed that the Obama administration has failed to recognize the grievous harm top Bush White House officials inflicted on Joe and Valerie Wilson. The government&#x27;s position cannot be reconciled with President Obama&#x27;s oft-stated commitment to once again make government officials accountable for their actions.&quot; 

On June 21, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal.

==Personal life and death==
Wilson&#x27;s first marriage was to college friend Susan Otchis in 1974. In 1979, the couple had a set of twins, Sabrina Cecile and Joseph Charles V. The marriage ended in divorce in 1986, toward the end of his service in Burundi. Wilson married his second wife Jacqueline, a French diplomat raised in Africa, in 1986. Though Wilson and Jacqueline began to live separate lives in the 1990s, they did not divorce until 1998. Wilson had met Valerie Plame in 1997, while working for President Bill Clinton; they married in 1998, after Wilson&#x27;s divorce from Jacqueline. They had two children, twins Trevor Rolph and Samantha Finnell Diana, born in 2000; the family moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 2006. Wilson and Plame divorced in 2017.

Wilson died at his home in Santa Fe, on September 27, 2019, as a result of organ failure.

<text>ELSHAM (abbreviation of &quot;Lembaga Studi dan Advokasi Hak Asasi Manusia&quot;, meaning Institute of Human Rights Studies and Advocacy) is a human rights non-governmental organization based in Jayapura, Papua, Indonesia. ELSHAM is the leading Papuan human rights organization. It was established in 1996 by the Roman Catholic Church, the Jayapura diocese of the Evangelical Christian Church in West Papua (GKI), and the Gospel Tabernacle Church of Indonesia (GKII).

ELSHAM leader John Rumbiak fled to the United States in 2002 following threats by the Indonesian police.

In June 2003 the Indonesian Military Commander, Maj. Gen. Nurdin Zainal, issued orders for the arrest of:
# John Rumbiak, Supervisor of ELSHAM
# Yohanis G. Bonay, Director of ELSHAM
# &quot;Koran Tempo&quot;, a Jakarta-based daily
# the editor of &quot;Koran Tempo&quot;
# &quot;Suara Karya&quot;, a Jakarta-based daily
# the editor of &quot;Suara Karya&quot;
upon charges of publishing a story about TNI (Indonesian military) troops ambushing a bus. The incident in question occurred August 31, 2002 when a bus carrying employees and family from the Freeport International school was attacked. Three teachers (including two Americans) were killed, 14 others were injured. Local statements and FBI investigations in 2003 attempted to tie the shooting to Papuan rebels, but the connection was unsupported by evidence.

<doc id="609528" wikidata="Q1164849" url="?curid=609528" title="Tie (draw)">
<text>A draw or tie occurs in a competitive sport when the results are identical or inconclusive. Ties or draws are possible in some, but not all, sports and games. Such an outcome, sometimes referred to as deadlock, can also occur in other areas of life such as politics, business, and wherever there are different factions regarding an issue.

==Terminology==
The word &quot;tie&quot; is usually used in North America, whereas the word &quot;draw&quot; is usual elsewhere.

==Resolving ties or draws==
In instances where a winner must be determined, several methods are commonly used. Across various sports:
* Some other measure may be used, such as aggregate point difference.
* A game may continue on in extra time. To ensure a quick result, some form of sudden death rule may apply.
* In some sports, a penalty shootout or bowl-out may occur.
* A rematch may occur at a later date, especially if a winner must be selected (in a final).
* The result might be decided by chance (&quot;e.g.&quot; a toss of a coin) when no objective method of determining a result remains.

The rules governing the resolution of drawn matches are rarely uniform across an entire sport, and are usually specified by the rules of the competition.

===Politics===

In other areas, such as in a vote, there may be a method to break the tie. Having an odd number of voters is one solution—after the election of the Doge of Venice by a committee of 40 was deadlocked in a tie, the number of electors was increased to 41—but may not always be successful, for example, if a member is absent or abstains, or if there are more than two candidates. In many cases one member of an assembly may by convention not normally vote, but will exercise a casting vote in case of deadlock. Sometimes some method of random choice, such as tossing a coin, may be resorted to, even in a formal vote.

In some legislative bodies, a casting vote can only be exercised according to strict rules or constitutional conventions. For example, the Speaker of the British House of Commons (a position whose functions and conventions of operation inspire similar roles in several other nations using the Westminster system) is expected by convention to follow Speaker Denison&#x27;s rule (i.e. to vote to allow further discussion, if this is possible, and otherwise to vote in favour of the &quot;status quo&quot;). This in effect means &quot;Yes/Yea/Aye&quot; on the first and second reading of a bill, &quot;No/Nay&quot; on the third, &quot;Yes/Yea/Aye&quot; on the government&#x27;s budget, and &quot;No/Nay&quot; on a motion of no confidence.

==Examples of two-player games==

===Chess===

Chess has five ways of ending or achieving a draw from an opponent: stalemate, agreement between the players, the fifty-move rule (and its extension, seventy-five-move rule), threefold repetition (and its extension, fivefold repetition), or neither player having sufficient material to checkmate. At top-level play, roughly half of games end in a draw.

===Boxing===
When a match ends with completion of the specified maximum number of rounds, and the judges of the match have awarded an equal number of points to both boxers, or if there are three judges (as is the custom) and one judge awards the fight to one fighter, another awards the fight to the opposing fighter, and the third scores it a draw (split draw), the match is declared a draw. The contest would be scored a draw even if two of three judges score it a draw and the third does not (a majority draw). Draws are relatively rare in boxing: certain scoring systems make it impossible for a judge to award equal points for a match. If a championship bout ends in a draw, the champion usually retains the title.

If there is a draw in a quarterfinal or a semifinal match of a tournament, a tiebreaker round is played instead.

===Sumo===
In professional sumo, draws were once common place but are no longer used in any situation. In situations that would have resulted in draws (such as close results, exhaustion, or injury) are currently resolved with immediate rematches, temporary breaks, or forfeiture.

===Tennis===
In most professional tennis matches, a tiebreaker rule applies in each set to avoid lengthy matches, as happens quite frequently if the traditional tennis rule for winning a set is followed. When players reach a score of 6–all in a set, instead of continuing the set until one opponent wins with a two-game difference, a special game is played to decide the winner of the set; the winner is the first to reach at least seven points with a difference of two over the opponent. This however did not apply to the final set of matches at the French Open, allowing the total number of games in a match to be virtually unlimited (for example, the final set of the Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships ended only when John Isner beat Nicolas Mahut 70–68). The Australian Open and Wimbledon Championships did not use a final set tiebreaker through the 2018 tournaments, but began to use a tiebreaker from 2019 (For Wimbledon, the final set tiebreaker occurred after 24 games in the final set, from 2019 to 2021).

Since 2022, all Grand Slam tournaments, including the Olympics in 2024, now use 10-point final set tiebreaker games, with a 2-point lead minimum. If the tiebreaker game deciding the match is tied at 9-all, whoever scores two straight points wins.

===Video games===
In versus-fighting games, a draw occurs when both players end the match through a &quot;double KO&quot;; or via &quot;time over&quot;, with the same percentage of life bar. For example, some of these games, such as &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Tekken&quot;, require two rounds to win the match, and if after a third round the score ends in a 1–1 draw, the players have to fight again in an extra round. If this extra round ends in a draw, the game will end for both players. In &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, if a round ends when the time runs out and both players have complete life bars, the game ends for both players, because due to &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;″s gameplay (in which &quot;every&quot; common hit takes block damage) it is virtually impossible for a round to end tied, and that means the players were not playing for real. In the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, if two or more players have equal lives or points at the end of a match, a sudden death period begins with each fighter having 300% damage, essentially making it so a single hit can win the match. This is also true in &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series and &quot;X-Men: Children of the Atom&quot;. In &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium&quot;, a draw awards the round to both sides but favours the CPU if it&#x27;s a decider i.e. the player is still the loser and must restart the stage even though they technically tied.

==Examples of multi-player games==

===American football===
Tied games, which were commonplace in the National Football League (NFL) through the 1960s, had become exceedingly rare with the introduction of sudden death overtime, which first applied to the regular season in 1974. The first game this new rule applied to ended in a tie between the Denver Broncos and Pittsburgh Steelers. However, modifications to overtime rules within the past ten years have actually made ties somewhat more common. The most recent NFL tied game occurred on December 4, 2022, when a game between the Washington Commanders and New York Giants ended in a 20–all tie after overtime.

* In the NFL, if the team having first possession in overtime scores only a field goal, the other team receives the ball and can either tie the game with a field goal resulting in continuation of overtime (which then becomes sudden death) or score a touchdown, thereby winning the game. This modified sudden death rule was instituted during the 2010 playoffs and adopted for the 2012 regular season. If the overtime period ends with the score tied, either because both teams scored field goals on their initial possessions and failed to score again or neither team scored throughout the duration of the overtime period, then the game ends in a tie. Tied games are listed as part of a team&#x27;s official record, counting in the team&#x27;s winning percentage as half a win and half a loss. A game ending in a scoreless tie has never occurred since the introduction of overtime. The exception to this rule is the playoffs. In the playoffs additional overtime periods are played until a winner is determined.

:Ties were at one point so rare in the modern league that after Donovan McNabb and other Philadelphia Eagles players said—when the team and the Cincinnati Bengals tied 1313 in 2008—that they did not know that a game could end in a tie, Ben Roethlisberger estimated that 50% of players did not know. After rookie Najee Harris and other players on both teams admitted in 2021—after the Steelers tied the Detroit Lions 16–16—that they had expected the game to continue, NFL.com wrote that since McNabb, &quot;it seems every time a game ends without a victor, at least one player admits he didn&#x27;t know it was possible&quot;.

* In National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college football, overtime was introduced in 1996, eliminating ties except in severe weather or curfew situations. When a game goes to overtime, each team is given one possession from its opponent&#x27;s twenty-five-yard line with no game clock, despite the one timeout per period and use of play clock. The team leading after both possessions is declared the winner. If the teams remain tied, the team that started second starts the second overtime. If a team scores a touchdown, it must attempt a two-point conversion. If the teams remain tied after this session, the teams alternate attempting two-point conversions (a single play from the 3 yard line) until the tie is resolved.
** The unpopularity of ties in American sports is reflected in the saying, &quot;A tie is like kissing your sister.&quot; The earliest known use of the phrase was by Navy football coach Eddie Erdelatz after a scoreless tie against Duke in 1953.
**The 1968 Yale vs. Harvard football game ended in a 29–29 tie, but the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; student newspaper famously printed the headline &quot;Harvard Beats Yale 29–29&quot;.
** 6 October 1990: Kansas and Iowa State end their game in a 34–34 tie, giving KU the all-time NCAA Division I-A record for number of tied games with 57. Illinois State holds the Division I-AA record for ties with 66. Since then, NCAA football games have a tie-breaking rule, so only an extenuating circumstances game suspended on account of weather, or a rule change reinstating ties would allow this record to be broken. The 1995/96 school year was the last to feature non-weather curtailed tied games.
** NCAA Rule 3-3-3, Suspending the Game, permits tied games primarily on weather. NCAA rules on inclement weather include policies on lightning, requiring a minimum 30-minute delay upon the first detected lightning strike within of the venue, and each lightning strike detected inside the radius results in an automatic resetting of the clock. Officially, a tied game can only be declared if the teams agree to, or the conference declares the game, a draw, because of severe weather conditions if the game is an official game, and cannot be continued at a reasonable time (curfew, travel logistics, weather warnings) with the game tied. Official tied games can take place if the score is tied at any time when the game is suspended, including tie games at the end of regulation or any time during an overtime period. During overtime periods, if one team has scored in their overtime period, but the second team has yet to complete its overtime period when play is terminated because of weather or curfew, as in baseball, the score in the overtime period is wiped out and the game ends in a tie.

===Association football===
If both sides have scored an equal number of goals within regulation time (90 minutes), the game is usually counted as a draw. In elimination games, where a winner must be determined to progress to the next stage of the tournament, two periods of extra time are played. If the score continues tied even after this time, the match technically remains a draw; however, a penalty shootout is used to determine which team is to progress to the next stage of the tournament. In some competitions, the extra time may be skipped and the match goes straight to penalties after a drawn 90 minutes.

Some competitions, such as the FA Cup, employ a system of replays where the drawn match is repeated at the ground of the away team in the first game. Although this was a widely used tiebreaker, it fell out of favour after excessive replays caused organisational and practicality issues.

In two-leg, home-and-away fixtures in which a winner must be determined at the end of the second leg, the away goals rule may be employed if teams&#x27; aggregate scores over two legs are level; the rule gives victory to whichever team scored more in its respective away leg. Typically the rule may be invoked both to obviate extra time and after extra time to obviate a penalty shootout. All UEFA (European) club competitions used away goals until 2021; by contrast, CONMEBOL (South America) competitions did not use this rule until 2005, but also stopped using it since 2022. Major League Soccer, the Tier One league in the United States and Canada, did not adopt the away goals rule until 2014.

===Australian rules football===
Draws in Australian rules football have occurred at an average of two per season (under the current fixture). If a draw occurs during a regular season match, the result stands as a draw, and both teams earn premiership points equivalent to half of a win (two points, or one in South Australian competition).

Traditionally, when a draw occurred during a finals match, the match would be replayed the following week, but the Australian Football League introduced extra time to finals (except for the Grand Final) in 1991 following the logistical difficulties that arose after the 1990 Qualifying Final between Collingwood and West Coast was drawn, and introduced extra time to Grand Finals in 2016.

Where used, extra time typically consists of two periods, each three minutes long (plus time-on if applicable), with winner being the team ahead after both periods; if scores are still level at the end of extra time, this process is repeated, with additional two 3-minute periods being played as needed until a winner can be determined.

===Baseball===
Ties are relatively rare in baseball, since the practice dating back to the earliest days of the game is to play extra innings until one side has the lead after an equal number of innings played. Nonetheless a game can be called a tie in some situations, usually in a case where one or both teams have used all available pitchers. Games can be called after fifth innings in extenuating circumstances, such as suspension due to bad weather.

For some amateur and international games, tiebreakers are used prompting an earlier conclusion during extra innings: If a tiebreaker is used, after a certain extra innings (usually 3 or 4, determined by organizer before the tournament), the innings will start with the previous two batters loaded.

*In Major League Baseball, a game may end in a tie only due to weather or, historically, darkness (a called game due to darkness is unlikely to happen now that all Major League parks have floodlights; darkness also means reaching the curfew prohibiting innings from starting after 1 am local time). While any game that has reached 5 full innings is statistically official, a tied game does not count in the standings. Before 2007, tied games ended by weather were replayed from the start, but since 2007, the games are continued from where they left off. A tied game may also be declared if a game is tied, the two teams are not scheduled to play again for the remainder of the year, and the game does not affect playoff implications; a recent example occurred on 29 September 2016, between the Chicago Cubs and the Pittsburgh Pirates.
**The 2002 All-Star Game was declared a tie after eleven innings, due to a lack of pitchers; this decision was considered controversial, and from the following season through 2016, MLB awarded home field advantage in the World Series to the league that won the game to prevent such a situation.
*In Japan, a game in regular season play could last no more than 4 hours, 30 minutes, or for night games (especially in the Pacific League), 3 hours, 30 minutes for transportation reasons. By 1987, the rule was changed to a limit of three extra innings for a total of 12 innings, where the game is declared a tie if the score is even after the limit is reached. The rule was adopted for interleague and Climax Series (the postseason three-team stepladder playoff to determine the team playing in the Japan Series) when they were adopted. In regular season play, ties do not count against a team, however, and are &quot;discarded&quot; for purposes of winning percentage. If teams are tied in the won-loss percentage at the end of the season, the team with the better head-to-head record wins the tiebreaker. If a tie occurred in the Climax Series (tied series in the first round or 2–3–1 with the first-place team winning two games, the team winning the first round winning three, and one game is tied), the team with better standing in that regular season advances.
**During the Japan Series, prior to 1986, the rule was four hours, 30 minutes from the start of the first pitch. 
**Starting in 1987, the rule changed from time to innings. 
*** From 1987 to 1993, up to nine extra innings could be played, for a limit of 18 innings in the first seven games.
*** From 1994 until 2017, up to six extra innings could be played, for a limit of 15 innings in the first seven games.
*** Since 2018, the postseason rule is the same as the regular season, thus Game 1 between the Hiroshima Carp and the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks ended in a 2-2 12 inning draw. 
*** Since 2021, if further games (Game 8, et. al.) are tied after 12 innings, the WBSC baseball tiebreaker of runners on first and second base will be used to start the 13th inning.
** If no team has won the series after seven games, all subsequent games starting with game eight will be played until there is a winner.
**During the 2011 season and 2012 regular season, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami resulted in special rule changes for energy conservation. All night games had a 3-hour, 30-minute limit (similar to the Pacific League), and no extra innings were played. If a game was tied at the time limit or after the 9th inning, game ended in a tie. The rule did not apply to the 2011 Japan Series, and was later lifted before the beginning of the 2012 Climax Series.
**Unlike MLB, NPB&#x27;s All-star games do not include extra innings. Therefore, a tie will be declared if 9 innings have been played if neither side is leading.
*In Taiwan&#x27;s CPBL, the same rule as NPB applies in the regular season. In the Taiwan Series, there is no limit to the number of innings in a game, but any game that has reached official game status and is tied when a game is called because of weather is an official tied game. (Amended in 2011).
*In NCAA college baseball, a conference will declare a game may be tied in extenuating circumstances, usually in the final game of a series only, or in non-conference midweek games:
** The game reaches curfew time, to allow the visiting team to travel home for classes the next day. Often, the curfew time will be early, forcing the game to be started early. In the Southeastern Conference, for example, the visiting team shall post travel details and a designated departure time to the home team prior to the start of the season, with no game starting later than 1 pm local time if a team is using commercial air travel. No half-inning may start within 15 minutes of the designated departure time. All rules for inclement weather in official games after the sixth inning are in effect.
** Once an inning begins, if the visiting team has scored at least one run to tie or take the lead, but the home team has not finished its turn to bat in the inning, the entire inning can be wiped off and the game score reverted to the end of the previous full inning.
** In an extra inning, this will result in a tie game being declared.
*** However, if a game starts late, and the trailing team is at bat at the 15-minute point, and ties or takes the lead during that point, the game can be declared a tie. The trailing team cannot win the game until the entire inning in question has been completed.
*Many amateur baseball leagues include tied games in the standing if an official game is called for darkness or rain with a tie score. Ofttimes a point system is used for standings, with two points being awarded for a win, and one for a tie.
*For Japanese&#x27;s High-School level baseball, which they are held in form of single-elimination knockout tournaments, prior to a 2018 rule adopting the WBSC tiebreaker, a tie was declared after 15 innings (18 innings before 2001) with a replayed game the next day. Since the 2018 tournament, all games adopted the WBSC tiebreakers in 13th inning with the exception of both Koushien finals: those games can still declare as tie (and rematched) like previous rule, and only during the replayed game will the tiebreaker be in effect starting with the 13th inning.
*In International level games, tiebreaker rule are introduced in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The finals of the 2009 World Baseball Classic is the first international game using under this rule.

===Basketball===
Ties are somewhat rare in basketball due to the high-scoring nature of the game: if the score is tied at the end of regulation, the rules provide that as many extra periods as necessary will be played until one side has a higher score.

===Cricket===
Cricket distinguishes between a &quot;tie&quot; and a &quot;draw&quot;, which are two possible results of a game:
*A tie is the &quot;identical&quot; result that occurs when each team has scored the same total number of runs after their allotted innings, all innings being completed. This is very rare in Test cricket and has happened only twice in its long history, but they are slightly more commonplace in first-class and limited-overs matches. In some forms of one-day cricket, such as Twenty20, a Super Over or a bowl-out is used as a tiebreaker to decide a result that would otherwise be a tie. See this list of tied games.
*A draw is the &quot;inconclusive&quot; result that occurs when the allotted playing time for the game expires without the teams having completed their innings. This is relatively common, occurring in 20–30% of Test Matches. A team with little hope of victory will try to play out the remaining time and cause a draw. The principal purpose of a declaration is for a team who are leading to avoid consuming time and increasing the chances of a draw. Limited-overs matches cannot be drawn, although they can end with a &quot;no result&quot; if abandoned because of weather or other factors.

===Ice hockey===
If the score is even after three periods, the game may end in a tie, or overtime may be played. In most North American professional leagues, the regular-season tie-breaker is five minutes long, with each side playing at least one man short. Starting with the 2015–16 NHL season, the National Hockey League went from playing one man short to two men short in overtime. Should a team have two players penalised during the overtime, the team on the power play will play with a fifth player. In the Southern Professional Hockey League, each side plays only three players, with a minor penalty in the first three minutes resulting in a team on the power play earning an extra man; a minor penalty in the final two minutes, or a major penalty, results in the awarding of a penalty shot. A goal wins the game in sudden death; otherwise, a shootout will occur, with three players participating for each side. If the score is still tied, the shootout will go into sudden death. In North American minor leagues, the same procedure is used except shootouts are five players. In each case, the winner of the shootout is awarded credit for a regulation win (two points), and the loser of the overtime is marked with an overtime loss (OTL) and receives credit equal to half of one win (one point). In the National Hockey League, shootout wins are still counted as two points, but for breaking a tie in terms of points at the end of the season, the team with more regulation and overtime wins (ROW) takes the higher position in the standings. The Swedish Hockey League (SHL) uses a 3–2–1–0 point system in the regular season, where a regulation win is worth three points, a win in the five-minute sudden death overtime period or a shootout win two points, and an overtime loss as well as a shootout loss one point in the standings.

In the National Hockey League, in the playoffs, in general unlimited 20-minute sudden death periods are played, making a tie impossible. An exception occurred during the 1988 Finals, when a power failure forced the early abandonment of Game 4 between the Boston Bruins and the Edmonton Oilers with the score tied 3–3. The game was later replayed in its entirety, with the Oilers winning and sweeping the Finals except for the one shortened tied game.

===Tournament poker===
Ties rarely occur, since multiple simultaneous player eliminations will rank the eliminated players by chip counts. However, if two or more players are eliminated in one hand, and both players started the hand with identical chip counts, the players will be tied in official rankings. It is impossible for poker tournaments to end in a tie (since one player must end up with all the chips), though multiple players may be tied for second (or lower) place.

===Racing sports===

In racing sports, if competitors appear to finish simultaneously and no technology (such as a photo finish) can separate them, this is considered a &quot;dead heat&quot; and in most cases the competitors tie for the place.

====Horse racing====
The term &quot;dead heat&quot; originally came from when horse racing from when horses used to race in matches consisting of multiple heats, rather than single races, with the total number of wins for horses determining winner of the match. When the judges could not determine the first horse over the finish line, the heat was declared &quot;dead&quot;, and did not count. If there is a dead heat, wagers are paid on all winning horses, but against half the original stake (or one-third if there were three tied horses, and so on). See List of dead heat horse races.

====Motorsport====
Ties in motor racing almost never occur. Nearly all modern racing cars and motorcycles carry electronic transponders which relay precise timing information down to the thousandths of a second. However, a photo-finish camera is used at the finish line, and if the two vehicles cross the line together, the position may be declared a tie. The 1974 Firecracker 400 is the only case in modern NASCAR history where a tie has occurred in a position; Cale Yarborough and Buddy Baker tied for third after 160 laps. At the 2002 United States Formula One Grand Prix, Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher attempted to stage a dead heat with teammate Rubens Barrichello but &quot;failed by a little&quot; as Schumacher said, finishing 0.011 seconds behind Barrichello. The F1 Sporting Regulations provide that in the event of a dead heat in a race, points and prizes will be added together and shared equally among the tying drivers.

In Grand Prix motorcycle racing, dead heats are avoided by fastest lap times being a tiebreaking measure. This rule resulted in Héctor Faubel winning the 125cc classification of the 2011 German motorcycle Grand Prix after a photo finish could not separate him and Johann Zarco.

===Rugby league===
In the premier Australasian rugby league competition, the National Rugby League, draws are possible but first are subject to golden point overtime. Golden point also applies to the State of Origin series and Four Nations matches. In rugby league in the United Kingdom, draws can also occur, as in league games, if the score of both teams remain level by the end of 80 minutes play, the game ends a draw, and each team is awarded one point in the league rather than two for a win.

===Rugby union===
Draws are uncommon in rugby union due to the variety of different ways to score and different values for each type of score. Draws are allowed to stand in league play. In the knockout stages of the Rugby World Cup, two 10-minute periods of extra time are played. If there is still no winner, a 10-minute period of sudden death is played where any score wins the game. Should the result still be tied a place-kicking competition is held where 5 players from each side take one kick each from anywhere on the 22-metre line (usually straight in front of the posts). The semi-final of the Heineken Cup between Cardiff Blues and Leicester Tigers at the Millennium Stadium was decided by a &quot;kick-off&quot;. After five kicks per team, the scores were level at 4–4 after Johne Murphy (Leicester) and Tom James (Cardiff) had missed their kicks. Moving now to sudden death, the score continued to 6–6 but, after Martyn Williams pulled his kick wide, Leicester number eight Jordan Crane scored to send Leicester Tigers to the Heineken Cup Final in Edinburgh. In certain knockout competitions, if the scores are drawn after 80 minutes, the teams that have scored the most tries are considered the victors. However, if the number of tries scored are equal, the teams proceed to play overtime.

==Notes==
:1.In most tournament settings, sudden death is not used for breaking ties, with most rulesets awarding the game to the player with more lives, or whoever has taken less damage if they have the same amount of lives.

<text>Iseult (), alternatively Isolde () and other spellings, is the name of several characters in the legend of Tristan and Iseult. The most prominent is Iseult of Ireland, the wife of Mark of Cornwall and the lover of Tristan. Her mother, the queen of Ireland, is also named Iseult. The third is Iseult of the White Hands, the daughter of Hoel of Brittany and the sister of Kahedin.

==Name==
Her name is variably given as Iseult, Isolde, Yseult, Ysolt, Isode, Isoude, Iseut, Isaut (Old French), Iosóid (Irish), Esyllt (Welsh), Ysella (Cornish), Isolda (Portuguese, Spanish), Izolda (Serbian) and Isotta (Italian), among others. The oldest source, Béroul&#x27;s 12th-century romance, spells her name as &quot;Yseut&quot; or &quot;Iseut&quot;. The etymology is uncertain, with most sources linking it to the Old High German words &quot;īs&quot; (&quot;ice&quot;) and &quot;hiltja&quot; (&quot;battle&quot;). Other writers derive it from a Brythonic *&quot;Adsiltia&quot;, &quot;she who is gazed upon.&quot;

==Iseult of Ireland==
The Irish princess, Iseult of Ireland is the daughter of King Anguish of Ireland and Queen Iseult the Elder. She is a main character in the &quot;Tristan&quot; poems of Béroul, Thomas of Britain, and Gottfried von Strassburg and in the opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; by Richard Wagner.

Iseult is first seen as a young princess who heals Tristan from wounds he received fighting her uncle, Morholt. When his identity is revealed, Tristan flees back to his own land. Later, Tristan returns to Ireland to gain Iseult&#x27;s hand in marriage for his uncle, King Mark of Cornwall. She is betrothed to an evil steward who claims to have killed a dragon and displays its head, but when Tristan proves he killed the dragon by showing that he already took its tongue, Iseult&#x27;s parents agree to let him take her to Mark. On the journey back to Cornwall, Iseult and Tristan accidentally drink a love potion prepared for her and Mark by Iseult and guarded by Brangaine, Iseult&#x27;s lady-in-waiting. The two fall hopelessly in love, and begin an affair that ends when Mark banishes Tristan from Cornwall.

In the verse tradition, the lovers do not meet again until Tristan is on his death bed (see below), but in the later Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; and works based upon it, Tristan returns from Brittany and they resume their affair. Mark is much less sympathetic in these versions, and the lovers eventually flee from his wrath. Lancelot gives them refuge in his estate Joyous Garde, and they engage in many further adventures.

In the prose versions, the lovers&#x27; end comes when Mark finds them as Tristan plays the harp for Iseult beneath a tree. The cruel king stabs his nephew in the back, and Tristan, at Iseult&#x27;s request, fatally crushes his beloved in a tight embrace as his final act. One of her rumored burial sites is Chapelizod in Dublin, Ireland.

==Iseult of Brittany==
After King Mark learns of the secret love affair between Tristan and Iseult, he banishes Tristan to Brittany, never to return to Cornwall. There, Tristan is placed in the care of Hoel of Brittany after receiving a wound. He meets and marries Hoel&#x27;s daughter, Iseult &quot;Blanchmains&quot; (Iseult &quot;of the White Hands&quot;), because she shares the name of his former lover. They never consummate the marriage because of Tristan&#x27;s love for Iseult of Ireland.

During one adventure in Brittany, Tristan suffers a poisoned wound that only Iseult of Ireland, the world&#x27;s most skilled physician, can cure. He sends a ship for her, asking that its crew fly white sails on the return if Iseult is aboard, and black if she is not. Iseult agrees to go, and the ship races home, white sails high. However, Tristan is too weak to look out his window to see the signal, so he asks his wife to check for him. In a moment of jealousy, Iseult of the White Hands tells him the sails are black, and Tristan expires immediately of despair. When the Irish Iseult arrives to find her lover dead, grief overcomes her, and she passes away at his side.

This death sequence does not appear in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;. In fact, while Iseult of the White Hands figures into some of the new episodes, she is never mentioned again after Tristan returns to Cornwall, although her brother Kahedin remains a prominent character. The plot element of the fatal misunderstanding of the white and black sails is similar to—and might have been derived from—the story of Aegeus and Theseus in Greek mythology.

==Modern portrayals==
*German composer Richard Wagner composed the opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; based upon &quot;Tristan&quot;, a tale of chivalrous romance from the Middle Ages by Gottfried von Strassburg.
* In Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;&quot;The Last Tournament&quot;&quot; Isolt is depicted much less favorably. &quot;She is petulant and demanding, disdainful of Mark, and prideful towards Tristram, loving and hating irrationally and unevenly.&quot;
* Matthew Arnold, in his 1852 poem &quot;Tristram and Iseult&quot;, focuses on Iseult of Brittany in the context of the Victorian cult of domesticity. 
*Iseult of Ireland (as Isolde) was played by Sophia Myles in the 2006 film adaptation, &quot;Tristan &amp; Isolde&quot;.
*Isolde is confused with Minerva in the 1960 film by Jean Cocteau, &quot;The Testament of Orpheus&quot;.
*Author, scholar and historian Rosalind Miles wrote a trilogy of fiction novels based upon the romance of Iseult, beginning with &quot;Isolde: Queen of the Western Isle&quot; (2002), followed by &quot;The Maid of the White Hands&quot; (2005), and concluding with &quot;The Lady of the Sea&quot; (2005). 
*Iseult was played by Irish actress Charlie Murphy in &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;, a British historical fiction television series based on Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;The Saxon Stories&quot; series of novels where Iseult hails from Kernow or Cornwalum (modern Cornwall).
* A character in the video game &quot;&quot; is named Isolde and shares parallels with Iseult.

<text>The Qajar dynasty (; 1789–1925) was an Iranian royal dynasty founded by Mohammad Khan () of the Qoyunlu clan of the Turkoman Qajar tribe. 

The dynasty&#x27;s effective rule in Iran ended in 1925 when Iran&#x27;s &quot;Majlis&quot;, convening as a constituent assembly on 12 December 1925, declared Reza Shah, a former brigadier-general of the Persian Cossack Brigade, as the new &quot;shah&quot; of Pahlavi Iran.

== List of Qajar monarchs ==
==Qajar imperial family==

The Qajar Imperial Family in exile is currently headed by the eldest descendant of Mohammad Ali Shah, Sultan Mohammad Ali Mirza Qajar, while the Heir Presumptive to the Qajar throne is Mohammad Hassan Mirza II, the grandson of Mohammad Hassan Mirza, Sultan Ahmad Shah&#x27;s brother and heir. Mohammad Hassan Mirza died in England in 1943, having proclaimed himself shah in exile in 1930 after the death of his brother in France.

Today, the descendants of the Qajars often identify themselves as such and hold reunions to stay socially acquainted through the &quot;Kadjar (Qajar) Family Association&quot;, often coinciding with the annual conferences and meetings of the
International Qajar Studies Association (IQSA). The Kadjar (Qajar) Family Association was founded for a third time in 2000. Two earlier family associations were stopped because of political pressure. The offices and archives of IQSA are housed at the International Museum for Family History in Eijsden.

===Titles and styles===
The shah and his consort were styled &quot;Imperial Majesty&quot;. Their children were addressed as &quot;Imperial Highness&quot;, while male-line grandchildren were entitled to the lower style of &quot;Highness&quot;; all of them bore the title of &quot;Shahzadeh&quot; or &quot;Shahzadeh Khanoum&quot;.

<doc id="609544" wikidata="Q335786" url="?curid=609544" title="Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning">
<text>Charles John Canning, 1st Earl Canning (14 December 1812 – 17 June 1862), also known as the Viscount Canning and Clemency Canning, was a British politician and Governor-General of India during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the first Viceroy of India after the transfer of power from the East India Company to the Crown of Queen Victoria in 1858 after the rebellion was crushed.

Canning is credited for ensuring that the administration and most departments of the government functioned normally during the rebellion and took major administrative decisions even during the peak of the Rebellion in 1857, including establishing the first three modern Universities in India, the University of Calcutta, University of Madras and University of Bombay based on Wood&#x27;s despatch. Canning passed the Hindu Widows&#x27; Remarriage Act, 1856 which was drafted by his predecessor Lord Dalhousie before the rebellion. He also passed the General Service Enlistment Act of 1856.

After the rebellion he presided over a smooth transfer and reorganisation of government from the East India company to the crown, the Indian Penal Code was drafted in 1860 based on the code drafted by Macaulay and came into force in 1862. Canning met the rebellion &#x27;&quot;with firmness, confidence, magnanimity and calm&quot; as per his biographer, Sir George Dunbar. Canning was very firm during the rebellion but after that he focused on reconciliation and reconstruction rather than retribution and issued a clemency proclamation.

==Background==

Born at Gloucester Lodge, Brompton, near London, Canning was the youngest child of George and Joan Canning. His mother was the daughter of Major-General John Scott. Meanwhile, his father was a Tory Member of Parliament who had been a member of the ministries of William Pitt the Younger and the Duke of Portland (most notably having been Foreign Secretary from 1807 to 1809), but as of Charles&#x27;s birth was out of government due to personal and policy differences with several leading figures. Over Charles&#x27;s youth, his father returned to government and held several senior posts, including a second stint as Foreign Secretary 1822-27 and Prime Minister for a few months before his untimely death from illness in 1827. His mother was granted a viscountcy in her own right, becoming the 1st Viscountess Canning, largely in tribute to her late husband.

Charles Canning was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1833, as first class in classics and second class in mathematics.

==Political career==

In 1836 he entered Parliament, being returned as member for the town of Warwick in the Conservative interest. He did not, however, sit long in the House of Commons; for, on the death of his mother in 1837, he succeeded to the peerage and entered the House of Lords. His first official appointment was that of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in the administration formed by Sir Robert Peel in 1841, his chief being the Earl of Aberdeen. This post he held till January 1846; and from January to July of that year, when the Peel administration was broken up, Lord Canning filled the post of First Commissioner of Woods and Forests.
He served on the Royal Commission on the British Museum (1847–49). He declined to accept office under the Earl of Derby; but on the formation of the coalition ministry under the Earl of Aberdeen in January 1853, he received the appointment of Postmaster General. In this office, he showed not only a large capacity for hard work but also general administrative ability and much zeal for the improvement of the service. He retained his post under Lord Palmerston&#x27;s ministry until July 1855, when, in consequence of the departure of Lord Dalhousie and a vacancy in the governor-generalship of India, he was selected by Lord Palmerston to succeed to that great position. This appointment appears to have been made rather on the ground of his father&#x27;s great services than from any proof as yet given of special personal fitness on the part of Lord Canning. The new governor sailed from England in December 1855 and entered upon the duties of his office in India at the close of February 1856.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica of 1911, &quot;In the year following his accession to office, the deep-seated discontent of the people broke out in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fears were entertained, and even the friends of the Governor-General to some extent shared them, that he was not equal to the crisis. But the fears proved groundless. He had a clear eye for the gravity of the situation, a calm judgment, and a prompt, swift hand to do what was really necessary. ... He carried the Indian empire safely through the stress of the storm, and, what was perhaps a harder task still, he dealt wisely with the enormous difficulties arising at the close of such a war. ... The name of Clemency Canning, which was applied to him during the heated animosities of the moment, has since become a title of honour.&quot; He was derisively called &quot;Clemency&quot; on account of a Resolution dated 31 July 1857, which distinguished between sepoys from regiments which had mutinied and killed their officers and European civilians, and those Indian soldiers who had disbanded and dispersed to their villages, without being involved in violence. While subsequently regarded as a humane and sensible measure, the Resolution made Canning unpopular at a time when British popular opinion favoured collective and indiscriminate reprisals.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; of 1911 continues, &quot;While rebellion was raging in Oudh he issued a proclamation declaring the lands of the province forfeited, and this step gave rise to much angry controversy. A secret despatch, couched in arrogant and offensive terms, was addressed to Canning by Lord Ellenborough, then a member of the Derby administration, which would have justified the Governor-General in immediately resigning. But from a strong sense of duty, he continued at his post, and ere long the general condemnation of the despatch was so strong that the writer felt it necessary to retire from office. Lord Canning replied to the despatch, calmly and in a statesman-like manner explaining and vindicating his censured policy&quot; and in 1858 he was rewarded by being made the first Viceroy of India.


The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; of 1911 adds, &quot;In April 1859 he received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament for his great services during the rebellion. He was also made an extra civil grand cross of the Order of the Bath, and in May of the same year he was raised to the dignity of an Earl, as Earl Canning. ...By the strain of anxiety and hard work his health and strength were seriously impaired, while the death of his wife was also a great shock to him; in the hope that rest in his native land might restore him, he left India, reaching England in April 1862. But it was too late. He died in London on 17 June. About a month before his death he was created a Knight of the Garter. As he died without issue the titles became extinct.&quot;

Prior to the rebellion, Canning and his wife, Charlotte, had desired to produce a photographic survey of Indian people, primarily for their own edification. This project was transformed into an official government study as a consequence of the rebellion, after which it was seen as useful documentation in the effort to learn more about native communities and thereby better understand them. It was eventually published as an eight-volume work, &quot;The People of India&quot;, between 1868 and 1875.

<doc id="609548" wikidata="Q15708039" url="?curid=609548" title="Pompadour green pigeon">
<text>The pompadour green pigeon (genus Treron) is a pigeon species complex. It is widespread in forests of southern and southeast Asia. Many authorities have split the pompadour green pigeon into multiple species, which are listed below:

==Distribution and habitat==
It is a widespread group in forests of tropical southern Asia from India, Sri Lanka east to the Philippines and the Moluccas. In India, they are found as disjunct populations in the Western Ghats, some parts of the Eastern Ghats, Northeastern India and in the Andaman Islands.

==Taxonomy==
The distribution of the pompadour green pigeon is peculiarly disjunct and several are distinctive, leading many authorities to split it into six species:

* Sri Lanka green pigeon (&quot;Treron pompadora&quot;) from Sri Lanka. Monotypic.
* Grey-fronted green pigeon (&quot;Treron affinis&quot;) from the Western Ghats in India. Monotypic.
* Andaman green pigeon (&quot;Treron chloropterus&quot;) from the Andamans and Nicobars. Monotypic.
* Ashy-headed green pigeon (&quot;Treron phayrei&quot;) from northeast India and Nepal, east to Yunnan in China, and south through Indochina (north of the Isthmus of Kra). Commonly considered monotypic, though some recognize the subspecies &quot;conoveri&quot;.
* Philippine green pigeon (&quot;Treron axillaris&quot;) from the Philippines. Includes the subspecies &quot;amadoni&quot;, &quot;canescens&quot; and &quot;everetti&quot;.
* Buru green pigeon (&quot;Treron aromaticus&quot;) from small islands in the Flores Sea and Buru, Indonesia. Monotypic.

==Description==
The pompadour green pigeon complex are all stocky, medium-sized pigeons, in length, with some significantly larger than others (e.g., &quot;chloropterus&quot; is significantly larger than birds from the Asian mainland). The head is green to greenish-yellow, and the underparts are green, though males of the subspecies &quot;phayrei&quot; have a pale orange patch on the chest. The crown, including the forehead are usually grey, except in Sri Lanka green pigeons where the forehead is greenish-yellow. The undertail coverts are mainly whitish or pale yellowish, though they are deep cinnamon in males of &quot;affinis&quot; and &quot;phayrei&quot;. The wings are blackish with distinct yellow edging to the wing coverts and tertials. The mantle is dark green in the female and deep purplish-chestnut in the male. In most birds, this includes the &quot;shoulder&quot;, but in males of &quot;aromaticus&quot; the &quot;shoulder&quot; is very dark grey and in males of &quot;chloropterus&quot; it is green. Furthermore, males of &quot;aromaticus&quot; and some members of the &quot;axillaris&quot; group have a grey band above the mantle.

The legs are reddish in most birds, but grey in the &quot;axillaris&quot; group. The eyes are maroon-red or deep to very light blue (depends on subspecies), and the bill is whitish-grey with a dull, pale greenish or bluish base, except in the &quot;axillaris&quot; group where the base is red.
==Behaviour==
All species of the pompadour green pigeon complex usually occur singly or in small groups. Flight is fast and direct, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings that are characteristic of pigeons in general. They eat the seeds and fruits of a wide variety of plants. They build a stick nest in a tree and lay two white eggs.

<doc id="609555" wikidata="Q336449" url="?curid=609555" title="John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence">
<text>John Laird Mair Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence, (4 March 1811 – 27 June 1879), known as Sir John Lawrence, Bt., between 1858 and 1869, was a prominent British Imperial statesman and served as the Viceroy of India from 1864 to 1869.

==Early life==
Lawrence was born in Richmond, North Riding of Yorkshire. He was the youngest son born into an Ulster-Scots family, his mother, Letitia Knox, being from County Donegal while his father was from Coleraine in County Londonderry. Lawrence spent his early years in Derry, a city in the Province of Ulster in the northern part of Ireland, and was educated at Foyle College and Wraxhall School in Bath. His father had served in India as a soldier in the British Army and his elder brothers included Sir George Lawrence and Sir Henry Lawrence.

At the age of sixteen, despite wishing for a military career like his brothers, his father enrolled him at the East India Company College, Haileybury, believing a career as a civil servant offered better prospects. He attended Haileybury for two years, where by his own admission he was neither very idle nor very industrious, yet he won prizes in history, political economy and Bengali.

==Passage to India==
Lawrence entered the Bengal Civil Service and in September 1829 he set sail for India with his brother Henry. On arrival he settled at Fort William where he was expected to pass examinations in local vernacular. Having successfully mastered Persian and Urdu, Lawrence&#x27;s first job was as a magistrate and tax collector in Delhi. After four years in Delhi he was transferred to Panipat and two years hence was placed in charge of Gurgaon district.

In 1837, Lawrence was made a settlement officer at Etawah. Whilst doing the role he caught jungle fever and was close to death. He spent three months in Calcutta to convalesce but having failed to recover he returned to England in 1840. The following year, whilst in County Donegal he met and married his wife Harriette in August 1841. The couple then spent six months travelling Europe until news from the First Anglo-Afghan War led to them returning to England, and back to India in the autumn of 1842.

On his return to India, Lawrence was appointed a Civil and Sessions Judge in Delhi, and given responsibility over Karnal. During the First Anglo-Sikh War between 1845 and 1846, Sir Henry Hardinge sent orders for Lawrence to assist the armed forces. He played a key role ahead of the Battle of Sobraon, ensuring supplies and guns were collected and transferred to the battle.

==Punjab==
===Jullundur and the Hill States===
At the conclusion of the First Anglo-Sikh War, Hardinge appointed Lawrence to govern the newly-annexed Jullundur district and Hill States regions of the Punjab. In that role, Lawrence was known for his administrative reforms, his subduing the hill tribes and his attempts to end the custom of suttee. He attempted to tackle the issue of female infanticide by successfully threatening the Bedis with confiscation of their lands unless they gave up the practice. His assistant Robert Cust described Lawrence&#x27;s interviews with native land-holders as follows:

Another assistant, Lewin Bowring, described how he had a rough tongue with the local chiefs, who had a wholesome dread of him. He was described as far abler than his brother at details but was not held in as much affection by the chiefs.

===Board of Administration===
Victory in the Second Anglo-Sikh War established East India Company dominance in the Punjab, and on 30 March 1849, the Punjab was proclaimed a province of British India. Lawrence was appointed to a three-man Board of Administration to govern the province, headed by his elder brother Henry. He was responsible for numerous reforms, including the abolition of internal duties and the establishment of a common currency and postal system. Lawrence championed improvements to local infrastructure and raising money for public works, including an extension of the Grand Trunk Road from Delhi to Peshawar, the construction of a highway from Lahore to Multan, and construction on the Bari Doab Canal which provided a boon to cultivators in the area. He was also known for being financially astute, overseeing a fifty percent increase in revenue and ensuring the Punjab was delivering a surplus of over one million pounds sterling within three years of the Board being instituted.

Lawrence disagreed with his brother Henry&#x27;s policy of retaining the support of the local aristocracy, arguing it was too extravagant and hurting finances. In December 1852, having overseen a highly productive period of governance, the Lawrence brothers offered their resignations. Lord Dalhousie also feeling the necessity of a Board of Administration had ceased, sought to replace it with the new role of Chief Commissioner. Dalhousie rejected Lawrence&#x27;s resignation, instead making him the first Chief Commissioner, meanwhile Henry went on to become Agent in Rajputana.

===Chief Commissioner===
As Chief Commissioner, Lawrence carried on the policies from before - public works were extended, industry and education encouraged and surveying completed. He granted greater authority to villages, and upheld the decisions of village headsmen. In addition, Lawrence now also had responsibility for managing the mercurial group of assistants recruited by his brother known as Henry Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Young Men&quot;.

In February 1856, Lawrence returned to Calcutta to wish farewell to the departing Lord Dalhousie who was retiring to England. As a parting gift, Dalhouse recommended Lawrence for the honour of Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. Whilst in Calcutta, Lawrence spent three days with Henry, in what would be the last time the brothers were together.

==Indian Mutiny==
Lawrence was in Rawalpindi when he received news of a sepoy uprising in Meerut.

The Punjab garrison in May 1857 was 60,000 strong, consisting of 10,000 Europeans, 36,000 Hindustani sepoys and 14,000 Punjabi irregulars. His first step was to disarm potentially disaffected sepoys by splitting them into detachments and dispatching them to the Afghan frontier where they were less likely to rebel. His next steps were to send the Corps of Guides, 1st Punjabi&#x27;s (Coke&#x27;s Afridis), 4th Sikhs and 4th Punjab Infantry seven hundred miles to Delhi. To patrol the now militarily depleted Punjab, Lawrence then at the suggestion of John Nicholson and Herbert Edwardes deployed a movable column of lightly equipped European and Punjabi troops, and chose Neville Chamberlain to lead it.

To guarantee the loyalty of the Punjab, he requested Sikh chiefs show gratitude for leniency following annexation, and Patiala, Jhind, Nabha and Kapurthala all offered troops and money in support of the British. This ensured the lines of communication between Delhi and Lahore remained open. He wrote to influential Sikhs who had previously rebelled during the Second Sikh War, and successfully secured their support by offering them a chance of redemption if they lent support against the mutiny. Lawrence was also able to gain the support of Muslims in the Punjab such as the Nawab of Karnal.

As the fighting continued, Lawrence felt inclined to send the large contingent of European soldiers stationed at Peshawar to Delhi. This raised the prospect of an attack by Dost Mohammed Khan when the Peshawar garrison was left less secure. Lawrence&#x27;s assistants, led by John Nicholson and even the Governor-General, Lord Canning, were insistent on the need to protect Peshawar. Lawrence nonetheless placed greater importance on the fall of Delhi, and pressed ahead with the re-deployment of troops to Delhi. By 6 September, Lawrence wrote to Lord Canning that the Punjab had sent every man they could spare. On 14 September, Delhi had been recaptured and due to his actions Lawrence was acclaimed as the &#x27;Saviour of India&#x27;.

==Aftermath of Rebellion==
In the immediate aftermath of the rebellion, the British perpetrated acts of vengeance, including summary executions. In February 1858 Delhi became part of the Punjab, and Lawrence took steps to check the acts of vengeance. That same month he wrote to Lord Canning urging him to permit sepoys who had not taken part in the mutiny to return home, and to grant an amnesty for those who did not murder anyone and had given up their arms.

Calls were made to raze Delhi to the ground, and dismantle the Jama Masjid, however Lawrence resisted such calls stating holy places should be spared. Popular opinion within British society was shaped by partisan reports of atrocities committed by the rebels and demanded the most severe retribution on the alleged culprits, an opinion which was resisted by Lord Canning and Lawrence. As many as 800,000 Indians and possibly more, both in the rebellion (150,000 dead) and in famines and epidemics of disease (650,000 dead) in its wake, by comparison of 1857 population estimates with the Indian Census of 1871. About 6,000 British occupiers or family members were killed.

In 1858, the Punjab was made a Lieutenant Governorship which resulted in an increase in staff and other privileges. In February 1859, Lawrence handed over power to Robert Montgomery and set sail for England. For his service in the mutiny he was created a baronet, granted a GCB, made a Privy Councillor and received an annual pension from the East India Company of £2,000. On arrival in England he was greeted with a lavish ceremony at Guildhall and afforded an audience with Queen Victoria. He also took up a role with the Council of India based at Whitehall.

Additionally he received the freedoms of the cities of London (1858) and Glasgow (1860), the freedom of the Worshipful Company of Grocers (1859) and honorary doctorates of civil law from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge (1859).

==Viceroy of India==

On 12 January 1864, Lawrence returned to India, succeeding Lord Elgin as Viceroy of India. His stated ambitions as Viceroy were to consolidate British power and to improve the ‘condition of the people’. One of his first acts was to ban the Hindu practice of throwing their dead into the Hooghly River. To enable Lawrence to claim both his annuity from the East India Company and his full salary as Viceroy, the Salary of Sir J. Lawrence Act 1864 was passed in March 1864.

===Domestic policy===
Domestically, Lawrence sought to increase tenant security and to reduce fiscal assessments imposed on Indians, believing that what had worked in the Punjab would work across British India. He saw light taxation as a matter of fairness and pragmatism, arguing that for Indian yeomen to safeguard British rule it was essential that they should feel the benefits of a British administration. Lawrence resisted calls for increasing the taxation of salt that would have disproportionately affected poorer Indians. He calculated that the excise on salt increased its price as much as twelvefold in the Punjab, and perhaps by eight times in the North West Provinces. Lawrence abhorred the stance taken by many of his compatriots, who considered it their &#x27;prerogative while in India to pay no taxation at all.&#x27; He characterised the non-official British community in India as &#x27;birds of passage&#x27;, rushing to amass wealth as quickly as possible with no care for what happened after their departure.

Arguably the greatest failure of Lawrence&#x27;s tenure was the Orissa famine of 1866, in which an estimated one million Indians died. Part of the criticism focused on his moving the government apparatus to the cooler hills of Simla which was geographically remote from the centre of power in Calcutta. In response, Lawrence offered his resignation, but this was refused by Viscount Cranborne.

===Foreign policy===
Lawrence&#x27;s fame and extensive regional knowledge afforded him considerable scope by Westminster in determining Indian foreign policy.

In June 1863, the Emir of Afghanistan, Dost Muhammad Khan, died, resulting in civil war within Afghanistan at a time when the British government were concerned with Russian expansionism in central Asia. Lawrence adopted a strategy of strict non-intervention on Afghanistan, devising a policy that would be known as &#x27;masterly inactivity.&#x27; The policy meant no British envoys or troops were sent to Afghanistan, and civilian explorers were prohibited from wandering beyond the frontier. It has been argued the policy was shaped by Lawrence&#x27;s experience of the First Anglo-Afghan War where his brother George was held captive.

Lawrence argued any attempt to restrain Russian advance in Afghanistan would lead to the eventual occupation of the country, as was the case in 1838. Vocal criticism of Lawrence&#x27;s policy of ‘masterly inactivity’ came from serving or former British army officers in India such as Henry Rawlinson and Sir Sydney Cotton. Criticism centred on the belief that Britain&#x27;s apparent passivity would allow Russia to establish her influence at Kabul.

==Return to England==
Lawrence completed his five-year term as Viceroy and returned to England in January 1869. In April he was raised to the peerage as Baron Lawrence, of the Punjaub and of Grateley in the County of Southampton.

Arthur Munby, as quoted in &quot;Munby, Man of Two Worlds&quot;, wrote: &#x27;Thursday, 31st. May, 18??:... Passing through Kensington Tuesday, (29th.May) I saw a man of all others worth seeing-Sir John Lawrence. He was riding down the street alone—without even a groom:and no one knew or noticed him. A large, loosely made man: sitting grave and quiet on his horse; with sallow wrinkled face and grizzled moustache: riding along, an unappreciated king of men, with such keen eyes and such a solemn face! And he all unnoticed, and still a commoner, while Vernon Smith is a peer! But idiots are proverbially the favourites of fortune.&#x27;

In 1870 he was elected to represent the Chelsea division of the London School Board, and was appointed chairman at the first board meeting. He resigned from the position in November 1873.

Lawrence briefly returned to the public sphere in 1878 as a critic of the Conservative government&#x27;s Afghan policy in the months preceding the Second Afghan War. He was nominated chairman of an influential committee to oppose the policy of Lord Lytton and the Indian government, and to oppose annexation and imperialism.

Lawrence died in London on 27 June 1879, aged 68 and was buried at Westminster Abbey. A memorial bust of Lawrence by the sculptor Thomas Woolner was later erected in the nave of the Abbey.

==Family==

Lawrence married Harriette Catherine, daughter of The Reverend Richard Hamilton, in 1841. They had four sons and six daughters:

* Catherine Letitia Lawrence (1843–1931), married Col. William Lowndes Randall
* Harriette Emily Lawrence (1844–1918), married Sir Henry Stewart Cunningham
* John Hamilton Lawrence (1845–1913), succeeded his father as the 2nd Baron Lawrence
* Henry Lawrence (1848–1902), a noted rugby player who captained England in two matches, including the first ever international against Ireland.
* Alice Margaret Lawrence (1850–1944), married Rev. Launcelot Charles Walford (1843–1936) on 14 July 1870. They had three daughters.
* Mary Emma Lawrence (1852–1939), married Francis William Buxton, son of Sir Edward North Buxton, 2nd Baronet on 27 February 1872. They had three sons, and five daughters.
* Charles Napier Lawrence (1854–1927), businessman and was created Baron Lawrence of Kingsgate in 1923.
* Edith Hamilton Lawrence (7 June 1860 – 24 February 1861), died in infancy
* Sir Herbert Alexander Lawrence (1861–1943), a First World War general and a banker.
* Dame Maude Agnes Lawrence (1865–1933), civil servant

Lady Lawrence died in 1917.

==Legacy==
A boarding house at the East India Company College (today Haileybury and Imperial Service College) and a &quot;house&quot; at Foyle College was subsequently named after him. Lawrence is also a Senior Wing House at St Paul&#x27;s School, Darjeeling, in India, where all the Senior Wing Houses are named after colonial-era civil service and military figures.

A statue of him stands at Foyle and Londonderry College (having been, originally, erected in Lahore). The statue, by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm, once showed Lawrence with a pen in one hand and a sword in the other, along with the caption &quot;By which will you be governed?&quot;. The pen and sword were used to illustrate his versatility as an administrator and a soldier. Vandals have since damaged the sword. Another statue of Lawrence stands in Waterloo Place in central London. The inscription on the base of the statue originally reads &quot;John First Lord Lawrence, ruler of the Punjaub during the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. Viceroy of India from 1864 to 1869. Erected by his fellow subjects, British and Indian, A.D. 1882.,&quot; but the word &quot;Punjaub&quot; (Punjab) has been defaced and rendered illegible by vandals.

<text>Leon Redbone (born Dickran Gobalian; August 26, 1949 – May 30, 2019) was a singer-songwriter and musician specializing in jazz, blues, and Tin Pan Alley classics. Recognized by his hat (often a Panama), dark sunglasses, and black tie, he was born in Cyprus of Armenian ancestry and first appeared on stage in Toronto, Canada, in the early 1970s. He also appeared on film and television in acting and voice-over roles.

In concert, Redbone often employed comedy and demonstrated his guitar-playing skill. His recurrent gags involved the influence of alcohol and claims he had written works originating well before he was born. He favored music of the Tin Pan Alley era, circa 1890–1910. He sang the theme to the 1980s television series &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;, and released 18 albums.

==Early life==
Redbone was elusive about his origins, and never explained the origin of his stage name. According to a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; report in the 1980s, he came to Canada in the mid-1960s, and changed his name via the Ontario Change of Name Act. Biographical research published in 2019 corroborated his birth name, and confirmed that his family was of Armenian origin. His parents lived in Jerusalem, but fled in 1948 for Nicosia, Cyprus, where Redbone was born. By 1961, the family had moved to London, England, and by 1965 to Toronto.

==Career==
While living in Canada in the late 1960s, Redbone began performing in public at Toronto area nightclubs and folk music festivals. He met Bob Dylan at the Mariposa Folk Festival in 1972. Dylan was so impressed by Redbone&#x27;s performance that he mentioned it in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, leading that magazine to do a feature article on Redbone a year before he had a recording contract. The article described his performances as &quot;so authentic you can hear the surface noise [of an old 78 rpm].&quot; Dylan said that if he had ever started a label, he would have signed Redbone. Redbone&#x27;s first album, &quot;On the Track&quot;, was released by Warner Bros. Records in 1975.

He was introduced to a larger public as a semi-regular musical guest on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, appearing twice in the first season. During the 1980s and &#x27;90s he was a frequent guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. He was also a guest on &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;.

A self-taught musician, he played by ear, sometimes changing the chords of established tunes, never rehearsing with a band, and not following set lists. In an interview in the Winter 2017 edition (No. 177) of &quot;BING&quot; magazine, the publication of the International Club Crosby, clarinetist Dan Levinson recounted working with Redbone:

I toured with Redbone for 12 years. We used to listen to early Crosby while we were on the road. [Redbone&#x27;s] taste in music was more eclectic than that of anyone I&#x27;ve ever known – it included Emmett Miller, Blind Blake, Paganini, Caruso, Gene Austin, John McCormack, Moran and Mack, Cliff Edwards, Jelly Roll Morton, Ted Lewis, Mustafa the Castrato, the Hungarian singer Imre Laszlo, Jimmie Rodgers (&#x27;the Singing Brakeman&#x27;), Mongolian throat singers, W. C. Fields, Laurel and Hardy ... and early Bing Crosby.

Redbone was described as &quot;both a musical artist and a performance artist whose very identity was part of his creative output.&quot; He usually dressed in attire reminiscent of the Vaudeville era, performing in a Panama hat with a black band and dark sunglasses, often while sitting at attention on a stool, with a white coat and trousers and a black string tie. With his reluctance to discuss his past came speculation that &quot;Leon Redbone&quot; was an alternative identity for another performer. Two common suggestions in years past were Andy Kaufman and Frank Zappa, both of whom Redbone outlived. Though sometimes compared to Zappa and Tom Waits for &quot;the strength and strangeness of his persona&quot;, he almost exclusively played music from decades before the rock era, occasionally writing his own new material in a similar blues-influenced Tin Pan Alley style. (As well, Redbone&#x27;s only Billboard chart hit, &quot;Seduced&quot;, was a newly written tune by Gary Tigerman arranged in Redbone&#x27;s decades-old style.) Redbone disdained &quot;blatant sound for people to dance to&quot;, and in a 1991 interview, he said: &quot;The only thing that interests me is history, reviewing the past and making something out of it.&quot;

Redbone survived a small plane crash in Clarksburg, West Virginia, on February 12, 1979. He thereafter traveled to engagements exclusively by car, saying, &quot;I carry around many unusual items and devices. They make life difficult for airport security personnel and flying impossible for me.&quot;

On May 19, 2015 on his website, his publicist referred to concerns about his health and announced his retirement from performing and recording.

==Death==
Redbone died on May 30, 2019, from the effects of dementia. At the time he was living in New Hope, Pennsylvania, in hospice care. He was survived by his wife Beryl Handler, daughters Blake and Ashley, and three grandchildren.

A statement on Redbone&#x27;s website noted his death with cheeky humor: &quot;It is with heavy hearts we announce that early this morning, May 30, 2019, Leon Redbone crossed the delta for that beautiful shore at the age of 127. He departed our world with his guitar, his trusty companion Rover, and a simple tip of his hat.&quot; His longtime publicist Jim Della Croce confirmed that Redbone was actually 69.

==Appearances in other media==
One of Redbone&#x27;s songs, &quot;Seduced&quot;, was featured prominently in the 1978 film &quot;The Big Fix&quot;. He sang &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; with Zooey Deschanel over the closing credits of the 2003 film &quot;Elf&quot; and provided the voice of Leon the Snowman in the film. He performed the theme songs for the TV shows &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot; and &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;.

Redbone appeared regularly on the PBS children&#x27;s show &quot;Between the Lions&quot;. On &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, he sang several songs over film footage, including &quot;Blueberry Mouth&quot;, &quot;Have You Ever&quot;, and &quot;What Do They Do When They Go Wherever They Go?&quot; He also appeared as Leon in the 1988 film &quot;Candy Mountain&quot;, and on an episode of the TV show &quot;Life Goes On&quot;. He narrated the 2011 Emmy Award-winning documentary &quot;Remembering the Sirens&quot;, celebrating the exceptional, yet little-known musical legacy of the Scranton Sirens, one of the most significant &quot;territory&quot; dance bands in American musical history.

He performed in TV commercials for various companies, including Budweiser beer (where he lay on a surfboard singing &quot;This Bud&#x27;s for You&quot;), the U.S. automobile brand Geo, All laundry detergent, and InterCity British Rail service (where he sang the song &quot;Relax&quot;). He also lent his voice to an animated caricature of himself in a commercial for Ken-L Ration dog food.

Redbone was the subject of the 2018 short documentary film &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Talk About Me When I&#x27;m Gone&quot; by Mako Funasaka, Liam Romalis and Jason Charters, produced by Riddle Films.

<doc id="609570" wikidata="Q258637" url="?curid=609570" title="Userkare">
<text>Userkare (also Woserkare, meaning &quot;Powerful is the soul of Ra&quot;; died 2332 BC) was the second king of the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt, reigning briefly, 1 to 5 years, in the late 24th or the early 23rd century BC. Userkare&#x27;s relation to his predecessor Teti and successor Pepi I is unknown and his reign remains enigmatic. 

Although he is attested in some historical sources, Userkare is completely absent from the tomb of the Egyptian officials who lived during his reign and usually report the names of the kings whom they served. Furthermore, the figures of some high officials of the period have been deliberately chiselled out in their tombs and their titles altered, for instance the word &quot;king&quot; being replaced by that of &quot;desert&quot;. Egyptologists thus suspect a possible &quot;Damnatio memoriae&quot; on Pepi I&#x27;s behalf against Userkare. In addition, the Egyptian priest Manetho who wrote an history of Egypt in the 3rd century BC states that Userkare&#x27;s predecessor Teti was murdered but is otherwise silent concerning Userkare. Consequently, Userkare is often considered to have been a short-lived usurper to the throne, possibly a descendant of a cadet branch of the preceding Fifth Dynasty. Alternatively, he may have been a legitimate short-lived ruler or a regent who ruled during Teti&#x27;s son Pepi I&#x27;s childhood before his accession to the throne.

The tomb of Userkare has not yet been identified, either because it was never finished or because Pepi I erased traces of his predecessor&#x27;s rule. If the tomb was indeed started, Egyptologists conjecture that it should be located in South Saqqara.

== Attestations ==

===Historical sources===
Userkare is present on the Abydos King List, a list of kings written during the reign of Seti I (1290–1279 BC), over 1,000 years after the early Sixth Dynasty. Userkare&#x27;s cartouche occupies the 35th entry of the list, between those of Teti and Pepi I, making him the second pharaoh of the dynasty. Userkare was possibly also listed on the Turin canon, a king list composed during the reign of Ramesses II (1279–1213 BC). Unfortunately, a large lacuna affects the second line of the fourth column of the papyrus on which the list was written, the place were Userkare&#x27;s name might have been located.

===Contemporaneous sources===
====Secure attestations====
Few artefacts dating to Userkare&#x27;s lifetime have survived to this day, the only secure attestions contemporaneous with his reign being two cylinder seals inscribed with his name and titles, and a copper mallet from the Michaelides collection. The mallet bears a small inscription giving the name of a crew of workmen &quot;Beloved ones of Userkare&quot; who hailed from Wadjet, the 10th nome of Upper Egypt, located around Tjebu, south of Asyut.

====Possible attestations====
The French Egyptologists Michel Baud and Vassil Dobrev have also proposed that a copper axe head discovered in Syria could belong to Userkare. The axe bears the name of another crew of workmen called the &quot;Beloved ones of the Two Golden Falcons&quot;, where &quot;Two Golden Falcons&quot; is the golden Horus name of a pharaoh. Although both Khufu and Sahure bore this name and either one of them may be the owner of the axe, Baud and Dobrev note that Teti&#x27;s and Pepi&#x27;s golden horus names are &quot;Golden Falcon who Unites&quot; and &quot;Three Golden Falcons&quot;, respectively. Given the role of the golden Horus name as a symbol of the tramission of royal powers in the Old Kingdom period, Dobrev proposes that the missing link between Teti&#x27;s and Pepi&#x27;s names is the name &quot;Two Golden Falcons&quot; and that it would logically correspond to Userkare&#x27;s brief intervening reign. Consequently the axe would be an attestation of his rule.

The English Egyptologist Flinders Petrie has tentatively identified Userkare with a king named Ity attested by a single rock inscription found in the Wadi Hammamat. The inscription, dated to the first year of reign of Ity, mentions a band of 200 sailors and 200 masons under the direction of the overseers Ihyemsaf and Irenakhet sent to the Wadi Hammamat to collect stones for the construction of Ity&#x27;s pyramid called &quot;Bau Ity&quot;, meaning &quot;Glory of Ity&quot;. Petrie&#x27;s identification of Userkare with Ity relies solely on his estimation of the inscription to the Sixth Dynasty and the fact that Userkare is the only king of this period whose full titulary is not known. This identification is nowadays deemed conjectural and several First Intermediate Period dates have been proposed for Ity.

===South Saqqara Stone===
In addition to historical and contemporaneous sources, details about Userkare&#x27;s reign were once given on the nearly contemporaneous South Saqqara Stone, a royal annal of the Sixth Dynasty dating to the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I or Pepi II. Unfortunately, an estimated 92% of the original text was lost when the stone was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid, possibly in the late First Intermediate ( 2160–2055 BC) to early Middle Kingdom period (c. 2055–1650 BC). The presence of Userkare on the annal can nonetheless be inferred from a large space between the sections concerning the reigns of Teti and Pepi I as well as from traces of a royal titulary in this space. Although the text reporting Userkare&#x27;s activities is lost, its length suggests that Userkare ruled Egypt from two to four years, with the former seen as less likely than the latter.

==Reign==

For Michel Baud, the absence of monuments as well as the scarcity of artefacts and documents pertaining to Userkare all point to the short duration of Userkare&#x27;s reign. For the same reasons, his relations to his predecessor and successor are largely uncertain and Egyptologists have proposed a number of hypotheses regarding his identity and rule. These fall broadly into two contradictory scenarios: one that sees Userkare as a legitimate ruler or regent, while the other perceives Userkare as an usurper, possibly responsible for the murder of his predecessor Teti.

===As a legitimate ruler===
The Egyptologists William Stevenson Smith, William C. Hayes and Nicolas Grimal believe that Userkare briefly ruled Egypt either as a legitimate stopgap ruler or as a regent with queen Iput I. Indeed, Teti&#x27;s son Pepi I reigned for circa 50 years, indicating that he was likely very young at the death of his father, likely too young to immediately assume the throne. The theory that Userkare was merely a regent is rejected by Naguib Kanawati, on the basis that Userkare might have been mentioned on the Turin canon, is present in the Abydos king list and holds full royal titulary, something reserved exclusively to reigning pharaohs.

In support of the hypothesis that Userkare was a legitimate stopgap ruler, Grimal stresses that he is well attested by historical and contemporaneous sources, in particular the South Saqqara Stone. This seems in contradiction with the idea that, being illegitimate, he was victim of a &quot;Damnatio memoriae&quot; by his successor Pepi. In addition, there is no direct evidence of difficulties associated with Pepi I&#x27;s rise on throne in the archeological record, which one could expect had Userkare been a usurper. Rainer Stadelmann and Michel Baud underline that there is no clear evidence for a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; targeting Userkare. For example his funerary complex may have been planned yet never erected, which they find would provide a better explanation for its absence than a &quot;speculative&quot; attempt on Pepi I&#x27;s behalf to erase traces of his predecessor&#x27;s rule.

Vivianne Gae Callender—who agrees that Userkare was the target of some kind of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;—has put forth another theory in which Userkare was a legitimate son of Teti born while his father was king, but not his first-born son. In this hypothesis, Userkare&#x27;s claim to the throne would rely on his being born after Teti had assumed power, while Pepi I would be the eldest son of Teti yet born before Teti&#x27;s elevation to power. In particular Teti&#x27;s eight to 12 years of reign would imply that Userkare would have been around 10 at the time of his coronation and facing a resenting older brother, possibly explaining the paucity of attestations of his rule. Proceeding by elimination Callender has conjectured that a queen &quot;Khentet[...]&quot; mentioned in a south Saqqara relief could be Userkare&#x27;s mother.

=== As a usurper to the throne===

The Egyptian priest Manetho who wrote a history of Egypt, the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, in the 3rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II (283–246 BC), mentions that Othoês—the hellenized name of Teti—was murdered by his bodyguards or attendants. Based on this statement, Egyptologists have found it plausible that Userkare participated in or at least benefited from Teti&#x27;s assassination, despite Userkare&#x27;s absence from the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;. Userkare&#x27;s name is theophoric and incorporates the name of the sun god Ra, a naming fashion common during the preceding Fifth Dynasty. Since Teti was not a son of the last Fifth Dynasty king Unas, some Egyptologists have proposed that Userkare could have been a descendant of a lateral branch of the Fifth Dynasty royal family who briefly seized power in a coup.

The Egyptologist Naguib Kanawati also finds the hypothesis that Userkare was a short-lived legitimate ruler or regent &quot;unconvincing&quot;. Indeed, archeological evidence lends credence to the idea that Userkare was illegitimate in the eyes of his successor Pepi I. In particular, there is no mention of Userkare in the tombs and biographies of the many Egyptian officials who served under both Teti and Pepi I. The viziers Inumin and Khentika, who served both Teti and Pepi I, are completely silent about Userkare and none of their activities during Userkare&#x27;s time on the throne are reported in their tomb. Furthermore, the tomb of Mehi, a guard who lived under Teti, Userkare and Pepi, yielded an inscription showing that the name of Teti was first erased to be replaced by that of another king, whose name was itself erased and replaced again by that of Teti. Kanawati argues that the intervening name was that of Userkare to whom Mehi may have transferred his allegiance. Mehi&#x27;s attempt to switch back to Teti was seemingly unsuccessful, as there is evidence that work on his tomb stopped abruptly and that he was never buried there. 

A similar situation is encountered in the mastaba of Merefnebef, a &quot;lowly&quot; official and courtier who started his career under Teti then was elevated to the highest position, becoming vizier, in all probability under Userkare. The tomb exhibits distinct building phases, the latest one corresponding to Merefnebef&#x27;s vizierate during which Merefnebef had his title inscribed repeatedly at the exterior of his tomb. Work on the tomb was then abruptly stopped, either with Merefnebef&#x27;s death or with his political downfall following the death of Userkare. Later on, one of Merefnebef&#x27;s son intervened in the mastaba chiseling out the figures of his brothers, altering his father&#x27;s titles in particular those of &quot;Honoured by the king&quot; by erasing the word &quot;king&quot; or even replacing it with the word &quot;desert&quot;. Finally the mastaba, left unfinished, was deliberately walled off so as to be hidden from sight. For Karol Myśliwiec who excavated the tomb, this shows that &quot;the infamy of the most shameful moment in [Merefnebef&#x27;s] career, that of being (probably) promoted to the function of vizier by the usurper Userkare, was visibly remembered for generations&quot;. This opinion is shared by the Egyptologist Peter J. Brand who sees here an instance of a wider pattern of promotion of low-ranking officials to the highest offices under Userkare, followed by their demotions or expulsions under Pepi I.

Michel Baud also sees difficulties with the idea that Userkare was fully legitimate: he points in particular to the &quot;disturbing&quot; silence of contemporaneous private biographies, with no official of the time period mentioning serving under Userkare. Furthermore, Michel Baud and Vassil Dobrev do not see Userkare&#x27;s presence on the South Saqqara Stone royal annals as evidence that he was legitimate in the eyes of his successors: it could be that royal annals were not affected by &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; measures, even those targeting usurpers, because their purpose was precisely to systematically record all royal activities, regardless of their political context.

==Tomb==

The location of the tomb of Userkare has not yet been identified. The brevity of his reign implies that the tomb was probably unfinished at his death, making modern identification difficult. Since Userkare was a Sixth Dynasty king, his tomb was presumably planned to be a pyramid. A possible vindication of this hypothesis is the copper mallet mentioning a team of paid workers from the nome of Wadjet. These workers were likely involved in an important building project, likely to be Userkare&#x27;s pyramid.

Two hypotheses for the location of Userkare&#x27;s pyramid have been put forth. The Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev proposed that Userkare&#x27;s pyramid is located in the area of Saqqara South known today as Tabbet al-Guesh, north-west of the mortuary complex of Pepi I. Indeed, a large necropolis of Sixth Dynasty administration officials is found there, which according to Dobrev, hints at the nearby presence of a royal pyramid. The astrophysicist Giulio Magli believes instead that the pyramid of Userkare is to be found midway between those of Pepi I and Merenre Nemtyemsaf I, at a place that would make the three pyramids form a line parallel to the one formed by the pyramids of Sekhemkhet, Unas, Djoser, Userkaf and Teti to the North.

<text>Evergrey is a Swedish progressive metal band from Gothenburg.

==History==
Evergrey was formed in 1993 in Gothenburg by guitarist/vocalist Tom S. Englund as a progressive power metal band, in contrast to the melodic death metal that Gothenburg is known for. Since then, the band&#x27;s lyrics have always been of the darker sort, and the same can be said of the band&#x27;s imagery. After finding a stable lineup, &quot;The Dark Discovery&quot; was recorded in 1996 and released in 1998, and &quot;Solitude, Dominance, Tragedy&quot; was recorded and released in 1999. While those two albums dealt with a variety of ideas, &quot;In Search of Truth&quot; (2001) and &quot;Recreation Day&quot; (2003) are concept albums, the latter album dealing with issues such as contemplating suicide (&quot;As I Lie Here Bleeding&quot;), mourners after a funeral (&quot;I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;, a cover of Dilba Demirbag&#x27;s hit), and dying people looking back on their &quot;unforgivable&quot; sins (&quot;Unforgivable&quot;). &quot;Unforgivable&quot; also acted as a catalyst for the next album, &quot;The Inner Circle&quot; (2004), which expanded on the issues described in the song: cults, religion and child abuse.

On 4 April 2006, Evergrey released their sixth studio album, &quot;Monday Morning Apocalypse&quot;. It debuted at No. 6 in Sweden.

Later that year, Evergrey played at many festivals throughout Europe: among others, Sweden Rock Festival, Download Festival, Arvika Festival, Masters of Rock, Storsjöyran and Sziget Festival. From 5 to 30 May, the band toured the United States with In Flames, Nevermore and Throwdown. On 15 September, they headlined Prog Power VII in Atlanta, Georgia.

On 24 October 2006, Evergrey started a new European tour. They were supported by fellow Swedish death metal band Avatar, and they visited Germany, Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden.

Evergrey released their seventh studio album, &quot;Torn&quot;, in September 2008, continuing with their trademark lyrical themes of desperation and despair. Jari Kainulainen permanently filled the role on 6 August 2007, who also played bass on Torn.

On 8 May 2008, Evergrey announced that they had signed a deal with Steamhammer/SPV. This included the release of their new album and the entire back catalogue. It also was announced that the new album, &quot;Torn&quot;, would be released early in September 2008. As the deal includes the band&#x27;s entire back catalog, there is the possibility of re-releases of previous Evergrey albums with the inclusion of added bonus material.

In July 2008, Swedish/Danish band Amaranthe announced that keyboardist Rikard Zander, along with In Flames bassist Peter Iwers, would make a guest appearance on their upcoming album.

In May 2010, it was announced that Jonas Ekdahl, Henrik Danhage and Jari Kainulainen have all left Evergrey by mutual decision because of problems with the band members interacting with each other. They called it quits as to not ruin the friendship they all have with each other.

An article posted on 13 November 2010 on Evergrey&#x27;s blog contained dates for upcoming concerts as well as the confirmation of a new album titled &quot;Glorious Collision&quot; on 28 February 2011.

Via Facebook posts in November 2013, while writing the next Evergrey album due for release in 2014, the band first confirmed that drummer Hannes Van Dahl would be leaving the band to join Sabaton full-time, and then due to &quot;problems working together&quot; guitarist Marcus Jidell would also be leaving.

In August 2014, the release of the music video for &quot;King of Errors&quot; from the forthcoming &quot;Hymns for the Broken&quot; revealed that Henrik Danhage and Jonas Ekdahl had returned to the band. &quot;Hymns for the Broken&quot; was released in September 2014. The band released two more albums after that, &quot;The Storm Within&quot; in 2016 and &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 2019. Those three albums were mixed and mastered by Jacob Hansen and form a conceptual trilogy.

Evergrey&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;Escape of the Phoenix&quot;, was released on 26 February 2021. It was elected by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; as the 10th best progressive metal album of 2021.

On 26 August 2021 Evergrey announced they signed a new deal with Napalm Records and are already working on a new album.

On 24 February 2022 Evergrey announced the release of their thirteenth studio album, &quot;A Heartless Portrait (The Orphean Testament)&quot;, which was released on Napalm Records on 20 May 2022.

On 23 October 2023 Evergrey announced the release of &quot;From Dark Discoveries To Heartless Portraits&quot;, a compilation album to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the band&#x27;s formation, released on 15 December 2023.

On 12 April 2024 the band released a new single, &quot;Falling from the Sun&quot;, coinciding with the announcement of their newest album &quot;Theories of Emptiness&quot;, which released on 7 June 2024. On 15 May it was announced that drummer Jonas Ekdahl would be stepping down as drummer for the band due to having more interest in production and mixing than drumming. Simen Sandnes joined as drummer.

<doc id="609578" wikidata="Q7277988" url="?curid=609578" title="Run (magazine)">
<text>Run (stylized as RUN) was an American computer magazine published monthly by IDG Communications with its first issue debuting in January 1984. Bi-monthly publishing began in June/July 1990 (issue #78, volume 7 number 6), and went on until the magazine folded in November/December 1992 (issue #94, volume 9 number 6). In its heyday, &quot;Run&quot;″s monthly circulation was in the 200,000–300,000 range. &quot;Folio&quot;, the trade journal of the magazine industry, rated it as the second fastest-growing U.S. magazine of 1985.

The magazine contained articles about Commodore 8-bit home computers and peripherals, as well as reviews on available software packages for the computers. In addition, every issue featured several type-in programs written in BASIC and/or machine language. The magazine&#x27;s name came from the BASIC command &quot;codice_1&quot;, which started execution of the computer&#x27;s program, presumably typed in from the magazine.

The front cover was originally accented by a logotype reading &quot;RUN&quot;, with each letter placed on a key button resembling those used on the C-64. In June 1987 the keys were removed and the font became italicized with rounded letters.

==Content==
&quot;Run&quot; columns included the following:
*Magic, perhaps the magazine&#x27;s most distinctive feature, was a collection of short programs, programming tips, and tricks, mostly submitted by readers. Several dozen were published each month, and they were all numbered in hexadecimal, with each issue&#x27;s numbering taking over where the last one had left off. Readers could write to &quot;Magic&quot; at P.O. Box 101011, a box number chosen for its binary appearance. Often, a &quot;special issue&quot; published at the end of the year would collect the year&#x27;s &quot;Magic&quot; entries and augment them with many unpublished ones. This column, created and compiled by Louis F. Sander, debuted in the first issue and was run during the entire life of the magazine.
*Mega-Magic was a monthly column that included type-in programming utilities larger and more powerful than those in the standard Magic columns.
*Commodore Clinic, a letters column, allowed users to write in with questions about hardware and software issues, which would then be answered in the magazine.
*Run Amok was an errata column that published corrections to previous type-in programs and articles.
*Software Gallery reviewed various commercial software packages.
*128 Mode, taken over from Commodore&#x27;s own magazine when it was purchased by &quot;Run&quot;, included programming advice and short type-ins for the Commodore 128.
*Gold Mine was another Louis F. Sander column taken over from Commodore&#x27;s magazine. It featured tips and tricks for commercial games.

==Contributors==

Mike Konshak (aka Michael Vaughn Konshak), a BASIC software developer and mechanical engineer contributed the popular DataFile database management program and many other utilities for the Commodore 64 to &quot;Run&quot;. The code was first published in the back of the November 1984 issue. A small note, written by Mike at the end of the article, stated &quot;If you don&#x27;t want to type this in, send me $6.00 and I&#x27;ll send you a disk&quot;. 1500 &quot;Run&quot; subscribers sent Mike money in the first month, which prompted the editors to create the &quot;Re-Run&quot; disk to generate more revenue for the publisher. A series of a dozen follow-on article by Mike were published in the ensuing two years, and the programs were exclusively sold on &quot;Run&quot;″s Re-Run disk, as the editors restricted authors from soliciting for disks in the magazine from then on. (Datafile then evolved into dFile64, dFile128, dFcalc, DFword, etc., and sold by Mike Konshak through his small company, MichaelSoft &quot;A cottage Industry of Home-Spun Software&quot;).

<doc id="609582" wikidata="Q1426990" url="?curid=609582" title="Sinergy">
<text>Sinergy was a Finnish/Swedish heavy metal band started in 1997 by American musician Kimberly Goss. The idea for a &quot;balls-out female-fronted metal band&quot; was first formed when Kimberly Goss of Dimmu Borgir met Jesper Strömblad of In Flames whilst on tour in 1997.

Lillman&#x27;s death in February 2012, Laiho&#x27;s death in 2020 and Hietala&#x27;s departure from the public eye in January 2021, put an end to the possibility of Sinergy ever reuniting.

==History==
Sinergy formed when the then Dimmu Borgir keyboard player Kimberly Goss met with In Flames guitarist Jesper Strömblad during a joint world tour. They discussed the idea of assembling a female-fronted metal band, but were unable to achieve this due to time constraints.

When Kimberly quit Dimmu Borgir and moved to Sweden, she decided that it was time to turn her project with Strömblad into a reality. The first incarnation of Sinergy was composed of them, bassist Sharlee D&#x27;Angelo (from Arch Enemy and Mercyful Fate), drummer Ronny Milianowicz and guitarist Alexi Laiho (from Children of Bodom).

The debut album &quot;Beware the Heavens&quot; was recorded in 1999 and had a basic concept: returning to the essence of woman-fronted metal bands, throwing aside the operatic elements introduced in the &#x27;90s, and bringing back the style of singers such as Doro Pesch (from Doro and Warlock).

The album sold rather well and was received with excitement by European metal fans, but Sinergy was facing serious problems when it came to managing the time its members spent with their main bands. To complicate matters further, Kimberly moved to Finland by the end of the same year, making it difficult for them to meet regularly, with three of the band members residing in Sweden.

Thus, the band was essentially dissolved, but Kimberly and Alexi wanted to continue with the project. They assembled a new line-up, composed of Finnish members only. Roope Latvala (founding member of Stone, one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the position of rhythm guitarist, Marko Hietala (from Tarot) became the bassist and Tonmi Lillman was chosen as the new drummer. 

This line-up recorded &quot;To Hell and Back&quot; and subsequently toured with Nightwish. By that time, Sinergy was starting to receive world recognition. This tour was included on Nightwish&#x27;s DVD release of &quot;From Wishes to Eternity&quot;, during which band members played a practical joke in which a selection of support musicians made their way on stage pretending to be Nightwish. Marko Hietala filled the role of Nightwish&#x27;s bassist Sami, who he was to replace on their next album.

Soon after the recording of the third album Lillman left the band. He was soon replaced by Barathrum drummer Janne Parviainen. Bassist Marko left the band shortly after, presumably due to his Nightwish commitments. The position was eventually given to Lauri Porra from the metal band Warmen.

A fourth Sinergy album, &quot;Sins of the Past&quot;, began production in 2004, but due to Children of Bodom&#x27;s busy schedule, the album was never completed. In 2007 Roope Latvala performed a song with bassist Lauri Porra and drummer Janne Parviainen for the album &quot;Guitar Heroes&quot; featuring some of Finland&#x27;s leading guitarists. Latvala stated that he had originally written the song for &quot;Sins of the Past&quot;. According to Laiho, Sinergy has disbanded and is no longer an active music project.

Former drummer Tonmi Lillman died on 13 February 2012 after an illness.

In January 2021, it was announced that Laiho died of long-term health complications, and Hietala announced his withdrawal from the public eye and departure from Nightwish, his main band since his departure from Sinergy.

<doc id="609586" wikidata="Q2295379" url="?curid=609586" title="She Bangs">
<text>&quot;She Bangs&quot; is a song recorded by Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin for his sixth studio album, &quot;Sound Loaded&quot; (2000). The song was written by Desmond Child, Walter Afanasieff, and Draco Rosa, while the production was handled by Afanasieff and Rosa. It was released to radio stations by Columbia Records as the lead single from the album on September 22, 2000. A dance track with Latin and salsa music influences, its lyrics see Martin wanting to hold on to a woman, and the song is a &quot;metaphor for the universe&quot;. The song received widely positive reviews from music critics, who often noted similarities with Martin&#x27;s 1999 single &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;, and received a nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards. &quot;She Bangs&quot; was commercially successful, reaching number one in seven countries, including Italy and Sweden, as well as the top five in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and several other countries.

A Spanish-language version of &quot;She Bangs&quot; was recorded under the same title and reached the summit of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart in the United States. To promote the original version of the song, Martin performed it on several television programs and award shows, including both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards and the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2000. The music video for the song was filmed in the Bahamas and directed by Wayne Isham. The suggested sexual content of the video caused controversy and led to it being banned in several Latin American countries. Despite the backlash, the visual won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Music Video, the Lo Nuestro Award for Video of the Year, and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Video Award for Best Clip of the Year — Latin, all in 2001. The song has been covered by several artists, including William Hung on &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2004. His cover version received generally unfavorable responses from both the judges at the show and music critics.

==Background and release==
From 1999 to 2000, Martin embarked on his fifth tour the Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca Tour to promote his first English album &quot;Ricky Martin&quot;. While on tour in 2000, Martin returned to the studio and began recording material for &quot;Sound Loaded&quot;. On August 29, 2000, &quot;El Siglo de Torreón&quot; revealed the lead single&#x27;s name as &quot;She Bangs&quot; in an article and mentioned that in addition to the original version of the song that is in English, it will feature a Spanish version. In an interview with the newspaper, Martin&#x27;s then representative Ricardo Cordero said &quot;&#x27;She Bangs&#x27; is going to show Ricky one step further up in his career&quot;, and announced the possibilities of Martin performing an acoustic concert for MTV. Also, Martin&#x27;s publicist Nanette Camboy told &quot;El Siglo de Torreón&quot; that although &quot;Ricky is still putting the final touches on his production in studios in Miami and New York&quot;, the song&#x27;s music video had already been shot in the Bahamas on August 15, 2000.

Columbia Records released &quot;She Bangs&quot; to radio stations in several countries on September 22, 2000, as the lead single from the album. Thereafter, the song was released to the singles markets in October. &quot;She Bangs&quot; was included as the first track on Martin&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Sound Loaded&quot;, released November 14, 2000, and the Spanish version was included as the tenth track.

== Composition and lyrics ==
Musically, &quot;She Bangs&quot; is a dance song that features Latin and salsa music influences, and lasts for 4:42. According to Alfred Publishing Company&#x27;s digital sheet music for the song, &quot;She Bangs&quot; is composed in the key of F♯ minor and set in the time signature of common time, with a groove of 142 beats per minute. Martin&#x27;s vocals span from the low note of D4 to the high note of F♯5. The song&#x27;s instrumentation features &quot;powerful&quot; percussion, trumpet blasts, and tropical beats. Chris Willman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that the song begins with a &quot;teasing snatch&quot; of a &quot;sputtering&quot; Spanish guitar, before the disco beats start. The beats are followed by an &quot;equally inevitable [...] driving&quot; horn section, which Willman called reminiscent of the one on Martin&#x27;s 1999 single &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;. &quot;She Bangs&quot; was written by Desmond Child, Walter Afanasieff, and Draco Rosa, while the production was handled by Afanasieff and Rosa. Also, Glenn Monroig, Julia Sierra and Daniel López joined the original version&#x27;s lyricists to write the Spanish version.

Lyrically, &quot;She Bangs&quot; is similar to the singer&#x27;s previous singles &quot;María&quot; (1995) and &quot;Livin la Vida Loca&quot;; it tells a &quot;tale of a wild woman who may be hard to let go and even harder to hold&quot;. Desmond Child told ABC News that &quot;She Bangs&quot; is &quot;a metaphor for the universe&quot;, and explained about it: &quot;You know the big bang theory? So the universe is really this &#x27;mother universe&#x27; — she bangs, and explodes [...] She moves. The planets, the galaxies, are all moving. That&#x27;s what it means.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that the song&#x27;s lyrics are &quot;insane&quot; and will make cynics drive away in a triumph, &quot;Talk to me, tell me the news/ You&#x27;ll wear me out like a pair of shoes/We&#x27;ll dance until the band goes home/Then you&#x27;re gone, yeah baby.&quot;

== Critical reception ==

&quot;She Bangs&quot; was met with widely positive reviews from music critics. The staff of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine praised the song and wrote that &quot;She Bangs&quot; is &quot;simply manic with exuberance and energy&quot;, being designed to ignite the flavor of &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;. According to the staff, the single was just what the radio needed at the time of release, a &quot;summertime smash&quot; in the fall season. Also from &quot;Billboard&quot;, Taylor Mims described it as a &quot;danceable track meshed a salsa flare with heavy rock guitar and an irresistible pop beat for universal appeal&quot;. Similarly to the staff, Allison Stewart from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called the song &quot;clamorous&quot; but thought that it replicates &quot;Livin&#x27; La Vida Loca&quot;. Sean Piccoli and Lawrence A. Johnson of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; agreed with Stewart and noted that the resemblance of the song is a result of both songs being produced by Rosa. The two of them further noted that the song&#x27;s credits include a personnel consisting of 34 people, opining the &quot;life of any serious party knows: It&#x27;s all about the entourage&quot;.

Writing for &quot;O, The Oprah Magazine&quot;, Amanda Mitchell complimented the song, saying it &quot;solidified Martin&#x27;s place as a crossover artist thanks to the salsa-infused pop and the double entendre lyrics&quot;. She also ranked &quot;She Bangs&quot; as Martin&#x27;s best song on her 2019 list. In 2020, MTV Argentina ranked it as one of Martin&#x27;s best songs, and Luca Mastinu from &quot;Optimagazine&quot; listed it as one of Martin&#x27;s five greatest hits. He also called the track a &quot;Latin American bomb&quot; and stated that it &quot;is still present in the playlists of all the occasions when you need to ignite the party&quot;. Geoff Boucher of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that the erotic images of the song and accompanying music video are &quot;up a notch&quot; from &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot; &quot;and will likely do no harm to Martin&#x27;s hunk status&quot;. In a review of &quot;Sound Loaded&quot;, the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;″s Jim Abbott labeled &quot;She Bangs&quot; and &quot;Loaded&quot; as &quot;&#x27;bon-bon&#x27; shakers&quot;. Both Felix Contreras from NPR and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff described &quot;She Bangs&quot; as a &quot;megahit&quot;.

===Accolades===
Jose F. Promis from AllMusic called the song &quot;electrifying&quot; and stated that it is arguably one of best songs of the 2000s, and &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the track as the 85th greatest song of 2000. At the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2001, &quot;She Bangs&quot; was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. The track was recognized as one of the best-performing pop songs at the 2002 BMI Pop Awards. At the 16th Annual International Dance Music Awards, presented in 2001, the single won the award for Best Latin 12&quot;.

== Music video ==
=== Development and synopsis ===

The music video for &quot;She Bangs&quot; was directed by Wayne Isham and shot at the Atlantis Paradise Island hotel in the Bahamas. Isham had worked on some of Martin&#x27;s previous videos, including the ones for &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; (1998) and &quot;Shake Your Bon-Bon&quot;. The singer described the concept of the video as being part of a trilogy with &quot;María&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;, &quot;with this girl who drives me crazy because she&#x27;s crazy, she won&#x27;t talk to me or tell me her name&quot;. Martin told Univision he envisioned the visual taking place in Atlantis and felt that the Bahamas was the perfect place to film it. Jamie King was responsible for the creative direction of the video and over 100 people were involved in the production process. A body double for Martin was used during the scenes with sharks. The Spanish version of the music video premiered on September 26, 2000, for the Hispanophone market, while the English version debuted on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Making the Video&quot; series the following day.

The video begins with a group of women on a beach at night swimming to an underwater nightclub, with Martin following them. Martin explained that filming the scene was hard for him because he had to resist without taking air for a long time, as well as having to mime the lyrics without blowing bubbles out of his mouth. Upon entering the nightclub, Martin proceeds to sing &quot;She Bangs&quot; as he dances with the people in the club, with several scenes resembling an orgy. In one scene, Martin sees himself being seduced by mermaids and is later taken into a closet, in which he dances erotically with several women. Near the end of the visual, Martin spills a bottle of water on himself and the people nearby him. The music video concludes with him returning to the surface at daylight. American actor and dancer Channing Tatum makes an appearance in the video as a shirtless bartender and dancer among many other dancers, which was at the beginning of his career.

=== Reception and controversy ===

The explicit sexual scenes of the music video were met with criticism from the audience; several American television stations cut the scenes when airing the video. According to the &quot;Daily Record&quot;&#x27;s John Dingwall, with the visual, Martin ditched his teen idol image by transforming to a more mature one. It was consequently banned in several Latin American countries, such as the Dominican Republic. Martin told MTV News that the video represented freedom rather than his sexuality. Writing for Mitú, Cristal Mesa complimented the visual, saying: &quot;The use of underwater Martin shots cropped onto the dance floor is pretty amazing&quot;. She also ranked &quot;She Bangs&quot; as Martin&#x27;s 15th best music video on her 2018 list. At the 2nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards in 2001, the video was awarded Best Short Form Music Video. That same year, it won the award for Video of the Year at the 13th Lo Nuestro Awards, as well as Best Clip of the Year — Latin at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Video Awards.

== Live performances ==
Martin gave his first live performance of &quot;She Bangs&quot; on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on November 3, 2000. Later that year, he performed it live at the 2000 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards on December 5. To promote the song in Mexico, he performed it on the television programs &quot;Al Fin de Semana&quot; and &quot;Otro Rollo&quot; that same year. At the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards, Martin was accompanied by underwater dancers in tanks while he sung &quot;She Bangs&quot;. In his only North American concert of 2001, &quot;She Bangs&quot; was one of the songs Martin performed during the annual Wango Tango in Los Angeles. In the same year, it was sung by Martin at the 43rd Annual TV Week Logie Awards.

The song was included on the set lists for Martin&#x27;s 2011 Música + Alma + Sexo World Tour, 2013 Australian Tour, and the Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin Live in Concert tour. Martin also performed &quot;She Bangs&quot; along with his other hits during the 55th Viña del Mar International Song Festival on February 23, 2014. He performed &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;, &quot;She Bangs&quot; and &quot;Adrenalina&quot; with the show&#x27;s finalists, and &quot;La Copa de la Vida&quot; with Cristina Scuccia on season two of &quot;The Voice of Italy&quot; in 2014. Also, on May 13, 2015, he performed &quot;Mr. Put It Down&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;, &quot;She Bangs&quot;, and &quot;The Cup of Life&quot; alongside Clark Beckham, Nick Fradiani, Quentin Alexander, Qaasim Middleton, and Rayvon Owen on fourteenth season&#x27;s finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;.

== Cover versions and appearances in media ==
&quot;She Bangs&quot; has been covered by several contestants on various music talent shows. Ronny B performed &quot;She Bangs&quot; on season three of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; in 2008. His rendition was poorly received, with judge David Hasselhoff remarking that Ronny B had &quot;zero talent&quot;, and he was immediately eliminated afterwards. In 2020, Llama (Drew Carey) delivered a performance of &quot;She Bangs&quot; on season three of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, and in 2010, Wagnar performed the track along with a cover version of &quot;Love Shack&quot; by the B-52&#x27;s on series seven of &quot;The X Factor&quot;. Wagner was ranked as one of the most iconic X Factor contestants of all time by &quot;Grazia&quot;. &quot;She Bangs&quot; was featured in the American animated jukebox musical comedy film &quot;Sing 2&quot; (2021).

===William Hung version===
Hong Kong–born American motivational speaker and former singer William Hung gained notoriety when he auditioned for the third season of &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2004. Hung was strongly criticized for his singing and dancing; judge Simon Cowell interrupted his audition and asked him, &quot;You can&#x27;t sing, you can&#x27;t dance, so what do you want me to say?&quot; Despite the negative reception, Hung gained a following after his performance and ultimately signed to Koch Entertainment. Hung released a cover of &quot;She Bangs&quot; on his debut studio album &quot;Inspiration&quot; (2004), with the cover being generally panned. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that Hung &quot;sang it as if the song meant something to him even though he didn&#x27;t understand the words, which gave the Berkeley civil engineering student innocence or, to some of his harsher critics, the appearance of being mildly retarded&quot;. Chris Carle of &quot;IGN&quot; said that it is the &quot;best track... but that&#x27;s like saying a tetanus shot is the best kind of injection you can get&quot;. Clem Bestow wrote for &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; that Hung&#x27;s performance of the song is &quot;like a tone-deaf taxi driver and dancing like an epileptic octopus&quot;. The music video for Hung&#x27;s version was directed by Jeff Richter and filmed in Los Angeles.

On June 3, 2018, Martin invited Hung as a surprise guest to his concert at the Monte Carlo Theater in Las Vegas, and the two performed the original together. In an interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, 20 years after the release of &quot;She Bangs&quot;, Hung told the magazine that he&#x27;s &quot;grateful&quot; to have Martin&#x27;s song, and explained that &quot;otherwise I wouldn’t be where I am today. I just enjoyed the song right from the beginning. I thought it sounded cool and very upbeat. It was unique compared to everything else I was hearing back in the early 2000s.&quot; On May 2, 2022, coinciding with &quot;American Idol&quot;″s 20th anniversary, Hung returned to the show &quot;to reprise his epic&quot; performance of the song.

<doc id="609589" wikidata="Q336771" url="?curid=609589" title="Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin">
<text>Victor Alexander Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin, 13th Earl of Kincardine (16 May 184918 January 1917), known as Lord Bruce until 1863, was a right-wing British Liberal politician who served as Viceroy of India from 1894 to 1899. He was appointed by Prime Minister Arthur Balfour to hold an investigative enquiry into the conduct of the Boer War in 1902 to 1903. The Elgin Commission was the first of its kind in the British Empire, and it travelled to South Africa and took oral evidence from men who had actually fought in the battles. It was the first to value the lives of the dead and to consider the feelings of mourning relatives left behind, and it was the first occasion in the history of the British Army that recognised the testimony of ordinary soldiery as well as that of the officers.

==Background and education==
Elgin was born in Montreal, Canada East (now Montreal, Quebec), the son of James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, who served as Governor-General of Canada at the time, and his wife, Lady May Louisa, daughter of John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham. He was educated at Glenalmond, Eton and Balliol College, Oxford. He owned 2,895 acres.

==Political career==
Elgin entered politics as a Liberal, serving as Treasurer of the Household and as First Commissioner of Works under William Ewart Gladstone in 1886.

===Viceroy of India===
Following in his father&#x27;s footsteps, Elgin was made Viceroy of India in 1894. His viceroyalty was not a particularly notable one. Elgin himself did not enjoy the pomp and ceremony associated with the viceroyalty, and his conservative instincts were not well suited to a time of economic and social unrest. He said, &quot;India is the pivot of our Empire... If the Empire loses any other part of its Dominion we can survive, but if we lose India, the sun of our Empire will have set.&quot;

During his time as Viceroy, famine broke out in India, in which Elgin reportedly admitted that up to 4.5 million people died.
Other estimates have put the death toll at 11 million people. His administration in India was otherwise notable for the Afridi frontier risings of 1897–1898.

===Elgin Commission===
Elgin returned to England in 1899 and was made a Knight of the Garter. From 1902 to 1903, Elgin was made chairman of the commission that investigated the conduct of the Second Boer War. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 1st Fifeshire Volunteer Artillery Corps on 26 March 1902.

The Elgin Committee discussed cavalry in spring 1903. Many mounted infantry units had been raised during the Boer War, some from scratch and some by converting infantry units. All were agreed that cavalry should be trained to fight dismounted with firearms, but traditionalists wanted cavalry still to be trained as the &quot;arme blanche&quot;, charging with lance and sabre. Although the traditional view appears absurd with hindsight, at the time matters were less clearcut. General French stressed the importance of morale, after the success of his cavalry charges at Elandslaagte and Kimberley. That view was by no means extreme: Maj-Gen J.P. Brabazon thought sword and lance were suitable only for &quot;Latin&quot; cavalry, and that &quot;Anglo-Saxons&quot; should instead be equipped with &quot;a light battleaxe or tomahawk&quot;. After Wolseley, Evelyn Wood and Roberts (all of whom had seen the future of cavalry as being for use as mounted infantry only) had retired, the traditional view was reestablished as French and his protégé Major-General Haig rose to the top of the Army. The recommendations of the Commission were never fully implemented. The Esher Report into the future of the Army overshadowed its findings, and the Army came to be dominated by the High Tory reorganisation of the War Office.

===Colonial Secretary===
When the Liberals returned to power in 1905, Elgin became Secretary of State for the Colonies (with Winston Churchill as his Under-Secretary). As colonial secretary, he pursued a conservative policy and opposed the generous settlement of the South African question proposed by Prime Minister Campbell-Bannerman, which was enacted more in spite of the Colonial Secretary&#x27;s opposition than because of his efforts. After being dropped from the next government by the next prime minister, Asquith, Elgin retired from public life in 1908.

==Honours==
Lord Elgin was appointed Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) and Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (GCIE) on his appointment as Viceroy in 1894. He was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Garter (KG) on his return to the United Kingdom in 1899.

In July 1902, he received the freedom of the city of St Andrews &quot;in recognition of his devotion to the public service, whether holding the exalted position of Viceroy of India, where he watched over the interests of a vast Empire with remarkable skill, prudence, and success, or discharging the duties connected with county government and giving his time and wide experience as Chairman of the Carnegie Trust for the advancement of education in Scotland&quot;.

==Family==
Lord Elgin married Lady Constance Mary Carnegie, daughter of James Carnegie, 9th Earl of Southesk, in 1876. They had six sons and five daughters:

* Lady Elizabeth Mary Bruce (11 September 187713 May 1944)
* Lady Christina Augusta Bruce (25 January 187912 September 1940)
* Lady Constance Veronica Bruce (24 February 18807 July 1969)
* Edward James Bruce, 10th Earl of Elgin, 14th Earl of Kincardine (9 June 188127 November 1968)
* Hon. Robert Bruce (18 November 188231 October 1959)
* Hon. Alexander Bruce (29 July 1884October 1917)
* Lady Marjorie Bruce (12 December 188523 May 1901)
* Colonel Hon. David Bruce (11 June 188826 August 1964)
* Lady Rachel Catherine Bruce (23 February 189017 December 1964)
* Captain Hon. John Bernard Bruce (9 April 18923 August 1971)
* Hon. Victor Alexander Bruce (13 February 189719 December 1930).

After Lady Elgin&#x27;s death in 1909, he married Gertrude Lilian, daughter of William Sherbrooke and widow of Frederick Charles Ashley Ogilvy, in 1913. They had one posthumous son:

* Hon. Bernard Bruce (12 June 191717 June 1983)

==Death==
Lord Elgin died at the family estate in Dunfermline in January 1917, at 67. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son from his first marriage, Edward.

His widow, Gertrude, later remarried and died in February 1971.

==Kincardine whisky==
Kincardine whisky was released in November 2016 by Fusion Whisky Ltd, in partnership with independent bottler and distillery Adelphi.

It was made to honour his achievements, particularly his time in India when he served as Viceroy and Governor-Consul. It featured photography from the Bruce family&#x27;s archive.

The Kincardine was a blend, or fusion, of seven-year-old India single malt whisky from Amrut distillery in Bangalore and mature single malt Scotch whisky from Glen Elgin and Macallan distilleries in Speyside. Only 800 bottles were produced, with a price of about £135 and ABV of 52.9%. It was the fourth international blend from Fusion Whisky and followed from the highly acclaimed Glover whiskies.

Adelphi&#x27;s Alex Bruce is the great-grandson of Victor Bruce.

<text>Robert Cleckler Bowden (; November 8, 1929 – August 8, 2021) was an American college football coach. Bowden coached the Florida State Seminoles of Florida State University (FSU) from 1976 to 2009 and is considered one of the greatest college football coaches of all time for his accomplishments with the Seminoles.

During his time at Florida State, Bowden led FSU to consensus national championships in 1993 and 1999, as well as twelve Atlantic Coast Conference championships once FSU joined the conference in 1991. Bowden&#x27;s Seminoles finished as an AP top-5 team for 14 consecutive seasons, setting a record which doubled the closest program. However, the program weakened during the mid-2000s, and after a difficult 2009 season Bowden was forced to retire just weeks after his 80th birthday. He made his final coaching appearance in the 2010 Gator Bowl game on January 1, 2010, with a 33–21 victory over his former program, West Virginia.

Bowden spent the last part of his career in a race with his close friend, Joe Paterno, to become the winningest NCAA Division I college football coach of all time. The coaches overtook each other throughout the 2000s, sitting just a game apart before the 2008 college football season. However, on March 6, 2009, an NCAA ruling required Florida State to &quot;vacate wins for any games in which an ineligible player participated&quot;, threatening to remove as many as fourteen of Bowden&#x27;s wins from the 2006 and 2007 seasons in relation to an academic scandal. Florida State appealed the ruling, but the NCAA upheld it on January 5, 2010. Upon final investigation by FSU, it was determined that Bowden was to vacate 12 wins, bringing his final career record to 377–129–4, second to Paterno&#x27;s final tally of 409 wins. A documentary film about Bowden&#x27;s life, &quot;The Bowden Dynasty&quot;, along with a book of the same name were produced by FSU alumni in 2017.

==Early life and education==
Bowden was born in Birmingham, Alabama, the son of Bob Bowden and Sunset () Bowden. When he was 13 years old, Bowden was diagnosed with rheumatic fever, which led to a six-month hospital stay. After his discharge, Bowden was confined to his bed at home for just over a year. While ill, Bowden passed the time by listening to World War II news reports on the radio, which sparked his interest in World War II, which endured for the rest of his lifetime. Also around this time, he began to follow college football; he listened to University of Alabama football on Saturday mornings.

Bowden was an outstanding football player at Woodlawn High School in Birmingham, and accepted a scholarship to play for the University of Alabama as a quarterback. He then returned to Birmingham after only one semester and eloped with his high school sweetheart, Ann Estock, on April 1, 1949. 

Bowden then transferred to Howard College, now known as Samford University, where he played football, baseball, ran track, and became a brother in Pi Kappa Alpha. In his junior year, he was elected president of Pi Kappa Alpha. In his senior year, he was re-elected as Pi Kappa Alpha president and became captain of the Samford football team, where he garnered &quot;Little All-America&quot; honors as quarterback. The Howard College faculty nominated him for Who&#x27;s Who Among Students in American Universities &amp; Colleges in recognition of his academic and athletic leadership. Bowden graduated from Howard in 1953.

==Early coaching career==
Bowden served as an assistant football coach and head track and field coach at Howard College (now known as Samford University) in Birmingham, Alabama from 1954–55. He left his alma mater to become athletic director as well as head football, baseball, and basketball coach at South Georgia College from 1956 to 1958. After a losing basketball season, Bowden fired himself as head coach. Bowden then returned to Howard as head coach, where he compiled a 31–6 record between 1959 and 1962. In 1962, Bowden went to Florida State University as an assistant coach under head coach Bill Peterson. Bowden left Florida State in 1965 to go to West Virginia University (WVU) as an assistant under Jim Carlen. When Carlen left following the 1969 season to become head coach at Texas Tech, Bowden replaced him. Bowden then compiled a 42–26 record at WVU before returning to FSU as head coach in 1976.

During Bowden&#x27;s first year as head coach at WVU, the football team of the state&#x27;s other top-division school, Marshall University, was killed in a plane crash. He asked NCAA permission to wear Marshall jerseys and play Marshall&#x27;s final game of the 1970 season against Ohio, but was denied. In memory of the victims of the crash, Mountaineers players put green crosses and the initials &quot;MU&quot; on their helmets. Bowden allowed Marshall&#x27;s new head coach Jack Lengyel and his assistants access to game film and playbooks to acquaint themselves with the veer offense, a variation of the option offense which aids teams with weak offensive lines. Lengyel credits Bowden with helping the young Thundering Herd recover. Bowden reportedly became emotional while viewing the movie &quot;We Are Marshall&quot;, and has said that he was the original candidate for the Marshall head coaching job filled by crash victim Rick Tolley.

==Florida State==
Bowden made the move to become the head coach of Florida State in 1976, the university where, from 1962 to 1964, he had chosen to coach wide receivers because the climate was warmer in Tallahassee than in Morgantown, and because Tallahassee was closer to Birmingham, Alabama, where his mother and mother-in-law both lived. The team had a 4–29 record over the previous three seasons and he planned to stay only briefly before taking a better job, perhaps as head coach at Alabama.

As coach, Bowden was successful very quickly at Florida State. By his second year, Bowden faced rumors he would leave for another job; the team went 9–2, compared to the four wins total in the three seasons before Bowden. He said he would be content to finish his career at Florida State, however, and reportedly told another athletic-department employee he would &quot;never coach anywhere north of Tallahassee&quot;. During 34 years as head coach he had only one losing season–his first, in 1976–and declined head coaching job offers from Alabama, Auburn, LSU, and the National Football League&#x27;s Atlanta Falcons. From 1987 to 2000, the Seminoles finished every season with at least 10 wins and in the top 5 of the Associated Press College Football Poll, and won the national championship in 1993 and 1999. The team was particularly dominant after joining the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in 1992, winning or sharing nine consecutive conference titles from 1992 to 2000, and only losing two conference games in that stretch. They were ranked in the AP Poll for all but three weeks from 1987 to 2005. This included 211 consecutive weeks from 1989 to 2001, the second-longest streak in college football history at the time.

Bowden&#x27;s tenure crested with a third consecutive appearance in the national championship game after the 2000 season, a loss to Oklahoma in the 2001 Orange Bowl. They opened the following season with an upset 41–9 loss to North Carolina, only the third loss they had ever suffered in ACC play. They finished 8–4, the first time they had lost that many games in 15 years. It also marked the first time since joining the ACC where they did not win at least a share of the ACC title; indeed, their two losses in ACC play were as many as they had suffered in their first nine years in the league. From then on, Bowden notched one more appearance in the top 10 of a final media poll, in 2003–which was also the last time he won 10 games in a season.

In 2006, Florida State finished 7-6, its worst record since Bowden&#x27;s first season. The Seminoles also suffered their first losing record in ACC play since joining the league. Following that season, LSU offensive coordinator Jimbo Fisher was hired to take the same post in Tallahassee. Following another 7-6 season in 2007, Fisher was designated as Bowden&#x27;s successor, and was slated to take over the program no later than 2011. The Seminoles rebounded to 9-4 in 2008, but after barely qualifying for a bowl in 2009, Bowden was forced to announce his retirement effective at the end of the season.

===The Bowden Bowl===
Since both Florida State and Clemson are in the same division of the ACC for football, the two teams played each other every year from 1999 through 2007 in a game that became known as the &quot;Bowden Bowl&quot;. Their 1999 meeting was the first time in Division I-A history that a father and a son met as opposing head coaches in a football game. Bobby held the edge in the series 5–4, with all four losses within the last five games.

One Bowden Bowl was scheduled between Auburn and Florida State for 1999 when Terry Bowden was the coach at Auburn. However, Terry&#x27;s midseason resignation in 1998 ended the possibility of a Bowden Bowl. Another Bowden Bowl was scheduled between Clemson and Florida State in 2008, but Tommy Bowden&#x27;s resignation halfway through the year ended the Bowden Bowls.
==Personal life==
Bowden married Ann Estock, his childhood sweetheart, in 1949 and the couple raised six children and 21 grandchildren. Bowden was a Christian who credited his success in football to his faith. 

Bowden was not the only member of his family to have coached Division I-A football. His son Tommy Bowden was the head coach at Clemson University. Another son, Terry Bowden, was the head coach at Auburn University, where he was the 1993 Coach of the Year. A third son, Jeff Bowden, was the offensive coordinator at Florida State. All three Bowden men who were head coaches have achieved an undefeated season: Terry in 1993 at Auburn; Tommy in 1998 at Tulane; and Bobby in 1999 at Florida State. Bobby&#x27;s 1993 and 1999 Florida State teams were the only ones to win a national championship, however.

==Political activism==
Bowden twice endorsed and supported U.S. President Donald Trump, in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.

==Illness and death==
Bowden was diagnosed with COVID-19 in October 2020. 

The following year, on July 21, 2021, it was reported that Bowden was diagnosed with a terminal medical condition. On July 23, his son reported that the condition was pancreatic cancer. On August 5, word began to filter from the Florida State faithful that Bowden was not doing well and his family was being told to gather. He died the morning of August 8, 2021. 

He lay in honor in the rotunda of the Florida Capitol Building on August 13. He then lay repose at the Moore Athletic Center outside of Doak Campbell Stadium later that day. A memorial service was held for Bowden in the Tucker Civic Center in Tallahassee on August 14. Bowden then lay in repose in the Reid Chapel at Samford University on August 15, prior to burial in Trussville, Alabama. on August 16.

==Legacy==
===Awards===

Bowden was awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award for 1980. He received the Walter Camp Coach of the Year Award for 1991. In 1992 Bowden received the United States Sports Academy&#x27;s Amos Alonzo Stagg Coaching Award in recognition of his outstanding achievement as a coach.

In 2004, the playing surface at Doak Campbell Stadium was named Bobby Bowden Field in Bowden&#x27;s honor. The stadium&#x27;s capacity more than doubled through four expansions under his watch, reflecting the Seminoles&#x27; rise.

===Awards named after him===
On March 21, 2010, the Over the Mountain Touchdown Club of Birmingham, Alabama presented the first annual Bobby Bowden National Collegiate Coach of the Year Award, named in honor of Bowden and the contributions that he made during his career. The award recognizes a coach each year with unmatched success on and off of the field in the same attributes that Bowden showed throughout his career: perseverance, attitude, integrity, and determination. University of Alabama head coach Nick Saban was the first recipient of the award, and it was presented by Bowden himself. The award is presented each year after national signing day and before the commencement of Spring practice.

In 2003, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes presented the first of what is now a yearly award in Bowden&#x27;s name. The award was initiated by former Bowden assistant coach Vince Gibson and former Bowden player Vernon Brinson. It honors one college football player for his achievements on the field, in the classroom and in the community. In 2013, the Seminole Tribe of Florida became the official sponsor of the award. The Seminole Tribe of Florida Bobby Bowden Student-Athlete of the Year Award is presented each year prior to the College Football Playoff (CFP) national title.

In 2011, in recognition of his philanthropic efforts with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Bowden received the Children&#x27;s Champion Award for Leadership Development from the charitable organization Children&#x27;s Hunger Fund.

==Head coaching record==
In his 44 seasons as a head coach, Bowden had 40 winning seasons (including 33 consecutive at Florida State), and 36 Division I-A winning seasons. From 1987 through 2000, Bowden coached Florida State to 14 straight seasons with 10 or more victories, and his team had a final ranking in the top five of the major polls.


















^ The 1983 season includes a forfeit win vs. Tulane.
‡ For the 2006 and 2007 seasons 12 wins, including 6 conference wins, were vacated for use of ineligible players. 5 wins from 2006 (including 2 conference wins) and 7 wins from 2007 (including 4 conference wins) were ultimately vacated by the NCAA.

<doc id="609603" wikidata="Q2569509" url="?curid=609603" title="Key schedule">
<text>In cryptography, the so-called product ciphers are a certain kind of cipher, where the (de-)ciphering of data is typically done as an iteration of &quot;rounds&quot;. The setup for each round is generally the same, except for round-specific fixed values called a round constant, and round-specific data derived from the cipher key called a round key. A key schedule is an algorithm that calculates all the round keys from the key.

== Some types of key schedules ==
*Some ciphers have simple key schedules. For example, the block cipher TEA splits the 128-bit key into four 32-bit pieces and uses them repeatedly in successive rounds.
*DES has a key schedule in which the 56-bit key is divided into two 28-bit halves; each half is thereafter treated separately. In successive rounds, both halves are rotated left by one or two bits (specified for each round), and then 48 round key bits are selected by Permuted Choice 2 (PC-2) – 24 bits from the left half and 24 from the right. The rotations have the effect that a different set of bits is used in each round key; each bit is used in approximately 14 out of the 16 round keys.
*To avoid simple relationships between the cipher key and the round keys, in order to resist such forms of cryptanalysis as related-key attacks and slide attacks, many modern ciphers use more elaborate key schedules to generate an &quot;expanded key&quot; from which round keys are drawn. Some ciphers, such as Rijndael (AES) and Blowfish, use the same operations as those used in the data path of the cipher algorithm for their key expansion, sometimes initialized with some &quot;nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers&quot;. Other ciphers, such as RC5, expand keys with functions that are somewhat or completely different from the encryption functions.

== Notes ==
Knudsen and Mathiassen (2004) give some experimental evidence that indicate that the key schedule plays a part in providing strength against linear and differential cryptanalysis. For toy Feistel ciphers, it was observed that those with complex and well-designed key schedules can reach a uniform distribution for the probabilities of differentials and linear hulls faster than those with poorly designed key schedules.

<doc id="609606" wikidata="Q11773906" url="?curid=609606" title="Church Universal and Triumphant">
<text>The Church Universal and Triumphant (CUT) is a New Age religious organization combining elements of Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and Theosophy, founded in the United States in 1975 by Elizabeth Clare Prophet. The church is headquartered near Gardiner, Montana, and the church has local congregations in more than 20 countries.

Influenced by Theosophy and I AM, the Church originated as The Summit Lighthouse, established by Mark L. Prophet in 1958. He claimed to be a Messenger who was dictating messages to humanity from the Ascended Masters. In 1961, he married Elizabeth Clare Prophet, whom he announced was also a Messenger. In 1965, they moved to Colorado Springs. In 1975, Mark died and Elizabeth reformulated the organization as the Church Universal and Triumphant. Prophet&#x27;s predictions became increasingly apocalyptic, claiming nuclear war was imminent. The Church established a community at Royal Teton Ranch in Montana, where they built a series of underground fallout shelters. In March 1990, Church members hid within these shelters in response to Prophet&#x27;s announcement that a nuclear attack on the U.S. was about to occur. As Prophet began suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in the 1990s, there was reorganization in the Church, which saw a significant decline in membership and various groups splintering off.

The goal of the human life, the CUT claimed, was for each individual to spiritually evolve to the point where they would ascend themselves. The CUT taught that the Ascended Masters&#x27; plans to perfect human society were being thwarted by &quot;Dark Forces&quot;, among whom they included communists and other left-wing activists, the federal government, mainstream religions, and extraterrestrials. A millenarian group, it held that the global build-up of negative karma would result in an apocalyptic catastrophe – something it ultimately predicted would occur in 1990.

Estimates for the number of CUT followers during its heyday range from 10,000 to 50,000. The Church attracted controversy, with critics in the anti-cult movement labelling it a &quot;cult&quot;.

==Definition and classification==

The Church Universal and Triumphant is classified as a new religious movement, while the geographers Paul Starrs and John Wright termed it a sect. It has also been described as a New Age organization. Melton characterised it as part of the &quot;Western metaphysical tradition&quot;.

The Catholic Church originated the phrase &quot;Church Militant and Church Triumphant&quot; to refer to Christians in Heaven. In 1895, Mary Baker Eddy used the terms &quot;universal&quot; and &quot;triumphant&quot; in her first &quot;Church Manual&quot; as referring to the church she founded. In the 1903 edition of this work, she capitalized these terms, referring to her church as the &quot;Church Universal and Triumphant&quot;. In 1919 Alice A. Bailey, in what some students of esotericism view as a reference to the future organization, prophesied that the religion of the New Age would appear by the end of the 20th century and it would be called the &quot;Church Universal&quot;. However Bailey&#x27;s phrase was &quot;Church Universal&quot;, rather than &quot;Church Universal and Triumphant&quot;, and on page 152 of Bailey&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise on White Magic&quot;, she indicated that her &quot;Church Universal&quot; was not a church or conventional organization at all but a subjectivity or mystical entity: &quot;It is that inner group of lovers of God, the intellectual mystics, the knowers of reality who belong to no one religion or organization, but who regard themselves as members of the Church universal and as &#x27;members one of another.&#x27;&quot; The name &quot;Church Universal and Triumphant&quot; was announced by Elizabeth Clare Prophet on July 2, 1973, in a message from the ascended master Portia.

==Beliefs and practices==

The sociologist of religion David V. Barrett described the Church Universal and Triumphant as having &quot;its own distinct theology&quot;.
The CUT teaches that people are born with an innate spark of divinity and can realize oneness with God. It maintains that those who have reached their full potential have become Ascended Masters and can assist humanity.

The Ascended Master Saint-Germain is believed to have sponsored attempts to promote the freedom of the soul. The Church taught that Saint-Germain lives on Earth as the prophet Samuel, Joseph, Merlin, Roger Bacon, Christopher Columbus, and Francis Bacon. It also espoused the belief that Saint-Germain inspired the United States constitution.

The CUT identified as being part of the Judeo-Christian tradition. It presented Jesus of Nazareth as an Ascended Master who was in full touch with his inner God consciousness and who ascended to God immediately after leaving his human body. The Church also claimed that Jesus studied in India and Tibet between the ages of 12 and 30, ideas it put forth in publications including &quot;The Lost Years of Jesus&quot; and the four-volume &quot;The Lost Teachings of Jesus&quot;. It also involved Mary Magdalene in its teachings, referring to her as the Ascended Master Magda.

The Church teaches the existence of reincarnation, a system which is escaped via ascension.

===Millenarianism===
The Church was millenarian, having displayed millenarian tendencies from its formation in 1958. Like other millenarian groups, the CUT blended religious and political concerns. 
It was also characterised as being utopian.

From the early 1960s, the group was claiming that the Ascended Masters&#x27; plan for humanity was being countered by those the Prophets called &quot;Dark Forces&quot; or &quot;Fallen Ones.&quot; Mark Prophet believed that the agents of darkness were most apparent in world communism, left-wing groups, and elite power brokers. Believing that elite power brokers and communists worked in collaboration, Elizabeth referred to &quot;an International Capitalist/Communist Conspiracy of the power elite.&quot; The political scientist Bradley C. Whitsel described this particular stance as having &quot;a far-right political tone&quot;.

 This trouble would be cause, the group claimed, by a global growth in negative karma. The group linked this belief in end times to the close of the Piscean Age and its replacement with the subsequent Aquarian Age.

Elizabeth Prophet regarded American society as existing in a state of decay, comparing it to the last days of the Roman Empire. Elizabeth Prophet used the myth of Atlantis to highlight the fate of a society that deviates from God&#x27;s plan. She claimed that the Atlanteans had become wicked and so God destroyed them so as prevent this wickedness from spreading. She saw the spread of the AIDS virus during the 1980s as further evidence of an apocalyptic scenario, suspecting that it had been deliberately manufactured and was used to try and harm the genetics of &quot;Lightbearers&quot; so as to prevent the evolution of &quot;a golden age race&quot;.

The Church did not welcome this nuclear catastrophe and hoped that it could be averted. They did this through prayers and decrees, although also adopted a survivalist strategy as an attempt to survive such a cataclysm. The Church hoped that they would be able to emerge from the apocalypse to build a new age.

===Affirmations and decrees===
Affirmations and decrees were an important part of CUT practice.
Followers of the group were encouraged to recite statements called decrees; doing so was claimed to have multiple functions, including to mitigate karma and to attune the Earth to the power of light. Decreeing was a practice previously established by Emma Curtis Hopkins, a key figure in the New Thought movement, and was then adopted by Ballard&#x27;s I AM group.

===Morality, ethics, and social views===

Outlining a conservative morality, the Church expected members to take an active stance on various social issues. This for instance included a defense of the family unit and a condemnation of abortion. Observers often termed it right-wing; it generally viewed left-wing politics as being associated with anti-Americanism, decadence, and moral failure. Elizabeth regularly included condemnations of communism in her sermons, and opposed socialism in all forms, seeing it as part of the global elite conspiracy&#x27;s plot to control all facets of society. She instead emphasised a philosophy of individualism. Palmer and Abravanel characterised the Church&#x27;s viewpoint as a &quot;conservative Republican stance&quot;. Every altar of the church has an American flag, an oversized, framed copy of the U.S. Constitution is mounted in the main chapel of the church headquarters. The Church&#x27;s communicants pledge not to consume alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. The organization recommended a macrobiotic diet with little red meat.
Rock music is frowned upon, with some practitioners deeming it unhealthy.

==History==
===Origins===

The Church Universal and Triumphant was strongly influenced by two earlier religious movements, Theosophy and I AM. Theosophy had been established largely by Helena Blavatsky, a woman born in the Russian Empire but who moved to the United States. There, during the 1880s, she presented the claim that she had been contacted by spiritual adepts known as the Masters and that she was relaying their messages through her publications. Barrett described the Theosophical Society as the &quot;spiritual great-grandparent&quot; of the CUT.
I AM adopted the idea of Ascended Masters from Theosophy. In 1929, an American named Guy Ballard claimed to have encountered an Ascended Master named Saint Germaine while on Mount Shasta in California. He subsequently began delivering messages to his followers that he maintained were from these Ascended Masters. It was Ballard, the scholar of religion J. Gordon Melton claimed, who was responsible for &quot;developing much of the Church [of Universal and Triumphant]&#x27;s thought and practice&quot;. I AM taught that the Ascended Masters had designated the United States as the place where the new golden age of humanity would begin. Its political stance was right-wing, characterised by firm American patriotism and strident anti-communism, features that would influence the CUT. Ballard died in 1939. While I AM became embroiled in legal issues, new groups formed from people claiming to be Messengers from the Ascended Masters during the 1940s and 1950s.

===Mark Prophet===
Mark Prophet, the founder of the organization that became the CUT, had been involved in one of the factions that splintered from I AM in the 1950s. This was Francis Ekey&#x27;s Lighthouse of Freedom, which had established formal classes in 1954. In its newsletter, &quot;I AM the Lighthouse of Freedom&quot;, the group anonymously published messengers allegedly channeled from the Ascended Masters; Prophet was the one responsible for providing these messages. Raised into a working-class Pentecostal family, Prophet was an Army Air Corps veteran from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. He alleged that the Ascended Master El Morya had first appeared before him when he was driving spikes on the railway line near Chippewa Falls, asking him to serve their cause. Whitsel described Prophet as one of &quot;the most prominent competing Messengers&quot; from the Ascended Masters amid the vacuum caused by Ballard&#x27;s death.

Prophet severed his links with the Lighthouse of Freedom in 1958. From Washington DC, where he had lived with his wife and children since the mid-1950s, he then established his own group, the Summit Lighthouse. For several years there was friction between the Summit Lighthouse and the Lighthouse of Freedom. Prophet printed the messages he claimed to have received from the Ascended Masters in a publication, &quot;Ashram Notes&quot;, that was then mailed to members, who at that time largely resided in suburban parts of Washington DC.

====Meeting Elizabeth Prophet====

Prophet embarked on a speaking tour of colleges in the north-eastern states. In April 1961 he spoke at Boston University, where he met a 21-year old undergraduate student of political science, Elizabeth Clare Ytreberg (nee Wulf). Born to a German father and Swiss mother, the latter of whom was a Christian Scientist, Elizabeth had an interest in esotericism. Like Prophet, Elizabeth was married, but they swiftly established a relationship, annulled their existing marriages, and married each other. Between 1961 and 1966, Prophet trained his new wife to become a co-Messenger of the Ascended Masters, claiming that he was going so with the assistance of two Ascended Masters in particular, Morya and Saint Germain.

In 1962 the Prophets moved the Summit Lighthouse headquarters to Fairfax, Virginia, establishing a teaching center in their home. They then established an inner circle of dedicated members within the Lighthouse, known as the Keepers of the Flame Fraternity. There, they purchased a mechanised printing press, allowing them to greatly expand the production of &quot;Ashram Notes&quot;. Mark Prophet&#x27;s 1965 book &quot;The Soulless Ones&quot; reflected his growing concerns about extraterrestrials whom he thought were combating the Ascended Masters&#x27; efforts to perfect human society.

The Prophets briefly relocated to Vienna, Virginia and then in 1965 to Colorado Springs. There they bought a 19th-century mansion in the centre of the city, which became their home and the Summit Lighthouse&#x27;s headquarters; they named it La Tourelle. The group&#x27;s most committed members moved into this property with the Prophets and their children. Whitsel believed that the relocation to Colorado and away from the vicinity of Washington DC reflected the group&#x27;s growing suspicion of the federal government; by this point, the group was espousing a belief in a conspiracy of the government, mainstream religion, and extraterrestrials to combat its attempts to build earthly perfection.

In Colorado Springs, they replaced &quot;Ashram Notes&quot; with &quot;Pearls of Wisdom&quot;, a weekly newspaper distributed for free to anyone interested, allowing them to attract a larger pool of people around their work. In Colorado, the Summit Lighthouse launched its nationwide conferences, called Ascended Master Conclaves, initially held on a 200-acre ranch outside the city which they leased.

In 1969 they established a regional teaching center in Santa Barbara, calling it &quot;the Motherhouse&quot;. By 1971 this was being used as the site for the administration of a two-week training course, called the Ascended Master University. In 1970 they also launched the Montessori International School for the children of their followers, which was based on the educational theories of Maria Montessori. Between 1969 and 1972, the Prophets began traveling abroad – to Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and India – to promote their teachings. Over the course of the 1970s, the group would see a substantial growth in its membership. In 1972, the Prophets issued &quot;Climb the Highest Mountain&quot;, a book explaining their teachings.

===Elizabeth Prophet&#x27;s leadership===

On February 26, 1973, Mark Prophet died of a sudden seizure, leaving his wife, then aged 33, as the group&#x27;s sole leader, as well as their sole Messenger of the Ascended Masters. She announced that Mark had become an Ascended Master known as Lanello; this was similar to a claim made by Edna Ballard after Guy Ballard&#x27;s death. Elizabeth then stated that she felt called by Jesus to reconstitute the Summit Lighthouse in new form as the Church Universal and Triumphant. As part of this, the old institutional structure was broken up, new by-laws introduced, and a new board of elders introduced. The Summit Lighthouse became the publishing arm of the new CUT. Elizabeth stated that the name &quot;Church Universal and Triumphant&quot; had been suggested to her by Pope John XXIII, an Ascended Master.

Elizabeth began calling herself the &quot;Vicar of Christ.&quot; Elizabeth emphasised the importance of the feminine Mother as a counterpart to the male Father. She presented an image of herself as the &quot;Divine Mother,&quot; manifesting the Virgin Mary, the &quot;Maker of the Flame.&quot; Church members called Elizabeth &quot;Mother, or &quot;Guru Ma.&quot;

In 1973, Elizabeth moved to Santa Barbara as her permanent home. That year she extended the training programme operating there from two to twelve weeks and renamed it as the Summit University. Under Elizabeth&#x27;s leadership, new teaching centres were established in US cities like Minneapolis, Washington DC, and New York City, while she continued making extended lecture tours across the country. 1973 also saw the CUT form the Lanello Reserves Inc, a private, property-making corporation that focused on trading in gold and silver coins; Prophet headed its board of directors. The CUT&#x27;s members were encouraged to transfer their savings into gold and bullion, reflecting the Church&#x27;s mistrust of the Federal Reserve and banking system. The Church also formed a survival food processing business in Colorado Springs, with Prophet&#x27;s rhetoric becoming increasingly survivalist during the 1970s and the Church selling survival equipment to its members.

She also announced the launch of Operation Christ Command in 1973, to alert its members to the likelihood of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Fearing the collapse of American society, some high-ranking members spent $100,000 on large numbers of firearms; these were officially obtained through a joint-stock company, the Rocky Mountain Sportsmen Club, to provide Prophet and the Church with plausible deniability. These weapons were initially stored on Church property before being moved elsewhere.

====Creating Camelot and Glastonbury====

In 1977, the CUT spent $5.6 million purchasing a 218-acre property near Malibu on Mulholland Highway, naming it &quot;Camelot&quot; after the legendary Arthurian city. The Church&#x27;s growing presence in California generated problems with local communities and the media, with areas of contention arising over the CUT&#x27;s observance of zoning laws and negative reports provided by former Church members. Negative attitudes towards the Church were exacerbated by the growth of the anti-cult movement during the 1970s; sentiments that peaked following the Jonestown mass suicide of Peoples Temple members in November 1978. The CUT&#x27;s detractors alleged that the CUT brainwashed members using mind-control techniques so as to separate them from their families and ensure their loyalty to the group. The media also accused Prophet of accumulating much wealth, which was used to finance a lifestyle of servants and luxury vacations, while her followers lived in an austere fashion.

Shortly after Mark Prophet&#x27;s death, Elizabeth married another senior Church member, Randall King, although they divorced in 1980. In 1983, King filed a legal action against the Church, claiming involuntary servitude, fraud, and emotional distress; he settled out of court. Further legal issues arose with other ex-members in the 1980s; in 1986, the Church brought a suit against Gregory Mull to recover a $37,000 loan. He counter-sued for fraud, involuntary servitude, and extortion, and won his case, being awarded $1.5 million in damages.
From 1981, the CUT began acquiring large tracts of land in southwest Montana, near the Teton Mountains. These mountains had been important for I AM and subsequent groups based upon its teachings, which regarded the Tetons as the hollow dwelling place of Saint Germaine. The Church initially acquired a 12,000 acre ranch formerly owned by Malcolm Forbes before gaining neighboring land throughout the 1980s, to the extent that their Royal Teton Ranch amounted to over 24,000 acres.

In Park County, Montana, there were growing concerns among locals that the CUT would use its growing presence for a political takeover; this was particularly a concern given that these were the tactics employed by Rajneesh’s religious community in Ashland, Oregon. Some locals as well as environmentalists were also concerned about the CUT’s construction projects at the Royal Teton Ranch; they had hoped that the land would have been incorporated into the nearby Gallatin National Forest. Officials at Yellowstone were particularly frustrated that the Church’s building was interfering with wildlife migration. In early 1981, the US Representative Wayne Owens tried to introduce measures that would have allowed the government to compulsorily purchase the Royal Teton Ranch, but these proved unsuccessful.

In 1986, the Church officially moved its headquarters to the Royal Teton Ranch in Montana, selling Camelot to Japanese investors representing the Nichiren Shoshu Buddhist group. Prophet related that the Montana ranch offered her followers &quot;protection from economic collapse, bank failure, civil disorder, war, and cataclysm&quot;. The ranch became home to around 600 Church members, all of whom had to be members of the Keepers of the Flame. Many established homes on an area around 15 miles north of the ranch, near the hamlet of Emigrant; they called it Glastonbury after the town in England with Arthurian associations. Life in Montana provided greater levels of autonomy and social isolation for the group; according to Whitsel, moving there &quot;facilitated the further entrenchment of a countercultural outlook&quot; among the Church.

Following the move to Montana, the belief in a forthcoming major disaster became increasingly prominent within the group. In 1980, it published &quot;Prophecy for the 1980s&quot;, making apocalyptic predictions.

====Entering a survivalist strategy====

In the late 1980s, the CUT entered a survivalist strategy. Prophet stated that the world had entered a &quot;danger period of accelerated negative karma&quot; and that this would precipitate a Soviet nuclear strike against the United States. She insisted that the liberalising &quot;glasnost&quot; project of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was a propaganda front and that his government was planning a nuclear attack. In a 1986 Thanksgiving message that she claimed came through her from Saint Germain, Prophet stated that the Church must start preparing underground shelters to survive a nuclear war. It subsequently began construction of a multi-acre underground nuclear shelter near Mol Herron Creek on the Royal Teton Ranch; costing over $3 million to build, it would provide shelter for around 750 people and was called &quot;Mark&#x27;s Ark&quot; after the Church&#x27;s founder.

Emily Harnett describes the compound:

The residents of Glastonbury also created around 45 smaller fallout shelters for their own use.

The group began stockpiling food, survival equipment and other material, believing that after a nuclear war began they would be forced to hide underground for a period lasting between several months and seven years. In July 1989, senior Church member Vernon Hamilton was arrested after trying to buy weapons in Spokane, Washington. Although the purchase of these weapons was legal, he had tried to do so under a false name, which was against the law. Federal agents seized over $100,000 of weaponry and 120,000 rounds of ammunition from Hamilton. The CUT&#x27;s acting vice president, Edward Francis – who was also Prophet&#x27;s fourth husband – also admitted involvement in Hamilton&#x27;s scheme and received a short prison sentence. Prophet met locals in Montana to calm fears that her community planned to attack others; she denied any knowledge of Hamilton&#x27;s plans, although many observers did not believe these denials. Environmentalist concerns were also raised about their activities and the impact they had on the adjacent Yellowstone National Park. In April 1990, CUT storage tanks leaked, spilling 21,000 gallons of diesel and 11,500 gallons of gasoline.

====Prophesying a nuclear strike====
The Mol Herron shelter was completed in early March, 1990. Prophet began predicting that March 15, 1990 would be the day of the Soviet nuclear strike, claiming that the &quot;karmic increase&quot; would peak on that day. Throughout the first half of March, CUT members began flocking to the Church&#x27;s Montana properties in large numbers, attracting attention. Growing media attention followed. On March 15, around 7000 CUT members entered the shelters, to begin what the church now calls the &quot;shelter cycle&quot;. Many Church members, banking on their faith in Prophet, had quit their jobs, drained their bank accounts, sold their houses, furniture, cars, to buy survival supplies and flee to the compound.

In her memoir, Prophet&#x27;s daughter Erin writes that at first the mood of the followers underground was &quot;jubilant&quot;, but on the morning of March 16, many members left the shelters to find that the nuclear attack had not occurred. Many immediately reassessed their beliefs. About a third of the Church&#x27;s members, immediately broke from the group. By the second night underground, the mood among the followers was &quot;tense, muted desperation&quot;. Gathering her closest followers, Elizabeth proclaimed it time to call down judgment upon America. Elizabeth herself, wielding a ceremonial sword, called on the archangel Michael to &quot;let the bombs descend.&quot;

In the prophecy&#x27;s aftermath, Prophet maintained that the nuclear attack had failed to materialise not because her original predictions were incorrect, but because the Church&#x27;s prayers had led to divine intervention to avert the disaster. Another explanation offered by the church (by minister Neroli Duffy) was that Prophet had never predicted the end of the world and the event had simply been a &quot;drill&quot;.

===Decline and reorganization===
The collapse of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War also left the Church without ongoing relevance for a major component of its ideology. After the Justice Department discovered that the CUT had been hoarding weapons for several years, it urged the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to strip the Church of its tax-exempt religious status. The IRS did so in 1992, and demanded $2.5 million in back taxes and penalty fees. The CUT&#x27;s attorneys argued against this, claiming that the Church was the victim of religious discrimination orchestrated largely by the anti-cult movement. The Church won its legal arguments and had its tax-exempt status restored in 1994.

In 1996, several Church members split to form their own group, the Temple of the Presence, based in Chelsea, Vermont. They claimed that they were the true Messengers of the Ascended Masters.

In July 1996, Prophet announced that she was transferring chief administrative role to the Belgian-born Gilbert Cleirbaut, who was not a Church minister but had experience in management. In November 1996, she then announced her divorce from her fourth husband, Edward Francis, although he remained executive vice president of the Church until 1998. In late 1997, the Church revealed that Prophet had been affected by a neurological disorder, later diagnosed as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She subsequently limited her activities with the group. In 1998 she appointed a friend to have limited guardianship over her. By this point, none of her four children were associated with the Church, quashing suggestions that they might succeed her as Messenger.

The Church administration attempted to modernise the group, transforming its image into that of a New Age corporation, as part of which they loosened its authoritarian leadership and focused on developing the approximately 200 small teaching centers and study groups. Amid growing financial difficulty, in 1999, the CUT either sold or put into conservation easements approximately half of its 12,000 acres at Royal Teton Ranch; this raised $13 million for the group. The Church also had to cut back on its ranch workforce from around 600 people to 75.

The radical changes brought resistance from many Church members, especially its hundreds of former employees. Cleirbaut&#x27;s emphasis on globalizing the Church also clashed with the belief in the United States as having a special place in the Ascended Masters&#x27; plans, generating further tension. The Board of Directors began blocking Cleirbaut&#x27;s proposals and in 1999 he was removed from office. Regional Church leaders had been emboldened by Cleirbaut&#x27;s reforms and were resistant to the new board of directors-driven leadership and its attempt to re-assert centralised control.

Having moved to Canada in 2001, Cleirbaut began claiming that he had received messages from Mother Mary, Jesus, and St Germain, on the basis of which he launched LLL (Launching Loving Legacies). Various groups began splintering from the Church, some led by individuals who claimed that they were now Messengers from the Ascended Masters. In 2006, one CUT official stated that they were aware of 17 schismatic groups. The most successful of these was the Temple of the Presence.

Prophet retired in 1999 for health reasons. She died in 2009.

A 2020 article in &quot;Insider&quot; stated that the group had largely disintegrated and the majority of the group&#x27;s assets had been sold off. Several splinter groups exist, near Billings, Montana, and Yellowstone, with several hundred members. As of the 2020s, Emily Harnett writes that the church still holds quarterly conferences, which involve services for veteran members as well as an introductory program, at Royal Teton Ranch, the church headquarters in Corwin Springs, Montana.

==Organization==
The CUT was centralized and hierarchical.
Before Cleirbaut replaced Prophet as the head of the organization, the Church was run along a three-part structure: &quot;the Board of Directors, in charge of administrative affairs; the Council of Elders, in charge of ritual and theology; and the Ministerial Council, in charge of training ministers and teaching.&quot; The Board of Directors had initially comprised Prophet&#x27;s family members, although they all left the Church in the 1990s.

The Church held annual summer conferences, typically called &quot;conclaves&quot;, to which members of the general public were welcome to attend.
CUT continues to hold quarterly retreats at the Royal Teton Ranch and to hold Summit University sessions and retreats for teens and young adults around the world.

==Demographics==
The CUT never revealed the number of members it had. Whitsel thought it &quot;likely&quot; that the Church had up to 25,000 followers in the late 1970s. Melton, writing in 1993, suggested that 30,000 to 50,000 followers was a &quot;reasonable&quot; estimate. One former member told the scholar Robert Balch that at its peak, the CUT&#x27;s membership was &quot;closer to 10,000.&quot; Christopher Partridge also estimates that membership peaked at about 10,000 active participants.

During the 1990s, following the group&#x27;s failed apocalyptic predictions, membership of the Church declined heavily. Whitsel also noted that the Church gained a &quot;modest international following&quot; outside the US.

In 2001, Barrett noted that the Church had around 120 groups in the United States, an additional 120 groups in around 40 countries, and individual members in a further 20 countries. Barrett further noted that there were probably thousands of people who had read Prophet&#x27;s books and accepted many of her teachings without joining the Church.

Having visited the Royal Teton Ranch in 1992, the scholar of religion James R. Lewis thought the CUT members he encountered were &quot;balanced, well-integrated individuals&quot;, with their children being &quot;exceptionally bright and open&quot;. He noted that many members had been financially &quot;quite well-off&quot; and that this was reflected in the houses they built on the Royal Teton Ranch.

==Reception==
Whitsel noted that the CUT was &quot;one of the most prominent&quot; new religions to appear in the United States during the 1960s and early 1970s. Lewis thought that they represented &quot;one of the most intrinsically interesting religious communities to come into being&quot; during the 20th century. The Church faced opposition from the anti-cult movement, especially the Cult Awareness Network. In one case, a deprogrammer kidnapped a Church member in Belgium.

Along with many other new religious movements, Church Universal and Triumphant has been described as a cult, especially in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Articles and letters critical of the church were published in the local newspapers the &quot;Livingston Enterprise&quot; and the &quot;Bozeman Daily Chronicle&quot;. Several of the letters were written by former church members who raised lawsuits against the church. In 1986, the church was accused of using sleep deprivation to control its members.

During its history, the Church has attracted both scholarly and media attention. In July 1993, a group of academics including Lewis and Melton were permitted to visit the Royal Teton Ranch and study the community, in a trip financed by the Association of World Academics for Religious Education (AWARE). An edited volume containing contributions from these scholars was subsequently published in 1994. Writing in &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine, Stephen A. Kent and Theresa Krebs criticised this publication, claiming that it was &quot;as much an apology as a social scientific product.&quot; Kent and Krebs made this criticism as part of what they saw as a &quot;questionable relationship&quot; between certain social scientists and specific new religions, including the CUT but also the Church of Scientology and The Family. The political scientist Bradley C. Whitsel subsequently devoted his doctoral research to the group, undertaking interviews with members between 1993 and 2000.

<text>Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst, (20 June 1858 – 2 August 1944) was a British diplomat and statesman who served as Viceroy and Governor-General of India from 1910 to 1916.

==Background and education==

Hardinge was the second son of Charles Hardinge, 2nd Viscount Hardinge, and the grandson of Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge, a former Governor-General of India. He was educated Cheam School, Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Career==
Hardinge entered the diplomatic service in 1880, and was attached to the embassy in Constantinople, where he was private secretary to the ambassador Lord Dufferin. Afterwards he transferred successively to Berlin, Washington (where he was acting chargé d′affairs) for a time), Sofia and Constantinople again. As chargé d′affairs in Bucharest he was involved in negotiating a treaty and a trade marks convention between the United Kingdom and Romania. In 1893 he transferred to Paris, and in 1895 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). He was appointed the first secretary at Tehran in 1896, and the first secretary at Saint Petersburg in 1898, when he was promoted over the heads of seventeen of his seniors. While in Russia, he acted several times as chargé d&#x27;affaires in the ambassador&#x27;s absence (including in late 1902). In early 1903, he was called back home and appointed Assistant Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the Foreign Office. He was appointed Ambassador to Russia in March 1904.

In 1906 Hardinge was again recalled and promoted to the position of Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, where despite his own conservatism, he worked closely with Liberal Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey. In 1907, he declined the post of Ambassador to the United States. In 1910, Hardinge was raised to the peerage as Baron Hardinge of Penshurst, in the County of Kent, and appointed by the Asquith government as Viceroy of India.
His tenure was a memorable one and included the visit of King George V and the Delhi Durbar of 1911, as well as the move of the capital from Calcutta to New Delhi in 1911. Although Hardinge was the target of assassination attempts with bomb attack by the Indian nationalists Rash Behari Bose and Sachin Sanyal, his tenure included an improvement of relations between the British administration and the nationalists, as a consequence of the implementation of the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909, and of Hardinge&#x27;s own admiration for Mohandas Gandhi and criticism of the South African government&#x27;s anti-Indian immigration policies.. Hardinge founded the Dhamrai Hardinge High School and College in 1914. The Hardinge Railway Bridge, now in Bangladesh, was constructed and inaugurated (1915) in his tenure. It has continued to serve a crucial a role in the country&#x27;s railway network. 

Hardinge&#x27;s efforts paid off in 1914 during the First World War. Improved colonial relationships allowed Britain to deploy nearly all of the British troops in India as well as many native Indian troops to areas outside India. In particular, the British Indian Army played a significant (though initially mismanaged) role in the Mesopotamian campaign.

In 1916, Hardinge returned to his former post in England as Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, serving with Arthur Balfour. In 1920, he became ambassador to France before his retirement in 1922.

==Honours==
As well as the distinction of being awarded six British knighthoods, he also gained foreign awards:
*Knight of Grace of Order of St. John of Jerusalem in England. 
*Grand officer in the Legion of Honour, from France.
*Grand cross of the Crown of Italy.
*Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa, from Portugal.
*Order of the Redeemer, from Greece.
*Order of Charles III, from Spain.
*Order of St. Olav, from Norway.
*Order of Alexander Nevsky, from Russia.
*Order of the Dannebrog, from Denmark.
*Order of Vasa, from Sweden.

==Personal life==
He married his first cousin Winifred Selina Sturt on 17 April 1890, over the objections of her family, due to the couple&#x27;s consanguinity and Hardinge&#x27;s financial status. She was the second daughter of Henry Gerard Sturt, first Baron Alington, by his first wife Lady Augusta Bingham, who was the first daughter of George Charles Bingham, third Earl of Lucan. The couple had a daughter, Diamond Hardinge (1900–1927), and two sons, Edward and Alexander (1894–1960), who succeeded him as Baron Hardinge of Penshurst.

The first Baron Hardinge of Penshurst is commemorated at St John the Baptist, Penshurst. His eldest son, The Hon. Edward Hardinge, died 18 December 1914, aged 22, from wounds while serving as a Lieutenant with the 15th (The King&#x27;s) Hussars in France. He was also the godson of Alexandra of Denmark. Diamond Hardinge was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon on 3 May 1923.
