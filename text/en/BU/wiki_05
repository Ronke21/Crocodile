<text>Qatna (modern: , Tell al-Mishrifeh; also Tell Misrife or Tell Mishrifeh) was an ancient city located in Homs Governorate, Syria. Its remains constitute a tell situated about northeast of Homs near the village of al-Mishrifeh. The city was an important center through most of the second millennium BC and in the first half of the first millennium BC. It contained one of the largest royal palaces of Bronze Age Syria and an intact royal tomb that has provided a great amount of archaeological evidence on the funerary habits of that period.

First inhabited for a short period in the second half of the fourth millennium BC, it was repopulated around 2800 BC and continued to grow. By 2000 BC, it became the capital of a regional kingdom that spread its authority over large swaths of the central and southern Levant. The kingdom enjoyed good relations with Mari, but was engaged in constant warfare against Yamhad. By the 15th century BC, Qatna lost its hegemony and came under the authority of Mitanni. It later changed hands between the former and Egypt, until it was conquered and sacked by the Hittites in the late 14th century BC. Following its destruction, the city was reduced in size before being abandoned by the 13th century BC. It was resettled in the 10th century BC, becoming a center of the kingdoms of Palistin then Hamath until it was destroyed by the Assyrians in 720 BC, which reduced it to a small village that eventually disappeared in the 6th century BC. In the 19th century AD, the site was populated by villagers who were evacuated into the newly built village of al-Mishrifeh in 1982. The site has been excavated since the 1920s.

Qatna was inhabited by different peoples, most importantly the Amorites, who established the kingdom, followed by the Arameans; Hurrians became part of the society in the 15th century BC and influenced Qatna&#x27;s written language. The city&#x27;s art is distinctive and shows signs of contact with different surrounding regions. The artifacts of Qatna show high-quality workmanship. The city&#x27;s religion was complex and based on many cults in which ancestor worship played an important role. Qatna&#x27;s location in the middle of the Near East trade networks helped it achieve wealth and prosperity; it traded with regions as far away as the Baltic and Afghanistan. The area surrounding Qatna was fertile, with abundant water, which made the lands suitable for grazing and supported a large population that contributed to the prosperity of the city.

==Etymology==
Third millennium texts do not mention the name Qatna; the archive of Ebla mentions the toponym &quot;Gudadanum&quot; (or &quot;Ga-da-nu&quot;), which has been identified with Qatna by some scholars, such as Giovanni Pettinato and Michael Astour, but this is debated.

Aside from an obscure passage in the 20th-century BC Egyptian &quot;Story of Sinuhe&quot;, where the name Qatna is not clearly mentioned, the earliest occurrence of the name comes from the Middle Bronze Age archive of Mari, where the city is mentioned as &quot;Qatanum&quot;, an Akkadianized format (ālQa-ta-nimki). In Alalakh, the name &quot;Qa-ta-na&quot; was used, an Amorite format that was shortened into Qatna during the Late Bronze Age. The name is Semitic; it derives from the root &quot;q-ṭ-n&quot;, meaning &quot;thin&quot; or &quot;narrow&quot; in a number of Semitic languages such as Akkadian, Syriac, and Ethiopian. &quot;Ga-da-nu&quot; from the Eblaite archive may also derive from that root. The toponym &quot;Qatna&quot; is strictly related to waterways and lakes; this could be a reference to the artificial narrowing that created a lake from the springs located southwest of the city, since Qatna grew on the eastern shore of a now dried-up lake.

==Site==

The city is located in the countryside, north of Homs. It was founded on a limestone plateau, and its extensive remains suggest fertile surroundings with abundant water, which is not the case in modern times. Three northward flowing tributary wadis (Mydan, Zorat and Slik) of the Orontes River cross the region of Qatna, enclosing an area north–south and east–west. The city lay along the central wadi (Zorat), surrounded by at least twenty five satellite settlements, most of them along the Mydan (marking the eastern border of the region) and Slik (marking the western border of the region) wadis. The wadis are now dry most of the year, but during the rainy season their discharge is disproportional to the size of their valleys, suggesting that the region was much more humid and water was more abundant in the past. The early city, dating to the Early Bronze Age IV (2200–2100 BC), was built in a circular plan; this circular site became the upper city (acropolis) of Qatna&#x27;s later phases and was surrounded by a lower rectangular city.

===Qatna&#x27;s landmarks===
====Palaces====

*Building 8. The structure is dated to the transition period between the third and second millennia BC, and was abandoned in the late Middle Bronze Age II (1800–1600 BC). Its walls, which are still preserved, are tall and wide. The function of the building is not known, but its monumental nature and location on the upper city&#x27;s summit, plus the existence of a pair of royal statues in it, suggest that it might have been a royal palace, especially since it preceded the erection of the main Royal palace of Qatna. In the 1970s, a concrete water tower was built to supply the modern village of al-Mushrifah; the new structure destroyed the eastern and northern walls of the building.
*The royal palace. Covering an area of , it was the biggest palace in the Levant of its time. The palace&#x27;s northeastern part consisted of two stories, as did the northwestern wing. In total, the first story contained at least eighty rooms. Compared to other palaces of the era in the region, such as the Royal Palace of Mari, Qatna&#x27;s palace was gigantic, including massive halls such as hall C, formerly known as the temple of Belet-Ekallim (Ninegal), which was in size, and hall A, which was in size. The palace was constructed during the Middle-to-Late Bronze Age transition period, c. 1600 BC, in the northern part of the acropolis above an abandoned necropolis.
*The southern palace. Located immediately south of the royal palace, it had at least twenty rooms and concrete floors. The structure is heavily damaged, making the dating of its construction difficult.
*The eastern palace. Located to the east of the royal palace in the upper city, it is dated to the Middle Bronze Age II and consisted of at least one big courtyard and fifteen rooms.
*The lower city palace. Located in the northern part of the lower city, it was built in the 16th century BC. It contains at least sixty rooms.

====Tombs====
*Tomb IV. This was discovered in the 1920s by Robert du Mesnil du Buisson; he dated it to 2500–2400 BC, while Claude Frédéric-Armand Schaeffer assigned it to the period between 2200 and 1900 BC. The tomb is a multi-chambered shaft burial, the only one of this kind in the city.
*The Middle Bronze Age necropolis, located near the northern edge of the upper city and heavily damaged by the royal palace constructed above it. The necropolis contained three types of burials: simple graves bordered by bricks, cooking vessels, or shafts cut into the rocks. The most notable shafts are tombs I, II, III and V.
*The Royal Hypogeum (tomb VI). This is located beneath the royal palace, at the northern edge. The tomb consists of four chambers cut in the bedrock beneath the palace&#x27;s foundations, and a corridor, long, that connects it to hall A of the royal palace. Four doors divide the corridor, which then takes a turn to the east and stops abruptly; an antechamber beneath the floor of the corridor follows and a wooden stair is used to descend to it, after which a door leads to the burial chambers. The hypogeum was in use for around 350 years, and bodies of both genders and different ages were interred in it; a minimum of 19–24 individuals were found in the tomb.
*Tomb VII. This is located beneath the northwest wing of the royal palace. It consists of an antechamber, and a double chamber shaped like a kidney. The tomb contained at least 79 individuals, in a striking contrast with the much bigger tomb VI that contained far fewer remains. Peter Pfälzner suggested that tomb VII was a place for re-burial; the very long period of the Royal Hypogeum&#x27;s usage, meant that it needed to be cleared sometimes to make room for new interments and the older remains were thus transferred to tomb VII.

====Other landmarks====
*The walls. A large rampart surrounded Qatna reaching in height and to in width at the base. The rampart contained many gates, and, according to a tablet from Qatna, the name of one of them was &quot;(city) gate of the palace&quot;; the royal palace lies east of the gate in the western rampart and might have been the palace named in the tablet.
*Mishrifeh Lake. Qatna grew on the shore of a lake that dried completely toward the end of the Bronze Age, in . When the defenses were constructed, the northern and western parts of the rampart were built inside the lake, dividing it into an inner lake fed by a spring located in the northern foot of the upper city, while the larger part locked outside the walls constituted a reservoir for the inhabitants.

==History==

===Chalcolithic===
The site was first occupied during the Late Chalcolithic IV period (3300–3000 BC). This early settlement was concentrated on the central part of the upper town; its function is unknown and it ended in the late fourth millennium BC. 

===Early Bronze===
After a hiatus of several centuries, the site was reoccupied around 2800 BC during the Early Bronze Age III. The last two centuries of the third millennium BC saw widespread disruption of urban settlements in Syria and the abandonment of many cities; however, Qatna seems to be an exception, as it continued to grow. During the Early Bronze Age IV, Qatna reached a size of ; it included a dense residential quarter and facilities for the storage and processing of grains, especially a large multi-roomed granary similar to the one in Tell Beydar. The city may have been one of the urban centers of the Ib&#x27;al federation, perhaps the center of a king or prince. The early city occupied the acropolis, and none of its remains were found in the lower city. Most of the small settlements surrounding Qatna, to , appeared during this period; this might have been connected with the emergence of a central institution in the city.

===Middle Bronze===
====Kingdom of Qatna====

In the Middle Bronze, the Kingdom of Qatna was established around 2000 BC. At the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age I, the city expanded and covered an area of . This growth reduced the number of the small settlements as people were drawn into the expanded metropolis. It is probable that the earliest mention of &quot;Qatna&quot; by this name dates to the same period. According to Thomas Schneider, a city named &quot;Qedem&quot;, mentioned in a controversial passage in the &quot;Story of Sinuhe&quot; dating to the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt (early 20th century BC), is most probably to be identified with Qatna. Qedem in the Egyptian text is written &quot;Qdm&quot;, and, in Egyptian, Qatna is written as &quot;Qdn&quot;. If Schneider&#x27;s interpretation is correct, then this is the first known written mention of the city. The text also mentions that the title of the ruler was &quot;Mekim&quot; (or Mekum), a royal title known from Ebla. The theory of Schneider is debated: in Sinuhe&#x27;s story, the protagonist turned back to Qedem after reaching Byblos; Joachim Friedrich Quack pointed out that the Egyptian verb &quot;ḥs ̯i&quot; used in the text was known to indicate that a certain expedition had reached its final destination and was now returning to Egypt, indicating that Qedem was south of Byblos, while Qatna is to the north of Byblos.

====Zenith====
The next mention of Qatna after the &quot;Story of Sinuhe&quot; comes from Mari in the 18th century BC, during the reign of Išḫi-Addu of Qatna. However, a tablet found in Tuttul, dating to the early reign of the Mariote king Yahdun-Lim in the late 19th century BC, mentions a king named Amut-piʾel, who is most probably the father of Išḫi-Addu; this would make him the first known king of Qatna. Also during the reign of Yahdun-Lim, the kingdom of Yamhad in Aleppo and its king Sumu-Epuh enter the historical record through the texts of Mari.

Early in their history, Qatna and Yamhad had hostile relations; Amut-piʾel I, in alliance with Yahdun-Lim and Ḫammu-Nabiḫ (probably king of Tuttul), attacked the Yamhadite city of Tuba, which was a personal possession of Aleppo&#x27;s royal family, and took a large booty. Later, Yahdun-Lim embarked on an expedition to the Mediterranean Sea that was used for ideological purposes, as it was meant to echo Gilgamesh&#x27;s deeds; the journey likely had undeclared political motives as well, when seen in the context of the alliance with Qatna. The Mariote–Qaṭanean alliance, which was probably cemented by dynastic marriage, must have provoked Yamhad, which supported rebellions in Mari to preoccupy Yahdun-Lim with his own problems. Despite the tension and battles, a full-scale war with Yamhad was avoided.

Qatna was at its apex during the reign of Išḫi-Addu. Mari was conquered by Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria, who appointed his son Yasmah-Adad as its king. Išḫi-Addu was allied with Shamshi-Adad and is attested corresponding with Mari for a period of six years between . At its height, the kingdom extended from the upper valley of the Orontes to Qadeš in the west, while Palmyra was Qatna&#x27;s easternmost city. It was bordered by Yamhad in the north, while the south was dominated by Hazor, a Qaṭanean vassal. The many kingdoms of Amurru, which controlled the central Levantine coast between Byblos and Ugarit, bordered Qatna from the west and were counted among Išhi-Addu&#x27;s vassals. Also under the rule of Qatna were various cities in the Beqaa Valley and the cities in the region of Apum, in the modern Damascus Oasis.

The kingdom was sometimes threatened by nomads; a letter sent to Yasmah-Adad informs him that 2000 Suteans conducted a raid against Qatna. Relations with Yamhad worsened during Išḫi-Addu&#x27;s reign and the conflict evolved into border warfare; Qatna occupied the city of Parga in the region of Hamath for a while before Sumu-Epuh retook it. In the south, Išḫi-Addu faced a general rebellion; the alliance with Assyria was cemented by the marriage of Išḫi-Addu&#x27;s daughter to Yasmah-Adad in . The following year, after petitions by Qatna, Shamshi-Adad sent an army to help Išḫi-Addu deal with the rebellion. The Assyrian troops avoided engaging Yamhad and did not participate in its war with Qatna, while Išḫi-Addu took up residence in Qadeš to oversee the suppression of the rebellion, which apparently was supported by Yamhad. After four years in the service of Qatna, Shamshi-Adad ordered his troops to return; this might have been connected to a peace treaty between Assyria and Yarim-Lim I, son of Sumu-Epuh. Išḫi-Addu, who in the past had declared that &quot;even if Shamshi-Adad would conclude peace with Sumu-epuh, I will never make peace with Sumu-epuh, as long as I live!&quot;, was delivered a heavy blow, but Mari&#x27;s sources are silent on how the king dealt with the situation, and by the time they resumed mentioning Qatna in , Išḫi-Addu was dead and succeeded by his son Amut-piʾel II.

====Decline====
The political and military balance in the region changed dramatically during the reign of Amut-piʾel II; Shamshi-Adad I had died by about 1775 BC, and his empire disintegrated, while Yasmah-Adad was removed from his throne and replaced with Zimri-Lim. Yarim-Lim I gained the upper hand and turned his kingdom into the supreme power in the Levant; Qatna was forced to respect the borders and interests of Yamhad. In Mari, Zimri-Lim, who was Yarim-Lim&#x27;s protégé, married Amut-piʾel II&#x27;s sister and Yasmah-Adad&#x27;s widow Dam-Ḫuraṣi, and this seemed to satisfy the king of Qatna, as his relations with Mari were never hostile. In 1772 BC, the Yaminite tribes revolted against Zimri-Lim, who asked Qatna for help; Amut-piʾel II sent his troops to Dūr-Yahdun-Lim (probably modern Deir ez-Zor) to support Mari, but when he asked for Mariote military support at a later time, Zimri-Lim hesitated as Yarim-Lim I was expressly against such a dispatch. When Qatna tried to establish an alliance with Eshnunna, Mari, which was at war with Eshnunna, arrested the messengers on the pretext that Zimri-Lim feared for their safety; in reality, the king of Mari was probably acting on behalf of Yamhad to prevent Qatna from establishing such an alliance.
The archive of Mari reports a plan between Zimri-Lim, the king of Carchemish and the king of Eshnunna (who made peace with Mari), to attack Qatna. Such an alliance could not have been realized without the participation of Yamhad, overlord of both Mari and Carchemish; in the end, the plan was not pursued and the tense relations between Qatna and Yamhad eased toward the last years of Yarim-Lim&#x27;s reign. In a letter written to Zimri-Lim, Yarim-Lim I agreed to establish peace with Qatna if Amut-piʾel II were to come by himself to Aleppo, thus acknowledging the supremacy of Yamhad; no proof can be shown for a meeting taking place between the two kings. Just before his death in 1765 BC, Yarim-Lim called a meeting of his vassals, and Zimri-Lim traveled to Aleppo where he met messengers from Qatna and Hazor, indicating that Amut-piʾel II started recognizing the supremacy of Yarim-Lim, and that Hazor, Qatna&#x27;s vassal, was now obeying Yamhad. Yarim-Lim&#x27;s successor Hammurabi I arranged a peace with Qatna that probably did not require the Qaṭanean king to visit Aleppo personally, but indicated Qatna&#x27;s acceptance of Yamhad&#x27;s superiority. This apparent yielding seems a mere formality as Qatna continued its aspirations for power, as became clear in its behavior during the Elamite invasion of Mesopotamia in year ten of Zimri-Lim&#x27;s reign. An Elamite messenger reached Emar and sent three of his servants to Qatna; Hammurabi I of Yamhad learned of this and sent troops to intercept them on their return. The servants were captured and questioned, revealing that Amut-piʾel II told them to tell their monarch that &quot;The country is delivered to you, come up to me! if you come up, you will not be taken by surprise.&quot; The Qaṭanean king also sent two messengers to Elam, but they were probably captured in Babylon.

The hegemony of Yamhad affected Qatna&#x27;s economy; the trade route connecting Mesopotamia and Mari to Qatna through Palmyra lost its importance, while the trade routes from the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia came under the full control of Aleppo, contributing to Qatna&#x27;s loss of wealth. Following the destruction of Mari by Hammurabi of Babylon around 1761 BC, information about Qatna becomes scarce; in the late 17th century BC, Yamhad invaded and defeated Qatna during the reign of Yarim-Lim III. The political and commercial importance of Qatna declined quickly during the Late Bronze Age (LB I), around 1600 BC, as a result of growing Egyptian and Mitannian influences. Numerous small states appeared in the region and detached from Qatna.

===Late Bronze===
====Mitanni Period====
It is not known when Qatna lost its independence. It became a Mitannian vassal in the 16th century BC, but the archive of Qatna proves that even in its final period during the 14th century BC, Qatna maintained a certain degree of autonomy. Early Egyptian military intrusions to the region occurred under Thutmose I (). The name Qedem appears in an inscription found on a fragmented gateway from Karnak dated to the reign of Thutmose mentioning a military campaign in the northern Levant. The inscription suggests that the mentioned cities submitted to the king. The geographic sequence given in the inscription is Qedem (&quot;Qdm&quot;), Tunip (&quot;Twnjp&quot;) and &quot;Ḏj3 wny&quot; (maybe Siyannu); Qatna (Qdn in Egyptian) would fit better in the geographic sequence and Alexander Ahrens suggested that the inscription might have meant Qatna. Any oaths of loyalty to Egypt taken by Levantine rulers were forgotten after Thutmose I&#x27;s death. The Egyptians returned under the leadership of Thutmose III (), who reached Qatna during his eighth Asiatic campaign, . Thutmose III did not rule directly in Qatna but established vassalage ties and attended an archery contest with the Qaṭanean king.

Towards the end of Thutmose III&#x27;s reign, and under the influence of Mitanni, the Syrian states changed their loyalty, causing Thutmose&#x27;s successor Amenhotep II () to march north in his seventh year on the throne, where he fought troops from Qatna near the city. The threat of the Hittites prompted Mitanni&#x27;s king to sue for peace: Artatama I approached Amenhotep II for an alliance and long negotiations started. The talks lasted until after Amenhotep&#x27;s death, when his successor Thutmose IV () finally sealed a treaty that divided the Levant between the two powers. Qatna and the states north of it, such as Nuhašše, fell into the sphere of Mitanni. Despite its reduced status, Qatna still controlled the Lebanon Mountains away in the 14th century BC.

=====Possible incorporation into Nuhašše=====
During the reign of Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše in the 14th century BC, Qatna may have become part of his kingdom. In 1977, Astour considered Qatna a constituent part of the lands of Nuhašše, and identified a king of Qatna named Adad-Nirari with the Nuhaššite king. Astour was followed by Thomas Richter in 2002, who considered Qatna to be a secondary city in the domain of the Nuhaššite king. The tablets of Qatna mention a &quot;šakkanakku&quot; (military governor) named Lullu, and Richter considered him an official of Nuhašše. The hypothesis of Richter is debated; a number of scholars accept it, for example Pfälzner, who suggested that the Nuhaššite king may have resided in Qatna&#x27;s royal palace. Richter dated the rule of the Nuhaššite king to the period preceding the Hittite king Šuppiluliuma I&#x27;s first Syrian war, during which Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše opposed the Hittites, was defeated, and, according to Richter, had his kingdom split between different Hittite puppets including Idanda of Qatna.

Gernot Wilhelm saw no ground for Richter&#x27;s assumption concerning the identification of the Nuhaššite monarch with the Qaṭanean king. This identification rests on the theory that Qatna belonged geographically to the region of Nuhašše, but no solid evidence supports this assumption, and the Shattiwaza treaty between the Hittites and Mitannians clearly mentioned Qatna as a different realm from Nuhašše during the first Syrian war when the Nuhaššite king ruled. If Qatna was part of the Nuhaššite kingdom, its submission to the Hittites would not have been mentioned separately in the treaty. It is a fact that Qatna was ruled by Idanda during the first war and the Hittite documents do not mention a change of rulers in Qatna made by Šuppiluliuma, leaving no reason to suspect that Idanda ascended the throne as a result of the war. Jacques Freu likewise rejected Richter&#x27;s hypothesis. Citing different arguments, he concluded that Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše was a contemporary of Idanda, the successor of the Qaṭanean Adad-Nirari.

=====The campaigns of Šuppiluliuma I=====
Early in his reign, the Hittite king Šuppiluliuma I () aimed at conquering Mitanni&#x27;s lands west of the Euphrates. Šuppiluliuma waged several campaigns to achieve his goal: the first Syrian foray, the second Syrian foray, the first Syrian war and the second Syrian war. The events and chronology of the Hittites&#x27; subjugation of Qatna are debated. King Idanda was a Hittite vassal; a letter sent by the Hittite general Ḫanutti contains a demand that Idanda fortify the city. Freu believed that Idanda abandoned Mitanni and joined the Hittites as a result of Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s first Syrian foray. The Mitannian king Tushratta retaliated by invading Qatna, and burning the royal palace; an event dated to around 1340 BC. Wilhelm, on the other hand, believed that Idanda submitted to the Hittites as a result of the first Syrian war.

======Collapse======
The events leading to the destruction of the royal palace did not cause the destruction of the whole city. The Shattiwaza treaty, which describes the events of the first Syrian war, mentions that Qatna was invaded and destroyed, and its people were deported during the war. However, Idanda&#x27;s successor, Akizzi, was ruling in the second half of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten&#x27;s reign following the first Syrian war, or shortly before the second Syrian war. This discrepancy can be explained if the treaty did not mention the events in a chronological order; many scholars, such as Wilhelm, believe that the author of the document organized the text according to the principle of association, rather than following the sequence of events.

Akizzi contacted Egypt and declared himself a servant to the pharaoh. An anti-Hittite coalition, probably organized by Akizzi, was established. Šuppiluliuma tried diplomatic means to solve the conflict but Akizzi rejected them. Hittite military intervention soon followed and Akizzi asked Egypt for troops, but received none. Šuppiluliuma himself came to Qatna, aided by Aziru of Amurru. The Hittite monarch took with him a statue of the sun deity, which had been given to Qatna by an ancestor of Akhenaten. This move symbolized the final capitulation of the kingdom.

Akizzi survived the destruction of his city and continued his communication with the pharaoh for some time; in an Amarna letter (EA 55), the king of Qatna described to Akhenaten the actions of Šuppiluliuma and his plundering of Qatna. Hence, the final sack of Qatna occurred after the royal palace was destroyed in 1340 BC, and before the death of Akhenaten, to whom the letter was addressed, in . Trevor Bryce suggested that Akizzi might have accepted Hittite overlordship again. In any case, he was the last known king. The city lost its importance following its sacking and never regained its former status.

===Post-Hittite destruction===
The destruction of the royal palace constituted a break in Qatna&#x27;s history; all other palaces were abandoned and the political system collapsed. A pottery workshop was built in the place of the southern palace, while the lower city palace was replaced by two adjacent courtyards surrounded by walls. Archaeological data suggest a much reduced settlement with no regional role. Following the 13th century BC, no archaeological evidence exists to prove the city was occupied; the toponym Qatna stopped appearing and the next occupation level dates to the late 10th century BC, suggesting it was uninhabited for three centuries.

===Syro-Hittite and following periods===
In the late 10th century and early 9th century BC, the site was reoccupied but its name during that time is unknown; three human head sculptures made of basalt were discovered in the site; they probably date to the mid-9th century BC. At this time, the region was probably under the control of Palistin, with Qatna under the rule of Hamath, which was probably part of Palistin. The basalt heads bear similarities to a statue discovered in Palistin&#x27;s capital, but there is not enough information to allow a general conclusion over the borders of Palistin and its extent into Qatna. The settlement was a small one; it included large buildings that were used both as residences and manufacturing facilities.

By the 8th century, the site saw a revival in settlement; the city expanded and many houses, public buildings, and storage areas were built. The newly expanded settlement was a contrast to the earlier 10th/9th century one; the existence of official buildings and the emergence of many satellite settlements surrounding Qatna suggest that the city was a local center in the kingdom of Hamath. The official buildings were violently destroyed, probably at the hands of the Assyrian king Sargon II (), who annexed the region in 720 BC. The site continued to be inhabited during the Iron Age III, following the Assyrian destruction, but the settlement shrank considerably, being reduced to a village comprising the central part of the acropolis. It was abandoned in the mid-6th century BC.

In the mid-19th century, a modern village (al-Mishrifeh) was built within the ancient site. Houses were built on top of the royal palace floors, damaging them to a certain degree, but also protecting the underlying ruins. In 1982, the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums resettled the inhabitants in a new village next to the ancient tell, thus making the site available for modern archaeological research.

==Society==
===Population and language===
The kingdom of Qatna had a predominantly Semitic Amorite population; all the personal names from Qatna in the Mari archive were Amorite. The royal family was also Amorite and it stayed as such during the Mitannian era, which witnessed the expansion of Hurrians; by the fifteenth century BC, Qatna had a sizable Hurrian element. The Arameans were responsible for the re-occupation of the site in the first millennium BC.

The Amorites in Qatna spoke their own language, but kings communicated with their counterparts using Akkadian, which was the language of writing in the city. Qatna&#x27;s Akkadian became heavily influenced by Hurrian in the 15th and 14th centuries BC; Richter argued that a special Akkadian–Hurrian hybrid dialect developed in Qatna. Texts from Qatna exhibit many Hurrian elements, proving that Hurrian was prominent among scribes, but its predominance as a spoken language by the general public cannot be determined.

===Religion===

Details about the religious life in Qatna are not available due to the rarity of written evidence from the city; in general, many cults seems to have existed and mixed in Qatna, most prominently the royal ancestor cult, the cult of gods and the cult of the dead.

====The cult of gods====

Belet-Ekallim (Ninegal) was a prominent deity in Qatna; the inventories of gifts presented to the gods found in hall C of the palace show that she was a prominent element in the royal liturgy, where she was called the &quot;lady of the palace&quot; and &quot;Belet Qatna&quot;, making her effectively the goddess of the city. However, no trace of a temple or shrine has been found in the building. The inventories also mention the &quot;gods of the king&quot;; it is debated whether this referred to deities or to royal ancestors. Jean Bottéro identified the &quot;gods of the king&quot; with the sun god Šamaš, whom Akizzi called the &quot;god of my father&quot; in his letter to Akhenaten. Gregorio del Olmo Lete considered Šamaš the god of Qatna&#x27;s dynasty, but the &quot;gods of the king&quot; probably included other deities as well. Jean-Marie Durand considers Addu to be the god of the city based on a seal dating to Išḫi-Addu&#x27;s reign describing Addu as such. Another indication of the deities worshiped in Qatna comes from the archive of Mari; the daughter of Išḫi-Add was devoted to the goddess Ishtar and Zimri-Lim once invited Amut-piʾel II to Mari to take part in rituals for that goddess, indicating that the cult of Ishtar was prominent in Qatna.

====The cult of the Betyles====
The texts of Mari show that the cult of stones, especially the &quot;sikkanum&quot; (i.e., Betyles—sacred stones), was widespread in western Syria, and its practice in Qatna is plausible. Du Mesnil du Buisson named room F in the royal palace &quot;Haut-Lieu&quot; and considered it a shrine of Ašera. Research done after 1999 ruled out du Mesnil du Buisson&#x27;s hypothesis and concluded that the room is a bathroom, but further research showed that the bathroom interpretation must also be wrong. Pfälzner, based on its architecture being suitable for containing sacred stones, suggested that room F was the palace shrine for the cult of Betyles. Pfälzner concludes that &quot;an ultimate proof, however, for the function of Room F at Qaṭna cannot be deduced from this parallel. Nor is there a clue as to the dedication of the possible Betyle-sanctuary at Qaṭna&quot;.

====Royal ancestors cult====
Ancestors were worshiped in Qatna; the royal hypogeum provided a large amount of data concerning the cult of ancestor worshiping and the practices associated with it. Two kinds of burials are distinguished; a primary burial intended to transport the dead into the netherworld, and a secondary burial that was intended to transform the deceased into their ultimate form: an ancestor. The royal hypogeum provides hints at the different rituals taking place during a secondary burial; a noticeable character is that skeletons were not complete, and no skulls are found for the majority of secondary burial remains. There is no evidence that skulls decayed as they would have left behind teeth, of which very few were found, indicating that the skulls were removed to be venerated in another location.

Bones in the secondary burial were arranged without respect for anatomical order; it is plausible to assume that the distribution process was the result of symbolic rituals that indicated the changing of the deceased&#x27;s role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to the secondary burial remains; they were fixed on top of food offerings meant as a food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of Kispu (nourishing and caring for one&#x27;s ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of pilled vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process which he calls the tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and pilled. Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. Bones in the eastern chamber were stored with no respect for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many bowls in the chamber indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.

According to Pfälzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, which he calls the quaternary burial. Tomb VII, which most probably contained remains taken out of the royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as a storage for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for demonstrating the legitimacy of the king, thus it needed to be public and visible to a large crowd; Pfälzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the spirits of his ancestors.

===Culture===
Due to its location in the middle of the trade network of the ancient world, the cultural and social landscape of the city was complex, as the inhabitants had to deal with traders and envoys who brought with them different customs from distant regions. The inventories of gifts presented to deities from the royal palace indicate that Qatna used the sexagesimal numeral system.

Textiles dyed with royal purple, a symbol of social status, were found in the royal hypogeum. Judging by the royal statues found in the royal hypogeum antechamber, a king of Qatna wore clothes different from those worn in Mesopotamia; his robes would have reached his ankles and the hem on his shawl would have been in the shape of a thick rope, while his beard was short and his headdress consisted of a broad band. For royal primary burials, several steps were followed: constructing the burial container, anointing the body with oil, heating the body, leading the burial procession, laying the sarcophagus floor with textiles, burying the body with another layer of textiles, and finally depositing a layer of plants and herbs. Elephants, which lived in western Syria, were esteemed in Qatna and connected to the royal family; they were apparently hunted by the royals and the king himself, as there is evidence that their bones were displayed in the palace; thus, elephants were part of the royal ideology and hunting an elephant was a symbol of prestige that glorified the strength of the king.

An international style in art did not exist in Qatna; instead, a regional hybrid style prevailed where international motifs appear along with regional ones, yet all the pieces reveal enough features to trace them to Qatna. The volute-shaped plant is one of the most widespread international motifs; many pieces from the royal hypogeum were decorated with the motif, but Qatna had its own typical volute, where the crown is a single long lobe with dotted pendants branching out of the corners of the upper volute. The wall painting in Qatna&#x27;s royal palace attests to contact with the Aegean region; they depict typical Minoan motifs such as palm trees and dolphins.

Qatna also had a distinctive local craftsmanship; the wall paintings in the royal palace, though including Aegean motifs, depict elements that are not typical either in Syria or the Aegean region, such as turtles and crabs. This hybrid style of Qatna prompted Pfälzner to suggest a &quot;craftsmanship interaction model&quot;, which is based on the assumption that Aegean artists were employed in local Syrian workshops. Local workshops modeled amber in Syrian style; many pieces were found in the royal hypogeum including 90 beads and a vessel in the shape of a lion head. Ivory was connected to the royal family and the pieces discovered reflect a high level of craftsmanship that was influenced by Egyptian traditions. Jewelry was made to fit local tastes even when the origin of the concept was foreign; an example would be the scarabs, traditional Egyptian objects, that were modified in Qatna by engraving them with local motifs and encasing them with gold, which is atypical for Egyptian specimens. Aside from two golden beads that seem imported from Egypt, no jewelry discovered was of foreign origin.

Typical western Syrian architectural traditions are seen in the eastern palace, which has an asymmetrical plan and tripartite reception halls. The lower city palace also shows typical second-millennium Syrian features, being elongated and lacking the huge courtyards that were a traditional Mesopotamian feature; instead, the palace had several small courtyards spread within it. Qatna&#x27;s royal palace was unique in its monumental architecture; it had a distinctive foundation and the throne room walls were wide, which does not occur elsewhere in the architecture of the ancient Near East. The period following the destruction of the royal palace shows a clear break in culture, evidenced by the poor building materials and architectural techniques.

===Economy===

Finds in &quot;Tomb IV&quot; indicate that Qatna was engaged in long distance trade since its early history. The city&#x27;s location on the edges of the Syrian steppes turned it into a strategic stop for caravans traveling to the Mediterranean Sea from the east. The countryside surrounding the city provided the key for its success in the Early Bronze Age IV; those lands were capable of supporting both agriculture and pastoralism. Despite the modern scarcity of water, geoarchaeological research on the wadis of the region confirm the abundance of water during the Bronze Age. The land was abundant in pasture lands; when drought struck Mari, Išḫi-Addu allowed its nomads to graze their flocks in Qatna.

The written sources do not offer deep insight on the economy of the kingdom; it counted mainly on agriculture during the Middle Bronze Age but, by the Late Bronze Age, it became based on trade with surrounding regions. Securing raw materials scarce near the city was an important concern for the rulers; basalt was an important building tool and it was probably acquired from the Salamiyah region or Al-Rastan. Calcite was provided from either the Syrian coast or Egypt, amber came from the Baltic region, while regions in modern Afghanistan provided carnelian and lapis-lazul.

The main routes passing Qatna were from Babylon to Byblos through Palmyra, from Ugarit to Emar, and from Anatolia to Egypt. Taxes on caravans crossing the trade routes allowed the city&#x27;s royalty to get rich; an insight into Qatna&#x27;s wealth can be acquired from the dowry of Išḫi-Addu&#x27;s daughter, who was endowed with 10 talents of silver (288 kg) and 5 talents of textiles (worth 144 kg of silver). White horses were among Qatna&#x27;s most famous exports, in addition to high-quality wines, woods from the nearby Lebanon mountain, and goods, such as chariots, from a highly skilled craft industry.

Many Egyptian imports were found in the city, including the &quot;sphinx of Ita&quot;, which represents a daughter of the Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhat II, and a vessel with the name of Senusret I inscribed on it, plus around 50 stone vessels in the royal hypogeum. Another vessel lists the name of Queen Ahmose-Nefertari, wife of 18th dynasty Pharaoh Ahmose I. Two units of weight and payment measurement are prominent in Qatna: the mina and the shekel. The mina had different values from region to region but it seems that in Qatna the preferred value was 470 g, while the preferred value of the shekel is hard to figure.

===Government===
The existence of agricultural facilities on the acropolis during the EB IV early city indicates that a central authority oversaw the production process; perhaps the city was a center of one of the princes of Ib&#x27;al. Another piece of evidence is &quot;Tomb IV&quot;, which contained the remains of 40 people, 300 pottery vessels, weapons and ornaments. The tomb probably belonged to the elite or the ruling family of the city. In the kingdom of Qatna, the crown prince had the city of Nazala as his domain. The palace was mainly a political and administrative institution devoid of religious functions, in contrast to the palace of Mari. In the realm of Hamath, Qatna was an administrative center probably in control of the kingdom&#x27;s southern regions. During the Assyrian period, Qatna lost its administrative role and even its urban character until its abandonment.

Known kings of Qatna are:

==Excavations==
Du Mesnil du Buisson led excavations starting in 1924, and annually from 1927 to 1929; the third millennium BC remains provided scarce samples and most of the data come from Tomb IV. In 1994, a Syrian mission led by Michel Al-Maqdissi conducted several surveys and surface excavations, then, in 1999, a joint Syrian–Italian–German mission was formed that was headed by Al-Maqdissi, Daniele Morandi Bonacossi and Pfälzner. Due to the development of the excavations, the Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums split the mission into Syrian (headed by Al-Maqdissi), Syrian–German (headed by Pfälzner) and Syrian–Italian (headed by Morandi Bonacossi) missions in 2004.

Research was focused on the upper city while the lower city remained largely untouched; by 2006, only 5% of the site&#x27;s total area had been excavated. The royal palace was split into two excavation areas: operation G covering the western part and operation H covering the eastern part. Operation J covers the summit of the acropolis, while the lower city palace is covered by operation K. One of the most important discoveries came in 2002, when the archive of king Idanda was discovered, containing 67 clay tablets. As a result of the Syrian Civil War, excavations stopped in 2011.

<text>Brian Geoffrey Marsden (5 August 1937 – 18 November 2010) was a British astronomer and the longtime director of the Minor Planet Center (MPC) at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian (director emeritus from 2006 to 2010).

==Education==
Marsden was educated at The Perse School in Cambridge, New College, Oxford (BA and MA) and Yale University (PhD). His thesis advisor was Dirk Brouwer.

==Life==
Marsden specialized in celestial mechanics and astrometry, collecting data on the positions of asteroids and comets and computing their orbits, often from minimal observational information and providing their future positions on International Astronomical Union (IAU) circulars. In addition to serving as MPC director since 1978, he served as the director of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT) from 1968 to 1999. He was president of IAU Commission 6 (2000–2003) and Commission 20 (1976–1979).

Marsden helped to recover once lost asteroids and lost comets. Some asteroid and comet discoveries of previous decades were &quot;lost&quot; because not enough observational data had been obtained at the time to determine a reliable enough orbit to know where to look for identification at future dates. Occasionally, a newly discovered object turns out to be a rediscovery of a previously lost object, which can be determined by calculating its orbit backwards into the past and matching calculated positions with the previously recorded positions of the lost object. In the case of comets this is especially tricky because of forces other than gravity that can affect their orbits (one of which is emission of jets of gas from the comet nucleus), but Marsden has specialized in calculating such forces. Notably, he successfully predicted the 1992 return of the once-lost Comet Swift-Tuttle.

In May 1993, Marsden concluded that the trajectory of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 would put it onto a course to collide with Jupiter in July 1994, marking the first ever time that a cometary-planetary impact was successfully predicted.

In 1998, he calculated that an asteroid, (35396) 1997 XF11 had a small probability of striking the Earth in 2028. Marsden chose to issue a press release, which Robert Roy Britt called a false alarm. 
:&quot;... astronomers created a media storm by announcing that an asteroid could collide with Earth in 2028, only to revise the estimates hours later.&quot;—Gretchen Vogel, &quot;Science&quot;, 20 March 1998
Other asteroid researchers demonstrated within hours that the computation was in error. Marsden himself admitted the announcement was a strategy which needed &quot;rethinking&quot;, and NASA asked astronomers not to sound a public alarm like that again but to communicate with each other. He took some criticism for publicizing this prediction at the same time that movie companies were publicizing films like &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (see also Science by press conference). However, Marsden justified his actions with the argument that the problem of detecting asteroids needs more attention:
: &quot;Much as the incident was bad for my reputation, we needed a scare like that to bring attention to this problem.&quot; (&quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine, 2003)

Follow-up work determined that an impact would be unlikely.

He once proposed that Pluto should be cross-listed as both a planet and a minor planet and assigned the asteroid number 10000; however, this proposal was not accepted. A similar proposal was, however, finally accepted in 2006 when Pluto was designated minor planet 134340 and also declared a dwarf planet.

Marsden campaigned to reclassify Pluto as one of the newly discovered and rapidly growing class of Trans-Neptunian objects, the discovery of which was made possible by CCD-array detectors and dedicated surveys or incidental discoveries of these objects with relatively large telescopes. Partly at his urging, the International Astronomical Union voted at a meeting in Prague in 2006 to designate Pluto and three asteroids “dwarf planets.”, which are objects that have not dynamically cleared their orbits of other debris (except, e.g., for collections of objects in stable dynamic libration at the &quot;Lagrange-points&quot;, the libration points L4 and L5 of large, classical planets, as in the case of the Jovian &quot;Trojan&quot; asteroids).

== Family==
He married Nancy Lou Zissell; they had a daughter, Cynthia, and a son, Jonathan. He named minor planet 2298 Cindijon after them. Brian credited his mother for inspiring his interest in astronomy when she showed him the partial solar eclipse of September 10, 1942; that the date and time could be projected far in advance very much impressed him.

<doc id="586830" wikidata="Q1395987" url="?curid=586830" title="Fantômas (band)">
<text>Fantômas is an American heavy metal supergroup formed in 1998 in California. It features vocalist Mike Patton (Faith No More, Mr. Bungle), drummer Dave Lombardo (ex-Slayer), guitarist Buzz Osborne (Melvins) and bassist Trevor Dunn (Mr. Bungle, Tomahawk). The band is named after Fantômas, a supervillain featured in a series of crime novels popular in France before World War I and in film, most notably in the &#x27;60s French movie series.

== History ==
Fantômas began just before the collapse of Faith No More, as a series of spasmic, avant-garde metal/grindcore songs composed by vocalist and bandleader Mike Patton. Patton then sent the demos to guitarist Buzz Osborne (of Melvins), bass guitarist Trevor Dunn (of Mr. Bungle) and drummer Igor Cavalera (of Sepultura), with the intention of forming a supergroup. Cavalera declined the offer, but recommended who he thought would be perfect for the project: Dave Lombardo of Slayer, who accepted. The band have released all of their albums through Patton&#x27;s independent label Ipecac, however there was initially interest from several prominent record labels, primarily due to Patton&#x27;s commercial success with Faith No More. He recalled &quot;There was a whole lot of interest, at first. People from Geffen and stuff like this came out to the shows. But after the show, they disappeared into the woodwork. There were [also] indies that were interested, but none that I was interested in.&quot;

In mid-2005, the band toured Europe with Terry Bozzio on drums, as Lombardo was on tour with Slayer. Lombardo returned to the band for the final dates of the tour, which concluded on September 15, 2005.

On May 13, 2006, Patton revealed to Billboard.com that a fifth Fantômas album was being planned. Of the album, Patton says, &quot;The next record is going to be an all-electronic affair. It&#x27;s going to take some creative planning on how to record it and execute it, but there will be no acoustic instruments on it whatsoever. We&#x27;re pretty much about to go into hibernation mode. I need to, once I have a little time, go back to the drawing board and start writing the next one.&quot; In November 2008, &quot;Rock-A-Rolla&quot;, a UK-based alternative music magazine, exclusively revealed on their website that the new album was currently being worked on and a tentative June 2009 release was possible, however, in the May 2009 issue of &quot;Rock-A-Rolla&quot;, in an interview with Greg Werckman, Werckman stated that Mike &quot;hasn&#x27;t even begun&quot; recording the next Fantômas record.

On July 21, 2011, &quot;Rock-A-Rolla&quot; revealed that Fantômas would be releasing their December 31, 2008, performance at San Francisco&#x27;s Great American Music Hall as a DVD and a standalone audio download, titled &quot;The Director&#x27;s Cut Live: A New Year&#x27;s Revolution&quot;. On September 16, 2014, Ipecac Recordings announced that on Record Store Day they would be releasing a boxset titled &quot;Wunderkammer,&quot; which would contain all of the Fantômas albums on vinyl as well as a cassette featuring Mike Patton&#x27;s original demos for the band.

In December 2014, Fantômas played their first shows in six years as part of the Rockout Festival in Santiago, Chile, however no plans have been announced to date regarding a new studio recording.

On June 24, 2017, Fantômas reunited to open for Tool&#x27;s concert in San Bernardino, California. Due to his touring commitments with Suicidal Tendencies, Dave Lombardo could not perform at the show. Melvins&#x27; Dale Crover returned to take Lombardo&#x27;s place for the performance.

== Style ==

Though rooted in avant-garde metal, Fantômas&#x27; music touches on many different musical genres, making liberal use of experimentalism and noise. Fantômas&#x27; music is also noted for its absurdism and offbeat sense of humor; one critic dubbed their style &quot;dada-metal&quot;, a reference to the &quot;anti-art&quot; dada movement of the early 1900s.

Patton rarely sings conventional lyrics with the group, preferring his own bizarre style of voice music or scat singing.

The band arrange albums around concepts or themes:

* &quot;Fantômas&quot; is based on science fiction comic books, with every song simply given a page number (&quot;Page 1&quot;, &quot;Page 2&quot;, etc.). The artwork was mainly taken from the Italian comic &quot;Diabolik&quot;.
* &quot;The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; is a series of reinterpretations of motion picture theme songs. Some versions are rather loyal to the sources (such as the eerie lullabye from &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;), while others offer radical takes on the music (such as the theme from &quot;The Godfather&quot;, tackled in part as an extreme metal song).
* &quot;Delìrium Còrdia&quot; is one extended song, with the concept of surgery without anesthesia.
* &quot;Suspended Animation&quot; is an album of twisted cartoon music, each track named after a day in the month of April 2005, and the limited-edition, first pressing of the album was itself (literally) a calendar of the month featuring the art of contemporary Japanese pop artist Yoshitomo Nara.

== Non-album songs ==

Fantômas have recorded a few songs which do not appear on their albums:

* &quot;Chariot Choogle&quot; (1:51) – A cover of the song by T.Rex, featured on the Marc Bolan tribute album &quot;Great Jewish Music: Marc Bolan&quot;. Mike Patton recorded this cover and attributed it to Fantômas.
* &quot;Zemaraim&quot; (3:36) – A version of the song which John Zorn had originally written for his band, Masada, but never performed or recorded. To celebrate Masada&#x27;s 10th Anniversary, John Zorn organized the release of an album known as &quot;The Unknown Masada&quot;; Fantômas contributed this song to the release. The song was arranged by Trevor Dunn, and is one of the only songs by Fantômas not to have been written or arranged by Mike Patton.
* Where Is the Line (Fantômas Remix) (5:28) – Released as a B-side on Björk&#x27;s &quot;Where Is the Line&quot; vinyl release.
* &quot;Animali in calore surriscaldati con ipertermia genitale&quot; (0:44) – Released on the Fantômas / Melt-Banana split, through Unhip Records, in 2005. The cover art was drawn by Italian artist Igort.
* &quot;SKETCHBOOK 1&quot; - This is rough demos of songs from the album &quot;Fantômas&quot;. These songs come from the same session as the Chariot Choogle cover and were largely used to send to the remaining members to learn the songs. Page 20, 16, 26, 9, 15, 2, 19, 25 and 7 were released on the Sugar Daddy Live split release with the Melvins. Page 1-30 were released on a cassette as part of the Wunderkammer box set.

== Legacy ==
American rock band Tool cited Fantômas as a major influence on their 2006 record &quot;10,000 Days&quot;. In 2006, Mastodon cited several experimental bands, among them Fantômas, as an inspiration to expand their sound into new directions. Dan Briggs, bassist for Between the Buried and Me, called it &quot;a big part of [his] musical background&quot; and considers the &quot;Wunderkammer&quot; box set one of his most valuable records.

American metal band Slipknot was heavily influenced by Fantômas in its beginning. The whole band, who was already a fan of Mike Patton, attended one of their first shows in 1998 before Fantômas released any music and were astounded by their technical prowess, calling them the tightest band they had seen. Its drummer Joey Jordison said that the work of Dave Lombardo on Fantômas should be known by every drummer. Mushroomhead frontman Jason Popson called it his favorite band in 2000.

Other bands influenced by Fantômas are CKY, The Locust and Car Bomb. Known fans of it included actor Danny DeVito, writer Alan Moore and dance music artist Moby.

<text>Community service is unpaid work performed by a person or group of people for the benefit and betterment of their community contributing to a noble cause. In many cases, people doing community service are compensated in other ways, such as getting a lunch for free. In many countries, there are programs to incite people to do community service. People may do community service to get citizenship. In some cases, it is possible to replace a criminal justice sanctions with community service. There may also be school or class requirements. Obtaining certain benefits may be linked to doing some form of community service. For all these reasons, it is distinct from volunteering. 

== Background ==
(Community) service is a non-paying job performed by one person or a group of people for the benefit of their community or its institutions. Community service is distinct from volunteering, since it is not always performed on a voluntary basis and may be performed for a variety of reasons, including:
* Required by a government as a part of citizenship requirements, like the mandatory &quot;Hand and hitch-up services&quot; for some municipalities in Austria and Germany, or generally in lieu of military service (see: &quot;Zivildienst&quot; and Alternative civilian service) or for civil conscription services.
* Required as a substitution of, or in addition to, other criminal justice sanctions – when performed for this reason it may also be referred to as &quot;community payback&quot; or &quot;compensatory service&quot;.
* Mandated by schools to meet the requirements of a class, such as in the case of service-learning or to meet the requirements of graduating as class valedictorian.
* As an workfare obligation, as condition of the receipt of social and financial benefits, see Workfare in the United Kingdom
* In Sweden it is a suspended sentence called &quot;samhällstjänst&quot; (&quot;society service&quot;).
Community service and volunteerism are supported and encouraged across the world, influenced by a mix of personal, societal, and cultural factors. Research shows that individual traits like personality and religiosity, combined with organizational settings, play a significant role in fostering long-term volunteerism. Different methods to encourage volunteering can result in volunteers motivated by their own interests or a desire to help others, suggesting the importance of promoting community engagement and altruism for sustained involvement. A study spanning 21 countries linked economic development, education, cultural values, and political systems to higher rates of formal volunteering, indicating a global perspective on volunteer engagement. Student volunteering, particularly in Western English-speaking countries, is driven by altruistic and career-oriented motivations, highlighting a strong culture of volunteerism among young people. Moreover, the motivation to volunteer varies with cultural values across different regions, and is shaped by societal expectations and cultural norms.

== Reasons ==

=== Educational community service ===

==== Secondary education ====
Some educational jurisdictions in the United States require students to perform community service hours to graduate from high school. In some high schools in Washington, for example, students must finish 200 hours of community service to get a diploma. Some school districts in Washington, including Seattle Public Schools, differentiate between community service and &quot;service learning&quot;, requiring students to demonstrate that their work has contributed to their education. If a student in high school is taking an Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) course, community service is often needed. Whether American public schools could require volunteer hours for high school graduation was challenged in &quot;Immediato v. Rye Neck School District&quot;, but the court found no violation.

Many other high schools do not require community service hours for graduation, but still see an impressive number of students get involved in their communities. For example, in Palo Alto, California, students at Palo Alto High School log about 45,000 hours of community service every year. As a result, the school&#x27;s College and Career Center awards 250–300 students the President&#x27;s Volunteer Service Award every year for their hard work.

Starting in 2010, Danish high school students receive a special diploma if they complete at least 20 hours of voluntary work.

The International Baccalaureate program formerly required 50 hours of community service, together with a written reflection on the service performed, to fulfill the requirement of 150 hours of CAS (creativity, action, and service) and receive an IB diploma.

==== Higher education ====

Though not technically considered a requirement, many colleges include community service as an unofficial requirement for acceptance. However, some colleges prefer work experience over community service, and some require that their students also continue community service for some specific number of hours to graduate. Some schools also offer unique &quot;community service&quot; courses, awarding credit to students who complete a certain number of community service hours. Some academic honor societies, along with some fraternities and sororities in North America, require community service to join and others require each member to continue doing community service.

Many student organizations exist for the purpose of community service, the largest of which is Alpha Phi Omega. Community service projects are also done by sororities and fraternities.

Beginning in the 1980s, colleges began using service-learning as a pedagogy. A partnership of college presidents began in 1985 with the initiative of boosting community service in their colleges. This alliance called Campus Compact, led the way for many other schools to adopt service-learning courses and activities.

Service-learning courses vary widely in time span, quality, and in the balance of &quot;service&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; stressed in the course. A typical service-learning course, however, has these factors in common:
* A &quot;service&quot; component where the student spends time serving in the community meeting actual needs
* A &quot;learning&quot; component where students seek out or are taught information—often both interpersonal and academic—that they integrate into their service
* A &quot;reflection&quot; component that ties service and learning together
Reflection is sometimes symbolized by the hyphen in the term &quot;service-learning&quot; to indicate that it has a central role in learning by serving. Reflection is simply a scheduled consideration of one&#x27;s own experiences and thoughts. This can take many forms, including journals, blogs, and discussions.

Service-learning courses present learning the material in context, meaning that students often learn effectively and tend to apply what was learned. As the book &quot;Where&#x27;s the Learning in Service-Learning?&quot; notes, &quot;Students engaged in service-learning are engaged in authentic situations; they get to know real people whose lives are affected by these issues... As a result, they have lots of questions—real questions that they want to have answered.&quot; Thus, students become interested and motivated to learn the materials to resolve their questions.

Community service learning strives to connect or re-connect students with serving their community after they finish their course. It creates a bridge for the lack of community service found among college-age people in the United States.

==== Community service-learning ====
The one serving may be able to take something away from the experience and be able to use any newfound knowledge or interpersonal discoveries to improve their future servitude and the people around them. To gain the most from community service requires balancing learning with serving. Learning and serving at the same time improves a student&#x27;s community while teaching life lessons and building character.

Community service-learning is &quot;about leadership development as well as traditional information and skill acquisition&quot;. Therefore, the combination of people doing service and learning at the same time teaches them how to be effective and how to be effective regarding what is important to them. It can improve their overall experience and application opportunities they gain from it. By adding service to learning, and balancing the two, community service can become more than just the act of serving. The goal of service-learning is to achieve large change through small actions. By being a classroom, a hands-on learning experience, and an opportunity to change the community, people are able to not only serve, but impact themselves as well.

===== Definition =====
According to Fayetteville State University, &quot;service learning is a process of involving students in community service activities combined with facilitated means for applying the experience to their academic and personal development. It is a form of experiential education aimed at enhancing and enriching student learning in course material. When compared to other forms of experiential learning like internships and cooperative education, it is similar in that it is student-centered, hands-on and directly applicable to the curriculum.&quot;

Professor Freddy Cardoza defines community service-learning as &quot;a pedagogy (or a specific teaching-learning approach) that has few lectures, and is a more interactive hands on educational strategy which provides students with instruction while leading them through meaningful community service experiences and engaging them in personal reflection on those experiences in order to build character and to teach problem-solving skills and civic responsibility.&quot; Cardoza stressed that it was important for a student take some time and reflect on what they are experiencing, seeing, doing, and what problems they are encountering and how they are going to apply what they have been learning to solve these problems. In other words, service-learning aims to link the personal and interpersonal development with cognitive development, as well as equipping the student with critical knowledge to help them understand the world.

Character.org defines service-learning as &quot;different than community service in several key ways. Service learning includes student leadership, reflective and academic components, and chances for celebration once the service activity has been successfully completed. Students reflect on community needs, ways to help, and once their service has been completed, they can internalise how their efforts have helped, while learning more about academics such as geography, math, or science.&quot;

==== Critical service learning ====
For community service to be effective, a different sector of community service learning; critical service, emerged in colleges throughout nations. The emergence of critical service learning in colleges had to do with solving the question of how students can create longstanding, effective change in the services they do for their communities. Critical service learning is centered around teaching and learning methods that focus on the transformation of power and deconstructions of systemic inequalities through community engagement by students. According to Mitchell, there are three different approaches required to achieve a critical learning service status. These are: redistributing power to marginalized groups of people; developing meaningful partnerships with community members/partners and those in the classroom; and, approaching service learning through the lens of making impactful social change. The ultimate goal of this sector is to connect students&#x27; services to their learning discourses. Students then ask themselves how their services create political and social change in these communities. Meeting individual needs in relation to poverty is not the main focus for critical service learning. Instead it is to address how students can become agents of social change and dismantle the institutions that allow for inequalities to exist in the communities they serve in the first place.

===== Background of critical service learning =====
Critical service learning emerged through the ideologies of Dewey in 1902. His main goal was reconnecting education and communities. He argued that it was essential that students took their learning discourses and used it to connect to their personal experiences. Doing this would allow for social development and the well-being of communities. Between World War 1 and World War 2 Kilpatrick, a  progressive leader, introduced &quot;the project method&quot; to educational practices. He stressed the importance of introducing social reforms that focused on the livelihood of persons outside of the classrooms. Some attempts to create policy for critical service learning started in the 50s and continued through the 60s. In the 50s, The Citizenship Education Project set precedents to understanding the frameworks between learning in the classrooms and action in the communities. This precedent led to many more political reform efforts to incorporate critical service learning into education in the 70s. Many educational institutions introduced political proposals that focused on the integration of learning and civic engagement with communities. Reform documents were not made until the 80s but Reagan and his era had already moved past progressivism and towards neoliberalism. Since reforms in the past 100 years  haven&#x27;t seemed to work, educational leaders and schools have made critical service learning into more grassroots type movements. By not focusing on state reforms, critical service learning has now become a methodology in University programs and other local organizations. Community and Critical service brings an opportunity of change for students and for the communities they serve.

=== Court-ordered service ===
People convicted of a crime may be required to perform community service or to work for agencies in the sentencing jurisdiction either entirely or partially as a substitution of other judicial remedies and sanctions, such as incarceration or fines. For instance, a fine may be reduced in exchange for a prescribed number of hours of community service. The court may allow the defendant to choose their community service, which must then be documented by &quot;credible agencies&quot;, such as non-profit organizations, or may mandate a specific service.

Sometimes the sentencing is specifically targeted to the defendant&#x27;s crime, for example, a litterer may have to clean a park or roadside, or a drunk driver might appear before school groups to explain why drunk driving is a crime. Also, a sentence allowing for a broader choice may prohibit certain services that the offender would reasonably be expected to perform anyway.

In the United Kingdom, community service is now officially referred to by the Home Office as more straightforward &quot;compulsory unpaid work&quot;. Compulsory unpaid work includes up to 300 hours of activities, such as conservation work, cleaning up graffiti, or working with a charity. The Howard League for Penal Reform (the world&#x27;s oldest prison reform organization) is a prominent advocate for increased community sentencing to reduce prison population and improve rehabilitation.

=== Community service for institutions ===
Many institutions require and/or give incentives to students or employees alike to volunteer their time to community service programs. From volunteering to participating in such charity events like walks or runs, institutes continue the practice or require their employees or students to grow in camaraderie while giving back to various communities. Many institutions also provide opportunities for employees and students to work together, and most student groups participate in their own form of community service. Each is unique in its own right; all are incredibly popular with employees; and in all of these programs, human resources plays an integral role.

One such program, Johns Hopkins University, under the leadership of Johns Hopkins University president Ronald J. Daniels and the chief executive officer of Baltimore City Schools, the university&#x27;s human resources and community affairs departments worked with the school system to develop the Johns Hopkins Takes Time for Schools program in 2009, launching it on March 3, 2010. The program is a service partnership aimed at providing support and assistance to Baltimore City Schools (BCS) while providing faculty and staff an avenue for community service, offering their talents to the city&#x27;s youth and improving the administrative and educational capacities of the area&#x27;s school system.

Some institutes even give their students or employees a guaranteed number of days or weeks of leave for certain acceptable community service programs. One example is East Carolina University, which gives 24 hours of community service leave for full-time employees per year as an incentive and compensation for community service.

In addition, approximately 40% of Fortune 500 companies offer volunteer grant programs where companies provide monetary donations to nonprofit organizations in recognition of their employee&#x27;s volunteerism (e.g. $500 volunteer grant after 25 hours of community service).

=== Religious reasons for serving ===
Religion is one of the greatest motivating forces behind community service. &quot;Although beneficence and good works are also important secular goals, religion remains one of the major motivating forces behind community service.&quot; All the major religious groups emphasize values of charity, compassion, and community.

Beyond required community service, some religious groups emphasize serving one&#x27;s community. These groups and churches reach out by holding Vacation Bible Schools for children, hosting Red Cross blood drives, having fall carnivals, or offering free meals. Through these services, churches are able to benefit neighborhoods and families. Some churches create non-profit organizations that can help the public. Crisis pregnancy centers are often run by religious groups to promote pro-life values in local families. To meet impoverished people&#x27;s needs, some churches provide a food pantry or start a homeless shelter. Also, certain churches provide daycare so that busy parents can work.

==== Christian service ====
Christianity promotes community service. In fact, volunteer work is popular amongst churches. According to Diana R. Garland, a professor of social work at Baylor University in Texas, &quot;In the United States, congregations serve as a major source of volunteers, with church attendance known to be the best general predictor of involvement in volunteering.&quot; Some non-governmental (NGO) community service organizations were founded by Christians seeking to put their beliefs into practice. Three prominent examples are Samaritan&#x27;s Purse, Salvation Army, and Habitat for Humanity.

Samaritan&#x27;s Purse was inspired by a prayer of evangelist Robert Pierce, &quot;Let my heart be broken for the things which break the heart of God.&quot; After traveling through Asia and seeing first-hand the suffering of impoverished children, lepers, and orphans—in 1970, Pierce founded Samaritan&#x27;s Purse. Today, Samaritan&#x27;s Purse reaches millions of people across the globe by providing aid such as disaster relief, medical assistance, and child care. A notable Samaritan&#x27;s Purse project is Operation Christmas Child headed by Franklin Graham.

The Salvation Army was founded by William Booth and his wife Catherine Booth in 1865. Booth was a Methodist minister and preacher on the streets of London. His tent meetings gathered crowds of drunkards, prostitutes and thieves who eventually became the first &quot;soldiers&quot; in the army, which has grown to 1,442,388 members in 126 countries. The Salvation Army&#x27;s motto is &quot;Doing the Most Good&quot; and does so by providing aid such as shelter, food, clothing, spiritual training and disaster relief.

Habitat for Humanity provides housing for people in need. Founded by Millard Fuller, its vision is to &quot;...put God&#x27;s love into action by bringing people together to build homes, communities and hope&quot;. Habitat for Humanity has built or repaired over 800,000 homes and served more than 4 million people worldwide since its creation in 1976. They describe their vision as &quot;...a world where everyone has a decent place to live&quot;.

====Muslim service====
Islam promotes volunteerism by calling on its followers to provide their time, knowledge, and wealth of their own free will. In Islam one of the pillars of the religion is Zakat which is the obligatory form of charity especially to the needy. There are two different forms of volunteerism in Islam.

The first form of Volunteering involves spending money or providing physical support in order to help others. This can be a form of Zakat or Sadaqah. These two acts of volunteering also count as forms of worship for the sake of spiritual purification. This form is called Al-Mujahadah fi sabil Allah bi al-Amwal, which means, striving in the cause of Allah with one&#x27;s goods (Sulaiman).

The second form of volunteering involves providing goods and services without spending money. An example of providing a service without spending money would be, &quot;visiting the sick, being an attendant to the blind, collection and distribution of donations, constructing houses (for the homeless), schools (for the poor children), orphanages, retirement centers, nursing homes, hospitals and working in the Nongovernment Islamic Organizations that need volunteers due to limited resources&quot;(Sulaiman). The second example would be,&quot; providing intellectual support, for example, being a teacher or tutor for the poor&quot; (Sulaiman).

== Personal benefits of serving ==
Community service also allows those participating to reflect on the difference they are making in society. Some participants of a community service project may find themselves gaining a greater understanding of their roles in the community, as well as the impact of their contributions towards those in need of service. Because community service outlets vary, those who serve are exposed to many different kinds of people, environments, and situations.

A benefit of participating in community service is to gain greater experience and benefits to help individuals gain advantages for their careers. According to &quot;The Give and Take of Volunteering: Motives, Benefits, and Personal Connections among Irish Volunteers&quot;, &quot; Career benefits took different forms depending on the person&#x27;s career stage and on the type of work involved&quot;(McKeena). At the beginning of a profession, volunteering could be beneficial, giving people at a more practical level of hands-on experience in health and social care, while persons at a more advanced level of their careers achieved career-related benefits from high-level relationships for job-related reasons (Mckenna).

With each new community service project, some participants may gain insightful experience in a variety of areas. Participants may also internalize the information that they found personally insightful for future use. While simply performing community service is valuable to the recipients, those serving often find it beneficial to pause and reflect on how they are changing society for the better. Schools often take students on community service projects so they can learn how their individual actions affect the well-being of the public. Participants may find that serving the public fosters a more solidified view of self and purpose.

Those involved in community service learning may also find that after serving the community for an extended period of time, they have an advantage in real-world experience. Eventually, the skills and knowledge obtained while working with the community may be applied in future areas of work. Community service may also increase a participant&#x27;s social connectivity. Because most community service opportunities allow others to interact and work with other individuals, this service may help volunteers network and connect with others toward a common goal.

People gain the most from their community service projects when they volunteer their time to help people that they have never interacted with before. This direct contact allows people to see life from a different perspective and reevaluate their opinions of others. Many young people who get involved in community service come out with a more well-rounded worldview.

Another benefit in participating in community service is a greater understanding and appreciation for diversity. Appreciating other cultures and breaking down stereotypes is important to becoming a responsible citizen and better person. By participating in a community service project where interaction is required, personal relationships can begin to grow. These personal relationships help people have informal and consistent interactions that through time, often break down negative stereotypes.

These relationships can also facilitate more opinions and viewpoints surrounding various topics that help participants to grow in diversity. Stereotypes can be defined as, &quot;believing unfairly that all people or things with a specific characteristic are the same.&quot; Stereotypes often reveal themselves in quick judgments based solely off of visible characteristics. These judgments move into a biased opinion when you believe that these judgments are always true. These stereotypes can be harmful to both personal relationships and relationships within the workplace. Community service helps people to realize that everyone does not fall into these preconceived ideas.

Along with breaking down stereotypes, community service work can assist people in realizing that those they are helping and working with are no different from themselves. This realization can lead to empathizing with others. Learning to understand the needs and motivations of others, especially those who live different lives from our own, is an important part of living a productive life. This leads to a view of humanity that can help a person stay free of biased opinions of others and can lead to a more diverse and ultimately more productive and thought-provoking life.

Volunteer work that&#x27;s relevant to the job position can be added as work experience in resume. According to U.S. News &amp; World Report, &quot;If volunteer work is relevant to the job position, it may want include it under the professional or work experience sections on resume.&quot; This depends on working term as a volunteer. If the term were more than 2 years, it&#x27;s not worthwhile to list community service as work experience.

== Choosing the right strategy ==
Civilians have a desire and aptitude to organize themselves apart from the government to address the needs in their communities. However, making sure an effort has a positive effect on society requires clear analysis and a strategy. The analysis identifies the root causes of problems that project implementation must address. Individuals, like neighborhoods, enjoy permanent change only if it is an inner one—and the greatest form of community service is encouraging that inner change.

Abraham Kuyper advocates &quot;sphere sovereignty&quot;, which honors the independence and autonomy of the &quot;intermediate bodies&quot; in society, such as schools, press, business, and the arts. He champions the right of every community to operate its own organizations and manage its own groups, with the foundational belief that parents know what their child really needs, and that local people are more capable of helping fellow locals. Those who agree with his views perceive community service as a tool of empowerment that can help people achieve better employment and lifestyle, avoiding what they see as destructive decision-making for mal-established goals by poorly developed community service efforts.

Amy L. Sherman, in her book &quot;Restorers of Hope&quot;, suggests that community service planning should be made with the valuable opinion of the local residents, since they have firsthand knowledge of the inside realities of their community&#x27;s current state. Making them a part of the movement, change or project creates in the members of the community a sense of belonging and hope.

A joint study suggests that a more effective approach to community service focuses on increased participation of local people in decision-making and collaborative partnerships. The goal is &quot;a bottom-up approach in which participants become agents of change and decision making.&quot; This is accomplished through several principles: inclusion, equal partnership, transparency, sharing power, sharing responsibility, empowerment, and cooperation. Being cognizant of who is given a voice in defining the need for community service, and the ways in which these issues are approached, is one of the first steps in recognizing spaces in which participation can be increased.

<doc id="586836" wikidata="Q44320" url="?curid=586836" title="Thriller (album)">
<text>Thriller is the sixth studio album by the American singer and songwriter Michael Jackson, released on November 29, 1982, by Epic Records. It was produced by Quincy Jones, who previously worked with Jackson on his album &quot;Off the Wall&quot; (1979). With the ongoing backlash against disco music at the time, he moved in a new musical direction, resulting in a mix of pop, post-disco, rock, funk, synth-pop, and R&amp;B sounds, and darker themes; Jackson wanted to create an album where &quot;every song was a killer&quot;. Paul McCartney is the first credited appearance of a featured artist on a Jackson album. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with a budget of $750,000.

Upon its release, &quot;Thriller&quot; was lauded by critics. It was Jackson&#x27;s first number-one album on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart, where it spent a record 37 non-consecutive weeks at number one, from February 26, 1983, to April 14, 1984. Seven singles were released: &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;Wanna Be Startin&#x27; Somethin&#x27;, &quot;Human Nature&quot;, &quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)&quot;, and &quot;Thriller&quot;. They all reached the top 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, setting a record for the most top 10 singles from an album, with &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Billie Jean&quot; reaching number one. Following Jackson&#x27;s performance of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; in the &quot;Motown 25&quot; television special, where he debuted his signature moonwalk dance, the album began selling one million copies per week. Sales doubled after the release of the &quot;Thriller&quot; music video on MTV in December 1983.

By 1984, &quot;Thriller&quot; had sold 32 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album of all time. It was the best-selling album of 1983 worldwide, and in 1984 became the first to become the best-selling in the United States for two years. It set industry standards, with its songs, music videos, and promotional strategies influencing artists, record labels, producers, marketers and choreographers. The success gave Jackson an unprecedented level of cultural significance for a black American, breaking racial barriers in popular music, earning him regular airplay on MTV and leading to a meeting with US President Ronald Reagan at the White House. &quot;Thriller&quot; was among the first albums to use music videos as promotional tools; the videos for &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot; are credited for transforming music videos into a serious art form.

&quot;Thriller&quot; remains the best-selling album of all time, having sold an estimated 70 million copies worldwide. It is the best selling non-compilation album and second-best-selling album overall in the United States, and was certified 34× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2021. &quot;Thriller&quot; is frequently included in lists of the greatest albums of all time and continues to be recognized as an important event in American culture. It won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards at the 1984 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for &quot;Beat It&quot;. Jackson also won a record-breaking eight American Music Awards at the 1984 American Music Awards, including the Merit. In 2008, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and the Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry of &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant recordings&quot;.

== Background ==
Jackson&#x27;s previous album &quot;Off the Wall&quot; (1979) received critical acclaim and was a commercial success, having sold 10 million copies at the time. The years between &quot;Off the Wall&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot; were a transitional period for Jackson, a time of increased independence. The period saw him become deeply unhappy; Jackson said, &quot;Even at home, I&#x27;m lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It&#x27;s so hard to make friends ... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home.&quot;

When Jackson turned 21 in August 1979, he hired John Branca as his manager. Jackson told Branca that he wanted to be the biggest and wealthiest star in showbusiness. He was upset about what he perceived as the underperformance of &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, feeling it had deserved the Grammy Award for Record of the Year. He also felt undervalued by the music industry; in 1980, when &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; declined to run a cover story on him, Jackson responded: &quot;I&#x27;ve been told over and over that black people on the cover of magazines doesn&#x27;t sell copies ... Just wait. Some day those magazines are going to be begging me for an interview. Maybe I&#x27;ll give them one, and maybe I won&#x27;t.&quot;

For his next album, Jackson wanted to create an album where &quot;every song was a killer&quot;. He was frustrated by albums that would have &quot;one good song, and the rest were like B-sides ... Why can&#x27;t every one be like a hit song? Why can&#x27;t every song be so great that people would want to buy it if you could release it as a single? ... That was my purpose for the next album.&quot;

== Production and composition ==
=== Recording ===

Jackson reunited with &quot;Off the Wall&quot; producer Quincy Jones to record his sixth studio album, his second under the Epic label. They worked together on 30 songs, nine of which were included on the album. &quot;Thriller&quot; was recorded at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with a production budget of $750,000 (US$ in dollars). The recording commenced on April 14, 1982, at noon with Jackson and Paul McCartney recording &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;; it was completed on the final day of mixing, November 8, 1982. Several members of the band Toto were involved in the album&#x27;s recording and production. Jackson wrote four songs for the record: &quot;Wanna Be Startin&#x27; Somethin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;, &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Billie Jean&quot;. Unlike many artists, Jackson did not write these songs on paper. Instead, he dictated into a sound recorder; when recording he would sing from memory.

The relationship between Jackson and Jones became strained during the recording. Jackson spent much of his time rehearsing dance steps alone. When the album was completed, both Jones and Jackson were unhappy with the result and remixed every song, spending a week on each.

&quot;Billie Jean&quot; was personal to Jackson, who struggled with obsessed fans. Jones wanted to shorten the long introduction, but Jackson insisted that it remain because it made him want to dance. The ongoing backlash against disco made it necessary to move in a different musical direction from the disco-heavy &quot;Off the Wall&quot;. Jones and Jackson were determined to make a rock song that would appeal to all tastes and spent weeks looking for a suitable guitarist for the song &quot;Beat It&quot;. Eventually, they found Steve Lukather of Toto to play the rhythm guitar parts and Eddie Van Halen of the rock band Van Halen to play the solo.

When Rod Temperton wrote the song &quot;Thriller&quot;, he wanted to call it &quot;Starlight&quot; or &quot;Midnight Man&quot;, but settled on &quot;Thriller&quot; because he felt the name had merchandising potential. Wanting a notable person to recite the closing lyrics, Jones brought in actor Vincent Price, an acquaintance of Jones&#x27; wife; Price completed his part in two takes. Temperton wrote the spoken portion in a taxi on the way to the recording studio. Jones and Temperton said that some recordings were left off the album because they did not have the &quot;edginess&quot; of other album tracks. A cover of &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;, originally by the Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra, was omitted when the parties could not agree on royalties.

=== Music and lyrics ===
&quot;Thriller&quot; explores genres including post-disco, funk, pop, synth-pop, R&amp;B, and rock. According to Steve Huey of AllMusic, it refined the strengths of &quot;Off the Wall&quot;; the dance and rock tracks are more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads are softer and more soulful. The album includes the ballads &quot;Human Nature&quot;, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; and &quot;The Lady in My Life&quot;, the funk tracks &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Wanna Be Startin&#x27; Something&#x27;&quot;, and the disco songs &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot; and &quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)&quot;.

&quot;Wanna Be Startin&#x27; Somethin&#x27;&quot; climaxes in an African-inspired chant (often misidentified as Swahili, but actually syllables based on Duala), giving the song an international flavor. &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; tells of two friends&#x27; fight over a woman, arguing over who loves her more, and concludes with a rap. The album&#x27;s songs have a tempo ranging from 80 beats per minute on &quot;The Girl is Mine&quot;, to 138 on &quot;Beat It&quot;.

&quot;Thriller&quot; foreshadows the contradictory themes of Jackson&#x27;s later works. With &quot;Thriller&quot;, Jackson began using a motif of paranoia and darker themes including supernatural imagery in the title track. This is evident on the songs &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Wanna Be Startin&#x27; Somethin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;. In &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, Jackson sings about an obsessive fan who alleges he fathered her child; in &quot;Wanna Be Startin&#x27; Somethin&#x27;&quot; he argues against media gossip. For &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, Jones had Jackson sing overdubs through a six-foot (180 cm) cardboard tube and brought in jazz saxophonist Tom Scott to play the lyricon, a wind-controlled synthesizer. Bassist Louis Johnson ran through his part on a Yamaha bass guitar. The song opens with a long bass-and-drums introduction. &quot;Thriller&quot; includes sound effects such as creaking doors, thunder, footsteps, wind, and howling dogs.

The anti-gang-violence &quot;Beat It&quot; became an homage to &quot;West Side Story&quot; and was Jackson&#x27;s first successful rock cross-over piece. Jackson later said of &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;the point is no one has to be the tough guy, you can walk away from a fight and still be a man. You don&#x27;t have to die to prove you&#x27;re a man&quot;. &quot;Human Nature&quot;, co-written by Steve Porcaro of the band Toto, is moody and introspective, as conveyed in lyrics such as, &quot;Looking out, across the morning, the City&#x27;s heart begins to beat, reaching out, I touch her shoulder, I&#x27;m dreaming of the street&quot;.

By the late 1970s, Jackson&#x27;s abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; AllMusic described him as a &quot;blindingly gifted vocalist&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Stephen Holden likened his vocals to the &quot;breathless, dreamy stutter&quot; of Stevie Wonder, and wrote that &quot;Jackson&#x27;s feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling falsetto that&#x27;s used very daringly.&quot; With the release of &quot;Thriller&quot;, Jackson could sing low—down to a basso low C—but he preferred to sing higher because pop tenors have more range to create style. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Christopher Connelly wrote that Jackson was now singing in a &quot;fully adult voice&quot; that was &quot;tinged by sadness&quot;.

&quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)&quot;, credited to James Ingram and Quincy Jones, and &quot;The Lady in My Life&quot; by Rod Temperton, gave the album a stronger R&amp;B direction; the latter song was described as &quot;the closest Jackson has come to crooning a sexy, soulful ballad after his Motown years&quot; by J. Randy Taraborrelli. Jackson had already adopted a &quot;vocal hiccup&quot; (first used in 1973 on &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late to Change the Time&quot;), which he continued to implement in &quot;Thriller&quot;. The purpose of the hiccup—somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping—is to evoke emotion, be it excitement, sadness, or fear.

=== Cover ===
The cover for &quot;Thriller&quot; features Jackson in a white suit that belonged to photographer Dick Zimmerman. The gatefold sleeve reveals a tiger cub at Jackson&#x27;s leg, which, according to Zimmerman, Jackson kept away from his face, fearing he would be scratched. Another picture from the shoot, with Jackson embracing the cub, was used for the 2001 special edition of &quot;Thriller&quot;.

== Release and commercial reception ==
&quot;Thriller&quot; was released on November 29, 1982, through Epic Records and internationally by CBS Records. It reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart on February 26, 1983. &quot;Thriller&quot; sold one million copies worldwide per week at its peak. &quot;Thriller&quot; was the best-selling album in the United States in 1983 and 1984, making it the first album to be the best-selling for two years. It also spent a record 37 weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, from February 26, 1983, to April 14, 1984, and has remained on the chart for 626 nonconsecutive weeks (and counting).

&quot;Thriller&quot; was Jackson&#x27;s global breakthrough, topping the charts in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It has gained Diamond certifications in Argentina, Canada, Denmark, France, Mexico and the UK. &quot;Thriller&quot; sells an estimated 130,000 copies in the US per year; it reached number two in the US Catalog charts in February 2003 and number 39 in the UK in March 2007. It is the sixth-best-selling album in the UK.

On December 16, 2015, &quot;Thriller&quot; became the first album to be certified 30× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of at least 30 million units in the US. Following the inclusion of streaming and tracks sales into the RIAA album awards in 2017, &quot;Thriller&quot; was certified 33× platinum, representing 33 million album-equivalent units. As of August 2021, the album has been certified 34× platinum in the US, denoting 34 million album-equivalent units. By the end of 1983, &quot;Thriller&quot; became the world&#x27;s best-selling album, having sold 32 million copies. By the end of the decade, &quot;Thriller&quot; had sold 48 million copies. It remains the best-selling album of all time, having sold over 70 million copies worldwide.

=== Singles ===
Seven singles were released from &quot;Thriller&quot;. The first, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;, was criticized as a poor choice; critics predicted that the album would disappoint and suggested that Jackson was bowing to a white audience. &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Black Singles chart, reached number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached number 1 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.

&quot;Billie Jean&quot; was released on January 2, 1983. It reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, where it remained for seven weeks. It also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Black Singles chart within three weeks, and it remained at number 1 for nine weeks. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1983. It topped the charts in 9 countries and reached the top 10 in many others. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was one of the best-selling singles of 1983, helping &quot;Thriller&quot; become the best-selling album of all time. It also became Jackson&#x27;s best-selling solo single. &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was described as a pioneer of &quot;sleek, post-soul pop music&quot; and also the beginning of a more paranoid lyrical style for Jackson, a trademark of his later music.

The third single, &quot;Beat It&quot;, also reached number one on the Black Singles chart. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it number five for 1983. &quot;Beat It&quot; reached number one in Spain and the Netherlands. &quot;Wanna Be Startin&#x27; Somethin&quot; was Jackson&#x27;s fourth consecutive top-ten single from &quot;Thriller&quot; on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 5. &quot;Human Nature&quot; reached number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. &quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)&quot; charted at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

&quot;Thriller&quot;, the final single, was released on November 2, 1983. It was not initially planned for release, as Epic saw it as a novelty song; according to executive Walter Yetnikoff, &quot;Who wants a single about monsters?&quot; By mid-1983, when sales of &quot;Thriller&quot; began to decline, Jackson convinced Epic to release &quot;Thriller&quot;, backed by a new music video. It reached number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Black Singles chart.

=== Music videos ===

The &quot;Billie Jean&quot; music video debuted on March 10, 1983, on MTV. It brought MTV—until then a fairly new and unknown music channel—to mainstream attention. It was one of the first videos by a black artist to be aired regularly by the channel, as the network&#x27;s executives felt black music was not &quot;rock&quot; enough. Directed by Steve Barron, the video shows a photographer who follows Jackson. The paparazzo never catches him, and when photographed Jackson fails to materialize on the developed picture. He dances to Billie Jean&#x27;s hotel room and as he walks along a sidewalk, each tile lights up at his touch.

The &quot;Beat It&quot; music video had its premiere on MTV during primetime on March 31, 1983. To add authenticity to the production but also to foster peace between them, Jackson had the idea to cast members of rival Los Angeles street gangs the Crips and the Bloods, and included around 80 genuine gang members. Its plot is Jackson bringing two gangsters together through the power of music and dance. It is also notable for its &quot;mass choreography&quot; of synchronized dancers, which would become the hallmark of Jackson&#x27;s music videos.

The &quot;Thriller&quot; music video premiered on MTV on December 2, 1983. In the video, Jackson and his girlfriend (played by Ola Ray) are confronted by zombies while walking home from a movie theater; Jackson becomes a zombie and performs a dance routine with a horde of the undead. It was named the greatest video of all time by MTV in 1999, by VH1 in 2001, and by &quot;Time&quot; in 2011. In 2009, it became the first music video to be selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. The Library described it as &quot;the most famous music video of all time&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Thriller&quot; was widely acclaimed by critics, further strengthening Jackson&#x27;s position in popular music. In a contemporaneous review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Christopher Connelly called &quot;Thriller&quot; &quot;a zesty LP&quot; with a &quot;harrowing, dark message&quot;. He compared the songs on the album with the life challenges that the 24-year-old Jackson had faced since &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, while observing that he &quot;dropped the boyish falsetto&quot; and was facing his &quot;challenges head-on&quot; with &quot;a feisty determination&quot; and &quot;a full, adult voice&quot;. Connelly emphasized Jackson&#x27;s musical progression from &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, writing, &quot;Jackson&#x27;s new attitude gives &quot;Thriller&quot; a deeper, if less visceral, emotional urgency than any of his previous work, and marks another watershed in the creative development of this prodigiously talented performer.&quot;

John Rockwell wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that perhaps Jackson was a &quot;sometimes too practiced ... performer&quot;, that at times Quincy Jones may &quot;depersonalize his individuality&quot; with his &quot;slightly anonymous production&quot;, and that Jackson may be hiding his true emotions behind &quot;layers of impenetrable, gauzy veils&quot;. Rockwell nonetheless deemed &quot;Thriller&quot; &quot;a wonderful pop record, the latest statement by one of the great singers in popular music today&quot; and that there are &quot;hits here, too, lots of them&quot;. Rockwell believed it helped breach &quot;the destructive barriers that spring up regularly between white and black music&quot;, especially as &quot;white publications and radio stations that normally avoid &quot;black music&quot; seem willing to pretend he isn&#x27;t black after all&quot;. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau said &quot;this is virtually a hits-plus-filler job, but at such a high level it&#x27;s almost classic anyway&quot;. He later wrote in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot; (1990), &quot;what we couldn&#x27;t know is how brilliantly every hit but &#x27;P.Y.T.&#x27; would thrive on mass exposure and public pleasure.&quot;

A year after the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Time&quot; summed up the three main singles from the album, saying, &quot;The pulse of America and much of the rest of the world moves irregularly, beating in time to the tough strut of &#x27;Billie Jean&#x27;, the asphalt aria of &#x27;Beat It&#x27;, the supremely cool chills of &#x27;Thriller&#x27;.&quot; In 1989, &quot;Toronto Star&quot; music critics reflected on the albums they had reviewed in the past ten years in order to create a list judging them on the basis of &quot;commercial impact to social import, to strictly musical merit.&quot; &quot;Thriller&quot; was placed at number 1 on the list, where it was referred to as his &quot;master work&quot; and that &quot;commercial success has since overshadowed Jackson&#x27;s artistic accomplishments on &quot;Thriller&quot;, and that&#x27;s a pity. It was a record for the times, brimming with breathless anticipation and a dread fear of the adult world, a brilliant fantasy that pumped with sexual heat, yet made room for serious reflection&quot;.

=== Awards ===
&quot;Thriller&quot; topped &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop poll of 1983. Jackson was nominated for a record 12 Grammy Awards at the 26th Grammy Awards. The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. Jackson won seven of the Grammy Awards for the album, while the eighth Grammy Award went to Bruce Swedien. Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the ceremony as &#x27;The Michael Jackson Show&#x27;, writing &quot;it was exactly the kind of one-man show that everyone had anticipated&quot;. In winning the Album of the Year award, Jackson became the third-youngest to win the award after Barbra Streisand at 22 and Stevie Wonder at 23. That same year, Jackson won eight American Music Awards, including the American Music Award of Merit, and three MTV Video Music Awards. &quot;Thriller&quot; was recognized as the best-selling album of all time on February 7, 1984, when it was inducted into the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;.

=== Rankings ===
In 1992, &quot;Thriller&quot; was awarded the Special &quot;Billboard&quot; Award to commemorate its 10th anniversary. In 2000, it was voted number 64 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. It was also ranked number 2 in the Soul/R&amp;B – All Time Top 50 albums. The book states; it is the finest example of perfect disco-pop, and a record that should be prescribed to musical snobs and manic depressives. At the 2002 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, as a sign of the album&#x27;s longevity, &quot;Thriller&quot; was awarded a second Special &quot;Billboard&quot; Award as a recognition for spending more weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 than any other album in history. In 2003, it was ranked at number 20 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, maintaining the ranking in a 2012 revised list — it&#x27;s the highest ranked pop album on both lists. In a 2020 updated list by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot; was ranked number 12. It was ranked by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM), in conjunction with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, at number three on its list of the Definitive 200 Albums of All Time. &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Billie Jean&quot; were both included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; included &quot;Thriller&quot; in its list of the All-TIME 100 Albums. In 2008, 25 years after its release, the record was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and, a few weeks later, was among 25 recordings preserved by the Library of Congress to the National Recording Registry as &quot;culturally significant&quot;. In 2009, music critics for MTV Base and VH1 both listed &quot;Thriller&quot; as the best album released since 1981. &quot;Thriller&quot;, along with other critic favorites, were then polled by the public. 40,000 people found &quot;Thriller&quot; to be the Best Album of all time by MTV Generation, gaining a third of all votes. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;Thriller&quot; as the best album of the 1980s. &quot;Thriller&quot; was ranked third on the Greatest of All Time &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Albums. &quot;Billboard&quot; also ranked the album fourth on its list of All 92 Diamond-Certified Albums Ranked from Worst to Best: Critic&#x27;s Take. In 2018, &quot;The Independent&quot; named &quot;Thriller&quot; the &quot;most inspiring album of all time&quot;.

== Legacy and influence ==
=== Music industry ===

Following the release of &quot;Thriller&quot;, Jackson&#x27;s immediate success led to him having a standing of cultural significance that was not attained by an African American before him in the history of the entertainment industry. &quot;Blender&quot; described Jackson as the &quot;late 20th century&#x27;s preeminent pop icon&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the opinion that he was a &quot;musical phenomenon&quot; and that &quot;in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; hailed &quot;Thriller&quot; as &quot;the greatest pop album of all time&quot;. Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately $2 (US$ in dollars) for each album sold.

As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, &quot;The Making of Michael Jackson&#x27;s Thriller&quot;, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, &quot;Thriller&quot; raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed preconceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of $12 (US$ in dollars). &quot;Thriller&quot; retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, &quot;At some point, &quot;Thriller&quot; stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple&quot;.

&quot;Thriller&quot; was released at around the peak of the album era, which had positioned full-length records ahead of singles as the dominant form of recorded-music consumption and artistic expression in the industry. The success of &quot;Thriller&quot;″s singles, however, marked a brief resurgence in the sales of the format. At the time of the album&#x27;s release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&amp;M Records, read that, &quot;The whole industry has a stake in this success&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine speculated that &quot;the fallout from &quot;Thriller&quot; has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of $4.1 billion&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; summed up &quot;Thriller&quot;″s impact as a &quot;restoration of confidence&quot; for an industry bordering on &quot;the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop&quot;. The publication described Jackson&#x27;s influence at that point as, &quot;Star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too&quot;.

When &quot;Thriller&quot; and &quot;Billie Jean&quot; were searching to reach their market demographic, MTV and cable TV had a smaller market share than the much larger reach of broadcast television stations in the United States. A national broadcast TV audience on ABC, NBC and CBS affiliate stations, as well as major independent TV stations, was desired by CBS/Epic Records to promote &quot;Thriller&quot;. The national broadcast TV premiere of the &quot;Thriller&quot; album&#x27;s first video, &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, was during the week of Halloween in October 1984 and was the idea of Video Concert Hall executive producers Charles Henderson and Jerry Crowe. Video Concert Hall, the first nationwide music video TV network, taped the one-hour special in Hollywood and Atlanta, where the TV studios of Video Concert Hall were located. The &quot;Thriller&quot; TV special was hosted by &quot;Thriller&quot; video co-star Vincent Price, distributed by Henderson-Crowe Syndications, Inc. and aired in the top 20 TV markets and much of the United States, including TV stations WNEW (New York), WFLD (Chicago), KTTV (Los Angeles), WPLG (Miami), WQTV (Boston) and WXIA (Atlanta), for a total of 150 TV stations.

&quot;Thriller&quot; had a pioneering impact on black-music genres and crossover. According to ethnomusicologist Miles White, the album completely defined the &quot;sound of post-disco contemporary R&amp;B&quot; and &quot;updated the crossover aesthetic that had been the holy grail of black popular music since Louis Jordan in the 1940s&quot;. Noting its unprecedented dominance of mainstream pop music by an African-American artist, White goes on to write that &quot;the record&#x27;s song selection and sound aesthetics played to soul and pop sensibilities alike, appealing to a broad audience and selling across lines of race, gender, class and generation&quot;, while demonstrating Jackson&#x27;s emergence from Motown as &quot;the king of pop-soul crossover&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Simon Vozick-Levinson has considered it &quot;the greatest pop-soul album&quot;, Included in their list of The 40 Most Groundbreaking Albums of All Time, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine the present-day musical landscape without &quot;Thriller&quot;, which changed the game both sonically and marketwise. The album&#x27;s nervy, outsized blend of pop, rock and soul would send seismic waves throughout radio, inviting both marquee crossovers (like Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s guitar solo on &quot;Beat It&quot;) and sneakier attempts at genre-meshing. The album&#x27;s splashy, cinematic videos — from the John Landis-directed short film that promoted &quot;Thriller&quot; to the &quot;West Side Story&quot; homage accompanying &quot;Beat It&quot; — legitimized the still-nascent form and forced MTV to incorporate black artists into its playlists. Its promotional strategy, which led to seven of its nine tracks being released as singles, raised the bar for what, exactly, constituted a &quot;hit-laden&quot; LP. Beyond breaking ground, it broke records, showing just how far pop could reach: the biggest selling album of all time, the first album to win eight Grammys in a single night and the first album to stay in the Top 10 charts for a year.&quot;

Epic Records also reflected on the importance of the album: &quot;More than just an album, &quot;Thriller&quot; has remained a global cultural multi-media phenomenon for both the 20th and the 21st centuries, smashing musical barriers and changing the frontiers of pop forever. The music on &quot;Thriller&quot; is so dynamic and singular that it defied any definition of rock, pop or soul that had gone before.&quot;

From the moment &quot;Thriller&quot; was released, it set the standard for the music industry: artists, record labels, producers, marketers and even choreographers. The music video was ahead of its time and it is considered a monumental one—not only in Jackson&#x27;s career, but also in the history of pop music. Epic Records&#x27; approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to the mass market ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and release their songs. John Landis&#x27; production of a mini-movie, rather than the usual short music video, would raise the bar for other directors and producers.

=== Music videos and racial equality ===

Before the success of &quot;Thriller&quot;, many felt Jackson had struggled to get MTV airtime due to being black. CBS Records president Walter Yetnikoff told MTV: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to give you any more videos and I&#x27;m going to go public and fucking tell them about the fact you don&#x27;t want to play music by a black guy.&quot; Yetnikoff persuaded MTV to begin airing &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Beat It&quot;, which led to a long partnership and helped other black artists to gain mainstream recognition. MTV denies claims of racism in their broadcasting.

The popularity of Jackson&#x27;s videos, such as &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, helped popularize MTV, and its focus shifted towards pop and R&amp;B. Jackson transformed the medium of music video into an artform and promotional tool through the use of complex storylines, dance routines, special effects, and celebrity cameos.

When the 14-minute-long &quot;Thriller&quot; video aired, MTV ran it twice an hour to meet demand. The video marked an increase in scale for music videos and has been routinely named the best music video ever. The video is credited for transforming music videos into a serious artform, breaking down racial barriers in popular entertainment, and popularizing the making-of documentary format. Many elements have had a lasting impact on popular culture such as the zombie dance and Jackson&#x27;s red jacket designed by Landis&#x27;s wife Deborah Nadoolman.

Author, music critic and journalist Nelson George wrote in 2004, &quot;It&#x27;s difficult to hear the songs from &quot;Thriller&quot; and disengage them from the videos. For most of us the images define the songs. In fact it could be argued that Michael is the first artist of the MTV age to have an entire album so intimately connected in the public imagination with its imagery&quot;. Short films like &quot;Thriller&quot; largely remained unique to Jackson, while the group dance sequence in &quot;Beat It&quot; has been frequently imitated. The choreography in &quot;Thriller&quot; has become a part of global pop culture, replicated everywhere from Bollywood to prisons in the Philippines.

Jackson&#x27;s success as a black artist was unprecedented. &quot;Time&quot; wrote in 1984: &quot;Jackson is the biggest thing since the Beatles. He is the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley. He just may be the most popular black singer ever.&quot; According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot; paved the way for other African-American artists to achieve mainstream recognition, such as Prince. Christgau credited &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; for giving radio exposure to the idea of interracial love.

=== Reappraisal ===
&quot;Thriller&quot; has continued to receive critical acclaim. In 2024, Andrew R. Chow wrote in &quot;Time&quot; that &quot;Thriller&quot; is &quot;a towering pillar of American culture&quot; and &quot;the gold standard to which all pop artists aspire in its beloved omnipresence&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that it had something to interest everyone. He believed it showcased harder funk and hard rock while remaining &quot;undeniably fun&quot;, and wrote that &quot;Wanna Be Startin&#x27; Somethin&#x27;&quot;, was &quot;the freshest funk on the album [but] the most claustrophobic, scariest track Jackson ever recorded.&quot; Erlewine felt it was an improvement on Jackson&#x27;s previous album, although he was critical of the title track, describing it as &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;sucked out the momentum&quot; of the record. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Jon Pareles wrote that Jackson had &quot;doubled his ambitions and multiplied his audience ... &quot;Thriller&quot; had extra musical help in becoming the best-selling non compilation album of all time: Jackson&#x27;s dancing feet and dazzling stage presence, amplified by the newfound promotional reach of music video and the Reagan era&#x27;s embrace of glossy celebrity. But especially in the album&#x27;s seven hit singles (out of nine songs), the music stands on its own.&quot; Culture critic Nelson George wrote that Jackson &quot;has educated R. Kelly, Usher, Justin Timberlake and countless others with &quot;Thriller&quot; as a textbook&quot;.

== Reissues and catalog sales ==
&quot;Thriller&quot; was reissued on October 16, 2001, in an expanded set, &quot;Thriller: Special Edition&quot;. The album is remastered and includes a new booklet and bonus material, including the songs &quot;Someone in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot; and Jackson&#x27;s original &quot;Billie Jean&quot; demo, as well as audio interviews with Jones and Temperton. Sony also hired sound engineer and mixer Mick Guzauski to create 5.1-channel surround sound mixes of &quot;Thriller&quot; and Jackson&#x27;s other albums for the Super Audio CD format, but Jackson did not approve the mixes. Consequently, &quot;Thriller&quot; was issued on SACD only in a stereo version. A surround sound version of &quot;Thriller&quot; would not be realized until November 2022, when Sony created and released 360 Reality Audio and Dolby Atmos mixes of &quot;Thriller&quot; for Amazon Music and Apple Music respectively in honor of the album&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

In February 2008, Epic Records released &quot;Thriller 25&quot;; Jackson served as executive producer. &quot;Thriller 25&quot; appeared on CD, USB and vinyl with seven bonus tracks, the new song &quot;For All Time&quot;, a snippet of Price&#x27;s voiceover and five remixes featuring American artists Fergie, will.i.am, Kanye West and Akon. It also included a DVD featuring three music videos, the &quot;Motown 25&quot; &quot;Billie Jean&quot; performance and a booklet with a message from Jackson. The ballad &quot;For All Time&quot; supposedly dates from 1982, but is often credited as being from the &quot;Dangerous&quot; sessions.

&quot;Thriller 25&quot; was a commercial success and did particularly well as a reissue. It peaked at number one in eight countries and Europe. It peaked at number two in the US, number three in the UK and reached the top 10 in over 30 national charts. It was certified Gold in 11 countries including the UK, received a 2× Gold certification in France and received platinum certification in Poland. In the United States, &quot;Thriller 25&quot; was the second-best-selling album of its release week, selling one hundred and sixty six thousand copies, just fourteen thousand short of reaching the number one position. It was ineligible for the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart as a re-release but entered the Pop Catalog Charts at number one (where it stayed for ten non-consecutive weeks), with the best sales on that chart since December 1996. With the arrival of Halloween, &quot;Thriller 25&quot; spent an eleventh non-consecutive week atop the US catalog chart. This brought US sales of the album to 688,000 copies, making it the best-selling catalog album of 2008. This was Jackson&#x27;s best launch since &quot;Invincible&quot; in 2001, selling three million copies worldwide in 12 weeks.

After Jackson&#x27;s death in June 2009, &quot;Thriller&quot; set additional records. the album sold 101,000 units in the US on the chart week ending July 1, 2009 and was the third biggest-selling album of the week. The album placed at number three on the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart. The following week the album sold 187,000 units in the US on the chart week ending July 8, 2009 and was the second biggest-selling album of the week. Songs from &quot;Thriller&quot; also helped Jackson become the first artist to sell more than one million song downloads in a week. According to Nielsen SoundScan, &quot;Thriller&quot; was the 14th best-selling album of 2009 in the United States, with 1.27 million copies sold.

For one week beginning November 20, 2015, Google Play Music offered an exclusive free copy of the album to its users in the US which included the 1981 demo of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; as an additional track. On November 18, 2022, Sony Music released &quot;Thriller 40&quot;, a 40th-anniversary reissue of &quot;Thriller&quot; including a bonus disc containing outtakes from the original recording sessions. The 2022 reissue was followed by a 2023 documentary.

<text>Munjeong-dong Rodeo Street () is a major outlet shopping center in Seoul, South Korea. Clothing of many types is found here, some at substantially discounted rates. Most of the major Korean labels have stores here, as do many international brands.

Due to lack of available streetside space, many stores are located on the basement, 2nd and 3rd floors. One may pick up a map with store locations at the tourist office located on the main street.

This area is accessible from Exit 1 of Munjeong station, a station on Line 8 of the Seoul Subway.

<text>Terrain (from &#x27;earth&#x27;), alternatively relief or topographical relief, is the dimension and shape of a given surface of land. In physical geography, terrain is the lay of the land. This is usually expressed in terms of the elevation, slope, and orientation of terrain features. Terrain affects surface water flow and distribution. Over a large area, it can affect weather and climate patterns. Bathymetry is the study of underwater relief, while hypsometry studies terrain relative to sea level.

== Importance ==
The understanding of terrain is critical for many reasons: 
* The terrain of a region largely determines its suitability for human settlement: flatter alluvial plains tend to have better farming soils than steeper, rockier uplands.
* In terms of environmental quality, agriculture, hydrology and other interdisciplinary sciences; understanding the terrain of an area assists the understanding of watershed boundaries, drainage characteristics, drainage systems, groundwater systems, water movement, and impacts on water quality. Complex arrays of relief data are used as input parameters for hydrology transport models (such as the Storm Water Management Model or DSSAM Models) to allow prediction of river water quality. 
* Understanding terrain also supports soil conservation, especially in agriculture. Contour ploughing is an established practice enabling sustainable agriculture on sloping land; it is the practice of ploughing along lines of equal elevation instead of up and down a slope.
* Terrain is militarily critical because it determines the ability of armed forces to take and hold areas, and move troops and material into and through areas. An understanding of terrain is basic to both defensive and offensive strategy. The military usage of &quot;terrain&quot; is very broad, encompassing not only landform but land use and land cover, surface transport infrastructure, built structures and human geography, and, by extension under the term human terrain, even psychological, cultural, or economic factors.

* Terrain is important in determining weather patterns. Two areas geographically close to each other may differ radically in precipitation levels or timing because of elevation differences or a rain shadow effect.
* Precise knowledge of terrain is vital in aviation, especially for low-flying routes and maneuvers (see terrain collision avoidance) and airport altitudes. Terrain will also affect range and performance of radars and terrestrial radio navigation systems. Furthermore, a hilly or mountainous terrain can strongly impact the implementation of a new aerodrome and the orientation of its runways.

== Relief ==
Relief (or &quot;local relief&quot;) refers specifically to the quantitative measurement of vertical elevation change in a landscape. It is the difference between maximum and minimum elevations within a given area, usually of limited extent. A relief can be described qualitatively, such as a &quot; or &quot; plain or upland. The relief of a landscape can change with the size of the area over which it is measured, making the definition of the scale over which it is measured very important. Because it is related to the slope of surfaces within the area of interest and to the gradient of any streams present, the relief of a landscape is a useful metric in the study of the Earth&#x27;s surface. Relief energy, which may be defined &quot;inter alia&quot; as &quot;the maximum height range in a regular grid&quot;, is essentially an indication of the ruggedness or relative height of the terrain.

== Geomorphology ==

Geomorphology is in large part the study of the formation of terrain or topography. Terrain is formed by concurrent processes operating on the underlying geological structures over geological time:
* Geological processes: migration of tectonic plates, faulting and folding, mountain formation, volcanic eruptions, etc.
* Erosional processes: glacial, water, wind, chemical and gravitational (mass movement); such as landslides, downhill creep, flows, slumps, and rock falls.
* Extraterrestrial: meteorite impacts.

Tectonic processes such as orogenies and uplifts cause land to be elevated, whereas erosional and weathering processes wear the land away by smoothing and reducing topographic features. The relationship of erosion and tectonics rarely (if ever) reaches equilibrium. These processes are also codependent, however the full range of their interactions is still a topic of debate.

Land surface parameters are quantitative measures of various morphometric properties of a surface. The most common examples are used to derive slope or aspect of a terrain or curvatures at each location. These measures can also be used to derive hydrological parameters that reflect flow/erosion processes. Climatic parameters are based on the modelling of solar radiation or air flow.

Land surface objects, or landforms, are definite physical objects (lines, points, areas) that differ from the surrounding objects. The most typical examples airlines of watersheds, stream patterns, ridges, break-lines, pools or borders of specific landforms.

<doc id="586840" wikidata="Q44142" url="?curid=586840" title="Bad (album)">
<text>Bad is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Michael Jackson. It was released on August 31, 1987, by Epic Records. Written and recorded between 1985 and 1987, &quot;Bad&quot; was Jackson&#x27;s third and final collaboration with the producer Quincy Jones. Jackson adopted a more aggressive sound for the album, departing from his signature groove-based style and falsetto. Primarily featuring pop, dance, and R&amp;B, as well as elements of funk, soul, jazz, rock, and hard rock, &quot;Bad&quot; incorporated new recording technology, including digital synthesizers. Jackson co-produced and composed all but two tracks, and the lyrical themes include self-improvement, romance, world peace, media bias, paranoia, and racial profiling. The album features appearances from Siedah Garrett and Stevie Wonder.

Prior to the release of &quot;Bad&quot;, Jackson&#x27;s new image drew much controversy, particularly in the US. Nine singles (and a promotional single, &quot;Speed Demon&quot;) were released to promote the album, including the record-breaking five US number ones, &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;, &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;, &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; and &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;, and the top-10 hit &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;. The film &quot;Moonwalker&quot; (1988), which included the music videos for several &quot;Bad&quot; songs, was used to promote the album. Jackson also embarked on his first solo world tour, performing 123 concerts across 15 countries for his Bad tour, attracting 4.4 million people as the tour grossed $125 million (equivalent to $ in ), making it the highest-grossing concert tour ever at the time.

Released nearly five years after Jackson&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982), anticipation for &quot;Bad&quot; was high. The album sold more than 2.25 million copies in its first week in the US as it reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart, and went on to be certified 11× platinum. It also reached number one in 24 other countries and was the best-selling album globally of both 1987 and 1988, being an enormous commercial success around the world. &quot;Bad&quot; received positive reviews, particularly for Jackson&#x27;s vocals and the rich, more polished production. It has since been acclaimed as a staple of 1980s popular music, solidifying Jackson&#x27;s status as a global superstar and being an extension of his influence on contemporary music.

&quot;Bad&quot; is one of the best-selling albums of all time having sold over 45 million copies worldwide. Numerous publications have ranked it in lists of the greatest albums of all time; some critics have noted aspects of the album, particularly the songwriting and pop sentiments, as being the best of Jackson&#x27;s career. The album was nominated for six Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. It won Best Engineered Recording – Non Classical and Best Music Video (for &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;). &quot;Bad&quot; won an American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Song. Jackson also received several special awards in recognition of the album&#x27;s success. In 2012, an expanded reissue album, &quot;Bad 25&quot;, and a documentary film also titled &quot;Bad 25&quot; were released to celebrate the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

== Background ==
By 1984, Jackson&#x27;s sixth solo album, &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982), had been certified 20× platinum for sales of 20 million copies in the United States alone. Jackson was considered the most powerful African American in the history of the entertainment industry, whose popularity was comparable only to Elvis Presley in the 1950s and the Beatles in the 1960s. The years following were marred by Jackson&#x27;s rifts with his family and the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, broken friendships with celebrities, and the pressure of celebrity. He spent 1985 out of the public eye, but remained in the press due to eccentric behavior, including the adoption of Bubbles the chimpanzee. Other rumors were false; this included the rumor that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric chamber.

According to some associates, Jackson was nervous about completing his next album. Ken Tucker of NPR Music claimed that there was almost no chance of Jackson&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Thriller&quot; selling as many records as &quot;Thriller&quot; did, and that the level of mass pop phenomenon experienced by Jackson during the &quot;Thriller&quot; era was unlikely to occur again. In 2017, &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote that following &quot;Thriller&quot; was &quot;like following up the Bible&quot;. Despite the doubts of Jackson ever matching the impact and commercial success that &quot;Thriller&quot; achieved, he aimed to sell 100 million copies with his next album.

The album&#x27;s title reference to the slang word, &quot;bad&quot;, signified Jackson&#x27;s departure from his previous boyish image to a more streetwise, mature persona. American dramatist Charles Fuller, who once met Jackson, commented that Jackson&#x27;s use of the word &quot;bad&quot; denotes to ‘great’ and also ‘tough’ and ‘courageous&#x27;. Jackson reinvented his image for the &quot;Bad&quot; era, wearing black, heavy buckle-designed clothing and metal-studded belts, which gave him a notably edgier look. However, Jackson&#x27;s widely publicized use of plastic surgery, as well his lighter skin complexion, resulted in much controversy—particularly amongst his American fans. 

== Production and recording ==
&quot;Bad&quot; was Jackson&#x27;s final collaboration with producer Quincy Jones, who had produced &quot;Off the Wall&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;. After Jackson had written a handful of the tracks on &quot;Off the Wall&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;, Jones encouraged him to write more for his followup. Jones recalled: &quot;All the turmoil [in Jackson&#x27;s life] was starting to mount up, so I said I thought it was time for him to do a very honest album.&quot;

Jackson wanted to move in a new musical direction, with a harder edge and fiercer sound. According to guitarist Steve Stevens, who featured on &quot;Bad&quot;, Jackson discussed about rock bands, including Mötley Crüe. Jackson was eager to find innovative sounds and was interested in new music technology; the production team made extensive use of new digital synthesizers, including FM synthesis and the Fairlight CMI and Synclavier PSMT synthesizers, sometimes combining synthesizers to create new sounds. Other instruments used during the recording include guitars, organs, drums, bass, percussion and saxophones, washboard and digital guitars. In Lily Rothman&#x27;s view of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, despite the task of matching &quot;Thriller&quot; being difficult, Jackson was more involved than ever in the artistic process of &quot;Bad&quot;.

Jackson began recording demos in November 1983 while recording &quot;Victory&quot; with his brothers, the Jacksons. He spent much of 1985 and 1986 writing and recording at his home studio in Encino, Los Angeles, with a group of musicians and engineers including Bill Bottrell known as the &quot;B team&quot;. The demos were brought to Westlake Studio to be finished by the &quot;A team&quot;, with Jones and engineer Bruce Swedien. Jones said the team would stay up for days on end when they &quot;were on a roll&quot;: &quot;They were carrying second engineers out on stretchers. I was smoking 180 cigarettes a day.&quot;

Work was disrupted in July 1984, when Jackson embarked on the Victory Tour with his brothers. Work resumed in January 1985 after Jackson had recorded his contributions to the charity single &quot;We Are the World&quot;. In mid-1985, work paused again so Jackson could prepare for Disney&#x27;s 4D film experience &quot;Captain EO&quot;, which featured an early version of the &quot;Bad&quot; song &quot;Another Part of Me&quot;. Work resumed in August and continued until November 1986, when Jackson filmed the &quot;Bad&quot; music video. Recording resumed in January 1987, and the album was completed in July. Jackson wrote a reported 60 songs, and recorded 30, wanting to release them all on a three-disc set. Jones suggested that the album be cut down to a ten-track single LP. Jackson is credited for writing all but two songs; other writing credits include Terry Britten and Graham Lyle for &quot;Just Good Friends&quot; and Siedah Garrett and Glen Ballard for &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;.

== Songs ==
=== &quot;Bad&quot; ===

&quot;Bad&quot; was recorded and written by Jackson in as late as October 1986. It features drums played by John Robinson who had previously worked with Jackson and Jones on &quot;Off the Wall&quot; (1979). According to Jackson, it was inspired by a true story that he had read about in a newspaper article about a boy who &#x27;was from the ghetto&#x27; and went up to a private school in Upstate New York. When he came back, his friends got so jealous of him that they killed him; Jackson stated that the student&#x27;s death was not included in the music video. Various Jackson biographers have concluded that the story he was referring was that of Edmund Perry. However, Perry was not killed by kids in his neighborhood; he was killed by a plainclothes police officer when Perry and his brother allegedly attacked and badly beat the officer in a mugging attempt.

&quot;Bad&quot; was originally planned as a duet between Jackson and Prince, after Jones suggested they record a song together. Prince said in 1997 that he declined because of reservations he had with the opening line of the song: &#x27;Your butt is mine&#x27;. He instead offered Jackson &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t You Love to Love Me&quot;, a song he wrote, but Jackson rejected it.

=== &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; ===

&quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; was developed by Jackson in 1985 under the working title &quot;Hot Fever&quot;. It was also solely written by him and co-produced with Jones. It features horn arrangements by Jerry Hey of Seawind and other members of the group who had worked on &quot;Off the Wall&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;.

=== &quot;Speed Demon&quot; ===

&quot;Speed Demon&quot; was written and co-produced by Jackson in 1986. According to Jones, Jackson wrote the song after he received a traffic ticket, which caused him to arrive late to the recording studio session. The song begins with a racing-car intro, which was proposed by Christopher Currell, who plays the synclaiver on the song; he is credited for the sound effects. Other musicians on the song include Greg Phillinganes on synthesizer and Paulinho da Costa on percussion.

=== &quot;Liberian Girl&quot; ===

Jackson wrote &quot;Liberian Girl&quot; as early as 1983 and it was originally set to be included on the Jacksons&#x27; 1984 album &quot;Victory&quot; until it was cut. Jackson then recorded the song for &quot;Bad&quot;. Jackson stated in a 1987 interview with Jet magazine, shortly after&quot; Bad&quot; was released, that the song came up to him while he was busy &quot;playing pinball&quot;, then he &quot;went quickly upstairs&quot; to record it to tape, as he had always done with songs he had written. It features synthesizer played by Michael Boddicker, who had also played on several songs on &quot;Thriller&quot; and the charity single &quot;We Are the World&quot;. The Toto members David Paich and Steve Porcaro, who had also previously worked on &quot;Thriller&quot;, provided synthesizer and synthesizer programming respectively. The song also features a Swahili chant from South African jazz singer, Letta Mbulu.

=== &quot;Just Good Friends&quot; ===

&quot;Just Good Friends&quot; is one of the two songs on the album which was not written by Jackson himself. It features Stevie Wonder and was written and composed by Terry Britten and Graham Lyle, recorded in 1987. Wonder had previously worked on &quot;Off the Wall&quot; with Jackson and Jones, writing &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;. Wonder also plays the synthesizer solo on the song.
Michael Jackson returned the compliment to Stevie Wonder in September 1987 by recording &quot;Get It&quot; for Wonder&#x27;s 1987 &quot;Characters&quot; album.

=== &quot;Another Part of Me&quot; ===

&quot;Another Part of Me&quot; was written by Jackson in 1985 for the 3D science fiction short film &quot;Captain EO&quot;, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, which was released in 1986. &quot;Another Part of Me&quot; could be seen at the end of &quot;Captain EO&quot;, as the title character and his crew triumphantly exit and fly off into space. Jackson revisited and edited the song in 1986 and it was decided to include it on the &quot;Bad&quot; album.

=== &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; ===

&quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; is also one of the two songs on the &quot;Bad&quot; album which was not written by Jackson. It was written by Siedah Garrett and Glen Ballard in 1987, after Jones invited a group of songwriters to a dinner at his home, asking them to &#x27;write hits&#x27; for Jackson&#x27;s new album. Garrett came up with a line about a man looking in the mirror and Ballard came up with the melody; then they recorded a demo within a week. The song, along with &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;, was recorded in May 1987. An excited Garrett called Jones while he was in a meeting, telling him that they had come up with a good song that would be a perfect fit for the album. At Jackson&#x27;s request, Ballard and Garrett wrote a longer middle eight and modified the lyrics. Jones enlisted the Andraé Crouch choir to record gospel vocals.

=== &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot; ===

&quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot; is a ballad style song, written by Jackson and recorded by Jackson and Garrett in May 1987. Garrett was also the one who co-wrote &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;. According to Jones, Jackson initially wanted Whitney Houston or Barbra Streisand to sing the duet with him. Streisand declined and Houston&#x27;s label, Arista Records, thought it was &quot;too risky&quot; for her to do the collaboration, as she was in the process of promoting her then new album&quot; Whitney&quot;. It was the first time since 1979&#x27;s &quot;Off the Wall&quot; that Jackson had collaborated with a female artist on a duet, which was &quot;It&#x27;s the Falling in Love&quot; with Patti Austin. Jones produced the song with Jackson receiving co-producing credits, like on the rest of the album.

=== &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; ===

&quot;Dirty Diana&quot; is a hard rock song written and recorded by Jackson. The last time Jackson had written a rock song was 1982&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; with &quot;Beat It&quot;. &#x27;Dirty Diana&#x27; was noted for having lyrical themes such as the ones of &quot;Billie Jean&quot;. Jackson sings about a woman who &quot;likes the boys in the band&quot;, which may be a reference to the &quot;groupies&quot; he had previously said liked to hang out around him and his brothers, in the early days of the Jackson Five. The song has three verses and three bridges. It has, furthermore, a guitar solo by Billy Idol&#x27;s guitarist, Steve Stevens. The song&#x27;s outro ends with Jackson singing &quot;come on&quot; into a fade with &quot;hey baby wontcha&quot; in the ad-lib.

=== &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; ===

&quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; is noted as sinister and has been described by writers as one of Jackson&#x27;s most captivating songs in his career. It was produced by Jones and co-produced by Jackson, with Swedien being the engineer. The song begins with a eerie heartbeat-like sound, setting the tone for the recurring theme of the track, and the lyrics immediately launch into a depiction of a crime scene, where a woman is assaulted in her apartment by a mysterious “smooth criminal.” Jackson&#x27;s repeated line, “Annie, are you OK?” draws inspiration from Resusci Anne, a mannequin used in CPR training. Jackson combined the common training question, “Are you OK?” with the mannequin&#x27;s name, giving rise to this would be iconic lyric.

== Composition and lyrics ==
&quot;Bad&quot; primarily incorporates pop, dance, and R&amp;B. The album also explores other genres such as funk, soul, jazz, rock, and hard rock. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes the album as a &quot;gleaming, high-tech dance record&quot;. The album is heavier and more &quot;aggressive&quot; than &quot;Thriller&quot;, with Jackson moving away from the heavy-groove sound and high-pitched vocals of his prior records. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that &quot;Bad&quot; moved Jackson &quot;deeper into hard rock, deeper into schmaltzy adult contemporary, deeper into hard dance – essentially taking each portion of &quot;Thriller&quot; to an extreme, while increasing the quotient of immaculate studiocraft.&quot; Upon listening to the album prior to its release, Howard Applebaum, who was one of 50 people invited to Jackson&#x27;s Encino home to listen to it, described it as &quot;kind of a stretch within the genre of contemporary hit radio and urban music. It&#x27;s cooler sounding, a little more jazzy in spots&quot;.

The lyrics relate to romance and paranoia, the latter being a recurring theme in Jackson&#x27;s albums. &quot;Bad&quot; was originally intended as a duet between Jackson and Prince (and Jackson had also planned duets with Diana Ross, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin and Barbra Streisand). The song was viewed as a revived &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot; progression with lyrics that pertain to boasting. &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; was viewed by AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine as misogynistic and its lyrics describing a sexual predator do not aim for the &quot;darkness&quot; of &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, instead sounding equally intrigued by and apprehensive of a sexual challenge, while having the opportunity to accept or resist it. &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; was described as a &quot;paranoid anthem&quot;. &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; was seen as Jackson going &quot;a step further&quot; and offering &quot;a straightforward homily of personal commitment&quot;, which can be seen in the lyrics, &quot;I&#x27;m starting with the man in the mirror / I&#x27;m asking him to change his ways / And no message could have been any clearer / If you wanna make the world a better place / Take a look at yourself and then make a change.&quot;

The lyrics to &quot;Liberian Girl&quot; were viewed as &quot;glistening&quot; with &quot;gratitude&quot; for the &quot;existence of a loved one&quot;, while those to &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; recalled &quot;the popcorn-chomping manner&quot; of &quot;Thriller&quot;. The track was thought of as an example of &quot;Jackson&#x27;s free-form language&quot; that keeps people &quot;aware that we are on the edge of several realities: the film, the dream it inspires, the waking world it illuminates&quot;. The music in &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;, a duet with Siedah Garrett, consisted mainly of finger snaps and timpani. &quot;Just Good Friends&quot; is a duet with Stevie Wonder; Jones admitted later: &quot;I made a mistake with [&#x27;Just Good Friends&#x27;]. That didn&#x27;t work.&quot;

Jackson&#x27;s mother, Katherine Jackson, wanted him to write an R&amp;B song with a shuffle rhythm for the album, which came to be &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;. The song consists of blues harmonies and a jazz-like tone, comparable to the classic Motown sound of the 1960s. The lyrics of &quot;Another Part of Me&quot; deal with being united, as &quot;we&quot;. Critics Richard Cromelin (from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;) and Richard Harrington (from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;) associated the song&#x27;s lyrics with the Harmonic Convergence phenomenon that occurred around the time of the album&#x27;s release, with Harrington highlighting the verse: &quot;The planets are lining up / We&#x27;re bringing brighter days / They&#x27;re all in line / Waiting for you / Can&#x27;t you see? / You&#x27;re just another part of me&quot;.

== Release and commercial reception ==

The anticipation for &quot;Bad&quot; was extremely high, with journalists from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; and &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, respectively, asserting it as the most anticipated album in history. Michael Goldberg and David Handelman had predicted that &quot;If &quot;Bad&quot; sells &#x27;only&#x27; 10 million copies, that will be more than virtually any other record but could be viewed as a failure for Michael Jackson&quot;. Released on August 31, 1987, a brief second wave of &#x27;Michaelmania&#x27; took place as fans around the US rushed to purchase &quot;Bad&quot;. A manager at a US record store compared the intense demand for &quot;Bad&quot; to the demand that Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Live 1975–85&quot; experienced the previous year and the Beatles&#x27; debut album &quot;Please Please Me&quot; experienced in July 1987 (released in the US for the first time).

In the US, &quot;Bad&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart and remained there for six consecutive weeks, selling over 2.25 million copies in its first week, which made it the fastest-selling album in US history at the time. Sales slowed down and by January 1989 (a year and 5 months after its release) its sales were at 6 million copies, equalling the US sales of &quot;Off the Wall&quot;. Despite &quot;Bad&quot; generating five number-one singles in the US, many in the American media labelled the album a disappointment due to it largely falling short of the sales that &quot;Thriller&quot; achieved in the country, which sold 12 million copies by December 1983 (a little over a year after its release) according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Bad&quot; was certified 11× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making it Jackson&#x27;s second-most successful album in the US.

Jackson suffered a hefty decline in popularity in the US, caused by his controversial new image. In some of Washington&#x27;s neighborhoods where &quot;Bad&quot; posters hung on utility poles, the pictures were mutilated with spray paint and knives. Na&#x27;im Akbar, an African American psychologist, condemned Jackson: &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, Michael Jackson engaged in a form of self-mutilation that was a rejection of his cultural self&quot;. In a 1988 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers poll of 23,000 readers, Jackson was voted the worst male singer, worst male rock artist, worst dressed, worst album (&quot;Bad&quot;), worst single (&quot;Bad&quot;), worst video (&quot;Bad&quot;), worst album cover (&quot;Bad&quot;), worst hype of the year and most unwelcome comeback. Editor David Wild remarked that the backlash to Jackson in the US was more to do with his &quot;quirky personality&quot; than his music. In 1989, Jackson&#x27;s manager, Frank DiLeo, said that he and Jackson were happy with the results of &quot;Bad&quot;. In DiLeo&#x27;s view, “Americans like to build ‘em up and tear ‘em down&quot;, further saying &quot;I’m sure that affected us. But we did the best we could.” 

Whilst the hysteria of &#x27;Michaelmania&#x27; diminished in the US, overseas it was still in full bloom. &quot;Bad&quot; became the fastest-selling album of all time following its release, with sales of over 7 million copies worldwide in its first week. Besides the US, the album reached number one in 24 other countries, including Austria, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. It also charted at No. 13 in Mexico and at No. 22 in Portugal. Within a year of its release, &quot;Bad&quot; was established as a blockbuster, selling around 18 million copies; this made Jackson the top-selling artist worldwide of 1988. It was the best-selling album worldwide of 1987 and of 1988. By 1989, sales of &quot;Bad&quot; reached 20 million, and by 1991 it was the second-best-selling album of all time, behind &quot;Thriller&quot;, having sold 25 million copies. As of today, the album has sold over 45 million copies worldwide, which ranks it amongst the best-selling albums ever.

In the UK, &quot;Bad&quot; was greatly successful; it debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with 350,000 copies sold in first week sales, a record at that time. &quot;Bad&quot; achieved sales of 1.6 million copies under four months in UK, and in the following year it sold 980,000 copies. It was the UK&#x27;s best-selling album of 1987 and third best-selling album of 1989. &quot;Bad&quot; was also the UK&#x27;s second best-selling album of the 1980s, surpassing &quot;Thriller&quot;. Today, &quot;Bad&quot; is certified 14 times platinum in the UK with sales of 4.2 million, making it Jackson&#x27;s second best-selling album there. &quot;Bad&quot; was also a standout success in France, selling 1.4 million copies; this makes it Diamond certified in the country. The album was certified Diamond by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for shipments exceeding 1,000,000 copies in Canada.

In Europe, the 2001 reissue was certified platinum by the IFPI for the sales of one million units. The album was also certified platinum by the IFPI for the shipment of over 20,000 copies in Hong Kong.

== Promotion ==
The marketing strategy for &quot;Bad&quot; was modeled on that for &quot;Thriller&quot;. Like the first &quot;Thriller&quot; single, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;, the first &quot;Bad&quot; single, &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;, was a ballad duet, followed by two &quot;more obvious modern pop knockouts&quot; backed by music videos.

A commemorative special on Jackson&#x27;s life, &quot;The Magic Returns&quot;, aired on CBS during prime time on the day of the release of &quot;Bad&quot;. At the end of the documentary, the channel debuted the short film for &quot;Bad&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese and featuring Wesley Snipes. The marketing strategy, mastered by DiLeo among others, also included Jackson producing another mini-movie around the time of the Bad world tour. That film, &quot;Moonwalker&quot; (1988), included performances of songs from &quot;Bad&quot;: &quot;Speed Demon&quot;, &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;, &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;, and &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, the latter two released as sole videos at the end of the film. The film also included the music video for &quot;Come Together&quot;, with the song featuring seven years later on &quot;&quot;. It became the bestselling home video of all time.

Sponsored by Pepsi, the Bad tour began in Japan, marking Jackson&#x27;s first performances there since 1972 with the Jackson 5. Attendance figures for the first 14 dates in Japan totaled a record-breaking 450,000. Jackson performed seven sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium, beating the previous record held by Madonna, Bruce Springsteen and Genesis. The third concert on July 16, 1988, was attended by Diana, Princess of Wales and Prince Charles. Jackson was entered into the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; three times from the tour alone. The Bad tour was a major financial success, grossing $125 million. Jackson performed 123 concerts in 15 countries to an audience of 4.4 million. The tour set records for both the largest grossing tour in history and the largest paid attendance.

Jackson performed two songs – &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; and &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; – at the 1988 Grammy Awards, having declined to perform during the &quot;Thriller&quot; era in 1984. According to Paul Grein of &quot;Billboard&quot;, Jackson&#x27;s performance at the show stands as &quot;Exhibit A to anyone who wants proof of his artistry and command when he was at the peak of his powers.&quot; Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as &quot;one of the most striking performances ever by a pop performer on national television&quot;, a performance that &quot;overshadowed everything else&quot; in the ceremony. &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; was nominated for Record of the Year a year later at the 1989 Grammy Awards.

== Singles ==
&quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;, a duet with Siedah Garrett, was the lead single. It peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and also reached number one in Belgium, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the UK and Zimbabwe.

&quot;Bad&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and remained there for two weeks, becoming the album&#x27;s second number-one single, and Jackson&#x27;s eighth number one entry on the chart. It also peaked at number one on the Hot R&amp;B Singles, Hot Dance Club Play and Rhythmic chart. Internationally, the song was also commercially successful, charting at the top of the charts in seven other countries including Ireland, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the Netherlands.

&quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; was the third consecutive &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one and reached number one in Ireland and Spain. &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and in Italy, as well as top 5 in Canada.

On July 2, 1988, &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; became the record-breaking fifth &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single from &quot;Bad&quot;. Jackson was the first artist in history to achieve five number-one singles on the Hot 100 from one album. In recognition of this achievemnent, Epic Records released a promotional poster including the text &#x27;NO ONE&#x27;S EVER BEEN THIS &quot;BAD&quot;&#x27;. Before the start of the Wembley Stadium show during the Bad tour in 1988, Diana, Princess of Wales, who was in attendance, informed Jackson that it was one of her favorite songs.

&quot;Another Part of Me&quot; achieved less success, reaching number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but topped the R&amp;B singles chart. Like Jackson&#x27;s earlier songs in his career such as &quot;Can You Feel It&quot; and &quot;We Are the World&quot;, the lyrics of the song emphasize global unity, love and outreach.

&quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; became the sixth top 10 single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number seven. The song reached number one in Belgium, Iceland, the Netherlands and Spain. Though it was not one of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles, in retrospective reviews it has been acclaimed as one of the best songs on &quot;Bad&quot; and one of Jackson&#x27;s signature songs.

Released outside the United States and Canada, &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; topped the Irish charts and reached the top ten in five other countries. &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; was Jackson&#x27;s response to negative and exaggerated rumors about him that frequently appeared in the tabloids post-1985 after the success of &quot;Thriller.&quot; The music video was the recipient of Best Music Video at the 1990 Grammy Awards.

The album&#x27;s final single, &quot;Liberian Girl&quot;, did not chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but reached the top 20 in various countries and reached number one in Ireland. The song has been sampled and covered by various artists including Chico Freeman, 2Pac and MC Lyte.

&quot;Speed Demon&quot;, written and co-produced by Jackson in 1986, was released as a promotional single on September 4, 1989, as part of the campaign around his 1988 film Moonwalker. 

&quot;Bad&quot;&#x27;s record of five number-one singles was tied by American singer Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Dream&quot; in 2012; Perry remains the only artist to have matched this feat. In the UK, seven of the &quot;Bad&quot; singles reached the UK top ten which was a record for any studio album for over 20 years.

=== Notable covers ===
In 1988, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic recorded &quot;Fat&quot;, a parody of &quot;Bad&quot;, which won a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video at the 1989 Grammy Awards.

In 2001, hard rock band Alien Ant Farm released a cover of &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; for their second album, &quot;Anthology&quot;. Their cover peaked at no. 1 in Australia, where it remained for eight weeks. It also peaked in the top ten of 14 European countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland, and peaked at no. 23 on the Hot 100.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Bad&quot; received generally strong reviews upon its release. Jay Cocks for &quot;Time&quot; drew attention to Jackson&#x27;s vocals on &quot;Bad&quot;, lauding Jackson as a great singer and that his vocal stunts on tracks like &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; or &quot;Speed Demon&quot; are as &quot;nimble and fanciful&quot; as any of his dance moves. Cocks also highlights &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; vocally as a &quot;remarkable dramatic performance&quot;, considering it one of the finest achievements in Jackson&#x27;s career. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was also of high praise, writing that &quot;Bad&quot; is &quot;the strongest and most consistent black pop album in years&quot;, attributing this to its &quot;studio mastery&quot; and Jackson&#x27;s &quot;rhythmic and vocal power&quot;. However, Christgau lamented the album&#x27;s lack of &quot;genius&quot; in the vein of &quot;Beat It&quot; or &quot;Billie Jean&quot;.

In &quot;USA Today&quot;, Edna Gundersen had a highly positive view, calling &quot;Bad&quot; Jackson&#x27;s &quot;most polished effort to date&quot;, that is &quot;calculated but not sterile&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Davitt Sigerson viewed the album as better than &quot;Thriller&quot;, noting that despite it not featuring a milestone recording like &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, the filler, such as &quot;Speed Demon&quot;, &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; and &quot;Liberian Girl&quot;, made it &quot;richer, sexier and better than &quot;Thriller&#x27;s&quot; forgettables.&quot; In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Pareles called &quot;Bad&quot; &quot;a well-made, catchy dance record by an enigmatic pop star&quot;. He said while nothing on the record compared to &quot;Wanna Be Startin&#x27; Somethin&#x27;&quot;, the music&#x27;s &quot;concocted synthesizer-driven arrangements&quot; were &quot;clear&quot; and carried &quot;a solid kick&quot;. Writing for NPR Music, Ken Tucker also called &quot;Bad&quot; a good album, noting that the best aspect of the album is the &quot;rough, upbeat&quot; music, especially in comparison to Jackson&#x27;s previous releases.

Some critics were not as favorable; Richard Cromelin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called &quot;Bad&quot; &quot;a fair-to-strong array of soul and rock blends&quot; but felt that it would be &quot;disappointing&quot; if this album&#x27;s &quot;creative level&quot; is where Jackson wants to stay. Cromelin further said that the record was &quot;not bad&quot; and was more &quot;reminiscent of &quot;Off the Wall&quot;″s uniform strength than &quot;Thriller&quot;″s peaks and valleys&quot;. Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt that the album could not live up to post-&quot;Thriller&quot; expectations and that it would be &quot;considerably fairer to compare&quot; &quot;Bad&quot; with &quot;Off the Wall&quot;. His overall opinion on &quot;Bad&quot; was that it was &quot;a very good record&quot; that is &quot;immaculately produced and with some scintillating vocal performances from Jackson&quot;. In a retrospective comment in 1991, Richard W. Stevenson of the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; considered the album a letdown for Jackson, and claimed that the album&#x27;s music was largely derivative of &quot;Thriller&quot;, leading to speculation within the recording industry that Jackson had lost his creative edge.

=== Awards ===

At the 1988 Grammy Awards, Jackson was the tied-most nominated artist (outside of the classical field), as &quot;Bad&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Performance – Male, Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance – Male, and Best Engineered Recording – Non Classical. Although the album won Best Engineered Recording – Non Classical, this went to the producers.

Jackson&#x27;s zero wins was the subject of media attention; American entertainer Little Richard, who was at the ceremony, said &quot;I&#x27;m shocked. I&#x27;m stunned [...] I think a lot of people are. Oooh, Michael!&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Hilburn said Jackson deserved to win at least one of the Vocal Performance awards, but not Album of the Year, which U2&#x27;s &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; (1987) won. The following year &quot;Bad&quot; was nominated for Record of the Year for &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;, and in 1990 won for Best Music Video – Short Form (for &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;).

Despite the lack of Grammy Awards for Jackson, he won numerous other awards for &quot;Bad&quot;. &quot;Bad&quot; won an American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Song at the 1988 American Music Awards. At the 1988 Soul Train Music Awards, the album won Best R&amp;B/Soul Album – Male and &quot;Bad&quot; won Best R&amp;B/Soul Single – Male. The following year, &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; also won Best R&amp;B/Soul Single – Male. The album won Outstanding Album at the 1988 NAACP Image Awards. At the 1988 Brit Awards, Jackson was also awarded the International Solo Artist award. At the 1989 Brit Awards, Jackson was awarded the inaugural International Male Solo Artist award, and &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; won British Video of the Year.

Jackson received several special awards in recognition of his success during the &quot;Bad&quot; era. In 1988, he was honored with &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s first Spotlight Award for being the first artist in history to achieve five number one singles on the Hot 100 from a single album. The record-breaking Bad tour, as well as the album&#x27;s chart and commercial achievements, earned Jackson the Lifetime Achievement Award at the American Music Awards of 1989 and the Heritage Lifetime Achievement Award at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards. Before awarding Jackson the Heritage Lifetime Achievement Award, Elizabeth Taylor dubbed him the &quot;true king of pop, rock, and soul&quot;. Following the appraisal of the music videos of the singles from &quot;Bad,&quot; along with his previous music videos throughout the 1980s, Jackson was awarded the MTV Video Vanguard Artist of the Decade Award. On April 5, 1990, Jackson arrived at the White House, where he was congratulated by U.S. President George H. W. Bush on being named as the &quot;Artist of the Decade&quot; by the Capital Children&#x27;s Museum following his continued dominance during the &quot;Bad&quot; era.

=== Accolades ===
== Legacy ==
=== Reappraisals ===

In the decades since its release, &quot;Bad&quot; has received overwhelming praise, with particular arguments being that Jackson was at his peak in vocal performance and showmanship during the album&#x27;s era. In a retrospective review for BBC Music, Mike Diver regards &quot;Bad&quot; as a standout event of 1980s pop culture, comparing its importance to the rise of the Walkman, the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; movies, and the shooting of JR. According to Diver, it was an album that was popular in all record collections, from &quot;rockers and poppers&quot; to &quot;punks and poets&quot;. Diver also praised the album for being the &quot;best of the best [of its time]&quot; and an &quot;essential pop masterpiece&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; credits &quot;Bad&quot; with defining the sound of pop music in the late 1980s, along with Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1989) and Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; (1989). Writing for &quot;Billboard&quot;, Gail Mitchell views &quot;Bad&quot; as one of the most important pop albums of the late 1980s, and one of the most successful albums in &quot;Billboard&quot; chart history.

In an article for &quot;The Root&quot;, Matthew Allen claimed that &quot;Bad&quot; was the start of Jackson&#x27;s &quot;three-year prime&quot; in his vocals, songwriting, producing, performing and video output. Smooth Radio named &quot;Bad&quot; as Jackson&#x27;s greatest album and credited the album for transforming Jackson into his peak as an entertainer. Ranked as the best album of 1987 by &quot;Consequence Of Sound&quot;, the publication asserts that &quot;Bad&quot; captured a &quot;bigger, bolder, and far more vital&quot; Jackson who emphasised important topics, including racial injustices and world peace. In similar praise, Erika Ramirez of &quot;Billboard&quot; highlighted &quot;Another Part of Me&quot; and &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; for showcasing Jackson as a &quot;caring humanitarian&quot; and emphasizing world unity.

According to Jayson Rodriguez of MTV, following &quot;Off the Wall&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot; was not an easy task, but Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot; was &quot;formidable by all accounts&quot;. Rodriguez also felt that during the &quot;Bad&quot; era, Jackson&#x27;s vocal hiccups and stammered &quot;shamone&quot; would become staples in his music that were &quot;heightening and highlighting the emotion of his lyrics.&quot; In a retrospective comment in 2009, VH1 said that the expectations for &quot;Bad&quot; were &quot;ridiculously high&quot;, noting that there was also further hype after Jackson planned duets with the likes of Prince; Whitney Houston; Aretha Franklin and Barbra Streisand. VH1 credited &quot;Bad&quot; for being a &quot;deeply personal project&quot; for Jackson – he wrote nine of the 11 songs – and one that saw him gain further independence and debut a harder-edged look and sound. Jim Farber of the &quot;Daily News&quot; wrote that &quot;Bad&quot; took aspects of &quot;Off the Wall&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot; to create Jackson&#x27;s &quot;most smooth work of pop to date&quot;. Writing for Albumism, Chris Lacy&#x27;s view is that &quot;Comparisons with &quot;Off the Wall&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot; are unimportant, except for this one: &quot;Bad&quot; is a pure pop masterpiece that stands parallel with—and, at times, eclipses—its classic predecessors.&quot; Lacy also stated that &quot;Bad&quot; set a &quot;new gold standard for pop music and entertainment&quot;.

Like &quot;Thriller&quot;, the album also improved the standard for innovation in music videos following the success of the music videos for &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; and &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;. The music video for &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; was also influential; the American rapper Ludacris, who featured in the Canadian singer Justin Bieber&#x27;s hit song &quot;Baby&quot;, said that the &quot;Baby&quot; music video was intended to be &quot;a 2010 version&quot; of &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;. MTV noted that the choreography used &quot;a few of Jackson&#x27;s less-suggestive moves&quot;. A professor at Louisiana State University asserts that the &quot;Bad&quot; music video revolutionized the traditional understanding of masculinity, particularly amongst Black American men. According to the professor, Jackson embraced dominant hyper-aggressiveness, yet simultaneously challenged this traditional position by creating an alternative form of masculinity. Jackson emphasized a sense of optimism about the future and distorted conventional notions of sexuality by presenting a dual image: a masculine self, indicated by clothing that suggested toughness, alongside a feminine aspect, expressed through his effeminate hairstyle and use of make-up.

=== 21st-century appeal ===
Writing for &quot;The Quietus&quot;, David Bennun argues that &quot;Bad&quot; &quot;changed pop music forever&quot; and claims that in the decades since its release, &quot;we have never ceased to hear things that sound like &quot;Bad&quot;&quot;, highlighting the likes of Usher, Justin Timberlake, and Bruno Mars as examples. Kendall Fisher of &quot;E! Online&quot; was of similar view, as she credited the album for having an impact on contemporary artists; &quot;Essentially, [&quot;Bad&quot;] epitomized the massive influence [Jackson] had on many of today&#x27;s biggest artists.&quot;

Twenty-five years after its release, the filmmaker Spike Lee said that &quot;Bad&quot; sounds the &quot;freshest&quot; compared to other &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 number-one albums released in 1987, such as U2&#x27;s &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; and Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;Whitney&quot;: &quot;Go to the charts ... and see what were the top albums 25 years ago, play those albums now and then play &quot;Bad&quot;, and then see which one still sounds fresh and doesn&#x27;t sound dated.&quot; Reflecting in 2022, 35 years after its release, Marcus Floyd wrote for &quot;Renowned for Sound&quot; that &quot;you can still hear why &quot;Bad&quot; was the singer&#x27;s [Jackson] second best selling album [...] &quot;Bad&quot; will always be a fan favourite and one of Michael Jackson&#x27;s most influential and ear-tantalising albums released over his extraordinary career.&quot;

The American musician Kanye West claimed that Jackson&#x27;s outfit in the &quot;Bad&quot; video is &quot;far more influential&quot; than Jackson&#x27;s outfit in the &quot;Thriller&quot; video. West also said &quot;I almost dress like that [Jackson&#x27;s outfit in the &quot;Bad&quot; video] today.&quot; In 2018, Jackson&#x27;s worn jacket from the video sold for $298,000 at a New York auction, about three times its original asking price.

<doc id="586856" wikidata="Q2446255" url="?curid=586856" title="Glenn Miller Orchestra">
<text>Glenn Miller and His Orchestra was an American swing dance band that was formed by Glenn Miller in 1938. Arranged around a clarinet and tenor saxophone playing melody, and three other saxophones playing harmony, the band became the most popular and commercially successful dance orchestra of the swing era and one of the greatest singles charting acts of the 20th century. As of , Ray Anthony is the last surviving member of the orchestra.

Miller began professionally recording in New York City as a sideman in the hot jazz era of the late 1920s. With the arrival of virtuoso trombonists Jack Teagarden and Tommy Dorsey, Miller focused more on developing his arrangement skills.
Writing for contemporaries and future stars such as Artie Shaw, and Benny Goodman, Miller gained prowess as an arranger by working in a variety of settings. Later, Miller largely improved his arranging and writing skills by studying under music theorist Joseph Schillinger.

In February 1937, Miller started an orchestra that briefly made records for Decca. With this group, Miller used an arrangement he wrote for British bandleader Ray Noble&#x27;s American band in an attempt to form a clarinet-reed sound. This style developed over time, and eventually became known as the &quot;Glenn Miller sound&quot;. Frustrated with his agency over playing inconsistent bookings and lacking broad radio exposure, Miller gave the band notice in December 1937. Less than three months later, he was looking for members and forming a new band.

Miller began a partnership with Eli Oberstein, which led directly to a contract with Victor subsidiary Bluebird Records. Gaining notoriety at such engagements as the Paradise Restaurant and Frank Dailey–owned Meadowbrook and their corresponding nationwide broadcasts, Miller struck enormous popularity playing the Glen Island Casino in the summer of 1939. From late 1939 to mid-1942, Miller was the number-one band in the country, with few true rivals. Only Harry James&#x27; band began to equal Miller&#x27;s in popularity as he wound down his career in the wake of the Second World War. The AFM strike prevented Miller from making any new recordings in the last two months of his band&#x27;s existence, and they formally disbanded at the end of September 1942.

Miller&#x27;s short-term chart successes have seldom been duplicated and his group&#x27;s unprecedented dominance of early &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; singles charts resulted in 16 number-one singles and 69 Top Ten hits.

==Musical success==

===Beginnings===
By March 1938, Glenn was planning to form a new group. The newly reformed band featured several longtime associates of Miller. From his first orchestra, Miller invited back Hal McIntyre, and hired Paul Tanner, Wilbur Schwartz, Ray Eberle (who was the younger brother of Jimmy Dorsey&#x27;s vocalist Bob Eberly), and his old friend Chummy MacGregor. Miller&#x27;s perseverance, business expertise, combined with a penchant for showmanship and musical taste, provided the faith for financiers Mike Nidorf and Cy Shribman. Miller used the &#x27;clarinet-lead&#x27; sound as the foundation for his new band, and this caught the attention of students at Northeastern campuses. They opened on April 16, 1938, at Raymor Ballroom in Boston. When the band reached New York, they were billed below Freddie Fisher and His Schnickelfritzers, a dance band comedy routine. From Vincent Lopez&#x27;s group came Marion Hutton, who added enthusiasm and energy in her performances. On September 7, 1938, the band made their first recordings, &quot;My Reverie&quot;, &quot;King Porter Stomp&quot; and &quot;By the Waters of Minnetonka&quot;, in two parts.
Keeping up radio dates, Miller was only booked for one more session the rest of the year.

===Glen Island Casino and Meadowbrook Ballroom appearances===
In March 1939, the Glenn Miller Orchestra was given its big break, when they were chosen to play the summer season at the prestigious Glen Island Casino located on the north shore of Long Island Sound in New Rochelle, New York. Frank Dailey, manager of The Meadowbrook Ballroom in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, immediately booked the band for a four-week stay in March and April, before Glen Island. The band was well-received and within days Dailey picked up a three-week extension offer. During this time, Bluebird recording dates became more common, and Glenn added drummer Maurice Purtill and trumpeter Dale &quot;Mickey&quot; McMickle to stabilize personnel. Opening at Glen Island on May 17, 1939, the casino&#x27;s radio broadcast antenna ensured the Miller band was heard around the country. By late August, the end of their summer season, they had nationwide attention.

George T. Simon, music writer and one-time drummer for Miller, spoke of the Glen Island broadcasts:

Glen Island was the prestige place for people who listened to bands on radio. The band&#x27;s first semi hit, &quot;Little Brown Jug&quot;, came out just when it opened at Glen Island. That helped. And the clarinet lead in Glenn&#x27;s arrangements was such a romantic sound! It caught the public fancy during this exposure. Miller began ending his broadcasts from Glen Island with his &quot;Something Old, Something New&quot; medleys. But the most important thing for Glenn&#x27;s success was that he recorded &quot;In the Mood&quot; while he was at the casino. That made him the Michael Jackson of his day.

===Nationwide popularity===
Capitalizing on newfound popularity, Miller decided to add a trombone and a trumpet, giving the band a fuller sound. On April 4, 1939, Miller and his orchestra recorded &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot;. Considered one of the top songs of the swing era, and Miller&#x27;s best composition, it soon became the theme song to start and end all of his radio performances.

Miller&#x27;s most popular track &quot;In the Mood&quot; was recorded August 1, 1939. Famous for its opening and bass riffs as well as its &quot;dueling&quot; saxophone solos between Tex Beneke and Al Klink, the song hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, staying for a total of 30 weeks. Joe Garland compiled the song from riffs he&#x27;d heard in other songs, and is credited on the label. Elements of &quot;In the Mood&quot; can be found in earlier jazz recordings, such as Jimmy O&#x27;Bryant&#x27;s &quot;Clarinet Getaway&quot;, Wingy Manone&#x27;s &quot;Tar Paper Stomp&quot;, and Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s &quot;Hot and Anxious.&quot; Garland put these pieces together and initially offered the song, in a six-minute form, to Artie Shaw. Despite playing it for radio broadcast, Shaw found no success with it in this form. Miller purchased the song in June 1939 and asked Eddie Durham to arrange it for his orchestra, and Miller made final tweaks in Victor studios. In a 2000 interview for NPR, trombonist Paul Tanner remembered recording the song and playing it live:

He would say, &quot;You fellas do this, and you fellas do that, and let&#x27;s hear it once.&quot; And then, &quot;We&#x27;re gonna cut from this spot to this spot in the arrangement, and in here we&#x27;re gonna put a trumpet solo. And in this spot and this spot we&#x27;re gonna cut way down here and we&#x27;re gonna have the two saxophones have a little battle in there,&quot; and decided to make cuts. And then at the end, Alice [Winkler, the interviewer], if you know the arrangement, at the end there are all those false endings that go on, and it kept getting softer and softer until Glenn would give the drummer a cue and he would hit the cowbell and then we would know that the next time we were to come on very loud. And the dancers just loved it. He tried it out on the dances at the Glen Island Casino, and they loved it. They couldn&#x27;t figure out how we knew when to come in loud. But, you know, I told them, &quot;Well, we have a sixth sense of that sort of thing.&quot; But actually, what happened is the drummer hit the cowbell, and we knew the next time was loud. And this was all Glenn&#x27;s doing.

On February 5, 1940, Miller recorded &quot;Tuxedo Junction&quot;, which hit number one and reportedly sold 115,000 copies within the first week of release, and placed 7th overall for the National Hit Parade that year. Bob Eberly said that it &quot;sold 90,000 copies in the first week, at a time when 25,000 was considered a great seller&quot;. In April, the band chant track &quot;Pennsylvania 6-5000&quot;, referencing the phone number for the Hotel Pennsylvania, which housed the Café Rouge, a common engagement and broadcasting spot for the band, was released and it too became an instant swing standard.

On January 1, 1941, following tensions regarding licensing fees, radio networks banned ASCAP songs from live performance. Miller had to work to reform his radio programs for BMI published tunes, temporarily switching his theme to &quot;Slumber Song&quot;. In early 1941, Marion Hutton left the band to go on maternity leave. In the meantime, Miller needed an additional female vocalist, and he offered Dorothy Claire, then with Bobby Byrne&#x27;s band, twice her salary. Claire went to work for Miller, despite her signature on a three-year contract with Byrne in November 1940, and Miller ignored Byrne&#x27;s wishes for compensation. Byrne then launched a $25,000 lawsuit against the Miller orchestra&#x27;s business dealings. Miller met with Byrne in Columbus, Ohio sometime in early March and settled the dispute – Claire went back to working with Byrne&#x27;s band. Miller soon hired The Modernaires from Paul Whiteman, who was disbanding his orchestra. Still in need of a female vocalist, the wife of Modernaire Hal Dickinson, Paula Kelly, who had sung previously with Al Donahue, stepped up to fill in the role. The signing of the Modernaires significantly benefitted the Miller organization. Hip and popular with young listeners, the Modernaires&#x27; vocal range added a new dimension to Miller&#x27;s recordings.

In late March, Miller and his orchestra began work on their first motion picture, &quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot;. Previously, &quot;swing films&quot; such as &quot;Hollywood Hotel&quot; with Benny Goodman&#x27;s orchestra had only featured bands for song performances; Miller reportedly insisted, perhaps even to the extent of contract clauses, that the plot of &quot;Sun Valley&quot; revolve around the band rather than only feature them. Harry Warren and Mack Gordon were commissioned to write songs for the film. The Miller band filmed and recorded an extended song-and-dance number featuring the Nicholas Brothers for what was soon to be its biggest selling record, surprise hit &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot;. Despite criticism of the plot, &quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot; was received with general positivity from critics, and Miller earned praise for his band&#x27;s role in the film, with Barry Ulanov writing for Metronome:
Miller comes across as a convincing band leader, and, even more important, a convincing human being in this film. He’s on mostly for music, but most of the film is music and the dozen or so reels are a better showcase for the Glenn Miller band than they are for the Sonja Henie torso and limbs, with and without skates. Never has a movie made more of a popular band and never has a movie featuring such an organization presented its music so tastefully... Pictorially, Trigger Alpert and Maurice Purtill take the honors. Trigger hops around like mad and Maurice looks like the movies’ idea of a swing drummer, all right. They stay within the bounds of good taste, however ... the story is believable, and happily centers around the band, so that the whole thing is a triumph for Glenn Miller and the band.
===First gold record presentation===
In October, ASCAP and the radio networks agreed on a new rate, and the band could finally play &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot; and their other songs on radio. On February 10, 1942, the manager of record sales for RCA Victor and Bluebird records, W. Wallace Early presented the first gold record ever made to Glenn Miller for “Chattanooga Choo Choo.” Wallace Early: It&#x27;s a pleasure to be here tonight. And speaking of RCA Victor, we&#x27;re mighty proud of that &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot;, and the man that made the record, Glenn Miller. You see it&#x27;s been a long time – 15 years in fact – since any record has sold a million copies. And &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot; certainly put on steam and breezed right through that million mark by over 200,000 pressings. And we decided that Glenn should get a trophy. The best one we could think of is a gold record of &quot;Chattanooga&quot;. And now Glenn, it&#x27;s yours – with the best wishes of RCA Victor Bluebird Records.

Glenn Miller: Thank you, Wally, that’s really a wonderful present. 

Radio announcer, Paul Douglas: I think everyone listening in on the radio should know Glenn, it’s actually a recording of &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot; but it’s in gold. Solid gold, and it’s really fine.

Glenn Miller: That’s right, Paul, and now for the boys in the band, thanks a million, two hundred thousand.In early 1942, the band was upgraded from Bluebird to full-price Victor Records. Following very closely in the footsteps of its predecessor, the Miller band started work on their second film, &quot;Orchestra Wives&quot; in March. Once again, Gordon and Warren were recalled to compose the songs. The previous year, both had composed &quot;At Last&quot; but couldn&#x27;t place it into &quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot; vocally, although it appears in the film in three different instrumental versions. The song was arranged by Jerry Gray in a vocal version, and it was displayed prominently in &quot;Orchestra Wives&quot;. It became a standard when recorded by Glenn Miller orchestra alumnus Ray Anthony in 1951 in a version that reached no. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart. Etta James released a popular version in 1961 that added to the iconic status of the song. Akin to &quot;Chattanooga&quot;, &quot;(I&#x27;ve Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo&quot; was filmed as a song and dance number featuring the Nicholas Brothers and also sold a million pressings, with &quot;Billboard&quot; ranking it among the most popular records of the year.

===AFM ban and disbandment===
In mid–July, Miller and the band recorded thirteen sides, as James Petrillo, chief of the musicians&#x27; union, embarked on a 28-month recording ban. The strike prevented Miller from making additional records in his career, although Victor slowly released the last set of tracks, with &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot; hitting number one in May 1943, over eight months after his the orchestra disbanded.

Miller began incorporating more patriotic themes into his radio shows and recordings after the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.

At the top of his civilian musical career in 1942, Glenn Miller decided to join the troops he had been entertaining. As a 38-year-old, he was too old to be drafted. First, he tried to join the United States Navy, but officials told him they &quot;could not use his services&quot; at that time. Miller then wrote to Army Brigadier General Charles Young. He successfully persuaded the United States Army to accept him, so he could, &quot;be placed in charge of a modernized Army band.&quot; He reported for duty on October 7, 1942. He soon transferred to the United States Army Air Forces where he formed what would become the Major Glenn Miller Army Air Forces Orchestra, the precursor of the US Air Force Airmen of Note.

Glenn Miller and his Orchestra broadcast their final Chesterfield radio spot on CBS radio on September 24, 1942. During the program, Miller announced that from then on, the Chesterfield radio broadcast would be done by Harry James. Harry James played &quot;Jukebox Saturday Night&quot; with the band that night. They played their last concert on September 27, 1942, in Passaic, New Jersey.

==Radio success==
Radio played a pivotal role in the success of Glenn Miller and His Orchestra. Featured heavily on the format during their existence, many of their earlier programs from such venues as the Paradise Restaurant, Glen Island and the Meadowbrook Ballroom used remote connections to the National Broadcasting Company, on both &quot;NBC–Red&quot; and &quot;NBC–Blue&quot;.

The makers of Chesterfield Cigarettes hosted a half-hour radio show on CBS that featured &quot;King of Jazz&quot; Paul Whiteman. Whiteman decided to retire and recommended Glenn as a replacement. On December 27, 1939, Miller took over the program as &quot;Chesterfield Moonlight Serenade&quot;. During the first 13 weeks, The Andrews Sisters were featured as &quot;Chesterfield&quot; were worried over whether Miller could sustain his popularity. Their fear subsided, and the program, reformatted for 15 minutes, aired Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights at 10:15 pm. Miller and his band held the slot until their disbandment in 1942.

In 1940, the band broadcast from the first time from the Café Rouge at the Hotel Pennsylvania, soon to become a regular booking and a host of long-term engagements. By then, the Miller band had several NBC sustaining broadcasts in addition to three CBS programs, reaching American homes 6–7 days a week. In August, Miller&#x27;s orchestra had an hour-long program on NBC–Blue, &quot;Glenn Miller&#x27;s Sunset Serenade&quot; featuring prizes Miller paid for out-of-pocket. A review in &quot;Billboard&quot; commented, &quot;Unusual length of the program allows Miller to display all the top items in his library.&quot;

==Chart success==
According to Paul Albone, of the 121 singles by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra that made the charts, 69 were Top Ten hits, and 16 reached number-one. In just a 4-year career, Miller and His Orchestra&#x27;s songs spent a cumulative total of 664 weeks, nearly thirteen years, on the charts, 79 of which were at the number-one position. Miller also has the distinction of three posthumous albums reaching number-one on &quot;Billboard&quot; charts: &quot;Glenn Miller&quot; in 1945, its follow-up in 1947, and his original recordings repackaged for the release of &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; in 1954.

<doc id="586864" wikidata="Q7676613" url="?curid=586864" title="Taiwanese hip-hop">
<text>Taiwanese hip hop music started in the early 1990s, popularized by the early hip hop trio L.A. Boyz. A distinctive style of rap emerged using Taiwanese Hokkien as opposed to the Mandarin Chinese used in Mandopop, which before democratization the regime actively promote the use of Mandarin and suppressing the use of Taigi.

== Cultural context ==
A mid-70s movement titled the Modern Folksong Movement sought to reclaim hip hop for the Taiwanese people. Artists such as Yang Xian and Li Shuangz inspired a new generation of localization of music which strove to strip away the years of American cultural imperialism, which at the time, the United States was supporting Taiwan as Cold War ally. This movement paved the way for more Taiwan-specific music and allowed for new Taiwanese to take from local traditions and language and create their own national music.

==Early years: Harlem Yu==

The first Mandarin rap song was performed by singer-songwriter Harlem Yu in Taiwan, who is known for being one of the first artists to experiment with R&amp;B and rap in the Mandopop music industry in the early 1980s, which was parallel to the early New York 1980s rap songs.

== 1990s: L.A. Boyz ==

L.A. Boyz is a Taiwanese pop/rap group composed of two brothers and their cousin. They were raised in Irvine, California, and met at its University High School. They first became involved in music through their interest in hip-hop dance moves learnt from parties around Orange County and Los Angeles, and fashion from Compton and South-Central LA. Their dancing, and entry into various competitions, eventually led them to be scouted by a representative of Pony Canyon, in Taiwan. They released 10 albums, starting from their first, &quot;SHIAM!&quot; which sold more than 130,000 copies in 1992. Their second album, released the same year, was similarly received. The group was very successful in the 1990s until their break-up. They are credited for starting the trend that would spread into Taiwan and the rest of the Mandarin-speaking world.

==2000s to 2010s==
In 2001, MC HotDog arrived in the Taiwanese market. He is known for his use of explicit lyrics in his songs. He is known for his two famous hits, &quot; (My Life) and &quot; (The Korean Invasion).

In 2002, Dwagie released &quot;Lotus from the Tongue&quot; (), regarded as the first full rap album in the Chinese-speaking world.

Since then, many Taiwanese rappers have emerged, including Jae Chong, Machi, , , and Nine One One. Women are a minority in Taiwanese hip-hop. Meredith Schweig wrote in 2010 that &quot;there are no professional female MCs on the island&quot; other than Miss Ko, who was regarded as a &quot;newcomer&quot; at the time.

== 2018-Present ==
The moment that the Golden Melody Awards granted an award to both Leo Wang and Soft Lipa announced the official arrival of Taiwanese hip-hop into the mainstream. In addition to being recognized in general pop-music circles, in 2021, MTV received a subsidy from the Ministry of Culture&#x27;s Film, Television and Pop Music Industry Bureau to produce &quot;The Rappers&quot;. The judges were Dwagie, Kumachen, Razor Jiang, and Leo Wang. This show is aiming to broaden the audience for Taiwanese hip-hop, and season 2 is set to premiere in January 2022.

The future of Taiwanese hip-hop appears to be promising, and there are many talented musicians working hard in this industry. However, with the development of the Internet today, topicality and traffic-flows are no less important than whether the content of the work is high-quality, and marketing has become a new concern for rappers.

== The Four major Taiwanese rap labels ==

=== 1. Kung Fu Entertainment.（人人有功練）===
Founded by Dwagie in 2003. In the beginning, it was a community of friends gathering to promote hip-hop culture. Its regular members include Dwagie, JY, RPG, BR, Kumachan, and Professor H, all of whom are engaged in music production, performances, teaching, and cultural promotion.

=== 2. KAO!INC.（顏社）===
Founded in July 2005, KAO!INK’s Founder Dila Pang, aimed to promote Chinese rap music and create a brand new rap hip-hop music label in Taiwan. KAO!INK has since cultivated many rappers through various means, including Soft Lipa, Gordon, DJ Didilong, Jerry Li, DJ JIN.

=== 3. AINOKO ENTERTAINMENT.（混血兒娛樂 ）===
Co-founded by 911 and Right Eye in 2015. It has been successful in recruiting artists such as Monkey, 187 INK and others who have worked together in the past, but has also signed up various artists from the new generation of hip-hop groups like: Cocky Boyz, Cautun Boyz and BCW. AINOKO ENTERTAINMENT continues the &quot;Taichung Love&quot; inherited by the predecessor TTM, and also allows the vitality of Taichung hip-hop to continue to spread.

=== 4. True color.（本色音樂）===
Established in 2004, It was co-founded by George, and the singer A-Yue. True Color promotes itself as being a champion for Chinese hip-hop pop music. Some of the members which they work for include MC HotDog, and MJ116 (also individually as E.SO, Kenzy, and Muta). In 2015, True color formed a group of its artists together to begin a world tour, and after the world tour, True Color felt that it had contributed to the expansion of the influence of hip-hop within the mainstream music industry of Taiwan.

<text>Virginia State University (VSU or Virginia State) is a public historically Black land-grant university in Ettrick, Virginia. Founded on , Virginia State developed as the United States&#x27;s first fully state-supported four-year institution of higher learning for Black Americans. The university is a member school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.

==History==
Virginia State University was founded on March 6, 1882, when the legislature passed a bill to charter the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute. The bill was sponsored by Delegate Alfred W. Harris, a Black attorney whose offices were in Petersburg, but who lived in and represented Dinwiddie County in the General Assembly. A hostile lawsuit delayed opening day for nineteen months, until October 1, 1883. In 1902, the legislature revised the charter act to curtail the collegiate program and to change the name to Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute.

In 1920, the land-grant program for Black students was moved from a private school, Hampton Institute, where it had been since 1872, to Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute. In 1923 the college program was restored, and the name was changed to Virginia State College for Negroes in 1930. The two-year branch in Norfolk was added to the college in 1944; the Norfolk division became a four-year branch in 1956 and gained independence as Norfolk State College in 1969. Meanwhile, the parent school was renamed Virginia State College in 1946. The legislature passed a law in 1979 that changed the name to Virginia State University.

In the first academic year, 1883–1884, the university had 126 students and seven faculty (all of them Black), one building, , a 200-book library, and a $20,000 budget. By the centennial year of 1982, the university was fully integrated, with a student body of nearly 5,000, a full-time faculty of about 250, a library containing 200,000 books and 360,000 microform and non-print items, a campus and farm, more than 50 buildings, including 15 dormitories and 16 classroom buildings, and a biennial budget of $31,000,000, exclusive of capital outlay.

The university is situated in Chesterfield County at Ettrick, on a bluff across the Appomattox River from the city of Petersburg. It is accessible via Interstate Highways 95 and 85, which meet in Petersburg.

The first person to bear the title of President, John Mercer Langston, was one of the best-known Black men of his day. Until 1992, he was the only Black man ever elected to the United States Congress from Virginia (elected in 1888), and he was the great-uncle of the famed writer Langston Hughes. From 1888 to 1968, four presidents – James H. Johnston, John M. Gandy, Luther H. Foster, Robert P. Daniel served an average of 20 years, helping the school to overcome adversity and move forward. The next twenty years, 1968–1992, saw six more presidents—James F. Tucker, Wendell P. Russell, Walker H. Quarles, Jr., Thomas M. Law, Wilbert Greenfield, and Wesley Cornelious McClure.

<doc id="586877" wikidata="Q2075745" url="?curid=586877" title="Onslaught (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Onslaught is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He first appeared as a cameo in &quot;X-Men: Prime&quot; #1 before making his first full appearance in &quot;X-Men&quot; vol. 2, #53, where he would eventually serve as the main antagonist of the &quot;Onslaught&quot; storyline from then onward.

Onslaught was written as a sentient psionic entity created from the subconsciousness of two mutants: Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto. During a battle between the X-Men and Magneto&#x27;s Acolytes, Professor Xavier used his telepathic powers to shut down Magneto&#x27;s mind, rendering him catatonic. It was explained through the Onslaught crossover series that the darkest aspect of Magneto&#x27;s mind escaped into Xavier&#x27;s subconscious, where it &quot;merged&quot; with Xavier&#x27;s own darker nature to eventually grow into a separate persona of its own.

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in cameo in &quot;X-Men: Prime&quot; #1 (July 1995), named in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #322 and made his first full appearance in &quot;X-Men&quot; vol. 2, #53 (June 1996) where he was co-created by writers Scott Lobdell, Mark Waid, and artist Andy Kubert. He was written and introduced as a villain that was part of the effect of events in the 1993 &quot;Fatal Attractions&quot; storyline. Onslaught&#x27;s introduction into X-Men storylines caused its own crossover event across multiple Marvel comic book titles (including &quot;Avengers&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; issues).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
Onslaught is a sentient psionic entity created from the subconsciousness of Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto. During a battle between the X-Men and Magneto&#x27;s Acolytes, Magneto used his powers to rip the adamantium from Wolverine&#x27;s skeleton, causing such extensive injuries that his healing factor was exhausted. Xavier was so unhinged with anger over the brutality of Magneto&#x27;s assault against Wolverine that he used his telepathic powers to shut down Magneto&#x27;s mind and render him catatonic. During the psionic contact, Magneto&#x27;s anger, grief, and lust for vengeance entered Xavier&#x27;s consciousness, mingling with every long-suppressed negative yearnings Xavier had endured during the last 30 years. This result created the being known as Onslaught.

===First appearance===
Onslaught remained dormant for some time but subtly began influencing Charles Xavier. After an attempt to spy on the new mutant Nate Grey, a refugee from the world known as the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, resulted in the latter pulling Xavier from the astral plane into the real world, the aspect of Onslaught in Xavier was able to use this experience to &#x27;teach&#x27; itself how to manifest its own body.

Onslaught offers Juggernaut a chance to join him in his effort to generate fear in a twisted plot to &quot;unify&quot; humans and mutants. When Marko declines his offer and decides to warn the X-Men of the danger ahead, Onslaught uses his powers to mentally block Juggernaut from remembering his true identity, and magnetically to fling him from Vancouver to New Jersey. When the X-Men find him, Cain was only able to tell the X-Men one word, the name of his attacker &quot;Onslaught&quot;.

Following the encounter with Juggernaut, Onslaught invaded a government-sanctioned Sentinel base. He downloaded the current specifications for the mutant-hunting androids and erased portions of the memories of the employees working in the clandestine factory. Additionally, Onslaught had started recruiting others to do his dirty work for him and first manifested himself to the X-Men when he challenged the teleporter Gateway to test Cyclops, Storm, Wolverine, and Iceman, by kidnapping them and sending them to face off against his agent Post. Later, Onslaught helped Jean Grey and Gambit escape from a secret meeting held at the Pentagon, where Bastion, the leader of Operation Zero Tolerance, met with various world leaders to discuss the threat of mutants.

Onslaught&#x27;s attention was also occupied by another task; the recruitment of the immensely powerful telepath Nate Grey. To do the job, the powerful entity knocked out Sebastian Shaw and Tessa, to lure Holocaust away from them, promising him immeasurable power in exchange for his loyalty. He then dispatched Holocaust to test Nate. Using physical force, Nate eventually cracked Holocaust&#x27;s armor, though he was unable to breach the powerful psionic defenses Onslaught placed around Holocaust&#x27;s mind. Accepting defeat, Holocaust fled, but warned Nate that Onslaught knew his potential now and would come in person to claim him.

Onslaught later sought out Jean Grey, hoping to convince her to join his cause with the offer of power rivaling that of the Phoenix Force. He took her into the astral plane where he revealed damaging information about Professor Xavier, such as a long-forgotten attraction the Professor had to Jean during the X-Men&#x27;s early days in hoping to recruit her Phoenix Force experience to gain more power. Jean resisted Onslaught, but he defeated her and sent her back to her physical body with only a fleeting memory of what had happened as well as the name &quot;Onslaught&quot; telepathically branded on her forehead.

Gradually, Xavier&#x27;s frustration with his dream of mutant-human harmony began to increase, exacerbated by the daily growth of anti-mutant hysteria, the deaths of dozens of mutants from the lethal Legacy Virus, and his own failed attempt to rehabilitate Sabretooth. Xavier reached his breaking point when anti-mutant humans killed a young mutant near the grounds of the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning, the secret base of the X-Men. At this point, Onslaught awakened within Xavier and took full possession of the Professor&#x27;s mind and body. Onslaught-as-Xavier called together the X-Men. When they resisted his plan to turn them into soldiers fighting a total war against humans, Onslaught revealed himself to the X-Men and tried to destroy them. Bishop, remembering childhood stories of a traitor betraying and killing the X-Men, began to realize that the guilty party was Xavier as Onslaught. Bishop rescued his teammates, but Onslaught escaped, taking Xavier&#x27;s body with him.

Once free, Onslaught created a childlike psionic projection named Charles to gain the trust of Franklin Richards. Onslaught captured the child, despite a rescue attempt by Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman. Now carrying Franklin and Xavier, Onslaught also captured Nate Grey, intending to use his raw psionic power to fuel Onslaught&#x27;s plans to transform the human race into a collective consciousness. Onslaught returned to New York, reprogramming the Sentinel robots to obey his commands and form a protective circle around Manhattan, sealing off the island from the rest of the world.

The X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers joined forces to challenge Onslaught. Their first confrontation with the entity and his minions resulted in the rescue of Xavier, reducing Onslaught to a mass of psionic energy contained within his armor. However, this also prevented Xavier from influencing the villain with his better nature. A second and final confrontation occurred at Onslaught&#x27;s Central Park citadel where the heroes made a number of attempts to free Franklin and X-Man from Onslaught&#x27;s armor. During their next assault, Jean Grey used her telepathy to suppress the part of the monstrous Hulk&#x27;s mind that contained the rationality of his alter ego, Dr. Bruce Banner. With his new, nearly-feral intelligence pushing his rage - and thus, his strength - to unbelievable levels, the Hulk battled Onslaught and tore apart his armor. The resulting explosion of psionic energy separated Banner and the Hulk, and Onslaught was left as an energy being, immune to most physical harm. Onslaught then used Franklin&#x27;s powers to create a second sun that would destroy the heroes and Manhattan. In desperation, Thor flew into the energy being, disrupting Onslaught&#x27;s form. Realizing that Thor&#x27;s efforts alone were insufficient to destroy their adversary, the non-mutant members of the Avengers and the Fantastic Four entered the energy field. The X-Men were unable to do likewise, as it was theorized that if Onslaught, a being of mutant origin, came to possess a mutant host, he would become unstoppable. Onslaught dissolved, seemingly destroyed, along with the heroes who had thrown themselves into the rift.

The remaining Sentinels were disabled, Franklin and Nate were rescued, and Manhattan was returned to normal. Later, it was revealed that the Avengers and the Fantastic Four did not die, as had been surmised. Rather, the heroes were reborn in a pocket universe created by Franklin. The Avengers and the Fantastic Four returned to their rightful home months later, possessing only hazy memories of their time on Counter-Earth.

===Onslaught Reborn===
A five-issue limited series was issued in late 2006 to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the &quot;Onslaught&quot; storyline, titled &quot;Onslaught Reborn&quot;, by writer Jeph Loeb and artist Rob Liefeld. &quot;Onslaught Reborn&quot; features the return of the villain and addresses unresolved plot threads; this event is set after the &quot;Decimation&quot; and &quot;Civil War&quot; storylines.

After Scarlet Witch used her powers to de-power most of Earth&#x27;s mutants, the powers of Charles Xavier and Magneto collided to reform Onslaught, whose consciousness lingered after his defeat. Onslaught swore revenge on the young Franklin Richards and any other hero that he despised, manifesting as a monstrous version of his previous form with a skull-like face. He first took control of both the Human Torch and Mister Fantastic in an attempt to kill Franklin, but was soon interrupted by the Invisible Woman and the Thing, who saved Franklin. Franklin ran to Counter-Earth, but Onslaught followed.

As Onslaught appeared in Counter-Earth he became larger, and regained his Magneto-like mask. He soon encountered the Avengers and was presumed defeated after he fell into the ocean. Instead of worrying about Onslaught, the Avengers questioned Franklin&#x27;s credibility, as Franklin claimed to be the son of both Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman. On Counter-Earth Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman were not married and did not have children. Shortly after this, Thor was assaulted by an Onslaught-possessed Hulk, who battled Thor to determine which of the two was more powerful. Onslaught switched between the bodies and possessed Thor, who struck the Hulk with lightning. As Thor was about to strike again, he dropped his hammer, as Onslaught was not worthy to carry it. Onslaught switched back to the Hulk, and punched Thor into the atmosphere. Onslaught was assaulted by the Avengers before he could pick up Thor&#x27;s hammer. Captain America ordered the Human Torch and Iron Man to rescue Thor, telling them they had about sixty seconds for the rescue. They raced to save him, and Johnny took Thor back to the Baxter Building, where Mr. Fantastic discovered that Franklin really was his son. In the battle, Captain America ordered Hawkeye to find Onslaught, and confronted Hawkeye with the fact that Wolverine was hiding in Hawkeye&#x27;s costume. The Avengers continued to battle the Hulk, while Captain America was thrown into a building. Iron Man, from the atmosphere, charged down at the Hulk at full speed, hoping that Bruce would forgive him someday. He punched the Hulk, knocking him out. He and Captain America assessed their next move until Onslaught possessed Iron Man and attacked Captain America. Back at Avengers Mansion, Rikki Barnes was babysitting Franklin when Loki, Executioner, Scarlet Witch, Enchantress, and Ultron V surprised them with an offer to help defeat Onslaught. On a balcony, an invisible Ant-Man and the Invisible Woman let themselves be known, as Sue refused to let the villains cause Franklin any harm.

After a brief skirmish, the heroes and villains decided to work together to defeat Onslaught. Rikki &quot;Bucky&quot; Barnes defeated Onslaught using a Fantasticar to send both Barnes and Onslaught through the Negative Zone barrier in the Fantastic Four&#x27;s lab, trapping them. Franklin returned home, Bucky found herself on Earth 616, and Onslaught was last seen floating outside the Area 42 Prison in the Negative Zone.

===Onslaught Unleashed===
Some time later, Rikki Barnes, now known as Nomad, began having strange and vivid nightmare about the deep jungles of South America. When her teammate Toro is kidnapped just like she dreamed, she begins to suspect that her nightmares are something more sinister than she first thought. Later, while investigating Corporate Conglomerate Roxxon for illegal weapons systems, the Secret Avengers come across the plans for Project Power, a new and incredibly deadly power source being secretly developed in the Colombian rainforest. As the Secret Avengers investigate the facility, Beast and Ant-Man find the source of the mysterious energy source to be from the Negative Zone. As Rikki races inside the facility to locate Toro, she stumbles into the control room instead, where the sinister voice of her dreams beckons and reveals itself to be Onslaught.

Possessing Rikki&#x27;s body, Onslaught reveals that the real Rikki had, in fact, died in the Negative Zone; his current host was just a construct made by Onslaught himself so he could use the energy he had stored in her as an anchor to pull himself back into the main Marvel Earth. The revelation that Rikki had been sent to the main Marvel Earth solely to serve as Onslaught&#x27;s tether forced Rikki to fight back to prove he was wrong. Eventually, Rikki had Gravity kill her so that Onslaught could not return and destroy Earth.

Despite Rikki&#x27;s apparent death, Steve Rogers began to have nightmares similar to the ones Rikki had before, suggesting that enough of Nomad&#x27;s (and Onslaught&#x27;s) energy may have survived to escape death and now seek a new way to return to the main Marvel reality.

===Red Onslaught===
A clone of Red Skull later exhumes Charles Xavier&#x27;s corpse and grafts part of his brain onto his own, giving him Xavier&#x27;s psychic abilities.

In the lead-up to the &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline, Magneto is pushed too far by the Red Skull and his S-Men, after discovering that the madman had turned Genosha into a Concentration Camp and was exterminating mutants and inhumans. Filled with anger, Magneto killed the S-Men before killing the Red Skull, offering him a &quot;clean death&quot;. Rather than using his own magnetic powers, Erik used bricks to shatter the villain&#x27;s skull, however by murdering the Red Skull, he merely unleashed Onslaught, who had apparently been dormant within Xavier&#x27;s mind, causing the psionic being to merge with the Red Skull and become Red Onslaught, by far the most powerful incarnation of Red Skull. He then started telepathically spreading hate across the world, as Magneto and the Avengers Unity Division tried to stop him. The Avengers came to help after locating the Skull following the discovery he was the source of the &quot;World War Hate&quot;, who were shortly after joined by the X-Men and other allies. However, the Red Onslaught deployed two Adamantium Stark Sentinels which had been created by Iron Man under the influence of the Skull&#x27;s telepathy, with their creation having been wiped from his memories by the villain. Red Onslaught is eventually defeated by the combined might of Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom, that tried using their magic to perform a moral inversion on him that would allow Professor X to control the amalgamation, but their efforts backfire, causing all the heroes and villains present during the confrontation to morally invert from their usual behavior. With the Skull now reverted to a human body that is identified as the &#x27;White Skull&#x27; — implied more than once to be Professor Xavier in control of the body once again — he is hidden from the inverted Avengers by Edwin Jarvis until the aged Steve Rogers can retrieve him. Working with the inverted villains — now referring to themselves as the &#x27;Astonishing Avengers&#x27; — and with the resurrected Brother Voodoo now possessing the inverted Scarlet Witch, the White Skull is able to undo the inversion, although he simply returns to his Red Skull persona rather than Onslaught.

===Powers of X===
With the secret aid of Moira MacTaggert (who&#x27;s revealed not only alive but actually a mutant herself with the power of reincarnation), Charles Xavier and Magneto created a mutant nation on Krakoa. Moira noted on her journal that her actions in manipulating Xavier had broken his psyche and she feared this would eventually unleash something unexpected on the world. Moira&#x27;s fears were fulfilled when Xavier launched the psychic attack upon Magneto years later which created Onslaught.

===Reign of X===
Following the creation of Krakoa as a mutant nation, Nightcrawler becomes aware that a dark presence is haunting Krakoa, radically altering and influencing the minds of the young mutants and pushing them to their darker and crueler impulses on a day-to-day basis, especially in light of effective immortality. This boogieman is a mysterious figure that appears and hunts the mutants in their dreams. The youths named him the Patchwork Man and even tell campfire ghost stories of him. Believing the culprit to be his son Legion, Xavier recruits Nightcrawler to investigate and bring Legion to Krakoa. Nightcrawler eventually finds and rescues Legion from Project Orchis with the latter confirming to Nightcrawler that the Patchwork Man is none other than Onslaught, somehow restored and weaponized by Project Orchis, the secret alliance of anti-mutant scientists and politicians, in the hopes that his influence would push mutantkind into destroying themselves.

Onslaught&#x27;s return was kept a secret by Nightcrawler and Legion, out of fear of how it would lash out to protect itself if exposed. Working with Kuan-Yin Xorn and Shen Xorn, Legion tried to set a trap for the psychic entity by merging the minds of Loa and Mercury to entice him to invade. He was able to escape and caused a fight between Fabian Cortez and Lost at Stacy X&#x27;s orphanage and later possessed every mutant in the Green Lagoon during a meeting between Legion and his father, forcing David and the Xorn brothers to kill everyone there in order to free them from his control. Legion eventually deduced that as the Patchwork Man, Onslaught had been feeding on the parts of the mutants psyches that were lost during resurrection, and implanting a part of himself into the mind of every resurrected mutant.

===Onslaught Revelation===
It is eventually discovered that Orchis implanted a sliver of Onslaught&#x27;s fragment on Lost, who they had used as a test subject before. When Lost was revived, the piece of Onslaught implanted itself on every mutant on the island. Thankfully, Onslaught was discovered before his plan was completed and he moved to a new plan called the &quot;Cruciball&quot;. As mutants were being revived, Onslaught implanted the idea for a massive party where mutants would then kill each other while a mind-controlled Professor Xavier erased their minds from Cerebro. Onslaught would then eat these minds and grow infinitely stronger. When the &quot;Cruciball&quot; was foiled, Onslaught decided to take matters into his own hands and manifested himself in the physical world. Due to the fact that Magneto has become significantly peaceful and Professor Xavier has embraced his darker side, Onslaught&#x27;s new form mimics that of Professor X&#x27;s with a blood-red, Cerebro-like helmet, black bodysuit and jagged claws. He even lords over mutants in much the same way that Xavier has been doing recently. Possessing Magneto and Xavier again soon afterwards, Onslaught renew his attack on the Krakoans. However, even with his powers augmented by his first hosts, this version of Onslaught was, after all, only a sliver of the original powered up by stolen energies, therefore he was no match for Nightcrawler, Legion, and their allies, who worked together to create the Altar, Legion&#x27;s own mind organized into a functional pocket universe in the Astral Plane, where mutants could link their minds together. Under Nightcrawler&#x27;s direction they then embrace Onslaught instead of fighting him which diminished him under the weight of their very human emotional baggage. Nightcrawler then crushes the pathetic creature that Onslaught has been reduced to, apparently ending his threat once and for all.

==Powers and abilities==
Onslaught is a psionic entity with superior physical and mental power; possessing the combined abilities of both his progenitors Professor X and Magneto. He also later added the powers of Franklin Richards and Nate Grey to his own, making him even more incredibly powerful. At its prime, Onslaught is capable of telepathy, telekinesis, energy projection, sensing mutant presences, manipulating magnetic fields, mind control, flight, mental manipulation, possession, astral projection, perceiving the world around himself as patterns of magnetic and electrical energy, absorbing any mutant into his being and affecting reality itself. Onslaught can also enhance his physical size and strength.

Onslaught&#x27;s powers were well over that of Omega Level. In his first form (when he was one with Xavier), Onslaught showed a wide variety of abilities including immeasurable strength, and incredible resistance and endurance. Onslaught&#x27;s psionic powers appeared limitless, appearing to surpass even that of Xavier in his right mind. He was especially powerful in the Astral Plane, where he appeared to have god-like abilities. From what has been seen, he seems to have total mental control over anyone or anything he wishes, ranging from altering people&#x27;s perception to believe they are someone or somewhere else (he demonstrated this by making Wolverine believe he was a wolf pup, and making Storm think she was a child). Even in his initial form, he also demonstrated sufficient physical strength to punch the Juggernaut unconscious across North America and to rip the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak out of his body. Onslaught also possessed many forms of energy projection, all of which are at high levels of power.

After fully evolving into his own, separate consciousness and having Professor X ripped from him in the Astral Plane, Onslaught evolved into a second form, less resembling Magneto and looking more like a cybernetic monster. In this form, thanks to adding the full potential of Franklin Richards and Nate Grey combined, his powers were increased to god-like levels, including the ability to mass-manipulate (his complete takeover of all the Sentinels), create and reshape matter at will (shown when he created his citadel, and when he created a second sun to destroy Earth), and an apparent omniscience (as evidenced when he easily thwarted an attempt to sneak into his citadel). He could use his combined reality-warping and telekinetic abilities to boost his physical strength to the point that he was able to go toe-to-toe in a physical fight with the Hulk even after the Hulk&#x27;s mind had been blanked and his strength and rage set to incredible levels thanks to Jean Grey &#x27;shutting down&#x27; the subconscious influence that Bruce Banner normally exerted over the Hulk to stop him going too far.

For a time, Onslaught had these powers while still in his first form; the majority of these came from the absorption of Nate Grey and Franklin Richards. In the end, Onslaught&#x27;s true body was revealed to be a mass of pure, psionic energy immune to all physical attacks.

==Other versions==
===Jean Grey&#x27;s Onslaught===
When an alternate Phoenix recruits the original X-Men to stop yet another Phoenix who is using its powers to influence its world, they learn that she was from a Universe where she and the X-Men stopped Magneto, but not before the Master of Magnetism killed Professor X. In response, they began using more decisive methods to bring peace between mutants and humankind. While they stopped threats like Ultron and Annihilus, Phoenix also began controlling her allies like Tony Stark, and set her eyes on ways to increase her powers.

After being teleported to Earth-696, the original X-Men initially clashed with their older counterparts, whom they were able to convince to help them stop the Phoenix. But after Phoenix killed her world&#x27;s Cyclops, their foe is not at all what they expect, as the true entity behind Jean&#x27;s corruption is revealed not to be the Phoenix, but the psychic monstrosity known as Onslaught, born from the dark impulses of both Magneto and Jean Grey, when the later killed Magneto as retribution for his murder of Professor X. While this new version still maintains the aesthetic of the original Onslaught very much present, the main alteration comes in the form of the Phoenix emblem on the entity&#x27;s torso.

After being free of Onslaught&#x27;s influence, the Phoenix joined with her X-Men to stop Onslaught, but the psychic entity manages to escaped into the Multiverse. In order to find and kill Onslaught, the Phoenix assembled a team of Wolverines from across the multiverse while sending the original X-Men back to their home.

While the team seemed ready to take on this challenge, the Wolverine’s sang a different tune when they found themselves face-to-face with their target for the first time. While Onslaught first presented itself as an amorphous hivemind possessing countless individuals simultaneously, the villain eventually gained enough strength to take physical form - and the result was as awe-inspiring as it was absolutely terrifying. While the overall aesthetic of the original Onslaught is still very much present, the main alteration comes in the form of Phoenix fire raging from the head and upper torso. Eventually Jean is seemingly betrayed by one of her all-Wolverine team. Now lacking the strength to defeat Onslaught, she&#x27;s forced to hand over her powers, elevating the villain beyond godhood and becoming officially more powerful than everything except &quot;the truly cosmic forces of the universe&quot; aka the Universal Abstracts like Death, the Living Tribunal, and Eternity, and even that&#x27;s now in question. However, by absorbing the Phoenix Force, Onslaught&#x27;s mind is healed, resulting in a new form that is instantly remorseful for the worlds it has incinerated. It turns out this was Wolverine&#x27;s plan all along, and Onslaught grants Jean the power to send each of the team&#x27;s members to their preferred reality as reward for a job well done. He then began touring the multiverse to witness creation rather than conquer it.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel reality, Onslaught is alluded to in Professor X&#x27;s return sporting futuristic armor. Xavier was seemingly killed by the time traveling mutant &quot;Cable&quot;. However, Cable did not actually kill Xavier, but transported his unconscious body with him back to the future to keep under mental block until his questions could be answered. He healed Xavier&#x27;s spine and replaced his legs and prepared him for the coming of Apocalypse, led by his avatar Sinister.

Xavier tried fighting Apocalypse and failed. He was barely saved when Jean merged with the Phoenix God and defeated the powerful mutant. But she pointed out to Xavier that because of him, he set the mutant cause back by a hundred years. She expected him to start over and reversed time to the point where the attack never happened. Xavier later went to Muir Island to recuperate with Moira MacTaggert.

===X-Men &#x27;92===
During the battle against the Shadow King (who was possessing Cassandra Nova) in the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Professor X faced Shadow King on the Astral Plane in the form of Onslaught.

===Marvel vs. Capcom=== 
Before becoming Onslaught this reality, Professor Xavier subconsciously summons the heroes from the Capcom universe to help him regain his form. As with the comics, the battle against Onslaught came at a cost as one of the game’s playable characters, Jin Saotome and Captain America, end up sacrificing themselves to ensure his defeat.

<text>is the central fictional character from the manga series &quot;Inuyasha&quot;, created by Rumiko Takahashi. He is a half-demon, half-human from the Sengoku period of Japan. He later appeared in the anime sequel series &quot;Yashahime&quot;.

== Concept and creation ==
When Rumiko Takahashi began the series, the only ideas she had were Inuyasha being sealed by Kikyō and his sword being a relic from his father, everything after that was thought up on a weekly basis. Inuyasha&#x27;s name simply comes from the fact that he is part dog (&quot;inu&quot; in Japanese) and part &quot;yasha&quot;.

In June 2001, the author said that she did not know what would come of Inuyasha and Kagome&#x27;s back-and-forth relationship, but that she did intend for it to have a resolution. She also said that she purposely avoided having those two and Kikyō appear at the same time, as Inuyasha always likes &quot;the girl he is with&quot; more.

When asked which chapters of the series she enjoyed drawing the most, Takahashi cited the one with Inuyasha in his black-haired human form during the new moon because it was &quot;new and fun&quot; and the chapters where Inuyasha came to the present-day because she could take a break from drawing battles and show &quot;some fun and laughter,&quot; among others.

From the earliest of production meetings for the anime adaptation, Takahashi&#x27;s only request was that Kappei Yamaguchi voice Inuyasha. Due to the use of unusual names in the series, Yamaguchi and many of the other actors often wondered how to pronounce certain names, such as Kikyō and Shikon Jewel.

==Appearances==
Inuyasha is a hybrid of human and dog yōkai who first appears sealed to a tree in the feudal world. When a girl named Kagome Higurashi is being chased by a yōkai, Inuyasha convinces her to free him so that he might eliminate the enemy. Despite initially distrusting Kagome, Inuyasha joins forces with her to search for the shards of the Jewel of Four Souls, the Shikon Jewel, which increase a yōkai&#x27;s powers. Although Inuyasha first aims to become a full demon using the Jewel, as the story progresses he develops strong bonds with the comrades who aid him.

Inuyasha&#x27;s appearance is a mixture of his dog demon father and human mother: he has his father&#x27;s long silver hair, yellow eyes, and claws, but does not exhibit facial markings in his half-breed form, or pointed humanoid ears, instead he has a unique pair of furry silver dog ears on top his head. As a dog demon, Inuyasha has claws he uses to fight with, utilized mainly in his attack. Although a half-breed, a hanyō, Inuyasha&#x27;s strong demon heritage inherited from his father affords him supernatural physical attributes and resilience; he possesses raw strength as well as speed and reflexes considerably superior to that of all lower-level and the majority of middle or even higher-level yōkai. His physical prowess combined with willpower and swordsmanship allows him to challenge even the stronger higher-level yōkai. His durability and regenerative abilities are similar to those of yōkai and allow him to endure severe pain and recover quickly from wounds as well as extending his lifespan by hundreds of years. The disadvantage of his demon blood (at least when he does not possess Tessaiga) is that it overtakes his human soul in near-death situations, making him stronger but also causing him to turn into a mindless killing machine, making him just as dangerous to friends as enemies. Although the usual way to reverse the transformation is to give Inuyasha Tessaiga and wait for him to calm down, Kagome&#x27;s purifying abilities have also been shown to clear Inuyasha&#x27;s mind when she touches him.

Due to his half-breed blood, Inuyasha temporarily loses all his demon traits and powers on the night of a new moon, effectively becoming completely human. Early in the series, Inuyasha acquires , a powerful sword made from a fang of his father that can absorb demonic powers and energy. This proves to be useful to keep Inuyasha from falling victim to demonic nature turning him into a berserker. Over the course of the series, Inuyasha develops Tessaiga&#x27;s signature , and techniques. Eventually, Inuyasha gains a new ability from the sword Dakki to become the Dragon-scaled and have the to absorb the demon vortex, and in that Sesshōmaru prepared for him as part of their father&#x27;s design.

== Background ==
Born to a dog-demon father and a human mother, Inuyasha is a dog demon/human hybrid who initially wanted to use the enormous power of the Shikon Jewel to become a full-fledged demon. Inuyasha lived with his mother Izayoi when he was a child. After his father died saving Inuyasha and Izayoi, the two lived together; however, the circumstances of Inuyasha&#x27;s youth and any details of how long his mother was alive for or what happened to her is never revealed, but he was shown to have had an isolated childhood, shunned by humans for his demon blood. After the death of his mother when he was a child, Inuyasha grew up isolated and alone, having to deal with demons&#x27; and humans&#x27; hatred toward him and hardship.

Inuyasha met and fell in love with the priestess Kikyō, who was tasked with protecting the Shikon no Tama (Sacred Jewel), a powerful jewel that could grant a wish and that Inuyasha believed could make him a full demon. Through interacting with Kikyō, who was also living a lonely and isolated life, Inuyasha relinquished his dream of being a full demon and instead he and Kikyō planned for him to use the Shikon Jewel to become a human so that he could live with her. However, the jealous Naraku, who lusted after Kikyō and the jewel, manipulated them into believing they had been betrayed by one another. Before Kikyō died, she shot Inuyasha with a sealing arrow that bound him to the Sacred Tree. Inuyasha remained there for 50 years, until Kagome Higurashi pulled out the arrow, breaking the seal. When the Shikon Jewel, which had previously been embedded in Kagome&#x27;s body, is shattered into fragments that scatter across feudal Japan, Inuyasha and Kagome travel together to retrieve the shards with Inuyasha once again seeking it to turn into a full-fledged demon. While Inuyasha initially sees Kagome as merely a tool with which to retrieve the shards of the jewel, Inuyasha and Kagome grow closer over time and he begins to fall in love with her. Others such as the fox demon Shippō and the rambunctious monk Miroku as well as Sango the demon slayer, later join the duo in their quest. Inuyasha eventually discovers that the events surrounding Kikyō&#x27;s death were a result of Naraku tricking him and Kikyō, forcing them to turn against each other. Inuyasha&#x27;s quest changes over time from looking for the Shikon Jewel shards to trying to defeat Naraku. In the end, three years after Naraku&#x27;s death, he reunited with Kagome after the Bone-Eater&#x27;s Well was reconnected and married her.

== Reception ==
Inuyasha has been popular within Japanese fans. In the &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine from August 2001, he was voted as the second best male character losing to Spike Spiegel from &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. In 2002, Inuyasha won the &quot;Animage&quot; Anime Grand Prix for Best Male Character. In the next year, he was third behind Kira Yamato and Athrun Zala both from &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;. He was sixth in the following poll. A 2019 NHK poll of 210,061 people saw Inuyasha voted the favorite character from all of Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s works.

Critical reception has been mixed. Derrick L. Tucker of &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; praised the characterization of Inuyasha and other main characters, identifying it as a key reason why story elements such as the love triangle between Inuyasha, Kikyo and Kagome are able to evoke significant audience emotional response. In a review of the second manga volume, Megan Lavey from &quot;Mania Beyond Entertainment&quot; commented that the character&#x27;s development was depicted for the first time as the story began to explore why Inuyasha is often angry and has difficulty trusting others. Inuyasha and Kagome were praised by &quot;Mania&quot; writer Chris Beveridge for how well they act together in contrast to the leads of &quot;Ranma ½&quot;. Writing later for the &quot;Fandom Post&quot;, Beveridge explained how it was fun seeing Inuyasha in the modern world and the impact it has on Kagome. Similarly, Holly Ellingwood from &quot;Active Anime&quot; particularly enjoyed the comedy that occurs when Inuyasha visits the modern world following Kagome. Despite noting how several characters had similar faces, &quot;Anime News Network&quot;&#x27;s Zac Bertschy noted that Inuyasha stood out thanks to his clothes. Anime News Network felt the character became a less interesting anti-hero as the plot progressed and criticized the handling of his dynamic with Kagome due to the repetitive romantic tension despite both often arguing. John Sinnott from &quot;DVD Talk&quot; noted how examined was Inuyasha including his heritage and use of his sword that could create a big impact.

Briana Lawerence from Mania Entertainment was harsher in regards to these situation as the narrative continuously focused on this triangle for multiple seasons, leaving her the desire for Inuyasha to decide a love interest because she found the character annoying as a result. In her book &quot;Anime from Akira to Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot;, scholar Susan J. Napier analysed how certain lessons in the series relate to Inuyasha&#x27;s representation of masculinity. Academic Caroline Ruddell analysed use of movement in the anime. In combat scenes Inuyasha is often slowed or frozen, against the moving background, to foreground his emotional and physical vulnerability. Close-up shots of his face and head place further focus on these aspects and on the character (rather than the narrative), particularly his facial expressions, while wide shots showing his whole body are used to depict his strength. Together, the techniques show the different facets of his hybrid nature. According to Rudell, Inuyasha is stylized as an anti-hero or &quot;tsundere&quot;. IGN&#x27;s D. F. Smith praised the voice acting of Richard Cox as &quot;he does a fine job getting the character&#x27;s rough-edged, angry mode of speech across, even without being able to stick &quot;yarou&quot; at the end of every sentence.&quot; Anime News Network also found Cox as the most appealing members from the English dub, describing his take on the protagonist as &quot;arrogant punk&quot;.

<text>A military discharge is given when a member of the armed forces is released from their obligation to serve. Each country&#x27;s military has different types of discharge. They are generally based on whether the persons completed their training and then fully and satisfactorily completed their term of service. Other types of discharge are based on factors such as the quality of their service, whether their service had to be ended prematurely due to humanitarian or medical reasons, whether they had been found to have drug or alcohol dependency issues and whether they were complying with treatment and counseling, and whether they had demerits or punishments for infractions or were convicted of any crimes. These factors affect whether they will be asked or allowed to re-enlist and whether they qualify for benefits after their discharge.

==United Kingdom==
There are several reasons why someone may be discharged from the military, including expiration of enlistment, disability, dependency and hardship.

Members of the British Armed Forces are to complete their service obligations before they may be considered for discharge. Service personnel who attempt to leave before completing their length of service, without going through the appropriate channels, may be subject to a criminal conviction.

At the end of service in the Regular Forces, personnel normally have a compulsory reserve liability. The length of this liability depends on the Service, rank and type of commission or engagement in which they entered and whether they are subject to the Reserve Forces Act 1980 (c. 9) or Reserve Forces Act 1996.

===British Army===
;Types of discharge
*Normal Service Leaver: personnel who A) are leaving on completion of engagement; B) have been given notice to leave, or C) been given notice of discharge under redundancy.
*Early Service Leaver: personnel who have been discharged either A) compulsorily from the trained or untrained strength, or B) at their own request from the trained strength or untrained strength having completed less than 4 years of service.
*Medical Discharge / Retirement: service is being terminated on medical grounds. Personnel would have attended a Medical Board that recommended the person&#x27;s services be terminated on medical grounds.

Army officers and other ranks must be interviewed by at least one of the following:
*Unit Welfare Officer
*Regimental Career Management Officer
*Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM)
*Regimental Administrative Officer
*Commanding Officer (CO)
*Unit Resettlement Information Staff

===Naval Service===
Individuals in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines who are not due for compulsory retirement but who wish to leave the Service, for whatever reason, before reaching the end of their Commission/Career/Engagement may apply for Early Termination, provided the conditions outlined in Chapter 54 of &quot;BR 3 - Naval Personnel Management&quot; are met. Within the Naval Service, the term &quot;retirement&quot; applies to officers who complete the period of service required by their respective commissions. For officers of the trained strength, recommendations for termination of a commission must generally be reviewed by the Admiralty Board.

*Early Termination: Officers may apply to leave (voluntarily withdraw from training) up to their Premature Termination of Career Training (PTCT) point, which is generally before the day they pass out of Britannia Royal Naval College, and also depends on their speciality. Ratings and Other Ranks have a &quot;statutory right of discharge&quot; after six months&#x27; service or after they turn 18.
*Invaliding: Personnel may be &quot;invalided out&quot; if they are found &quot;permanently unfit for full naval service&quot; by the Naval Service Medical Board of Survey (NSMBOS).

*Resignation: This is a common civilian term used to refer to the termination of one&#x27;s commission but in the Naval Service, the term &quot;resignation&quot; has a &quot;special meaning&quot;. Despite common usage of the term, officers do not legally have the right to resign their commission. However, they may be permitted to do so under extenuating circumstances, at the discretion of their CO and with permission from the Admiralty Board. Resignation is appropriate when an officer wishes to sever all connection with the Service. Circumstances that would warrant resignation rather than the other types of discharge are where an individual holds actions or beliefs/attitudes that fundamentally conflict with the concept of military service. The primary consideration of the Admiralty Board&#x27;s acceptance of resignation is the best interests of the Service. Officers who resign their commissions are not liable to serve in the Reserves but certain benefits such as retired pay and resettlement grant may be affected.

Other types of discharges include:
*Compulsory Withdrawal from Training (CWFT): When an officer&#x27;s performance – whether professional, character or leadership – falls below the standard required, even after all appropriate warnings have been applied, this type of discharge may be invoked. Young Officers (YO) (officers in training) at the Britannia Royal Naval College or Commando Training Centre Royal Marines and Officer Candidates promoted from the Lower Deck who fail to complete initial training can also be subjected to a CWFT. Pilots undergoing professional training would be suspended from flying duties.
*Administrative Discharge: Officers whose performance or conduct falls below the standard required may be discharged from the Active List. 
**Incapacity Due to Causes beyond the Officer&#x27;s Control
**Unsuitability Due to Causes within the Officer&#x27;s Control: service personnel (both officers and ratings) may be discharged on grounds of &quot;temperamental unsuitability&quot; (TU). The RN BR3 handbook defines TU as &quot;a persistent and obvious failure by the individual to adapt to the basic, but unique demands of Service life&quot;.
**Misconduct
*Dismissal: Officers charged with offences under the Military Discipline Legislation. In exceptional cases, officers may be &quot;dismissed with disgrace&quot;.
*Compassionate discharge: There are several types of compassionate discharges. Such a discharge is granted for Ratings who seek a discharge due to extenuating personal circumstances.

==United States==
Most often, when someone leaves the US military, they are separated, not discharged. Enlisting in the US military generally entails an eight-year commitment, served with a combination of active and reserve service. Individuals who voluntarily separate from active duty with fewer than eight years normally fulfill the balance of their term in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). In the U.S., discharge or separation is not military retirement; personnel who serve for 20 years or longer are retired, and are transferred to the Retired Reserve. Members who are seriously disabled are also retired (receiving what is referred to as a Medical Retirement) rather than discharged.

Typical reasons for discharge (with or without an administrative board hearing):
* Expiration of Term of Service (ETS)
* Failure to meet physical fitness standards
* Reaching the maximum age limit
* High Year Tenure (reaching the maximum allowable time in grade, and not selected for promotion)
* Disability, dependency, or hardship
* Pregnancy/parenthood
* Personality disorder
* Medical conditions not considered disabilities
* Physical or mental conditions that interfere with military service, resulting in placement on the Temporary or Permanent Disability Retirement Lists
* Convenience of the Government/Secretarial Authority (voluntary redundancy due to funding cutbacks, for example)
* Unsuitability for military service
* Misconduct – Minor disciplinary infractions
* Misconduct – Drug use, possession, or distribution 
* Misconduct – Commission of a serious offense
* Entry-level performance and conduct
* Resignation (available to officers only)
* Reduction in Force (RIF)
* Entry Level Separation (ELS). Uncharacterized (neither Good nor Bad Conduct) if discharged within the first 180 days of service and no misconduct is found in the service member&#x27;s record
* Punitive Discharges 
** Bad Conduct Discharge (BCD) issued by either Special Court Martial or General Court Martial only. 
** Dishonorable Discharge issued by a General Court Martial only

If discharged administratively for any of the above reasons, the service member normally receives an Honorable discharge, a General (Under Honorable Conditions) discharge, or an Under Other Than Honorable Conditions (UOTHC) discharge service characterization.

To receive an honorable discharge, a service member must have received a rating from good to excellent for their service. Service members who meet or exceed the required standards of duty performance and personal conduct, and who complete their tours of duty, normally receive honorable discharges. A dishonorable discharge (DD) is a punitive discharge that can only be handed down at a general court-martial after conviction(s) of serious offenses (e.g., felony-like crimes such as desertion before an enemy, drug distribution, sexual assault, murder, etc.) by a military judge or panel (jury).

Career U.S. military members who retire are not separated or discharged. Upon retirement, officers and enlisted personnel are transferred to the Retired Reserve. For Active Duty personnel, until they reach a cumulative 30 years of service, active plus retired reserve combined, they are subject to recall to active duty by order of the president. In addition, a military member who becomes disabled due to an injury or illness is medically retired if: 1) The member is determined to be unfit &quot;… to perform duties of the member&#x27;s office, grade, rank or rating ...&quot;; 2) Whose disability is determined to be permanent and stable; 3) Is either rated at a minimum of 30% disabled, or the member has 20 years of military service. Medical retirees are transferred to the Retired Reserve with the same retired pay and benefits as 20+ year retirees. Medically retired personnel are not subject to recall to active duty.

=== Administrative discharges ===

====Entry level separation (ELS) or Uncharacterized discharge====

Entry level separations, which are accompanied by an uncharacterized discharge, are given to individuals who separate prior to completing 180 days of military service or when discharge action was initiated prior to 180 days of service. The vast majority of these administrative separations occur during recruit training or &quot;boot camp&quot;. This type of discharge (over 19,000 in 2019) does not attempt to characterize service as good or bad. Rather, an uncharacterized discharge is the absence of a characterization of service, as the individual being discharged does not have sufficient time in service in order to fairly characterize the individual&#x27;s service. However, this type of discharge often attaches a reason such as pregnancy, performance in training, or medical issues. An individual with an ELS may, under certain conditions, be allowed to re-enlist in the military.

During the drafting of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, the House of Representatives passed Congresswoman Elaine Luria&#x27;s amendment to accompany H.R.6395 that required the United States Armed Forces to report on the number of service members subject to the misuse of the uncharacterized discharge since 2001. However, the amendment was removed by the Senate.

====Honorable discharge====
To receive an honorable discharge, service members must have received a rating from good to excellent for their service. Service members who meet or exceed most of the required standards of duty performance, committed no or minimal misconduct, and who complete their tours of duty, normally receive honorable discharges. 

However, it is not necessary to complete a full term of service to receive an honorable discharge, as long as the discharge is not due to misconduct. For instance, service members rendered physically or psychologically incapable of performing assigned duties normally have their service characterized as honorable, regardless of whether they incurred the condition or disability in the line of duty, provided they otherwise met or exceeded standards. Similarly, service members selected for involuntary discharge due to a Reduction in Force (RIF) typically receive an honorable discharge, assuming their conduct while on active duty met or exceeded standards. Individuals with honorable discharges will also, under certain circumstances, be allowed to re-enlist in the US military.

According to AR 635-200, paragraph 9–4, &quot;The service of Soldiers discharged under this section will be characterized as honorable or under honorable conditions unless the Soldier is in entry-level status and an uncharacterized description of service is required. An honorable discharge is mandated in any case in which the Government initially introduces into the final discharge process limited use evidence as defined by AR 600–85, paragraph 6–4. (See para 2–6h for procedures for reinitiation or rehearing, if appropriate.)&quot;

====General discharge====
General discharges—more formally referred to as a &quot;General (Under Honorable Conditions)&quot;—are given to service members who engaged in minor to moderate misconduct, or performed satisfactorily but failed to meet performance standards expected of military members. Reasons for such a characterization of service vary, and are used by the unit commander as a means to correct unacceptable behavior prior to initiating discharge action (unless the reason is drug abuse, in which case discharge is often mandatory). A commander must disclose the reasons for the discharge action in writing to the service member, and must explain reasons for recommending the service be characterized as General. The service member is normally required to sign a statement acknowledging receipt and understanding of the notification of pending discharge memorandum. In the case of drug-related offenses, the person is also advised of the right to seek counsel and present supporting statements.

In addition, service members are required to sign documents acknowledging that &quot;substantial prejudice in civilian life&quot; may be encountered under a general discharge. Members who receive a general discharge jeopardize a number of VA benefits or entitlements such as eligibility to participate in the GI Bill, service on veterans&#x27; commissions, and other programs for which an honorable discharge is required. They may lose eligibility to re-enlist, but they will remain eligible for most or all of the &quot;standard&quot; VA benefits, such as disability and health care.

Federal and state laws, such as Illinois through the Illinois Human Rights Act, prohibit discrimination against a veteran from housing or employment on the basis of unfavorable discharge from military service, as long as a veteran does not receive a dishonorable discharge.

====Under Other Than Honorable Conditions (UOTHC) Discharge====
A UOTHC (often further abbreviated and referred to as a &quot;UO&quot;) discharge represents a significant departure from the conduct and performance expected of all military members, and is issued for more serious or repeated misconduct, such as assaults, security violations, excessive trouble with authorities, and illegal possession, use, or sale of drugs.

Generally, in order to receive VA benefits and services, the veteran&#x27;s character of discharge or service must be characterized as better than a UOTHC or not be punitive (BCD or DD). However, individuals receiving an UO, BCD, or DD will have their service reviewed by the VA. In some cases, certain statutory and regulatory bars may not apply, and a servicemember may still be allowed access to VA benefits and services. The VA adjudication of a person&#x27;s service characterization, including examination of these bars, is called a &quot;Character of Discharge&quot; (COD) review (sometimes referred to as a &quot;Character of Service Determination (CSD)&quot;), as defined by 38 USC 5305B.

Veterans with an UOTHC discharge and considered &quot;Honorable for VA purposes&quot; may still apply for the full enrollment in the VA. Assuming most or all other eligibility criteria are met, they will receive medical benefits, disability benefits, vocational programs, and other wrap-around services. Once the VA has deemed an UOTHC discharge &quot;Honorable for VA Purposes&quot; it is similar to having a General discharge in terms of benefits and services.

&quot;Honorable for VA Purposes&quot; is not the same as an Honorable discharge or General discharge, and does not necessarily upgrade one&#x27;s discharge to Honorable or General, and therefore does not necessarily qualify one for education benefits. However, even if someone has an UOTHC discharge, they may still qualify, such as through other periods of service that qualify them as &quot;Honorable for VA Purposes&quot;, for education benefits.

Veterans with Other Than Honorable discharges who are deemed &quot;Dishonorable for VA Purposes&quot; because of a regulatory bar may still qualify for health care, but only for service-related condition or injuries. If the veteran is barred for statutory reasons, even this limited health care is not available.

Additionally, most veterans with an UOTHC discharge cannot re-enlist or use the GI Bill.

====Clemency discharge====

By Presidential Proclamation 4313, President Gerald Ford created a procedure for those military personnel who resisted the Vietnam War to receive a presidential pardon and have their punitive discharges changed to a Clemency discharge. It also provided a path for those who left the country to return. If the military personnel fulfilled certain requirements of alternative service, they would also receive a Certificate of Completion from the Selective Service System.

=== Punitive discharges ===
Punitive discharges are imposed for conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline.

====Bad Conduct Discharge (BCD)====

A Bad Conduct Discharge, colloquially referred to as a &quot;big chicken dinner&quot; or &quot;big crazy duck&quot;, from the initialism, can only be given by a court-martial (either special or general) as a punishment for an enlisted service member. Bad conduct discharges may be preceded by a period of confinement in a military prison. The discharge itself is not issued until completion of the appellate review process, or in the cases of discharges involving a prison sentence, completion of both the sentence and the appellate review process.

Many or all veterans&#x27; benefits are forfeited in the case of a Bad Conduct Discharge, and those discharged through a general court-martial will also not be eligible for disability compensation. Even then, although these veterans can still receive health care, they will not be able to do so through the VA.

====Dishonorable discharge (DD)====
A dishonorable discharge, colloquially referred to as a &quot;duck dinner&quot;, is the worst type of discharge in the US military. It can only be handed down to a military member by a general court-martial: dishonorable discharges are rendered by conviction from a general court-martial for exceptionally serious offenses (e.g., treason, espionage, desertion, sexual assault, or murder).

With a dishonorable discharge, all or almost all benefits are forfeited, regardless of any past honorable service, and this type of discharge is regarded as shameful in the military. As with many bad conduct discharges, dishonorable discharges are normally preceded by military prison sentences and are formally issued after completion of both confinement and the appellate review process. In the rare event that a court-martial imposes a death sentence, the dishonorable discharge will be given out on the day prior to the condemned soldier being put to death.

In most states, a dishonorable discharge is deemed the equivalent of a felony conviction, with the concomitant loss of many civil rights. Veterans who have been dishonorably discharged lose the ability to own firearms, work government jobs and receive government assistance and loans, and in some jurisdictions also to vote, hold public office, or serve in a jury. Additionally, since government aid is normally not available and bank loans are very difficult to obtain for those with dishonorable discharges, veterans who are dishonorably discharged often find attending post-secondary education difficult, and many have a difficult time finding work once they return to civilian life.

US federal law also prohibits possession of ammunition, firearms, or explosives by those who have been dishonorably discharged. Per the Gun Control Act of 1968, being dishonorably discharged is also a disqualifying question on ATF Form 4473, which must be completed and signed to purchase a firearm from a Federal Firearms Licensee, and in most cases will result in a denial by the Brady background check that must be performed and passed to allow a sale.

===Statistics===
According to the Department of Defense, of 207,000 service members that were discharged in 2014, more than 18,000 (9%) were issued less-than-honorable paperwork, with 4143 veterans (2.0%) receiving other-than-honorable discharges, 637 (0.31%) receiving bad conduct discharges, and 157 (0.08%) receiving dishonorable discharges. Between 2000 and 2014, 352,000 people in all were handed similar papers, ranging from general to dishonorable.

===Analogous proceedings for commissioned officers===
Commissioned officers cannot be reduced in rank by a court-martial, nor can they be given a bad conduct discharge or a dishonorable discharge. If an officer is convicted by a general court-martial, then that officer&#x27;s sentence can include a &quot;dismissal&quot;, a separation carrying the same consequences as a dishonorable discharge for an enlisted person and a reduction in rank to the last rank at which the officer served satisfactorily. A US Treasury decision states that even though an officer is dismissed rather than dishonorably discharged, the phrase &quot;discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions&quot; is broad enough to include a dismissal rendered for an officer by a general court-martial, and thus an officer dismissed under dishonorable conditions is also prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition under federal law, in the same manner as someone with a dishonorable discharge.

If a court-martial convicts an officer but imposes a sentence that does not include a dismissal, the secretary of the officer&#x27;s service branch may drop that officer from the roll (official list) of officers in that branch. Such a separation is characterized as administrative rather than punitive.

===Appeal procedures===
After discharge, a service member (or their next-of-kin, if the service member is deceased) can appeal the type of discharge that was given.

The member must file form DD-293 if discharged within 15 years, or form DD-149 if over 15 years ago. The forms are significantly different and go to the Discharge Review Board (DRB) and the Board for correction of military records (BCMR) respectively. provide the law for this action.

The service member (or their next of kin if the service member is deceased) must submit evidence for error, impropriety or inequity in discharge. Most appeals are rejected, however, and changes are authorized only if it can be proven the service member was unfairly denied an honorable characterization.

====Appellate review of punitive discharges====
Any punitive discharge adjudged by a court-martial is automatically reviewed by a military appellate court for each respective branch. These are the Army Court of Criminal Appeals (ACCA), Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA), Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCCA), and the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals (CGCCA). These courts are staffed by appellate military judges and function as an intermediate appellate court and have the power to review de novo both any questions of legal error and the factual basis of the conviction. If either the government or the accused is dissatisfied with the results of this appeal, the conviction or the sentence can be appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF). This court has the power of discretionary review, in that it can in some cases deny a petition to grant a review. This court however must hear any death penalty cases or cases certified by the Judge Advocate General of each respective service for appellate review. Litigants before the CAAF can appeal to the United States Supreme Court. However, this right only applies to any case that the CAAF has reviewed. Therefore, in most military justice cases, the CAAF is the court of last resort since a denial of a petition of review by that court prevents higher appeal.

Servicemembers who are given a punitive discharge and have completed any adjudged confinement are normally placed on appellate leave pending final review of their cases by the appellate courts. This includes members who plead guilty at their courts-martial since all cases are automatically reviewed. The member is considered on active duty and is subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice while on appellate leave. While the member is entitled to full health care benefits and other privileges of being on active duty, the member receives no pay or allowances and is relieved of any military duties.

A service member who was adjudged a punitive discharge at a court martial and then dies before the appellate review process is complete is considered to have died on active duty under honorable conditions. Their next-of-kin is then entitled to any rights and benefits to which any other service member&#x27;s family would be entitled.

====Upgrade of administrative discharges and special court-martial BCDs====
Once discharge is finalized, General, Entry-Level/Uncharacterized, and Under Other-Than-Honorable Conditions (UOTHC or OTH) discharges may be appealed for upgrade through the Discharge Review Board of the respective service; however, the appeal must be filed within 15 years of the date of separation, and it must be shown that the characterization of service was the result of an error or injustice. Bad Conduct Discharges handed down by a Special Court-Martial may be upgraded only as an act of clemency. Discharge Review Boards may also consider appeals for a change to the Narrative Reason for Discharge (in Block 28 of DD 214). The DRB does not consider a request for the change of a Reenlistment Eligibility (RE) or Separation Designator (SPD) Code by itself, but they are often changed to correspond with the new characterization of service and/or narrative reason for discharge if a discharge is upgraded.

If more than 15 years have passed since discharge, appeals must be directed to the Board For Correction of Military/Naval Records of the respective service. The BCM/NR hears a wide array of appeals and correction requests, and can be used by Active Duty, Reserve, National Guard, retired and discharged veterans alike. Normally, an appeal must be filed within three years of the occurrence of an error or injustice; however, exceptions are often made.

In the United States, every service member who is discharged or released from active duty is issued a DD Form 214 and a military discharge certificate (denoting the discharge type). A reservist who is called to active duty is given a DD 214 when he or she is deactivated and returned to the reserves. Those who are discharged before completing 8 years of active duty or reserve duty in an active drilling status are transferred to the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) for the remainder of their military service obligations (MSO). The Individual Ready Reserve does not drill or receive pay; however, a member in IRR status can be recalled to active duty during time of war or national emergency until the 8 years have expired. Most members separating with an honorable discharge after completing a single term of service (typically 3–6 years) are transferred to the IRR for the remainder of the 8-year MSO. Retirees are furnished with the DD 214, though a U.S. military retirement is not characterized as a discharge as retirees may be recalled to active duty, under certain circumstances, until they have achieved a total of 30 years of service.

The DD 214 is a summary of military service. It contains total time in service, dates of entry and discharge, dates of rank, documentation of foreign service, ribbons, medals and badges awarded, professional military education completed, characterization of service, and reason for discharge. In responses to job applications, many employers request a copy of the DD 214. There are two DD 214 types: the deleted (or &quot;short&quot;) version, and the undeleted (or &quot;long&quot;) version. The deleted version omits certain information, including the reason for discharge.

Employers often request the unedited version, but the legality of this is debatable in certain situations. It can be denied, especially if the &quot;long&quot; version references facts that violate the right to privacy or could be used in a discriminatory fashion (such as non-relevant psychological, medical, or disability issues) explicitly cited as illegal by federal or state hiring laws. For example, the Illinois Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination due to unfavorable discharge. A service member may request the edited, unedited, or both versions on separation.

Since the 1970s, an honorably discharged veteran receives a frameable certificate (DD 256). A similar one is issued to someone granted a general discharge (DD 257). For each certificate, one or more letters after the number indicate the branch of service that issued it. For example, a &quot;256A&quot; is awarded by the Army. Other certificates for long service, or to eligible spouses of veterans, may also be presented.

The Freedom of Information Act has made (limited) records of military service available to the public, on request. However, information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 can be released only with the veteran&#x27;s consent.

====Military discharge uniform insignia====
During wartime the American military have often issued special insignia to honorably discharged veterans to wear on their uniforms, in order to distinguish them from local service personnel or deserters.

The Army issued red Discharge Chevrons during and after World War One (1917–1919) that were worn point-up on the lower right sleeve of the tunic or overcoat. Just before and just after World War Two (September 1939 – December 1946) the Army issued the Honorable Discharge Insignia (or &quot;Ruptured Duck&quot;). It was an eagle in a circle badge sewn in yellow thread on an olive drab diamond that was worn over the right breast pocket on the &quot;Class A&quot; dress tunic.

Since 1916 the Marine Corps has issued an Honorable Discharge Lapel Button that is meant to be worn with civilian clothes. During World War II, from 1941 to 1945, a contrasting diamond was worn on the lower right sleeve with the Dress Blues or Dress Whites (a white diamond on the Dress Blues and a blue diamond on the Dress Whites) by retired Marines. A white diamond was worn on the upper right shoulder (like a Distinctive Unit Insignia) on the Service Green or Service Khaki &quot;Alphas&quot; and the overcoat by discharged Marines.

===Reenlistment Eligibility Code===
Another important aspect is the RE (Reenlistment Eligibility) Code. This specifies under what conditions the member can reenlist in the armed forces. The definition of each RE Code may vary from Service to Service, as currently it is the responsibility of each branch of the Armed Forces to establish reenlistment eligibility criteria. As a general rule, however, an RE Code in the &quot;1&quot; series allows reenlistment into any component of the Armed Forces, and an RE Code in the &quot;3&quot; series usually lets the veteran reenlist with a waiver. RE Codes in the &quot;2&quot; series often place restrictions on reenlistment: this is especially true in the Air Force, which has a policy permanently barring airmen separated from the Air Force with an RE Code 2 from reenlisting in the Air Force (though reenlistment into other components of the Armed Forces may be possible with a waiver). An RE Code in the &quot;4&quot; series typically bars reenlistment into any component of the Armed Forces. (It is possible for a person with an RE Code of 4 to enlist in the Navy or Air Force if the SPD Code and the Narrative Reasoning is waivable.) A veteran issued an RE Code in the &quot;4&quot; series usually requires an Exception to Policy waiver to reenlist.

The Department of Veterans Affairs uses different criteria from the Departments of the Air Force, Army, and Navy when establishing veteran status. VA benefits, such as the VA&#x27;s health care and home loan programs, can sometimes be enjoyed if the veteran&#x27;s conduct was not dishonorable.

<doc id="586931" wikidata="Q437003" url="?curid=586931" title="Catherine Wolfe Bruce">
<text>Catherine Wolfe Bruce (January 22, 1816, New York – March 13, 1900, New York) was a noted American philanthropist and patron of astronomy.

==Early life==
Bruce was born on January 22, 1816. She was the daughter of the George Bruce (1781–1866), a famous type founder who was born in Edinburgh, and Catherine Wolfe (1785–1861), the daughter of David Wolfe (1748–1836) of New York City. One of five children, her brother was David Wolfe Bruce (1824–1895), who, along with David Wolfe Bishop, inherited the fortune of their cousin, Catharine Lorillard Wolfe.

==Career==

She studied painting, learned Latin, German, French and Italian, and was familiar with the literature of those languages.

In 1890, she wrote and published a translation of the &quot;&quot;Dies Irae&quot;.&quot;

==Personal life==
Due to an ever-increasing illness, she was confined to her home and died on March 13, 1900, at 810 Fifth Avenue in New York City.

===Philanthropy===

In 1877, she donated $50,000 for the construction of a library building and the purchase of books in memory of her father. The library, known as &quot;The George Bruce Library&quot; was completed in 1888 and was located at 226 West 42nd Street and designed by G. E. Harney. The building was sold in 1913 and the proceeds were used to build the current George Bruce library located on 125th Street in Harlem and designed by Carrère &amp; Hastings.

As an amateur astronomer, she turned to philanthropy in this field at the age of 73, only after reading an article by Simon Newcomb claiming all the major discoveries in astronomy have occurred. Bruce turned to telescope maker Alvan Graham Clark to see how she could support research in astronomy.

Bruce made over 54 gifts to astronomy, totaling over $275,000, between 1889 and 1899. She donated funds to the Harvard College Observatory (U.S.A.), Yerkes Observatory (U.S.A.) and Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl (Germany), run by Max Wolf at the time, to buy new telescopes at each of those institutes. In 1887, she donated the &quot;George Bruce Free Library&quot;.

Bruce established the Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in recognition of lifetime achievements and contributions to astrophysics, and is one of the prestigious awards in the field.

===Honors===
Asteroid 323 Brucia, discovered by Max Wolf is named after her, as well as the crater &quot;Bruce&quot; on the Moon.
She was awarded a gold medal by the Grand Duke of Baden.

Astronomer Johann Palisa gave her the honor of naming 313 Chaldaea as a token for the gratitude of astronomers.

<doc id="586936" wikidata="Q3493680" url="?curid=586936" title="List of Indian monarchs">
<text>This article is a list of the various dynasties and monarchs that have ruled in the Indian subcontinent and it is one of several lists of incumbents.


The earliest Indian rulers are known from epigraphical sources found in archeological inscriptions on Ashokan edicts written in Pali language and using brahmi script. They are also known from the literary sources like Sanskrit literature, Jain literature and Buddhist literature in context of literary sources. Archaeological sources include archeological remains in Indian subcontinent which give many details about earlier kingdoms, monarchs, and their interactions with each other.

Early types of historic documentation include metal coins with an indication of the ruler, or at least the dynasty, at the time. These Punch-marked coins were issued around 600s BCE and are found in abundance from the Maurya Empire in 300s BCE. There are also stone inscriptions and documentary records from foreign cultures from around this time. The main imperial or quasi-imperial rulers of North India are fairly clear from this point on, but many local rulers, and the situation in the Deccan and South India has less clear stone inscriptions from early centuries. Main sources of South Indian history is Sangam Literature dated from 300s BCE. Time period of ancient Indian rulers is speculative, or at least uncertain.

=== Tomar dynasty of Delhi (c. 736–1151 CE) ===
Various historical texts provide different lists of the Tomara kings:

* Khadag Rai&#x27;s history of Gwalior (&quot;Gopācala ākhyāna&quot;) names 18 Tomara kings, plus Prithvi Pala (who is probably the Chahamana king Prithviraja III). According to Khadag Rai, Delhi was originally ruled by the legendary king Vikramaditya. It was deserted for 792 years after his death, until Bilan Dev [Veer Mahadev or Birmaha] of Tomara dynasty re-established the city (in 736 CE).
* The Kumaon-Garhwal manuscript names only 15 rulers of &quot;Toar&quot; dynasty, and dates the beginning of their rule to 789 CE (846 Vikram Samvat).
* Abul Fazl&#x27;s &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot; (Bikaner manuscript, edited by Syed Ahmad Khan) names 19 Tomara kings. It places the first Tomara king in 372 CE (429 Vikram Samvat). It might be possible that the era mentioned in the original source used by Abul Fazl was Gupta era, which starts from 318 to 319 CE; Abul Fazl might have mistaken this era to be Vikrama Samvat. If this is true, then the first Tomara king can be dated to 747 CE (429+318), which is better aligned with the other sources.

As stated earlier, the historians doubt the claim that the Tomaras established Delhi in 736 CE.
Another resource tells that the son of King Mukundpal Tomar, King Prithvipal Tomar had a son named King Govind Raj Tomar ruled for 1189 to 1192 .

<text>DragonForce are a British power metal band from London. The band was formed in 1999 by guitarists Herman Li and Sam Totman, and are known for their long and fast guitar solos, fantasy-themed lyrics and retro video game-influenced sound. The band themselves refer to their music as &quot;extreme power metal&quot;. 

DragonForce&#x27;s current lineup comprises Li, Totman, vocalist Marc Hudson, drummer Gee Anzalone and bassist Alicia Vigil. The band have been through several lineup changes throughout their career; longtime members in vocalist ZP Theart, keyboardist Vadim Pruzhanov, drummer Dave Mackintosh and bassist Frédéric Leclercq are among the former members of the band.

DragonForce has released eight studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, one live DVD and one demo. Their third album, &quot;Inhuman Rampage&quot; (2005), was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI); its lead single, &quot;Through the Fire and Flames&quot;, is their best-known song, and was featured in several video games, including &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot;. The lead single from their fourth album, &quot;Heroes of Our Time&quot;, was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2009. DragonForce has been referred to as one of the &quot;big four&quot; bands of power metal, along with Helloween, Blind Guardian, and Sabaton.

==History==

===Early years, &quot;Valley of the Damned&quot; and &quot;Sonic Firestorm&quot; (1999–2004)===

DragonForce was founded in 1999 by guitarists Herman Li and Sam Totman, under the name of DragonHeart. Totman and Li had both experienced being in a band previously, with both having come from the New Zealand heavy metal band Demoniac. The two later found vocalist ZP Theart through an advertisement, and soon acquired former Demoniac drummer Matej Setinc, bassist Steve Scott and keyboardist Steve Williams. Setinc left the band in December 1999 to continue his studies in Slovenia, so the band hired Peter Hunt to record the drums for their demo album before finding Didier Almouzni. The band also parted ways with Scott, who left to join Shadowkeep, in 2000. Williams took a small break and then later rejoined the band as they recorded their first demo with Clive Nolan as a session member on the keyboards later that year, but left once again in December 2000, days ahead of the band&#x27;s tour with Halford and Stratovarius to promote the demo, and formed his own band, Power Quest. Bassist Diccon Harper joined the band in November of that year, with keyboardist Vadim Pruzhanov joining in February 2001 to complete the lineup for recording their debut studio album.

Although it was an independent release, their demo was enough to make them one of the UK&#x27;s most popular independent power metal bands at the time. Their song &quot;Valley of the Damned&quot; was released as their debut single shortly after they changed their name permanently to DragonForce in 2002 (after finding out another power metal band already had the name DragonHeart). A promotional video featuring live footage from their tour around Europe was released along with the song. The song was also hugely successful on MP3.com, which charted as the most downloaded song at No. 1 for 2 weeks. In 2002, the band signed to Noise Records and began recording their debut album, &quot;Valley of the Damned&quot;. Harper performed the bass tracks for the album but left the band in 2002 because of a tendon problem that required surgery. The title track, re-released in promotion of the album, is one of the best-known DragonForce songs to date and is a staple of their live performances to this day. The band&#x27;s tour for &quot;Valley of the Damned&quot; lasted until 2004, with the tour ending in Tokyo, Japan.

DragonForce&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Sonic Firestorm&quot;, proved to be even more successful than their previous album, with the help of the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Fury of the Storm&quot;. &quot;Sonic Firestorm&quot; was the first DragonForce album to feature new bassist Adrian Lambert and drummer Dave Mackintosh. When Mackintosh entered the band in 2004, they began referring to their style of music as &quot;extreme power metal&quot; due to his fast blast beats and double bass rhythms. The tour was longer than the band&#x27;s previous tour for &quot;Valley of the Damned&quot; and featured many more headlining shows. The band toured with many well-known metal bands such as W.A.S.P. and Iron Maiden. On the album, they also added a video commentary focusing on the making of &quot;Sonic Firestorm&quot;.

===&quot;Inhuman Rampage&quot; and &quot;Ultra Beatdown&quot; (2005–2009)===

The band went mainstream with their third album, &quot;Inhuman Rampage&quot;, which was released on 28 December 2005 after signing with Roadrunner Records. The first song on the album, &quot;Through the Fire and Flames&quot;, is perhaps their most famous song to date and is featured on the video games &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero: Smash Hits&quot; and &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;, and as downloadable content for the &quot;Rock Band&quot; franchise. Former Demoniac frontman Lindsay Dawson appeared as a backing vocalist for the album. In November 2005, before the album&#x27;s release, Lambert left the band to raise his newborn son, and the band enlisted Frédéric Leclercq for the remainder of the &quot;Sonic Firestorm&quot; tour. Leclercq later became an official member of the band in January 2006 following the release of &quot;Inhuman Rampage&quot;, and was also featured in the band&#x27;s music video for their second single from the album, &quot;Operation Ground and Pound&quot;. The &quot;Through the Fire and Flames&quot; single later reached gold status in the USA and Canada.

DragonForce toured with Disturbed and Slipknot during the inaugural Mayhem Festival in 2008; the band then returned in autumn with the release of their fourth studio album, &quot;Ultra Beatdown&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Heroes of Our Time&quot;, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance on 3 December 2008, eventually losing out to Metallica with their song &quot;My Apocalypse&quot;. A short version of &quot;Heroes Of Our Time&quot; is also featured in the video game &quot;Skate 2&quot;, and the full version in &quot;NHL 10&quot;. On 22 January 2009, the music video for their song &quot;The Last Journey Home&quot; was released to the Xbox Live Community a week before it was released online.

The band carried out the &quot;Ultra Beatdown&quot; world tour in Europe, North America and South America. They were supposed to play in South America in May, but the tour was postponed due to the swine flu outbreak. They performed at the Two Days a Week Festival in Wiesen, Austria on 4 September, before performing in the United States and Canada from 15 September to 11 October, with special guests Sonata Arctica and Taking Dawn. The next leg of the tour was in Germany, from 16 to 30 October, followed by a single live performance in Luxembourg on 31 October. They then travelled to South America to perform in Curitiba, Porto Alegre, São Paulo, Mexico City, Santiago, Buenos Aires and Bogotá from 6–14 November. The final part of the tour was carried out entirely in the UK from 19 November to 12 December.

===Departure of Theart and &quot;Twilight Dementia&quot; (2010–2011)===
Li stated in late 2009 that DragonForce would stop touring in December and spend Christmas at home before beginning to write and record their next studio album in January. On 22 February 2010, the band re-released their first two albums, &quot;Valley of the Damned&quot; and &quot;Sonic Firestorm&quot;. &quot;Valley of the Damned&quot; included newly remixed and remastered tracks, while both albums included bonus tracks, updated packaging and DVDs featuring live footage, commentary and more. Both albums were also released in a box set which featured a T-shirt, a card of guitar picks, and an inflatable guitar.

On 8 March 2010, it was announced via the band&#x27;s record label at the time, Roadrunner, that Theart had parted ways with DragonForce due to &quot;insurmountable differences of musical opinion&quot; and that the band would be seeking a new frontman. The next day, the band released a press statement confirming the news and containing a link to request an audition.

The band released their first live album, &quot;Twilight Dementia&quot;, on 13 September 2010, in Europe and 14 September 2010 in US and Canada. The album art, title, and release date were revealed on the band&#x27;s official website on 22 June 2010. The performances were recorded on the final leg of the &quot;Ultra Beatdown&quot; world tour. Regarding the album, Li stated:

The band began working on their new studio album in early 2010, recording in various studios in California, London and the South of France. The band later confirmed that they would be the opening act for Iron Maiden in two UK shows in August 2011, with the first at Odyssey Arena in Belfast on 3 August and the second at The O2 Arena in London on 5 August. On 2 March 2011, DragonForce announced their new vocalist, Marc Hudson. Hudson had previous experience performing in a band but was not a professional musician before joining DragonForce. His first show with DragonForce was the band&#x27;s opening for Iron Maiden in August 2011, where they debuted a new song titled &quot;Cry Thunder&quot;.

===&quot;The Power Within&quot; and &quot;Maximum Overload&quot; (2012–2015)===
DragonForce released their fifth studio album, &quot;The Power Within&quot;, on 15 April 2012. Mediæval Bæbes and Pythia vocalist Emily Ovenden contributed backing vocals on the album. During their North American tour, the band performed a new song titled &quot;Fallen World&quot;, along with &quot;Cry Thunder&quot;. Starting from late September 2012, the band embarked on a UK and Ireland tour, and were supported by The Defiled, Cavorts and Alestorm. 
DragonForce also played at Soundwave Festival in Australia in February 2013.

On 12 April 2013, the band announced that writing for a follow-up to &quot;The Power Within&quot; had been completed, and on 19 May 2013, DragonForce entered Fascination Street Studios in Sweden with Jens Bogren as the producer of the band&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Maximum Overload&quot;. On 31 March 2014, it was revealed that Trivium vocalist/guitarist Matt Heafy would appear as a backing vocalist for the album, and that Ovenden would return after providing backing vocals for &quot;The Power Within&quot;. On 3 June 2014, DragonForce announced that they had parted ways with Mackintosh and had enlisted former Braindamage and Kill Ritual drummer Gee Anzalone. &quot;Maximum Overload&quot; was released in the UK on 18 August, in North America on 19 August and in Australia on 22 August. A special edition which included five bonus songs was released in Japan on 19 August (the same date as the normal edition&#x27;s release in North America) and in Australia on 22 August, at the same time as the release of the normal edition. To promote the album, the band embarked on their second world tour, beginning in Edinburgh on 17 September and ending in Brussels, Belgium, on 1 February 2015.

On 12 February, DragonForce announced that they would release their first live DVD, a recording of their performance at Loud Park Festival 2014 titled &quot;In the Line of Fire... Larger than Live&quot;. The band performed at Download Festival in June 2015, with a surprise guest appearance by Babymetal during the set., DragonForce would then act as Babymetal&#x27;s backing band at the 2015 Metal Hammer Golden Gods (Li and Totman had previously collaborated on the track &quot;Road of Resistance&quot; for Babymetal).

===&quot;Reaching into Infinity&quot; (2016–2017)===

In April 2016, the band released the compilation &quot;Killer Elite: the Hits, the Highs, the Vids&quot;, featuring a double CD of the band&#x27;s greatest hits, with a DVD that contained the videos released by the band. The band also embarked on the &quot;Killer Elite World Tour&quot; to support the release. In July 2016 DragonForce issued a statement on the health status of Marc Hudson revealing he had been signed off by doctors and was unable to perform at the Metal Days Festival in Slovenia and the Benatska! Festival in the Czech Republic and replaced by Per Fredrik Åsly for the two shows. This was than further followed up by former Power Quest vocalist Alessio Garavello filling in for the Leyendas del Rock Festival concert in Spain, and the More//Than concert in Slovakia. DragonForce concluded their &quot;Killer Elite World Tour&quot; at a free show in Uncasville, Connecticut on 11 September. On 11 November, DragonForce was confirmed for the 2017 edition of Pulp Summer Slam in the Philippines.

During an interview with &quot;Alto Music&quot; at the 2017 NAMM Show, Li revealed that the band were putting the &quot;finishing touches&quot; on their upcoming seventh album. In February 2017, the band revealed pieces of the album cover on their Instagram account, and the album title was revealed to be &quot;Reaching into Infinity&quot;. On 9 February, the band released details of the new album on their official website, including the release date, format and a release party show date. Leclercq also gave insight into the recording process of the album. &quot;We were flying out, playing a festival, then back into the studio, then back out again,&quot; said Leclercq, who handled the majority of songwriting on the album. &quot;It was very intense and very tiring... [I] lost my temper a few times – I think we all did at some point, because we wanted to deliver nothing but the best. I think we have proven that playing fast was something we were good at, so this time I wanted to bring even more diversity into our music. It&#x27;s great to challenge ourselves instead of staying in a comfort zone&quot;. &quot;Reaching into Infinity&quot; was released on 19 May 2017.

A music video for &quot;Ashes of the Dawn&quot; was released on 15 May 2017. Keyboardist Vadim Pruzhanov was not featured in the clip nor in any of the shows happening by the time of the album&#x27;s recording. In a video published on his official YouTube channel, he explained he wanted to have more time for his daughter and that he had to choose between performing in all or none of the shows due to contractual limitations. He chose the second option and was absent from the album&#x27;s promotional tour as well. Power Quest supported DragonForce as special guests on the UK leg for the Reaching Into Infinity World Tour while supporting their own new album, &quot;Sixth Dimension&quot;. On 13 July, the band announced that Swedish act Twilight Force would support the band during the European leg of the &quot;Reaching Into Infinity World Tour&quot; A music video for &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; was released on 21 September 2017, which documented the making of that song at Fascination Street Studios. On 15 October, they were announced to appear as a headlining band at Vagos Open Air in 2018, however on 20 January 2018, they issued a statement saying that they will not be attending due to &quot;circumstances beyond their control&quot;. On 20 December, the band were announced to appear at Skogsröjet Festival in Rejmyre, Sweden in August 2018.

===Lineup changes and &quot;Extreme Power Metal&quot; (2018–2019)===
In January 2018, the band were announced to appear at Area 53 Festival in Leoben, Austria in July, and at Download Festival&#x27;s main stage for the first time since 2009 in June. In April 2018, the band announced a remastered version of &quot;The Power Within&quot; called &quot;Re-Powered Within&quot;. Li stated: &quot;I love how &quot;Re-Powered Within&quot; has turned out. We remixed and remastered the original music with a more modern production in the vein of our last two releases. The result is a clearer, more powerful sound. The fans will get to hear the music in better detail, bringing out parts they couldn&#x27;t hear so well before, and injecting new excitement into the songs we love even more now.&quot; &quot;Re-Powered Within&quot; was released on 4 May 2018. In October, DragonForce announced that they had entered the studio with Damien Rainaud, who had previously mixed and mastered for the band, to work on their eighth studio album, and that the band would be joining Megadeth on their MEGACruise in October 2019.

On 10 June 2019, after more than two years of not being involved with DragonForce, Pruzhanov posted on his Facebook page stating that he had officially left the band in May 2018. In July 2019, the band&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Extreme Power Metal&quot;, was announced and given a release date of 27 September 2019, and a music video for &quot;Highway to Oblivion&quot; was released. Epica keyboardist Coen Janssen recorded keyboards for the new album. In August 2019, Frédéric Leclercq announced that he would be leaving the band to pursue other projects; the band later confirmed Leclercq&#x27;s departure, and that YouTube personality and musician Steve Terreberry would fill in on bass for the band&#x27;s US tour dates. Terreberry eventually pulled out of the tour before playing a show due to his anxiety, and he released a video on his YouTube channel explaining his decision. Once Human bassist Damien Rainaud, who also produced &quot;Extreme Power Metal&quot;, took over bass duties as a result.

===New live members and &quot;Warp Speed Warriors&quot; (2020–present)===

In January 2020, Alicia Vigil took over as the band&#x27;s new touring bassist, beginning with their European tour. In March, Anzalone was admitted to hospital with myocarditis and was forced to skip DragonForce&#x27;s United States tour, with Aquiles Priester replacing him for the tour until it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April, Li said that the band had decided to use the lockdown time to write new music for &quot;a new album which isn&#x27;t going to be out for ages&quot;, while also saying that they were considering recruiting Vigil as their next permanent bassist. Vigil was later confirmed to be the new full-time bassist in one of Li&#x27;s Twitch streams in February 2022.

While in quarantine, DragonForce have written and recorded parody songs in the style of bands like Rammstein, Amon Amarth, Blink-182, and Nightwish, along with a collaboration with Jaret Reddick from Bowling For Soup. In February 2021, the band announced that they would professionally record those songs and release them in an album later this year before writing their next proper album. However, it is currently unknown if the band is still moving forward with their &quot;parody album&quot; plan.

In March 2022, Li revealed that the band had written &quot;a lot of music&quot; for their next album, but were currently in search of a new record deal. He added that the music they had written was &quot;gonna be epic, triumphant, fun and catchy and uplifting. We&#x27;re gonna carry on sounding like DRAGONFORCE.&quot;

The band went on to re-tour their album &quot;Extreme Power Metal&quot; in North America in early 2022 with Firewind, Visions of Atlantis, and Seven Spires. In late 2022, they were able to continue their &quot;Extreme Power Metal&quot; tour in Europe with Powerwolf and Warkings.

DragonForce signed a deal with Napalm Records to release their upcoming album. On 14 September 2023, the band released a new single titled &quot;Doomsday Party&quot;.

On 18 October 2023, the band released the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Power of the Triforce&quot; along with an accompanying music video. That same day, the band announced that their ninth studio album &quot;Warp Speed Warriors&quot; would be released on 15 March 2024.

On 15 February 2024, the band released a cover of Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;Wildest Dreams (Taylor&#x27;s Version)&quot; through their official YouTube channel, which was included in their album as a bonus track.

On 30 May 2024, the band collaborated with the mobile video game &quot;Brawl Stars&quot;, releasing a new single titled &quot;A Draco Tale&quot; to promote its newest playable character, Draco.

== Musical style ==

Much of DragonForce&#x27;s idiosyncratic style comes from the high-speed dual guitar sounds of Herman Li and Sam Totman. By playing at a high tempo within the upper registers of their instruments, their sound becomes similar to the &quot;bleepy&quot; arpeggios and quick pitch-bends normally associated with chiptune, usually heard in the third generation of video game music. The band often pays homage to this influence in their music videos.

Although the band has frequently referred to their style as power metal, Li commented on descriptions of the band&#x27;s style in an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;: Nintendo metal&#x27;, &#x27;extreme power metal&#x27;, &#x27;Bon Jovi on speed&#x27;, &#x27;Journey meets Slayer&#x27;, ... people are always coming up with weird labels for us.&quot; The band has also been labelled as a speed metal or progressive metal band.

<doc id="586940" wikidata="Q2142436" url="?curid=586940" title="Drop D tuning">
<text>Drop D tuning is an alternative form of guitar tuning in which the lowest (sixth) string is tuned down from the usual E of standard tuning by one whole step to D. So where standard tuning is E2A2D3G3B3E4 (EADGBe), drop D is D2A2D3G3B3E4 (DADGBe). Drop D tuning, as well as other lowered altered tunings, are often used with the electric guitar in heavy metal music. It is also used in blues, country, folk (often with acoustic guitar), and classical guitar.
== Uses ==
In drop D, the three open bass strings form a D5 power chord. Other fifth chords are made when barred with the index finger of the fretting hand shifted up the fretboard. Drop D tuning is frequently used in heavy metal and its various subgenres, as guitarists in these styles often need fast transitions between power chords. Drop D is also used in metal because it adds two lower semitones to the bass range of the rhythm guitar, which adds two more low-range power chords (E and D) and enables a heavier, deeper sound. The tuning has also been used in many other styles of music, including blues, country, folk, and classical. Due to its similarity to standard tuning, drop D is recognised as a useful introduction to alternative tunings, leading logically to an exploration of DADGAD, open D, D tuning (in which all strings are tuned 1 full note lower DGCFAD), drop D (in which only the 6th string is tuned 3 frets lower DADGBe) and drop D drop G (in which both the 5th and 6th strings are dropped a tone DGDGBe) tunings.

The tuning allows for chords with a root or bass note of D to be played with a D an octave lower than with standard tuning. It also allows the playing of open D chords that include the fifth and sixth strings, letting the full sonority of the guitar be heard. This can be especially useful for songs in the keys of D major or minor and is particularly effective on acoustic guitar. Drop D also allows fingerpickers to play chord shapes higher up the neck while maintaining an alternating bass. The bottom three strings, if left open, will vibrate sympathetically and, using chord shapes limited to the top three strings, a drone effect can easily be achieved.

The trade-off is the loss of the open bass E note in chords or fingerings, which the player can adjust to include fretting the sixth string at the second fret (now E).

== In rock and metal ==
Although the drop D tuning was introduced and developed by classical guitarists and lutists such as English renaissance composer John Dowland, drop D tuning is mostly known from its usage in contemporary heavy metal and hard rock bands. One of the earliest uses of drop D tuning was by English composer John Dowland during the renaissance. Early hard rock songs tuned in drop D include The Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot; and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, both first released in 1969. Tuning the lowest string one tone down, from E to D, allowed these musicians to acquire a heavier and darker sound than in standard tuning. Without needing to tune all strings (standard D tuning), they could tune just one, in order to lower the key. Drop D is also a convenient tuning, because it expands the scale of an instrument by two semitones: D and D.

In the mid 1980s, three alternative rock bands, King&#x27;s X, Soundgarden, and Melvins, influenced by Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, made extensive use of drop D tuning. While playing power chords (a chord that includes the prime, fifth and octave) in standard tuning requires a player to use two or three fingers, drop D tuning needs just one, similar in technique to playing barre chords. It allowed them to use different methods of articulating power chords (legato for example) and more importantly, it allowed guitarists to change chords faster. This new technique of playing power chords introduced by these early grunge bands was a great influence on many artists, such as Rage Against the Machine and Tool. The same drop D tuning then became common practice among alternative metal acts such as the band Helmet, who used the tuning a great deal throughout their career and would later influence many alternative metal and nu metal bands.

Nu metal bands including Deftones and Slipknot went one step further and decided to tune &quot;drop&quot; tuning even lower. By lowering the 6th string one whole step in lowered tunings they created a heavier and grittier sound. Lower tunings such as Drop D, used prior by groups such as Nirvana and Alice In Chains, Drop C, Drop B, Drop B, and Drop A were utilized. These tunings are very popular among Alternative metal, metalcore and deathcore acts like Trivium, Emmure, Breaking Benjamin, August Burns Red, and Suicide Silence, where fast chord changes are an essential part of the sound. Progressive metal acts such as Pain of Salvation, Opeth, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater use these tunings in some of their E-tuned songs.

== Chords in drop D tuning ==
Chords in drop D tuning are formed as they are in standard tuning, with the exception of the sixth string, which is either omitted or fretted one whole step higher:

Note that these chords are not the power chords commonly played in drop D tuning. Power chords generally mute the higher notes rather than the lower notes.

For purposes of making the table easier to read, spaces are provided between each number when the fret number becomes a double digit. Additionally, the highest note in any 5th chord is an octave from the root note so it is not necessary to play it to achieve a 5th chord.
== Relation to other tunings ==
Drop D tuning is the most basic type of &quot;drop 1&quot; tuning, where the 6th string is tuned down a whole step (a tone). A large number of other &quot;drop 1&quot; tunings can be obtained simply by tuning a guitar to drop D tuning and then tuning all strings down some fixed amount. Examples are Drop D, Drop C, Drop B, Drop B, and Drop A tunings. All of these use the same fingerings as for drop D tuning.

<text>The New River is a 50-mile (80-km) long river in southeastern North Carolina in the United States. It empties into the Atlantic Ocean. The river has been plagued in more recent years by pollution by solid waste. It rises in northwestern Onslow County and flows east-southeast past Jacksonville, where it widens into a tidal estuary approximately two miles (3.2 km) wide. As an estuary it meanders through Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and enters the Atlantic in Onslow Bay, via the New River Inlet between two barrier islands. The Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway crosses the entrance of the river between the coast and the barrier island.

The river is periodically dredged for fishing operations.

== History ==
=== Environmental decline ===
In 1940, the city government of Jacksonville, North Carolina built a sewage treatment plant to serve its 873 residents. The plant directly discharged its treated water into the New River. Jacksonville rapidly expanded during World War II and thereafter due to the growth of Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, putting strain on the municipal wastewater infrastructure. The treatment plant filtered out pathogens but was unable to remove ammonias, phosphates, and nitrates from the water. The additional nutrients dumped into the river led to algal blooms, reduced oxygen levels, and fish kills. Declining water quality led the New River to be closed to the public in the early 1980s. In 1995, a hog lagoon leaked 25 million gallons of waste into the river.

=== Restoration efforts ===
Following the 1995 hog lagoon spill, local officials decided to try to rehabilitate the New River. Jacksonville&#x27;s government replaced its sewage plant and consulted with scientists from North Carolina State University on ways to remediate the river&#x27;s water quality. As a result, the city launched an oyster reef restoration project with the hopes that the added oysters would filter out pollutants in the water and attract other wildlife, such as fish. After some improvements in water quality, the river was reopened for recreational activities and commercial fishing operations in 2001.

<text>Dauphin () is a city in Manitoba, Canada, with a population of 8,368 as of the 2021 Canadian Census. The community is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Dauphin. The city takes its name from Lake Dauphin and Fort Dauphin (first built 1741), which were named by explorer Pierre Gaultier de La Vérendrye in honour of the Dauphin of France, the heir to the French throne. Dauphin is Manitoba&#x27;s ninth largest community and serves as a hub to the province&#x27;s Parkland Region. 

Dauphin plays host to several summer festivals, including Dauphin&#x27;s Countryfest and Canada&#x27;s National Ukrainian Festival. Dauphin is served by Provincial Trunk Highways 5, 10 and 20.

==Location==

Dauphin is in western Manitoba near Duck Mountain Provincial Park and Riding Mountain National Park, just west of Lake Manitoba and Dauphin Lake and south of Lake Winnipegosis.

==History==
The nearby lake was given the name &quot;Dauphin&quot; by the explorer Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye in 1741 in honour of the heir to the French throne. Settlers began arriving in the area in 1883 and two early settlements, Gartmore and &quot;Old Dauphin&quot; were established. With the coming of the railway in 1896 – the line ran roughly halfway between the two villages – settlement shifted to the present site. This coincided with the beginning of Ukrainian settlement in the area: previously most arrivals had been of British extraction.

Dauphin was granted a village charter on 11 July 1898, with George Barker as first mayor. In 1901 Dauphin was incorporated as a town, with George King as mayor. Dauphin became an important centre for the transportation of grain. Farming still plays a central role in the economy of the area, but its role has been greatly reduced.

From 1974 to 1979, a federally funded pilot project called Mincome provided a Basic income guarantee to residents of Dauphin.

Dauphin was incorporated as a city in 1998.

==Healthcare==

Dauphin is a regional healthcare hub, part of the Prairie Mountain Health authority. The Dauphin General Hospital (now the Dauphin Regional Health Centre) was established in 1901. The Dauphin Medical Clinic provides access to family physicians and specialists, while providing a walk-in clinic and acute care.

==Economy==

As the largest city within the Parkland, Dauphin has a trading area of over 50,000 people. A large part of Dauphin&#x27;s economy is based on agriculture, with farms in this area of the province producing grains, oilseeds, honey and livestock. Dauphin is the home to various industries including manufacturing, health care, education, recreation/tourism and retail. The Canadian distribution centre for Norwex is also located in the city.

==Education==
The first school building was erected in Dauphin in 1903, a frame building on the present Mackenzie School site. The original Whitmore School was built on Fifth Ave. SW in 1907, followed by the Smith-Jackson School on Main Street South in 1922. Today, the Mountain View School Division oversees K-12 education in Dauphin. The City of Dauphin has 7 schools including the Dauphin Regional Comprehensive Secondary School, Mackenzie Middle School, Henderson Elementary School, Lt. Colonel Barker VC School, École Macneill (French Immersion), Whitmore School and Smith-Jackson Ukrainian Bilingual School.
The Assiniboine Community College Parkland Campus, located in Dauphin, provides post-secondary programming in the Parkland. Programs include business, agriculture, applied counseling, nursing and a range of apprenticeship courses.

Dauphin is a hockey community. The Credit Union Place recreation complex was built in 2006. It is the home of the Dauphin Kings, an MJHL Junior A hockey team, Turnbull Memorial Trophy winners in 1969, 1970, 1972, 1977, 1983, 1993, and 2010 and Anavet Cup winners of 2010. Formerly, the team played in the Dauphin Memorial Community Centre (D.M.C.C.) arena that was built after the Second World War. Dauphin and the Kings hosted the Royal Bank Cup in 2010, the Canadian National Championship for Junior A Hockey. The 1953–54 Dauphin Kings were inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame for winning the team&#x27;s second Western Canadian Intermediate Championship in a decade and capturing the Edmonton Journal trophy.

Dauphin has a history of title-winning baseball teams. Both the Dauphin Redbirds and later the Dauphin Brewers have claimed numerous provincial titles.

Dauphin high schoolers play a big part of the athletics of Dauphin. They have won many awards and medals in volleyball, track and field, basketball, broomball, curling, football, and hockey.

A Dauphin rink composed of curlers Ab Gowanlock, Jim Williams, Art Pollon and Russ Jackman won the Brier, the Canadian men&#x27;s curling championship, in 1953.

Dauphin has been called the &quot;horseshoe capital of Canada,&quot; in large part due to the efforts of Bert Snart (1912–1988), president of the Dauphin Horseshoe Club for 32 years. In 1976 he was inducted into the Horseshoe Hall of Fame in Levittown, Pennsylvania.

<text>Sennar ( &quot;&quot;) is a city on the Blue Nile in Sudan and possibly the capital of the state of Sennar. For several centuries it was the capital of the Funj Kingdom of Sennar and until at least 2011, Sennar was the capital of Sennar State. 

==Overview==
The French traveler Charles-Jacques Poncet, who visited Sennar near the end of the 17th century, estimated the town had a population of 100,000 inhabitants. However, when the Dutch explorer Juan Maria Schuver travelled through the town in April 1881, he doubted it had &quot;anything like 100,000 inhabitants, when Khartoum, the centre and capital of a tenfold larger country is not able to muster more than a quarter of that number, if we exclude the garrison.&quot; He observed that Sennar had declined as trade had over the years shifted to Karkoj, &quot;much more advantageously situated as the terminus of regular navigation, as the natural outlet of the Takruri country between Kassala and Galabat.&quot;

The modern town lies SSE of the ruins of the ancient capital of the Funj Kingdom, southeast of Khartoum, the Capital of Sudan.

The city is home to Sinnar University, established in 1977. In 2011, the Library of Congress still presented maps indicating that Sennar was the capital of Sennar state, but more recent works indicate that the capital is at Sinja.

==Climate==
Despite receiving over of rainfall per year, the extreme heat and high evaporation means Sennar still has a borderline hot arid climate (Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;) a little below a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;).

<text>Galician–Portuguese ( or ; or ), also known as Galaic–Portuguese, Old Galician–Portuguese, Old Galician or Old Portuguese, Medieval Galician or Medieval Portuguese when referring to the history of each modern language, was a West Iberian Romance language spoken in the Middle Ages, in the northwest area of the Iberian Peninsula. Alternatively, it can be considered a historical period of the Galician, Fala, and Portuguese languages.

Galician–Portuguese was first spoken in the area bounded in the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean and by the Douro River in the south, comprising Galicia and northern Portugal, but it was later extended south of the Douro by the &quot;Reconquista&quot;.

It is the common ancestor of modern Portuguese, Galician, and Fala varieties, all of which maintain a very high level of mutual intelligibility. The term &quot;Galician–Portuguese&quot; also designates the subdivision of the modern West Iberian group of Romance languages.

==Language==

===Origins and history===

Galician–Portuguese developed in the region of the former Roman province of Gallaecia, from the Vulgar Latin (common Latin) that had been introduced by Roman soldiers, colonists and magistrates during the time of the Roman Empire. Although the process may have been slower than in other regions, the centuries of contact with Vulgar Latin, after a period of bilingualism, completely extinguished the native languages, leading to the evolution of a new variety of Latin with a few Gallaecian features.

Gallaecian and Lusitanian influences were absorbed into the local Vulgar Latin dialect, which can be detected in some Galician–Portuguese words as well as in placenames of Celtic and Iberian origin. In general, the more cultivated variety of Latin spoken by the Hispano-Roman elites in Roman Hispania had a peculiar regional accent, referred to as &quot;Hispano ore&quot; and &quot;agrestius pronuntians&quot;. The more cultivated variety of Latin coexisted with the popular variety. It is assumed that the Pre-Roman languages spoken by the native people, each used in a different region of Roman Hispania, contributed to the development of several different dialects of Vulgar Latin and that these diverged increasingly over time, eventually evolving into the early Romance languages of Iberia.

An early form of Galician–Portuguese was already spoken in the Kingdom of the Suebi and by the year 800 Galician–Portuguese had already become the vernacular of northwestern Iberia. The first known phonetic changes in Vulgar Latin, which began the evolution to Galician–Portuguese, took place during the rule of the Germanic groups, the Suebi (411–585) and Visigoths (585–711). And the Galician–Portuguese &quot;inflected infinitive&quot; (or &quot;personal infinitive&quot;) and the nasal vowels may have evolved under the influence of local Celtic languages (as in Old French). The nasal vowels would thus be a phonologic characteristic of the Vulgar Latin spoken in Roman Gallaecia, but they are not attested in writing until after the 6th and 7th centuries.

The oldest known document to contain Galician–Portuguese words found in northern Portugal is called the &quot;Doação à Igreja de Sozello&quot; and dated to 870 but otherwise composed in Late/Medieval Latin. Another document, from 882, also containing some Galician–Portuguese words is the &quot;Carta de dotação e fundação da Igreja de S. Miguel de Lardosa&quot;. In fact, many Latin documents written in Portuguese territory contain Romance forms. The &quot;Notícia de fiadores&quot;, written in 1175, is thought by some to be the oldest known document written in Galician–Portuguese.
The &quot;Pacto dos irmãos Pais&quot;, discovered in 1999 (and possibly dating from before 1173), has been said to be even older, but despite the enthusiasm of some scholars, it has been shown that the documents are not really written in Galician–Portuguese but are in fact a mixture of Late Latin and Galician–Portuguese phonology, morphology and syntax. The &quot;Noticia de Torto&quot;, of uncertain date (), and the &quot;&quot; (27 June 1214) are most certainly Galician–Portuguese. The earliest poetic texts (but not the manuscripts in which they are found) date from c. 1195 to c. 1225. Thus, by the end of the 12th century and the beginning of the 13th there are documents in prose and verse written in the local Romance vernacular.

In Galicia the oldest document showing traces of the underlying Romance language is a royal charter by king Silo of Asturias, dated to 775: it uses substrate words as &quot;arrogio&quot; and &quot;lagena&quot;, now &quot;arroio&quot; &#x27;stream&#x27; and &quot;laxe&quot; &#x27;stone&#x27;, and presents also the elision of unstressed vowels and the lenition of plosive consonants; actually, many Galician Latin charters written during the Middle Ages show interferences of the local Galician–Portuguese contemporary language. As for the oldest document written in Galician–Portuguese in Galicia, it is probably a document from the monastery of Melón dated to 1231, since the &quot;Charter of the Boo Burgo of Castro Caldelas&quot;, dated to 1228, is probably a slightly later translation of a Latin original.

===Literature===

Galician–Portuguese had a special cultural role in the literature of the Christian kingdoms of Crown of Castile (Kingdoms of Castile, Leon and Galicia, part of the medieval NW Iberian Peninsula) comparable to the Catalan language of the Crown of Aragon (Principality of Catalonia and Kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia and Majorca, NE medieval Iberian Peninsula), or that of Occitan in France and Italy during the same historical period. The main extant sources of Galician–Portuguese lyric poetry are these:
* The four extant manuscripts of the &quot;Cantigas de Santa Maria&quot; (written under the patronage of, Alfonso X the Wise, king of Castile, Leon and Galicia from 1252–1284)
* &quot;Cancioneiro da Ajuda&quot;
* &quot;Cancioneiro da Vaticana&quot;
* &quot;Cancioneiro Colocci-Brancuti&quot;, also known as &quot;Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional&quot; (Lisbon)
* Cancioneiro dun Grande de Espanha
* Pergaminho Vindel
* Pergaminho Sharrer
* Os 5 lais de Bretanha
* Tenzón entre Afonso Sánchez e Vasco Martíns de Resende

The language was used for literary purposes from the final years of the 12th century to roughly the middle of the 14th century in what are now Spain and Portugal and was, almost without exception, the only language used for the composition of lyric poetry. Over 160 poets are recorded, among them Bernal de Bonaval, Pero da Ponte, Johan Garcia de Guilhade, Johan Airas de Santiago, and Pedr&#x27; Amigo de Sevilha. The main secular poetic genres were the &quot;cantigas d&#x27;amor&quot; (male-voiced love lyric), the &quot;cantigas d&#x27;amigo&quot; (female-voiced love lyric) and the &quot;cantigas d&#x27;escarnho e de mal dizer&quot; (including a variety of genres from personal invective to social satire, poetic parody and literary debate).

All told, nearly 1,700 poems survive in these three genres, and there is a corpus of over 400 &quot;cantigas de Santa Maria&quot; (narrative poems about miracles and hymns in honor of the Holy Virgin). The Castilian king Alfonso X composed his &quot;cantigas de Santa Maria&quot; and his &quot;cantigas de escárnio e maldizer&quot; in Galician–Portuguese, even though he used Castilian for prose.

King Dinis of Portugal, who also contributed (with 137 extant texts, more than any other author) to the secular poetic genres, made the language official in Portugal in 1290. Until then, Latin had been the official (written) language for royal documents; the spoken language did not have a name and was simply known as until it was named &quot;Portuguese&quot; in King Dinis&#x27; reign. &quot;Galician–Portuguese&quot; and (&quot;Old Portuguese&quot;) are modern terms for the common ancestor of modern Portuguese and modern Galician. Compared to the differences in Ancient Greek dialects, the alleged differences between 13th-century Portuguese and Galician are trivial.

===Divergence===

As a result of political division, Galician–Portuguese lost its unity when the County of Portugal separated from the Kingdom of Leon to establish the Kingdom of Portugal. The Galician and Portuguese versions of the language then diverged over time as they followed independent evolutionary paths.

As Portugal&#x27;s territory was extended southward during the Reconquista, the increasingly-distinctive Portuguese language was adopted by the people in those regions, supplanting the earlier Arabic and other Romance/Latin languages that were spoken in these conquered areas during the Moorish era. Meanwhile, Galician was influenced by the neighbouring Leonese language, especially during the time of kingdoms of Leon and Leon-Castile, and in the 19th and 20th centuries, it has been influenced by Castilian. Two cities at the time of separation, Braga and Porto, were within the County of Portugal and have remained within Portugal. Further north, the cities of Lugo, A Coruña and the great medieval centre of Santiago de Compostela remained within Galicia.

Galician was the main written language in Galicia until the 16th century, but later it was displaced by Castilian Spanish, which was the official language of the Crown of Castille. Galician slowly became mainly an oral language, preserved by the majority rural or &quot;uneducated&quot; population living in the villages and towns, and Castilian was taught as the &quot;correct&quot; language to the bilingual educated elite in the cities. During most of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, its written use was largely reduced to popular literature and theatre and private letters. From the 18th century onward grew the interest for the language by the studies of illustrious writers such as Martin Sarmiento, who studied the evolution of Galician from Latin and prepared the foundations for the first dictionary of Galician, José Cornide, and father Sobreira. In the 19th century a true literature in Galician emerged during the Rexurdimento, followed by the appearance of journals and, in the 20th century, scientific publications. Because until comparatively recently, most Galicians lived in many small towns and villages in a relatively remote and mountainous land, the language changed very slowly and was only very slightly influenced from outside the region. That situation made Galician remain the vernacular of Galicia until the late 19th and early 20th centuries and its most spoken language till the early 21st century. The draft of the 1936 Galician Statute of Autonomy considered an official status for (Modern) Galician in the region but it never came into force, as Galicia fell to Rebel control upon the early stages of the Spanish Civil War.

The linguistic classification of Galician and Portuguese is still discussed today. There are those among Galician independence groups who demand their reunification as well as Portuguese and Galician philologists who argue that both are dialects of a common language rather than two separate ones.

The Fala language, spoken in a small region of the Spanish autonomous community of Extremadura, underwent a similar development to Galician.

Today Galician is the regional language of Galicia (sharing co-officiality with Spanish), and it is spoken by the majority of its population, but with a large decline of use and efficient knowledge among the younger generations, and the phonetics and lexicon of many occasional users is heavily influenced by Spanish. Portuguese continues to grow and, today, is the sixth most spoken language in the world.

==Phonology==

:1 eventually shifted to in central and southern Portugal and merged with in northern Portugal and Galicia.
:2 and probably occurred in complementary distribution, just like in several Catalan dialects.
:3 The written tilde (&quot;ã&quot; &quot;ẽ&quot; &quot;ĩ&quot; &quot;õ&quot; &quot;ũ&quot; &quot;ỹ&quot; in the medieval sources) can be analyzed as a nasal consonant phoneme (usually , sometimes depending on position) following the marked vowel, with any nasalization of the vowel being a phonetic secondary effect.

 and were apico-alveolar, and and were lamino-alveolar. Later, all the affricate sibilants became fricatives, with the apico-alveolar and lamino-alveolar sibilants remaining distinct for a time but eventually merging in most dialects. See History of Portuguese for more information.

As far as it is known, Galician–Portuguese (from 11th to 16th centuries) had a 7-oral-vowel system (like in most of Romance languages), reduced to 5 vowels when nasalized in contact with syllable-final nasal consonants . The vowels were raised to in unstressed syllables, even in final syllables (like in modern Spanish); e.g. &quot;vento&quot; , &quot;quente&quot; .

However, the distribution is still dubious and under discussion; some either stating that these two vowels were allophones and in complementary distribution (like in Spanish and Modern Galician, only treated as ): &quot;Alamanha&quot; , &quot;mannãa&quot; ; or stating they were not allophones and under distribution like in European Portuguese nowadays, , .

Here is a sample of Galician-Portuguese lyric:
==Oral traditions==
There has been a sharing of folklore in the Galician–Portuguese region going back to prehistoric times. As the Galician–Portuguese language spread south with the Reconquista, supplanting Mozarabic, this ancient sharing of folklore intensified. In 2005, the governments of Portugal and Spain jointly proposed that Galician–Portuguese oral traditions be made part of the Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. The work of documenting and transmitting that common culture involves several universities and other organizations.

Galician–Portuguese folklore is rich in oral traditions. These include the &quot;cantigas ao desafio&quot; or &quot;regueifas&quot;, duels of improvised songs, many legends, stories, poems, romances, folk songs, sayings and riddles, and ways of speech that still retain a lexical, phonetic, morphological and syntactic similarity.

Also part of the common heritage of oral traditions are the markets and festivals of patron saints and processions, religious celebrations such as the &quot;magosto,&quot; &quot;entroido&quot; or Corpus Christi, with ancient dances and tradition – like the one where Coca the dragon fights with Saint George; and also traditional clothing and adornments, crafts and skills, work-tools, carved vegetable lanterns, superstitions, traditional knowledge about plants and animals. All these are part of a common heritage considered in danger of extinction as the traditional way of living is replaced by modern life, and the jargon of fisherman, the names of tools in traditional crafts, and the oral traditions which form part of celebrations are slowly forgotten.

A Galician–Portuguese &quot;baixo-limiao&quot; lect is spoken in several villages. In Galicia, it is spoken in Entrimo and Lobios and in northern Portugal in Terras de Bouro (lands of the Buri) and Castro Laboreiro including the mountain town (county seat) of Soajo and surrounding villages.

<text>Samuel Scheidt (baptised 3 November 1587 – 24 March 1654) was a German composer, organist and teacher of the early Baroque era.

==Life and career==
Scheidt was born in Halle, and after early studies there, he went to Amsterdam to study with Sweelinck, the distinguished Dutch composer, whose work had a clear influence on Scheidt&#x27;s style. On his return to Halle, Scheidt became court organist, and later Kapellmeister, to the Margrave of Brandenburg. Unlike many German musicians, for example Heinrich Schütz, he remained in Germany during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, managing to survive by teaching and by taking a succession of smaller jobs until the restoration of stability allowed him to resume his post as Kapellmeister. When Samuel Scheidt lost his job because of Wallenstein, he was appointed in 1628 as musical director of three churches in Halle, including the Market Church.

Scheidt was the first internationally significant German composer for the organ, and represents the flowering of the new north German style, which occurred largely as a result of the Protestant Reformation. In south Germany and some other countries of Europe, the spiritual and artistic influence of Rome remained strong, so most music continued to be derivative of Italian models. Cut off from Rome, musicians in the newly Protestant areas readily developed styles that were much different from those of their neighbours.

Scheidt&#x27;s music is in two principal categories: instrumental music, including a large amount of keyboard music, mostly for organ; and sacred vocal music, some of which is &quot;a cappella&quot; and some of which uses a basso continuo or other instrumental accompaniment. In his numerous chorale preludes, Scheidt often used a &quot;patterned variation&quot; technique, in which each phrase of the chorale uses a different rhythmic motive, and each variation is more elaborate than the previous one, until the climax of the composition is reached. In addition to his chorale preludes, he wrote numerous fugues, suites of dances (which were often in a cyclic form, sharing a common ground bass) and fantasias.

==Works==
* Scheidt&#x27;s complete works are published by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel in a series of 16 volumes edited by Gottlieb Harms, Christhard Mahrenholz and Christoph Wolff. 
* A new scholarly edition of Scheidt&#x27;s &quot;Tabulatura nova&quot; (1624) is edited by Harald Vogel (Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, 1994).

<text>A smoothbore weapon is one that has a barrel without rifling. Smoothbores range from handheld firearms to powerful tank guns and large artillery mortars.

==History==
Early firearms had smoothly bored barrels that fired projectiles without significant spin. To minimize inaccuracy-inducing tumbling during flight, their projectiles required an aerodynamically uniform shape, such as a sphere. However, surface imperfections on the projectile and/or the barrel will cause even a sphere to rotate randomly during flight, and the Magnus effect will curve it off the intended trajectory when spinning on any axis not parallel to the direction of travel.

Rifling the bore surface with spiral grooves or polygonal valleys imparts a stabilizing gyroscopic spin to a projectile that prevents tumbling in flight. Not only does this more than counter Magnus-induced drift, but it allows a longer, more streamlined round with greater sectional density to be fired from the same caliber barrel, improving the accuracy, effective range and hitting power.

In the eighteenth century, the standard infantry arm was the smoothbore musket; although rifled muskets were introduced in the early 18th century and had more power and range, they did not become the norm until the middle of the 19th century, when the Minié ball increased their rate of fire to match that of smoothbores.

Artillery weapons were smoothbore until the mid-19th century, and smoothbores continued in limited use until the late 19th century. Early rifled artillery pieces were patented by Joseph Whitworth and William Armstrong in the United Kingdom in 1855. In the United States, rifled small arms and artillery were gradually adopted during the American Civil War. However, heavy coast defense Rodman smoothbores persisted in the US until 1900 due to the tendency of the Civil War&#x27;s heavy Parrott rifles to burst and lack of funding for replacement weapons.

==Current use==
Some smoothbore firearms are still used.

===Small arms===
A shotgun fires multiple, round shot; firing out of a rifled barrel would impart centrifugal forces that result a doughnut-shaped pattern of shot (with a high projectile density on the periphery, and a low projectile density in the interior). While this may be acceptable at close ranges (some spreader chokes are rifled to produce wide patterns at close range) this is not desirable at longer ranges, where a tight, consistent pattern is required to improve accuracy.
Another smoothbore weapon in use today is the 37-mm riot gun, which fires less-lethal munitions like rubber bullets and teargas at short range at crowds, where a high degree of accuracy is not required.

The Steyr IWS 2000 anti-tank rifle is smoothbore. This can help accelerate projectiles and increase ballistic effectiveness. The projectile is a 15.2 mm fin-stabilized discarding-sabot type with armor-piercing capability which the IWS 2000 was specifically designed to fire. It contains a dart-shaped penetrator of either tungsten carbide or depleted uranium, capable of piercing 40 mm of rolled homogeneous armor at a range of 1,000 m, and causing secondary fragmentation.

===Artillery and tanks===
The cannon made the transition from smoothbore firing cannonballs to rifled firing shells in the mid-19th century. However, to reliably penetrate the thick armor of modern armored vehicles many modern tank guns have moved back to smoothbore. These fire a very long, thin kinetic-energy projectile, too long in relation to its diameter to develop the necessary spin rate through rifling. Instead, kinetic energy rounds are produced as fin-stabilized darts. Not only does this reduce the time and expense of producing rifled barrels, it also reduces the need for replacement due to barrel wear.

The armour-piercing gun evolution has also shown up in small arms, particularly the now abandoned U.S. Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR) program. The ACR &quot;rifles&quot; used smoothbore barrels to fire single or multiple flechettes (tiny darts), rather than bullets, per pull of the trigger, to provide long range, flat trajectory, and armor-piercing abilities. Just like kinetic-energy tank rounds, flechettes are too long and thin to be stabilized by rifling and perform best from a smoothbore barrel. The ACR program was abandoned due to reliability problems and poor terminal ballistics.

Mortar barrels are typically muzzle-loading smoothbores. Since mortars fire bombs that are dropped down the barrel and must not be a tight fit, a smooth barrel is essential. The bombs are fin-stabilized.

<doc id="586964" wikidata="Q4921632" url="?curid=586964" title="Black River (North Carolina)">
<text>The Black River is a tributary of the Cape Fear River, approximately 50 mi (80 km) long, in southeastern North Carolina in the United States.

It is formed in southern Sampson County, approximately 15 mi. (24 km) south of Clinton, by confluence of two creeks: Great Coharie Creek and Six Runs Creek. It flows SSE, receiving the South River approximately 30 mi (48 km) south of Clinton. It flows southeast through Pender County, past the Moores Creek National Battlefield, and joins the Cape Fear approximately 10 mi (16 km) northwest of Wilmington, near the broadening of the Cape Fear into a tidal estuary.

The river is known for having a wide variety of fish species, ranging from several types of sunfish and catfish, as well as largemouth bass. Ancient bald cypress trees in excess of 2600 years old were discovered along the river in 2019.

== History ==
Long before settlers were navigating the Black River corridor in the eighteenth century, Native Americans traveled through these waterways via canoes. By the nineteenth century following the Civil War, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers helped dredge the river in preparation for steamboats to have access to it. This would allow materials and goods such as lumber, grains, and livestock to be more easily transported by boat through the Black River.

== Geography ==

=== Three Sisters ===
The Three Sisters swamp is located off the State Road 1550 bridge and the N.C. 53 bridge with the approximate coordinates of 34°33&#x27;59.2&quot;N 78°15&#x27;14.7&quot;W. This swamp is located on the Black River in Bladen County and the only way to reach Three Sisters is through the use of canoes and kayaks. The swamp is approximately one mile long and a half mile wide, but is home to the largest cluster of ancient cypress trees in the entire Black River Preserve.

== Ecology ==
The Black River is part of a blackwater system which is nutrient-poor and more acidic than other types of freshwater ecosystems. The higher acidity is a result of vegetation decay and the subsequent release of tannins in the water. This makes for an environment that does not sustain most hardwood tree species and even slows the growth of bald cypress. Although its blackwater prevents certain organisms from flourishing in the Black River Preserve, these types of ecosystems often consist of a very unique variety of fauna and flora.

Within the Black River lives a rare species of fish called the Santee chub (&quot;Cyprinella zanema&quot;). Another rare fish is the Broadtail Madtom. Although both of these species are uncommon, their current status is neither endangered nor threatened.

== Ancient bald cypress ==
The Black River in North Carolina is the only location in the world where bald cypress (&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;) have existed for over a millennium. In 2019, an individual tree—dating back to 605 B.C.E—was discovered alongside this southeastern tributary. Ancient bald cypresses were determined to be the oldest trees in eastern North America, as well as the fifth oldest species of tree on Earth.

In order to determine the age of bald cypress trees on the Black River Preserve, scientists have used a non-destructive method combining radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology. An individual by the name of David Stahle, was one of those who used the technology to date some of the oldest standing cypresses located in the area of Three Sisters swamp. This technology provides important information regarding the adaptability of the Black River ecosystem through historical variations in climate and rainfall patterns.

== Recreation ==
In 1994, the Black River was deemed an Outstanding Water Source by the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation. It has since become a popular location for recreational activities such as kayaking and canoeing. Year round, boaters can observe a wide variety of plant and animal species along the riverbanks.

== Conservation ==
When it comes to conservation, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is the longest running supporter of the Black River. TNC is largely responsible for establishing more than 17,000 acres for the Black River Preserve. With the help of North Carolina state agencies, this conservation and restoration project began in 1989 and has since protected the river and its surrounding environment.

The Black River is an area of focus for environmentalists due to threats on the ecosystem posed by humans. These threats include pollution of the river and surrounding waterways, as well as the logging industry, climate change and rise in sea level.

<doc id="586966" wikidata="Q943851" url="?curid=586966" title="Pragmatic Sanction of 1830">
<text>The [[Pragmatic sanction|Pragmatic Sanction]] of 1830 (), issued on 29 March 1830 by King Ferdinand VII of Spain, ratified a Decree of 1789 by Charles IV of Spain, which had replaced the semi-Salic system established by Philip V of Spain with the mixed succession system that predated the Bourbon monarchy (see also Carlism).

When Philip V, from the French House of Bourbon acceded to the Spanish throne in the War of the Spanish Succession, he brought with him the Salic law, which restricted succession to the throne to the direct male line. However, King Ferdinand VII had fathered only two daughters, Isabella and Luisa Fernanda of Bourbon. Ferdinand&#x27;s father, Charles IV of Spain made a weak attempt to eliminate the Salic Law, and Ferdinand brought forth the Pragmatic Sanction of 1830, so that his oldest daughter would inherit the throne and be declared queen upon his death, as was the older Castilian custom.

This removed his brother, Infante Carlos, Count of Molina, as the next in the line of succession under Salic Law. Carlos&#x27; supporters, among whom was Francisco Calomarde, pressured Ferdinand VII to repeal the Pragmatic Sanction. A severe attack of gout, however, incapacitated Ferdinand and, when he died on 29 September 1833, Isabella was proclaimed queen. As she was still a minor, the kingdom fell under the regency of her mother Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies.

<doc id="586975" wikidata="Q1021" url="?curid=586975" title="Kranj">
<text>Kranj (, ) is the third-largest city in Slovenia and the largest urban center of the traditional region of Upper Carniola (northwestern Slovenia) and the Slovene Alps. It is located approximately northwest of the national capital Ljubljana, acting as the seat of the City Municipality of Kranj.

==Geography==
The nucleus of the city is a well-preserved medieval old town, built at the confluence of the Kokra and Sava rivers. The city is served by the Kranj railway station on the route from Ljubljana to Munich, Germany (via Jesenice and Villach, Austria) and a highway. Slovenia&#x27;s national airport, Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport (in Brnik) is also very close to Kranj, considerably more so than to its nominal client, Ljubljana.

In Kranj, the Kokra cuts deeply into the conglomerate, forming a canyon deep. Kosorep, on the northern outskirts of Kranj, is a picturesque site along the river. Parts of the canyon can be reached by a walking trail. Below Kranj, at Drulovka, the Sava forms a deep canyon with conglomerate on both sides. Due to the dam for the Mavčiče Hydroelectric Plant, the river&#x27;s flow there is very slow.

=== Climate ===
Kranj has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;).
==Etymology==
Kranj was attested in written sources in the 5th century and 670 as &quot;Carnium&quot; (and as &quot;via Chreinariorum&quot; in 973, &quot;actum Kreine&quot; in 1050–65, &quot;in loco Chreina&quot; in 1065–77, and &quot;Chrainburch&quot; in 1291). The Slovene name is derived from Slavic &quot;*Korn’ь&quot;, borrowed from Romance &quot;Carnium&quot; in late antiquity. Like the Latin regional name &quot;Carnia&quot;, it is derived from the Celtic tribe known as the &quot;Carnī&quot; (Greek: Κάρνοι). The name of the tribe is probably derived from the Celtic root &quot;*karno-&quot; &#x27;peak, hill, pile of stones&#x27;. The German name of the town was &quot;Krainburg&quot;. The name of the historical region of Carniola is a Latin diminutive form of &quot;Carnia&quot;.

== History ==

===Prehistory and antiquity===
Archaeological finds show that Kranj was settled in prehistoric times. Discoveries include a bronze ax found in Drulovka, Hallstatt-era graves in the northern part of the town above the bank of the Kokra River, testifying to Illyrian settlement, and a burial site in the southern part of the town above the left bank of the Sava River, indicating a Celtic settlement. The Romans founded the settlement of Carnium at the confluence of the Sava and Kokra. In the 6th century, a major Germanic settlement stood at the same site, and an Ostrogothic cemetery was discovered nearby. The Gothic settlement was continued by the Lombards and existed until AD 580, when it was destroyed by invading Slavs.

===Middle Ages===
Traces of the old Slavic settlement (a Slavic burial site) date from the 9th and 10th centuries. As the seat of the margraves of Carniola in the 11th century, it was the most important settlement in the territory. The town itself is believed to have developed in the early 13th century; citizens of the town of Kranj appear in a document from 1221, and Kranj was officially referred to as a town in 1256. It was the seat of a court whose jurisdiction extended between that of Radovljica and Kamnik. In 1414 a decision was issued relieving the citizens of the town from paying tolls. In 1422 an ordinance required houses to be built of stone to prevent fires. A parish school was established in Kranj in 1423, and the same year the right was granted to Kranj to elect its own judge. Kranj was laid waste in 1471 in an Ottoman attack. Emperor Frederick III granted Kranj the right to collect tolls in documents from 1488 and 1493, and a 1493 document also granted the town the right to hold fairs twice a year. The town hospice records date back to the 15th century.

Crafts developed in Kranj during the Middle Ages. Mills first developed along the Sava and Kokra rivers, and this was followed by butchers, fur merchants, hide and wood processors, and then weavers of canvas and woolen cloth. Habsburg efforts to maintain Vienna&#x27;s monopoly on trade with Italy resulted in trade routes bypassing Kranj.

===Renaissance===
Kranj was affected by peasant revolts in the 16th century; the leaders of the 1515 peasant revolt were beheaded in Kranj, and in 1525, when a new revolt threatened Carniola, hussars commanded by Johann Katzianer occupied the town and caused more damage than the Ottomans had inflicted half a century earlier. In 1668 half of the houses in Kranj were destroyed by a fire, and the entire town burned in 1749. Kranj was affected by plague outbreaks in 1552, 1557, 1625, 1627, and 1657. In the mid-16th century, most of the townspeople converted to Protestantism; the merchants of Kranj opened a Protestant school and Slovenian books by Protestant authors were imported from Germany. The Protestant Reformation in Kranj was led by Gašpar Rokavec, who was succeeded by Jernej Knafel after his death. Knafel was forced to withdraw from Kranj to Brdo Castle during the Counter-Reformation.

Economically, teamster services developed in Kranj in the 16th century, with connections to the rest of Upper Carniola and Carinthia. There were also several blacksmith workshops and two foundries along the Sava River. Sieve-making also developed at this time; horsehair was imported from around Europe and the sieves were exported to France, Belgium, Germany, and Greece. Several breweries and leather works operated in the town. Kranj went into an economic decline in the 17th century, when there was much emigration from the town, leaving many houses empty, and business did not revive again until the second half of the 18th century.

===Modern era===

Kranj was affected by plague outbreaks in 1836 and 1855. A Slovene reading room was established in 1863. Artisans&#x27; workshops became established in Kranj in the 19th century, with roots going back to a number of painters in the 17th and 18th centuries. Prominent among these was the workshop of Josip Egartner Jr. (1833–1905), who settled in Kranj in 1875. An upper secondary school was established in 1861, and a vocational school for textile workers opened in 1930. A water supply system was installed in Kranj in 1901, supplied by Čemšenik Spring on the Kokra River.

There was limited industry in Kranj until the late 19th century. Until this time, trade in agricultural products, livestock, and wood was economically most important. The Majdič Mill, which operated from 1874 until the Second World War, was an early industry, producing up to of milled products per day. A leather factory was established in 1875. Large-scale industrialization occurred after the First World War, starting with the founding of a rubber factory in 1921. The Jugo-Češka textile works was established in 1923. Additional textile works were established after this, making Kranj one of the most important centers of textile manufacturing in pre-war Yugoslavia. A major strike by textile workers occurred in 1936, when they occupied the factories. Two shoe factories were established in 1925, and a bakery in 1937.

===Second World War===

During the Second World War, Kranj, along with the rest of northern Slovenia, was annexed by Nazi Germany. The German authorities dismantled the Jugo-Češka textile works, replacing the machinery with equipment to produce aircraft. On 21 March 1944, German forces discovered several communist activists and functionaries at the Šorli Mill in Rupa in the northern part of the town, where military supplies for the Partisans were being stored. Three of the men at the mill were killed and the German forces then burned the mill.

====Mass grave====
Kranj is the site of a mass grave from the period immediately after the Second World War. The Planina Mass Grave () is located in a small woods in a field near the city cemetery. It contains the remains of an undetermined number of people murdered after the war; the victims may be German prisoners of war, Home Guard soldiers repatriated from Austria, or Slovene civilians from Kranj and the surrounding area.

==Economy==
Kranj is a mainly industrial city with significant electronics and rubber industries. It experienced a wave of deindustrialisation with many of its factories going bankrupt following independence in 1991, leaving behind several brownfields. In recent years, its manufacturing sector has become more based around highly-competitive export-oriented industries. Major industrial companies operating in Kranj include Goodyear (under their subsidiary Goodyear Dunlop Sava), Iskratel and Hidria.

===St. Cantianus and Companions Parish Church===
The St. Cantianus and Companions Parish Church () is the largest church in Kranj and also the seat of the Kranj Parish and Deaconates. It was built in the 14th century, and measures . Construction was commissioned by the counts of Kranj.

===Kieselstein Castle===

The castle was built in the mid-16th century by Baron Johann Jakob Khisl. Later owners included the families of Moscon, Ravbar, Apfaltrer, Auersperg, and Pagliaruzzi. The building was renovated in 1952 by the architect Jože Plečnik in his late period. The castle garden is currently used as a concert setting.

==Culture==
The city is known for its sports facilities, including soccer, tennis and basketball, as well as the biggest aquatic centre in the country, which hosted the 2003 Men&#x27;s European Water Polo Championship (along with Ljubljana, hosting the women&#x27;s competition). The annual &quot;Teden Mladih&quot; (Youth Week) festival and Carniola Festival are very popular.

<text>At the Gates is a Swedish melodic death metal band from Gothenburg, formed in 1990. The band was a major progenitor of Gothenburg-style melodic death metal alongside In Flames and Dark Tranquillity. Prior to their first disbandment in 1996, At the Gates released four albums, ending with and including &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot; (1995), which has been seen as a landmark in the mid-1990s Swedish death metal scene. After reuniting for a one-off tour in 2008, the band reformed once again in 2011, and they have since released three more albums: &quot;At War with Reality&quot; (2014), &quot;To Drink from the Night Itself&quot; (2018) and &quot;The Nightmare of Being&quot; (2021).

==History==
===Early career (1990–1994)===
At the Gates were formed in late 1990 by former members of the death and black metal band Grotesque. They recorded a debut EP, &quot;Gardens of Grief&quot;, for the Dolores record label. The EP led the label Peaceville Records to sign the band, and they released their debut album, &quot;The Red in the Sky Is Ours&quot; in 1992.

After the recording of their second studio album, &quot;With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness&quot;, founding member and guitarist Alf Svensson left the band in 1993, to pursue tattoo artistry, graphic novel illustration and his solo electronic-opera-black metal project, Oxiplegatz. He was soon replaced by former House of Usher guitarist Martin Larsson, who the band knew from underground tape trading. The band continued touring Europe, and were filmed for a &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; special feature in Nottingham, England in July 1993.

===Success and breakthrough (1994–1996)===
In 1994, At the Gates released their third album, &quot;Terminal Spirit Disease&quot;, which was hailed as a breakthrough album.

The band continued touring and in 1995 released their most commercially and critically successful album: &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot;, on Earache Records. The album is regarded as their strongest death metal effort, compared to previous albums. This album firmly rooted the band as one of the leaders of the Swedish metal scene, the &quot;Gothenburg sound&quot; of melodic death metal. The band received international attention for the album, gaining them several U.S. tours and heavy rotation of the music video for &quot;Blinded by Fear&quot; on MTV in the United States, but despite this international success, the Björler brothers departed in 1996. The remaining members decided it would be impossible to continue without them, so the band broke up.

===Post-breakup (1996–2007)===
When At the Gates broke up in 1996, drummer Adrian Erlandsson, bassist Jonas Björler, and guitarist Anders Björler formed The Haunted. Tomas Lindberg went on working with different bands including Skitsystem, The Crown, Lock Up, and Nightrage. Erlandsson left in 1999 to join Cradle of Filth. In 2001, Peaceville Records released an At the Gates retrospective called &quot;Suicidal Final Art&quot;.

===Reunion (2007–2008)===

On 18 October 2007, At the Gates announced several reunion shows for mid-2008, including Getafe Electric Festival, Roskilde Festival, Ruisrock, Wacken Open Air, Graspop Metal Meeting, Sweden Rock Festival, Gods of Metal, Hellfest Summer Open Air and Bloodstock Open Air, as well as a tour of Japan with The Dillinger Escape Plan, Into Eternity, Pig Destroyer, and Mayhem in May 2008. Throughout July 2008, they toured the US and Canada on what was dubbed the &quot;Suicidal Final Tour&quot;, and played their final UK show at Bloodstock Open Air on Sunday on 17 August 2008. They finished their last show in Athens, Greece, with guest The Ocean on 21 September 2008. The band&#x27;s performance at Wacken Open Air in 2008 is available on &quot;The Flames of the End&quot; DVD boxed set, which also includes clips of songs from other venues and a documentary that covers the history of the band in its entirety.

===&quot;At War with Reality&quot; (2014–2016)===

On 21 January 2014, At the Gates released a video on YouTube showing a distorted video with lines of text on it, followed by text saying &quot;2014&quot;, possibly hinting toward possible lyrics for an upcoming album. On 27 January, the band revealed on Facebook via a new cover photo and profile picture, that their confirmed fifth record would be titled &quot;At War with Reality&quot; and would be released in the fall of 2014 through Century Media.

When asked whether &quot;At War with Reality&quot; is At the Gates&#x27; final album or if the band will continue recording, Tomas Lindberg replied, &quot;We can&#x27;t say really. We have no plans of stopping but we&#x27;ve broken promises before so it&#x27;s best not to say anything.&quot; In numerous recent interviews members of the band have expressed interest in doing a follow-up album. At the Gates concluded the touring cycle for &quot;At War with Reality&quot; in August 2016 with a festival appearance at &quot;Elb Riot&quot; in Hamburg, Germany.

=== &quot;To Drink from the Night Itself&quot; and &quot;The Nightmare of Being&quot; (2017–present) ===
On 8 March 2017, in an official statement released by the band, they announced that Anders Björler had departed from the band. Despite Anders&#x27; departure, they went on to confirm that they were working on a follow-up to 2014&#x27;s &quot;At War with Reality&quot;, which they were aiming to record and release in 2018. In September 2017, Jonas Stålhammar was announced as the new guitarist to take the place of Björler on a permanent basis, but he had joined too late to be involved in the writing process of the new album. They entered the studio to begin recording the album in November 2017, titled &quot;To Drink from the Night Itself&quot;, which was released through Century Media Records on 18 May 2018.

At the Gates released their seventh studio album, &quot;The Nightmare of Being&quot;, on 2 July 2021. While the album remains rooted in the Gothenburg metal tradition, it also features a wider range of musical styles, influences, and instrumentation. The ideas in the album are influenced by the writings of horror philosophers such as Thomas Ligotti and Eugene Thacker.

On 23 July 2022, At the Gates announced the departure of Stålhammar. On 5 October, the band announced that original guitarist Anders Björler had rejoined the band. They are now working on their 8th studio album following the return of Björler.

== Musical style and legacy ==
At the Gates&#x27; musical style has been described as melodic death metal and death metal. The band&#x27;s early work presented a &quot;progressive, complex way of crafting songs of dextrous[&quot;sic&quot;] melodic fluidity and variation&quot;, which would influence technical death metal, but also the black metal of Darkthrone&#x27;s &quot;Transilvanian Hunger,&quot; for instance. Most of this material was composed by Alf Svensson, who, according to guitarist Anders Björler, fused the Swedish melancholy of Nordic folk music with death metal and classical music.

The style of later At the Gates &quot;would inspire the whole Gothenburg region&quot;, but as Svensson had left the band, the commercial breakthrough &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot; was composed of more traditional song structures: &quot;[...] a stripped-down, no-frills melodic death album that hit all the basic points of the style&quot;.

==Awards==
At the Gates were nominated for a Swedish Grammy (Grammis) for &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot; in 1996, but didn&#x27;t win.
They won the Swedish Grammy (Grammis) in February 2015 for the 2014 comeback album &quot;At War with Reality&quot;.
The band were also awarded the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Inspiration Award in June 2015.

<text>An IBM Fellow is a position at IBM appointed by the CEO. Typically only four to nine (eleven in 2014) IBM Fellows are appointed each year, in May or June. Fellow is the highest honor a scientist, engineer, or programmer at IBM can achieve.

==Overview==

The IBM Fellows program was founded in 1962 by Thomas Watson Jr., as a way to promote creativity among the company&#x27;s &quot;most exceptional&quot; technical professionals and is granted in recognition of outstanding and sustained technical achievements and leadership in engineering, programming, services, science, design and technology. The first appointments were made in 1963. 

The criteria for appointment are stringent and take into account only the most-significant technical achievements. In addition to a history of extraordinary accomplishments, candidates must also be considered to have the potential to make continued contributions. Francis E. Hamilton is believed to be the first IBM Fellow, appointed in 1963 for amongst other things his work on the development of the IBM 650. In 1989, Fran Allen became the first female IBM Fellow.

IBM Fellows are given broad latitude to identify and pursue projects in their area of expertise.




, only 331 IBMers have earned the IBM Fellow distinction, and 84 of them remain active IBM employees. IBM Fellows have generated over 9,329 patents and thousands of government and professional citations, received five Nobel Prizes and five Turing Awards, and created a massive store of published research in scientific journals.

<doc id="587003" wikidata="Q185854" url="?curid=587003" title="Com Lag (2plus2isfive)">
<text>Com Lag (2plus2isfive) is an EP by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 24 March 2004. It compiles B-sides from Radiohead&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; (2003), along with remixes by Cristian Vogel and Four Tet and two live performances.

== Music ==
&quot;Paperbag Writer&quot;, whose title references the Beatles song &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;, features &quot;sinister fractured funk&quot;. &quot;I Am a Wicked Child&quot; is a &quot;tainted, eerie missive&quot; with harmonica. &quot;Where Bluebirds Fly&quot; is a &quot;rattling, fidgety&quot; electronic piece Radiohead used as the introduction music for their &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; tour. &quot;I Will (Los Angeles Version)&quot; is an alternative version of &quot;I Will&quot; from &quot;Hail to the Thief,&quot; and &quot;Fog (Again)&quot; is a live performance of the &quot;Amnesiac&quot; B-side &quot;Fog&quot;, rearranged for piano. The EP also includes remixes by Christian Vogel and Four Tet and a live version of &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot;.

== Cover art ==
The cover art is by Stanley Donwood, who has designed all artwork for Radiohead since 1994. Donwood said he imagined a range of Delftware that featured &quot;a modified bear, and a despot sperm monster&quot; and was &quot;loosely inspired by the work of Tadeusz Kantor.&quot; A jigsaw puzzle based on the cover was released in 2020.

== Release ==
&quot;Com Lag&quot; was released in Japan and Australia on 24 March 2004, in Canada on 13 April 2004, the United Kingdom on 16 April 2007, and in the United States on 8 May 2007. Early Japanese pressings were printed with a fault that produced static in some tracks.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing &quot;Com Lag&quot; for &quot;NME&quot;, Anthony Thornton wrote: &quot;Never content with relaxing into an accepted way of doing things, this record, while being flawed – it is a B-sides compilation after all – confirms Radiohead as the true inheritors of the Beatles&#x27; legacy rather than Oasis.&quot; The &quot;Paste&quot; critic Jeff Elbel described the &quot;Com Lag&quot; as &quot;an appealing but inessential curio&quot;. 

AllMusic&#x27;s Andy Kellman wrote: &quot;Naturally, the release isn&#x27;t nearly as cohesive as &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;; its apparent intent is to supply the fans with another stream of the band&#x27;s recordings, regardless of both how they fit together and how mixed the tracks are to begin with.&quot; Chris Ott of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote: &quot;You&#x27;d expect more from ideas that Radiohead fleshed out as a unit, but the stolen-time experiments and solo performances on this EP&#x27;s tail end far outshine its exhausting first half.&quot; In 2020, the &quot;Guardian&quot; named the &quot;thrilling&quot; live version of &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot; the 31st-greatest Radiohead song.

<text>The Ohio Art Company is an American toy manufacturing company founded in 1908. Based in Bryan, Ohio, the company is principally engaged in two lines of business. The first line of business is the sales, marketing, and distribution of toys. The second line of business is the company&#x27;s Diversified Products segment which manufactures custom metal lithography products for food container and specialty premium markets. Examples of these are food tins, enclosures, DVD cases, and nostalgic signs.

==History==
Henry Winzeler started up his own manufacturing company in 1908. He rented an area to work in Archbold, Ohio and named it the Ohio Art Company because of his profound interest in art and its location. Winzeler began making metal picture frames and various other novelty items that were sold in retail stores all over the US. The company moved locations in 1912 to Bryan, Ohio where it became even more successful with its Cupid Awake/Cupid Asleep picture frames. The Ohio Art Company then installed metal lithography equipment. This was used to produce picture frames made out of wood-grained metal sheets.

In 1917, the Ohio Art Company began manufacturing toys such as the windmills and climbing monkey. After World War I, the toy company grew exponentially, leading to the introduction of colorful tea sets and drums. In the late 1950s, a French electrician named André Cassagnes created a drawing toy that used a joystick, glass and aluminum powder. The combination, which he called the &quot;Telecran&quot;, gave users the ability to draw a picture and also erase it. After much collaboration with many individuals, the system they developed in the late 1950s is the same one used today. The name of the product was Etch A Sketch.

In the 1950s, a man named W.C Killgallon began working for the Ohio Art Company. The Killgallon family still owns and operates the Ohio Art Company. The final product of the Etch A Sketch was first produced on July 12, 1960 at the Bryan, Ohio factory. Another toy produced by Ohio Art in the 1960s was the Bizzy Buzz Buzz, invented by Bernard Benson. Though the Ohio Art Company partook in the toy industry and was very successful, the metal lithography sector of the company remains the core part of its business. It is one of the leading producers of specialty lithographic components.

In 1995, the Etch A Sketch toy was featured in the original &quot;Toy Story&quot;, in a scene where one performs a &quot;quick draw&quot; duel with Woody. This short 12 second feature was enough to give a significant sales boost, requiring the production line to work overtime to meet demand. By 1999, the company had again fallen into severe financial trouble from canceled orders of various products, reaching a point where the solvency of the company was in question. However, the company recovered with the prudent decision to agree to again have an Etch A Sketch appear in an animated feature film - this time in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. This scene featured an Etch A Sketch being used to present sketches related to the investigation of Woody&#x27;s kidnapping. At 45 seconds, the scene in question was much longer than the scene in the original movie. The exposure from the highly successful Pixar movie resulted in sales of the toy increasing by 20 percent and ensured the survival of the company.

On February 11, 2016, The Ohio Art Company announced that it has sold its Etch A Sketch and Doodle Sketch brands to Canada-based Spin Master, in a move designed to allow it to focus on its metal lithography business and invest in its manufacturing operations in Bryan. Ohio Art&#x27;s other toy lines were not included in the sale, however, the company no longer makes toys of any kind.

<text>James Love Barksdale (born January 24, 1943) is an American executive who served as the president and CEO of Netscape from January 1995 until the company merged with AOL in March 1999.

==Early life==
James Barksdale was born in Jackson, Mississippi. He received a B.A. in Business Administration from the University of Mississippi in 1965. While there, Barksdale became a member of the Eta chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

==Career==
As CEO of Netscape, Barksdale was called before Congress several times during hearings about Microsoft and its alleged abuse of its operating system monopoly to dominate the web browser market (see also: Browser wars). At one point he addressed the entire room: &quot;How many of you use Intel-based PCs in this audience, not Macintoshes?&quot; Most people in the room raised their hands. &quot;Of that group who use PCs, how many of you use a PC without Microsoft&#x27;s operating system?&quot; All of the hands went down. He said to the Senate panel, &quot;Gentlemen, that is a monopoly.&quot;

Before Netscape, Barksdale had worked as CEO of McCaw Cellular/AT&amp;T Wireless and, before that, as Vice President and COO of FedEx. After departing Netscape, he founded The Barksdale Group, an investment and advisory group created for the purpose of helping Internet service companies. He served on the boards of AOL and its successors (AOL Time Warner and then TimeWarner), as well as Sun Microsystems, myCFO, FedEx (until 2018) and Mississippi Today. President George W. Bush appointed him to the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board in 2002.

Between March and July 2009, construction crews working for Barksdale&#x27;s Spread Networks completed a nearly straight fiber-optic link between Chicago and New York City. By shaving 3 milliseconds off the previously fastest connection between these two trading centers, Barksdale, according to some industry insiders, can charge 8 to 10 times the going rate because any algorithmic trading algorithm not operating on his network is at a significant speed disadvantage. The line was built almost entirely with his personal funds and in secret lest a competitor attempt to build another line before he was able to finish it.

==Personal life and philanthropy==
He and his late wife, Sally, gave a US$5.4 million endowment to the University of Mississippi to help form the McDonnell-Barksdale Honors College. In January 2000, they gave US$100 million to the State of Mississippi to create The Barksdale Reading Institute, a joint venture with the Mississippi Department of Education and the state&#x27;s public universities.

His wife, Sally Barksdale, died of cancer in 2003. He has three children and five grandchildren. To honor his deceased wife, Barksdale asked that the Honors College be renamed the Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College.

In 2005, he married Donna Kennedy Sones of Jackson, Mississippi. Between them they have six children and five grandchildren. Barksdale&#x27;s latest gift, given in conjunction with his wife Donna, created the Mississippi Principal Corps at the University of Mississippi that will change the way the state&#x27;s school principals are trained.

His brother, Rhesa Barksdale, is a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

<doc id="587035" wikidata="Q217138" url="?curid=587035" title="Bocas del Toro Province">
<text>Bocas del Toro(; meaning &quot;Mouths of the Bull&quot;) is a province of Panama. Its area is 4,643.9 square kilometers, comprising the mainland and nine main islands. The province consists of the Bocas del Toro Archipelago, Bahía Almirante (Almirante Bay), Chiriquí Lagoon, and adjacent mainland. The capital is the city of Bocas del Toro (or Bocas Town) on Isla Colón (Colón Island). Other major cities or towns include Almirante and Changuinola. The province has a population of 159,228 as of 2023.

Christopher Columbus and his crew first visited the area in 1502. Bocas del Toro borders the Caribbean Sea to the north, Limón Province of Costa Rica to the west, Chiriquí Province to the south, and Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca to the east. The Río Sixaola forms part of the border with Costa Rica. A newly constructed bridge spans the river between Guabito and Sixaola, Costa Rica. The bridge is a border crossing used by tourists going between destinations in Bocas del Toro and Costa Rica. Walk across the bridge via the pedestrian causeway or register your vehicle in advance to cross between 8am and 6pm (Panamá time, Costa Rica is an hour earlier).

The province contains two national parks, Isla Bastimentos National Marine Park and La Amistad International Park. The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute operates a research station on Colón Island just northwest of Bocas Town. There are many banana plantations in Bocas del Toro, often called the &quot;oro verde&quot;, or green gold of Central America.

== History ==
Christopher Columbus explored the area in 1502 while searching for the passage to the Pacific Ocean. Columbus&#x27;s original name for the island was Isla del Drago. In colonial times, Bocas del Toro was part of Veraguas. It was originally part of Costa Rica until, in one of many territorial disputes, Colombia took control of it with armed forces. The then government made a reservation called Bocas del Toro in 1834. In 1850, Bocas del Toro became a part of Chiriqui, then was separated from it and became part of Colon. On November 16, 1903, Bocas del Toro was separated from Colon and became its own province. In 1941, Bocas del Toro was divided into two districts, Bocas del Toro and Crimamola. Four years later, it became part of the same division as before. In 1970, Bocas del Toro district became Changuinola, the district of Bastimentos was eliminated, and three new districts were added, making the province what it is today. The districts&#x27; areas changed in 1997 when the Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca was created.

The province is the home of the unique Bocas del Toro Creole of English.

== Administrative divisions ==
Bocas del Toro Province is divided into 4 districts and 30 &quot;corregimientos&quot;. On 8 June 2015 the new Almirante District was created, after splitting out from Changuinola District.

* The area of Almirante District is included in the figure quoted for Changuinola District, from which Almirante was divided.

<doc id="587040" wikidata="Q739651" url="?curid=587040" title="Chiriquí Province">
<text>Chiriquí () is a province of Panama located on the western coast; it is the second most developed province in the country, after Panamá Province. Its capital is the city of David. It has a total area of 6,490.9 km2, with a population of 471,071 as of the year 2023.
The province of Chiriquí is bordered to the north by the province of Bocas del Toro, to the west by Costa Rica, to the east by the province of Veraguas, and to the south by the Pacific Ocean, specifically the Gulf of Chiriquí.

==History==
Until the arrival of the Spanish &quot;conquistadores&quot;, Chiriquí was populated by a number of indigenous tribes, known collectively as the Guaymí people.

The first European to visit and describe Chiriquí was Gaspar de Espinosa, in 1519. The province was officially established on 26 May 1849, when Panama was still part of Colombia. Several years later, President Abraham Lincoln of the United States proposed Chiriquí as a favored location for Linconia, a colony for free blacks from the United States. Only 349 accepted the offer. Most blacks were not interested.

Chiriquí was the province in which Manuel Noriega rose in the military ranks in the late 20th century; he helped bring Omar Torrijos back into the country after a coup d&#x27;état. Noriega had jeeps lined up with their lights on the runway in David to allow Torrijos&#x27;s aircraft to land. Chiriqui was at the heart of a short-lived pro-democracy guerrilla movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s. After the dictatorship by Manuel Noriega from 1983 to 1989, Guillermo Endara became president of Panama; he appointed Edgar De Puy as governor of Chiriquí.

==Administrative divisions==
Chiriquí Province is divided into 13 &quot;distritos&quot; (districts) and sub-divided into 100 &quot;corregimientos&quot;, although a 14th district and an additional corregimiento took effect from May 2019.


Note: Through Law 55 of 13 September 2013, the creation of Tierras Altas District had been approved, consisting of the &quot;corregimientos&quot; of Cerro Punta, Cuesta de Piedra, Nueva California, Paso Ancho and Volcán, which were split off from Bugaba District. The new district was to have Volcán as its main centre. Also through that same law, the &quot;corregimiento&quot; of Solano was created, after splitting off from the &quot;corregimiento&quot; of La Concepción, Bugaba. That new administrative division within Chiriquí Province was to come into effect by 2 May 2019.

==Climate==
The province features a variety of climates, from hot and humid lowlands to the cool and moist highlands. The district is home to Fortuna Forest Reserve.

<text>Coclé () is a province of central Panama on the nation&#x27;s southern coast. The administrative capital is the city of Penonomé. This province was created by the Act of September 12, 1855 with the title of Department of Coclé during the presidency of Dr. Justo de Arosemena. It became a province, Decretory Number 190, on October 20, 1985. Coclé is primarily an agricultural area, with sugar and tomatoes as major crops. The province has a number of well-known beaches, such as Santa Clara, Farallon and Rio Hato, and tourist activity has increased in recent years. It covers an area of 4,946.6 km2, and had a population of 268,264 in 2023.

== Pre-Columbian Coclé ==

During pre-Columbian times, the area of Panama which today includes Coclé province had a number of identifiable native cultures. Archaeologists have loosely designated these cultures by pottery style. The poorly studied La Mula period ranged from 150 BC to AD 300. It was followed by the Tonosi period, from AD 300 to AD 550, and by the Cubita period, from AD 550 to AD 700. A unified Indigenous culture appears to have flourished in this area from approximately 1200 BC until the 16th century.

== Administrative divisions ==
Coclé Province is divided into 6 &quot;distritos&quot; (districts) and subdivided into 44 &quot;corregimientos&quot;.

== Research and conservation ==
Parque Nacional General de División Omar Torrijos Herrera, established around the crash site of former Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos, is located in the northeastern portion of Coclé. Parque Omar, as it is known, enjoys some legal protection as a national park.

Coclé is also home to APROVACA orchid conservation center, which conducts orchid conservation activities, including orchid reintroduction into the wild and a sponsorship program for the Panamanian national flower &quot;Peristeria elata&quot;.

Folklorist Rosita Liao Gonzales was awarded the Order of Manuel José Hurtado for her work categorizing the cultures of Coclé Province.

<doc id="587046" wikidata="Q911278" url="?curid=587046" title="Los Santos Province">
<text>Los Santos () is a province in Panama, reaching from the La Villa river in the North to the Pacific Ocean in the south and east. It is part of the Azuero Peninsula, bounded by the province of Herrera to the north and northeast, and by Mariato District of Veraguas Province to the West. The City of Las Tablas is the capital and most populous city. There are seven administrative districts under the jurisdiction of Los Santos Province. Los Santos&#x27;s area is 3,809.4 km ², and its population is 98,466 inhabitants in 2023.

In this region are the oldest human settlements in the Isthmus of Panama. It was part of the cultural region of Gran Cocle where one of the first ceramic styles of the Americas developed. The first Europeans to explore Los Santos were the Spanish in 1515 under the command of Gonzalo de Badajoz. Upon the arrival of Europeans the area was ruled by the cacique Antataura or Cutara, and was known as the Land of Mr. Paris or Parita from Ngäbere Bari-ta meaning Confederation of Peoples, having under his control six other Indigenous chiefdoms: Guararí, Quemá, Chiracoitia, Huere, Guanata and Usagaña. The only province that was not under his dominion was Escoria. Gaspar de Espinosa succeeded in conquering and annexing Pariba to the Spanish Empire in 1516, decimating nearly all of the native population.

Geographically, Los Santos is located in the &#x27;Arco Seco&#x27;, name given to the strip of land between the Gulf of Panama and the Central Mountain range which includes areas of the provinces of Coclé, Herrera and Veraguas in the south of the Isthmus of Panama. Its climate is mainly a tropical savanna climate with moderate temperatures, strongly influenced by the winds of the Pacific Ocean crashing against the mountains, and the Humboldt Current. The average annual rainfall is 1,200 mm, allowing the growth of either dry or humid rainforest. Its highest point is located at the peak of Cerro Hoya with 1559 metres. Other major peaks are Cambutal hill (1400 metres) and Mount The Ñopos (1068 metres).

The modern province of Los Santos, was created in January 1945 replacing the defunct province of Azuero according to Cabinet Decree No. 13, leaving its territorial regime regulated by the second chapter of the Law 58 of July 29, 1998, losing the Territory of Quebro in this process.

Although Los Santos closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Panama, and the vast majority of the population speaks Spanish, the province has retained a distinct cultural identity. Los Santos&#x27; culture is the result of the passage of different peoples and civilizations that, over time, have shaped a particular cultural identity. These people, some very different from each other, have been slowly leaving an imprint seated among the inhabitants. It is one of the last regions in Panama where Spanish voseo is the standard form for use.

== Toponymy ==
As is common in most of Panama, the province took its name from its ancient capital, La Villa de Los Santos. Founded on November 1569, All Saints&#x27; Day, takes its name from this Catholic celebration. The Day of All Saints is a Christian tradition instituted in honor of All Saints, known and unknown, as Pope Urban IV, to compensate for any lack of the feasts of the saints during the year by the faithful. It has roots in the Celtic festival of Samhain or Samain. The Saints (&lt;Latin sanctus, -i; [&#x27;chosen by God&#x27;]) are distinguished men and women in the various religious traditions for their alleged special relationship with the gods.

== Symbols ==
The official Sports flag of Los Santos is composed of the colors orange and black, adorned with seven stars representing the seven districts of the province of Los Santos.

The flag consists of three equal horizontal stripes, coloured red, blue and yellow respectively. It is based on the chromatic composition created in 1801 by Francisco Miranda, precursor of Latin American independence, who flew the pavilion in Jacmel, Haiti for the first time. As to the meaning of the colors, the most accepted hypothesis states that it is based on the primary colors as perceived by the iris. A second theory states that it is based on the colors of the primitive coat of arms of Christopher Columbus; and lastly, a third theory says that it is based on the colors of the uniforms of the Burgerwache in Hamburg. The first theory is based in a letter, where Miranda describes a conversation with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe about its Theory of colours at a party hosted in the city of Weimar in 1785. The santeños Patriots took this model to represent Los Santos in 1821 in the battle to gain independence from Spain. With the creation of the province of Azuero on April 4, 1850 this flag became the official flag of the province and subsequently, became the official flag of Los Santos province, heir of the former Azuero province.

== Climate ==
Located in the tropics, Los Santos has a rainy season which stretches from May to November, and a dry season extending from late December to early May. According to the Köppen climate classification, the province of Los Santos has a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;). The southeast of Los Santos is usually warmer and drier than the west, owing to the influence of Pacific Ocean currents and altitude. Rainfall varies widely across Los Santos. The eastern highlands of Los Santos are the wettest, with annual rainfall in a few places like Cerro Hoya and Canajagua exceeding . In comparison, much of lowland Los Santos receives less than annually. Temperatures range between on the coast, with a minimum of in the mountain region. These variations are caused by the mountains of Azuero range and rainfall that occur over very short distances.

== Geography and natural history ==

The mainland of Los Santos comprises most of the southern portion of the Azuero Peninsula, which lies in the south of Panama and two main islands, Iguana Island and Cañas Island, and the small Isla Frailes del Norte and Isla Frailes del Sur. The total area is 3,809.4 km2 with 214 km2 of coast shores, comparable to the size of Cape Verde. Los Santos&#x27;s border with Herrera to the north, runs along La Villa river, which exerts a natural border, although both sides of the river show the same landscape. The Pacific Ocean borders the south and east with a large area of coastline, giving it a major maritime landscape. Finally, Mariato District west border is characterized by its mountainous natural shape, separating the Gulf of Montijo in Veraguas from the valleys of Tonosi.

=== Relief ===

Los Santos is in the Azuero Peninsula in the Isthmus of Panama. The major geographical features of the province are determined by three morphostructural regions which are characterized by its elevations. It is clearly divided into three zones: the mountainous area dominated by the Azuero mountain ranges: Western Azuero range and Eastern Azuero range, known locally as sierra de Azuero. The mountains are an extension of the Cordillera Central extending south until its extinction in coastal Búcaro and Cañas. There are few valleys, prominent among them are the Tonosí and Rico valley. A transitional zone of low hills and clustered mainly in the central southern part of the province hills. A third area in low-lying coastal regions coastal plains and sedimentary basins, where the hilly reliefs that are part of the foothills of the mountains predominate.

The coastline of Los Santos is characterized by an overwhelming predominance of beaches and coastal lowlands with the presence of some cliffs especially in the southern part of the Sierra de Azuero in Tonosí. Mangroves and small dune formations are the most characteristic element of the coastal relief. The beaches are dissipative, fine golden sand on the north and darke volcanic in the south, with annual variations in the coastline that can be labeled due to winter storms.

===Flora and fauna===

Los Santos’ wildlife is typical of Panama with several distinctions. The province is home to 62 bird species. Because of its long coastline Los Santos hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of egrets, herons and cormorants. It is also, the largest nesting site in Panama for the frigatebird, with a population of more than 5000 in Isla Iguana Wildlife Refuge.

==== Azuero&#x27;s monkeys ====
Los Santos is home to five of the seven monkeys species living in Panama, some of them critically endangered: Saguinus geoffroyi, Azuero Howler Monkey, Azuero Spider Monkey, Western Capuchin Monkey and Golden-mantled howling monkey.

== National Parks in Los Santos ==

Los Santos has 6 national parks: La Tronosa, Tonosí, Cerro Hoya, Cerro Canajagua, Santa Ana and El Colmón. It has five wildlife refuges. These areas include El Peñón de la Honda, Isla Cañas, Isla Iguana, Pablo Arturo Barrios and La Marinera. The coastline of La Enea and El Espinal corregimiento and the basin of Cacao and Mensabé river are also protected.

Of those households, 17,352 were married couples living together, 22,679 were co-habiting couples and 10,947 were lone parents or widowers. The unadjusted figures were subsequently altered to take into account under-enumeration, giving an amended mid-year estimate for 2010 of 94,011.

The 2010 census showed that 5,252 residents or 6.6% of the population is illiterate. The ethnicity of Los Santos according to data of the 2010 census was composed mainly by descendants of Spanish and Mestizos, composing 98% of the residents.

<text>The National Museum of the Romanian Peasant () is a museum in Bucharest, Romania, with a collection of textiles (especially costumes), icons, ceramics, and other artifacts of Romanian peasant life. One of Europe&#x27;s leading museums of popular arts and traditions, it was designated &quot;European Museum of the Year&quot; for 1996.

==Description==
Located on Șoseaua Kiseleff, near Piața Victoriei, the museum falls under the patronage of the Romanian Ministry of Culture. Its collection includes over 100,000 objects.

First founded in 1906 by and originally managed by Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, the museum was reopened 5 February 1990, a mere six weeks after the downfall and execution of Nicolae Ceaușescu. During the Communist era, the building housed a museum representing the country&#x27;s Communist party; the museum&#x27;s basement still contains a room devoted to an ironic display of some artifacts from that earlier museum. The building, which uses traditional Romanian architectural features, was built on the former site of the State Mint (&quot;Monetăria Statului&quot;). Initially intended as a museum of Romanian art, it was designed by Nicolae Ghica-Budești and built between 1912 and 1941. The building is listed as a historic monument by Romania&#x27;s Ministry of Culture and National Identity.

The museum was devastated during the June 1990 Mineriad, due to being confused with the headquarters of the National Peasants&#x27; Party.

One of the museum&#x27;s most famous exhibits—originally the work of Tzigara-Samurcaș—is &quot;the house in the house&quot;. The house, which originally belonged to peasant Antonie Mogos of Ceauru village in Gorj County. From the first, the house was displayed in a non-naturalistic way: objects that would normally be in the interior were displayed in various manners outside; outbuildings were suggested by fragments. The Communist regime displayed the house much more conventionally, outdoors at the Village Museum; it returned to the Museum of the Romanian Peasant in 2002. The current display at the museum revives the original non-naturalistic approach. For example, from a platform, museum visitors may peer into the attic, part of whose wall is stripped away; various objects are arranged inside.

In 2002, the museum&#x27;s exhibit space was greatly expanded as the museum store and offices moved into a new building behind the old one, freeing up a considerable amount of floor space in the museum proper.

<text>Veraguas () is a province of Panama, located in the centre-west of the country. The capital is the city of Santiago de Veraguas. It is the only Panamanian province to border both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It covers an area of 10,587.6 km² and in 2023 it had a population of 259,791.

== History ==

Veraguas was originally inhabited by the Veraguas culture.

Veraguas was explored by Christopher Columbus on his fourth voyage. He tried to establish the first colony in the new Spanish mainland but failed due to resistance from Indigenous peoples. Diego de Nicuesa also tried to establish a colony and failed, which made him create a colony to fight against the Indigenous population, which he named Nombre de Dios. Its capital, Santiago de Veraguas, was founded about 1636.

A province called Veraguas containing Santiago de Veraguas, but with changing boundaries over time, existed in Gran Colombia, the Republic of New Granada, and at times during the Panama State era.

It is said that its name comes from the indigenous word &quot;Veracua&quot; or &quot;Viragua&quot;, though other theories abound. It is the only province in Panama with coastlines on both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The majority of people live on the Pacific side; the Caribbean coast is mostly uninhabited.

== Tourism ==
Veraguas has many groups of inhabitants, mainly of Spanish/Indigenous origin named &quot;campesinos&quot;. This land offers tourists and visitors close contact with nature. Forests, mountains, coasts, and islands where there are more than 200 varieties of orchids; more than 400 species of birds, in addition to mammals, reptiles, and insects.

Veraguas has various national parks. The Coiba National Park, (with the largest coral reef of the Pacific Coast of America), Cerro Hoya National Park (covers the southwest part of the Azuero Peninsula and the sea that surrounds it), Santa Fe National Park (a forest in the northern region), La Yeguada Forest reserve (with a great artificial lake for the production of electricity) and El Montuoso Forest reserve.

Beaches such as Playa Santa Catalina, Playa Mariato, Malena, and Torio offer great places for recreation, surfing, and fishing. Other famous touristic areas is the &quot;Iglesia de San Francisco de la Montaña&quot;. This church has a Baroque architecture and dates back to 1727. It was declared a National Historical Monument on January 27, 1937.

== Administrative divisions ==
Veraguas Province is divided into 12 &quot;distritos&quot; (districts) and subdivided into 104 &quot;corregimientos&quot;.

<doc id="587055" wikidata="Q1579196" url="?curid=587055" title="Naxos (company)">
<text>Naxos comprises numerous companies, divisions, imprints, and labels specializing in classical music but also audiobooks and other genres. The premier label is Naxos Records, which focuses on classical music. Naxos Musical Group encompasses about 17 labels including Naxos Records, Naxos Audiobooks, and Naxos Books (ebooks). There are about an additional 50 labels that are independent of the Naxos Musical Group with a wide range of offerings.

The company was founded in 1987 by Klaus Heymann, a German-born resident of Hong Kong.

==Naxos Records==
Naxos Records is a record label specializing in classical music. The company was known for its budget pricing of discs, with simpler artwork and design than most other labels. In the 1980s, Naxos primarily recorded central and eastern European symphony orchestras, often with lesser-known conductors, as well as upcoming and unknown musicians, to minimize recording costs and maintain its budget prices.

In more recent years, Naxos has taken advantage of the expiring copyrights of other companies&#x27; studio recordings by selling discs remastered from gramophone records. Examples include the complete recordings of opera singers such as Enrico Caruso, Amelita Galli-Curci, and Titta Ruffo and the 1934 world première performance of Howard Hanson&#x27;s opera &quot;Merry Mount&quot;. Legal restrictions prevented some of these recordings from being sold in the United States. Naxos has also recorded the music of contemporary composers, including Leonardo Balada, Bechara El-Khoury, Laurent Petitgirard, and Alla Pavlova. The label has branched out into jazz, world music, and books on musical subjects. Naxos Spoken Word Library contains non-music products, such as audiobooks and radio dramas.

In 2003, it began a paid subscription service for listening on the Internet that offers its complete catalogue and the Naxos Music Library. As of 2019, subscribers had access to 2,225,190 tracks on its 145,755 discs, though these numbers were increasing by nearly 100 new discs a day. In 2015, it launched a high-definition download and streaming service, ClassicsOnline HD•LL, with a catalogue drawn from a number of classical record labels.

===Distribution===
Naxos Global Logistics, based in Poing near Munich, was founded in 2008 to expand the services offered to its distributed labels, including manufacturing, marketing, and licensing.

===Awards===
In 2005, Naxos won the Label of the Year Award at Classic FM/&quot;Gramophone&quot; awards. In 2023, they won the Label of the Year Award at the International Classical Music Awards.

<text>The South River is a tributary of the Black River, approximately long, in southeastern North Carolina in the United States.

It rises 2 miles northeast of Falcon, at the border of Sampson and Cumberland counties at the confluence of Mingo Swamp and the smaller Black River. The smaller Black River flows 30 miles from northeastern Harnett County, in Angier and approximately 25 mi (40 km) south of Raleigh. The smaller Black River flows south-southeast past Benson, then south-southwest, passing west of Dunn. East of Fayetteville, the South River turns south-southeast and joins the larger Black River near Ivanhoe approximately 30 mi (48 km) northwest of Wilmington.

The South River forms much of the western border of Sampson County, as well as the eastern borders of Bladen County and Cumberland County.

== Fishing ==
The South River is home to a wide variety of fish species, including largemouth bass, chain pickerel, various species of sunfish, longnose gar, and catfish. To navigate through the river, a kayak or a small johnboat is recommended.

<doc id="587102" wikidata="Q2094724" url="?curid=587102" title="Hummel (instrument)">
<text>The hummel (also hommel or humle) is an old Northern European stringed instrument similar to an older type of zither and is related to the Norwegian langeleik.

==History==
The hummel is probably from the Middle Ages, when it was found all over Europe in slightly differing variants. The instrument was common in the Netherlands, Flanders, Northern Germany and Denmark during the 18th century. The earliest evidence of the instrument in Swedish folk culture is from the 17th century, and it seems to have been most common in the southern parts of the country. During the 19th century, the hummel was considered to be a primitive peasant instrument and its popularity dwindled. In Flanders, these instruments appeared during the 17th century and were popular with soldiers in the trenches during World War I, climaxing in the 1920s and 1930s but by the 1930s they returned to obscurity. They were mainly a family instruments and were widely played by women. Some enthusiasts have taken up playing it again since the folk revival of the 1970s.

==Construction==

The hummel has many related forms. Common to all varieties is a flat top and bottom. There are variations in the type of wood it is made from, but the wood is always thin. On the top of the instrument are one or more soundholes. The strings vary in number, but often include a smaller number of melody strings and a greater number of accompanying strings. It is not uncommon to have three melody strings: two tuned identically, and the third tuned one octave below the others. Under the melody strings, either directly on the body or attached to a fretboard, are about 17 frets. The body comes in two main forms, either a pear-shaped form with the strings in the middle, or a half-pear with the strings near the edge.

==Playing==

The hummel is placed on a table like a zither, to amplify the sound. The melody strings are sounded by being plucked downwards, either with fingers or a plectrum. The identically tuned melody strings are often fretted in unison or so to create a major third. It is possible to play a sixth interval, through using the octave string. The strings are played with a plectrum and are often all played at once. This is common because the accompaniment strings are tuned to a suitable chord that is relatively open, for example all the strings may be tuned to D or A.

<doc id="587106" wikidata="Q6502226" url="?curid=587106" title="Lava flow (programming)">
<text>In computer programming jargon, lava flow is an anti-pattern that occurs when computer source code written under sub-optimal conditions is deployed into a production environment and subsequently expanded upon while still in a developmental state. The term derives from the natural occurrence of lava which, once cooled, solidifies into rock that is difficult to remove. Similarly, such code becomes difficult to refactor or replace due to dependencies that arise over time, necessitating the maintenance of backward compatibility with the original, incomplete design.

== Causes ==
Lava flow can occur due to a variety of reasons within a software development process:
* Pressure to meet deadlines leading to temporary solutions becoming permanent
* Inadequate documentation which prevents understanding of the code’s purpose
* Lack of automated tests which makes refactoring risky
* Frequent changes in the development team leading to loss of knowledge

== Consequences ==
Unrefined code that becomes part of the software’s infrastructure increases the complexity of the system and the codebase becomes increasingly difficult to understand and maintain. It leads to:
* The need for backward compatibility which can stifle innovation and prevent adoption of newer, more efficient solutions
* Increased technical debt that accumulates over time, resulting in higher costs of change and maintenance
* Obstacles to refactoring or improving the system due to fear of breaking dependent components

== Impact on teams ==
Development teams often experience the impact of lava flow when team members cycle in and out:
* Loss of knowledge about aspects of the system&#x27;s code when original developers leave
* Reluctance among new developers to refactor unfamiliar code, leading to further complexity as they add rather than clean up

== Mitigation strategies ==
Several practices can mitigate the effects of the lava flow anti-pattern:
* Promoting good documentation practices for clear understanding of code
* Encouraging regular code reviews to catch suboptimal practices early
* Prioritizing refactoring as an integral part of the development lifecycle
* Maintaining a comprehensive suite of automated tests to reduce risk in changes

<doc id="587107" wikidata="Q5457807" url="?curid=587107" title="Flat Stanley">
<text>Flat Stanley is an American children&#x27;s book series written by author Jeff Brown (January 1, 1926 – December 3, 2003). The idea for the book began as a bedtime story for Brown’s sons, which Brown turned into the first Flat Stanley book. The first book featured illustrations by Tomi Ungerer and was published in 1964. Brown did not continue the series until two decades later, when he published five more books: &quot;Stanley and the Magic Lamp&quot;, &quot;Stanley in Space&quot;, &quot;Stanley’s Christmas Adventure&quot;, &quot;Invisible Stanley&quot;, and &quot;Stanley, Flat Again!&quot; 

By 2003, the Flat Stanley series had sold almost one million copies in the United States, and the stories had been translated into French, German, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, and Hebrew.

Since Brown&#x27;s death in 2003, other children&#x27;s book authors, including Sara Pennypacker and Josh Greenhut, have continued the series under a new name, &quot;Flat Stanley&#x27;s Worldwide Adventures&quot;.

In 2009, a musical adaptation, also entitled &quot;Flat Stanley&quot;, opened at the Djanogly Theatre, Nottingham. It featured a script by Mike Kenny and songs by Julian Butler. The musical was well received and was revived in 2014 for a short tour.

==Synopsis of the original book==
The book recounts the adventures of Stanley Lambchop after he is squashed flat by a bulletin board while sleeping. He is otherwise uninjured, and decides to make the best of being flat. Soon, Stanley discovers that he is able to enter locked rooms by sliding under the door. Over the course of the story, he is also rolled up to go out to a park, and he is used as a kite by his younger brother, Arthur. Another special advantage of being flat is that Flat Stanley can visit his friends in California by being mailed in a large envelope, allowing him to avoid the cost of a train or airplane ticket. Later, Stanley even helps catch art thieves at a museum by disguising himself as a painting on the wall. However, Stanley eventually becomes tired of his flatness, and Arthur restores Stanley’s proper shape with a bicycle pump.

The book is an example of a novel of circulation, a novel that follows the travels of an object as a main character.

==Books in the series==
Books by Jeff Brown:
*&quot;Flat Stanley&quot; (1964)
*&quot;Stanley and the Magic Lamp&quot; (1983) – Stanley and Arthur discover a magic lamp containing a genie.
*&quot;Stanley In Space&quot; (1990) – The Lambchops are sent into space by the President to forge peace with a group of miniature humanoid aliens who inhabit the newly discovered planet Tyrra.
*&quot;Stanley&#x27;s Christmas Adventure&quot; (1993) – Santa Claus&#x27;s daughter, Sarah Christmas, arrives unexpectedly in the Lambchop household during the holiday season, and convinces them to help bring back Santa&#x27;s jolly spirit.

==The Flat Stanley Project ==

The Flat Stanley Project began in 1995 under the direction of Dale Hubert, a third grade school teacher in London, Ontario, Canada. The project is meant to facilitate letter-writing between schoolchildren as they document where Flat Stanley has accompanied them around the world. The goal of the project is to increase reading and writing skills, as well as teaching children about people and cultures from different places. Dale Hubert received the Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Teaching Excellence in 2001 for his work in creating the Flat Stanley Project.

The Flat Stanley Project provides an opportunity for students to make connections with students from other member schools who have signed up for the project. Students begin by reading the book and becoming familiar with Flat Stanley&#x27;s story. Then, they create paper &quot;Flat Stanleys&quot; (representative drawings of the Stanley Lambchop character) and keep a journal for a few days, documenting the places and activities in which Flat Stanley is involved. Each student&#x27;s Flat Stanley and its respective journal are then mailed to students at other schools. The students at those schools are asked to treat the Flat Stanley as a visiting guest and add to the respective journal, then return them both after a short period of time. The project has many similarities to the traveling gnome prank, except that the Flat Stanley Project focuses more on literacy.

As a part of the project, students may plot Flat Stanley&#x27;s travels on maps and share the contents of their journals. Additionally, Flat Stanleys often return with a photo or postcard from their visit. Despite the project&#x27;s traditional reliance on letters, some teachers prefer to use e-mail due to its quicker travel time.

In 2008, more than 6,000 classes from 47 countries took part in the Flat Stanley Project.
=== Arranging exchanges ===
Teachers can register and arrange exchanges with other classrooms on the Flat Stanley Project website. Another option is for teachers to ask students to get their parents&#x27; permission to address an envelope and send the paper doll to a friend or relative in another state.

The Flat Stanley Project uses blogs for teachers, parents and students to publish stories, describe local traditions and scenery, and post photos.

=== In popular culture ===
The project was featured in the 2004 episode of the animated TV series &quot;King of the Hill&quot; &quot;How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Alamo&quot;, in which Nancy Gribble receives a Flat Stanley in the mail. Peggy Hill and Luanne Platter photograph it in a number of dangerous situations, resulting in the school&#x27;s Flat Stanley Project being canceled.

According to the February 26, 2009 broadcast of &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, Flat Stanley was on board the US Airways Flight 1549, which landed safely in the Hudson River. He was carried to safety in the briefcase of his traveling companion.

In early 2010, Darren Haas, a Flat Stanley advocate and applications architect, approached Dale Hubert with the idea of turning the Flat Stanley Project concept into an app for the iPhone. The app was released in late 2010, but is no longer available in the App Store. 

Also in 2010, fans of the baseball team St. Louis Cardinals were asked (via the team website) to petition US President Barack Obama to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Baseball Hall of Famer Stan Musial. A &quot;Flat Stan&quot; downloadable cutout figure was made available to encourage Cardinals fans to take photos with Musial&#x27;s caricature and send them in as petitions.

Flat Stanley appears in the 2014 Jeff Kinney novel Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul.

In 2022, cast member Sarah Sherman held up a Flat Stanley during the closing credits of an episode of Saturday Night Live.

Dog Man Unleashed – the second in the series of Dog Man novels – contains an homage to Flat Stanley: the antagonist feigns a crush by cutting out a cardboard likeness of himself, and inserts it under a bulletin board.

<text>Andy Savoy (born July 12, 1963) is a Canadian politician and engineer.

==Early life==
Savoy was raised in Victoria County in the Perth-Andover, New Brunswick area and educated at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton where he earned a Bachelor of Science in engineering as well as a Master of Business Administration.

==Entrance to politics==
Elected to the Perth-Andover village council in 1989, he represented the village on the Grand Falls Regional Economic Development Commission before resigning in 1991, when he moved to Fredericton to work for the Research and Productivity Council.

In 2000, Savoy ran for Parliament in the conservative-minded riding Tobique—Mactaquac for the Liberal Party. Savoy defeated the incumbent-Member of Parliament (MP), Progressive Conservative Gilles Bernier by only 150 votes. His share of the vote was only 34%, compared to 33% for Bernier and 29% for Canadian Alliance candidate Adam Richardson—the smallest plurality of any successful candidate in that election.

After his first election, he became the first MP from Atlantic Canada to be elected chair of the Rural Caucus of the Liberal Party. On February 4, 2004, he was elected chair of the National Liberal Caucus, the first Atlantic Canadian to hold the post since Brian Tobin in the 1980s.

Despite his success in his first term in office, pundits suggested that Savoy faced a tough battle for re-election especially with the creation of the new Conservative Party of Canada out of the old Progressive Conservative and Canadian Alliance parties whose combined vote in 2000 was 63%. This was not the case as Savoy was re-elected by a margin of 3,008 votes, beating the Conservative candidate Mike Allen 48% to 39%. However, in the 2006 election his luck did not continue, his party lost the election nationally and he too was defeated by Allen by a margin of 254 votes.

Provincial Liberal leader Shawn Graham made comments in the press immediately following Savoy&#x27;s federal defeat stating that he would be very excited to have Savoy stand under his banner for election to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the next provincial election, however Savoy did not offer as a candidate.

He supported Bob Rae&#x27;s bid for the Liberal leadership in 2006. </text><links>

<doc id="587111" wikidata="Q2828960" url="?curid=587111" title="Akbayan">
<text>The Akbayan Citizens&#x27; Action Party, better known as Akbayan (), is a democratic socialist and progressive political party in the Philippines. Akbayan is noted as a leading member of the progressive movement in the Philippines, having been formed in 1998 by a variety of progressive political organizations.

There are approximately 100 thousand members of Akbayan, with a pool of voter interest ranging anywhere between 150 thousand to 1 million people (at most 2.5% of Philippine active voters).

== History ==

Akbayan was formally founded in 1998 by different civil society organizations and various left-leaning organizations from the country&#x27;s social democratic, democratic socialist, and Marxist traditions with the intent of capturing state power through parliamentary struggle.

Akbayan has been critical of abuses committed by some members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) against fellow activists. It has also been critical of the Communist Party of the Philippines, particularly its actions in the countryside against peasant groups and communities and what these groups and communities see as the Maoist group&#x27;s extortion activities. Due to its stance against right-wing extremism (from some elements of the AFP) and the Maoist far-left (CPP–NPA–NDF), Akbayan has been a target of both political groups.
During the administration of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Akbayan was among the opposition groups repressed by the government. It was also during this time that Akbayan suffered its lowest number of votes, with just over 400,000 votes in 2007. In 2009, Akbayan supported the presidential candidacy of then Senator Benigno Simeon Aquino III. Fueled by the popular discontent with the outgoing administration of Macapagal-Arroyo, Aquino won the presidency by a large margin. This was also the first time that Akbayan was able to breach the 1 million vote mark, its best performance to that date. Despite the vote increase, however, it failed to secure three seats in the House of Representatives owing to a Supreme Court decision which ensured only the leading party list (Ako Bicol at that time) in the election would secure three seats.
Akbayan has been noted to oppose the increased incursions of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) naval and coast guard vessels into Philippine territorial waters and within the country&#x27;s 200-nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In 2016, the party allied itself with the Liberal Party and the Magdalo Group, supporting Mar Roxas and Leni Robredo&#x27;s campaigns and criticizing other candidates. After the election, it joined the Magnificent 7, a group of Liberal Party and Magdalo members. The party publicly criticized several policies of the Duterte government, including Duterte&#x27;s handling of the Philippine Drug War and the TRAIN Law.

Akbayan has affiliate groups that represent government employees, women workers, migrants, as well as members of the LGBT community. The party&#x27;s official website states that Akbayan is an activist organisation &quot;and proud of it&quot;, and that it &quot;vehemently condemn(s) torture, assassination, and other violent acts that undermine human rights and freedoms regardless of whoever commits them&quot;.

== Ideology ==

The party includes both democratic socialists and social democrats as members. While Akbayan&#x27;s political-economic platform rests on the democratic-socialist foundation which PDP–Laban ostensibly shares, the former differs greatly from the latter with regard to civil rights and law enforcement.

== Legislative record ==

== Electoral performance ==

=== Presidential and vice presidential ===
=== Legislative elections ===

==== Senate ====
In 2010, one of their representatives Risa Hontiveros ran for Senate as a member of Liberal Party, but Akbayan supported her. She only started to run as Akbayan in 2013, and on subsequent elections.

==== House of Representatives elections in districts ====
In 2013, Kaka Bag-ao ran for the Dinagat Islands seat under the Akbayan label and won; she ran under the Liberal Party label in subsequent elections.

==== Results ====
=== Party-list elections ===
Akbayan is only one of two parties (the other is Butil) to win seats in all party-list elections in the Philippines until 2019. Furthermore, Akbayan is the only party to surpass the 2% election threshold in all elections until the 2016 election where they fell short by 0.12%.

In September 2024, the COMELEC proclaimed it as a winner after the Supreme Court of the Philippines upheld the COMELEC Resolution which revoked the party-list&#x27;s registration of An Waray.
