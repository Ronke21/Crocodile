<text>Princess Amelia (7 August 1783 – 2 November 1810) was the fifteenth and last child and sixth daughter of King George III the United Kingdom and his wife, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. She was their third child to die before them.

==Early life==

Princess Amelia was born on 7 August 1783, at the Royal Lodge, Windsor, the youngest of 15 children born to King George III and Queen Charlotte as well as the only one born at Windsor Castle. It is often said that she was her father&#x27;s favourite; he affectionately called her &quot;Emily&quot;. She was born after the early deaths of her elder brothers Octavius (1779–1783) and Alfred (1780–1782). These deaths left a gap of almost six years between Amelia and her nearest surviving sibling, Princess Sophia. She was twenty-one years younger than her eldest sibling, George, and nearly seventeen years younger than her eldest sister, Charlotte.

Amelia was baptised at the Chapel Royal, St James&#x27;s Palace, by John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury, on 17 September 1783. Her godparents were her siblings George, Charlotte, and Augusta Sophia. She was the fifteenth sibling christened there. She was later confirmed by the Archbishop on 24 December 1799.

Coming so soon after the death of Prince Octavius and shortly before the end of the war between Great Britain and the United States, Amelia&#x27;s birth was felt to be a beginning of a new period of hope, and much was expected of her, even from birth. When Amelia was only a month old, Princess Charlotte wrote to her brother William, &quot;Our littlest sister is without exception one of the prettiest children I have ever seen&quot;. She was expected to be as beautiful, charming and winning as Octavius, her father&#x27;s previous favourite child, had been. As a result of her two brothers&#x27; deaths, Amelia was seen as her father&#x27;s favourite.

From an early age, Amelia was conscious of her rank. A popular tale relates that when the famous tragedian Sarah Siddons expressed a desire to kiss the beautiful baby, Amelia &quot;...instantly held her little hand out to be kissed, so early had she learnt the lessons of Royalty.&quot; When Amelia was three, Fanny Burney, the Queen&#x27;s Keeper of the Robes, commented that the princess could be &quot;decorous and dignified when called upon to act &quot;en princess&quot; to any strangers, as if conscious of her high rank, and the importance of condescendingly sustaining it.&quot; Burney even dubbed her &quot;the little idol&quot;. As the youngest of the thirteen surviving children, Amelia spent most of her time with her sisters Mary and Sophia, living in various royal residences. From the beginning, the three younger princesses did not receive as much parental attention as their elder sisters had, and spent a good deal of time away from the King and Queen, communicating with them mostly by letter.
It seems that the three youngest princesses were much wilder than their elder sisters, as evidenced by their behaviour when they sat for a portrait in 1785. In 1770, Johan Zoffany had been able to paint the King, the Queen, and their first six children with little difficulty. In 1785, however, John Singleton Copley had so much difficulty getting the dogs, birds, and especially the three royal children to sit still that he never painted another portrait. Compared to the carefully planned education that Charlotte, Augusta, and Elizabeth had been given, the education given to Mary, Sophia, and Amelia was based solely on what had come before. Amelia was only five years old when her father suffered his first bout of madness. As a consequence of her father&#x27;s declining health, she never experienced the closeness and affection that had characterized the family during her elder sisters&#x27; early years.

==Adulthood==
Prior to 1788, King George had told his daughters that he would take them to Hanover and find them suitable husbands despite misgivings he had, which stemmed from his sisters&#x27; own unhappy marriages. He remarked, &quot;I cannot deny that I have never wished to see any of them marry: I am happy in their company, and do not in the least want a separation.&quot; However, the King suffered his first bout of madness that year, when Amelia was aged five. Further lapses into insanity occurred in 1801 and 1804, thus forestalling talk of marriage for his daughters. The question of matrimony was rarely raised; Queen Charlotte feared that the subject, which had always discomfited the King, would push him back into insanity. Furthermore, the Queen, under strain due to her illness, wanted the princesses to remain close to her.

Amelia and her sisters, Charlotte, Augusta Sophia, Elizabeth, Mary and Sophia were over-protected and isolated, which restricted meeting eligible suitors of their own age.

===Illness and death===

In 1798, Princess Amelia developed a pain in the joint of her knee and was sent to the large seaside town of Worthing for recovery. She wrote to her father, &quot;Certainly the vapour and warm sea bath are of use and therefore I hope that I shall be able to assure you that I am better.&quot; The following year, Amelia temporarily recovered enough to join her family at Weymouth, where she doted upon her 3 year-old niece Princess Charlotte of Wales. Throughout her life, Amelia was often in poor health; at the age of fifteen, she started to suffer the early symptoms of what turned out to be tuberculosis.

In 1801, the princess was sent for a seaside cure at Weymouth to improve her health. Among those staying with her was the Hon. Charles FitzRoy, an equerry 21 years older than she, and the son of Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton. Amelia fell in love with the equerry, desiring to marry him. The Queen was told of the affair by a servant but turned a blind eye. It was hoped that such discretion would prevent the King from discovering the liaison, which may have risked sending him into one of the bouts of mental illness to which he was becoming increasingly prone. Though she never gave up hope of marrying him, Amelia knew she could not legally marry FitzRoy due to the provisions of the Royal Marriages Act passed by her father&#x27;s Parliament (at least until she reached the age of 25, after which she could receive permission by the assent of the Privy Council). She would later tell her brother Frederick that she considered herself to be married, taking the initials A. F. R. (Amelia FitzRoy).

In 1808, Amelia had a severe attack of measles and the depressing atmosphere at home with her mother in Windsor made her even more miserable. The anxious King George decided to send Amelia to Weymouth, accompanied by her sister Mary. Her health was improved only a little, but she found comfort in quietly resting. In 1809, she could occasionally take short walks in the garden. This improvement was temporary, and in August 1810 her sufferings grew sharper, while in October of that year she was seized with St. Anthony&#x27;s fire (erysipelas), which cut off all hope and confined her to her bed on the 25th. The king summoned his daughter&#x27;s physicians to him at seven o&#x27;clock every morning and three or four other times during the day, questioning them minutely as to her condition. She lingered a few days more, waited upon to the last by her favourite and devoted sister, Mary. Her death occurred at 12:00pm on 2 November, her brother Edward&#x27;s 43rd birthday.

The dying princess had a mourning ring made for the King, composed of a lock of her hair under crystal set round with diamonds. He purportedly burst into tears upon receiving it. Otherwise, her will dictated all her possessions be given to Charles FitzRoy. Amelia was buried in the Royal Vault in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor.

==Aftermath==

After Amelia&#x27;s death, George Villiers, the King&#x27;s bailiff, and younger brother of Thomas Villiers, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, attempted to blackmail the King and Queen with letters belonging to Amelia, after the disappearance of £280,000 in his control. Villiers was father of later diplomat and statesman George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon.

Her death is credited with contributing to the decline in her father&#x27;s health which resulted in his insanity and the subsequent invocation of the Regency Act 1811. According to his physician, Dr. Willis, the king would later cry &quot;in a wild, monotonous, delirious way, &#x27;Oh Emily [Princess Amelia], why won&#x27;t you save your father? I hate all the physicians...&quot; Another of King George&#x27;s delusions included the belief that a healthy Amelia was only staying in Hanover with a large family of her own, where she would &quot;never grow older and always be well.&quot;

Amelia has been described as a beautiful girl with ruby lips and auburn hair. Reportedly she was the &quot;most turbulent and tempestuous of all the Princesses&quot;. However, she is also said to have been amiable, spirited, unselfish and intelligent. These qualities led her sister-in-law Princess Caroline, who was known to despise her in-laws, to call Amelia the &quot;most amiable of the bunch&quot;. Amelia was a favourite of both the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Sussex, who called her a &quot;lovely creature&quot;. Amelia adored the former and once told him that she had always loved him better than her other brothers. He for his part loved her perhaps more than he did his other sisters (with the possible exception of Princess Mary) and was devastated when she died. So deeply affected was he by her death that after her funeral, he could never again sleep in a room that was not lit by several wax candles. He also burst into tears at the mention of her name more than three years after her demise.

==Arms==

As of 1789, as a daughter of the sovereign, Amelia had use of the arms of the kingdom, differenced by a &quot;label argent of three points, the centre point bearing a rose gules, the outer points each bearing a heart gules&quot;.

<doc id="604725" wikidata="Q886008" url="?curid=604725" title="Bluejacking">
<text>Bluejacking is the sending of unsolicited messages over Bluetooth to Bluetooth-enabled devices such as mobile phones, PDAs or laptop computers, sending a vCard which typically contains a message in the name field (i.e., for bluedating) to another Bluetooth-enabled device via the OBEX protocol. 

Bluetooth has a very limited range, usually around on mobile phones, but laptops can reach up to with powerful (Class 1) transmitters. 

==Origins==
Bluejacking was reportedly first carried out between 2001 and 2003 by a Malaysian IT consultant who used his phone to advertise Ericsson to a single Nokia 7650 phone owner in a Malaysian bank. He also invented the name, which he claims is an amalgam of Bluetooth and &quot;ajack&quot;, his username on Esato, a Sony Ericsson fan online forum. &quot;Jacking&quot; is, however, an extremely common shortening of &quot;hijack&#x27;, the act of taking over something. Ajack&#x27;s original posts are hard to find, but references to the exploit are common in 2003 posts.

Another user on the forum claims earlier discovery, reporting a near-identical story to that attributed to &quot;Ajack&quot;, except they describe bluejacking 44 Nokia 7650 phones instead of one, and the location is a garage, seemingly in Denmark, rather than a Malaysian Bank. Also, the message was an insult to Nokia owners rather than a Sony Ericsson advertisement.

==Usage==
Bluejacking is usually not very harmful, except that bluejacked people generally don&#x27;t know what has happened, and so may think that their phone is malfunctioning. Usually, a bluejacker will only send a text message, but with modern phones it&#x27;s possible to send images or sounds as well. Bluejacking has been used in guerrilla marketing campaigns to promote advergames. 

The actual message itself doesn&#x27;t deploy any malware to the software; rather, it is crafted to elicit a response from the user or add a new contact and can be seen as more of a prank than an attack. These messages can evoke either annoyance or amusement in the recipient. Users typically possess the ability to reject such messages, and this tactic is frequently employed in confined environments such as planes, trains, and buses. However, some forms of DoS Disruptions are still possible, even in modern devices, by sending unsolicited pairing requests in rapid succession; this becomes disruptive because most systems display a full screen notification for every connection request, interrupting every other activity, especially on less powerful devices.

Bluejacking is also confused with Bluesnarfing, which is the way in which mobile phones are illegally hacked via Bluetooth.

==Companies==
===BluejackQ===
BlueJackQ is a website dedicated to bluejacking. The website contains a few bluejacking stories taken from the site&#x27;s forum. The website also includes software that can be used for bluejacking and guides on how to bluejack which are slightly out of date but the basic principle still applies to most makes of phone. Its forum has 4,000 registered users and 93,050 posts. The website has been featured in many news articles.

The forums were opened on the November 13, 2003 and has been the center of BluejackQ from the start. It currently has 4 moderators and has 20 different sections available to members. The areas included information about BluejackQ, reviews of mobile phones, media players, PDAs and Miscellaneous devices, general bluejacking threads and an off-topic area. The BluejackQ podcast was first released as a test version on January 15, 2006, thus becoming the first bluejacking-related podcast. Podcasts 1, 2 and 3 featured three members of the forums. 

The forums seem to have been unused since 2020.

== Fictional reference in &quot;Person of Interest&quot; ==

The authentic bluejacking as described here is not the same exploit which was frequently depicted in the television series &quot;Person of Interest&quot;; that fictional exploit portrayed different and more invasive capabilities.

<doc id="604727" wikidata="Q8486" url="?curid=604727" title="Coffee">
<text>Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted, ground coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content, but decaffeinated coffee is also commercially available. There are also various coffee substitutes. Typically served hot, coffee has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.

Coffee production begins when the seeds from coffee cherries (the &quot;Coffea&quot; plant&#x27;s fruits) are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The &quot;beans&quot; are roasted and then ground into fine particles. Coffee is brewed from the ground roasted beans, which are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.

Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking. The coffee beans were procured by the Yemenis from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries, and cultivated in Yemen. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe.

The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are &quot;C. arabica&quot; and &quot;C. robusta&quot;. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. Green, unroasted coffee is traded as an agricultural commodity. The global coffee industry is massive and worth $495.50 billion as of 2023. In the same year, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world&#x27;s total, followed by Vietnam and Colombia. While coffee sales reach billions of dollars annually worldwide, coffee farmers disproportionately live in poverty. Critics of the coffee industry have also pointed to its negative impact on the environment and the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;coffee&quot; entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch , borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish (), borrowed in turn from the Arabic (). Medieval Arabic lexicons traditionally held that the etymology of meant &#x27;wine&#x27;, given its distinctly dark color, and was derived from the verb (), &#x27;to have no appetite&#x27;. The word most likely meant &#x27;the dark one&#x27;, referring to the brew or the bean; is not the name of the bean, which are known in Arabic as and in Cushitic languages as . Semitic languages have the root , &#x27;dark color&#x27;, which became a natural designation for the beverage. Its cognates include the Hebrew &#x27;dulling&#x27; and the Aramaic &quot;qahey&quot; (&#x27;give acrid taste to&#x27;). Although etymologists have connected it with a word meaning , it is also thought to be from the Kaffa region of Ethiopia.

The terms &quot;coffee pot&quot; and &quot;coffee break&quot; originated in 1705 and 1952, respectively.

== History ==

=== Legendary accounts ===

There are multiple anecdotal origin stories which lack evidence. In a commonly repeated legend, Kaldi, a 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd, first observed the coffee plant after seeing his flock energized by chewing on the plant. This legend does not appear before 1671, first being related by Antoine Faustus Nairon, a Maronite professor of Oriental languages and author of one of the first printed treatises devoted to coffee, (Rome, 1671), indicating the story is likely apocryphal. Another legend attributes the discovery of coffee to a Sheikh Omar. Starving after being exiled from Mokha (a port city in what is now Yemen), Omar found berries. After attempting to chew and roast them, Omar boiled them, which yielded a liquid that revitalized and sustained him.

=== Historical transmission ===
The earliest recorded reference to the coffee bean and its qualities appears in a treatise by Al-Razi, which describes the bean—referred to as “bunchum”—as “hot and dry and very good for the stomach&quot;. Medieval sources indicate that coffee was first introduced in the land of Saʿd ad-Din—the heartland of the Adal Sultanate, which encompassed Somali territories and adjoining areas of the Horn of Africa.

Credible evidence of coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a similar way to how it is prepared now. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their religious rituals. Accounts differ on the origin of the coffee plant before its appearance in Yemen. From Ethiopia, coffee could have been introduced to Yemen via trade across the Red Sea. One account credits Muhammad Ibn Sa&#x27;d for bringing the beverage to Aden from the African coast, other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to Arabia. 

16th-century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami notes in his writings that a beverage called developed from a tree in the Zeila region located in the Horn of Africa. Coffee was first exported from Ethiopia to Yemen by Somali merchants from Berbera and Zeila in modern-day Somaliland, which was procured from Harar and the Abyssinian interior. According to Captain Haines, who was the colonial administrator of Aden (1839–1854), Mokha historically imported up to two-thirds of its coffee from Berbera-based merchants before the coffee trade of Mokha was captured by British-controlled Aden in the 19th century. After that, much of the Ethiopian coffee was exported to Aden via Berbera.

By the 16th century, coffee had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa. The first coffee seeds were smuggled out of the Middle East by Sufi Baba Budan from Yemen to India during the time. Before then, all exported coffee was boiled or otherwise sterilized. Portraits of Baba Budan depict him as having smuggled seven coffee seeds by strapping them to his chest. The first plants from these smuggled seeds were planted in Mysore.
Coffee had spread to Italy by 1600 and then to the rest of Europe, Indonesia, and the Americas.

In 1583, Leonhard Rauwolf, a German physician, gave this description of coffee after returning from a ten-year trip to the Near East:
Thriving trade brought many goods, including coffee, from the Ottoman Empire to Venice. From there it was introduced to the rest of Europe. Coffee became more widely accepted after it was deemed a Christian beverage by Pope Clement VIII in 1600, despite appeals to ban the &quot;Muslim drink&quot;. The first European coffee house opened in Venice in 1647.

=== As a colonial import ===

The Dutch East India Company was the first to import coffee on a large scale. The Dutch later grew the crop in Java and Ceylon. The first exports of Indonesian coffee from Java to the Netherlands occurred in 1711.

Through the efforts of the British East India Company, coffee also became popular in England. In a diary entry of May 1637, John Evelyn recorded tasting the drink at Oxford in England, where it had been brought by a student of Balliol College from Crete named Nathaniel Conopios of Crete. Oxford&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Lane Coffee House, established in 1654, is still in existence today. Coffee was introduced in France in 1657 and in Austria and Poland after the 1683 Battle of Vienna, when coffee was captured from supplies of the defeated Turks.

When coffee reached North America during the Colonial period, it was initially not as successful as in Europe, as alcoholic beverages remained more popular. During the Revolutionary War, the demand for coffee increased so much that dealers had to hoard their scarce supplies and raise prices dramatically; this was also due to the reduced availability of tea from British merchants, and a general resolution among many Americans to avoid drinking tea following the 1773 Boston Tea Party.

During the 18th century, coffee consumption declined in Britain, giving way to tea drinking. Tea was simpler to make, and had become cheaper with the British conquest of India and the tea industry there. During the Age of Sail, seamen aboard ships of the British Royal Navy made substitute coffee by dissolving burnt bread in hot water.

The Frenchman Gabriel de Clieu took a coffee plant to the French territory of Martinique in the Caribbean in the 1720s, from which much of the world&#x27;s cultivated arabica coffee is descended. Coffee thrived in the climate and was conveyed across the Americas. Coffee was cultivated in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) from 1734, and by 1788 it supplied half the world&#x27;s coffee. The conditions that the enslaved people worked in on coffee plantations were a factor in the soon to follow Haitian Revolution. The coffee industry never fully recovered there.

=== Mass production ===
Meanwhile, coffee had been introduced to Brazil in 1727, although its cultivation did not gather momentum until independence in 1822. After this time, massive tracts of rainforest were cleared for coffee plantations, first in the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro and later São Paulo. Brazil went from having essentially no coffee exports in 1800 to being a significant regional producer in 1830, to being the largest producer in the world by 1852. In 1910–1920, Brazil exported around 70% of the world&#x27;s coffee, Colombia, Guatemala, and Venezuela exported 15%, and Old World production accounted for less than 5% of world exports.

Many countries in Central America took up cultivation in the latter half of the 19th century, and almost all were involved in the large-scale displacement and exploitation of the indigenous people. Harsh conditions led to many uprisings, coups, and bloody suppression of peasants. The notable exception was Costa Rica, where lack of ready labor prevented the formation of large farms. Smaller farms and more egalitarian conditions ameliorated unrest over the 19th and 20th centuries.

Rapid growth in coffee production in South America during the second half of the 19th century was matched by an increase in consumption in developed countries, though nowhere has this growth been as pronounced as in the United States, where a high rate of population growth was compounded by doubling of per capita consumption between 1860 and 1920. Though the United States was not the heaviest coffee-drinking nation at the time (Belgium, the Netherlands and Nordic countries all had comparable or higher levels of per capita consumption), due to its sheer size, it was already the largest consumer of coffee in the world by 1860, and, by 1920, around half of all coffee produced worldwide was consumed in the US.

Coffee has become a vital cash crop for many developing countries. Over one hundred million people in developing countries have become dependent on coffee as their primary source of income. It has become the primary export and economic backbone for African countries like Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, and Ethiopia, as well as many Central American countries.

== Biology ==
Several species of shrub of the genus &quot;Coffea&quot; produce the berries from which coffee is extracted. The two main species commercially cultivated are &quot;Coffea canephora&quot; (predominantly a form known as &#x27;robusta&#x27;) and &quot;C. arabica&quot;. &quot;C. arabica&quot;, the most highly regarded species, is native to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia and the Boma Plateau in southeastern Sudan and Mount Marsabit in northern Kenya. &quot;C. canephora&quot; is native to western and central Subsaharan Africa, from Guinea to Uganda and southern Sudan. Less popular species are &quot;C. liberica&quot;, &quot;C. stenophylla&quot;, &quot;C. mauritiana&quot;, and &quot;C. racemosa&quot;.

All coffee plants are classified in the large family Rubiaceae. They are evergreen shrubs or trees that may grow 5 m (15 ft) tall when unpruned. The leaves are dark green and glossy, usually 10–15 cm (4–6 in) long and 6 cm (2.4 in) wide, simple, entire, and opposite. Petioles of opposite leaves fuse at the base to form interpetiolar stipules, characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are axillary, and clusters of fragrant white flowers bloom simultaneously. Gynoecium consists of an inferior ovary, also characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are followed by oval berries of about 1.5 cm (0.6 in). When immature, they are green, and they ripen to yellow, then crimson, before turning black on drying. Each berry usually contains two seeds, but 5–10% of the berries have only one; these are called peaberries. Arabica berries ripen in six to eight months, while robusta takes nine to eleven months.

&quot;Coffea arabica&quot; is predominantly self-pollinating, and as a result, the seedlings are generally uniform and vary little from their parents. In contrast, &quot;Coffea canephora&quot;, and &quot;C. liberica&quot; are self-incompatible and require outcrossing. This means that useful forms and hybrids must be propagated vegetatively. Cuttings, grafting, and budding are the usual methods of vegetative propagation. On the other hand, there is great scope for experimentation in search of potential new strains.

== Cultivation and production ==

The traditional method of planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each hole at the beginning of the rainy season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds&#x27; potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more effective process of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside after six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers become familiar with its requirements. Coffee plants grow within a defined area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, termed the bean belt or coffee belt.

In 2020, the world production of green coffee beans was 175,647,000 60 kg bags, led by Brazil with 39% of the total, followed by Vietnam, Colombia, and Indonesia. Brazil is the largest coffee exporting nation, accounting for 15% of all world exports in 2019. As of 2021, no synthetic coffee products are publicly available but multiple bioeconomy companies have reportedly produced first batches that are highly similar on the molecular level and are close to commercialization.

=== Species variations ===
Of the two main species grown, arabica coffee (from &quot;C. arabica&quot;) is generally more highly regarded than robusta coffee (from &quot;C. canephora&quot;). Robusta coffee tends to be bitter and has less flavor but a better body than arabica. For these reasons, about three-quarters of coffee cultivated worldwide is &quot;C. arabica&quot;. Robusta strains also contain about 40–50% more caffeine than arabica. Consequently, this species is used as an inexpensive substitute for arabica in many commercial coffee blends. Good quality robusta beans are used in traditional Italian espresso blends to provide a full-bodied taste and a better foam head (known as &quot;crema&quot;).

Additionally, robusta is less susceptible to disease than arabica and can be cultivated in lower altitudes and warmer climates where arabica does not thrive. The robusta strain was first collected in 1890 from the Lomani River, a tributary of the Congo River, and was conveyed from the Congo Free State (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) to Brussels to Java around 1900. From Java, further breeding resulted in the establishment of robusta plantations in many countries. In particular, the spread of the devastating coffee leaf rust (caused by the fungal pathogen &quot;Hemileia vastatrix&quot;), to which arabica is vulnerable, hastened the uptake of the resistant robusta. The pathogen and results in light, rust-colored spots on the undersides of coffee plant leaves. It grows exclusively on the leaves of coffee plants. Coffee leaf rust is found in virtually all countries that produce coffee.

Beans from different countries or regions can usually be distinguished by differences in flavor, aroma, body, and acidity. These taste characteristics are dependent not only on the coffee&#x27;s growing region but also on genetic subspecies (varietals) and processing. Varietals are generally known by the region in which they are grown, such as Colombian, Java, and Kona. Arabica coffee beans are cultivated mainly in Latin America, eastern Africa or Asia, while robusta beans are grown in central Africa, southeast Asia, and Brazil.

Coffee can also be blended with medicinal or functional mushrooms, of which some of the most frequently used include lion&#x27;s mane, chaga, &quot;Cordyceps&quot;, and reishi. Mushroom coffee has about half the caffeine of standard coffee. However, drinking mushroom coffee can result in digestive issues and high amounts can result in liver toxicity. There is little clinical evidence for the benefits of mushroom coffee.

=== Pests and treatments ===

==== Fungi ====
Coffee wilt disease or tracheomycosis is a common vascular wilt found in Eastern and Central Africa that can kill coffee trees it infects. It is induced by the fungal pathogen &quot;Gibberella xylarioides&quot;. It can affect several &quot;Coffea&quot; species, and could potentially threaten production worldwide.

&quot;Mycena citricolor&quot;, American leaf spot, is a fungus that can affect the whole coffee plant. It grows on leaves, resulting in leaves with holes that often fall from the plant. It is a threat primarily in Latin America.

==== Animals ====
Over 900 species of insect have been recorded as pests of coffee crops worldwide. Of these, over a third are beetles, and over a quarter are bugs. Some 20 species of nematodes, 9 species of mites, and several snails and slugs also attack the crop. Birds and rodents sometimes eat coffee berries, but their impact is minor compared to invertebrates. In general, &quot;arabica&quot; is the more sensitive species to invertebrate predation overall. Each part of the coffee plant is assailed by different animals. Nematodes attack the roots, coffee borer beetles burrow into stems and woody material, and the foliage is attacked by over 100 species of larvae (caterpillars) of butterflies and moths.

Mass spraying of insecticides has often proven disastrous, as predators of the pests are more sensitive than the pests themselves. Instead, integrated pest management has developed, using techniques such as targeted treatment of pest outbreaks, and managing crop environment away from conditions favoring pests. Branches infested with scale are often cut and left on the ground, which causes scale parasites to not only attack the scale on the fallen branches but in the plant as well.

The 2-mm-long coffee borer beetle (&quot;Hypothenemus hampei&quot;) is the most damaging insect pest of the world&#x27;s coffee industry, destroying up to 50 percent or more of the coffee berries on plantations in most coffee-producing countries. The adult female beetle nibbles a single tiny hole in a coffee berry and lays 35 to 50 eggs. Inside, the offspring grow, mate, and then emerge from the commercially ruined berry to disperse, repeating the cycle. Pesticides are mostly ineffective because the beetle juveniles are protected inside the berry nurseries, but they are vulnerable to predation by birds when they emerge. When groves of trees are nearby, the American yellow warbler, rufous-capped warbler, and other insectivorous birds have been shown to reduce by 50 percent the number of coffee berry borers in Costa Rica coffee plantations.

=== Ecological effects ===


Originally, coffee was grown in the shade of trees that provided a habitat for many animals and insects. Remnant forest trees were used for this purpose, but many species have been planted as well. These include leguminous trees of the genera &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Albizia&quot;, &quot;Cassia&quot;, &quot;Erythrina&quot;, &quot;Gliricidia&quot;, &quot;Inga&quot;, and &quot;Leucaena&quot;, as well as the nitrogen-fixing non-legume sheoaks of the genus &quot;Casuarina&quot;, and the silky oak &quot;Grevillea robusta&quot;.

This method is commonly called &quot;shade-grown coffee&quot;. Starting in the 1970s, many farmers switched their production method to sun cultivation, in which coffee is grown in rows under full sun with little or no forest canopy. This causes berries to ripen more rapidly and bushes to produce higher yields, but requires the clearing of trees and increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, which damage the environment and cause health problems.

Unshaded coffee plants grown with fertilizer yield the most coffee, although unfertilized shaded crops generally yield more than unfertilized unshaded crops: the response to fertilizer is much greater in full sun. While traditional coffee production causes berries to ripen more slowly and produce lower yields, the quality of the coffee is allegedly superior. In addition, the traditional shaded method provides living space for many wildlife species. Proponents of shade cultivation say environmental problems such as deforestation, pesticide pollution, habitat destruction, and soil and water degradation are the side effects of the practices employed in sun cultivation.

The American Birding Association, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, National Arbor Day Foundation, and the Rainforest Alliance have led a campaign for &#x27;shade-grown&#x27; and organic coffees, which can be sustainably harvested. Shaded coffee cultivation systems show greater biodiversity than full-sun systems, and those more distant from continuous forest compare rather poorly to undisturbed native forest in terms of habitat value for some bird species.

Coffee production uses a large volume of water. On average it takes about of water to grow the coffee beans needed to produce one cup of coffee. Growing the plants needed to produce of roasted coffee in Africa, South America or Asia requires of water. As with many other forms of agriculture, often much of this is rainwater, much of which would otherwise run off into rivers or coastlines, while much water actually absorbed by the plants is transpired straight back into the local environment through the plants&#x27; leaves (especially for cooling effects); broad estimates aside, consequential margins vary considerably based on details of local geography and horticultural practice. Coffee is often grown in countries where there is a water shortage, such as Ethiopia.

Used coffee grounds may be used for composting or as a mulch. They are especially appreciated by worms and acid-loving plants such as blueberries. Climate change may significantly impact coffee yields during the 21st century, such as in Nicaragua and Ethiopia which could lose more than half of the farming land suitable for growing (Arabica) coffee. As of 2016, at least 34% of global coffee production was compliant with voluntary sustainability standards such as Fairtrade, UTZ, and 4C (The Common Code for the Coffee Community).

=== Preprocessing ===
Coffee berries are traditionally selectively picked by hand, which is labor-intensive as it involves the selection of only the berries at the peak of ripeness. More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two types of method—a dry process method which is often simpler and less labor-intensive, and a wet process method, which incorporates batch fermentation, uses larger amounts of water in the process, and often yields a milder coffee.

Then they are sorted by ripeness and color, and most often the flesh of the berry is removed, usually by machine, and the seeds are fermented to remove the slimy layer of mucilage still present on the seed. When the fermentation is finished, the seeds are washed with large quantities of fresh water to remove the fermentation residue, which generates massive amounts of coffee wastewater. Finally, the seeds are dried.

The best (but least used) method of drying coffee is using drying tables. In this method, the pulped and fermented coffee is spread thinly on raised beds, which allows the air to pass on all sides of the coffee, and then the coffee is mixed by hand. The drying that then takes place is more uniform, and fermentation is less likely. Most African coffee is dried in this manner and certain coffee farms around the world are starting to use this traditional method. Next, the coffee is sorted, and labeled as green coffee. Some companies use cylinders to pump in heated air to dry the coffee seeds, though this is generally in places where the humidity is very high.

An Asian coffee known as kopi luwak undergoes a peculiar process made from coffee berries eaten by the Asian palm civet, passing through its digestive tract, with the beans eventually harvested from feces. Coffee brewed from this process is among the most expensive in the world, with bean prices reaching $160 per pound or $30 per brewed cup. Kopi luwak coffee is said to have a uniquely rich, slightly smoky aroma and flavor with hints of chocolate, resulting from the action of digestive enzymes breaking down bean proteins to facilitate partial fermentation. In Thailand, black ivory coffee beans are fed to elephants whose digestive enzymes reduce the bitter taste of beans collected from dung. These beans sell for up to $1,100 a kilogram ($500 per lb), achieving the world&#x27;s most expensive coffee, three times costlier than palm civet coffee beans.

== Processing ==

=== Roasting ===
The next step in the process is the roasting of green coffee. Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions, such as infusions from green coffee beans, coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted. The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and the requirements for packaging.

The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the bean reaches approximately , though different varieties of seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates. During roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down starches, changing them to simple sugars that begin to brown, which darkens the color of the bean.

Sucrose is rapidly lost during the roasting process, and may disappear entirely in darker roasts. During roasting, aromatic oils and acids weaken, changing the flavor; at , other oils start to develop. One of these oils, caffeol, is created at about , and is largely responsible for coffee&#x27;s aroma and flavor. The difference of caffeine content between a light roast and a dark roast is only about 0.1%.

=== Grading roasted beans ===

Depending on the color of the roasted beans as perceived by the human eye, they will be labeled as light, medium light, medium, medium dark, dark, or very dark. A more accurate method of discerning the degree of roast involves measuring the reflected light from roasted seeds illuminated with a light source in the near-infrared spectrum. This elaborate light meter uses a process known as spectroscopy to return a number that consistently indicates the roasted coffee&#x27;s relative degree of roast or flavor development. Coffee has, in many countries, been graded by size longer than it has been graded by quality. Grading is generally done with sieves, numbered to indicate the size of the perforations.

=== Roast characteristics ===
The degree of roast affects coffee flavor and body. The color of coffee after brewing is also affected by the degree of roasting. Darker roasts are generally bolder because they have less fiber content and a more sugary flavor. Lighter roasts have a more complex and therefore perceived stronger flavor from aromatic oils and acids otherwise destroyed by longer roasting times. Roasting does not alter the amount of caffeine in the bean, but does give less caffeine when the beans are measured by volume because the beans expand during roasting. A small amount of chaff is produced during roasting from the skin left on the seed after processing. Chaff is usually removed from the seeds by air movement, though a small amount is added to dark roast coffees to soak up oils on the seeds.

=== Decaffeination ===
Decaffeination of coffee seeds is done while the seeds are still green. Many methods can remove caffeine from coffee, but all involve either soaking the green seeds in hot water (often called the &quot;Swiss water process&quot;) or steaming them, then using a solvent to dissolve caffeine-containing oils. Decaffeination is often done by processing companies, and the extracted caffeine is usually sold to the pharmaceutical industry.

=== Storage ===
Coffee is best stored in an airtight container made of ceramic, glass or non-reactive metal. Higher quality prepackaged coffee usually has a one-way valve that prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to release gases. Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved when it is stored away from moisture, heat, and light. The tendency of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means that it should be kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee in refrigerators is not recommended due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings that face the sun may heat the interior of a home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.

In 1931, a method of packing coffee in a sealed vacuum in cans was introduced. The roasted coffee was packed and then 99% of the air was removed, allowing the coffee to be stored indefinitely until the can was opened. Today this method is in mass use for coffee in a large part of the world.

=== Brewing ===


Coffee beans must be ground and brewed to create a beverage. The criteria for choosing a method include flavor and economy. Almost all methods of preparing coffee require that the beans be ground and then mixed with hot water long enough to allow the flavor to emerge but not so long as to draw out bitter compounds. The liquid can be consumed after the spent grounds are removed. Brewing considerations include the fineness of the grind, how the water is used to extract the flavor, the ratio of coffee grounds to water (the brew ratio), additional flavorings such as sugar, milk, and spices, and the technique to be used to separate spent grounds. Optimal coffee extraction occurs between . Ideal holding temperatures range from to as high as and the ideal serving temperature is .

Coffee beans may be ground with a burr grinder, which uses revolving elements to shear the seed; a blade grinder cuts the seeds with blades moving at high speed; and a mortar and pestle crush the seeds. For most brewing methods a burr grinder is deemed superior because the grind is more even and the grind size can be adjusted. The type of grind is often named after the brewing method for which it is generally used, Turkish grind being the finest, while coffee percolator or French press are the coarsest. The most common grinds are between these extremes: a medium grind is used in most home coffee-brewing machines.

Coffee may be brewed by several methods. It may be boiled, steeped, or pressurized. Brewing coffee by boiling was the earliest method, and Turkish coffee is an example of this method. It is prepared by grinding or pounding the seeds to a fine powder, then adding it to water and bringing it to a boil for no more than an instant in a pot called a &quot;cezve&quot; or, in Greek, a : (from Turkish ). This produces a strong coffee with a layer of foam on the surface and sediment (which is not meant for drinking) settling at the bottom of the cup.

Drip brewers and automatic coffeemakers brew coffee using gravity. In an automatic coffeemaker, hot water drips onto coffee grounds that are held in a paper, plastic, or perforated metal coffee filter, allowing the water to seep through the ground coffee while extracting its oils and essences. The liquid drips through the coffee and the filter into a carafe or pot, and the spent coffee grounds are retained in the filter.

In a coffee percolator, water is pulled under a pipe by gravity, which is then forced into a chamber above a filter by steam pressure created by boiling. The water then seeps through the grounds, and the process is repeated until terminated by removing from the heat, by an internal timer, or by a thermostat that turns off the heater when the entire pot reaches a certain temperature.

The espresso method forces hot pressurized water through finely-ground coffee. As a result of brewing under high pressure (typically 9 bar), the espresso beverage is more concentrated (as much as 10 to 15 times the quantity of coffee to water as gravity-brewing methods can produce) and has a more complex physical and chemical constitution. A well-prepared espresso has a reddish-brown foam called &quot;crema&quot; that floats on the surface. Other pressurized water methods include the moka pot and vacuum coffee maker. The AeroPress also works similarly, moving a column of water through a bed of coffee.

Cold brew coffee is made by steeping coarsely ground beans in cold water for several hours, then filtering them. This results in a brew lower in acidity than most hot-brewing methods.

== Serving ==


Once brewed, coffee may be served in a variety of ways. Drip-brewed, percolated, or French-pressed/cafetière coffee may be served as &quot;white coffee&quot; with a dairy product such as milk or cream, or dairy substitute, or as &quot;black coffee&quot; with no such addition. It may be sweetened with sugar or artificial sweetener. When served cold, it is called &quot;iced coffee&quot;.

Espresso-based coffee has a variety of possible presentations. In its most basic form, an espresso is served alone as a &quot;shot&quot; or &quot;short black&quot;, or with hot water added, when it is known as Caffè Americano. A long black is made by pouring a double espresso into an equal portion of water, retaining the crema, unlike Caffè Americano. Milk is added in various forms to an espresso: steamed milk makes a caffè latte, equal parts steamed milk and milk froth make a cappuccino, and a dollop of hot foamed milk on top creates a caffè macchiato. A flat white is prepared by adding steamed hot milk (microfoam) to two espresso shots. It has less milk than a latte, but both are varieties of coffee to which the milk can be added in such a way as to create a decorative surface pattern. Such effects are known as latte art.

Coffee is frequently served iced. Popular options include Frappés, Iced lattes, or stronger brewed coffee served with ice.

Coffee can also be incorporated with alcohol to produce a variety of beverages: it is combined with whiskey in Irish coffee, and it forms the base of alcoholic coffee liqueurs such as Kahlúa and Tia Maria. Some craft beers have coffee or coffee extracts added to the beer, although porter and stout beers may have a coffee-like taste solely due to roasted grains.

=== Instant coffee ===


Many products are sold for the convenience of consumers who do not want to prepare their coffee or who do not have access to coffeemaking equipment. Instant coffee is dried into soluble powder or freeze-dried into granules that can be quickly dissolved in hot water. A New Zealand invention and staple, instant coffee was originally invented in Invercargill in 1890, by food chemist David Strang. It rapidly gained in popularity in many countries in the post-war period, with Nescafé being the most popular product. Many consumers determined that the convenience of preparing a cup of instant coffee more than made up for a perceived inferior taste, although, since the late 1970s, instant coffee has been produced differently in such a way that is similar to the taste of freshly brewed coffee. Paralleling (and complementing) the rapid rise of instant coffee was the coffee vending machine invented in 1947 and widely distributed since the 1950s.

== Economics ==


Over 90 percent of coffee production takes place in developing countries—mainly South America—while consumption happens primarily in industrialized economies. There are 25 million small producers who rely on coffee for a living worldwide. In Brazil, where almost a third of the world&#x27;s coffee is produced, over five million people are employed in the cultivation and harvesting of over three billion coffee plants; it is a more labor-intensive culture than alternative cultures of the same regions, such as sugar cane or cattle, as its cultivation is not automated, requiring frequent human attention.

=== World production ===
In 2021, world production of green coffee beans was 9.9 million tonnes, led by Brazil with 30% of the total (table). Vietnam, Indonesia, and Colombia were other major producers.

Nearly 90 countries export coffee cherries, 60 of them developing countries, with coffee constituting the main export revenue for countries such as Burundi, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and formerly Haiti. The largest producer by far is Brazil (almost 30% of world production in 2015), followed by Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and Ethiopia.

Coffee production provides a living for about twenty-five million people, mainly small-scale producers, while imports, processing, and distribution provide a living for about one hundred to one hundred and ten million people.

=== Commodity market ===


Coffee is bought and sold as green coffee beans by roasters, investors, and price speculators as a tradable commodity in commodity markets and exchange-traded funds. Coffee futures contracts for Grade 3 washed arabicas are traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange under ticker symbol KC, with contract deliveries occurring every year in March, May, July, September, and December. Higher and lower grade arabica coffees are sold through other channels. Futures contracts for robusta coffee are traded on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange and, since 2007, on the New York Intercontinental Exchange.

Dating to the 1970s, coffee has been incorrectly described by many, including historian Mark Pendergrast, as the world&#x27;s &quot;second most legally traded commodity&quot;. Instead, &quot;coffee was the second most valuable commodity exported by developing countries,&quot; from 1970 to circa 2000. This fact was derived from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Commodity Yearbooks which show &quot;Third World&quot; commodity exports by value in the period 1970–1998 with crude oil in first place, coffee in second, followed by sugar, cotton, and others. Coffee continues to be an important commodity export for developing countries, but more recent figures are not readily available due to the shifting and politicized nature of the category &quot;developing country&quot;. Coffee is one of seven commodities included in the EU Regulation on Deforestation-free products (EUDR), which aims to guarantee that the products European Union (EU) citizens consume do not contribute to deforestation or forest degradation worldwide.

International Coffee Day, which is claimed to have originated in Japan in 1983 with an event organized by the All Japan Coffee Association, takes place on 29 September in several countries. There are numerous trade associations and lobbying and other organizations representing the coffee industry.

=== Consumption ===
Nordic countries are the highest coffee-consuming nations when measured per capita per year, with consumption in Finland as the world&#x27;s highest.

==== United States ====
An April 2024, National Coffee Association survey indicated that coffee consumption in the U.S. reached a 20-year high, with 67% of U.S. adults reporting drinking coffee in the past day. This is a significant increase compared to 2004 when fewer than half of U.S. adults reported coffee consumption in the past day. Drip coffee remains the most popular brewing method, but espresso-based beverages, particularly lattes, espresso shots, and cappuccinos, gained popularity.

=== Economic impacts ===

Market volatility, and thus increased returns, during 1830 encouraged Brazilian entrepreneurs to shift their attention from gold to coffee, a crop hitherto reserved for local consumption. Concurrent with this shift was the commissioning of vital infrastructures, including approximately of railroads between 1860 and 1885. The creation of these railways enabled the importation of workers, to meet the enormous need for labor. This development primarily affected the State of Rio de Janeiro, as well as the Southern States of Brazil, most notably São Paulo, due to its favorable climate, soils, and terrain.

Coffee production attracted immigrants in search of better economic opportunities in the early 1900s. Mainly, these were Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, German, and Japanese nationals. For instance, São Paulo received approximately 733,000 immigrants in the decade preceding 1900, whilst only receiving approximately 201,000 immigrants in the six years to 1890. The production yield of coffee increases. In 1880, São Paulo produced 1.2 million bags (25% of total production), in 1888 2.6 million (40%), and in 1902 8 million bags (60%). Coffee is then 63% of the country&#x27;s exports. The gains made by this trade allow sustained economic growth in the country.

The four years between planting a coffee and the first harvest extend seasonal variations in the price of coffee. The Brazilian Government is thus forced, to some extent, to keep strong price subsidies during production periods.

=== Fair trade ===

The concept of fair trade labeling, which guarantees coffee growers a negotiated preharvest price, began in the late 1980s with the Max Havelaar Foundation&#x27;s labeling program in the Netherlands. In 2004, 24,222 metric tons (of 7,050,000 produced worldwide) were fair trade; in 2005, 33,991 metric tons out of 6,685,000 were fair trade, an increase from 0.34% to 0.51%. A number of fair trade impact studies have shown that fair trade coffee produces a mixed impact on the communities that grow it. Many studies are skeptical about fair trade, reporting that it often worsens the bargaining power of those who are not part of it. The first fair-trade coffee was an effort to import Guatemalan coffee into Europe as &quot;Indio Solidarity Coffee&quot;.

Since the founding of organizations such as the European Fair Trade Association (1987), the production and consumption of fair trade coffee has grown as some local and national coffee chains started to offer fair trade alternatives. For example, in April 2000, after a year-long campaign by the human rights organization Global Exchange, Starbucks decided to carry fair-trade coffee in its stores. Since September 2009 all Starbucks Espresso beverages in UK and Ireland are made with Fairtrade and Shared Planet certified coffee.

A 2005 study done in Belgium concluded that consumers&#x27; buying behavior is not consistent with their positive attitude toward ethical products. On average 46% of European consumers claimed to be willing to pay substantially more for ethical products, including fair-trade products such as coffee. The study found that the majority of respondents were unwilling to pay the actual price premium of 27% for fair trade coffee.

=== Specialty coffee and new trading relationships ===
Specialty coffee has driven a desire for more traceable coffee, and as such businesses are offering coffees that may come from a single origin, or a single lot from a single farm. This can give rise to the roaster developing a relationship with the producer, to discuss and collaborate on coffee. The roaster may also choose to cut out the importers and exporters to directly trade with the producer, or they may &quot;fairly trade&quot;, where any third-parties involved in the transaction are thought to have added value, and there is a high level of transparency around the price, although often there is no certification to back it up. This process tends to only be done for high-quality products since keeping the coffee separate from other coffees adds costs, and so only coffee that roasters believe can command a higher price will be kept separate.

Some coffee is sold through internet auction – much of it is sold through a competition, with coffees passing through local and international jurors, and then the best coffees being selected to be bid on. Some estates known for high-quality coffee also sell their coffee through an online auction. This can lead to increased price transparency since the final price paid is usually published.

== Pharmacology ==


Brewed coffee from typical grounds has no essential nutrients in significant content. In espresso, however, likely due to its higher amount of suspended solids, there are significant contents of magnesium, the B vitamins, niacin and riboflavin, and 212 mg of caffeine per 100 grams of grounds.

One psychoactive chemical in coffee is caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist that is known for its stimulant effects. Coffee also contains the monoamine oxidase inhibitors β-carboline and harmane, which may contribute to its psychoactivity. In a healthy liver, caffeine is mostly broken down by hepatic enzymes. The excreted metabolites are mostly paraxanthines—theobromine and theophylline—and a small amount of unchanged caffeine. Therefore, the metabolism of caffeine depends on the state of this enzymatic system of the liver.

Coffee is also known for its laxative effects, inducing defecation in some people within minutes of consumption. The specific mechanism of action and chemical constituents responsible are still unknown, but caffeine is likely not responsible.

Coffee is known to have a significant amount of water-soluble dietary fiber compared to other commonly consumed beverages such as factory orange juice. The amount of dietary fiber ranges from 0.47-0.75 g per 100 mL of prepared coffee in a 2007 experiment testing on espresso, drip coffee, and freeze-dried coffee with the beverage made from freeze-dried containing the highest amount fiber. Given the popularity of coffee and the low amount of fiber consumed by the average person in many developed nations, coffee may majorly contribute to the daily dietary fiber consumption for many people. (For instance, in Spain the mean fiber consumption of 7 grams per day with a moderate coffee drinker having 3 cups per day points to coffee accounting for 10% of Spanish dietary fiber.) 

Polyphenols in coffee have been shown to affect free radicals in vitro, but there is no evidence that this effect occurs in humans. Polyphenol levels vary depending on how beans are roasted as well as for how long. As interpreted by the Linus Pauling Institute and the European Food Safety Authority, dietary polyphenols, such as those ingested by consuming coffee, have little or no direct antioxidant value following ingestion.

A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.

=== Caffeine content ===
Depending on the type of coffee and method of preparation, the caffeine content of a single serving can vary greatly. The caffeine content of a cup of coffee varies depending mainly on the brewing method, and also on the coffee variety. According to the USDA National Nutrient Database, a cup of &quot;coffee brewed from grounds&quot; contains 95 mg caffeine, whereas an espresso (25 mL) contains 53 mg. According to an article in the &quot;Journal of the American Dietetic Association&quot;, coffee has the following caffeine content, depending on how it is prepared:

Caffeine remains stable up to and completely decomposes around . Given that roasting temperatures do not exceed for long and rarely if ever reach , the caffeine content of a coffee is not likely changed much by the roasting process.

== Society and culture ==

Coffee is often consumed alongside (or instead of) breakfast by many at home or when eating out at diners or cafeterias. It is often served at the end of a formal meal, normally with a dessert, and at times with an after-dinner mint, especially when consumed at a restaurant or dinner party.

=== Coffeehouses ===
Widely known as coffeehouses or cafés, establishments serving prepared coffee or other hot beverages have existed for over five hundred years. The first coffeehouse in Constantinople was opened in 1475 by traders arriving from Damascus and Aleppo.

A contemporary term for a person who makes coffee beverages, often a coffeehouse employee, is a &quot;barista&quot;. The Specialty Coffee Association of Europe and the Specialty Coffee Association of America have been influential in setting standards and providing training.

=== Break ===
The coffee break in the United States and elsewhere is a short mid-morning rest period granted to employees. It originated in the late 19th century in Stoughton, Wisconsin, with the wives of Norwegian immigrants. The city celebrates this every year with the Stoughton Coffee Break Festival. In 1951, &quot;Time&quot; noted that &quot;[s]ince the war, the coffee break has been written into union contracts&quot;. The term subsequently became popular through a Pan-American Coffee Bureau ad campaign of 1952 which urged consumers, &quot;Give yourself a Coffee-Break – and Get What Coffee Gives to You.&quot; John B. Watson, a behavioral psychologist who worked with Maxwell House later in his career, helped to popularize coffee breaks within the American culture.

=== Prohibition and condemnation ===
Historically, several religious groups have prohibited or condemned the consumption of coffee. The permissibility of coffee was debated in the Islamic world during the early 16th century, variously being permitted or prohibited until it was ultimately accepted by the 1550s. Contention existed among Ashkenazi Jews as to whether coffee was acceptable for Passover until it was certified kosher in 1923. Some Christian groups, such as Mormons and Seventh-day Adventists, discourage the consumption of coffee. Some Rastafarians also generally avoid coffee.

Furthermore, coffee has been prohibited for political and economic reasons. King Charles II of England briefly outlawed coffeehouses to quell perceived rebellion. King Frederick the Great banned it in Prussia, concerned about the price of importing of coffee without production colonies. Sweden prohibited coffee in the 18th century for the same reasons. Coffee has seldom been prohibited based on its intoxicating effect.

=== Folklore and culture ===

There are many stories about coffee and its impact on people and society. The Oromo people would customarily plant a coffee tree on the graves of powerful sorcerers. They believed that the first coffee bush sprang up from the tears that the god of heaven shed over the corpse of a dead sorcerer. Johann Sebastian Bach was inspired to compose the humorous &quot;Coffee Cantata&quot;, about dependence on the beverage, which was controversial in the early 18th century.

In the United States, coffee is sometimes called a &quot;cup of Joe&quot;. The origin of this phrase is in dispute; a common story is that in World War I the US Secretary of the Navy Josephus &quot;Joe&quot; Daniels banned alcohol on navy ships which meant that the strongest drink available aboard the ship was black coffee. Sailors began referring to coffee as a &quot;cup of Joe&quot; in reference to Daniels. However, this story may be apocryphal since the first written account of it was in 1930, some 15 years later. Another explanation is that a formerly popular nickname for coffee, &quot;jamoke&quot;, from &quot;mocha java&quot;, was shortened to &quot;Joe&quot;. A third origin story is that since coffee is such a commonly consumed beverage, it is the drink of the average Joe.

<text>David John Duckham MBE (28 June 1946 – 9 January 2023) was an English rugby union player. He played 36 games for England (scoring 10 tries), in three tests on the 1971 British Lions tour to New Zealand and for Barbarians F.C. in their 1973 defeat of New Zealand.

==Early life and education==
Born in Coventry, Warwickshire on 28 June 1946, Duckham was educated at Coundon Infant and Junior School and King Henry VIII Grammar School,

==Rugby career==
===Early success===
Duckham played his entire club career for his hometown club, Coventry R.F.C. playing at both centre and wing from 1967 to 1979. He made his international debut for England against Ireland in 1969, and quickly established himself as one of England&#x27;s best centres. Duckham&#x27;s early career saw him form a notable centre partnership with John Spencer. His game was marked by pace, swerves, sidesteps and an ability to wrong-foot his opponents, although this came at a time when the English team were struggling, especially against rivals Wales.

===&quot;Dai Duckham&quot;===
Duckham is perhaps best remembered for his performances for the British and Irish Lions and Barbarians teams under the Welsh coach Carwyn James. James had admired Duckham&#x27;s abilities (despite playing in an era when England struggled for consistency and results) and selected him as a winger for the 1971 British Lions tour to New Zealand. Under James&#x27; tutelage, Duckham was given an attacking freedom that he had not experienced with England and this brought the best out of his remarkable talent. Duckham would score 11 tries in his 16 games on the tour, featuring in three tests. Duckham&#x27;s six tries in the match against West Coast-Buller set a record for a visiting player in a single match in New Zealand.

In 1973, Duckham was reunited with James and many of his teammates from the 1971 Lions tour, when he was named as the only English back in the Barbarians side to play the All Blacks at Cardiff Arms Park. In the match, Duckham&#x27;s counter-attacks broke the All Black&#x27;s defence, even wrong-footing a cameraman with one outrageous dummy. The match is remembered as a classic, with the Barbarians winning 23–11. Duckham&#x27;s transformation under James, together with his status as the lone Englishman in a backline dominated by Welsh players, would see him became a favourite among both Welsh players and supporters, with many regarding him as one of their own. This earned him the life long nickname &quot;Dai&quot; (an affectionate Welsh hypocorism of David). Duckham would even name his autobiography, &quot;Dai for England&quot;.

===Later career===
Duckham took his attacking form into the 1973 Five Nations Championship, scoring a brace of tries for England in the 14-6 win over France. Against Scotland, Duckham made a memorable solo run which England failed to finish, often remembered as &quot;the greatest try never scored at Twickenham stadium&quot;. Despite England&#x27;s poor results in the 1974 Five Nations Championship, Duckham continued to score some memorable tries for club and country, scoring the opening try in a rare win over Wales and touching down for Coventry RFC in the RFU Knockout Cup final against London Scottish RFC. Injury would prevent Duckham from taking part in the 1974 British Lions tour to South Africa, but he would continue to feature for England making his final appearance in 1976 against Scotland at Murrayfield.

==Later years==
Duckham was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1977 New Year Honours for services to rugby football. After retirement, Duckham worked for building societies and banks, and was director of marketing for Bloxham School. Duckham was also Honorary President of the rugby charity Wooden Spoon improving the lives of disadvantaged children and young people in Britain and Ireland.

Duckham died from a heart condition on 9 January 2023, at the age of 76.

<doc id="604745" wikidata="Q1424576" url="?curid=604745" title="Great Big Sea">
<text>Great Big Sea was a Canadian folk rock band from Newfoundland and Labrador, best known for performing energetic rock interpretations of traditional Newfoundland folk songs including sea shanties, which draw from the island&#x27;s 500-year Irish, Scottish, and Cornish heritage. The band was very successful in Canada, with eleven of their albums being certified Gold in the country, including four being certified Platinum and two achieving multi-platinum certifications. Between 1996 and 2016, Great Big Sea was the sixteenth best-selling Canadian artist in Canada and the sixth best-selling Canadian band in Canada.

While it has been confirmed that the band has officially retired, former members Alan Doyle and Séan McCann have continued performing in their own solo careers typically including music from Great Big Sea in their setlists.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The band played its first official concert on March 11, 1993, opening for The Irish Descendants at Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. The founding band members included Alan Doyle (vocals, guitar, bouzouki, mandolin), Séan McCann (vocals, bodhrán, guitar, tin whistle), Darrell Power (vocals, bass, guitar, bones), and Bob Hallett (vocals, fiddle, accordion, mandolin, concertina, bouzouki, whistles, bagpipes).

Power, McCann and Hallett had already been playing together in another band. In the winter of 1989, the band, a six-piece with guitar, bass, fiddle, accordion and mandolin played its first show at the Memorial University&#x27;s winter carnival talent show under the name &quot;Newfoundland Republican Army&quot; or NRA, and won first prize. The band&#x27;s only other appearance as NRA was later that winter at the university &quot;Grad House&quot;. The band then dropped the fiddler, accordion player and the name.

The band found its new name as original bassist Jeff Scott rented an apartment on Rankin Street, St. John&#x27;s, where the members first met and discussed the formation of the band. As a four-piece, the band first appeared as &quot;Rankin Street&quot; at a little pub in downtown St. John&#x27;s called &quot;The Rose and Thistle&quot;, playing for $100 and beer. They played through Sean McCann&#x27;s stereo system, as renting a PA would have cost more than the night&#x27;s earnings. Susan Hickey (guitar and vocals) left the band months later to attend school in Halifax and was replaced by Darrell Power. The band gained much popularity playing such local pubs as Bridget&#x27;s and Greensleeves. In 1991 Jeff Scott was replaced by Jackie St. Croix on bass. The band released one recording on cassette titled &quot;Rankin Street&quot;.

According to Doyle, Rankin Street owned a PA system and he owned a van, which made Great Big Sea &quot;a match made in heaven.&quot; They toured nearly constantly for the band&#x27;s first several years, sometimes traveling as many as 300 days a year.

In 1997, the band reached the top ten of the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; pop chart with &quot;When I&#x27;m Up (I Can&#x27;t Get Down)&quot;, a cover of a song by the British folk group Oysterband. They performed at the 1999 Stardust Picnic festival at Historic Fort York, Toronto.

The band won the &quot;Entertainer of the Year&quot; award at the East Coast Music Awards for every year between 1996 and 2000. In 2001, they decided not to submit their name for nomination in order to allow other bands to compete. They have also been nominated for several Juno Awards, including Group of the Year in 1998, 2005, 2009, and 2011.

===The 2000s===
Power retired from Great Big Sea in 2003 to spend more time with his family and friends. Supporting members of the band include Canadian freelance drummer Kris MacFarlane (2002) (drums, accordion, guitar, backing vocals) and Murray Foster (2003, formerly of the band Moxy Früvous) (bass, backing vocals).

In the 2000 Canadian Federal Election, controversy occurred when Stockwell Day and the Canadian Alliance used the band&#x27;s hit single, &quot;Ordinary Day&quot;, at a rally without their permission. The band noted that this was a copyright violation and ordered that Day cease using the song for campaigning purposes.

Great Big Sea&#x27;s first concert DVD and videos collection, the &quot;Great Big DVD&quot;, saw release in Canada and the United States in 2003 and Europe in 2004.

In late 2005, the band released its long-awaited &quot;traditional&quot; album, &quot;The Hard and the Easy&quot;, on which they recorded their favourite Newfoundland party songs. The title of the album comes from a line of the song &quot;Tickle Cove Pond&quot;, one of two songs on the album about a horse falling through ice.

Also in late 2005, Great Big Sea released its first podcast, with clips of the band bantering back and forth in the studio mixed with various songs by them and other artists. They have since released several podcasts.

On February 9, 2006, the band&#x27;s tour bus tipped on its side into a ditch on the Trans-Canada Highway about 80 kilometres east of Vancouver near Surrey. The bus went on its side (right side) right beside the commercial weigh scales. As traffic backed up as far as Chilliwack, British Columbia, RCMP started to re-route traffic through the weigh scales. Their driver suffered minor head injuries, but everyone in the band was unhurt. The band went on to continue their tour including their performance that evening at The Centre in Vancouver for Performing Arts.

On November 21, 2006, the band released their second concert DVD, &quot;Courage &amp; Patience &amp; Grit&quot;, recorded in Belleville, Ontario. It is also the second release by the band to be titled by a line from their 2005 song, &quot;Tickle Cove Pond&quot;.
===Later career===
On June 13, 2007, the band announced they would return to the studio with producer Hawksley Workman. On March 14, 2008, the band announced that the title of the new album would be &quot;Fortune&#x27;s Favour&quot;, borrowing a phrase from one of the songs on the album, &quot;England&quot;. Prior to the release, a few of the songs that were eventually included on the album were played at live concerts, including &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot;, &quot;Walk on the Moon&quot; &quot;The Rocks of Merasheen&quot;, &quot;Straight To Hell&quot;, and &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;. On April 17, 2008, the band&#x27;s website announced that the first single from &quot;Fortune&#x27;s Favour&quot; would be &quot;Walk on the Moon&quot;. People who pre-ordered the album from the band&#x27;s official website were also treated to exclusive digital downloads of the songs &quot;Belong (A Capella)&quot; and &quot;Gallow&#x27;s Pole&quot;. The album was officially released on June 24, 2008 across all of North America.

On February 23, 2010, band member Séan McCann released his debut solo album &quot;Lullabies for Bloodshot Eyes&quot; to pleasing critical success. The nine track collection was recorded over the course of several months earlier this year at GreatBigStudio in St. John&#x27;s.

On July 13, 2010, Great Big Sea released their new album &quot;Safe Upon the Shore&quot; in North America. Alan&#x27;s &quot;From the Road&quot; blog on the band&#x27;s website, originally confirmed its production in an April posting, speaking also of the album&#x27;s subsequent release in July. &quot;Nothing But A Song&quot; is the first single off the bands&#x27; ninth studio recording, with a subsequent tour kicking off at the end of the summer 2010.

The Canadian television series &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot; uses Great Big Sea&#x27;s &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; as its theme song.

Great Big Sea appeared on &quot;It&#x27;s Friday&quot;, a song by Dean Brody on his 2012 album &quot;Dirt&quot;.

Great Big Sea announced a &#x27;greatest hits&#x27; album titled &quot;XX&quot; in October 2012, accompanied by a 20th anniversary tour with 32 dates in 28 cities across the US and Canada which kicked off on March 5, 2013 in Los Angeles and finished in St. John&#x27;s on April 23, 2013.

===McCann&#x27;s departure===
In 2013, McCann announced that he would be leaving the band at the end of the &quot;XX&quot; tour, much to the dismay of his bandmates.

In an interview with Bob Mersereau for the CBC, McCann discussed his life changes. &quot;I stopped drinking two and a half years ago, I&#x27;ve decided to leave the band I&#x27;ve been in for 20 years. I&#x27;m 46 years old, and I&#x27;ve decided to make ...changes.&quot;

In 2020, McCann coauthored a memoir with his wife, Andrea Aragon, titled &quot;One Good Reason&quot; that discusses his early life, battle with addiction and how this affected his life in the band. In it, McCann says that struggling to maintain his new sobriety he told his bandmates in January 2013 that XX would be his last tour with the band, but the rest of the band and its management refused to announce this publicly. Finally, in November 2013 with XX almost over, McCann announced his departure himself in a tweet, feeling that the fans needed to know. While largely vilified by Great Big Sea fans with little said by the band or management to counter this view, McCann claims he was devastated by how Great Big Sea ended and wishes it could have gone differently.

===Retirement===
On November 5, 2015, Alan Doyle was quoted in an interview with Christopher Tessmer of the &quot;Regina Leader-Post&quot;, &quot;We’re all struggling to define what the status of Great Big Sea is right now. As most people know, at the end of 2013 — after our 20th Anniversary tour — Sean (McCann) quit and left the band. We spent a length of time — a year or so — to find an amicable way that Bob (Hallett) and I could continue without him. We couldn’t, so we came to the realization that we didn’t want to go on like that. We don’t want to fight for the spoils of it. For the lack of a better term, the band is now happily retired.&quot;

On February 27, 2017, Doyle was quoted in an interview with Jason Setnyk of the Cornwall Seeker, &quot;Of course (we’re still friends). Sean, Bob, Darrell, and myself still own the publishing. Sean doesn’t live in Newfoundland anymore. We don’t talk as much as we once did, but he seems to be doing really well and great, and good luck to him.&quot;

===Charity work===

Great Big Sea was a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism and worked with them on a radio PSA.

<doc id="604746" wikidata="Q2420296" url="?curid=604746" title="Marin Sorescu">
<text>Marin Sorescu (; 29 February 1936 – 8 December 1996) was a Romanian poet, playwright, and novelist.

His works were translated into more than 20 countries, and the total number of his books that were published abroad rises up to 60 books. He has also been known for his painting, and he opened many art exhibits in Romania and abroad. He occupied the position of Minister of Culture within the Nicolae Văcăroiu Cabinet, without being a member of any political party, after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 (from 25 November 1993 to 5 May 1995).

== Biography ==
Born to a family of farmworkers in Bulzești, Dolj County, Sorescu graduated from the primary school in his home village. After that he went to the Frații Buzești High School in Craiova, after which he was transferred to the Predeal Military School. His final education was at the University of Iași, where, in 1960, he graduated with a degree in modern languages. His first book, a collection of parodies in 1964 entitled &quot;Singur printre poeți&quot; (&quot;Alone Among Poets&quot;), was widely discussed. He himself called them &quot;sarcastic and awkward&quot;. Ten volumes of poetry and prose followed, having a very rapid ascension in the world of literary, as a poet, novelist, playwright, essayist. He grew so popular that his readings were held in football stadiums. In 1971, he was a resident of the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa.

On his poetry, Sorescu said, with characteristic irony: &quot;Just as I can&#x27;t give up smoking because I don&#x27;t smoke, I can&#x27;t give up writing because I have no talent.&quot; He often claimed a sense of alienation, saying &quot;the spoken word is a crossed frontier. By the act of saying something, I fail to say many other things.&quot; On censorship, he said, after his last, post-1989 Revolution volumes were delayed, &quot;we have won our freedom, so I mustn&#x27;t complain. O censors, where are you now?&quot;

Sorescu&#x27;s collection of &quot;Censored Poems&quot; comprised poems which could not be published until after the Nicolae Ceaușescu dictatorship; of these, the best known is &quot;House under surveillance&quot;.

&quot;Iona&quot;, the play written by Marin Sorescu and first published in 1968 is widely considered a true masterpiece. The biblical myth says the prophet &quot;Iona&quot; (Jonah) was swallowed by a whale. In his play, Sorescu takes the story further and imagines what happens to &quot;Iona&quot; while he was inside the whale. &quot;The most terrible part of the play is when Iona loses his echo&quot;, writes Sorescu in the foreword of this play. &quot;Iona was alone, but his echo was whole. He shouted: Io-na, and his echo answered: Io-na. Then, it remained just half of the echo. He shouted Io-na, but all he could hear was Io. Io, in some ancient language, means &quot;me&quot;&quot;. &quot;Iona&quot; was played to a full house in Bucharest in 1969, but the tragedy was quickly withdrawn, because its content was considered too controversial.

Ill with cirrhosis and hepatitis, he died from a heart attack at the in Bucharest, aged 60.

<doc id="604749" wikidata="Q1536018" url="?curid=604749" title="Morphosyntactic alignment">
<text>In linguistics, morphosyntactic alignment is the grammatical relationship between arguments—specifically, between the two arguments (in English, subject and object) of transitive verbs like &quot;the dog chased the cat&quot;, and the single argument of intransitive verbs like &quot;the cat ran away&quot;. English has a &quot;subject,&quot; which merges the more active argument of transitive verbs with the argument of intransitive verbs, leaving the &quot;object&quot; distinct; other languages may have different strategies, or, rarely, make no distinction at all. Distinctions may be made morphologically (through case and agreement), syntactically (through word order), or both.

==Terminology==
===Arguments===
====Dixon (1994)====
The following notations will be used to discuss the various types of alignment:
*S (from &quot;sole&quot;), the subject of an intransitive verb;
*A (from &quot;agent&quot;), the subject of a transitive verb;
*O (from &quot;object&quot;), the object of a transitive verb. Some authors use the label P (from &quot;patient&quot;) for O.

Note that while the labels S, A, O, and P originally stood for subject, agent, object, and patient, respectively, the concepts of S, A, and O/P are distinct both from the grammatical relations and thematic relations. In other words, an A or S need not be an agent or subject, and an O need not be a patient.

In a nominative–accusative system, S and A are grouped together, contrasting O. In an ergative–absolutive system, S and O are one group and contrast with A. The English language represents a typical nominative–accusative system (&quot;accusative&quot; for short). The name derived from the nominative and accusative cases. Basque is an ergative–absolutive system (or simply &quot;ergative&quot;). The name stemmed from the ergative and absolutive cases. S is said to align with either A (as in English) or O (as in Basque) when they take the same form.

====Bickel &amp; Nichols (2009)====
Listed below are argument roles used by Bickel and Nichols for the description of alignment types. Their taxonomy is based on semantic roles and valency (the number of arguments controlled by a predicate).
*S, the sole argument of a one-place predicate
*A, the more agent-like arguments of a two-place (A1) or three-place (A2) predicate
*O, the less agent-like argument of a two-place predicate
*G, the more goal-like argument of a three-place predicate
*T, the non-goal-like and non-agent-like argument of a three-place predicate

===Locus of marking===
The term locus refers to a location where the morphosyntactic marker reflecting the syntactic relations is situated. The markers may be located on the head of a phrase, a dependent, and both or none of them.

==Types of alignment==
# Nominative–accusative (or accusative) alignment treats the S argument of an intransitive verb like the A argument of transitive verbs, with the O argument distinct (S = A; O separate) (see nominative–accusative language). In a language with morphological case marking, an S and an A may both be unmarked or marked with the nominative case while the O is marked with an accusative case (or sometimes an oblique case used for dative or instrumental case roles also), as occurs with nominative &quot;-us&quot; and accusative &quot;-um&quot; in Latin: &quot;Julius venit&quot; &quot;Julius came&quot;; &quot;Julius Brutum vidit&quot; &quot;Julius saw Brutus&quot;. Languages with nominative–accusative alignment can detransitivize transitive verbs by demoting the A argument and promoting the O to be an S (thus taking nominative case marking); it is called the passive voice. Most of the world&#x27;s languages have accusative alignment. &lt;br&gt;An uncommon subtype is called marked nominative. In such languages, the subject of a verb is marked for nominative case, but the object is unmarked, as are citation forms and objects of prepositions. Such alignments are clearly documented only in northeastern Africa, particularly in the Cushitic languages, and the southwestern United States and adjacent parts of Mexico, in the Yuman languages.
# Ergative–absolutive (or ergative) alignment treats an intransitive argument like a transitive O argument (S = O; A separate) (see ergative–absolutive language). An A may be marked with an ergative case (or sometimes an oblique case used also for the genitive or instrumental case roles) while the S argument of an intransitive verb and the O argument of a transitive verb are left unmarked or sometimes marked with an absolutive case. Ergative–absolutive languages can detransitivize transitive verbs by demoting the O and promoting the A to an S, thus taking the absolutive case, called the antipassive voice. About a sixth of the world&#x27;s languages have ergative alignment. The best known are probably the Inuit languages and Basque.
# Active–stative alignment treats the arguments of intransitive verbs like the A argument of transitives (like English) in some cases and like transitive O arguments (like Inuit) in other cases (Sa=A; So=O). For example, in Georgian, &quot;Mariamma imğera&quot; &quot;Mary (-ma) sang&quot;, &quot;Mariam&quot; shares the same narrative case ending as in the transitive clause &quot;Mariamma c&#x27;erili dac&#x27;era&quot; &quot;Mary (-ma) wrote the letter (-i)&quot;, while in &quot;Mariami iq&#x27;o Tbilisši revolutsiamde&quot; &quot;Mary (-i) was in Tbilisi up to the revolution&quot;, &quot;Mariam&quot; shares the same case ending (-i) as the object of the transitive clause. Thus, the arguments of intransitive verbs are not uniform in its behaviour. &lt;br&gt;The reasons for treating intransitive arguments like A or like O usually have a semantic basis. The particular criteria vary from language to language and may be either fixed for each verb or chosen by the speaker according to the degree of volition, control, or suffering of the participant or to the degree of sympathy that the speaker has for the participant.
# Symmetrical voice, also called Austronesian alignment and Philippine-type alignment, is found in the Austronesian languages of the Philippines, parts of Borneo and Sulawesi, Taiwan, and Madagascar. These languages have both accusative-type and ergative-type alignments in transitive verbs. They are traditionally (and misleadingly) called &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; voice because the speaker can choose to use either one rather like active and passive voice in English. However, because they are not true voice, terms such as &quot;agent trigger&quot; or &quot;actor focus&quot; are increasingly used for the accusative type (S=A) and &quot;patient trigger&quot; or &quot;undergoer focus&quot; for the ergative type (S=O). (The terms with &quot;trigger&quot; may be preferred over those with &quot;focus&quot; because these are not focus systems either; morphological alignment has a long history of confused terminology). Patient-trigger alignment is the default in most of these languages. For either alignment, two core cases are used (unlike passive and antipassive voice, which have only one), but the same morphology is used for the &quot;nominative&quot; of the agent-trigger alignment and the &quot;absolutive&quot; of the patient-trigger alignment so there is a total of just three core cases: common S/A/O (usually called &quot;nominative,&quot; or less ambiguously &quot;direct&quot;), &quot;ergative&quot; A, and &quot;accusative&quot; O. Many of these languages have &quot;four&quot; alignments, with additional &quot;voices&quot; that mark a locative or benefactive with the direct case.
#Direct alignment: very few languages make no distinction among agent, patient, and intransitive arguments, leaving the hearer to rely entirely on context and common sense to figure them out. This S/A/O case is called &quot;direct&quot;, as it sometimes is in Austronesian alignment.
#Tripartite alignment uses a separate case or syntax for each argument, which are conventionally called the accusative case, the intransitive case, and the ergative case. The Nez Perce language is a notable example.
#Transitive alignment: certain Iranian languages, such as Rushani, distinguish only transitivity (in the past tense), using a &quot;transitive case&quot; for both A and O, and an &quot;intransitive case&quot; for S. That is sometimes called a &quot;double-oblique&quot; system, as the transitive case is equivalent to the accusative in the non-past tense.

The direct, tripartite, and transitive alignment types are all quite rare. The alignment types other than Austronesian alignment can be shown graphically like this:

In addition, in some languages, both nominative–accusative and ergative–absolutive systems may be used, split between different grammatical contexts, called split ergativity. The split may sometimes be linked to animacy, as in many Australian Aboriginal languages, or to aspect, as in Hindustani and Mayan languages. A few Australian languages, such as Diyari, are split among accusative, ergative, and tripartite alignment, depending on animacy.

A popular idea, introduced in Anderson (1976), is that some constructions universally favor accusative alignment while others are more flexible. In general, behavioral constructions (control, raising, relativization) are claimed to favor nominative–accusative alignment while coding constructions (especially case constructions) do not show any alignment preferences. This idea underlies early notions of ‘deep’ vs. ‘surface’ (or ‘syntactic’ vs. ‘morphological’) ergativity (e.g. Comrie 1978; Dixon 1994): many languages have surface ergativity only (ergative alignments only in their coding constructions, like case or agreement) but not in their behavioral constructions or at least not in all of them. Languages with deep ergativity (with ergative alignment in behavioral constructions) appear to be less common.

==Comparison between ergative-absolutive and nominative-accusative==
The arguments can be symbolized as follows:
* O = most patient-like argument of a transitive clause (also symbolized as P)
* S = sole argument of an intransitive clause
* A = most agent-like argument of a transitive clause

The S/A/O terminology avoids the use of terms like &quot;subject&quot; and &quot;object&quot;, which are not stable concepts from language to language. Moreover, it avoids the terms &quot;agent&quot; and &quot;patient&quot;, which are semantic roles that do not correspond consistently to particular arguments. For instance, the A might be an experiencer or a source, semantically, not just an agent.

The relationship between ergative and accusative systems can be schematically represented as the following:

The following Basque examples demonstrate ergative–absolutive case marking system:

In Basque, &quot;gizona&quot; is &quot;the man&quot; and &quot;mutila&quot; is &quot;the boy&quot;. In a sentence like &quot;mutila gizonak ikusi du&quot;, you know who is seeing whom because &quot;-k&quot; is added to the one doing the seeing. So the sentence means &quot;the man saw the boy&quot;. If you want to say &quot;the boy saw the man&quot;, add the &quot;-k&quot; instead to the word meaning &quot;the boy&quot;: &quot;mutilak gizona ikusi du&quot;.

With a verb like &quot;etorri&quot;, &quot;come&quot;, there&#x27;s no need to distinguish &quot;who is doing the coming&quot;, so no &quot;-k&quot; is added. &quot;The boy came&quot; is &quot;mutila etorri da&quot;.

Japanese – by contrast – marks nouns by following them with different particles which indicate their function in the sentence:

In this language, in the sentence &quot;the man saw the child&quot;, the one doing the seeing (&quot;man&quot;) may be marked with &quot;ga&quot;, which works like Basque &quot;-k&quot; (and the one who is being seen may be marked with &quot;o&quot;). However, in sentences like &quot;the child arrived&quot; &quot;ga&quot; can still be used even though the situation involves only a &quot;doer&quot; and not a &quot;done-to&quot;. This is unlike Basque, where &quot;-k&quot; is completely forbidden in such sentences.

<text>Omar Bakri Muhammad (; born Omar Bakri Fostock; 1958) is a Syrian Islamist militant leader born in Aleppo. He was instrumental in developing Hizb ut-Tahrir in the United Kingdom before leaving the group and heading to another Islamist organisation, Al-Muhajiroun, until its disbandment in 2004.

For several years, Bakri was one of the highest-profile Islamists based in London and was frequently quoted and interviewed in the UK media. In December 2004 he vowed that Muslims would give the West &quot;a 9/11, day after day after day&quot;, if Western governments did not change their policies. He has been described as &quot;closely linked to al-Qaeda&quot;—having released prepared statements from Osama bin Laden after the 1998 United States embassy bombings—but also as the &quot;Tottenham Ayatollah&quot;, &quot;little more than a loudmouth&quot;, and &quot;a figure of fun&quot;.

In 2005, following the 7 July 2005 London bombings, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that &quot;a dozen members&quot; of his group Al-Muhajiroun &quot;have taken part in suicide bombings or have become close to Al-Qaeda and its support network&quot;. Shortly after, Bakri left the UK, where he had sheltered for 20 years, for Lebanon. While there, he was informed by the Home Office that he would not be allowed back into the UK.

Lebanon&#x27;s state-run National News Agency said on 12 November 2010 that Bakri was among 54 people sentenced by a military court to life in prison with hard labour after being accused of acts of terrorism. After the decision, Bakri told reporters, he would &quot;not spend one day in prison&quot;, and said, &quot;I will not hand myself in to any court. I do not believe in the law in Britain as in Lebanon.&quot; On 14 November 2010, he was arrested by the Lebanese police and was transferred to Beirut. In October 2014, Bakri was sentenced to six years in prison with hard labour by a Lebanese court. He was released from prison on 29 March 2023.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Bakri was born into a wealthy family in the city of Aleppo, Syria, his father was Syrian, while his mother was Turkish. According to Jon Ronson, Bakri claimed that his family had &quot;chauffeurs and servants and palaces in Syria, Turkey and Lebanon&quot;.

From the age of five, he was enrolled in the al-Kutaab Islamic boarding schools (a primary school, known as a madrassa, that teaches children how to recite and keep Quran by heart) where he studied the Qur&#x27;anic Sciences, Hadith (the sayings of the Prophet of Islam and his Companions), Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence), and Seerah (The detailed biography of the Prophet of Islam), etc.

Bakri joined the Syrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood as a young man. He did not participate in their 1982 Hama revolt against the Syrian Ba&#x27;ath Party and the government of Hafez al-Assad.

In 1979, Bakri left Lebanon and moved to Cairo, Egypt, where he studied at Al-Azhar University for six months. He left Al-Azhar before he could get a degree due to disagreements with his teachers.

Throughout his life, Bakri said that he joined many Islamic movements including Muslim Students, Ebad ul-Rahman, al-Ikhwan (al-Tali&#x27;ah section), and Hizb ut Tahrir. According to an interview with &quot;Jamestown Special Correspondent&quot; Mahan Abedin, Omar Bakri joined Hizb-ut-Tahrir (HT) in Beirut and maintained contacts with it in Cairo, and started an HT cell in Saudi Arabia. 

Bakri said that he studied at the university of Umm al-Qura in Mecca and the Islamic University of Madinah. In 1984, the Saudi Arabian government arrested Bakri in Jeddah, but released him on bail.

===In United Kingdom===
Bakri moved to the United Kingdom on 14 January 1986. Later, he travelled to the United States to study English; he returned to the United Kingdom to assume the leadership of Hizb ut-Tahrir and become their spiritual leader. He defended the Muslim faith in public debates against Christian apologists, such as Jay Smith.

In the UK, Bakri worked for ten years helping to build up Hizb ut-Tahrir. According to ex-Hizb ut-Tahrir associate Maajid Nawaz, Bakri encouraged its members to engage in vigilantism against non-Muslims and Muslim women: &quot;We were encouraged by Omar Bakri to operate like street gangs and we did, prowling London, fighting Indian Sikhs in the west and African Christians in the east. We intimidated Muslim women until they wore the hijab and we thought we were invincible.&quot;

In 1996, Bakri split with Hizb ut-Tahrir over disagreements on policy, style and methods. He declared that Al-Muhajiroun was an independent organisation and continued as its Amir until 2003.

After the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, Bakri praised the attackers as &quot;magnificent.&quot; He began to support the theology and philosophy of Al Qaeda. Bakri said that he had become a Salafi Muslim. Media outlets and British Muslims criticised him for his open support for various international jihadist organisations. On 13 September 2001, Bakri told the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;When I first heard about [the September 11, 2001 attacks], there was some initial delight about such an attack. I received a phone call and said, &#x27;Oh, wow, the United States has come under attack.&#x27; It was exciting.&quot;

According to &quot;The Times&quot;, Bakri was left alone by British law prior to July 2005 despite actions such as an issuing a fatwa &quot;containing a death threat against President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan&quot; because:

Bakri, who acts as [al-Muhajiroun&#x27;s] spiritual leader, insisted that his followers obey a &quot;covenant of security&quot; which, while encouraging terror abroad, forbade them from carrying out attacks in Britain.

But &quot;the authorities may have been lulled into a false sense of security&quot;, because the covenant was not permanent. In November 2004 Bakri disbanded Al-Muhajiroun, saying that &quot;all Muslims should unite together against a hostile West&quot;. Three months later Bakri said this &quot;covenant of security&quot; was no longer in force, having been violated by the British government. &quot;Experts note&quot;, according to &quot;The Times,&quot; that the July London bombings followed &quot;four months later&quot;.

The same article reports &quot;&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; has identified more than a dozen members of ALM who have taken part in suicide bombings or have become close to Al-Qaeda and its support network&quot;, including Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan, &quot;a computer expert now in a Pakistani prison&quot;; Zeeshan Siddiqui, from Hounslow, west London; Bilal Mohammed from Birmingham; and Asif Hanif.

Bakri received an estimated £250,000 in state benefits since claiming asylum in Britain in 1986. Since he left the country in 2005, he has been banned from entering Britain.

====Students====
His main students were Khalid Kelly, Anjem Choudary, Sulayman Keeler, Abu Izzadeen and Abu Uzair, a trained civil engineer who leads or led the Savior Sect.

===Return to the Middle East===
On 6 August 2005, Bakri left the United Kingdom following stories that the UK Government were planning to investigate certain Muslim clerics under little-used treason laws. He was banned from returning by British Home Secretary Charles Clarke stating that Bakri&#x27;s presence in Britain was &quot;not conducive to the public good&quot;. He subsequently took up residence in Lebanon. During the 2006 Lebanon War, he tried to flee Lebanon on a Royal Navy vessel evacuating British citizens; he was turned away by the Royal Navy.

In 2005, Bakri made a televised appeal to the captors of Norman Kember, a hostage in Iraq. After his speech Bakri said, &quot;I appeal myself to them, you see, that to show guidance and mercy to any victim in their hand. But after that I can&#x27;t myself guarantee anything except to tell you these people mean business.&quot;

Bakri has reaffirmed the fatwa on Salman Rushdie, saying from Lebanon, &quot;Rushdie will continue living his life in hiding. Any fatwa will stand until it is fulfilled. He is always going to be worried about a Muslim reaching him.&quot;

During an online question-and-answer session, a Vigil member asked Bakri if Dublin Airport should be a terrorist target because U.S. troops transit there on the way to Iraq. Bakri told the member to &quot;hit the target and hit it very hard. That issue should be understood. Your situation there is quite difficult, therefore the answer lies in your question.&quot; He said the 7/7 London bombers were in &quot;paradise&quot;.

On 27 July 2007, a special edition of &quot;Newsnight&quot; entitled &#x27;Battle for Islam&#x27; was broadcast, in which Gavin Esler presented on the battle for the heart and soul of Islam. Omar Bakri featured live from Lebanon alongside Reza Aslan in Los Angeles, and Benazir Bhutto in the studio in London with Maryam Namazie. Currently Bakri reportedly heads the Atibaa&#x27; Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah movement.

===Family===
Bakri is, or was, married to Hanah and has seven children. According to ex-Hizb ut-Tahrir member Maajid Nawaz, Bakhri&#x27;s daughter, Yasmin Fostok, &quot;grew so disillusioned with her father&#x27;s rhetoric that in one monumental act of defiance she left home and became a stripper&quot;.

On 30 December 2015, his son, Bilal, was killed while fighting for ISIS in Iraq.

==Alleged ties to terrorism==
British newspapers have called him the &quot;Tottenham Ayatollah&quot;, despite him identifying as Salafi and the title &quot;ayatollah&quot; being a Shia epithet. Former Conservative MP Rupert Allason described him as a &quot;terrorist who believes in planting bombs and blowing up women and children in Israel&quot;. Roland Jacquard, a French expert on Islamic terrorism, said that &quot;every al-Qaeda operative recently arrested or identified in Europe had come into contact with Bakri at some time or other&quot;.

===Internet broadcasts===
In January 2005, &quot;The Times&quot; monitored live, 90-minute internet lectures from Bakri in a chatroom in which he told listeners, &quot;I believe the whole of Britain has become Dar al-Harb (land of war). The kuffar (non-believer) has no sanctity for their own life or property.&quot; He said Muslims should join the jihad &quot;wherever you are&quot; and told a woman she was allowed to do a suicide bombing. In another broadcast he said, &quot;Al-Qaeda and all its branches and organizations of the world, that is the victorious group and they have the emir and you are obliged to join. There is no need ... to mess about.&quot; Two days later, in another broadcast, he said that dead mujaheedin &quot;are calling you and shouting to you from far distant places: al jihad, al jihad. They say to you my dear Muslim brothers, &#x27;Where is your weapon, where is your weapon?&#x27; Come on to the jihad.&quot;

Andrew Dismore, a Labour MP, claimed that &quot;With these words he may well be committing offences under the Terrorism Act and other legislation. I will be raising this immediately with the Home Secretary and the Metropolitan Police.&quot;

====Comments on terrorist attacks====
Commenting on 11 September 2001 attacks, &quot;The Times&quot; claims he said on his website, &quot;I am very happy today. As much as I regret the innocent people who passed away, with the USA you must pay.&quot; The Montreal &quot;Gazette&quot; however claims that he said in an interview, &quot;If Islamists did it—and most likely it is Islamists, because of the nature of what happened—then they have fully misunderstood the teachings of Islam. ... Even the most radical of us have condemned this. I am always considered to be a radical in the Islamic world and even I condemn it.&quot; Bakri, discussing the 2004 Madrid train bombings, is alleged by &quot;The Times&quot; to have said, &quot;What happened in Madrid is all revenge. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, life for life.&quot;

===Financing of &quot;mujahideen&quot;===
On 24 October 2006 British security officials arrested Omar Bakri&#x27;s son, Abdul Rahman Fostok, at Heathrow Airport, and seized £13,000 that he intended to deliver to Bakri in Lebanon. The money was held under the Proceeds of Crime Act, pending an investigation, but Fostok was allowed to board his flight. Responding to this, Bakri said,

===Kidnapping plot===

On 31 January 2007 British police arrested nine suspected terrorists who were allegedly planning to kidnap, torture, and behead a British Muslim in the army, all of which would be videotaped and later broadcast on the internet. The soldier had served in the War in Afghanistan, but had returned home to Britain on temporary leave. On 4 February secret recordings of Bakri Muhammad emerged in which he calls for the attack. Bakri told listeners,

He previously called for a kidnapping-terrorist attack in 2005. In another incident he said he hoped someone would &quot;capture British Muslims who are in the Army over there&quot;. He has said that a Beslan-style attack is alright if children are not deliberately killed.

===&quot;Them: Adventures With Extremists&quot;===

British journalist Jon Ronson&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, a documentary (&quot;The Tottenham Ayatollah&quot;, directed by Saul Dibb) and book published in 2001, depicts Ronson and Dibb&#x27;s interactions with Bakri. Ronson depicts Bakri as a charismatic orator who tells a cheering crowd of 5000 that &quot;he will not rest&quot; until he sees &quot;the Black Flag of Islam flying over Downing Street&quot;, and calls for the stoning of fornicators and closing of pubs. He tells Ronson, &quot;I cannot take a day off, an hour off, even a minute off. I will take time off when I am with Allah, when I die in the battlefield and become a martyr.&quot; But he also describes Bakri as living in a semi-detached council house, enjoying watching a video of Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot;, being unable to hold a fish caught on a fishing line, and calling himself &quot;actually very nice&quot;.

In a phone call after the 9/11 attack on the evening of his arrest and release without charge, Ronson reports Bakri as telling him,

Ronson replied that he had never thought that.

===Arrests and conviction in Lebanon===
Future Television interviewed Bakri on 11 August 2005. Bakri said he did not have ties to Al Qaeda, calling it a &quot;media creation&quot; and said he did not intend to return to Britain. During the interview, Bakri said, &quot;I left Britain on my own accord though I have not been accused of anything there or in Lebanon ... but the London attacks are the reason I have returned&quot;. According to media reports, Lebanese police arrested Bakri as soon as he left the building after the interview. Police later said the arrest was &quot;a routine arrest to determine his reasons and if his residency in Lebanon is legitimate&quot;. Lebanese Information Minister Ghazi Aridi later said Bakri was arrested as a &quot;precautionary measure&quot;. British Ambassador to Lebanon James Watt said, &quot;We made no request for his arrest, nor for his extradition. As far as I am concerned, this is a very simple story – it is a Lebanese citizen who returned to Lebanon and has been arrested by the Lebanese police. We have nothing to do with it and it&#x27;s not in our place to comment on what has happened.&quot;

In mid-November 2010, Bakri was sentenced to life in prison in Lebanon in a terrorism case that he claimed to know nothing about, but was subsequently released on bail when witnesses who testified against him withdrew their testimony.

After his release he was reported to be living in Tripoli. In April 2014, his home was raided by Lebanese security forces because of his alleged involvement in fighting between the area&#x27;s Alawite community and local Sunnis. He fled the city and the Lebanese authorities announced he was wanted for &quot;endangering national security&quot;. In May 2014 he was arrested in the city of Aley and, in a press conference, the Lebanese Interior Minister, Nouhad Machnouk, alleged that Bakri &quot;has contributed in every aspect in supporting terrorism&quot;.

In October 2014, Bakri was sentenced to six years in prison with hard labour by a Lebanese court for founding a Lebanese affiliate of the Al-Qaeda linked Syrian terrorist group Al-Nusra Front, and of building a training camp for Nusra Front fighters in Lebanon. The following year, two of Bakri&#x27;s sons were killed fighting in the ranks of rival extremist group the Islamic State. The first, Muhammad, was killed in Aleppo, Syria, and the second, Bilal, in Salah al-Din province in Iraq in December 2015.

<text>Locrine is an Elizabethan play depicting the legendary Trojan founders of the nation of England and of Troynovant (London). The play presents a cluster of complex and unresolved problems for scholars of English Renaissance theatre.

==Date==
&quot;Locrine&quot; was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 20 July 1594 and published in 1595 in a quarto issued by printer Thomas Creede. Individual scholars have proposed dates for the play from the early 1580s on; many have favored a date c. 1591, based on the play&#x27;s links with other works of the era. It has been argued, for example, that &quot;Locrine&quot; borrows from the &quot;Complaints&quot; of Edmund Spenser, published in 1591, and from &quot;The Complaint of Elstred,&quot; a poem by Thomas Lodge, written c. 1591, that circulated in manuscript before its first printing in 1593. The question of the play&#x27;s date is complicated by the question of its authorship; if Charles Tilney was the play&#x27;s author (see below), it must date prior to Tilney&#x27;s death in 1586.

==Authorship==
The title page of the 1595 quarto advertised the play as &quot;Newly set foorth, overseene and corrected, / By W. S.&quot; An identification of &quot;W. S.&quot; with William Shakespeare apparently led to the play&#x27;s inclusion among the seven works that Philip Chetwinde added to the second impression of his Shakespeare Third Folio in 1664 – which in turn led to the inclusion of &quot;Locrine&quot; in the Shakespeare Apocrypha. The play&#x27;s stiff, formal verse is un-Shakespearean – but the extant text of &quot;Locrine&quot; does show evidence of revision. Some commentators have accepted the possibility that Shakespeare might have performed a revision – while others have rejected the idea. The authorship of the original play has been assigned to several dramatists of the era, with George Peele and Robert Greene being the two most common candidates. In 2020, authorship attribution specialist Darren Freebury-Jones provided the most exhaustive examination of the play&#x27;s linguistic and prosodic habits, concluding that Greene is the play&#x27;s most likely author. Freebury-Jones&#x27;s case was developed in a full-length monograph in 2022.

A manuscript note found in a copy of the 1595 quarto, and apparently by Sir George Buck, who was Master of the Revels under King James I from 1609 to 1622, states that his cousin, Charles Tilney, was the author:

(The note is trimmed along its right edge, obscuring some words.) Samuel A. Tannenbaum disputed the authenticity of the note, claiming it was a forgery, probably by John Payne Collier, but it has been demonstrated that the handwriting is genuine. If Charles Tilney wrote the play, it must date before his 1586 execution for participation in the Babington Plot. There is no evidence, however, that Charles Tilney did any dramatic writing, other than his alleged connection with &quot;Locrine.&quot;

==Sources and influences==
For the subject of his play, the author of &quot;Locrine&quot; drew upon a legendary pseudo-history of the founding of Britain. Just as Virgil, in the &quot;Aeneid,&quot; credited the founding of Ancient Rome to exiles from a defeated Troy, so later English writers such as William Caxton and Raphael Holinshed, adapting the medieval pseudo-history of the Welsh-Norman author Geoffrey of Monmouth, credited another band of Trojan exiles for the foundation of a British realm. It was this fanciful origin myth, applied to the English rather than the Brythons, that provided the foundation for &quot;Locrine&quot; (Locrinus in Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;). The author also drew material from the &quot;Mirror for Magistrates.&quot;

The revenge tragedies of Seneca were a major influence on &quot;Locrine.&quot; In addition to the poetry of Spenser and Lodge noted above, critics have pointed to links with the contemporary dramas of Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Kyd, Robert Greene and George Peele. Links with contemporary plays and playwrights can be, and have been, variously interpreted as evidence of influence or evidence of common authorship.

==&quot;Locrine&quot; and &quot;Selimus&quot;==
&quot;Locrine&quot; shares a complex inter-relationship with another anonymous play of its era, &quot;Selimus,&quot; first published in 1594. The commonalities between the two plays involve parallels of plot elements and shared verbal expression and prosodic structure. The majority of scholars who have considered the problem judge the author of &quot;Selimus&quot; to have borrowed from &quot;Locrine&quot; – though a minority has favored the opposite conclusion. The common features in the two plays have led some critics to suppose that they are the work of the same author; but since both plays are anonymous and their authorship is disputed, the connection between the two dramas obscures as much as it enlightens.

==Synopsis==
Following the Senecan model of revenge tragedy, each of the play&#x27;s five acts is preceded by a Prologue that features Atë, the ancient Greek goddess of folly and ruin. In each, Ate introduces and explicates a dumbshow; the play&#x27;s five dumbshows feature symbolic figures and animals, or personages of classical mythology. In the first, an archer kills a lion; the second shows Perseus and Andromeda, and the third, a snake stinging a crocodile. The fourth dumbshow features Hercules and Omphale; the final dumbshow depicts Medea&#x27;s murder of Jason and Glauce. Ate returns for a sixth and final appearance at the play&#x27;s conclusion.

The opening scene of the play proper shows the aged Brutus, the leader of the Trojans in Britain, before his courtiers, including his three sons, Locrine, Albanact and Camber. Brutus knows he is dying, and attempts to order the kingdom&#x27;s affairs; among other points, he decrees that Locrine marry Guendoline, the daughter of his loyal general Corineus. The scene ends with Brutus&#x27;s death. Locrine obeys his father&#x27;s behest and marries Guendoline.

Meanwhile, the invading Scythians arrive for their incursion into the British Isles, led by their king Humber, with his wife Estrild and their son Hubba. Subsequent scenes depict a back-and-forth combat between Trojans and Scythians. When his apparent victory turns to sudden defeat, the Trojan prince Albanact commits suicide; Albanact&#x27;s ghost appears through the remainder of the play, calling for revenge. The Trojans are eventually victorious. Estrild, the Scythian queen, is captured and brought to the Trojan court, where Locrine quickly falls in love with her. Corineus warns his royal son-in-law to remain faithful to Guendoline. Locrine does not follow this advice, though he sequesters Estrild in a subterranean hideaway for seven years. Once Corineus dies, Locrine brings his affair into the open; Guendoline&#x27;s brother Thrasimachus vows revenge.

The defeated Humber has been living in seclusion and grinding privation for seven years since his defeat; when he kills himself, the ghost of Albanact exults. Corineus&#x27;s ghost also appears to witness Locrine&#x27;s fate; defeated in battle by the forces of Guendoline and Thrasimachus, Locrine and Estrild commit suicide, and their daughter Sabren eventually drowns herself. Guendoline has her husband buried royally, next to his father, but consigns Estrild to an obscure grave.

The play&#x27;s comic relief is provided by a coterie of clown characters, Strumbo, Trompart, and Dorothy. Strumbo the cobbler marries Dorothy, but is impressed into the army along with his servant Trompart, to fight the Scythians. Strumbo survives battle by counterfeiting death:

:&quot;Trompart:&quot; Yet one word, good master.
:&quot;Strumbo:&quot; I will not speak, for I am dead, I tell thee.

Later Strumbo has an encounter with Humber, just before the latter&#x27;s suicide. Strumbo is prepared to feed the starving Humber, but is frightened away by Albanact&#x27;s ghost.

In 2020, the Beyond Shakespeare Company released online a play-reading and discussion of The Lamentable Tragedy of Locrine.

<doc id="604757" wikidata="Q7777206" url="?curid=604757" title="Thea Gilmore">
<text>Thea Eve Gilmore (born 25 November 1979), also known as Afterlight, is an English singer-songwriter. She has released more than twenty albums since her 1998 debut, &quot;Burning Dorothy&quot;. She has had three top 40 entries on the UK Albums Chart and one on the UK Singles Chart. Her first album as Afterlight was released on 15 October 2021.

==Early life==
Gilmore was born in Oxford to Irish parents and lived in the village of North Aston, Oxfordshire. She became interested in music as a result of her father&#x27;s record collection, which included work by Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and The Beatles. Later, she listened to Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, and The Replacements, among others. Having always written poetry and stories, she began seriously writing songs at the age of 15.

==Career==
Gilmore began her career working in a recording studio, where she met producer Nigel Stonier. She released her first album as a teenager, entitled &quot;Burning Dorothy&quot;, in 1998. Over the next four years, she released increasingly well-received albums that earned her a reputation in the UK music press but no chart success.

In 2002, Gilmore shared lead vocals with Kellie While, beside musicians Maartin Allcock, John Kirkpatrick, Robbie McIntosh, Michael McGoldrick and Simon Swarbrick in the Reel and Soul Association. The project mixed American soul and British folk music. The group&#x27;s eponymously titled album gained considerable mainstream attention which resulted in numerous TV appearances and radio broadcasts including the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot;.

Gilmore finally made a breakthrough at 23 with the release of &quot;Avalanche&quot; in August 2003, which became her first album to break into the Official UK Album Chart, at No. 62, and spawned two minor hit singles, &quot;Juliet (Keep That in Mind)&quot; and &quot;Mainstream&quot;, for which she garnered acclaim for producing a low-budget music video filmed in a local Virgin Megastore. The video received exposure on the BBC&#x27;s flagship music show &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot;.

In 2004, folk singer Joan Baez personally invited Gilmore to open for her during her tour leading up to the US presidential election. In 2005, Gilmore continued touring commitments, for the first time not releasing a new album (the covers collection &quot;Loft Music&quot; was widely released during 2004).

Gilmore returned to recording with the release of &quot;Harpo&#x27;s Ghost&quot; in August 2006, after a two-and-a-half-year absence of new material. This was her first album on major label Sanctuary Records after many years of independent releases. The album was once again acclaimed in the music press and UK radio lent their support to the single &quot;Cheap Tricks&quot;.

Subsequent to the release of &quot;Harpo&#x27;s Ghost&quot; she parted company with her manager, left Sanctuary Records and released an EP &quot;The Threads&quot; independently on her March 2007 UK tour, with remaining copies sold on her website afterwards.

On 19 May 2008, Fruitcake Records (via Fullfill and distributed by Universal Records) released &quot;Liejacker&quot;, Gilmore&#x27;s eighth album featuring contributions from Joan Baez, Dave McCabe, and Erin McKeown. It was preceded on 12 May by the single &quot;Old Soul&quot;, a duet with McCabe. In June 2008, Gilmore signed to Rykodisc (Warner) for the United States. &quot;Liejacker&quot; was released in the US on 23 September 2008.

Gilmore&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Recorded Delivery&quot;, was released on 25 May 2009, on Fullfill/Universal. The recordings are taken from UK shows during 2006 and 2008, with the first half of the album being acoustic and the second half electric, with a full band. In July 2009 she released a yearly subscription service / fan club, Angels in the Abattoir. Gilmore rounded out 2009 with the release of an album of Christmas- and winter-themed songs, &quot;Strange Communion&quot;, featuring eight originals penned by Gilmore and/or her then husband Nigel Stonier, as well as two cover versions – Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Listen, the Snow is Falling&quot; and Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;The St. Stephen&#x27;s Day Murders.&quot;

Beginning in October 2010, Gilmore and her band were engaged in a UK tour and had good reviews.

In January 2011, Gilmore appeared at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall in a tribute concert celebrating the 70th birthday of Bob Dylan. She performed versions of &quot;I Pity the Poor Immigrant&quot; and &quot;Masters of War.&quot; Subsequently, Gilmore entered the studio with producer and husband Stonier and recorded the entire set of tracks found on Dylan&#x27;s original release of &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;. The album – also titled &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; – was released 23 May 2011. 2011 saw the release of &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Singing&quot;, a collaboration with the estate of the Sandy Denny to set music to lyrics and other later writings of the legendary singer, who had died in 1978. The CD single &quot;London&quot; was released from the album in 2012 and was featured on the BBC coverage of the London 2012 Olympics montage of Team GB medal winners. The single was also released as an exclusive Record Store Day 7″ single.

In 2013, Gilmore released a new album of original material, &quot;Regardless&quot;, to critical acclaim and much exposure on BBC Radio 2. In May 2015 &quot;Ghosts And Graffiti&quot; was released, a retrospective with four new songs and six newly recorded versions of songs from her back catalogue. Gilmore released &quot;The Counterweight&quot; in June 2017 through Cooking Vinyl Records. &quot;Small World Turning&quot; followed in 2019. She also has been releasing music via the crowd-funding website Patreon, both new songs and rarities recorded earlier in her career.

In late 2021, Gilmore released two albums back to back: &quot;The Emancipation of Eva Grey&quot; and &quot;Afterlight&quot;. According to her website, the albums&#x27; &quot;songs share the same subject matter&quot;, with &quot;Emancipation&quot; being the last produced under the name &quot;Thea Gilmore&quot;, and &quot;Afterlight&quot; the first produced by the &quot;newly personified Afterlight&quot;.

==Personal life==
On 14 November 2006, Gilmore gave birth to her first child, a son, having conducted a UK tour in the autumn whilst heavily pregnant.

In July 2011, Gilmore gave birth to a second son.

<text>The Michipicoten River is a river in Algoma District of northern Ontario, Canada, which flows from Dog Lake and joins with the Magpie River to empty into Michipicoten Bay on Lake Superior near the town of Wawa. This river is in length (including Lochalsh River to the outlet of Wabatongushi Lake) and drains an area of about .

The river&#x27;s name derives from the Ojibwe &quot;Mishipikwadina,&quot; meaning &quot;big bluffs,&quot; and refers to the large hills located near the river&#x27;s mouth.

From the outlet of Dog Lake, the Michipicoten River flows south through a series of large lakes: Manitowik and Whitefish. Then it flows mostly west to Lake Superior. There are four hydroelectric generating stations on this last section of the river (operated by Brookfield Power Inc.), and at its mouth is the Michipicoten Provincial Park that was the site of a trading post.

==History==

A number of prehistoric sites on the Michipicoten River, as well as in the surrounding valley, have been identified by archaeologists. Of these remains, the most extensive are from the Late Woodland period, though some go as far back as the Archaic period. Artifacts, such as ceramics, have been linked to the Blackduck and Laurel traditions. The most prominent sites cluster around the mouth of the river or are within several miles upriver from the mouth.

The French explorer and cartographer Samuel de Champlain included the Michipicoten River in a map of North America as early as 1632. Later, in the days of the fur trade, this river provided access to James Bay by way of the Missinaibi and Moose rivers. Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers are believed to be the first non-natives to travel this route. A French fur trading post was built at the river&#x27;s mouth in the early 18th century, at a site sometimes called &quot;Fort Michipicoten&quot;. Later, after the British triumph in the French and Indian War, the post was abandoned. It was eventually reopened later in the 18th century under the British, and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and North West Company both opened competing trading posts at the river mouth, with the former building trading posts along the river&#x27;s route in the 1770s. In 1781, Philip Turnor, the HBC&#x27;s first full-time surveyor, performed a detailed survey of the river, followed by many upgrades to the portages. The two companies merged in 1821, and the Moose/Missinaibi/Michipicoten route became the established supply route for HBC&#x27;s Lake Superior District, orienting the fur trade up to Hudson Bay rather than Montreal.

In the 1880s, during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), construction materials were landed at the mouth of the river, as well as at Michipicoten Harbour. The materials were then moved upriver mostly on land, though partially using steamboats on Wawa Lake and Lake Manitowick. The routing of the Canadian Pacific mainline (the nearby section of which is the CP White River Subdivision) was oriented to parallel the Great Lakes system and ran orthogonal to the river, but fell well inland and diminished the importance of the Michipicoten River trading post, while stimulating business elsewhere, for example at Missanabie. Settlements around the river, such as Wawa, became boom towns due to a short-lived gold rush in the area around the turn of the 20th century. The end of the gold rush meant that some plans, such as the one to develop a &quot;Michipicoten City&quot; in the area of the old trading post, failed to transform the area, and the trading post was finally abandoned in 1904. Its site is now part of Michipicoten Provincial Park. 

The river once flowed over a succession of cascades known as Michipicoten High Falls. In 1904, construction began on a dam and hydroelectric power plant, intended to provide power to mines in the area such as the Helen Mine. The dam was completed in 1907, destroying the falls with the filling of a lake reservoir behind it. The power plant was later upgraded in 1926 in anticipation of a revived gold mining industry. This second gold mining boom drew population and development toward the new gold mining towns, which were referred to collectively as Gold Park, and away from existing riverside settlements.

<text>Whakaata Māori is a New Zealand television channel that broadcasts programmes that make a significant contribution to the revitalisation of the Māori language and culture. Funded by the New Zealand Government, it commenced broadcasting as Māori Television on 28 March 2004 from its studios in Newmarket, Auckland. It has since moved to East Tamaki, Auckland.

==Name==
The name Whakaata Māori has been official since 2022, but has been used as a &quot;de facto&quot; Māori name for the channel since its inception. Until 2022, Māori Television, the English name, was the &quot;de jure&quot; official name of the channel.

The word &quot;Whakaata&quot; means &quot;to mirror&quot;, &quot;to reflect&quot; and &quot;to display&quot;. &quot;Whakaata&quot; is also used as part of the compound &quot;pouata whakaata&quot;, which literally means &quot;display box&quot;, in turn, &quot;television&quot;.

==History==
===Early developments and prelaunch===
In the early days of television in New Zealand, Māori-language programming was scarce. Suggestions were made as far back as 1976 by the New Zealand Māori Council to create a Māori and Polynesian current affairs programme, followed by a second petition in 1978 to create a Māori production unit within the BCNZ, with the aim of adding &quot;a Māori dimension to regular viewing&quot;. There was significant process in the decade, such as the 1974 documentary series &quot;Tangata Whenua&quot;. In 1980, the newly created Television New Zealand started a Māori production unit, its first production being the current affairs magazine &quot;Koha&quot;, followed in Māori Language Week 1982 by a four-minute bulletin which eventually became &quot;Te Karere&quot; the following year.

While TVNZ&#x27;s &quot;Koha&quot; and &quot;Te Karere&quot; were showing signs of progress, there was heavy hostility at the time. Pākehā staff at TVNZ believed that Māori programmes &quot;were of high nuisance value and minimal importance&quot;, as well as fears of a takeover by Māoris.

In the mid-1980s, there were projects for a dedicated Māori television channel. When the Māori Council, in 1985, after the 1984 neoliberal reforms that facilitated the creation of a third national network, made a pitch for a service named Aotearoa Broadcasting Systems, both the government and the BCNZ rejected ABS&#x27;s proposal, losing the opportunity for a national Māori television service.

By the early 90s, iwi radio stations emerged as well as a dedicated funding agency, Te Reo Whakapuaki Irirangi, which in 1993 was renamed Te Māngai Pāho and spun-off from New Zealand On Air in 1995. In 1996, a joint Māori-Crown Working Group on Broadcasting Policy was set up, and in the same year, the Aotearoa Television Network launched as a pilot service in the Auckland area for thirteen weeks. ATN was plagued by lack of planning and government funding, which ultimately led to its closure, as well as hostile media coverage.

The Māori Broadcasting Advisory Committee was set up in 2000 by Derek Fox with the aim of creating a television network where the Māori language would become commonplace in prime time slots. The Fifth Labour Government particularly the Minister of Māori Affairs Parekura Horomia had supported the idea of a fully-fledged Māori television station following the 1999 New Zealand general election. An establishment trust called Te Awhioraki Trust led by Fox was also set up. In the period ahead of its launch, controversies emerged, such as the sacking of Canadian CEO John Davy, the first CEO of the channel, fired after six weeks due to false qualifications, as well as concerns that the new service was a &quot;waste of taxpayers&#x27; money&quot; and was destined to be a failure.

As early as 2002, independent production companies were beginning mass production of programmes for the new service, which were funded by Te Māngai Pāho. The channel would broadcast on average for eight hours a day, and by year-end 2004, would have acquired 2,020 hours of programmes, of which 1,122 were homemade. 60 to 70 percent of the output was going to be in Māori.

The Māori Television Service Act 2003 (Te Aratuku Whakaata Irirangi Māori) was passed in May 2003, establishing MTS as a statutory corporation.

===Launch and Newmarket era===

Test broadcasts started on 1 March 2004 on UHF frequencies previously used by Sky to relay CNN International. The decision was taken in January as CNN was not a priority for the UHF service of 100,000 subscribers, of which only 1.5% of subscribers regularly watched the channel. In addition, the channel was to be carried on channel 33 of its digital satellite service. At the time, construction and refit of its Newmarket facilities were nearing completion.

Māori Television was launched on 28 March 2004 with a special dawn ceremony attended by 2000 people at the Newmarket headquarters of the channel. The newly launched channel attracted 300,000 viewers in its second month of operation. The main channel attracts 1.5 million viewers each month, including half of all Māori aged five or more, and one-third of all New Zealanders. Te Reo, a second channel from Māori Television, was launched on 28 March 2008. In contrast with the main channel, it is ad-free and completely in the Māori language (without subtitles). Te Reo features special tribal programming with a particular focus on new programming for the fluent members of its audience.

In March 2013, Māori TV switched over from analogue television to digital television as part of a nationwide transition to digital television broadcasting between September 2012 and November 2013.

===Relocation===
In 2021, Māori TV launched a news service called Te Ao Māori News and a streaming app called MĀORI+ to extend their audience and make their content more accessible to viewers.

===Rename to Whakaata Māori and 2024 restructuring===

On 23 May 2022, the channel announced that it was going to change its official name to Whakaata Māori, the name being used in the Māori since the channel&#x27;s inception, but until then not at an official scale. The new name took effect on June 9 with a special dawn ceremony.

Whakaata Māori celebrated its 20th anniversary on 28 March 2024. During its 20th anniversary celebration, Whakaata Māori kaihautū (leader) Shane Taurima reiterated the station&#x27;s commitment to providing an &quot;unabashed&quot; Māori voice in the New Zealand media landscape. While acknowledging budgetary difficulties facing the channel, Taurima stated that the Whakaata Māori had built a &quot;dedicated audience&quot; and was shifting to become a &quot;digital-first&quot; audience in order to engage with social media users.

In March 2024, Whakaata Māori (formerly Māori Television) became the latest media group to sign a commercial deal with Google. The deal meant the channel would receive money to curate Te Ao Māori stories to be published on Google&#x27;s News Showcase platform.

In late September 2024, Whakaata Māori proposed a major internal restructure including axing its daily news television bulletin due to a projected NZ$10 million funding reduction by 2027. Kaihautū Shane Taurima also announced plans to shift Te Ao Māori News from a linear television to a digital format.

On 5 December 2024, Whakaata Māori confirmed plans to cut 27 roles, move its Te Reo channel from terrestrial TV to online, and end its 20-year news programme from 13 December to focus on its digital news website Te Ao Māori News. These cutbacks and restructuring were in response to financial shortfalls in recent years.

==Operations==
The channel operates under the stewardship of the New Zealand government, and the Māori Television Electoral College (Te Putahi Paoho). As of 2021 it had a budget of NZ$19.24 million.

In July 2015, Māori Television&#x27;s seven-member board of directors decided that Hamilton or Rotorua could be a new home for the broadcaster.

Since 2021, the channel has a news app called Te Ao Māori News and a video streaming platform called MĀORI+. By late March 2024, Shane Taurima said that the MĀORI+ app had 144,000 viewers daily.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated Whakaata Maori to be &quot;Independent State Funded Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

===Ratings===
A survey in 2009 by Business and Economic Research Limited found that 84% of the general New Zealand population think Māori Television should be a permanent part of New Zealand broadcasting.

Whakaata Māori continues to attract an increasingly broad audience across ages, genders and ethnicities. More than two-thirds of its audience are non-Māori. They are drawn by the channel&#x27;s local programming, such as &quot;Kai Time on the Road&quot;, &quot;Kete Aronui&quot; and &quot;Ask Your Auntie;&quot; New Zealand movies and documentaries; and the diverse range of international features not seen on other NZ networks.

==Mission==
The channel aims to revitalise Māori language and culture through its programming. The relevant legislation says &quot;The principal function of the Service is to promote te reo Māori me nga tikanga Māori (Māori language and culture) through the provision of a high quality, cost-effective Māori television service, in both Māori and English, that informs, educates, and entertains a broad viewing audience, and, in doing so, enriches New Zealand&#x27;s society, culture, and heritage&quot;.

==Controversies==
Canadian John Davy was appointed chief executive of Māori Television in 2002. However, it was found that his qualifications were false — he claimed to hold a degree from &quot;Denver State University&quot; which did not exist — and he was fired. In 2005, newsreader Julian Wilcox was fired (and reinstated) after he contributed to information provided to other media that led to negative coverage of the channel. That same year, &quot;Te Kāea&quot; presenter Ngarimu Daniels was banned from taking part in protests, and her partner was referred to as a &quot;dyke&quot; by a senior channel manager. She was awarded $16,000 compensation, and her partner, Leonie Pihama, a leading Māori academic and film-maker, resigned from the channel&#x27;s board, citing a conflict of interest.

In 2015, the channel&#x27;s star broadcaster, Mihingarangi Forbes, resigned after complaints arose that senior management (including CEO Paora Maxwell) were attempting to shut down a story critical of the Kohanga Reo National Trust Board to be broadcast on her show &quot;Native Affairs&quot;. An external consultant recommended to the channel&#x27;s board that reporting &quot;not challenge and critique one another&quot;, leading some (including commentator Morgan Godfery) to question whether journalists at Māori Television had the necessary freedom to report on the failures of elders in Māoridom. &quot;Native Affairs&quot; and other current affairs programming was later cut back or cancelled altogether, a decision criticised by Green MP Marama Davidson.

In 2019, the channel offered candidates for the 2019 Auckland mayoral election the opportunity to pay $500 to be interviewed and to have that interview broadcast on its TV and digital platforms, an offer one candidate described as close to &quot;extortion&quot;.

<doc id="604771" wikidata="Q862156" url="?curid=604771" title="Ergative–absolutive alignment">
<text>In linguistic typology, ergative–absolutive alignment is a type of morphosyntactic alignment in which the single argument (&quot;subject&quot;) of an intransitive verb behaves like the object of a transitive verb, and differently from the agent (&quot;subject&quot;) of a transitive verb. Examples include Basque, Georgian, Mayan, Tibetan, Sumerian, and certain Indo-European languages (such as Pashto and the Kurdish languages and many Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi–Urdu). It has also been attributed to the Semitic modern Aramaic (also called Neo-Aramaic) languages. Ergative languages are classified into two groups: those that are morphologically ergative but syntactically behave as accusative (for instance, Basque, Pashto and Urdu) and those that, on top of being ergative morphologically, also show ergativity in syntax. No language has been recorded in which both the morphological and syntactical ergative are present. Languages that belong to the former group are more numerous than those to the latter. Dyirbal is said to be the only representative of syntactic ergativity, yet it displays accusative alignment with certain pronouns.

The ergative-absolutive alignment is in contrast to nominative–accusative alignment, which is observed in English and most other Indo-European languages, where the single argument of an intransitive verb (&quot;She&quot; in the sentence &quot;She walks&quot;) behaves grammatically like the agent (subject) of a transitive verb (&quot;She&quot; in the sentence &quot;She finds it&quot;) but different from the object of a transitive verb (&quot;her&quot; in the sentence &quot;He likes her&quot;). When ergative–absolutive alignment is coded by grammatical case, the case used for the single argument of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb is the absolutive, and the case used for the agent of a transitive verb is the ergative. In nominative-accusative languages, the case for the single argument of an intransitive verb and the agent of a transitive verb is the nominative, while the case for the direct object of a transitive verb is the accusative.

Many languages have ergative–absolutive alignment only in some parts of their grammar (e.g., in the case marking of nouns), but nominative-accusative alignment in other parts (e.g., in the case marking of pronouns, or in person agreement). This is known as split ergativity.

==Ergative vs. accusative languages==

An ergative language maintains a syntactic or morphological equivalence (such as the same word order or grammatical case) for the object of a transitive verb and the single core argument of an intransitive verb, while treating the agent of a transitive verb differently. Such languages are said to operate with S/O syntactic pivot.

This contrasts with nominative–accusative languages such as English, where the single argument of an intransitive verb and the agent of a transitive verb (both called the subject) are treated alike and kept distinct from the object of a transitive verb. Such languages are said to operate with S/A (syntactic) pivot.


(reference for figure:)

These different arguments are usually symbolized as follows:
* A = agent of transitive verb
* O = object of transitive verb (also symbolized as P for &quot;patient&quot;)
* S = core argument (i.e. subject) of intransitive verb

The relationship between ergative and accusative systems can be schematically represented as the following:

&quot;See morphosyntactic alignment for a more technical explanation and a comparison with nominative–accusative languages.&quot;

The word &quot;subject&quot;, as it is typically defined in grammars of nominative–accusative languages, has a different application when referring to ergative–absolutive languages, or when discussing morphosyntactic alignment in general.

Ergative languages tend to be either verb-final or verb-initial; there are few, if any, ergative SVO languages.

==Realization of ergativity==
Ergativity can be found in both morphological and syntactic behavior.

===Morphological ergativity===
If the language has morphological case, then the verb arguments are marked thus:
* The agent of a transitive verb (A) is marked as ergative case, or as a similar case such as oblique.
* The core argument of an intransitive verb (S) and the object of a transitive verb (O) are both marked with absolutive case.

If there is no case marking, ergativity can be marked through other means, such as in verbal morphology. For instance, Abkhaz and most Mayan languages have no morphological ergative case, but they have a verbal agreement structure that is ergative. In languages with ergative–absolutive agreement systems, the absolutive form is usually the most unmarked form of a word (exceptions include Nias and Tlapanec).

The following examples from Basque demonstrate an ergative–absolutive case marking system:

Here &quot;-Ø&quot; represents a zero morpheme, as the absolutive case is unmarked in Basque with proper nouns (i.e., Martin, Diego, Berlin...). The forms for the ergative are &quot;-k&quot; after a vowel, and &quot;-ek&quot; after a consonant. It is a further rule in Basque grammar that in most cases a noun phrase must be closed by a determiner. The default determiner (commonly called the article, which is suffixed to common nouns and usually translatable by &quot;the&quot; in English) is &quot;-a&quot; in the singular and &quot;-ak&quot; in the plural, the plural being marked only on the determiner and never the noun. For common nouns, this default determiner is fused with the ergative case marker. Thus one obtains the following forms for &quot;gizon&quot; (&quot;man&quot;): &quot;gizon-a&quot; (man-the.sing.abs), &quot;gizon-ak&quot; (man-the.pl.abs), &quot;gizon-ak&quot; (man-the.sing.erg), &quot;gizon-ek&quot; (man-the.pl.erg). When fused with the article, the absolutive plural is homophonous with the ergative singular. See Basque grammar for details.

In contrast, Japanese is a nominative–accusative language:

In this language, the argument of the intransitive and agent of the transitive sentence are marked with the same nominative case particle &quot;ga&quot;, while the object of the transitive sentence is marked with the accusative case &quot;o&quot;.

If one sets: A = agent of a transitive verb; S = argument of an intransitive verb; O = object of a transitive verb, then we can contrast normal nominative–accusative English with a hypothetical ergative English:

A number of languages have both ergative and accusative morphology. A typical example is a language that has nominative-accusative marking on verbs and ergative–absolutive case marking on nouns.

Georgian has an ergative alignment, but the agent is only marked with the ergative case in the perfective aspect (also known as the &quot;aorist screeve&quot;). Compare:

: () &quot;The man is eating an apple.&quot;
: () &quot;The man ate an apple.&quot;

 is the root of the word &quot;man&quot;. In the first sentence (present continuous tense) the agent is in the nominative case ( ). In the second sentence, which shows ergative alignment, the root is marked with the ergative suffix .

However, there are some intransitive verbs in Georgian that behave like transitive verbs, and therefore employ the ergative case in the past tense. Consider:

: () &quot;The man sneezed.&quot;

Although the verb &quot;sneeze&quot; is clearly intransitive, it is conjugated like a transitive verb. In Georgian there are a few verbs like these, and there has not been a clear-cut explanation as to why these verbs have evolved this way. One explanation is that verbs such as &quot;sneeze&quot; used to have a direct object (the object being &quot;nose&quot; in the case of &quot;sneeze&quot;) and over time lost these objects, yet kept their transitive behavior.

==== Differing noun-pronoun alignment ====
In rare cases, such as the Australian Aboriginal language Nhanda, different nominal elements may follow a different case-alignment template. In Nhanda, common nouns have ergative-absolutive alignment—like in most Australian languages—but most pronouns instead follow a nominative-accusative template. In Nhanda, absolutive case has a null suffix while ergative case is marked with some allomorph of the suffixes &quot;-nggu&quot; or &quot;-lu.&quot; See the common noun paradigm at play below:

Intransitive Subject (ABS)

Transitive Subject-Object (ERG-ABS)

Compare the above examples with the case marking of pronouns in Nhanda below, wherein all subjects (regardless of verb transitivity) are marked (in this case with a null suffix) the same for case while transitive objects take the accusative suffix &quot;-nha&quot;.

Intransitive Pronoun Subject (NOM)

Transitive Pronoun Subject-Object (NOM-ACC)
===Syntactic ergativity===
Ergativity may be manifested through syntax, such as saying &quot;Arrived I&quot; for &quot;I arrived&quot;, in addition to morphology. Syntactic ergativity is quite rare, and while all languages that exhibit it also feature morphological ergativity, few morphologically ergative languages have ergative syntax. As with morphology, syntactic ergativity can be placed on a continuum, whereby certain syntactic operations may pattern accusatively and others ergatively. The degree of syntactic ergativity is then dependent on the number of syntactic operations that treat the subject like the object. Syntactic ergativity is also referred to as inter-clausal ergativity, as it typically appears in the relation of two clauses.

Syntactic ergativity may appear in:
* Word order (for example, the absolutive argument comes before the verb and the ergative argument comes after it)
* Syntactic pivots
* Relative clauses – determining which arguments are available for relativization
* Subordination
* Switch reference

====Example====

Example of syntactic ergativity in the &quot;conjunction reduction&quot; construction (coordinated clauses) in Dyirbal in contrast with English conjunction reduction. (The subscript (i) indicates coreference.)

English (SVO word order):
# Father returned.
# Father saw mother.
# Mother saw father.
# Father(i) returned and father(i) saw mother.
# Father(i) returned and ____(i) saw mother.
# Father(i) returned and mother saw father(i).
#* Father(i) returned and mother saw ____(i). (ill-formed, because S and deleted O cannot be coreferential.)

Dyirbal (OSV word order):
# Ŋuma banaganyu. (&quot;Father returned.&quot;)
# Yabu ŋumaŋgu buṛan. (lit. &quot;Mother father-&quot;ŋgu&quot; saw&quot;, i.e. &quot;Father saw mother.&quot;)
# Ŋuma yabuŋgu buṛan. (lit. &quot;Father mother-&quot;ŋgu&quot; saw&quot;, i.e. &quot;Mother saw father.&quot;)
# Ŋuma(i) banaganyu, yabu ŋumaŋgu(i) buṛan. (lit. &quot;Father&quot;(i)&quot; returned, mother father-&quot;ŋgu(i)&quot; saw&quot;, i.e. &quot;Father returned, father saw mother.&quot;)
#* Ŋuma(i) banaganyu, yabu ____(i) buṛan. (lit. *&quot;Father&quot;(i)&quot; returned, mother ____&quot;(i)&quot; saw&quot;; ill-formed, because S and deleted A cannot be coreferential.)
# Ŋuma(i) banaganyu, ŋuma(i) yabuŋgu buṛan. (lit. &quot;Father&quot;(i)&quot; returned, father&quot;(i)&quot; mother-&quot;ŋgu&quot; saw&quot;, i.e. &quot;Father returned, mother saw father.&quot;)
# Ŋuma(i) banaganyu, ____(i) yabuŋgu buṛan. (lit. &quot;Father&quot;(i)&quot; returned, ____&quot;(i)&quot; mother-&quot;ŋgu&quot; saw&quot;, i.e. &quot;Father returned, mother saw father.&quot;)

Crucially, the fifth sentence has an S/A pivot and thus is ill-formed in Dyirbal (syntactically ergative); on the other hand, the seventh sentence has an S/O pivot and thus is ill-formed in English (syntactically accusative).





===Split ergativity===

The term &quot;ergative–absolutive&quot; is considered unsatisfactory by some, since there are very few languages without any patterns that exhibit nominative–accusative alignment. Instead they posit that one should only speak of &quot;ergative–absolutive systems&quot;, which languages employ to different degrees.

Many languages classified as ergative in fact show split ergativity, whereby syntactic and/or morphological ergative patterns are conditioned by the grammatical context, typically person or the tense/aspect of the verb. Basque is unusual in having an almost fully ergative system in case-marking and verbal agreement, though it shows thoroughly nominative–accusative syntactic alignment.

In Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), the ergative case is marked on agents in the perfective aspect for transitive and ditransitive verbs (also for intransitive verbs when they are volitional), while in other situations agents appear in the nominative case.

In the Northern Kurdish language Kurmanji, the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs of transitive verbs in past tenses, for the events actually occurred in the past. Present, future and &quot;future in the past&quot; tenses show no ergative mark neither for agents nor the verbs. For example:
:(1) Ez diçim. (I go)
:(2) Ez wî dibînim. (I see him.)
:(3) Ew diçe. (He goes)
:(4) Ew min dibîne. (He sees me.)

but:
:(5) Ez çûm. (I went)
:(6) Min ew dît. (I saw him.)
:(7) Ew çû. (He went.)
:(8) Wî ez dîtim. (He saw me.)

In sentences (1) to (4), there is no ergativity (transitive and intransitive verbs alike). In sentences (6) and (8), the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs.

In Dyirbal, pronouns are morphologically nominative–accusative when the agent is first or second person, but ergative when the agent is a third person.

===Optional ergativity===

Many languages with ergative marking display what is known as &quot;optional ergativity&quot;, where the ergative marking is not always expressed in all situations. McGregor (2010) gives a range of contexts when we often see optional ergativity, and argues that the choice is often not truly &quot;optional&quot; but is affected by semantics and pragmatics. Unlike split ergativity, which occurs regularly but in limited locations, optional ergativity can occur in a range of environments, but may not be used in a way that appears regular or consistent.

Optional ergativity may be motivated by:
* The animacy of the subject, with more &quot;animate&quot; subjects more likely to be marked ergative
* The semantics of the verb, with more &quot;active&quot; or &quot;transitive&quot; verbs more likely to be marked ergative
* The grammatical structure or [tense-aspect-mood]

Languages from Australia, New Guinea and Tibet have been shown to have optional ergativity.

==Distribution of ergative languages==
Prototypical ergative languages are, for the most part, restricted to specific regions of the world: Mesopotamia (Kurdish, and some extinct languages), the Caucasus, the Americas, the Tibetan Plateau, and Australia and parts of New Guinea.

Specific languages and language families include:

Several scholars have hypothesized that Proto-Indo-European was an ergative language, although this hypothesis is controversial.

=== Languages with limited ergativity ===
*In Hindi (Indo-Aryan), ergative alignment occurs only when the verb is in the perfective aspect for transitive verbs (also for intransitive verbs but only when they are volitional). 
*In Pashto, ergative alignment occurs only in the past tense. 
*In Georgian, ergativity only occurs in the perfective. 
*The Philippine languages (e.g., Tagalog) are sometimes considered ergative (Schachter 1976, 1977; Kroeger 1993); however, they have also been considered to have their own unique morphosyntactic alignment. See symmetrical voice.
*In the Neo-Aramaic languages, which are generally classified into 4 groups, only Northeastern (NENA) and Ṭuroyo groups exhibit split ergativity, which is formed in the perfective aspect only, whereas the imperfective aspect is nominative-accusative. Some dialects would only mark unaccusative subjects as ergative. Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, in particular, has an ergative type of construction of the perfective past verbal base, where foregone actions are verbalized by a passive construction with the patient being conferred as the grammatical subject rather than by an active construction, e.g. &quot;baxta qtile&quot; (&quot;the woman was killed by him&quot;). The ergative type of inflection with an agentive phrase has been extended by analogy to intransitive verbs, e.g. &quot;qim-le&quot; (&quot;he has risen&quot;). Aramaic has historically been a nominative-accusative language.

===Sign languages===
Sign languages (for example, Nepali Sign Language) should also generally be considered ergative in the patterning of actant incorporation in verbs. In sign languages that have been studied, classifier handshapes are incorporated into verbs, indicating the subject of intransitive verbs when incorporated, and the object of transitive verbs. (If we follow the &quot;semantic phonology&quot; model proposed by William Stokoe (1991) this ergative-absolutive patterning also works at the level of the lexicon: thus in Nepali Sign Language the sign for TEA has the motion for the verb DRINK with a manual alphabet handshape च /ca/ (standing for the first letter of the Nepali word TEA चिया /chiya:/) being incorporated as the object.)

==Approximations of ergativity in English==

English has derivational morphology that parallels ergativity in that it operates on intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs. With certain intransitive verbs, adding the suffix &quot;-ee&quot; to the verb produces a label for the person performing the action:

:&quot;John has retired&quot; → &quot;John is a retiree&quot;
:&quot;John has escaped&quot; → &quot;John is an escapee&quot;

However, with a transitive verb, adding &quot;-ee&quot; does not produce a label for the person doing the action. Instead, it gives us a label for the person to whom the action is done:

:&quot;Susie employs Mike&quot; → &quot;Mike is an employee&quot;
:&quot;Mike has appointed Susie&quot; → &quot;Susie is an appointee&quot;

Etymologically, the sense in which &quot;-ee&quot; denotes the object of a transitive verb is the original one, arising from French past participles in &quot;-é&quot;. This is still the prevalent sense in British English: the intransitive uses are all 19th-century American coinages and all except &quot;escapee&quot; are still marked as &quot;chiefly U.S.&quot; by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

English also has a number of so-called ergative verbs, where the object of the verb when transitive is equivalent to the subject of the verb when intransitive.

When English nominalizes a clause, the underlying subject of an intransitive verb and the underlying object of a transitive verb are both marked with the possessive case or with the preposition &quot;of&quot; (the choice depends on the type and length of the noun: pronouns and short nouns are typically marked with the possessive, while long and complex NPs are marked with &quot;of&quot;). The underlying subject of a transitive is marked differently (typically with &quot;by&quot; as in a passive construction):

:&quot;(a dentist) extracts a tooth&quot; → &quot;the extraction of a tooth (by a dentist)&quot;
:&quot;(I/The editor) revised the essay&quot; → &quot;(my/the editor&#x27;s) revision of the essay&quot;
:&quot;(I was surprised that) the water boiled&quot; → &quot;(I was surprised at) the boiling of the water&quot;
:&quot;I departed on time (so I could catch the plane)&quot; → &quot;My timely departure (allowed me to catch the plane)&quot;

<text>In linguistic typology, nominative–accusative alignment is a type of morphosyntactic alignment in which subjects of intransitive verbs are treated like subjects of transitive verbs, and are distinguished from objects of transitive verbs in basic clause constructions. Nominative–accusative alignment can be coded by case-marking, verb agreement and/or word order. It has a wide global distribution and is the most common alignment system among the world&#x27;s languages (including English). Languages with nominative–accusative alignment are commonly called nominative–accusative languages.

==Comparison with other alignment types==

A transitive verb is associated with two noun phrases (or arguments): a subject and a direct object. An intransitive verb is associated with only one argument, a subject. The different kinds of arguments are usually represented as S, A, and O. S is the sole argument of an intransitive verb, A is the subject (or most agent-like) argument of a transitive verb, and O is the direct object (or most patient-like) argument of a transitive verb. English has nominative–accusative alignment in its case marking of personal pronouns: the single argument (S) of an intransitive verb (&quot;I&quot; in the sentence &quot;I walked.&quot;) behaves grammatically like the agent (A) of a transitive verb (&quot;I&quot; in the sentence &quot;I saw them.&quot;) but differently from the object (O) of a transitive verb (&quot;me&quot; in the sentence “they saw me.&quot;).

This is in contrast with ergative–absolutive alignment, where S is coded in the same way as O, while A receives distinct marking, or tripartite alignment, where A, S and O all are coded in a different manner.

===Split ergativity===
It is common for languages (such as Georgian and Hindustani) to have overlapping alignment systems, which exhibit both nominative–accusative and ergative–absolutive coding, a phenomenon called split ergativity. In fact, there are relatively few languages that exhibit only ergative–absolutive alignment (called pure ergativity) and tend to be isolated in certain regions of the world, such as the Caucasus, parts of North America and Mesoamerica, the Tibetan Plateau, and Australia. Such languages include Sumerian, Standard Tibetan, and Mayan.

==Coding properties of nominative–accusative alignment==
Nominative–accusative alignment can manifest itself in visible ways, called coding properties. Often, these visible properties are morphological and the distinction will appear as a difference in the actual morphological form and spelling of the word, or as case particles (pieces of morphology) which will appear before or after the word.

===Case marking===
If a language exhibits morphological case marking, arguments S and A will appear in the nominative case and argument O will appear in the accusative case, or in a similar case such as the oblique. There may be more than one case fulfilling the accusative role; for instance, Finnish marks objects with the partitive or the accusative to contrast telicity. It is highly common for only accusative arguments to exhibit overt case marking while nominative arguments exhibit null (or absent) case markings. In Modern English, case marking is only found with first and (non-neuter) third person pronouns, which have distinct subject and object forms.

====Differential object marking (DOM)====

Not all arguments are equally likely to exhibit overt case marking. In languages with nominative–accusative alignment, it is common to divide direct objects into two classes (with respect to overt case marking), a phenomenon called ‘differential object marking’ by Bossong (1985).

===Word order===
Some languages code very little through morphology and are more dependent on syntax to encode meaning and grammatical relationships. If a language relies less on overt case marking, alignment may be coded through word order, as in this example from Indonesian.

Indonesian
In the following example from French, all subjects, both S and A, appear before the verb while O appears after the verb. Arguments occurring before the verb are coded as nominative, while arguments occurring directly after the verb are coded as accusative.

French


===Verb agreement===
Alternatively, alignment can also manifest visibly through agreement on the verb. In the following example from Amharic, the verb can be head-marked for S, A, and O. Both S in the intransitive clause and A in the transitive clause are marked by the same affix (&quot;-ə&quot; ‘3SG.M’), while O in the transitive clause is marked by a different affix (&quot;-w&quot; ‘3SG.M.O’).

;Amharic

:intransitive
:transitive
English has residual verb agreement with nominative–accusative alignment, which is only manifest with third person singular S and A in present tense.

==Behavioral properties of accusativity==

Nominative–accusative alignment can also be distinguished through behavioral properties, in the way a nominative or accusative argument will behave when placed in particular syntactic constructions. This has to do with the impact of alignment on the level of the whole sentence rather than the individual word. Morphosyntactic alignment determines which arguments can be omitted in a coordinate structure during the process of conjunction reduction (deleting arguments from the ends of joined clauses). In nominative–accusative, only arguments S and A can be omitted and not argument O.

English
:a. Sue-NOMi saw Judy-ACCj , and shei/j ran.
:b. Suei saw Judyj and ___i/*j ran.
:c. Suei saw Judyj, and shei/j was frightened.
:d. Suei saw Judyj and ___i/*j was frightened.
The omitted subject argument of the embedded clause must correspond to the subject (nominative) of the matrix-clause. If it corresponds to the object (accusative), the sentence is ungrammatical.

If English were an ergative–absolutive language, one would expect to see:
:b’. Suei saw Judyj, and ___*i/j ran.
:c’. Suei saw Judyj, and ___*i/j was frightened.
Here the omitted argument of the embedded clause corresponds to the direct object (absolutive) of the matrix-clause. If it corresponds to the subject (ergative), the sentence is ungrammatical.

The alignment system also impacts the triggering and realization of other such syntactic processes as raising constructions, subject-controlled subject deletion and object-controlled subject deletion.

==Distribution==

Languages exhibiting accusative alignment are the most widespread of all of the alignment types. These languages can be found on every continent, in comparison to languages with ergative alignment that are restricted to certain areas of the world, namely the Caucasus, parts of North American and Mesoamerica, the Tibetan plateau, and Australia. The map shows the distribution of languages with the various alignment types, and the following list gives a short sampling of accusative languages and their distribution across the globe:


==Relevant theory==

===Optimality theory===
 One of the ways in which the production of a nominative–accusative case marking system can be explained is from an Optimality Theoretic perspective. Case marking is said to fulfill two functions, or constraints: an identifying function and a distinguishing function. The identifying function is exemplified when case morphology encodes (identifies) specific semantic, thematic, or pragmatic properties or information about the nominal argument. Accusative case in the position of the direct object, for example, can be a strong identifier of patienthood. The distinguishing function is used to distinguish between the core arguments, the subject and the object, of a transitive clause. Helen de Hoop and Andrej Malchukov explain the motivation and need for the distinguishing function in &quot;Case marking strategies&quot;:

It is rare for case to serve only the distinguishing function, which overlaps greatly with the ‘identify’ function. Other ways of disambiguating the arguments of a transitive predicate (subject agreement, word order restriction, context, intonation, etc.) may explain this cross-linguistic observation. De Hoop and Malchukov argue that case systems that are completely based on the identification function must be richer in case morphology compared to languages based mainly on the distinguishing function.

===Functional pressure===

One theory that has been posited to account for the occurrence of accusative systems is that of functional pressure. When applied to languages, this theory operates around the various needs and pressures on a speech community. It has been suggested that languages have evolved to suit the needs of their users.These communities will develop some functional system to meet the needs that they have. So, it has been proposed that the accusative system arose from a functional pressure to avoid ambiguity and make communication a simpler process.

It is useful for languages to have a means of distinguishing between subjects and objects, and between arguments A, S, and O. This is helpful so that sentences like &quot;Tom hit Fred&quot; cannot be interpreted as &quot;Fred hit Tom.&quot; Tripartite alignment systems accomplish this differentiation by coding S, A and O all differently. However, this is not structurally economical, and tripartite systems are comparatively rare, but to have all arguments marked the same makes the arguments too ambiguous. Alongside the principle of distinguishability seems to operate a principle of economy. It is more efficient to have as few cases as possible without compromising intelligibility. In this way the dual pressures of efficiency and economy have produced a system which patterns two kinds of arguments together a third separately. Both accusative and ergative systems use this kind of grouping to make meaning clearer.

<doc id="604782" wikidata="Q6131327" url="?curid=604782" title="The Second Maiden's Tragedy">
<text>The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy is a Jacobean play that survives only in manuscript. It was written in 1611, and performed in the same year by the King&#x27;s Men. The manuscript was acquired but never printed by the publisher Humphrey Moseley after the closure of the theatres in 1642. In 1807, the manuscript was acquired by the British Museum. Victorian poet and critic, Algernon Swinburne, was the first to attribute this work to Thomas Middleton; this judgement has since been joined by most editors and scholars. The play has received few modern revivals. It was the opening production at the newly refurbished Hackney Empire studio in 2006 starring Alexander Fiske-Harrison and Jos Vantyler.

==Title==

The play&#x27;s original title is unknown. The manuscript bears no title, and the censor, George Buc, added a note beginning &quot;This second &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (for it hath no name inscribed)...&quot;. Buc was possibly comparing the play to Beaumont and Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Maid&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;. Buc&#x27;s comment confused a seventeenth-century owner of the manuscript, Humphrey Moseley, who listed the play in the Stationers&#x27; Register as &quot;The Maid&#x27;s Tragedy, 2nd Part&quot;. Buc&#x27;s title has stuck and the play is usually referred to as &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;.

However, two recent editors of the play have preferred to retitle it. In his anthology &quot;Four Jacobean Sex Tragedies&quot;, Martin Wiggins argues that since the word &quot;second&quot; refers to the play, not to a character (there is no &quot;second maiden&quot;), Buc was actually calling the play &quot;The Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;. In &quot;Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works&quot;, Julia Briggs goes further: pointing out that the word &quot;maiden&quot; never appears in the play, she retitles it &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, after the unnamed female protagonist.

Briggs was anticipated by the 1994 Hen and Chicken production in Bristol, which also used &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;. Other theatrical productions have also retitled the play. For example, in 1984, the first, modern professional production at London&#x27;s Upstream Theatre called it &quot;The Tyrant&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, after the play&#x27;s primary protagonist. The play has similarly been known in the past as simply &quot;The Tyrant&quot;, identifying it as being a lost play by Philip Massinger of the same title.

==Authorship==
===Thomas Middleton===
The play&#x27;s authorship is also contested. On the manuscript, three crossed-out attributions in seventeenth century hands attribute it first to Thomas Goffe, then to William Shakespeare, and then to George Chapman. Today, however, the scholarly consensus is that the true author was Thomas Middleton, as indicated by linguistic analysis, and by its similarity with other Middleton plays. It was first published under Middleton&#x27;s name in Martin Wiggins&#x27;s anthology &quot;Four Jacobean Sex Tragedies&quot; (1998), and subsequently in the 2007 &quot;Collected Works&quot; of Middleton.

===Shakespeare and &quot;Cardenio&quot;===
Professional handwriting expert Charles Hamilton claimed in a 1994 book that the manuscript of &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; is in fact the lost Shakespearean play &quot;Cardenio&quot; and indeed that the handwriting is Shakespeare&#x27;s. Scholars have given little consideration to this idea, agreeing with the Middleton attribution. The play does appear to draw on elements of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, as &quot;Cardenio&quot; is assumed to have done. Julia Briggs points out that as &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Cardenio&quot; the play received greater awareness and acquired new theatrical life, with several productions in the 1990s.

Although &quot;The Second Maiden’s Tragedy&quot; has been generally credited to Middleton, there is evidence that Shakespeare could have contributed to the play. When examining the manuscript, there are slips of paper that were added to the prompt book, which shows revisions or notes. These slips of paper have been examined and it is quite certain that Middleton did not write these revisions, as they do not resemble his handwriting. However, the notes resemble the handwriting assumed to be Shakespeare&#x27;s. It is also possible that Shakespeare could have written these notes because at the time the play was to be produced, Shakespeare was still in the King&#x27;s Court, and could have been working on the play and had influence. Therefore, despite the consensus that Shakespeare is not responsible for the writing of &quot;The Second Maiden’s Tragedy&quot;, it is quite possible that Shakespeare was involved in its production and revision.

== Plot vs. sub-plot ==
&quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; contains both a plot and a subplot, and they share similar and different characteristics. The plot and subplot are connected to each other only loosely, in that the main plot&#x27;s protagonist, Govianus, is the brother of Anselmus, one of the primary characters in the subplot. Thematically, however, there are more interesting connections at work. The purpose behind having a plot and a subplot is to have two stories that magnify the &quot;fundamental contrasts inherent in the material&quot;. The inspiration behind the subplot comes from Miguel de Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. From Cervantes&#x27;s text, Middleton wrote a similar story and created a different resolution to the subplot. There are similarities and differences between the two.

=== Similarities ===
Both stories revolve around the women of the stories and the conflicts they face when it comes to love. Within the plot, the Lady is to be married to Govianus, but the Tyrant constantly pursues her. Within the subplot, the Wife is married to Anselmus, and a man who is not her husband also pursues her. In each plot, both women must choose whether to remain faithful to their husbands, or whether to give in to lust, and this is where the two plots diverge.

=== Differences ===
The first difference is that the two women are faced with a test, which leads to two different outcomes. This test is used to understand whether or not both the Lady and the Wife will remain faithful to Govianus and Anselmus. The Lady passes the test and because she does, she is given peace and salvation for her decision. The Wife fails to remain faithful and she faces corrosive conflict; because of her decision, the Wife is constantly in conflict with her own guilty conscience. The plot contains a &quot;blameless protagonist whose wholly undeserved catastrophe is caused by the persecution of a villain and is treated as triumphant martyrdom&quot;. The Lady, after her death, is declared a martyr and is further glorified by those who surround her, especially Govianus. Govianus states, &quot;Come thow delitious treasure of mankinde to him that knowes what vertuous woman is&quot; as a way of honoring the Lady one final time. He refers to her as a woman of virtue, even though she commits suicide. Her body is &quot;placed on a throne and crowned, before it solemnly bourne back into her tomb&quot;. The Lady&#x27;s death is one of honor and a death that benefits other people. Within the subplot, the protagonist is faced with immense feelings of guilt. These feelings result in her ultimate surrender, which is exposed through her choice of suicide. The Wife&#x27;s death is described as a reckless display of despair, and she is not given the honor that the Lady received. Instead, she &quot;has dragged her husband and her lover down with her to degradation and death&quot;. The Wife ruins the esteem of both her husband and her lover and leaves a mark on their reputation forever. After her death, Anselmus states, “&quot;The serpents wisdome is in weemens lust&quot; because he believes that the devil takes part in all that the Wife goes through in the story.

==Major themes==
Throughout &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; there are many prominent themes. Necrophilia was brought up when the Tyrant wanted to have sex with the dead body of the Lady whom he was trying to preserve, this could be viewed as attachment. The Tyrant was fascinated with the Lady&#x27;s beauty and after she killed herself to escape his grasp this was the only way he could feel satisfied. She would not grant him access to her body throughout the first act of the play when the Tyrant asked her to marry him. By refusing the requests of his authority she was then placed under house arrest only furthering tensions between the Tyrant and the Lady. The Tyrant also made attempts to take the Lady to bed with him which were unsuccessful. This fascination would lead to his death at the end of the play. The Lady shows great sense of pride in upholding her morals throughout the play. &quot;The Lady resists temptation […] the Lady is free from taint […] and the Lady meets her death with noble conviction.&quot; This is holding herself to a high standard which in turn makes her body more desirable by the Tyrant. The Female corpse can be seen as a prominent theme in The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy because it was the center of attention after the Lady&#x27;s death.

Face Painting could be seen as a sense of life because the Tyrant uses face paint so the corpse of the Lady would seem more alive. This relates back to his original plan of using the body for necrophilia, as he was trying to make the body lifelike again. The female body could be seen as an erotic figure because sexual attractiveness and deadness can become indistinguishable.&quot; This scene in the play could have been used to spark voyeuristic interests from the audience. Using the female body as an object of infatuation would allow the Tyrants ambitions to be shown after the climax of the play. There are also underlying influences of face painting, as the strategic use of face painting was popular during the Renaissance. T.W. Craik comments that face painting often is used to signify moral corruption. This is significant because &quot;The Second Maiden’s Tragedy&quot; can be viewed as a commentary on the political life. During the time that the play was written, it was believed that the court of James I was &quot;very much in need of moral cleansing&quot;. Therefore, the presence of face painting in &quot;The Second Maiden’s Tragedy&quot; exemplifies the sin and corruption of James I. Furthermore, the poisoned lips which lead to the Tyrant&#x27;s death is also significant. It was well known that in the Jacobean era, makeup was in fact poisonous. The use of Lady&#x27;s lips poisoning the Tyrant can be seen to draw attention to sexual corruption.This also relates to the belief that those in power were corrupted during the time of &quot;The Second Maiden’s Tragedy&quot;.

The female body of the Wife also caused problems within the play and controversially led to the climax of the play. The Wife kills Votarius after he tried seducing her after he fell in love with her unexpectedly. Anselmus was pleased to see her faithfulness so he killed Leonella who accused the Wife of being unfaithful. However, this action causes the Wife&#x27;s death in a sword fight between Anselmus and Bellarius. Female action sparked men&#x27;s motives to be brought forth which caused this bloody scene. Loyalty and trust are also important because many relationships throughout the play were questioned just like Anselmus&#x27; wife. Votarius&#x27; wife had proven her love for him and Anselmus showed doubts about his wife&#x27;s. This sent the characters into disarray when Votarius actually fell in love with Anselmus&#x27; wife who had shown her nonexistent loyalty to Anselmus. This loyalty stunt could be seen as ironic to the genre of the play which is a tragedy. This play &quot;concerns characters who are fundamentally blind, who fail to understand the world in which they live, who insist on undoing themselves.&quot; However, in this instance the action and feeling of falling in love could not be undone and it turns into disastrous consequences. Chaste within this text is symbolic because the female body is seen as an idol and being unfaithful outside of the marriage would be a big deal. For the male characters in the text such as the Tyrant having sex with multiple people wasn&#x27;t a problem because he had a lot of power. If a woman did this there could be varying consequences though because of their husbands. Another thing that is interesting is the disconnection between body and spirit. When the Lady died it was clear that her corpse was without spirit since her spirit sought after the rescue of the maternal body from the Tyrant. It can be argued that &quot;the figure of the Lady is divided into three personae that are ultimately irreconcilable.&quot; These can be classified as her living body, her desecrated corpse, and her sainted spirit. Each of these played a role in deceiving the Tyrant and making him look like a bad character. Even though the play may demonize the Tyrant as a monster, the presumed forces of virtue ultimately prove complicit in his transgression.&quot; These can all be interrelated in The Second Maiden’s Tragedy as the play had many connecting events and themes.

== Major influences ==
There are many cultural and political components that influenced Second Maiden’s Tragedy. A ruler who is after a pure, beautiful, woman was a very popular theme and used often during this time

=== Sophronia ===
The story of a Christian martyr named Sophronia can be viewed as an influence to the plot line of &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;. She can be seen as an influence due to her similarity to Lady, who kills herself after the Tyrant orders guards to take her and bring her to him. Sophronia also commits suicide, stabbing herself, when an emperor, Maxentius, sends messengers.This influence is plausible because the story and events of Sophronia&#x27;s death was well known during the time period that the play was written.

=== Religious Influences ===
The death of the character Lady in &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; can be seen as a parallel to the death and Resurrection of Christ. Similar to the women who visited the tomb of Jesus and could not find his body in the tomb, Govianus goes to visit the tomb of Lady and finds her body gone. An angel tells the women that Jesus is &quot;not here&quot;, and the spirit of Lady tells Govianus &quot;I am not here.&quot;

=== Talmudic legend and Herod ===
There is a specific reference to a Talmudic legend in &quot;The Second Maiden’s Traged&quot;y named Mariamme, which can be seen as a direct influence in the play. It appears in ib. Iii 115–120,&quot;I once read of a Herod, whose affection/pursued a virgin&#x27;s love, as I did thine, who for the hate she owed him killed himself, as thou too rashly didst, without all pity “. The woman, Mariamne commits suicide, throwing herself off a roof, in order to save herself from marrying Herod, who killed everyone else in her family. This is similar to &quot;The Second Maiden’s Tragedy&quot; because the Lady kills herself in order to escape the Tyrant, and she has no other family besides her imprisoned father, Helvetius. After her suicide, her body is preserved using honey. This is clearly similar to the death of Lady and her preservation, as ordered by the Tyrant. Once the Tyrant discovers that Lady has killed herself, he is determined to still have her as her wife, and orders an artist to paint her face with makeup so she can appear alive and have sex with the body. The explicit reference shows both the time period in which &quot;The Second Maiden’s Tragedy&quot; was written in and also shows how outside cultural knowledge influenced the events and plot of the play

==Synopsis==
The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy is centered on four main characters: Govianus, the virtuous king of the story, his fiancée who is referred to as the Lady, Govianus&#x27; brother Anselmus, and his wife who is referred to as the Wife.

ACT ONE
* The Tyrant has deposed the rightful king Govianus and declares his intent to marry the Lady, Helvetius&#x27;s daughter. The Tyrant banishes Govianus. Before Govianus is allowed to depart, however, he&#x27;s forced to watch the Tyrant woo the Lady, so he can see truly everything he&#x27;s lost. The Lady appears in black and says she can never bend her mind to love the Tyrant, since she&#x27;s already in love with Govianus and will not give him up. Helvetius encourages the Lady to honor the Tyrant, but she kisses Govianus instead. The Tyrant revokes the banishment, since the Lady is set to depart with Govianus and he refuses to lose her. He&#x27;s put under house arrest with Memphonius instead. The Lady is locked up too, within sight but out of reach of Govianus, to torment him. The Tyrant instructs Helvetius to move his daughter&#x27;s heart.
* Anselmus, Govianus&#x27;s brother, worries over his wife&#x27;s fidelity with his friend Votarius. He asks Votarius to try to cuckold him in order settle his mind. Wife and Votarius talk about Anselmus, and Wife asks Votarius to help her cheer him up and return him from &quot;the desolate path&quot; because she misses him. Votarius tells Anselmo that his wife is chaste and loves him deeply. Anselmus refuses to believe this. Votarius tries again, this time actually hitting on Wife. In the process, he begins to fall in love with her a little and vows to go from hence and never see her more. She rebukes him, but then also begins to fall in love with him a little. Votarius departs. Wife calls Leonella, her companion, and tells her to never be away from her side, probably to help Wife keep herself in check. Leonella&#x27;s lover, Bellarius, recognizes the departing Votarius as his enemy, and Leonella vows to let Votarius sleep with Wife so that Bellarius can have the pleasure of watching his enemy fall.

ACT TWO
* Lady and Govianus have befriended their guard, and as long as no one else is around, they have free access to each other and are happy. Helvetius comes to visit Lady and chastises her for her stubbornness and casts aspersions on her parentage. As she remains steadfast, he relents and commends her for her constancy, blesses her, and wishes her joy in Govianus. He then encourages her to take the Tyrant as her lover instead. Govianus enters and shoots at Helvetius, missing him on purpose. He berates Helvetius for forgetting his fatherly bonds and duties. Helvetius recalls himself and apologizes, pledging himself to Govianus, the rightful king.
* Votarius rues his agreement to try Anselmus&#x27;s wife, since it has led him astray and he is powerless to resist, though he recognizes his sin and error. They welcome Anselmus home, who seems to think he has found his wife and friend honest. Votarius wishes for a way out. Bellarius passes through, and Votarius vows to have him rid of the house. He tells Anselmus he suspects Bellarius of whoremongering, and Anselmus departs to slay him in the upstairs chamber. Bellarius jumps out a window to escape, and Votarius gives chase. Leonella protests that Bellarius is her husband and she would never allow him to sleep with the Wife, and offers instead to Anselmus proof that Votarius cuckolded him.
* Helvetius returns to the Tyrant to tell him Lady isn&#x27;t coming, and moreover, that Tyrant is a bad man. Tyrant strips Helvetius of all his titles, and Sophonirus claims them, saying he knows a special charm of ten words that will bring Lady to the Tyrant&#x27;s bed immediately, and offers to leave his own wife in pawn to prove it. Tyrant throws Helvetius in prison. Tyrant sends Sophonirus to Lady with a jewel, and instructions to have her carried away by force if necessary.

ACT THREE
* Sophonirus arrives from the Tyrant to speak with the Lady. Govianus stabs Sophonirus. With his dying breath, Sophonirus tells them that the house is surrounded with men who will break in and steal away the Lady by force. Lady begs Govianus to murder her instead of letting her be stolen and raped by the Tyrant. She prays first and then declares herself ready to die. Govianus protests, but she insists and servants come knocking for Sophonirus. He runs at her with his sword, but faints before he strikes her. She kills herself. Govianus stirs, discovers her body and the servants still knocking, and uses Sophonirus&#x27;s body to barricade the door. As the door is forced open, they stab Sophonirus&#x27;s body, taking it to be Govianus. Govianus tells the Tyrant&#x27;s servants that Sophonirus was cause of the Lady&#x27;s death, and they carry that story back to the Tyrant, secure in their knowledge that they have done a good turn in killing Sophonirus (who was of course already dead). They carry his body out.

ACT FOUR
* Wife and Votarius set up an encounter designed to make the husband Anselmus think that his wife is faithful forever. This will then allow them to carry on with each other ever after. They&#x27;ll hide Anselmus in a closet and let him watch Wife turn down Votarius with anger, which will prove her fidelity and his friend&#x27;s willingness to help. Wife then tells Leonella to hide a weapon in her chamber and to rush to Votarius and remind him to wear &quot;privy armor&quot; so that she can strike him without fear. Leonella relates the plan to Bellarius, who counsels her to forget to remind Votarius to wear the armor, and by that forgetting, Votarius will be actually stabbed and Bellarius will have his revenge. Further, he tells Leonella to poison the weapon so that there&#x27;s no hope of Votarius escaping.
* The Tyrant is wound up over the news of Sophonirus&#x27;s and the Lady&#x27;s deaths. He tells Memphonius to order the execution of the messenger. He blames himself for the Lady&#x27;s death and then orders Govianus&#x27;s release. He asks for keys to the cathedral and a pickaxe so he can break open the Lady&#x27;s tomb and hold her.
* The soldiers refuse to help the Tyrant open the tomb, so he takes the tools and does it himself. He then orders them to move the body out of the tomb. The Tyrant kisses the body and then meditates on her coldness and how he will possess her now in spite of everything. He orders the soldiers to carry her body to the palace where he can have it embalmed and preserved and shower it with riches.
* Govianus goes to visit the tomb. As he speaks to the body within, a voice says &quot;I am not within&quot;. He questions it, and then in a flash of light, the tomb bursts open to reveal the ghost of the Lady, all in white, with a crucifix and jewels. Her spirit tells him her body has been taken by the Tyrant and her rest disturbed, and Govianus vows to set it right as she vanishes.

ACT FIVE
* Votarius hides Anselmus in a closet. Leonella and Wife stage a conversation for Anselmus&#x27;s benefit about how Wife will kill herself if Votarius won&#x27;t leave her alone. Votarius enters and Wife puts him off, then stabs him with the poisoned sword. He dies, and Anselmus leaps from the closet. Accusing Leonella of slandering her mistress, he stabs her. Bellarius enters and challenges Anselmus. Wife gets between them on purpose, and they both kill her by &quot;running through the swords of Anselmus and Belarius to her death&quot;. They continue fighting and both wound each other. Anselmus dies first. Govianus arrives and Bellarius explains what has happened, and then dies. Anselmus revives, having heard the tale of his wife&#x27;s wantonness, and curses his wife. He crawls away from her body and then dies for real.
* The Tyrant&#x27;s servants bring in the body of the Lady in a chair, dressed all in black and covered in a pearl chain with a crucifix. Music plays while he makes obeisance to her. Govianus arrives in the guise of a painter hired to make the Lady&#x27;s portrait. The Tyrant instructs him to paint her face so that she looks alive, and Govianus does so begrudgingly. Tyrant takes up the body and kisses it, and then feels ill, at which point Govianus throws off his disguise and says the paint is poisoned. The Lady&#x27;s ghost appears, terrifying the Tyrant and comforting Govianus. She thanks Govianus for his actions and departs, apparently at rest. The other nobles arrive and Tyrant tells them to arrest Govianus, but they pledge their allegiance to him instead. The Tyrant dies. Govianus directs them to crown the Lady&#x27;s body as his queen before returning her to her tomb, and the court files out.

<text>In immunology, seroconversion is the development of specific antibodies in the blood serum as a result of infection or immunization, including vaccination. During infection or immunization, antigens enter the blood, and the immune system begins to produce antibodies in response. Before seroconversion, the antigen itself may or may not be detectable, but the antibody is absent. During seroconversion, the antibody is present but not yet detectable. After seroconversion, the antibody is detectable by standard techniques and remains detectable unless the individual seroreverts, in a phenomenon called seroreversion, or loss of antibody detectability, which can occur due to weakening of the immune system or decreasing antibody concentrations over time. Seroconversion refers the production of specific antibodies against specific antigens, meaning that a single infection could cause multiple waves of seroconversion against different antigens. Similarly, a single antigen could cause multiple waves of seroconversion with different classes of antibodies. For example, most antigens prompt seroconversion for the IgM class of antibodies first, and subsequently the IgG class.

Seroconversion rates are one of the methods used for determining the efficacy of a vaccine. The higher the rate of seroconversion, the more protective the vaccine for a greater proportion of the population. Seroconversion does not inherently confer immunity or resistance to infection. Only some antibodies, such as anti-spike antibodies for COVID-19, confer protection.

Because seroconversion refers to detectability by standard techniques, seropositivity status depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. As a result, assays, like any serum test, may give false positives or false negatives and should be confirmed if used for diagnosis or treatment.

== Mechanism ==
The physical structure of an antibody allows it to bind to a specific antigen, such as bacterial or viral proteins, to form a complex. Because antibodies are highly specific in what they bind, tests can detect specific antibodies by replicating the antigen which that antibody binds to. Assays can likewise detect specific antigens by replicating the antibodies that bind to them. If an antibody is already bound to an antigen, that antibody and that antigen cannot bind to the test. Antibody tests therefore cannot detect that specific antibody molecule. Due to this binding, if the amounts of antigen and antibody in the blood are equal, each antibody molecule will be in a complex and be undetectable by standard techniques. The antigen, which is bound as well, will also be undetectable. The antibody or antigen is only detectable in the blood when there is substantially more of one than the other. Standard techniques require a high enough concentration of antibody or antigen to detect the amount of antibody or antigen; therefore, they cannot detect the small amount that is not bound during seroconversion.

The immune system may take several days or weeks to detect antigen in tissue, begin to create antibodies, and ramp up the production of antibodies to counter the antigen. As a result, the antigen molecules outnumber the antibody molecules in the early stages of an infection. Because there are more antigen molecules than antibody molecules, the majority of the antibody molecules are bound to antigen. Thus, tests at this stage are unable to detect sufficient unbound antibodies. On the other hand, there may be unbound antigen that can be detectable. As seroconversion progresses, the amount of antibody in the blood gradually rises. Eventually the amount of antibody outnumbers the amount of antigen. At this time, the majority of the antigen molecules is bound to antibodies, and the antigen is undetectable. Conversely, there is a substantial amount of unbound antibodies, allowing standard techniques to detect these antibodies.

== Terminology ==
Serological assays are tests that detect specific antibodies and are used to determine whether those antibodies are in an organism&#x27;s blood; such tests require a significant concentration of unbound antibody in the blood serum. Serostatus is a term denoting the presence or absence of particular antibodies in an individual&#x27;s blood. An individual&#x27;s serostatus may be positive or negative. During seroconversion, the specific antibody being tested for is generated. Therefore, before seroconversion, the serological assay will not detect any antibody, and the individual&#x27;s serostatus is seronegative for the antibody. After seroconversion, sufficient concentration of the specific antibody exists in the blood, and the serological assay will detect the antibody. The individual is now seropositive for the antibody.

During seroconversion, when the amounts of antibody and antigen are very similar, it may not be possible to detect free antigen or free antibody. This may give a false negative result when testing for the infection. The time during which the amount of antibody and antigen are sufficiently similar that standard techniques will be unable to detect the antibody or antigen is referred to as the window period. Since different antibodies are produced independently of one another, a given infection may have several window periods. Each specific antibody has its own window period.

Similarly, because standard techniques utilize assumptions about the specificity of antibodies and antigens and are based on chemical interactions, these tests are not completely accurate. Serological assays may give a false positive result, causing the individual to appear to have seroconverted when the individual has not. False positives can occur due to the test reacting to, or detecting, an antibody that happens to be sufficiently similar in structure to the target antibody. Antibodies are generated randomly, so the immune system has a low chance of generating an antibody capable of weakly binding to the assay by coincidence. More rarely, individuals who have recently had some vaccines or who have certain autoimmune conditions can temporarily test falsely seropositive. Due to the possibility of false positives, positive test results are usually reported as &quot;reactive.&quot; This indicates that the assay reacted to antibodies, but this does not mean that the individual has the specific antibodies tested for.

Seroreversion is the opposite of seroconversion. During seroreversion, the amount of antibody in the serum decreases. This decrease may occur naturally as a result of the infection resolving and the immune system slowly tamping down its response, or as a result of loss of the immune system. Different infections and antigens lead to the production of antibodies for differing periods of time. Some infections may lead to antibodies that the immune system produces for years after the infection resolves. Others lead to antibodies that the immune system only produces for a few weeks following resolution. After seroreversion, tests can no longer detect antibodies in a patient&#x27;s serum.

The immune system generates antibodies to any antigen, so seroconversion can occur as a result of either natural infection or as a result of vaccination. Detectable seroconversion and the timeline of seroconversion are among of the parameters studied in evaluating the efficacy of vaccines. A vaccine does not need to have a 100% seroconversion rate to be effective. As long as a sufficient proportion of the population seroconverts, the entire population will be effectively protected by herd immunity.

An individual being seropositive means that the individual has antibodies to that antigen, but it does not mean that that individual has immunity or even resistance to the infection. While antibodies form an important part of the immune system&#x27;s ability to fight off and resolve an infection, antibodies and seropositivity alone do not guarantee that an individual will resolve the infection. An individual who is seropositive for anti-HIV antibodies will retain that infection chronically unless treated with medications specific to HIV. Conversely, seroconversion in other infections may indicate resistance or immunity. For example, higher concentrations of antibodies after seroconversion in individuals vaccinated against COVID-19 predicts reduced chance of breakthrough infection.

Although seroconversion refers to the production of sufficient quantities of antibodies in the serum, the word seroconversion is often used more specifically in reference to blood testing for anti-HIV antibodies. In particular, &quot;seroconverted&quot; has been used to refer to the process of having &quot;become HIV positive&quot;. This indicates that the individual has a detectable amount of anti-HIV antibodies. An individual may have a transmittable HIV infection before the individual becomes HIV positive due to the window period.

In epidemiology, seroconversion is often used in reference to observing the evolution of a virus from a host or natural reservoir host to the human population. Epidemiologists compare archived human blood specimens taken from infected hosts before an epidemic and later specimens from infected hosts at later stages of the epidemic. In this context, seroconversion refers to the process of anti-viral antibodies becoming detectable in the human population serum.

==Background==
The immune system maintains an immunological memory of infectious pathogens to facilitate early detection and to confer protective immunity against a rechallenge. This explains why many childhood diseases never recur in adulthood (and when they do, it generally indicates immunosuppression).

It generally takes several days for B cells to begin producing antibodies, and it takes further time for those antibodies to develop sufficient specificity to bind strongly to their specific antigen. In the initial (primary infection) phase of the infection, the immune system responds by generating weakly binding immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies; although they individually bind weakly, each IgM antibody has many binding regions and can thus make for an effective initial mobilization of the immune system. Over time, immunoglobulin class switching will result in IgM-generating B-cells switching to more specific IgG-generating B-cells. Levels of IgM then gradually decline and eventually become undetectable by immunoassays, while levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels rise and become detectable. After the infection resolves, levels of IgM antibodies generally fall to completely undetectable levels as the immune response self-regulates, but some plasma cells will remain as memory cells to produce levels of IgG that will frequently remain detectable for months to years after the initial infection.

Upon reinfection, levels of both IgM and IgG rise, with IgM antibodies having a more rapid but smaller and less sustained peak, and IgG antibodies having a slightly slower, but far greater peak sustained over a longer period of time compared to IgM antibodies. Subsequent infections will demonstrate similar patterns, with initial IgM peaks and significantly stronger IgG peaks, with the IgG peak occurring more rapidly during subsequent infections. Thus an elevated IgM titre indicates recent primary infection or acute reinfection, while the presence of IgG suggests past infection or immunization.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19) sometimes does not follow the usual pattern, with IgM sometimes occurring after IgG, together with IgG, or not occurring at all. Generally, however, median IgM detection occurs 5 days after symptom onset, and IgG is detected a median 14 days after symptom onset.

== In HIV ==

Most individuals infected with HIV will begin to produce antibodies within a few weeks after their initial exposure to HIV. During the window period, the antibody assay cannot detect unbound anti-HIV antibodies and will indicate that the individual is seronegative. The length of the window period depends on the individual&#x27;s immune response and the particular parameters of the test. An individual in the window period can still infect others despite appearing seronegative on tests because the individual still carries the virus.

The average window period for the development of antibodies to p24 antigen, the standard for testing, is about two weeks. However, the window periods used for the assays are based on capturing as many people as possible. More recent, fourth-generation assays that assess for both the antibody and the antigen can have a window period as short as six weeks to detect more than 99% of infections, while third-generation tests that assess only for unbound antibody tend to have a longer window period of eight to nine weeks. Third-generation tests are no longer recommended if fourth-generation tests are available. Rapid tests procurable at a consumer level often fail to detect antibody until at least three months have passed since the initial infection. It takes longer for fingerstick blood or other fluids to accumulate sufficiently high levels of antibodies compared to venous blood plasma sampling. Thus point of care tests reliant on these sources can have even longer periods. While a reactive (seropositive) rapid point of care test may prompt an individual to undergo further testing. A non-reactive (negative) rapid point of care test should still be followed up with immunoassay testing such as by a fourth-generation test after the window period. Similarly, individuals taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can experience extended window periods compared to the average population, leading to ambiguous testing. Thus, individuals who test negative for HIV before the window period ends for that specific test will usually need to be retested after the window period, as they may fall into the minority who take more time to develop antibodies.

Current CDC recommendations are to begin with a test that screens for both antigen and antibody, then follow up with an immunoassay to differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. Non-reactive (negative) tests are followed up with nucleic acid tests for viral RNA.

About 70-80% of people infected with HIV will experience symptoms during the seroconversion period within about two to four weeks, primarily associated with a high viral load and the immune system&#x27;s acute response to the infection. These symptoms can last for anywhere from a couple of days to several weeks. Some people have no symptoms at all. The symptoms of seroconversion are non-specific and can often be mistaken for a more benign illness such as the flu. Symptoms can include lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph glands), general fatigue and malaise, chills, low-grade fever, sore throat, body aches, night sweats, ulcers in the mouth, pain in the joints and muscles, loss of appetite, headache, and a maculopapular rash on the trunk of the body. Because not all individuals experience the symptoms of seroconversion, and because they are non-specific, individuals should receive testing for HIV if they are high-risk or have possibly had an exposure to HIV. Likewise, if an individual suspects exposure for HIV, a lack of symptoms does not indicate that seroconversion has not occurred. 20–30% of people undergoing HIV seroconversion lack symptoms entirely or have mild symptoms.

The immune system mounts an acute effort to resolve the HIV infection during the seroconversion period. Following this period, the immune system temporarily contains the infection. The symptoms of seroconversion lessen and disappear in most people, with HIV entering a stage of clinical latency. At this stage, the infection remains within the body without causing symptoms, and the viral load gradually increases. The body continues producing anti-HIV antibodies throughout clinical latency, and the HIV infection remains detectable.

Individuals who have become HIV seropositive may benefit from seroconversion testing for comorbid infections for which they are suspectible. For example, positive seroconversion of human herpesvirus 8 is highly predictive of later development of Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma, allowing for individuals who are seropositive to be aware of their risk of developing Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma and thus receive appropriate monitoring.

== In COVID-19 ==
As with other viruses, seroconversion in COVID-19 refers to the development of antibodies in the blood serum against COVID-19 antigens. An individual is seropositive, or has seroconverted for COVID-19, once standard techniques are able to detect COVID-19 antibodies in the blood. Seroconversion testing is primarily used to detect individuals who have been infected with COVID-19 in the past who have already resolved their infections. Due to the time delay of seroconversion compared to viral load, seroconversion is not sufficiently timely to diagnose a current case of COVID-19. However, seroconversion may be helpful for individuals with suspected infections who are negative by RT-PCR testing for viral load.

Some individuals can become seropositive without ever experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or knowing that they were exposed to COVID-19 at any point. Some asymptomatic individuals can still transmit COVID-19 to others. However, it is unclear whether all asymptomatic individuals who seroconvert to COVID-19 had transmissibility at any point (active infection), or whether an individual can seroconvert to COVID-19 without undergoing a period during which they can infect others.

Most standard assays for COVID-19 seroconversion test for antibodies against the COVID-19 specific spike protein (S) and the COVID-19 specific nucleoprotein (N). Concentrations of antibodies develop after several days and reach their maximal value approximately two to three weeks after infection. Some individuals have detectable levels of both IgG and IgM as early as within the first week after symptoms begin. Although viral infections typically have a rise in IgM that precedes a rise in IgG, some individuals infected with COVID-19 have both IgM and IgG responses at approximately the same time. After initial seroconversion for either IgM or both IgG and IgM, concentrations continue to rise and peak within one week after antibodies first become detectable. Concentration of IgM tend to fall within three weeks after symptoms first begin regardless of resolution to the COVID-19 infection. Levels of IgG plateau and remain high for at least six to seven months after the resolution of the infection in most individuals. The length of time that anti-spike IgG remains high varies greatly between different individuals. Older individuals and individuals with less robust immune systems tend to serorevert within a shorter period of time.

Becoming seropositive for COVID-19 antibodies can occur due to either infection with COVID-19 itself or due to becoming vaccinated to COVID-19. Being seropositive for COVID-19 does not intrinsically confer immunity or even resistance. However, higher rates of seroconversion are linked to greater clinical efficacy of vaccines. This suggests that for most individuals, seroconversion does lead to resistance. Studies of the available COVID-19 vaccines have indicated that vaccination causes a stronger seroconversion with a heightened peak concentration of IgG antibodies, as well as a longer plateau of resistance compared to seroconversion from a natural infection of COVID-19. The timeline of seroconversion is similar between seroconversion from infection and seroconversion from vaccines. Antibodies first becoming detectable within approximately two to three weeks. Younger individuals tend to have more robust responses to vaccinations compared to older individuals. The difference in the robustness of the response increases with the second dose. Younger individuals tend to have much higher and more sustained peaks of anti-spike IgG antibodies following the second dose. Many otherwise ill individuals, such as those with cancer or chronic liver disease, still exhibit similar rates of seroconversion to the general population. On the other hand, individuals with weakened immune systems, such as due to immunosuppressive medications or leukemia, can exhibit decreased rates of seroconversion for currently available vaccines. The different vaccines currently utilized do not appear to have significant differences in seroconversion rates when compared in similar population groups.

Seroconversion does not necessarily occur at the same rate to all COVID-19 antigens. Individuals who seroconvert more rapidly to different antigens may have different disease courses. Individuals infected with COVID-19 who developed primarily anti-spike antibodies rather than anti-nucleocapsid antibodies are less likely to have a severe disease course. Studies suggest that anti-spike antibodies confer greater resistance to COVID-19 than anti-nucleocapsid antibodies. A higher ratio of anti-spike antibodies to anti-nucleocapsid antibodies thus serves as a predictor of disease course and patient mortality. As a result, currently available vaccines target the production of anti-spike antibodies rather than anti-nucleocapsid antibodies.

Not all individuals who are infected to COVID-19 seroconvert, including individuals who otherwise fully recover from COVID-19. This could suggest that the individuals are developing antibodies that standard techniques do not cover, that individuals can recover with extremely low levels of antibodies not detectable by standard techniques, or that individuals do not need antibodies against COVID-19 in order to recover. Individuals who recover from COVID-19 but never seroconvert tend to have lower viral loads and be of younger age than individuals who do seroconvert. This may indicate that individuals who have experienced less severe COVID-19 infections are less likely to trigger full responses from their immune systems and that these individuals manage to clear the infection despite not producing sufficient quantities of antibodies or any specific antibodies against COVID-19 at all. Significantly older patients of greater than eighty years old are more likely to have higher quantities of IgG antibodies compared to younger patients at the time of infection. This is consistent with the fact that older patients tend to have more severe COVID-19 infections and thus have higher viral loads compared to younger patients. However, this increased antibody load tends to decrease after about three months post-recovery compared to younger patients, compared to the six to seven months observed in the general population. This implies that the resistance may not last long-term in older individuals, leaving them suspectible to subsequent COVID-19 infections. Some studies have disputed the link between concentrations of antibodies of either IgM or IgG and the severity of the disease course.

Several studies have demonstrated that individuals who recovered from COVID-19 infections and are seropositive for COVID-19 at the time of vaccination produce significantly more anti-spike IgG antibodies in response to vaccination than individuals who are not seropositive for COVID-19, while individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infections but never seroconverted and are seronegative respond similarly to individuals who have never been exposed to COVID-19. Specifically, individuals who are seropositive for COVID-19 at the time of their &quot;first&quot; dose of vaccination have a response similar to the general population&#x27;s response to the &quot;second&quot; dose, due to this increased concentration of IgG antibodies. Some individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may decline vaccination due to the belief that their recovery from infection has a protective effect. Nevertheless, the lack of seroconversion for all former infectees indicates that recovery from infection alone does not guarantee resistance to COVID-19. Even for individuals who seroconverted, seropositivity is at best only as protective as a single dose of vaccine, as opposed to the more robust protection of both doses of the vaccine and subsequent boosters. Therefore, those who have recovered from COVID-19, regardless of seropositivity, are still advised by health bodies such as the CDC to seek vaccination to prevent future reinfection and to limit future potential spread of COVID-19.

== In hepatitis B ==

Seroconversion plays a major role in the diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B infections. As in other viral infections, seropositivity indicates that an individual has a sufficiently high concentration of antibody or antigen in the blood to be detectable by standard techniques. While assays for other infections such as COVID-19 and HIV primarily test for seroconversion of antibodies against antigens, assays for HBV also test for antigens. The standard serology panel for seroconversion include hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody for IgM and IgG, hepatitis B core antibody for IgM and IgG, and hepatitis B e-antigen.

In the typical disease course for hepatitis B, the individual will first seroconvert for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). While some can convert within one week, most individuals take about four weeks after initial infection to convert. Anti-core antibodies (anti-HBc) are the first antibodies produced by the body, first in short-term IgM (anti-HBc IgM), and subsequently in long-term IgG; while levels of IgM anti-HBc will peak around sixteen weeks after exposure and fall within about seven to eight months, IgG anti-HBc will remain detectable in the serum as a sign of chronic infection for years. IgM anti-HBc concentration will fall regardless of whether or not the individual clears the infection. The window period for HBsAg/anti-HBs testing occurs as concentration of HBsAg falls and before the body develops anti-HBs antibodies, lasting approximately six to eight weeks in most individuals. During this time, serology assays can test for total anti-HBc. Levels of anti-surface antibody (anti-HBs) generally become detectable after thirty-two weeks and peak around thirty-six to forty; the production of anti-HBs antibodies indicates imminent resolution of the HBV infection. Anti-HBs concentration falls as the infection resolves but does not serorevert completely, and anti-HBs IgG remains positive for years as a sign of immunity.

Hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) is a sign of current infectivity. An individual who is seropositive for HBeAg can infect others. An individual who is infected with HBV and who never becomes seropositive for HBeAg can likewise be infective, because not all HBV infections produce HBeAg. For most individuals, those who seroconvert positive for HBeAg during their disease course and subsequently serorevert negative as their infection progresses are no longer infective. Seroreversion from HBeAg is thus used as one marker of resolution of infection.

On a serological assay, the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) indicates an individual with a currently active hepatitis B infection, whether acute or chronic. The presence of core antibody (anti-HBc) indicates an individual with an infection in general, whether current or previously resolved. The presence of surface antibody (anti-HBs) indicates an individual with immunity to hepatitis B, whether due to previously resolved infection or due to hepatitis B vaccination. For example, an individual who has never had any exposure to HBV, either by vaccine or by infection, would test negative for the entire serology panel. An individual who has been vaccinated and never had an infection will test seropositive for anti-HBs due to vaccination and negative for markers of infection. An individual with an acute HBV infection would test positive for HBsAg and anti-HBc (total and IgM) while negative for anti-HBs. An individual with a chronic infection would test positive for HBsAg and total anti-HBc (IgM and IgG), but negative for IgM anti-HBc and anti-HBs. An individual who has successfully resolved their HBV infection will test negative for HBsAg, positive for anti-HBc, and may test negative or positive for anti-HBs, although most will test positive..

Some studies have suggested that a significant minority across all population cohorts fails to seroconvert after the standard three-dose series. For these individuals, a booster is recommended. Other studies have indicated that even for those who seroconvert, the immunity conferred may decrease over time, and boosters are also recommended for immunocompromised individuals after five years. However, those who are immunocompetent may forego testing or boosters after the five-year period. Individuals who receive vaccination for HBV should undergo serology testing to confirm seroconversion following the initial vaccine series as well as any boosters. Those who are persistent non-responders to the booster series are unlikely to benefit from additional boosters and should instead be cautioned on prevention.

<text>Guillaume François Rouelle (; 15 September 1703 – 3 August 1770) was a French chemist and apothecary. In 1754 he introduced the concept of a base into chemistry as a substance which reacts with an acid to form a salt.
He is known as &quot;l&#x27;Aîné&quot; (the elder) to distinguish him from his younger brother, Hilaire Rouelle, who was also a chemist and known as the discoverer of urea.

Rouelle started as an apothecary.
He later started a public course in his laboratory in 1738, in 1742 he was appointed experimental demonstrator of chemistry at the Jardin du Roi in Paris. he was especially influential and popular as a teacher, and taught many students among whom were Denis Diderot, Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier, Joseph Proust and Antoine-Augustin Parmentier.

He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1749.

In addition to his investigation of neutral salts, he published papers on the inflammation of turpentine and other essential oils by nitric acid, and the methods of embalming practised in Ancient Egypt.

==Why bases for neutral salts were called bases==
The modern meaning of the word &quot;base&quot; and its general introduction into the chemical vocabulary are usually attributed to Rouelle, who used the term &quot;Base&quot; in a memoir on salts written in 1754 (see The Origin of the Term &quot;Base&quot; by William B. Jensen). In this paper, which was an extension of an earlier memoir on the same subject written in 1744, Rouelle pointed out that the number of known salts had increased significantly during the 17th and early 18th centuries. This was due not only to the preparation of new salts, but also to an increasing ability to distinguish between sodium and potassium compounds, and to a generalization of the concept so as to include many substances, such as the alums and vitriols (i.e., sulfates), that had been previously excluded. In order to incorporate this extended concept of salt formation, Rouelle explicitly defined a neutral salt as the product formed by the union of an acid with any substance, be it a water-soluble alkali, a volatile alkali, an absorbent earth, a metal, or an oil, capable of serving as &quot;a base&quot; for the salt &quot;by giving it a concrete or solid form&quot;.

*Flying Training Award in Undergraduate Pilot Training
*Defense Superior Service Medal
*NASA Space Flight Medal (2)
*Air Force Commendation Medal (2)
* Gulstream Long Beach, Ca. Upstairs North West Conference Room named in his honor

==Military career==
Hammond received his pilot wings at Reese Air Force Base, Texas, in 1975. He was assigned to the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing 496th Tactical Fighter Squadron, Hahn Air Base, Germany, flying the F4E from 1976 to 1979. In 1979–1980, he was an Instructor Pilot in the F-5B/E/F at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, training foreign national students. He attended the &quot;Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School&quot; (ETPS) at Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) Boscombe Down, United Kingdom, in 1981. Hammond returned to Edwards Air Force Base, California, in 1982, where he managed projects in the 6512 Test Squadron until being assigned as an instructor at the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards. As a test pilot school instructor, he flew the F-4, A-7 Corsair II, and A-37, and was the High Angle of Attack program monitor, teaching stall/spin theory and flight training.

He logged over 4,500 hours in 15 American and 10 RAF aircraft.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in May 1984, Hammond became an astronaut in June 1985 and qualified for assignment as a pilot/commander on Space Shuttle flight crews. His technical assignments included serving in Mission Control as an ascent/entry spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM). In that capacity he was directly involved in the decision-making process for flight rules, procedures, techniques, and launch commit criteria. He was also assigned as an Astronaut Support Person (ASP), or &quot;Cape Crusader,&quot; responsible for monitoring Orbiter status as it undergoes testing and maintenance at John F. Kennedy Space Center during preparations for the next flight. Hammond also served as the lead astronaut supporting the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) which tests and verifies the flight software for each Shuttle mission. Hammond was the lead astronaut supporting Orbiter software development and changes, including the Global Positioning System (GPS) avionics upgrade. He also worked on designing new cockpit flight instruments/systems displays for the Multifunctional Electronic Display System (MEDS), a major cockpit upgrade to electronic display systems. A veteran of two space flights, Hammond logged over 462 hours in space. He flew on STS-39 in 1991, and STS-64 in 1994.

Following STS-64, Hammond completed 5 months of intensive Russian language training as preparation for assignment as the Deputy for Operations, Russia. That assignment was subsequently changed to NASA Liaison to USAF HQ/AFSPC, Colorado Springs, where he worked several issues to strengthen ties between NASA, AFSPC, and USAF Astronauts. Hammond was also assigned as Lead Ascent/Entry CAPCOM for missions STS-73 through STS-78. During the same period, Hammond served as the Branch Chief of the Flight Support Branch, supervising CAPCOM and ASP activities. Hammond last assignment at NASA was as the Branch Chief of the Astronaut Office Safety Branch where he monitored all T-38, Shuttle, and Space Station safety issues.

===Spaceflight experience===
Hammond flew as pilot of Discovery on STS-39, the first unclassified Department of Defense mission (April 28 to May 6, 1991). He logged 199 hours and 23 minutes of space flight. The seven-man crew performed numerous scientific experiments to collect data on atmospheric infrared and ultraviolet phenomena including a deploy and rendezvous in support of the Strategic Defense Initiative Office (SDIO).

He was the pilot on STS-64 aboard the Discovery. Mission highlights included: first use of lasers for environmental research; deployment and retrieval of a solar science satellite; robotic processing of semiconductors; use of RMS boom for jet thruster research; first untethered spacewalk in 10 years to test a self-rescue jetpack. Mission duration was 10 days, 22 hours, 51 minutes.

==Aviation career==
Hammond is a test pilot for Gulfstream Aerospace, in Las Vegas, Nevada with wife Kathy. He has a son.

<text>Nanumea is the northwesternmost atoll in the Polynesian nation of Tuvalu, a group of nine coral atolls and islands spread over about of the Pacific Ocean just south of the equator and west of the International Date Line. Nanumea is with a population of 512 people (2017 census).

==Geography==
Located along one edge of the so-called Polynesian triangle, Nanumea lies just south of the Gilbert Islands, which are Micronesian in language and culture. Nanumea is a classic atoll, a series of low islets sitting on a coral reef shelf surrounding a lagoon. About long by wide in overall size, the dry land area is about . The two largest islets Nanumea and Lakena, which comprise 90% of the dry land area of the atoll.

Since the early 1990s, the use of nets and spearing has been prohibited in all parts of the lagoon and the Nanumea Conservation Area was established in 2006. The Nanumea Conservation Area covers about of the central lagoon and consists of about 10% of the reef area of the atoll, including marine habitats and 2 islets. A survey of the conservation zone was conducted in 2010.

The largest villages are Haumaefa with 187 people (2012) and Lolua with 187 people (2012). The junior school is Kaumaile Primary School. There are scattered households across the lagoon from Nanumea village at Matagi and on Motu Foliki, and on the southeastern tip of Lakena islet. Aside from Nanumea and Lakena there are three much smaller islets, Motu Foliki, Lafogaki and Te Afua-a-Taepoa spread around the encircling reef flat. There are 2 mangrove forests, a small patch to the south of Nanumea and another on the islet of Lakena.

The pulaka pits are located on Lakena, as the Nanumeans want the main island of Nanumea to remain mosquito-free. Pulaka is grown in large pits of composted soil below the water table.

In 2011, the kou leafworm (&quot;Ethmia nigroapicella&quot;) had a devastating impact on Nanumea by stripping the leaves of the Kanava trees (&quot;Cordia subcordata&quot;, beach cordia). The Kanava trees provide coastal protection, wind shelter, shade and are habitats for sea birds. The flowers of the Kanava are also locally prized.

In March 2015 Nanumea suffered damage to houses, crops and infrastructure as the result of storm surges caused by Cyclone Pam.

===Climate===
== Climate crisis ==
In 2016 the Tuvalu National Council for Women worked with the Green Climate Fund to enable women from the islands of Nanumea and Nanumaga to be part of talks about climate crisis. One of their key issues was the additional burden of social care that women take on in the aftermath of natural disasters.

The activities of the Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project on Nanumea are designed to reduce exposure to coastal erosion by providing a buffer during storms. 

==Language and cultural links==

Nanumeans are Polynesians. The Nanumean dialect of the Tuvaluan language is closely related to other west Polynesian languages, including the Tongan language, Tokelauan, Samoan, and the languages of the Polynesian outliers. Although the eight Tuvalu communities have distinctive accents and some distinctive vocabulary, the dialects of Tuvalu are mutually intelligible to Tuvalu speakers with the exception of the language of Nui atoll, whose inhabitants speak a dialect of the Gilbertese language (with the exception of small children, most Tuvaluans from Nui also speak Tuvaluan). With this exception, Tuvaluan is universally understood and spoken in Tuvalu. English is also spoken, especially in Tuvalu&#x27;s capital, and is one of the official languages of the central government.

==History==

The mythical history of Nanumea describes a settlement led by an explorer/adventurer and warrior from the south named Tefolaha. Some accounts say Tefolaha and his crew came from Tonga, others name Samoa, but whether these names refer to today&#x27;s Tonga and Samoa is not certain. Tefolaha, traditional accounts say, found the island of Nanumea populated by two women, Pai and Vau, whom it was believed had formed it from baskets of sand. Tefolaha wagered with them for the island and eventually won it through trickery, whereupon Pai and Vau departed. Tefolaha&#x27;s sons and daughters are today the founding ancestors of leading families and the seven chiefly lineages of Nanumea. Today&#x27;s population also traces descent from crew members who arrived with Tefolaha, and from later visitors from the far distant and more recent past. Nanumean traditions describe the islets, Motu Foliki, Lafogaki and Te Afua-a-Taepoa, as being formed when sand spilled from the baskets of two women, Pai and Vau, when they were forced off Nanumea by Tefolaha. After a careless fisherman accidentally tossed a fish hook into the eye of Lupo, a Tongan prince, the Tongans would send a raid party, led by a giant, to Nanumea. One of Tefolaha&#x27;s descendants, Lapi would use the Kaumaile to slay the giant Tuulapoupou on Nanumea&#x27;s southwestern reef flat. While doing this, Lapi had to call the spirit of Tefolaha for help, via saying the phrase, &quot;Tefolaha tou hoa!&quot;

The legendary, miraculous spear Kaumaile came with the hero Tefolaha to Nanumea. He fought with a long weapon on the islands of Samoa and Tonga. As Tefolaha died, &quot;Kaumaile&quot; went to his heirs, then to his heirs and on and on - 23 generations. The wood from the spear was radiocarbon dated to 880 years BP or AD 1070. The wood is from the species Casuarina equisetifolia.

The first recorded sighting of Nanumea by Europeans was by Spanish naval officer Francisco Mourelle de la Rúa who sailed past it on 5 May 1781 with frigate &quot;La Princesa&quot;, when attempting a southern crossing of the Pacific from the Philippines to New Spain. He charted Nanumea as &quot;San Augustin&quot;. In 1809, Captain Patterson in the brig &quot;Elizabeth&quot; sighted Nanumea while passing through the northern Tuvalu waters on a trading voyage from Port Jackson, Sydney, Australia to China.

From 1879 to 1881 Alfred Restieaux was the resident trader on Nanumea. 19th century resident Palagi traders also included: Tom Day (c.1872), Edmund Duffy (from 1890-c.1895), and Jack Buckland (c.1895). The population of Nanumea from 1860 to 1900 is estimated to be between 500 and 650 people.

Nanumea Post Office opened around 1919.
Donald Gilbert Kennedy, the resident District Officer in the administration of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony from 1932 to 1938, describe the construction of &quot;paopao&quot; and of the variations of single-outrigger canoes that had been developed on Vaitupu and Nanumea.

During World War II the American forces built Nanumea Airfield and the people moved to live on Lakena. USS LST-203 was grounded on the reef at Nanumea on 2 October 1943 in order to land equipment. The rusting hull of the ship remains on the reef. The &#x27;American Passage&#x27; was blasted through the reef by a Naval Construction Battalion (Seabees), who were assisted by local divers. This passage improved access to Nanumea. B-24 Liberator aircraft of 30th Bombardment Group flew from Nanumea Airfield. After the war the airfield was dismantled and the land returned to its owners, however as the coral base was compacted to make the runway the land now provides poor ground for growing coconuts.

On Nanumea, tender boats, which go out to the inter-island ships, run through the &#x27;American Passage&#x27; and offload passengers and cargo at a small wharf within the protected lagoon.

==Governance and connection to other Nanumean communities==
Nanumea&#x27;s local government consists of a chiefly council (&quot;Falekaupule&quot;) representing the seven chiefly lines which trace descent from the founder, Tefolaha, or from other key settlers, and an elected high chief (Pulefenua). The island also elects and sends two representatives to the Tuvalu national parliament based in the capital, Funafuti.

While Nanumea atoll remains the homeland for all Nanumeans, there are increasingly large populations of Nanumean residents in the capital, Funafuti, in New Zealand (especially Auckland and Wellington), and in Australia and other Pacific locations. These expatriate populations are well-organized, have active elected leadership councils, and keep in close touch with doings in Nanumea itself.

==General election, 2024==
Ampelosa Manoa Tehulu and Timi Melei were re-elected to parliament at the 2024 general election.



==Identity==

Nanumean identity and pride is demonstrated in many ways, from the distinctive intonation pattern and vocabulary of its version of Tuvaluan to celebrations including its unique &quot;Po o Tefolaha,&quot; part of a long holiday covering Christmas, New Year and some weeks beyond. These &quot;Big Days&quot; (&quot;Po Lahi&quot;) celebrations, marked with noon feasts in the island&#x27;s community hall, the &quot;aahiga&quot; or &quot;maneapa&quot;, feature a marathon round of the competitive ball game Te ano, pitting the two village sides, Haumaefa and Lolua, against each other. On 8 January each year, the island&#x27;s conversion to Christianity over a century ago is commemorated in &quot; Te Po o Tefolaha,&quot; &quot;Tefolaha&#x27;s Day&quot;. &quot;Po Lahi&quot; is celebrated in Nanumea itself and by many Nanumean communities overseas, including those in Funafuti, Fiji, Auckland, Wellington, Tarawa, Australia and other locations.

A widely recognized symbol of Nanumean identity and unity is the fighting spear, &quot;Kaumaile.&quot; Said to have been brought with him by the island&#x27;s founder, Tefolaha, Kaumaile was used to defeat invaders to Nanumea, most notably by Lapi to defeat a giant, Tuulaapoupou. Recent carbon dating tests have shown that the Kaumaile spear is over 800 years old.

==Prominent local people==

Lady Naama Maheu Latasi (died 16 March 2012) was the first woman to be elected to the Parliament of Tuvalu, was elected from the constituency of Nanumea.

Maatia Toafa (born 1 May 1954) was the Prime Minister of Tuvalu 2004–2006 and represent Nanumea in the Parliament of Tuvalu from 2002 until the 2019 general election. He served as the Minister of Finance and Economic Development in the Sopoaga Ministry (2013-2019).

Willy Telavi (born 28 January 1954) was first elected to parliament in 2006 and was appointed Home Affairs Minister in the Government of Apisai Ielemia. He was re-elected in 2010 and became the Prime Minister of Tuvalu on 24 December 2010. His term as prime minister ended on 2 August 2013. He resigned from Parliament in August 2014.

<doc id="604797" wikidata="Q2412524" url="?curid=604797" title="Sir John Oldcastle">
<text>Sir John Oldcastle is an Elizabethan play about John Oldcastle, a controversial 14th-/15th-century rebel and Lollard who was seen by some of Shakespeare&#x27;s contemporaries as a proto-Protestant martyr.

==Publication==

The play was originally published anonymously in 1600 (Q1), printed by Valentine Simmes for the bookseller Thomas Pavier. In 1619, a new edition (Q2) carried an attribution to William Shakespeare. The diary of Philip Henslowe records that the play was written by Anthony Munday, Michael Drayton, Richard Hathwaye and Robert Wilson. (An entry in Henslowe&#x27;s Diary records a later payment to Drayton for a second part to the play, which has not survived; because of this fact, the extant play has sometimes been called &quot;Sir John Oldcastle, Part I&quot; or &quot;1 Sir John Oldcastle&quot;.)

In 1664, the play was one of the seven dramas added to the second impression of the Shakespeare Third Folio by publisher Philip Chetwinde.

==Historical figure==
Like other subjects of Elizabethan history plays, Sir John Oldcastle was an actual person, a soldier and Lollard dissenter who was hanged and burned for heresy and treason in 1417—thus earning himself a place in the seminal text of the Protestant Reformation in Tudor England, John Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Book of Martyrs&quot;. Oldcastle was also a minor character in the early Elizabethan history play the &quot;Famous Victories of Henry V&quot; (c. 1586?), which is generally thought to have been one of Shakespeare&#x27;s sources for his plays on Henry IV and Henry V.

==Shakespeare&#x27;s Oldcastle==
The genesis of &quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot; is crucially linked to the fact that when Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays premiered on stage in 1597–98, the character Sir John Falstaff was called Sir John Oldcastle. This is indicated by abundant external and internal evidence. The change of names, from &quot;Oldcastle&quot; to &quot;Falstaff&quot;, is mentioned in seventeenth-century works by Richard James (&quot;Epistle to Sir Harry Bourchier&quot;, c. 1625) and Thomas Fuller (&quot;Worthies of England,&quot; 1662). It is also indicated in details in the early texts of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. In the quarto text of &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; (1600), one of Falstaff&#x27;s speech prefixes in Act I, Scene ii is mistakenly left uncorrected, &quot;Old.&quot; instead of &quot;Falst.&quot; In III, ii,25–26 of the same play, Falstaff is said to have been a &quot;page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk&quot;—which was true of the historical Oldcastle. In &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, I, ii, 42, Prince Hal calls Falstaff &quot;my old lad of the castle&quot;. Iambic pentameter verse lines in both parts are irregular when using the name &quot;Falstaff&quot;, but correct with &quot;Oldcastle&quot;. Finally, there is the blatant disclaimer at the close of &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; that disassociates the two figures: &quot;for Oldcastle died [a] martyr, and this is not the man&quot; (Epilogue, 29–32).

There is even a hint that Falstaff was originally Oldcastle in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; too. When the First Folio and quarto texts of that play are compared, it appears that the joke in V,v,85–90 is that Oldcastle/Falstaff incriminates himself by calling out the first letter of his name, &quot;O, O, O!,&quot; when his fingertips are singed with candles—which of course works for &quot;Oldcastle&quot; but not &quot;Falstaff.&quot; There is also the &quot;castle&quot; reference in IV,v,6 of the same play. The name Falstaff was derived from Sir John Fastolf, who was also a historical person—allegedly a greedy and grasping individual, who had a (probably undeserved) reputation for cowardice at the Battle of Patay in 1429. Fastolf, however, died without descendants, making him safe for a playwright&#x27;s use. He had already appeared as a cowardly knight in Henry VI, part 1.

==The Lords Cobham==
The name change and the Epilogue disclaimer were required, it is generally thought, because of political pressure: the historical Oldcastle was not only a Protestant martyr, but a nobleman with powerful living descendants in Elizabethan England. These were the Lords Cobham: William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham (died 6 March 1597), was Warden of the Cinque Ports (1558–97), Knight of the Order of the Garter (1584), and member of the Privy Council (1586–97); his son Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham, was granted the paternal post of Warden of the Cinque Ports upon his father&#x27;s death, and made a Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1599. Even more so, Frances Brooke, the 10th Baron&#x27;s wife and 11th Baron&#x27;s mother, was a close personal favorite of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I (an Elizabethan could not have been more or better connected than the Cobhams).

The elder Lord Cobham even had a strong negative impact upon the lives of Shakespeare and his contemporaries in the theater. The company of actors formed by Shakespeare, Richard Burbage, Will Kempe and the others in 1594 enjoyed the patronage of Henry Carey, first Lord Hunsdon, then serving as Lord Chamberlain; they were, famously, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men. When Carey died on 22 July 1596, the post of Lord Chamberlain was given to William Brooke, Lord Cobham, who definitely was not a friend to the players, and who withdrew what official protection they had enjoyed. The players were left to the mercies of the local officials of the City of London, who had long wanted to drive the companies of actors out of the City. Thomas Nashe, in a contemporary letter, complained that the actors were &quot;piteously persecuted by the Lord Mayor and the aldermen&quot; during this period. This did not last; when Cobham died less than a year later, the post of Lord Chamberlain went to Henry Carey&#x27;s son George, second Lord Hunsdon, and the actors regained their previous patronage.

Soon after the premier of Shakespeare&#x27;s Oldcastle/Falstaff in 1597–98, literary and dramatic works began to appear that defended the reputation of the historical Oldcastle; scholars argue that the muse that inspired these works was Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham. In 1601 a narrative poem, &quot;The Mirror of Martyrs,&quot; by one John Weever, was published; it praises Oldcastle as a &quot;valiant captain and most godly martyr.&quot; And two years earlier, in 1599, the play &quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot; was performed by the Admiral&#x27;s Men, the main theatrical rivals of Shakespeare&#x27;s company. Curiously, this effort to redeem the Oldcastle name was at best only partially successful; allusions to the Falstaff character under the name of Oldcastle continued to appear in succeeding years—in Nathan Field&#x27;s play &quot;Amends for Ladies&quot; (1618) and in the anonymous pamphlets &quot;The Meeting of Gallants at an Ordinary&quot; (1604) and &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; (c. 1628), among other works.

&quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot; treats its subject matter in ways acceptable to the values and biases of its audience, and the interests of Elizabethan officialdom (inevitably; if it did anything else it would never have escaped censorship). Oldcastle is a religious but not a political dissenter; his quarrel is with the Roman Catholic Church, and he remains loyal to the Crown and to Henry V personally (II, iii). The villain of the piece is the Bishop of Rochester, aided by his summoner Clun. The same cast of rebels and conspirators is active in this play (II, ii, III, ii, etc.) as in &quot;Henry V,&quot; but Oldcastle keeps scrupulously separate from them. The play offers a comic character, Sir John of Wrotham, a pale imitation of Falstaff, who interacts with a disguised Henry V (III, iv) much as in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. The later scenes are devoted to Rochester&#x27;s pursuit of Oldcastle and his wife, and their escapes; the play ends on a temporary positive note, with the Oldcastles evading imprisonment. (Presumably, the lost second half of the play would have had the inevitable grimmer ending of Oldcastle&#x27;s grisly death.)

<text>Joule heating (also known as resistive heating, resistance heating, or Ohmic heating) is the process by which the passage of an electric current through a conductor produces heat.

Joule&#x27;s first law (also just Joule&#x27;s law), also known in countries of the former USSR as the Joule–Lenz law, states that the power of heating generated by an electrical conductor equals the product of its resistance and the square of the current. Joule heating affects the whole electric conductor, unlike the Peltier effect which transfers heat from one electrical junction to another.

Joule-heating or resistive-heating is used in many devices and industrial processes. The part that converts electricity into heat is called a heating element.

Among the applications are:

* Buildings are often heated with electric heaters where grid power is available.
*Electric stoves and ovens use Joule heating to cook food. 
* Soldering irons generate heat to melt conductive solder and make electrical connections. 
* Cartridge heaters are used in various manufacturing processes. 
* Electric fuses are used as a safety device, breaking a circuit by melting if enough current flows to heat them to the melting point.
* Electronic cigarettes vaporize liquid by Joule heating.
* Some food processing equipment may make use of Joule heating: running a current through food material (which behave as an electrical resistor) causes heat release inside the food. The alternating electrical current coupled with the resistance of the food causes the generation of heat. A higher resistance increases the heat generated. Ohmic heating allows for fast and uniform heating of food products, which maintains quality. Products with particulates heat up faster (compared to conventional heat processing) due to higher resistance.

== History ==
James Prescott Joule first published in December 1840, an abstract in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot;, suggesting that heat could be generated by an electrical current. Joule immersed a length of wire in a fixed mass of water and measured the temperature rise due to a known current flowing through the wire for a 30 minute period. By varying the current and the length of the wire he deduced that the heat produced was proportional to the square of the current multiplied by the electrical resistance of the immersed wire.

In 1841 and 1842, subsequent experiments showed that the amount of heat generated was proportional to the chemical energy used in the voltaic pile that generated the template. This led Joule to reject the caloric theory (at that time the dominant theory) in favor of the mechanical theory of heat (according to which heat is another form of energy).

Resistive heating was independently studied by Heinrich Lenz in 1842.

The SI unit of energy was subsequently named the joule and given the symbol &quot;J&quot;. The commonly known unit of power, the watt, is equivalent to one joule per second.

== Microscopic description ==
Joule heating is caused by interactions between charge carriers (usually electrons) and the body of the conductor.

A potential difference (voltage) between two points of a conductor creates an electric field that accelerates charge carriers in the direction of the electric field, giving them kinetic energy. When the charged particles collide with the quasi-particles in the conductor (i.e. the canonically quantized, ionic lattice oscillations in the harmonic approximation of a crystal), energy is being transferred from the electrons to the lattice (by the creation of further lattice oscillations). The oscillations of the ions are the origin of the radiation (&quot;thermal energy&quot;) that one measures in a typical experiment.

== Power loss and noise ==

Joule heating is referred to as &quot;ohmic heating&quot; or &quot;resistive heating&quot; because of its relationship to Ohm&#x27;s Law. It forms the basis for the large number of practical applications involving electric heating. However, in applications where heating is an unwanted by-product of current use (e.g., load losses in electrical transformers) the diversion of energy is often referred to as &quot;resistive loss&quot;. The use of high voltages in electric power transmission systems is specifically designed to reduce such losses in cabling by operating with commensurately lower currents. The ring circuits, or ring mains, used in UK homes are another example, where power is delivered to outlets at lower currents (per wire, by using two paths in parallel), thus reducing Joule heating in the wires. Joule heating does not occur in superconducting materials, as these materials have zero electrical resistance in the superconducting state.

Resistors create electrical noise, called Johnson–Nyquist noise. There is an intimate relationship between Johnson–Nyquist noise and Joule heating, explained by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

== Formulas ==

=== Direct current ===

The most fundamental formula for Joule heating is the generalized power equation:
formula_1
where
* formula_2 is the power (energy per unit time) converted from electrical energy to thermal energy,
* formula_3 is the current travelling through the resistor or other element,
* formula_4 is the voltage drop across the element.

The explanation of this formula (formula_5) is:

Assuming the element behaves as a perfect resistor and that the power is completely converted into heat, the formula can be re-written by substituting Ohm&#x27;s law, formula_6, into the generalized power equation:
formula_7
where &quot;R&quot; is the resistance.

Voltage can be increased in DC circuits by connecting batteries or solar panels in series.

=== Alternating current ===
When current varies, as it does in AC circuits,

formula_8

where &quot;t&quot; is time and &quot;P&quot; is the instantaneous active power being converted from electrical energy to heat. Far more often, the &quot;average&quot; power is of more interest than the instantaneous power:

formula_9

where &quot;avg&quot; denotes average (mean) over one or more cycles, and &quot;rms&quot; denotes root mean square.

These formulas are valid for an ideal resistor, with zero reactance. If the reactance is nonzero, the formulas are modified:

formula_10

where formula_11 is phase difference between current and voltage, formula_12 means real part, &quot;Z&quot; is the complex impedance, and &quot;Y*&quot; is the complex conjugate of the admittance (equal to 1/&quot;Z*&quot;).

For more details in the reactive case, see AC power.

=== Differential form ===

Joule heating can also be calculated at a particular location in space. The differential form of the Joule heating equation gives the power per unit volume.

formula_13

Here, formula_14 is the current density, and formula_15 is the electric field. For a material with a conductivity formula_16, formula_17 and therefore
formula_18

where formula_19 is the resistivity. This directly resembles the &quot;formula_20&quot; term of the macroscopic form.

In the harmonic case, where all field quantities vary with the angular frequency formula_21 as formula_22, complex valued phasors formula_23 and formula_24 are usually introduced for the current density and the electric field intensity, respectively. The Joule heating then reads
formula_25
where formula_26 denotes the complex conjugate.

== Electricity transmission ==
Overhead power lines transfer electrical energy from electricity producers to consumers. Those power lines have a nonzero resistance and therefore are subject to Joule heating, which causes transmission losses.

The split of power between transmission losses (Joule heating in transmission lines) and load (useful energy delivered to the consumer) can be approximated by a voltage divider. In order to minimize transmission losses, the resistance of the lines has to be as small as possible compared to the load (resistance of consumer appliances). Line resistance is minimized by the use of copper conductors, but the resistance and power supply specifications of consumer appliances are fixed.

Usually, a transformer is placed between the lines and consumption. When a high-voltage, low-intensity current in the primary circuit (before the transformer) is converted into a low-voltage, high-intensity current in the secondary circuit (after the transformer), the equivalent resistance of the secondary circuit becomes higher and transmission losses are reduced in proportion.

During the war of currents, AC installations could use transformers to reduce line losses by Joule heating, at the cost of higher voltage in the transmission lines, compared to DC installations.

== Applications ==

=== Food processing ===
Joule heating is a flash pasteurization (also called &quot;high-temperature short-time&quot; (HTST)) aseptic process that runs an alternating current of 50–60 Hz through food. Heat is generated through the food&#x27;s electrical resistance. As the product heats, electrical conductivity increases linearly. A higher electrical current frequency is best as it reduces oxidation and metallic contamination. This heating method is best for foods that contain particulates suspended in a weak salt-containing medium due to their high resistance properties.

Heat is generated rapidly and uniformly in the liquid matrix as well as in particulates, producing a higher quality sterile product that is suitable for aseptic processing.

Electrical energy is linearly translated to thermal energy as electrical conductivity increases, and this is the key process parameter that affects heating uniformity and heating rate. This heating method is best for foods that contain particulates suspended in a weak salt containing medium due to their high resistance properties. Ohmic heating is beneficial due to its ability to inactivate microorganisms through thermal and non-thermal cellular damage.

This method can also inactivate antinutritional factors thereby maintaining nutritional and sensory properties. However, ohmic heating is limited by viscosity, electrical conductivity, and fouling deposits. Although ohmic heating has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for commercial use, this method has many potential applications, ranging from cooking to fermentation.

There are different configurations for continuous ohmic heating systems, but in the most basic process, a power supply or generator is needed to produce electrical current. Electrodes, in direct contact with food, pass electric current through the matrix. The distance between the electrodes can be adjusted to achieve the optimum electrical field strength.

The generator creates the electrical current which flows to the first electrode and passes through the food product placed in the electrode gap. The food product resists the flow of current causing internal heating. The current continues to flow to the second electrode and back to the power source to close the circuit. The insulator caps around the electrodes controls the environment within the system.

The electrical field strength and the residence time are the key process parameters which affect heat generation.

The ideal foods for ohmic heating are viscous with particulates.

* Thick soups
* Sauces
* Stews
* Salsa
* Fruit in a syrup medium
* Milk
* Ice cream mix
* Egg
* Whey
* Heat sensitive liquids
* Soymilk

The efficiency by which electricity is converted to heat depends upon on salt, water, and fat content due to their thermal conductivity and resistance factors. In particulate foods, the particles heat up faster than the liquid matrix due to higher resistance to electricity and matching conductivity can contribute to uniform heating. This prevents overheating of the liquid matrix while particles receive sufficient heat processing. Table 1 shows the electrical conductivity values of certain foods to display the effect of composition and salt concentration. The high electrical conductivity values represent a larger number of ionic compounds suspended in the product, which is directly proportional to the rate of heating. This value is increased in the presence of polar compounds, like acids and salts, but decreased with nonpolar compounds, like fats. Electrical conductivity of food materials generally increases with temperature, and can change if there are structural changes caused during heating such as gelatinization of starch. Density, pH, and specific heat of various components in a food matrix can also influence heating rate.

Benefits of Ohmic heating include: uniform and rapid heating (&gt;1°Cs−1), less cooking time, better energy efficiency, lower capital cost, and heating simulataneously throughout food&#x27;s volume as compared to aseptic processing, canning, and PEF. Volumetric heating allows internal heating instead of transferring heat from a secondary medium. This results in the production of safe, high quality food with minimal changes to structural, nutritional, and organoleptic properties of food. Heat transfer is uniform to reach areas of food that are harder to heat. Less fouling accumulates on the electrodes as compared to other heating methods. Ohmic heating also requires less cleaning and maintenance, resulting in an environmentally cautious heating method.

Microbial inactivation in ohmic heating is achieved by both thermal and non-thermal cellular damage from the electrical field. This method destroys microorganisms due to electroporation of cell membranes, physical membrane rupture, and cell lysis. In electroporation, excessive leakage of ions and intramolecular components results in cell death. In membrane rupture, cells swell due to an increase in moisture diffusion across the cell membrane. Pronounced disruption and decomposition of cell walls and cytoplasmic membranes causes cells to lyse.

Decreased processing times in ohmic heating maintains nutritional and sensory properties of foods. Ohmic heating inactivates antinutritional factors like lipoxigenase (LOX), polyphenoloxidase (PPO), and pectinase due to the removal of active metallic groups in enzymes by the electrical field. Similar to other heating methods, ohmic heating causes gelatinization of starches, melting of fats, and protein agglutination. Water-soluble nutrients are maintained in the suspension liquid allowing for no loss of nutritional value if the liquid is consumed.

Ohmic heating is limited by viscosity, electrical conductivity, and fouling deposits. The density of particles within the suspension liquid can limit the degree of processing. A higher viscosity fluid will provide more resistance to heating, allowing the mixture to heat up quicker than low viscosity products. A food product&#x27;s electrical conductivity is a function of temperature, frequency, and product composition. This may be increased by adding ionic compounds, or decreased by adding non-polar constituents. Changes in electrical conductivity limit ohmic heating as it is difficult to model the thermal process when temperature increases in multi-component foods.

The potential applications of ohmic heating range from cooking, thawing, blanching, peeling, evaporation, extraction, dehydration, and fermentation. These allow for ohmic heating to pasteurize particulate foods for hot filling, pre-heat products prior to canning, and aseptically process ready-to-eat meals and refrigerated foods. Prospective examples are outlined in Table 2 as this food processing method has not been commercially approved by the FDA. Since there is currently insufficient data on electrical conductivities for solid foods, it is difficult to prove the high quality and safe process design for ohmic heating. Additionally, a successful 12D reduction for &quot;C. botulinum&quot; prevention has yet to be validated.

=== Materials synthesis, recovery and processing ===

Flash joule heating (transient high-temperature electrothermal heating) has been used to synthesize allotropes of carbon, including graphene and diamond. Heating various solid carbon feedstocks (carbon black, coal, coffee grounds, etc.) to temperatures of ~3000 K for 10-150 milliseconds produces turbostratic graphene flakes. FJH has also been used to recover rare-earth elements used in modern electronics from industrial wastes. Beginning from a fluorinated carbon source, fluorinated activated carbon, fluorinated nanodiamond, concentric carbon (carbon shell around a nanodiamond core), and fluorinated flash graphene can be synthesized.

== Heating efficiency ==
Heat is not to be confused with internal energy or synonymously thermal energy. While intimately connected to heat, they are distinct physical quantities.

As a heating technology, Joule heating has a coefficient of performance of 1.0, meaning that every joule of electrical energy supplied produces one joule of heat. In contrast, a heat pump can have a coefficient of more than 1.0 since it moves additional thermal energy from the environment to the heated item.

The definition of the efficiency of a heating process requires defining the boundaries of the system to be considered. When heating a building, the overall efficiency is different when considering heating effect per unit of electric energy delivered on the customer&#x27;s side of the meter, compared to the overall efficiency when also considering the losses in the power plant and transmission of power.

== Hydraulic equivalent ==
In the energy balance of groundwater flow a hydraulic equivalent of Joule&#x27;s law is used:

formula_27

where:

* formula_28 = loss of hydraulic energy (formula_29) due to friction of flow in formula_30-direction per unit of time (m/day), comparable to formula_2
* formula_32 = flow velocity in formula_30-direction (m/day), comparable to formula_3
* formula_35 = hydraulic conductivity of the soil (m/day), the hydraulic conductivity is inversely proportional to the hydraulic resistance which compares to formula_36

Harbaugh came to NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center after graduation from Purdue University in 1978. He held engineering and technical management positions in Space Shuttle flight operations, and supported Shuttle flight operations from Mission Control for most of the flights from STS-1 through STS-51-L. He served as Lead Data Processing Systems (DPS) Officer for STS-9 (Spacelab-1) and STS-41-D, Orbit DPS for STS-41-B and STS-41-C, and Ascent/Entry DPS for STS-41-G. He also served as a senior flight controller addressing issues requiring real-time resolution, for several flights from STS-51-A through STS-51-L.

Harbaugh has a commercial pilot&#x27;s license with instrument rating, and over 1600 hours total flying time.

Selected by NASA in June 1987, Harbaugh became an astronaut in August 1988. His technical assignments included work in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (RMS), telerobotics systems development for Space Station, the Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission development, spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control, and extravehicular activity (EVA) for the International Space Station (ISS). He was assigned as the backup EVA crew member and capsule communicator (Capcom) for STS-61, the first Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission.

A veteran of four space flights, Harbaugh has logged a total of 818 hours in space, including 18 hours, 29 minutes EVA. From 1997 to 2001 Harbaugh served as Manager of the Extravehicular Activity Project Office, with program management responsibility for all aspects of NASA&#x27;s spacewalk industry, including spacesuits, tools, training, tasks and operations for the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station, and future planetary missions. Harbaugh left NASA in March 2001.

=== Space flight experience ===
====STS-39====
STS-39 &quot;Discovery&quot; (April 28 through May 6, 1991) was an eight-day unclassified Department of Defense mission involving research for the Strategic Defense Initiative. Harbaugh flew as a mission specialist and was responsible for operation of the RMS and the Infrared Background Signature Survey (IBSS) spacecraft, and he was one of two crewmen trained for EVA in the event of a contingency requiring a spacewalk. Mission duration was 199 hours, 22 minutes.

====STS-54====

STS-54 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (January 13–19, 1993) was a six-day mission which featured the deployment of TDRS-F, and a 4-hour 28-minute space walk by Harbaugh. Mission duration was 143 hours 38 minutes.

====STS-71====
STS-71 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (June 27 to July 7, 1995) was the first docking mission with the Russian Space Station Mir, and involved an exchange of crews. On this mission, Harbaugh served as the Flight Engineer (Mission Specialist) on a seven-member (up) eight-member (down) crew. Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; was modified to carry a docking system compatible with the Russian Mir Space Station, and Harbaugh was responsible for the inflight operation of the docking system. He was also assigned to perform any contingency EVA. Mission duration was 235 hours, 23 minutes.

====STS-82====
STS-82 &quot;Discovery&quot; (February 11–21, 1997) the second Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission. It was a night launch and landing flight. During the 10-day mission, the crew retrieved and secured the HST in &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s payload bay. In five spacewalks, two teams installed two new spectrometers and eight replacement instruments, and placed insulation patches over several compartments containing key data processing, electronics and scientific instrument telemetry packages. Harbaugh participated in two spacewalks, totaling 14 hours and 01 minute. Following completion of upgrades and repairs, HST was redeployed and boosted to its highest orbit ever. Mission duration was 239 hours, 37 minutes.

<text>Bernard Anthony Harris Jr. (born June 26, 1956) is a former NASA astronaut. On February 9, 1995, Harris became the first African American to perform an extra-vehicular activity (spacewalk), during the second of his two Space Shuttle flights.

== Early life ==
Harris was born on June 26, 1956 in Temple, Texas. His parents were Bernard A. Harris, Sr. and Gussie Emanual Harris. His parents divorced when he was six years old and seeing his father, who had only a tenth grade education, struggle to find work inspired Harris to pursue STEM.

Harris first became interested in being an astronaut after watching the Apollo 11 mission on TV in 1969 at 13 years old. With the help of his science teacher, he formed a science club and a rocket club with some other students.

==Education==
Harris graduated from Sam Houston High School in San Antonio, Texas, in 1974, where he was actively involved in science fairs, book clubs and other school activities. He received a B.S. degree in biology from University of Houston in 1978. He earned his MD degree from Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Medicine in 1982. Harris completed a residency in internal medicine at the Mayo Clinic in 1985. Harris is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

Harris completed a National Research Council Fellowship at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center in 1987. While at Ames, he conducted research in musculature physiology and disuse.

He also trained as a flight surgeon at the Aerospace School of Medicine at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio in 1988. Dr. Harris received a master&#x27;s degree in biomedical science from The University of Texas Medical Branch in 1996, and an MBA from the University of Houston (1999). Harris is also a licensed private pilot and certified scuba diver.

After completing his fellowship at NASA Ames, he joined NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center as a clinical scientist and flight surgeon, where he conducted clinical investigations of space adaptation and developed countermeasures for extended duration space flight.

He was the first African American man to go in space as one of NASA&#x27;s research teams and he was involved in the construction of the space rovers.

==Astronaut experience==
Selected by NASA in January 1990, Harris became an astronaut in July 1991, and qualified for assignment as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. He served as the crew representative for Shuttle Software in the Astronaut Office Operations Development Branch. Harris was assigned as a mission specialist on STS-55, Spacelab D-2, in August 1991. He flew on board Columbia for ten days, (26 April 1993 – 6 May 1993); on the mission the Shuttle reached one year of accumulated flight time. Harris was part of the payload crew of Spacelab D-2, conducting a variety of research in physical and life sciences. During this flight, Harris logged over 239 hours and 4,164,183 miles in space.

His second mission was as the payload commander on STS-63 ( February 2, 1995 – February 11, 1995), the first flight of the new joint Russian-American Space Program. Mission highlights included the first rendezvous (but not docking) with the Russian space station Mir and retrieval of Spartan 204 satellite. During the flight, Harris became the first African-American to walk in space, while fellow astronaut Michael Foale became the first British-born spacewalker. (It was also on this flight that Eileen Collins became the first female Shuttle pilot.) On this mission, Harris logged 198 hours, 29 minutes in space, completed 129 orbits, and traveled over 2.9 million miles.

==Post-NASA career==
Harris left NASA in April 1996, but has continued research. He served as Vice President of SPACEHAB, Inc., and innovative space commercialization company, where he directed the company&#x27;s space science business. He also served as Vice President of Business Development for Space Media, Inc., an Informatics company, establishing an e-commerce initiative that is now part of the United Nations&#x27; education program.

In 1998, he founded The Harris Foundation, a Houston, Texas-based non-profit organization, whose stated mission is &quot;to invest in community-based initiatives to support education, health and wealth. THF supports programs that empower individuals, in particular minorities and other economically and/or socially disadvantaged, to recognize their potential and pursue their dreams.&quot;

In 2008, he appeared in Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a P.C.&quot; ad campaign. Harris also gave a keynote speech at the Exxon Mobil Texas State Science and Engineering Fair.

In 2009, he was elected vice president of the American Telemedicine Association. He was elected president of the American Telemedicine Association in 2011, serving for a one-year term that ended in 2012.

In 2010, he was part of the Dream Tour where he travelled to over 30 schools around the country.

Currently, Harris is CEO of the National Math and Science Initiative and president and chief executive officer of Vesalius Ventures, Inc., a venture capital accelerator, that invests in early-stage companies in medical informatics and technology.

As of April 19, 2021, Harris serves on the board of directors for commercial aerospace and weapons manufacturer Raytheon Technologies.

<doc id="604804" wikidata="Q618858" url="?curid=604804" title="Apocalypse of Adam">
<text>The Apocalypse of Adam is a Sethian Gnostic apocalyptic writing. It is the fifth tractate in Codex V of the Nag Hammadi library, transcribed in Coptic. The date of the original work has been a point of scholarly contention because the writing lacks Christian themes and other explicit allusions. Thus, the Gnostic redeemer in the text may have been pre-Christian and influenced later New Testament writings. The text provides an interpretation of the Genesis account of creation, describes the descent of a heavenly illuminator of knowledge, and ends with an apocalyptic prophecy.

==Summary==
Adam teaches his son Seth about his past, saying that he and Eve were created by the god Sakla out of the earth, but they were once with the eternal God and like great eternal angels. They were divided by Sakla in wrath, causing the glory in their hearts to leave them, and they lost the first knowledge that breathed in them. They recognized the god who created them and served him in fear and slavery. Adam and Eve are awakened by three persons, who help them remember the eternal being and the seed of the person to whom life has come (Seth). Adam tells Seth that he will reveal to him what he learned from the three.

A flood destroys all flesh on Earth except for those on Noah&#x27;s Ark. Sakla gives the Earth to Noah and his sons to rule over in kingly fashion. Some people, sent from the knowledge of great eternal realms and angels, defy Sakla and live in knowledge of incorruptibility. Noah then divides the Earth among his sons Ham, Japheth and Shem and warns them to serve Sakla in fear and slavery. The seed of Ham and Japheth forms twelve kingdoms. Sakla again tries to destroy the pure who know of the eternal God. Fire, sulfur, and blinding mist come over the realms, and the inhabitants cannot see. But great clouds of light descend, and Abrasax, Sablo, and Gamaliel come to rescue the people and take them to the eternal realms where they will be like angels.

The illuminator of knowledge saves the pure for the third time, leaving Sakla disturbed and wondering where the higher power comes from. 13 different kingdoms each have their own belief about the origin of the illuminator. Douglas M. Parrott argues that this section was originally an independent work that is influenced by the author&#x27;s Egyptian surroundings:

#The first kingdom believes that he came from a spirit.
#The second kingdom believes that he came from a great prophet.
#The third kingdom believes that he came from a virgin womb and was brought to a desert place.
#The fourth kingdom believes that he came from a virgin who was sought by Solomon and his armies.
#The fifth kingdom believes that he came from a drop from heaven and was thrown into the sea.
#The sixth kingdom believes that he was born of a woman who became pregnant from the desire of flowers.
#The seventh kingdom believes that he is a drop that came from heaven to earth and was brought up by dragons.
#The eighth kingdom believes that he came from a cloud that enveloped a rock.
#The ninth kingdom believes that he was born of a muse who became pregnant from her own desire.
#The tenth kingdom believes that he was born of a cloud of desire that his god loved.
#The eleventh kingdom believes that he was cast out in the desert by his mother and was nourished by an angel.
#The twelfth kingdom believes that he came from two luminaries.
#The thirteenth kingdom believes that every birth of their ruler is a word, and this word received a mandate.

However, the generation without a king believes that God chose him from all the eternal realms.

The text concludes with a prophecy about a group of people who will fight against the power and be covered by a cloud of darkness. The people who do not follow the power and have a knowledge of the truth will be blessed and live forever. The text then criticizes those who have followed the power and defiled the water of life, saying their works are not of the truth. The people who follow the truth will be known up to the great eternal realms, and their words will be called words of incorruptibility and truth. The holy baptism is described as being of the eternal knowledge through those born of the word and the imperishable illuminators, who came from the holy seed Yesseus Mazareus Yessedekeus.

As a flight test engineer, Helms has flown in 30 different types of U.S. and Canadian military aircraft.

In 2013, Helms was nominated by President Barack Obama to become vice commander of the Air Force Space Command. Senator Claire McCaskill placed a permanent hold on the nomination because Helms had dismissed a charge of a sexual assault and punished the accused on a lesser charge leading to his dismissal from the USAF, in her role as the General Court-Martial Convening Authority, who is required to review all findings. As Helms&#x27;s lawyer explained, Helms felt the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Obama eventually withdrew Helms&#x27;s nomination and she retired from the Air Force in 2014.

==Spaceflight experience==

Selected by NASA in January 1990, Helms became an astronaut in July 1991. She flew on STS-54 (1993), STS-64 (1994), STS-78 (1996), STS-101 (2000) and served aboard the International Space Station as a member of the &quot;ISS Expedition 2&quot; crew (2001). A veteran of five space flights, Helms logged 5,064 hours in space, including an EVA of 8 hours and 56 minutes (world record).

STS-54 &quot;Endeavour&quot;, January 13–19, 1993. The primary objective of this mission was the deployment of a $200-million NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-F). A diffuse X-ray spectrometer (DXS) carried in the payload bay, collected over 80,000 seconds of quality X-ray data that will enable investigators to answer questions about the origin of the Milky Way galaxy. The crew demonstrated the physics principles of everyday toys to an interactive audience of elementary school students across the United States. A highly successful extra-vehicular activity (EVA) resulted in many lessons learned that will benefit International Space Station assembly. Mission duration was 5 days, 23 hours, 38 minutes, 17 seconds.
STS-64 &quot;Discovery&quot;, September 9–20, 1994. On this flight, Helms served as the flight engineer for orbiter operations and the primary RMS operator aboard Space Shuttle. The major objective of this flight was to validate the design and operating characteristics of Lidar in Space Technology Experiment (LITE) by gathering data about the Earth&#x27;s troposphere and stratosphere. Additional objectives included the deploy and retrieval of SPARTAN-201, a free-flying satellite that investigated the physics of the solar corona, and the testing of a new EVA maneuvering device. The Shuttle Plume Impingement Flight Experiment (SPIFEX) was used to collect extensive data on the effects of jet thruster impingement, in preparation for proximity tasks such as space station docking. Mission duration was 10 days, 22 hours, 51 minutes.

STS-78 &quot;Columbia&quot;, June 20 to July 7, 1996, Helms was the payload commander and flight engineer aboard &quot;Columbia&quot;, on the longest Space Shuttle mission to date (later that year the STS-80 mission broke its record by nineteen hours). The mission included studies sponsored by ten nations and five space agencies, and was the first mission to combine both a full microgravity studies agenda and a comprehensive life science investigation. The Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission served as a model for future studies on board the International Space Station. Mission duration was 16 days, 21 hours, 48 minutes.

STS-101 &quot;Atlantis&quot;, May 19–29, 2000, was a mission dedicated to the delivery and repair of critical hardware for the International Space Station. Helms’s prime responsibilities during this mission were to perform critical repairs to extend the life of the Functional Cargo Block (FGB). In addition, she had prime responsibility of the onboard computer network and served as the mission specialist for rendezvous with the ISS. Mission duration was 9 days, 20 hours and 9 minutes.

Expedition 2 March 8 to August 22, 2001, was a mission to the International Space Station and Helms was a member of the second crew to inhabit the International Space Station Alpha. The &quot;Expedition 2&quot; crew (two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut) launched on March 8, 2001, on board STS-102 &quot;Discovery&quot; and successfully docked with the station on March 9, 2001. The &quot;Expedition 2&quot; crew installed and conducted tests on the Canadian-made Space Station Robotic arm (SSRMS), conducted internal and external maintenance tasks (Russian and American), in addition to medical and science experiments. During her stay on board, Helms installed the airlock (brought up on the STS-104 mission) using the SSRM. She and her crewmates also performed a &#x27;fly around&#x27; of the Russian &quot;Soyuz&quot; spacecraft and welcomed the visiting Soyuz crew that included the first space tourist, Dennis Tito. On March 11 she performed a world-record 8 hour and 56 minute spacewalk to install hardware to the external body of the laboratory module, that stood until 17 December 2024, when Cai Xuzhe broke the record with Song Lingdong for the longest spacewalk in human history, of 9 hours and 6 minutes. Helms spent a total of 163 days aboard the space station. She returned to Earth with the STS-105 crew aboard &quot;Discovery&quot; on August 22, 2001.

==Awards and decorations==

Helms was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 2004. She was inducted into the Colorado Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2018.

<doc id="604817" wikidata="Q4796193" url="?curid=604817" title="Arrowhead Water">
<text>Arrowhead Water, also known as Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water, is a brand of drinking water that is sold in the Western United States, particularly in Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and California. It is bottled from 13 springs throughout the Western United States.

==Discovery==
Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water takes its name from a natural mark in the San Bernardino Mountains that is shaped like a giant arrowhead. The arrowhead is naturally barren; it is not manicured in any way. Nearby cold springs on Strawberry Creek in the San Bernardino National Forest are the original source and namesake of Arrowhead water.

The first documented reference by Europeans to Arrowhead springs (Agua Caliente) was in records of priests stationed at Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, around 1820. David Noble Smith was the founder of the first sanitarium facilities at Arrowhead Springs in 1863, which were used to treat patients with tuberculosis and numerous other ailments. By the 1880s, the Arrowhead waters were famous for their supposed curing powers. By the early 20th century, the hot springs were a popular resort for tourism and vacationing.

== History ==
In 1909, the Arrowhead Springs Company was formed and the company&#x27;s water products were marketed in Southern California. The water was transported from Arrowhead Springs, north of San Bernardino, California, to Los Angeles in glass-lined railroad tank cars. In 1917, the bottling operations moved to a new plant in Los Angeles. In 1929, the Arrowhead Springs Company merged with the company that marketed Puritas water, and began co-marketing the Puritas products with Arrowhead water. Puritas water products were first introduced in Los Angeles in 1894.

The Arrowhead and Puritas brands were bottled in the same plants and co-marketed until the 1970s. Arrowhead Springs marketed the brands in separate containers that sometimes carried the Arrowhead or Puritas names alone, but containers were often labeled &quot;Arrowhead and Puritas.&quot; The Arrowhead Beverage Company was the bottler for many different brands of water and soft drinks including seltzer, fruit-flavored soda, and ginger ale.

In 1932, another important development for the company happened in the Los Angeles area, as it was named the official water refreshment of that year&#x27;s Olympic Games, held at the &quot;City of the Stars&quot;. Arrowhead water returned to the Olympic Games again in 1984, when the games were again held in Los Angeles. In 1993, Arrowhead water bought the naming rights for the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim.

===The Nestlé era===

In 1987, Arrowhead waters was bought by Nestlé. Soon after, the presence of Arrowhead water bottles in supermarkets across the Western United States grew considerably.

In 1996, a bottle was introduced by the company. By the early 2000s, the company had introduced waters with different flavors to the market. &quot;It&#x27;s Better Up Here!&quot; is a trademarked tagline for the Arrowhead Water brand. In 2006, the label released Aquapod under the same brand umbrella.

Southern Californian newspaper &quot;The Desert Sun&quot; investigated Nestlé&#x27;s bottling activities in 2015 and published findings that the water company had been operating in the San Bernardino National Forest without a permit since its last one expired in 1988. Local activists and retired forest personnel began to organize opposition to the Swiss company&#x27;s continued withdrawal of water from a forest that is struggling from drought and bark beetles.

In December, 2017, the California Water Resources Control Board notified Nestlé that an investigation had concluded that the company does not have proper rights to about three-quarters of the water it withdraws for bottling, including water from the San Bernardino National Forest.

In April, 2021, California regulators moved to stop Nestlé from siphoning water from the forest.

On September 19, 2023, California regulators ordered the company to stop using a majority of the springs they&#x27;ve been relying upon for the past century. Regulators stated that the company does not have the water rights and that they have drained the creek to the point where it can&#x27;t sustain the wildlife that is dependent upon it.

===BlueTriton===
In early April 2021, Nestlé Waters&#x27; bottling operations in the United States were sold to One Rock Capital Partners LLC and Metropoulos &amp; Co. The unit rebranded to BlueTriton Brands, based in Stamford, Connecticut.

== 2023 ==
The label now reads as follows:
&quot;Proudly Sourced in British Columbia: 
Hope Springs, Hope B.C. Canada. 
Bottled for Bluetriton Brands Inc., Stamford CT.&quot;

<doc id="604818" wikidata="Q884654" url="?curid=604818" title="Blockout">
<text>Blockout is a puzzle video game published in 1989 by California Dreams. It was developed in Poland by Aleksander Ustaszewski and Mirosław Zabłocki. American Technos published an arcade version. &quot;Blockout&quot; is an unlicensed, 3D version of &quot;Tetris&quot;.

==Gameplay==

The player&#x27;s perspective is that of looking down into a three-dimensional rectangular pit. Polycube blocks of various shapes appear, one at a time, and fall slowly toward the bottom of the pit. The player can use three buttons to rotate the block around any of the three coordinate axes, and can also maneuver the block horizontally and vertically with the joystick. Once any part of a block comes to rest on the floor of the pit or in contact with an already-placed cube, the entire block freezes in place and can no longer be moved. The player can press a button on the joystick to quickly drop a block. Once a solid layer of cubes is formed with no gaps (a &quot;face&quot;), it disappears and all cubes above it drop toward the bottom of the pit to fill the space. Completing multiple faces with a single block awards higher scores, and the player earns a &quot;Block Out&quot; bonus for emptying the pit. A set number of faces must be completed in order to end each round.
As the game progresses, the blocks begin to drop faster, the dimensions of the pit change from round to round, and differently-shaped blocks start to appear. A bonus stage is played after every fifth round, in which the player has 30 seconds to form as many faces as possible in a 2x2 pit. The game ends if the blocks stack up to the top of the pit, with the exception of the bonus stages; in the latter case, the stage ends immediately and the player advances to the next round.

The game allows head-to-head competition between two players, each of whom has their own pit and blocks. When one player completes a face, all the cubes in the opponent&#x27;s pit are raised by one level. A player can win a round by either being the first to complete a set number of faces or by forcing their opponent&#x27;s cubes to stack up to the top of the pit. The first player to win a set number of rounds may continue the game alone in single-player mode.

==Ports==
Apart from the other known console ports of &quot;Blockout&quot;, there were also two for NES: the first is an official unreleased prototype developed in 1990 by Technos Japan Corp. under the name &quot;Block Out&quot;, while the second is an unauthorized clone programmed by Hwang Shinwei and published by both himself and RCM Group in 1989/1990 (titled &quot;3D Block&quot;).

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the game in an article about educational software for mathematics, writing that &quot;Blockout&quot; &quot;doesn&#x27;t pretend to be educational, but the skills required to master it are not unrelated to mathematics, particularly geometry.&quot; A 1993 study found evidence that playing Blockout improved the spatial visualization ability of 10- to 14-year-olds. 

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Block Out&quot; on their March 1, 1990 issue as being the tenth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

&quot;Dragon&quot; gave the game&#x27;s Atari Lynx version a perfect score. Robert A. Jung reviewed the Atari Lynx version of the game, which was published on &quot;IGN&quot;. In his final verdict, he wrote: &quot;This is a nice, addictive, no-nonsense strategy game. Without any patterns to memorize and several options to choose from, &quot;Blockout&quot; will keep its freshness for quite some time. If you thought &quot;Tetris&quot; was too simple, give this title a try.&quot; He scored the game eight out of ten.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the game an A, deeming it the #17 greatest game available in 1991.

==Legacy==
Around 2007, a modernized, authorized continuation/remake named &quot;Blockout II&quot; was released with a license from Kadon Enterprises, to use the trademarked &quot;Blockout&quot; name. The game is open-source and was ported to many platforms the original wasn&#x27;t available before, like Microsoft Windows, Ubuntu, and the OpenPandora handheld.

In 2021, a web browser-based version written in JavaScript and HTML5 was released. It is officially licensed to use the name &quot;Blockout&quot;.

<text>Terence Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Henricks (born July 5, 1952) is a retired colonel in the United States Air Force and a former NASA astronaut. He served on four Space Shuttle missions.

==Personal life and education==
Henricks was born on July 5, 1952, in Bryan, Ohio, to Terry and Martha Henricks, but considers Woodville, Ohio, to be his hometown. He graduated from Woodmore High School in 1970. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering from the United States Air Force Academy in 1974 and his Master of Public Administration degree from Golden Gate University in 1982. He is married and has three children. He currently resides in Blanco, Texas, with his wife Rebecca.

==Special honors==
*The Distinguished Flying Cross
*The NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal
*The Defense Superior Service Medal
*The Defense Meritorious Service Medal
*Air Force Meritorious Service Medals
*Air Force Commendation Medals (2)
*NASA Space Flight Medals (4)
*Honorary Doctor of Science degree from Defiance College (1993)
*F-4 Fighter Weapons School Outstanding Flying Award
*Named Pilot Training Distinguished Graduate and F-16 Conversion Course Top Gun
*Inducted into the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame

==Military and flight experience==
Henricks completed pilot training at Craig Air Force Base (AFB) in Selma, Alabama, and F-4 Phantom II conversion training at Homestead AFB in Miami, Florida. He then flew the F-4 in fighter squadrons in England and Iceland. In 1980, he was reassigned to Nellis AFB, Las Vegas, Nevada. After attending the USAF Test Pilot School in 1983, he remained at Edwards AFB, California, as an F-16C test pilot and Chief of the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing Operating Location until his NASA selection. He has 749 parachute jumps and a Master Parachutist rating. He has flown 30 different types of aircraft, has logged over 6,000 hours flying time, and holds an FAA commercial pilot rating.

==NASA experience==
Selected by NASA in June 1985, Henricks became an astronaut in July 1986. His technical assignments to date include: re-evaluating Shuttle landing sites worldwide; Assistant Manager for Engineering Integration in the Shuttle Program Office; Lead Astronaut of the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory at Johnson Space Center, and of Vehicle Test and Checkout at the Kennedy Space Center; Chief of the Astronaut Office Operations Development Branch. He also served as the Assistant for Shuttle to the Chief of the Astronaut Office, directing crew involvement in the development and operation of the Shuttle. A commander of two Space Shuttle missions and pilot of two others, Henricks became the first person to log over 1,000 hours as a Space Shuttle pilot/commander. Tom Henricks left government service in November 1997 to pursue a career in business. He held the position of President of McGraw-Hill&#x27;s Aviation Week, based in New York City until his departure in 2010 to pursue other opportunities.

==Space flight experience==
STS-44 &quot;Atlantis&quot; launched the night of November 24, 1991. The primary mission objective was the deployment of a Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite with an Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) rocket booster. The mission was concluded after 110 orbits of the Earth returning to a landing on the lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 1, 1991.

STS-55, the German D-2 Spacelab mission, was launched on April 26, 1993, aboard &quot;Columbia&quot;, and landed 10 days later on May 6, 1993, at Edwards AFB California. During the ambitious mission 89 experiments were performed in many disciplines such as materials processing, life sciences, robotics, technology, astronomy, and Earth mapping.

STS-70 launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 13, 1995, and returned there July 22, 1995. During 142 orbits of the Earth, the crew performed a variety of experiments in addition to deploying the sixth and final NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite. STS-70, with an &quot;all-Ohio&quot; crew, was the first mission controlled from the new combined control center.

STS-78 launched June 20, 1996 and landed July 7, 1996, becoming the longest Space Shuttle mission to date (later that year the STS-80 mission broke its record by 19 hours.) The 16-day mission included studies sponsored by 10 nations and five space agencies, and was the first mission to combine both a full microgravity studies agenda and a comprehensive life science investigation. The Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission served as a model for future studies on board the International Space Station.

<doc id="604831" wikidata="Q603357" url="?curid=604831" title="Store and forward">
<text>Store and forward is a telecommunications technique in which information is sent to an intermediate station where it is kept and sent at a later time to the final destination or to another intermediate station. The intermediate station, or node in a networking context, verifies the integrity of the message before forwarding it. In general, this technique is used in networks with intermittent connectivity, especially in the wilderness or environments requiring high mobility. It may also be preferable in situations when there are long delays in transmission and error rates are variable and high, or if a direct, end-to-end connection is not available.

== Modern store and forward networking ==
* Store and forward originates with delay-tolerant networks. No real-time services are available for these kinds of networks.
* Logistical Networking is a scalable form of store and forward networking that exposes network-embedded buffers on intermediate nodes and allows flexible creation of services by higher-level managers including caching, point-to-multipoint communication (or multicast), content delivery and many other stateful distributed services. Real time services can be created using logistical networking when data transfer connectivity permits.

A store-and-forward switching center is a message switching center in which a message is accepted from the originating user, &quot;i.e.,&quot; sender, when it is offered, held in a physical storage, and forwarded to the destination user, &quot;i.e.,&quot; receiver, in accordance with the priority placed upon the message by the originating user and the availability of an outgoing channel.

Store and forward switching centers are usually implemented in mobile service stations where the messages that are sent from the sender is first sent to these centers. If the destination address isn&#x27;t available, then the center stores this message and tries sending it later. This improves the probability of the message to be delivered. In the other case, if the destination is available at that time, then the message is immediately sent.

== Manually operated relay ==
Store and forward networks predate the use of computers. Point-to-point teleprinter equipment was used to send messages which were stored at the receiving end on punched paper tape at a relay center. A human operator at the center removed the message tape from the receiving machine, read the addressing information, and then sent it toward its destination on appropriate outbound point-to-point teleprinter link. If the outbound link was in use, the operator placed the message in tape in a physical queue, usually consisting of a set of clips or hooks. A major relay center in the mid 1900s might have dozens of inbound and outbound teleprinters, scores of operators, and thousands of messages in the queues during peak periods. Operators referred to these centers as &quot;torn-tape relay centers&quot;, a reference to removing the received message from the inbound teleprinter by tearing the paper tape to separate one message from the next. The U.S. military term for such a center was &quot;Non-Automated Relay Center&quot; (NARC).

== Automatic relay ==
In 1948, Western Union introduced Plan 55-A, the first automatic electromechanical store and forward message switching system. All message storage was performed by paper tape punches paired with paper tape readers, with a bin in between.

==Email==
It is very common for an email system using SMTP to accept a message, store it and then forward it on elsewhere. Although fully open mail relays are no longer common, not only does simple server-based forwarding work this way, but also many email filtering and automated electronic mailing lists services.

==SMS==
SMS messages are first sent to a Short Message service center where they are stored temporarily before being forwarded to the intended recipient&#x27;s phone, even if they are not currently reachable, allowing for delivery later when they come back online.

==UUCP==

Prior to the deployment of the Internet, computers were connected via a variety of point-to-point techniques, with many smaller computers using dial-up connections. The UUCP store-and-forward protocols allowed a message (typically e-mail) to move across the collection of computers and eventually reach its destination. Late in the 20th century, store and forward techniques evolved into packet switching which replaced it for most purposes.

==FidoNet==

FidoNet was an email store-and-forward system for bulletin board systems that peaked at 45,000 systems with millions of users across the world. The system was highly efficient, using the latest file compression and file transfer systems to aggressively drive down the cost of transmission on what was largely a hobby network. The system was later modified to support public messages (forums) called EchoMail, which grew to about 8 MB a day, compressed.

<text>David Carl Hilmers (born January 28, 1950) is a former NASA astronaut who flew four Space Shuttle missions. He was born in Clinton, Iowa, but considers DeWitt, Iowa, to be his hometown. He has two grown sons. His recreational interests include playing the piano, gardening, electronics, spending time with his family, and all types of sports. His parents are deceased. With five academic degrees, he is the second most formally educated U.S. astronaut, behind Story Musgrave with six.

==Education==
Graduated from Central Community High School in DeWitt, Iowa, in 1968; received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics (summa cum laude) from Cornell College in 1972, a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering (with distinction) in 1977, and the degree of Electrical Engineer from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1978. He received a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree from the Baylor College of Medicine in 1995 with honors and a Master of Science degree in Public Health (MPH) from the UTHealth School of Public Health at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) in 2002.

==Experience==
Hilmers entered active duty with the United States Marine Corps in July 1972. On completing The Basic School and Naval Flight Officer School, he was assigned to VMA(AW)-121 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, flying the A-6 Intruder as a bombardier-navigator. In 1975, he became an air liaison officer with the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines, stationed with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1978 and was later assigned to the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. He was stationed with the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California, at the time of his selection by NASA.

==NASA experience==
Hilmers was selected a NASA astronaut in July 1980 and completed the initial training period in August 1981. In 1983 he was selected as a member of the launch-ready standby crew. His early NASA assignments have included work on rocket upper stages such as PAM, IUS, and Centaur, as well as Shuttle software verification at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL). In addition, he was the Astronaut Office training coordinator, worked on various Department of Defense payloads, served as a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) at Mission Control for STS-41-D, STS-41-G, STS-51-A, STS-51-C and STS-51-D, worked Space Station issues for the Astronaut Office, and served as head of the Mission Development Branch within the Astronaut Office. In May 1985 he was named to the crew of STS-61-F, which was to deploy the Ulysses spacecraft on an interplanetary trajectory using a Centaur upper stage. This mission was to have flown in May 1986, but the Shuttle Centaur project was terminated in July 1986, and Hilmers then worked in the areas of ascent abort development, payload safety, and Shuttle on-board software. During 1987 he was involved in training for STS-26 and in flight software development. He later became head of the Mission Development branch in the astronaut office.

A veteran of four space flights, he has logged over 493 hours in space. He served as a mission specialist on STS-51-J (October 3–7, 1985), STS-26 (September 29 to October 3, 1988), STS-36 (February 28 to March 4, 1990), and STS-42 (January 22–30, 1992).

==Space flight experience==
STS-51-J &quot;Atlantis&quot;, a classified Department of Defense mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 3, 1985. This was the maiden voyage of the Orbiter &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Hilmers had prime responsibility for a number of on-orbit activities during the mission. After 98 hours of orbital operations, &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 7, 1985.

STS-26 &quot;Discovery&quot;, the first mission to be flown after the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident, was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 29, 1988. During the four-day mission, the crew successfully deployed the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-C), which was subsequently carried to orbit by the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) rocket. They also operated eleven mid-deck experiments. &quot;Discovery&quot; completed 64 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 3, 1988.

STS-36 &quot;Atlantis&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 28, 1990. This mission carried Department of Defense payloads and a number of secondary payloads. After 72 orbits of the Earth, the STS-36 mission concluded with a lakebed landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on March 4, 1990, after traveling 1.87 million miles.

Hilmers replaced Manley Lanier &quot;Sonny&quot; Carter Jr., killed in a plane crash, for his last mission. STS-42 &quot;Discovery&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 22, 1992. Fifty-five major experiments conducted in the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 module were provided by investigators from eleven countries, and represented a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. During 128 orbits of the Earth, the STS-42 crew accomplished the mission&#x27;s primary objective of investigating the effects of microgravity on materials processing and life sciences. In this unique laboratory in space, crew members worked around-the-clock in two shifts. Experiments investigated the microgravity effects on the growth of protein and semiconductor crystals. Biological experiments on the effects of zero gravity on plants, tissues, bacteria, insects and human vestibular response were also conducted. This eight-day mission culminated in a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 30, 1992.

==Post-NASA experience==
Hilmers decided to apply to medical school while training for his third shuttle flight. He attended pre-med courses at night while training for his fourth flight. Hilmers retired from NASA and the United States Marine Corps in October 1992, and went on to complete medical school and residency in the combined Internal Medicine/Pediatrics program at Baylor College of Medicine. He currently holds the rank of Professor in the departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, the Center for Space Medicine, and Baylor Global Initiatives at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. In addition to his teaching and clinical duties, he is involved in research in global health and malnutrition in many countries. He spends much of his spare time providing humanitarian medical care locally in Houston and in developing nations, including disaster relief efforts in Iraq, Peru, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Haiti, in Liberia during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, and development of hepatitis B clinical and public health services in Madagascar, North Korea and Kiribati through affiliation with Hepatitis B Free.

<doc id="604855" wikidata="Q4587" url="?curid=604855" title="Sierra Leonean leone">
<text>The leone is the currency of Sierra Leone. It is subdivided into 100 &quot;cents&quot;. As of 1 July 2022, the ISO 4217 code is &quot;SLE&quot; due to a redenomination of the old leone (SLL) at a rate of SLL 1000 to SLE 1. The leone is abbreviated as &quot;Le&quot; placed before the amount.

==History==

The leone was introduced on 4 August 1964. It replaced the British West African pound at a rate of 1 pound = 2 leones (i.e., 1 leone = 10 shillings). When it was introduced, one leone was worth precisely half a pound sterling or US$1.40. The leone was worth more than the U.S. dollar until the 1980s, when the currency started to devalue rapidly. Years of high inflation have caused the value of leone to plummet, and a U.S. dollar became worth thousands of leones starting in the 2000s.

In August 2021, it was announced that a new leone (SLE), worth 1000 SLL, would be introduced. The new leone was eventually introduced in July 2022. Old leones were legal tender until 31 December 2023 and redeemable for current legal tender in commercial banks until 31 March 2024.

==Coins==
===First Leone (SLL)===
In 1964, decimal coins were introduced in denominations of , 1, 5, 10 and 20 cents. The coins size and compositions were based in part on those of the former colonial state British West Africa. All bore the portrait of the first prime minister of Sierra Leone, Sir Milton Margai. In 1972, 50 cents coins were introduced which carried the portrait of the first president Dr. Siaka Stevens.

In 1974, round cupro-nickel one leone coins were introduced and in 1976, seven sided cupro-nickel 2 leone coins commemorating FAO were introduced. These latter two denominations, however, did not circulate as frequently as the lower cent denominations. The portrait of Stevens also appeared on a new, slightly smaller series of coins introduced in 1980 in denominations of , 1, 5, 10 and 20 cents. In 1987, octagonal, nickel-bronze 1 leone coins were introduced with a bust portrait of General Joseph Saidu Momoh. This coin effectively replaced the one leone note.

Following a period of economic collapse and the following Sierra Leone Civil War inflation became rampant, devaluing older coins. A new coin series was introduced in 1996 for 10, 50 and 100 leones. The 50 leones is octagonal while the other two are round. These coins were struck in nickel-plated steel and feature important figures in Sierra Leone&#x27;s political history. Ten sided, bimetallic 500 leones coins were first introduced in 2004. Of the four coins in circulation, only the 100 leones is available in small quantity due to their low valuation and shortage of supply.

500 leones coins and the two lowest denominations are rarely encountered due to rampant metal theft in the impoverished country.

===Second Leone (SLE)===
With the introduction of the new leone, coins were re-issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents.

==Banknotes==
===First Leone (SLL)===
With the introduction of decimal currency in 1964, a new series of Banknotes was introduced by the Bank of Sierra Leone. Originally called Shillings, the unit name &quot;Leone&quot; was finally decided upon. After considering (and subsequently rejecting) several new designs, including a particularly attractive multi-coloured design, notes were issued in the 1, 2 and 5 Leone denominations. These officially replaced notes of the British West African pound at a two leone to one pound exchange ratio. 50 cents notes were introduced in 1979, followed by 10 leones in 1980 and 20 leones notes in 1982. Throughout this period the value of the currency was fixed and remained relatively stable despite inherent economic problems.

100 leones notes were introduced in 1988, followed by 500 leones in 1991, 1000 and 5000 leones in 1993, 2000 leones in the year 2000 and 10,000 Leone in 2004.

The original series of notes (1964-1974) depicted the famous 300 year old Cottonwood Tree and Court building in central Freetown. The reverses showed Diamond Mining (1 Leone), a Village market scene (2 Leones) and the Dockside in Freetown (5 Leones). Subsequent issues (1974-1991) depicted the head of state during the time of issue. The first series depicting Sir Milton Margai and later issues depicting either Siaka and Momoh. This practice ended with the ascension of the NPRC regime and has remained so despite the return to civilian government.

Prior to June 2010, bank notes in circulation were 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 and 10,000 leones. 10,000 leones notes were in circulation for less than ten years and were infrequently encountered. This meant that most transactions took place in bundles of 5000 leones notes.

In June 2010, the Bank of Sierra Leone issued new notes which were slightly smaller in size than the earlier series and intended to be more secure and durable. The new bank notes are: Le10,000, Le5,000, Le2,000 and Le1,000. Coins are still used, but because of their low value are less common.

As of 23 Oct 2018, 20,000 leones were equivalent to about 2.09 EUR. As of 19 April 2021, 20,000 leones were equivalent to about 1.62 EUR.

===Second Leone (SLE)===
Redenominated banknotes in the values of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 leones were introduced in 2022, the 20 leones being a new denomination and the 1-10 leones notes maintain the themes and designs of their preceding issues of 1,000-10,000 old leone notes.

<text>Earl of Danby was a title that was created twice in the Peerage of England. The first creation came in 1626 in favour of the soldier Henry Danvers, 1st Baron Danvers. He had already been created Baron Danvers, of Dauntsey in the County of Wiltshire, in 1603, also in the Peerage of England. The titles became extinct on his death in 1644. The second creation came in 1674 in favour of Thomas Osborne, 1st Viscount Latimer. He was the son of Anne, daughter of Thomas Walmesley and Eleanor Danvers, sister of the first Earl of the first creation. For more information on the second creation, see Duke of Leeds.

<text>The Brooklyn Museum is an art museum in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. At , the museum is New York City&#x27;s second largest and contains an art collection with around 500,000 objects. Located near the Prospect Heights, Crown Heights, Flatbush, and Park Slope neighborhoods of Brooklyn, the museum&#x27;s Beaux-Arts building was designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White.

The Brooklyn Museum was founded in 1823 as the Brooklyn Apprentices&#x27; Library and merged with the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences in 1843. The museum was conceived as an institution focused on a broad public. The Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s current building dates to 1897 and has been expanded several times since then. The museum initially struggled to maintain its building and collection, but it was revitalized in the late 20th century following major renovations.

Significant areas of the collection include antiquities, specifically their collection of Egyptian antiquities spanning over 3,000 years. European, African, Oceanic, and Japanese art make for notable antiquities collections as well. American art is heavily represented, starting at the Colonial period. Artists represented in the collection include Mark Rothko, Edward Hopper, Norman Rockwell, Judy Chicago, Winslow Homer, Edgar Degas, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, and Max Weber.

==History==
The Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s origins date to August 1823, when Augustus Graham founded the Brooklyn Apprentices&#x27; Library in Brooklyn Heights. The library was formally incorporated November 24, 1824, and the cornerstone of the library&#x27;s first building was laid in 1825 on Henry and Cranberry Street. The Library moved into the Brooklyn Lyceum building on Washington Street in 1841. The two institutions merged into the Brooklyn Institute in 1843; the institute offered exhibitions of painting and sculpture and lectures on diverse subjects. The Washington Street building was destroyed in a fire in 1891.

=== Development and opening ===
In February 1889, several prominent Brooklyn citizens announced that they would begin fundraising for a new museum for the Brooklyn Institute. The museum&#x27;s proponents quickly identified a site just east of Prospect Park, on the south side of Eastern Parkway. The next year, under director Franklin Hooper, Institute leaders reorganized as the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences and began planning the Brooklyn Museum. Brooklyn officials hosted an architectural design competition for the building, eventually awarding the contract to McKim, Mead &amp; White. The competition was characterized in the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; as &quot;one of the most important in the history of architecture&quot;, as the museum was to contain numerous divisions. The museum remained a subdivision of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, along with the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and the Brooklyn Children&#x27;s Museum, until these organizations all became independent in the 1970s.

Brooklyn mayor Charles A. Schieren agreed in January 1895 to issue $300,000 per year in bonds for the Brooklyn Institute museum&#x27;s construction. Initially, only a single wing and pavilion on the western portion of the museum&#x27;s site, measuring across, was to be built. Engineers began surveying the site that May and found that the bedrock under the site was several hundred feet deep, making it impossible to build the foundations on solid rock. Nonetheless, the engineers had determined that the gravel fill under the site was strong enough to support a building. Construction on the Brooklyn Museum of Arts and Sciences&#x27; west wing officially began on September 14, 1895. A groundbreaking ceremony for the museum was hosted on December 14 of the same year. Two of the museum&#x27;s three stories had been completed by April 1896.

The Brooklyn Institute museum&#x27;s building was completed in March 1897 after a sidewalk was built between the museum&#x27;s entrance and Eastern Parkway. The museum&#x27;s first exhibit was a collection of almost 600 paintings, which had opened to the public on June 1, 1897, several months before the formal opening of the museum. The Brooklyn Institute&#x27;s museum formally opened on October 2, 1897, and was one of the last major structures built in the city of Brooklyn before the formation of the City of Greater New York in 1898.

===20th century===

==== 1900s and 1910s ====
The Brooklyn Institute approved the construction of the central entrance pavilion in May 1899, and Hooper requested $600,000 for this addition the next month. The four-story structure was to measure . The central pavilion was to include a 1,250-seat lecture hall in the basement (actually at ground level), as well as a hall of sculpture on the first floor, which would serve as the museum&#x27;s main lobby. The second story was to contain natural-history exhibits, while the third story was to include paintings. The New York State Legislature needed to authorize $300,000 in bonds for the pavilion, but they had not done so by the end of 1899. Work on the central wing started in June 1900. The museum&#x27;s central section was nearly completed by January 1903, but work proceeded slowly due to labor disputes.

New York City mayor Seth Low signed a bill in August 1902, approving $150,000 for the construction of the Brooklyn Institute&#x27;s eastern wing and pavilion. The eastern wing cost $344,000 to construct, and it officially opened on December 14, 1907. With the opening of the eastern wing, the museum building had reached one-eighth of its total planned size. Although the museum&#x27;s collections continued to grow, the New York City government was only willing to give the museum as little funding as necessary for essential maintenance. Several of the institute&#x27;s donors proposed in 1905 to give $25,000 for the upkeep of an &quot;astronomical observatory&quot; at the Brooklyn Museum. City officials endorsed the creation of the observatory in 1907.

The Brooklyn Institute awarded a construction contract for wings F and G, extending south of the central pavilion, to Benedetto &amp; Egan in May 1911. Extending south and measuring wide, this addition was to contain a central court with a glass roof. That July, McKim, Mead &amp; White filed plans for wings F and G. The Brooklyn Institute converted the last remaining storage rooms in the eastern wing into galleries in October 1911. The next month, a temporary access road was built from Flatbush Avenue to the rear of the building. Wills &amp; Martin, one of the firms that had been hired to erect the new wings, declared bankruptcy in November 1913. Work stopped completely in November 1914, and the incomplete structures started to deteriorate. Because of the lack of space in the building, the lobby and auditorium were being used to exhibit artwork. The Brooklyn Institute had been forced to decline some donations of artwork, as the works could not be displayed, while other works of art had to be placed in storage.

==== 1920s to 1940s ====
By 1920, the New York City Subway&#x27;s Institute Park station had opened outside the Brooklyn Museum, greatly improving access to the once-isolated museum from Manhattan and the other boroughs. In April 1922, governor Nathan L. Miller signed legislation authorizing the New York City government to issue bonds to fund wings F and G of the Brooklyn Museum. The New York City Board of Estimate refused to approve the Brooklyn Institute trustees&#x27; request for $875,000, and mayor John Francis Hylan also blocked the funding. Hylan changed his mind after visiting the museum, and the Board of Estimate appropriated $1.05 million for the new wings. McKim, Mead &amp; White drew up new plans for wings F and G; by that September, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) was about to award contracts for the wings. A picture gallery opened at the museum in November 1925. The next month, museum officials dedicated the Ethnological Gallery, which was nicknamed &quot;Rainbow House&quot;; the gallery was designed by curator Stewart Culin. A Japanese art gallery opened at the museum in April 1927, and the museum&#x27;s Swiss Gothic, German, and Venetian galleries opened that May.

Construction of the Brooklyn Museum stalled in 1928 after years of attempts to complete it. At the time, only 28 of the 80 proposed statues atop the building&#x27;s facade had been installed, and the main north–south corridor was not complete. Nineteen American period rooms opened at the museum at the end of 1929. In May 1934, NYC Parks approved plans for the removal of the main entrance steps, which were replaced by ground-level doors. The project also included the construction of two galleries next to the lobby, as well as new landscaping and parking lots. This work was carried out by Public Works Administration laborers. A gallery dedicated to living artists&#x27; work opened in February 1935, and a Persian art gallery opened two months later. The remodeled entrance was officially dedicated on October 5, 1935. That December, the museum&#x27;s medieval art gallery opened. A gallery for industrial art was also proposed behind the western wing but was not built. The museum&#x27;s remodeling was completed in October 1937. Several collections, including Egyptian and Assyrian art, Renaissance art, and textiles were displayed to the public for the first time.

By early 1938, museum officials sought more than $300,000 for repairs to the museum building, and then-director Philip Newell Youtz said that parts of the building were crumbling. The Brooklyn Museum Art School, formerly a part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, was moved to the Brooklyn Museum in 1941. An art distribution center sponsored by the Works Progress Administration opened on the museum&#x27;s sixth floor the same year. The department store chain Abraham &amp; Straus donated $50,000 in 1948 for the establishment of a &quot;laboratory of industrial design&quot; at the Brooklyn Museum. By the following year, Brooklyn Institute officials sought to expand the museum as part of a &quot;vast cultural program&quot;. The plans involved an annex with a 2,500-seat auditorium behind the west wing, which was planned to cost $500,000, as well as a general renovation of existing facilities, which was to cost $1.5 million. A new 400-seat lecture hall opened at the museum that September, within space formerly occupied by two Egyptian galleries. To attract visitors, the museum expanded its educational programs greatly in the late 1940s.

==== 1950s and 1960s ====

Brooklyn Institute officials announced plans in 1951 to repair the Brooklyn Museum as part of the institute&#x27;s long-term plan to convert the museum into a cultural center. The museum&#x27;s Egyptian galleries began undergoing renovations the same year. The renovation of the Egyptian galleries, the first phase of the museum&#x27;s $3.5 million overhaul, was finished in November 1953. Brown, Lawford &amp; Forbes designed a rear annex for the museum in 1955. The museum&#x27;s furniture, sculpture, and watercolor galleries reopened in 1957 following the second stage of the renovation. The rear annex contained a new stairway, which led to new galleries on the fourth through sixth stories of the center section. By the late 1950s, the museum was running low on funds, with director Edgar C. Schenck blaming the museum&#x27;s fiscal woes on Manhattan residents&#x27; unwillingness to cross the East River to visit Brooklyn. Due to a shortage of security guards, the museum was forced to close some galleries part-time.

Another Egyptian gallery opened in April 1959, and a &quot;pattern library&quot; for teaching opened that July. A continued shortage of security guards forced the Brooklyn Museum to close two days a week at the beginning of 1961; the museum went back to seven-day operations in June 1961 after the city provided money for additional guards. To attract visitors, the museum began providing a larger variety of programs and adding interactive exhibits and programming. The Brooklyn Museum announced in 1964 that it would build a special-exhibit gallery on the first floor and an open study/storage gallery on the fifth floor. The Hall of the Americas opened on the museum&#x27;s first floor the following May. A sculpture garden, consisting of architectural details salvaged from demolished buildings across New York City, opened at the museum in April 1966. The Brooklyn Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art began coordinating joint programs and exhibitions in 1967.

By the late 1960s, the museum was again facing a funding shortage; several galleries had been temporarily closed due to a lack of money, and its director Thomas Buechner was considering closing the museum two days a week. Brooklyn Museum officials also wanted to hire additional security guards to deter crime. The Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s Community Gallery, exhibiting black New Yorkers&#x27; art, opened in October 1968 following advocacy from Federated Institutes of Cultural Enrichment (FICE), a coalition of Brooklyn-based arts organizations. The gallery occupied a narrow corridor at ground level. Henri Ghent, the director of the Community Gallery, estimated in 1970 that &quot;perhaps 100,000&quot; additional patrons had been attracted to the museum after the gallery opened, including black patrons who had never before visited a museum.

==== 1970s and early 1980s ====

The Brooklyn Museum continued to experience financial shortfalls in the early 1970s. Due to a shortage of security guards, in mid-1971, museum officials announced that they would close the museum two days per week, allowing all galleries to remain open even with limited security. The museum also reopened its 23 period rooms that October after a yearlong closure, and they also opened a new period room, themed to a private study. Officials planned to move the Community Gallery to a dedicated space adjoining the museum; the gallery was popular among guests but did not have enough funding from the museum itself. By late 1973, twenty percent of the museum&#x27;s staff professionals had resigned amid a dispute involving director Duncan F. Cameron&#x27;s firing of another employee, eventually prompting Cameron&#x27;s own resignation that year. Further staff disputes complicated the search for a replacement director, and many employees went on strike in 1974 because they wanted to form a labor union.

By the mid-1970s, there were plans to split the Brooklyn Children&#x27;s Museum and the Brooklyn Museum Art School from the Brooklyn Museum. At the time, the museum received $1.5 million per year from the city. Four galleries for Korean and Japanese art opened at the museum in October 1974, and the African art galleries reopened in December 1976 following an expansion and renovation. The Brooklyn Museum also began renovating 21 American period rooms in 1976. Following a 1978 investigation into some of the museum&#x27;s acquisitions, state attorney general Louis J. Lefkowitz recommended that the museum implement &quot;a comprehensive code of ethics&quot;. The same year, the Brooklyn Museum partnered with Designgroup and the Egyptian government to restore the Cairo Museum&#x27;s collection. Due to budget cuts, the Brooklyn Museum eliminated its Middle Eastern art division in 1979, despite the fact that the museum had frequently applied for federal grants in the preceding years, most of which had been approved from 1976 to 1978.

Two of the museum&#x27;s period rooms reopened in 1980 following a renovation. By then, director Michael Botwinick was considering several measures to reduce the museum&#x27;s budgetary shortfalls, including halving the number of art classes, closing the museum during the workweek, and hosting fewer exhibits per year. At the time, the museum received 31 percent of its funds from the city, a higher percentage than other New York City museums; the city still owned the building itself. After Robert Buck became director in 1983, he began hosting additional art classes, attracting members, and raising money for the museum, which struggled to compete with more famous institutions in Manhattan. In 1984, the museum completed the renovations of its last period rooms and opened a gallery for &quot;early-19th-century decorative arts&quot;. The unprofitable Brooklyn Museum Art School was closed the same year, and the museum obtained $14 million in city funding to upgrade the climate-control systems. The museum resumed Monday operations in late 1984 after receiving additional city funding, and it started running TV advertisements in 1985.

==== Mid-1980s and 1990s ====

The Brooklyn Museum announced a master plan in March 1986. The plan involved doubling the amount of exhibition space in the building from . At the time, the museum could only exhibit about five percent of its collection simultaneously, as its building was one-sixth as large as originally planned. The museum was to expand its storage, classroom, and conservation facilities and add an auditorium. Buck met with the heads of all of the museum&#x27;s departments to determine how much exhibit and storage space they needed. The museum also planned a new entrance from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which had twice as many annual visitors; the Botanic Garden entrance had been planned by McKim, Mead &amp; White but never executed. The project was expected to cost $50 million to $100 million, which was to be funded by the city&#x27;s capital budget.

Museum officials held an architectural design competition to redesign the west wing, attracting 103 competitors; they hired Arata Isozaki of James Stewart Polshek Partners that October. Isozaki&#x27;s design retained much of McKim, Mead &amp; White&#x27;s original plan but included a &quot;great hall&quot; and trapezoidal courtyards, as well as an angled rear wall and an obelisk. Buck expressed optimism that media coverage of the design competition would attract additional visitors, even if the master plan was never completely carried out. The scope of the renovation grew quickly, with estimated costs reaching $200 million by early 1988. Iris and B. Gerald Cantor donated $3.5 million for the museum&#x27;s auditorium in 1989, and the city gave another $2 million for other work. The Brooklyn Museum announced in 1990 that it would begin the first phase of renovation, which was to cost $31 million. This involved converting the offices in the west wing to about of gallery space for its Egyptian collection, as well as building storage space and an auditorium. The same year, budget cuts prompted museum officials to lay off employees and close its doors on Mondays.

The auditorium opened in 1991; at the time, there had not been an auditorium at the museum for over half a century. About in the museum&#x27;s west wing reopened as gallery space in November 1993. The renovation retained the original layout of the west-wing spaces. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Isozaki and Polshek&#x27;s renovation as aiming for &quot;clean, serene spaces&quot;; the rooms had rooms with maple floors, white walls, horizontal lighting strips, and granite baseboards. The west wing was renamed for investor Morris A. Schapiro and his brother, art historian Meyer Schapiro, in early 1994 after Morris Schapiro donated $5 million.

The Brooklyn Museum changed its name to Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1997. According to acting director Linda S. Ferber, the renaming was necessary because &quot;there was more confusion about the museum&#x27;s identity than we supposed&quot;; for instance, many visitors still believed the museum had natural-history exhibits, which had not been the case since 1934.

===21st century===

Brooklyn Museum officials hired architect James Polshek in 2000 to design a new glass-clad entrance for the building at a cost of $55 million. Polshek described the front entrance as a &quot;wasteland&quot; at the time, and he said he wanted to build &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s new front stoop&quot;. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission approved Polshek&#x27;s design, despite opposition from preservationists. The renovation cost $63 million and also added air conditioning throughout the museum building. The Henry Luce Foundation gave the museum a $10 million grant in 2001, which funded the construction of the Luce Center for American Art on the fifth floor. The museum&#x27;s renovation was completed in April 2004. At the same time, the museum announced that it would revert to its previous name, Brooklyn Museum. By then, the Brooklyn Museum was focusing on attracting Brooklyn residents, rather than visitors from other boroughs. The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art opened on the museum&#x27;s fourth floor in March 2007.

The museum extensively renovated its Great Hall, which reopened in early 2011, and it relocated and reopened its African art gallery on the first floor the same year. A museum shop opened at the Brooklyn Museum in early 2012, followed later that year by a new cafe. The upscale restaurant Saul opened within the Brooklyn Museum in October 2013, changing its name to The Norm in 2016. By the mid-2010s, the museum was facing financial difficulties, and half of the 465,000 annual patrons did not pay admission because of the museum&#x27;s suggested admission policy. The Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s Chinese-art gallery reopened in 2019.

The museum was temporarily closed from March to October 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. During the George Floyd protests in New York City in June 2020, the museum participated in the Open Your Lobby initiative, being one of two major art institutions in New York City (along with MoMA PS1) to provide protesters with shelter or resources. The Brooklyn Museum received $50 million from the New York City government in 2021, the largest such gift in the museum&#x27;s history. The money was to be used to renovate into gallery space. The museum&#x27;s South Asian and Islamic galleries reopened in 2022, completing a 12-year renovation of the Asian galleries. To make way for additional exhibition space, in early 2024 the museum sold off 200 objects and the contents of four period rooms. In January 2024, the museum opened its Toby Devan Lewis Education Center, which contains three studios and a gallery. The museum started using a new logo that September. Due to increasing financial deficits, in early 2025, museum officials laid off employees and reduced the number of annual exhibitions.

==Building==
The Brooklyn Museum building is a steel frame structure clad in masonry, designed in the neoclassical style by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White and built by the Carlin Construction Company. The original museum building is a New York City designated landmark and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in June 1978. The museum shares a large city block with Brooklyn&#x27;s Central Library, Mount Prospect Park, and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden to the west and south.

=== Exterior ===
The original design for the Brooklyn Museum proposed a structure four times as large as what was built from 1893 through 1927, when construction ended. As designed, the three-story museum building was supposed to have several wings, centered around a memorial hall and clustered around four light courts. After Brooklyn became part of greater New York City in 1898, support for the project diminished. Only the wings on the northern end, as well as the northeastern light court (known as the Auditorium Court), were built; the resulting L-shaped building covers a site of about . Although additional wings were built behind the original east wing over the years (creating the current light court), nothing was built behind the west wing. This led the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; to liken the museum building to a movie set.

==== Main facade ====

The primary elevation of the facade, facing north along Eastern Parkway, is wide and consists of the west and east wings, which flank a projecting pavilion with a portico. Additional pavilions project from the facade at either end. The center portico contains six Ionic columns that support a pediment with sculptures in its tympanum. The portico was originally accessed by a staircase that was removed in 1936–1937. Daniel Chester French was responsible for the pediment sculptures. French also designed the two allegorical figures &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Manhattan&quot; flanking the museum&#x27;s entrance; they were created in 1916 for the Brooklyn approach to the Manhattan Bridge and relocated to the museum in 1963. Above the pediment is a copper cresting with anthemia, as well as a low saucer dome. The modern main entrance, dating to Polshek&#x27;s 2004 renovation, consists of a glass pavilion with four metal pylons, as well as a semicircular plaza just outside. A set of brick piers, which had supported the original entrance staircase, was repurposed into a brick arch in 2004.

The pavilions at either end of the Eastern Parkway facade protrude only slightly from the facade and contain engaged columns in the Ionic order. The west and east wings are divided vertically by pilasters; between each set of pilasters are windows with architraves. The entablature above the pilasters contains a frieze with inscribed names of figures who represent knowledge.

The Eastern Parkway facade is topped by 20 monolithic figures on the cornice: one above each pilaster on the west and east wings, and four above the pavilions. An additional ten figures, five each on the western and eastern elevations of the outermost pavilions, were sculpted. The sculptures were carved by the Piccirilli Brothers, who sculpted a total of 30 figures on the museum&#x27;s facade. Fourteen sculptors were hired to design the sculptures, which each measure high. Had the full building been completed, there would have been 80 sculptures in total, with 20 each depicting classical subjects, medieval and Renaissance subjects, modern European and American subjects, and Asian subjects. The 30 extant sculptures consist of the 20 classical sculptures (10 Greek and 10 Roman) on the northern elevation, as well as five Persian and five Chinese sculptures on the side elevations.

==== Other facades ====
The eastern elevation of the facade faces Washington Avenue, where only the pavilion at the northern end was built. The rest of the eastern elevation is similar to that on Eastern Parkway, with pilasters dividing it vertically into seven bays. Unlike on Eastern Parkway, the pilasters are topped by shorter pilasters rather than sculptures. The southern elevation faces a parking lot and contains a masonry facade and some windows. There is also an annex to the south, designed by Brown, Lawford &amp; Forbes, which contains a secondary entrance and a stairway.

=== Interior ===
The oldest portion of the building measured and comprised only about three percent of what was originally planned. The center of the first floor would have contained a memorial hall, while a &quot;great hall of sculpture&quot; would have extended to the north and south of the memorial hall. To the west of the memorial hall would have been gallery space for artwork on loan, while to the east would have been a multi-story auditorium. The remaining corners of the first floor would have included several additional galleries for the museum&#x27;s permanent collections, and the light courts would have exhibited large objects. The second floor would have housed more collections and lecture rooms, while the third floor would have had the library, music room, and galleries for images, domestic art, and science. An additional story, above the central part of the building, would have housed more departments of the museum.

The main lobby, originally occupied by the ground-level auditorium, was built during the mid-20th century as a modern-style space. Although then-director Philip Newell Youtz was the architect of record, the lobby&#x27;s design may have been influenced by William Lescaze, who was Youtz&#x27;s friend. The lobby, containing black-glass panels and indirect lighting, was described in the 1939 &quot;WPA Guide to New York City&quot; as &quot;an example of the best in modern architecture... devoid of the elaborate decoration which so often clutters up the entrances of public building.&quot; Following a 2011 renovation, the lobby was redesigned as a double-height central gallery surrounded by columns.

== Operations ==
The Brooklyn Museum is operated by a nonprofit of the same name, which was established in 1935. The museum is part of the Cultural Institutions Group (CIG), a group of institutions that occupy land or buildings owned by the New York City government and derive part of their yearly funding from the city. It was also part of the Brooklyn Educational Cultural Alliance during the late 20th century. During the late 1980s, the museum was part of a group called Destination Brooklyn, which sought to attract visitors to Brooklyn; this initiative had stalled by the early 1990s.

=== Directors ===
Franklin Hooper was the Brooklyn Institute&#x27;s first director, serving for 25 years until his death in 1914. Hooper was succeeded by William Henry Fox, who served from 1914 to his retirement in 1934. Fox was followed by Philip Newell Youtz from 1934 to 1938. Laurance Page Roberts was director from 1938 to 1942, when his wife Isabel Spaulding Roberts became interim director on his behalf; L. P. Roberts formally resigned in 1946. His immediate successor, Charles Nagel Jr., served for nine years until he resigned in 1955. Edgar Craig Schenck, who was appointed director shortly afterward, served until his death in 1959. Thomas S. Buechner became the museum&#x27;s director in 1960, making him one of the youngest directors in the country. During Buechner&#x27;s tenure, Donelson Hoopes was hired as Curator of Paintings and Sculptures from 1965 to 1969.

Duncan F. Cameron assumed the directorship in 1971, following Buechner&#x27;s resignation; Cameron himself resigned in 1973. Michael Kan was appointed as acting director in early 1974, serving for a few months. He was succeeded by Michael Botwinick, who was appointed in 1974 and stepped down in 1982. Robert T. Buck became director in 1983 and served until he resigned in 1996, upon which Linda S. Ferber became acting director. From 1992 to 1995, Stephanie Stebich was Buck&#x27;s assistant director. Arnold L. Lehman was named as the museum&#x27;s director in April 1997, and Lehman announced in September 2014 that he would retire the next year. In May 2015, Creative Time president and artistic director Anne Pasternak was named the museum&#x27;s next director; she assumed the position on September 1, 2015.

Since 2014, the director&#x27;s position has formally been known as the &quot;Shelby White and Leon Levy Director of the Brooklyn Museum&quot;, after Leon Levy Foundation cofounder Shelby White donated $5 million to the directorship&#x27;s endowment.

=== Funding ===
According to the museum&#x27;s website, it receives funding from the city government, Brooklyn borough president&#x27;s office, mayor&#x27;s office, New York City Council, state government, federal government, and other agencies. In 2005, the museum was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, in turn funded by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. Major benefactors have historically included Frank Lusk Babbott. The museum is the site of the annual Brooklyn Artists Ball which has included celebrity hosts such as Sarah Jessica Parker and Liv Tyler.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Brooklyn Museum had an endowment of $108 million, but the museum applied for federal funding through the Paycheck Protection Program after its endowment declined by one-fifth in 2020. Amid the pandemic and its negative impact on museum revenue, the museum raised funds for an endowment to pay for collections care by selling or deaccessioning works of art. The October 2020 sale consisted of 12 works by artists including Lucas Cranach the Elder, Gustave Courbet, and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, while other sales throughout that month included Modernist artists. Though usually prohibited by the Association of Art Museum Directors, the association allowed such sales to proceed for a two-year window through 2022 in response to the effects of the pandemic.

==Art and exhibitions==
The Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s collection contains around 500,000 objects. In the twentieth century, Brooklyn Museum exhibitions sought to present an encyclopedic view of art and culture, with a focus on educating a broad public. By the 21st century, the Brooklyn Museum frequently hosted shows that promoted cultural diversity and, in particular, underrepresented demographic groups.

===Notable exhibitions===
In 1923, the museum was one of the first U.S. institutions to exhibit African cast-metal and other objects as art, rather than as ethnological artifacts. The museum&#x27;s acquisitions during this time also included such varied objects as the interior of a Swiss house, a stained glass window, and a pipe organ. The museum&#x27;s first period room opened in 1929; these period rooms represented middle-class and non-elite citizens&#x27; homes, in contrast to other museums. which tended to focus on upper-class period rooms. The 17th-century Jans Martense Schenck house became part of the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s collection in the 1950s, as did the interior of a room in John D. Rockefeller Jr.&#x27;s Midtown Manhattan home.

In 1967 the Federated Institutes of Cultural Enrichment (FICE), a coalition of Brooklyn-based arts organizations, demanded that the Brooklyn Museum exhibit more works by artists from the borough, especially African American artists. The museum then hired black curator Henri Ghent to direct a new &quot;Community Gallery&quot;, supported at first by the New York State Council on the Arts; he worked at the museum till 1972. Ghent&#x27;s first exhibition, &quot;Contemporary Afro-American Arts&quot; (1968), included artists Joe Overstreet, Kay Brown, Frank Smith, and Otto Neals.

In 1999–2000, the Sensation exhibition of Charles Saatchi&#x27;s collection provoked controversy for its inclusion of works such as Chris Ofili&#x27;s The Holy Virgin Mary. The exhibition prompted then-mayor Rudolph Giuliani to threaten to withhold city funding from the museum. In the resulting lawsuit, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the New York City government could not withhold city funds from the Brooklyn Museum on First Amendment grounds.

In 2002, the museum received the work &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, by feminist artist Judy Chicago, as a gift from The Elizabeth A. Sackler Foundation. Its permanent exhibition began in 2007, as a centerpiece for the museum&#x27;s Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. In 2004, the Brooklyn Museum featured &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, an oil-on-wood mural by Alexis Rockman that was commissioned by the museum as a centerpiece for the second-floor Mezzanine Gallery and marked the opening of the museum&#x27;s renovated Grand Lobby and plaza. Other exhibitions have showcased the works of various contemporary artists including Patrick Kelly, Chuck Close, Denis Peterson, Ron Mueck, Takashi Murakami, Mat Benote, Kiki Smith, Jim Dine, Robert Rauschenberg, Ching Ho Cheng, Sylvia Sleigh William Wegman, Jimmy de Sana, Oscar yi Hou, Baseera Khan, Loraine O&#x27;Grady, John Edmonds, Cecilia Vicuña, Sonia Guiñansaca, and a 2004 survey show of work by Brooklyn artists, &quot;Open House: Working in Brooklyn&quot;

In 2008, curator Edna Russman announced that she believes 10 out of 30 works of Coptic art held in the museum&#x27;s collection—second-largest in North America are fake. The artworks were exhibited starting in 2009.

In early to mid-2018, the museum hosted what was the final stop of the touring exhibit &quot;David Bowie Is&quot;, which had begun in 2013 in London and visited nearly a dozen countries before reaching the Brooklyn Museum. Costumes from &quot;The Crown&quot; and &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Gambit&quot; television series were put on display as part of its virtual exhibition &quot;The Queen and the Crown&quot; in November 2020. From June through September 2023, coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary of Pablo Picasso&#x27;s death, the museum hosted &quot;It&#x27;s Pablo-matic: Picasso According to Hannah Gadsby&quot;, curated by Hannah Gadsby; though the exhibition was popular, it was also highly controversial. To celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Brooklyn Apprentices&#x27; Library&#x27;s incorporation, the museum launched a series of special exhibits and events in 2024.
==Collections==

===Egyptian, Classical, and Ancient Near Eastern Art===
The Brooklyn Museum has been building a collection of Egyptian artifacts since the beginning of the twentieth century, incorporating both collections purchased from others, such as that of American Egyptologist Charles Edwin Wilbour, whose heirs also donated his library to become the museum&#x27;s Wilbour Library of Egyptology, and objects obtained during museum-sponsored archeological excavations. The Egyptian collection includes objects ranging from statuary, such as the well-known &quot;Bird Lady&quot; terra cotta figure, to papyrus documents (among others the Brooklyn Papyrus). The museum has nine mummified Egyptians.

The Egyptian, Classical, and Ancient Near Eastern collections are housed in a series of galleries in the museum. Egyptian artifacts can be found in the long-term exhibit, &quot;Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity&quot;, as well as in the Martha A. and Robert S. Rubin Galleries. Near Eastern artifacts are located in the Hagop Kevorkian Gallery.

====Selections from the Egyptian collection====
===American art===
Francis Guy&#x27;s &quot;Winter Scene in Brooklyn&quot; ( 1820) was the first object in the museum&#x27;s collection of American art, bequeathed in 1846. In 1855, the museum officially designated a collection of American Art, with the first work commissioned for the collection being a landscape painting by Asher B. Durand. Items in the American Art collection include portraits, pastels, sculptures, and prints; all items in the collection date to between c. 1720 and c. 1945.

Represented in the American art collection are works by artists such as William Edmondson (&quot;Angel&quot;, date unknown), John Singer Sargent&#x27;s &quot;Paul César Helleu sketching his wife Alice Guérin&quot; (ca. 1889); Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s &quot;Dark Tree Trunks&quot; (ca. 1946), and Winslow Homer&#x27;s &quot;Eight Bells&quot; (ca. 1887). Among the most famous works in the collection are Gilbert Stuart&#x27;s portrait of George Washington and Edward Hicks&#x27;s &quot;The Peaceable Kingdom&quot;. The museum also holds a collection by Emil Fuchs.

Works from the American art collection can be found in various areas of the museum, including in the Steinberg Family Sculpture Garden and in the exhibit, &quot;American Identities: A New Look&quot;, which is contained within the museum&#x27;s &quot;Visible Storage ▪ Study Center&quot;. In total, there are approximately 2,000 American Art objects held in storage.

====Selections from the American collection====
===Asian art===
In 2019, the museum reopened its Japanese and Chinese exhibits, after reinstalling its Korean section in 2017. The Chinese section offers pieces from more than 5,000 years of Chinese art and shows contemporary pieces on a regular schedule. The Japanese gallery, with its 7,000 pieces, is the largest of the museum&#x27;s Asian collection and is known for its works from the Ainu people. The museum also possesses a special edition of &quot;One Hundred Famous Views of Edo&quot; that incorporates special metallic dust. It was donated to the museum in the 1930s, unbound in the 1970s, put on display in 2000, and then displayed again in 2024. The museum is also home to works from Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and southeast Asia.

===Arts of Africa===
The oldest acquisitions in the African art collection were collected by the museum in 1900, shortly after the museum&#x27;s founding. The collection was expanded in 1922 with items originating largely in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The next year, the museum hosted one of the first exhibitions of African art in the United States.

The Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s African art collection includes more than 6,000 objects. The African art collection covers 2,500 years of human history and includes sculpture, jewelry, masks, and religious artifacts from more than 100 African cultures. Noteworthy items in this collection include a carved &quot;ndop&quot; figure of a Kuba king, believed to be among the oldest extant &quot;ndop&quot; carvings, and a Lulua mother-and-child figure.

In 2018, the museum drew criticism from groups including Decolonize This Place for its hiring of a white woman as Consulting Curator of African Arts.

====Selections from the African collection====
===Arts of the Pacific Islands===
The museum&#x27;s collection of Pacific Islands art began in 1900 with the acquisition of 100 wooden figures and shadow puppets from New Guinea and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia); since that base, the collection has grown to encompass close to 5,000 works. Art in this collection is sourced to numerous Pacific and Indian Ocean islands including Hawaii and New Zealand, as well as less-populous islands such as Rapa Nui and Vanuatu. Many of the Marquesan items in the collection were acquired by the museum from famed Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl.

Art objects in this collection are crafted from a wide variety of materials. The museum lists &quot;coconut fiber, feathers, shells, clay, bone, human hair, wood, moss, and spider webs&quot; as among the materials used to make artworks that include masks, tapa cloths, sculpture, and jewelry.

===Arts of the Islamic world===
The museum also has art objects and historical texts produced by Muslim artists or about Muslim figures and cultures.

====Selections from the Islamic world collection====
===The Jarvis Collection of Native American Plains Art===
The Museum has a collection of Native America Artifacts acquired by Dr. Nathan Sturges Jarvis (surgeon) who was stationed at Fort Snelling, Minnesota 1833–1836.

===Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art===

The museum&#x27;s center for feminist art opened in 2007. Spanning , it is dedicated to preserving the history of the movement since the late 20th century, as well as raising awareness of feminist contributions to art, and informing the future of this area of artistic dialogue. Along with an exhibition space and library, the center features a gallery housing a masterwork by Judy Chicago, a large installation called &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; (1974–1979).

===European art===
The Brooklyn Museum has among others late Gothic and Early Italian Renaissance paintings by Lorenzo di Niccolo (&quot;Scenes from the life of Saint Lawrence&quot;), Sano di Pietro, Nardo di Cione, Lorenzo Monaco, Donato de&#x27; Bardi (&quot;Saint Jerome&quot;), Giovanni Bellini. It has Dutch paintings by Frans Hals, Gerard Dou, and Thomas de Keyser as well as others. It has 19th-century French paintings by Charles Daubigny, Narcisse Virgilio Díaz, Eugène Boudin (&quot;Port, Le Havre&quot;), Berthe Morisot, Edgar Degas, Gustave Caillebotte (&quot;Railway Bridge at Argenteuil&quot;), Claude Monet (&quot;Doges Palace, Venice&quot;), the French sculptor Alfred Barye, Camille Pissarro, and Paul Cézanne as well as many others.

====Selections from the European collection====
=== Other collections ===
The museum&#x27;s costume collection was created in 1946, and the Textile and Costume Collection was unveiled in 1977. The collection, composed of American and European attire, was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;one of the best in the world&quot;. Removed from public display in 1991, the collection was transferred to the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s Costume Institute in 2008.

The Brooklyn Museum has had a photography collection since the 19th century. The museum initially did not seek out photographs for its collection, which was initially composed exclusively of photographers&#x27; and collectors&#x27; gifts. Since 1993, the collection has been part of the Department of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs.

The museum&#x27;s Steinberg Family Sculpture Garden has salvaged architectural elements from throughout New York City. The sculpture garden dates from 1966 and includes objects such as the Bayard–Condict Building&#x27;s capitals and the sculptures at the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn entrance.

==Libraries and archives==

The Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives hold approximately 300,000 volumes and over of archives. The collection began in 1823 and is housed in facilities that underwent renovations in 1965, 1984 and 2014.

==Programs==
The first Saturday of each month, the Brooklyn Museum stays open until 11pm, and general admission is waived after 5pm, although some ticketed exhibitions may require an entrance fee. Regular first Saturday activities include educational family-oriented activities such as collection-based art workshops, gallery tours, lectures, live performances dance parties. The museum started hosting First Saturdays in October 1998, and the event had attracted 1.5 million total visitors .

As part of the Museum Apprentice Program, the museum hires teenage high schoolers to give tours in the museum&#x27;s galleries during the summer, assist with the museum&#x27;s weekend family programs throughout the year, participate in talks with museum curators, serve as a teen advisory board to the museum, and help plan teen events. The museum also runs the Museum Education Fellowship Program, a ten-month position where fellows lead school group visits with a focus on various topics from the collection. School Youth and Family Fellows teach Gallery Studio Programs and School Partnerships while Adult and Public Programs Fellows curate and organize Thursday night as well as First Saturday Programming.

The museum has posted many pieces to a digital collection that allows the public to tag and curate sets of objects online, as well as solicit additional scholarship contributions. The museum&#x27;s ASK App allows visitors to talk with staff and educators about works in the collection.

==Attendance==
Prior to World War II, the museum offered free admission and regularly attracted over a million annual visitors. In 1934, the museum reported 940,000 annual visitors, while its library had 40,000 visitors. Patronage declined along with Brooklyn&#x27;s economy in the mid-20th century; there were about 470,000 visitors per year by the early 1950s. The museum recorded 1 million visitors in 1971 for the first time in almost four decades. During the mid-1980s, the museum had 300,000 visitors per year, much less than the Museum of Modern Art or the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan. Annual attendance at the museum, which had stagnated at 250,000 in the mid-1990s, had nearly doubled by 1999 after the museum held several popular exhibits, peaking at 585,000 in 1998. The museum only had 326,000 visitors by 2009, but attendance had increased to 465,000 by 2017.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; attributed the drop in attendance partially to the policies instituted by then-current director Arnold Lehman, who has chosen to focus the museum&#x27;s energy on &quot;populism&quot;, with exhibits on topics such as &quot;Star Wars movies and hip-hop music&quot; rather than on more classical art topics. Lehman had also brought more controversial exhibits, such as a 1999 show that included Chris Ofili&#x27;s infamous dung-decorated &quot;The Holy Virgin Mary&quot;, to the museum. According to the &quot;Times&quot;:

The quality of their exhibitions has lessened&quot;, said Robert Storr, the dean of the Yale University School of Art and a Brooklynite. &quot;″&quot;Star Wars&quot;″ shows the worst kind of populism. I don&#x27;t think they really understand where they are. The middle of the art world is now in Brooklyn; it&#x27;s an increasingly sophisticated audience and always was one. 

On the other hand, Lehman says that the demographics of museum attendees are showing a new level of diversity. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;the average age [of museum attendees in a 2008 survey] was 35, a large portion of the visitors (40 percent) came from Brooklyn, and more than 40 percent identified themselves as people of color.&quot; Lehman states that the museum&#x27;s interest is in being welcoming and attractive to all potential museum attendees, rather than simply amassing large numbers of them.

, the Brooklyn Museum has a pay what you want policy for general-admission tickets. Half of patrons did not pay any admission in 2017.

<text>Kathryn Patricia &quot;Kay&quot; Hire (born August 26, 1959) is a former NASA astronaut and Captain in the U.S. Navy Reserve who has flown aboard two Space Shuttle missions.

== Education ==
Born in Mobile, Alabama, she attended St. Pius X Catholic Elementary School and Murphy High School. She received her Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering and Management from the United States Naval Academy in 1981 and her Master of Science degree in Space Technology from the Florida Institute of Technology in 1991.

== Experience ==

=== Navy experience ===
After earning her Naval Flight Officer wings in October 1982, Hire conducted worldwide airborne oceanographic research missions with Oceanographic Development Squadron Eight (VXN-8) based at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. She flew as Oceanographic Project Coordinator, Mission Commander and Detachment Officer-in-Charge on board specially configured RP-3A and RP-3D Orion aircraft.

Hire later instructed student naval flight officers while assigned to Naval Air Training Unit Mather (NAVAIRTU Mather), a tenant command associated with the 323d Flying Training Wing at Mather Air Force Base, California. While assigned to NAVAIRTU Mather, Hire progressed from Navigation Instructor and Course Manager to Curriculum Manager while concurrently assigned as a navigator flight instructor in the USAF T-43A aircraft.

In January 1989, Hire resigned her Regular Navy commission and left active duty, accepting a Reserve commission and joining the Naval Reserve at NAS Jacksonville, Florida. Her initial tours of duty included Patrol Squadron Augment Unit VP-0545 and Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Center 0574 and 0374.

Following the repeal of the Title 10 U.S.C. combat aircraft restriction for female military aviators in 1993, Hire was the first female in the U.S. military assigned to a combat aircrew, reporting to Patrol Squadron Sixty-Two (VP-62) on May 13, 1993, as a Navigator/Communicator flying the P-3C Update III Orion maritime patrol aircraft. VP-62 was also based at NAS Jacksonville and Hire routinely deployed for flight operations throughout the North Atlantic, Europe, and the Caribbean.

Hire later served with Detachment 0482, Tactical Support Center 0682, U.S. Seventh Fleet Detachment 111, and U.S. Naval Forces Central Command Detachment 108. Recalled to full-time active military duty from 2001 to 2003, Hire supported Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom as a member of the Headquarters, U.S. Central Command Current Operations and Joint Operations Center (JOC) staffs at MacDill AFB, Florida during Operation Enduring Freedom, followed by reassignment to the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command/U.S. Fifth Fleet staff for Operation Iraqi Freedom. She was promoted to her current rank of captain in the U.S. Navy on December 1, 2002.

=== NASA experience ===
Hire began work at the Kennedy Space Center in May 1989, first as an Orbiter Processing Facility 3 Activation Engineer and later as a Space Shuttle Orbiter Mechanical Systems Engineer for Lockheed Space Operations Company. In 1991 she was certified as a Space Shuttle Test Project Engineer (TPE) and headed the checkout of the Extravehicular Mobility Units (spacesuits) and Russian Orbiter Docking System. She was assigned as Supervisor of Space Shuttle Orbiter Mechanisms and Launch Pad Swing Arms in 1994.

Selected by NASA in December 1994, Hire reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995. After a year of training, she worked in mission control as a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM). Hire flew as Mission Specialist-2 on STS-90 Neurolab (1998) and logged over 381 hours in space. She served as the Astronaut Office Lead for Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), Shuttle Payloads, and Flight Crew Equipment. Hire was assigned to the Astronaut Support Personnel (ASP) team for Kennedy Space Center Operations. She then journeyed to the International Space Station as a mission specialist for Space Shuttle mission STS-130.

=== Space flight experience ===
STS-90 Neurolab (April 17 – May 3, 1998). During the 16-day Spacelab flight, the seven-member crew aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; served as both experimental subjects and operators for 26 life science experiments focusing on the effects of microgravity on the brain and nervous system. The STS-90 flight orbited the Earth 256 times and covered 6.3 million miles.

STS-130 (February 8, 2010 – February 21, 2010) She also journeyed to the International Space Station as a mission specialist for Space Shuttle mission STS-130.

As of June 2018, Hire was considered a &quot;NASA Management Astronaut&quot;, which meant that she was employed at NASA but was no longer eligible for spaceflight assignments.

On February 28, 2019, Hire retired from NASA.

<text>Psoralea is a genus in the legume family (Fabaceae) with 111 species of shrubs, trees, and herbs native to southern and eastern Africa, ranging from Kenya to South Africa. In South Africa they are commonly referred to as fountainbush (English); fonteinbos, bloukeur, or penwortel (Afrikaans); and umHlonishwa (Zulu).

== Etymology ==
The name ‘&quot;Psoralea’&quot; is derived from the Greek term ‘&quot;Psoraleos’&quot;, which means “affected with itch or with leprosy”. Psoralen occurs naturally in the seeds of &quot;Psoralea corylifolia&quot;, and is used in PUVA (psoralen + UVA) treatment, for several diseases including such as psoriasis.

<text>Chief Warrant Officer 4 Thomas John Hennen (born August 17, 1952) is a United States Army warrant officer and NASA payload specialist astronaut who flew aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-44 as a payload specialist.

==Personal==
Hennen was born on August 17, 1952, in Albany, Georgia. As an Air Force dependent, he was literally raised all over the world. He now lives in Houston, Texas. Tom is married to the former Sherri Wise of Houston. Together, they have six children: Kristopher, Jessie, Karl, Kyle, Kendall, and Karli, as well as six grandchildren: Mila, Hunter, Elijah, Christian, Isaiah and Kennedy. His father, Chief Master Sergeant Carl H. Hennen (USAF) and his mother, Antoinette L. (Ferrera) Hennen are both deceased.

==Education==
Hennen graduated from Groveport-Madison High School in Groveport, Ohio in 1970. He attended Urbana College in Urbana, Ohio from 1970–1972 on both an academic and athletic scholarship.

==Military career==
Mr. Hennen was the first Warrant Officer within the U.S. Army and Department of Defense to have been selected as a member of a NASA Space Shuttle flight crew.

Tom entered the U.S. Army in 1972 and served over 23 years in the Imagery Intelligence (IMIMT)field. During his career, he received extensive technical training and experience as an operational imagery analyst at both the tactical and national intelligence levels. His experience as an instructor, training, force, and combat developer and his extensive material development and acquisition management experience combined to make him one of the most qualified IMINT technicians within the Department of Defense (DoD).

From 1973 to 1975, he was assigned to the 163rd Military Intelligence Battalion, Fort Hood, Texas. During this assignment he participated in the planning, development, and conduct of major operational and force development tests and evaluations in direct support of U.S. Army and III Corps combat requirements. A small sample of these tests included: the evaluation of the effectiveness of various firing methodologies of the AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter; the testing and evaluation of new camouflage netting, uniforms, and painted vehicles now in use throughout the Army; the initial U.S. Army Remotely piloted vehicle testing; phosphorus smoke tests; antenna mast tests; and heat loss/energy conservation tests.

During 1976 through 1978, Hennen was assigned to the 203rd Military Intelligence Detachment. While there he served as Operations NCO and the Chief of both the Tactical and Strategic Exploitation Divisions, which provided imagery collection, exploitation, and intelligence support to the 1st Cavalry Division, the 2nd Armored Division, the 6th Armored Cavalry Regiment, and Headquarters III Corps.

From 1978 to 1981, Mr. Hennen was assigned to 497th Reconnaissance Technical Group in Schierstein, Germany. This assignment was in direct support to the office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Headquarters United States Air Forces in Europe. As a senior imagery analyst, the information derived from Mister Hennen&#x27;s analysis altered and enhanced intelligence estimates and updated the enemy threat assessment against Western European and North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, which proved critical to the continued mission effectiveness of the United States Air Forces in Europe, the United States Army Europe, and the United States European Command. 

Hennen was assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence Center, Fort Huachuca, Arizona, from 1981 through 1986. He was the project officer for the Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) Tactical Exploitation of National Space Capabilities Program (TENCAP), responsible for developing all training requirements, concepts and doctrine. His efforts culminated in the production of multimillion-dollar training programs which in turn supported the fielding of a variety of new systems operating at both the tactical and national intelligence levels. During this assignment, Hennen was appointed as the Department of the Army IMINT subject matter expert (SME). He developed and managed major projects for the Office of the Secretary of Defense; authored the U.S. Army Radar Training Plan; participated in the development of the TENCAP Systems Management Model; was selected as a member of a Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) team that developed the Joint Space Intelligence and Operations Course; and he represented the U.S. Army on the DIA Intelligence Training Equipment Subcommittee.

In 1986, Hennen was selected by the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center to represent him within the U.S. Army Space Program Office (ASPO) in Washington, D.C. for those matters pertaining to TENCAP requirements, concept development, and the doctrinal and operational employment of TENCAP systems. Additionally, he participated in various Army, DOD, and National Intelligence Community working groups and subcommittees involved in TENCAP program activities. Hennen was personally responsible for managing the development and successful fielding of state-of-the-art IMINT systems to both the European and Pacific theaters of operations. Chief Hennen&#x27;s efforts at ASPO were instrumental in the efficient evolution of five major TENCAP systems with a Life Cycle Cost in excess of 2 billion US dollars. These systems continue to provide critical and timely intelligence in support of the requirements of the tactical commander on the extended battlefield.

== Astronaut career ==
Hennen was selected as a Payload Specialist candidate in September 1988 and moved back to the &quot;Home of Military Intelligence&quot;, Fort Huachuca, Arizona, during March 1989 to begin Terra Scout payload operations training. During August 1989 he was selected as the primary Payload Specialist for the Terra Scout experiment manifested on STS-44 and he reported to NASA in 1990 to begin NASA Payload Specialist and Space Shuttle Crew Training.

Hennen became the first warrant officer in space, flying aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; (STS-44), which launched from Kennedy Space Center Pad 39A at 6:44 PM (EST), November 24, 1991. He orbited the Earth 109 times, traveling 2.9 million miles (4.7 million km), before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California on December 1, 1991.

Hennen retired from the U.S. Army in December 1995. In 1996 he co-founded and served as the Executive Director of the Atlantis Foundation until 2017. The Atlantis Foundation was a non-profit organization that was both an advocate and a service provider for persons with developmental disabilities.

==Awards and honors==
Mr. Hennen&#x27;s Awards and Honors include: Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal with oak leaf cluster, NASA Space Flight Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Armed Forces Space and Missile Badge (Senior Level), Army Aviation Badge with Astronaut Device and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with oak leaf cluster. Mr. Hennen also received the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Corps Knowlton Award.

Hennen was selected on numerous occasions as Soldier and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) of the Quarter/Year by the various commands and agencies to which he was assigned during his enlisted career.

CW4(R) Hennen was inducted into the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Hall of Fame on June 24, 2022.

<text>Life cycle assessment (LCA), also known as life cycle analysis, is a methodology for assessing environmental impacts associated with all the stages of the life cycle of a commercial product, process, or service. For instance, in the case of a manufactured product, environmental impacts are assessed from raw material extraction and processing (cradle), through the product&#x27;s manufacture, distribution and use, to the recycling or final disposal of the materials composing it (grave).

An LCA study involves a thorough inventory of the energy and materials that are required across the supply chain and value chain of a product, process or service, and calculates the corresponding emissions to the environment. LCA thus assesses cumulative potential environmental impacts. The aim is to document and improve the overall environmental profile of the product by serving as a holistic baseline upon which carbon footprints can be accurately compared.

The LCA method is based on ISO 14040 (2006) and ISO 14044 (2006) standards. Widely recognized procedures for conducting LCAs are included in the ISO 14000 series of environmental management standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), in particular, in ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. ISO 14040 provides the &#x27;principles and framework&#x27; of the Standard, while ISO 14044 provides an outline of the &#x27;requirements and guidelines&#x27;. Generally, ISO 14040 was written for a managerial audience and ISO 14044 for practitioners. As part of the introductory section of ISO 14040, LCA has been defined as the following:LCA studies the environmental aspects and potential impacts throughout a product&#x27;s life cycle (i.e., cradle-to-grave) from raw materials acquisition through production, use and disposal. The general categories of environmental impacts needing consideration include resource use, human health, and ecological consequences.Criticisms have been leveled against the LCA approach, both in general and with regard to specific cases (e.g., in the consistency of the methodology, the difficulty in performing, the cost in performing, revealing of intellectual property, and the understanding of system boundaries). When the understood methodology of performing an LCA is not followed, it can be completed based on a practitioner&#x27;s views or the economic and political incentives of the sponsoring entity (an issue plaguing all known data-gathering practices). In turn, an LCA completed by 10 different parties could yield 10 different results. The ISO LCA Standard aims to normalize this; however, the guidelines are not overly restrictive and 10 different answers may still be generated.

==Definition, synonyms, goals, and purpose==
Life cycle assessment (LCA) is sometimes referred to synonymously as life cycle analysis in the scholarly and agency report literatures. Also, due to the general nature of an LCA study of examining the life cycle impacts from raw material extraction (cradle) through disposal (grave), it is sometimes referred to as &quot;cradle-to-grave analysis&quot;.

As stated by the National Risk Management Research Laboratory of the EPA, &quot;LCA is a technique to assess the environmental aspects and potential impacts associated with a product, process, or service, by:
* Compiling an inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental releases
* Evaluating the potential environmental impacts associated with identified inputs and releases
* Interpreting the results to help you make a more informed decision&quot;.

Hence, it is a technique to assess environmental impacts associated with all the stages of a product&#x27;s life from raw material extraction through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling. The results are used to help decision-makers select products or processes that result in the least impact to the environment by considering an entire product system and avoiding sub-optimization that could occur if only a single process were used.

Therefore, the goal of LCA is to compare the full range of environmental effects assignable to products and services by quantifying all inputs and outputs of material flows and assessing how these material flows affect the environment. This information is used to improve processes, support policy and provide a sound basis for informed decisions.

The term &quot;life cycle&quot; refers to the notion that a fair, holistic assessment requires the assessment of raw-material production, manufacture, distribution, use and disposal including all intervening transportation steps necessary or caused by the product&#x27;s existence.

Despite attempts to standardize LCA, results from different LCAs are often contradictory, therefore it is unrealistic to expect these results to be unique and objective. Thus, it should not be considered as such, but rather as a family of methods attempting to quantify results through different points-of-view. Among these methods are two main types: Attributional LCA and Consequential LCA. Attributional LCAs seek to attribute the burdens associated with the production and use of a product, or with a specific service or process, for an identified temporal period. Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences of a decision or a proposed change in a system under study, and thus are oriented to the future and require that market and economic implications must be taken into account. In other words, Attributional LCA &quot;attempts to answer &#x27;how are things (i.e. pollutants, resources, and exchanges among processes) flowing within the chosen temporal window?&#x27;, while Consequential LCA attempts to answer &#x27;how will flows beyond the immediate system change in response to decisions?&quot;

A third type of LCA, termed &quot;social LCA&quot;, is also under development and is a distinct approach to that is intended to assess potential social and socio-economic implications and impacts. Social life cycle assessment (SLCA) is a useful tool for companies to identify and assess potential social impacts along the lifecycle of a product or service on various stakeholders (for example: workers, local communities, consumers). SLCA is framed by the UNEP/SETAC’s Guidelines for social life cycle assessment of products published in 2009 in Quebec. The tool builds on the ISO 26000:2010 Guidelines for Social Responsibility and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines.

The limitations of LCA to focus solely on the ecological aspects of sustainability, and not the economical or social aspects, distinguishes it from product line analysis (PLA) and similar methods. This limitation was made deliberately to avoid method overload but recognizes these factors should not be ignored when making product decisions.

Some widely recognized procedures for LCA are included in the ISO 14000 series of environmental management standards, in particular, ISO 14040 and 14044. Greenhouse gas (GHG) product life cycle assessments can also comply with specifications such as Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 2050 and the GHG Protocol Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard.

==Main ISO phases of LCA==
According to standards in the ISO 14040 and 14044, an LCA is carried out in four distinct phases, as illustrated in the figure shown at the above right (at opening of the article). The phases are often interdependent, in that the results of one phase will inform how other phases are completed. Therefore, none of the stages should be considered finalized until the entire study is complete.

===Goal and scope===
An LCA study begins with a goal and scope definition phase, which includes the product function, functional unit, product system and its boundaries, assumptions, data categories, allocation procedures, and review method to be employed in the analysis. The ISO LCA Standard requires a series of parameters to be quantitatively and qualitatively expressed, which are occasionally referred to as study design parameters (SPDs). The two main SPDs for an LCA are the goal and scope, both which must be explicitly stated.

Generally, an LCA study starts with a clear statement of its goal, outlining the study&#x27;s context and detailing how and to whom the results will be communicated. Per ISO guidelines, the goal must unambiguously state the following items:

# The intended application
# Reasons for carrying out the study
# The audience
# Whether the results will be used in a comparative assertion released publicly

The goal should also be defined with the commissioner for the study, and it is recommended a detailed description for why the study is being carried out is acquired from the commissioner.

Following the goal, the scope must be defined by outlining the qualitative and quantitative information included in the study. Unlike the goal, which may only include a few sentences, the scope often requires multiple pages. It is set to describe the detail and depth of the study and demonstrate that the goal can be achieved within the stated limitations. Under the ISO LCA Standard guidelines, the scope of the study should outline the following:
* Product system, which is a collection of processes (activities that transform inputs to outputs) that are needed to perform a specified function and are within the system boundary of the study. It is representative of all the processes in the life cycle of a product or process.
* Functional unit, which defines precisely what is being studied, quantifies the service delivered by the system, provides a reference to which the inputs and outputs can be related, and provides a basis for comparing/analyzing alternative goods or services. The functional unit is a very important component of LCA and needs to be clearly defined. It is used as a basis for selecting one or more product systems that can provide the function. Therefore, the functional unit enables different systems to be treated as functionally equivalent. The defined functional unit should be quantifiable, include units, consider temporal coverage, and not contain product system inputs and outputs (e.g., kg emissions). Another way to look at it is by considering the following questions:
*# What?
*# How much?
*# For how long / how many times?
*# Where?
*# How well?
* Reference flow, which is the amount of product or energy that is needed to realize the functional unit. Typically, the reference flow is different qualitatively and quantitatively for different products or systems across the same reference flow; however, there are instances where they can be the same.
* System boundary, which delimits which processes should be included in the analysis of a product system, including whether the system produces any co-products that must be accounted for by system expansion or allocation. The system boundary should be in accordance with the stated goal of the study.
* Assumptions and limitations, which includes any assumptions or decisions made throughout the study that may influence the final results. It is important these are made transmitted as the omittance may result in misinterpretation of the results. Additional assumptions and limitations necessary to accomplish the project are often made throughout the project and should recorded as necessary.
* Data quality requirements, which specify the kinds of data that will be included and what restrictions. According to ISO 14044, the following data quality considerations should be documented in the scope:
*# Temporal coverage
*# Geographical coverage
*# Technological coverage
*# Precision, completeness, and representativeness of the data
*# Consistency and reproducibility of the methods used in the study
*# Sources of data
*# Uncertainty of information and any recognized data gaps
* Allocation procedure, which is used to partition the inputs and outputs of a product and is necessary for processes that produce multiple products, or co-products. This is also known as multifunctionality of a product system. ISO 14044 presents a hierarchy of solutions to deal with multifunctionality issues, as the choice of allocation method for co-products can significantly impact results of an LCA. The hierarchy methods are as follows:
*# Avoid Allocation by Sub-Division - this method attempts to disaggregate the unit process into smaller sub-processes in order to separate the production of the product from the production of the co-product.
*# Avoid Allocation through System Expansion (or substitution) - this method attempts to expand the process of the co-product with the most likely way of providing the secondary function of the determining product (or reference product). In other words, by expanding the system of the co-product in the most likely alternative way of producing the co-product independently (System 2). The impacts resulting from the alternative way of producing the co-product (System 2) are then subtracted from the determining product to isolate the impacts in System 1.
*# Allocation (or partition) based on Physical Relationship - this method attempts to divide inputs and outputs and allocate them based on physical relationships between the products (e.g., mass, energy-use, etc.).
*# Allocation (or partition) based on Other Relationship (non-physical) - this method attempts to divide inputs and outputs and allocate them based on non-physical relationships (e.g., economic value).
* Impact assessment, which includes an outline of the impact categories identified under interest for the study, and the selected methodology used to calculate the respective impacts. Specifically, life cycle inventory data is translated into environmental impact scores, which might include such categories as human toxicity, smog, global warming, and eutrophication. As part of the scope, only an overview needs to be provided, as the main analysis on the impact categories is discussed in the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) phase of the study.
* Documentation of data, which is the explicit documentation of the inputs/outputs (individual flows) used within the study. This is necessary as most analyses do not consider all inputs and outputs of a product system, so this provides the audience with a transparent representation of the selected data. It also provides transparency for why the system boundary, product system, functional unit, etc. was chosen.

===Life cycle inventory (LCI)===
Life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis involves creating an inventory of flows from and to nature (ecosphere) for a product system. It is the process of quantifying raw material and energy requirements, atmospheric emissions, land emissions, water emissions, resource uses, and other releases over the life cycle of a product or process. In other words, it is the aggregation of all elementary flows related to each unit process within a product system.

To develop the inventory, it is often recommended to start with a flow model of the technical system using data on inputs and outputs of the product system. The flow model is typically illustrated with a flow diagram that includes the activities that are going to be assessed in the relevant supply chain and gives a clear picture of the technical system boundaries. Generally, the more detailed and complex the flow diagram, the more accurate the study and results. The input and output data needed for the construction of the model is collected for all activities within the system boundary, including from the supply chain (referred to as inputs from the technosphere).

According to ISO 14044, an LCI should be documented using the following steps:

# Preparation of data collection based on goal and scope
# Data collection
# Data validation (even if using another work&#x27;s data)
# Data allocation (if needed)
# Relating data to the unit process
# Relating data to the functional unit
# Data aggregation

As referenced in the ISO 14044 standard, the data must be related to the functional unit, as well as the goal and scope. However, since the LCA stages are iterative in nature, the data collection phase may cause the goal or scope to change. Conversely, a change in the goal or scope during the course of the study may cause additional collection of data or removal of previously collected data in the LCI.

The output of an LCI is a compiled inventory of elementary flows from all of the processes in the studied product system(s). The data is typically detailed in charts and requires a structured approach due to its complex nature.

When collecting the data for each process within the system boundary, the ISO LCA standard requires the study to measure or estimate the data in order to quantitatively represent each process in the product system. Ideally, when collecting data, a practitioner should aim to collect data from primary sources (e.g., measuring inputs and outputs of a process on-site or other physical means). Questionnaire are frequently used to collect data on-site and can even be issued to the respective manufacturer or company to complete. Items on the questionnaire to be recorded may include:

# Product for data collection
# Data collector and date
# Period of data collection
# Detailed explanation of the process
# Inputs (raw materials, ancillary materials, energy, transportation)
# Outputs (emissions to air, water, and land)
# Quantity and quality of each input and output

Oftentimes, the collection of primary data may be difficult and deemed proprietary or confidential by the owner. An alternative to primary data is secondary data, which is data that comes from LCA databases, literature sources, and other past studies. With secondary sources, it is often you find data that is similar to a process but not exact (e.g., data from a different country, slightly different process, similar but different machine, etc.). As such, it is important to explicitly document the differences in such data. However, secondary data is not always inferior to primary data. For example, referencing another work&#x27;s data in which the author used very accurate primary data. Along with primary data, secondary data should document the source, reliability, and temporal, geographical, and technological representativeness.

When identifying the inputs and outputs to document for each unit process within the product system of an LCI, a practitioner may come across the instance where a process has multiple input streams or generate multiple output streams. In such case, the practitioner should allocate the flows based on the &quot;Allocation procedure&quot; outlined in the previous &quot;Goal and scope&quot; section of this article.

The technosphere is more simply defined as the human-made world, and considered by geologists as secondary resources, these resources are in theory 100% recyclable; however, in a practical sense, the primary goal is salvage. For an LCI, these technosphere products (supply chain products) are those that have been produced by humans, including products such as forestry, materials, and energy flows. Typically, they will not have access to data concerning inputs and outputs for previous production processes of the product. The entity undertaking the LCA must then turn to secondary sources if it does not already have that data from its own previous studies. National databases or data sets that come with LCA-practitioner tools, or that can be readily accessed, are the usual sources for that information. Care must then be taken to ensure that the secondary data source properly reflects regional or national conditions.

LCI methods include &quot;process-based LCAs&quot;, economic input–output LCA (EIOLCA), and hybrid approaches. Process-based LCA is a bottom-up LCI approach the constructs an LCI using knowledge about industrial processes within the life cycle of a product, and the physical flows connecting them. EIOLCA is a top-down approach to LCI and uses information on elementary flows associated with one unit of economic activity across different sectors. This information is typically pulled from government agency national statistics tracking trade and services between sectors. Hybrid LCA is a combination of process-based LCA and EIOLCA.

The quality of LCI data is typically evaluated with the use of a pedigree matrix. Different pedigree matrices are available, but all contain a number of data quality indicators and a set of qualitative criteria per indicator. There is another hybrid approach integrates the widely used, semi-quantitative approach that uses a pedigree matrix, into a qualitative analysis to better illustrate the quality of LCI data for non-technical audiences, in particular policymakers.

===Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA)===
Life cycle inventory analysis is followed by a life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). This phase of LCA is aimed at evaluating the potential environmental and human health impacts resulting from the elementary flows determined in the LCI. The ISO 14040 and 14044 standards require the following mandatory steps for completing an LCIA:

Mandatory
* Selection of impaction categories, category indicators, and characterization models. The ISO Standard requires that a study selects multiple impacts that encompass &quot;a comprehensive set of environmental issues&quot;. The impacts should be relevant to the geographical region of the study and justification for each chosen impact should be discussed. Often times in practice, this is completed by choosing an already existing LCIA method (e.g., TRACI, ReCiPe, AWARE, Eco-costs etc.).
* Classification of inventory results. In this step, the LCI results are assigned to the chosen impact categories based on their known environmental effects. In practice, this is often completed using LCI databases or LCA software. Common impact categories include Global Warming, Ozone Depletion, Acidification, Human Toxicity, etc.
* Characterization, which quantitatively transforms the LCI results within each impact category via &quot;characterization factors&quot; (also referred to as equivalency factors) to create &quot;impact category indicators.&quot; In other words, this step is aimed at answering &quot;how much does each result contribute to the impact category?&quot; A main purpose of this step is to convert all classified flows for an impact into common units for comparison. For example, for Global Warming Potential, the unit is generally defined as CO2-equiv or CO2-e (CO2 equivalents) where CO2 is given a value of 1 and all other units are converted respective to their related impact.

In many LCAs, characterization concludes the LCIA analysis, as it is the last compulsory stage according to ISO 14044. However, the ISO Standard provides the following optional steps to be taken in addition to the aforementioned mandatory steps:

Optional
* Normalization of results. This step aims to answer &quot;Is that a lot?&quot; by expressing the LCIA results in respect to a chosen reference system. A separate reference value is often chosen for each impact category, and the rationale for the step is to provide temporal and spatial perspective and to help validate the LCIA results. Standard references are typical impacts per impact category per: geographical zone, inhabitant of geographical zone (per person), industrial sector, or another product system or baseline reference scenario.
* Grouping of LCIA results. This step is accomplished by sorting or ranking the LCIA results (either characterized or normalized depending on the prior steps chosen) into a single group or several groups as defined within the goal and scope. However, grouping is subjective and may be inconsistent across studies.
* Weighting of impact categories. This step aims to determine the significance of each category and how important it is relative to the others. It allows studies to aggregate impact scores into a single indicator for comparison. Weighting is highly subjective and as it is often decided based on the interested parties&#x27; ethics. There are three main categories of weighting methods: the panel method, monetization method, and target method. ISO 14044 generally advises against weighting, stating that &quot;weighting, shall not be used in LCA studies intended to be used in comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public&quot;. If a study decides to weight results, then the weighted results should always be reported together with the non-weighted results for transparency.

Life cycle impacts can also be categorized under the several phases of the development, production, use, and disposal of a product. Broadly speaking, these impacts can be divided into first impacts, use impacts, and end of life impacts. First impacts include extraction of raw materials, manufacturing (conversion of raw materials into a product), transportation of the product to a market or site, construction/installation, and the beginning of the use or occupancy. Use impacts include physical impacts of operating the product or facility (such as energy, water, etc.), and any maintenance, renovation, or repairs that are required to continue to use the product or facility. End of life impacts include demolition and processing of waste or recyclable materials.

===Interpretation===
Life cycle interpretation is a systematic technique to identify, quantify, check, and evaluate information from the results of the life cycle inventory and/or the life cycle impact assessment. The results from the inventory analysis and impact assessment are summarized during the interpretation phase. The outcome of the interpretation phase is a set of conclusions and recommendations for the study. According to ISO 14043, the interpretation should include the following:
* Identification of significant issues based on the results of the LCI and LCIA phases of an LCA
* Evaluation of the study considering completeness, sensitivity and consistency checks
* Conclusions, limitations and recommendations

A key purpose of performing life cycle interpretation is to determine the level of confidence in the final results and communicate them in a fair, complete, and accurate manner. Interpreting the results of an LCA is not as simple as &quot;3 is better than 2, therefore Alternative A is the best choice&quot;. Interpretation begins with understanding the accuracy of the results, and ensuring they meet the goal of the study. This is accomplished by identifying the data elements that contribute significantly to each impact category, evaluating the sensitivity of these significant data elements, assessing the completeness and consistency of the study, and drawing conclusions and recommendations based on a clear understanding of how the LCA was conducted and the results were developed.

Specifically, as voiced by M.A. Curran, the goal of the LCA interpretation phase is to identify the alternative that has the least cradle-to-grave environmental negative impact on land, sea, and air resources.

==LCA uses==
LCA was primarily used as a comparison tool, providing informative information on the environmental impacts of a product and comparing it to available alternatives. Its potential applications expanded to include marketing, product design, product development, strategic planning, consumer education, ecolabeling and government policy.

ISO specifies three types of classification in regard to standards and environmental labels:
* Type I environmental labelling requires a third-party certification process to verify a products compliance against a set of criteria, according to ISO 14024.
* Type II environmental labels are self-declared environmental claims, according to ISO 14021.
* Type III environmental declaration, also known as environmental product declaration (EPD), uses LCA as a tool to report the environmental performance of a product, while conforming to the ISO standards 14040 and 14044.
EPDs provide a level of transparency that is being increasingly demanded through policies and standards around the world. They are used in the built environment as a tool for experts in the industry to compose whole building life cycle assessments more easily, as the environmental impact of individual products are known.

==Data analysis==
A life cycle analysis is only as accurate and valid as is its basis set of data. There are two fundamental types of LCA data–unit process data, and environmental input-output (EIO) data. A unit process data collects data around a single industrial activity and its product(s), including resources used from the environment and other industries, as well as its generated emissions throughout its life cycle. EIO data are based on national economic input-output data.

In 2001, ISO published a technical specification on data documentation, describing the format for life cycle inventory data (ISO 14048). The format includes three areas: process, modeling and validation, and administrative information.

When comparing LCAs, the data used in each LCA should be of &quot;equivalent&quot; quality, since no just comparison can be done if one product has a much higher availability of accurate and valid data, as compared to another product which has lower availability of such data.

Moreover, time horizon is a sensitive parameter and was shown to introduce inadvertent bias by providing one perspective on the outcome of LCA, when comparing the toxicity potential between petrochemicals and biopolymers for instance. Therefore, conducting sensitivity analysis in LCA are important to determine which parameters considerably impact the results, and can also be used to identify which parameters cause uncertainties.

Data sources used in LCAs are typically large databases. Common data sources include:

* HESTIA (University of Oxford)
* soca
* EuGeos&#x27; 15804-IA
* NEEDS
* CarbonCloud 
* ecoinvent
* IDEMAT
* PSILCA
* ESU World Food
* GaBi
* ELCD
* LC-Inventories.ch
* Social Hotspots
* ProBas
* bioenergiedat
* Agribalyse
* USDA
* Ökobaudat
* Agri-footprint
* Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive (CEDA)
As noted above, the inventory in the LCA usually considers a number of stages including materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. When an LCA is done on a product across all stages, the stage with the highest environmental impact can be determined and altered. For example, woolen-garment was evaluated on its environmental impacts during its production, use and end-of-life, and identified the contribution of fossil fuel energy to be dominated by wool processing and GHG emissions to be dominated by wool production. However, the most influential factor was the number of garment wear and length of garment lifetime, indicating that the consumer has the largest influence on this products&#x27; overall environmental impact.

==Variants==

===Cradle-to-grave or life cycle assessment ===
Cradle-to-grave is the full life cycle assessment from resource extraction (&#x27;cradle&#x27;), to manufacturing, usage, and maintenance, all the way through to its disposal phase (&#x27;grave&#x27;). For example, trees produce paper, which can be recycled into low-energy production cellulose (fiberised paper) insulation, then used as an energy-saving device in the ceiling of a home for 40 years, saving 2,000 times the fossil-fuel energy used in its production. After 40 years the cellulose fibers are replaced and the old fibers are disposed of, possibly incinerated. All inputs and outputs are considered for all the phases of the life cycle.

===Cradle-to-gate===
Cradle-to-gate is an assessment of a &quot;partial&quot; product life cycle from resource extraction (&quot;cradle&quot;) to the factory gate (i.e., before it is transported to the consumer). The use phase and disposal phase of the product are omitted in this case. Cradle-to-gate assessments are sometimes the basis for environmental product declarations (EPD) termed business-to-business EPDs. One of the significant uses of the cradle-to-gate approach compiles the life cycle inventory (LCI) using cradle-to-gate. This allows the LCA to collect all of the impacts leading up to resources being purchased by the facility. They can then add the steps involved in their transport to plant and manufacture process to more easily produce their own cradle-to-gate values for their products.

===Cradle-to-cradle or closed loop production===
Cradle-to-cradle is a specific kind of cradle-to-grave assessment, where the end-of-life disposal step for the product is a recycling process. It is a method used to minimize the environmental impact of products by employing sustainable production, operation, and disposal practices and aims to incorporate social responsibility into product development. From the recycling process originate new, identical products (e.g., asphalt pavement from discarded asphalt pavement, glass bottles from collected glass bottles), or different products (e.g., glass wool insulation from collected glass bottles).

Allocation of burden for products in open loop production systems presents considerable challenges for LCA. Various methods, such as the avoided burden approach have been proposed to deal with the issues involved.

===Gate-to-gate===
Gate-to-gate is a partial LCA looking at only one value-added process in the entire production chain. Gate-to-gate modules may also later be linked in their appropriate production chain to form a complete cradle-to-gate evaluation.

===Well-to-wheel===
Well-to-wheel (WtW) is the specific LCA used for transport fuels and vehicles. The analysis is often broken down into stages entitled &quot;well-to-station&quot;, or &quot;well-to-tank&quot;, and &quot;station-to-wheel&quot; or &quot;tank-to-wheel&quot;, or &quot;plug-to-wheel&quot;. The first stage, which incorporates the feedstock or fuel production and processing and fuel delivery or energy transmission, and is called the &quot;upstream&quot; stage, while the stage that deals with vehicle operation itself is sometimes called the &quot;downstream&quot; stage. The well-to-wheel analysis is commonly used to assess total energy consumption, or the energy conversion efficiency and emissions impact of marine vessels, aircraft and motor vehicles, including their carbon footprint, and the fuels used in each of these transport modes. WtW analysis is useful for reflecting the different efficiencies and emissions of energy technologies and fuels at both the upstream and downstream stages, giving a more complete picture of real emissions.

The well-to-wheel variant has a significant input on a model developed by the Argonne National Laboratory. The Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model was developed to evaluate the impacts of new fuels and vehicle technologies. The model evaluates the impacts of fuel use using a well-to-wheel evaluation while a traditional cradle-to-grave approach is used to determine the impacts from the vehicle itself. The model reports energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and six additional pollutants: volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), particulate matter with size smaller than 10 micrometer (PM10), particulate matter with size smaller than 2.5 micrometer (PM2.5), and sulfur oxides (SOx).

Quantitative values of greenhouse gas emissions calculated with the WTW or with the LCA method can differ, since the LCA is considering more emission sources. For example, while assessing the GHG emissions of a battery electric vehicle in comparison with a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle, the WTW (accounting only the GHG for manufacturing the fuels) concludes that an electric vehicle can save around 50–60% of GHG. On the other hand, using a hybrid LCA-WTW method, concludes that GHG emission savings are 10-13% lower than the WTW results, as the GHG due to the manufacturing and the end of life of the battery are also considered.

===Economic input–output life cycle assessment===
Economic input–output LCA (EIOLCA) involves use of aggregate sector-level data on how much environmental impact can be attributed to each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors. Such analysis can account for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of process LCA; however, EIOLCA relies on sector-level averages that may or may not be representative of the specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product and therefore is not suitable for evaluating the environmental impacts of products. Additionally, the translation of economic quantities into environmental impacts is not validated.

===Ecologically based LCA===
While a conventional LCA uses many of the same approaches and strategies as an Eco-LCA, the latter considers a much broader range of ecological impacts. It was designed to provide a guide to wise management of human activities by understanding the direct and indirect impacts on ecological resources and surrounding ecosystems. Developed by Ohio State University Center for resilience, Eco-LCA is a methodology that quantitatively takes into account regulating and supporting services during the life cycle of economic goods and products. In this approach services are categorized in four main groups: supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural services.

=== Exergy-based LCA ===
Exergy of a system is the maximum useful work possible during a process that brings the system into equilibrium with a heat reservoir. Wall clearly states the relation between exergy analysis and resource accounting. This intuition confirmed by DeWulf and Sciubba lead to Exergo-economic accounting and to methods specifically dedicated to LCA such as Exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS). The concept of material input per unit of service (MIPS) is quantified in terms of the second law of thermodynamics, allowing the calculation of both resource input and service output in exergy terms. This exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS) has been elaborated for transport technology. The service not only takes into account the total mass to be transported and the total distance, but also the mass per single transport and the delivery time.

==Life cycle energy analysis==

Life cycle energy analysis (LCEA) is an approach in which all energy inputs to a product are accounted for, not only direct energy inputs during manufacture, but also all energy inputs needed to produce components, materials and services needed for the manufacturing process. With LCEA, the &quot;total life cycle energy input&quot; is established.

===Energy production===

It is recognized that much energy is lost in the production of energy commodities themselves, such as nuclear energy, photovoltaic electricity or high-quality petroleum products. &quot;Net energy content&quot; is the energy content of the product minus energy input used during extraction and conversion, directly or indirectly. A controversial early result of LCEA claimed that manufacturing solar cells requires more energy than can be recovered in using the solar cell. Although these results were true when solar cells were first manufactured, their efficiency increased greatly over the years. Currently, energy payback time of photovoltaic solar panels range from a few months to several years. Module recycling could further reduce the energy payback time to around one month. Another new concept that flows from life cycle assessments is energy cannibalism. Energy cannibalism refers to an effect where rapid growth of an entire energy-intensive industry creates a need for energy that uses (or cannibalizes) the energy of existing power plants. Thus, during rapid growth, the industry as a whole produces no energy because new energy is used to fuel the embodied energy of future power plants. Work has been undertaken in the UK to determine the life cycle energy (alongside full LCA) impacts of a number of renewable technologies.

===Energy recovery===

If materials are incinerated during the disposal process, the energy released during burning can be harnessed and used for electricity production. This provides a low-impact energy source, especially when compared with coal and natural gas. While incineration produces more greenhouse gas emissions than landfills, the waste plants are well-fitted with regulated pollution control equipment to minimize this negative impact. A study comparing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from landfills (without energy recovery) against incineration (with energy recovery) found incineration to be superior in all cases except for when landfill gas is recovered for electricity production.

===Criticism===
Energy efficiency is arguably only one consideration in deciding which alternative process to employ, and should not be elevated as the only criterion for determining environmental acceptability. For example, a simple energy analysis does not take into account the renewability of energy flows or the toxicity of waste products. Incorporating &quot;dynamic LCAs&quot;, e.g., with regard to renewable energy technologies—which use sensitivity analyses to project future improvements in renewable systems and their share of the power grid—may help mitigate this criticism.

In recent years, the literature on life cycle assessment of energy technology has begun to reflect the interactions between the current electrical grid and future energy technology. Some papers have focused on energy life cycle, while others have focused on carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. The essential critique given by these sources is that when considering energy technology, the growing nature of the power grid must be taken into consideration. If this is not done, a given class energy technology may emit more CO2 over its lifetime than it initially thought it would mitigate, with this most well documented in wind energy&#x27;s case.

A problem that arises when using the energy analysis method is that different energy forms—heat, electricity, chemical energy etc.—have inconsistent functional units, different quality, and different values. This is due to the fact that the first law of thermodynamics measures the change in internal energy, whereas the second law measures entropy increase. Approaches such as cost analysis or exergy may be used as the metric for LCA, instead of energy.

== LCA dataset creation ==
There are structured systematic datasets of and for LCAs.

A 2022 dataset provided standardized calculated detailed environmental impacts of &gt;57,000 food products in supermarkets, potentially e.g., informing consumers or policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1073/pnas.2120584119&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There also is at least one crowdsourced database for collecting LCA data for food products.

Datasets can also consist of options, activities, or approaches, rather than of products – for example one dataset assesses PET bottle waste management options in Bauru, Brazil. There are also LCA databases about buildings – complex products – which a 2014 study compared.

=== LCA dataset platforms ===
There are some initiatives to develop, integrate, populate, standardize, quality control, combine and maintain such datasets or LCAs – for example:
* The goal of the LCA Digital Commons Project of the U.S. National Agricultural Library is &quot;to develop a database and tool set intended to provide data for use in LCAs of food, biofuels, and a variety of other bioproducts&quot;.
* The Global LCA Data Access network (GLAD) by the UN&#x27;s Life Cycle Initiative is a &quot;platform which allows to search, convert and download datasets from different life cycle assessment dataset providers&quot;.
* The BONSAI project &quot;aims to build a shared resource where the community can contribute to data generation, validation, and management decisions&quot; for &quot;product footprinting&quot; with its first goal being &quot;to produce an open dataset and an open source toolchain capable of supporting LCA calculations&quot;. With product footprints they refer to the goal of &quot;reliable, unbiased sustainability information on products&quot;.

=== Dataset optimization ===
Datasets that are suboptimal in accuracy or have gaps can be, temporarily until the complete data is available or permanently, be patched or optimized by various methods such as mechanisms for &quot;selection of a dataset that represents the missing dataset that leads in most cases to a much better approximation of environmental impacts than a dataset selected by default or by geographical proximity&quot; or machine learning.

==Integration in systems and systems theory==
Life cycle assessments can be integrated as routine processes of systems, as input for modeled future socio-economic pathways, or, more broadly, into a larger context&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1186/s40309-022-00203-9&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (such as qualitative scenarios).

For example, a study estimated the environmental benefits of microbial protein within a future socio-economic pathway, showing substantial deforestation reduction (56%) and climate change mitigation if only of per-capita beef was replaced by microbial protein by 2050.

Life cycle assessments, including as product/technology analyses, can also be integrated in analyses of potentials, barriers and methods to shift or regulate consumption or production.

The life cycle perspective also allows considering losses and lifetimes of rare goods and services in the economy. For example, the usespans of, often scarce, tech-critical metals were found to be short as of 2022. Such data could be combined with conventional life cycle analyses, e.g., to enable life-cycle material/labor cost analyses and long-term economic viability or sustainable design. One study suggests that in LCAs, resource availability is, as of 2013, &quot;evaluated by means of models based on depletion time, surplus energy, etc.&quot;

Broadly, various types of life cycle assessments (or commissioning such) could be used in various ways in various types of societal decision-making, especially because financial markets of the economy typically do not consider life cycle impacts or induced societal problems in the future and present—the &quot;externalities&quot; to the contemporary economy.

==Critiques==
Life cycle assessment is a powerful tool for analyzing aspects of quantifiable systems. Not every factor, however, can be reduced to a number and inserted into a model. Rigid system boundaries make accounting for changes in the system difficult. This is sometimes referred to as the boundary critique to systems thinking. The accuracy and availability of data can also contribute to inaccuracy. For instance, data from generic processes may be based on averages, unrepresentative sampling, or outdated results. This is especially the case for the use and end of life phases in the LCA. Additionally, social implications of products are generally lacking in LCAs. Comparative life cycle analysis is often used to determine a better process or product to use. However, because of aspects like differing system boundaries, different statistical information, different product uses, etc., these studies can easily be swayed in favor of one product or process over another in one study and the opposite in another study based on varying parameters and different available data. There are guidelines to help reduce such conflicts in results but the method still provides a lot of room for the researcher to decide what is important, how the product is typically manufactured, and how it is typically used.

An in-depth review of 13 LCA studies of wood and paper products found a lack of consistency in the methods and assumptions used to track carbon during the product lifecycle. A wide variety of methods and assumptions were used, leading to different and potentially contrary conclusions—particularly with regard to carbon sequestration and methane generation in landfills and with carbon accounting during forest growth and product use.

Moreover, the fidelity of LCAs can vary substantially as various data may not be incorporated, especially in early versions: for example, LCAs that do not consider regional emission information can under-estimate the life cycle environmental impact.

<text>Millie Elizabeth Hughes-Fulford ( Hughes; December 21, 1945 – February 2, 2021) was an American medical investigator, molecular biologist, and payload specialist who flew aboard the NASA Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; in June 1991.

== Early life ==
Millie Elizabeth Hughes was born in Mineral Wells, Texas on December 21, 1945. She graduated from Mineral Wells High School in 1962, then entered college at the age of 16 and earned her Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry and biology from Tarleton State University in 1968. She then began her graduate work studying plasma chemistry at Texas Woman&#x27;s University as a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow from 1968 to 1971 and earned her Ph.D. in 1972. From 1971 to 1972, she was also both an American Association of University Women Fellow and a MacArthur Foundation Fellow.

== Career ==
After earning her doctorate degree in 1972, Dr. Hughes-Fulford applied to roughly 100 jobs in academia, from which she received four replies. This resulted in her joining the faculty of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas as a postdoctoral fellow with Marvin D. Siperstein, where her research focused on the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. Within a couple of years, she relocated with her laboratory to San Francisco.

In 1978, she noticed a printed recruiting advertisement calling for female astronauts, which led her to apply for the space program. Out of the 8000 applicants, Hughes-Fulford was in the top 20 but did not make it into NASA Astronaut Group 8. She was not deterred and continued pursuing a career in space; she was also a member of the U.S. Army Reserve Medical Corps, achieving the rank of major and serving from 1981 until 1995.

=== NASA ===
Selected into a payload specialist by NASA in January 1983, Hughes-Fulford flew in June 1991 aboard STS-40 Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS 1), the first Spacelab mission dedicated to biomedical studies. SLS-1 was also the first mission to have a crew with three female members, and Hughes-Fulford was both NASA&#x27;s first female payload specialist in orbit and the first representative of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs in space. The mission flew over 3.2 million miles in 146 orbits and its crew completed over 18 experiments during a nine-day period, bringing back more medical data than any previous NASA flight. Mission duration was 218 hours, 14 minutes and 21 seconds, or 9 days, 2 hours, 14 minutes, and 20 seconds.

=== Later career ===
After her space mission for NASA, Hughes-Fulford was a professor at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center where she continued her research until her death in 2021. She created and directed the Hughes-Fulford Laboratory at the San Francisco VA Medical Center, where her research focus included immunology, bioastronautics, and oncology.

She was the Principal Investigator (PI) on a series of SpaceHab/Biorack experiments, which examined the regulation of osteoblast (bone cell) growth. These experiments flew on STS-76, in March 1996, STS-81 in January 1997, and STS-84 in May 1997, and studied the root causes of osteoporosis that occurs in astronauts during spaceflight. One experiment resulted in observations of changes in anabolic signal transduction in microgravity. A later collaborator was Dr. Augusto Cogoli of Zürich, Switzerland; one experiment with Dr. Cogoli was lost in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, and another experiment using technology from Affymetrix and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) examined changes in T-cell gene induction in spaceflight on a joint NASA/ESA International Space Station mission that launched on the Soyuz TMA-9 in 2006.

Further studies of gene regulation and signal transduction in spaceflight were approved in January 2002 for Shuttle/ISS experiments examining protein kinase C (PKC) signal activation. She flew her most recent experiments to ISS on a SpaceX rocket in collaboration with the ISS International Laboratory, the European Space Agency, and the National Institutes of Health. In those studies, she found one basis for changes in the immune system in spaceflight. Many of her publications are available at her laboratory web site.

Hughes-Fulford contributed over 120 papers and abstracts, including on bone and cancer growth regulation, and on the effect of spaceflight on the immune system at the cell molecular and systems biology level. She was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Society for Gravitational Science and Biology, American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, American Society for Cell Biology, American Society of Hematology and the Association of Space Explorers.

== Personal life ==
Hughes-Fulford was married twice. Her first marriage was to policeman Rick Wiley, with whom she had a daughter, and ended in divorce in the late 1970s. Her second marriage was in 1983 to George Fulford, a United Airlines pilot whom she met in 1981. She died in Mill Valley, California, on February 2, 2021, of lymphoma, which was the subject of her last research paper.

<text>Sant&#x27;Anna di Stazzema, officially Sant&#x27;Anna, is a village in Tuscany, Italy. Administratively, it is a &quot;frazione&quot; of the &quot;comune&quot; of Stazzema, in the province of Lucca.

==History==

In 1944, it was the site of a notorious Nazi crime against humanity committed by a part of German 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS during World War II. In the morning of 12 August, about 560 villagers and refugees (including 130 children) were murdered and their bodies burnt in a scorched earth policy action. After the war, the village was only partially rebuilt.

The massacre gained notoriety from 1994. During an investigation of the military attorney Antonino Intelisano, 695 files about war crimes in Italy during World War II were found in a wooden cabinet, known as the &quot;Armadio della vergogna&quot; (armoire of shame), located in a palace of Rome.

Since 2000, it has been the site of the Italian National Park of Peace (&quot;Parco Nazionale della Pace&quot;) with memorials and a museum dedicated to the massacre.

==Geography==
Located in the Apuan Alps, Sant&#x27;Anna is a mountain village that is 12 km far from Pietrasanta and 16 from its Marina, on the Mediterranean Sea; 18 km from Viareggio, 24 from Massa and 37 from Carrara. The nearest train station is that of Pietrasanta on the Pisa-Genoa line and the nearest motorway exit is &quot;Viareggio-Camaiore&quot; on the A12.

==Gallery==
==Popular culture==
The massacre inspired the novel &quot;Miracle at St. Anna&quot; by James McBride, and Spike Lee&#x27;s film (2008) of the same title that was based on it.

<doc id="604904" wikidata="Q2082711" url="?curid=604904" title="Retrograde analysis">
<text>In chess problems, retrograde analysis is a technique employed to determine which moves were played leading up to a given position. While this technique is rarely needed for solving ordinary chess problems, there is a whole subgenre of chess problems in which it is an important part; such problems are known as &quot;retros&quot;.

Retros may ask, for example, for a mate in two, but the main puzzle is in explaining the history of the position. This may be important to determine, for example, if castling is disallowed or an &quot;en passant&quot; capture is possible. Other problems may ask specific questions relating to the history of the position, such as, &quot;Is the bishop on c1 promoted?&quot;. This is essentially a matter of logical reasoning, with high appeal for puzzle enthusiasts.

Sometimes it is necessary to determine if a particular position is legal, with &quot;legal&quot; meaning that it could be reached by a series of legal moves, no matter how illogical. Another important branch of retrograde analysis problems is proof game problems.

==Example==

An example of a retrograde analysis problem is shown on the left. The solver must deduce White&#x27;s last move. It is not immediately apparent how the white king could have moved, since every adjacent square puts White in a seemingly impossible double check; on further examination it becomes apparent that if the white king moved from f5, then Black could have delivered the double check by playing f4xg3, capturing a white pawn on g4 &quot;en passant&quot;. Therefore, on the previous move, white must have played pawn g2-g4. But what did Black move before that? The white king on f5 was under check by the bishop on h3 and there was a white pawn on g2. The only possibility is that Black moved a knight from g4 to e5 with discovered check. Therefore, White&#x27;s last move was king on f5 takes knight on e5. (The entire sequence of moves is 1...Ng4–e5+ (possibly capturing something on e5) 2.g2–g4 f4xg3+ e.p. 3.Kf5xe5.)

In this example, the fact that Black can deliver checkmate in several different ways is irrelevant; likewise, the fact that White could legally have captured the black queen by gxf3 on an earlier move is irrelevant. The solver is required only to deduce a &quot;legal&quot; sequence of moves which lead to the position, regardless of any considerations of chess strategy.

==Castling and &quot;en passant&quot; capture conventions==
In most chess problems, including retrograde analysis problems, castling is assumed to be legal unless it can be proved otherwise. An &quot;en passant&quot; capture, on the other hand, is permitted only if it can be proved that the last move was a double step of the pawn to be captured. These two conventions lead to features unique to retrograde analysis problems.

===Partial retrograde analysis (PRA)===
Some problems use a method called &quot;partial retrograde analysis&quot; (PRA). In these, the history of a position cannot be determined with certainty, but each of the alternative histories demands a different solution. In Article 16 of the &quot;Codex for Chess Composition&quot;, the PRA convention is formally defined as follows:&quot;Where the rights to castle and/or to capture en-passant are mutually dependent, the solution consists of several mutually exclusive parts. All possible combinations of move rights, taking into account the castling convention and the en-passant convention, form these mutually exclusive parts.&quot; The problem to the left by W. Langstaff (from &quot;Chess Amateur&quot; 1922) is a relatively simple example; it is a mate in two. It is impossible to determine what move Black played last, but it is clear that he must have either moved the king or rook, or else played g7–g5 (g6–g5 is impossible, since the pawn would have been giving check). Therefore, either Black cannot castle, or White can capture on g6 &quot;en passant&quot;. It is impossible to determine exactly what Black&#x27;s last move actually was, so the solution has two lines:

:1.Ke6 and 2.Rd8# (if Black moved the king or rook)
:1.hxg6 e.p. (threat: 2.Rd8#) 1...0-0 2.h7# (if Black played g7–g5)

===The retro strategy convention (RS)===

Sometimes it is possible to prove that only one of two castling moves is legal, but it is impossible to determine which one. In this case, whichever castling move is executed first is deemed to be legal. The &quot;Codex&quot; defines the retro strategy (RS) convention as follows:&quot;If in the case of mutual dependency of castling rights a solution is not possible according to the PRA convention, then the Retro-Strategy (RS) convention should be applied: whichever castling is executed first is deemed to be permissible.&quot;

In the problem on the left, if the rook on f3 is a promoted piece, then it is possible to prove that Black cannot castle. White on the other hand can castle, since it cannot be proved that it is illegal. If the rook on f3 is &quot;not&quot; a promoted piece, then one of White&#x27;s two rooks originally came from a1, in which case the white king has moved and White cannot castle; Black on the other hand can castle since it cannot be proved that it is illegal.

Put another way, either White can castle, or Black can castle, but not both. If Black can castle, then the problem has no solution, so White must castle in order to prove that Black cannot castle. The solution is therefore 1.0-0 (&quot;preventing&quot; Black from castling by proving that the rook on f3 is promoted) followed by 2.Rf8#. Note that if White were to play 1.Rhf1, Black would be permitted to castle, and there would be no mate.

This problem is a witty case. Black is helpless against the threats on the d-file (2.dxc3 and 3.Rd8#), unless 1...0-0! is legal. Indeed, if 1...0-0 is legal, the problem is insoluble, so White must prove that it is illegal.

If White has just castled, then the white king and queen&#x27;s rook have never moved, so the king&#x27;s rook can never have gotten out. So the rook on d3 is promoted. If it had promoted on d8, e8, or f8, then the black king must have moved; h8, and the black rook must have moved; a8, b8, or c8, and it must have come out via d8 and the black king must have moved. Thus g8 is the only possible square. But only the b- and e-pawns could have promoted there, and either would require at least seven captures to account for the positions of the White pawns, when only six Black units are missing. So, if White just castled, Black cannot castle.

Therefore, White retracts 1.0-0-0! By castling first, White proves that Black cannot castle. Now White must remake the battery on the d-file to give mate, which seems possible via either 1.0-0-0 or 1.Rd1. But the latter fails to the enemy g-pawn: 1.Rd1 g3! and the threat of 2...gxf2+! costs White a move. Hence, White retracts 1.0-0-0 and plays 1.0-0-0!

===The a posteriori (AP) convention===

This is perhaps the most controversial of the retrograde analysis conventions; if it is employed, the problem is usually marked as &quot;AP&quot;.

Sometimes it is possible to prove that &quot;if&quot; castling is possible, then the previous move must have been a double step of a pawn, making an &quot;en passant&quot; capture legal. In this case, the &quot;en passant&quot; capture is made, then its legality is proved &quot;a posteriori&quot;; this is accomplished by castling. In some such problems, Black&#x27;s defence consists of trying to prevent White from castling, rendering the initial &quot;en passant&quot; capture illegal. Nenad Petrović composed several problems in this vein; the example given on the left was discussed extensively in Tim Krabbé&#x27;s book &quot;Chess Curiosities&quot;.

Black has made 6 captures; to account for his pawn formation, all 6 captures must have been made with pawns; the capturing pawns must have started on b7, c7, d7 and e7. White has made 4 captures; again all of these captures must have been made with pawns. 3 of these captures must have been made with the pawn on e6, which started on b2. Which of the pawns on f5 and f7 started on g2? Only one of these pawns made a capture; Black&#x27;s original f-pawn has not made a capture and is still on the f-file, so the pawn on f7 cannot be the original f-pawn; it must have started on g2, and the pawn on f5 must have started on f2. The capture must have been made on f7, after Black played f7–f6 but before Black moved the g-pawn. The sequence was as follows: White&#x27;s pawns advanced to f5 and g6; Black made a capture exf4; at some point Black played f7–f6; White made a capture gxf7; Black played g7–g5 (or g7–g6 and g6–g5).

In order to solve this problem, it must be considered what White&#x27;s last move was. If the king or rook moved, then White cannot castle. It has been established that the f5 pawn started on f2, so the only way White could have moved a pawn is if the last move was gxf7, to which Black has immediately replied ...g7–g5. If this is in fact the case, then White can play 1.fxg6 (an &quot;en passant&quot; capture). It has thus been proved that &quot;if&quot; White can castle, then 1.fxg6 ep is legal.

The solution as originally given was 1.fxg6 ep (intending to prove its legality &quot;a posteriori&quot; by castling) 1...Bc5 (preventing castling and threatening ...Bf2+, which would force a king move and delegitimize the &quot;en passant&quot; capture) 2.e3 fxe3 3.0-0 (sacrificing a rook in order to legitimize the &quot;en passant&quot; capture; if 3.d4 Bb4+ forces a king move and prevents castling) ...e2+ 4.Kg2 exf1=Q+ 5.Kxf1 and White has a won position.

This composition was highly controversial when first published, due in part to the &quot;non-chess&quot; motivations behind the moves 1...Bc5, 2.e3 and 3.0-0, and provoked heated debate in chess problemist circles. Amid the controversy, it was overlooked that the win is not clear in the final position, and in fact Black could have won with 3...exd2+! (instead of 3...e2+) 4.Kg2 e3.

<doc id="604917" wikidata="Q1277207" url="?curid=604917" title="Earl of Atholl">
<text>The Mormaer or Earl of Atholl was the title of the holder of a medieval comital lordship straddling the highland province of Atholl (&quot;Ath Fodhla&quot;), now in northern Perthshire. Atholl is a special Mormaerdom, because a King of Atholl is reported from the Pictish period. The only other two Pictish kingdoms to be known from contemporary sources are Fortriu and Circinn. Indeed, the early 13th century document known to modern scholars as the &quot;de Situ Albanie&quot; repeats the claim that Atholl was an ancient Pictish kingdom. In the 11th century, the famous Crínán of Dunkeld may have performed the role of Mormaer.

Royal connections continued with Máel Muire, who was the son of King Donnchad I, and the younger brother of Máel Coluim III mac Donnchada. Matad was perhaps the most famous of the Mormaers, fathering Harald Maddadsson, a notorious rebel of the Scottish King and perhaps the first Gael to rule Orkney as Earl of Orkney. The line of Máel Muire and Crínán came to an end when Forbhlaith, the daughter of Mormaer Henry married David de Hastings.

The latter marriage produced a daughter, Ada, who married into the Strathbogie family, a semi-Normanized Gaelic family with Fife origins. The Strathbogies ruled until the Wars of Independence, when the Campells took over. It finally passed to the Stewarts.

== Personal ==
Gidzenko was born on March 26, 1962, Elanets, Mykolaiv Oblast, Ukraine (then in the Soviet Union). Gidzenko is married to Olga Vladimirovna Shapovalova. They have two sons, Sergei, born in 1986 and Alexander, born in 1988. His father, Pavel Vasilyevich Gidzenko, and mother, Galina Mikhailovna Gidzenko, live in Berezovka-2, Odessa area. Gidzenko&#x27;s hobbies include football, swimming, reading of literature, photography, and walks in forests.

==Education==
Gidzenko graduated from the Higher Military Pilot School in Kharkiv in 1983. Gidzenko graduated from the Moscow State University of Geodesy and Cartography (MIIGAiK) in 1994 specializing in geodesy and cartography.

==Experience==
Upon graduation from the pilot school in 1983, Gidzenko served as a pilot and as a senior pilot in the RAir Force units of the Odessa military district. He was a 3rd class military pilot. Gidzenko was trained to fly three types of aircraft and has logged a total flying time of 850 hours. He is also a parachute-landing training instructor and has made 170 jumps.

==Cosmonaut career==

From December 1987 to June 1989, Gidzenko attended basic space training as a test cosmonaut candidate. Since September 1989 he attended advanced training as a test cosmonaut candidate. From March to October 1994 he trained for a space flight as a back-up crew commander (17th Primary Expedition/Euro-Mir-94 Program). From November 1994 to August 1995 he attended training for a space flight aboard the Soyuz TM transport vehicle/Mir orbital complex as the Expedition 20 Primary Crew Commander (Euro-Mir-95 Program).

=== Mir EO-20 (Euromir 95) ===
Yuri Gidzenko served aboard Mir as the commander of the long duration Mir EO-20 (Euromir 95) expedition from September 3, 1995, to February 29, 1996, and logged 179 days in space. One of the crewmembers on this mission was the ESA astronaut, Thomas Reiter. The Soyuz TM-22 carrying Gidzenko, cosmonaut Sergei Avdeyev and Reiter lifted off from the Baikonour cosmodrome on September 3, 1995, at 9:00 UTC. After a two-day autonomous flight the Soyuz spacecraft docked automatically with the Mir space station&#x27;s -X docking port on September 5. The three member crew became the 20th Mir resident crew. During the first week after docking, Euromir 95 crew and the resident Mir EO-19 crew of cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Nikolai Budarin conducted joint work. Gidzenko and his crewmembers used this time to get familiarize with the status of the onboard systems and experiments. The scientific objectives of Euromir 95 were to study effects of microgravity on the human body, to experiment with the development on new materials in a space environment, to capture samples of cosmic dust and man-made particles in low Earth orbit, and to test new space equipment. During the next months joint Russian-German research work were performed on board the Mir in the fields of life sciences (18 experiments), astrophysics (5 experiments), materials science (8 experiments) and technology (10 experiments). The crew also performed common work with the crew of STS-74. They cooperated in medical experiments and environmental investigations designed as part of International Space Station (ISS) Phase I research.

During Euromir 95, an unmanned cargo spacecraft, Progress M-29 visited the Mir on October 10. Progress M-29 brought about 2.5 tons of fresh supplies and equipment for the Mir EO-20 crew. On October 17, 1995, Russian and ESA officials decided to add another 44 days to the originally planned 135 days of the mission duration. On December 20, Progress M-30 docked at the Kvant port of Mir. It delivered 2300 kg of fuel, crew supplies, and research and medical equipment for use on the extended Euromir 95 mission

On February 29, 1996, Gidzenko returned to Earth on board the Soyuz TM-22 capsule which landed at 10:42 UTC, 105 km northeast of Arkalyk.

=== Expedition 1 ===

From November 2000 to March 2001, Gidzenko was part of the first permanent ISS resident crew, the Expedition 1. He along with cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev and NASA astronaut William Shepherd was launched into space on board the Soyuz TM-31 spacecraft which lifted off from the Baikonour cosmodrome on October 31, 2000, at 07:52:47 UTC. Gidzenko served as the Soyuz commander. After two days of solo flight, on November 2, the Soyuz spacecraft docked with the aft port the Zvezda Service Module at 09:21 UTC. Gidzenko joined the Expedition 1 crew as a flight engineer. The crew were on board the ISS for over four months. They helped with assembly tasks as new elements, including the U.S. Destiny Laboratory, were added to the orbiting outpost. In their first weeks on board, Gidzenko, Shepherd and Krikalev activated critical life support systems and unpacked Station components, clothing, laptop computers, office equipment, cables and electrical gear left behind for them by previous Shuttle crews which conducted logistic supply flights to the new complex over the past two years.

Expedition 1 crew hosted three visiting Shuttle crews, STS-97, STS-98 and STS-102. The crew unloaded two unmanned Russian Progress resupply vehicles.

In March 2001, Expedition 1 crewmembers returned to Earth aboard the at the completion of the STS-102. Discovery landed at the Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Runway 15, on March 21 at 02:33:06 EST. On board Soyuz/shuttle and ISS, Gidzenko logged 140 days in space.

=== Soyuz TM-34/Soyuz TM-33 ===

He was Launched on April 25, 2002, on the Soyuz TM-34 (Soyuz 4 Taxi Crew) mission along with ESA astronaut Roberto Vittori and South African Space Tourist Mark Shuttleworth. The Soyuz TM-34 lifted off from the Baikonour cosmodrome at 06:26:35 UTC. Gidzenko served as the Soyuz commander for the flight. After two days of solo flight, the Soyuz docked with the nadir port of the Zarya module at 07:55 UTC. Once there at the ISS, Gidzenko, Vittori and Shuttleworth conducted joint operations with the ISS resident Expedition 4 crew, performed educational and science activities and exchanged seat liners from the Soyuz TM-34 to the old Soyuz TM-33.

On May 5, Gidzenko returned to Earth on board the Soyuz TM-33 spacecraft. Soyuz TM-33 undocked from the &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment and landed 26 km south east of Arkalyk at 03:51:53 UTC. On board Soyuz TM-33/TM-34 and the ISS, Gidzenko logged 9 days in space.

=== Spacewalks ===
Gidzenko has performed two career spacewalks during his stay on board the Mir space station.

On December 8, 1995, Gizenko performed his first career spacewalk. He and cosmonaut Avedeyev began the spacewalk at 19:23 UTC. The two spacewalkers reconfigured the docking unit at the front of the Mir base block to prepare it for arrival of the Priroda module. From inside the depressurized docking unit, the two cosmonauts moved the Konus
docking unit from the +Z to the -Z docking port, where the Priroda module was docked. The spacewalk lasted 37 minutes.

On February 8, 1996, Gidzenko performed his second career spacewalk. He and ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter began the spacewalk at 14:03 UTC. At the beginning, they moved a maneuvering unit stored inside the Kvant 2 airlock and attached it to the exterior of the module. The spacewalkers then climbed out the Kvant 2 hatch and again used the Strela boom to maneuver to the forward
end of Spektr, where they retrieved the two cassettes they had deployed in October 1995. They installed a new cassette
in the facility and, with Adeyev&#x27;s assistance from inside the station, verified that it would operate. Although originally scheduled to last about 5 hours and 30 minutes, the spacewalking activity was shortened to 3 hours and 6 minutes by an aborted task on a Kristall antenna. The Russian officials canceled the antenna work when the cosmonauts were unable to loosen the bolts on a joint of the antenna.

<text>Terence Tenison Cuneo RGI FGRA (1 November 1907 – 3 January 1996) was a prolific English painter noted for his scenes of railways, horses and military actions. He was also the official artist for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.

==Life and work==
Terence Cuneo was born in London, the son of Cyrus Cincinato Cuneo (1879–1916) and Nell Marion Tenison (1881–1964), artists who met while studying with Whistler in Paris. Cyrus Cuneo&#x27;s elder brother Rinaldo Cuneo was also an acclaimed painter in San Francisco, as was his youngest brother Egisto Cuneo. Terence Cuneo studied at Sutton Valence School in Kent, Chelsea Polytechnic and the Slade School of Art, before working as an illustrator for magazines, books and periodicals. In 1936 he started working in oils, continuing with his illustration work. During World War II he served as a sapper in the Royal Engineers but also completed a small number of commissions for the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee, providing illustrations of tank and aircraft factories. He served and became good friends with fellow artist Cyril Parfitt. Also during the War, Cuneo was commissioned by the Foreign Office to produce anti-Nazi drawings and cartoons and an exhibition of his war works was held at the Palaquin Fine Arts gallery in 1942.
After the war, Cuneo was commissioned to produce a series of works illustrating railways, bridges and locomotives. A significant point in his career was his appointment as official artist for the Coronation of Elizabeth II, which brought his name before the public worldwide. He received more commissions from industry, which included depicting manufacturing, mineral extraction and road building, including the M1. He was most famous for his paintings of engineering subjects, particularly locomotives and the railway as a whole. But in fact Cuneo painted over a wide range, from big game in Africa to landscapes. Further success was achieved in his regimental commissions, battle scenes and incidents as well as portraits (including H.M. the Queen, and Field Marshal Montgomery).

From 1954 his works included a small mouse, sometimes lifelike, sometimes cartoonish. These became his trademark after 1956. They can be difficult to detect, and many people enjoy scouring his paintings to find one. Even some of his portraits of the famous contain a mouse.

His work has been used in a variety of manners, from book jackets and model railway catalogues to posters and jigsaws and even Royal Mail postage stamps. His paintings have appeared on both Great Britain and Isle of Man stamps. His work can also be found in many museums, officers messes, and galleries, including Guildhall Art Gallery, Newarke Houses Museum, Lloyd&#x27;s of London and the Royal Institution.

Cuneo was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1987 Birthday Honours and was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 1994 Birthday Honours. A 1.5 times life size bronze memorial statue of Cuneo, by Philip Jackson, stood in the main concourse at Waterloo station in London for many years, but has now been relocated to Brompton Barracks, Chatham. It was commissioned by the Terence Cuneo Memorial Trust (established March 2002) to create a permanent memorial to the artist, together with an annual prize at the Slade School of Art, given by the Trust. In tribute to Cuneo&#x27;s trademark, the statue includes a mouse peering from under a book by the artist&#x27;s feet, and another carved into the statue&#x27;s plinth near the ground. The official handover of the statue and its dowry to the Institution of Royal Engineers took place on 12 July 2017 with Carole Cuneo (representing the Statue Memorial Trust), Colonel Nigel Montagu (representing the Institution of Royal Engineers) and Chris Wheeler (Chairman of the Cuneo Society) each giving short speeches.

A major exhibition of his life&#x27;s work, forming part of the Hull City of Culture celebrations took place in the Brynmor Jones Gallery, University of Hull in 2017. Curated by the Science Museum Group’s Director Ian Blatchford and National Railway Museum Assistant Director and Head Curator Andrew McLean, the exhibition took a fresh look at Cuneo through his unique portrayal of power.

Terence Cuneo was cremated at the Randalls Park Crematorium, Leatherhead, Surrey, but no record has yet been entered in their Book of Remembrance.

A memorial plaque was installed on one of the houses built on the site of his home and studio 201 Ember Lane, East Molesey. This former home where so many paintings were executed, and so many famous people visited for sketches and portraits has now been demolished and replaced by seven new properties. Peter Collins, the Cuneo Society&#x27;s Co-Founder and Chairman, said &quot;Terence Cuneo lived there for many years at 201 Ember Lane. Some years ago it was pulled down so the site of 201 is now seven homes.&quot; Prompted by Chris Wheeler, the society decided they would like to have a blue plaque erected in memory of Cuneo in the place where he lived. A group including family, friends and members of the society&#x27;s committee gathered at the site to mark the unveiling of the plaque. Collins said: &quot;Most of the work was done by Chris Wheeler. It looks very, very nice and his daughter Carole is pleased with it.&quot;

<doc id="604936" wikidata="Q7859447" url="?curid=604936" title="Two, six, heave">
<text>&quot;Two, six, heave&quot; is a phrase used to coordinate seamen&#x27;s pulling.

As used by sailors, the person at the front of the team will typically call out the &quot;two, six&quot; part of the chant. During this phase all members move their hands up the line ready to pull. This is followed, in its natural rhythm, by the &quot;heave&quot;, called out by the whole team together. At this moment, the team simultaneously lean back on the line, and use their leg muscles to exert a powerful pull upon it. This coordination takes some practice to achieve, but the difference in applied power between a raw group pulling as individuals and a practiced team hauling together is very significant.

There is not a single tempo or cadence for the chant, since this will depend on the task in hand. For example, hauling in the upper topsail halyard will require a long, heavy pull; if the team is not to be exhausted halfway through then the leader must ensure that the pace is slow enough to be maintained throughout the job. Hauling in a clewline, by contrast, is relatively quick and easy, so the chant can be quite rapid. It is also not always necessary to use this method of hauling for the whole of a task; often, the first part of the job can be achieved with simple hand-over-hand pulling, switching over to a coordinated heave for the final tensioning.

After a line on a ship has been hauled taut, it will usually be secured to a belaying pin.

In Britain it has a broader meaning and is often used in any situation where a coordinated pulling effort is required, often where maritime people are involved, but almost as frequently where &#x27;civilians&#x27; are working together.

==History==
The phrase &quot;two, six, heave&quot; is relatively modern, variations not appearing in print until 1911 (as &quot;wan [one] - two - six - pull&quot;), and again in 1925 as &quot;one, two... six - heave!&quot;.

The phrase was not considered a specifically nautical or naval term until 1951 (appearing as &quot;one, two, six, heave!&quot;). The exact phrase &quot;two... six... heave&quot; without the leading &quot;one&quot; first appeared in 1952, referring to its use in railway construction in Sumatran prisoner-of-war camps in 1942.

The year 1968 marked the first use of the exact phrase &quot;two, six - heave&quot; as a nautical or naval term. Remarkably, the subject of the 1968 article was a number of theories about the origin of &quot;two, six, heave&quot;. It also contains the first appearance of the popular unconfirmed theory that the phrase originated from Royal Navy gunners numbered 2 and 6, who supposedly, on this command, hauled the gun back for reloading.

More familiar numeric ordering, &quot;one, two, three, heave&quot;, has been in continuous use since as early as 1836. A variation from The Lost Ship, 1840, is described thus: &quot; “Steady lads, steady...wait till I give you the words — one, two, three, and then at the third, pull all together... Now then - one, two, three - pull&quot; &quot;.

==Origin theories==
It is widely believed to derive from the orders used in firing shipboard cannon in Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy. According to this story, the team of six gunners had numbered roles. After loading, it was the task of the men numbered two and six to heave (in a coordinated fashion) the cannon out the gunport for firing, using simple effort for a light cannon or a tackle apiece for larger ones. There are a number of problems with this theory, however: firstly, two men would be insufficient to haul out a gun, which could weigh in excess of two and a half tons. Secondly, numbers two and six would be on the same side of the gun (even numbers being on one side and odd numbers on the other). Thirdly, there is no reference to the phrase in any literature prior to the First World War, making it highly unlikely that it was in use before this time.

People in the square rigged sailing community have proposed the idea that it could be a shortening of the French “tout de suite”, often anglicised colloquially to &quot;toot sweet&quot;, which means &#x27;immediately&#x27;. There has also been conjecture that it was originally the French, &quot;toutes six houle&quot; (all six heave) but what &quot;six&quot; is unclear as there is no evidence it was orders to a gun crew.

<doc id="604950" wikidata="Q669189" url="?curid=604950" title="Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury">
<text>Robert de Bellême ( – after 1130), seigneur de Bellême (or Belèsme), seigneur de Montgomery, viscount of the Hiémois, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury and Count of Ponthieu, was an Anglo-Norman nobleman, and one of the most prominent figures in the competition for the succession to England and Normandy between the sons of William the Conqueror. He was a member of the powerful House of Bellême.

Robert became notorious for his alleged cruelty. Referring to his activities in the rebellion against Henry I of 1110-1112, the chronicler Orderic Vitalis, in Book XI of his &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;, calls Robert &quot;grasping and cruel, an implacable persecutor of the Church of God and the poor ... unequalled for his iniquity in the whole Christian era&quot;, as well as &quot;the tyrant who had disturbed the land and was preparing to add still worse crimes to his many offences of plundering and burning&quot;. The stories of his brutality may have inspired the legend of Robert the Devil.

==Early life==

Robert was the oldest surviving son of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and Mabel de Bellême, born probably between 1052 and 1056. In 1070 after the death of his great-uncle Yves Bishop of Séez his parents brought him to Bellême, which at that time became his mother&#x27;s inheritance, and as the oldest surviving son it would eventually be his.

In 1073 when the Conqueror invaded Maine, Robert was knighted by William at the siege of Fresnay castle. By now probably of age and independent of his father he took part in the 1077 revolt of the young Robert Curthose against Duke William. When Robert&#x27;s mother, Mabel, was killed , Robert inherited her vast estates but at this point Duke William took the added precaution of garrisoning the Bellême castles with his own soldiers, which was his ducal right. On hearing the news of William the Conqueror&#x27;s death in 1087, Robert&#x27;s first act was to expel the ducal garrisons from all his castles.

==Rebellion of 1088==

At the end of 1087 Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy was told of a plot to place him on the throne of England in his brother William II&#x27;s place, a plot that Duke Robert enthusiastically approved and supported. Robert de Bellême, his brother Hugh de Montgomery and a third brother, either Roger or Arnulf, participated in this rebellion. The main conspirators, however, were Odo of Bayeux, Eustace III, Count of Boulogne, Robert de Mowbray, Geoffrey de Montbray, Earl Roger de Montgomery and other disaffected Magnates. The next year in the Rebellion of 1088, beginning at Easter the rebels burned and wasted the king&#x27;s properties and those of his followers. At some point Roger of Montgomery detached himself from supporting Robert Curthose through negotiations with the king. Finally Robert de Bellême was among the rebels who found themselves defending Rochester Castle. When William Rufus blockaded the town and built two counter-castles, the garrison began negotiating for surrender under honourable terms, being allowed to keep their lands and serve the king. This Rufus refused; he was furious and had initially wanted the traitors hanged &#x27;or by some other form of execution utterly removed from the face of the earth.&#x27; Roger of Montgomery and other great barons interceded with the King, Earl Roger on behalf of his sons, until finally in July a semi-honorable surrender was negotiated between the king and the rebels. Rufus, albeit reluctantly, guaranteed the rebels life and limb and gave them safe conduct.

==Return to Normandy==

Coincidentally Robert sailed back to Normandy in the company of Count Henry (later king Henry I), who had not been part of the conspiracy against his brother William Rufus. However well they got along on the voyage, they were destined to become bitter enemies. One thing more they shared in common was the extreme resentment by Odo, Bishop of Bayeux who, banished from England, had returned to Normandy ahead of Henry and Robert. Henry at just 20 years of age was now Odo&#x27;s overlord, which Odo strongly resented, and Robert de Bellême was a powerful and dangerous disruptive force in Normandy now free to do as he would. Odo, who held great sway over Duke Robert, convinced him that both Henry and his travel companion Robert de Bellême were now conspiring with William Rufus against the duke. Both Henry and Robert were seized as they disembarked and, both placed in the Bishop&#x27;s custody, were imprisoned; Henry at Bayeux and Robert at Neuilly-l&#x27;Évêque, now Neuilly-la-Forêt.

On hearing his son was imprisoned Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury immediately went to Normandy and put all his castles in a state of readiness against the duke. At this point the Montgomery family was in a state of rebellion against Robert Curthose. Bishop Odo now instigated Duke Robert to take all the castles of Robert de Bellême by force and the duke gathered an army and proceeded against them. Duke Robert first attacked Ballon and after losses on both sides, the castle surrendered. Moving on to the castle of Saint-Céneri where the family of Robert de Bellême was residing, Robert Quarrel had been told by Earl Roger to resist the duke at all costs and this was done until the provisions eventually failed. Duke Robert was so enraged at such resistance he blinded Robert Quarrel and mutilated the castle defenders. At this point the duke lost interest in attempting to capture any more of Robert de Bellême&#x27;s castles, he dissolved the forces and returned to Rouen. Earl Roger sent peace envoys to the duke and convinced him to release his son Robert which the fickle duke finally did. The price of his son&#x27;s release, however, was the castle of Saint-Céneri which Duke Robert gave to Robert Giroie as castellan. The Giroies had long held the castle until, as punishment for their rebellion in the 1060s, William the Conqueror gave this castle and other Giroie lands to Roger de Montgomery, who as a member of the Bellême family was also considered their nemesis.

By 1090 Robert was back in Robert Curthose&#x27;s good graces, Orderic Vitalis calling him a &quot;principal councilor&quot; to duke Robert. He supported Curthose in putting down a revolt by the citizens of Rouen, in 1090, and took considerable numbers of the citizens captive throwing them into dungeons. According to Robert of Torigni in 1092 the inhabitants of Domfront, long a Bellême-Montgomery stronghold, &quot;invited&quot; Henry, the duke&#x27;s younger brother to take possession of Domfront. Apparently they had grown weary of Robert&#x27;s oppressive and abusive style of lordship. No explanation was offered for what happened to Robert de Bellême&#x27;s garrison contingent or who exactly facilitated the bloodless takeover. In addition Robert de Bellême had requested that same year to hold Bellême of the French crown instead of the Duke of Normandy.

In 1094 Robert&#x27;s father, earl Roger, died.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESIII/4-637&quot;&gt;Detlev Schwennicke, &quot;Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten&quot;, Neue Folge, Band III Teilband 4 (Marburg, Germany: J. A. Stargardt, 1989), Tafel 637&lt;/ref&gt; Robert&#x27;s younger brother Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury inherited the English lands and titles, while Robert inherited his father&#x27;s Norman properties, which included good part of central and southern Normandy, in part adjacent to the Bellême territories he had already inherited from his mother.

==William Rufus (1096–1100)==

In 1096, Robert Curthose took up the cross on the First Crusade and left the custody of the duchy to his brother William Rufus, King of England. Robert Bellême regained the favour of Rufus and both he and his brothers were in his service on several occasions. In 1098 he captured Elias I, Count of Maine for Rufus, a significant feat.

In 1098 Robert&#x27;s younger brother Hugh died, and Robert inherited, on payment of £3,000 in relief, the English properties that had been their father&#x27;s, including the Rape of Arundel and the Earldom of Shrewsbury. Robert had also acquired the countship of Ponthieu &quot;jure uxoris&quot; and the honour of Tickhill; all of which combined made him the wealthiest magnate in both England and Normandy.

In August 1100 at the death of Rufus, Henry I seized the English throne before his brother Robert Curthose could claim it. While Robert rushed to England to pay homage to Henry, he and his brothers must have seen this as the end of royal favour for the Montgomerys.

==Anglo-Norman Civil War 1101==

Robert Curthose returned from the First Crusade in triumph. According to Orderic, Curthose was being encouraged to attack Henry by his barons but he remained indecisive until Ranulf Flambard, having escaped from the Tower of London, fled to Normandy where he appears to have influenced Duke Robert to go ahead with his invasion of England and depose his brother Henry. Robert de Bellême was one of the great magnates who joined Robert Curthose&#x27;s 1101 invasion of England, along with his brothers Roger the Poitevin and Arnulf of Montgomery and his nephew William, Count of Mortain. This invasion, however, which aimed to depose Henry I, ended bloodlessly in the Treaty of Alton which called for amnesty for the participants but allowed traitors to be punished. It quickly became evident that Henry I had no intentions of abiding by the treaty of Alton; &#x27;Soothe them with promises&#x27; advised Robert Count of Meulan just before the battle, then they can be &#x27;driven into exile&#x27;.

Henry I took a year compiling charges against Robert and his brothers and Robert&#x27;s unlicensed castle building and specifically Bridgnorth Castle may have been the last straw for Henry. Henry had a series of charges drawn up against Robert in 1102, and when Robert refused to answer for them, gathered his forces and besieged and captured Robert&#x27;s English castles. Robert lost his English lands and titles (as did his brothers), was banished from England, and returned to Normandy.

In 1105 he was warring with Rotrou III, Count of Perche over a large portion of his Bellême lands and lost. That same year he attacked a force of Henry&#x27;s supporters, then went to England before Christmas to attempt make peace with King Henry but he returned to Normandy empty handed.

==Battle of Tinchebrai and after==

In 1106 Robert was one of Curthose&#x27;s commanders at the Battle of Tinchebrai commanding the rear division and, when the battle turned in Henry&#x27;s favour, he and most of those with him avoided capture by fleeing the field. With Normandy now under Henry&#x27;s rule, Robert de Bellême submitted and was allowed to retain his Norman fiefs and his office as viscount of the Hiémois.

However, Henry was still wary of Robert and placed his followers in key positions in Normandy. In the rebellion of 1110–12 barons on the frontier of Normandy were disgruntled over Henry&#x27;s policies and especially his attempt to take custody of William Clito, son of Robert Curthose. According to Orderic, Robert played a central role in this rebellion after the death of Elias I, Count of Maine in July 1110. In 1112 Robert was sent as an envoy of the French king to Henry I at his court at Bonneville to negotiate the release of Robert Curthose, whereas Henry seized Robert and imprisoned him. Apparently Henry had charges already prepared; failing to attend Henry at his court after being summoned three times, of failing to render accounts, and of acting against his lord&#x27;s interests. Technically Robert may have been guilty but arguably it was not safe for him to attend Henry, he may have regarded the revenues as gifts and it is also arguable whether the charge of acting against Henry&#x27;s interests warranted the severity of the punishment. In addition Robert was under the king&#x27;s protection as an emissary sent to negotiate Robert Curthose&#x27;s release. This gave the act international implications but at the time Louis VI of France and Henry I were intriguing against each other so the breach of protocol went unpunished, but with Robert&#x27;s imprisonment the rebellion against Henry collapsed. Robert spent the rest of his life as a prisoner; the exact date of his death is not known.

==Historical portrayal ==
Orderic Vitalis portrays Robert de Bellême as a villain, especially when compared to Henry I, whose misdemeanours the chronicler felt were excusable. Orderic calls Robert &quot;Grasping and cruel, an implacable persecutor of the Church of God and the poor... unequalled for his iniquity in the whole Christian era.&quot; To quote David C. Douglas, &quot;Ordericus, if credulous, was neither malicious nor a liar; and these accounts concerned people of whom he had special knowledge&quot; [referring to the Bellême-Montgomery family] but he may have been strongly biased against Robert de Bellême and his treatment of that magnate belies a moral interpretation of his actions. The basis for Orderic&#x27;s animosity towards Robert and his de Bellême predecessors was the longstanding and bitter feud between the Giroie family, patrons of Orderic&#x27;s Abbey of Saint-Evroul, and the de Bellême family. William Talvas (de Bellême), Robert&#x27;s grandfather, had blinded and mutilated William fitz Giroie (for more on the feud between the Bellêmes and the Giroies see the article William I Talvas). He did at times appropriate church properties and was not a major donor to any ecclesiastical house but Robert&#x27;s attitudes toward the church are typical of many of his contemporaries; certainly no worse than the secular rulers and other magnates of his day. The assessment of William II Rufus by R.W. Southern could well apply to Robert de Bellême as well: &quot;His life was given over to military designs, and to the raising of money to make them possible; for everything that did not minister to those ends he showed a supreme contempt&quot;.

According to William Hunt in the Dictionary of National Biography, various stories of his brutality were circulated after his death, possibly inspiring the legend of Robert the Devil, a sadistically cruel Norman knight fathered by Satan himself. In Maine &quot;his abiding works are pointed to as the works of Robert the Devil, a surname that has been transferred from him to the father of the Conqueror.&quot;

==Family and children==

Robert married Agnes of Ponthieu, before 9 September 1087, and they had one child:
* William III of Ponthieu, who via his mother inherited the county of Ponthieu.

<doc id="604962" wikidata="Q227030" url="?curid=604962" title="Mark Shuttleworth">
<text>Mark Richard Shuttleworth (born 18 September 1973) is a South African and British entrepreneur who is the founder and CEO of Canonical, the company behind the development of the Linux-based Ubuntu operating system. In 2002, Shuttleworth became the first African to travel to space, doing so as a space tourist. He holds dual citizenship from South Africa and the United Kingdom. According to the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; in 2020, Shuttleworth is worth an estimated £500 million.

==Early life==
Shuttleworth was born in Welkom, Free State, South Africa, to a surgeon and a nursery-school teacher, Shuttleworth attended school at Western Province Preparatory School (where he eventually became Head Boy in 1986), followed by one term at Rondebosch Boys&#x27; High School, and then Bishops/Diocesan College where he was Head Boy in 1991. Shuttleworth obtained a Bachelor of Business Science degree in Finance and Information Systems at the University of Cape Town. As a student, he became involved in the installation of the first residential Internet connections at the university.

==Work==
In 1995, Shuttleworth founded Thawte Consulting, a company which specialized in digital certificates and Internet security. In December 1999, Shuttleworth sold Thawte to VeriSign, earning Shuttleworth R3.5 billion ( million, equivalent to $ million in ).

In September 2000, Shuttleworth formed HBD Venture Capital (&quot;Here be Dragons&quot;), a business incubator and venture capital provider now managed by Knife Capital. In March 2004 he formed Canonical Ltd., for the promotion and commercial support of free software projects, especially the Ubuntu operating system. In December 2009, Shuttleworth stepped down as the CEO of Canonical Ltd, with Jane Silber taking over the position. Shuttleworth returned to the position of CEO of Canonical in July 2017 at the end of Silber&#x27;s tenure.

==Linux and FOSS==
In the 1990s, Shuttleworth participated as one of the developers of the Debian operating system.

In 2001, he formed the Shuttleworth Foundation, a nonprofit organisation dedicated to social innovation which also funds educational, free, and open source software projects in South Africa, such as the Freedom Toaster.

In 2004, he returned to the free-software world by funding the development of Ubuntu, a Linux distribution based on Debian, through his company, Canonical Ltd.

In 2005, he founded the Ubuntu Foundation and made an initial investment of 10 million dollars. In the Ubuntu project, Shuttleworth is often referred to with the tongue-in-cheek title &quot;Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator for Life&quot; (SABDFL). To come up with a list of names of people to hire for the project, Shuttleworth took six months of Debian mailing list archives with him while travelling to Antarctica aboard the icebreaker &quot;Kapitan Khlebnikov&quot; in early 2004. In September 2005, he purchased a 65% stake of Impi Linux.

On 15 October 2006, it was announced that Mark Shuttleworth had become the first patron of KDE, the highest level of sponsorship available. This relationship ended in 2012, together with financial support for Kubuntu, the Ubuntu variant with KDE as main desktop.

On 17 December 2009, Shuttleworth announced that, effective March 2010, he would step down as CEO of Canonical to focus energy on product design, partnership, and customers. Jane Silber, COO at Canonical since 2004, took on the job of CEO at Canonical.

In September 2010, he received an honorary degree from the Open University for this work.

On 9 November 2012, Shuttleworth and Kenneth Rogoff took part in a debate opposite Garry Kasparov and Peter Thiel at the Oxford Union, entitled &quot;The Innovation Enigma&quot;.

On 25 October 2013, Shuttleworth and Ubuntu were awarded the Austrian anti-privacy &quot;Big Brother Award&quot; for sending local Ubuntu Unity Dash searches to Canonical servers by default. A year earlier, in 2012, Shuttleworth had defended the anonymisation method used. He later reversed the decision, and no current Ubuntu version does this.

==Spaceflight==
Shuttleworth gained worldwide fame on 25 April 2002, as the second self-funded space tourist (after Dennis Tito in 2001) and the first South African in space. Flying through Space Adventures, he launched aboard the Russian Soyuz TM-34 mission as a spaceflight participant, paying approximately US$20 million for the voyage (equivalent to $ million in ). Two days later, the Soyuz spacecraft arrived at the International Space Station, where he spent eight days participating in experiments related to AIDS and genome research. On 5 May 2002, he returned to Earth on Soyuz TM-33. In order to participate in the flight, Shuttleworth had to undergo one year of training and preparation, including seven months spent in Star City, Russia.

When he was in space, he spoke to Thabo Mbeki, then president of South Africa, on video link as part of the Freedom Day celebrations to mark the end of apartheid.

He also had a radio conversation with Nelson Mandela and a 14-year-old South African girl, Michelle Foster, who asked him to marry her. He dodged the question, stating that he was &quot;very honoured at the question&quot; before changing the subject. The terminally ill Foster was provided the opportunity to have a conversation with Mark Shuttleworth and Nelson Mandela by the Reach for a Dream foundation.

==Transport==
He has a private jet, a Bombardier Global Express, which is often referred to as &quot;Canonical One&quot; but is in fact owned through his HBD Venture Capital company. The dragon depicted on the side of the plane is Norman, the HBD Venture Capital mascot.

==Legal clash with the South African Reserve Bank==
Upon moving R2.5 billion in capital from South Africa to the Isle of Man, the South African Reserve Bank imposed a R250 million levy in order to release his assets. Shuttleworth won a case in the Supreme Court of Appeal to have the levy monies returned. However, on 18 June 2015 the Constitutional Court of South Africa reversed and set aside the findings of the lower courts, ruling that the dominant purpose of an exit charge was to regulate conduct rather than to raise revenue. The court held &quot;...that the exit charge was not inconsistent with the Constitution. The dominant purpose of the exit charge was not to raise revenue but rather to regulate conduct by discouraging the export of capital to protect the domestic economy.&quot;

<text>Tikunani (or Tigunānum) was a small Hurrian city-state in Mesopotamia around the middle of the second millennium BC. The name refers to both the kingdom and its capital city. Assuming it does refer to the same city, Tigunānum is the older form of the name, appearing in texts excavated from Mari and Shemshara around the 18th century BC.

==Sources==
All known sources are of unknown provenance. It has been suggested that they were illegally excavated in the 1990s. The cuneiform tablets bear a colophon which indicates they are part of a palace archive. Three tablets and two prisms, one administrative and one the Tikunani Prism are held in a private collection and have been published. Eleven tablets, five omen compendia, five administrative, and one lexical are held in the Schøyen Collection and have been published. Fifteen omen tablets are held in Japan in the Hirayama collection, yet unpublished. Two tablets, one omen and one administrative are held in separate private collections and have been published.

It has been reported that about 450 further Tikunani tablets were held in a private collection, of which 17 have been published. Those tablets have since been sold at auction and their whereabouts unknown. Before the sale they were transliterated by W. G. Lambert. Those transcriptions are slowly making their way into publication. The collection included about &quot;20 letters, 360 administrative texts, about 40 legal texts, 20 divinatory texts, a broken royal inscription, and a number of fragmentary school texts&quot;.

One of the private collection tablets, in Akkadian, from a Hittite king named only by the title &quot;tabarna&quot; is written to a vassal king, Tuniya (possibly the same as Tunip-Teššup), the ruler of Tikunani. In the letter the king extorts his vassal for support him in an attack against the city of Ḫaḫḫum who have been dealing with the Mitanni. The tablet is thought to date to the reign of Hittite ruler Hattusili I (c. 1650–1620 BC) though that is not certain. It has been suggested that this is a modern forgery. In the annals of Hattusilli I it is recorded that ruler Tunip-Teššup sent him a &quot;silver chariot&quot;.
==Location==
It was speculated that the location of Tikunani was in the area around Diyarbakir or Bismil. Later work suggested that the region of the Upper Habur River that lies off the Euphrates River as the probable region of provenance. 

==Tikunani Prism==
The Tikunani Prism is a clay artifact, 8½ inches tall with a square base roughly 2 by 2 inches, with an Akkadian cuneiform inscription listing the names of 438 Habiru soldiers of King Tunip-Teššup of Tikunani (a small North Mesopotamian kingdom). This king was a contemporary of King Hattusili I of the Hittites (around 1620 BC). It is of unknown provenance and is currently held in a private collection.

The discovery of this text generated much excitement, for it provided much-needed fresh evidence about the nature of the Habiru (or Hapiru) and their possible connection to the Biblical Hebrews. However, the majority of Tunip-Tessup&#x27;s Habiru soldiers recorded in the text had Hurrian names that could not be explained in any Canaanite language (the family which Hebrew belongs to) or any other Semitic language. The rest of the names are Semitic, except for one Kassite name.

<doc id="605002" wikidata="Q4850655" url="?curid=605002" title="Bale Grist Mill State Historic Park">
<text>Bale Grist Mill State Historic Park is a California state park located in Napa County between St. Helena and Calistoga. The park is the site of a water-powered grist mill that was built in 1846 is one of only two water-driven mills remaining west of the Mississippi River.

==History==
The mill was established in 1846 by Dr. Edward Turner Bale on property in Rancho Carne Humana land grant. Bale lived near the site until his death in 1849.

The gristmill and granary were built with local materials, Douglas firs and coast redwoods. Some timbers were cut to length with the bark left on, while others were roughed out with hand tools. The timbers were notched and held in place with wooden pegs as well as nails and screws. The foundation of the structure is native stone. The mill was powered by a waterwheel, with water diverted from Mill Creek nearby. A ditch carried the water from a millpond to a wooden flume, which brought the water to the top of the waterwheel. The first wheel did not provide enough power during dry summers and was replaced by a larger one, similar to the one at the mill today.

The mill was once the center of social activity as Napa Valley settlers gathered to have their corn and wheat ground into meal or flour. Farmers brought grain to the mill where it was placed into the boot of an elevator to be mechanically transported upstairs where it was cleaned by various types of equipment. The slow turning of the old grind stones and the dampness of the mill&#x27;s site gave the meal a special quality for making cornbread, yellowbread, shortening bread and spoonbread. As old timers put it, &quot;When meal comes to you that way, like the heated underside of a settin&#x27; hen, it bakes bread that makes city bread taste like cardboard.&quot;

Theodore Benedict Lyman bought the mill and surrounding land in 1871 and passed ownership on to his son, William Whittingham Lyman. The mill remained in operation until 1879.

==Restoration==
After William Lyman&#x27;s death, his wife, the former Mrs. Sarah A. Nowland deeded the property to Native Sons of the Golden West, and through them the mill was restored during a period in the late 1960s and early 1970s through efforts of the Native Son Parlors of Napa County, under the leadership of past Grand President Bismarck Bruck, a grandson of Dr. Bale.

The mill and its 36-foot water wheel are protected as a state historic landmark and have been partially restored. A trail connects the historic park to Bothe-Napa Valley State Park. Additionally, the park includes the site of the first church in the Napa Valley as well as the Pioneer Cemetery.

Visitors can hike from the mill on the historic trail to Bothe-Napa Valley State Park, which features extensive picnic facilities and a number of trails. The round trip hike from Bale Grist Mill State Historic Park to Bothe-Napa Valley State Park is approximately two miles.

In 2011 during the California budget crisis, the mill and adjacent park were among those targeted to be closed due to lack of funding. The Napa Valley State Park Association petitioned the state to operate the park in order to avoid closure. Milling demonstrations and tours of the historic mill are offered on weekends. Legislation was passed in 2014 to allow sale of flour produced at the mill to the public starting January 1, 2016 in order to help defray maintenance costs and preserve the mill.

<text>Earl of Yarmouth is a title that has been created three times in British history, once in the Peerage of England and twice in the Peerage of Great Britain. The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1679 in favour of the politician and scientist Robert Paston, 1st Viscount Yarmouth. He had already been created Baron Paston and Viscount Yarmouth in the Peerage of England in 1673. He was the son of William Paston, who had been created a Baronet, of Oxnead in the County of Norfolk, in the Baronetage of England in 1641. Lord Yarmouth was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He notably served as Treasurer of the Household between 1687 and 1689. He had no surviving male issue and the titles became extinct on his death in 1732.

The second creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1740 in favour of Amalie von Wallmoden, mistress of George II. She was made Baroness Yarmouth at the same time, also in the Peerage of England. The titles were for life only. Lady Yarmouth was the last Royal mistress to be awarded a peerage. She died in 1765.

The third creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1793 in favour of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Earl of Hertford. He was made Marquess of Hertford at the same time. See this article for more information on this creation.

<doc id="605011" wikidata="Q841170" url="?curid=605011" title="AM–GM inequality">
<text>In mathematics, the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, or more briefly the AM–GM inequality, states that the arithmetic mean of a list of non-negative real numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the same list; and further, that the two means are equal if and only if every number in the list is the same (in which case they are both that number).

The simplest non-trivial case is for two non-negative numbers and , that is,
:formula_1
with equality if and only if . This follows from the fact that the square of a real number is always non-negative (greater than or equal to zero) and from the identity :
:formula_2
Hence , with equality when , i.e. . The AM–GM inequality then follows from taking the positive square root of both sides and then dividing both sides by &quot;2&quot;.

For a geometrical interpretation, consider a rectangle with sides of length  and ; it has perimeter and area . Similarly, a square with all sides of length has the perimeter and the same area as the rectangle. The simplest non-trivial case of the AM–GM inequality implies for the perimeters that and that only the square has the smallest perimeter amongst all rectangles of equal area.

The simplest case is implicit in Euclid&#x27;s Elements, Book 5, Proposition 25.

Extensions of the AM–GM inequality treat weighted means and generalized means.

== Background ==

The &quot;arithmetic mean&quot;, or less precisely the &quot;average&quot;, of a list of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by :

:formula_3

The &quot;geometric mean&quot; is similar, except that it is only defined for a list of &quot;nonnegative&quot; real numbers, and uses multiplication and a root in place of addition and division:

:formula_4

If , this is equal to the exponential of the arithmetic mean of the natural logarithms of the numbers:

:formula_5

== The inequality ==

Restating the inequality using mathematical notation, we have that for any list of nonnegative real numbers ,

:formula_6

and that equality holds if and only if .

== Geometric interpretation ==

In two dimensions, is the perimeter of a rectangle with sides of length  and . Similarly, is the perimeter of a square with the same area, , as that rectangle. Thus for the AM–GM inequality states that a rectangle of a given area has the smallest perimeter if that rectangle is also a square.

The full inequality is an extension of this idea to dimensions. Consider an -dimensional box with edge lengths . 
Every vertex of the box is connected to edges of different directions, so the average length of edges incident to the vertex is .
On the other hand, formula_7 is the edge length of an -dimensional cube of equal volume, which therefore is also the average length of edges incident to a vertex of the cube.

Thus the AM–GM inequality states that only the -cube has the smallest average length of edges connected to each vertex amongst all -dimensional boxes with the same volume.

==Examples==

===Example 1===

If formula_8, then the AM-GM inequality tells us that

:formula_9

===Example 2===

A simple upper bound for formula_10 can be found. AM-GM tells us

:formula_11

:formula_12

and so

:formula_13

with equality at formula_14.

Equivalently,

:formula_15

===Example 3===

Consider the function

:formula_16

for all positive real numbers , and . Suppose we wish to find the minimal value of this function. It can be rewritten as:
:formula_17
with
:formula_18

Applying the AM–GM inequality for , we get

:formula_19

Further, we know that the two sides are equal exactly when all the terms of the mean are equal:

:formula_20

All the points satisfying these conditions lie on a half-line starting at the origin and are given by

:formula_21

==Applications==

=== Cauchy-Schwarz inequality ===
The AM-GM equality can be used to prove the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.

=== Annualized returns ===
In financial mathematics, the AM-GM inequality shows that the annualized return, the geometric mean, is less than the average annual return, the arithmetic mean.

=== Nonnegative polynomials ===
The Motzkin polynomial formula_22 is a nonnegative polynomial which is not a sum of square polynomials. It can be proven nonnegative using the AM-GM inequality with formula_23, formula_24, and formula_25, that is, formula_26 Simplifying and multiplying both sides by 3 gives formula_27 so formula_28

==Proofs of the AM–GM inequality==
The AM–GM inequality can be proven in many ways.

===Proof using Jensen&#x27;s inequality===

Jensen&#x27;s inequality states that the value of a concave function of an arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the arithmetic mean of the function&#x27;s values. Since the logarithm function is concave, we have

:formula_29

Taking antilogs of the far left and far right sides, we have the AM–GM inequality.

===Proof by successive replacement of elements===

We have to show that

:formula_30

with equality only when all numbers are equal.

If not all numbers are equal, then there exist formula_31 such that formula_32. Replacing by formula_33 and by formula_34 will leave the arithmetic mean of the numbers unchanged, but will increase the geometric mean because

:formula_35

If the numbers are still not equal, we continue replacing numbers as above. After at most formula_36 such replacement steps all the numbers will have been replaced with formula_33 while the geometric mean strictly increases at each step. After the last step, the geometric mean will be formula_38, proving the inequality.

It may be noted that the replacement strategy works just as well from the right hand side. If any of the numbers is 0 then so will the geometric mean thus proving the inequality trivially. Therefore we may suppose that all the numbers are positive. If they are not all equal, then there exist formula_31 such that formula_40. Replacing formula_41 by formula_42 and formula_43 by formula_44leaves the geometric mean unchanged but strictly decreases the arithmetic mean since

:formula_45. The proof then follows along similar lines as in the earlier replacement.

===Induction proofs===

====Proof by induction #1====

Of the non-negative real numbers , the AM–GM statement is equivalent to
:formula_46
with equality if and only if for all .

For the following proof we apply mathematical induction and only well-known rules of arithmetic.

Induction basis: For the statement is true with equality.

Induction hypothesis: Suppose that the AM–GM statement holds for all choices of non-negative real numbers.

Induction step: Consider non-negative real numbers , . Their arithmetic mean satisfies
:formula_47
If all the are equal to , then we have equality in the AM–GM statement and we are done. In the case where some are not equal to , there must exist one number that is greater than the arithmetic mean , and one that is smaller than . Without loss of generality, we can reorder our in order to place these two particular elements at the end: and . Then

:formula_48

:formula_49

Now define with
:formula_50
and consider the numbers which are all non-negative. Since

:formula_51

:formula_52

Thus, is also the arithmetic mean of numbers and the induction hypothesis implies

:formula_53

Due to (*) we know that

:formula_54

hence

:formula_55

in particular . Therefore, if at least one of the numbers is zero, then we already have strict inequality in (**). Otherwise the right-hand side of (**) is positive and strict inequality is obtained by using the estimate (***) to get a lower bound of the right-hand side of (**). Thus, in both cases we can substitute (***) into (**) to get

:formula_56

which completes the proof.

==== Proof by induction #2 ====

First of all we shall prove that for real numbers and there follows

:formula_57

Indeed, multiplying both sides of the inequality by , gives

:formula_58

whence the required inequality is obtained immediately.

Now, we are going to prove that for positive real numbers satisfying
, there holds

:formula_59

The equality holds only if .

Induction basis: For the statement is true because of the above property.

Induction hypothesis: Suppose that the statement is true for all natural numbers up to .

Induction step: Consider natural number , i.e. for positive real numbers , there holds . There exists at least one , so there must be at least one . Without loss of generality, we let and .

Further, the equality we shall write in the form of . Then, the induction hypothesis implies

:formula_60

However, taking into account the induction basis, we have

:formula_61

which completes the proof.

For positive real numbers , let&#x27;s denote

:formula_62

The numbers satisfy the condition . So we have

:formula_63

whence we obtain

:formula_64

with the equality holding only for .

===Proof by Cauchy using forward–backward induction===

The following proof by cases relies directly on well-known rules of arithmetic but employs the rarely used technique of forward-backward-induction. It is essentially from Augustin Louis Cauchy and can be found in his &quot;Cours d&#x27;analyse&quot;.

==== The case where all the terms are equal ====

If all the terms are equal:

:formula_65

then their sum is , so their arithmetic mean is ; and their product is , so their geometric mean is ; therefore, the arithmetic mean and geometric mean are equal, as desired.

==== The case where not all the terms are equal ====

It remains to show that if &quot;not&quot; all the terms are equal, then the arithmetic mean is greater than the geometric mean. Clearly, this is only possible when .

This case is significantly more complex, and we divide it into subcases.

===== The subcase where &quot;n&quot; = 2 =====

If , then we have two terms, and , and since (by our assumption) not all terms are equal, we have:

:formula_66

hence

:formula_67

as desired.

===== The subcase where &quot;n&quot; = 2&quot;k&quot; =====

Consider the case where , where is a positive integer. We proceed by mathematical induction.

In the base case, , so . We have already shown that the inequality holds when , so we are done.

Now, suppose that for a given , we have already shown that the inequality holds for , and we wish to show that it holds for . To do so, we apply the inequality twice for numbers and once for numbers to obtain:

:formula_68

where in the first inequality, the two sides are equal only if

:formula_69

and

:formula_70

(in which case the first arithmetic mean and first geometric mean are both equal to , and similarly with the second arithmetic mean and second geometric mean); and in the second inequality, the two sides are only equal if the two geometric means are equal. Since not all numbers are equal, it is not possible for both inequalities to be equalities, so we know that:

:formula_71

as desired.

===== The subcase where &quot;n&quot; &lt; 2&quot;k&quot; =====

If is not a natural power of , then it is certainly &quot;less&quot; than some natural power of 2, since the sequence is unbounded above. Therefore, without loss of generality, let be some natural power of that is greater than .

So, if we have terms, then let us denote their arithmetic mean by , and expand our list of terms thus:

:formula_72

We then have:

: formula_73

so

:formula_74

and

:formula_75

as desired.
===Proof by induction using basic calculus===

The following proof uses mathematical induction and some basic differential calculus.

Induction basis: For the statement is true with equality.

Induction hypothesis: Suppose that the AM–GM statement holds for all choices of non-negative real numbers.

Induction step: In order to prove the statement for non-negative real numbers , we need to prove that

:formula_76

with equality only if all the numbers are equal.

If all numbers are zero, the inequality holds with equality. If some but not all numbers are zero, we have strict inequality. Therefore, we may assume in the following, that all numbers are positive.

We consider the last number as a variable and define the function
:formula_77

Proving the induction step is equivalent to showing that for all , with only if and  are all equal. This can be done by analyzing the critical points of  using some basic calculus.

The first derivative of is given by

:formula_78

A critical point has to satisfy , which means

:formula_79

After a small rearrangement we get
:formula_80

and finally

:formula_81

which is the geometric mean of . This is the only critical point of . Since for all , the function  is strictly convex and has a strict global minimum at . Next we compute the value of the function at this global minimum:

:formula_82

where the final inequality holds due to the induction hypothesis. The hypothesis also says that we can have equality only when are all equal. In this case, their geometric mean   has the same value, Hence, unless are all equal, we have . This completes the proof.

This technique can be used in the same manner to prove the generalized AM–GM inequality and Cauchy–Schwarz inequality in Euclidean space .

===Proof by Pólya using the exponential function===

George Pólya provided a proof similar to what follows. Let for all real , with first derivative and second derivative . Observe that , and for all real , hence is strictly convex with the absolute minimum at . Hence for all real  with equality only for .

Consider a list of non-negative real numbers . If they are all zero, then the AM–GM inequality holds with equality. Hence we may assume in the following for their arithmetic mean . By -fold application of the above inequality, we obtain that

:formula_83

with equality if and only if for every . The argument of the exponential function can be simplified:

:formula_84

Returning to ,

:formula_85

which produces , hence the result
:formula_86

===Proof by Lagrangian multipliers===

If any of the formula_41 are formula_88, then there is nothing to prove. So we may assume all the formula_41 are strictly positive.

Because the arithmetic and geometric means are homogeneous of degree 1, without loss of generality assume that formula_90. Set formula_91, and formula_92. The inequality will be proved (together with the equality case) if we can show that the minimum of formula_93 subject to the constraint formula_94 is equal to formula_95, and the minimum is only achieved when formula_96. Let us first show that the constrained minimization problem has a global minimum.

Set formula_97. Since the intersection formula_98 is compact, the extreme value theorem guarantees that the minimum of formula_99 subject to the constraints formula_100 and formula_101 is attained at some point inside formula_102. On the other hand, observe that if any of the formula_103, then formula_104, while formula_105, and formula_106. This means that the minimum inside formula_98 is in fact a global minimum, since the value of formula_108 at any point inside formula_98 is certainly no smaller than the minimum, and the value of formula_108 at any point formula_111 not inside formula_102 is strictly bigger than the value at formula_113, which is no smaller than the minimum.

The method of Lagrange multipliers says that the global minimum is attained at a point formula_114 where the gradient of formula_115 is formula_116 times the gradient of formula_117, for some formula_116. We will show that the only point at which this happens is when formula_96 and formula_120

Compute
formula_121
and

: formula_122

along the constraint. Setting the gradients proportional to one another therefore gives for each formula_123 that formula_124 and so formula_125 Since the left-hand side does not depend on formula_123, it follows that formula_127, and since formula_128, it follows that formula_129 and formula_130, as desired.

==Generalizations==

===Weighted AM–GM inequality===

There is a similar inequality for the weighted arithmetic mean and weighted geometric mean. Specifically, let the nonnegative numbers and the nonnegative weights be given. Set . If , then the inequality

: formula_131

holds with equality if and only if all the with are equal. Here the convention is used.

If all , this reduces to the above inequality of arithmetic and geometric means.

One stronger version of this, which also gives strengthened version of the unweighted version, is due to Aldaz. Specifically, let the nonnegative numbers and the nonnegative weights be given. Assume further that the sum of the weights is 1. Then
:formula_132.

====Proof using Jensen&#x27;s inequality====

Using the finite form of Jensen&#x27;s inequality for the natural logarithm, we can prove the inequality between the weighted arithmetic mean and the weighted geometric mean stated above.

Since an with weight has no influence on the inequality, we may assume in the following that all weights are positive. If all are equal, then equality holds. Therefore, it remains to prove strict inequality if they are not all equal, which we will assume in the following, too. If at least one is zero (but not all), then the weighted geometric mean is zero, while the weighted arithmetic mean is positive, hence strict inequality holds. Therefore, we may assume also that all are positive.

Since the natural logarithm is strictly concave, the finite form of Jensen&#x27;s inequality and the functional equations of the natural logarithm imply
:formula_133

Since the natural logarithm is strictly increasing,
:formula_134

===Matrix arithmetic–geometric mean inequality===
Most matrix generalizations of the arithmetic geometric mean inequality apply on the level of unitarily invariant norms, since, even if the matrices formula_135 and formula_136 are positive semi-definite, the matrix formula_137 may not be positive semi-definite and hence may not have a canonical square root. In Bhatia and Kittaneh proved that for any unitarily invariant norm formula_138 and positive semi-definite matrices formula_135 and formula_136 it is the case that
:formula_141
Later, in the same authors proved the stronger inequality that
:formula_142
Finally, it is known for dimension formula_143 that the following strongest possible matrix generalization of the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality holds, and it is conjectured to hold for all formula_144
:formula_145

This conjectured inequality was shown by Stephen Drury in 2012. Indeed, he proved
:formula_146

===Finance: Link to geometric asset returns===

In finance much research is concerned with accurately estimating the rate of return of an asset over multiple periods in the future. In the case of lognormal asset returns, there is an exact formula to compute the arithmetic asset return from the geometric asset return.

For simplicity, assume we are looking at yearly geometric returns over a time horizon of years, i.e.
:formula_147

where:

:formula_148 = value of the asset at time formula_144,
:formula_150 = value of the asset at time formula_151.

The geometric and arithmetic returns are respectively defined as

:formula_152
:formula_153

When the yearly geometric asset returns are lognormally distributed, then the following formula can be used to convert the geometric average return to the arithemtic average return:

:formula_154

where formula_155 is the variance of the observed asset returns This implicit equation for can be solved exactly as follows. First, notice that by setting
:formula_156
we obtain a polynomial equation of degree 2:

:formula_157

Solving this equation for and using the definition of , we obtain 4 possible solutions for :

:formula_158

However, notice that

:formula_159

This implies that the only 2 possible solutions are (as asset returns are real numbers):

:formula_160

Finally, we expect the derivative of with respect to to be non-negative as an increase in the geometric return should never cause a decrease in the arithmetic return. Indeed, both measure the average growth of an asset&#x27;s value and therefore should move in similar directions. This leaves us with one solution to the implicit equation for , namely

:formula_161

Therefore, under the assumption of lognormally distributed asset returns, the arithmetic asset return is fully determined by the geometric asset return.

===Other generalizations===

Other generalizations of the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means include:
* Muirhead&#x27;s inequality,
* Maclaurin&#x27;s inequality,
* QM-AM-GM-HM inequalities,
* Generalized mean inequality,
* Means of complex numbers.

<text>Esteghlal Football Club (استقلال), commonly known as Esteghlal (meaning &#x27;The Independence&#x27;), is the oldest Iranian professional football club based in Tehran that competes in the Persian Gulf Pro League. The club was founded in 1945 as &#x27;The Cyclists&#x27; ( , Dočarxe-Savârân) and was known as Tâj (تاج; meaning &#x27;The Crown&#x27;) between 1949 and 1979. The club is part of the multisport club Esteghlal Athletic and Cultural Company of Iran. They were the first team to reach 1,000 points in the Persian Gulf Pro League.

After the 1979 revolution, the club&#x27;s women&#x27;s team was dissolved and the progress of women&#x27;s football in Iran was tied to politics. Since the 1973–74 season, Esteghlal has played its home games at the Azadi, which has a seating capacity of 78,116, though it can hold more people during important matches. Esteghlal set an attendance record for an Asian Club Championship match in 1999 when 121,000 supporters watched their final against Júbilo Iwata in Tehran. Esteghlal Club has an average of 3 to 11 million viewers in each of its games on television and cyberspace.

==History==

=== 1945–69: early years, The Crown ===
On 20 September 1945, some young athletes and students including a 23-year-old military officer Parviz Khosravani (first manager of the club), Asghar Navaab (Bicycle Mechanic), Enayat Jananpour (National Sports Organisation staff member), Mirzaee (carpenter) and Khashaaei (bank guard) established a sports club on Ferdowsi Street, Tehran. Since the founders of the club were mostly interested in cycling, the club&#x27;s original name was &quot;Docharkheh Savaran&quot; (; meaning &#x27;The Cyclists&#x27;), in 1945. Esteghlal football club played its first official match in 1946.

In the first year, the 1946 season, they stood in second place of Tehran Football League and Tehran Hazfi Cup. The 1947 season ended with the first ever Esteghlal&#x27;s cup, after victories to reach the Tehran Hazfi Cup. Docharkhe Savaran founders and players agreed with the rename of the club to &quot;Taj&quot; (; meaning &#x27;The Crown&#x27;), in 1949.

From the beginning Taj or Docharkeh Savaran competed in the Tehran Local League, which at the time was the highest ranked league in Iran. On 6 March 1950, Taj played its first official game in Amjadieh Stadium against Shahin; Taj managed a 1–0 win.

Taj won seven first titles in the 1950s and 1960s; 1949–1950, 1951–1952, 1957–1958 and the three consecutive championships in 1959–1960, 1960–1961 and 1961–1962 (in the following years Taj added its first titles from the Tehran Provincial League and the Tehran Hazfi Cup) and again in 1963–1964 season.

Taj also won four Tehran Hazfi Cup in 1947, 1951, 1958 and 1959. The most successful club in Iran between that years, so far than other great teams like Daraei with three first titles and Shahin with two first titles and four-second place. The first national cup was obtained in 1957 National Football League after victory against Tabriz team by three goals.Taj represented tehrans&#x27;s football in those games which played in Bagh-e-Homayun ground.
Tehran old derby was a sensitive match which played between TAJ and Shahin in mid century, until 1967.

=== 1970–78: champion of Asia and Iran ===
The 1970 Asian Club Championship was the 3rd edition of the annual Asian club football competition hosted by Asian Football Confederation. Seven clubs from seven countries competed in the tournament. The tournament was held in Tehran, Iran in April. The clubs were split in two groups and the group winners and runners-up advanced to semi-finals.

Taj defeated Hapoel Tel Aviv of Israel 2–1 in the final to win its first ever Asian Club Championship and started new era in Iranian football with announced of professionalisation of football in Iran.
This year had another honour for TAJ, the first Iranian national league title: 1970–71 Local League under management of Rajkov. TAJ defeated PAS 2–1 in final match. TAJ have reached to third place of 1971 Asian Club Championship, a year after the first Asian Cup of club. They were defeated ROK Army of Korea 3–2 in Third place match.

Esteghlal stood at second place in the 1973–74 league, with only two points less than Persepolis. Gholam Hossein Mazloumi was the top scorer of the league, with 15 goals. TAJ reached the 1974–75 Takht Jamshid Cup the next year, the second official Iranian Football League for Club. Mazloumi was still the best scorer. Social tensions came to the club, a rebellion against the system which named revolution in next years.

=== 1979–2001: revolution and post-revolution ===
After the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, the club was taken over by the newly established Islamic government and put under the control of the Physical Education Organization of the Islamic republic of Iran (), a governmental organisation, and changed its name to Esteghlal (Persian: ), &#x27;Independence&#x27; in Persian; Taj () means &#x27;Crown&#x27; in Persian. All players not swearing allegiance to the new Islamic government were arrested, brutally beaten and executed by Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guard Corps. After the revolution, any sign of the previous monarchist regime was not tolerated.

During the 1980s, Esteghlal won the Tehran Football League twice. The 1989–90 season was a memorable one for Esteghlal. The club finished 1st in Group B of the Qods League and advanced to the semi-finals. Esteghlal defeated Malavan 4–0 on aggregate to advance to the final against the rival: Persepolis. Esteghlal defeated Persepolis 2–1 to win the Qods League. In the following season, Esteghlal made it to the final of the Hazfi Cup only to lose to Malavan on penalties.

1990–91 Esteghlal won the Asian Club Championship for the 2nd time defeating Chinese club Liaoning 2–1. In the next year Esteghlal reached the 1991 Asian Club Championship final match again and lost in penalties to Al-Hilal FC. Esteghlal once again reached the final of the Asian Club Championship in 1999, this time losing to Japanese club Júbilo Iwata 1–2 in Tehran.

=== 2001–present: Iran Pro League Era ===

2001 marked the first year of the newly founded Iran Pro League. Going into the final day, Esteghlal was on top of the league&#x27;s table; however, with an Esteghlal loss and a Persepolis win, Persepolis was crowned as the league&#x27;s inaugural champion. However, the 2001–02 Hazfi Cup provided some consolation for Esteghlal as they beat Fajr Sepasi 4–3 on aggregate to win the cup. The 2002–03 season was one of the worst years in club history, as they finished 9th and were eliminated in the group stage of the AFC Champions League.

In July 2003, Amir Ghalenoi was appointed manager of Esteghlal. In his first year, Esteghlal finished runner-up in the league behind the champion Pas Tehran. Ghalenoi also made it to the final of the Hazfi Cup losing 2–5 on aggregate to Sepahan. His second season proved to be less successful as Esteghlal finished 3rd and failed to qualify to the AFC Champions League. However, the 2005–06 season Esteghlal were crowned champions of the Iran Pro League for the first time in the Pro League era.

In 2006 after the departure of Amir Ghalenoi, his assistant and youth team coach Samad Marfavi took over the head-coaching job. Esteghlal had a disappointing season, finishing fourth, thus failing to secure a spot in the AFC Champions League, as well as only reaching the Round of 16 in the Hazfi Cup with a shock defeat by Fajr Sepasi. After Marfavi&#x27;s departure in August 2007, Nasser Hejazi took over; but after only 14 games and 4 defeats, Hejazi was fired as manager in November 2007. Firouz Karimi was hired as the temporary head coach for the remainder of the season; he did not fare much better than Hejazi and the team finished 13th in the league, its lowest finish ever. Firouz Karimi was fired in May 2008 and Amir Ghalenoi was hired again in July 2008.
He regrouped the team and the Hazfi Cup proved to be a valuable consolation, as Esteghlal became champions after defeating Pegah Gilan 3–1 on aggregate, thus securing a Champions League spot after a two-year absence. During Ghalenoi&#x27;s first full and only season in his second stint with Esteghlal, he led the team to an Iran Pro League championship, finishing ahead of Zob Ahan on goal difference. However, after a group stage exit in the AFC Champions League, Ghalenoi resigned.

Samad Marfavi took the reins of Esteghlal for a second time; Marfavi led the team to a 3rd place league finish in the 2009–10 season and also led the team to the Round of 16 of the AFC Champions League, losing to Al Shabab of Saudi Arabia 2–3 on aggregate. In the spring of 2010, Marfavi extended his contract for another year, but strangely a few days later he resigned. This time Esteghlal turned to Parviz Mazloumi, a former Esteghlal player in the 1980s. During his 2-year tenure with Esteghlal, he led the team to 2nd and 3rd place league finishes, as well as a Hazfi Cup trophy in 2012. After a 0–2 loss to fellow countrymen Sepahan in the Round 16 of the AFC Champions League, Mazloumi was sacked by the club and Amir Ghalenoi took the reins of Esteghlal for a third time.

The new era started for Esteghlal. Ghalenoi had no trouble leading Esteghlal to a league victory in his first season back. The team also made it to the semi-finals of the Hazfi Cup which they eventually lost to Sepahan. The year was also marked by advancing to the AFC Champions League semi-finals where they met Korean side FC Seoul. After a 0–2 away loss in the first leg, Esteghlal faced an uphill task; they returned to Azadi Stadium but eventually lost to FC Seoul 2–4 on aggregate.

The next season however was a disappointing one for Ghalenoi and his team. With a chance to win the league on the final match day, Esteghlal lost 1–3 to Tractor Sazi and dropped to 5th place, and out of a champions league slot. Esteghlal also faced a shock defeat at the hands of Mes Kerman in the Hazfi Cup semi-finals. To top off Esteghlal&#x27;s horrendous year, the team failed to reach the AFC Champions League knock-out stage, finishing 3rd in its group.

After Esteghlal&#x27;s defeat to Zob Ahan in the Hazfi Cup final on 29 May 2016, Parviz Mazloomi was fired and replaced by former player and Naft Tehran&#x27;s head coach Alireza Mansourian on 1 June 2016. Esteghlal started the season poorly and were knocked out of the Hazfi Cup in the Quarter-finals by Naft Tehran. The club was also issued a transfer ban for the 2017 winter period for outstanding debts to Adil Chihi. On 7 February 2017, Esteghlal defeated Qatari club Al Sadd on penalties to advance to the 2017 AFC Champions League group stage. Esteghlal was defeated by Al Ain 6–1 on quarter final of 2017 AFC Champions League and was eliminated. Mansourian was the head coach of Esteghlal until 7th week of 2017–18 season of Persian Gulf Pro League. Mansourian resigned after accumulating only 5 points in 7 matches and standing on 16th position. German coach Winfried Schäfer was appointed as new manager of Esteghlal Tehran on 1 October 2017, replacing Alireza Mansourian. He was fired in the spring of 2019 and Farhad Majidi replaced him, but was fired at the end of the season.

In June 2019, Italian coach Andrea Stramaccioni was appointed as Esteghlal&#x27;s coach, but he later left the club in December 2019 due to financial insolvency.

==Crest and symbols and estate==
Unveiled in 1946, Docharkhehsavaran&#x27;s first crest featured a blue cyclist cycling. In 1950 following change of club&#x27;s name the crest changed to two interlocking rings on both sides of Pahlavi crown.

Before the revolution, the Taj sports complex had 5 sports clubs in Tehran and 66 clubs in the cities. Taj also had clubs in Turkey (under the name of Tajspor club) and Qatar. Taj clubs in Tehran include Taj Central Palace on Baharestan Street, Pele Sports Club on Nizam Abad Street, Taj Women&#x27;s Club on Los Angeles Street (now Hijab), Taj Tennis Club on Pahlavi Street (now Veli Asr) and Reza Pahlavi club was in Naziabad. Taj also had two sports stores in Tehran on Shahreza and Baharestan streets. With the Iranian revolution and on 28 February, the Taj Central Palace and other places belonging to the Taj Club were taken over by the Revolutionary Committees.

The sports facilities were given to the Physical Training Organization and the administrative facilities or other services such as the sports store of the club were handed over to organizations such as the Islamic Propaganda Organization. Esteghlal Club&#x27;s efforts to reclaim these places have not been successful so far.

==Colours==
Esteghlal wore blue shirts from the beginning with white or blue shorts and socks. The second colour of the club is white.

==Rivalries==

===Tehran derby===

The club&#x27;s biggest rival and its opponent in the Tehran derby is Persepolis. The first derby match between the clubs took place on 5 April 1968, at Amjadieh Stadium.

In 1995, IRIFF began to invite foreign referees to officiate the derby to ease fans&#x27; and players&#x27; suspicions of referee bias. This occurred after the events of the 38th derby (20 January 1995) in which Persepolis was leading by a score of 2–0 until the 79th minute when Esteghlal scored two goals within 8 minutes to erase the deficit; the 1st goal was scored from the penalty spot which angered the Persepolis fans and players who felt the referee was biased towards Esteghlal. Persepolis fans stormed the field in the 88th minute and fights broke out on the pitch between fans and players. Following the match, it was decided that Iranian referees would no longer be used for the derby. After 14 years of foreign referees, the second leg of the 2008–09 season saw an Iranian once again refereeing the derby. The game ended in a draw.

==Supporters==

Esteghlal is one of the most supported teams in Iran and Asia. The club is based in Tehran and is popular in all parts of the country. Esteghlal also has a fan base in the United States, Europe and Persian Gulf countries.
The match between Esteghlal and Jubilo Iwata in the 1998–99 Asian Club Championship final with 125,000 spectators is known as the most watched match in Asia, which was played at Azadi Stadium.

After the 1979 revolution, female fans were banned from entering stadiums in Iran. Finally, with international efforts, this ban was lifted in 2022 and female Esteghlal fans entered the stadiums in this year for the first time.

==Grounds==
Azadi Stadium is Iran&#x27;s national stadium and the largest in the country. Azadi Stadium officially had a capacity of 100,000 people at the beginning and was built to host the 1974 Asian Games. The stadium is part of the much larger Azadi Sports Complex and is surrounded by a rowing river, football training pitches, a weightlifting complex, swimming facilities and indoor volleyball and futsal courts, among many other amenities. Today, Azadi Stadium has a capacity of 78,116 after renovations in 2016.

Esteghlal&#x27;s home stadium is &quot;Azadi&quot; (), a football stadium in Tehran, Iran. The stadium&#x27;s former name was Aryamehr Stadium which was changed after the Iranian Revolution. Prior to the construction of &quot;Azadi&quot;, Esteghlal used to play their games at Amjadieh Stadium.

===Season-by-season===
== Esteghlal W.F.C. ==
Esteghlal was the first club in Iran that established a team for women&#x27;s football. To reach this goal the club has made some Camps for training players.

The first attempts to launch women&#x27;s football in Iran began in the late 1960s. In 1969, with the increase in the number of women interested in football in Iran, the Football Federation sent several women to FIFA training courses. During the trip, Iranian coaches were able to watch matches of Asian women&#x27;s soccer teams such as South Korea, India and Singapore, held at the venue. Iranian football authorities then decided to form women&#x27;s soccer teams at the club level. Esteghlal F.C. (TAJ) was the first Iranian club to establish a women&#x27;s soccer training class and set up its own women&#x27;s team.

The women&#x27;s team which competed in the Kowsar Women Football League was dissolved in 2016 due to financial issues.

<text>Anna Linderfelt Fisher (1878 – October 17, 1939) was an American Red Cross worker who ran an orphanage in Damascus. She was an advisor to Faisal I of Iraq in the short-lived Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920, and held the rank of captain in the Syrian army. In 1927 she was appointed to the Ministry of Education in Iraq.

==Early life==
Anna Linderfelt (or Linderfeldt) Fisher was born in Milwaukee, but was often described as being from New York, or from California, either Pasadena or Santa Barbara, depending on the source. She was the daughter of Swedish-born librarian Klas August Linderfelt and Margaret Eliza Parker Linderfelt. Her elder brother, Karl Linderfelt, was a Colorado National Guardsman involved in the Ludlow Massacre. Anna Linderfelt was educated in Paris.

==Career==
During World War I, Fisher joined the Red Cross to do relief work in France, and later moved to working in Damascus. In 1919, she held the rank of captain in the Syrian army. She was described as &quot;unofficial ruler of the Arab Kingdom of Syria&quot;, in reference to her role as advisor to Faisal I of Iraq. She organized schools, encouraged the development of traditional handicrafts, and ran the American Red Cross orphanage in Damascus.

From 1922 to 1927, she was in New York City, managing the restaurant at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She also donated art objects to the museum during this period. Soon after she resigned from that position, Fisher was appointed an attache to Iraq&#x27;s Ministry of Education, based in Baghdad. In 1933, the year Faisal died, she published a reminiscence, &quot;My Memories of King Faisal&quot;, in &quot;Asia&quot; magazine.

==Personal life==
Anna Linderfelt was engaged to architect Oswald Constantin Hering IV in 1900, while she was living in Paris. She married mining engineer William Bowditch Fisher after 1901. The couple lived in Boston and wintered in Santa Barbara, but they were living in Paris before World War I. They had a daughter, Frances Fisher (later Collins), born in Idaho in 1907. Anna L. Fisher died in 1939, at her daughter&#x27;s home in Millbrook, New York, aged 61 years.

<text>Earl of Londonderry is a title that has been created three times in the Peerage of Ireland. The first creation came in 1622 in favour of Thomas Ridgeway, 1st Baron Ridgeway, who served as Treasurer of Ireland and was involved in the colonisation of Ulster. He had already been created a Baronet, of Torrington in the County of Devon, in 1611, Lord Ridgeway, Baron of Gallen-Ridgeway, in the Peerage of Ireland, in 1616, and was made Viscount Gallen-Ridgeway at the same time as he was granted the earldom, also in the Peerage of Ireland. The titles became extinct on the death of his great-grandson, the fourth Earl, in 1714.

The second creation came in 1726 in favour of the soldier and politician Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Londonderry. He had already been created Baron Londonderry in 1719 and was made Viscount Gallen-Ridgeway at the same time as he was granted the earldom, also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was the husband of Lady Frances Ridgeway, daughter and heiress of the fourth Earl of the first creation. A member of the prominent Pitt family, he was the uncle of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. His younger son, the third Earl (who succeeded his elder brother), represented Camelford in Parliament. The titles became extinct on his death in 1765.

The third creation came in 1796 in favour of Robert Stewart, 1st Viscount Castlereagh, already created Baron Londonderry in 1789. He was created Marquess of Londonderry in 1816. See the latter title for more information on this creation.

<text>Kent Walton (22 August 1917 – 24 August 2003), born Kenneth Walton Beckett, was a British television sports commentator, presenter and actor. He is best remembered as the predominant commentator on ITV&#x27;s coverage of British professional wrestling from 1955 to 1988.

==Early life ==
Despite a transatlantic accent which led many to believe he was Canadian, he was born in Cairo, Egypt, the son of the finance minister in the colonial government, and he grew up at Haslemere in Surrey. He was educated at Charterhouse.

He attended the Embassy School of Acting in London and appeared in rep. On the outbreak of war in 1939, he joined the Royal Air Force, serving in Bomber Command as a radio operator and front gunner. He acquired his accent mixing with Canadian airmen.

==Sports commentator==
After the end of the war he returned to acting before commentating on tennis and football. He made his television wrestling commentary debut on the ITV network in November 1955, a job he kept for 33 years. At its peak in the 1970s, ITV&#x27;s wrestling coverage, on &quot;World of Sport&quot;, could command up to 12 million between the football half-time and full-time results (4–4.40 pm) on Saturdays. Although fans of ITV&#x27;s wrestling coverage reportedly included the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen Mother and Margaret Thatcher, enthusiasm was not shared by ITV&#x27;s Head of Sport, Greg Dyke, and in 1988 he dropped the sport, a blow from which the traditional British style of the sport, although it has survived to the present, has never fully recovered.

==Presenter ==
Walton was a disc jockey on Radio Luxembourg, and for a time presented several tv music shows:- &quot;Honey Hit Parade&quot;, and then &quot;Cool for Cats&quot; from 1956 to 1961, then Discs A Gogo for TWW Television from 1961 to 1965. In the early sixties, he also acted as a judge on &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; on ITV.

==Producer==
In the early 1970s, he was involved with British sexploitation movies and is credited as a producer of such films as &quot;Clinic Exclusive&quot;, aka &quot;Clinic Xclusive&quot;, aka &quot;With These Hands&quot; (1971). A co-founder of Pyramid Films, he jointly used a pseudonym, Elton Hawke, with his business partner Hazel Adair, the co creator of the soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;. He used other pseudonyms to keep this part of his life from gaining public attention, but it was revealed in a 1975 episode of the TV documentary series &quot;Man Alive&quot;.

==Personal life ==
Walton married Lynn Smith, the first wife of Leslie Grade in 1949; the couple had a son. He also had a stepson Michael (now Lord Grade) through his wife&#x27;s first marriage.

<doc id="605046" wikidata="Q4876248" url="?curid=605046" title="Bean Hollow State Beach">
<text>Bean Hollow State Beach is a beach in the state park system of California, United States. It is located in San Mateo County near Pescadero. The beach offers fishing, picnicking and beachcombing. Visitors can explore tide pools with anemones, crab, sea urchins and other marine inhabitants. The beach also has a self-guided nature trail. Swimming is dangerous because of cold water, rip currents, heavy surf and sharks. Bean Hollow is south of Half Moon Bay and south of Pescadero on State Route 1. The property was acquired by the state in 1958. Bean Hollow has become one of the premier locations in California for 1/10 scale radio control 4 wheel drive trucks.

==Name==
Named after Cañada del Frijol which was applied in the 1840s. The English term was in use by 1861.

==History==
The earliest recording of the area was from the Portolá Expedition of 1769 who were retreating back to San Diego along an Ohlone road. &quot;...we made camp close to one of two large streams in the San Pedro Regalado hollow, where there is a good-size lake, a great deal of wood, and grand grass.&quot; - Return Journal of Fray Juan Crespí, Saturday November 18. Once in Ohlone country, the Expedition found the native people to be most gracious, offering food and guidance. The Quiroste’s home territory encompassed roughly 90 square miles and stretched from the sea to ridge-tops in the mountains to the east. They were hunters and gatherers who knew how to manage their land’s resources so that the plants upon which they relied would proliferate. Quiriste Valley contains at least 13 documented and undocumented archaeological sites. Initial research shows they occupied the area at least a thousand years.

<doc id="605055" wikidata="Q703907" url="?curid=605055" title="Tagesschau (German TV programme)">
<text>Tagesschau (, German for &quot;Review of the Day&quot;) is a German national and international television news service produced by the editorial staff of ARD-aktuell on behalf of the German public-service television network ARD.

The main edition of the programme is aired at 20:00 (08:00 pm) on Das Erste. It is also simulcast on several ARD-affiliated networks, including NDR Fernsehen, RBB Fernsehen, SWR Fernsehen, WDR Fernsehen, hr-fernsehen, 3sat, Phoenix, and ARD-alpha. It also broadcasts for most of the day on tagesschau24. Recorded &quot;Tagesschau&quot; newscasts can also be seen via YouTube internationally. In addition, there is a tagesschau.de website managed by ARD that is increasingly operated as a news portal with its own editorial office.

== History ==

&quot;Tagesschau&quot; (literally &quot;Day&#x27;s Show&quot;, or loosely &quot;(Re)view of the Day&quot;; a play on the term &quot;Wochenschau&quot;, the weekly newsreel formerly shown in cinemas) is both the oldest and the most watched news program on German television. The first edition was transmitted on &quot;Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk&quot; (North-Western German Broadcasting) on 26 December 1952. Initially broadcast three times a week, the programme expanded in 1956 to air Monday to Saturday, with Sunday editions beginning in 1961. The nightly 8-pm edition of &quot;Tagesschau&quot; is watched by up to 10 million viewers, equivalent to a 33% audience reach. Currently, the bulletin is produced by NDR (Northern German Broadcasting) through &quot;ARD-aktuell&quot; (the ARD&#x27;s news department) from its studios in Hamburg.

The main 15-minute bulletin is broadcast at 20:00 CET or CEST (08:00 pm CET or CEST) each evening with shorter bulletins broadcast throughout the day. The end of the 20:00 bulletin, at 20:15, marks the beginning of prime time on German television, in which both ARD and ZDF end commercial advertising on Monday through Saturday evenings (the clock with hours, minutes, and seconds is shown in the last ad break, a final in-clock ad is aired before the chime). An attempt by commercial station Sat.1 in the late 1990s to begin their prime time schedule at 20:00 was so unsuccessful that it was discontinued after only a few weeks.

In 1978, the late edition of &quot;Tagesschau&quot; was replaced by &quot;Tagesthemen&quot; (&quot;Subjects of the Day&quot; or &quot;Themes of the Day&quot;), a half-hour programme featuring more in-depth reports, analysis, and commentary. The programme continues to air at 22:15 each evening. A late-night, magazine-style programme, &quot;Nachtmagazin&quot; (&quot;Night Magazine&quot;), airs at around 00:30. A weekly review programme entitled &quot;Wochenspiegel&quot; (&quot;Mirror of the Week&quot;) was produced by the &quot;Tagesschau&quot; production team and aired on Sundays around lunch time. The program aired its last episode on 24 August 2014 in a major reshuffle.

The program&#x27;s trademark continues to be the eight o&#x27;clock chime followed by a recorded announcement, spoken by Claudia Urbschat-Mingues, &quot;&quot;Hier ist das Erste Deutsche Fernsehen mit der &quot;Tagesschau&quot;&quot;&quot; (&quot;This is First German Television with the &quot;Tagesschau&quot;&quot;). The &quot;Tagesschau&quot; theme music has remained the same since 1956, although the arrangement has been modernized several times, most recently in 2014 by Henning Lohner.

On 25 July 1988 the &quot;Tagesschau&quot; was on the brink of being cancelled due to a warning strike organized by the broadcasting union RFFU. This blackout would have been for the first (and only) time in its history, but the &quot;Rundschau&quot; from Bavaria, produced by &quot;Bayerisches Fernsehen&quot; (Bavarian Television) in Munich, helped out as a substitute program.

&quot;Tagesschau&quot; aired its 20,000th broadcast on 31 December 2010.

==Media studies and criticism==

===Plurality of perspectives lacking===
The long-term study of the Otto Brenner Stiftung by Hans-Jürgen Arlt and Wolfgang Storz from March 2010 on &quot;Business Journalism during the crisis - The mass media handling of the financial market policy&quot; analyzed working methods of the news broadcasts from 1999 to fall 2009, especially in news formats like &quot;Tagesschau&quot; and &quot;Tagesthemen&quot;. The study arrives at the conclusion that these formats failed during the crisis, due to the editorial team&#x27;s lack of different perspectives, focusing solely on representatives of the German government, banks, some scientists and their points of view. &quot;This narrowing of perspective leads to severe losses of reality which is to be considered as serious journalistic misconduct&quot;.

=== Bias in covering the Ukraine Crisis 2013/2014 ===
In September 2014, following a critical review from the editorial council (Programmbeirat), ARD-aktuell stated: &quot;Criticism of our news-coverage respecting Ukraine has caused an echo on a hitherto unprecedented scale&quot;.

=== Bias in not covering criminal incidents involving refugees ===
In the case of the 2016 murder of the 19-year-old daughter of a high-ranking EU official by an Afghan refugee, Tagesschau did not report the case in its main edition on 3 December, claiming it was of only &quot;regional significance&quot; and that &quot;the special protection for juveniles&quot; would apply in this case. Public broadcaster ZDF had carried the story. &quot;Tagesschau&quot;″s reasons for not reporting it were subjected to criticism, &quot;Stern&quot; magazine wrote that they had given an &quot;absurd&quot; explanation for their &quot;ignorance&quot;. Two days later, ARD magazine &quot;Tagesthemen&quot; started to report about the case after public pressure. When chancellor Angela Merkel was questioned about the case during the programme, she stated: &quot;If the fact should prove true that an Afghan refugee is responsible, then we should absolutely condemn this, exactly as in the case of any other murderer, and we should clearly name this.&quot; ARD announced their intent to engage a &quot;quality manager&quot; henceforth to deal with the growing public criticism of their decisions.

In the case of the 2017 murder of 15-year-old Mia V. by an Afghan refugee, unlike other German TV news broadcasters, ARD Tagesschau did not report the case at first. Only after public pressure &quot;Tagesschau&quot; featured the incident in its main edition.
