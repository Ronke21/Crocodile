<text>James Peter Giuffre (, ; April 26, 1921 – April 24, 2008) was an American jazz clarinetist, saxophonist, composer, and arranger. He is known for developing forms of jazz which allowed for free interplay between the musicians, anticipating forms of free improvisation.

==Biography==
Jimmy Giuffre was born in Dallas, Texas, United States, the son of Joseph Francis Giuffre (an Italian immigrant from Termini Imerese, Palermo Province, Sicily) and Everet McDaniel Giuffre. Giuffre was a graduate of Dallas Technical High School and North Texas State Teachers College (University of North Texas College of Music). He first became known as an arranger for Woody Herman&#x27;s big band, for which he wrote &quot;Four Brothers&quot; (1947). He would continue to write creative, unusual arrangements throughout his career. He was a central figure in West Coast jazz and cool jazz. He became a member of Howard Rumsey&#x27;s Lighthouse All Stars in 1951 as a full-time All Star, along with Shorty Rogers and Shelly Manne. The Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach, California became the focal point of West Coast jazz in the 1952–53 period. During this time, he collaborated with Rogers on many of the charts written for the All Stars. The first recording released by the Lighthouse All Stars was a not so West Coast jazz chart named &quot;Big Boy&quot;, which he and Rogers had put together. It was an instant hit in Los Angeles. He left the band in September 1953 and became a member of Shorty Rogers and His Giants before going solo. At this point in his career, Giuffre predominantly played tenor and baritone saxophone.

His first trio consisted of Giuffre, guitarist Jim Hall and double bassist Ralph Peña (later replaced by Jim Atlas). They had a minor hit in 1957 when Giuffre&#x27;s &quot;The Train and the River&quot;, was featured on the television special &quot;The Sound of Jazz&quot;. This trio explored what Giuffre dubbed &quot;blues-based folk jazz&quot;. This same special matched Giuffre with fellow clarinetist Pee Wee Russell for a leisurely jam session simply titled &quot;Blues&quot;.

When Atlas left the trio, Giuffre replaced him with valve trombonist Bob Brookmeyer. This unusual instrumentation was partly inspired by Aaron Copland. The group can be seen performing &quot;The Train and the River&quot; in the film &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot; filmed at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival.

In 1959, Giuffre led a trio featuring Hall and bassist Buddy Clark on a concert in Rome, Italy, sharing the bill with Gerry Mulligan&#x27;s band.
In 1961, Giuffre formed a new trio with pianist Paul Bley and Steve Swallow on double bass, and began to focus his attention largely on the clarinet. This group received little attention while active, but were later cited by some critics and musicians as among the most important groups in jazz history. They explored free jazz not in the aggressive mode of Albert Ayler or Archie Shepp, but with a hushed, quiet focus closer to chamber music. The trio&#x27;s explorations of melody, harmony and rhythm are still as striking and radical as any in jazz. Thom Jurek has written that this trio&#x27;s recordings are &quot;one of the most essential documents regarding the other side of early-&#x27;60s jazz.&quot;

Giuffre, Bley and Swallow eventually explored wholly improvised music, several years ahead of the free improvisation boom in Europe. Jurek writes that &quot;Free Fall&quot;, their final record, &quot;was such radical music, no one, literally no one, was ready for it and the group disbanded shortly thereafter on a night when they made only 35 cents apiece for a set.&quot;

In the early 1970s, Giuffre formed a new trio with bassist Kiyoshi Tokunaga and drummer Randy Kaye. Giuffre added instruments including bass flute and soprano saxophone to his arsenal. A later group included Pete Levin playing synthesizer and replaced Tokunaga with electric bassist Bob Nieske. This group recorded three albums for the Italian Soul Note label.

During the 1970s, Giuffre was hired by New York University to head its jazz ensemble, and to teach private lessons in saxophone and music composition. He also taught jazz improvisation at Manhattanville College. 

Into the 1990s, Giuffre continued teaching and performing. He recorded with Joe McPhee, and revived the trio with Bley and Swallow (though Swallow had switched to bass guitar, giving the group a different sound). Through the mid-1990s, Giuffre taught at the New England Conservatory of Music. He suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and in his last years he no longer performed. Giuffre died of pneumonia in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on April 24, 2008, two days short of his 87th birthday.

<doc id="588873" wikidata="Q781636" url="?curid=588873" title="Espadrille">
<text>Espadrilles (Spanish: &quot;alpargatas or esparteñas&quot;; Catalan: &quot;espardenyes&quot;; Basque: &quot;espartinak&quot;, French: &quot;espadrilles&quot;) are casual, rope-soled, flat but sometimes high-heeled shoes. They usually have a canvas or cotton fabric upper and a flexible sole made of esparto rope. The esparto rope sole is the defining characteristic of an espadrille; the uppers vary widely in style.

Espadrilles are a typical form of Spanish summer footwear, with strong historical ties to the regions of Catalonia, Aragon, and the Basque Country. The word derives from the Catalan &quot;espardenya&quot; and refers to esparto grass, a plant indigenous to the south of Spain that is used to make ropes and basketry. Although they are still widely manufactured in Spain, some production has moved to Bangladesh, the world&#x27;s largest jute producer.

Originally peasant footwear, they were popularised throughout the 20th century by many cultural figures including Picasso, Salvador Dalí and later John F. Kennedy and Yves Saint Laurent.

==Etymology==

The existence of this kind of shoe in Europe is documented since at least 1322, when it was described for the first time with its current Catalan name. 
The term &quot;espadrille&quot; is French and derives from the word in the Occitan language, which comes from &quot;espardenya&quot; in Catalan or &quot;alpargata&quot; and &quot;esparteña&quot; in Spanish. Both &quot;espardenya&quot; and &quot;esparteña&quot; refer to a type of shoes made with esparto, a tough, wiry Mediterranean grass used in making rope. Its name in the Basque region is &quot;espartina&quot;.

== History ==

Espadrilles have been made in the Basque Country, Catalonia and roughly all over Spain as well as the Occitania region of France. They were the usual peasant footwear since the 14th century at least, and are still being produced as from old. The oldest, most primitive form of espadrilles dates as far back as 9,500 years ago. Traditional espadrilles have a canvas upper with the toe and vamp cut in one piece and seamed to the rope sole at the sides. Often they have laces at the throat that are wrapped around the ankle to hold the shoes securely in place. Traditional espadrilles are worn by both men and women.

=== Use in Argentina and Uruguay ===
Both in Argentina and Uruguay, espadrilles (known as alpargatas) were adopted by rural workers as a substitute for the &quot;bota de potro&quot;, part of the traditional gaucho attire, made with leather from the lower leg of the horse. Unlike other clothing, the espadrille became an essential garment for both sexes but, above all, the inseparable companion of the &quot;bombachas&quot; (knickerbockers). In the first half of the 20th century, the use of espadrilles was so common among the lower classes of the population that the company called &quot;Fábrica Argentina de Alpargatas&quot; took great importance, which used to be promoted with the artistic almanacs illustrated by Florencio Molina Campos. Espadrilles entered the Argentine political scene prior to the presidency of Juan Domingo Perón by associating it with the working class. In 1943 and 1944, the student movement opposed to Perón began to use the slogan: &quot;No a la dictadura de las alpargatas&quot; (&quot;No to espadrilles&#x27; dictatorship&quot;) which was in turn responded by the peronists: &quot;alpargatas sí, libros, no&quot; (&quot;espadrilles, yes, books, no&quot;).

==Modern espadrilles==
Once peasant footwear, then urban workers&#x27; footwear, espadrilles have grown in popularity, especially in the French Atlantic coast of the Basque Country and Spanish Mediterranean coast from Granada to Girona, where many men and women wear them during the spring and summer months. Designer espadrilles are now widely available. They are usually manufactured in Spain, France, and South Asia. Modern espadrilles are predominantly for women, though some men&#x27;s shoes are made in this style.

The soles of espadrilles may be flat, platform, or wedge shaped made of natural fiber. Uppers may be made from nearly any substance and may have open or closed toes, open or closed backs, and can be slip-on or tied to the ankle with laces. Thousands of varieties of espadrilles can be found, from inexpensive bargain brands to high priced designer brands.

Espadrilles became fashionable in the United States in the 1940s. Lauren Bacall&#x27;s character in the 1948 movie &quot;Key Largo&quot; wore ankle-laced espadrilles.

Wedge-shaped espadrilles were first popularized by French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent. At a trade fair in Paris in 1970, he came into contact with the Spanish espadrille manufacturer Castañer. Yves Saint Laurent had been looking in vain for months for someone to make him a wedge espadrille. Castañer managed to interpret Yves Saint Laurent&#x27;s vision and the wedge espadrilles were an instant hit, influencing fashion even today.

The espadrille style was revived in the United States in the 1980s, due to the success of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;—the shoe was worn by the character Sonny Crockett (played by Don Johnson). In 2013 at luxury shoe stores in New York City, a pair of espadrilles could cost nearly $500.

==Jute sole espadrilles==
Due to cost and material availability, the soles of espadrilles are now commonly made with jute rope or braid. The natural bright white color of jute is a major design feature of modern espadrilles.

Bangladesh is the producer of high quality jute and has become a manufacturing center for premium quality jute soles and complete espadrilles. Ninety percent of the world&#x27;s total production of complete espadrilles, as well as jute soles, is now manufactured in Bangladesh, although some manufacturers in Spain, France, and Italy import jute soles from Bangladesh to finish espadrilles in those countries. Complete espadrilles are also assembled in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Venezuela with imported jute from Bangladesh.

Jute soles typically include fully or partially vulcanized (hardened) rubber beneath the jute soles for long-lasting espadrille shoes. Sometimes crepe rubber soles are used as out-soles, although they are less durable than their vulcanized counterparts. Jute braid soles might include heels made of wood or EVA foam.

==Manufacture==

The manufacture of espadrilles is generally more complex than that of sandals. The jute soles are the most critical part. The jute twines are first machine-braided. These braids are then manually formed into the shape of the sole and hydraulically pressed with heat to form the final shape and completed with vertical stitching with Espadrille Needles. These basic soles are then vulcanized underneath. EVA foam or wooden heels are glued in place and more jute braids are wrapped around it to complete the soles. Uppers of different styles are then built on the jute soles to complete the espadrille.

<text>The distributive-temporal of a noun is a grammatical case specifying when and how often something is done.

==In Hungarian==
This case (-nta/-nte) in Hungarian can express how often something happens (e.g. &quot;havonta&quot; &quot;monthly&quot;, &quot;naponta&quot; &quot;daily&quot;, &quot;telente&quot; &quot;every winter&quot;, &quot;reggelente&quot; &quot;every morning&quot;); it can alternate with the distributive case in words of temporal meaning.

==In Finnish==
This adverb type in Finnish can express that something happens at a frequent point in time (e.g. &quot;on Sundays&quot; is &quot;sunnuntaisin&quot;), or an origin (e.g. &quot;born in&quot; is &quot;syntyisin&quot;). It is restricted to a small number of adverb stems and nouns, mostly those with the plural formed with an &quot;-i-&quot; suffix. The ending is &quot;-sin&quot;.
For example, the root &quot;päivä&quot; (day) has the plural &quot;päivi-&quot;, and thus the temporal distributive &quot;päivisin&quot; (&quot;during the days&quot;).

The temporal distributive case specifies when something is done, in contrast to the distributive case, which specifies how often something is done, as in regular maintenance. These sentences are a good example: &quot;Siivoan päivisin&quot; vs. &quot;Siivoan päivittäin&quot;. The former (temp. dist.) means &quot;I clean by day&quot;, implying the cleaning is done in the daytime, whereas the latter (dist.) means &quot;I clean daily&quot;, implying that there&#x27;s no day without cleaning.

If the plural has another form than &quot;-i-&quot;, either &quot;joka&quot; (each) or the essive case is used. For example, &quot;uusi vuosi&quot; (New Year) is either &quot;joka uusi vuosi&quot; or &quot;uusina vuosina&quot;, respectively.

<text>762 Pulcova is a main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by Grigoriy N. Neujmin in 1913, and is named after Pulkovo Observatory, near Saint Petersburg. Pulcova is 137 km in diameter, and is a C-type asteroid, which means that it is dark in colouring with a carbonate composition.

Photometric observations of this asteroid from Leura, Australia during 2006 gave a light curve with a period of 5.8403 ± 0.0005 hours and a brightness variation of 0.20 ± 0.02 in magnitude. This result is in agreement with previous studies.

== Satellite ==
On February 22, 2000, astronomers at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, discovered a 15-km moon (roughly a tenth the size of the primary) orbiting Pulcova at a distance of 800 km. Its orbital period is 4 days. The satellite is about 4 magnitudes fainter than the primary. It was one of the first asteroid moons to be identified.

== Density ==
In the year 2000, Merline estimated Pulcova to have a density of 1.8 g/cm3, which would make it more dense than the triple asteroid 45 Eugenia, and binary 90 Antiope. But estimates by Marchis in 2008 suggest a density of only 0.90 g/cm3, suggesting it may be a loosely packed rubble pile, not a monolithic object.

<text>In grammar, the sociative case is a grammatical case in the Hungarian, Tamil, and Malayalam languages that can express the person in whose company (cf. Latin ) an action is carried out, or to any belongings of people which take part in an action (together with their owners).

==Hungarian==
In Hungarian, this case is denoted by the suffixes &quot;-stul&quot; and &quot;-stül&quot;, depending on vowel harmony. This case is archaic and nowadays the instrumental-comitative case is usually used instead. Nevertheless, it can be used also in modern Hungarian to express a slight pejorative tone against a person. Here are a few examples:

* &quot;Karácsonykor egy fillér nélkül, kölyköstül állított be az anyósához&quot; &quot;Without a dime, she wound up in her mother-in-law&#x27;s house at Christmas with her kids&quot;

The use of the sociative case &quot;kölyköstül&quot; (&quot;with her kids&quot;) signifies the speaker&#x27;s contempt. The case appears also in some commonly used expressions, which survived the general obsolescence of the sociative case:

* &quot;Ruhástul ugrott a medencébe&quot; &quot;He jumped into the pool with his clothes on&quot;
* &quot;A fenevad szőröstül-bőröstül felfalta a védtelen kis nyuszit&quot; &quot;The monster devoured the helpless little bunny neck and crop&quot;

==Tamil==
In Tamil, the sociative case takes the endings () or (). It is related to the instrumental case but not identical to it. In contrast to the sociative case, the instrumental case usually denotes the means of action and takes the ending ().

<text>In &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, Rerir, the son of Sigi, succeeds his murdered father and avenges his death. He rules in Hunaland and becomes a powerful ruler. Rerir&#x27;s son is Völsung.

Rerir and his wife were unable to have children until the goddess Frigg, the wife of Odin sent them a giantess named Hljod in the shape of a crow to deliver an apple of fertility to the couple. Shortly after, Rerir’s wife becomes pregnant. However Rerir dies from an illness after the conception. His wife remained pregnant for six years, until she realized that she was dying and commanded that the child be delivered by Caesarian section, an operation that in those days cost the life of the mother. When the child called Völsung was delivered, he was already well grown and he “kissed his mother before she died.” 

Mount Rerir is a location in the fictional world of Middle-earth.

<doc id="588886" wikidata="Q217813" url="?curid=588886" title="Chlorate">
<text>Chlorate is the common name of the anion, whose chlorine atom is in the +5 oxidation state. The term can also refer to chemical compounds containing this anion, with chlorates being the salts of chloric acid. Other oxyanions of chlorine can be named &quot;chlorate&quot; followed by a Roman numeral in parentheses denoting the oxidation state of chlorine: e.g., the ion commonly called perchlorate can also be called chlorate(VII).

As predicted by valence shell electron pair repulsion theory, chlorate anions have trigonal pyramidal structures.

Chlorates are powerful oxidizers and should be kept away from organics or easily oxidized materials. Mixtures of chlorate salts with virtually any combustible material (sugar, sawdust, charcoal, organic solvents, metals, etc.) will readily deflagrate. Chlorates were once widely used in pyrotechnics for this reason, though their use has fallen due to their instability. Most pyrotechnic applications that formerly used chlorates now use the more stable perchlorates instead.

==Structure and bonding==
The chlorate ion cannot be satisfactorily represented by just one Lewis structure, since all the Cl–O bonds are the same length (1.49 Å in potassium chlorate), and the chlorine atom is hypervalent. Instead, it is often thought of as a hybrid of multiple resonance structures:

==Preparation==

===Laboratory===
Metal chlorates can be prepared by adding chlorine to hot metal hydroxides like KOH:

In this reaction, chlorine undergoes disproportionation, both reduction and oxidation. Chlorine, oxidation number 0, forms chloride (Cl−; oxidation number −1) and chlorate(V) (; oxidation number +5). The reaction of cold aqueous metal hydroxides with chlorine produces the chloride and hypochlorite (oxidation number +1) instead.

===Industrial===
The industrial-scale synthesis for sodium chlorate starts from an aqueous sodium chloride solution (brine) rather than chlorine gas. If the electrolysis equipment allows for the mixing of the chlorine and the sodium hydroxide, then the disproportionation reaction described above occurs. The heating of the reactants to 50–70 °C is performed by the electrical power used for electrolysis.

==Natural occurrence==
A 2010 study has discovered the presence of natural chlorate deposits around the world, with relatively high concentrations found in arid and hyper-arid regions. The chlorate was also measured in rainfall samples with the amount of chlorate similar to perchlorate. It is suspected that chlorate and perchlorate may share a common natural formation mechanism and could be a part of the chlorine biogeochemistry cycle. From a microbial standpoint, the presence of natural chlorate could also explain why there is a variety of microorganisms capable of reducing chlorate to chloride. Further, the evolution of chlorate reduction may be an ancient phenomenon as all perchlorate reducing bacteria described to date also utilize chlorate as a terminal electron acceptor. It should be clearly stated, that currently no chlorate-dominant minerals are known. This means that the chlorate anion exists only as a substitution in the known mineral species, or – eventually – is present in the pore-filling solutions.

In 2011, a study of the Georgia Institute of Technology unveiled the presence of magnesium chlorate on the planet Mars.

==Compounds (salts)==
Examples of chlorates include
* potassium chlorate, KClO3
* sodium chlorate, NaClO3
* magnesium chlorate, Mg(ClO3)2

==Other oxyanions==
If a Roman numeral in brackets follows the word &quot;chlorate&quot;, this indicates the oxyanion contains chlorine in the indicated oxidation state, namely:

Using this convention, &quot;chlorate&quot; means &quot;any&quot; chlorine oxyanion. Usually, &quot;chlorate&quot; refers only to chlorine in the +5 oxidation state.

==Toxicity==
Chlorates are relatively toxic, though they form generally harmless chlorides on reduction.

<doc id="588889" wikidata="Q493004" url="?curid=588889" title="Buddy DeFranco">
<text>Boniface Ferdinand Leonard &quot;Buddy&quot; DeFranco (February 17, 1923 – December 24, 2014) was an American jazz clarinetist. In addition to his work as a bandleader, DeFranco led the Glenn Miller Orchestra for almost a decade in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Biography==
Born in Camden, New Jersey, United States, DeFranco was raised in South Philadelphia. He was playing the clarinet by the time he was nine years old and within five years had won a national Tommy Dorsey swing contest.

He began his professional career just as swing music and big bands—many of which were led by clarinetists like Artie Shaw, and Benny Goodman—were in decline. While most jazz clarinet players did not adapt to this change, DeFranco successfully continued to play clarinet exclusively, and was one of the few bebop clarinetists.

In 1950, DeFranco spent a year with Count Basie&#x27;s septet. He then led a small combo in the early 1950s which included pianist Sonny Clark and guitarist Tal Farlow. In this period, DeFranco recorded for MGM, Norgran and Verve; the latter two labels were owned by Norman Granz.

During the years 1960-64, DeFranco released four innovative quartet albums, as co-leader with the accordionist Tommy Gumina.

He was bandleader of the Glenn Miller Orchestra from 1966 to 1974, under the name, &quot;The World Famous Glenn Miller Orchestra, Directed By Buddy DeFranco&quot;. He also performed with Gene Krupa, Art Blakey, Tommy Dorsey, Count Basie, Charlie Barnet, Art Tatum, Oscar Peterson, Lennie Tristano, Dodo Marmarosa, Terry Gibbs, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Eddie Daniels, Andy Firth-musician, Don Burrows, Putte Wickman, Billie Holiday and many others, and released dozens of albums as a leader.

DeFranco died in Panama City, Florida, at the age of 91.

==Awards and honors==
DeFranco won twenty awards from &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine, nine awards from &quot;Metronome&quot;, and sixteen &quot;Playboy&quot; All-Stars awards.

<doc id="588894" wikidata="Q939947" url="?curid=588894" title="Jimmy Blanton">
<text>James Blanton (October 5, 1918 – July 30, 1942) was an American jazz double bassist. Blanton is credited with being the originator of more complex pizzicato and arco bass solos in a jazz context than previous bassists. Nicknamed &quot;Jimmie,&quot; Blanton&#x27;s nickname is usually misspelled as &quot;Jimmy,&quot; including by Duke Ellington.

==Early life==
Blanton was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His mother Gertrude was a well known music teacher in Chattanooga, and he spent much of his youth playing in bands led by her. He originally learned to play the violin, but took up the bass while at Tennessee State University, performing with the Tennessee State Collegians from 1936 to 1937, and during the vacations with Fate Marable.

==Later life and career==
Blanton left university in 1938 to play full-time in St Louis with the Jeter-Pillars Orchestra. Blanton joined Duke Ellington&#x27;s band in October 1939 when the Ellington Orchestra came to St. Louis for a residence and the band became enamored with Blanton&#x27;s playing at local late-night jam sessions. Ellington offered Blanton the job the same night he met him. On November 22 of that year, Blanton and Ellington recorded two tracks – &quot;Blues&quot; and &quot;Plucked Again&quot; – which were the first commercially recorded piano–bass duets. Further duet recordings were made in 1940, and Blanton was also featured in orchestra tracks.
In May 1940, the band recorded hits such as &quot;Jack the Bear&quot; and &quot;KoKo&quot; which featured Blanton&#x27;s chops. He was soon the talk of the town everywhere the Ellington Orchestra went. He was extremely dedicated to his craft, always practicing. He formed relationships with bass players of local symphonies when on the road. He developed an especially close friendship with tenor saxophonist Ben Webster, who had also recently joined the Ellington Orchestra.

Ellington put Blanton front-and-center on the bandstand nightly, unheard of for a bassist at the time. Such was his importance to Ellington&#x27;s band at the time, together with tenor saxophonist Webster, that it became known as the Blanton–Webster band. Blanton also played in the &quot;small group&quot; sessions led by Barney Bigard, Rex Stewart, Johnny Hodges, and Cootie Williams in 1940-41.

&quot;Blanton also took part in a few of the informal jam sessions at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse in New York that contributed to the genesis of the bop style.&quot; It has been said that electric guitarist Charlie Christian was also present for some of those sessions, and the two were friends.

During the Summer of 1941, while the Ellington band was performing the landmark musical &quot;Jump for Joy,&quot; Blanton began to show symptoms of tuberculosis. His condition progressively worsened through the fall of 1941, and in November he was forced to leave the band and seek full-time medical care. Blanton died on July 30, 1942, at a sanatorium in Duarte, California, aged 23.

==Playing style and influence==
When with the Jeter-Pillars Orchestra, Blanton added classical music pizzicato and arco techniques to jazz bass, making it into more of a solo instrument. While with Ellington, Blanton revolutionized the way the double bass was used in jazz. His virtuosity placed him in a different class from his predecessors, making him the first master of the jazz bass and demonstrating its potential as a solo instrument. &quot;He possessed great dexterity and range, roundness of tone, accurate intonation, and above all an unprecedented sense of swing.&quot; He added &quot;many non-harmonic passing notes in his accompaniment lines, giving them a contrapuntal flavour and stimulating soloists to their own harmonic explorations.&quot; His originality was developed by others into the foundations of the bebop rhythm section. His importance was such that, &quot;until the advent of the styles of Scott LaFaro and Charlie Haden in the 1960s all modern bass players drew on his innovations.&quot;

<text>James &quot;Kermit&quot; Driscoll (born March 4, 1956) is an American jazz bassist. He is known for his long association with guitarist Bill Frisell in the 1980s and &#x27;90s. Driscoll has worked in many genres and music settings: Broadway, classical, jazz, folk, rock, film, and television. He has taught at SUNY Purchase College and Sarah Lawrence College.

==Biography==
Driscoll was born in Kearney, Nebraska. He began playing piano at age five. Soon after, he added saxophone, and at age thirteen he picked up the bass guitar. He was soon was playing gigs around the midwest. When an offer to travel with a rock band came up, he dropped out of high school at age sixteen to go on tour.

He resumed high school at the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Michigan, then attended the University of Miami, where one of his teachers was Jaco Pastorius. At Berklee College of Music in 1975 he became friends with guitarist Bill Frisell, and they often performed locally in Boston. Driscoll cites Pastorius and Frisell as two of the biggest influences on his life. Around 1976, he and his roommate, drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, and Frisell found work in a band called the Boston Connection. According to Frisell, band members dressed in orange polyester suits and played disco.

In May 1978, Driscoll traveled to Belgium to play with Stephan Houben who was working with Frisell. With this group he made his first recording, &quot;Mauve Traffic&quot;, with Frisell, Houben, Greg Badolato, Vinton Johnson, and Michel Herr. The album included a composition by Driscoll entitled &quot;Doggone it&quot;. In January, 1980, he moved to New York City, and during the next year toured with Buddy Rich. 

From 1986 to 1996, he was a member of Bill Frisell&#x27;s quartet. From 1990 to 1995, he was in the group New and Used with trumpeter Dave Douglas and saxophonist Andy Laster. 

In 2005, he was diagnosed with advanced Lyme disease. Friends performed benefit concerts. Colauita helped gather donations and encouraged Driscoll to record. &quot;Reveille&quot;, his first album as a leader, was recorded with Colaiuta, Frisell, and pianist Kris Davis and released in 2010.

On January, 28th, 2019 Driscoll was accused of beating his wife and charged with aggravated assault, violating a restraining order, false imprisonment, hindering his arrest, obstruction and harassment. This was after being removed from a Cliffside Park, NJ home by the Bergen County Regional SWAT Team.

<text>James Emory Garrison (March 3, 1934 – April 7, 1976) was an American jazz double bassist. He is best remembered for his association with John Coltrane from 1961 to 1967.

==Career==
Garrison was born in Miami, Florida, and moved when he was 10 to Philadelphia, where he learned to play bass during his senior year of high school. Garrison came of age in the 1950s Philadelphia jazz scene, which included fellow bassists Reggie Workman and Henry Grimes, pianist McCoy Tyner and trumpeter Lee Morgan. Garrison was in a short-lived trio started by Bill Evans, with Kenny Dennis on drums, in the 1950s. Between 1957 and 1962, Garrison played and recorded with trumpeter Kenny Dorham; clarinetist Tony Scott; drummer Philly Joe Jones; and saxophonists Bill Barron, Lee Konitz, and Jackie McLean, as well as Curtis Fuller, Benny Golson, Lennie Tristano, and Pharoah Sanders, among others. In 1961, Garrison recorded with Ornette Coleman, appearing on Coleman&#x27;s albums &quot;Ornette on Tenor&quot; and &quot;The Art of the Improvisers&quot;. He also worked with Walter Bishop, Jr. and Cal Massey during the early years of his career.

He formally joined Coltrane&#x27;s quartet in 1962, replacing Workman. The long trio blues &quot;Chasin&#x27; the Trane&quot; is one of his first recorded performances with Coltrane and Elvin Jones. Garrison performed on many Coltrane recordings, including &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;. After John Coltrane&#x27;s death, Garrison worked and recorded with Alice Coltrane, Hampton Hawes, Archie Shepp, Clifford Thornton and groups led by Elvin Jones.

Garrison also worked with Ornette Coleman during the 1960s, first recording with him in 1961 on &quot;Ornette on Tenor&quot;. He and Elvin Jones recorded with Coleman in 1968, and have been credited with eliciting more forceful playing than usual from Coleman on the albums &quot;New York Is Now!&quot; and &quot;Love Call&quot;.

In 1971 and 1972, Garrison taught as a Visiting Artist at Wesleyan University and Bennington College.

==Personal life==
Garrison had four daughters and a son. With his first wife Robbie he had three daughters, Robin, Lori and Italy based jazz vocalist Joy Garrison. With his second wife, dancer and choreographer Roberta Escamilla Garrison, he had Maia Claire, and jazz bassist Matt Garrison.

Jimmy Garrison died of lung cancer on April 7, 1976.

==Music and playing style==

Garrison was known for his inventive and melodic basslines, often using broken time and avoiding straight quarter notes as in a traditional walking bassline, to suggest the time and pulse rather than to outright play it. He was also known for his frequent use of double stops, and for strumming the strings of the bass with his thumb. Garrison would often play unaccompanied improvised solos, sometimes as song introductions prior to the other musicians joining in, and occasionally used a bow. Garrison had a uniquely heavy and powerful gut string tone.

<text>Steve Swallow (born October 4, 1940) is an American jazz bassist and composer, known for his collaborations with Jimmy Giuffre, Gary Burton, and Carla Bley. He was one of the first jazz double bassists to switch entirely to electric bass guitar.

==Biography==

Born in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, United States, Swallow studied piano and trumpet, as a child, before turning to the double bass at the age of 14. While attending a prep school, he began trying his hand in jazz improvisation. In 1960, he left Yale University, where he was studying composition, and settled in New York City, playing at the time in Jimmy Giuffre&#x27;s trio along with Paul Bley. After joining Art Farmer&#x27;s quartet in 1963, Swallow began to write. It is in the 1960s that his long-term association with Gary Burton&#x27;s various bands began.

In the early 1970s, Swallow switched exclusively to electric bass guitar, of which he prefers the five-string variety. He was first introduced to the electric bass while doing a music trade show with Gary Burton and trying a Gibson EB-2. Along with Monk Montgomery and Bob Cranshaw, Swallow was among the first jazz bassists to do so (with much encouragement from Roy Haynes, one of Swallow&#x27;s favorite drummers). He plays with a pick (made of copper by Hotlicks), and his style involves intricate solos in the upper register. He was one of the early adopters of the high C string on a bass guitar.

From 1974 to 1976, Swallow taught at the Berklee College of Music. He contributed several of his compositions to the Berklee students who assembled the first edition of The Real Book. He later recorded an album, &quot;Real Book&quot;, with the picture of a well-worn, coffee-stained book on the cover.

In 1978, Swallow became a member of Carla Bley&#x27;s band. He was Bley&#x27;s romantic partner from the 1980s until her death in 2023. He toured extensively with John Scofield in the early 1980s, and has returned to this collaboration several times over the years.

Swallow has consistently won the electric bass category in &quot;DownBeat&quot; yearly polls, both Critics&#x27; and Readers&#x27;, since the mid-1980s. His compositions have been covered by, among others, Jim Hall (who recorded his very first tune, &quot;Eiderdown&quot;), Bill Evans, Chick Corea, Stan Getz and Gary Burton. Swallow&#x27;s instruments are built by Harvey Citron.

<text>Chipewyan or Dënesųłinë́ (ethnonym:  ), often simply called Dëne, is the language spoken by the Chipewyan people of northwestern Canada. It is categorized as part of the Northern Athabaskan language family. It has nearly 12,000 speakers in Canada, mostly in Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba and the Northwest Territories. It has official status only in the Northwest Territories, alongside eight other aboriginal languages: Cree, Tlicho, Gwich&#x27;in, Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey and South Slavey.

Most Chipewyan people now use Dëne and Dënesųłinë́ to refer to themselves as a people and to their language, respectively. The Saskatchewan communities of Fond-du-Lac, Black Lake, Wollaston Lake and La Loche are among these.

<text>Frank Bridge (26 February 187910 January 1941) was an English composer, violist and conductor.

==Life==

Bridge was born in Brighton, the ninth child of William Henry Bridge (1845–1928), a violin teacher and variety theatre conductor, formerly a master lithographic printer from a family of cordwainers, and his second wife, Elizabeth (née Warbrick; 1849–1899). His father &quot;ruled the household with a rod of iron&quot;, and was insistent that his son spend regular long hours practising the violin; when Frank became sufficiently skilled, he would play with his father&#x27;s pit bands, conducting in his absence, also arranging music and standing in for other instrumentalists. He studied at the Royal College of Music in London from 1899 to 1903 under Charles Villiers Stanford and others. He played in a number of string quartets, including second violin for the Grimson Quartet and viola for the English String Quartet (along with Marjorie Hayward). He also conducted, sometimes deputising for Henry Wood, before devoting himself to composition, receiving the patronage of Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge.

According to Benjamin Britten, Bridge had strong pacifist convictions, and he was deeply disturbed by the First World War, although the extent of his pacifism was questioned in the 2010s. During the war and immediately afterwards, Bridge wrote a number of pastoral and elegiac pieces that appear to search for spiritual consolation; principal among these are the &quot;Lament&quot; for strings, &quot;Summer&quot; for orchestra, &quot;A Prayer&quot; for chorus and orchestra, and a series of pastoral piano works. The &quot;Lament (for Catherine, aged 9 &quot;Lusitania&quot; 1915)&quot;, for string orchestra, was written as a memorial to the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;. The piece was premiered by the New Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra on 15 September at the 1915 BBC Proms as part of a programme of &quot;Popular Italian music&quot;; &quot;Lament&quot; was conducted by the composer, whereas the rest was conducted by Henry Wood.

Bridge privately taught Benjamin Britten, who later championed his teacher&#x27;s music and paid homage to him in the &quot;Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge&quot; (1937), based on a theme from the second of Bridge&#x27;s &quot;Three Idylls for String Quartet&quot; (1906). However, Bridge was not widely active as a teacher of composition, and his teaching style was unconventional—he appears to have focused on aesthetic issues, idiomatic writing, and clarity, rather than exhaustive technical training. Britten spoke very highly of his teaching, saying famously in 1963 that he still felt he had not &quot;yet come up to the technical standards&quot; that Bridge had set him. When Britten left for the United States with Peter Pears in 1939, Bridge handed Britten his Giussani viola and wished him &#x27;bon voyage and bon retour&#x27;; Bridge died in 1941 without ever seeing Britten again.

==Music==

The earliest extant works are a series of substantial chamber works produced during his studies with C.V. Stanford at the Royal College of Music, along with a number of shorter works in various genres. Bridge completed his first major orchestral score, a Symphonic Poem (sometimes referred to as &quot;Mid of the Night&quot;), shortly after completing his studies. Brahms, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Franck, and Fauré are notable influences on this period.

The works completed in the following years suggest a search for a more mature and expressive idiom, culminating in the tumultuous First String Quartet and a series of Phantasies for chamber ensembles. His orchestral idiom developed more gradually, reaching a new maturity in &quot;The Sea&quot; of 1911, which was to become his most popular and successful orchestral work, receiving frequent performances at the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts during his lifetime.

In the period leading up to the First World War Bridge demonstrates an interest in more modernist tendencies, most notably in &quot;Dance Poem&quot; of 1913, which suggests the influence of Stravinsky and Debussy. During the war period, his exploration generally took more moderate formsmost often a pastoralism influenced by impressionismalthough work such as the &quot;Two Poems&quot; for orchestra and several piano pieces display significant developments in his harmonic language, specifically towards a coloristic, non-functional use of harmony, and a preference for harmony derived from symmetrical scales such as whole tone and octatonic. During the same period Bridge completed two of his most successful chamber works, the Second String Quartet and Cello Sonata.

Bridge&#x27;s idiom in the wartime works tends towards moderation, but after the war his language developed significantly, building on the experiments with impressionist harmony found in the wartime piano and orchestral music. Bridge&#x27;s technical ambitions (documented in his correspondence) prompted him to attempt more complex, larger works, with more advanced harmonic elements and motivic working. Several of the resulting works have some expressive connections with the First World War, which appears to have influenced the mood of the Piano Sonata (1921–24, dedicated to his friend Ernest Farrar, killed in 1918) and certainly &quot;Oration&quot; (1929–30).

During the 1920s Bridge pursued his ambitions to write more serious, substantial works. The Piano Sonata was the first major work to showcase his mature, post-tonal language on a substantial scale. This language is developed and used more effectively in the Third String Quartet, which sparked a series of major orchestral and chamber works, several of which rank among Bridge&#x27;s greatest.

A final group of works followed in the 1930s and early 40s, including the Fourth String Quartet, the &quot;Phantasm&quot; for piano and orchestra, &quot;Oration&quot; for cello and orchestra, the &quot;Rebus&quot; Overture, and the first movement of a projected Symphony for strings.

Although he was not an organist, nor personally associated with music of the English Church, his short pieces for organ have been among the most performed of all his output.

Bridge was frustrated that his later works were largely ignored while his earlier &quot;Edwardian&quot; works continued to receive attention.

<text>Uriel , Auriel ( &quot;ʾŪrīʾēl&quot;, &quot;El/God is my Flame&quot;; &quot;Oúriḗl&quot;; &quot;Ouriēl&quot;; ; Geʽez and Amharic: or ) or Oriel ( &quot;ʾÓrīʾēl&quot;, &quot;El/God is my Light&quot;) is the name of one of the archangels who is mentioned in the post-exilic rabbinic tradition and in certain Christian traditions. He is well known in the Russian Orthodox tradition and in folk Catholicism (in both of which he is considered to be one of the seven major archangels) and recognised in the Anglican Church as the fourth archangel. He is also well known in European esoteric medieval literature. Uriel is also known as a master of knowledge and archangel of wisdom.

In apocryphal, kabbalistic, and occult works, Uriel/Auriel has been equated (or confused) with Urial, Nuriel, Uryan, Jeremiel, Vretil, Sariel, Suriel, Puruel, Phanuel, Jacob, Azrael, and Raphael.

In the Secret Book of John, an early Gnostic work, Uriel is placed in control over the demons who help Yaldabaoth create Adam.

Uriel, Auriel or Oriel (male) / Urielle, Eurielle or Orielle (female) is also a name assimilated by the Celtic Brittanic culture, because of Urielle (7th century), sister of the Breton king Judicael, who popularised the name.

==In Judaism and Christianity==

===Name and origins===
The angels mentioned in the canonical books of the Hebrew Bible (aka the Tanakh) are generally without names. Of the Seven Archangels in the angelology of Judaism, only two of them, the archangels Michael and Gabriel, are mentioned by name in the canonised Jewish scripture.

Raphael features prominently in the Book of Tobit which is accepted as canonical by the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Oriental Orthodox Churches; it is part of the apocrypha in the Lutheran Churches and the Anglican Communion.

Where a fourth archangel is added to the named three, to represent the four cardinal points, Uriel is generally the fourth. Uriel is listed as the fourth angel by Christian Gnostics (under the name Phanuel). However, it is debated whether the Book of Enoch refers to the same angel by two different names. Uriel means &quot;God is my flame&quot;, whereas Phanuel means &quot;God has turned&quot;. Uriel is the third angel listed in the &quot;Testament of Solomon&quot;, the fourth being Sabrael.
Uriel appears in the &quot;Second Book of Esdras&quot; found in the Biblical apocrypha (called Esdras IV in the Vulgate):

‘Et respondit ad mē angelus, quī missus est ad mē, cui nōmen Ūriel,’

‘And the angel, who was sent to me, whose name [was] Uriel, answered me,’

in which the prophet Ezra asks God a series of questions, and Uriel is sent by God to instruct him. According to the Revelation of Esdras, the angels that will rule at the end of the world are Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Gabuthelon, Beburos, Zebuleon, Aker, and Arphugitonos. The last five listed only appear in this book and nowhere else in apocryphal or apocalyptic works.

In Christian apocryphal gospels, Uriel plays a role, differing between the sources, in the rescue of Jesus&#x27; cousin John the Baptist from the Massacre of the Innocents ordered by King Herod. He carries John and his mother Saint Elizabeth to join the Holy Family after their Flight into Egypt. Their reunion is depicted in Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot;.

Uriel is often identified as a cherub and the angel of repentance. He &quot;stands at the Gate of Eden with a fiery sword&quot;, or as the angel &quot;who is over the world and over Tartarus. In the &quot;Apocalypse of Peter,&quot; he appears as the angel of repentance, who is graphically represented as being as pitiless as any demon. In the &quot;Life of Adam and Eve&quot;, Uriel is regarded as the spirit (i.e., one of the cherubs) of the third chapter of Genesis. He is also identified as one of the angels who helped bury Adam and Abel in Eden.

He checked the doors of Egypt for lamb&#x27;s blood during the plague. He also holds the key to the pit during the end times, and led Abraham to the west.

In modern angelology, Uriel is identified variously as a seraph, cherub, regent of the sun, flame of God, angel of the divine presence, presider over Tartarus (hell), archangel of salvation, and, in later scriptures, identified with Phanuel (&quot;God has turned&quot;). He is often depicted carrying a book or a papyrus scroll representing wisdom. Uriel is a patron of the arts.

In the Eastern Orthodox churches, Uriel is commemorated together with the other archangels and angels with a feast day of the &quot;Synaxis of the Archangel Michael and the Other Bodiless Powers&quot; on November 8 of the liturgical calendar (for those churches which follow the Julian calendar, 8 November falls on 21 November of the modern Gregorian calendar), and is regarded as the patron saint of the arts and sciences. In addition, every Monday throughout the year is dedicated to the angels. The Anglicans and Coptic Christians of Ethiopia and Eritrea venerate archangel Uriel. According to the latter, 11 July is his feast day. In the Ethiopian &quot;Homily on the Archangel Uriel&quot;, he is depicted as one of the great archangels, and as the who has interpreted prophecies to Enoch and Ezra, and the helper of both of them. According to the Homily, at the time of the crucifixion of Jesus, Uriel dipped his wing in the blood and water flowing from Christ&#x27;s flank and filled a cup with it. Carrying the cup, he and the Archangel Michael rushed into the world and sprinkled it all over Ethiopia, in every place where a drop of blood fell a church was built. Thus Uriel is often depicted carrying a chalice filled with the blood of Christ in Ethiopian Orthodox iconography. Uriel is honoured in the Lutheran Churches as well, with churches including statuary of the archangels Gabriel, Uriel, Michael and Raphael. 

In Thomas Heywood&#x27;s &quot;Hierarchy of Blessed Angels&quot; (1635), Uriel is described as an angel of the earth. Heywood&#x27;s list is actually of the angels of the four winds: Uriel (south), Michael (east), Raphael (west) (serving also a governor of the south, with Uriel), and Gabriel (north). He is also listed as an angel of the four winds in the medieval Jewish &quot;Book of the Angel Raziel&quot; which lists him as Usiel (Uzziel); according to it, this book was inscribed on a sapphire stone and handed down from Seraph to Metatron and then to Adam.

At the Council of Rome of 745, Pope Zachary, intending to clarify the church&#x27;s teaching on the subject of angels and curb a tendency toward angel worship, condemned obsession with angelic intervention and angelolatry, but reaffirmed the approval of the practice of the reverence of angels. This synod struck many angels&#x27; names from the list of those eligible for veneration in the church of Rome, including Uriel. Only the reverence of the archangels mentioned in the recognised Catholic canon of scriptures, namely Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael, remained licit. In the 16th century, archangel Uriel appeared before the Sicilian friar Antonio Lo Duca and told him to build a church in the Termini area. Lo Duca told Pope Pius IV about the apparition, the pope then asked Michelangelo to design the church, which became the Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels and of the Martyrs located at the Esedra Plaza.

In the first half of the 11th century, Bulgarian followers of the dualist heresy called Bogomilism, who lived in the dukedom of Ahtum in present-day Banat, invoked Uriel in rituals. This was witnessed by Gerard of Csanád, the Catholic bishop of the area after 1028. Uriel was also named in a small exorcism in the 15th century, reported by Robert Ambelain in &quot;Arabic Astrology&quot; on page 18, without indication of date and place of origin: &quot;&quot;.

In Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, Uriel is one of the angels of the seven planets, namely of Mars. He is also listed as such in Benjamin Camfield&#x27;s &quot;A Theological Discourse of Angels&quot; (1678).

A scriptural reference to an angel of presence is found in Isaiah 63:9:
In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.

===In Enoch===

The Book of Enoch, which presents itself as written by Enoch, mentions Uriel in many of its component books. In chapter IX, which is part of &quot;The Book of the Watchers&quot; (2nd century BCE), only four angels are mentioned by name. Those angels are Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel (though some versions have a fifth angel: Suryal or Suriel). However, the later chapter XX lists the names and functions of seven angels. Those angels are &quot;Uriel, one of the holy angels, who is over the world and over Tartarus&quot;, Raphael, Raguel, Michael, Saraqâêl, Gabriel, and Remiel.

The Book of the Watchers as a whole tells us that Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel were present before God to testify on behalf of humankind. They asked for divine intervention during the reign of the fallen grigori (fallen watchers). These fallen ones took human wives and produced half-angel, half-human offspring called the nephilim. Uriel is responsible for warning Noah about the upcoming great flood.

Then said the Most High, the Holy and Great One spoke, and sent Uriel to the son of Lamech, and said to him: &quot;&lt;Go to Noah&gt; and tell him in my name &#x27;Hide thyself!&#x27; and reveal to him the end that is approaching: that the whole earth will be destroyed, and a deluge is about to come upon the whole earth, and will destroy all that is on it.&quot;

After judgment has been brought upon the nephilim and the fallen ones (&quot;see&quot; The Book of Giants), including the two main leaders Samyaza and Azazel, Uriel discusses their fates:

And Uriel said to me: &quot;Here shall stand the angels who have connected themselves with women, and their spirits assuming many different forms are defiling mankind and shall lead them astray into sacrificing to demons &#x27;as gods&#x27;, (here shall they stand,) till &#x27;the day of&#x27; the great judgment in which they shall be judged till they are made an end of. And the women also of the angels who went astray shall become sirens.&#x27; And I, Enoch alone, saw the vision, the ends of all things; and no man shall see as I have seen.&quot;

Uriel then acts as a guide for Enoch for the rest of the Book of Watchers. He fulfills this capacity in many of the other books that make up Enoch.

===In Anglican tradition===

In the traditions and hagiography of the Episcopal and other Anglican churches, Uriel is mentioned as an archangel. He is recognised as the patron saint of the sacrament of confirmation. In some Episcopal churches, Uriel is also regarded as the keeper of beauty and light, and regent of the sun and constellations; in iconography he is shown holding in his right hand a Greek Ionic column which symbolises perfection in aesthetics and man-made beauty, in his left hand a staff topped with the sun. He is celebrated in the Anglican liturgical calendars on the Feast of the Archangels. The Church of St. Uriel the Archangel at Sea Girt, New Jersey is a testimony to Anglicans&#x27; devotion to Uriel.

The Anglican intercessional prayer to Saint Uriel the Archangel is as follows;

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;O holy Saint Uriel, intercede for us that our hearts may burn with the fire of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
Assist us in co-operating with the graces of our confirmation that the gifts of the
Holy Spirit may bear lots o&#x27; fruit in our souls.
Obtain for us the grace to use the sword of truth to pare away all that is not in conformity to the most adorable
Will of God in our lives, that we may fully participate in the army of the Church Militant.
Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;

The longstanding motto of the University of Oxford, (&quot;The Lord is my light&quot;) is a translation into Latin of Uriel&#x27;s name.

== In esotericism and occultism ==
In Hermetic Qabalah, Uriel&#x27;s name is commonly spelled Auriel. He is regarded as the archangel of the North, and of the element of Earth.

According to the teaching of the modern Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Uriel is the archangel of North and of Earth, and is thus associated with the vegetation of the Earth. In iconography, he is depicted holding stems of ripened wheat and wearing robes of citrine, russet, olive, and black.

<text>Sariel (Hebrew and Aramaic: שָׂרִיאֵל &quot;Śārīʾēl&quot;, &quot;God is my Ruler&quot;; Greek: Σαριηλ &quot;Sariēl&quot;, &quot;Souriēl&quot;; Amharic: ሰራቁያል &quot;Säraquyael&quot;, ሰረቃኤል &quot;Säräqael&quot;) is an angel mainly from Judaic tradition. Other possible versions of his name are Suriel, Suriyel (in some Dead Sea Scrolls translations), Seriel, Sauriel, Saraqael, Sarakiel, Suruel, Surufel, and Souriel.

In 1 Enoch (20:6), he is said to be &quot;one of the [seven] holy angels [who watch], who is set over the spirits, who sin in the spirit&quot;. Origen identified Suriel as one of seven angels who are considered primordial powers by the Ophites. In Gnosticism, Sariel is invoked for his protective powers. He is commemorated by the Coptic Orthodox Church on 27 Tobi in the Coptic calendar.

He is not to be confused with the fallen watcher Sahariel (Hebrew &amp; Aramaic: שַׂהֲרִיאֵל &quot;Śahărīʾēl&quot;; &quot;God is my moon&quot;) who bears a similar name. In 1 Enoch (8:1) he is said to have taught humans the course of the moon.

== In traditional texts ==
The fallen watcher Sariel, according to the Book of Enoch, was one of the leaders of angels who lusted after the daughters of men. They descended to the summit of Mount Hermon, in the days of Jared, to acquire wives and lead men astray. Sariel specifically taught men about the course of the moon. Knibbs&#x27; translation of the names of the Book of Enoch says it was Sariel who taught humans the &quot;course of the moon&quot; (the Lunar calendar).

In this same book, the archangel Sariel is one of the holy angels, who is set over the spirits that sin in the spirit, and is one of the angels who look upon the bloodshed on Earth, along with Gabriel, Michael, Raphael and Uriel.

In the book of 2 Enoch he is listed, with the name of Samuil or Sariel, as one of the angels that brought Enoch to heaven.

The book of War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness, from the Dead Sea Scrolls, lists the name of &quot;Sariel&quot; (שריאל, &quot;God is my Ruler&quot;) along with Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel as names to write upon the shields of soldiers in a tower during maneuvers (1QM 9,15). It is used on the shields of the third &quot;Tower&quot; (1QM 9,16).

The angel &quot;Suriyel&quot; is briefly mentioned in the Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan as bearing Adam and Eve from the top of a high mountain to the Cave of Treasures.

:&quot;… bring what he had brought, and give it to Adam. And they did so, one by one. 6 And God commanded Suriyel and Salathiel to bear up Adam and Eve, and bring them down from the top of the high mountain, and …&quot; - Bible. O. T. Apocryphal books. English First Book of Adam and Eve.

In the Ladder of Jacob &quot;Sariel&quot; is dispatched by the Lord to Jacob to explain to him the meaning of the dream about the ladder.

The book of Liber Juratus by Honorius of Thebes has a number of translations which lists &quot;Sariell&quot; as one of &quot;The names of the angels of the eighth month, which is called marquesnan heshvan&quot;, and &quot;Sariel&quot; as one of &quot;The names of the angels of the tenth month, which is called Tevet&quot;. The month of Heshvan marquesnan would make Sariel&#x27;s ruler Barfiell, or the month of Tevet would make the ruler Anael.
The Lesser Key of Solomon lists the dukes Asteliel and Gediel as commanding Sariel by night. The book &quot;A Dictionary of Angels&quot; by Gustav Davidson and &quot;The Complete Book of Devils and Demons&quot; by Leonard Ashley list Sariel as a fallen angel. The Greek Magical Papyri represents him as a deity to be called upon in rites using the &quot;Souriel&quot; variation of his name.

The University of Michigan has a section in its library collection devoted to Traditions of Magic in Late Antiquity, Protective Magic, Babylonian Demon Bowls. One clay bowl from Seleucia-on-Tigris dated to the 6th or 7th century A.D. lists Sariel twice:

:&quot;I wrote all of the curses upon a new bowl of clay and I sent back the curses of those who cursed Negray daughter of Denday to their masters until they release and bless in the name of Sariel the angel and Barakiel the angel and in the name of Sariel and Barakiel you release from the curses of those who curse Negray daughter of Denday as a man is freed from the house of bondage and from the house of weapons amen amen selah.&quot;

== In media ==

=== Video games ===
In the bullet hell series &quot;Touhou Project&quot;, the first game, &quot;Highly Responsive to Prayers&quot;, portrays Sariel as the final boss of the &quot;&quot; () route.

<text>Edward James Delahanty (October 30, 1867 – July 2, 1903), nicknamed &quot;Big Ed&quot;, was an American professional baseball player, who spent his Major League Baseball (MLB) playing career with the Philadelphia Quakers, Cleveland Infants, Philadelphia Phillies, and Washington Senators. He was renowned as one of the game&#x27;s early power hitters, and while primarily a left fielder, also spent time as an infielder. Delahanty won two batting titles, batted over .400 three times, and has the seventh-highest career batting average in MLB history. In 1945, Delahanty was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Delahanty died as a result of falling into the Niagara River or being swept over Niagara Falls (undetermined), after being removed from a train for being drunk and disorderly.

Delahanty&#x27;s biographer argues that:
:Baseball for Irish kids was a shortcut to the American dream and to self-indulgent glory and fortune. By the mid-1880s these young Irish men dominated the sport and popularized a style of play that was termed heady, daring, and spontaneous... [Delahanty] personified the flamboyant, exciting spectator-favorite, the Casey-at-the-bat, Irish slugger. The handsome masculine athlete who is expected to live as large as he played.

Delahanty&#x27;s younger brothers, Frank, Jim, Joe, and Tom, also played in the major leagues . Their youngest brother Bill played in the minor leagues.

==Early life==
A Cleveland, Ohio, native, Delahanty was an outfielder and powerful right-handed batter in the 1890s. Crazy Schmit, who pitched for the Giants and Orioles, said of him, &quot;When you pitch to [Ed] Delahanty, you just want to shut your eyes, say a prayer and chuck the ball. The Lord only knows what&#x27;ll happen after that.&quot; (quoted in &quot;Autumn Glory&quot; by Louis P. Masur)

Delahanty attended Cleveland&#x27;s Central High School and went on to college at St. Joseph&#x27;s. His baseball career started with the semipro Cleveland Shamrocks. He then signed on to play professional baseball with Mansfield of the Ohio State League in 1887. Later in the 1887 season, Delahanty played minor league ball in Wheeling, West Virginia. Before the 1888 season, the Wheeling team sold Delahanty to the Philadelphia Phillies for $1,900. He became the most prominent member of the largest group of siblings ever to play in the major leagues: brothers Frank, Jim, Joe and Tom also spent time in the majors.
==Major league career==

===Early career===
The Phillies obtained Delahanty as a replacement for Charlie Ferguson. Ferguson was a pitcher who had converted to second base for his final season, but he died early in 1888 from typhoid fever. Delahanty was brought in to fill in for him at second base. He began his career on May 22, 1888, with the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League (NL), playing 74 games that season with a .228 average, 1 HR, and 31 RBI. The next year, in 56 games, he raised his average to .293.
In 1890, he jumped to the Players&#x27; League (PL), but returned to the Phillies the next year when that league folded. Upon rejoining the Phillies, he became the team&#x27;s starting left fielder. However, his off-the-field activities and excess consumption of alcohol limited his performance. He hit .306 and tallied 6 HR and 91 RBI in 1892. During one game that season, St. Louis infielder George Pinkney charged toward home plate, expecting Delahanty to bunt; Delahanty swung and hit a ball that &quot;appeared to have been shot from a cannon&quot;, breaking Pinkney&#x27;s ankle.

That same year, Delahanty was the victim behind one of &quot;The Most Shameful Home Runs of All Time&quot;, according to authors Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo. When Delahanty&#x27;s Phillies hosted the Chicago White Stockings at Philadelphia&#x27;s Huntingdon Street Grounds in July, Cap Anson hit a fly ball to center field. The ball hit a pole and landed right in the &quot;doghouse&quot;, a little-known feature of the park that was used to store numbers for the manually run scoreboard. Delahanty tried reaching over the &quot;doghouse&quot; and then tried crawling down into it. He got stuck, and by the time teammate Sam Thompson had freed Delahanty from the area, Anson had crossed home plate.

===Middle career===
Delahanty blossomed in 1893 with a .368 average, 19 home runs, and 146 RBI. He narrowly missed the Triple Crown, as teammates Billy Hamilton and Sam Thompson led the league in batting with .380 and .370 averages respectively. While with the Phillies, Delahanty played under manager Harry Wright, the man who assembled, managed, and played center field for baseball&#x27;s first fully professional team, the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings. Wright managed the Phillies with Delahanty for four seasons, from 1890 to 1893, with the two and their fine supporting cast leading the Phils to &quot;first division&quot; finishes during those years, though the team never won a pennant. Between 1894 and 1896 Delahanty compiled astonishing batting marks: .407, 4 HR, 131 RBI; .404, 11 HR, 106 RBI; .397, 13 HR, 126 RBI.

In 1894, despite his high average of .407, the batting title went to Hugh Duffy with a major league record-setting .440. The 1894 Phillies outfield had a big season, with four players averaging over .400: Delahanty (.407), Sam Thompson (.407), Billy Hamilton (.404), and spare outfielder Tuck Turner (.416). Delahanty won his first batting title in 1899 with a .410 batting average, with nine homers and 137 RBI, thus becoming the first player in major league history to hit .400 three times. Delahanty was surrounded by talent in the Philadelphia outfield. Author Bill James wrote, &quot;Any way you cut it, the Phillies had the greatest outfield of the 19th century.&quot;

On July 13, 1896, Delahanty became the second player to hit four home runs in a game. He was the first player to do so in a losing effort. (The Phillies lost the game, 9–8.) Two of them were hit into the bleachers while the other two were inside-the-park. In 1899, Delahanty hit four doubles in the same game. He remains the only man with a four-homer game and a four-double game. The same year Delahanty collected hits in 10 consecutive at bats. He tallied six-hit games in 1890 and 1894.

===Later career===
After switching to the new American League (AL) in 1902, Delahanty played for the Washington Senators, hitting at a .376 mark. After the 1902 season, Delahanty commented to a reporter, &quot;I know I am getting along in years and won&#x27;t be able to last much longer in first-class baseball, therefore I am going to get all the money there is in sight... Last year I was playing with the Phillies for $3,000, this season the Washington Club gives me $4,000, and if I can get $5,000 no one can blame me for taking it.&quot;

Delahanty returned to the Senators for the 1903 season. He was hitting .333 with one home run and 21 RBI in 42 games that year until the incident at Niagara Falls.
==Death==
Delahanty died when he either fell into the Niagara River or was swept over Niagara Falls in early July 1903. He was apparently kicked off a train by the train&#x27;s conductor for being drunk and disorderly. The conductor said Delahanty was brandishing a straight razor and threatening passengers after he consumed five whiskies. After being kicked off the train, Delahanty started his way across the International Railway Bridge connecting Buffalo, New York with Fort Erie (near Niagara Falls) and fell or jumped off the bridge (some accounts say Delahanty was yelling about death that night). Whether Delahanty died from his plunge over the Falls or drowned on the way to the Falls is uncertain. His body was found at the bottom of Niagara Falls a week after his death.

A study of the incident appeared with the publication of &quot;July 2, 1903: The Mysterious Death of Big Ed Delahanty&quot;, by Mike Sowell (New York, Toronto, MacMillan Publishing Co., 1992). Sowell presents the evidence of a drunken accident, suicide, and even possibly a robbery-murder (there were reports of a mysterious man following Delahanty).

==Legacy==

In his 16 seasons with Philadelphia, Cleveland and Washington, Delahanty batted .346, with 101 HR and 1,464 RBIs, 522 doubles, 185 triples and 455 stolen bases. He also led the league in slugging percentage and runs batted in three times each, and batted over .400 three times (1894-1895, 1899). Rogers Hornsby is the only other three-time .400-hitter in National League history (1922, 1924–25). Delahanty&#x27;s lifetime batting average of .346 ranks fifth all-time behind Ty Cobb (.366), Rogers Hornsby (.358), Joe Jackson (.356), and Lefty O&#x27;Doul (.349).

Towards the end of his life, John McGraw was asked how the players of the 1920s and 1930s compared to the players of his era. &quot;Ed Delahanty was as great a hitter as I have ever seen,&quot; was his reply.

In 2008, he was memorialized by the band The Baseball Project on their album, &quot;Volume 1: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails&quot;. The song, &quot;The Death of Big Ed Delahanty&quot;, is a driving, punk-influenced ballad. During Delahanty&#x27;s career, reporters referred to him as &quot;Big Ed&quot;. Friends and teammates usually called him &quot;Del&quot;. The Hamburg Marines, a German Baseball Club, named their ballpark in the Hamburg quarter Billwerder after Ed Delahanty.

<text>Testerep (or Ter Streep) once comprised an island along the Belgian coast. It existed as early as the 5th century. From the 10th century Fishing villages were scattered about, including Ostend and Westende, with Ostend on the far east (Oost-ende: east-end), Westende on the far west (West-ende: west-end), and Middelkerke (literally &quot;middle-church&quot;) the middle of the island.

== History ==
=== Creation ===
Testerep arose around the 5th and 6th century in front of the Belgian North Sea coast between Nieuwpoort and Bredene, as a result of tidal forces. The headland, commonly called &quot;Ter Streep&quot;, was separated from the mainland by the Testerepvliet, a southernly situated tidal channel that was completely inundated at high tide. Because Testerep in subsequent centuries regularly flooded, permanent residence on the island was impossible. Only after a protective dune belt had formed in the 10th century modest settlements of mainly fishermen and sheep herders arose on the island. First Ostend was created in the 990s on the east end of Testerep, then followed by Westende on the west end and Middelkerke in the middle.

=== Partial annexation by the sea ===
In 1267 the Countess of Flanders, Margaretha of Constantinople, granted the Ostend settlement city rights. During the further development and expansion of the city, the surrounding dune belt in the east of Testerep was systematically flattened. Due to the disappearance of this natural protection, storm surges were given free rein over the island. For example, the St. Clemens Flood (1334) flooded and ruined the vulnerable island. The enormous flood during the St Vincentius Flood (1394) was the death blow for the still young, vulnerable city. Thousands of townspeople were forced to leave the original city and founded a second Ostend five hundred meters inland, no longer on the former island of Testerep but on land in the Bredene district.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the devastating tidal waves of a new series of storm surges would eventually sink the northern half of Testerep into the North Sea. After poldering of the Testerep gully, the southern part would form part of the mainland from the twelfth century, the widest part of which formed Westende and Lombardsijde.

=== Present === 
During the reclamation of the newly silted channel lands, the Testerepvliet was canalized into the &quot;Groot Geleed&quot;, a still existing drainage ditch north of the Moere-Blote- en Moere-Nieuwlandpolder. The IJzer river (current harbor channel near Nieuwpoort) still has on its eastern bank some mudflats and marshes as small remains of the old creek. Together with the nature reserve &quot;IJzermonding&quot;, the &quot;Sint-Laureins beach&quot; with the dunes behind it and the former naval base in Lombardsijde, this area used to form the Ijzer estuary.

<doc id="588941" wikidata="Q2620359" url="?curid=588941" title="Russia and weapons of mass destruction">
<text>The Russian Federation is known to possess or have possessed three types of weapons of mass destruction: nuclear weapons, biological weapons, and chemical weapons. It is one of the five nuclear-weapon states recognized under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and one of the four countries wielding a nuclear triad.

Russia possesses a total of 5,580 nuclear warheads as of 2024, the largest confirmed stockpile of nuclear warheads in the world. Russia&#x27;s deployed missiles (those actually ready to be launched) number about 1,710, also the largest confirmed strategically deployed arsenal in the world as of 2024. The remaining weapons are either in reserve stockpiles, or have been retired and are slated for dismantling. Russia&#x27;s predecessor state, the Soviet Union, reached a peak stockpile of about 45,000 nuclear warheads in 1986. The number of weapons Russia may possess is currently controlled by the bilateral New START treaty with the United States. Russia and the United States are the world&#x27;s biggest nuclear powers, holding about 88% of the world&#x27;s nuclear weapons.

The Soviet Union ratified the Geneva Protocol—prohibiting the use of biological and chemical weapons in interstate conflicts—on April 5, 1928, with reservations that were later dropped on January 18, 2001. Russia is also party to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. The Soviet biological weapons program violated the Biological Weapons Convention and was the world&#x27;s largest, longest, and most sophisticated program of its kind. At its peak, the program employed up to 65,000 people.

Despite being a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, Russia has continued to hold, and occasionally use, chemical weapons. In 1997, Russia declared an arsenal of 39,967 tons of chemical weapons, which it worked in part to decrease. Its stock of weapons was officially declared destroyed in 2017. The poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in 2018 and the poisoning of Alexei Navalny in 2020, both carried out by Russia, revealed that the country maintained an illicit chemical weapons program. Russian forces also used, and admitted to using, chemical weapons during the invasion of Ukraine.

===History===

====Soviet era====
====Post-Soviet era====
Post-Soviet countries have signed a series of treaties and agreements to settle the legacy of the former Soviet Union multilaterally and bilaterally.

At the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Soviet nuclear weapons were deployed in four of the new republics: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. In May 1992, these four states signed the Lisbon Protocol, agreeing to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, with Russia the continuator state to the Soviet Union as a nuclear state, and the other three states joining as non-nuclear states.

Ukraine agreed to give up its weapons to Russia, in exchange for guarantees of Ukrainian territory from Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, known as the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. China and France also made statements in support of the memorandum.

=== Arms reduction ===
The threat of nuclear warfare was a persistent and terrifying threat during the Cold War. At its height, the Soviet Union and United States each mustered tens of thousands of warheads, under the doctrine of mutual assured destruction. By the 1980s, both the United States and Soviet Union sought to reduce the number of weapons the other was fielding. This led to the opening of arms reduction talks in 1982.

This culminated in the signing of the START I treaty in 1991: the first nuclear arms reduction treaty between the two global powers. This first treaty limited the number of deployed warheads in each nation to 6,000, nearly halving the prior 10,000 to 12,000 being fielded in 1991. The considerable success of START I, combined with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, led to the START II treaty. Russia never ratified the treaty, and it did not go into effect. An attempted START III was attempted but could not get past negotiations.

Instead, the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty was passed in 2002, capping warheads at 2,200. The current limitations stem from the New START treaty, ratified in 2010. It limits each side to 1,550 weapons. Nuclear bombers only count as one weapon each, even though they may carry up to 20, so the actual limit on the countries is slightly higher. The treaty is in force through to 2026.

After U.S. President George W. Bush withdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, Russia responded by building-up their nuclear capabilities, in such a way as to counterbalance U.S. capabilities. Russia decided not to sign the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was adopted on July 7, 2017, by 122 States. Most analysts agree that Russia&#x27;s nuclear strategy under Putin eventually brought it into violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (although this is not confirmed).

According to Russian officials, the American decision to deploy the missile defense system in Europe was a violation of the treaty. U.S. President Donald Trump announced on October 20, 2018, that the U.S. would no longer consider itself bound by the treaty&#x27;s provisions, raising nuclear tensions between the two powers.

On November 2, 2023, Putin signed a law that withdraws Russia&#x27;s ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.

===Nuclear arsenal of Russia===
The exact number of nuclear warheads is a state secret and is therefore a matter of guesswork. , the Federation of American Scientists estimates that Russia possesses 5,580 nuclear weapons, while the United States has 5,428; Russia and the U.S. each have about 1,600 active deployed strategic nuclear warheads. Russia&#x27;s stockpile is growing in size, while the United States&#x27; is shrinking. Russia has six nuclear missile fields in Kozelsk, Tatishchevo, Uzhur, Dombarovsky, Kartalay, and Aleysk; nuclear missile submarines patrolling from three naval bases at Nerpich&#x27;ya, Yagel&#x27;Naya, and Rybachiy; and nuclear bombers at Ukrainka and Engels air bases. As of 2024, Russia operates 12 nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarines, comprising five Delta-class and seven Borei-class vessels.

The RS-28 Sarmat (Russian: РС-28 Сармат; NATO reporting name: SATAN 2), is a Russian liquid-fueled, MIRV-equipped, super-heavy thermonuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile in development by the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau since 2009, intended to replace the previous R-36 missile. Its large payload would allow for up to 10 heavy warheads or 15 lighter ones, or a combination of warheads and massive amounts of countermeasures designed to defeat anti-missile systems. It was heralded by the Russian military as a response to the U.S. Prompt Global Strike.

In 2015, information emerged that Russia may be developing a new nuclear torpedo, the Status-6 Ocean Multipurpose System, codenamed &quot;Kanyon&quot; by Pentagon officials. This weapon is designed to create a tsunami wave up to 500m tall that will radioactively contaminate a wide area on an enemy coasts with cobalt-60, and to be immune to anti-missile defense systems such as laser weapons and railguns that might disable an ICBM. Two potential carrier submarines, the Project 09852 &quot;Belgorod&quot;, and the Project 09851 &quot;Khabarovsk&quot;, are new boats laid down in 2012 and 2014 respectively.

Status 6 appears to be a deterrent weapon of last resort. It appears to be a torpedo-shaped robotic mini-submarine, that can travel at speeds of . More recent information suggests a top speed of , with a range of and a depth maximum of . This underwater drone is cloaked by stealth technology to elude acoustic tracking devices.

During an annual state-of-the-nation address given on March 1, 2018, President Vladimir Putin publicly claimed that Russia was now in possession of several new classes of nuclear weapons, including some with capabilities previously speculated to exist. Putin discussed several new or upgraded weapons, including a hypersonic glide vehicle known as the Avangard, capable of performing sharp maneuvers while traveling at 20 times the speed of sound making it &quot;absolutely invulnerable for any missile defense system.&quot;

Putin discussed the existence of a nuclear powered underwater torpedo and a nuclear powered cruise missile (9M730 Burevestnik), both with effectively unlimited range. He discussed that Russia had tested a new class of traditional ICBM called the RS-28 Sarmat, which expanded upon the range and carrying capability of the Soviet-era Satan ICBM. Animations of these weapons were shown in front of the live and televised audience. Putin suggested that an online poll be conducted to give them official public names.

===Nuclear weapons in Russian military doctrine===

According to a Russian military doctrine stated in 2010, nuclear weapons could be used by Russia &quot;in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies, and also in case of aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened&quot;. Most military analysts believe that, in this case, Russia would pursue an &#x27;escalate to de-escalate&#x27; strategy, initiating limited nuclear exchange to bring adversaries to the negotiating table. Russia will also threaten nuclear conflict to discourage initial escalation of any major conventional conflict.

Leaked documents seen by the Financial Times in 2024 described a threshold for the country&#x27;s use of tactical nuclear weapons that is lower than Russia had previously disclosed. The document included training scenarios for a possible invasion by China. Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre in Berlin told the FT: &quot;This is the first time that we have seen documents like this reported in the public domain […] They show that the operational threshold for using nuclear weapons is pretty low if the desired result can’t be achieved through conventional means.&quot; In 2024, Russian officials said that Russia&#x27;s formal doctrine would be modified to lower the threshold for nuclear use.

===Nuclear proliferation===
After the Korean War, the Soviet Union transferred nuclear technology and weapons to the People&#x27;s Republic of China as an adversary of the United States and NATO. According to Ion Mihai Pacepa, &quot;Khrushchev&#x27;s nuclear-proliferation process started with Communist China in April 1955, when the new ruler in the Kremlin consented to supply Beijing a sample atomic bomb and to help with its mass production. Subsequently, the Soviet Union built all the essentials of China&#x27;s new military nuclear industry.&quot;

Russia is one of the five &quot;Nuclear Weapons States&quot; (NWS) under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which Russia ratified (as the Soviet Union) in 1968.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, a number of Soviet-era nuclear warheads remained on the territories of Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Under the terms of the Lisbon Protocol to the NPT, and following the 1995 Trilateral Agreement between Russia, Belarus, and the US, these were transferred to Russia, leaving Russia as the sole inheritor of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. It is estimated that the Soviet Union had approximately 45,000 nuclear weapons stockpiled at the time of its collapse, according to Viktor Mikhaylov, head of the Federal Agency on Atomic Energy (Russia).
The collapse of the Soviet Union allowed for a warming of relations with NATO. Fears of a nuclear holocaust lessened. In September 1997, the former secretary of the Russian Security Council Alexander Lebed claimed 100 &quot;suitcase sized&quot; nuclear weapons were unaccounted for. He said he was attempting to inventory the weapons when he was fired by President Boris Yeltsin in October 1996. Indeed, several US politicians have expressed worries and promised legislation addressing the threat.

There were allegations that Russia contributed to the North Korean nuclear program, selling it the equipment for the safe storage and transportation of nuclear materials. Nevertheless, Russia has condemned North Korean nuclear tests since then. The Russian Federation has also wider commercial interests in selling the nuclear technology to India and Iran, reaching understanding memorandums in training their technicians in their respected nuclear programs. Russia is allegedly making efforts to build its influential hold in Africa for earning several billions of pounds by selling nuclear technology to developing African countries.

Russia has reportedly trained its navy to target European sites with nuclear-capable missiles in a potential conflict with NATO, according to leaked documents. The plans reveal a strategy for strikes across Western Europe, emphasizing Russia&#x27;s reliance on nuclear weapons due to its conventional military limitations.

===Nuclear sabotage allegations===
The highest-ranking GRU defector Stanislav Lunev described alleged Soviet plans for using tactical nuclear weapons for sabotage against the United States in the event of war. He described Soviet-made suitcase nukes identified as RA-115s (or RA-115-01s for submersible weapons) which weigh . These portable bombs can last for many years if wired to an electric source. &quot;In case there is a loss of power, there is a battery backup. If the battery runs low, the weapon has a transmitter that sends a coded message – either by satellite or directly to a GRU post at a Russian embassy or consulate.&quot;

Lunev was personally looking for hiding places for weapons caches in the Shenandoah Valley area. He said that &quot;it is surprisingly easy to smuggle nuclear weapons into the US&quot; either across the Mexican border or using a small transport missile that can slip though undetected when launched from a Russian airplane. Searches of the areas identified by Lunev – who admits he never planted any weapons in the US – have been conducted, &quot;but law-enforcement officials have never found such weapons caches, with or without portable nuclear weapons&quot; in the US.

In a 2004 interview, colonel general of RVSN Viktor Yesin said that Soviet small-scale nuclear bombs have only been operated by the Army. All such devices have been stored in a weapons depot within Russia, and only left it for checks at the plant which produced them.

===2020 Russian nuclear deterrence state policy===

On June 2, 2020, President Putin signed an Executive Order formally titled &quot;Fundamentals of Russia’s Nuclear Deterrence State Policy&quot;, in an unprecedented public release of an official document on Russia&#x27;s nuclear policy. The six-page document identified the range of threats that Russia seeks to deter with its nuclear forces, clarified Russia&#x27;s general approach to nuclear deterrence, and articulated conditions under which Russia might use nuclear weapons. The policy endorses the use of nuclear weapons in response to a non-nuclear strike due to the improved capabilities of U.S. conventional weapons.

===Radiological weapons===
The assassination of Alexander Litvinenko by Russian state agents with radioactive polonium was described as the beginning of an era of nuclear terrorism using radiological weapons.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began in 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin placed Strategic Rocket Forces&#x27;s nuclear deterrence units on high alert, a move heavily condemned internationally. Putin warned that &quot;whoever tries to hinder us in Ukraine would see consequences, you have never seen in your history&quot;. According to the US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, Putin could potentially turn to nuclear weapons if he perceived an &quot;existential threat&quot; to the Russian state or regime; there has been speculation that he could regard defeat in Ukraine as an existential threat to his regime.

According to a peer-reviewed study published in the journal &quot;Nature Food&quot; in August 2022, a full-scale nuclear war between the United States and Russia, which together hold more than 90% of the world&#x27;s nuclear weapons, would kill 360 million people directly and more than 5 billion indirectly by starvation during a nuclear winter.

In September 2022, Putin announced the mobilization of Russian forces, and threatened nuclear retaliation against the west if Russia&#x27;s territorial integrity was threatened.

On February 21, 2023, Putin suspended Russia&#x27;s participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States, saying that Russia would not allow the US and NATO to inspect its nuclear facilities. On March 25, 2023, Putin announced that Russia would be stationing tactical nuclear operations in Belarus. On June 14, 2023, Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko stated that Belarus had started to take delivery of nuclear weapons in a TV interview with Russian state channel, Russia-1.

On 25 September 2024, Putin warned the West that if attacked with conventional weapons Russia would consider a nuclear retaliation, in an apparent deviation from the no first use doctrine. Putin also warned nuclear powers that if they supported another country&#x27;s attack on Russia, they would be considered participants in such aggression. Putin has made several implicit nuclear threats since the outbreak of war against Ukraine. Experts say Putin&#x27;s announcement was aimed at dissuading the United States, the United Kingdom and France from allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied long-range missiles such as the Storm Shadow and ATACMS in strikes against Russia.

==Biological weapons==
The Soviet Union covertly operated the world&#x27;s largest, longest, and most sophisticated biological weapons programs. The program began in the 1920s and lasted until at least September 1992 but has possibly been continued by Russia after that. Thereby, the Soviet Union violated its obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention, which it had signed on April 10, 1972, and ratified on March 26, 1975.

In the early 1970s, the Soviet Union significantly enlarged its offensive biological weapons programs. After 1975, the program of biological weapons was run primarily by the &quot;civilian&quot; Biopreparat agency, although it also included numerous facilities run by the Soviet Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Chemical Industry, Ministry of Health, and Soviet Academy of Sciences.

According to Ken Alibek, who was deputy-director of Biopreparat, the Soviet biological weapons agency, and who defected to the United States in 1992, weapons were developed in labs in isolated areas of the Soviet Union including mobilization facilities at Omutninsk, Penza and Pokrov and research facilities at Moscow, Stirzhi and Vladimir. These weapons were tested at several facilities most often at &quot;Rebirth Island&quot; (Vozrozhdeniya) in the Aral Sea by firing the weapons into the air above monkeys tied to posts, the monkeys would then be monitored to determine the effects. According to Alibek, although Soviet offensive program was officially ended in 1992, Russia may be still involved in the activities prohibited by BWC.

In 1993, the story about the Sverdlovsk anthrax leak was published in Russia. The incident occurred when spores of anthrax were accidentally released from a military facility in the city of Sverdlovsk (formerly, and now again, Yekaterinburg) east of Moscow on April 2, 1979. The ensuing outbreak of the disease resulted in 94 people becoming infected, 64 of whom died over a period of six weeks.

In 2022 Russian Ministry of Defense started construction of a new massive facility at Sergiev Posad-6 site that hosted bioweapons research in Soviet times. The site belonging to 48th Central Scientific Research Institute (48 ЦНИИ) of the Russian Ministry of Defense, featuring biological security labs was even featured on Russian TV when a delegation from the ministry, then led by Sergei Shoigu visited it. Also in 2022 the 48th Institute has registered a patent for &quot;protective medium for freeze-drying of Yersinia pestis&quot;, a common biological weapon pathogen.

As of 2024, the United States Department of State &quot;assesses that the Russian Federation (Russia) maintains an offensive [biological weapons] program and is in violation of its obligation under Articles I and II of the BWC. The issue of compliance by Russia with the BWC has been of concern for many years.&quot;

==Chemical weapons==

Russia signed the Chemical Weapons Convention on January 13, 1993, and ratified it on November 5, 1997. Russia declared an arsenal of 39,967 tons of chemical weapons in 1997 consisting of:
*blister agents: Lewisite, mustard, Lewisite-mustard-mix (HL)
*nerve agents: Sarin, Soman, VX

Ratification was followed by three years of inaction on chemical weapons destruction because of the August 1998 Russian financial crisis.

Russia met its treaty obligations by destroying 1% of its chemical agents by the Chemical Weapons Convention&#x27;s 2002 deadline, but requested technical and financial assistance and extensions on the deadlines of 2004 and 2007 due to the environmental challenges of chemical disposal. This extension procedure spelled out in the treaty has been utilized by other countries, including the United States. The extended deadline for complete destruction (April 2012) was not met. As of October 2011, Russia had destroyed 57% of its stockpile. Russia also destroyed all of its declared Category 2 (10,616 MTs) and Category 3 chemicals.

Russia has stored its chemical weapons (or the required chemicals) which it declared within the CWC at eight locations. In Gorny (Saratov Oblast) (2.9% of the declared stockpile by mass) and Kambarka (Udmurt Republic) (15.9%) stockpiles have already been destroyed. In Shchuchye (Kurgan Oblast) (13.6%), Maradykovsky (Kirov Oblast) (17.4%) and (Penza Oblast) (17.2%) destruction takes place, while installations are under construction in Pochep (Bryansk Oblast) (18.8%) and Kizner (Udmurt Republic) (14.2%).

The last Russian chemical disposal facility in Kizner, Udmurtia, was opened in December 2013.

On September 27, 2017, OPCW announced that Russia had destroyed its entire declared chemical weapons stockpile, even though they continued using Novichok agents. Ukraine claims Russia used chemical weapons in Mariupol.

===Novichok agents===
A range of Novichok agents were developed and tested in the 1970s and 1980s, but the intended Novichok weapons production site at the Pavlodar Chemical Plant in Soviet Kazakhstan was still under construction when it was decided to demolish the chemical weapons building in 1987 in view of the forthcoming Chemical Weapons Convention.

In March 2018, former GRU agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned in Salisbury, United Kingdom by a chemical agent later confirmed to be Novichok. The incident raised new controversy over Russia&#x27;s potential production and use of chemical weapons, with the United Kingdom accusing the Russian government or rogue Russian agents of orchestrating the attack, a claim Russia repeatedly denied.

In August 2020, Russian opposition figure and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny was poisoned in Tomsk, Russia by a chemical agent later confirmed to be Novichok. A joint investigation by Bellingcat, CNN, Der Spiegel, and The Insider with contributions from El País implicates Russia&#x27;s Federal Security Service (FSB) in the near-fatal nerve-agent poisoning, a fact denied by Russia. Navalny later called what appears to be one of the FSB agents responsible for the cleanup operation who indicates they were tasked to clean Navalny&#x27;s underpants of Novichok.

Another Russia chemical weapon is Kolokol-1, an aerosolized opioid incapacitating agent though to be carfentanil.

=== Use during the invasion of Ukraine===
In the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces reportedly used chemical weapons 465 times between February 24, 2022, and December 2023, usually as tear gas grenades. In May 2023, a television report on Russia&#x27;s Channel One showed a Russian battalion commander talking about the effectiveness of chemicals used as weapons. The report also showed a drone dropping a tear gas grenade on a dugout. In December 2023, the Russian 810th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade wrote about its use of drones to drop K-51 grenades containing CS tear gas on Ukrainian positions. The use of tear gas is banned by international Chemical Weapons Convention and considered a chemical weapon if applied by military forces during warfare. The United States accused Russia of also using Chloropicrin as a chemical weapon in Ukraine.

<doc id="588946" wikidata="Q121510" url="?curid=588946" title="1036 Ganymed">
<text>1036 Ganymed, provisional designation &quot;&quot;, is a stony asteroid on a highly eccentric orbit, classified as a near-Earth object of the Amor group. It was discovered by German astronomer Walter Baade at the Bergedorf Observatory in Hamburg on 23 October 1924, and named after Ganymede from Greek mythology. With a diameter of approximately , Ganymed is the largest of all near-Earth objects but does not cross Earth&#x27;s orbit. The S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 10.3 hours. In October 2024, it is predicted to approach Earth at a distance of .

== Orbit and classification ==

Ganymed is an Amor asteroid, a subgroup of the near-Earth asteroids that approach the orbit of Earth from beyond, but do not cross it. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.2–4.1 AU about once every 4 years and 4 months (i.e., 52 months or 1,587 days; semi-major axis of 2.66 AU). Its orbit has a high eccentricity of 0.53 and an inclination of 27° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins at the discovering observatory on , the night after its official discovery observation.

=== Close approaches ===
====Earth approach====
Ganymed has a minimum orbit intersection distance with Earth of , or 133 lunar distance. Its next pass of the Earth will be at a distance of on .

====Mars approach====
Due to the high eccentricity of its orbit, Ganymed is also a Mars-crosser, intersecting the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.66 AU. On , it will pass at a distance of from Mars.

== Name ==
The minor planet of Ganymed was named after Ganymede from Greek mythology, using the German spelling (&quot;Ganymed&quot;). Ganymede was a Trojan prince abducted by Zeus to serve as a cup-bearer to the Greek gods. The name had previously also been given to Jupiter&#x27;s third moon, &quot;Ganymede&quot;, which was discovered in 1610 by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei.

== Physical characteristics ==

Owing to its early discovery date, Ganymed has a rich observational history. A 1931 paper published the absolute magnitude, based on observations to date, as 9.24, slightly brighter than the present value of 9.45.

Ganymed is a stony S-type asteroid, in the Tholen, SMASS and in the S3OS2 taxonomy. This means that it is relatively reflective and composed of iron and magnesium silicates. Spectral measurements put Ganymed in the S (VI) spectral subtype, indicating a surface rich in orthopyroxenes, and possibly metals (although if metals are present they are covered and not readily apparent in the spectra).

=== Diameter and albedo ===
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Ganymed measures between 31.66 and 37.67 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.218 and 0.293.

The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; derives an albedo of 0.2809 and a mean-diameter of 31.57 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.50. Carry published a diameter kilometers in 2012.

An occultation of a star by Ganymed was observed from California on 22 August 1985. Additional observations in 2011 gave an occultation cross-section with a semi-major and minor axis of 39.3 and 18.9 kilometers, respectively.

=== Rotation and poles ===
A large number of rotational lightcurves of Ganymed have been obtained from photometric observations since 1985. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurves obtained by American photometrist Frederick Pilcher at his Organ Mesa Observatory in New Mexico during 2011 gave a rotation period of 10.297 hours with a consolidated brightness amplitude between 0.28 and 0.31 magnitude ().

Three studies using modeled photometric data from the Uppsala Asteroid Photometric Catalogue, WISE thermal infrared data and other sources, gave a concurring period of 10.313, 10.31284, and 10.31304 hours, respectively. Each modeled lightcurve also determined two spin axes of (214.0°, −73.0°), (190.0°, −78.0°), as well as (198.0°, −79.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β; L1/B1), respectively.

In 1998, radar observations of Ganymed by the Arecibo radio telescope produced images of the asteroid, revealing a roughly spherical object. Polarimetric observations conducted by Japanese astronomers concluded that there was a weak correlation between the object&#x27;s light- and polarimetry curve as a function of rotation angle. Because polarization is dependent on surface terrain and composition, rather than the observed size of the object like the lightcurve, this suggests that the surface features of the asteroid are roughly uniform over its observed surface.

<text>Geuzen (; ; ) was a name assumed by the confederacy of Calvinist Dutch nobles, who from 1566 opposed Spanish rule in the Netherlands. The most successful group of them operated at sea, and so were called &quot;Watergeuzen&quot; (; ; ). In the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the Capture of Brielle by the &quot;Watergeuzen&quot; in 1572 provided the first foothold on land for the rebels, who would conquer the northern Netherlands and establish an independent Dutch Republic. They can be considered either as privateers or pirates, depending on the circumstances or motivations.

==Origin of the name==
The leaders of the nobles who signed a solemn league known as the Compromise of Nobles, by which they bound themselves to assist in defending the rights and liberties of the Netherlands against the civil and religious despotism of Philip II of Spain, were Louis of Nassau and Hendrick van Brederode. On 5 April 1566, permission was obtained for the confederates to present a petition of grievances, called the Request, to the regent, Margaret, Duchess of Parma. About 250 nobles marched to the palace accompanied by Louis of Nassau and Brederode. The regent was at first alarmed at the appearance of so large a body, but one of her councillors, Berlaymont, allegedly remarked &quot;N&#x27;ayez pas peur Madame, ce ne sont que des gueux&quot; (&quot;Fear not madam, they are only beggars&quot;).
The appellation was not forgotten. In a speech at a great feast held by some 300 confederates at the Hotel Culemburg three days later, Brederode declared that if need be they were all ready to become beggars in their country&#x27;s cause. Henceforward the name became a party title. The patriot party adopted the emblems of beggary, the wallet and the bowl, as trinkets to be worn on their hats or their girdles, and a medal was struck having on one side the head of Philip II, on the other two clasped hands with the motto &quot;Fidèle au roy, jusqu&#x27;à porter la besace&quot; (&quot;Loyal to the King, up to carrying the beggar&#x27;s pouch&quot;). The original league of Beggars was short-lived, crushed by Alba, but its principles survived and were to be ultimately triumphant.

In the Dutch language the word &quot;&quot; is used for linguistic reappropriation: a pejorative term used with pride by the people called that way.

==&quot;Sea Beggars&quot;==
In 1569 William of Orange, who had now openly placed himself at the head of the party of revolt, granted letters of marque to a number of vessels manned by crews of desperadoes drawn from all nationalities. Eighteen ships received letters of marque, which were equipped by Louis of Nassau in the French Huguenot port of La Rochelle, which they continued to use as a base. 

These privateers under the command of a succession of daring and reckless leaders, the best-known of whom is William de la Marck, Lord of Lumey, were called &quot;Sea Beggars&quot;, &quot; in French, or &quot;&quot;&quot; in Dutch. At first they were content merely to plunder both by sea and land, carrying their booty to the English ports where they were able to refit and replenish their stores. Already by the end of 1569, 84 Sea Beggars&#x27; ships were in action.

However, in 1572, Queen Elizabeth I of England abruptly refused to admit the Sea beggars to her harbours. No longer having refuge, the sea beggars, under the command of De la Marck, Willem Bloys van Treslong and Lenaert Jansz de Graeff, made a desperate attack upon Brielle, which they seized by surprise in the absence of the Spanish garrison on 1 April 1572. Encouraged by this success, they now sailed to Vlissingen, which was also taken by a &quot;coup de cul&quot;. The capture of these two towns prompted several nearby towns to declare their support for the revolt, starting a chain reaction that resulted in the majority of Holland joining in a general revolt of the Netherlands, and is regarded as the real beginning of Dutch independence.

In 1573 the Sea Beggars defeated a Spanish squadron under the command of Admiral Bossu off the port of Hoorn in the Battle on the Zuiderzee. Mixing with the native population, they quickly sparked rebellions against Duke of Alba in town after town and spread the resistance southward.

In 1574 the Sea Beggars, under Admiral Louis de Boisot participated in the lifting of the Siege of Leiden.

Some of the forefathers of the Dutch naval heroes began their naval careers as sea beggars, such as Evert Heindricxzen, the grandfather of Cornelis Evertsen the Elder.

==Geuzen symbols==

As part of a propaganda campaign including prints, pamphlets and much else, many Geuzen medals were created as badges of affiliation, using a wide range of symbolism, including that associated with the Ottoman Empire. William I of Orange sought Ottoman assistance against the Spanish king Philip II. 
The &quot;Geuzen&quot; were expressing their anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic sentiments. They considered the Turks to be less threatening than the Spaniards. During the years between 1579 and 1582, representatives from Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Paşa travelled several times from Istanbul to Antwerp.

There were, in fact, objective grounds for such an alliance. At the same time that the Dutch rebels were conducting their raids on Spanish shipping, the Ottoman Empire was involved in its own naval war with Spain, culminating in the 1571 Battle of Lepanto in Greece. For Spain to face a coordinated double-pronged naval challenge, by the Ottomans in the Mediterranean and the Dutch in north European waters, would be to the advantage of both of its foes.

The slogan Liever Turks dan Paaps seems to have been largely rhetorical, and their beggars medals in the form of a half moon were meant symbolically. The Dutch hardly contemplated life under the Sultan. Moreover, there was no direct contact between the Geuzen and the Turkish authorities. The Turks were considered infidels, and the heresy of Islam alone disqualified them from assuming a more central (or consistent) role in the rebels&#x27; propaganda.

==In popular culture==

* The Geuzen are featured very prominently in Dutch and Flemish popular novels, such as Charles de Coster&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak&quot; and comics series such as &quot;Cori, de Scheepsjongen&quot; by Bob De Moor, &quot;Tijl Uilenspiegel&quot; and &quot;De Geuzen&quot; by Willy Vandersteen and &quot;Gilles de Geus&quot; by Hanco Kolk and Peter de Wit. In English they appear in Cecelia Holland&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sea Beggars&quot;. 

* During the German occupation of The Netherlands in 1940–1945 an anti-German resistance group in the area of Vlaardingen, Maassluis and Rotterdam adopted the name of &quot;Geuzen&quot;.

* The Sea Beggars are also a unique unit of the Dutch Empire in Civilization V.

* The Sea Beggar is the mascot of Providence Christian College.

<text>Malcolm Cowley (August 24, 1898 – March 27, 1989) was an American writer, editor, historian, poet, and literary critic. His best known works include his first book of poetry, &quot;Blue Juniata&quot; (1929), and his memoir, &quot;Exile&#x27;s Return&quot; (1934; rev. 1951), written as a chronicler and fellow traveller of the Lost Generation and an influential editor and talent scout at Viking Press.

==Early life==
Cowley was born August 24, 1898, in Belsano, Cambria County, Pennsylvania, to William Cowley and Josephine Hutmacher. He grew up in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh, where his father, William, was a homeopathic doctor. Cowley attended Shakespeare Street elementary school and in 1915 graduated from Peabody High School, where his boyhood friend Kenneth Burke was also a student. Cowley&#x27;s first published writing appeared in his high school newspaper.

He attended Harvard University, but his studies were interrupted when he joined the American Field Service during World War I to drive ambulances and munitions trucks for the French army. He returned to Harvard in 1919 and became editor of &quot;The Harvard Advocate&quot;. He graduated with a B.A. in 1920.

==Life in Paris==
Cowley was one of the many literary and artistic figures who migrated to Paris in the 1920s. He became one of the best-known chroniclers of the American expatriates in Europe, as he frequently spent time with writers like Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, E. E. Cummings, Edmund Wilson, Erskine Caldwell, and others associated with American literary modernism. In &quot;Blue Juniata&quot;, Cowley described these Americans who travelled abroad during the postwar period as a &quot;wandering, landless, uprooted generation&quot;; similarly Hemingway, claiming to have taken the phrase from Gertrude Stein, called them the &quot;lost generation&quot;. This sense of uprootedness deeply affected Cowley&#x27;s appreciation for the necessities of artistic freedom. It moreover informed his ideal of cosmopolitanism in contrast to the fervent nationalism(s) that had led to World War I. Cowley recounted his experiences in &quot;Exile&#x27;s Return&quot;, writing, &quot;our whole training was involuntarily directed toward destroying whatever roots we had in the soil, toward eradicating our local and regional peculiarities, toward making us homeless citizens of the world&quot;.

While Cowley associated with many American writers in Europe, the sense of admiration was not always mutual. Hemingway removed direct reference to Cowley in a later version of &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot;, replacing his name with the description, &quot;that American poet with a pile of saucers in front of him and a stupid look on his potato face talking about the Dada movement&quot;. John Dos Passos&#x27;s private correspondence revealed the contempt he held for Cowley, but also the care writers took to hide their personal feelings in order to protect their careers once Cowley had become an editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Regardless, &quot;Exile&#x27;s Return&quot; was one of the first autobiographical texts to foreground the American expatriate experience. Despite not selling well during its first publication, it established Cowley as one of the most trenchant emissaries of the Lost Generation. Literary historian Van Wyck Brooks described &quot;Exile&#x27;s Return&quot; as &quot;an irreplaceable literary record of the most dramatic period in American literary history.&quot;

==Early career and involvement in politics==
While in Paris, Cowley found himself drawn to the avant-garde sensibilities of Dada, and also, like many other intellectuals of the period, to Marxism and its attempts to demystify the socioeconomic and political conditions that had plunged Europe into a devastating war. He travelled frequently between Paris and Greenwich Village in New York, and through these intersecting social circles came into close proximity, though he never officially joined, with the U.S. Communist Party. In 1929, Cowley became an associate editor of the left-leaning magazine &quot;The New Republic&quot;, which he steered in &quot;a resolutely communist direction&quot; The same year, he translated and wrote a foreword to the 1913 French novel &#x27;La Colline Inspirée&#x27;, by Maurice Barrès. By the early 1930s, Cowley became increasingly involved in radical politics. In 1932, he joined Edmund Wilson, Mary Heaton Vorse, and Waldo Frank as union-sponsored observers of the miners&#x27; strikes in Kentucky. Their lives were threatened by the mines&#x27; owners, and Frank was badly beaten. When &quot;Exile&#x27;s Return&quot; was first published in 1934, it put forth a distinctly Marxist interpretation of history and social struggle.

In 1935, Cowley helped to establish a leftist collective, The League of American Writers. Other notable members included Archibald MacLeish, Upton Sinclair, Clifford Odets, Langston Hughes, Carl Sandburg, Carl Van Doren, Waldo Frank, David Ogden Stewart, John Dos Passos, Lillian Hellman, and Dashiell Hammett. Cowley was appointed Vice President, and over the next few years became involved in numerous campaigns, including attempts to persuade the United States government to support the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He resigned in 1940, owing to concerns that the organization was too heavily influenced by the Communist Party.

In 1941, near the outset of the United States&#x27; involvement in World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Cowley&#x27;s associate, poet and &quot;popular front&quot; interventionist Archibald MacLeish, as head of the War Department&#x27;s Office of Facts and Figures (precursor to the Office of War Information). MacLeish recruited Cowley as an analyst. This decision resulted in anti-communist journalists such as Whittaker Chambers and Westbrook Pegler publicly exposing Cowley&#x27;s left-wing sympathies. Cowley soon found himself in the crosshairs of congressman Martin Dies (D-Tex.) and the House Un-American Activities Committee. Dies accused Cowley of belonging to seventy-two communist or communist-front organizations. This number was certainly an exaggeration, but Cowley had no recourse to deny it. MacLeish soon came under pressure from J. Edgar Hoover and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to dismiss Cowley. In January 1942, MacLeish sent his reply that the FBI needed a course of instruction in history. &quot;Don&#x27;t you think it would be a good thing if all investigators could be made to understand that Liberalism is not only not a crime but actually the attitude of the President of the United States and the greater part of his Administration?&quot;, he said. Nevertheless, Cowley resigned two months later, vowing to never write about politics again.

==Editorial career and academia==
In 1944, having been more or less silenced politically, Cowley began a career as a literary advisor, editor, and talent scout at Viking Press. He was hired to work on the &quot;Portable Library&quot; series, which had started in 1943 with &quot;As You Were: A Portable Library of American Prose and Poetry Assembled for Members of the Armed Forces and Merchant Marine&quot;. In its inception, the &quot;Portable Library&quot; was an anthology of paperback reprints that could be mass-produced cheaply and marketed to military personnel. It also emphasized an American literary tradition that could be construed as patriotic during wartime. Yet Cowley was able to steer the series toward what were, in his esteem, underappreciated writers.

He first set out to edit &quot;The Portable Hemingway&quot; (1944). At the time, Hemingway was largely considered to be a sparse and simplistic writer. Cowley departed from this perception in his introductory essay, claiming instead that Hemingway could be read as tortured and submerged. This revaluation remains the dominant critical opinion today. Literary critic Mark McGurl argues that Hemingway&#x27;s tip-of-the-iceberg style has become one of the most emulated in twentieth-century American prose, his name all but synonymous with the &quot;pathos of understatement&quot; and &quot;the value of craft as represented by the practice of multiple revision&quot;.

&quot;The Portable Hemingway&quot; sold so well that Cowley was able to convince Viking to publish a &quot;Portable Faulkner&quot; in 1946. William Faulkner was, at the time, slipping into literary obscurity. By the 1930s, he was working as a Hollywood screenwriter and in danger of seeing his works go out of print. Cowley again argued for a dramatic revaluation of Faulkner&#x27;s position in American letters, enlisting him as an honorary member of the Lost Generation. Robert Penn Warren called &quot;The Portable Faulkner&quot; the &quot;great watershed&quot; moment for Faulkner&#x27;s reputation, and many scholars view Cowley&#x27;s essay as having resuscitated Faulkner&#x27;s career. Faulkner won a Nobel Prize in 1949. He later said, &quot;I owe Malcolm Cowley the kind of debt no man could ever repay&quot;.

Cowley then published a revised edition of &quot;Exile&#x27;s Return&quot; in 1951. The revisions downplayed some of the more overtly Marxist tenets, and more obviously emphasized the &quot;return&quot; of the exile as a necessary step toward reestablishing a nation&#x27;s solidarity: &quot;the old pattern of alienation and reintegration, or departure and return, that is repeated in scores of European myths and continually re-embodied in life&quot;, Cowley wrote. This time the book sold much better. Cowley also published a &quot;Portable Hawthorne&quot; (1948), &quot;The Literary Tradition&quot; (1954), and edited a new edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; (1959), by Walt Whitman. These were followed by &quot;Black Cargoes, A History of the Atlantic Slave Trade&quot; (1962), &quot;Fitzgerald and the Jazz Age&quot; (1966), &quot;Think Back on Us&quot; (1967), &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1968), &quot;Lesson of the Masters&quot; (1971) and &quot;A Second Flowering&quot; (1973).

Cowley taught creative writing at the college-level beginning in the 1950s. Among his students were Larry McMurtry, Peter S. Beagle, Wendell Berry, as well as Ken Kesey, whose &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1962) Cowley helped publish at Viking. Writing workshops were a recent development at the time (the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop was founded in 1936), yet by midcentury their proliferation was of note for both writers and publishers. Cowley taught also at Yale, Michigan, Minnesota, Washington, California at Irvine and Berkeley, and even the prestigious Stegner Fellowship at Stanford, among other places, but he seldom maintained a full-time teaching appointment. Literary and cultural critic Benjamin Kirbach argues that this flitting back-and-forth between universities and the publishing industry allowed Cowley to reconcile his cosmopolitan ideal within the constraints of the academy. Kirbach writes: &quot;Cowley&#x27;s itinerancy—his seemingly effortless movement between universities and the publishing industry, between writers individual and collective—played a crucial role in institutionalizing [literary] modernism&quot; in the twentieth century.

As an editorial consultant to Viking Press, he pushed for the publication of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot;. Cowley&#x27;s work anthologizing 28 Fitzgerald short stories and editing a reissue of &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;, restructured based on Fitzgerald&#x27;s notes, both in 1951, were key to reviving Fitzgerald&#x27;s reputation as well, and his introduction to Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, written in the early 1960s, is said to have had a similar effect on Anderson&#x27;s reputation. Other works of literary and critical importance include &quot;Eight More Harvard Poets&quot; (1923), &quot;A Second Flowering: Works &amp; Days of the Lost Generation&quot; (1973), &quot;And I Worked at the Writer&#x27;s Trade&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Dream of the Golden Mountains: Remembering the 1930s&quot; (1980).
&quot;And I Worked&quot; won a 1980 U.S. National Book Award in the one-year category Autobiography.

When &quot;The Portable Malcolm Cowley&quot; (Donald Faulkner, editor) was published in 1990, the year after Cowley&#x27;s death, Michael Rogers wrote in &quot;Library Journal&quot;: &quot;Though a respected name in hardcore literary circles, in general the late Cowley is one of the unsung heroes of 20th-century American literature. Poet, critic, Boswell of the Lost Generation of which he himself was a member, savior of Faulkner&#x27;s dwindling reputation, editor of Kerouac&#x27;s On the Road, discoverer of John Cheever, Cowley knew everybody and wrote about them with sharp insight. . . . . Cowley&#x27;s writings on the great books are as important as the books themselves . . . . All American literature collections should own this.&quot;

To the end, Cowley remained a humanitarian in the world of letters. He wrote writer Louise Bogan in 1941, &quot;I&#x27;m almost getting pathologically tender-hearted. I have been caused so much pain by reviewers and political allrightniks of several shades of opinion that I don&#x27;t want to cause pain to anybody.&quot;

==Marriages and death==
Cowley married artist Peggy Baird; they were divorced in 1931. His second wife was Muriel Maurer. Together they had one son, Robert William Cowley, who is an editor and military historian.

He died of a heart attack March 27, 1989.

<text>The Ford Versailles was a large family car sold between 1991 and 1996 in Brazil and Argentina. It was a version of the Volkswagen Santana sold in the 1990s, when Ford and Volkswagen shared models in South America in a joint venture known as Autolatina. It replaced the Ford Del Rey in Brazil and the locally built Ford Sierra in Argentina. The station wagon version was sold as the [[Ford Royale]].

==History==

The Ford Versailles took over from the Ford Del Rey in 1991 (for the 1992 model year). Design differed from the Santana by using Ford&#x27;s corporate front end treatment, somewhat squarer taillights, and more upright D-pillars. Like the Santana, the Versailles was available as a two- or four-door sedan, and as a station wagon called the Ford Royale. The Royale was initially only offered as a three-door, even though the Volkswagen Quantum on which it was based was available with five doors. (It was alleged that Volkswagen did not want the Royale to be available as a five-door model, as this would have posed a competitive threat to the popular Quantum.). In 1995 and 1996, Ford did offer a five-door version of the Royale. The Versailles and Royale were both built at Volkswagen&#x27;s plant in São Bernardo do Campo and not at Ford&#x27;s own facility.

The GL came standard with a 1.8-liter Volkswagen engine, or an optional 2.0-liter version. Both were offered in either gasoline or alcohol-powered versions. The top Ghia model only received the 2.0-liter engine and was also available with electronic fuel injection. From 1993, fuel injection became available on the GL as well.

==Changes==
In 1994, the model-specific front seats were replaced with the cheaper units from the locally built Ford Escort. In 1995, the Autolatina joint venture ended. Nonetheless, Ford presented a facelifted version of the Versailles and Royale, which coincided with the availability of a five-door station wagon.

==Ford Galaxy==
The Versailles was also sold as the Ford Galaxy in Argentina (not to be confused with the European MPV of the same name), where it replaced the Ford Sierra. Both the Versailles and the Galaxy were eventually replaced by the Ford Mondeo.

<doc id="588981" wikidata="Q209824" url="?curid=588981" title="Provinces of Bulgaria">
<text>The provinces of Bulgaria () are the first-level administrative subdivisions of the country.

Since 1999, Bulgaria has been divided into 28 provinces ( – &quot;oblasti;&quot; singular: – &quot;oblast&quot;; also translated as &quot;regions&quot;) which correspond approximately to the 28 districts (in – &quot;okrǎg&quot;, plural: – &quot;okrǎzi&quot;), that existed before 1987.

The provinces are further subdivided into 265 municipalities (singular: – &quot;obshtina&quot;, plural: – &quot;obshtini&quot;).

Sofia – the capital city of Bulgaria and the largest settlement in the country – is the administrative centre of both Sofia Province and Sofia City Province (Sofia-grad). The capital is included (together with three other cities plus 34 villages) in Sofia Capital Municipality (over 90% of whose population lives in Sofia), which is the sole municipality comprising Sofia City province.

== Terminology ==


The provinces do not have official names – legally (in the President&#x27;s decree on their constitution), they are not named but only described as &quot;oblast with administrative centre [Noun]&quot; – together with a list of the constituting municipalities. In Bulgaria they are usually called &quot;[Adjective] Oblast&quot;; occasionally they are referred to as &quot;Oblast [Noun]&quot; and rarely as &quot;oblast with administrative centre [Noun]&quot;.

The Bulgarian term &quot;област&quot; (&quot;oblast&quot;) is preferably translated into English as &quot;province&quot;, in order to avoid disambiguation and distinguish from the former unit called &quot;окръг&quot; (&quot;okrag&quot;, translated as &quot;district&quot;) and the term &quot;регион&quot; (always translated as &quot;region&quot;). At any rate, &quot;district&quot; and &quot;region&quot; are sometimes still used to name these contemporary 28 units.
* &quot;region&quot;: &quot;28 regions (en) / région (fr) / oblast (bg)&quot; – in ISO 3166-2 Newsletter II-3 (2011-12-13, corrected 2011-12-15)
* &quot;district&quot;: &quot;The territory of the South Central Region encompasses five districts – Pazardzhik, Plovdiv, Smolyan, Haskovo, and Kyrdzhali.&quot; – in a website of the European Commission.

== Provinces ==
&lt;!--

On 1 January 1999, the old districts were restored with some modifications, but the designation &quot;oblast&quot; (&quot;province&quot;) was kept.

<doc id="588991" wikidata="Q804311" url="?curid=588991" title="Blagoevgrad Province">
<text>Blagoevgrad Province (, &quot;oblast Blagoevgrad&quot; or Благоевградска област, &quot;Blagoevgradska oblast&quot;), also known as Pirin Macedonia or [[Bulgarian Macedonia]] (), (&quot;Pirinska Makedoniya or Bulgarska Makedoniya&quot;) is a province (&quot;oblast&quot;) of southwestern Bulgaria. It borders four other Bulgarian provinces to the north and east, the Greek region of Macedonia to the south, and North Macedonia to the west. The province has 14 municipalities with 12 towns. Its principal city is Blagoevgrad, while other significant towns include Bansko, Gotse Delchev, Melnik, Petrich, Razlog, Sandanski, and Simitli.

== Geography ==
The province has a territory of and a population of 323,552 (). It is the third largest in Bulgaria after Burgas and Sofia Provinces and comprises 5.8% of the country&#x27;s territory. Blagoevgrad Province includes the mountains, or parts of, Rila (highest point of the Balkans — Musala summit, 2925 m), Pirin (highest point — Vihren summit, 2914 m), the Rhodopes, Slavyanka, Belasitsa, Vlahina, Maleshevo, Ograzhden, and Stargach. There are two major rivers — Struma River and Mesta River — with population concentrations along their valleys, which are also the main transport corridors.

=== Climate ===

The climate varies from temperate continental to Mediterranean in the southernmost parts. Natural resources are timber, mineral springs, coal, construction materials, including marble and granite. The beautiful and preserved environment is widely considered an important resource. A number of national parks and protected territories care for the biodiversity. Arable land is 38.8% and forests constitute 52% of the province&#x27;s territory.

== History ==
The Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 saw the annexation of the area to the Bulgarian state. Before the wars, it had been under Ottoman rule for over five centuries.

== Municipalities ==

The Blagoevgrad province (област, &quot;oblast&quot;) contains 14 municipalities (singular: община, &quot;obshtina&quot; - plural: общини, &quot;obshtini&quot;). The following table shows the names of each municipality in English and Cyrillic, the main town (in bold) or village, and the population of each as of 2011.

== Economy ==

The region is characterized with diversified economic branch structure: food and tobacco processing industries, agriculture, tourism, transport and communications, textile industry, timber and furniture industries, iron processing and machinery industry, construction materials industry, as well as pharmaceuticals, plastics, paper and shoes production. Approximately 10% of the population is unemployed (close to the national average). There are 4 major hospitals in the province.

With its railway line and road connection, the region forms the heart of the land-based trading route between northern Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. Since the early 2000s the province enjoys a mini boom in trade from thousands of Greek day-trippers from across the border, purchasing cheaper goods and services (dental, opticians, etc.). Since the early 1990s, the region has also attracted Greek manufacturers who moved their production line from Greece, especially to Petrich. It was an important tourist destination during the communist years for East Germans and is slowly picking up again. The unique town of Melnik was once a wealthy centre built on the back of exiled phanariots from Constantinople. Now it is a centre for wine production and offers eco-tourism.

Infrastructure remains relatively underdeveloped, especially regarding road and rail communications. It remains an important target for potential EU funding. There are two major infrastructural projects in the region. The Struma motorway, which is planned to connect the capital Sofia with the Greek border and the port of Thessaloniki, is going to run through the valley of the Sruma River, and will be ready in a few years. The second project is the airport of Bansko. The cost is currently estimated at around €30,000,000.

== Culture, education and monuments ==
Historical and archaeological monuments include the ruins of antique Thracian and Roman settlements, Early Christian basilicas, medieval Byzantine and Bulgarian towns, monasteries and fortresses, as well as many preserved buildings and whole villages — examples of the architecture from the Ottoman period (like Melnik, the Rozhen Monastery and Bansko).

A theatre, a library with 345,000 tomes, and an opera house are situated in the provincial centre, Blagoevgrad. There are art galleries in Bansko, Blagoevgrad and Sandanski. Many small cultural institutions, &quot;chitalishta&quot;, are dispersed around the province. The Pirin State Ensemble is the most prominent among the numerous folklore and music bands. There are 10 museums in the province that preserve the rich historical, ethnographic and archaeological heritage. Cultural events include the Theatre Festival in Blagoevgrad, the Jazz Festival in Bansko and the Melnik Evenings of Poetry.

The Southwestern University and the American University in Bulgaria are situated in Blagoevgrad; the latter is the second largest American university campus in Europe and is located in the former headquarters of the communist party. Annually the city draws around 10,000 students from the country and abroad. The number of schools in the province is 182.

=== Notable people from Blagoevgrad Province ===

A number of the province&#x27;s towns were renamed in honor of major figures such as Sandanski (after Yane Sandanski).

*Paisiy Hilendarski (1722–1773)
*Neofit Rilski (1793–1881)

===Ethnic groups===

Total population (2011 census): 323 552&lt;br&gt;

According to the 2011 Bulgarian census, there were 561 ethnic Macedonians (0.2%) in the Blagoevgrad Province, out of a total of 1,654 Macedonians in the entire country. During the same year, a total of 429 citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia resided in the province. Since registering a permanent residence in Bulgaria is a requirement for becoming naturalized in Bulgaria, a total of 18,000 Macedonian nationals were registered as residents in the Blagoevgrad Municipality alone by 2017. They are citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia, but have also Bulgarian citizenship, based on declared Bulgarian ethnic origin; their number in the whole of the province is higher. However, the vast majority of these people do not permanently reside in the Blagoevgrad Province.

Blagoevgrad Province is currently one of the best-represented provinces in Bulgarian football, with 3 teams playing in the Bulgarian A PFG (second only to Sofia with 4) — FC Vihren Sandanski, PFC Belasitsa Petrich and PFC Pirin 1922 Blagoevgrad. One more team from the province, PFC Pirin Blagoevgrad (as distinct from Pirin 1922), began the 2005/06 season in the highest Bulgarian division, but disbanded shortly afterwards due to financial problems.

<text>Jonas Lauritz Idemil Lie (; 6 November 1833 – 5 July 1908) was a Norwegian novelist, poet, and playwright who, together with Henrik Ibsen, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Alexander Kielland, is considered to have been one of &quot;the Four Greats&quot; of 19th century Norwegian literature.

==Background==
Jonas Lie was born at Hokksund in Øvre Eiker, in the county of Buskerud, Norway. His parents were Pauline Christine Tiller (1799–1877) and Mons Lie (1803–81). Five years after Jonas&#x27;s birth, his father was appointed sheriff of Tromsø, which lies within the Arctic Circle, and young Jonas Lie spent six of the most impressionable years of his life at that remote port.

He was sent to the naval school at Fredriksværn; but his defective eyesight caused him to give up a life at sea. He transferred to the Bergen Cathedral School (&quot;Bergen katedralskole&quot;) in Bergen, and in 1851 entered the University of Christiania, where he made the acquaintance of Ibsen and Bjørnson. He graduated in law in 1857, and shortly afterwards began to practice at Kongsvinger, a town located between Lake Mjøsa and the border with Sweden.

==Career==
Clients were not numerous at Kongsvinger and Lie found time to write for the newspapers and became a frequent contributor to some of the Christiania journals. His first work was a volume of poems which appeared in 1866 and was not successful. During the four following years he devoted himself almost exclusively to journalism, working hard and without much reward, but acquiring the pen of a ready writer and obtaining command of a style which has proved serviceable in his subsequent career.

Between 1863 and 1864 Lie edited a magazine &quot;Illustreret Nyhedsblad&quot;. In 1870 he published &quot;Den Fremsynte&quot;, a powerful tale of the sea and superstitions centering on Northern Norway. In the following year he revisited Nordland and traveled into Finnmark.

Starting from 1874, the Norwegian Parliament had granted him an artist salary. Having obtained this small pension from the Government, he sought the greatest contrast he could find in Europe to the scenes of his childhood and started for Rome. For a time he lived in North Germany, then he moved to Bavaria, spending his winters in Paris. In 1882 he visited Norway for a time, but returned to the continent of Europe. His voluntary exile from his native land ended in the spring of 1893, when he settled at Holskogen, near Kristiansand. His works were numerous after that.

==Works==
In his works, Jonas Lie often sought to reflect in his writings the nature, folk life, and social spirit of the nation of Norway. His writing often dealt with family life in diverse settings, including portraying the social and intellectual restrictions on women of the educated classes. Lie was a versatile writer, liberal and modern, but also strongly tradition bound.

Among Lie&#x27;s finest works must be considered &quot;Familien paa Gilje&quot; (1883) which was a striking document of the life of an officer&#x27;s family, and the few options given to the daughters of such families.

His two collections of short stories called &quot;Trold&quot; involve the superstitions of the fishermen and coast commoners of northern Norway. The much anthologized short story &quot;Elias and the Draugh&quot; was included in a collection originally published by Gyldendal Norsk Forlag, and was reprinted by Roald Dahl in &quot;Roald Dahl&#x27;s Book of Ghost Stories&quot; (1983).

==Personal life==
In 1860, he married his cousin Thomasine Henriette Lie (1833–1907). The couple had five children. Two died young; the others were diplomat Michael Strøm Lie (1862–1934) and writers Mons Lie (1864–1931) and Erik Røring Møinichen Lie (1869–1943). Jonas Lie was the uncle of the author Bernt Lie (1868–1916). Henriette Thomasine Lie was the aunt of Jonas Lie, the Norwegian-born American painter. His grandson, also named Jonas Lie, served as the Minister of Police under Norway&#x27;s collaborationist Quisling government.

Jonas Lie died at Fleskum at Sandvika in 1908, less than a year after Thomasine&#x27;s death.

==Legacy==
In 1904, the King of Norway awarded Lie the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav.

<text>Gihon is the name of the second river mentioned in the second chapter of the biblical Book of Genesis. The Gihon is mentioned as one of four rivers (along with the Tigris, Euphrates, and Pishon) issuing out of Eden, branching from a single river that split after watering the Garden of Eden (Genesis 2:10-14).

==Overview==
The name (Hebrew &quot;Gīḥōn&quot; גיחון) may be interpreted as &quot;bursting forth, gushing&quot;.

The book of Genesis describes Gihon as &quot;encircling the entire land of Cush&quot;, a name associated with Ethiopia elsewhere in the Bible. This is the reason that Ethiopians have long identified the Gihon (&quot;Giyon&quot;) with the Abay River (Blue Nile), which encircles the former kingdom of Gojjam. From a geographic standpoint this would seem impossible, since two of the other rivers said to issue out of Eden, the Tigris and the Euphrates, are in Mesopotamia. However, the scholar Edward Ullendorff has argued in support of this identification. In the Fra Mauro map of 1459, the Nile is called &quot;Gion&quot;, giving more credence to this claim.

Some scholars identify Cush in this context as the ancient Kassite kingdom, which encompassed a Mesopotamian area that is repeatedly flooded by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This view has some support from Herodotus, who thought there were both an African Ethiopia (Cush) and a northern (Asiatic) Ethiopia.

Nineteenth century, modern, and Arabic scholars have sought to identify the &quot;land of Cush&quot; with Hindu Kush, and Gihon with Amu Darya (Jihon/Jayhon of the Islamic texts). Amu Darya was known in the medieval Islamic writers as Jayhun or Ceyhun in Turkish. This was a derivative of Jihon, or Zhihon as it is still known by the Persians.

First-century Jewish historian Josephus associated the Gihon river with the Nile.

Gihon (or Pishon) has also been associated with the Araxes (modern Aras) river which flows through Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran, or with the river Oxus (the Amu Darya).

Juris Zarins identified the Gihon with the Karun River in Iran and Kush with the land of the Kassites.

The Sefer haYashar, a medieval Hebrew midrash, asserts that in the time of Enos, grandson of Adam, the river Gihon was subject to a catastrophic flood due to the wickedness of man.

<text>Kardzhali Province () is a province of southern Bulgaria, neighbouring Greece with the Greek regional units of Xanthi, Rhodope, and Evros to the south and east. It is 3209.1 km2 in area. Its main city is Kardzhali. It is Bulgaria&#x27;s southernmost province.

==History==
The territory of Kardzhali province was acquired by Bulgaria during the First Balkan War in 1912. In 1913 the region was organized as the district (окръг, &quot;okrăg&quot; in Bulgarian) of Mestanli. This district was part of Stara Zagora province from 1934 until 1949, then it was transferred to the newly formed Haskovo district. In 1959, Kardzhali became the center of a new district with similar borders to the current province. Between 1987 and 1999, the region was part of Haskovo Province, after which it was restored, now as a province and with slightly changed borders.

==Municipalities==

The Kardzhali province (област, &quot;oblast&quot;) contains seven municipalities (singular: община, &quot;obština&quot;; plural: общини, &quot;obštini&quot;). The following table shows the names of each municipality in English and Cyrillic, the main town (in bold) or village, and the population as of 2009.

==Towns and villages==

The population data and figures are of December 15, 2004
* Abramovo (pop: 94)
* Ahrisko (pop: 127, elev: 680 m, postal code: 6761)

==Demographics==
Kardzhali Province had a population of 149,661 according to the provisional results of the 2011 census, of which were male and were female. Kardzhali is one of the three Bulgarian provinces where less than fifty percent of the population is living in urban areas: only 41% lives in urban areas in 2016. 

===Ethnic groups===

<doc id="589015" wikidata="Q3520719" url="?curid=589015" title="United States and weapons of mass destruction">
<text>The United States is known to have possessed three types of weapons of mass destruction: nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. As the country that invented nuclear weapons, the U.S. is the only country to have used nuclear weapons on another country, when it detonated two atomic bombs over two Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. It had secretly developed the earliest form of the atomic weapon during the 1940s under the title &quot;Manhattan Project&quot;. The United States pioneered the development of both the nuclear fission and hydrogen bombs (the latter involving nuclear fusion). It was the world&#x27;s first and only nuclear power for four years, from 1945 until 1949, when the Soviet Union produced its own nuclear weapon. The United States has the second-largest number of nuclear weapons in the world, after the Russian Federation (the successor state to the Soviet Union).

==Nuclear weapons==
Nuclear weapons have been used twice in combat: two nuclear weapons were used by the United States against Japan during World War II in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Altogether, the two bombings killed 105,000 people and injured thousands more while devastating hundreds or thousands of military bases, factories, and cottage industries.

The U.S. conducted an extensive nuclear testing program. 1054 tests were conducted between 1945 and 1992. The exact number of nuclear devices detonated is unclear because some tests involved multiple devices while a few failed to explode or were designed not to create a nuclear explosion. The last nuclear test by the United States was on September 23, 1992; the U.S. has signed but not ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.

Currently, the United States nuclear arsenal is deployed in three areas:
:* Land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs;
:* Sea-based, nuclear submarine-launched ballistic missiles, or SLBMs; and
:* Air-based nuclear weapons of the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s heavy bomber group

The United States is one of the five &quot;Nuclear Weapons States&quot; under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which the U.S. ratified in 1968. On October 13, 1999, the U.S. Senate rejected ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, having previously ratified the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963. The U.S. has not, however, tested a nuclear weapon since 1992, though it has tested many non-nuclear components and has developed powerful supercomputers to duplicate the knowledge gained from testing without conducting the actual tests themselves.

In the early 1990s, the U.S. stopped developing new nuclear weapons and now devotes most of its nuclear efforts into stockpile stewardship, maintaining and dismantling its now-aging arsenal. The administration of George W. Bush decided in 2003 to engage in research towards a new generation of small nuclear weapons, especially &quot;earth penetrators&quot;. The budget passed by the United States Congress in 2004 eliminated funding for some of this research including the &quot;bunker-busting or earth-penetrating&quot; weapons.

The exact number of nuclear weapons possessed by the United States is difficult to determine. Different treaties and organizations have different criteria for reporting nuclear weapons, especially those held in reserve, and those being dismantled or rebuilt:
:* In its Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) declaration for 2003, the U.S. listed 5968 deployed warheads as defined by START rules.
:* The exact number as of September 30, 2009, was 5,113 warheads, according to a U.S. fact sheet released May 3, 2010.

In 2002, the United States and Russia agreed in the SORT treaty to reduce their deployed stockpiles to not more than 2,200 warheads each. In 2003, the U.S. rejected Russian proposals to further reduce both nation&#x27;s nuclear stockpiles to 1,500 each. In 2007, for the first time in 15 years, the United States built new warheads. These replaced some older warheads as part of the Minuteman III upgrade program. 2007 also saw the first Minuteman III missiles removed from service as part of the drawdown. Overall, stockpiles and deployment systems continue to decline in number under the terms of the New START treaty.

In 2014, &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; released a report, stating that there are a total of 2,530 warheads kept in reserve, and 2,120 actively deployed. Of the warheads actively deployed, the number of strategic warheads rests at 1,920 (subtracting 200 tactical B61s as part of Nato nuclear weapon sharing arrangements). The amount of warheads being actively disabled rests at about 2,700 warheads, which brings the total United States inventory to about 7,400 warheads.

The U.S. government decided not to sign the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a binding agreement for negotiations for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, supported by more than 120 nations.

As of early 2019, more than 90% of world&#x27;s 13,865 nuclear weapons were owned by the United States and Russia. Russia has the most nuclear warheads sitting at 5,977, while the United States has 5,428 warheads.

===Land-based ICBMs===

The U.S. Air Force currently operates 400 Minuteman III ICBMs, located primarily in the northern Rocky Mountain states and the Dakotas. Peacekeeper missiles were phased out of the Air Force inventory in 2005. All USAF Minuteman II missiles were destroyed in accordance with the START treaty and their launch silos imploded and buried then sold to the public under the START II. The U.S. goal under the SORT treaty was to reduce from 1,600 warheads deployed on over 500 missiles in 2003 to 500 warheads on 450 missiles in 2012. The first Minuteman III were removed under this plan in 2007 while, at the same time, the warheads deployed on Minuteman IIIs began to be upgraded from smaller W62s to larger W87s from decommissioned Peacekeeper missiles.

===Air-based delivery systems===

The U.S. Air Force also operates a strategic nuclear bomber fleet. The bomber force consists of 51 nuclear-armed B-52 Stratofortresses, and 20 B-2 Spirits. All 64 B-1s were retrofitted to operate in a solely conventional mode by 2007 and thus don&#x27;t count as nuclear platforms.

In addition to this, the U.S. military can also deploy smaller tactical nuclear weapons either through cruise missiles or with conventional fighter-bombers. The U.S. maintains about 400 nuclear gravity bombs capable of use by the F/A-18 Hornet, F-15E, F-16, F-22 and F-35. Some 350 of these bombs are deployed at seven airbases in six European NATO countries; of these, 180 tactical B61 nuclear bombs fall under a nuclear sharing arrangement.
===Submarine-based ballistic missiles===

The U.S. Navy currently has 18 s deployed, of which 14 are ballistic missile submarines. Each submarine is equipped with a maximum complement of 24 Trident II missiles. Approximately 12 U.S. attack submarines were equipped to launch nuclear Tomahawk missiles, but these weapons were removed from service by 2013.

The number of Deployed and Non-Deployed SLBMs on the Ohio-Class SSBNs is 280, of which 203 SLBMs are deployed.

==Biological weapons==

The United States offensive biological weapons program was instigated by President Franklin Roosevelt and the U.S. Secretary of War in October 1941. Research occurred at several sites. A production facility was built at Terre Haute, Indiana, but testing with a benign agent demonstrated contamination of the facility so no production occurred during World War II.

The US government and military is known for using civilian populations to test the effects of bioweapons. In 1950, the US Navy conducted a secret experiment on the civilian population of the San Francisco Bay Area during operation Operation Sea-Spray, in which over 800,000 residents were unknowingly sprayed with pathogens. This led to at least one death and claims that the ecology had been changed irreversibly.

In 1951, the US military also released fungal spores at the Norfolk Naval Supply Center on African-American workers to see if they are more susceptible to the pathogen than Caucasians. In 1966, the US government released Bacillus globigii on the New York Subway to research how a civilian population can be used to spread pathogens. It is claimed many of those exposed were later found to exhibit long-term medical conditions of which the military has denied causation.

The US government continued similar experiments on civilian populations in other cities across the country until the early 1970s.

The Dugway Proving Ground facility in Utah, opened in 1942, to this day tests and stores biological weapons. In 1968, the facility infamously poisoned 6,000 sheep with the nerve agent VX. The 800,000 acre facility has reportedly weaponized fleas, mosquitoes, as well as conducted experiments on both animal and human subjects.

A more advanced production facility was constructed in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, which began producing biological agents in 1954. Fort Detrick, Maryland, later became a production facility as well as a research site. The U.S. developed anti-personnel and anti-crop biological weapons. Several deployment systems were developed including aerial spray tanks, aerosol spray canisters, grenades, rocket warheads and cluster bombs. (See also U.S. Biological Weapon Testing)

In mid-1969, the UK and the Warsaw Pact, separately, introduced proposals to the UN to ban biological weapons, which would lead to a treaty in 1972. The U.S. cancelled its offensive biological weapons program by executive order in November 1969 (microorganisms) and February 1970 (toxins) and ordered the destruction of all offensive biological weapons, which occurred between May 1971 and February 1973. The U.S. ratified the Geneva Protocol on January 22, 1975. The U.S. ratified the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) which came into effect in March 1975.

Negotiations for a legally binding verification protocol to the BWC proceeded for years. In 2001, negotiations ended when the Bush administration rejected an effort by other signatories to create a protocol for verification, arguing that it could be abused to interfere with legitimate biological research.

The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, located in Fort Detrick, produces small quantities of biological agents, for use in biological weapons defense research. According to the U.S. government, this research is performed in full accordance with the BWC.

In September 2001, shortly after the September 11 attacks on the United States, there was a series of anthrax attacks aimed at U.S. media offices and the U.S. Senate which killed five people. The anthrax used in the attacks was the Ames strain, which was first studied at Fort Detrick and then distributed to other labs around the world.
==Chemical weapons==
In World War I, the U.S. had its own chemical weapons program, which produced its own chemical munitions, including phosgene and mustard gas. The U.S. only created about 4% of the total chemical weapons produced for that war and just over 1% of the era&#x27;s most effective weapon, mustard gas. (U.S. troops suffered less than 6% of gas casualties.) Although the U.S. had begun a large-scale production of Lewisite, for use in an offensive planned for early 1919, Lewisite was not deployed during World War I. The United States also created a special unit, the 1st Gas Regiment, which used phosgene in attacks after being deployed to France.

Chemical weapons were not used by the Allies or Germany during World War II for military purposes, but such weapons were deployed to Europe from the United States. In 1943, German bombers attacked the port of Bari in Southern Italy, sinking several American ships – among them &quot;John Harvey&quot;, which was carrying mustard gas. The presence of the gas was highly classified, and, according to the U.S. military account, &quot;Sixty-nine deaths were attributed in whole or in part to the mustard gas, most of them American merchant seamen&quot; out of 628 mustard gas military casualties. The affair was kept secret at the time and for many years. After the war, the U.S. both participated in arms control talks involving chemical weapons and continued to stockpile them, eventually exceeding 30,000 tons of material.

After the war, all of the former Allies pursued further research on the three new nerve agents developed by the Nazis: tabun, sarin, and soman. Over the following decades, thousands of American military volunteers were exposed to chemical agents during Cold War testing programs, as well as in accidents. (In 1968, one such accident killed approximately 6,400 sheep when an agent drifted out of Dugway Proving Ground during a test.) The U.S. also investigated a wide range of possible nonlethal, psychobehavioral chemical incapacitating agents including psychedelic indoles such as LSD and marijuana derivatives, as well as several glycolate anticholinergics. One of the anticholinergic compounds, 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, was assigned the NATO code BZ and was weaponized at the beginning of the 1960s for possible battlefield use. Alleged use of chemical agents by the U.S. in the Korean (1950–53) conflict has never been substantiated.

In late 1969, President Richard Nixon unilaterally renounced the first use of chemical weapons (as well as all methods of biological warfare). He issued a unilateral decree halting production and transport of chemical weapons which remains in effect. From 1967 to 1970 in Operation CHASE, the U.S. disposed of chemical weapons by sinking ships laden with the weapons in the deep Atlantic. The U.S. began to research safer disposal methods for chemical weapons in the 1970s, destroying several thousand tons of mustard gas by incineration and nearly 4,200 tons of nerve agent by chemical neutralization.

The U.S. entered the Geneva Protocol in 1975 (the same time it ratified the Biological Weapons Convention). This was the first operative international treaty on chemical weapons to which the U.S. was party. Stockpile reductions began in the 1980s, with the removal of some outdated munitions and destruction of the entire stock of BZ beginning in 1988. In 1990, destruction of chemical agents stored on Johnston Atoll in the Pacific began, seven years before the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) came into effect. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan began removal of the U.S. stockpile of chemical weapons from Germany (see Operation Steel Box).
In 1991, President George H. W. Bush unilaterally committed the U.S. to destroying all chemical weapons and renounced the right to chemical weapon retaliation.

In 1993, the U.S. signed the CWC, which required the destruction of all chemical weapon agents, dispersal systems, chemical weapons production facilities by 2012. Both Russia and U.S. missed the CWC&#x27;s extended deadline of April 2012 to destroy all of their chemical weapons. The United States destroyed 89.75% of the original stockpile of nearly 31,100 metric tons (30,609 long tons) of nerve and mustard agents under the terms of the treaty. Chemical weapons destruction resumed in 2015. The country&#x27;s last stockpile was at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky. The U.S. destroyed its final chemical weapon on July 7, 2023. The final weapon to be destroyed was a sarin nerve agent-filled M55 rocket. The total cost for the program to destroy chemical weapons was $40 billion.

<text>Kyustendil Province (, trl &quot;Oblast Kyustendil&quot;) is a province in southwestern Bulgaria, extending over an area of (constituting 2.7% of the total territory of the Republic of Bulgaria), and with a population of 107,673. It borders the provinces of Sofia, Pernik, and Blagoevgrad; to the west, its limits coincide with the state borders between Bulgaria and North Macedonia, and between Bulgaria and the Republic of Serbia. The administrative center of the Province is Kyustendil.

==Geography==
The region features diverse surface relief—fertile valleys and canyons, separated by hillocks and mountains. The northern and western parts of the territory form the so-called &quot;Kyustendilsko kraishte&quot; (Kyustendil Cornerland) and include parts of the cross-border Milevska, Chudinska, Zemenska and—to the east—Konyavska mountains. To the south, the Kyustendilsko kraishte reaches as far as the valleys of the Dragovishtitsa and Bistritsa rivers, as well as the Lisets mountain. The southern part of the region includes massifs of the Osogovo, Vlahina and northwestern Rila mountains, embracing the Kamenitsa, Kyustendil and Dupnitsa lowerlands.

The region is divided in two under-districts: Kyustendil in west and Dupnitsa in east. In Dupnitsa region there are the geographic areas of Gorno pole (Upper field), Dolno pole (Lower field), and the area Razmetanitsa where the Emperor Samuil of Bulgaria killed his brother Aron and his family.

The region abounds with granites, clays, fossils, and ores. Polymetal ores are excavated in Osogovo; brown coals in the Bobov dol mines. Clays deposits are located at the villages of Chetirtsi, Yahinovo and Dragovishtitsa. The region, however, is most famous for its numerous mineral water springs: hot mineral water springs in Kyustendil, Sapareva banya, the villages of Nevestino and Chetirtsi. A marvel of nature, found in the region are the Stobski piramidi (Stob pyramids).

For the most part, the climate is transcontinental, but at higher altitudes it is mountainous. The main drainage river is Struma whose subsidiaries are the Treklyanska, Dragovishtitsa, Bistritsa, Slokoshtitsa, Novoselska, Dzherman and Rila rivers. Subterranean water levels are relatively high. Near the village of Kamenichka Skakavitsa, the Golemi dol river forms a 70-meter-high waterfall. The Dyakovo, Bersin, Drenov dol and Bagrentsi artificial lakes (dams) are chiefly used for irrigation purposes. Soil composition is most favorable for the traditionally developed fruit-growing.

Forest vegetation is mostly deciduous, although coniferous forests are present. The Gabra natural reservation (area: 89,5 metric hektares) houses the last remaining black-pine trees.

==Administration==

The region of Kyustendil includes nine municipalities with 182 settlements. The regional administrative center is the town of Kyustendil situated in its southwestern part: the Kyustendil lowerland. The town serves as the administrative center of the municipality of Kyustendil (with an area of , this municipality represents 30,2% of the total territory of the Region), with a population of 73 346, of whom 51 300 are residents of the town area. Four main transport routes pass through Kyustendil: from North Macedonia on the Skopie-Sofia high-way; from Serbia on the Niš-Bosilegrad-Kyustendil highway; through Dupnitsa and Kyustendil passes the oldest commercial road that for centuries has linked Constantinople and the Adriatic Sea. Kyustendil has managed to preserve is historical, ecological and cultural heritage. It is a contemporary Bulgarian administrative center, whose future is mostly seen in the development of cultural tourism, and modern rehabilitation resort centers by the hot mineral water springs.

The surrounding region is like an untapped national park. Wander through green lanes past medieval houses and barns and discover stunning landscapes. Plenty of fishing, walking, trekking, 4*4 country, hunting, with clear air and a fantastic climate.

<text>The Eighty Years&#x27; War or Dutch Revolt (; 1566/1568–1648) was an armed conflict in the Habsburg Netherlands between disparate groups of rebels and the Spanish government. The causes of the war included the Reformation, centralisation, excessive taxation, and the rights and privileges of the Dutch nobility and cities.

After the initial stages, Philip II of Spain, the sovereign of the Netherlands, deployed his armies and regained control over most of the rebel-held territories. However, widespread mutinies in the Spanish army caused a general uprising. Under the leadership of the exiled William the Silent, the Catholic and Protestant-dominated provinces sought to establish religious peace while jointly opposing the king&#x27;s regime with the Pacification of Ghent, but the general rebellion failed to sustain itself.

Despite Governor of Spanish Netherlands and General for Spain, the Duke of Parma&#x27;s steady military and diplomatic successes, the Union of Utrecht continued their resistance, proclaiming their independence through the 1581 Act of Abjuration and establishing the Calvinist-dominated Dutch Republic in 1588. In the Ten Years thereafter, the Republic (whose heartland was no longer threatened) made conquests in the north and east and received diplomatic recognition from France and England in 1596. The Dutch colonial empire emerged, which began with Dutch attacks on Portugal&#x27;s overseas territories.

Facing a stalemate, the two sides agreed to a Twelve Years&#x27; Truce in 1609; when it expired in 1621, fighting resumed as part of the broader Thirty Years&#x27; War. An end was reached in 1648 with the Peace of Münster (a treaty that was part of the Peace of Westphalia), when Spain retained the Southern Netherlands and recognised the Dutch Republic as an independent country.

==Twelve Years&#x27; Truce (1609–1621)==

The military upkeep and decreased trade had put both Spain and the Dutch Republic under financial strain. To alleviate conditions, a ceasefire was signed in Antwerp on 9 April 1609, marking the end of the Dutch Revolt and the beginning of the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce. The conclusion of this Truce was a major diplomatic coup for Holland&#x27;s advocate Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, as Spain by concluding the Treaty, formally recognised the independence of the Republic. In Spain the truce was seen as a major humiliationshe had suffered a political, military and ideological defeat, and the affront to its prestige was immense. The closure of the river Scheldt to traffic in and out of Antwerp, and the acceptance of Dutch commercial operations in the Spanish and Portuguese colonial maritime lanes were just a few points that the Spanish found objectionable.

Although there was peace on an international level, political unrest took hold of Dutch domestic affairs. What had started as a theological quarrel resulted in riots between Remonstrants (Arminians) and Counter-Remonstrants (Gomarists). In general, regents would support the former and civilians the latter. Even the government got involved, with Oldenbarnevelt taking the side of the Remonstrants and stadtholder Maurice of Nassau their opponents. In the end, the Synod of Dort condemned the Remonstrants for heresy and excommunicated them from the national Public Church. Van Oldenbarnevelt was sentenced to death, together with his ally Gilles van Ledenberg, while two other Remonstrant allies, Rombout Hogerbeets and Hugo Grotius received life imprisonment.

==Final phase of the war (1621–1648)==
==Peace of Münster==


The negotiations between Spain and the Republic formally started in January 1646 as part of the more general peace negotiations between the warring parties in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The States General sent eight delegates from several of the provinces as none trusted the others to represent them adequately. They were Willem van Ripperda (Overijssel), Frans van Donia (Friesland), Adriaen Clant tot Stedum (Groningen), Adriaan Pauw and Jan van Mathenesse (Holland), Barthold van Gent (Gelderland), Johan de Knuyt (Zeeland) and Godert van Reede (Utrecht). The Spanish delegation was led by Gaspar de Bracamonte, 3rd Count of Peñaranda. The negotiations were held in what is now the Haus der Niederlande in Münster.

The Dutch and Spanish delegations soon reached an agreement, based on the text of the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce. It therefore confirmed Spain&#x27;s recognition of Dutch independence. The Dutch demands (closure of the Scheldt, cession of the Meierij, formal cession of Dutch conquests in the Indies and Americas, and lifting of the Spanish embargoes) were generally met. However, the general negotiations between the main parties dragged on, because France kept formulating new demands. Eventually it was decided therefore to split off the peace between the Republic and Spain from the general peace negotiations. This enabled the two parties to conclude what technically was a separate peace (to the annoyance of France, which maintained that this contravened the alliance treaty of 1635 with the Republic).

The text of the Treaty (in 79 articles) was fixed on 30 January 1648. It was then sent to the principals (King Philip IV of Spain and the States General) for ratification. Five provinces voted to ratify (against the advice of stadtholder William) on 4 April (Zeeland and Utrecht being opposed). Utrecht finally yielded to pressure by the other provinces, but Zeeland held out and refused to sign. It was eventually decided to ratify the peace without Zeeland&#x27;s consent. The delegates to the peace conference affirmed the peace on oath on 15 May 1648 (though the delegate of Zeeland refused to attend, and the delegate of Utrecht suffered a possibly diplomatic illness).

In the broader context of the treaties between France and the Holy Roman Empire, and Sweden and the Holy Roman Empire of 14 and 24 October 1648, which comprise the Peace of Westphalia, but which were not signed by the Republic, the Republic now also gained formal &quot;independence&quot; from the Holy Roman Empire, just like the Swiss Cantons. In both cases this was just a formalisation of a situation that had already existed for a long time. France and Spain did not conclude a treaty and so remained at war until the peace of the Pyrenees of 1659. The peace was celebrated in the Republic with sumptuous festivities. It was solemnly promulgated on the 80th anniversary of the execution of the Counts of Egmont and Horne on 5 June 1648.

<text>The Volkswagen Santana is a nameplate used by Volkswagen for various sedans and station wagons since 1983. The first generation is based on the second-generation Volkswagen Passat (B2). It was introduced in 1981 while production started in 1983 for China. The use of the &quot;Santana&quot; badge rather than &quot;Passat&quot; echoes the use of different names for the sedan versions of the Polo (Derby) and Golf (Jetta).

In North America, it was also known as the Volkswagen Quantum. In Mexico, it was named the Volkswagen Corsar, while in Argentina it was sold as the Volkswagen Carat. In Brazil and other South American countries it was known as the Santana, while the Passat Variant B2 wagon was marketed as the Quantum. In Europe, the Santana name was dropped in 1985 (with the exception of Spain, where the Santana nameplate was retained) and the car was sold as a Passat. European test production ended in 1988 while Latin American production continued until 2006. Chinese production of the three box sedan continued until January 2013.

The final Chinese versions were named Santana Vista, and the name Santana was used on a new 2013 model, slightly smaller and based on the Škoda Rapid and SEAT Toledo.


== Santana (Europe; 1981–1984) ==

The Volkswagen Santana was originally sold in Europe as a four-door sedan based on the Volkswagen Passat B2 from 1981 to 1984. In Europe the Santana was marketed towards the upper middle class. It was only available as a four-door sedan, although Volkswagen did build five two-door, pre-series sedans in 1981.

The name &quot;Santana&quot; was derived from the Santa Ana winds. The Santana was also technically identical to the Passat while being positioned more upmarket, consisting of higher quality equipment and better interior materials. Distinguishing features from the Passat included a unique radiator grill with white indicator lenses right next to the headlight and more chrome decoration.

Volkswagen wanted to position the Santana higher than the Passat, but it was also cautious of the fact that it could possibly cannibalize sales of the Audi 80 B2. The Santana faced competition in its home market from the likes of the upmarket Audi 80, BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz 190 while also competing with mainstream competitors such as the Opel Ascona. The Audi 80 and the VW Santana were marketed through a joint sales channel, and as a result sales remained below Volkswagen&#x27;s expectations.

From January 1985, the Santana name was dropped in Europe except in Spain, but the car continued to be kept on sale through a facelift and was henceforth known as the Passat notchback until the Passat B2&#x27;s discontinuation in 1988.

In the first year of sales, The Santana was only offered in the higher-quality CL and GL versions. To emphasize the model&#x27;s independence, these were changed to LX and GX from August 1982 onwards and from 1984 a more basic CX version was also introduced. The GX5 was the top of the range and came with alloy wheels, leather upholstery, deep pile carpet and central locking as standard as well as a sporty 1.9 inline five engine from the Audi Coupe. This engine was upgraded to a 2.0 litre in the last year of production (1984).

The range of engines on the Santana was similar to the Passat, 1.3 petrol, 1.6 petrol, 1.8 petrol which were all inline-four with a top of the range 1.9-litre petrol straight-five which was upgraded to a 2.0-litre unit in 1984. Diesels were also offered in Europe, a naturally aspirated diesel producing 54 horsepower and a turbocharged diesel producing 70 horsepower. Both diesels have a capacity of 1.6 litres.

Due to rising fuel prices, Volkswagen began introducing the &quot;Formel E&quot; models in the early 1980s. These models featured minor aerodynamic improvements and had longer gear ratios. A Formel E feature only found in the Passat and the Santana was a start-stop system which allowed the driver to push a button to switch off the engine. The engine was then started automatically when first gear was engaged. From September 1984 catalytic converters were also introduced on the Santana and on request, lambda control could also be ordered on fuel injected petrol engines.

In total, 198,505 examples were produced in Europe, with 174,900 petrol examples and 23,600 diesel examples made.

== Santana (China; 1983–2022) ==
=== First generation (B2; 1983) ===

The Santana&#x27;s biggest success was in China. The Santana (B2) had been built in China on a small scale trial basis by the &quot;Shanghai Tractor Automobile Corporation&quot; (STAC), predecessor of the SAIC Motor, since 1982. The first 100 cars were built from CKD kits delivered from Germany. The first Volkswagen Santana was assembled in April 1983 by a team from Shanghai Auto. Volkswagen signed a contract with STAC, along with the &quot;China National Automotive Industry Corporation&quot; (CNAIC) and the &quot;Bank of China&quot; to form the Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive joint venture in October 1984. Production commenced in September 1985 while the first assembly line of the Santana started a month later. In September 1986, the 10,000th Santana was built in China. The car and venture laid the ground-works for China&#x27;s mass motorization. The drive to fully localize production became the impetus for the Chinese auto parts industry: In 1986, the quota of made-in-China parts was below six percent. In 1995, the local content quota stood at 89 percent. The last Santana was assembled on January 15 2013.

Initially launched with a 1.6-litre petrol engine, the Santana was updated with a 1.8-litre petrol in 1987, first available in the Santana Variant station wagon introduced by Shanghai in April 1992. The first Santanas were all originally equipped with a four-speed manual transmission. This vehicle was very popular as a taxicab, having been in service dating back to 1987, along with policecars and other government services. 
The Santana has had a number of updated features added since the original 1983 model. Some updated features the Santana has been include with are Bosch electronic fuel injection system, a 5-speed manual, a third brake light, improved back seats, hydraulic clutch, MP3 and CD compatible radios, ABS brakes with electronic brake distribution.

===Second generation (2000; 1995)===


In 1991 the Santana 2000 was put into development for China with the aid of Volkswagen do Brasil. It was introduced in 1994 and started mass production in April 1995 with a longer wheelbase and rear doors than its Brazilian counterpart.
===Facelift (3000; 2004)===


On March 2 2004, Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive introduced a heavily facelifted Santana 2000, the Santana 3000. It was the first design that the Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive joint venture designers had undertaken by themselves. The Santana 3000 was also the first in the Chinese developed Santana series to be available with optional ABS brakes with electronic brake distribution, electronic differential system, a multi function display system, and a sunroof designed by the German Webasto company. The 2.0-litre engine was added to the range in June 2006.
===Second facelift (Vista; 2008)===


On January 6 2008, Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive released the Santana Vista (Zhijun) and Santana Vista (Changda) (Taxi model), featuring front and rear visual updates and minor chassis modifications. The passenger version of the Vista can be recognized by its mesh grille, chrome accents located low on the bumpers, and redesigned taillights with circular elements whereas the taxi version had a razor blade-like grille, same taillights like the Santana 3000 and new wheels.

 the original German designed Santana (both sedan and Variant versions) was still sold in China alongside the updated Santana Vista, which were popular with taxi and police fleets, as well as with private buyers. A 1.6-litre version of the Santana Vista (1,595 cc, ) has been added to the bottom of the lineup to further boost sales. There were 3,213,710 units made since CKD production began in 1983 up until May 2009. Nonetheless, Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive decided to discontinue the Santana in 2012. Production continued in China with the Santana sedan and Gran Santana hatchback until 2022. The classic Santana Vista taxi was phased out in October 2018 in favour of 100 new electric cabs for Shanghai&#x27;s taxi fleet as well as the Volkswagen Touran, which offered greater comfort for passengers.

=== Third generation (A05; 2012) ===
On October 29, 2012, the new Santana was introduced in Wolfsburg, Germany as a subcompact B-segment car. It was built to fulfill the Chinese market demand. The new Santana is built in Anting and Ürümqi in China and its basis uses the Volkswagen Group A05+ platform, sharing the same platform as the Volkswagen New Jetta, another Chinese built Volkswagen model.

The New Santana has been redesigned for more power and a sleeker design.

Production for the New Santana commenced in December 2012. A hatchback variant is known as the Gran Santana and had been sold after the facelift from June 2015. The Cross Santana was launched a year later.

In May 2018, the Santana - along with the Tiguan, Lavida, and Lamando - was launched in the Philippines as part of the new ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA).

Production ended in 2022.

== Santana (Japan; 1984–1989) ==

Aiming at a full partnership with Volkswagen, Nissan&#x27;s then President Takashi Ishihara decided that producing the Santana for the Japanese market would be a good stepping stone. Negotiations began in 1981, and by February 1984, Nissan begun knock-down kit production of the Santana at its Zama plant in Kanagawa, Japan. The Santana received the internal model code M30. The price of the Santana was considerably lower than of imported Volkswagens.

Nissan&#x27;s Santana was changed for Japan with a right hand drive wiper layout (parking on the passenger side) which, as well as a new linkage mechanism, also required a new bonnet pressing as there were recesses in the trailing edge for the wiper pivots. VW-built cars, in common with some of the maker&#x27;s other models at this time, such as the MKII Golf, had the same LHD wiper pattern regardless of steering wheel location. At introduction, the Santana was available with three different engines: A 1781 cc four (Li, Gi), a 1,994 cc five (Gi5, Xi5) and a 1,588 cc turbodiesel four (Lt, Gt Diesel Turbo). All came with a five-speed manual transmission as standard, while the gasoline engines were also available with a three-speed automatic. The Santana was 5 mm narrower than its German counterparts, so as to avoid a massive Japanese tax on cars wider than 1690 mm. Additionally, the grille and headlights were unique to the M30 Santana.

In May 1985 the Xi5 Autobahn version was added to the lineup, offering velour sports seats, electric sunroof and 14-inch alloy wheels. In January 1987 the Santana received a facelift, with a new fascia and new larger bumpers. The Turbodiesel was discontinued, leaving only gasoline-engined versions. The 1.8-litre Gi version was down to , while the Li and Gi5 equipment grades were dropped. The Xi5 Autobahn was now available with a new engine, however, as a DOHC version of the 2-litre five appeared with . With sales, originally aimed at 4,000-5,000 per month, only having reached 50,000 over seven years, Nissan ended production in October 1989. Sales of remaining stock continued until May 1990. Instead of renewing the production license, they began selling the new, third-generation Volkswagen Passat through their dealer network. As Volkswagen and Toyota began cooperating in 1991, sales of Volkswagens through Nissan dealers came to a halt.


==Santana (Brazil; 1984–2006)==

The Santana entered production in Brazil in June, 1984. It was originally sold as a 4-door and 2-door sedan, with the station wagon Santana Quantum (later simply Quantum) being launched in July 1985. The 2-door coupe was exclusive to Brazil.

The engine range consisted of two versions of the familiar 1.8-litre Volkswagen EA827 engine, running on ethanol or petrol. In May 1988 it gained the option of a 2.0-litre engine (petrol or ethanol). Thus equipped they were known as Santana/Quantum 2000. Transmissions included a 4-speed manual (for the first two years), 5-speed manual (first as an option but made standard in 1987), and for the top line CD (later GLS) a 3-speed automatic.
In 1991, Volkswagen do Brasil then engaged in a joint venture with Ford called AutoLatina, decided to retain the Passat (B2) shaped sedan and wagon instead of building the newer third-generation Passat (B3). Thorough changes to the bodyshell, boot line, front and rear guards, meant it looked considerably more modern than its predecessor, if not quite at par with the B3. Under the terms of AutoLatina, this &quot;new&quot; Santana was also marketed as the Ford Versailles in Brazil and as the Ford Galaxy in Argentina. The 3-door (later 5-door) station wagon was sold as the Ford Royale. 1991 also marked the introduction of ABS brakes and catalytic converters, both firsts for the Brazilian car industry.
It received a mild facelift for 1994, and another more extensive one in 1999. In 2002, the Quantum was taken out of production, and then, after more than two decades and years of dropping sales, the Santana was retired from the range in June 2006. It sold 548,494 units during its 22 year production run.
==Corsar (Mexico; 1984–1988)==

The Santana was launched to the Mexican car market in February 1984 as the all-new Corsar CD. Assembled at VW Mexico&#x27;s Puebla factory mostly with German-sourced components, for the brand it was intended to be the top-of-range offer for the domestic car market at the time, a mechanically reliable while slightly luxurious medium sedan. The 1.8-litre carbureted engine was the only drive choice for the whole Corsar lineup through its lifetime. It was definitely a high fuel-saving option toward its local medium-luxury competitors: Chrysler LeBaron &quot;K&quot;, Chevrolet Celebrity, Ford Grand Marquis, Renault 18.

In 1984 and 1985, the Corsar was marketed only as 4-door sedan, the same European Santana body (no Passat Variant body was offered here for those first years), matching the appearance of the US&#x27;s market version (badged there as VW Quantum). At the time, the Corsar and Quantum sedans shared the same front grille design, featuring four squared headlight units (two beams for the right and left sides with amber colored rectangular emergency indicators below each) rather than the Santana&#x27;s grille design.

Regarding equipment, only one trim level was available, which included: 13” alloy wheels, 185/70 tires, velour upholstery (gray or blue coloured starting in 1985), rear seat headrests, AM/FM stereo cassette Radio with 4 speakers, tachometer, power steering, anti-theft alarm. Air condition was available as an option, as well as 4-speed manual transmission or 3-speed automatic gearboxes. The following colours were available for 1984: Mars Red, Alpine White, Jade Green Metallic, Cosmos Silver Metallic and Graphite Metallic.

For 1986, the Corsar&#x27;s product range received several novelties, somewhat similar to the North-American Quantum line. First, the headlights and front grille design was updated to match the same featured by the correspondent European Passat line. New body colours and upholstery types were now offered, a new 5-speed manual gearbox replaced the previous 4-speed one. Some new features were now available as option equipment, mainly power door locks and windows and black leather upholstery. In March 1986, the Passat wagon body was now offered within the local lineup, being badged here as Corsar Variant (matching the European Passat Variant or Quantum Wagon, as known in United States and Brazil).

The 1987 and 1988 Corsar lineup remained mostly unchanged, just bringing out then that the alloy wheels where now offered as part of the option package, with a set of steel-made wheels wearing full covers being now the standard ones.

By mid-1988, a limited edition Corsar was released (both sedan and Variant version). It was distinguished for its Black and Silver double-tone paintwork, black leather upholstery and full equipment. Finally, by the end of 1988, the Corsar was discontinued from Volkswagen Mexico lineup, since production of its German counterpart -the Santana/Passat Mk2- stopped in Europe (where most of the matching parts came from, and rather started producing the next gen Passat Mk3). Also, the local assembly lines were needed by VW to increase the production run of the Mk2 Golf/Jetta for United States and Canada exports. In Mexico, the Corsar is still well remembered as a sleek design, good reputation vehicle.

==Carat (Argentina; 1987–1991)==
The Santana 4-door sedan started production in Argentina in June, 1987 as the Carat, manufactured by Volkswagen Argentina S.A. (San Justo/General Pacheco, Buenos Aires Province). No 2-door or estate versions were produced. Production ended in 1991.

<text>Sofia Province () is a province (&quot;oblast&quot;) of Bulgaria. The province does not include Sofia in its territories, but Sofia remains its administrative center. The province borders on the provinces of Pernik, Kyustendil, Blagoevgrad, Pazardzhik, Plovdiv, Lovech, Vratsa, Montana, and &quot;Sofia City Province&quot; (which is in a separate &quot;oblast&quot;, see Sofia Administration), and borders with Serbia to the northwest.

==History==

===Prehistory and antiquity===
Archaeological excavations near Chavdar suggest that the region has been settled by humans as early as 7,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of a mass settlement dates back to Thracian times, including &quot;tumuli&quot; (burial mounds) which remain poorly studied. According to Thucydides, the areas north of Vitosha were inhabited by the Tilataei and the Treri. The Triballi were also known to have inhabited the region around Serdica. The Serdi, a Celtic tribe that appeared in place of the vanished Treri and Tilataei, were first mentioned in 29 BC. Roman General Marcus Licinius Crassus began his campaign against the Triballi in that year, and in 27 BC his troops captured Serdica.

Felix Philipp Kanitz, the first person to study the Iskar Gorge area thoroughly, identified eight Roman &quot;castella&quot;, which he considered proof of the great strategic importance the Romans placed on the gorge. The road passing through it connected Roman lands from Thessaloniki all the way to Dacia. However, up until modern times, the gorge was poorly accessible because of its rugged terrain. As a result, the inhabitants were partially isolated from the rest of the world, self-reliant, but also safe from wars and invasions. Some of the population of Moesia thus found the Iskar river area an appealing safe haven later in the 5th century, when the province was threatened by Hunnic and Gothic raids (see also Collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476).

===Middle Ages===
Gothic assaults were followed by large-scale settlement of South Slavs in territories south of the Danube in the early 580s AD. The Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantium, was incapable of defending these territories at the time. With most Byzantine troops protecting the rich Asian provinces from Arab and Persian raids, even small and disorganised Slavic attacks caused much disruption throughout Moesia. The numerous Slavs gradually mixed with and assimilated the native population. The area remained under Byzantine control until 809 AD, when Krum captured Serdica and massacred some 6,000 soldiers and civilians. Sometime in the 10th century, construction of the Boyana Church began as well.

Churches and monasteries in the area flourished during the Second Bulgarian Empire. Tsar Ivan Alexander established a ring of 14 monasteries around Sredets (formerly Serdica), with rules and organisation similar to the monastery cluster on Mount Athos, known as &quot;Sveta Gora&quot; in Bulgarian. The &quot;Sveta Gora of Sofia&quot; includes temples and monasteries throughout today&#x27;s Sofia Province, spanning from Plana and Vitosha Mountains in the south to Dragoman and the slopes of Stara Planina in the north. Some of these were established during the First Bulgarian Empire or generally before Ivan Alexander&#x27;s rule. Apart from these monasteries, a number of other, smaller temples can be traced back to the Second Empire. This includes the Saint Nicholas church in Bukovets, built by Crusaders in the 12th century. 
Crusader presence was also attested around Bov, which is believed to have been established by an eponymous Fourth Crusade knight who became a vassal of Tsar Kaloyan.

===Ottoman rule===
The modern territory of Sofia Province has been part of three of the four revolutionary districts during the April Uprising 1876.

===Under the Third Bulgarian State===
A few years after Bulgaria&#x27;s liberation in 1878, Bulgarian nationalists organised a coup in the Ottoman province of Eastern Rumelia and declared its unification with the Principality of Bulgaria. The Kingdom of Serbia opposed the strengthening of its rival. Serbian king Milan I declared war on Bulgaria on 14 November 1885, but the Serbian forces were decisively defeated at the Battle of Slivnitsa between 17 and 19 November. Another decisive Bulgarian victory occurred at Gurgulyat, where Bulgarian soldiers and civilian volunteers fought the Serb Moravian division and prevented it from reinforcing the main Serbian force at Slivnitsa.

During World War II, a number of resistance fighters were based in the area. The mainly Soviet-oriented resistance - the People&#x27;s Liberation Rebel Army, PLRA - organised locally under the 1st Sofia Rebellion Operations Zone, particularly in the areas around Botevgrad and Ihtiman. Anti-partisan operations by the Bulgarian government military, then part of the Axis powers, had become fierce by 1944. In January 1944, Special Operations Executive Major William Frank Thompson and another British officer, Sergeant Kenneth Scott, were parachuted with radio equipment in southern Yugoslavia; their mission was to provide liaison between the British Army and the PLRA. The two joined a group of 100 ill-equipped Bulgarian partisans and entered Bulgaria in May 1944.

After some initial success, the group was ambushed, and Thompson was captured near Eleshnitsa along with a dozen Bulgarian partisans. After being shown the severed heads of other partisans on pikes, they were tortured by government troops and their paramilitary aides, the &quot;Gendarmerie&quot;. Because of his Communist sympathies and fluent Bulgarian and Russian, Thompson and the other resistance fighters were executed by a firing squad. Several villages in the area were merged after the war into what is now a single village, Thompson, named after the British officer.

==Geography==

 With a territory of 7 020 km², Sofia Province is the second-largest in Bulgaria. It also has the highest number of municipalities, 22, and borders nine other provinces as well as Serbia to the northwest. The lowest areas stand at 350 metres above sea level, whereas the highest rise above 2,900 metres, resulting in diverse terrain, soil and climatic factors.

A temperate climate with cold winters, cool springs and mild summers hampers the agricultural use of the otherwise fertile mountain valleys. Stara Planina, Sredna Gora and Rila are the principal mountain ranges that the province straddles, while Plana and Vitosha lie entirely within its territory. The highest peak on the Balkan Peninsula, Musala, rises 2,925 metres above sea level in Rila at the southern end of the province.

The precise height of Musala was only measured in 1932 by an expedition of the State Geographic Institute of the Ministry of War. Previously, Vihren in southwest Bulgaria was imprecisely measured and proclaimed to be the country&#x27;s highest peak. This made Mytikas on Mount Olympus in Greece, which rose only three metres higher than Vihren, the highest on the Balkan Peninsula. Locals in Bulgaria supposedly began piling up rocks on Vihren over time to restore its status, but the 1932 military expedition measured both Vihren and Musala with a margin of error of only 15 centimetres and thus put an end to the rivalry.

Rila is also the source of the Iskar, the longest river that runs entirely within Bulgarian territory. It is a tributary to the Danube and forms part of the Black Sea river basin. The long Cherni (black) Iskar is considered the main stem of the river, taking its source from the Chamovsko Lake (2,500 m) to the north-east of Damga Peak (2,669 m) and from there the river flows in north-eastern direction through the Govedartsi Valley, filled by the waters of the Chanakgyolski, Malyovishki and Urdini Lakes. The river enters the Balkan Mountains at the town of Novi Iskar and forms a long and spectacular gorge, whose slopes reach a height of 200 m up to 500 m at some points. The Iskar Gorge reaches a length of between its beginning at Kurilo, a neighbourhood of Novi Iskar, and the village of Lyutibrod where it ends. Other rivers flowing through the province
s territory are Topolnitsa, Nishava and Maritsa, and larger bodies of water include 60 barrages and dams.

==Demographics==
Sofia Province has 247,489 inhabitants according to the 2011 Bulgarian Census.

The Sofia province (Област, &quot;oblast&quot;) contains 22 municipalities (singular: община, &quot;obshtina&quot; - plural: Общини, &quot;obshtini&quot;). The following table shows the names of each municipality in English and Cyrillic, the main town (in bold) or village, and the population of each as of 2009.

The province had a population of 273 252 (also given as 273,240) according to a 2001 census, of which were male and were female.

==Economy==
Sofia Province&#x27;s Gross regional product (GRP) was 3.11 billion leva ($1.84 billion) in 2016, with a per capita value of 13,203 leva ($7810), the third-highest nationally. That year, some 9,000 companies produced 8.12 billion leva ($4.8 billion) worth of goods and services. Nearly two-thirds of businesses are in the processing sector and operate at a profit.

Mining has been developed on a large scale since the 1950s. The Chelopech copper mine opened in 1954 and has since produced 19.7 million tonnes of ore, peaking at 512,000 tonnes annually in 1988. In 1958, a copper smelter and refinery near Pirdop began operations and blended concentrates from Chelopech and two other mines in the area, Elatsite and Assarel. Since its privatisation in 1997, the smelter has become Bulgaria&#x27;s second-largest company as a subsidiary of Aurubis. Canadian company Dundee Precious Metals Inc. has acquired the Chelopech mine, where gold concentrate is currently extracted alongside copper.

Mondelez Bulgaria (formerly Kraft Foods Bulgaria) is the largest confectionery producer nationally, largely owing to the production capacity of its chocolate factory in Svoge. The factory was established in 1901, privatised in 1993, and upgraded in 2008 to produce up to 365,000,000 chocolate bars annually. Beverages are manufactured near Kostinbrod, where the largest instant coffee factory in Southeast Europe, as well as the main Coca-Cola bottling facility in Bulgaria, are located.

Botevgrad is a major microelectronics R&amp;D and manufacturing centre. Microchips, integrated circuits, sensors and automotive electronics are all produced by private companies on the grounds of the former &quot;Mikroelektronika&quot; state-owned factories. Computer manufacturing was also thriving in Pravets during the Socialist era and by 1988 Bulgaria seemed set to become a major exporter of computers to the West. &quot;Pravetz&quot; models manufactured in the town accounted for 40% of all computers used in the Eastern Bloc in the 1980s. The Pravets manufacturing plant became defunct after the collapse of Communism, but a high-voltage electronics factory owned by Siemens has taken its place.

Bulgaria&#x27;s oldest ski resort, Borovets, is located near Samokov. Its high annual influx of tourists has given a boost to the local property market and has drawn foreign investment in hospitality and recreation.

<text>The United Kingdom possesses, or has possessed, a variety of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The United Kingdom is one of the five official nuclear weapon states under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The UK renounced the use of chemical and biological weapons in 1956 and subsequently destroyed its general stocks.

==Biological weapons==
During the Second World War, British scientists studied the use of biological weapons, including a test using anthrax on the Scottish island of Gruinard which left it contaminated and fenced off for nearly fifty years until an intensive four-year program to eradicate the spores was completed in 1990. They also manufactured five million linseed-oil cattle cakes with a hole bored into them for addition of anthrax spores between 1942 and mid-1943. These were to be dropped on Germany using specially designed containers each holding 400 cakes, in a project known as Operation Vegetarian. It was intended that the disease would destroy the German beef and dairy herds and possibly spread to the human population. Preparations were not complete until early 1944. Operation Vegetarian was only to be used in the event of a German anthrax attack on the United Kingdom.

Offensive weapons development continued after the war into the 1950s with tests of plague, brucellosis, tularemia and later equine encephalomyelitis and vaccinia viruses (the latter as a relatively safe simulant for smallpox).

In particular, five sets of trials took place at sea using aerosol clouds and animals.

* Operation Harness off Antigua in 1948–1949.
* Operation Cauldron off Stornoway in 1952. The trawler &quot;Carella&quot; unknowingly sailed through a cloud of pneumonic plague bacilli (&quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;) during this trial. It was kept under covert observation until the incubation period had elapsed but none of the crew fell ill.
* Operation Hesperus off Stornoway in 1953.
* Operation Ozone off Nassau in 1954.
* Operation Negation off Nassau in 1954–1955.

The program was canceled in 1956 when the British government renounced the use of biological and chemical weapons. In 1974, biological weapons were banned, and the United Kingdom ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in March 1975.

==Chemical weapons==
The UK was a signatory of the Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907) which outlawed the use of poison gas in warfare. However, during the First World War, in retaliation to the use of chlorine by Germany against British troops from April 1915 onwards, British forces deployed chlorine themselves for the first time during the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915. By the end of the war, poison gas use had become widespread on both sides and by 1918 a quarter of artillery shells were filled with gas and Britain had produced around 25,400 tons of toxic chemicals.

Britain used a range of poison gases, originally chlorine and later phosgene, diphosgene and mustard gas. They also used relatively small amounts of the irritant gases chloromethyl chloroformate, chloropicrin, bromacetone and ethyl iodoacetate. Gases were frequently mixed, for example &quot;white star&quot; was the name given to a mixture of equal volumes of chlorine and phosgene, the chlorine helping to spread the denser but more toxic phosgene. Despite the technical developments, chemical weapons suffered from diminishing effectiveness as the war progressed because of the protective equipment and training which the use engendered on both sides. See Use of poison gas in World War I.

After the war, the Royal Air Force dropped mustard gas on Bolshevik troops in 1919, and Winston Churchill, secretary of state for war and air, suggested that the RAF use it in Iraq in 1920 during a major revolt there. Historians are divided as to whether or not gas was in fact used.

The UK ratified the Geneva Protocol on 9 April 1930. The UK signed the Chemical Weapons Convention on 13 January 1993 and ratified it on 13 May 1996.

Despite the signing of the Geneva Protocol, the UK carried out extensive testing of chemical weapons from the early 1930s onwards. In the Rawalpindi experiments, hundreds of Indian soldiers were exposed to mustard gas in an attempt to determine the appropriate dosage to use on battlefields. Many of the subjects suffered severe burns from their exposure to the gas.

Many ex-servicemen have complained about suffering long-term illnesses after taking part in tests on nerve agents. It was alleged that before volunteering they were not provided with adequate information about the experiments and the risk, in breach of the Nuremberg Code of 1947. Alleged abuses at Porton Down became the subject of a lengthy police investigation called Operation Antler, which covered the use of volunteers in testing a variety of chemical weapons and countermeasures from 1939 until 1989. An inquest was opened on 5 May 2004 into the death on 6 May 1953 of a serviceman, Ronald Maddison, during an experiment using sarin. His death had earlier been found by a private MoD inquest to have been as a result of &quot;misadventure&quot; but this was quashed by the High Court in 2002. The 2004 hearing closed on 15 November, after a jury found that the cause of Maddison&#x27;s death was &quot;application of a nerve agent in a non-therapeutic experiment&quot;.

==Nuclear weapons==

British nuclear weapons are designed and developed by the UK&#x27;s Atomic Weapons Establishment. The United Kingdom has four submarines armed with nuclear armed Trident missiles. The principle of operation is based on maintaining deterrent effect by always having at least one submarine at sea, and was designed during the Cold War period. One submarine is normally undergoing maintenance and the remaining two are in port or on training exercises.

Each submarine carries up to sixteen Trident II D-5 missiles, which can each carry up to twelve warheads, for a maximum of 192 warheads per vessel. However, the British government announced in 1998 that each submarine would carry only 48 warheads (halving the limit specified by the previous government), which is an average of three per missile. However one or two missiles per submarine are probably armed with fewer warheads for &quot;sub-strategic&quot; use causing others to be armed with more.

The British-designed warheads are thought to be selectable between 0.3 kilotons, 5–10 kt and 100 kt; the yields obtained using either the unboosted primary, the boosted primary, or the entire &quot;physics package&quot;. The United Kingdom has purchased the rights to 58 missiles under the Polaris Sales Agreement (modified for Trident) from the United States Navy&#x27;s &quot;pool&quot;. These missiles are fitted with United Kingdom–built warheads and are exchanged when requiring maintenance. Under the agreement the United States was given certain assurances by the UK regarding the use of the missiles; however the United States does not have any veto on the use of British nuclear weapons. Some non-nuclear components for the British nuclear warhead are procured from the U.S. for reasons of cost effectiveness.

The United Kingdom is one of the five &quot;Nuclear Weapons States&quot; (NWS) under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the UK ratified in 1968.

The UK permits the U.S. to deploy nuclear weapons from its territory, the first having arrived in 1954. During the 1980s nuclear armed USAF Ground Launched Cruise Missiles were deployed at RAF Greenham Common and RAF Molesworth. As of 2005 it is believed that about 110 tactical B61 nuclear bombs are stored at RAF Lakenheath for deployment by USAF F-15E aircraft.

In March 2007, the UK Parliament voted to renew the country&#x27;s Trident nuclear submarine system at a cost of £20bn. In July 2008, &quot;The Guardian&quot; claimed that the decision had already been made to replace and upgrade Britain&#x27;s nuclear warhead stockpile at a cost of £3bn, extending the life of the warheads until 2055.

On 25 February 2020, the UK released a Written Statement outlining that the current UK nuclear warheads will be replaced and will match the US Trident SLBM and related systems.

In March 2021, the British government published the Integrated Review, titled &quot;Global Britain in a Competitive Age&quot;, which reaffirmed the government&#x27;s commitment to upgrading and maintaining Trident as a continuous at-sea deterrent. The review also announced that the cap for the UK&#x27;s stockpile of nuclear warheads would rise from 180 to 260 — the first time it has risen since the Cold War — due to the &quot;evolving security environment&quot;.

<text>Pazardzhik Province ( &quot;Oblast Pazardzhik&quot;, former name Pazardzhik okrug) is a province in Southern Bulgaria, named after its administrative and industrial centre: the city of Pazardzhik. The territory is that is divided into 12 municipalities with a total population of 275,548 inhabitants, as of February 2011.

==History==

The territory of the Pazardzhik Province has been inhabited since very early times. There are more than 50 discovered Stone Age and Bronze Age settlements. The earliest civilization to inhabit the region were the Thracians. The remains of the Thracian town Besapara are located in the hills near the provincial capital Pazardzhik. The Panagyurishte Treasure unearthed near the northern town of the same name is known as one of the finest examples of Thracian art. The 6.164 kg of 23-karat gold treasure which consists of nine vessels has been dated back to the 4th and 3rd century BC. In the 1st century BC the region became a Roman province and remained in the Byzantine Empire after the fall of Rome.

Most of the region became part of the Bulgarian Empire in the beginning of the 9th century and remained in Bulgarian hands until the fall of the First Empire. With the rise of the Second Bulgarian Empire the region once again became part of the country until it was overran by the Ottomans in the late 14th century. Some of medieval fortresses are Tsepina near the village of Dorkovo and Krasen in the vicinities of Bata.

The April Uprising of 1876 against the Ottoman rule was widely supported within the region and the town of Panagyurishte became the center of the uprising. The Bulgarian population also rebelled to the south where the Ottoman atrocities culminated in the Batak massacre. The massacre included 8,000 people killed and one of the deadliest massacres in Bulgarian history. According to the Treaty of Berlin after the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 the region was included in the autonomous region Eastern Rumelia. It included the okolias Pazardzhik, Peshtera, Ihtiman, Koprivshtitsa and Panagyurishte. The department was later incooporated into the new Principality of Bulgaria on 6 September 1885.

The first reported Red Army troops in the region were in Pazardzhik on 23 September 1944, where the Soviet command was headed by Dimitry Gorunkov. Territorial changes were made, as Sarnitsa was transferred from Devinska okolia to Pazardzhik okolia in 1949. A concentration camp was established with the name Camp &quot;C&quot;. Demonstrations were held in 1989 with more than 5,000 people alone in the administrative capital.

Sarnitsa Municipality became the newest municipality in the province, as well as in Bulgaria on 1 January 2015.

<doc id="589043" wikidata="Q1137000" url="?curid=589043" title="COUM Transmissions">
<text>COUM Transmissions was a music and performance art collective who operated in the United Kingdom from 1969 through to 1976. The collective was influenced by the Dada and surrealism artistic movements, the writers of the Beat Generation, and underground music. COUM were openly confrontational and subversive, challenging aspects of conventional British society. Founded in Hull, Yorkshire, by Genesis P-Orridge, other prominent early members included Cosey Fanni Tutti and Spydeee Gasmantell (also at school with Genesis P-Orridge). Part-time members included Tim Poston, Brook Menzies, Haydn Robb, Les (Reverend Lelli) Maull, Ray Harvey, John (Jonji) Smith, Foxtrot Echo, Fizzy Paet, and John Gunni Busck (John Lacey). Late-joining member Peter &quot;Sleazy&quot; Christopherson, together with P-Orridge and Tutti went on to found the pioneering industrial band Throbbing Gristle in 1976.

COUM (an acronym of Cosmic Organicism of the Universal Molecular) had a rotating membership, and included both intellectual and criminal elements and existed formally from 1969 until 1976. In that year, P-Orrige and Tutti exhibited at London&#x27;s Institute of Contemporary Arts in a show called &quot;Prostitution&quot;, which consisted of explicit photographs of lesbians, assemblages of rusty knives, syringes, bloodied hair, used sanitary towels, press clippings, and photo documentation of COUM performances in Milan and Paris. There was a lot of outrage expressed by London newspapers and UK politicians, including Tory MP Nicholas Fairbairn, who referred to COUM as the &quot;wreckers of Western civilization&quot;. However, memberships to the ICA increased sharply as a result of the COUM show.

The last official COUM performances and art shows took place in 1976. Around that time, P-Orridge proclaimed to be through with performance art. Tutti, on the other hand, felt she had only just begun. Though she feels the name COUM to be &quot;tainted&quot; now and unusable, she has been known to say her individual projects are still a part of the COUM family of work. For a while, she operated a website at COUM.co.uk.

==Foundation: 1968–1970==
The founder of COUM Transmissions was Genesis P-Orridge (1950–2020), a Mancunian by birth who later founded Throbbing Gristle and other projects. A university student who had developed a great interest in the radical counter-culture, P-Orridge had dropped out of h/er studies at the University of Hull and spent three months living in the Transmedia Explorations commune in North London during late 1968. The commune members adhered to a strict regimen with the intention of deconditioning its members out of their routines and conventional behaviour; they were forbidden from sleeping in the same place on consecutive nights, food was cooked at irregular times of the day and all clothing was kept in a communal chest, with its members wearing something different on each day. P-Orridge stayed there for three months, until late October 1969, after deciding to leave, due to being angered that the commune&#x27;s leaders were given more rights than the other members, and believed that the group lacked an interest in music. After hitch-hiking across the country, Genesis P-Orridge settled down in their parents&#x27; new home in Shrewsbury, and volunteered as an office clerk in their father&#x27;s new business.
P-Orridge first developed the concept for COUM on a family trip to Wales, while sitting in the back of the car; P-Orridge became &quot;disembodied and heard voices and saw the COUM symbol and heard the words &#x27;COUM Transmissions&#x27;.&quot; Returning home that evening, P-Orridge filled three notebooks with various artistic thoughts and ideas, influenced in part by time spent with Transmedia Explorations. In December 1969, P-Orridge returned to Hull to meet up with friend John Shapeero, with whom P-Orridge would turn COUM Transmissions into an &quot;avant-garde&quot; artistic and musical troupe. They initially debated as to how to define &quot;COUM&quot;, later deciding that like the name dada it should remain open to interpretation. P-Orridge designed a logo for the group, consisting of a semi-erect penis formed out of the word COUM with a drip of semen coming out of the end, while the motto &quot;YOUR LOCAL DIRTY BANNED&quot; was emblazoned underneath. Another logo designed by Megson consisted of a hand-drawn seal accompanied by the statement &quot;COUM guarantee disappointment&quot;; from their early foundation, the group made use of wordplay in their artworks and adverts.

COUM&#x27;s earliest public events were impromptu musical gigs performed at various pubs around Hull; titles for these events included &quot;Thee Fabulous Mutations&quot;, &quot;Space Between the Violins&quot;, &quot;Dead Violins and Degradation&quot; and &quot;Clockwork Hot Spoiled Acid Test&quot;. The latter combined the names of Anthony Burgess&#x27; dystopian science-fiction novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1962) with Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; (1968), a work of literary journalism devoted to the Merry Pranksters, a U.S. communal counter-cultural group who advocated the use of psychedelic drugs. COUM&#x27;s music was anarchic and improvised, making use of such instruments as broken violins, prepared pianos, guitars, bongos and talking drums. As time went on, they would add further theatrics to their performances, in one instance making the audience crawl through a polythene tunnel in order to enter the venue.

In December 1969, P-Orridge and Shapeero moved out of their flat and into a former fruit warehouse in Hull&#x27;s dockland area, overlooking the Humber. Named the Ho-Ho Funhouse by P-Orridge, the warehouse became the communal home to an assortment of counter-cultural figures, including artists, musicians, fashion designers and underground magazine producers. At Christmas 1969, Christine Newby moved into the Funhouse after being thrown out of her home by her father. Having earlier befriended P-Orridge at an acid test party, Newby would move into h/er room at the Funhouse, adopting the pseudonym Cosey Fanni Tutti after the title of Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s 1790 opera &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;. Joining COUM, Tutti initially helped in building props and designing costumes, and was there when the group began changing its focus from music to performance art and more theatrical happenings; one of these involved the group turning up to play a gig but intentionally not bringing any instruments, something P-Orridge considered &quot;much more theatrical, farcical and light-hearted&quot; than their earlier performances.

==Notoriety in Hull: 1971–1973==

On 5 January 1971, by now living at 8 Prince Street Hull, Megson officially changed his name to Genesis P-Orridge by deed poll, combining his adopted nickname of &quot;Genesis&quot; with a misspelling of &quot;porridge&quot;, the foodstuff which he lived off as a student. His new &quot;nom-de-guerre&quot; was intentionally un-glamorous, and he hoped that by adopting it he would trigger his own &quot;genius factor&quot;. This caught the attention of the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;, who featured an article on COUM Transmissions on 11 February. Soon, COUM began to attract further media attention from newspapers across the country. On 18 April 1971, COUM, consisting of Genesis P&#x27;Orridge &amp; Spydeee Gasmantell broadcast their first live radio session, for the &quot;On Cue&quot; programme for Radio Humberside and were interviewed by Jim Hawkins. As well as their radio and press exposure, they performed a variety of other happenings, such as &quot;Riot Control&quot; at the Gondola Club and then their first street action, &quot;Absolute Everywhere&quot;, which got them in trouble with the local police force.

The Gondola Club was raided by the police and closed down soon after; most other local clubs blamed COUM and unofficially banned them from performing in the Hull area. COUM drew up a petition which they distributed locally to gain support for the group and as a result, the group got a booking at the local Brickhouse, which was their first performance in which the audience applauded and called for an encore. However, the petition had contained their phallic logo, and the police charged P-Orridge and fellow COUM member Haydn Robb (now known as Haydn Nobb) of publishing an obscene advert, although the charges were later dropped. Gaining coverage in the music press, interest in the band grew, and they were asked to support the rock band Hawkwind at St. George&#x27;s Hall in Bradford in October 1971, where they performed a piece called &quot;Edna and the Great Surfers&quot;, where they led the crowd in shouting &quot;Off, Off, Off&quot;. The following month, the band attracted the interest of John Peel, who discussed the band in &quot;Disco and Music Echo&quot;, remarking that &quot;[s]ome might say that Coum were madmen but constant exposure to mankind forces me to believe that we need more madmen like them.&quot; They also featured in an article in &quot;Torch&quot;, the publication of the University of Hull&#x27;s student union, entitled &quot;God Sucks Mary&#x27;s Hairy Nipple&quot;; a title from a message received during a seance in Solihull attended by P&#x27;Orridge, Gasmantell and others in 1967. The author of the article, Haydn Robb, would subsequently join the performance collective. Tim Poston (1945–2017), subsequently a lecturer in mathematics at Warwick University went on to undertake research into catastrophe theory, influenced, it is claimed by Genesis P&#x27;Orridge, by his work in COUM.

COUM released one song produced in this early period, &quot;Dry Blood Tampax&quot;, on their 1983 cassette &quot;23 Drifts to Guestling&quot;. They recognised that they would never become a commercial success and so sought out other forms of funding, successfully applying for a small Experimental Arts Grant from the Yorkshire Arts Association, a publicly funded body. Now openly describing themselves as performance artists, COUM looked up to the work of the Dadaists and emphasised the amateur quality of their work, proclaiming that &quot;[t]he future of music lies in non-musicians&quot;, and strongly contrasting themselves with the classically trained figures involved in progressive rock which had attained mainstream popularity in Britain at the time. P-Orridge began to take an increasing interest in infantilism, founding a fictitious school of art, the L&#x27;ecole de l&#x27;art infantile, whose work culminated in a 1983 event known as the Baby&#x27;s Coumpetition held at Oxford University&#x27;s May Festival, which he had co-organised with Robin Klassnik and Opal L. Nations. Another invention of P-Orridge&#x27;s at this time was his Ministry of Antisocial Insecurity (MAI), a parody of the governmental Ministry of Social Security. He also set about working on creating a character known as Alien Brain, and in July 1972 performed the &quot;World Premiere of The Alien Brain&quot; at Hull Arts Centre, a multi-media happening that involved the audience and which had received funding from the Yorkshire Arts Association. That summer, they also entered the National Rock/Folk Contest at the New Grange Club in Hull with a set entitled &quot;This Machine Kills Music&quot;; a parody of the slogan &quot;this machine kills fascists&quot;.

They also put together their first book for publication; the first volume in a projected project known as &quot;The Million and One Names of COUM&quot; appeared in 1972, containing 1001 slogans, such as &quot;COUM are Fab and Kinky&quot; and &quot;A thousand and one ways to COUM.&quot;. This was based on the science fiction short story The Nine Billion Names of God written by Arthur C. Clarke in 1953 Another of P-Orridge&#x27;s early publications was the book &quot;Copyright Breeches&quot; (1973), which explored his ongoing fascination with the copyright symbol and its wider implications for art and society. COUM organised events for Hull City Council&#x27;s &quot;Fanfare for Europe&quot; to commemorate the UK&#x27;s joining the European Economic Community in 1973, while that year P-Orridge featured a piece of conceptual art, &#x27;Wagon Train&#x27;, at the Ferens Art Gallery&#x27;s &quot;Winter Show&quot;, proving controversial in local press.

==Move to London: 1973–1976==

Following continual police harassment, P-Orridge and Tutti relocated to London, moving in to a squat and obtaining a basement studio in Hackney which they named the &quot;Death Factory&quot;. After a brief correspondence, here P-Orridge met American novelist and poet William S. Burroughs (1914–1997), who later introduced him to the English/Canadian poet and artist Brion Gysin (1916–1986). Gysin would become a major influence upon P-Orridge&#x27;s ideas and works and was h/er primary tutor in magic. 1973 saw COUM take part in the &quot;Fluxshoe&quot; retrospective that toured Britain exhibiting the work of the Fluxus artists; it was organised by David Mayor, who befriended P-Orridge. At that year&#x27;s Edinburgh Festival, they undertook their Marcel Duchamp-inspired &quot;Art Vandals&quot; piece at the Richard Demarco Gallery, in which they engaged guests in unconventional conversation, and spilled their food and drink on the floor. Exhibiting alongside the Viennese Actionists, they came under increasing influence from these Austrian performance artists, adopting their emphasis on using shock tactics to combat conventional morality. September 1973 saw them produce their first film, &quot;Wundatrek Tours&quot;, which documented a day out to Brighton, while throughout the year they sent postcards that they had designed to mail-art shows across the world.

In January 1974, COUM decided to refocus their attention on music, doing so in a collaboration with the Canadian artist Clive Robertson; their co-created piece was titled &quot;Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s Next Work&quot;. It premiered on 24 January 1974 at the Fourth International Festival of Electronic Music and Mixed Media at the Zwaarte Zaal in Ghent, Belgium, and had its second performance at Brussels&#x27; Palais des Beaux-Arts. The piece entailed bringing together twelve replicas of the dada artist Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s 1913 sculpture &quot;Bicycle Wheel&quot;, assembled in a circle, which were then played as musical instruments while either P-Orridge or Robertson conducted the piece. COUM&#x27;s next major work was &quot;Couming of Age&quot;, performed in March 1974 at the Oval House in Kennington, South London; it represented the most conventional theatrical performance of their career. After the show, they were approached by an audience member, Peter Christopherson, who shared many of their interests; P-Orridge and Tutti nicknamed him &quot;Sleazy&quot; because of his particular interest in the sexual aspects of COUM&#x27;s work. He began to aid them using his skills as a photographer and graphic designer, and would first perform with them in their March 1975 work &quot;Couming of Youth&quot;. In May 1974, COUM issued a manifesto published on an A3 double-sided sheet titled &quot;Decoumpositions and Events&quot;.

In April 1974 the Arts Council of Great Britain gave COUM the first half of a £1,500 grant, which was largely used to pay off the groups&#x27; £300 debt. The money stabilised the group, which now included P-Orridge and Tutti as directors, John Gunni Busck as technical director, and Lelli Maull as musical director. During that year, they made use of various artist-run venues in London, most notably the Art Meeting Place (AMP) in Covent Garden, where they regularly performed during 1974; these actions included &quot;Orange and Blue&quot;, &quot;Gainsborough&#x27;s Blue Movie Boy&quot;, &quot;4 Hours Music Action&quot;, &quot;Signals&quot;, and &quot;Throbbing Gristle&quot;. A number of these works entailed P-Orridge and Tutti exploring the gender balance, including concepts of gender confusion; P-Orridge for instance dressed in female clothing to adopt the persona of &#x27;Crystal P-Orridge&#x27; on one occasion. In another piece performed at the AWB, which was titled &quot;Filth&quot;, P-Orridge and Tutti performed sexual acts using a double-ended dildo while on a bed.

COUM were frustrated with the restrictions imposed on them by the Arts Council as a prerequisite for receiving funding; the Council insisted that they perform in at least eight specifically-chosen venues a year, although COUM felt that this meant performing to the same audiences repeatedly and wished to perform at a wide range of other locations, such as in fields and on streets. In August 1974 they carried out a spontaneous unauthorised piece of performance art in Brook Green, Hammersmith. Titled &quot;Airborn Spells, Landborn Smells&quot;, it entailed the group members pretending to be dogs and pushing along a pram containing chicken&#x27;s heads and bloodied tampons; during the performance, police arrived and put a stop to the event, deeming it to be obscene. In September 1974, COUM were invited to attend the Stadfest in Rottweil, West Germany, and they proceeded with a travel grant from the British Council. Their first performance there was titled &quot;Schlimm&quot;, which involved P-Orridge and Tutti performing anarchic actions in the street using a range of props. The next day, they followed this with a second street action, &quot;All that Glitters is not Kunst&quot;, which earned them praise from Bridget Riley and Ernst Jandl, both of whom were present. The acclaim that COUM received at Rottweil established the group&#x27;s reputation as &quot;one of the most innovative performance art groups then on the London art scene&quot;, convincing the Arts Council and British Council to take them more seriously and offer them greater support.

In February 1975, P-Orridge gained his only full-time job, working as an assistant editor for Colin Naylor at St. James&#x27; Press, in which he helped to compile the &quot;Contemporary Artists&quot; reference book. The work meant that he had less time to devote to COUM but gained a wide range of contacts in the art world. During that year, COUM embarked on a series of five performance pieces which it termed &quot;Omissions&quot;; these were performed across Europe, including at the Europa-Tag in Gross Gerau and the Kulturamt in Kiel. In March 1975, COUM performed &quot;Couming of Youth&quot; at the Melkweg in Theater Zaal, Amsterdam. Adopting a more violent stance than their previous work – in this reflecting an influence from the Viennese Actionists – the performance involved self-mutilation, Cosey inserting lighted candles into her vagina, P-Orridge being crucified and whipped, and P-Orridge and Cosey having sexual intercourse. At Southampton&#x27;s Nuffield Festival in July 1975, COUM performed &quot;Studio of Lust&quot;, where P-Orridge publicly masturbated and all of the members undressed and adopted sexual poses.

==Chris Carter and the establishment of Throbbing Gristle: 1975–==

COUM were introduced to Chris Carter in the summer of 1975 through their mutual friend John Lacey. Lacey believed that Carter would be interested in COUM as a result of his particular interest in the experimental use of light and sound. Together, Carter, Christopherson, Cosey and P-Orridge founded a musical band, Throbbing Gristle, on 3 September 1975; they had deliberately chosen that date for it was the 36th anniversary of the United Kingdom joining the Second World War. The term &quot;throbbing gristle&quot; was deliberately chosen for it was a Yorkshire slang term for an erect penis. Throbbing Gristle, or TG as it was widely known, was aimed at a wider audience than COUM, thereby aiming to work within popular culture rather than the elite realm of the art scene. COUM and TG were largely treated as distinct entities; the music press ignored COUM and saw TG as experimental art rock, while the arts press ignored TG, viewing COUM as performance artists. Despite their intention of operating within the realms of popular culture, TG never had chart success, and remained a cult band; their audience was however far larger than COUM.

COUM continued to operate alongside TG, and in October 1975 they performed &quot;Jusquà la balle crystal&quot;&quot; at the Ninth Paris Biennale at the Musée d&#x27;art modern. The prestige of being invited to such an event led to the Arts Council awarding them a grant for £1,600, although only the first half of this was ever paid out. COUM&#x27;s mail art had taken on an increasingly pornographic dimension, and in November 1975 the police charged P-Orridge with distributing obscene material via in the postal system under the 1953 Post Office Act; this trial was set for February 1976.

==The &quot;Prostitution&quot; show: 1976==

Their &quot;Prostitution&quot; show, in 1976 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London, exhibited Tutti&#x27;s pornographic images from magazines as well as erotic nude photographs. The show featured a stripper, used Tampax in glass, and transvestite guards. Prostitutes, punks, and people in costumes were among those hired to mingle with the gallery audience. The show caused debate in Parliament about the public funding of such events. In the House of Commons, Scottish Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn demanded an explanation from Arts Minister Harold Lever and proclaimed P-Orridge and Tutti as &quot;wreckers of civilisation&quot;. Fleet Street was not slow to pick up the story. The reviews were cut up, framed and put on display for the remainder of the exhibition. This was also reported in newspapers, so cut-ups about the cut-ups were also put on display. 

Toward the end of COUM, performances would often consist of only P-Orridge, Cosey and Sleazy, the core group who went on to form Throbbing Gristle.

COUM ended when, at a performance in Antwerp, P-Orridge had ingested leaves, bark, and whiskey and started cutting their skin with nails and became sick and had to be taken to the hospital. They decided to &quot;stop doing performance art.&quot;

==Discography==

In July 2009, American record label Dais Records released archival vinyl LP releases by COUM Transmissions entitled &quot;The Sound Of Porridge Bubbling&quot; (2009), &quot;Sugarmorphoses&quot; (2011) and &quot;Home Aged &amp; The 18 Month Hope&quot; (2013) in a limited edition of 500, as was the case with &quot;Early Worm&quot; (Genesis P-Orridge, Spydeee Gasmantell, Pingle Wad, and Ron Megson (the father of Genesis P-Orridge), 1968) in 2008. 

The COUM Transmissions &quot;The Sound of Porridge Bubbling&quot; LP was recorded in 1971 featuring Genesis P-Orridge, Spydeee Gasmantell, Ray Harvey, Cosey Fanni Tutti and others. What musical content the LP features is improvisational and avant-garde in nature, and for the most part the album&#x27;s tracks consist of spoken word material and sound experiments, at times reminiscent of the audio material that William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin had been experimenting with in the 1960s. One track, Nude Supper is a direct reading by Spydeee Gasmantell from William S. Burroughs work, Naked Lunch. The online version of this album has subsequently been amended so that the track titled &#x27;Nude Supper&#x27; now refers to the track &#x27;Sound of Porridge Bubbling&#x27;, the track &#x27;Sound of Porridge Bubbling&#x27; is a taped version of The Stripper. The original spoken word version of the reading from &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; is only found on the original 500 vinyl copies of the album.

==Legacy==
&quot;Other, Like Me: The Oral History of COUM Transmissions and Throbbing Gristle&quot;, a documentary on both projects consisting of archival footage and photos and interviews with their members, was co-produced by BBC Television and aired on BBC Four in December 2021.

<text>The Volkswagen Pointer was a small family car sold by Autolatina in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay from 1994 to 1996. The Pointer was available as a five-door hatchback, and the two-door Sedan version, called the Volkswagen Logus, was sold from 1993 to 1996.

It was based on the European version of the Ford Escort, being the result of Volkswagen Group&#x27;s AutoLatina joint venture with Ford Motor Company, which also saw the Volkswagen Santana rebadged as the Ford Versailles. Although there were sheet metal differences between the Pointer and the Escort, the styling cues were still noticeably those of Ford rather than Volkswagen.

The nameplate remained in use after the Escort-based model was retired from production, as the Brazilian-manufactured Volkswagen Gol was marketed as the Volkswagen Pointer in Mexico, and also in Russia, Ukraine and Egypt.

The Volkswagen Pointer five-door hatchback was developed on the same Ford Escort MkV platform as the Volkswagen Logus, presented in 1993 in October. Offered in four versions: CLI 1.8, GLI 1.8, GLI 2.0 and GTI 2.0.

The last Pointer produced, a hatchback GTI model, was sent to Volkswagen&#x27;s factory museum in Wolfsburg, Germany.

==Highlights==
* 1994 Digital Multipoint Injection Ford EEC-IV on GTI improved performance, level of noise and fuel consumption.
* 1995 offered option of coloured bumpers.
* 1996 GTI had new wheels and interior upholstery.
* 1996 was also the last year of production, due to the Autolatina partnership falling apart.

== Infrastructure ==

===Gas, water, electricity and telecommunications===
The regional road system consists of of the republican road system. Predominating are the 4th class roads. Their maintenance and control are under the responsibilities of the municipalities. The rehabilitation of these roads is a priority of the regional policy. Mezdra is a key railway station connecting the major cities in Bulgaria. The passenger&#x27;s transport is ensured by 116 buses and 26 trolleys. The telecommunication network consists of 4 regional post stations - Vratsa, Byala Slatina, Mezdra and Kozloduy, and 116 local post offices. They offer universal post services including express mail and international courier services EMS, SKYPAK and DHL. In the town of Vratsa there are branch offices of Mobiltel, Globul and Vivatel. The water supply system was envisaged to be improved and sewerage was mostly built, but there is a program for modernization all over the province, including the smaller villages. The nuclear power plant in Kozloduy, in the northern part of the province, is the major supplier of electricity in Bulgaria.

===Roads, railroads and airports===
The administrative capital of the province is Vratsa in the southern parts, about from Sofia. The distance to the major cities is as follows: Vratsa - Varna 414 km, Vratsa - Plovdiv 217 km; Vratsa - Pleven 108 km; Vratsa - Burgas 416 km. The international road E79 passes through the province. The major European port and ferry complex Oryahovo-Bechet, on the river Danube, is situated in Oryahovo municipality.

== Workforce ==
The economically active population is 48,892, employed as follows: in the services sector - 27,685, in the industry - 19,020, in the agriculture - 2,187. The population has increased since the year 2000, and are mostly in private labour employment. The rate of unemployment is higher than the Bulgarian average, and the aim of the provincial policy is to implement programs to resolve this problem. The labour force distribution in the basic economic sectors is the following - in the industry - 38.9%, in the agriculture - 4.5% and in services - 56.6%. The decrease of the number and relative share of the employees in the public sector is matched by an increase in the private sector. The proportion of workforce in state and private sectors is 44.2% to 55.8%. The higher level of education stipulates a higher employment rate. In the province predominates the number of employees of secondary education. On the labour market, the number of specialists of higher education decreases in favour of those without education. The average salary level for the province is 297 levs.

== Current priority industry sectors ==
The natural peculiarities of Vratsa Province contribute to the development of agriculture, lumber industry and electricity production. Major companies are the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, of national importance; Chimco AD - fertilizer factory, Beloizvorski cement - cement factory and brewery; Ledenika AD - joint stock company; Centromet AD - centrifugal casting; Vratitsa LTD - yarns, raw and finished fabrics, sewing articles; OMK Holding - machining and machinery, tooling equipment, foundry, special production; Hemus-M AD - limestone, slabs, tiles, blocks, columns; Sunnytex AD - production of household linen, weaving etc.; Metizi AD - steel wires, ropes and their products, spare parts; Variana LTD - concrete articles, greyiron cast, metal safes; Enemona Holding - civil engineering.

== Sectors for development ==
The main projects are related to the development of the transport infrastructure, water supply and sewerage, agriculture - vegetables, cattle breeding, silk-worm breeding, mushroom cultivation, development and strengthening of the existing industrial plants, development of alternative forms of tourism - rural, ecotourism, cultural, religious, spaeology, mountaineering, hang gliding etc. The long-term strategy for the regional economy is to promote small and medium enterprises as an alternative way to develop the industry.

== Schools, universities and job training ==
Because of the close distance to the capital Sofia (site of the main universities in Bulgaria), only one local centre of New Bulgarian University, one pedagogical college - branch of the Veliko Tarnovo University and one medical college exists in the province. The vocational schools have their main disciplines mostly in agricultural techniques, mechanics and electrotechnics, chemical technologies, civil engineering and construction, language school and mathematical secondary school. The total number of primary schools in the province is 54, 14 of them situated in the municipality of Vratsa and all state-owned. There is only one private school, Europe Schools for English Language and Management.

== Financial institutions ==
At present, there are 15 branches of Bulgarian banks. The insurance companies have their 12 branches in the province.

== Hospitals ==
The medical services are provided in 6 hospitals - 2 of them in the main city of the province, Vratsa. As a result of the reforms in health care, there are also private medical services available, as well as stomatological services.

== Culture, recreation and resources ==
Three hotels are available within the province - Valdi Palace, Hotel Tourist in the town and Vratsa, and Hotel Istar in the town of Kozloduy.

<text>Eric Francis Harrison Coates (27 August 1886 – 21 December 1957) was an English composer of light music and, early in his career, a leading violist.

Coates was born into a musical family, but, despite his wishes and obvious talent, his parents only reluctantly allowed him to pursue a musical career. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music under Frederick Corder (composition) and Lionel Tertis (viola), and played in string quartets and theatre pit bands, before joining symphony orchestras conducted by Thomas Beecham and Henry Wood. Coates&#x27;s experience as a player added to the rigorous training he had received at the academy and contributed to his skill as a composer.

While still working as a violist, Coates composed songs and other light musical works. In 1919 he gave up the viola permanently and from then until his death he made his living as a composer and occasional conductor. His prolific output includes the &quot;London Suite&quot; (1932), of which the well-known &quot;Knightsbridge March&quot; is the concluding section; the waltz &quot;By the Sleepy Lagoon&quot; (1930); and &quot;The Dam Busters March&quot; (1954). His early compositions were influenced by the music of Arthur Sullivan and Edward German, but Coates&#x27;s style evolved in step with changes in musical taste, and his later works incorporate elements derived from jazz and dance-band music. His output consists almost wholly of orchestral music and songs. With the exception of one unsuccessful short ballet, he never wrote for the theatre, and only occasionally for the cinema.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Coates was born in Hucknall Torkard, Nottinghamshire, the only son, and youngest of five children, of William Harrison Coates (1851–1935), a medical general practitioner, and his wife, Mary Jane Gwyn, &quot;née&quot; Blower (1850–1928). It was a musical household: Dr Coates was a capable amateur flautist and singer, and his wife was a fine pianist.

As a child, Coates did not go to school, but was educated with his sisters by a governess. His musicality became clear when he was very young, and asked to be taught to play the violin. His first lessons, from age six, were with a local violin teacher, and from thirteen he studied with George Ellenberger, who was once a pupil of Joseph Joachim. Coates also took lessons in harmony and counterpoint from Ralph Horner, lecturer in music at University College Nottingham, who had studied under Ignaz Moscheles and Ernst Richter and was a former conductor for the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company. At Ellenberger&#x27;s request, Coates switched to the viola, supposedly for a single performance; he found the deeper sound of the instrument to his liking and changed permanently from violinist to violist. In that capacity he joined a local string orchestra, for which he wrote his first surviving music, the &quot;Ballad&quot;, op. 2, dedicated to Ellenberger. It was completed on 23 October 1904 and performed later that year at the Albert Hall, Nottingham, with Coates playing in the viola section. 
Coates wanted to pursue a career as a professional musician; his parents were not in favour of it, but eventually agreed that he could seek admission to the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in London. They insisted that by the end of his first year there he must have demonstrated that his abilities were equal to a professional career, failing which he was to return to Nottinghamshire and take up a safe and respectable post in a bank. In 1906, aged twenty, Coates auditioned for admission; he was interviewed by the principal, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who was sufficiently impressed by the applicant&#x27;s setting of Burns&#x27;s &quot;A Red, Red Rose&quot; to suggest that Coates should take composition as his principal study, with the viola as subsidiary. Coates was adamant that his first concern was the viola. Mackenzie&#x27;s enthusiasm did not extend to offering a scholarship, and Dr Coates had to pay the tuition fees for his son&#x27;s first year, after which a scholarship was granted.

At the RAM Coates studied the viola with Lionel Tertis and composition with Frederick Corder. Coates made it clear to Corder that he was temperamentally drawn to writing music in a light vein rather than symphonies or oratorios. His songs featured in RAM concerts during his years as a student, and although his first press review called his two songs performed in December 1907 &quot;rather obvious&quot;, his four Shakespeare settings were praised the following year for the &quot;charm of a sincere melody&quot;. and his &quot;Devon to Me&quot; (also 1908) was credited by &quot;The Musical Times&quot; as &quot;a robust and manly ditty, worthy of publication&quot;.

Coates was fortunate in his viola professor. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Tertis the first great protagonist of the instrument, and &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; ranks him as the foremost player of the viola. He was also regarded as a great teacher, and under his tutelage Coates developed into a first-rate viola player. While still a student he earned money playing in theatre orchestras in the West End, including the Savoy, where he played for several weeks under François Cellier in a Gilbert and Sullivan season in 1907.

===Professional violist and composer: 1908–1919===

In 1908 Coates&#x27;s studies at the RAM came to an unexpected end when Tertis had to drop out of a tour of South Africa as a member of the Hambourg Quartet, a leading string ensemble; he arranged for Coates to be invited to fill the vacancy. Coates resigned his scholarship at the academy and joined the tour. At about this time he began to be troubled by pain in his left hand and numbness in his right, which were symptoms of the neuritis that affected him throughout the remaining eleven years of his career as a violist. After working with the Hambourg Quartet, Coates was violist of the Cathie and Walenn quartets.

Alongside his busy playing career, Coates had several early successes as a composer. The soprano Olga Wood, wife of the conductor Henry Wood, sang Coates&#x27;s &quot;Four Old English Songs&quot; at the Proms in 1909; the music critic of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that they were &quot;tuneful, somewhat in the manner of Mr. Edward German&quot;, and showed the influence of Arthur Sullivan in the word-setting. The songs were taken up by other prominent singers including Gervase Elwes, Carrie Tubb and Nellie Melba. The composer&#x27;s many collaborations with the lyricist Frederic Weatherly began with &quot;Stonecracker John&quot; (1909), the first of a succession of highly popular ballads. Wood was the dedicatee of the &quot;Miniature Suite&quot;, the last movement of which was encored when he conducted its first performance, at the Proms, in October 1911.

In early 1911 Coates met and fell in love with an RAM student, Phyllis (Phyl) Marguerite Black (1894–1982), an aspiring actress, who was studying recitation. His affections were reciprocated but her parents were doubtful of Coates&#x27;s prospects as a husband and provider. Although he continued to compose, he was concentrating for the time being on playing the viola for his principal income, first with the Beecham Symphony Orchestra, and, from 1910, with Wood&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra. He played under the batons of composers including Elgar, Delius, Holst, Richard Strauss, Debussy, and virtuoso conductors such as Willem Mengelberg and Arthur Nikisch. This work gave him the necessary financial security to marry Phyllis in February 1913. They had one child, Austin, born in 1922.

Coates was declared medically unfit for military service in the First World War, and continued his musical career. The war brought about a severe reduction in work, and the couple&#x27;s income received a welcome boost from Phyllis&#x27;s acting engagements. As her career progressed she appeared with other rising performers including Noël Coward.

In 1919 Coates gave up playing the viola. His contract to lead the section in the Queen&#x27;s Hall orchestra expired and was not renewed. Some sources ascribe this to Coates&#x27;s wish to pursue a full-time career as a composer; others say that his neuritis affected his playing; Coates himself said that Wood valued reliability more than virtuosity, and had become exasperated by Coates&#x27;s frequent absences conducting his compositions elsewhere.

===Full-time composer: 1920s and 1930s===
Whether or not Wood had lost patience with Coates as a violist, he regarded him well enough as a composer to invite him to conduct the first performance of his suite &quot;Summer Days&quot; at a Queen&#x27;s Hall Promenade concert in October 1919, and to engage him for repeat performances of the piece in 1920, 1924 and 1925, and for more of his orchestral works including the suite &quot;Joyous Youth&quot; (1922) and the premiere of &quot;The Three Bears&quot; (1926). The latter, one of three of Coates&#x27;s most substantial works, labelled &quot;Phantasies&quot;, was inspired by the children&#x27;s stories that Phyllis Coates read to their son; the others were &quot;The Selfish Giant&quot; (1925) and &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1930).

What Coates&#x27;s biographer Geoffrey Self describes as &quot;a not-too-onerous contract with his publisher&quot; stipulated an annual output of two orchestral pieces – one of fifteen minutes&#x27; duration and one of five – and three ballads. Coates was a founder-member of the Performing Right Society, and was among the first composers whose main income came from broadcasts and recordings, after the demand for sheet music of popular songs declined in the 1920s and 1930s.

Between the First and Second world wars, Coates was in demand as a conductor of his own works, appearing in London and seaside resorts such as Bournemouth, Scarborough and Hastings, which then maintained substantial orchestras devoted to light music. But it was in the studio that he made the most impact as a composer-conductor. Beginning in 1923 he made records of his music for Columbia, which attracted a substantial following. Among those who bought his records was Elgar, who made a point of buying all Coates&#x27;s discs as they came out.

Although he and his wife maintained a country house in Sussex, Coates found city life more stimulating, and was more productive when at the family&#x27;s London flat in Baker Street. The views from there across the roofscapes prompted his &quot;London Suite&quot; (1933), with its depictions of Covent Garden, Westminster and Knightsbridge. The work transformed Coates&#x27;s status from moderate prominence to national celebrity when the BBC chose the &quot;Knightsbridge&quot; march from the suite as the signature tune for its new and prodigiously popular radio programme &quot;In Town Tonight&quot;, which ran from 1933 to 1960. 

Another work written at the Baker Street flat that enhanced the composer&#x27;s fame was &quot;By the Sleepy Lagoon&quot; (1930), an orchestral piece that made little initial impression, but with an added lyric became a hit song in the US in 1940, and in its original instrumental version became familiar in Britain as the title music of the BBC radio series &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; which began in 1942 and (in 2023) is still running.

===Later years: 1940–1957===
During the early part of the Second World War, Coates composed little until his wife suggested he might write something for the staff at the Red Cross depot where she was a volunteer worker. The result, the march &quot;Calling All Workers&quot; became one of his best known pieces, benefiting from use as another BBC signature tune, this time for the popular series &quot;Music While You Work&quot;. At the BBC&#x27;s request he wrote a report on light music on radio, completed in 1943. Some of his findings and recommendations were accepted but, according to a biographical sketch by Tim McDonald, Coates &quot;failed to bring about any significant lessening of the inherent snobbery within the Corporation which tended to take a rather dismissive view of light music&quot;.

Coates was a director of the Performing Right Society, which he represented at international conferences after the war in company with William Walton, A. P. Herbert and others. His autobiography, &quot;Suite in Four Movements&quot;, was published in 1953. The following year one of his last works became one of his best known. A march theme occurred to him, and he wrote it out and scored it with no particular end in view. Within days the producers of a forthcoming film, &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;, asked Coates&#x27;s publishers if he would be willing to provide a march for the film. The new piece was incorporated in the soundtrack and was a considerable success. In a 2003 study of the music for war films, Stuart Jeffries commented that the closing credits of &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;, with the march as a valedictory anthem, would make later composers of such music despair of matching it.
On 28 November 1957 Coates made one of his final public appearances at a fund-raising dinner for the Musicians Benevolent Fund held at the Savoy Hotel, playing dulcimer in the premiere performance of Malcolm Arnold&#x27;s Toy Symphony. On 17 December, he suffered a stroke while at the family&#x27;s Sussex house and died in the Royal West Sussex Hospital, Chichester after four days there, aged 71. He was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium.

==Music==
In &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Geoffrey Self writes that Coates consistently recognised and accommodated new fashions in music. As contemporary reviewers observed, his early compositions showed the influence of Sullivan and German, but as the 20th century progressed, Coates absorbed and made use of features of the music of Elgar and Richard Strauss. Coates and his wife were keen dancers, and in the 1920s he made use of the new syncopated dance-band styles. &quot;The Selfish Giant&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Three Bears&quot; (1926) show this distantly jazz-derived aspect of Coates&#x27;s music, with chromatic counter-melodies and use of muted brass.

Self sums up the characteristics of Coates&#x27;s music as &quot;strong melody, foot-tapping rhythm, brilliant counterpoints, and colourful orchestration&quot;. Coates derived the effective orchestration of his scores from his rigorous early training, experience in theatre pits of the practicalities of orchestration and arranging, and from hearing the symphony orchestra from the inside as a viola player. In the works of some composers, orchestral viola parts are frequently uninteresting to play, and having had to do so in Beecham&#x27;s and Wood&#x27;s orchestra, Coates was determined that his own compositions would have interesting and colourful music for every instrument of the orchestra.

Coates and his music attracted a certain amount of snobbery: &quot;The Times&quot; characterised his music as &quot;fundamentally commonplace … but well written, easy on the ear and lightly sentimental … superficial but sincere&quot;. In its obituary notice, &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; took issue with such a dismissal, and preferred the French attitude of cherishing &quot;petits-maîtres&quot; for what they were rather than condemning them for what they were not: &quot;better to write second-class masterpieces than fail to be a second Beethoven&quot;. One of Coates&#x27;s most important musical gifts was the ability to write memorable tunes – &quot;a genuine lyrical impulse&quot; as &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; put it. On first meeting him Dame Ethel Smyth said, &quot;You are the man who writes tunes&quot;, and asked him how he did it.

===Orchestral===

Coates&#x27;s orchestral works are the core of his output, and are the best known. He wrote a few works outside his normal genre – a rhapsody for saxophone and orchestra in 1936 and a &quot;symphonic rhapsody&quot; on Richard Rodgers&#x27;s &quot;With a song in my heart&quot; – his only treatment of music by another composer. The most extended of his orchestral works (at just under 20 minutes in length) is the tone poem &quot;The Enchanted Garden&quot; (1938), derived from an abortive ballet on the theme of the Seven Dwarfs, originally composed for André Charlot. But in the main his orchestral works fall into categories: suites, phantasies, marches and waltzes, plus a stand-alone overture and other short orchestral items. 

Of the thirteen suites, the most often played are the &quot;London Suite&quot; (1932), &quot;London Again&quot; (1936) and a later work, &quot;The Three Elizabeths&quot; (1944), alluding musically first to Elizabeth I, then Elizabeth of Glamis (the then queen consort), and finally the latter&#x27;s elder daughter, the future Elizabeth II. The suites generally follow a pattern of robust outer movements with a more reflective inner movement. Of the seven stand-alone waltzes, the best known, &quot;By the Sleepy Lagoon&quot; (1930), is described as a &quot;valse-serenade&quot;, although over the years it has been rendered as a beguine, a slow waltz and a slow fox-trot.

In his orchestral scores Coates was particular about metronome markings and accents. When conducting his music, he tended to set fairly brisk tempi, and disliked it when other conductors took his works at slower speeds that, to his mind, made them drag.

===Songs===
Coates&#x27;s first published works were the &quot;Four Old English Songs&quot;, written while he was still a student at the RAM. By the end of the 20th century his songs had become much less well known than his orchestral music, but when they were written they were an essential and highly popular part of his output. &quot;Grove&quot; lists 155 songs, beginning with the three Burns settings (1903) that favourably impressed Mackenzie, and ending with &quot;The Scent of Lilac&quot; (1954) to words by Winifred May.

By the mid-1920s the demand for ballads and other traditional types of song was in decline, and Coates&#x27;s output dropped accordingly. The violist and music scholar Michael Ponder writes that Coates, who was principally interested in writing orchestral music, found writing songs limiting and did so chiefly to fulfil his contract with his publisher. Nevertheless, Ponder considers that some of Coates&#x27;s later songs show him at his finest. He praises &quot;Because I miss you so&quot; and &quot;The Young Lover&quot; (both 1930) for their &quot;rich, glorious melodic vocal line&quot; supported by &quot;subtle piano writing that maintains the unity and intensifies the colour and effect of the vocal line&quot;. Almost all the songs, whether from the composer&#x27;s early, middle or late periods, are in a slow or fairly slow tempo. Ponder comments that Coates&#x27;s last songs were on a grander scale, perhaps influenced by the big numbers in West End and Broadway shows.

Coates chose texts by a wide range of authors, including Shakespeare, Christina Rossetti, Arthur Conan Doyle; among those whose words he set most often were Weatherly, Phyllis Black (Mrs Coates), and Royden Barrie. On one occasion he wrote his own words: &quot;A Bird&#x27;s Lullaby&quot; (1911).

===Other music===
Coates always conceived his music in orchestral terms, even when writing for solo voice and piano. Despite his background as a member of three string quartets, he composed little chamber music. &quot;Grove&quot; lists five such works by Coates, three of which are lost. The two surviving pieces are a minuet for string quartet from 1908, and &quot;First Meeting&quot; (1941) for viola and piano. Similarly, although he learned a substantial part of his craft while playing in theatre orchestras, Coates wrote no musical shows. When he toured with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducting his own music, in 1940, the reviewer in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; urged him to find a librettist and write a comic opera: &quot;He ought to succeed greatly in that line. He is quick-witted, has a gift for lilting melody, deals in spicy and exhilarating harmony, and scores his music with a brilliancy that tells of experienced craftsmanship&quot;. Coates did not follow the paper&#x27;s advice. His biographer Geoffrey Self suggests that he simply lacked the stamina, the aggressiveness or possibly the inclination to write for the musical theatre.

The few ventures Coates made into drama were for the cinema rather than the theatre. His orchestral phantasy &quot;Cinderella&quot; was first heard in the film &quot;A Symphony in Two Flats&quot;, and he contributed the &quot;Eighth Army March&quot; to the 1941 war film &quot;Nine Men&quot; and the &quot;High Flight March&quot; to &quot;High Flight&quot; (1957). As noted above, his most celebrated piece of cinema music, &quot;The Dam Busters March&quot;, was not written specially for the film. With these exceptions, Coates declined the offers from producers in Britain and the US who continually sought to secure his services. He realised that film music is liable to be cut, rearranged, or otherwise changed to meet the requirements of directors, and, mindful of such difficulties encountered by Arthur Bliss in composing the score for &quot;Things to Come&quot;, he did not wish his music to be subjected to similar treatment.

<text>Ernest Francisco Fenollosa (February 18, 1853 – September 21, 1908) was an American art historian of Japanese art, professor of philosophy and political economy at Tokyo Imperial University. An important educator during the modernization of Japan during the Meiji Era, Fenollosa was an enthusiastic Orientalist who did much to preserve traditional Japanese art.

==Biography==

Fenollosa was born in 1853 as the son of Manuel Francisco Ciriaco Fenollosa, a Spanish pianist born in Málaga in 1818, and Mary Silsbee, a member of a prominent family in
Boston. He attended public schools in his hometown of Salem, Massachusetts before studying philosophy and sociology at Harvard College, where he graduated in 1874.

He studied for a year at the art school of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, during which time he married Elizabeth Goodhue Millett (1853–1920). In 1878 he was invited to Japan by American zoologist and Orientalist Edward S. Morse. Fenollosa taught political economy and philosophy at the Imperial University at Tokyo. There he also studied ancient temples, shrines and art treasures with his assistant, Okakura Kakuzō.

During his time in Japan, Fenollosa helped create the &quot;nihonga&quot; (Japanese) style of painting with Japanese artists Kanō Hōgai (1828–1888) and Hashimoto Gahō (1835–1908). In May 1882 he delivered a lecture on &quot;An Explanation of the Truth of Art&quot;, which was widely circulated and quoted.

One of his students was the creator of judo, Kanō Jigorō.

After eight years at the university, Fenollosa helped found the Tokyo School of Fine Arts and the Tokyo Imperial Museum. He served as director of the latter in 1888. In this period, he helped to draft the text of a law for the preservation of temples and shrines and their art treasures.

Deeply influenced by living in Japan, Fenollosa converted to Buddhism; he was given the name Teishin. He was also granted the name Kano Eitan Masanobu, placing him in the lineage of the Kanō school, who had served as painters to the Tokugawa shoguns. While resident in Japan, Fenollosa conducted the first inventory of Japan&#x27;s national treasures. This resulted in the discovery of ancient Chinese scrolls, which had been brought to Japan by traveling monks centuries earlier. He was able to rescue many Buddhist artifacts that would otherwise have been destroyed under the Haibutsu kishaku movement. For these achievements, the Emperor Meiji of Japan decorated Fenollosa with the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Sacred Treasures.

Fenollosa amassed a large personal collection of Japanese art during his stay in Japan. In 1886, he sold his art collection to Boston physician Charles Goddard Weld (1857–1911) on the condition that it go to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. In 1890 he returned to Boston to serve as curator of the department of Oriental Art. There Fenollosa was asked to choose Japanese art for display at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. He also organized Boston&#x27;s first exhibition of Chinese painting in 1894. In 1896, he published &quot;Masters of Ukiyoe&quot;, a historical account of Japanese paintings and ukiyo-e prints exhibited at the New York Fine Arts Building.

When he divorced his wife, his immediate remarriage in 1895 to writer Mary McNeill Scott (1865–1954) outraged Boston society. Fenollosa was dismissed from the Museum in 1896.

He returned to Japan in 1897 to accept a position as Professor of English Literature at the Tokyo Higher Normal School at Tokyo. Lafcadio Hearn considered Fenollosa a friend; and Hearn almost believed that he visited the professor&#x27;s home too often.

In 1900, Fenollosa returned to the United States to write and lecture on Asia. He died of a heart attack during a visit to London in 1908. His body was briefly interred on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery, in London, but later cremated. According to his wishes, his ashes were returned for burial to the Hōmyō-in chapel of Mii-dera (where he had been tonsured), high above Lake Biwa. His tombstone was paid for by the Tokyo School of Fine Arts. 

Fenollosa&#x27;s widow entrusted his unpublished notes on Chinese poetry and Japanese Noh drama to noted American poet Ezra Pound. Together with William Butler Yeats, Pound used the notes to stimulate the growing interest in Far Eastern literature among modernist writers. Pound subsequently finished Fenollosa&#x27;s work with the aid of Arthur Waley, the noted British sinologist. Concentrating on Japanese art before 1800, it was published in two volumes in 1912. Fenollosa offered Hokusai&#x27;s prints as a window of beauty after Japanese art had become too modern for his own taste: &quot;Hokusai is a great designer, as Kipling and Whitman are great poets. He has been called the Dickens of Japan.&quot; 

Arthur Wesley Dow said of Fenollosa that &quot;he was gifted with a brilliant mind of great analytical power, this with a rare appreciation gave him an insight into the nature of fine art such as few ever attain&quot;.

==Criticism==
At a Harvard lecture of 2011, Benjamin Elman refers to the &quot;Epochs of the Chinese and Japanese Art&quot; (1912) where Fenollosa compares &quot;degeneration&quot; of the late imperial Chinese art to that which befell the high antique art of Europe in Byzantium (&quot;the poorest of the Byzantine mosaics&quot;; &quot;the only hope for the hopeless is to perceive itself to be hopeless&quot;). According to Elman, Fenollosa&#x27;s perception was influenced by the political and military defeats of the Qing empire.

<text>Gabrovo Province ( (Oblast Gabrovo), former name Gabrovo okrug) is a small province lying at the geographical centre of Bulgaria. It is named after its main town - Gabrovo. In 2009 the total population of the area was 130,001.

==Municipalities==

The Gabrovo province (област, &quot;oblast&quot;) contains four municipalities (singular: община, &quot;obshtina&quot; - plural: общини, &quot;obshtini&quot;). The following table shows the names of each municipality in English and Cyrillic, the main town (in bold) or village, and the population of each as of 2009.

==Demographics==
The Gabrovo province had a population of 144,150 (144,125 also given) according to a 2001 census, of which were male and were female.
As of the end of 2009, the population of the province, announced by the Bulgarian National Statistical Institute, numbered 130,001 of which are inhabitants aged over 60 years.

Ethnic groups (2021 census):
*Bulgarians: 89,394 (90.86%)
*Turks: 4,723 (4.80%)
*Romani: 735 (0.75%)
*Others and indefinable: 3,535 (3.59%)

===Religion===
Religious adherence in the province according to 2001 census:
==Main city==
Gabrovo is the main city of the Province of Gabrovo. Long known for producing leather articles and textiles that earned the town the sobriquet of the “Manchester of Bulgaria”, Gabrovo is a charmingly laid-back provincial place.

To the Bulgarians, Gabrovo is mainly known as the home of Humour and Satire, which opened on Aprils Fool’s Day 1972 in recognition of the position traditionally occupied by the town in the Bulgarian humour. People in every country tell jokes about the supposed miserliness of a particular community, and in Bulgaria the butt of the jokes has always been Gabrovo.

A Festival of Humour and Satire takes place in May, comprising masked actors, folk music, animated cartoons and the giving of prizes. There are plenty of restaurants in the city itself but the local people will recommend that you go out of town and visit Bozhentsi and the Etara complex.

==Bozhentsi and Etara==

Bozhentsi is preserved as an old village museum. There is an ethnographic open-air museum, Etara, nearby. Strung out along the valley, with its clear bubbling stream and rich bird-life, the Etara complex has the look and feel of a film set, and even though it is artificial, it is nonetheless convincing and a joy to explore.

Traditionally crafts were inseparable from the charshya (bazaar), and the reconstructed bazaar of the type once common in Bulgarian towns forms the heart of the open-air museum. Throughout much of the day artisans are at work here, hammering blades, throwing pots, carving bowls and the like, and everything they make is for sale. Note that many of the artisans leave an hour or so before the complex officially closes.

Even if your interest in crafts is minimal it’s difficult not to admire the interiors of the old houses, which achieve great beauty through the skilful use of simple materials. Besides dwellings and workshops, the bazaar includes a couple of places for grabbing a quick drink, including a traditional café, and a bakery selling Turkish delight and many other sweet treats.

An hour or so walk southwest from Etara, Sokolsky Monastery perches on a crag above the village of Voditsi. During Ottoman times the monks offered succour to Bulgarian outlaws and an assembly point during the uprising against the Turks in 1876. Nowadays it is a discreet, little-visited place, with rosebushes and privet shrubs laid out in a courtyard dominated by an octagonal stone fountain.

==Tourism==
Places of interest in Gabrovo province include architectural reserve Bozhentsi. Hiking is widely available in the Central Balkan National Park and in the Bulgarka Nature Park, itself home to Etar Architectural-Ethnographic Complex, Dryanovo Monastery, Sokolski Monastery, Shipka Pass, and the Uzana area. For admirers of historical tourism the Shipka Freedom Memorial is a must-see.

<doc id="589065" wikidata="Q275442" url="?curid=589065" title="Volkswagen Gol">
<text>The Volkswagen Gol is a subcompact car that was manufactured by Volkswagen do Brasil from 1980 to 2023 as Volkswagen&#x27;s entry-level car in the Latin American market—where it succeeded the Volkswagen Type 1 (Fusca) and the Volkswagen Brasilia. Several variants of the Gol-derived Voyage and Parati were marketed in North America as the [[Volkswagen Fox]] from 1987 to 1993.

The Gol has been produced in several variants, such as three- and five-door hatchbacks, two- and four-door sedans (the Volkswagen Voyage), three- and five-door station wagons (the Volkswagen Parati), and two-door single and extra-cab coupé utilities (the Volkswagen Saveiro).

The Gol was the best-selling car in Brazil for 27 consecutive years, from 1987 to 2014, and has been the most popular car in Argentina since 1988; approximately five million Gols have been manufactured in South America since 1980. In March 2013 it was announced that cumulative production of the Gol and its derivatives (Voyage, Saveiro, Parati) had reached 10 million units. It takes its name from the Portuguese (and Spanish) word for goal in football, taking advantage of the Brazilians&#x27; passion for the sport.

Following a continuous production for 43 years, the production of the Gol ended in 2023. A downgraded version of the Volkswagen Polo called the Polo Track became its replacement.

==Body styles==
The Gol family contains several body styles. The three- and five-door hatchback variants are known as the Volkswagen Gol in most markets, with the exception of Egypt and Russia, where they are marketed as the Volkswagen Pointer. The first-generation Gol was available only as a three-door hatchback; all generations since have offered a five-door variant as well.

The sedan has only been produced for the first and third (current) generations. The Brazilian-built sedans were marketed as the Volkswagen Voyage, while the Argentinian ones were referred to as the Volkswagen Gacel. In the United States and Canada, they were sold as the Volkswagen Fox. After a facelift in 1991, Argentinian-built, entry-level models were renamed the Volkswagen Senda. In the second generation this model was replaced by the Volkswagen Polo Mk3 Classic, which was still sold in Mexico and Argentina. But a new Voyage notchback sedan returned in 2008 for the third generation.

Volkswagen Parati is a station wagon built on both generations since May 1982. The Parati I was a three-door sold in North America as the Fox Wagon. The second-generation Parati is sold in Argentina as the Gol Country. A five-door version was added in 1997 and the three-door version was dropped after the first facelift (G3). It is named after Paraty, a city on the southern coast of Rio de Janeiro state. It was formerly called Pointer Station Wagon in Mexico and it was sold there between 1999 and 2005. In 2013, The Parati was discontinued alongside the Gol G4 and was replaced by the SpaceFox.

Volkswagen Saveiro is a lightweight pickup truck. All Gol generations have been sold with this bodystyle, which was introduced to the market in 1983. It is named after a traditional Brazilian fishing boat. It is currently sold in Mexico since 1999 as the Pointer Pick Up.

== First generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 30, 1980) ==
The Gol was released in 1980 to replace the Brasilia, which was in turn a replacement for the Beetle on the Brazilian market. It was based on its own unique BX platform derived from the existing VW/Audi B1 and B2 platforms. With a design specific to Latin America, the Gol featured the 1.3-liter air-cooled, flat-four engine from the Beetle, but front-mounted. A 1.6-liter engine was added later. The Voyage two-door sedan variant of the Gol was released in June 1981 and received a 1.5-liter inline water-cooled gasoline engine instead. The same engine was offered with an ethanol option. In 1985, the air-cooled engine of the Gol was replaced by a 1.6-liter (and later 1.8-liter as well) longitudinally-mounted water-cooled gasoline inline-four engine from the Passat. By May 1982 the Voyage 1.5 was upgraded to 1.6. In 1984 a water-cooled Voyage 1.8 (&quot;Super&quot;) was launched as a higher-level option. A 1.6-liter diesel engine was made, although only for export as diesel engines are not allowed in passenger cars in the Brazilian market.

In January 1983 a four-door Voyage sedan was released. It was known as the VW Amazon in some export markets, later as the Fox in North America. The four-door Voyage was built in the Autolatina Pacheco factory in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 1983 to 1994. It was sold under the name Gacel (later also as the Senda) with the Argentine-built 1.6 OHC engine with a carburettor, later also with a diesel 1.6.
The first generation (or &quot;G1&quot;) Gol had two mild facelifts for 1987 and 1991. The 1989 Gol GTi was the first Brazilian-built car to use fuel injection. The 2.0-liter inline-four engine was the same used by the Santana. In 1991, as a result of changes to the tax laws in Brazil, a flurry of cars with engines under one liters appeared. Fiat was first (with the Fiat Mille), and Volkswagen quickly responded with the spartan Gol 1000. It had a Ford-developed 997 cc engine (a result of their recent Autolatina joint venture) with and was not available in any other bodystyle. Between 1990 and 1995, the Ford CHT 1.6 replaced the original 1.6 in the range, also as a result of the Autolatina lineup.

===Sports versions===

====GT 1.8 (1984–1986)====
The Gol GT 1.8 was the BX family&#x27;s first sports version and an answer to the Ford Escort XR3, a successful sports car in Brazilian market. With a 1.8 liter engine borrowed from Santana (MkII Passat), the Gol GT was much faster than the Escort XR3, but externally did not have the same beauty. The first series still had a four-speed manual gearbox, but soon this was changed to a five-speed unit.

====GTS 1.8 (1987–1994)====
Successor of Gol GT, the GTS had an updated design, following the new 87 BX line up style and also featuring new accessories that were not available before, such as rear spoiler and side skirts. The 1.8 liter engine produced running on gasoline or running on ethanol. The GTS was a very successful model and was kept in production alongside the upcoming GTI.

====GTI 2000 (1989–1994)====
Known as the first Brazilian built car equipped with electronic fuel injection, the Gol GTI was presented in January 1989 and featured a larger 2.0 liter engine with power of running only on gasoline. Claimed top speed is . This engine was the same as used in the larger Santana, albeit fitted with fuel injection for the GTI.

===North America===

Volkswagen Group of America marketed variants of the Gol (manufactured by Volkswagen do Brasil) in North America as entry-level models from February 1987 until 1994 under the &quot;Volkswagen Fox&quot; nameplate. It was intended to provide Volkswagen dealers with a competitor to the then very successful Hyundai Excel and Yugo low-price cars. Initially offered as a two-door and four-door sedan as well as a two-door wagon, the wagon was discontinued for model year 1991 along with the two-door sedan for the Canadian market. That same year the remaining Fox versions received a mild restyling.

All North American models employed a longitudinally-mounted inline-four 1.8 L gasoline engine producing at 5,500 rpm and of torque at 3,250 rpm.

Early models (1987–1989) featured Bosch CIS-E type Jetronic electro-mechanical fuel injection, using an oxygen sensor to assist in fuel management. Later models (1990–1994) employed Bosch Digifant electronic fuel injection. In Canada from 1987–1989 it was offered with the simpler Bosch CIS fuel injection system without an oxygen sensor for the engine fuel management system.

Over the course of its model history, trim levels included base Fox, GL, GTS, GLS, GL Sport, Polo, and a Wolfsburg Edition. Options included air conditioning, five-speed (vs. four) manual transmission and metallic paint. No automatic transmission was offered. The GL trim featured revised cloth trim, rear license plate backing, ceiling-mounted map light, glove compartment light, trunk light, tachometer (excepting wagon models), body-colored bumpers, hubcaps, passenger side exterior rear view mirror, 175/70-13 tires, locking gas cap and three-point rear seat belts.

The 1991 facelift included revised grille, headlights, turn signals, badges, and hubcaps, as well as reduction of towing hooks from four to two. Later US models featured &quot;automatic&quot; non-motorized front seat shoulder belts along with a knee-bar and manual front lap belts, while the Canadian models have kept the manual pillar-mounted front seat belts.
== Second generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 37/5X/5W, 1994) ==
The second generation (or &quot;G2&quot;) Gol, known as &quot;Project AB9&quot; during development, debuted in September 1994. It was still based on the BX platform, and is very different from the earlier model, with an updated body and longer wheelbase than the 1980 original. Nicknamed &quot;Gol Bolinha&quot; (roughly &quot;Rounded Gol&quot; or &quot;Bubble Gol&quot;), the previous generation started to be nicknamed as &quot;Gol Quadrado&quot;, &quot;Squared Gol&quot;. The new version was an answer to the then newly released Chevrolet Corsa.

The Gol G2 was available in the following versions: 1000i, 1000i Plus, CL, GL, Furgão (Van) and GTi (this was fitted with an 8-valve engine until 1996, when a more powerful, German-built 16-valve version replaced it), with 1.0, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 liter engines. The 1.0 was supplied by Ford, as part of the &quot;AutoLatina&quot; collaboration. The Gol G2 also had two special editions. The first, &quot;Gol Rolling Stones&quot;, was in 1995 - commemorating that band&#x27;s &quot;Voodoo Lounge Tour&quot; leg in Brazil. Then, the following year came &quot;Gol Atlanta&quot; (after the Olympic Games). In November 1996, Volkswagen began to produce its own 1.0 engine, called the AT-1000. This version was derived from their larger 1.6 (999 cc).
As the Ford-built engine had been in limited supply, Volkswagen could now ramp up production of their entry level Gols beginning in January 1997. There were also 16 valve versions of the 1.0 AT-1000 engine launched in September 1996. The 1.0 16V has , up from in the eight-valve version. In 1995 the Autolatina partnership was dissolved. In 1998, a 1.9 liter diesel engine was installed in the Gol G2, only sold in markets outside of Brazil.

Also this version of Gol had some chronic deficiencies of design, such as bad alignment of body parts, due to problems with the robots on the assembly line, and poor quality of plastic parts. A curious fact about this version of Gol is that the driver&#x27;s seat is not well aligned with the steering wheel and pedals, causing a rather uncomfortable driving position. Another surprise was Volkswagen&#x27;s original decision to sell the Gol and Parati (station wagon) only in three-door version, a step which was not appreciated by buyers. Fiat took the top spot in the Brazilian market for the last months of 1997, but once Volkswagen released quickly developed five-door models the Gol and Parati propelled Volkswagen back into first place in early 1998.

===G3 and G4 facelifts===

The second-generation Gol received two facelifts, which include both cosmetic and engine upgrades.

The first upgrade, in 1999 for 2000 model, was known as the Gol G3 (photo) in Brazil and had a new VW &#x27;corporate&#x27; front end similar to the Jetta/Bora IV. The Gol G3 came with optional airbags and ABS brakes. The previous (G2) Gol 1.0 continued to be available as the &quot;Gol Special&quot;, to fight for the lowest end of the market. Following the Mercosur economic crisis beginning with the Brazilian devaluation in 1999, the lineup was reduced in 2002. The 2.0 16V was discontinued, while the 1.8 was withdrawn from some markets. Argentinian production of the Gol was halted in 2003. Instead the engines at the bottom of the lineup were improved, with a 1.0 16V Turbo with a 1.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine released in 2000.

When the 2005 (G4) Gol was released with styling cues from the Volkswagen Fox, incorporating the &quot;V Grill&quot;, most avid automotive enthusiasts were unimpressed with the leap backwards in interior design. The G4 stayed in production until 2013, and was finally discontinued in 2015.

===Gol Total Flex===

The flexible fuel vehicle Gol Total Flex, available since 2003, was the first of its kind in South America. Its introduction followed a rehabilitation of the use of alcohol to power automobiles.

===Pointer (Mexico)===

The Gol G2 was introduced in Mexico in spring 1998 as the Volkswagen Pointer (a name previously used in Latin America for a rebadged model based on the Ford Escort Mk V, the Pointer/Logus). The only version for this year was a three-door hatchback with a 1.8 liter, engine and a five-speed manual gearbox. The only extra cost option available was a package compounding air conditioning and power steering. For 1999, a five-door wagon version, the Brazilian Parati (called the Pointer Station Wagon in Mexico) and the Saveiro (called the Pointer Pick Up) are added. They were marketed in three trim levels: Base, Comfort (A/C and power steering) and Luxe (14&quot; alloy wheels, power windows and remote control centralized door locks, A/C and power steering). For 2000 the Pointer received the same facelift as in Brazil and a sporty Pointer GTI based on the Brazilian Gol GTI is introduced. It was a three-door hatchback with a 2.0 liter, engine. It had AM/FM/Cassette radio, alloy wheels, all around disc brakes, and sporty black seats as standard equipment. In 2002 a basic Pointer City version is introduced, the former Comfort version is renamed the Trendline, and the Luxe variant as the Comfortline. In 2005 the Pointer Station Wagon and the Pointer GTI are discontinued and the former Pointer trims (but the City) are replaced by a new Pointer Mi version.

In the model year 2007, the Pointer receives the newest facelift, and its versions are reorganized. The Pointer is currently marketed as the Base, A/C (Air Conditioning, power steering and rear wiper/washer), Trendline (Radio AM/FM Stereo CD, 15&quot; alloy wheels, fog lamps), and GT (only available as a five-door hatchback. It has the same equipment as the Trendline plus: rear headrests, 6 spoke 15&quot; alloy wheels, black accented headlamps, rear spoiler, and sport seats). The Pointer was replaced in December 2008 by the new Volkswagen Gol G5 which has been launched in Brazil in July 2008.

===Gol around the world===
As a result of a joint-venture with Kerman Khodro, the Gol has been built in Iran since 2003.

The Gol G3 was briefly sold in Russia in 2004-2006 as the Pointer, but the sales were soon discontinued due to low demand. The car was available with the 1.0-liter () and the 1.8-liter () engines.

The Gol G3 was also made and sold by Shanghai Volkswagen in China from February 2003 until 2008

It has also been sold in Egypt as the Volkswagen Pointer.

In Taiwan it was sold as Volkswagen Pointer, with only pick-up variant available.

== Third generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 5U, 2008) ==
The third generation of the Gol was released in Brazil, on 29 June 2008, as a 2009 model. Referred to before its launch as the &quot;Gol NF&quot; for &quot;Nachfolger&quot; or &quot;Neue Familie&quot; (German terms for &quot;successor&quot; and &quot;new family&quot; respectively), this model is marketed as the &quot;Novo Gol&quot;. However, it is no longer based on the BX platform, but shares Volkswagen&#x27;s PQ24 platform with the Fox and Polo, with some components from the PQ25 platform.

In Brazil, it was released in three and five-door hatchback version with the options of 1.0-liter or 1.6-liter flex engines. Its dimensions are 3.90 m in length, 1.66 m in width, 1.45 m in height with a wheelbase of 2.47 m, and luggage capacity of 285 liters. It is the first Gol to be offered with an automated manual transmission.

The advertisements were filmed in Los Angeles, California, featuring Sylvester Stallone and Gisele Bündchen.

Volkswagen High Torque (VHT) technology was introduced on the third generation Gol family. This new technology allows the flex engine to get the high torques at lower revs, the engines produce higher torques and horsepower on Ethanol fuel.

===Voyage===

Revealed in September 2008, the Voyage is the sedan variant of the current Gol and as such has the same running gear 1.0 and 1.6 liter VHT ethanol compatible engines. In several countries, the Voyage is called the Gol Sedan.

The Voyage is available in four versions on the Brazilian market; 1.0, 1.6, 1.6 Trend, and 1.6 Comfortline, all with standard with ABS brakes and dual front airbags.

The Voyage&#x27;s trunk can be electronically operated via a button on the dash or by pressing the keypad; the luggage capacity is 480 liters.

Production of the sedan bodystyle ended in Brazil in 1995 and resumed in 2008, so although this is only the second generation of the Voyage, it is called the G5 in line with the equivalent Gol hatchback.

===Saveiro===
In August 2009, VW Brazil revealed the third generation Saveiro utility. The new Saveiro is available with a standard cabin or an extended cabin, sharing the same wheelbase which is longer than that of the Gol and Voyage. The only available engine, the 1.6L VHT, carries over from the Gol and Voyage.

The most basic 1.6 specification has black bumpers and 14-inch steel wheels. The optional Trend package includes 14-inch alloy wheels and color-coded door handle and mirror covers; the top of the line is the Saveiro Trooper which has black-painted 15-inch alloy wheels.

Carrying capacity is for the standard cabin and for the extended cabin.

Even after the Gol and Voyage was discontinued in Brazil, the Saveiro pickup continued to be manufactured, undergoing a slight facelift in August 2023.

===Engine specifications===
* 1.0 L VHT: - Ethanol, producing - Ethanol, at 3,850 rpm
* 1.0 L MPI: - Ethanol, producing - Ethanol, at 3,000 rpm
* 1.6 L VHT: - Ethanol, producing - Ethanol, at 2,500 rpm
* 1.6 L MSI: - Ethanol, producing - Ethanol, at 3,000 rpm

===Facelifts===
The third generation of the Gol received a facelift in 2012, with more angular headlights and taillights, similar to the sixth-generation Volkswagen Jetta.

The model received another facelift in 2016, based on the fifth-generation Volkswagen Polo and the seventh-generation Volkswagen Golf. A new 1.0 liter three-cylinder was introduced, the same engine used on the Brazilian-specification Up! and Fox models, with the option of ethanol or gasoline, or a combination of both. The Rallye version based on the CrossFox with a 16-valve 1.6 liter four-cylinder was discontinued, leaving only the 8-valve 1.6 liter engine as an option to the 1.0 liter engine. The interior received a new dashboard and steering wheel similar to the Golf, with the option of a multimedia center with the navigation system, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and MirrorLink.

In 2018, the third generation of the Gol received the third facelift with the same front as the Gol Track. Most of the trims were discontinued, leaving only the 1.0 and 1.6, the 1.6 version is the first version available with an automatic transmission and the &quot;iMotion&quot; automated manual transmission option was removed due to reliability concerns.

In July 2018, the model received the 6-speed automatic transmission, attached to the 1.6 16v FlexFuel EA211 engine with 110/120hp.

==== First facelift (2012-2016) ====
==== Second facelift (2016-2018) ====
==== Third facelift (2018-2023) ====
=== Safety ===
The Gol has been rated as highly unsafe by Latin NCAP, the 2009 model in its most basic Latin American market configuration with no airbags scoring only one star for adult occupants and two stars for children. Its airbag-equipped version scored three stars. No ESP is offered, but since 2014, Brazilian law requires ABS brakes and dual front airbags in all new vehicles.

Since January 2022, the Gol is banned from sale in Argentina following the entry into force of the law prohibiting the sale of new vehicles not equipped with ESP. Volkswagen has been very critical of the new law to make this active safety equipment mandatory. By refusing to equip the Gol with ESP, Volkswagen had to stop marketing the model in Argentina, even though it was the third best-selling passenger car on the local market in 2021.

== Discontinuation ==
Production of the Gol ended in late 2022. A Last Edition model for the 2023 model year with exterior upgraded was released in Brazil, with production limited to 1,000 units. It will be replaced with a less equipped version of the Polo Mk6, which was introduced as the Polo Track in November 2022.

<doc id="589086" wikidata="Q758069" url="?curid=589086" title="Attila (clothing)">
<text>The attila is an elaborately braided Hungarian shell-jacket or short coat, decorated with lace and knots. Historically it was part of the uniform of the Hungarian cavalry known as hussars (or huszárs). It was a part of the everyday wear of rural men as well as members of the nobility and officials.

The attila was made in many styles and many colors including black, gray, blue, green, red and white. Some of these overlapped with the Turkish dolman.
The origins of the attila are believed to go back to the 16th century when Hungarians adopted the practice of wearing their short coats slung on one shoulder. When worn in this fashion the jacket was often referred to as a &quot;pelisse&quot;. In cold or wet weather the attila could be buttoned across the chest and worn as a conventional jacket.

One possibly mythical account, reported by an English general, is that one night a Hungarian cavalry unit was attacked by the Turks and had no time to dress properly. Instead they just threw on their short coats half shouldered and went into battle. Supposedly the Turks on seeing the &quot;flying sleeves of the short coats&quot;, thought that they were fighting men who had more than two arms, and fled.

Other accounts suggest that Hungarian hussars wore their short coat slung over one shoulder to provide limited protection from glancing sword blows. Earlier Hungarian horsemen had used slung animal skins as a shield in this way. After 1850 the Austro-Hungarian cavalry attila became longer. In 1892 the attila also became part of the Hungarian forester&#x27;s ceremonial uniform. It was dark green or black with seven golden braids and golden buttons. During the late 18th and 19th centuries hussar regiments were raised in many European and Latin American armies and the fur trimmed pelisse, worn over a braided attila or dolman, often continued to be worn in the slung fashion described. By the mid-19th century the attila had become part of the ceremonial uniform of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army

Michael Kovats, the Hungarian hussar, who recruited, trained, organized, and led some of the first American cavalry into battle, wore an attila as part of his uniform.

<text>Yambol (, &quot;oblast Yambol&quot;, former name Yambol okrug) is a province in southeastern Bulgaria, neighbouring Turkey to the south. It is named after its main city Yambol, while other towns include Straldzha, Bolyarovo and Elhovo. The province embraces a territory of that is divided into five municipalities with a total population, as of December 2009, of 138,429.

==Municipalities==

The Yambol province (област, &quot;oblast&quot;) contains five municipalities (общини, &quot;obshtini&quot;; singular: община, &quot;obshtina&quot;). The following table shows the names of each municipality in English and Cyrillic, the main town or village (towns are shown in bold), and the population of each as of December 2009.

==History and background==
The motto of the town of Yambol is &quot;Coming from the remote past, going to the future&quot;. Archaeological findings in the area date back to the year 6000 BC, to the time of Roman Emperor Diocletian&#x27;s reign when the castle, called Diospolis, was built on the location of the present modern town. The best preserved historical sites, dating back to the fifteenth century, are the bazar &quot;Bezisten&quot; and the mosque &quot;Esky Djamia&quot;, which have been restored and are functioning at present. Other historical sites of interest are the prehistoric tumulus by the village of Drama, the remains of Yambol Mediaeval castle and the Monastery of the Middle Ages in Voden.

Yambol is home to the ancient settlement of Kabile, a national archaeological reserve and a nature preserved site, being the most important Thracian settlement in Bulgaria. In modern study of ancient Thrace it has already been proved that Kabile was the most prominent political, economic and religious centre from the first millennium BC. The archaeological investigations of the ancient city that have taken place in the last thirty years have revealed a great number of artefacts (stone inscriptions, coins, ceramic ware and remains of building activities) dating from times over a millennium long history. Most of the discovered artefacts have already been published and used as a data for archaeological and historical studies.

==Demographics==
The Yambol province had a population of 156,080 (156,070 also given) according to a 2001 census, of which were male and were female.
As of the end of 2009, the population of the province, announced by the Bulgarian National Statistical Institute, numbered 138,429 of which are inhabitants aged over 60 years.

===Ethnic groups===
Total population (2011 census): 131 447&lt;br&gt;
Ethnic groups (2011 census):
Identified themselves: 123 062 persons:
*Bulgarians: 106 884 (86,85%)
*Romani: 10 433 (8,48%)
*Turks: 3 600 (2,93%)
*Others and indefinable: 2 145 (1,74%)

===Religion===

Religious adherence in the province according to 2001 census:
==Famous residents==
Yambol is the native place of popular artists George Papazov and John Popov and sumo wrestler Aoiyama. The computer inventor John Atanasoff has family roots in the district – his father was born in a village Boyadjik, which is near Yambol.

==Topology and natural resources==
The Tundja River, the fourth of its size with an earth embankment, flows through the district, and mineral water wells are found near the village of Stefan Caradjovo. The territory of the area covers the middle part of the river valley, the Bakadjitsi, parts of the Svetiliiski, Derventski and Manastirski uplands, with the hilly plain relief predominating 100–150m above sea level. The northern areas of Tundja valley are characterized by a transcontinental climate, while the southern parts have a typical continental/Mediterranean climate. The average annual temperatures are between 12 and 12.5 °C.
Agricultural lands take 76.9% of the whole district territory, and the forests 15.5% of it. The wood resources include elm, willow, poplar and oak.

<text>France is one of the five &quot;Nuclear Weapons States&quot; under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, but is not known to possess or develop any chemical or biological weapons. France is the only member of the European Union to possess independent (non-NATO) nuclear weapons. 
France was the fourth country to test an independently developed nuclear weapon, doing so in 1960 under the government of Charles de Gaulle. The French military is currently thought to retain a weapons stockpile of around 300 operational (deployed) nuclear warheads, making it the fourth-largest in the world, speaking in terms of warheads, not megatons. The weapons are part of the country&#x27;s &quot;Force de dissuasion&quot;, developed in the late 1950s and 1960s to give France the ability to distance itself from NATO while having a means of nuclear deterrence under sovereign control.

France did not sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which gave it the option to conduct further nuclear tests until it signed and ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 and 1998 respectively. France denies currently having chemical weapons, ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in 1995, and acceded to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) in 1984. France had also ratified the Geneva Protocol in 1926.

==History==
France was one of the nuclear pioneers, going back to the work of Marie Skłodowska Curie and Henri Becquerel. French Professor Frédéric Joliot-Curie, High Commissioner for Atomic Energy from 1945 to 1950 and Curie&#x27;s son in law, told the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; that the 1945 Smyth Report wrongfully omitted the contributions of French scientists.

After World War II France&#x27;s former position of leadership suffered greatly because of the instability of the Fourth Republic, and the lack of finance available. During the Second World War Bertrand Goldschmidt invented the now-standard method for extracting plutonium while working as part of the British/Canadian team participating in the Manhattan Project. But after the Liberation in 1945, France had to start its own program almost from scratch. Nevertheless, the first French reactor went critical in 1948 and small amounts of plutonium were extracted in 1949. There was no formal commitment to a nuclear weapons program at that time, although plans were made to build reactors for the large scale production of plutonium. Francis Perrin, French High-Commissioner for Atomic Energy from 1951 to 1970, stated that from 1949 Israeli scientists were invited to the Saclay Nuclear Research Centre, this cooperation leading to a joint effort including sharing of knowledge between French and Israeli scientists especially those with knowledge from the Manhattan Project, the French believed that cooperation with Israel could give them access to international Jewish nuclear scientists. According to Lieutenant Colonel Warner D. Farr in a report to the USAF Counterproliferation Center while France was previously a leader in nuclear research &quot;Israel and France were at a similar level of expertise after the war, and Israeli scientists could make significant contributions to the French effort. Progress in nuclear science and technology in France and Israel remained closely linked throughout the early fifties. Farr reported that Israeli scientists probably helped construct the G-1 plutonium production reactor and UP-1 reprocessing plant at Marcoule.&quot;

However, in the 1950s a civilian nuclear research program was started, a byproduct of which would be plutonium. In December of 1954, Prime Minister Pierre Mendes-France met with his cabinet, authorizing the foundation of a program with the goal of developing French nuclear weapons. In 1956 a secret Committee for the Military Applications of Atomic Energy was formed and a development program for delivery vehicles was started. The intervention of the United States in the Suez Crisis that year is credited with convincing France that it needed to accelerate its own nuclear weapons program to remain a global power. As part their military alliance during the Suez Crisis in 1956 the French agreed to secretly build the Dimona nuclear reactor in Israel and soon after agreed to construct a reprocessing plant for the extraction of plutonium at the site. In 1957, soon after Suez and the resulting diplomatic tension with both the Soviet Union and the United States, French president René Coty decided on the creation of the C.S.E.M. in the then French Sahara, a new nuclear testing facility replacing the CIEES.

In 1957 Euratom was created, and under cover of the peaceful use of nuclear power the French signed deals with West Germany and Italy to work together on nuclear weapons development. The Chancellor of West Germany Konrad Adenauer told his cabinet that he &quot;wanted to achieve, through EURATOM, as quickly as possible, the chance of producing our own nuclear weapons&quot;. The idea was short-lived. In 1958 de Gaulle became President and Germany and Italy were excluded.

With the return of Charles de Gaulle to the presidency of France in the midst of the May 1958 crisis, the final decisions to build an atomic bomb were taken, and a successful test took place in 1960 with Israeli scientists as observers at the tests and unlimited access to the scientific data. Following tests de Gaulle moved quickly to distance the French program from involvement with that of Israel. Since then France has developed and maintained its own nuclear deterrent, one intended to defend France even if the United States refused to risk its own cities by assisting Western Europe in a nuclear war.

The United States began providing technical assistance to the French program in the early 1970s through the 1980s. The aid was secret, unlike the relationship with the British nuclear program. The Nixon administration, unlike previous presidencies, did not oppose its allies&#x27; possession of atomic weapons and believed that the Soviets would find having multiple nuclear-armed Western opponents more difficult. Because the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 prohibited sharing information on nuclear weapon design, a method known as &quot;negative guidance&quot; or &quot;Twenty Questions&quot; was used; French scientists described to their U.S. counterparts their research, and were told whether they were correct. Areas in which the French received help included MIRV, radiation hardening, missile design, intelligence on Soviet anti-missile defences, and advanced computer technology. Because the French program attracted &quot;the best brains&quot; of the nation, the U.S. benefited from French research as well. The relationship also improved the two countries&#x27; military ties; despite its departure from NATO&#x27;s command structure in 1966, France developed two separate nuclear targeting plans, one &quot;national&quot; for the &quot;Force de Frappe&quot;&#x27;s role as a solely French deterrent, and one coordinated with NATO.

France is understood to have tested neutron or enhanced radiation bombs in the past, apparently leading the field with an early test of the technology in 1967 and an &quot;actual&quot; neutron bomb in 1980.

==Testing==
There were 210 French nuclear tests from 1960 through 1996. Seventeen of them were done in the Algerian Sahara between 1960 and 1966, starting in the middle of the Algerian War. One-hundred ninety-three were carried out in French Polynesia.

A summary table of French nuclear testing by year can be read at this article: List of nuclear weapons tests of France.

===Saharan experiments centres (1960–66)===

After studying Réunion, New Caledonia, and Clipperton Island, General Charles Ailleret, head of the Special Weapons Section, proposed two possible nuclear test sites for France in a January 1957 report: French Algeria in the Sahara Desert, and French Polynesia. Although he recommended against Polynesia because of its distance from France and lack of a large airport, Ailleret stated that Algeria should be chosen &quot;provisionally&quot;, likely due in part to the Algerian War.

A series of atmospheric nuclear tests was conducted by the &quot;Centre Saharien d&#x27;Expérimentations Militaires&quot; (&quot;Saharan Military Experiments Centre&quot;) from February 1960 until April 1961. The first, called &quot;Gerboise Bleue&quot; (&quot;Blue jerboa&quot;) took place on 13 February 1960 in Algeria. The explosion took place at 40 km from the military base at Hammoudia near Reggane, which is the last town on the Tanezrouft Track heading south across the Sahara to Mali, and 700 km/435 mi. south of Béchar. The device had a 70 kiloton yield. Although Algeria became independent in 1962, France was able to continue with underground nuclear tests in Algeria through 1966. The General Pierre Marie Gallois was named &quot;le père de la bombe A&quot; (&quot;Father of the A-bomb&quot;).

Three further atmospheric tests were carried out from 1 April 1960 to 25 April 1961 at Hammoudia. Military, workers and the nomadic Touareg population of the region were present at the test sites, without any significant protection. At most, some took a shower after each test according to &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;. Gerboise Rouge (5kt), the third atomic bomb, half as powerful as Little Boy, exploded on 27 December 1960, provoking protests from Japan, USSR, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria and Ghana.

After the independence of Algeria on 5 July 1962, following the 19 March 1962 Evian agreements, the French military moved the test site to another location in the Algerian Sahara, around 150 km north of Tamnarasset, near the village of In Eker. Underground nuclear explosion testing was performed in drifts in the Taourirt Tan Afella mountain, one of the granite Hoggar Mountains. The Evian agreements included a secret article which stated that &quot;Algeria concede[s]... to France the use of certain air bases, terrains, sites and military installations which are necessary to it [France]&quot; during five years.

The C.S.E.M. was therefore replaced by the &quot;Centre d&#x27;Expérimentations Militaires des Oasis&quot; (&quot;Military Experiments Center of the Oasis&quot;) underground nuclear testing facility. A total of 13 underground nuclear tests were carried out at the In Eker site from 7 November 1961 to 16 February 1966. By July 1, 1967, all French facilities were evacuated.

An accident happened on 1 May 1962, during the &quot;Béryl&quot; test, four times more powerful than Hiroshima and designed as an underground shaft test. Due to improper sealing of the shaft, radioactive rock and dust were released into the atmosphere. Nine soldiers of the 621st Groupe d&#x27;Armes Spéciales unit were heavily contaminated by radiation. The soldiers were exposed to as much as 600 mSv. The Minister of the Armed Forces, Pierre Messmer, and the Minister of Research, Gaston Palewski, were present. As many as 100 additional personnel, including officials, soldiers and Algerian workers were exposed to lower levels of radiation, estimated at about 50 mSv, when the radioactive cloud produced by the blast passed over the command post, due to an unexpected change in wind direction. They escaped as they could, often without wearing any protection. Palewski died in 1984 of leukemia, which he always attributed to the Béryl incident. In 2006, Bruno Barrillot, specialist of nuclear tests, measured 93 microsieverts by hour of gamma ray at the site, equivalent to 1% of the official admissible yearly dose. The incident was documented in the 2006 docudrama &quot;&quot;Vive La Bombe!&quot;.

===Saharan facilities===

===Pacific experiments centre (1966–1996)===
Despite its initial choice of Algeria for nuclear tests, the French government decided to build Faa&#x27;a International Airport in Tahiti, spending much more money and resources than would be justified by the official explanation of tourism. By 1958, two years before the first Sahara test, France began again its search for new testing sites due to potential political problems with Algeria and the possibility of a ban on above-ground tests. Many French overseas islands were studied, as well as performing underground tests in the Alps, Pyrenees, or Corsica; however, engineers found problems with most of the possible sites in metropolitan France.

By 1962 France hoped in its negotiations with the Algerian independence movement to retain the Sahara as a test site until 1968, but decided that it needed to be able to also perform above-ground tests of hydrogen bombs, which could not be done in Algeria. Mururoa and Fangataufa in French Polynesia were chosen that year. President Charles de Gaulle announced the choice on 3 January 1963, describing it as a benefit to Polynesia&#x27;s weak economy. The Polynesian people and leaders broadly supported the choice, although the tests became controversial after they began, especially among Polynesian separatists.

A total of 193 nuclear tests were carried out in Polynesia from 1966 to 1996. On 24 August 1968 France detonated its first thermonuclear weapon—codenamed Canopus—over Fangataufa. A fission device ignited a lithium-6 deuteride secondary inside a jacket of highly enriched uranium to create a 2.6 megaton blast.

===Simulation programme (1996–2012)===
More recently, France has used supercomputers to simulate and study nuclear explosions.

== Current nuclear doctrine and strategy ==

French law requires at least one out of four nuclear submarines to be on patrol in the Atlantic Ocean at any given time, like the UK&#x27;s policy.

In 2006, French President Jacques Chirac noted that France would be willing to use nuclear weapons against a state attacking France by terrorism. He noted that the French nuclear forces had been configured for this option.

On 21 March 2008, President Nicolas Sarkozy announced that France will reduce its aircraft deliverable nuclear weapon stockpile (which currently consists of 60 TN 81 warheads) by a third (20 warheads) and bring the total French nuclear arsenal to fewer than 300 warheads.

France decided not to sign the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.

==Anti-nuclear tests protests==

* In July 1959, after France announced that they would begin testing nuclear bombs in the Sahara, protests were held in Nigeria and Ghana, with the Liberian and Moroccan governments also denouncing the decision. On November 20, 1959 the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution supported by 26 Afro-Asian countries expressing concern and requesting &quot;France to refrain from such tests.&quot;
* By 1968 only France and China were detonating nuclear weapons in the open air and the contamination caused by the H-bomb blast led to a global protest movement against further French atmospheric tests.
* From the early 1960s New Zealand peace groups CND and the Peace Media had been organising nationwide anti-nuclear campaigns in protest of atmospheric testing in French Polynesia. These included two large national petitions presented to the New Zealand government which led to a joint New Zealand and Australian Government action to take France to the International Court of Justice (1972).
* In 1972, Greenpeace and an amalgam of New Zealand peace groups managed to delay nuclear tests by several weeks by trespassing with a ship in the testing zone. During the time, the skipper, David McTaggart, was beaten and severely injured by members of the French military.
* In 1973 the New Zealand Peace Media organised an international flotilla of protest yachts including the Fri, Spirit of Peace, Boy Roel, Magic Island and the Tanmure to sail into the test exclusion zone.
* In 1973, New Zealand Prime Minister Norman Kirk as a symbolic act of protest sent two navy frigates, HMNZS &quot;Canterbury&quot; and HMNZS &quot;Otago&quot;, to Moruroa. They were accompanied by HMAS &quot;Supply&quot;, a fleet oiler of the Royal Australian Navy.
* In 1985 the Greenpeace ship &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; was bombed and sunk by the French DGSE in Auckland, New Zealand, as it prepared for another protest of nuclear testing in French military zones. One crew member, Fernando Pereira of Portugal, photographer, drowned on the sinking ship while attempting to recover his photographic equipment. Two members of DGSE were captured and sentenced, but eventually repatriated to France in a controversial affair.
* French president Jacques Chirac’s decision to run a nuclear test series at Mururoa in 1995, just one year before the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was to be signed, caused worldwide protest, including an embargo of French wine. These tests were meant to provide the nation with enough data to improve further nuclear technology without needing additional series of tests.
* The French military conducted almost 200 nuclear tests at Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls over a thirty-year period ending in 1996, 46 of them atmospheric, of which five were without significant nuclear yield. In August 2006, an official French government report by INSERM confirmed the link between an increase in the cases of thyroid cancer and France’s atmospheric nuclear tests in the territory since 1966.

== Veterans&#x27; associations and symposium ==
An association gathering veterans of nuclear tests (AVEN, &quot;Association des vétérans des essais nucléaires&quot;) was created in 2001. Along with the Polynesian NGO Moruroa e tatou, the AVEN announced on 27 November 2002 that it would depose a complaint against X (unknown) for involuntary homicide and putting someone’s life in danger. On 7 June 2003, for the first time, the military court of Tours granted an invalidity pension to a veteran of the Sahara tests. According to a poll made by the AVEN with its members, only 12% have declared being in good health. An international symposium on the consequences of test carried out in Algeria took place on 13 and 14 February 2007, under the official oversight of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

One hundred fifty thousand civilians, without taking into account the local population, are estimated to have been on the location of nuclear tests, in Algeria or in French Polynesia. One French veteran of the 1960s nuclear tests in Algeria described being given no protective clothing or masks, while being ordered to witness the tests at so close a range that the flash penetrated through the arm he used to cover his eyes. One of several veteran’s groups claiming to organise those suffering ill effects, AVEN had 4,500 members in early 2009.

== Test victims compensation ==
In both Algeria and French Polynesia there have been long standing demands for compensation from those who claim injury from France’s nuclear testing program. The government of France had consistently denied, since the late 1960s, that injury to military personnel and civilians had been caused by their nuclear testing. Several French veterans and African and Polynesian campaign groups have waged court cases and public relations struggles demanding government reparations. In May 2009, a group of twelve French veterans, in the campaign group &quot;Truth and Justice&quot;, who claim to have suffered health effects from nuclear testing in the 1960s had their claims denied by the government Commission for the Indemnification of Victims of Penal Infraction (CIVI), and again by a Paris appeals court, citing laws which set a statute of limitations for damages to 1976. Following this rejection, the government announced it would create a 10m Euro compensation fund for military and civilian victims of its testing programme; both those carried out in the 1960s and the Polynesian tests of 1990–1996. Defence Minister Hervé Morin said the government would create a board of physicians, overseen by a French judge magistrate, to determine if individual cases were caused by French testing, and if individuals were suffering from illnesses on a United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation list of eighteen disorders linked to exposure to testing. Pressure groups, including the Veterans group &quot;Truth and Justice&quot; criticised the programme as too restrictive in illnesses covered and too bureaucratic. Polynesian groups said the bill would also unduly restrict applicants to those who had been in small areas near the test zones, not taking into account the pervasive pollution and radiation. Algerian groups had also complained that these restrictions would deny compensation to many victims. One Algerian group estimated there were 27,000 still living victims of ill effects from the 1960–66 testing there, while the French government had given an estimate of just 500.

==Non-nuclear WMD==
France states that it does not currently possess chemical weapons. The country ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in 1995, and acceded to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC) in 1984. France also ratified the Geneva Protocol in 1926.

During World War I, France, not Germany as commonly believed, was actually the first nation to use chemical weapons though this was notably a nonlethal tear gas attack (xylyl bromide) carried out in August 1914 against invading German troops. Once the war had degenerated into trench warfare and new methods to attain an advantage were sought, the German Army initiated a chlorine gas attack against the French Army at Ypres on 15 April 1915, initiating a new method of warfare but failed that day to exploit the resulting break in the French line. In time, the more potent phosgene replaced chlorine in use by armies on the Western Front, including France, leading to massive casualties on both sides of the conflict. As the war progressed, the effects were mitigated by development of protective clothing and masks.

At the outbreak of World War II, France maintained large stockpiles of mustard gas and phosgene but did not use them against the invading Axis troops, and no chemical weapons were used on the battlefield by the Axis invaders.

During the invasion of France, German forces captured a French biological research facility and purportedly found plans to use potato beetles against Germany.

Immediately after the end of the war, the French military began testing captured German chemical agent stores in Algeria, then a French department, notably the extremely toxic nerve agent Tabun. By the late 1940s, testing of Tabun-filled ordnance had become routine, often by using livestock to test effects. The testing of chemical weapons occurred at B2-Namous, Algeria, an uninhabited desert proving ground located 100 kilometers (62 mi) east of the Moroccan border, but other sites also existed. A manufacturing facility existed in Bouchet, near Paris, which was tasked with researching chemical weapons and maintaining a scientific and technological vigilance on the subject.

In 1985, France was estimated to have a chemical weapons stockpile of some 435 tonnes, the second largest in NATO following the United States. However, at a conference in Paris in 1989, France declared that it was no longer in possession of chemical weaponry but maintained the manufacturing capacity to readily produce such weapons if deemed necessary.

<doc id="589092" wikidata="Q1865511" url="?curid=589092" title="The Three Degrees">
<text>The Three Degrees is an American female vocal group formed circa 1963 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Although 16 women have been members over the years, the group has always been a trio. The current line-up consists of Helen Scott, Valerie Holiday, and Freddi Poole. The group were particularly successful in the UK, achieving 13 Top 50 hit singles between 1974 and 1985.

The original members were Fayette Pinkney, Shirley Porter and Linda Turner. Porter and Turner were eventually replaced by Janet Harmon and Helen Scott and then subsequently by Sheila Ferguson and Valerie Holiday. The line-up from 1967 to 1976 was Pinkney, Valerie Holiday and Sheila Ferguson, who would go on to sing lead on most of the group&#x27;s biggest hits. This line-up topped the US Hot 100 as featured vocalists on the MFSB single &quot;TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)&quot; in 1974, and had seven UK Top 40 hits, including the 1974 single &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot;, which was a huge international hit, reaching the Top 5 in seven countries, including number two in the US and topping the UK Singles Chart. When Pinkney left the group in 1976, she was replaced by a returning Helen Scott. This line-up had four UK Top 20 hits, including &quot;Woman in Love&quot;, which reached number three in 1979. Ferguson left for a solo career in 1986.

The group&#x27;s most stable line-up was from 1989 to 2010, with Cynthia Garrison joining Holiday and Scott. They achieved a final UK chart entry, reaching number 54 in 1998 with a dance cover of &quot;Last Christmas&quot;. Garrison left the band at the end of 2010 for health reasons, and was replaced by Freddi Poole in 2011. The group&#x27;s 2016 album, &quot;Strategy: Our Tribute to Philadelphia&quot;, was their first studio album release with Pool as a member. Valerie Holiday is the longest serving Degree with almost 56 years of continuous service to her name. Helen Scott is the only member who was active during the Swan Records era. 

==Career==
===1960s===
The Three Degrees were formed around 1963 in Philadelphia according to founder member, the late Fayette Pinkney: &quot;it&#x27;s about &#x27;63, last year in high school...and it was fun!&quot;. They were discovered by producer and songwriter Richard Barrett, who produced the original line-up on their first song, &quot;Gee Baby (I&#x27;m Sorry)&quot;, for Swan Records, in 1965. Turner and Porter both left the group, leaving Fayette Pinkney the only original member. They were eventually replaced by Helen Scott and Janet Harmon Barrett also became manager of Sheila Ferguson, who had been friends with Scott since high school. Barrett signed Ferguson to Swan Records in 1965. The Three Degrees released a number of singles, including &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Need You&quot; and a cover version of &quot;Maybe&quot; in 1966. Fayette, Janet and Helen were often joined by Sheila on their Swan recordings and the Group often backed Sheila on her solo records during that time.
When Scott left the group in 1966 to start a family, Ferguson filled in for her. She remained for 20 years and was lead singer on most of the group&#x27;s best-selling tracks. Harmon left by 1967 and, after brief stints by Sundray Tucker and Sonia Goring, she was replaced by Valerie Holiday that same year. Barrett signed the trio to recording contracts over the next three years with Warner Bros., Metromedia, and Neptune record labels, the latter owned by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, who would work with the group five years later. At this point, the group&#x27;s close harmony singing made them a popular nightclub act, but a hit record still eluded them.

===1970s===

By 1970, they were signed to Roulette Records and they released their first album, &quot;Maybe&quot;. The title song, this time with Valerie Holiday taking the lead, took them to No. 4 on the US R&amp;B chart. The singles, &quot;I Do Take You&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re the Fool&quot; followed, as did their second album, &quot;So Much Love&quot;. This success landed them a cameo appearance in the 1971 film, &quot;The French Connection&quot;, where they performed a cover of Jimmy Webb&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Gets to Go to the Moon&quot;, filmed during one of their appearances at the Copacabana nightclub in New York City.

In 1973, when their contract with Roulette ended, Barrett signed them to Philadelphia International Records under Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, where they had their greatest successes. The first song they recorded for the label was with the studio band MFSB, titled &quot;TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)&quot;, which was the theme song for &quot;Soul Train&quot;. In October 1973, the group also made an appearance on the American television sitcom &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; (season 3, episode 4), singing their song &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Know&quot;.

Their first album for the Philadelphia International label, &quot;The Three Degrees&quot;, spawned three hits: &quot;Dirty Ol&#x27; Man&quot; (which went gold in the Netherlands and Belgium), &quot;Year Of Decision&quot; (which made it to No. 13 in the UK Singles Chart), but it was the third single, &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot;, that propelled the trio into the mainstream. It topped the UK Chart for two weeks in August 1974 (the first time this had been achieved by an all-female group since The Supremes in 1964,) and became the fourth best-selling single of the year. It also reached No. 2 in the US, where it sold over two million copies and earned the trio a gold record in December 1974 (at that time, Platinum certifications had not been assigned to singles).

The Three Degrees also recorded two live albums: one in Leicester in the UK, and the other in Tokyo in Japan, and released both in 1975. The trio&#x27;s second studio album for the Philadelphia label, &quot;The Three Degrees International&quot;, was marketed internationally under different titles and in various languages. In Continental Europe, it was called &quot;With Love&quot;, and it spawned the hit single &quot;Take Good Care Of Yourself&quot;, which reached the UK Top 10. The UK release of the album was actually titled &quot;Take Good Care Of Yourself&quot; and peaked at No. 6 in the UK Albums Chart, their highest ever chart placing for an album there. Two other songs from the album were big successes in Japan: &quot;Midnight Train&quot; and &quot;&quot;, the latter having been recorded in Japanese.

In 1976, the Three Degrees parted company with Gamble and Huff and moved to CBS Sony/Epic Records where they released the concept album, &quot;A Toast Of Love&quot;, purely for the Far East market, although a single of the title track was released internationally. In 1976, Fayette Pinkney was replaced by former band member Helen Scott. The album, &quot;Standing Up For Love&quot;, released in 1977 was their last release for CBS/Epic.

In 1978, The Three Degrees signed to Ariola Records in Europe and the US and began working with Giorgio Moroder, who had become famous as a disco producer following his work with Donna Summer. Further success was to follow, and they released two disco-styled albums on Ariola (&quot;New Dimensions&quot; in 1978, and &quot;3D&quot; in 1979) which delivered four UK Top 20 hits between them: &quot;Givin&#x27; Up Givin&#x27; In&quot;, &quot;Woman in Love&quot;, &quot;The Runner&quot; and &quot;My Simple Heart&quot;. 

The group performed for future British monarch Charles III at his 30th birthday party in 1978, and were guests at the pre-wedding party for his marriage to Lady Diana Spencer in 1981; whilst he was the Prince of Wales. His Majesty is arguably the most famous fan of the band and their 1978 hit, &quot;Givin&#x27; Up, Givin&#x27; In&quot;, is said to be his favourite song. Their own television special, &quot;The Three Degrees at The Royal Albert Hall&quot; (aka &quot;An Evening with The Three Degrees&quot;), was recorded in October 1979 in which the trio were backed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

===1980s===
In 1980, the compilation album &quot;Gold&quot; was released and became a UK Top 10 hit. Featuring one side of their hits on the Ariola label between 1978 and 1979, and one side of live recordings from their 1979 Royal Albert Hall television special, this would be the trio&#x27;s second &quot;best of&quot; compilation to make the UK Top 10 in less than two years, after CBS released &quot;A Collection of their 20 Greatest Hits&quot; in early 1979 (which featured their pre-Ariola material, and peaked at number 8 in the UK Albums Chart).

Between 1982 and 1985, The Three Degrees released two albums on their own 3D label; &quot;Album of Love&quot; and &quot;Live in the UK&quot;. On that label they also released &quot;Liar&quot;, a single written by Sheila Ferguson. A third BBC Television show was also recorded in 1982, titled &quot;Take 3 Degrees&quot;, which included performances of their greatest hits, and also songs that the group were performing in their latest show, such as &quot;I Can&#x27;t Turn You Loose&quot; and &quot;Celebration&quot;. 

They returned to the UK charts in 1985 with &quot;The Heaven I Need&quot; which was produced by Stock/Aitken/Waterman on Supreme Records, though the single narrowly missed the UK Top 40. The band expressed surprise the song did not chart higher, and spoke of their regret that their working relationship with the production team did not continue.

In 1986, Miquel Brown filled in for Scott while the latter was pregnant. That same year Ferguson decided to leave the group to focus on her family life and raising her daughters. Scott and Holiday replaced Ferguson with Vera Brown of The Ritchie Family in 1986, and then Rhea Harris in 1987. In 1989, Scott and Holiday, along with new recruit Victoria Wallace, recorded the album &quot;Three Degrees ... And Holding&quot; on Ichiban Records. A single, &quot;A Tender Lie&quot; was also released. Following the album, the group recorded a live CD at London&#x27;s Dominion Theatre, with Billy Paul and Harold Melvin &amp; the Bluenotes in 1989. The group followed this with another tour of the UK and Japan at the end of the year. 

In a 2006 documentary interview, which featured Ferguson and Holiday speaking about their time together in the group, it was revealed that when Ferguson decided to leave the group, she spoke to the group members on a phone call about her decision instead of in person and both parties felt that the conversation ended abruptly. In addition, Holiday commented feeling upset that this specific conversation should have been in person and not on a phone call and said that it had been difficult to find a replacement for Ferguson. Since then, Ferguson has had limited contact with the members of the group and has never had any public appearances with The Three Degrees. In a 2011 interview on the British TV show, &quot;Lorraine&quot;, with The Three Degrees, they commented they may from time to time run into Ferguson in the United States. Often their encounters with Ferguson are only for brief moments; as Helen Scott had mentioned – it is like .

===1990s–present===
In December 1989, Cynthia Garrison replaced Wallace forming the longest running line-up of the group. In 1993, they were asked to record a new version of &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot; with Thomas Anders (of Modern Talking). He supplied three tracks for their album &quot;Out of the Past Into the Future&quot;, marking their return to Ariola Records and their most successful album for 15 years, Two further singles were released from the album, the re-recording of &quot;Dirty Ol&#x27; Man&quot; and new song &quot;Hurry Hurry&quot;. In 1993 they released a new best of album, &quot;Best &amp; New Hits: When Will I See You Again&quot;, which included 5 re-recorded hits and 5 cover songs. A seasonal album, &quot;Christmas With The Three Degrees&quot;, was also recorded in 1998. This album included a cover of Wham!&#x27;s &quot;Last Christmas&quot;, which was released as a remixed dance single which gave the group their 15th (and final) UK top 60 single, reaching number 54.

Scott, Holiday and Garrison continued to tour. They made their first US TV appearance in over 20 years in 2003 on the PBS show, &quot;Rhythm, Love, and Soul&quot; with Aretha Franklin, Lou Rawls and Mary Wilson. They were also part of the &#x27;Best Disco In Town 2004 Tour&#x27; with the Pointer Sisters, Chic, the Emotions, and Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King. They also took part in the 2007 &#x27;Best Disco In Town&#x27; tour of the United Kingdom in May 2007.

In 2008, the group released the album &quot;Helen, Valerie, Cynthia: The Greatest Hits&quot;, which included completely new recordings of the group&#x27;s biggest hits and some fan favourites.

The group, together with Pinkney, received various honours during 2007 and 2008, through BEMA (The Black Entertainment and Music Association) and the City of Philadelphia for their contribution to music over five decades, creating, for the first time, The Four Degrees.

Pinkney died on June 27, 2009, in a hospital in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, after a short illness at the age of 61. Her 1979 solo album, &quot;One Degree&quot;, was re-released on CD shortly after her death.

In 2009, the group released their first studio album in over ten years, &quot;Undercover 2009&quot;. It contained a selection of eight cover versions of classic songs by ABBA, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon and Bee Gees. The following year they released a new single &quot;Holding Back&quot;.

In January 2011, Freddi Poole replaced Cynthia Garrison who was suffering from Piriformis syndrome. 

In 2016, the Three Degrees released their first studio album with member Freddi Poole entitled &quot;Strategy: Our Tribute To Philadelphia&quot;, through Cherry Red Records.

Cynthia Garrison died on January 22, 2024.

<doc id="589105" wikidata="Q11036149" url="?curid=589105" title="David Agnew">
<text>&quot;David Agnew&quot; is a pen name that was employed on BBC television drama programmes of the 1970s as a scriptwriting credit.

==Conditions of use==
The pseudonym &quot;David Agnew&quot; was most often used when the original freelance scriptwriter was unable to accommodate fundamental changes requested by the production staff, who therefore had to perform a significant rewrite themselves. BBC rules prevented the production staff from taking screen credit without a time-consuming, bureaucratic appeals process, meaning that the quickest way for the project to continue under the BBC system was to use the name of a non-existent writer. Sometimes production staff were directly ordered by BBC management to use the credit.

==Examples==
The name was first used in 1971, when Anthony Read&#x27;s script for the &quot;Play for Today&quot; episode &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angel&quot; was broadcast under the pseudonym. Read&#x27;s work on the 1975 &quot;BBC2 Playhouse&quot; episode &quot;Diane&quot; was likewise credited to &quot;David Agnew&quot;.

The pseudonym entered into use on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; after Anthony Read became the show&#x27;s script editor. Read and producer Graham Williams used the pen name hurriedly to assemble &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot; in 1978. A year later, the name concealed the joint work of Douglas Adams, Williams and David Fisher on &quot;City of Death&quot;.

The name was also used for the episode &quot;Blow Out&quot; of &quot;Target&quot;. In this case, a two-hour script was pared down to one. Writer Roger Marshall quit at the pre-production stage, leaving director Douglas Camfield to revise the script.

==Use outside television==
In March 2000, &quot;David Agnew&quot; was used for a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; book, the short story anthology &quot;Short Trips and Sidesteps&quot;, in homage to the pseudonym&#x27;s use on the television series. Agnew was also the subject of &quot;The Elusive David Agnew&quot;, a mockumentary directed by &quot;Allen Smithee&quot; on the DVD release of &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;. A character in the 2013 Doctor Who short novel The Death Pit, by A. L. Kennedy, is named David Agnew.

<text>The People&#x27;s Republic of China has developed and possesses weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and nuclear weapons. The first of China&#x27;s nuclear weapons tests took place in 1964, and its first hydrogen bomb test occurred in 1966 at Lop Nur. Tests continued until 1996, when the country signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), but did not ratify it. China acceded to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) in 1984 and ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in 1997. Since 2020, China has been wielding a nuclear triad, alongside four other countries.

The number of nuclear warheads in China&#x27;s arsenal is a state secret. There are varying estimates of the size of China&#x27;s arsenal. The &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; and Federation of American Scientists estimated in 2024 that China has a stockpile of approximately 500 nuclear warheads, while the United States Department of Defense put the estimate at more than 600 operational nuclear warheads, making it the third-largest in the world.

In 1964, China adopted a policy of no-first-use (NFU), although some of its nuclear forces are reported to have moved toward a launch on warning (LOW) posture in the early 2020s.

==Nuclear weapons==

===History===


Mao Zedong referred to nuclear weapons as a paper tiger which, although they would not determine the outcome of a war, could still be used by great powers to scare and coerce. He favored China&#x27;s development of nuclear weapons because &quot;In today&#x27;s world, if we don&#x27;t want to be bullied by others, we should have atomic weapons by all means.&quot;

United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s threats during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis to use nuclear weapons against military targets in Fujian province prompted Mao to begin China&#x27;s nuclear program. While Mao did not expect to be able to match the large American nuclear arsenal, he believed that even a few bombs would increase China&#x27;s diplomatic credibility. As a result of the Anti-Party Group incident in the Soviet Union, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s position within the Eastern Bloc became insecure for a time, thus necessitating the support of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Mao. The CCP subsequently traded its support for Khrushchev for Soviet technology of nuclear weapons. The Agreement on New Technology for National Defence was later signed in October, which promised Soviet support for Chinese development of nuclear weapons.

Construction of uranium-enrichment plants in Baotou and Lanzhou began in 1958, and a plutonium facility in Jiuquan and the Lop Nur nuclear test site by 1960. The Soviet Union provided assistance in the early Chinese program by sending advisers to help in the facilities devoted to fissile material production and, in October 1957, agreed to provide a prototype boosted fission weapon, missiles, and related technology. The Chinese, who preferred to import technology and components to developing them within China, exported uranium to the Soviet Union, and the Soviets sent two R-2 missiles in 1958.

That year, however, Khrushchev told Mao that he planned to discuss arms control with the United States and Britain. China was already opposed to Khrushchev&#x27;s post-Stalin policy of peaceful coexistence. Although Soviet officials assured China that it was under the Soviet nuclear umbrella, the disagreements widened the emerging Sino-Soviet split. In June 1959, the two nations formally ended their agreement on military and technology cooperation, and in July 1960, all Soviet assistance with the Chinese nuclear program was abruptly terminated and all Soviet technicians were withdrawn from the program. As the Soviets backed out, Chinese officials realized that they had to develop hydrogen bomb technology without any Soviet assistance and would need to begin the work immediately, without waiting for successful results from a fission bomb.

According to Arms Control and Disarmament Agency director William Foster, the American government, under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, was concerned about the program and studied ways to sabotage or attack it, perhaps with the aid of Taiwan or the Soviet Union, but Khrushchev was not interested. China conducted its first nuclear test, code-named 596, on 16 October 1964. Its first thermonuclear weapon test occurred on December 28, 1966. Its last nuclear test was on July 29, 1996.

In 2023, satellite open-source intelligence showed evidence of drilling shafts in Lop Nur where nuclear weapons testing could resume.
===Size===
, several non-official sources estimate that China has over 500 nuclear warheads. In 2024, the United States Department of Defense estimated China possesses more than 600 operational nuclear warheads.

The same year, United States Strategic Command indicated that China has equipped more nuclear warheads on its ICBMs than the United States (550 according to the New START treaty).

In 2024, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that China has approximately 300 missile silos and is estimated to reach at least 1000 operational warheads by 2030.

===Nuclear use policy===
China&#x27;s policy has traditionally been one of no first use while maintaining a secure second-strike capability. Following its first test in 1964, China stated that it would &quot;never at any time or under any circumstances be the first to use nuclear weapons.&quot; In peacetime, it has traditionally stored nuclear warheads separately from their launching systems. In the early 2020s, some of its nuclear forces are reported to have moved toward a launch on warning (LOW) posture.

In 2024, the United States Department of State described China&#x27;s no-first-use policy as &quot;ambiguous&quot;. American defense analysts have contended that China is shifting away from a strict no-first-use strategy and toward a launch on warning (LOW) posture, which would allow it to retaliate upon the detection of incoming warheads without waiting for them to strike Chinese targets first. These concerns increased after China began to modernize and expand its nuclear arsenal in the early 2020s. The move was seen as a response to progress made in U.S. missile defense systems (such as the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) and long-range precision strike abilities (such as Conventional Prompt Strike), which decreases the survivability of a Chinese second strike, as well as the possibility that American strategy may require nukes to compensate for the numerical disadvantage of its conventional forces overseas. There is debate among Chinese strategists regarding the merits and drawbacks of a LOW posture similar to that of Russia and the United States, and as of 2023 the bulk of China&#x27;s strategic forces had not moved to a LOW posture.

===Nuclear proliferation===

Historically, China has been implicated in the development of the Pakistani nuclear program before China ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1992. In the early 1980s, China is believed to have given Pakistan a &quot;package&quot; including uranium enrichment technology, high-enriched uranium, and the design for a compact nuclear weapon. China also received stolen technology that Abdul Qadeer Khan brought back to Pakistan and Pakistan set up a centrifuge plant in China as revealed in his letters which state &quot;(1)You know we had cooperation with China for 15 years. We put up a centrifuge plant at Hanzhong (250km south-west of Xi&#x27;an). We sent 135 C-130 plane loads of machines, inverters, valves, flow meters, pressure gauges. Our teams stayed there for weeks to help and their teams stayed here for weeks at a time. Late minister Liu We, V. M. [vice minister] Li Chew, Vice Minister Jiang Shengjie used to visit us. (2)The Chinese gave us drawings of the nuclear weapon, gave us 50 kg enriched uranium, gave us 10 tons of UF6 (natural) and 5 tons of UF6 (3%). Chinese helped PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, the rival organization to the Khan Research Laboratories] in setting up UF6 plant, production reactor for plutonium and reprocessing plant.&quot;

===Nuclear non-proliferation===
Before the 1980s, China viewed arms control and nuclear non-proliferation regimes as mechanisms through which Western powers (particularly the U.S.) sought to restrain China. The Chinese government believed that the Treaty “[served] the interests of some States” and only favored the countries that already had nuclear weapons. Additionally, the Chinese government thought this Treaty was discriminatory since many countries were attempting to restrict and deprive nuclear weapons of a country that had only just tested them successfully, rather than countries like the U.S. or U.S.S.R., which have at least 100 times more nuclear weapons. Therefore, China chose not to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) at that time. 
Beginning in the 1980s, China&#x27;s policy and attitude toward nuclear weapons and the NPT had changed under the administration of Deng Xiaoping. Though China continued developing more advanced nuclear technology and weapons, by the 1980s, the country had indicated that it intended on accepting the terms of the NPT. China acceded to the treaty in 1992.

China was active in the six-party talks in an effort to end North Korea&#x27;s nuclear program in the early 2000s. The six-party talks ultimately failed, and in 2006, China voted in favor of sanctioning North Korea for its nuclear program.

The field of nuclear security has become a well-established area of successful U.S.-China cooperation. In 2009, CCP general secretary Hu Jintao called for a bolstered arms control agenda at the United Nations General Assembly, joining United States President Barack Obama&#x27;s earlier calls for a nuclear-free world. Precipitated by a 2010 Nuclear Security Summit convened by the Obama administration, China and the U.S. launched a number of initiatives to secure potentially dangerous, Chinese-supplied, nuclear material in countries such as Ghana or Nigeria. Through these initiatives, China and the U.S. have converted Chinese-origin Miniature Neutron Source Reactors (MNSRs) from using highly enriched uranium to using low-enriched uranium fuel (which is not directly usable in weapons, thereby making reactors more proliferation resistant).

China, along with all other nuclear weapon states and all members of NATO with the exception of the Netherlands, decided not to sign the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a binding agreement for negotiations for the total elimination of nuclear weapons.

China refused to join talks in 2020 between the U.S. and Russia on extending their bilateral New START nuclear arms reduction treaty, as the Trump administration requested. China&#x27;s position is that as its nuclear warhead arsenal is a small fraction of the U.S. and Russia arsenals, their inclusion in an arms reduction treaty is unnecessary, and that it will join such talks when both U.S. and Russia has reduced their arsenal to near China&#x27;s level.

The United States has a classified strategy called Nuclear Employment Guidance, updated by president Joe Biden in March 2024, reported to refocus U.S. nuclear deterrence strategy more toward China.

===Delivery systems estimates===

==== Miniaturization ====
China has made significant improvements in its miniaturization techniques since the 1980s. There have been accusations, notably by the Cox Commission, that this was done primarily by covertly acquiring the U.S.&#x27;s W88 nuclear warhead design as well as guided ballistic missile technology.

===Land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles===

The Dongfeng 5A is a single-warhead, three-stage, liquid-fueled missile with a range of 13,000+ km. In 2000, General Eugene Habiger of the U.S. Air Force, then-commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, testified before Congress that China has 18 silo-based DF-5s. Since the early 21st century, the Second Artillery Corps have also deployed up to 10 Solid-fueled mobile DF-31 ICBMs, with a range of 7,200+ km and possibly up to 3 MIRVs. China has also developed the DF-31A, an intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of 11,200+ km with possibly 3–6 multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) capability.

China stores many of its missiles in huge tunnel complexes; US Representative Michael Turner referring to 2009 Chinese media reports said &quot;This network of tunnels could be in excess of 5,000 kilometers (3,110 miles), and is used to transport nuclear weapons and forces.&quot; A People&#x27;s Liberation Army newspaper calls this tunnel system an underground Great Wall of China.

===Medium-range ballistic missiles===
Approximately 55% of China&#x27;s missiles are in the medium-range category, targeted at regional theater targets.

====DF-3A/CSS-2====
====DF-21/CSS-5====
===Tactical cruise missiles===
The CJ-10 long-range cruise missile made its first public appearance in 2009 during a military parade on the 60th Anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China as a part of the Second Artillery Corps&#x27; long-range conventional missile forces; the CJ-10 represents the next generation in rocket weapons technology in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA). A similar naval cruise missile, the YJ-62, was also revealed during the parade; the YJ-62 serves as the PLA Navy&#x27;s latest development into naval rocketry.

===Long-range ballistic missiles===
The Chinese categorize long-range ballistic missiles as ones with a range between 3000 and 8000 km.

China &quot;keeps most of its warheads at a central storage facility in the Qinling mountain range, though some are kept at smaller regional storage facilities.&quot;

====DF-4/CSS-3====
The Dong Feng 4 or DF-4 (also known as the CSS-3) is a long-range two-stage Chinese intermediate-range ballistic missile with liquid fuel (nitric acid/UDMH). It was thought to be deployed in limited numbers in underground silos beginning in 1980. The DF-4 has a takeoff thrust of 1,224.00 kN, a takeoff weight of 82,000 kg, a diameter of 2.25 m, a length of 28.05 m, and a fin span of 2.74 m. It is equipped with a 2,190 kg nuclear warhead with 3,300 kt explosive yield, and its range is 5,500 km. The missile uses inertial guidance, resulting in a relatively poor CEP of 1,500 meters.

===Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)===

====DF-5A/CSS-4 Mod 2====
The Dongfeng 5 or DF-5 is a 3-stage Chinese ICBM. It has a length 32.6 m and a diameter of 3.35 m. It weighs 183 tonnes and has an estimated range of 12,000–15,000 kilometers. The DF-5 had its first flight in 1971 and was in operational service 10 years later. One of the downsides of the missile was that it took between 30 and 60 minutes to fuel.

====DF-31/CSS-10====
The Dong Feng 31 (or CSS-10) is a medium-range, three stage, solid propellant intercontinental ballistic missile developed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is a land-based variant of the submarine-launched JL-2.

====DF-41/CSS-X-10====
The DF-41 (or CSS-X-10) is an intercontinental ballistic missile believed to be operational. It is designed to carry multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV), delivering multiple nuclear warheads.

===Nuclear cruise missiles===
The US DoD estimated in 2006 that the PRC was developing ground- and air-launched cruise missiles that could easily be converted to carry nuclear warheads once developed.

====DH-10====
The DongHai 10 (DH-10) is a cruise missile developed in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. According to &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot;, the DH-10 is a second-generation land-attack cruise missile (LACM), with over 4,000 km range, integrated inertial navigation system, GPS, terrain contour mapping system, and digital scene-matching terminal-homing system. The missile is estimated to have a circular error probable (CEP) of 10 meters.

====CJ-10====
The ChangJian-10 (Long Sword 10) is a cruise missile developed by China, based on the Hongniao missile family. It has a range of 2,200 km. Although not confirmed, it is suspected that the CJ-10 could carry nuclear warheads. An air-launched variant (named CJ-20) has also been developed.

====HongNiao missile family====
There are three missiles in this family: the HN-1, HN-2, and HN-3. Reportedly based on the Kh-SD/65 missiles, the Hongniao (or Red Bird) missiles are some of the first nuclear-capable cruise missiles in China. The HN-1 has a range of 600 km, the HN-2 has a range of 1,800 km, and the HN-3 has a range of 3,000 km.

====ChangFeng missile family====
There are two missiles in the Chang Feng (or Long Wind) family: CF-1 and CF-2. These are the first domestically developed long-range cruise missiles for China. The CF-1 has a range of 400 km while the CF-2 has a range of 800 km. Both variants can carry a 10 kt nuclear warhead.

===Sea-based weapons===
The submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) stockpile of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is thought to be relatively new. China launched its first second-generation nuclear submarine in April 1981. The navy currently has a one Type 092 &quot;Xia&quot; class SSBN at roughly 8000 tons displacement. A second Type 092 was reportedly lost in an accident in 1985. The Type 092 is equipped with 12 JL-1 SLBMs with a range of 2150–2500 km. The JL-1 is a modified DF-21 missile. It is suspected that the Type 092 is being converted into a cruise missile submarine.

The Chinese navy has developed Type 094 ballistic missile submarine; open source satellite imagery has shown that at least two of these have been completed. This submarine will be capable of carrying 12 of the longer ranged, more modern JL-2s with a range of approximately 14,000 km.

China is also developing the Type 096 submarine, claimed to be able to carry up to 24 JL-3 ballistic missiles each. Some Chinese sources state that the submarine is already undergoing trials.

===Nuclear bomber force===
China&#x27;s bomber force consists mostly of Chinese-made versions of Soviet aircraft. The People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force has 120 H-6s (a variant of the Tupolev Tu-16). These bombers are outfitted to carry nuclear as well as conventional weapons. While the H-6 fleet is aging, it is not as old as the American B-52 Stratofortress. The Chinese have also produced the Xian JH-7 &quot;Flying Leopard&quot; fighter-bomber with a range and payload exceeding the F-111 (currently about 80 are in service) capable of delivering a nuclear strike. China has also bought the advanced Sukhoi Su-30 from Russia; currently, about 100 Su-30s (MKK and MK2 variants) have been purchased by China. The Su-30 is capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons.

China is alleged to be testing new H-8 and Xian H-20 strategic bombers which are either described as an upgraded H-6 or an aircraft in the same class as the US B-2, able to carry nuclear weapons.

=== Fractional orbital bombardment system ===
In 2021, following tests by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, United States Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall III stated that China was developing and testing a fractional orbital bombardment system.

==Biological weapons==

China is currently a signatory of the Biological Weapons Convention and Chinese officials have stated that China has never engaged in biological activities with offensive military applications. However, China was reported to have had an active biological weapons program in the 1980s.

Kanatjan Alibekov, former director of one of the Soviet germ-warfare programs, said that China suffered a serious accident at one of its biological weapons plants in the late 1980s. Alibekov asserted that Soviet reconnaissance satellites identified a biological weapons laboratory and plant near a site for testing nuclear warheads. The Soviets suspected that two separate epidemics of hemorrhagic fever that swept the region in the late 1980s were caused by an accident in a lab where Chinese scientists were weaponizing viral diseases.

US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressed her concerns over possible Chinese biological weapon transfers to Iran and other nations in a letter to Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah) in January 1997. Albright stated that she had received reports regarding transfers of dual-use items from Chinese entities to the Iranian government which concerned her and that the United States had to encourage China to adopt comprehensive export controls to prevent assistance to Iran&#x27;s alleged biological weapons program. The United States acted upon the allegations on January 16, 2002, when it imposed sanctions on three Chinese firms accused of supplying Iran with materials used in the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons. In response to this, China issued export control protocols on dual use biological technology in late 2002.

A biological program in China was described in a 2015 detailed study by the Indian Ministry of Defence funded Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses. It pointed to 42 facilities, some in the same compound, that had the capacity, possibly latently, of research, development, production or testing of biological weapons.

According to Nuclear Threat Initiative, no evidence of the program&#x27;s existence has been officially released.

==Chemical weapons==
The People&#x27;s Republic of China signed the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) on January 13, 1993, and ratified it on April 25, 1997.

China was found to have supplied Albania with a stockpile of chemical weapons in the 1970s during the Cold War.

<doc id="589121" wikidata="Q4057200" url="?curid=589121" title="Cyclopteridae">
<text>The Cyclopteridae are a family of marine fishes, commonly known as lumpsuckers or lumpfish, in the order Scorpaeniformes. They are found in the cold waters of the Arctic, North Atlantic, and North Pacific oceans. The greatest number of species are found in the North Pacific. The family name &quot;Cyclopteridae&quot; derives from the Greek words &quot;κύκλος&quot; (kyklos), meaning &quot;circle&quot;, and &quot;πτέρυξ&quot; (pteryx), meaning &quot;wing&quot; or &quot;fin&quot;, in reference to the circle-shaped pectoral fins of most of the fish in this family.

==Genera==
Cyclopteridae includes the following valid genera:
== Description ==

Lumpsuckers are named appropriately enough; their portly bodies are nearly spherical with generally drab coloration and lithic patterns. The &quot;sucker&quot; part refers to the fish&#x27;s modified pelvic fins, which have evolved into adhesive discs (located ventrally, behind the pectoral fins); the fish use these discs to adhere to the substrate. Many species have bony, wart-like &quot;tubercles&quot; adorning the head and body; these are important taxonomic features of the family.

The simple, rounded fins are small with the exception of the broad, fan-like pectorals, which actually extend ventrally. The first of the two dorsal fins is spinous, with 4–8 spines; in some species, this fin is completely overgrown with skin and therefore not visible. While the lateral line in lumpsuckers is otherwise reduced or absent, it is well developed in the head; some species even have tubular, whisker-like external projections of the opercular canal, which is a part of the cranial lateral line system.

The relatively small mouths of lumpsuckers are lined with narrow rows of small conical teeth. The gas bladder is absent. In terms of length, lumpsuckers range in size from in the case of &quot;Eumicrotremus awae&quot; up to more than in the case of the common lumpsucker &quot;Cyclopterus lumpus&quot;.

== Habitat and diet ==
As their appearance might suggest, lumpsuckers are poor swimmers. Most species are &quot;benthic&quot;; that is, they spend most of their time on or near the bottom. The fish are found on rocky or muddy substrates, where their colouration allows for effective camouflage. Members of the family are found primarily on the continental shelf or slope, at depths down to . Some of the deeper-living species are however pelagic, remaining some distance above the ocean floor.

Benthic species feed on sessile invertebrates such as polychaete worms, crustaceans and mollusks. Pelagic species target prey they are capable of overtaking, namely slow-moving jellyfish and ctenophores.

Before their yolk is completely absorbed, juvenile lumpsuckers consume the larvae of crustaceans, which grow on seaweed near the surface, and smaller halacarid mites. Juveniles consume larger harpacticoids and isopods after they have absorbed their yolk.

== Behaviour and reproduction ==
Lumpsuckers are a poorly studied group, with little known of their behaviour and biology. At least some species are known to travel great distances in order to spawn in shallow, intertidal waters (from December to June in the smooth lumpsucker); this may well be true of all species. Males are also known to guard the brood of spherical eggs.

One of the peculiarities of lumpsuckers&#x27; neural systems is that they lack Mauthner cell neurons in their hindbrain, while these cells are present in virtually all other teleost fish. Nevertheless, lumpsuckers do have a C-startle response, which is apparently mediated by other hindbrain cells.

Hatchlings have well-developed pectoral fins and adhesive pelvic discs, which the fish use to cling to rocks in shallow water. Young fish remain in shallow, warmer water until fully developed. Pacific cod and sablefish are known predators of lumpsuckers.

==Fishers and the lumpsucker industry==
The only species that is targeted commercially is &quot;Cyclopterus lumpus&quot;, which is targeted primarily for its roe in Canada, Greenland, Iceland, and Norway, and to a lesser extent in Denmark and Sweden. &quot;Cyclopterus lumpus&quot; are also caught from the wild to provide broodstock for the aquaculture industry, where the fish is used as a cleaner fish to remove sea lice in salmon aquaculture.

<text>Kick the can (also known as kick the block, guard the block, can can, 40 40, pom pom, tip the can, tin can copper, and can up can down), is an outdoor children&#x27;s game related to tag, hide and seek, and capture the flag, played with as few as three to as many as several dozen players. The game is one of skill, strategy, stealth, and stamina.

The game is played with a kickable object, usually a discarded empty can, sometimes with rocks inserted for noise. The game was a popular pick-up game during difficult economic times. The origin is unknown, but during the Great Depression in the 1930s the game was a popular pastime because it did not require a playing field, nor any designated equipment other than a discarded can or other kickable object.

==Basic play==
One person or a team of people is designated as “it” and a can or similar object—paint can or metal pail or bucket—is placed in an open space: the middle of a backyard, a green, a cove or &quot;cul-de-sac&quot;, parking lot or street. The other players run off and hide while “it” covers their eyes and counts to a previously decided number. Alternatively, the start of the game begins when a designated kicker literally “kicks the can” as far as possible. The person who is “it” must return the can to its starting place before “it” can continue play, thus giving the other players time to escape. “It” then tries to find and tag each of the players. Any player who is tagged (caught and touched) is sent to the holding pen (jail) which is simply a designated area for all the captured players to congregate, generally in plain sight of the can. Any player who has not been caught can “kick the can” or “tip the can.” If they can do this without being caught, then all the captured players are set free. Alternatively, one of the captured players is set free each time the can is tipped—the first person caught is the first to be set free, the second person caught is the second to be set free, etc. until the person tipping the can is tagged or all the captured players are freed. If “it” catches all the players, they win that round, and generally a new “it” is designated for the next round. The new “it” is usually the person who has been held the longest by the time round ends.

==Variations==

In some variations &quot;it&quot; also means the tagger in the game of Tag merely has to call out a player&#x27;s name and hiding place rather than tagging them by touch. In some variations, &quot;it&quot; must jump over the can after calling the player&#x27;s name and location.

In another variation, when &quot;it&quot; sees or finds a person hiding, &quot;it&quot; must run back to the can and place one foot on it while saying the found person is in the can (e.g. &quot;Tim is in the can&quot;) before the found person is able to reach the can and tip it. Thus, once a person is found or seen by &quot;it&quot;, the game becomes a race to the can between the found person and &quot;it&quot;. In order for someone to be caught and put in &quot;jail&quot;, &quot;it&quot; must have beat the found person to the can and pronounced that person &quot;in the can&quot;. &quot;It&quot; also could say &quot;1–2–3 on..&quot; whoever they found, while touching the can. [This variant is also called &quot;Pan Hoop&quot; in Trinidad &amp; Tobago]

As another variation, more than one can is used. The cans or cartons are scattered at the beginning of the game when everyone runs to hide. &quot;It&quot; must gather them and stack them so they don&#x27;t fall over. Then, when &quot;it&quot; spots someone hiding, &quot;it&quot; must run back and touch the tower of cartons without knocking them down. If they fall, the &quot;caught&quot; hider can run away and hide again. If they remain standing, the hider goes to jail. While &quot;it&quot; is searching for others, someone not yet caught can sneak in and tip over the cartons, freeing those in jail.

In some cases, if the can is being tipped by one of the players that was hiding, instead of tagging the tipper to prevent the tipper from freeing any more captured players, the &quot;it&quot; must get in a tip at the can to prevent the other tipper from freeing any more captured players.

Another variation was to have two teams at either end of the road with an upright can in a chalk circle in the middle. In turn each team would roll a soft rubber or tennis ball and attempt to knock over the can. If your team (Team A) managed to knock over the can they would then run off and to win the game they had to return to the can and stand it up using only their feet. The opposing team (Team B) would try to stop them from standing the can up by throwing the ball at the Team A members. The ball holder from Team B had to stand in the same position and either pass to another team member or throw at an opponent . If they managed to hit a person from Team A they had to freeze. They could only be released if one of their own team went under their legs or when the can was eventually stood up. During the active game Team A could not touch the ball.

Another variation (called kick the tin) or (can can) played in Northern Ireland &amp; England, esp. Birmingham Shard End area. The aim was to start the game by one of the hiders being selected to kick the tin, the further the tin was kicked gave more time for players to hide. A favoured strategy was to kick it over a garden hedge making it harder to retrieve. The seeker had to retrieve the tin and count loudly so that the hiders knew they were ready to start searching. When the seeker saw a hider they would race each other back to the tin and the seeker had to knock the tin three times before the hider could kick it away and releasing themselves and others. Hiders would try to sneak closer to the tin so that when the seeker was far from it they would try to kick the tin to release hiders previously caught. If a seeker was unlucky they could be seeking all afternoon. This game was very popular in the 1970s and was played by kids from 5–18 years olds.

==Cultural significance==
Kick the can was very popular among kids during the Great Depression. The game is mentioned in Francisco Jiménez&#x27;s book &quot;The Circuit: Stories from the Life of a Migrant Child&quot;. Play scholar Rodney Carlisle notes that: &quot;As outdoor and unstructured play of children continues to dwindle, the game of Kick the Can is becoming less and less known to each generation... At one point in time, teenagers played Kick the Can with younger children, and the game and its variations were passed on from child to child. Past generations remember this game fondly, and it was enough of a cultural phenomenon that it was a central player in a 1962 episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and was incorporated later in the 1983 film of the same name.&quot; It is included in the 2010 PBS documentary &quot;New York Street Games&quot;. It is also depicted in the 1997 indie film Nowhere.

<text>Kurt August Hirsch (12 January 1906 – 4 November 1986) was a German mathematician who moved to England to escape the Nazi persecution of Jews. His research was in group theory. He also worked to reform mathematics education and became a county chess champion. The Hirsch length and Hirsch–Plotkin radical are named after him.

Hirsch trained initially at the University of Berlin. In 1934 he fled Nazi Germany and arrived in Cambridge, where with the encouragement of Philip Hall he enrolled as a doctoral student at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, receiving his PhD on Infinite Soluble Groups in 1937. He then taught at the University of Leicester from 1938 (except for a brief internment on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien in 1940), moved to King&#x27;s College, Newcastle in 1948, and then moved again to Queen Mary College in London in 1951, where he stayed for the remainder of his career and worked with K. W. Gruenberg.

Hirsch&#x27;s doctoral students include Ismail Mohamed and Ascher Wagner.

==Publications==
He translated several books from Russian, including:
* The Theory of Groups (by Aleksandr Kurosh). His first translation
* Algebraic Geometry (by Shafarevich). This was later retranslated by Miles Reid

<text>3908 Nyx is an Amor and Mars-crosser asteroid. It was discovered by Hans-Emil Schuster on August 6, 1980, and is named after Nyx, the Greek goddess of the night, after which Pluto&#x27;s moon Nix is also named. It is 1–2 km in diameter and is a V-type asteroid, meaning that it may be a fragment of the asteroid 4 Vesta.

==Observations==
In 2000, radar observations conducted at the Arecibo and Goldstone observatories produced a model of Nyx&#x27;s shape; the asteroid can best be described as spherical but with many protruding lumps.

==Name==
To avoid confusion with 3908 Nyx, Pluto&#x27;s moon Nix was changed from the initial proposal of the classical spelling Nyx, to Nix.

<doc id="589132" wikidata="Q655079" url="?curid=589132" title="Special number field sieve">
<text>In number theory, a branch of mathematics, the special number field sieve (SNFS) is a special-purpose integer factorization algorithm. The general number field sieve (GNFS) was derived from it.

The special number field sieve is efficient for integers of the form &quot;r&quot;&quot;e&quot; ± &quot;s&quot;, where &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot; are small (for instance Mersenne numbers).

Heuristically, its complexity for factoring an integer formula_1 is of the form:

:formula_2

in O and L-notations.

The SNFS has been used extensively by NFSNet (a volunteer distributed computing effort), NFS@Home and others to factorise numbers of the Cunningham project; for some time the records for integer factorization have been numbers factored by SNFS.

==Overview of method==

The SNFS is based on an idea similar to the much simpler rational sieve; in particular, readers may find it helpful to read about the rational sieve first, before tackling the SNFS.

The SNFS works as follows. Let &quot;n&quot; be the integer we want to factor. As in the rational sieve, the SNFS can be broken into two steps:
*First, find a large number of multiplicative relations among a &quot;factor base&quot; of elements of Z/&quot;n&quot;Z, such that the number of multiplicative relations is larger than the number of elements in the factor base.
*Second, multiply together subsets of these relations in such a way that all the exponents are even, resulting in congruences of the form &quot;a&quot;2≡&quot;b&quot;2 (mod &quot;n&quot;). These in turn immediately lead to factorizations of &quot;n&quot;: &quot;n&quot;=gcd(&quot;a&quot;+&quot;b&quot;,&quot;n&quot;)×gcd(&quot;a&quot;-&quot;b&quot;,&quot;n&quot;). If done right, it is almost certain that at least one such factorization will be nontrivial.

The second step is identical to the case of the rational sieve, and is a straightforward linear algebra problem. The first step, however, is done in a different, more efficient way than the rational sieve, by utilizing number fields.

==Details of method==

Let &quot;n&quot; be the integer we want to factor. We pick an irreducible polynomial &quot;f&quot; with integer coefficients, and an integer &quot;m&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)≡0 (mod &quot;n&quot;) (we will explain how they are chosen in the next section). Let &quot;α&quot; be a root of &quot;f&quot;; we can then form the ring Z[α]. There is a unique ring homomorphism φ from Z[&quot;α&quot;] to Z/nZ that maps &quot;α&quot; to &quot;m&quot;. For simplicity, we&#x27;ll assume that Z[&quot;α&quot;] is a unique factorization domain; the algorithm can be modified to work when it isn&#x27;t, but then there are some additional complications.

Next, we set up two parallel &quot;factor bases&quot;, one in Z[&quot;α&quot;] and one in Z. The one in Z[&quot;α&quot;] consists of all the prime ideals in Z[&quot;α&quot;] whose norm is bounded by a chosen value formula_3. The factor base in Z, as in the rational sieve case, consists of all prime integers up to some other bound.

We then search for relatively prime pairs of integers (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) such that:
*&quot;a&quot;+&quot;bm&quot; is smooth with respect to the factor base in Z (i.e., it is a product of elements in the factor base).
*&quot;a&quot;+&quot;bα&quot; is smooth with respect to the factor base in Z[&quot;α&quot;]; given how we chose the factor base, this is equivalent to the norm of &quot;a&quot;+&quot;bα&quot; being divisible only by primes less than formula_3.

These pairs are found through a sieving process, analogous to the Sieve of Eratosthenes; this motivates the name &quot;Number Field Sieve&quot;.

For each such pair, we can apply the ring homomorphism φ to the factorization of &quot;a&quot;+&quot;bα&quot;, and we can apply the canonical ring homomorphism from Z to Z/nZ to the factorization of &quot;a&quot;+&quot;bm&quot;. Setting these equal gives a multiplicative relation among elements of a bigger factor base in Z/nZ, and if we find enough pairs we can proceed to combine the relations and factor &quot;n&quot;, as described above.

==Choice of parameters==

Not every number is an appropriate choice for the SNFS: one needs to know in advance a polynomial &quot;f&quot; of appropriate degree (the optimal degree is conjectured to be formula_5, which is 4, 5, or 6 for the sizes of N currently feasible to factorise) with small coefficients, and a value &quot;x&quot; such that formula_6 where N is the number to factorise. There is an extra condition: &quot;x&quot; must satisfy formula_7 for a and b no bigger than formula_8.

One set of numbers for which such polynomials exist are the formula_9 numbers from the Cunningham tables; for example, when NFSNET factored , they used the polynomial with , since , and formula_10.

Numbers defined by linear recurrences, such as the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, also have SNFS polynomials, but these are a little more difficult to construct. For example, formula_11 has polynomial formula_12, and the value of &quot;x&quot; satisfies formula_13.

If one already knows some factors of a large number compatible with SNFS, then one could do the SNFS calculation modulo the remaining part; for the NFSNET example above, times a 197-digit composite number (the small factors were found by ECM), and the SNFS was performed modulo the 197-digit number. The number of relations required by SNFS still depends on the size of the large number, but the individual calculations are quicker modulo the smaller number.

==Limitations of algorithm==

This algorithm, as mentioned above, is very efficient for numbers of the form &quot;r&quot;&quot;e&quot;±&quot;s&quot;, for &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot; relatively small. It is also efficient for any integers which can be represented as a polynomial with small coefficients. This includes integers of the more general form &quot;ar&quot;&quot;e&quot;±&quot;bs&quot;&quot;f&quot;, and also for many integers whose binary representation has low Hamming weight. The reason for this is as follows: The Number Field Sieve performs sieving in two different fields.
The first field is usually the rationals. The second is a higher degree field. The efficiency of the algorithm strongly depends on the norms of certain elements in these fields. When an integer can be represented as a polynomial with small coefficients, the norms that arise are much smaller than those that arise when an integer is represented by a general polynomial. The reason is that a general polynomial will have much larger coefficients, and the norms will be correspondingly larger. The algorithm attempts to factor these norms over a fixed set of prime numbers. When the
norms are smaller, these numbers are more likely to factor.

<text>Sir Maurice George Kendall, FBA (6 September 1907 – 29 March 1983) was a prominent British statistician. The Kendall tau rank correlation is named after him.

==Education and early life==
Maurice Kendall was born in Kettering, Northamptonshire as the only child of engineering worker John Roughton Kendall and Georgina, née Brewer. His paternal grandfather was a publican, running The Woolpack at Kettering. 

As a child, he survived cerebral meningitis, which was frequently fatal at that time. After growing up in Derby, England, he studied mathematics at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he played cricket and chess (with future champions Conel Hugh O&#x27;Donel Alexander and Jacob Bronowski). After graduation as a Mathematics Wrangler in 1929, he joined the British Civil Service in the Ministry of Agriculture. In this position he became increasingly interested in using statistics towards agricultural questions, and one of his first published papers to the Royal Statistical Society involved studying crop productivity using factor analysis. He was elected a Fellow of the Society in 1934.

==Work in statistics==
In 1938 and 1939 he began work, along with Bernard Babington-Smith known as BBS, on the question of random number generation, developing both one of the first early mechanical devices to produce random digits, and formulated a series of tests for statistical randomness in a given set of digits which, with some small modifications, became fairly widely used. He produced one of the second large collections of random digits (100,000 in total, over twice as many as those published by L. H. C. Tippett in 1927), which was a commonly used tract until the publication of RAND Corporation&#x27;s &quot;A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates&quot; in 1955 (which was developed with a roulette wheel-like machine very similar to Kendall&#x27;s and verified as &quot;random&quot; using his statistical tests).

In 1937, he aided the ageing statistician G. Udny Yule in the revision of his standard statistical textbook, &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Statistics&quot;, commonly known for many years as &quot;Yule and Kendall&quot;. The two had met by chance in 1935, and were on close terms until Yule&#x27;s death in 1951 (Yule was godfather to Kendall&#x27;s second son).

During this period he also began work on the rank correlation coefficient which currently bears his name (Kendall&#x27;s tau), which eventually led to a monograph on &quot;Rank Correlation&quot; in 1948.

In the late 1930s, he was additionally part of a group of five other statisticians who endeavoured to produce a reference work summarising recent developments in statistical theory, but it was cancelled on account of onset of World War II.

==War-time efforts==
Kendall became Assistant general manager to the British Chamber of Shipping by day and had air-raid warden duties by night. Despite these constraints on his time, he managed to produce volume one of &quot;The Advanced Theory of Statistics&quot; in 1943 and a second volume in 1946.

During the war he also produced a series of papers extending to work of R.A. Fisher on the theory of k-statistics, and developed a number of extensions to this work through the 1950s. After the war, he worked on the theory and practice of time series analysis, and conclusively demonstrated (with the meager computing resources available at the time) that unsmoothed sample periodograms were unreliable estimators for the population spectrum.

==London School of Economics==
In 1949 he accepted the second chair of statistics at the London School of Economics, University of London. Here he worked part-time as the director of the new Research Techniques Division. From 1952 to 1957 he edited a two-volume work on &quot;Statistical Sources in the United Kingdom&quot;, which was a standard reference until the mid-1970s. In the 1950s he also worked on multivariate analysis, and developed the text &quot;Multivariate Analysis&quot; in 1957. In 1957, he also developed, with W. R. Buckland, a &quot;Dictionary of Statistical Terms&quot;, aimed at helping making the tools of statistics more available to potential users in industry and government.

In 1953, he published &quot;The Analytics of Economic Time Series, Part 1: Prices&quot; in which he suggested that the movement of shares on the stock market was random (as likely to go up on a certain day as to go down). These results were disturbing to some financial economists and further debate and research then followed. This ultimately led to the creation of the random walk hypothesis, and the closely related efficient-market hypothesis which states that random price movements indicate a well-functioning or efficient market.

==CEIR and WFS==
In 1961 he left the University of London and took a position as the managing director (later chairman) of a consulting company, CEIR (later known as Scientific Control Systems), and in the same year began a two-year term as president of the Royal Statistical Society. In the 1960s he published and co-edited a number of volumes and monographs in statistical theory.

In 1972, he became director of the World Fertility Survey, a project sponsored by the International Statistical Institute and the United Nations which aimed to study fertility in developed and developing nations. He continued this work until 1980, when illness forced him to retire.

==Honours==

He was knighted by the British government in 1974 for his services to the theory of statistics, and received a medal from the United Nations in 1980 in recognition for his work on the World Fertility Survey. He was also elected a fellow of the British Academy and received the highest honour of the Royal Statistical Society, the Guy Medal in Gold. 

He additionally had served as president of the Operational Research Society, the Institute of Statisticians, and was elected a fellow of the American Statistical Association, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the Econometric Society, and the British Computer Society. 

At the time of his death in 1983, he was honorary president of the International Statistical Institute.

==Notes==
==Family==
Kendall&#x27;s first wife, Sheila (née Lester), predeceased him. He was survived by their daughter and two sons, and by his second wife, Ruth (née Whitfield) and their son.

<doc id="589141" wikidata="Q500067" url="?curid=589141" title="Treaty of Bucharest (1913)">
<text>The Treaty of Bucharest (; ; ; ) was concluded on 10 August 1913, by the delegates of Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece. The Treaty was concluded in the aftermath of the Second Balkan War and amended the previous Treaty of London, which ended the First Balkan War. About one month later, the Bulgarians signed a separate border treaty (the Treaty of Constantinople) with the Ottomans, who had regained some territory west of the Enos-Midia Line during the second war.

==Background==
Bulgaria, dissatisfied with its gains in the First Balkan War, and especially with Greek and Serbian gains in Macedonia, launched an attack on its former allies in June 1913. The attacks were driven back, and the Greek and Serbian armies invaded Bulgarian-held territory in return. At the same time, the Ottomans advanced into Eastern Thrace and retook Adrianople, while Romania used the opportunity to invade Bulgaria from the north and advance against little opposition to within a short distance of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. Isolated and surrounded by a more powerful coalition of opponents, Bulgaria was forced to agree to a truce and to peace negotiations to be held in the Romanian capital, Bucharest.

All important arrangements and concessions involving the rectification of the controverted international boundary lines were perfected in a series of committee meetings, incorporated in separate protocols, and formally ratified by subsequent action of the general assembly of delegates. Although the Ottomans had also participated in the Second Balkan War, they were not represented at this treaty. Instead, bilateral treaties were later concluded with Bulgaria (Treaty of Constantinople) and Greece (Treaty of Athens).

== Gains in territory ==
=== Serbia ===
The eastern frontier of Serbia was drawn from the summit of Patarika, on the old frontier, and followed the watershed between the Vardar and the Struma rivers to the Greek-Bulgarian boundary, except that the upper valley of the Strumica remained in the possession of Bulgaria. The territory thus obtained by Serbia engulfed central Vardar Macedonia, including &quot;Ochrida, Monastir, Kosovo, Istib, and Kotchana, and the eastern half of the Sanjak of Novi-Pazar&quot;. These territories would today include Novi Pazar in Serbia, Kosovo, and Ohrid, Štip, Kočani and Bitola in present-day North Macedonia. By this arrangement, Serbia increased its territory from and its population by more than 1.5 million.

=== Greece ===
The boundary line separating Greece from Bulgaria was drawn from the crest of Belasica to the mouth of the Mesta (&quot;Nestos&quot;), on the Aegean Sea. This important territorial concession, which Bulgaria resolutely contested, in compliance with the instructions embraced in the notes which the Russian Empire and Austria-Hungary presented to the conference, increased the area of Greece from and its population from 2,660,000 to 4,363,000.

The territory thus gained included large parts of Epirus and Macedonia, including Thessaloniki. The Greek-Bulgarian border was moved eastwards to beyond Kavala, thus restricting the Aegean seaboard of Bulgaria to an inconsiderable extent of 110 km, with only Dedeagach (modern Alexandroupoli) as a seaport. Within this region was also Florina. In addition, Crete was definitively assigned to Greece and was formally taken over on 14 December that year.

=== Bulgaria ===
Bulgaria&#x27;s share of the spoils, although greatly reduced, was not entirely negligible. Its net gains in territory, which embraced a portion of Macedonia, Pirin Macedonia (or Bulgarian Macedonia), including the town of Strumica, Western Thrace, and 110 km of the Aegean littoral, were about , and its population was increased by 129,490.

In addition, Bulgaria agreed to dismantle all existing fortresses and bound itself not to construct forts at Rousse or Shumen or in any of the territory between these two cities, or within a radius of 20 kilometers around Balchik.

=== Romania ===

Bulgaria ceded to Romania Southern Dobruja, lying north of a line extending from the Danube just above Tutrakan (&quot;Turtucaia&quot;) to the western shore of the Black Sea, south of Ekrene (&quot;Ecrene&quot;); Southern Dobruja has an approximate area of , a population of 286,000, and includes the fortress of Silistra and the cities of Tutrakan on the Danube and Balchik (&quot;Balcic&quot;) on the Black Sea.

=== Montenegro ===
The treaty awarded the regions of Berane, Ipek and Gjakova to Montenegro.

==Perception==
According to Anderson and Hershey, the severe terms imposed on Bulgaria contrasted the ambitions of its government upon the entry into the Balkan War: the territory eventually gained was relatively circumscribed; Bulgaria had failed to gain Macedonia, which was Sofia&#x27;s avowed purpose in entering the war, and especially the districts of Ohrid and Bitola, which had been a main demand. With only a small outlet to the Aegean around the minor port of Dedeagach, the country had to abandon its project of Balkan hegemony.

According to Anderson and Hershey, Greece, though a winner and triumphant after the acquisition of Thessaloniki and most of Macedonia up to and including the port of Kavala, still had outstanding issues. Italy was opposed to Greek claims to Northern Epirus, and controlled the Greek-inhabited Dodecanese islands. In addition, the status quo of the islands of the Northeastern Aegean, which Greece had taken from the Ottomans, remained undetermined until February 1914, when the Great Powers recognized Greek sovereignty over them. Tensions with the Ottomans remained high, however, in the face of persecutions of Anatolian Greeks, leading to a crisis and a naval race in summer 1914 that was stopped only by the outbreak of World War I. At the end of the war, Greece still had claims to territories inhabited, at the time, by some 3 million Greeks.

== Rise of Romania as a regional power ==
Following the Second Balkan War, in which Romania&#x27;s intervention proved decisive, and the subsequent 1913 Treaty of Bucharest, Romania&#x27;s dominant position in Southeastern Europe was confirmed. Romania also gained Southern Dobruja from Bulgaria. Romania also raised the question of the Balkan Vlachs (that is, the Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians), whom it considered its compatriots. Too distant to be annexed, however, Romania took Southern Dobruja as compensation. Romania was the strongest nation in the Balkans, and thus it believed that it had to acquire territory, given that its neighbors were being aggrandized. Romania&#x27;s argument that it had turned the scales of the war was accepted without serious objections, due in part to Bulgaria&#x27;s attitude not attracting much compassion. Despite not annexing the areas inhabited by Balkan Vlachs, Romania nevertheless obtained protection of the schools and churches of the Vlachs in the other Balkan states. Thus, Romania was the only Balkan country to obtain guarantees from all three of its neighbors, which pledged to recognize its interest in, and respect the autonomy of the Balkan Vlachs. The status of the Vlachs in Bulgarian territories was settled on 4 August, in Greek territories on 5 August and in Serbian territories between 5 and 7 August. The 1913 Treaty of Bucharest itself was signed on 10 August. One notable aspect of this treaty was the lack of any real involvement from the European Great Powers. The Balkan states hurried to settle their differences before the Great Powers could again intervene in their affairs. That&#x27;s not to say, however, that the treaty went unnoticed, but the reactions among the Great Powers were mixed: there were rumblings from the capitals of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia, while the British and the French rejoiced in the &quot;coming of age&quot; of the Balkan states. The Great Powers did not revise the treaty. Overall, the six Powers of the Concert of Europe had proved themselves to be rather helpless in Balkan crises. They had been unable to prevent the wars and subsequently could not ignore their results. The idea of revising the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest had to be abandoned.

Subsequently, in 1914, Romania managed to impose its candidate for the throne of the Principality of Albania and support his reign by deploying military forces up to a battalion in strength. Romania&#x27;s brief stint as a significant power thus started with the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest, but ended in October 1916. Having joined the First World War on the side of the Allies on 27 August 1916, Romania launched an invasion of Transylvania. However, by 16 October, Transylvania had been cleared of Romanian troops. One week later, on 23 October, Romania&#x27;s chief seaport was captured by the Central Powers.

<doc id="589149" wikidata="Q7208412" url="?curid=589149" title="Poire z">
<text>poire_z (pronounced &quot;pwar-zed&quot;) was an electronic free improvisation music group formed in 1998. Its members all have long careers in improvised music; critic Fred Grand of &quot;Avant&quot; calls poire_z a &quot;post-AMM supergroup.&quot;

==Band history==
At a music festival at Nantes, France in 1998, percussionist Gunter Muller and turntablist Erikm were scheduled to perform as a duo. The same festival featured a performance by duo Voice Crack. The four musicians made an unscheduled collaboration, and afterwards formed a semi-regular quartet.

They recorded several albums and made a number of live appearances before disbanding. poire_z often invited a fifth musician as a guest: Keith Rowe, Phil Minton, Christian Marclay, Otomo Yoshihide, Sachiko M and others performed or recorded with the core quartet.

As with much free improvisation, poire_z&#x27;s music is generally focused more on a group sound, and given the musicians&#x27; unorthodox approach to their instruments, it is often difficult to discern who is generating any individual sound. Aside from glimpses of Muller&#x27;s occasionally unprocessed percussion, their music is nearly all electronic blips, clicks and droning like a shortwave radio tuned in to an extraterrestrial broadcast; critic Ed Howard described the group&#x27;s music as &quot;all whir and purr and throb, the soldered electronic exclamations of the Voice Crack duo spurting around the steady rhythmic drive of Muller and eRikm ... a dense cycling drone with harsh electronic interjections skipping over the top.&quot; One piece is described as &quot;delicate tones, crackles and light bubbling sounds, resting and intermingling with characteristic weightlessness, only occasionally being interrupted by glimpses of harsher textures.&quot;

Voice Crack formally disbanded in about 2004, and poire_z have not recorded or performed since.

*Erikm: 3K-PAD∞System

*Andy Guhl and Norbert Möslang (who recorded as Voice Crack) on homemade electronics.

<text>Chadinga Conservation Park, formerly the Chadinga Conservation Reserve, is a protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located in the Chadinga Dunes on the western side of Lake MacDonnell, in the locality of Penong. The park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area.

The conservation park covers of coastal dunes, containing a lake and areas of Mallee scrub. It is commonly called &quot;Tuckamore&quot; by local people. The dunes extend up to 3 km inland and form a habitat for the spinifex hopping mouse. The conservation park has no visitor facilities, although bush camping is permitted.

The Dinosaur Ant (&quot;Nothomyrmecia macrops&quot;), noted as a &quot;living fossil&quot;, is found within the conservation park. The lake is the largest of several salt lakes in the area - others include Red Lake (a small section of Lake MacDonnell cut off by the Penong to Point Sinclair/Cactus Beach road) and Blue Lake, a smaller lake to the south of Lake MacDonnell.

<text>Chenjerai Hove (9 February 1956 – 12 July 2015), was a Zimbabwean poet, novelist and essayist who wrote in both English and Shona. &quot;Modernist in their formal construction, but making extensive use of oral conventions, Hove&#x27;s novels offer an intense examination of the psychic and social costs - to the rural population, especially, of the war of liberation in Zimbabwe.&quot; He died on 12 July 2015 while living in exile in Norway, with his death attributed to liver failure.

==Life==
The son of a local chief Chenjerai Hove was born in Mazvihwa, near Zvishavane, in what was then Rhodesia. He attended school at Kutama College and Marist Brothers Dete, in the Hwange district of Zimbabwe. After studying in Gweru, he became a teacher and then took degrees at the University of South Africa and the University of Zimbabwe. He also worked as a journalist, and contributed to the anthology &quot;And Now the Poets Speak&quot;. He published regularly in &quot;The Zimbabwean&quot;, an opposition newspaper founded in 2005.

A critic of the policies of the Mugabe government, Hove was living in exile at the time of his death as a fellow at the House of Culture in Stavanger, Norway, as part of the International Cities of Refuge Network (ICORN). Prior to this, he held visiting positions at Lewis and Clark College and Brown University; he was also once a poet-in-residence in Miami. Chenjerai Hove&#x27;s work was translated into several languages (including Japanese, German, and Dutch). He won several awards over the course of his career, including the 1989 Noma Award for Publishing in Africa.

<text>Tristan Honsinger (October 23, 1949 – August 5, 2023) was an American cellist active in free jazz and free improvisation. He is perhaps best known for his long-running collaboration with free jazz pianist Cecil Taylor and guitarist Derek Bailey.

Born in Burlington, Vermont, United States, Honsinger was given music lessons from a very early age, as his mother had hopes of creating a chamber orchestra together with his brother and sister. At the age of 12, Tristan would give concerts on a nearly weekly basis. He studied classical cello at the New England Conservatory in Boston before moving to Montreal in 1969 to avoid the draft. While in Canada, he became interested in improvisational music. Honsinger moved to Europe in 1974 and was active throughout the continent. He operated out of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

Honsinger had a striking appearance, with body language reminiscent of that of a slapstick actor.

Honsinger experimented with a combo of three string-players (violin, cello, and double bass) and drums in 1991, under the name Fields in Miniature, and worked in other musical fields, including collaborations with UK post punk band The Pop Group in 1979, The Ex during the early 1990s, and the Ig Henneman Tentet.

According to Dutch &quot;Volkskrant&quot; journalist Erik van de Berg, &quot;&quot;Honsinger is someone who hasn&#x27;t lost his childhood fantasy entirely. His compositions are like a child&#x27;s drawing, or even more like a story from &quot;Winnie The Pooh&quot;: awkward and touchingly simple, yet full of deeper meanings for those who want to see them.&quot; In the same article, Honsinger commented: &quot;Simple things fascinate me, simple stories and simple characters. It&#x27;s not that I write for children in particular, but I think they would understand it very well. I usually get the best reactions from an audience with a good mix of children and adults. I don&#x27;t like to play for one particular age group. It is almost a necessity for me to compose in the form of stories and texts. It gives me ideas and it does help the musicians in their improvisation if they can think: this story is about a little man who takes a walk and experiences this, that and the other. It also helps the audience, it gives them something to hold on to.&quot;&quot;

Tristan Honsinger died in Trieste on August 5, 2023, at the age of 73.
